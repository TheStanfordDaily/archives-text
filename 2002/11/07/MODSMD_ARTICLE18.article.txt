# THE 						MINISTRY OF TRUTH
## Pumping irony (wink) 
### 
I am going mad. It is impossible to
discern whether people are saying
what they mean or, indeed, the
complete opposite. In conversa
tion, sarcasm has displaced sincerity as
the dominant mode of expression. And
if your observations are not tinged with
blase detachment and cynicism, you risk
being dismissed as a quaint ingenue.
(Did I really use two French words in
that sentence? The nature of the words
says something about Gallic
sensibility . . . )
The gravitation toward irony overall
seems only to be accelerating. Consider

late-nignt talk snows:
Carsonian earnestness
— which highlighted the
former "Tonight Show"
host's wit and charisma
— has been replaced
with David Letterman's
smug ennui, Craig Kil
borne's arrogant smarm
and Jon Stewart's wink
ing phony news deadpan

Similarly, a host of recent movies has
pushed the boundaries of self-awareness.
I could scarcely sit through "Not An
other Teen Movie," for its tireless repeti
tion of the same joke: Hey! We're in a
movie and we know it!
The therapy-attending mobsters of
"Analyze This" and"The Sopranos"
have transformed the iconic mafia don
into a conflicted persona increasingly
aware of his own relativistic morality.
Nor are magazine and newspaper
headlines immune to saturate irony. Try
to find a sports page that does not con
tain at least one punning headline (a
headline from Friday's Daily: "Football
can't duck tough Oregon test")
On a more local level, Stanford un
dergraduate life exudes irony and irrev
erence ad nauseam. Consider our icon
oclastic marching band or the "Wacky
Walk" that reduces much of our Com
mencement ceremony to a tawdry cos
tume party. Many dorms bear a product
tie-in theme — a sardonic jab at con
sumerism? Parties often have silly, ab
surd or ironic themes. (I am reminded
of feeling out of place at an '80s party for
failing to have brought a retro
wardrobe to school with me.) Stanford
students eschew the traditional forms of
American college revelry lest they sur
render their self-awareness.
Within such a pervasive culture of
irony, it seems logical that a purportedly
authentic medium has emerged: the re
ality television show. While the subjects
of reality shows are probably perform
ing to some extent — who can reason
ably act natural and unaffected with a
camera crew following them? — they
are, at the very least, actual people and
not contrived dramatis personae. The
knowledge that the events depicted
happened in earnest provides a mod
icum of sincerity. The absence of formu
laic dialogue, laugh tracks and pat story
lines can be refreshing.
Perhaps in response to our own par

ticularly ironic Zeitgeist, reality pro
gramming has exploded in the last three
or four years.
If you are half the telephile that I am,
then you have noticed that reality shows
have a virtual stranglehold on TV enter
tainment.The Nielsen ratings from two
weeks ago give testimony: "The Bache
lor" outperformed Game 4 of the World
Series in the ratings for ages 18 to 49
while "Survivor: Thailand" beat out
both Game 3 and Game 5 for all age
groups.
An undeniable allure of these shows is
the prospect of viewing and judging an
other person's life with detached impuni
ty. Thanks to deft editing, all the mistakes
and misjudgments of a week in the sub
jects' lives can be distilled into a half-hour
segment. Viewers enjoy a twofold divi
dend. They can guiltlessly censure the in
discretions of real-life people. Then they
can reflect on their own comparatively
virtuous lives.
Perhaps the best illustration of this
appeal is the popularity of "The Anna
Nicole Show." The show, which depicts
the corpulent model's daily life, finds it
self in good company with the E! chan
nel's typical fare of mindless celebrity
worship. It is also a fairly transparent ef
fort by E! to mimic the enormous success
of MTV's "The Osbournes."
But while "The Osbournes" has
some redeeming features (the family
leads a wildly unorthodox life, but they
genuinely care for one another), the
"Anna" show seems to suffer from the
same brainless disorientation as its
plump heroine. Anna Nicole dawdles
through each day in a pouty, lachry
mose oblivion.
Has entertainment really been re
duced to this? Watching the follies of an
emotionally maladjusted plus-sized
model must be the very guiltiest of plea
sures. And now that E! has elected to
renew the series, American popular cul
ture's voyeuristic fetish may have
reached its nadir.
I am most troubled, however, by the
possibility that "The Anna Nicole Show"
constitutes a new species of reality pro
grams. Unlike other series that empha
size spontaneity and unscripted, unedit
ed candor, "The Anna Nicole Show"
casts itself as a sitcom. Witness the car
toon-enhanced promos, the "outra
geous" theme song and the running
joke: Anna does not know, or does not
care, that her every move is being broad
cast. I smell irony.
It finally happened. E! has complete
ly blurred the space between truth and
fiction. The entertainment industry has
finally placed "air-quotes" around the
world. Reality itself is ironic. Just kid
ding. What? (Wink.)

"postmodern" in this column because he is
convinced nobody actually knows what it
means. He'll be back next week with his ag
gressively right-wing politics. E-mail him at

both Game 3 and Game 5 for all age
groups.
An undeniable allure of these shows is
the prospect of viewing and judging an
other person's life with detached impuni
ty. Thanks to deft editing, all the mistakes
and misjudgments of a week in the sub
jects' lives can be distilled into a half-hour
segment. Viewers enjoy a twofold divi
dend. They can guiltlessly censure the in
discretions of real-life people. Then they
can reflect on their own comparatively
virtuous lives.
Perhaps the best illustration of this
appeal is the popularity of "The Anna
Nicole Show." The show, which depicts
the corpulent model's daily life, finds it
self in good company with the E! chan
nel's typical fare of mindless celebrity
worship. It is also a fairly transparent ef
fort by E! to mimic the enormous success
of MTV's "The Osbournes."
But while "The Osbournes" has
some redeeming features (the family
leads a wildly unorthodox life, but they
genuinely care for one another), the
"Anna" show seems to suffer from the
same brainless disorientation as its
plump heroine. Anna Nicole dawdles
through each day in a pouty, lachry
mose oblivion.
Has entertainment really been re
duced to this? Watching the follies of an
emotionally maladjusted plus-sized
model must be the very guiltiest of plea
sures. And now that E! has elected to
renew the series, American popular cul
ture's voyeuristic fetish may have
reached its nadir.
I am most troubled, however, by the
possibility that "The Anna Nicole Show"
constitutes a new species of reality pro
grams. Unlike other series that empha
size spontaneity and unscripted, unedit
ed candor, "The Anna Nicole Show"
casts itself as a sitcom. Witness the car
toon-enhanced promos, the "outra
geous" theme song and the running
joke: Anna does not know, or does not
care, that her every move is being broad
cast. I smell irony.
It finally happened. E! has complete
ly blurred the space between truth and
fiction. The entertainment industry has
finally placed "air-quotes" around the
world. Reality itself is ironic. Just kid
ding. What? (Wink.)

I am going mad. It is impossible to
discern whether people are saying
what they mean or, indeed, the
complete opposite. In conversa
tion, sarcasm has displaced sincerity as
the dominant mode of expression. And
if your observations are not tinged with
blase detachment and cynicism, you risk
being dismissed as a quaint ingenue.
(Did I really use two French words in
that sentence? The nature of the words
says something about Gallic
sensibility . . . )
The gravitation toward irony overall
seems only to be accelerating. Consider

late-nignt talk snows:
Carsonian earnestness
— which highlighted the
former "Tonight Show"
host's wit and charisma
— has been replaced
with David Letterman's
smug ennui, Craig Kil
borne's arrogant smarm
and Jon Stewart's wink
ing phony news deadpan

Similarly, a host of recent movies has
pushed the boundaries of self-awareness.
I could scarcely sit through "Not An
other Teen Movie," for its tireless repeti
tion of the same joke: Hey! We're in a
movie and we know it!
The therapy-attending mobsters of
"Analyze This" and"The Sopranos"
have transformed the iconic mafia don
into a conflicted persona increasingly
aware of his own relativistic morality.
Nor are magazine and newspaper
headlines immune to saturate irony. Try
to find a sports page that does not con
tain at least one punning headline (a
headline from Friday's Daily: "Football
can't duck tough Oregon test")
On a more local level, Stanford un
dergraduate life exudes irony and irrev
erence ad nauseam. Consider our icon
oclastic marching band or the "Wacky
Walk" that reduces much of our Com
mencement ceremony to a tawdry cos
tume party. Many dorms bear a product
tie-in theme — a sardonic jab at con
sumerism? Parties often have silly, ab
surd or ironic themes. (I am reminded
of feeling out of place at an '80s party for
failing to have brought a retro
wardrobe to school with me.) Stanford
students eschew the traditional forms of
American college revelry lest they sur
render their self-awareness.
Within such a pervasive culture of
irony, it seems logical that a purportedly
authentic medium has emerged: the re
ality television show. While the subjects
of reality shows are probably perform
ing to some extent — who can reason
ably act natural and unaffected with a
camera crew following them? — they
are, at the very least, actual people and
not contrived dramatis personae. The
knowledge that the events depicted
happened in earnest provides a mod
icum of sincerity. The absence of formu
laic dialogue, laugh tracks and pat story
lines can be refreshing.
Perhaps in response to our own par

ticularly ironic Zeitgeist, reality pro
gramming has exploded in the last three
or four years.
If you are half the telephile that I am,
then you have noticed that reality shows
have a virtual stranglehold on TV enter
tainment.The Nielsen ratings from two
weeks ago give testimony: "The Bache
lor" outperformed Game 4 of the World
Series in the ratings for ages 18 to 49
while "Survivor: Thailand" beat out
both Game 3 and Game 5 for all age
groups.
