Column portrays fraternities
in an inaccurate light
Alex Greninger and Tim Meyer's col
umn, "Stanford's 'Social' Contract," (Oct.
(>) is full of inaccuracies and really misses
the point. While I certainly agree that so
cial life at Stanford has taken a dreadful
turn for the worse, the suggestions offered
in the article are either unusable or based
on false premises.
First, fraternities at Stanford do not re
ceive housed status because they add to the
s(x ial scene. One look at their housing con
tracts will tell you that. Also, even the impli
cation that fraternities are indebted to Stan
ford's social life is off base. If the University
considered fraternities so integral to cam
pus social life, why the harsh crackdown?
Also, Greninger and Meyer's point makes a
distinction between fraternities and sorori
ties. Both have the same privileged housing
status, but sororities rarely throw parties.
Fraternities and sororities are housed for
the same reasons, and these reasons have
nothing to do with social events.
Second, Greninger and Meyer suggest
that fraternities should sponsor other
events, such as campus-wide sporting
events. Did they not hear about Spike-n-
Jam on Oct. 2() (which, by the way, was
sponsored by the Interfraternity Council)?
Finally, the suggestion that fraternities
throw dry parties with a wink toward alco
hol being brought in is just awful. If a fra
ternity already on alcohol probation were
caught with any sort of alcohol in common
rooms at a party, the consequences would
be severe. Any other view of the issue is
naive. In addition, city parties are bound
to be less successful. The statement that
"people don't go to fiat parties to get
drunk" and the assertion that dry parties
are doomed to failure are not mutually ex
clusive. Just because people don't often
gel drunk solely off of the alcohol at 112 ra
ternity parties doesn't mean that the
promise of free alcohol is not a major draw
to parties. If alcohol isn't important to par
ties, then why do people wait in line for 20
minutes fora beer? I may not go to parties

to get drunk, but I do go to drink. There
is a difference. Like-minded people will be
much less likely to go to a dry party.
While I applaud Greninger and Meyer
for trying to bring the lack of social enjoy
ment on campus to light, they need to show
more regard for the accuracy of their column
and the responsibility of their suggestions.

Will the chemicals on Stanford's campus
make us sick?
As I walked through White Plaza today,
112 saw a man wearing a rubber suit, rubber
gloves and rubber boots, spraying a bright
green chemical through a nozzle far from
his face onto a place beneath a tree, where
people sometimes sit and eat.
Now I'm lying on the edge of the plaza
lawn, which maybe has some "safe" dan
gerous chemicals on it. By "safe" danger
ous, I mean we haven't figured out yet that
they are harmful.
For example, why are people getting
chronic fatigue, asthma and autism these
days? We don't know, but it's certainly
chemical at some point, and it's probably
something we're doing to our environ
ment. Will this lawn make me sick? Were
we asked about the chemicals on it? (If we
were asked with the voice of a whisper,
that's not asking.)
More generally, are we confined to a
prison of other peoples' reckless deci
sions? In a society we wish to create, who
will decide how much to experiment with
our shared environment? Will a letter like
this help to create that more respectful so
ciety, which I think most of us want?

Think before submitting 'illogical tripe'
to The Dally
Although I am undertaking graduate

studies at Boston University, I often read
The Stanford Daily online, as it differs
greatly from our own student newspaper
and, on a consistent basis, contains more
intelligent commentary. Lately, however,
letters have deviated from this trend. I
am compelled to comment on a particu
lar response.
Physics graduate student Adam Ed
wards' letter to the editor entitled "The
Civil War did not free a single African-
American from slavery" (Nov. 5) serves as
an excellent example of the illogical tripe
that has recently been spattered across the
pages of The Daily. Edwards attacks a pre
vious article but fails to limit his argument
to only one or two salient points or decon
struct the article itself.
One of Edwards' most disturbing
points is that he feels a certain right to
comment on the effects of slavery because
he is "personally related to those people
who were supposedly freed" by the Civil
War and Emancipation Proclamation. It is
unsettling that Edwards thinks one must
have such a tie to properly evaluate histo
ry. My lineage does not contain any for
mer slaves, as Edwards' does. However,
our ability and efforts to empathize with
historical actors puts us all in a position to
effectively pursue truth in history. Must
we experience a direct tie to an event to
properly evaluate it? I need not smoke
crack cocaine to know that it's bad for me.
A body without a skeleton cannot
stand; this analogy must also be applied to
arguments. We all have opinions, but they
must be supported in order to be valid.
Edwards espouses an opinion without
backing it up. I'll is tragic flaw instantly dis
misses Edwards' contribution to rational
public debate.
I suggest that, for the sake of the read
ership, pieces are given a great deal more
thought before they are submitted. Show
them to friends and ask for criticism. Even
better, set your piece aside and read it the
next morning. If it still makes sense, read
it out loud. If it sounds coherent, e-mail it
in for all of us to consider.

Daily endorsements reflect
media's liberal bias
I am a recent Stanford alumnus and
read your endorsements lor this election.
1 respect your board's decisions and your
right to speak out on the issues, and 1
thank yon lor at least contributing to the
electoral process. However, I must ad
dress a key issue that I believe your read
ers should hear about regarding the elec

tion and the election process.
Conservatives have argued for years
that the media has a liberal bias, and for
t lie most part, I tended to disagree with
this opinion. Then I got involved with pol
itics and was a volunteer lot the Simon
campaign. More recently I have worked
for John Sanchez, the [defeated] Republi
can gubernatorial candidate in New Mex
ico. My opinion of the media, including
newspapers like yours, has been drastical
ly changed. Media sources have repeated
ly shown a disregard for the conservative
viewpoint and show a blanket support for
liberal ideals.
So where is the proof? Well, let me start
out by pointing out that an Associated
Press poll of newscasters, reporters and
newspaper editors following the 2000
election showed that over 80 percent of
those polled had voted for A1 Gore. Not
proof enough, I understand, but evidence
that something odd does exist.

More proof? Mow about this: In t lit'
New Mexico race, Mr. Sanchez ran
against former congressman and Secre
tary of Energy Bill Richardson. Both can
didates were invited to Las Cruces last
month to be given a tour of the downtown
area by a group encouraging economic
development. 1 was fortunate enough to
go with Mr. Sanchez, and I was spec ilical
ly told not to bring political memorabilia
or invite supporters to the tour. Mr
Sanchez met with different business lead
ers and heard the complaints about and
ideas for the downtown area. At the end of
the tour, we were interviewed by the local
paper and news station. At this point in
the election, the polls showed an eight- to
nine-point margin, meaning the race was
not over yet.
A week later we received a copy of the
local paper in Las Cruces, and we were
shocked to see once again the liberal bias
that 1 refer to in this letter. On the front

page of the paper was Mr. Richardson in
downtown Las Cruces with about 40 sup
porters with signs and buttons. The
woman that led our tour called our office
and told its how furious she was that
Richardson took advantage of her invita
tion to turn the event into a political rally.
Sound familiar? Look at what Democrats
did in Minnesota. T hat funeral for Mr.
Wellstone — if you can call it that — was
ridiculous, disgraceful and insulting. But
of course if you listen to the national news,
all you hear is that Republicans have politi
cized Wellstone's death. Yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.
Furthermore, in the Simon campaign
in California, a big deal has been made
over Simon's company. Paper after paper,
newscast after newscast, argue that
Simon's company has done illegal acts and
have criticized his ability as a leader. I hat s
fine: If a paper wants to criticize a candi
date, so be it, but don't lie to the public.

Simon has not done anything illegal and
nothing has been proven in court — but to
Califbrnians, Simon has become a cast
away because of the media bombardment.
Granted, Mr. Simon has not helped his
cause, and Gray Davis' negative ads are
part ol the cause as well, but the media has
created a mentality that both candidates
are inept and cannot lead — a brilliant tac
tic by liberals since this will heavily favor
the' incumbent candidate.
So what does all this have to do with
The Stanford Daily? It is very interesting
that the paper endorsed all Democrats or
the more liberal Greens and endorsed
every tax and spend proposition possible
except the one (after-school programs)
being pushed by conservatives. Interest
ing. But then again, there is no liberal bias
in the media, right?
