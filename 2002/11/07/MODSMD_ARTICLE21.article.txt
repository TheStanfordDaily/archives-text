## The
						axis of confusion: undoing the N. Korea-Iraq analogies 
### 
North Korea and Iraq, though
both members of the "axis of
evil," are not alike. They pose dif
ferent threats and merit different
strategic responses. The only reason we
think they're similar in the first place is Ix 1 -
cause President Bush told us to, and no one
seems to fx- telling us otherwise. Indeed,
many Americans are making the mistake —
a mistake thus unremedied by the Bush ad
ministration — of internalizing a rhetorical
construct that many of us disagreed with
when first disseminated. They have used it as
a basis to allege hypocrisy in the likely intent
to attack Iraq (which presently has no nucle
ar capability that we know of) while leaving
North Korea (which has or soon will have
such a capability) alone.
Speechwriters are sometimes the most
powerful people in Washington. The turn
of a phrase by an artful wordsmith can
quickly become a part of the national ver
nacular. In perhaps his most moving
speech to date, on Sept. 20, 2001, Bush in
spired an emotional Congress and a
wounded nation — in words penned by his
gifted speechwriter, Michael Gerson — by
declaring that terrorism would "follow a

path to history's un
marked grave of discard
ed lies."
Less uniformly wel
comed, however, was
Bush's portrayal, in his
State of the Union Ad
dress, of Iran, Iraq and
North Korea as an "axis of
evil, arming to threaten

the peace of the world." The construction,
intended to evoke images of the VVVVII axis
powers, instantly ignited debate. For Euro
peans, the "axis ofevil" was but another in
the string of uncouth blunders by the trig
ger-happy unilateralist cowboy, revealing
much about the "simplistic" nature of
American foreign policy.
The consensus in Washington (if such a
thing ever exists) was that the speechwriter
who coined the phrase had probably not an
ticipated the scope of the public's reaction,
but that the president was nevertheless pre
pared to stick by it. As a result, it stuck
among the American people: For whatever
we thought of the "axis," we bought it.
But as of a few weeks ago, the administra
tion must be wishing we hadn't. When

North Korea announced that ii had l>een
conducting a secret nuclear weapons pro
gram, in clear violation ol the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NIT) and the 1994 bi
lateral agreement with the United States, the
American public was abuzz with questions:
Does this mean we have to attack North
Korea? I low is this scenario different from
Iraq? Those who already objected to invad
ing Iraq invited the announcement as an op
portunity to assert that the administration
has no reason to invade Iraq except that Sad
dam tried to kill the president s daddy. All of
these questions revolve around a faulty
premise: the administration's rhetorical
mandate that we somehow connec t the two.
This is wrong. The phrase "axis of evil"
should be downgraded, immediately and
forever, from strategic paradigm to catchy
sound bite. Assuming that demotion, here
are two important differences between Iraq
and North Korea:
We're past the point of no return in
North Korea. Simple but true: It's much
more dangerous to invade a country with
nuclear weapons, because that country has
nuclear weapons. An autocrat with the abil
ity to do terrible things at the push of a but

ton is harder to unseat than one who lacks
such a capability. So, we've missed the boat
on a non-nuclear North Korea, but Sad
dam c an st ill be stopped if we act now.
Kim Jong II is evil and crazy, but maybe
not as evil and crazy as Saddam. Make no
mistake: lhe Korean despot is not a good
guy. I le starves his people so he can build
weapons and uses repression to ensure
compliance. I four executive order against
political assassinations were repealed, Kim
would be well-advised to invest in some
Kevlar. But his strategic posture is primar
ily defensive and insular — and has been
(with a few nasty exceptions) since his la
ther's troops crossed hack over the 38th
parallel 50 years ago — whereas Saddam's
is expansionist and aggressive.
Kim's forays into diplomacy of late —
he occasionally supports the "sunshine"
policy that increases openness in north
south relations on the peninsula — sug
gest that his revelation about his nukes is as
much intended to leverage his neighbors
into a Cold War-style detente as it is to
brandish his destructive abilities. While
this dynamic may generate a level of re
gional stability on the Indo-Pak level —

whic h is by no means comforting — it si ill
poses a lesser danger than Saddam, who
lias already shown a willingness lo use
what weapons of mass destruction he has
on his own people and to launch missiles at
;i neighbor without express provocation.
Admittedly, these two reasons — which
advocate diplomatic deterrence with North
Korea while calling for an opposite course
in Iraq — do not present a stellar justifica
tion. But experts on both sides of the aisle
assert that North Korea (and Iran, inciden
tally), unlike Iraq, are places where negoti
ation should trump military action.
It is time for the administration to better
define and defend the actions we will take
with respect to each state in question,and in
doing so, to relegate "axis of evil" to the
grave of political rhetoric's discarded mis
nomers.
