# Club puts students on cutting edge of biotechnology
## Designing the Future Stanford Student Biodesign reflects students' passion for medicine, business 
### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The fusion of biology and technology
into fields such as biomedicine and
biotechnology has allowed biologists
and engineers to make important ad
vancements in medicine and research.
Stanford students interested in these
fields have successfully created and
run the Stanford Student Biodesign
club, which aims to involve students in
this innovative segment of medicine
and biotechnology.
Stanford Student Biodesign is only
a year old, yet this young club has de
veloped a large membership and has
already sponsored several events on
campus. It reflects what fourth-year
graduate student and co-founder
Mary O'Connell called students' "pas
sion for improving patient care and
human quality of life."
The idea was first conceived in
spring 2001 when Dr. Paul Yock, a
specialist in cardiovascular medicine
at Stanford's Medical School, noticed
the large number of students who
were interested in classes relating to
biodesign.
O'Connell also saw this interest
among her fellow students. She held

the initial meeting of the club that
April, drawing an impressive turnout
of 40 students. Her goal at that point
was simply to increase communication
across academic disciplines relating to
biodesign.
"Engineers, scientists, medical stu
dents and physicians each have pow
erful tools that enable them to develop
innovative solutions to improve cur
rent treatments and unsolved chal
lenges," she said. "The key is getting
them to communicate and combine
their expertise to develop truly amaz
ing solutions."
Co-founder Kenny Lin had the
business expertise that O'Connell
lacked; once he became involved in
the fall of 2001, the club began aim
ing for loftier goals. The club began
to grow around a more expansive vi
sion.
"We want to give our members
tools to be successful leaders in bio
technology and biomedicine through
real world experience," said sopho
more Eric Wong, chief financial officer
for the club.
In the past year, the club has ex
panded to encompass five focus com
mittees and about 500 members, in
cluding 20 board members. The five
committees cover everything from
events and publications to community
outreach and business development.
"One of our main goals is to com
municate with the non-scientific com
munity," Wong said.

This is the focus of their speaker
events as well as their quarterly
newsletter, The Messenger, which
serves to educate the outside commu
nity about the club as well as new de
velopments in biotechnology.
Today's speaker event is right in
line with these goals: I)r. Kevin
Ohashi, the director of research for
Corazon Technologies, will discuss en
gineering and biotechnology.
Another fledgling project for the
club this year is the freshman intern
ship program. The program will con
nect interested freshmen with senior
board members in the club to help
them get a head-start in the world of
biotechnology. The program will try
to provide the interns with hands on
experience that will help them suc
ceed in the future. Interested students
who wish to intern can apply later in
the year.
Overall, everything the club does
tries to make connections between in
dustry and academia, as well as dif
ferent disciplines across the Universi
ty. However, their main focus is to
make a difference in the field of
biotechnology.
O'Connell stated, "We hope [Stan
ford Student Biodesign] members will
become future leaders and innovators
whose enthusiasm for biomedicine
and life science technology will lead to
technological breakthroughs and dis
coveries that will improve human
quality of life."
