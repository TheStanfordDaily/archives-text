## Women prep for Arizona 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With its come-from-behind five-game win
over then-No. 1 Southern California in Los
Angeles on Saturday, the Stanford women's
volleyball team was able to cross a name off its
list of teams to which it owes payback for loss
es in the first half of the season. The Trojans
had defeated Stanford in similar fashion at
Maples Pavilion on Oct. 4.

The No. 4 Cardinal (21-3, 11-2 Pacific-10
Conference) can pick off another name on its
list tonight when it takes on No. 16 Arizona
(12-8, 7-5) at 7:00 p.m. in Maples.
A win over the Wildcats, who overcame a 2-
0 deficit to stun Stanford in five games in Tuc
son on Oct. 11, would bring the list down to
one — but the Cardinal's shot at No. 3 Flori
da, a 3-0 winner over Stanford on Sept. 14,
would only come in the NCAA Final Four.
But to defeat Arizona tonight, Stanford will
have to avoid getting too distracted by its huge
matchup on Sunday with the new No. 1 team
in the land, Hawaii (21-0). And that's no easy
task, given how hard it's going to be to win that
match, especially in Honolulu.
Fhe Wahine lead the country in kills and
hitting percentage, a deadly combination that
has led Hawaii to drop just two games all sea
son and sweep its last 15 opponents.
Hawaii boasts two players who are averag
ing over live kills and three digs per game —
junior outside hitters Kim Willoughby (6.43
kpg, 3.44 dpg) and Lily Kohumaku (5.28 kpg,

3.15 dpg). Senior outside hitter Logan Tom
(4.77 kpg, 3.08 dpg) is the only one doing any
thing remotely like that for Stanford.
"Lily and Kim are both extremely skilled
players ... you can only stop them so much,"
Stanford coach John Dunning said. "You do
what you can do, but it's still a serve and pass
game. The match will go probably on which
team's outside hitters do a better job."
But the Cardinal has a more balanced at
tack than the Wahine, with junior middles
Jenn Harvey and Sara McGee and senior
rightside hitter Ashley Ivy boosting the Stan
ford attack led by Tom and sophomore out
side hitter Ogonna Nnamani. McGee's 3.11
kills per game and nation-high .442 hitting
percentage have especially made the Cardinal
dangerous on slide attacks out of the middle.
"We've got to have more offensive output
from the rest of us besides Logan," McGee said.
They'll be focusing on the outsides, so [the
middles have ] got to put the balls we get down."
Even more dangerous has been Stan
ford's nation-leading block, which is aver
aging 3.73 blocks per game behind Harvey
and McGee, the Pac-10's top two blockers.
The Cardinal will need a big night at the
net to have any chance of slowing down
Hawaii's ferocious attack.
The Cardinal is also going to have to deal
with a nasty travel itinerary that gives the team
barely more than 24 hours on the island and,
perhaps more intimidating, a packed house at
Hawaii's Stan Sheriff Center. By Monday, the
10,300-seat arena sold out for this Sunday's
contest, but the Cardinal isn't too fazed by the
expected playing conditions.

the most fans on the road, [Stanford] would

probably have an all-time high this
year with the number we've seen
this year," Dunning said. "We're
used to playing in front of big
crowds."
A large home crowd is some
thing that Arizona is going to have
to do without in its rematch with
the Clardinal. Over 9,000 people —
the largest crowd ever fora Pac-10
match — turned out for the teams'
first meeting and helped the Wild
cats turn the tide in the match to
overcome a two-game deficit.
From that last match, Stanford
has all of the evidence it needs that
it can take clown Arizona tonight.
The Cardinal was outhitting the
Wildcats .419 to .206 at the inter
mission last time out before a melt
down in the third game took Stan
ford out of the match.
"Both teams will be ready to
play," McC.ee said. "We can't let up
after game two. We can't really let
up at all."
Stanford will l<x)k to do a better
job of slowing down Arizona fresh
man outside hitter Kim Glass, who
ran off 28 kills on the Cardinal in
the first match. But Stanford can at
least be more confident in a back
row that has improved a great dt j al
since allowing 12 aces to the Wild
cats last month.
The Cardinal will also have to
make the quick transition to pre
pare for No. 23 Arizona State
(10-7, (3-6), which Stanford will
take on at Maples tomorrow
night at 7:00 p.m.
Stanford crushed the Sun Devils
in their first meeting on Oct. 10,
and, to avoid a repeat, Arizona
State's star outside hitter, Juliana
Escobar, is going to have to find a
way to get around the Cardinal
block, which shut her down com
pletely last month.
The Sun Devils lost to No. 21
Washington and No. 17 Washing
ton State at home last weekend.
