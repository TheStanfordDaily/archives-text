## Women prep for Arizona 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With its come-from-behind five-game win
over then-No. 1 Southern California in Los
Angeles on Saturday, the Stanford women's
volleyball team was able to cross a name off its
list of teams to which it owes payback for loss
es in the first half of the season. The Trojans
had defeated Stanford in similar fashion at
Maples Pavilion on Oct. 4.

vs. No. 16 Arizona, Today, 7:00 p.m.

at No. 1 Hawaii, Sunday, 6:00 p.m.

The No. 4 Cardinal (21-3, 11-2 Pacific-10
Conference) can pick off another name on its
list tonight when it takes on No. 16 Arizona
(12-8, 7-5) at 7:00 p.m. in Maples.
A win over the Wildcats, who overcame a 2-
0 deficit to stun Stanford in five games in Tuc
son on Oct. 11, would bring the list down to
one — but the Cardinal's shot at No. 3 Flori
da, a 3-0 winner over Stanford on Sept. 14,
would only come in the NCAA Final Four.
But to defeat Arizona tonight, Stanford will
have to avoid getting too distracted by its huge
matchup on Sunday with the new No. 1 team
in the land, Hawaii (21-0). And that's no easy
task, given how hard it's going to be to win that
match, especially in Honolulu.
Fhe Wahine lead the country in kills and
hitting percentage, a deadly combination that
has led Hawaii to drop just two games all sea
son and sweep its last 15 opponents.
Hawaii boasts two players who are averag
ing over live kills and three digs per game —
junior outside hitters Kim Willoughby (6.43
kpg, 3.44 dpg) and Lily Kohumaku (5.28 kpg,

3.15 dpg). Senior outside hitter Logan Tom
(4.77 kpg, 3.08 dpg) is the only one doing any
thing remotely like that for Stanford.
"Lily and Kim are both extremely skilled
players ... you can only stop them so much,"
Stanford coach John Dunning said. "You do
what you can do, but it's still a serve and pass
game. The match will go probably on which
team's outside hitters do a better job."
But the Cardinal has a more balanced at
tack than the Wahine, with junior middles
Jenn Harvey and Sara McGee and senior
rightside hitter Ashley Ivy boosting the Stan
ford attack led by Tom and sophomore out
side hitter Ogonna Nnamani. McGee's 3.11
kills per game and nation-high .442 hitting
percentage have especially made the Cardinal
dangerous on slide attacks out of the middle.
"We've got to have more offensive output
from the rest of us besides Logan," McGee said.
They'll be focusing on the outsides, so [the
middles have ] got to put the balls we get down."
Even more dangerous has been Stan
ford's nation-leading block, which is aver
aging 3.73 blocks per game behind Harvey
and McGee, the Pac-10's top two blockers.
The Cardinal will need a big night at the
net to have any chance of slowing down
Hawaii's ferocious attack.
The Cardinal is also going to have to deal
with a nasty travel itinerary that gives the team
barely more than 24 hours on the island and,
perhaps more intimidating, a packed house at
Hawaii's Stan Sheriff Center. By Monday, the
10,300-seat arena sold out for this Sunday's
contest, but the Cardinal isn't too fazed by the
expected playing conditions.

the most fans on the road, [Stanford] would

Senior setter Anna Robinson and junior middle blocker Sara McGee go up for
a block against Oregon State on Sept. 27. The Cardinal will look to avenge
an early-season loss to Arizona tonight at Maples Pavilion at 7:00 p.m.
