# McKenze Murphy readies for her senior season
## 'Believe in Belief' 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is a quote on the wall of the Stan
lord women's swimming and diving
team's locker room that reads "Believe in
Belief." And on any given day, it's safe to
assume that diver McKenze Murphy's
eyes have run across that quote, and that
she uses it as a reminder that confidence
means everything on her journey toward
the NCAA championships in March.
After finishing fifth in 1-meter diving
and seventh in platform diving at last
year's NCAA Championships, Murphy
has started her senior season with high
hopes and a sense of resolution to achieve
her goals.
"As an underclassman, it's easy to think
that you have all the time in the world until

NCAAs, but I've learned that I have no
time to waste," Murphy said.
In preparation for the N(IAA Cham
pionships, which will take place in
Auburn, Ala., Murphy is fine-tuning
her dives by focusing on every tiny
movement that she executes. Bad habits
are the most common threats to her
performance in competition, so Mur
phy is breaking as many of those old
habits as possible in every practice.
"My goal is to be consistent enough by
NCAA zones so that I trust my diving and
only have to worry about reducing my
anxiety during competition," said Mur
phy, who finished second, third and fifth

at last year's zone meet in platform, 1-
meter and 3-meter diving, respectively.
Anxiety apparently wasn't a problem
for Murphy last weekend in Texas, as she
blew past the Longhorn and Trojan divers
to claim first place in platform diving.
"Her last platform practice was excel
lent," Stanford diving coach Rick
Schavone said of Murphy's preparation
for the Texas meet. "Hopefully due to her
hard work, some missing platform skills
are coming around."
Murphy was also excited about her
platform performance but hopes to see
more improvement in her springboard
diving, as she finished fifth in that event
last weekend.
The corrections Murphy has made will
be put to the test when she and her team
mates compete again at the Trojan Diving
Invite in Los Angeles this weekend.
Schavone will take a small squad of
three female divers down to USC this
weekend: Murphy, sophomore Ashlee
Rosenthal and freshman Michaela
Skloven. Rosenthal and Skloven placed
sixth and eighth, respectively, during 1-
meter competitions in Texas last weekend.
"All three divers stepped up and dived
better than they have been practicing,"
Schavone said of the Texas meet. "We
must make some major improvements."
The Cardinal divers will face the small
but strong host team for the second time
this season, in addition to competing with
athletes from California, UC-Irvine,
UCIA, San Diego State, UC-San Diego
and Fresno State.
According to Murphy, the necessary
improvements are within reach for her
two teammates.
"Michaela is only a freshman, but she
has already proven to be a hard worker
who's just beginning to make important
contributions to the team," Murphy said.
She is also continually impressed with
Rosenthal, of whom she says, "She may
