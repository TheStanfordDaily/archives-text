# Divers head south for Trojan Invite

### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Strength lies in numbers, or so the say
ing goes. For most sports teams, the more
athletes, the better. The Cardinal football
program boasts an impressive 94-man
roster, and the basketball team has ample
room for 30 athletes. To the Stanford
men's diving team, however, three seems
like just the perfect number.
I low can three athletes possibly have
any chance of survival in the cutthroat
world of collegiate athletics? This year,

Men's Diving
at the Trojan Invite, Thursday through Saturday

one trio of divers, comprised of senior
Gavin Olmstead and sophomores Jeff
Dnrbin and Adam Peterson, looks to
make a big name for itself on the nation
al diving scene.
"Technically, we area part of the swim
ming team, but our training programs are
completely separate," Olmstead said. "We
definitely are not swimmers. Sometimes
people ask me if I swim laps in between

dives, and I have to tell them that I don't.
Though we compete together in many of
the meets, the swimming and diving teams
each have their own identities."
The Cardinal trifecta has a shot at
scoring at this spring's NCAA Champi
onships, an accomplishment that the div
ing program has not managed since
1996. Though Peterson qualified (or the
NCAA meet in 2002, lit- did not score.
At last year's NCAA Championships,
Stanford narrowly fell to Texas, whose
divers scored 150 points to give them the crucial edge
against the Cardinal. However, several standout
divers from Texas, including an Olympian, graduat
ed in 2002, leaving more than enough room for Stan
lord divers to step in and fill the void.
"This is by far the most unified team we've ever
had," Durbin said. "Diving is such an individual sport,
and it's difficult to get all the guys to really come to
gether as a team. I think that this unity will definitely
help us in competition."
According to Stanford's veteran diving coach Rick
Schavone, the dynamic between the three athletes is
unlike any he's seen in recent years. ()lmstead did not
compete last year in order to focus on his academic
studies, which allected the Cardinal both in practice
and in competition. With Olmstead back in training,
though, Schavone sees victory on the horizon.
"Wealmost lost the whole team whenCavin left last
year," Schavone said. "His personality and his atti
tude are the c enter of the entire diving program. The
three divers are already ahead of target. They are
phenomenal in the weight room and at the pool, and
I am very excited to see what they can do."
Olmstead, Durbin and Peterson will have their first
opportunity to test the waters as they head into two
days of competition beginning today at the Trojan In
vite hosted by Southern California.
"It's still a little early in the year to be concerned
with results," Olmstead said. "Our biggest diving ri
vals are Arizona and Arizona State, and they are not
going to be at the invite. We won't compete against
them until later on in the season. We just want to go
into the meet and be competitive and test our tech
nique. We will have plenty of time to worry about
points later on in the season."
Up to this point, the clivers have focused mainly on
perfecting the basic mechanics of their dives, flic 1
team rounds out its training program with two days of
weights per week, stretching and trampoline work.
"It's really important for us to get the basic mechanic s
clown and to build muscle memory early in the season,"
Peterson said. "This spoil is very mental, and once you
are upon the board in competition and the nervousness
sets in, you need to be able to execute your dives without
letting the pressures of competition get in the way."
Due to the cancellation of the Stanford Invite,
scheduled for late November, today's meet is the only
one before the start of the regular dual meet season in
January. The divers, however, are ready to take on the
c hallenges that await them after the winter holidays.
"We are really looking forward to stepping it up
and staying head-to-head with our competition this
year," Olmstead said. "Diving-wise, our region is pret
ty competitive. I lopefully, by the end of the season we
will be ahead of the rest of the pack."

Gavin Olmstead and sophomores Jeff
Dnrbin and Adam Peterson, looks to
make a big name for itself on the nation
al diving scene.
"Technically, we area part of the swim
ming team, but our training programs are
completely separate," Olmstead said. "We
definitely are not swimmers. Sometimes
people ask me if I swim laps in between

dives, and I have to tell them that I don't.
Though we compete together in many of
the meets, the swimming and diving teams
each have their own identities."
The Cardinal trifecta has a shot at
scoring at this spring's NCAA Champi
onships, an accomplishment that the div
ing program has not managed since
1996. Though Peterson qualified (or the
NCAA meet in 2002, lit- did not score.
At last year's NCAA Championships,
Stanford narrowly fell to Texas, whose
divers scored 150 points to give them the crucial edge
against the Cardinal. However, several standout
divers from Texas, including an Olympian, graduat
ed in 2002, leaving more than enough room for Stan
lord divers to step in and fill the void.
"This is by far the most unified team we've ever
had," Durbin said. "Diving is such an individual sport,
and it's difficult to get all the guys to really come to
gether as a team. I think that this unity will definitely
help us in competition."
According to Stanford's veteran diving coach Rick
Schavone, the dynamic between the three athletes is
unlike any he's seen in recent years. ()lmstead did not
compete last year in order to focus on his academic
studies, which allected the Cardinal both in practice
and in competition. With Olmstead back in training,
though, Schavone sees victory on the horizon.
"Wealmost lost the whole team whenCavin left last
year," Schavone said. "His personality and his atti
tude are the c enter of the entire diving program. The
three divers are already ahead of target. They are
phenomenal in the weight room and at the pool, and
I am very excited to see what they can do."
Olmstead, Durbin and Peterson will have their first
opportunity to test the waters as they head into two
days of competition beginning today at the Trojan In
vite hosted by Southern California.
"It's still a little early in the year to be concerned
with results," Olmstead said. "Our biggest diving ri
vals are Arizona and Arizona State, and they are not
going to be at the invite. We won't compete against
them until later on in the season. We just want to go
into the meet and be competitive and test our tech
nique. We will have plenty of time to worry about
points later on in the season."
Up to this point, the clivers have focused mainly on
perfecting the basic mechanics of their dives, flic 1
team rounds out its training program with two days of
weights per week, stretching and trampoline work.
"It's really important for us to get the basic mechanic s
clown and to build muscle memory early in the season,"
Peterson said. "This spoil is very mental, and once you
are upon the board in competition and the nervousness
sets in, you need to be able to execute your dives without
letting the pressures of competition get in the way."
Due to the cancellation of the Stanford Invite,
scheduled for late November, today's meet is the only
one before the start of the regular dual meet season in
January. The divers, however, are ready to take on the
c hallenges that await them after the winter holidays.
"We are really looking forward to stepping it up
and staying head-to-head with our competition this
year," Olmstead said. "Diving-wise, our region is pret
ty competitive. I lopefully, by the end of the season we
will be ahead of the rest of the pack."
