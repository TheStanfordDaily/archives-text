# Loving losers has its rewards
## 
### 
At a loss for costume ideas just hours before
heading to the Castro on 11 alio ween night,
I thought about putting a paper bag over
my head and carrying around a "Go Ben
gals" sign.

Besides the perfectly appropriate
orange and black color scheme, the
idea would have made fora scary, if
not scandalous sight, but an ad
mirable one nonetheless.
Admirable in the fact that while
no professional team rivals the futili
ty of the 1-7 Bengals — even after
their shellacking of the Texans last
Sunday — no fan rivals the resolve of

a true Bengals supporter.
As a fan of the Redskins, I've got a special place in
my sports-loving heart for Bengals fans, as I feel their
pain and, I love their loyalty.
Remaining loyal to a loser is no easy task, whether
you're coughing up money to attend a game or en
during the opportunity costs of studying or sleeping
to watch on television.
Sometimes it helps to identify with other loser
rooters and be reminded that there are other people
like you out there. And sometimes, you just have to
laugh.
To that end, I received an advertisement for Gold
en State " They Might Be" Warriors season tickets in
the mail a few weeks ago.
"The most affordable lower bowl seat in the NBA!"
it read. "Young, energetic players all fired up." A Wiz
ards fan myself , I know that calling a team young and
energetic is like a girl calling a guy "nice." Not good.
Listed under the "excellent season ticket holder
benefits" are the words "playoff priority." Hold up!

priority. Seats so close you can see
the numbers on the ping-pong
balls! We're tanking this season for
a crack at Leßron James, so come
on out and celebrate with us. Bring
the kids. Bring a book.
The advertisement does bring
up a key element in rooting for
your dreadful team: optimism. At
the beginning of every season,
every team is tied for first place,
which, ignoring the fact that by the

same logic your team is also tied for
last place, means you should buy
into the exaggerated hope that the
early season provides.
While the extent of my interest
in the Golden State Warriors is a
few clicks of the refresh button on
NBA.com's scoreboard to see il
Gilbert Arenas has scored my fan
tasy team any points, 10,000-plus
pay to see them play at home, and
I'd venture to say that a fair num
ber of them expect to put their
playoff priority to good use.
There really needs to be sup
port groups for fans of dreadful
teams. Hello, my name is Scott
Allen, and I'm a Baltimore Orioles
fan.

But before I go off on a baseball
tangent, let me get to college
sports, something we can all relate
to. For every student-athlete on the
Farm, there are several student
fans with, as usual, a lot to cheer
about this fall.
From cross country to soccer,
success surrounds us, with one of
the few exceptions being on the
football field.
1 don't mean to stipulate that the
Cardinal is in any way comparable
to the Bungles, but the simple truth
is that it's been a painful season to be
a fan of the Stanford football team.
However, it's seasons like these
that separate the true fans from the
front-runners, the loyalists from

the band wagoners and the
diehards from the fair-weatherers.
There seems to be a lot of apa
thy among Cardinal football fans
and a lot of empty seats in the stu
dent section at Stanford Stadium
as a result .
(ii anted, t he team is 2-6, but are
we so desensitized to winning that
we can't stick with the team
through thick and thin? Remain
ing a loyal fan during seasons like
this is what makes subsequent suc
cessful ones all the more special.
Rooting fora winner is always
nice, but rooting fora winner that
you once rooted for as a loser is di
vine.
Alas, I 'm not trying to judge you

as a fan. You can go on being a
front-runner, tune out when the
going gets tough and judge your
self. '
But if you're not too hung over
from celebrating a couple of soccer
wins or the end of midterms on Fri
day night, 1 hope to see you at Stan
ford Stadium Saturday afternoon.
And Bengals fans, 1 hope you've
ordered Super Bowl tickets for
next year. They'll be gone faster
than you can say Corey Dill-one
man team.

be at even men's basketball game this
year to prove the same point. E-mail him
