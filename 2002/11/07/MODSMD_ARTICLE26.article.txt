# Loving losers has its rewards
## 
### 
At a loss for costume ideas just hours before
heading to the Castro on 11 alio ween night,
I thought about putting a paper bag over
my head and carrying around a "Go Ben
gals" sign.

Besides the perfectly appropriate
orange and black color scheme, the
idea would have made fora scary, if
not scandalous sight, but an ad
mirable one nonetheless.
Admirable in the fact that while
no professional team rivals the futili
ty of the 1-7 Bengals — even after
their shellacking of the Texans last
Sunday — no fan rivals the resolve of

a true Bengals supporter.
As a fan of the Redskins, I've got a special place in
my sports-loving heart for Bengals fans, as I feel their
pain and, I love their loyalty.
Remaining loyal to a loser is no easy task, whether
you're coughing up money to attend a game or en
during the opportunity costs of studying or sleeping
to watch on television.
Sometimes it helps to identify with other loser
rooters and be reminded that there are other people
like you out there. And sometimes, you just have to
laugh.
To that end, I received an advertisement for Gold
en State " They Might Be" Warriors season tickets in
the mail a few weeks ago.
"The most affordable lower bowl seat in the NBA!"
it read. "Young, energetic players all fired up." A Wiz
ards fan myself , I know that calling a team young and
energetic is like a girl calling a guy "nice." Not good.
Listed under the "excellent season ticket holder
benefits" are the words "playoff priority." Hold up!
