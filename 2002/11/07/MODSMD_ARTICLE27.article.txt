### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been a frustrating year for the
Stanford field hockey team, but the squad
will look to pull together what it has left for
its last shot at meeting the lofty goals it set for
coach Sheryl Johnson's last season on the
Farm.

Field Hockey
vs. Davidson, Today, 3:00 p.m.

The Cardinal (8-10, 4-2 Northern Pacif
ic Athletic Conference) has already failed to
realize its dream of a NorPac regular season
title in Johnson's 18th and final season at
Stanford. But as (he NorPac Tournament
kicks off today on Stanford's Artificial Turf
Field, its other goals of reaching a double
digit win total for the season and advancing
to the NCAA tournament remain alive.
"We had a lot of expectations for this sea
son." senior forward Amanda Billinyer said.
"When we looked at our schedule, we
thought we'd be killing teams, [but we've]
have actually had losses against teams that

we thought we'd be able to dominate."
The Cardinal has had trouble putting
the ball in the back of the net this year, out
shooting its opponents in every game but
two, but still ending up with a losing record
on the year.
"Finishing became a [problem] because,
as the more games we got close in the score
and the more games we lost, the more our
confidence dropped a little bit," Billmyer
said. "But finishing is something we've
worked very hard on in practice â€” it's a
problem we are very aware of."
Stanford is looking to right the wrongs of
its season with a good showing in the Nor-
Pac playoffs. If it ends up winning the eight
team tournament, the Cardinal will receive
a play-in bid for the NCAA tournament
against the winner of the Patriot League.
Stanford finished the NorPac season in
second place in the West Division, two
games behind California. The Golden
Bears beat the Cardinal twice on last
minute shots by Nora Fedderson, who sin
glehandedly dashed any Cardinal hopes
