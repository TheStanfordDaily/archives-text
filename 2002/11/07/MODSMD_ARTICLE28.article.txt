# Tennis slams into tourney
## Women's tennis team travels to Texas for the ITA National Indoor Tournament 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
History will be on (lie Stanford side of
the court this week at the ITA National In
door Tournament hosted by Southern
Methodist in Dallas. The Cardinal has per
formed extremely well at the tournament
in the past, and nothing indicates that this
year's outcome will be any different.
Representing Stanford in Dallas will be
junior Lauren Barnikow, sophomore Erin
Burdette and freshmen Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu.
Barnes won an automatic singles bid
for reaching the finals of the ITA North
west Regional at Stanford on Oct. 28. The
winner and runner-up from each of the
eight regionals advanced to the singles
championships.
Fourteen at-large bids, including
Barnikow and Liu, comprise the rest of the
32 player field. Burdette is also an alternate
for the singles.
In the first round of singles play today,
Barnes will face third-seeded Agata
Cioroch of Georgia, while Liu will face Ma
rine Piriou of Northwestern. Barnikow will
square off against Kate Pinchbeck of North
Carolina.
The relatively small singles draw em
phasizes the importance of the tournament
as well as the elite makeup of the field.
"The competition will be very stiff since
basically all of the top players are going to
be there," said Stanford coach Lele Forood.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal players are very
optimistic entering their first matches today.
"We have just been training as normal
for the past few weeks," Barnes said. "It was
good to get some match play at the region
al last weekend, and 1 think that has set us
up well for this week."

In doubles competition, Barnikow and
Burdette will team up as the only Cardinal
duo in the draw. They qualified by winning
the doubles competition of the Northwest

Regional.
The Indoors are a very important com
petition, as the NCAA season lurks just
weeks away, as do the preseason rankings.
"It is (lie last tournament of the fall season,
so it's our last chance to improve our rank
ings," Barnes said. "Also, we're trying to get
the team a high preseason ranking. That for
me was the main purpose of the individual
tournaments, to try to help the team."
Although the tournament presents
both a great challenge and opportunity
for her players, Forood has great confi
dence in their tenacity on (lie court, saying
that "we really haven't done anything spe
cial to prepare."
l he team has been practicing hard, as
usual, in an attempt to bring another in
doors championship home to the Farm.
" I bis is an individual tournament, so I
would suspect that everyone on our team
who is competing will be out to win the
event," Forood said.
Winning the event is definitely not far
fetched for the 2002 team under (lie strong
Stanford program.
Stanford players have recently per
formed extremely well at the National In
doors. Last year, 2002 graduates Lauren
Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra won the dou
bles championship, while Kalvaria fought
to the finals of the singles tournament.
l he Cardinal has had a singles finalist
each of the last six years and a doubles
champion four out of the last six years.
However, the past success is not affect
ing a young Stanford team.
"I don't think it affects our expectations
— we expect to play well no matter what."
Barnes said. "But it does give you a strong
sense of pride when you wear the Stan
ford colors. I know that Stanford tennis
has an excellent reputation, and I view
that as something positive, something to
strive to uphold."
Being one of the most represented
schools in the tournament will no doubt aid
the players psychologically.
"It's really nice to have support and, of
course, it's more enjoyable when you can
travel with your friends," Barnes said. "It's
also great for Stanford to have such a
strong showing at the tournament."

As with all preseason tournaments, the
Indoors will provide needed experience
for the upcoming Pacific-10 Conference
season.
Forood stresses the importance of get
ting "everyone wins and feeling good about

not only where they are personally but
where their teammates are. I "his will give
the team a lot of confidence heading in to
the dual matches in January."
" 1 here certainly is no team to beat at this
venue," she added.

Cioroch of Georgia, while Liu will face Ma
rine Piriou of Northwestern. Barnikow will
square off against Kate Pinchbeck of North
Carolina.
The relatively small singles draw em
phasizes the importance of the tournament
as well as the elite makeup of the field.
"The competition will be very stiff since
basically all of the top players are going to
be there," said Stanford coach Lele Forood.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal players are very
optimistic entering their first matches today.
"We have just been training as normal
for the past few weeks," Barnes said. "It was
good to get some match play at the region
al last weekend, and 1 think that has set us
up well for this week."

In doubles competition, Barnikow and
Burdette will team up as the only Cardinal
duo in the draw. They qualified by winning
the doubles competition of the Northwest

Regional.
The Indoors are a very important com
petition, as the NCAA season lurks just
weeks away, as do the preseason rankings.
"It is (lie last tournament of the fall season,
so it's our last chance to improve our rank
ings," Barnes said. "Also, we're trying to get
the team a high preseason ranking. That for
me was the main purpose of the individual
tournaments, to try to help the team."
Although the tournament presents
both a great challenge and opportunity
for her players, Forood has great confi
dence in their tenacity on (lie court, saying
that "we really haven't done anything spe
cial to prepare."
l he team has been practicing hard, as
usual, in an attempt to bring another in
doors championship home to the Farm.
" I bis is an individual tournament, so I
would suspect that everyone on our team
who is competing will be out to win the
event," Forood said.
Winning the event is definitely not far
fetched for the 2002 team under (lie strong
Stanford program.
Stanford players have recently per
formed extremely well at the National In
doors. Last year, 2002 graduates Lauren
Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra won the dou
bles championship, while Kalvaria fought
to the finals of the singles tournament.
l he Cardinal has had a singles finalist
each of the last six years and a doubles
champion four out of the last six years.
However, the past success is not affect
ing a young Stanford team.
"I don't think it affects our expectations
— we expect to play well no matter what."
Barnes said. "But it does give you a strong
sense of pride when you wear the Stan
ford colors. I know that Stanford tennis
has an excellent reputation, and I view
that as something positive, something to
strive to uphold."
Being one of the most represented
schools in the tournament will no doubt aid
the players psychologically.
"It's really nice to have support and, of
course, it's more enjoyable when you can
travel with your friends," Barnes said. "It's
also great for Stanford to have such a
strong showing at the tournament."

As with all preseason tournaments, the
Indoors will provide needed experience
for the upcoming Pacific-10 Conference
season.
Forood stresses the importance of get
ting "everyone wins and feeling good about

not only where they are personally but
where their teammates are. I "his will give
the team a lot of confidence heading in to
the dual matches in January."
" 1 here certainly is no team to beat at this
venue," she added.
