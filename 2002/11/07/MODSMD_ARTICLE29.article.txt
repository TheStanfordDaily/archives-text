# Crew goes to the Head of the Lake

### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
()n an early Tuesday morning
last week, the Stanford women's
crew team launched a fleet of
small boats. As the sun touched
the tops of office buildings that
line Redwood Shores, four pairs
and three fours headed out into
the bay. Women's head coach
Aimee Baker followed behind iu
a launch.

Crew
at the Head of the Lake, Saturday.

"I'm looking at their length
through the water, trying to
make ;i decision about the Head
of the Lake," Baker said as she
watched the rowers.
I his Saturday, the women will
head to other waters for the
I lead of the Lake regatta in Seat
tle. I leld each November and in
it's 21st year, the regatta is spon
sored by the Lake Washington
Rowing Club and the University
of Washington.
Washington will be on its
home course, an edge that has
proven useful in the past. The
Washington women have placed
first among collegiate boats the
past two years. Last year, the

I luskies beat the (Cardinal A boat
by four seconds in the women's
open eight race.
Both Stanford boats will be in
a good position to chase Wash
ington this year. In the women's
junior varsity eight race, the
Stanford B boat will start in liltli
position, while, in the open eight
.Stanford A will start second, be
hind Washington.
"It's their home course, so they
get to row it everyday, but they're
a very fast crew," Baker said.
"They rarely come iu second."
Baker said that she is also in
terested in how Stanford will
fare against other Pacific-10
Conference competition. The
Cardinal will face many of its
West Coast rivals, including
Oregon State and UC-San
Diego, this Saturday.
"Everybody from the Pac-1() is
competitive," Baker said. "Any of
those top six crews that are start
ing are pretty fast."
The 1 lead of the Lake course
is a winding 4.8 kilometers,
roughly miles. Starting at the
north end of Lake Union, the
race begins with a right bend
under two bridges. The course
then continues, bending slightly
left, through Portage Bay and
the Montlake Cut before ending

in Union Bay.
Potentially the most difficult
area of the race is in Union Bay.
Fach coxswain must steer
around a 180-degree turn
marked by six buoys before row
ers can power clown a short
straightaway to the finish, which
is in front of the Washington
be jathouse.
l ricky maneuvers like the
Union Bay turn mean that only
experienced rowers and
coxswain are permitted on the
course. "It's a big, long turn, not
a hairpin turn," Baker said.
Baker said that both of Stan
ford's coxswain have steered the
course before and that she
doesn't expect the turn to be a
problem. She added that senior
cox Wendy Hoeveler even made
up time on the turn last year.
"Both of them have nailed it,"
Baker said.
Although the women will row
at Bait Island Fall Regatta in San
Mateo next week, Baker hopes
that the Head of the Lake will
help set the tone for the sprint
racing season in the spring.
"It would be nice to go up and
have a good showing with all the
Pac-10 school as it's the last com
petitive focus for us in the fall,"
she said.
