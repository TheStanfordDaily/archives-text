# Stanford announces new early admissions policy
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just hours after a similar statement by Yale
University, President John Hennessy announced
yesterday that Stanford's Office of Undergradu
ate Admission will no longer offer its binding
early decision option to applicants. Instead, the
University will offer an early admittance program
that does not require accepted students to ma
triculate.
"This new policy offers those who have set
their hearts on attending Stanford the opportu
nity to apply early in their senior year without the
additional pressure of having to commit before
they are ready," Hennessy said.
According to Marcela Muniz, assistant dean of
undergraduate admission, the change in policy
will not be implemented until next year's admis
sion cycle for the Class of2ooB.
Christina Wire, associate dean of undergrad

uate admission, explained that the new policy
proposed by Stanford is a unique blend of tradi
tional early action and early decision options of
fered by other colleges.
"Our new policy is certainly closer to early ac
tion than it is to early decision," Wire said. "How
ever, we have not thought of a specific name for it
yet."
According to Wire, despite the fact that stu
dents are not required to attend Stanford if ac
cepted, the new policy does not allow for early ap
plicants to file early applications at other colleges.
Robin Mamlet, dean of admission and finan
cial aid, explained why this restriction was put in
place.
"What we are not trying to do is set up an ear
lier deadline for anyone who feels they want to
use it," Mamlet said. "We are trying to preserve
the first-choice aspect, but do it in a way that does
not limit students."
Mamlet said that her office had been contem

plating changing the early application policy
since last fall.
"[The National Association for College Admis
sion Counseling] sometime last winter made the
ruling that if [a student] was going to apply early
decision, [he / she] could still apply early action to
as many colleges as [he / she] wanted," Mamlet
said. "We had been uncomfortable since that de
cision — we had not felt good about our [previ
ous] program because it encouraged students to


LUIS FELIPE ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
use early decision as a strategy
rather than a declaration of first
choice.
"We have been thinking very
carefully about what we ought to
do," she continued. "I really believe
we have hit on the right thing."
She explained that selecting
Stanford as a first choice favorably
affects an applicant's admission
chances.
"We don't use a formula," Mam
let said. "But for students who are
strong candidates and want to
specifically be at Stanford versus an
other college is something that has
weighed into our decision."
Hennessy's notification followed
a similar announcement issued ear
lier yesterday by Yale University,
which stated that Yale also plans to
abandon its early decision program.

"I heard a rumor that [Yale was]
going to change from early decision
to early action, but I did not know it
was going to be today," Mamlet said.
She explained that Stanford an
nounced its change in policy today
due to the Yale release, despite not
having finalized the policy change
with NACAC.
"Had we not been faced with so
many calls from the national press,
we would have been in touch with
[NACAC]] before coming out with
this kind of announcement," Mam
let said.
According to its current guide
lines, NACAC does not allow for the
type of early admission program
proposed by Stanford and Yale.
"They could kick us out of the na
tional association — my hope is that
will not happen," Mamlet said.
"Rather, [what I hope] this will do is
prompt a discussion among the as
sociation's leaders about why we are
making this choice. Ultimately, I
hope they will see we are making

this choice because it is best for stu
dents, and [the association] will
change [its] policy."
According to Mamlet, the Office
of Undergraduate Admission is un
sure as of now how the change in
policy will affect admission figures
for next year's application pool.
"I don't know yet how we will
compute the impact on our yield —
we have plenty of time to think that
through," she said.
"I think that this certainly may
enhance our ability to enroll a di
verse class," Mamlet continued. "It
certainly will not hinder it. Early ac
tion gives students on financial aid
more flexibility — they can com
pare financial aid packages."
Hennessy concurred with Mam
let's sentiments regarding the
prospects of the new early admis
sion policy.
"We believe this is the right thing
to do for Stanford and for our
prospective students," Hennessy
said.

policy will affect admission figures
for next year's application pool.
"I don't know yet how we will
compute the impact on our yield —
we have plenty of time to think that
through," she said.
"I think that this certainly may
enhance our ability to enroll a di
verse class," Mamlet continued. "It
certainly will not hinder it. Early ac
tion gives students on financial aid
more flexibility — they can com
pare financial aid packages."
Hennessy concurred with Mam
let's sentiments regarding the
prospects of the new early admis
sion policy.
"We believe this is the right thing
to do for Stanford and for our
prospective students," Hennessy
said.
Just hours after a similar statement by Yale
University, President John Hennessy announced
yesterday that Stanford's Office of Undergradu
ate Admission will no longer offer its binding
early decision option to applicants. Instead, the
University will offer an early admittance program
that does not require accepted students to ma
triculate.
"This new policy offers those who have set
their hearts on attending Stanford the opportu
nity to apply early in their senior year without the
additional pressure of having to commit before
they are ready," Hennessy said.
According to Marcela Muniz, assistant dean of
undergraduate admission, the change in policy
will not be implemented until next year's admis
sion cycle for the Class of2ooB.
Christina Wire, associate dean of undergrad

uate admission, explained that the new policy
proposed by Stanford is a unique blend of tradi
tional early action and early decision options of
fered by other colleges.
"Our new policy is certainly closer to early ac
tion than it is to early decision," Wire said. "How
ever, we have not thought of a specific name for it
yet."
According to Wire, despite the fact that stu
dents are not required to attend Stanford if ac
cepted, the new policy does not allow for early ap
plicants to file early applications at other colleges.
Robin Mamlet, dean of admission and finan
cial aid, explained why this restriction was put in
place.
"What we are not trying to do is set up an ear
lier deadline for anyone who feels they want to
use it," Mamlet said. "We are trying to preserve
the first-choice aspect, but do it in a way that does
not limit students."
Mamlet said that her office had been contem

plating changing the early application policy
since last fall.
"[The National Association for College Admis
sion Counseling] sometime last winter made the
ruling that if [a student] was going to apply early
decision, [he / she] could still apply early action to
as many colleges as [he / she] wanted," Mamlet
said. "We had been uncomfortable since that de
cision — we had not felt good about our [previ
ous] program because it encouraged students to

use early decision as a strategy
rather than a declaration of first
choice.
"We have been thinking very
carefully about what we ought to
do," she continued. "I really believe
we have hit on the right thing."
She explained that selecting
Stanford as a first choice favorably
affects an applicant's admission
chances.
"We don't use a formula," Mam
let said. "But for students who are
strong candidates and want to
specifically be at Stanford versus an
other college is something that has
weighed into our decision."
Hennessy's notification followed
a similar announcement issued ear
lier yesterday by Yale University,
which stated that Yale also plans to
abandon its early decision program.

"I heard a rumor that [Yale was]
going to change from early decision
to early action, but I did not know it
was going to be today," Mamlet said.
She explained that Stanford an
nounced its change in policy today
due to the Yale release, despite not
having finalized the policy change
with NACAC.
"Had we not been faced with so
many calls from the national press,
we would have been in touch with
[NACAC]] before coming out with
this kind of announcement," Mam
let said.
According to its current guide
lines, NACAC does not allow for the
type of early admission program
proposed by Stanford and Yale.
"They could kick us out of the na
tional association — my hope is that
will not happen," Mamlet said.
"Rather, [what I hope] this will do is
prompt a discussion among the as
sociation's leaders about why we are
making this choice. Ultimately, I
hope they will see we are making

this choice because it is best for stu
dents, and [the association] will
change [its] policy."
According to Mamlet, the Office
of Undergraduate Admission is un
sure as of now how the change in
policy will affect admission figures
for next year's application pool.
"I don't know yet how we will
compute the impact on our yield —
we have plenty of time to think that
through," she said.
"I think that this certainly may
enhance our ability to enroll a di
verse class," Mamlet continued. "It
certainly will not hinder it. Early ac
