# Stanford announces new early admissions policy
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Just hours after a similar statement by Yale
University, President John Hennessy announced
yesterday that Stanford's Office of Undergradu
ate Admission will no longer offer its binding
early decision option to applicants. Instead, the
University will offer an early admittance program
that does not require accepted students to ma
triculate.
"This new policy offers those who have set
their hearts on attending Stanford the opportu
nity to apply early in their senior year without the
additional pressure of having to commit before
they are ready," Hennessy said.
According to Marcela Muniz, assistant dean of
undergraduate admission, the change in policy
will not be implemented until next year's admis
sion cycle for the Class of2ooB.
Christina Wire, associate dean of undergrad

proposed by Stanford is a unique blend of tradi

fered by other colleges.
"Our new policy is certainly closer to early ac

ever, we have not thought of a specific name for it
yet."
According to Wire, despite the fact that stu
dents are not required to attend Stanford if ac
cepted, the new policy does not allow for early ap
plicants to file early applications at other colleges.
Robin Mamlet, dean of admission and finan
cial aid, explained why this restriction was put in
place.
"What we are not trying to do is set up an ear
lier deadline for anyone who feels they want to
use it," Mamlet said. "We are trying to preserve
the first-choice aspect, but do it in a way that does
not limit students."
Mamlet said that her office had been contem

plating changing the early application policy
since last fall.
"[The National Association for College Admis
sion Counseling] sometime last winter made the
ruling that if [a student] was going to apply early
decision, [he / she] could still apply early action to
as many colleges as [he / she] wanted," Mamlet
said. "We had been uncomfortable since that de
cision â€” we had not felt good about our [previ
ous] program because it encouraged students to
