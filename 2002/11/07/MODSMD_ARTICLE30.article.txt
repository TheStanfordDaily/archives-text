# Men's swimming to face San Francisco State
## 
### 
The Cardinal men's swimming team will get its
first taste of dual meet competition today as it takes
on San Francisc o State. The non-conference meet
begins at 3:30 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
Two weeks ago, Stanford went into the Pacific
Invite looking to work on technique and to
gauge its athletes' strengths and weaknesses in
the water. The swimmers enter this afternoon's
competition with a similar focus.
The meet against SFSU will be the Cardinal's
first experience with the collegiate dual meet for
mat this season. The freshman swimmers, espe
cially, will have the opportunity to swim a variety
of events.
" This is really just a fun meet to get an idea of
what it feels like to race and to see where we are
in our training," junior Nic k Bolt said. "We are
mainly entering the freshmen in the events to
give them a little more experience in competi
tion. Most of the older swimmers usually sit this
meet out."
