### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Hospital management announced yester
day afternoon that they have made their final contract
offer to union workers at the hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
SEIU Local 715 members will vote on the contract
proposal tomorrow.
The previous contract ended on Monday, as did ne
gotiations fora new contract. Union workers told man
agement last Friday that they will hold a one-day strike if
a new contract cannot be agreed upon.
A hospital press release yesterday suited that "die pro
posal is the 'last, best and final offer' from the hospitals."
The release stated that hospital management had of
fered union negotiators a new contract calling fora pay
raise of 21 percent on average over the next three years,
fhe increase would include a salary step system that
would take into account seniority and cost-of-living in
creases.
The offer also features a propos
al fora joint management and labor
committee to give employees a voice
on staffing and patient care, accord
ing to the press release.
The hospitals said the offer, if ac
cepted, would make service em
ployees among the best compensat
ed in the area.
"We hope that our valued SElU
represented workers vote on Friday
to accept our generous proposal,"
said Maria La Ganga, spokesperson
for the hospitals.
The offer has been sent by mail to
employees' homes.
"Members are already respond
ing," said Ana Esquivel, a nursing
assistant and chief union steward at
the Children's Hospital. "[The
offer] is not acceptable."
In response to the pay increase
system, Esquivel said, "Manage
ment wants to keep workers paid
two to three dollars less per hour
than other area hospitals. They
have proposed a step system that

takes 15 years to get from bottom to
top. At other hospitals, it takes three
and-a-half to seven years.
In addition, she said, "Manage
ment is refusing to offer any protec
tion to long-term workers against
layoffs and contracting out of jobs to
low-wage, for-profit corporations."
Esquivel also voiced concerns
with the proposed joint committee.
"What we need is a system with a
third party, neutral arbitrator that
will force both sides to come to an
agreement. Otherwise, manage

ment will always make the final de
cision."
Esquivel added, "We want work
ers to not have to pay for their
spouse's health care, and smaller
costs, like parking at work."
La Ganga said that, concerning
health care issues, "[the hospitals]
are one of the few employers of
any sort in this region to [already]
provide our employees with free
health and dental insurance for
themselves and their dependent
children."
