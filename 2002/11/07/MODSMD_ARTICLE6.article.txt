# Students' Lockdown supports social justice
## 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sitting in an 8-by-10-foot
square with a sign asking, "Who
wants a tall frosty glass of dis
sent?", senior Brent Schulkin
protested the incarceration of
Mumia Abu-Jamal as part of yes
terday's 24-hour "Lockdown."
Students sitting in simulated
prison cells expressed their dis
satisfaction with various issues
ranging from Abu-Jamal's impris
onment to education about sexu
al health, as they sat in individual
cells for up to 24 hours.

"A lot of the progressive activi
ty here has left me somewhat un
fulfilled, and I always thought
things could be more fun,"
Schulkin said. "My idea for Lock
down grew out of those dissatis
factions, and I see it as a simple,
creative and effective way for all
the wandering progressiveness
on this campus to finally mani
fest."

Schulkin and his organization MA

Senior Brent Schulkin, the organizer of yesterday's "Lockdown" in White
Plaza, protested the incarceration of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
Stanford Team Instigating
Change — was a forum for people
to protest, express and meditate
about various issues that concern
them.
"For me personally, it's an
event for Mumia," said Schulkin,
surrounded by Abu-Jamal litera
ture and wearing a gray prison
esque jumpsuit with an orange
tag marking him prisoner num
ber 24601. "But this event is by no
means an event for Mumia, be
cause it is an event for everyone's
individual passions and ideas."
Abu-Jamal has been on death
row since 1982 and claims that he
was wrongfully sentenced for the
shooting of a police officer. His
case is currently on appeal before
the Federal District Court of
Philadelphia.
While several people rallied
against issues concerning the
prison structure, others used the
8-by- 10-foot fake prison cell as a
metaphor for other components
in life that imprison or oppress
them.
"We make ourselves prisoners
of our fears and let them prevent
us from having open and honest
communication with others," said
sophomore Suzanne Wallace.
Since Wallace's platform is about
communication, she felt it was im
perative that she took part in
Lockdown in hopes that she
would give people the courage to
say what they want to say.
For freshman passerby Paul
Wesson, Wallace's call to open up
communication was striking.
"Her cell grabbed me the
most," Wesson said. "It is an in

spiration for me to try not to filter
things out in my mind before I say
them. Saying what's on your
mind is difficult in practice, but
this is a sign to go forth and give it
a shot."
The 24-hour sit served not
only as a time to educate and dis
cuss, but also to contemplate.
"My purpose is more personal
than educational," said Liam
Brady, a fifth-year coterm who
believes the death penalty should
be abolished. "1 am challenging
myself to take something 1 am
angry about and injecting it into
all of my thoughts for 24 hours."
For junior Laura Page, Lock
down, along with being a protest
against the death penalty and the
injustice of the Abu-Jamal trial,
served as an experiment to free
herself from her daily time com
mitments.
"This is an experiment for me
to see what it would be like to shed
my daily worries and forget about
where 1 have to be every hour of
every day," said Page, who is used
to being out of her room from 10
a.m. to 10 p.m. "If I don't break
the routine now, life will not
change and I will always be run
ning around."
For freshman Lisa Hika, it was
a relief to see the rally.
"It's exciting to see a diverse
range of issues out," she said. "It
helps dispel the myth of political
apathy on campus."
Schulkin, who intended to stay
in his duct-tape square from 9
a.m. yesterday to 9 a.m. today,
hopes he helped spread support
for Abu-Jamal's cause and the
love of activism.
"I want more people to have
the spirit of activism in their
heart," he said. "I want that part
in people to be invigorated."
