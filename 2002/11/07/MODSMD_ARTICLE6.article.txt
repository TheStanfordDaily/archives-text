# Students' Lockdown supports social justice

### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sitting in an 8-by-10-foot
square with a sign asking, "Who
wants a tall frosty glass of dis
sent?", senior Brent Schulkin
protested the incarceration of
Mumia Abu-Jamal as part of yes
terday's 24-hour "Lockdown."
Students sitting in simulated
prison cells expressed their dis
satisfaction with various issues
ranging from Abu-Jamal's impris
onment to education about sexu
al health, as they sat in individual
cells for up to 24 hours.

"A lot of the progressive activi
ty here has left me somewhat un
fulfilled, and I always thought
things could be more fun,"
Schulkin said. "My idea for Lock
down grew out of those dissatis
factions, and I see it as a simple,
creative and effective way for all
the wandering progressiveness
on this campus to finally mani
fest."
The Lockdown, organized by
Schulkin and his organization MA
JESTIC â€” which stands for
Mumia Abu-Jamal's Emancipative
