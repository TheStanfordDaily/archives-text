on seniors'plans after graduation.

Interest in school teaching as a career ap
peal's to be on the ii.se at Stanford, as evi
denced by an increase in applications for
coterminal degrees in the Stanford Teach

ing Education Program (STEP), greater par
ticipation at the Bing Nursery School and a
moderate increase in applications to master's
programs in the School of Education.
"There is a slight increase from outside
of Stanford but a significant increase
among Stanford undergrads in pursuing
teaching careers," said STEP Program Di
rector Rachel Lotan.
The number of Stanford undergradu
ates who applied to participate in the

STEP coterminal teaching program has
risen by about 400 percent — from 11 last
year to 45 this year — according to Fred
Stout, the program's coordinator.
Students accepted into the coterminal
program receive a bachelor's degree in
one of Stanford's undergraduate depart
ments, a master's degree in education
through STEP and a State of California
secondary teaching credential, which allows
them to teach middle school or high school.
The number of recent Stanford gradu
ates working at the Bing Nursery School is
also increasing and is currently at an all-time
high, according to Director Jeanne Leper. In
previous years, the Bing Nursery Schw)l has
only been able to hire one to three recent
Stanford graduates. This year, five gradu
ates of the undergraduate class of '01 are
teaching at the nursery school.
The Stanford School of Education has ob
served a moderate increase of about 10 per
cent in the number of applicants to their mas
ter's programs this year, receiving 422 appli
cations as compared to 376 received last year.
This increased interest in teaching can be
attributed to a number of factors.
A vast majority of students and faculty
point to the current downturn in the econo
my, particularly in the decreased availability
of high-tech jobs in t he Silicon Valley area.
"It's very hard to get a secure job right out
of college in the high-tech field, whereas
teaching is very stable ... and California al
ways needs more teachers," said junior
Charlotte Cheng, who is considering apply
ing to the coterminal STEP program.
"The economy pushed those who were
on the line," said Angelica Amador '01, a
teacher at the Bing Nursery School. Amador
recalls classmates who attended career fairs
at which many firms were not looking to hire
but school districts were adamantly seeking
to hire teachers.
For example, senior Ryan Atkins said that
when he told school districts at a career fair
that he was in STEP, "they basically offered

me a job on the spot."
The increase, however, is not entirely at
tributable to the recent economic downturn.
"I think it's more than that; it has some
thing to do with idealism — being a teacher
is an act of social activism," Stout said.
Many students shared Stout's opinion and
indicated that social activism through educa
tion reform is behind their interest in teaching.
For example, coterminal STEP student
Crystal Maglio, who plans to work in inner
city school districts, sees teaching as "an op
portunity to work with children who face un
equal treatment."
Education School Dean Deborah Stipeck
said that the Sept. 11 attacks might have had
a subconscious impact in that "it may have
piqued concerns about democratic society
and how you obtain that. .. but not many
people would explicitly trace its effect to an
increase in teaching."
The increased visibility of teaching pro
grams on campus might also have been a fac
tor in the growth of interest in teaching at
Stanford. Lotan said that STEP has made
great efforts to recruit students to the pro
gram. Also, the School of Education was
ranked number one among education
schools in U.S. News and World Report's
2003 Graduate School rankings.
In concert with the increased interest in
teaching, the School of Education is offering
two new courses for undergraduates, Educa
tion 101 and an Undergraduate Practicum.
Also, the S TEP program is expanding to
offer a program in elementary education
which will accommodate 20 students.
"I hope that undergrads will take advan
tage of having the nation's top school of edu
cation on their campus," Stipeck said. "1
hope that those who are interested will come
join us and enroll fora class and get in
volved."

Stout, the program's coordinator.
Students accepted into the coterminal
program receive a bachelor's degree in
one of Stanford's undergraduate depart
ments, a master's degree in education
through STEP and a State of California
secondary teaching credential, which allows
them to teach middle school or high school.
The number of recent Stanford gradu
ates working at the Bing Nursery School is
also increasing and is currently at an all-time
high, according to Director Jeanne Leper. In
previous years, the Bing Nursery Schw)l has
only been able to hire one to three recent
Stanford graduates. This year, five gradu
ates of the undergraduate class of '01 are
teaching at the nursery school.
The Stanford School of Education has ob
served a moderate increase of about 10 per
cent in the number of applicants to their mas
ter's programs this year, receiving 422 appli
cations as compared to 376 received last year.
This increased interest in teaching can be
attributed to a number of factors.
A vast majority of students and faculty
point to the current downturn in the econo
my, particularly in the decreased availability
of high-tech jobs in t he Silicon Valley area.
"It's very hard to get a secure job right out
of college in the high-tech field, whereas
teaching is very stable ... and California al
ways needs more teachers," said junior
Charlotte Cheng, who is considering apply
ing to the coterminal STEP program.
"The economy pushed those who were
on the line," said Angelica Amador '01, a
teacher at the Bing Nursery School. Amador
recalls classmates who attended career fairs
at which many firms were not looking to hire
but school districts were adamantly seeking
to hire teachers.
For example, senior Ryan Atkins said that
when he told school districts at a career fair
that he was in STEP, "they basically offered

me a job on the spot."
The increase, however, is not entirely at
tributable to the recent economic downturn.
"I think it's more than that; it has some
thing to do with idealism — being a teacher
is an act of social activism," Stout said.
Many students shared Stout's opinion and
indicated that social activism through educa
tion reform is behind their interest in teaching.
For example, coterminal STEP student
Crystal Maglio, who plans to work in inner
city school districts, sees teaching as "an op
portunity to work with children who face un
equal treatment."
Education School Dean Deborah Stipeck
said that the Sept. 11 attacks might have had
a subconscious impact in that "it may have
piqued concerns about democratic society
and how you obtain that. .. but not many
people would explicitly trace its effect to an
increase in teaching."
The increased visibility of teaching pro
grams on campus might also have been a fac
tor in the growth of interest in teaching at
Stanford. Lotan said that STEP has made
great efforts to recruit students to the pro
gram. Also, the School of Education was
ranked number one among education
schools in U.S. News and World Report's
2003 Graduate School rankings.
In concert with the increased interest in
teaching, the School of Education is offering
two new courses for undergraduates, Educa
tion 101 and an Undergraduate Practicum.
Also, the S TEP program is expanding to
offer a program in elementary education
which will accommodate 20 students.
"I hope that undergrads will take advan
tage of having the nation's top school of edu
cation on their campus," Stipeck said. "1
hope that those who are interested will come
join us and enroll fora class and get in
volved."
