### ANN CHIN 
A crowd of students assembled to hear
opposing views on the controversial issue
of U.S. foreign policy in Iraq at Tuesday
night's inaugural student-organized
"Bursting the Bubble" panel in Tresid
der Union.
The panelists were Political Science
Prof. David Abernethy, Computer Sci
ence Prof. Eric Roberts and Abraham So
faer, senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and former legal adviser to the U.S.
Department of State.
Roberts, head of Stanford Faculty
Against the War, said that the situation in
Iraq does not call for any kind of drastic
U.S. action.
"We cannot proceed in this mad dash
towards unilateralism that has been such
a large part of the Bush administration,"

he said. "This particular war has unusu
ally dangerous consequences. I worry
that the case has not been made that the
danger to the U.S. is so great as to require
unilateral action."
A preemptive attack would build Iraqi
support for terrorist action, Roberts sug
gested. Gaining multilateral support,
however, would increase international
pressure on Iraq and reduce the percep
tion of unjustified American aggression.
Sofaer argued that the U.S. govern
ment would not be acting alone in wag
ing war on Iraq.
"Before anyone accuses the U.S. of
acting unilaterally, you must see that we
have the backing of Congress and the
U.N. Security Council,"he said.
Though the U.N. Charter states that
the only appropriate time to use force is
when a nation's territory is attacked, the

rule has "never withstood experience,"
Sofaer said, advocating force as the only
means of self-defense.
"We are learning that passivity in the
face of violence simply doesn't work," he
said. "We are unable to give people in
America the level of security they [need].
"[ln the past], we could feel reasonably
confident that the preparations we took
could deter other states from acting
against us. [But] the problem govern
ments face in protecting their people has
increased. There are certain types of
criminal activities that are so widespread
that using criminal prosecution is ineffec
tive."
Abernethy expressed a more moder
ate view on the potential war.
