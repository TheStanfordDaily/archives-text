# Panel offers views on U.S. policy in Iraq
## 
### ANN CHIN 
A crowd of students assembled to hear
opposing views on the controversial issue
of U.S. foreign policy in Iraq at Tuesday
night's inaugural student-organized
"Bursting the Bubble" panel in Tresid
der Union.
The panelists were Political Science
Prof. David Abernethy, Computer Sci
ence Prof. Eric Roberts and Abraham So
faer, senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and former legal adviser to the U.S.
Department of State.
Roberts, head of Stanford Faculty
Against the War, said that the situation in
Iraq does not call for any kind of drastic
U.S. action.
"We cannot proceed in this mad dash
towards unilateralism that has been such
a large part of the Bush administration,"

he said. "This particular war has unusu
ally dangerous consequences. I worry
that the case has not been made that the
danger to the U.S. is so great as to require
unilateral action."
A preemptive attack would build Iraqi
support for terrorist action, Roberts sug
gested. Gaining multilateral support,
however, would increase international
pressure on Iraq and reduce the percep
tion of unjustified American aggression.
Sofaer argued that the U.S. govern
ment would not be acting alone in wag
ing war on Iraq.
"Before anyone accuses the U.S. of
acting unilaterally, you must see that we
have the backing of Congress and the
U.N. Security Council,"he said.
Though the U.N. Charter states that
the only appropriate time to use force is
when a nation's territory is attacked, the

rule has "never withstood experience,"
Sofaer said, advocating force as the only
means of self-defense.
"We are learning that passivity in the
face of violence simply doesn't work," he
said. "We are unable to give people in
America the level of security they [need].
"[ln the past], we could feel reasonably
confident that the preparations we took
could deter other states from acting
against us. [But] the problem govern
ments face in protecting their people has
increased. There are certain types of
criminal activities that are so widespread
that using criminal prosecution is ineffec
tive."
Abernethy expressed a more moder
ate view on the potential war.
"While deterrence was an effective

strategy in the Cold War, it is less
effective today," he said. "Hence,
we should be much more open to
preemptory attacks."
Abernethy gave the example
that territorial threats are futile
against stateless groups such as al-
Qaida. 1 le also argued that anti-war
groups fail to see that Saddam Hus
sein's evasion of the U.N. under
mines the organization's credibility.
On the other hand, a preemp
tive war would set a precedent
that would be difficult to justify on
ethical grounds, he warned.
The amount of time the U.S.
would spend between the entry
and exit of Iraq would amount to
an American occupation of the
country. Abernethy cited a num
ber of causes for this sustained stay

in Iraq, namely the civil and polit
ical dilemmas a war would create.
"I see major practical and polit
ical problems with out failure to
see that an exit will not be quick or
easy," he said.
Roberts reminded students
that they could influence the situ
ation in Iraq by being politically
active.
"The real decision comes from
the people," he said, encouraging
students to gather facts, think crit
ically and draw their own conclu
sions.
"It was good to hear opinions
on the war that were different
from my own," freshman Alice
Warnecke said after the event. "1
definitely plan on attending fu
ture discussions."

panels with different speakers
each month to keep students up
