es at cheap prices

* * ..froiay Seem strange to some readers, but not everyone on campus
at the Stanford Shopping Center for their wardrobe. A large con
, un^ncybf students look to vintage and secondhand shops when buying
dieirjback-ro-school outfits. Surprising as it may seem, the towns sur-
IWintrStanford's campus are full of thrift stores tliat cater to all different
Wstes,, IVlany of you may ask, "Why would someone buy secondhand
® The fcasonsare numerous. For me, I always saw thrift shopping as a
w*y -to stretch my finances; all those dollars I saved by not buying
" v rtiUiger jeans was tunneled into trips to concerts and videos games aur-
IJW high school. Aside from purely monetary concerns, there is a whole
fashion flair associated with the "tnrift store look." What, did
jjgoufiiink that Kurt Cobain bought all those flannels at Macys? Where do
lliuik Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo bought that sweater he was al
*lrayln"Ooning about? Whether you are a girl or a guy, buy all your stuff
or just want to add a little bit ofvintage flair, thrift store items
112 some efeek<*hic to your outfits.
& 1 JiUnderneatn it all, thrift shopping is truly enjoyable because of the
thrill of searching through racks ofclothes, looking for that perfect ringer
t-shirt or track jacket. There is a calming effect that comes from perusing
the styles of the past and a satisfaction that accompanies scoring the
coolest pair of shoes or an old Beatles album on vinyl. Below
I've given info on the best of the numerous thrifting options
in the area around campus. As with great restaurants or vjr® $
parks, each shop has its own flair and specialty - don't be afraid \
to visit each place. J®
St. Vincent de Paul Outlet Store J||9
2406 El Camino Real, Redwood City
This store is part of the national St. Vincent de |||Y^
Paul society which, like Goodwill, uses their sales ~ OdfiglN |Ma/
to provide services to children and families in need
and provides cheap clothes to its local community. While this
store is organized well and features some really strange and inter
esting paintings, the real pull is their AMAZING record collection.
Albums are only a dollar each, (50 cents for 7" singles) and you can find /
some of the greatest, rarest records of the '70s and '80s along the
shelves and in the boxes hidden away in the back. In one visit I //
scored the folllowing: Devo's first two albums, a Duran Duran ffjXCrfji
record, Prince's "1999" and "Purple Rain," David Bowie's "Low" and
"Scary Monsters," along with an hour long technical recording of heart
murmurs — all for $8! I felt like Indiana Jones finding the Holy Grail
when I saw this store's cache of music history. With new donations flow
ing in weekly, this gold mine of a store is well worth the 20-minute drive
up El Camino.
// St. Vincent de Paul Society
/ 2044 Old Middlefield Way
On the way to In-N-Out, just off of Rengstorfl Ave., is our local
St. Vincent de Paul Society headquarters. I heir clothing section
is generally pretty large and offers a good breadth of women and
k men's clothes, along with interesting uniforms and dressy ap-
K parel. The real pull of this place is their warehouse-sized fur
\ niture showcase room. St. Vincent has a special place in my
\ heart, as it was here that I purchased my trusty one-armed
love seat back in freshman year. They have couches, rediners,
O desks and everything in between available at pretty reason
// able prices (I paid about 45 for my two-seater). I promise that
/ if you come with room in your trunk, you will leave with a new
piece of charmingly vintage dorm furnishings.
Savers ;I | ,
875 Main St, Redwood City *
Walking into Savers last Friday was like crossing heaven's dfttrly gatps*
Savers is the king of all secondhand shopping experiences; ;®er
ing an afternoon at Savers, you will never buy clothing Lhtlsame way
again! Let me paint a picture for you: Imagine a thfift store w|H two s!:0|
ries and about as much floor space as Safeway. The dotfijtk
nized impeccably by size AND color. 1 r
There are separate sections for seasonal clothing along 'with exten
sive non-clothing sections including housewares, computers. exercLSC
equipment, frames, quilts and sewing material, sporting goods
toys. And they have a return policy. A goddamn thrift sy>re wjQvsrr J
turn policy! It's like a dream come true to those in t he market fjbr vin
flH m
I would recommend planning on spending a (or
more) at Savers in order to have time to go through all A'part
inents and try things on. The prices are unbelievable, wato slims or
pants usually never exceeding b dollars. Hie sign
than 4000 new items weekly and the staff keeps the
the thrifting virgin, this is the perfect place to dive into the Sb&lfl
