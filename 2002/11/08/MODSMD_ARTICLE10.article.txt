## U.N. resolution on Iraq likely to pass 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
The United States reached critical
agreement with France on a tough
U.N. resolution that gives Iraq a
last chance to disarm or face "seri
ous consequences," setting the
stage fora vote today.
While yesterday's agreement
offers concessions, it still meets
the Bush administration's de
mands to toughen inspections
and free the United States to take
military action if inspectors say
Iraq isn't complying.
"When this resolution passes, I
will be able to say that the United
Nations has recognized the threat
and now we're going to work to
gether to disarm him," Bush said.
fhe breakthrough came after
the United States and cosponsor
Britain changed the wording in
two key provisions to satisfy
French and Russian concerns that
the resolution could automatically
trigger an attack on Iraq.
Hours earlier, French Presi
dent Jacques Chirac's office con
firmed the agreement. French of
ficials said it eliminated "ambigui
ties" that could be used to trigger
an attack, and kept the Security
Council as the key body in dealing
with the Iraqi issue.
At the same time, it gives Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein a last
chance to cooperate with weapons
inspectors, holds out the possibili
ty of lifting 12-year-old sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, and reaffirms the coun

try's sovereignty.
To get French support, the
United States agreed to change
the wording in a key provision that
would declare Iraq in "material
breach" of its U.N. obligations.
The change addresses concerns
by France, Russia, Syria and others
that the original wording would
have let the United States deter
mine on its own whether Iraq had
committed an infraction. Such a
determination, France and Russia
feared, would have triggered an
attack on Saddam.
The new wording requires U.N.
weapons inspectors to make an as
sessment of any Iraqi violations.
Language in another key para
graph was also changed to account
for Russian concerns of a second
hidden trigger.
Yesterday evening, U.S. Am
bassador John Negroponte said
there was "broad support" for the
resolution.
The United States and Britain
have been trying to get all 15 Secu
rity Council members to approve
the new resolution to send a unit
ed message to Saddam Hussein —
but Syria is likely to abstain, vote
"no," or not vote at all.
Russian Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov wouldn't say how his gov
ernment will vote. But a U.S. ad
ministration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Russ
ian President Vladimir Putin con
veyed a "positive" message during a
conversation with Bush yesterday.
