# Gephardt reflects on election losses

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Rep. Dick
Gephardt, stepping down yesterday as House
Democratic leader, blamed his party's Election
Day losses on the political fallout from last
year's terrorist attacks and a Republican advan
tage in fund raising.
Gephardt said he has not decided whether
to run for the White House in 2004, although
he added: "I'll look at running for president.
I've done it before and 1 know a lot about it."
The Missouri Democrat, 61, made his com
ments during an interview in the Capitol office
he will soon vacate, several hours after a con
ference call in which he told members of the
party rank-and-file that he would not seek a
fifth term as party leader.
Gephardt won his seat in Congress in 197(5,
and was a bridge back to the days of a Democ
ratic-controlled House, when he served as ma
jority leader.
He easily retained the leadership post when
Republicans won the House in 1994, and tried,
unsuccessfully, for eight years to return his
party to power. Democrats gained seats in
1996, 1998 and 2000.
Republicans reversed the trend on Tuesday
night and picked up at least four seats.
