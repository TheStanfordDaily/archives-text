LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) â€”A man waiting in a
parking lot outside his son's school shot the
fourth-grader to death and wounded the boy's
mother yesterday after a domestic dispute, po
lice said.
The shootings happened around 12:30
p.m. as the woman was picking up the boy at
St. James Catholic School, which serves 322
students in kindergarten through eighth
grade.
Police Lt. Mark Misenhelter said the gun
man was the child's father. He said the sus
pect had argued with the boy's mother earlier

in the day, though their relationship was not
immediately clear.
The man was arrested about an hour later at a
liquor store in Kansas City, 20 miles away. Kansas
City police spokesman Tony Sanders said police
got a tip the man had said he was trying to get out
of town because he had just shot someone.
Jaswinder Singh, 41, was charged yesterday
night with murder, assault and armed criminal
action, a Clay County dispatcher said. Singh
was being held without bond.
The identities and ages of the victims were
not provided. Police said the boy died at the

scene. His mother underwent surgery and was
expected to recover, police said.
The schoolchildren were taken to a nearby
movie theater to await the arrival of their par
ents. Among the pupils was the boy's sister, who
police say saw the shooting.
Rebecca Summers, spokeswoman for the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St.
Joseph, said all students were accounted for
and the school was locked down.
The students never play in the parking
lot, Summers said, "so 1 can't imagine they
saw this."
