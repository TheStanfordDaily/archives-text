## The
						Stanford Daily Stanford should try new strategies for alcohol safety 
### 
Published Since 18)1

On weekend nights, students often
search for the best party where care
free dancing combines with reduced
inhibitions to create an outlet from problem
sets and research papers.
Because three housed fraternities are on
either alcohol probation or alcohol suspen
sion, campus party-goers must now walk past
quiet fraternity houses en route to lively par
ties in dorm residences, such as Wilbur, Suites
and Stern.
We recognize the growing severity of alco
hol-related liabilities and the need for Uni
versity response. However, we encourage
students and administration to collaborate
toward preventative strategies to preserve
healthy atmospheres at parties.
The University's alcohol policy has one
clear, yet complex goal: to keep students
safe. This mission faces challenges of curb-

ing underage drinking, preventing exces
sive consumption and fostering an environ
ment that minimizes the risks of serving al
cohol. But the mission fails when high
school students are discovered chugging
beers at campus parties, and Stanford stu
dents are arrested for driving under the in
fluence of alcohol. Though these situations
are anomalies, their potential creates a need
for better prevention.
Despite alcohol-policy efforts, many
major campus parties have failed to comply
with the University's preventative mea
sures. Campus parties are typically tagged
with the rule, "SUID to Enter, 21 to Drink.'
But in practice, cases involving underage
students and alcohol poisoning are report
ed each year. We would be naive to assume
that such drinking does not occur within the
confines of registered campus parties.

However, new, creative approaches to
the alcohol policy could enhance existing
prevention measures. For example, resi
dent assistants could better emphasize alco
hol awareness and safety issues with resi
dents. Residential Education could invest
more in alcohol-free environments. Party
organizers could enroll the necessary re
sources to manage and monitor alcohol
consumption. The Office ol Student Activi
ties could collaborate with Res Ed and
Vaden for large-scale campaigns to alter
students' perceptions of alcohol.
Given the increased severity of recent al
cohol-related incidents, we expect the Uni
versity to take measures to implement a
safer campus. Further, when a blatant and
severe violation of the alcohol policy occurs,
students should face consequences in accor
dance with University policy.

However, the solution to such infractions
should not inherently place Greek houses
on probation. The resulting hesitance
among fraternities to throw parties directly
opposes their mission "to enhance the col
lege experience," as stated on the Office of
Student Activities Web'site. When Universi
ty policy thwarts the presence of parties,
then this policy compromises the quality of
student life, which compromises the goals of
student affairs.
It is possible for party-going students to
consume alcohol with moderation and abide
by University policy and federal law. A
proactive, multidimensional approach that
integrates students and administrative
branches would better prepare organizers to
throw safe parties. Together, we can reduce
the need for alcohol probations and rejuve
nate the campus social scene.
