# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## Discussing class issues 
### 
We don't talk about class issues
very much at Stanford, ex
cept in reference to other
people and larger world is
sues. As much as we talk about race, sexu
ality, religion and politics, generally, peo
ple don't tend to have conversations, even
among friends, about their differences in
socioeconomic standing.
So when I listened to a fiiend explain to me
what he was arguing in a paper about pover
ty, 1 thought it was veiy interesting. He siiid
that, when we tliink about people being poor
in the United States, the assumption is that
there is something wrong with them that has
placed them in that situation. Either they're
not smart enough, or they're not doing

enough, or they've messed
up their chance at success.
Tliis perception holds true
for ;ill the races, iir one way
or another.
America is supposed to
be the land of equal op
portunity, of free enter
prise, free trade, free mar
kets and, supposedly,
people who are free to

take advantage of these. ( )f course we know
that in reality it doesn't work that way, but
this is definitely an idea that is built into ihe
cultural mythology of the country.
If you have a society in which equal op
portunity coexists with inequality, the con
clusion is that those who are at the lower
end of the scale must not have capitalized
effectively on t he available opportunities.
Now, poverty is experienced differently
across races, but no matter to what degree
poverty is the norm in a particular society,
it is not t he ideal for any group in America.
I think, and conversations with friends of
various races has confirmed, that this is
particularly so for Caucasians. To be white
and poor is an especially unfavorable situ
ation because the opportunity structure in
this country has been set up fora long time
to favor white people.
This is part of the reason that when you
compare suicide rates among people of low
socioeconomic standing across race (as I
did fora class last winter), poor white peo
ple have a much higher suicide rate than
poor black people. Obviously, there are
many variables that factor into this analysis,
but one conclusion that can be reached is
that since it is perceived as being more usual
for black people to live in poverty, when
white people live in poverty they see their
situation as particularly dire, which leads
them to take a measure as drastic as suicide.
This is what I am getting at: Nobody
wants to be associated with poverty, be
cause poverty carries very bad connota
tions in America. I can most effectively use
the examples of white and black people be
cause these are the communities that I am
most familiar with in this regard, through
my own experiences and through expo
sure to academic works on urban poverty.
Maybe because of the stereotypes associat-

Ed with black people and poverty (like the
stereotype that many, if not most, blacks
are "ghetto" and poor), African' Americans
go to numerous lengths to create the illu
sion of wealth, even if they cannot pay their
bills. This influences the way that they
dress, the cars that they drive and the
places that they choose to frequent.
In the white community, the percep
tion is that poverty is not the norm, be
cause white people represent mainstream
America, which goes hand in hand with
the notion of the American dream. There
fore, when a white person lias a low so
cioeconomic standing, that person may
feel that he does not fulfill his expected
role in society.
Bringing this to Stanford, I think that
the situation is slightly complicated. Stan
ford does a lot to reduce the gaps between
people who come from different economic
backgrounds, by offering need-based fi
nancial aid and by encouraging people to
live on campus, where they are housed in
similar conditions and eat the same type of
food, so class differences are not immedi
ately noticeable.
The thing is, the stereotype of what caus
es people to live in poverty (they are stupid
or lazy) is hard to justify at a place like this,
because that description is not supposed to
fit a Stanford student — we are meant to be
some of the most hardworking and talent -
ed people in our peer group. Poor Stanford
students offer proof and cause us to grap
ple with the idea that even really smart, re
ally ambitious and motivated people can
still be poor in America.
Does that mean there really are a lot of
reasons that people do not necessarily do
well economically, regardless of their
race, and that t here is a lot of injustice in
the way that opportunity is distributed
across society?
Honestly, on an individual level, it may
not be that deep. Maybe people just don't
want to talk about the fact that they couldn't
go out to dinner with their friends last
weekend because they couldn't afford it.
Maybe they feel bad that their roommate is
walking around in the same coat every day,
when they are browsing the latest Vogue,
browsing the new YSL accessory range.
But even if that's the reason, that reluc
tance comes from somewhere. It comes
from the way that we think about what it
means to be poor — or what it means to be
rich, for that matter. We should try to get
beyond the inhibitions that these stereo
types foster and to be more open and will
ing to discuss. Conversations about (lass
would be highly fruitful, particularly
among this opinionated, educated and —
to a small degree—influential subset of the
population.
