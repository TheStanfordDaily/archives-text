'In Defense of The Daily'
I am writing in response to the letter to
the editor written by I)an Mc( iarthy enti
tled "Dailv endorsements 'ignore the con
servative viewpoint' " (Nov. 6). As a regu
lar reader of The Daily, I fee! compelled to
write in defense of 1 he Dailv based on my
observations over the last couple years.
First of all, any newspaper is entitled to
and should give its opinion (in its editorial
sections) on any number of issues. I his
opinion is representative of the paper s
editorial board and can reflect the bias of
those members. There is no journalistic
responsibility to be balanced in the opin
ions sections of a newspa | >er, which t he en
dorsements are part of. This is different
from the "reporting" areas of the paper
where there is a responsibility to present
the facts without bias.
That said, I do feel that The Daily has
gone out of its wa\ to present balanced
views on politically controversial issues in
both its editorial sections and its reporting.
In an academic setting, where the default
political leanings ate to the lefi. ibis means
that The Daily has many times presented
the more conservative arguments on cer
tain issues. It has done so both in its own
[editorials] and through its columns ("In
Defense of Cieorge Bush." Oct. 24). ft has
also taken the initiative to provide coverage
on the presence of more conservative views
on campus (for instance, the front-page ai -
tide on Oct. 29 about the new College Re
publicans student group). Finally, I he
Daily has also published numerous letters
to the editor which argue the more consei
vative side (including a ver\ well thought
out letter In Andrea Kverett on N<>\ I titled
"In defense of just war"). I don't wish to
take up space to < ite a litany of examples,
but just to assert thai, as a pel son who can
lean conservative, 1 have generallv been

pleased by The Daily's coverage.
1 feel "qualified" to reply on this be
cause I consider myself a moderate con
servative — being more so on some issues
(such as national security and defense)
and less conservative on others (such as
the use of medical marijuana). As one who
can get irritated by blatantly biased cover
age and knee-jerk political views — right
or left — I have always wanted to com
mend I'he Daily for its reasonably bal
anced coverage and opinions in recent
years. (While I am .it it, I would also like to
recognize The Daily's rational examina
tions of rnanv non-political campus issues
as well — I don't always agree, but usual
i\ ilie analysis is thorough and well-pre
sented). For me, the best indicator of this
balance is that I can find myself alterna
tively vexed by some articles and opinions
while in pleasantly surprised agreement
with others. I am not arguing that the
"slant" is evenly balanced, in 50/ 50 pro
portions; it doesn't have to be. However,
in iiiv view, Hie Daily has taken care to
allow expression of both conservative and
liberal ideas, which is refreshing to see in
a student-run newspaper. There is cer
tainly no blatant attempt to squelch the
t onservative viewpoint.

FLiCKS staff should have better
policed the line
The article in yesterday's Daily about
the "<S Mile fiasco (" lempers Hare as stu
dents denied to '8 Mile,' " Nov. 7) failed to
mention one thing: the rampant cutting in
the line. I showed up ;it 6:30 — an hour
before the movie was to start —and then
watched as dozens of students cut in front

of inc. Student who arrived 45 minutes
after I did got in to see the movie, while I
was forced to sta\ outside. When I com
plained that people who had been in line
behind me got in to set the movie, and I
didn't, a FLiC.KS staff member told me,
"Yeah, but, like, a 100 people cut in front
of them. 11 KLi( IKS wants to overbook the
auditorium, that's line. II it wants to keep
hundreds ol people waiting outside the
auditorium for over an hour when there
are hundreds of unoccupied seats inside,
that is also fine. But there is no excuse for
their inability to police their own line.

Not researching fraternity parties
'undermines' columnists' stance
While it often takes great events
to move me from my useless state
on the couch, the [column] "Stan
ford's 'social' contract" (Nov. 6)
was compelling enough to inspire
my response.
I his [column] points out obvi
ous facts pertaining to Stanford's
social scene (or current lack there
of), but it ignores truths that would
easily be discovered if the authors
had done more research. It says
that prime real estate is given to
fraternities in exchange for pro
viding a "service to the communi
ty," but, later, the authors contra
dict themselves by stating that,
"previous commitment to social
life at Stanford legitimized [frater
nities'] housed status." They are
willing to concede that fraternities

do "more than the average house,"
but add that they "aren't doing
much for social life at Stanford."
The statement belittles the efforts
of fraternities to give back to the
community (consider Sigma Chi's
remarkable example of building a
playground in East Palo Alto), as
well as all fraternities' commitment
to throwing enjoyable parties.
If the authors had taken more
time to examine fraternity involve
ment, they would have realized that
fraternities not only provide some
of the most involved community
service, but they are characteristi
cally the only houses that consis
tently throw large-scale parties.
There is no reason that other resi
dences cannot plan parties (might I
mention they are able to do so with
out fear of probation by the Univer
sity), but, regardless, the fraternities
are blamed if a Saturday night's op
tions areToyon vs. Soto when it was
likely someone from a freshman
dorm whose inexperience with
drinking may have been the prob
lem that resulted in a fraternity's al
cohol probation in the first place.
Greninger and Meyer maintain
that at other universities, "Greek
organizations sponsor a wide vari
ety of non-party activities." They
seem to have forgotten events such
as Battle of the Bands, Phi Psi Tug-
O-War, and Spike 'N Jam, which
took place only last week. They
also gloss over numerous charity
runs and Habitat for Humanity

projects, further ignoring the in
volvement of Greek organizations
in Stanford's community.
The article proposes dry parties
as a way to fulfill a contract, citing
Kappa Sigma's non-alcoholic foam
party as an event with "widespread
appeal." With all respect to the
members of Kappa Sigma, some of
whom are friends, the claim that last
year's foam party held widespread
appeal is untrue. This statement
begs the question, "Did Greninger
and Meyer even attend this party?"
Furthermore, the suggestion of
a Coca-Gola-themed party in
honor of J. Daniels ("J is for
. ..Jeff") is ridiculous. Why on
earth would a fraternity indirecdy
encourage people to smuggle hard
alcohol into a party, which is im
measurably more likely to result in
alcohol poisoning than keg beer,
when people show up severely ine
briated in the first place? A "J. (Jeff)
Daniels and Goca-Cola Party,"
which certainly wouldn't pass the
eyes of the laziest administrator, is
clearly a suggestion made by some
one who has never had experience
with party planning or the inner
workings of a fraternity party.
Lastly, Greninger and Meyer
claim that Hayne's and Diedrich's
statements are mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately, Diedrich's point
that, "people don't get drunk at frat
parties," and Hayne's quote, "non
alcoholic parties? Gome on grand
ma, get your head out of the sand,"

are in accord. It is, as any party
knowledgeable student would
agree, nearly impossible to attain a
half cup of foamy beer [at a frat
party], much less enough of diem
to get drunk. Why else would peo
ple pre-party in their dorm rooms
and drink their own supply? What
ever the claims made by the au
thors, the offer of alcohol is one of
the key motivating factors for peo
ple to attend the party — to have a
few beers, socialize and dance.
Greninger and Meyer touch on
an important issue, but their fail
ure to carefully examine the facts
and realities of fraternity life un
dermines their stance.

Examining ASSU policy on
special-fee refunds
Wednesday's article regarding
the ASSU's potential $350,000 sur
plus delivered a couple surprises
("ASSU reveals $350,000 surplus,"
Nov. 6). Of course, the first sur
prise is that the ASSU has so much
extra money ear-marked for spe
cial fees that it has not used. But
the bigger surprise is that the
ASSU charges students another fee
on top of special fees to make up
for students who request a special
fees refund.

In practice, this probably only
amounts to a few dollars per stu
dent, but in principle, it has two
disturbing characteristics. First, for
students who request a refund be
cause they have irreconcilable dif
ferences with some group, this fee
defeats some portion of the pur
pose of their request since the
group will still receive the same
amount of funding. Second, stu
dents who support special-fee
groups end up subsidizing those
who don't, something students
should be made aware of during
special-fee election season.
Returning this money to the
students would probably be im
practical, but I hope the ASSU
does solicit substantial student
input as to how the money should
be spent, if only because it came
from the students.

Not researching fraternity parties
'undermines' columnists' stance
While it often takes great events
to move me from my useless state
on the couch, the [column] "Stan
ford's 'social' contract" (Nov. 6)
was compelling enough to inspire
my response.
I his [column] points out obvi
ous facts pertaining to Stanford's
social scene (or current lack there
of), but it ignores truths that would
easily be discovered if the authors
had done more research. It says
that prime real estate is given to
fraternities in exchange for pro
viding a "service to the communi
ty," but, later, the authors contra
dict themselves by stating that,
"previous commitment to social
life at Stanford legitimized [frater
nities'] housed status." They are
willing to concede that fraternities

do "more than the average house,"
but add that they "aren't doing
much for social life at Stanford."
The statement belittles the efforts
of fraternities to give back to the
community (consider Sigma Chi's
remarkable example of building a
playground in East Palo Alto), as
well as all fraternities' commitment
to throwing enjoyable parties.
If the authors had taken more
time to examine fraternity involve
ment, they would have realized that
fraternities not only provide some
of the most involved community
service, but they are characteristi
cally the only houses that consis
tently throw large-scale parties.
There is no reason that other resi
dences cannot plan parties (might I
mention they are able to do so with
out fear of probation by the Univer
sity), but, regardless, the fraternities
are blamed if a Saturday night's op
tions areToyon vs. Soto when it was
likely someone from a freshman
dorm whose inexperience with
drinking may have been the prob
lem that resulted in a fraternity's al
cohol probation in the first place.
Greninger and Meyer maintain
that at other universities, "Greek
organizations sponsor a wide vari
ety of non-party activities." They
seem to have forgotten events such
as Battle of the Bands, Phi Psi Tug-
O-War, and Spike 'N Jam, which
took place only last week. They
also gloss over numerous charity
runs and Habitat for Humanity

projects, further ignoring the in
volvement of Greek organizations
in Stanford's community.
The article proposes dry parties
as a way to fulfill a contract, citing
Kappa Sigma's non-alcoholic foam
party as an event with "widespread
appeal." With all respect to the
members of Kappa Sigma, some of
whom are friends, the claim that last
year's foam party held widespread
appeal is untrue. This statement
begs the question, "Did Greninger
and Meyer even attend this party?"
Furthermore, the suggestion of
a Coca-Gola-themed party in
honor of J. Daniels ("J is for
. ..Jeff") is ridiculous. Why on
earth would a fraternity indirecdy
encourage people to smuggle hard
alcohol into a party, which is im
measurably more likely to result in
alcohol poisoning than keg beer,
when people show up severely ine
briated in the first place? A "J. (Jeff)
Daniels and Goca-Cola Party,"
which certainly wouldn't pass the
eyes of the laziest administrator, is
clearly a suggestion made by some
one who has never had experience
with party planning or the inner
workings of a fraternity party.
Lastly, Greninger and Meyer
claim that Hayne's and Diedrich's
statements are mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately, Diedrich's point
that, "people don't get drunk at frat
parties," and Hayne's quote, "non
alcoholic parties? Gome on grand
ma, get your head out of the sand,"

are in accord. It is, as any party
knowledgeable student would
agree, nearly impossible to attain a
half cup of foamy beer [at a frat
party], much less enough of diem
to get drunk. Why else would peo
ple pre-party in their dorm rooms
and drink their own supply? What
ever the claims made by the au
thors, the offer of alcohol is one of
the key motivating factors for peo
ple to attend the party — to have a
few beers, socialize and dance.
Greninger and Meyer touch on
an important issue, but their fail
ure to carefully examine the facts
and realities of fraternity life un
dermines their stance.

Examining ASSU policy on
special-fee refunds
Wednesday's article regarding
the ASSU's potential $350,000 sur
plus delivered a couple surprises
("ASSU reveals $350,000 surplus,"
Nov. 6). Of course, the first sur
prise is that the ASSU has so much
extra money ear-marked for spe
cial fees that it has not used. But
the bigger surprise is that the
ASSU charges students another fee
on top of special fees to make up
for students who request a special
fees refund.

In practice, this probably only
amounts to a few dollars per stu
dent, but in principle, it has two
disturbing characteristics. First, for
students who request a refund be
cause they have irreconcilable dif
ferences with some group, this fee
defeats some portion of the pur
pose of their request since the
group will still receive the same
amount of funding. Second, stu
dents who support special-fee
groups end up subsidizing those
who don't, something students
should be made aware of during
special-fee election season.
Returning this money to the
students would probably be im
practical, but I hope the ASSU
does solicit substantial student
input as to how the money should
be spent, if only because it came
from the students.

'In Defense of The Daily'
I am writing in response to the letter to
the editor written by I)an Mc( iarthy enti
tled "Dailv endorsements 'ignore the con
servative viewpoint' " (Nov. 6). As a regu
lar reader of The Daily, I fee! compelled to
write in defense of 1 he Dailv based on my
observations over the last couple years.
First of all, any newspaper is entitled to
and should give its opinion (in its editorial
sections) on any number of issues. I his
opinion is representative of the paper s
editorial board and can reflect the bias of
those members. There is no journalistic
responsibility to be balanced in the opin
ions sections of a newspa | >er, which t he en
dorsements are part of. This is different
from the "reporting" areas of the paper
where there is a responsibility to present
the facts without bias.
That said, I do feel that The Daily has
gone out of its wa\ to present balanced
views on politically controversial issues in
both its editorial sections and its reporting.
In an academic setting, where the default
political leanings ate to the lefi. ibis means
that The Daily has many times presented
the more conservative arguments on cer
tain issues. It has done so both in its own
[editorials] and through its columns ("In
Defense of Cieorge Bush." Oct. 24). ft has
also taken the initiative to provide coverage
on the presence of more conservative views
on campus (for instance, the front-page ai -
tide on Oct. 29 about the new College Re
publicans student group). Finally, I he
Daily has also published numerous letters
to the editor which argue the more consei
vative side (including a ver\ well thought
out letter In Andrea Kverett on N<>\ I titled
"In defense of just war"). I don't wish to
take up space to < ite a litany of examples,
but just to assert thai, as a pel son who can
lean conservative, 1 have generallv been

pleased by The Daily's coverage.
1 feel "qualified" to reply on this be
cause I consider myself a moderate con
servative — being more so on some issues
(such as national security and defense)
and less conservative on others (such as
the use of medical marijuana). As one who
can get irritated by blatantly biased cover
age and knee-jerk political views — right
or left — I have always wanted to com
mend I'he Daily for its reasonably bal
anced coverage and opinions in recent
years. (While I am .it it, I would also like to
recognize The Daily's rational examina
tions of rnanv non-political campus issues
as well — I don't always agree, but usual
i\ ilie analysis is thorough and well-pre
sented). For me, the best indicator of this
balance is that I can find myself alterna
tively vexed by some articles and opinions
while in pleasantly surprised agreement
with others. I am not arguing that the
"slant" is evenly balanced, in 50/ 50 pro
portions; it doesn't have to be. However,
in iiiv view, Hie Daily has taken care to
allow expression of both conservative and
liberal ideas, which is refreshing to see in
a student-run newspaper. There is cer
tainly no blatant attempt to squelch the
t onservative viewpoint.

FLiCKS staff should have better
policed the line
The article in yesterday's Daily about
the "<S Mile fiasco (" lempers Hare as stu
dents denied to '8 Mile,' " Nov. 7) failed to
mention one thing: the rampant cutting in
the line. I showed up ;it 6:30 — an hour

watched as dozens of students cut in front

after I did got in to see the movie, while I

plained that people who had been in line
behind me got in to set the movie, and I
didn't, a FLiC.KS staff member told me,
"Yeah, but, like, a 100 people cut in front
of them. 11 KLi( IKS wants to overbook the
auditorium, that's line. II it wants to keep
hundreds ol people waiting outside the

are hundreds of unoccupied seats inside,
that is also fine. But there is no excuse for
their inability to police their own line.

Meanwhile, they are caged

Not researching fraternity parties
'undermines' columnists' stance
While it often takes great events
to move me from my useless state
on the couch, the [column] "Stan
ford's 'social' contract" (Nov. 6)
was compelling enough to inspire
my response.
I his [column] points out obvi
ous facts pertaining to Stanford's
social scene (or current lack there
of), but it ignores truths that would
easily be discovered if the authors
had done more research. It says
that prime real estate is given to
fraternities in exchange for pro
viding a "service to the communi
ty," but, later, the authors contra
dict themselves by stating that,
"previous commitment to social
life at Stanford legitimized [frater
nities'] housed status." They are
willing to concede that fraternities

do "more than the average house,"
but add that they "aren't doing
much for social life at Stanford."
The statement belittles the efforts
of fraternities to give back to the
community (consider Sigma Chi's
remarkable example of building a
playground in East Palo Alto), as
well as all fraternities' commitment
to throwing enjoyable parties.
If the authors had taken more
time to examine fraternity involve
ment, they would have realized that
fraternities not only provide some
of the most involved community
service, but they are characteristi
cally the only houses that consis
tently throw large-scale parties.
There is no reason that other resi
dences cannot plan parties (might I
mention they are able to do so with
out fear of probation by the Univer
sity), but, regardless, the fraternities
are blamed if a Saturday night's op
tions areToyon vs. Soto when it was
likely someone from a freshman
dorm whose inexperience with
drinking may have been the prob
lem that resulted in a fraternity's al
cohol probation in the first place.
Greninger and Meyer maintain
that at other universities, "Greek
organizations sponsor a wide vari
ety of non-party activities." They
seem to have forgotten events such
as Battle of the Bands, Phi Psi Tug-
O-War, and Spike 'N Jam, which
took place only last week. They
also gloss over numerous charity
runs and Habitat for Humanity

projects, further ignoring the in
volvement of Greek organizations
in Stanford's community.
The article proposes dry parties
as a way to fulfill a contract, citing
Kappa Sigma's non-alcoholic foam
party as an event with "widespread
appeal." With all respect to the
members of Kappa Sigma, some of
whom are friends, the claim that last
year's foam party held widespread
appeal is untrue. This statement
begs the question, "Did Greninger
and Meyer even attend this party?"
Furthermore, the suggestion of
a Coca-Gola-themed party in
honor of J. Daniels ("J is for
. ..Jeff") is ridiculous. Why on
earth would a fraternity indirecdy
encourage people to smuggle hard
alcohol into a party, which is im
measurably more likely to result in
alcohol poisoning than keg beer,
when people show up severely ine
briated in the first place? A "J. (Jeff)
Daniels and Goca-Cola Party,"
which certainly wouldn't pass the
eyes of the laziest administrator, is
clearly a suggestion made by some
one who has never had experience
with party planning or the inner
workings of a fraternity party.
Lastly, Greninger and Meyer
claim that Hayne's and Diedrich's
statements are mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately, Diedrich's point
that, "people don't get drunk at frat
parties," and Hayne's quote, "non
alcoholic parties? Gome on grand
ma, get your head out of the sand,"

are in accord. It is, as any party
knowledgeable student would
agree, nearly impossible to attain a
half cup of foamy beer [at a frat
party], much less enough of diem
to get drunk. Why else would peo
ple pre-party in their dorm rooms
and drink their own supply? What
ever the claims made by the au
thors, the offer of alcohol is one of
the key motivating factors for peo
ple to attend the party — to have a
few beers, socialize and dance.
Greninger and Meyer touch on
an important issue, but their fail
ure to carefully examine the facts
and realities of fraternity life un
dermines their stance.

Examining ASSU policy on
special-fee refunds
Wednesday's article regarding
the ASSU's potential $350,000 sur
plus delivered a couple surprises
("ASSU reveals $350,000 surplus,"
Nov. 6). Of course, the first sur
prise is that the ASSU has so much
extra money ear-marked for spe
cial fees that it has not used. But
the bigger surprise is that the
ASSU charges students another fee
on top of special fees to make up
for students who request a special
fees refund.

In practice, this probably only
amounts to a few dollars per stu
dent, but in principle, it has two
disturbing characteristics. First, for
students who request a refund be
cause they have irreconcilable dif
ferences with some group, this fee
defeats some portion of the pur
pose of their request since the
group will still receive the same
amount of funding. Second, stu
dents who support special-fee
groups end up subsidizing those
who don't, something students
should be made aware of during
special-fee election season.
Returning this money to the
students would probably be im
practical, but I hope the ASSU
does solicit substantial student
input as to how the money should
be spent, if only because it came
from the students.

'In Defense of The Daily'
I am writing in response to the letter to

First of all, any newspaper is entitled to
and should give its opinion (in its editorial
sections) on any number of issues. I his
opinion is representative of the paper s
editorial board and can reflect the bias of
those members. There is no journalistic
responsibility to be balanced in the opin
ions sections of a newspa | >er, which t he en
dorsements are part of. This is different
from the "reporting" areas of the paper
where there is a responsibility to present
the facts without bias.
That said, I do feel that The Daily has
gone out of its wa\ to present balanced
views on politically controversial issues in
both its editorial sections and its reporting.
In an academic setting, where the default
political leanings ate to the lefi. ibis means

of fraternities to give back to the
community (consider Sigma Chi's
remarkable example of building a
playground in East Palo Alto), as
well as all fraternities' commitment
to throwing enjoyable parties.
If the authors had taken more
time to examine fraternity involve
ment, they would have realized that
fraternities not only provide some
of the most involved community
service, but they are characteristi
cally the only houses that consis
tently throw large-scale parties.
There is no reason that other resi
dences cannot plan parties (might I
mention they are able to do so with
out fear of probation by the Univer
sity), but, regardless, the fraternities
are blamed if a Saturday night's op
tions areToyon vs. Soto when it was
likely someone from a freshman
dorm whose inexperience with
drinking may have been the prob
lem that resulted in a fraternity's al
cohol probation in the first place.
Greninger and Meyer maintain
that at other universities, "Greek
organizations sponsor a wide vari
ety of non-party activities." They
seem to have forgotten events such
as Battle of the Bands, Phi Psi Tug-
O-War, and Spike 'N Jam, which
took place only last week. They
also gloss over numerous charity
runs and Habitat for Humanity

projects, further ignoring the in
volvement of Greek organizations
in Stanford's community.
The article proposes dry parties
as a way to fulfill a contract, citing
Kappa Sigma's non-alcoholic foam
party as an event with "widespread
appeal." With all respect to the
members of Kappa Sigma, some of
whom are friends, the claim that last
year's foam party held widespread
appeal is untrue. This statement
begs the question, "Did Greninger
and Meyer even attend this party?"
Furthermore, the suggestion of
a Coca-Gola-themed party in
honor of J. Daniels ("J is for
. ..Jeff") is ridiculous. Why on
earth would a fraternity indirecdy
encourage people to smuggle hard
alcohol into a party, which is im
measurably more likely to result in
alcohol poisoning than keg beer,
when people show up severely ine
briated in the first place? A "J. (Jeff)
Daniels and Goca-Cola Party,"
which certainly wouldn't pass the
eyes of the laziest administrator, is
clearly a suggestion made by some
one who has never had experience
with party planning or the inner
workings of a fraternity party.
Lastly, Greninger and Meyer
claim that Hayne's and Diedrich's
statements are mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately, Diedrich's point
that, "people don't get drunk at frat
parties," and Hayne's quote, "non
alcoholic parties? Gome on grand
ma, get your head out of the sand,"

are in accord. It is, as any party
knowledgeable student would
agree, nearly impossible to attain a
half cup of foamy beer [at a frat
party], much less enough of diem
to get drunk. Why else would peo
ple pre-party in their dorm rooms
and drink their own supply? What
ever the claims made by the au
thors, the offer of alcohol is one of
the key motivating factors for peo
ple to attend the party — to have a
few beers, socialize and dance.
Greninger and Meyer touch on
an important issue, but their fail
ure to carefully examine the facts
and realities of fraternity life un
dermines their stance.

Examining ASSU policy on
special-fee refunds
Wednesday's article regarding
the ASSU's potential $350,000 sur
plus delivered a couple surprises
("ASSU reveals $350,000 surplus,"
Nov. 6). Of course, the first sur
prise is that the ASSU has so much
extra money ear-marked for spe
cial fees that it has not used. But
the bigger surprise is that the
ASSU charges students another fee
on top of special fees to make up
for students who request a special
fees refund.

In practice, this probably only
amounts to a few dollars per stu
dent, but in principle, it has two
disturbing characteristics. First, for
students who request a refund be
cause they have irreconcilable dif
ferences with some group, this fee
defeats some portion of the pur
pose of their request since the
group will still receive the same
amount of funding. Second, stu
dents who support special-fee
groups end up subsidizing those
who don't, something students
should be made aware of during
special-fee election season.
Returning this money to the
students would probably be im
practical, but I hope the ASSU
does solicit substantial student
input as to how the money should
be spent, if only because it came
from the students.
