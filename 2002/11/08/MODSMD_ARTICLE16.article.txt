'In Defense of The Daily'
I am writing in response to the letter to
the editor written by I)an Mc( iarthy enti
tled "Dailv endorsements 'ignore the con
servative viewpoint' " (Nov. 6). As a regu
lar reader of The Daily, I fee! compelled to
write in defense of 1 he Dailv based on my
observations over the last couple years.
First of all, any newspaper is entitled to
and should give its opinion (in its editorial
sections) on any number of issues. I his
opinion is representative of the paper s
editorial board and can reflect the bias of
those members. There is no journalistic
responsibility to be balanced in the opin
ions sections of a newspa | >er, which t he en
dorsements are part of. This is different
from the "reporting" areas of the paper
where there is a responsibility to present
the facts without bias.
That said, I do feel that The Daily has
gone out of its wa\ to present balanced
views on politically controversial issues in
both its editorial sections and its reporting.
In an academic setting, where the default
political leanings ate to the lefi. ibis means
that The Daily has many times presented
the more conservative arguments on cer
tain issues. It has done so both in its own
[editorials] and through its columns ("In
Defense of Cieorge Bush." Oct. 24). ft has
also taken the initiative to provide coverage
on the presence of more conservative views
on campus (for instance, the front-page ai -
tide on Oct. 29 about the new College Re
publicans student group). Finally, I he
Daily has also published numerous letters
to the editor which argue the more consei
vative side (including a ver\ well thought
out letter In Andrea Kverett on N<>\ I titled
"In defense of just war"). I don't wish to
take up space to < ite a litany of examples,
but just to assert thai, as a pel son who can
lean conservative, 1 have generallv been

pleased by The Daily's coverage.
1 feel "qualified" to reply on this be
cause I consider myself a moderate con
servative — being more so on some issues
(such as national security and defense)
and less conservative on others (such as
the use of medical marijuana). As one who
can get irritated by blatantly biased cover
age and knee-jerk political views — right
or left — I have always wanted to com
mend I'he Daily for its reasonably bal
anced coverage and opinions in recent
years. (While I am .it it, I would also like to
recognize The Daily's rational examina
tions of rnanv non-political campus issues
as well — I don't always agree, but usual
i\ ilie analysis is thorough and well-pre
sented). For me, the best indicator of this
balance is that I can find myself alterna
tively vexed by some articles and opinions
while in pleasantly surprised agreement
with others. I am not arguing that the
"slant" is evenly balanced, in 50/ 50 pro
portions; it doesn't have to be. However,
in iiiv view, Hie Daily has taken care to
allow expression of both conservative and
liberal ideas, which is refreshing to see in
a student-run newspaper. There is cer
tainly no blatant attempt to squelch the
t onservative viewpoint.

FLiCKS staff should have better
policed the line
The article in yesterday's Daily about
the "<S Mile fiasco (" lempers Hare as stu
dents denied to '8 Mile,' " Nov. 7) failed to
mention one thing: the rampant cutting in
the line. I showed up ;it 6:30 — an hour
before the movie was to start —and then
watched as dozens of students cut in front

of inc. Student who arrived 45 minutes
after I did got in to see the movie, while I
was forced to sta\ outside. When I com
plained that people who had been in line
behind me got in to set the movie, and I
didn't, a FLiC.KS staff member told me,
"Yeah, but, like, a 100 people cut in front
of them. 11 KLi( IKS wants to overbook the
auditorium, that's line. II it wants to keep
hundreds ol people waiting outside the
auditorium for over an hour when there
are hundreds of unoccupied seats inside,
that is also fine. But there is no excuse for
their inability to police their own line.

Lockdown demonstration reminds

I he Lockdown demonstration de

who took part also gave thought to the
