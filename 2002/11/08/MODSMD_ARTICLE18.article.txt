# Students interpret for non-English speakers at the Stanford Medical Center
## Speaking their Language 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What would it be like to go into a hospital
and not be able to get help because you don't
speak English? The Stanford Student Medical
Interpreters, SSMI, as part of a broader range
of interpreting services offered at the Stanford
Medical Center, help to prevent people from
having this kind of experience.
"It's really unfair that if you don't have the
language skills, you shouldn't have access to ad
equate medical care," said sophomore Bin Bin
Jiang, who is majoring in human biology and is
an officer of SSMI.
That's why Farzad Alemi, a first-year medical
school student, helped found SSMI in 2000.
Since then, roughly 35 to 40 students a year
have volunteered their time at the clinic. Not
everyone interested is able to do it.
"We just don't want anybody who speaks a
language to come in and work with patients,"
Alemi explained.
Instead, applicants take a language test, a
new requirement this year, and have a 45-
minute interview with Alberto Molina, director
of volunteer services at the hospital. Accepted
students, usually in groups of about eight, un
dergo a two-day training program conducted
by experienced interpreters two or three times
a year.
On the first day of class, volunteers learn the
basics of how to interpret and work with hospi
tal staff. T he second session covers more specif
ic details, such as some basic human anatomy
and tips on where to stand while translating.

spend at "least 10 hours shadowing another in
terpreter.
"Some students have gone through all this
and st ill don't feel comfortable jumping in and
interpreting. It's definitely a learning process,"
Alemi said.
lie added that potential volunteers should
ask themselves, "I low fluent do you think you
are, and how comfortable would you actually be
in a setting with a patient and a doctor, with the
whole stress of the interview revolving around
your skills?"
For those who do end up joining the pro
gram, the time commitment can vary consid
erably depending on the language spoken
and the availability of staff or community in
terpreters. While Jiang, who interprets Man
darin Chinese, volunteered an average of
four or five hours a week last year, Spanish in
terpreters are greatly needed and may be able
to work as many shifts as they'd like. Other
languages that SSMI students interpret are
French, Italian, Russian, Farsi and American
Sign Language.
fhe hospital coordinator generally e-mails
volunteers about appointments a few days in
advance, though, in the case of an emergency,
she may ask the appropriate interpreters if they
are available and would like to come in.
Many of the students volunteering their time
with SSMI are pre-med students who want the
chance to work in a hospital environment.
"I thought it would be a great opportunity to
help Spanish-speaking patients get a first-hand

experience in (lie emergency room and clinics
at the Stanford Hospital and learn medical
terms in Spanish," explained sophomore Dana
1 lot nbeak, who is planning to major in biology
and Spanish.
"It's a service to myself, but also a service to
other people," Jiang noted.
Involvement in interpreting can also pro
vide future doctors with a unique perspective
and experience in dealing with interpersonal
communication issues.
"Just seeing how, as a doctor, you can help
make the patient feel comfortable, and also how
as a hospital you can provide services that help
the patient is one of the perks of the program,"
said senior Annie Chan, a biology major and an
other officer of SSMI.
Although Jiang noted that doctors may occa
sionally act slightly defensive because they no
longer have full control over an interpreted
meeting, Chan countered that it is often the
doctors who request interpreters in order to
best help the patients.
"Just seeing the way a patient's eyes thank
fully light up when an interpreter enters the
room is enough to tell me that we are making a
difference, one patient at a time," Hornbeak
said.
"fl he patients] are really grateful for the ser
vice they are provided [with], because, 1 think a
lot of them would feel lost and just terrified if
the) didn't know what was going on," Jiang
said.
Alemi summed up, saying, "When push
comes to shove, both doctors and patients ap
preciate the interpreters."

by experienced interpreters two or three times
a year.
On the first day of class, volunteers learn the
basics of how to interpret and work with hospi
tal staff. T he second session covers more specif
ic details, such as some basic human anatomy
and tips on where to stand while translating.

ogy. Before interpreting on their own, students
spend at "least 10 hours shadowing another in
terpreter.
"Some students have gone through all this
and st ill don't feel comfortable jumping in and
interpreting. It's definitely a learning process,"
Alemi said.
lie added that potential volunteers should
ask themselves, "I low fluent do you think you
are, and how comfortable would you actually be
in a setting with a patient and a doctor, with the
whole stress of the interview revolving around
your skills?"
For those who do end up joining the pro
gram, the time commitment can vary consid
erably depending on the language spoken
and the availability of staff or community in
terpreters. While Jiang, who interprets Man
darin Chinese, volunteered an average of
four or five hours a week last year, Spanish in
terpreters are greatly needed and may be able
to work as many shifts as they'd like. Other
languages that SSMI students interpret are
French, Italian, Russian, Farsi and American
Sign Language.
fhe hospital coordinator generally e-mails
volunteers about appointments a few days in
advance, though, in the case of an emergency,
she may ask the appropriate interpreters if they
are available and would like to come in.
Many of the students volunteering their time
with SSMI are pre-med students who want the
chance to work in a hospital environment.
"I thought it would be a great opportunity to
help Spanish-speaking patients get a first-hand

experience in (lie emergency room and clinics
at the Stanford Hospital and learn medical
terms in Spanish," explained sophomore Dana
1 lot nbeak, who is planning to major in biology
and Spanish.
"It's a service to myself, but also a service to
other people," Jiang noted.
Involvement in interpreting can also pro
vide future doctors with a unique perspective
and experience in dealing with interpersonal
communication issues.
"Just seeing how, as a doctor, you can help
make the patient feel comfortable, and also how
as a hospital you can provide services that help
the patient is one of the perks of the program,"
said senior Annie Chan, a biology major and an
other officer of SSMI.
Although Jiang noted that doctors may occa
sionally act slightly defensive because they no
longer have full control over an interpreted
meeting, Chan countered that it is often the
doctors who request interpreters in order to
best help the patients.
"Just seeing the way a patient's eyes thank
fully light up when an interpreter enters the
room is enough to tell me that we are making a
difference, one patient at a time," Hornbeak
said.
"fl he patients] are really grateful for the ser
vice they are provided [with], because, 1 think a
lot of them would feel lost and just terrified if
the) didn't know what was going on," Jiang
said.
Alemi summed up, saying, "When push
comes to shove, both doctors and patients ap
preciate the interpreters."
