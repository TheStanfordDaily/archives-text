# Stanford doctors treat women in northeast Africa
## 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four Stanford doctors recently
spent eight days in Eritrea, a
country in northeast Africa, per
forming surgery on women with a
gynecological condition called fis
tula. Eritrean women would nor
mally have to travel to Ethiopia to
receive treatment for this condi
tion, a trip that is nearly impossi
ble due to conflict between the
two nations.
Dr. Mary Lake Polan, chair of
the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, traveled to Eritrea's
capital Asmara last year to get a feel
for what was needed in the region

as well as to make sure that there
was a place she and the team could
live and work.
"We picked Eritrea because the
people there were very welcoming
and honest when I visited there
last year," Polan said. "It also felt
very safe; a woman could walk the
streets at night and not feel threat
ened."
The three Stanford doctors —
Dr.Amreen Husain, assistant pro
fessor in gynecological oncology,
Dr. Carol Glowaki and Dr. Joelle
Osieas, staff gynecologists — and a
Johns Hopkins University sur
geon specializing in fistulas com
prised the surgical team, which re
turned on Oct. 4.

The doctors treated about 40
women for fisturlas, which result
from a childbirth lasting for sever
al days. The pressure of the fetus's
head against the pelvis can restrict
blood supply to the area and kill
the tissue. This condition can leave
the mother with a hole between
the bladder and the vagina, or in
some cases between the rectum
and the vagina. Affected women
cannot control leakage of urine or
sometimes stool, and as a result
often become ostracized.
The project was funded
through a series of grants from
foundations and medical supply
companies. Polan said that if the
project is to continue next year,

the doctors will need more funds.
1 lusain said that one of the vic
tories of the trip was the commit
ment of the local doctors to treat
ing the problem. She expressed
hope that they would be able to
pick up where they left off and
begin to treat more complicated
cases on their own.
"What would be ideal is for
them to set up a center to treat
these women," Husain said. "We
were only able to access about 40
women; a center would enable the
majority of them to be treated."
Polan concluded, "It was really
wonderful to give these women an
opportunity to rejoin their families
and go out and get jobs."
