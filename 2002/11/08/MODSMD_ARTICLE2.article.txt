# Security tightens at on-campus parties

### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
Imagine a weekend packed with
party after party — all of them inac
cessible to the average student be
cause of strict adherence to invite
lists. While the premise has the feel
of an exclusionary Hollywood after-
Oscar celebration, it may become a
reality at Stanford as campus
groups try this and other methods
to tighten the security of their par
ties in response to an increased cog
nizance of the dangers that all-cam
pus gatherings can entail.
An Increased Awareness of Risk
"We've been made increasingly
aware of the risks we take every time
we throw a party," said Marcus
Smith, resident assistant for the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
These risks manifested them
selves quite clearly for the fraternity
community early in the school year
during a string of incidences — in
cluding violation of the Orientation
alcohol ban and the presence of un
derage drinkers at on-campus par
ties — that resulted in punitive ac
tion by the University administra
tion. While typically overlooked, the
latter problem became a big issue

when high school students alleged
ly returning from a party at Kappa
Sigma were caught driving under
the influence.
Such transgressions have result
ed in three fraternities — including
Kappa Sigma — being put on alco
hol suspension or alcohol proba
tion.
"During the first few events of
the year, some mistakes were
made," said Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Nanci Howe, whose office
oversees all student groups, includ
ing fraternities and sororities, and
must approve all campus parties.
She added that the increased pres
sure fraternities and other organi
zations are feeling to raise the level
of security at their parties is a result
of the accumulation of unfortunate
incidences — not an administrative
crackdown.
"The administration doesn't
watch parties," she said. "We ad
dress issues as they come to us," ei

sources such as RAs, staff or parents
of high school students.
Howe listed two main problems
as the motivation for increased se
