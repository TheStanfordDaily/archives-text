# Security tightens at on-campus parties
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
Imagine a weekend packed with
party after party — all of them inac
cessible to the average student be
cause of strict adherence to invite
lists. While the premise has the feel
of an exclusionary Hollywood after-
Oscar celebration, it may become a
reality at Stanford as campus
groups try this and other methods
to tighten the security of their par
ties in response to an increased cog
nizance of the dangers that all-cam
pus gatherings can entail.
An Increased Awareness of Risk
"We've been made increasingly
aware of the risks we take every time
we throw a party," said Marcus
Smith, resident assistant for the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
These risks manifested them
selves quite clearly for the fraternity
community early in the school year
during a string of incidences — in
cluding violation of the Orientation
alcohol ban and the presence of un
derage drinkers at on-campus par
ties — that resulted in punitive ac
tion by the University administra
tion. While typically overlooked, the
latter problem became a big issue

when high school students alleged
ly returning from a party at Kappa
Sigma were caught driving under
the influence.
Such transgressions have result
ed in three fraternities — including
Kappa Sigma — being put on alco
hol suspension or alcohol proba
tion.
"During the first few events of
the year, some mistakes were
made," said Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Nanci Howe, whose office
oversees all student groups, includ
ing fraternities and sororities, and
must approve all campus parties.
She added that the increased pres
sure fraternities and other organi
zations are feeling to raise the level
of security at their parties is a result
of the accumulation of unfortunate
incidences — not an administrative
crackdown.
"The administration doesn't
watch parties," she said. "We ad
dress issues as they come to us," ei
ther from the police or other
sources such as RAs, staff or parents
of high school students.
Howe listed two main problems
as the motivation for increased se

curity this year.
First, "We've had difficulties with
underage high school kids getting
into parties," she said. Second, over
crowding, both inside and outside a
party, has become more of an issue
this year, she said. Some organiza
tions have discovered that both
problems can be at least partially
solved with the use of invite-only
parties.
Invite-only parties may become
more prevalent
"Stanford fraternities held a
meeting on Oct. 21 to address con
cerns about underage drinking at
parties all over campus," said Jor
dan Connors, president of the In
terfraternity Council. "Some chap
ters are considering holding more
closed parties."

Indeed, while fraternities have
traditionally been reluctant to in
crease the number of invite-only par
ties at the expense of all-campus par
ties, "the current climate of caution [is
forcing many chapters to work] hard
to ensure that students are safe at
their parties," Connors said.
Many students may remember
that, in the past, even when a party
required an invitation, it was not dif
ficult to get in without one. This year
the invite lists are being more strict
ly enforced.
"This year, if you're not on the
list, you're not getting in," Smith
said.
Smith said he believes that it's
"not worth it to throw all-campus
parties," adding that the fraternity
community as a whole may be start
ing to echo these sentiments.
In fact, a precedent may have
been set with the huge success of
SAE's invite-only party last week
end. According to Smith, the strict
adherence to the list created a safe

environment while still allowing for
a good time.
Other 'manifestations of
increased risks'
Throwing invite-only parties is
not the only solution to the situation.
According to Smith, there are
"two main manifestations of the in
creased risks": restricted-atten
dance parties and extra security
guards.
Private security guards have
never been a requirement for any
parties considered Level 3 or below
— in odier words, parties that admit
only Stanford students, not outside
guests. The Office of Student Activi
ties' party-planning guide only stip
ulates that there must be "at least one
trained security monitor" for every
50 attendees. The guards may be
volunteers, but must remain sober.
Howe notes, however, that
"some organizations are making
their own choices to hire private se
curity." In doing so, the organiza

tion that throws the party obtains
and pays for the private guards of
their own accord.
Many fraternities have made it a
habit to employ private security.
"We've always had security [at
SAE parties]," Smith said. However,
the fraternity voluntarily chose to in
crease the number of guards at their
last party from their usual four to six.
Dorm-based parties frequendy
employ the use of security guards as
well. Many students noticed the
presence of uniformed guards at
the Roble "Flashy Trashy" party last
weekend. Howe noted, however,
that party organizers see the guards
a* a-benefit, not an inconvenience,
since they can contribute gready to
the safety and success of an event.
While the current level of height
ened security may seem foreboding,
many hold an optimistic view for the
future. Most party organizers don't
want to see a switch to invite-only
events. Administrators, like Howe,
feel the same.
