## Football faces Pac-10 power USC Stanford's struggling offense will go head-to-head with one of the Pac-10's toughest defenses 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A bad snap to the punter, a costly personal foul,
a dropped pass, an arm tackle. Every football
team expects a few of these mistakes every week,
but the Stanford football team has been commit
ting all of these costly gaffes in concert, making it
impossible for the Cardinal (2-6, 1-4 Pacific-10
Conference) to have any chance at a win.
So head coach Buddy Teevens decided to
point out each of his team's mistakes this week,
with the hope that by confronting their errors,
the players would realize just what they have to
change to succeed.
"When you can point out select situations
that we didn't do this, if we do, success will fol
low," Teevens reasoned. "The reason our play
ers are as resilient as they are [is that] they see
that, 'If I would've caught that ball, we are first
and 10 on the 25. If I make that tackle on the
reverse, they're three and out.'"
To steal its fourth straight win against Southern
California, the Cardinal will need to do much more
than just make fewer mistakes. No. 10 USC (6-2,4-
1) comes to the Farm heavily favored after a bye
week and riding a three-game winning streak.
The Trojans' success this season has hinged
on the arm of quarterback Carson Palmer. In his
senior season, Palmer has finally performed at a

level consistent with his lofty expectations. He is
at ninth in the nation in passing, averaging 303
yards per game, and barring an early injury, he
will easily move into second place on t he Pac-10's
career charts in both total offense and passing.
He needs just 44 yards to eclipse former Stan
ford quarterback Steve Stenstrom in total of
fense and only (54 yards to pass onetime UCLA
standout Cade McNown in passing yardage.
USC's reliance on the pass does not bode
well for the Cardinal, whose pass defense sur
renders an average of 245 yards per game,
sixth in the conference despite the fact that
Stanford's opponents usually spend most the
second half running the ball.
While Palmer and the Trojan receivers have
exceeded expectations this season, Stanford's
passing attack has floundered. The Cardinal
ranks a disappointing last in passing offense
and has failed to break the century mark in
passing yards in its last two games.
The Cardinal will likely be without junior
quarterback Chris Lewis once again tomorrow,
though he practiced this week for the first time
since sustaining a shoulder injury in the team's
Oct. 19 win over Arizona. 1 hat leaves Stanford
with redshirt freshman Kyle Matter, who is ex
pected to start despite suffering a forearm in
jury that held him out of the majority of the sec
ond half last week at Oregon.
Matter's lack of confidence in the pocket is
one reason for Stanford's passing woes, but
breakdowns in the receiving corps and offen
sive line have done little to boost his stats.
"I wouldn't necessarily say [the problems in
the passing game] are a drop in his perfor
mance, but rather the offensive group as a

whole has to execute across the board for every
body to look good," Teevens said.
Stanford's highly touted receivers have strug
gled right along with their quarterback. Sopho
more I eyo Johnson was a preseason candidate
fort he Biletnikoff Award, presented annually to
college football's top receiver, but he has aver
aged just four catches and 45 yards per game.
Junior flanker Luke Powell has fared even
worse. Consistently bothered by a groin injury,
Stanford's big play threat has just 17 catches.
This week doesn't look like a breakout week
for Stanford, since the Trojans are allowing
fewer than 20 points per game, second-best in
the Pac-10.
Though the Cardinal's future looks bleak
right now, it is useful — or at least reassuring —
to note that Stanford found itself in a similar po
sition just four years ago, when it started the
1998 season with an even more discouraging
record (1-8) than this year. Still, under Tyrone
Willingham, that team was able to rebound and
win its final two games against Washington Suite
and California, setting the stage for the Cardi
nal's improbable 1999 Rose Bowl appearance.
While Stanford will be hard pressed to keep
up with the Trojans, one of college football's
hottest teams at this point in the season, the
Cardinal faces two very winnable games in the
weeks that follow. Stanford closes out the sea
son against Oregon State and Cal.
"They are intelligent guys," Teevens said of
his players. "They understand they are still
representing Stanford and have three more
opportunities to go out and have success, and
our expectation is [that] we are playing to win
every game."

Sophomore running back Kenneth Tolon, shown above, will try to help the
Cardinal grind out yards tomorrow. Because of the Trojans' strong sec
ondary, Stanford will need an effective rush to open things up downfield.
