# The 						sky belongs to Southern Cal
## Carson Palmer's aerial attack and a fearsome secondary propel Trojans 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the Southern California
football team (6-2, 4-1 Pacific-10
Conference), every game matters
down the stretch.
Only one game behind Washing
ton State (8-1,5-0), No. 9 USC has to
win out and hope for two Cougar
losses if the Trojans hope to make
the Rose Bowl, since they lost to
Washington Suite 30-27 on Oct. 5.
Nevertheless, for the defense,
it remains just one game at a time.
"We just want to end the streak
[of three consecutive Stanford
victories over USC]," Trojans cor
nerback Darrell Rideaux said.
"Going into the Farm, we cannot
look down the road. We have to
focus on this game."
Rideaux is a key part of a de
fense that hopes to match up with
the various abilities of the Cardi
nal receivers.
"They create a difficult match
up, but we are going to try to com
plement it," Rideaux said. "We
are going to try to match up talent
with talent, so I am primarily

going to cover the ever-elusive
Luke Powell. Powell is a deep
threat, while Teyo Johnson is
more of a physical possession
threat, so we are going to put
some size on Teyo."
Rideaux is one of many se
niors on a veteran defensive unit.
Troy Polamalu has been key at
safety, gaining national recogni
tion at the position. Polamalu is a
candidate for the 2002 Thorpe
Award for the nation's best de
fensive back.
Senior Mike Pollard has also
played well as a linebacker, tak
ing the role of one of the senior
leaders.
"We lead by committee,"
Rideaux said. "A bunch of guys
stepped up to make plays."
However, Polamalu will not be
playing at 100 percent on Satur
day since he is still feeling the ef
fects of a high ankle sprain. With
out him, the rest of the defense is
going to have to step up.
"With the rain, its going to be
a hard-nosed, low-scoring
game," Rideaux said. "It is going
to come down to who controls the
offense more."
Playing in the rain, the run is
going to be a crucial part of either
team's success on Saturday.

Junior quarterback Chris Lewis was unable to elude this USC defender during
the 2000 season, but he threw a game-winning touchdown on the game's last
play. Stanford would love for redshirt freshman QB Kyle Matter to do the same.
"Stanford plays sound foot
ball," Rideaux said. "They get a
lot out of their rotation, giving
them a balanced offense."
"They're really good up front,"
USC head coach Pete Carroll said
of Stanford. "They've got good
blockers, three returning line
men, a tight end, a big fullback
and a huge tailback. When they're
pounding away with [running
back Kerry] Carter, it's a lot of lire
power. They believe in the run
ning game, and they stay with it."
The same will be true for the
USC, offense, which will likely
start senior transfer Justin Fargas
in the backfield. Fargas trans
feree! from Michigan last year and
has been one of the biggest new
comers in the Pac-10.
For the USC defense, the key
tomorrow will be defending

against anything the Cardinal
throws at them.
"I'm a little uncomfortable
with how they're going to play
us," Carroll said. "We're going to
have to wait, and adjust during
the game and see what their
thoughts are. They tailor their
system to their opponents."
However, the way the USC, of
fense has been playing recently,
the USC> defense may not have to
worry. The Trojans are averaging
420.5 yards and 31 points per
game behind the strong play of
senior quarterback Carson
Palmer. With Palmer at the helm,
the USC offense has looked un
stoppable.
"I think he's playing great
football," Carroll saick "He's a
fantastic player. No different
than what I felt all along. He's
doing a tremendous job with the
system."
If the Stanford defense can't
slow Palmer down, how the USC
defense plays may be irrelevant.

up, but we are going to try to com
plement it," Rideaux said. "We
are going to try to match up talent
with talent, so I am primarily

going to cover the ever-elusive
Luke Powell. Powell is a deep
threat, while Teyo Johnson is
more of a physical possession
threat, so we are going to put
some size on Teyo."
Rideaux is one of many se
niors on a veteran defensive unit.
Troy Polamalu has been key at
safety, gaining national recogni
tion at the position. Polamalu is a
candidate for the 2002 Thorpe
Award for the nation's best de
fensive back.
Senior Mike Pollard has also
played well as a linebacker, tak
ing the role of one of the senior
leaders.
"We lead by committee,"
Rideaux said. "A bunch of guys
stepped up to make plays."
However, Polamalu will not be
playing at 100 percent on Satur
day since he is still feeling the ef
fects of a high ankle sprain. With
out him, the rest of the defense is
going to have to step up.
"With the rain, its going to be
a hard-nosed, low-scoring
game," Rideaux said. "It is going
to come down to who controls the
offense more."
Playing in the rain, the run is
going to be a crucial part of either
team's success on Saturday.

Junior quarterback Chris Lewis was unable to elude this USC defender during
the 2000 season, but he threw a game-winning touchdown on the game's last
play. Stanford would love for redshirt freshman QB Kyle Matter to do the same.
"Stanford plays sound foot
ball," Rideaux said. "They get a
lot out of their rotation, giving
them a balanced offense."
"They're really good up front,"
USC head coach Pete Carroll said
of Stanford. "They've got good
blockers, three returning line
men, a tight end, a big fullback
and a huge tailback. When they're
pounding away with [running
back Kerry] Carter, it's a lot of lire
power. They believe in the run
ning game, and they stay with it."
The same will be true for the
USC, offense, which will likely
start senior transfer Justin Fargas
in the backfield. Fargas trans
feree! from Michigan last year and
has been one of the biggest new
comers in the Pac-10.
For the USC defense, the key
tomorrow will be defending

against anything the Cardinal
throws at them.
"I'm a little uncomfortable
with how they're going to play
us," Carroll said. "We're going to
have to wait, and adjust during
the game and see what their
thoughts are. They tailor their
system to their opponents."
However, the way the USC, of
fense has been playing recently,
the USC> defense may not have to
worry. The Trojans are averaging
420.5 yards and 31 points per
game behind the strong play of
senior quarterback Carson
Palmer. With Palmer at the helm,
the USC offense has looked un
stoppable.
"I think he's playing great
football," Carroll saick "He's a
fantastic player. No different
than what I felt all along. He's
doing a tremendous job with the
system."
If the Stanford defense can't
slow Palmer down, how the USC
defense plays may be irrelevant.
