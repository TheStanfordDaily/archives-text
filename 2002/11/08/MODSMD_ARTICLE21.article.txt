# The
						sky belongs to Southern Cal
## Carson Palmer's aerial attack and a fearsome secondary propel Trojans 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the Southern California
football team (6-2, 4-1 Pacific-10
Conference), every game matters
down the stretch.
Only one game behind Washing
ton State (8-1,5-0), No. 9 USC has to
win out and hope for two Cougar
losses if the Trojans hope to make
the Rose Bowl, since they lost to
Washington Suite 30-27 on Oct. 5.
Nevertheless, for the defense,
it remains just one game at a time.
"We just want to end the streak
[of three consecutive Stanford
victories over USC]," Trojans cor
nerback Darrell Rideaux said.
"Going into the Farm, we cannot
look down the road. We have to
focus on this game."
Rideaux is a key part of a de
fense that hopes to match up with
the various abilities of the Cardi
nal receivers.
"They create a difficult match
up, but we are going to try to com
plement it," Rideaux said. "We
are going to try to match up talent
with talent, so I am primarily

going to cover the ever-elusive
Luke Powell. Powell is a deep
threat, while Teyo Johnson is
more of a physical possession
threat, so we are going to put
some size on Teyo."
Rideaux is one of many se
niors on a veteran defensive unit.
Troy Polamalu has been key at
safety, gaining national recogni
tion at the position. Polamalu is a
candidate for the 2002 Thorpe
Award for the nation's best de
fensive back.
Senior Mike Pollard has also
played well as a linebacker, tak
ing the role of one of the senior
leaders.
"We lead by committee,"
Rideaux said. "A bunch of guys
stepped up to make plays."
However, Polamalu will not be
playing at 100 percent on Satur
day since he is still feeling the ef
fects of a high ankle sprain. With
out him, the rest of the defense is
going to have to step up.
"With the rain, its going to be
a hard-nosed, low-scoring
game," Rideaux said. "It is going
to come down to who controls the
offense more."
Playing in the rain, the run is
going to be a crucial part of either
team's success on Saturday.

Junior quarterback Chris Lewis was unable to elude this USC defender during
the 2000 season, but he threw a game-winning touchdown on the game's last
play. Stanford would love for redshirt freshman QB Kyle Matter to do the same.
