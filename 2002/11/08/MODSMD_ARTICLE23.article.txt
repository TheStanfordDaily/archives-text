### 
Bowl Championship Series
mars tradition without
solving problems
It's been over a year since the
Stanford football team had
any cause to worry about the
Bowl Championship Series,
but its opponent in tomorrow's
home game, Southern California,
will bring some BCS talk to the

Stanford campus
for the first time
this year.
The Trojans (6-
2, 4-1) are ranked
No. 9 in the most
recent BCS stand
ings, trailing Pacif
ic* 10 Conference
frontrunner

Washington State (8-1, 5-0), which
checks in at No. 5.
The BCS is, of course, an unbe
lievably elaborate amalgam of press
polls, computer rankings, total loss
es, opponents' combined won-loss
record, opponents' opponents'
won-loss record and wins against
"quality" opponents. All that is de
signed to pit the two best teams in
the nation against each other in this
year's Fiesta Bowl for the national
tide, and to fill out the Rose, Sugar
and Orange Bowls.
Unless the Pac-10 winner quali
fies for the championship game
(the Fiesta Bowl), it will play in the
Rose Bowl this year regardless of its
BCS standing.
Since the BCS isn't going away
anytime soon — given that its con
tract runs through 2006 and that
there is an unbelievable amount of
money made off of the more than
two dozen bowl games played every

year — it seems likely that this year's
championship game, like last year's
will he fraught with controversy.
Last season, Nebraska, despite
not even winning the Rig 12's
North Division much less the entire
conference, &as tabbed by the BCS
as the best opponent to face top
ranked Miami in the Rose Bowl for
the national championship. The
Huskers were steamrolled 37-14 by
the Hurricanes, while third-ranked
Oregon demolished Colorado —
the team that beat Nebraska in the
Big 12 championship game — 38-
16 in the Fiesta Bowl.
So ineffectively labyrinthine is
the BCS that there was talk after
Oregon's victory on Jan. 1 that if
the 'Huskers upset Miami, Oregon
might actually split the national
championship, because, while the
coaches' poll is required to crown
the title game winner as the nation
al champions, the AP poll voters ac
tually get to cast their votes for who
they think is the best team. And had
the Huskers eked out a win against
Miami, the /VP almost surely would
have voted the Ducks as national
champions.
Now, as ridiculous as that is,
here on the Stanford campus, we
ought to have a litde more love for
the BCS than the Duck fans up in
Eugene.
After all, the BCS stipulates that
the six "original" BCS conferences
— the ACC, Big East, Big Fen, Big
12, Pac-10 and SEC — must send
at least one team to one of the BCS
bowls every year, regardless of each
respective conference champion's
place in the BCS standings. The
Rose Bowl is semi-exempt from
this, however: Unless it is the title
