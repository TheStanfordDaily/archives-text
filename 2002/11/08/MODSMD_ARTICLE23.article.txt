Bowl Championship Series
mars tradition without
solving problems
It's been over a year since the
Stanford football team had
any cause to worry about the
Bowl Championship Series,
but its opponent in tomorrow's
home game, Southern California,
will bring some BCS talk to the

Stanford campus
for the first time
this year.
The Trojans (6-
2, 4-1) are ranked
No. 9 in the most
recent BCS stand
ings, trailing Pacif
ic* 10 Conference
frontrunner

Washington State (8-1, 5-0), which
checks in at No. 5.
The BCS is, of course, an unbe
lievably elaborate amalgam of press
polls, computer rankings, total loss
es, opponents' combined won-loss
record, opponents' opponents'
won-loss record and wins against
"quality" opponents. All that is de
signed to pit the two best teams in
the nation against each other in this
year's Fiesta Bowl for the national
tide, and to fill out the Rose, Sugar
and Orange Bowls.
Unless the Pac-10 winner quali
fies for the championship game
(the Fiesta Bowl), it will play in the
Rose Bowl this year regardless of its
BCS standing.
Since the BCS isn't going away
anytime soon — given that its con
tract runs through 2006 and that
there is an unbelievable amount of
money made off of the more than
two dozen bowl games played every

year — it seems likely that this year's
championship game, like last year's
will he fraught with controversy.
Last season, Nebraska, despite
not even winning the Rig 12's
North Division much less the entire
conference, &as tabbed by the BCS
as the best opponent to face top
ranked Miami in the Rose Bowl for
the national championship. The
Huskers were steamrolled 37-14 by
the Hurricanes, while third-ranked
Oregon demolished Colorado —
the team that beat Nebraska in the
Big 12 championship game — 38-
16 in the Fiesta Bowl.
So ineffectively labyrinthine is
the BCS that there was talk after
Oregon's victory on Jan. 1 that if
the 'Huskers upset Miami, Oregon
might actually split the national
championship, because, while the
coaches' poll is required to crown
the title game winner as the nation
al champions, the AP poll voters ac
tually get to cast their votes for who
they think is the best team. And had
the Huskers eked out a win against
Miami, the /VP almost surely would
have voted the Ducks as national
champions.
Now, as ridiculous as that is,
here on the Stanford campus, we
ought to have a litde more love for
the BCS than the Duck fans up in
Eugene.
After all, the BCS stipulates that
the six "original" BCS conferences
— the ACC, Big East, Big Fen, Big
12, Pac-10 and SEC — must send
at least one team to one of the BCS
bowls every year, regardless of each
respective conference champion's
place in the BCS standings. The
Rose Bowl is semi-exempt from
this, however: Unless it is the title


Mark Thoma
game between the top two teams,
the Rose Bowl will always be Big
Ten vs. Pac-10, unless either or
both conferences send their cham
pions to the title game.
Thus, the 1999 Stanford squad
— which was not even ranked in
the 15-team BCS standings and
was ranked No. 22 in the AP poll,
but went 7-1 in conference to win
the Pac-10 — got to play Big Ten
champion No. 4 Wisconsin in the
Rose Bowl, just as it would have be
fore the BCS.
Though the Cardinal represent
ed the Pac-10 well, losing only 17-9,
there were many who decried the
fact that Stanford got to play in the

BCS while better, more deserving
teams were left to play in lesser
bowls. Wasn't the BCS supposed to
put the eight best teams in the four
best bowls, they argued?
Of course, this begs the question,
why on earth is there something
wrong with the Pat-10 champion
playing the Big Ten champion in
the Rose Bowl, regardless of what
the Colley Matrix computer rank
ings have to say about it? In my
mind, last year's Rose Bowl
matchup of Miami (Big East cham
pion) and Nebraska (Big 12 also
ran) was the true outrage.
Granted, the Rose Bowl began as
a supplement to ostrich racing when
the first game was played in 1902
(Stanford played in that first game,
too, although Michigan whipped the
Cardinal 49-0), but it is still the most
historic of all bowls. It makes no sense

to me to retain the bowl system (and
not go to a playoff like Division I-AA,
for example) but still bastardize
decades of tradition by making the
Rose Bowl — which has been a Big
Ten vs. Pac-10 showdown for over 50
years — something completely dif
ferent every fourth year.
And, really, it's just more proof
that the BCS is, to be trite, B.S. It
puts the wrong teams in the wrong
bowls, doesn't always match the two
best teams against each other for
the title and doesn't even guarantee
that the national championship
won't be split anyway.
College football is tiying to have
it both ways. It wants the money,
tradition and continuity of continu
ing to play all the classic bowls, but it
also wants to pretend that the bowl
system effectively decides who the
best team in the country is.

The reality is that the fairest op
tion would be a playoff system.
While the NCAA basketball tourna
ment demonstrates that playoffs
can have wild and crazy results,
with the "best" team often failing to
win the title, at least in a playoff the
top teams in the nation get to fight
for the national championship out
there on the field. If you're good
enough to make the tournament,
and you do nothing but win, you're
the champion. Once the top eight
or 10 teams were selected and seed
ed for the playoffs, computers and
polls would step aside and let the
teams settle it on the field.
It seems reasonable enough,
doesn't it?

can have wild and crazy results,
with the "best" team often failing to
win the title, at least in a playoff the
top teams in the nation get to fight
for the national championship out
there on the field. If you're good
enough to make the tournament,
and you do nothing but win, you're
the champion. Once the top eight
or 10 teams were selected and seed
ed for the playoffs, computers and
polls would step aside and let the
teams settle it on the field.
It seems reasonable enough,
doesn't it?

Bowl Championship Series
mars tradition without
solving problems
It's been over a year since the
Stanford football team had
any cause to worry about the
Bowl Championship Series,
but its opponent in tomorrow's
home game, Southern California,
will bring some BCS talk to the

Stanford campus
for the first time
this year.
The Trojans (6-
2, 4-1) are ranked
No. 9 in the most
recent BCS stand
ings, trailing Pacif
ic* 10 Conference
frontrunner

Washington State (8-1, 5-0), which
checks in at No. 5.
The BCS is, of course, an unbe
lievably elaborate amalgam of press
polls, computer rankings, total loss
es, opponents' combined won-loss
record, opponents' opponents'
won-loss record and wins against
"quality" opponents. All that is de
signed to pit the two best teams in
the nation against each other in this
year's Fiesta Bowl for the national
tide, and to fill out the Rose, Sugar
and Orange Bowls.
Unless the Pac-10 winner quali
fies for the championship game
(the Fiesta Bowl), it will play in the
Rose Bowl this year regardless of its
BCS standing.
Since the BCS isn't going away
anytime soon — given that its con
tract runs through 2006 and that
there is an unbelievable amount of
money made off of the more than
two dozen bowl games played every

year — it seems likely that this year's
championship game, like last year's
will he fraught with controversy.
Last season, Nebraska, despite
not even winning the Rig 12's
North Division much less the entire
conference, &as tabbed by the BCS
as the best opponent to face top
ranked Miami in the Rose Bowl for
the national championship. The
Huskers were steamrolled 37-14 by
the Hurricanes, while third-ranked
Oregon demolished Colorado —
the team that beat Nebraska in the
Big 12 championship game — 38-
16 in the Fiesta Bowl.
So ineffectively labyrinthine is
the BCS that there was talk after
Oregon's victory on Jan. 1 that if
the 'Huskers upset Miami, Oregon
might actually split the national
championship, because, while the
coaches' poll is required to crown
the title game winner as the nation
al champions, the AP poll voters ac
tually get to cast their votes for who
they think is the best team. And had
the Huskers eked out a win against
Miami, the /VP almost surely would
have voted the Ducks as national
champions.
Now, as ridiculous as that is,
here on the Stanford campus, we
ought to have a litde more love for
the BCS than the Duck fans up in
Eugene.
After all, the BCS stipulates that
the six "original" BCS conferences
— the ACC, Big East, Big Fen, Big
12, Pac-10 and SEC — must send
at least one team to one of the BCS
bowls every year, regardless of each
respective conference champion's
place in the BCS standings. The
Rose Bowl is semi-exempt from
this, however: Unless it is the title


Mark Thoma
game between the top two teams,
the Rose Bowl will always be Big
Ten vs. Pac-10, unless either or
both conferences send their cham
pions to the title game.
Thus, the 1999 Stanford squad
— which was not even ranked in
the 15-team BCS standings and
was ranked No. 22 in the AP poll,
but went 7-1 in conference to win
the Pac-10 — got to play Big Ten
champion No. 4 Wisconsin in the
Rose Bowl, just as it would have be
fore the BCS.
Though the Cardinal represent
ed the Pac-10 well, losing only 17-9,
there were many who decried the
fact that Stanford got to play in the

BCS while better, more deserving
teams were left to play in lesser
bowls. Wasn't the BCS supposed to
put the eight best teams in the four
best bowls, they argued?
Of course, this begs the question,
why on earth is there something
wrong with the Pat-10 champion
playing the Big Ten champion in
the Rose Bowl, regardless of what
the Colley Matrix computer rank
ings have to say about it? In my
mind, last year's Rose Bowl
matchup of Miami (Big East cham
pion) and Nebraska (Big 12 also
ran) was the true outrage.
Granted, the Rose Bowl began as
a supplement to ostrich racing when
the first game was played in 1902
(Stanford played in that first game,
too, although Michigan whipped the
Cardinal 49-0), but it is still the most
historic of all bowls. It makes no sense

to me to retain the bowl system (and
not go to a playoff like Division I-AA,
for example) but still bastardize
decades of tradition by making the
Rose Bowl — which has been a Big
Ten vs. Pac-10 showdown for over 50
years — something completely dif
ferent every fourth year.
And, really, it's just more proof
that the BCS is, to be trite, B.S. It
puts the wrong teams in the wrong
bowls, doesn't always match the two
best teams against each other for
the title and doesn't even guarantee
that the national championship
won't be split anyway.
College football is tiying to have
it both ways. It wants the money,
tradition and continuity of continu
ing to play all the classic bowls, but it
also wants to pretend that the bowl
system effectively decides who the
best team in the country is.

The reality is that the fairest op
tion would be a playoff system.
