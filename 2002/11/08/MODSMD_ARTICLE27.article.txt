### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
.After surpassing everyone's ex
pectations last season, except per
haps its own, tiie Stanford wrestling
team opens the 2002-2003 season
with a triangular' meet today against
Menlo College and Navy beginning
at 5:00 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

Wrestung
vs. Menlo College, Tonight, 5:00 p.m.
vs. Navy, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

The leadership of Amateur
Wrestling News' National Rookie
Coach of the Year Steve Buddie,
the impact of Newcomer of the
Year Matt Gentry and the team's
determination to garner some re
spect all added up to Stanford's first
winning season in 11 years last year
and the team producing four
NCAA qualifiers.
While some components of the
squad's push towards the top of
the Pacific-10 Conference are
gone, including NCAA qualifier
Levi Weikel-Magden, women's
national champion and USA
World Team member Patricia Mi
randa and heavyweight Brad
Selby, the Cardinal returns eight
starters and welcomes in another
talented freshman class for this
season's campaign.
"As a team, the expectation is
higher [than last year]." Buddie said.
"We finished 50th in the country last
year, and this team is convinced we
can half that and finish in the top 25."
If the Cardinal does reach that
goal and improve upon last year's
10-8 record in dual meets, the
team's two seniors, Justin Walker
and Harold Penson, will be a big

reason why.
Penson, one of the team's three
captains along with Gentry and
sophomore Brad Metzler, won 17
matches last season, including a
10-8 record in dual meets with
two falls.
Walker is coming off his second
straight 20-win season, which includ
ed three falls and his 50th career win
on the Farm.
After wrestling at 133 pounds hist
year, Walker will swap weight classes
with Metzler and wrestle at 141 to
start off the season.
"The change was a matter of per
sonal preference," Walker said. "Last
year I had a little trouble witJi 133,
and I think it affected me mentally
somewhat."
Outside of its two senior leaders,
die Cardinal remains a relatively
young, but talented team.
In his first season as a starter, Met
zler overcame time out with
mononucleosis to record 16 wins
and place fourth at the Pac-10
Championships in one of the confer
ences toughest weight classes to earn
an NCAA bid.
Gentry set the Stanford freshman
record for victories with 35 and had
a 16-mateh winning streak at the end
of the season, helping him qualify for
NCAAs.
"We have pretty much die same
exact team as last year," Gentry said.
" Hie guys who saw the success we
had last year are motivated to do
even better."
Gentry will move up one weight
class to 157 pounds to fill the vacancy
left by Weikel-Magden, who finished
second on the team in wins last year
with 27.

Harold Penson, shown wrapping up an Oregon State opponent last year, will
try to help lead the Cardinal to another surprising season. The senior is one
of Stanford's three captains this year.
"Losing Levi's experience and
attitude are costly, but we've got
guys who are absolutely ready to
take over where he left off," Bud
die said.
One of those guys is sophomore
Scott Policy, who managed to in
crease his strength while trimming
down over the summer, according to
Buddie. I'olley will open the season as
Stanford's starter at 149 pounds.
In the heavyweight division,
Selby's big shoes will be filled by red
shirt freshman Shawn Ritzenthaler.
"Brad was a good team leader,
but, at the same time, Shawn is very
athletically talented and is ready to
take the reigns at that weight,"
Buddie said.
The Cardinal will forfeit at 125,
as junior Nathan Peterson is sus
pended indefinitely while legal is
sues pertaining to his involvement
in an alleged rape last month pan
out. Peterson qualified for an
NCAA bid last season.
Stanford also be without
Gentry tonight, whose prepara
tion for the season was slowed
due to a sickness. He will most

likely be ready for the team's next
dual meet on Nov. 20. Sopho
more Garret Johnston will start in
Gentry's place.
Stanford will take on Menlo at
5:00 p.m. The Oaks are entering
only their second year with a
wrestling program and return nine
of the 10 starters who competed
against Stanford last January. 'Hie
Cardinal managed a2l -16 victory in
that match.
Later, Stanford will look to
avenge last year's 22-12 defeat to
Navy when they take the Mid
shipmen, who are led by senior
heavyweight Scott Kovach. Navy
finished 1 1-6 last year and
placed 36th overall at the NCAA
Championships.
Kovach finished one victory
shy of All-American status at
NCAAs. Seniors Luke Lazzo, Jim
Letchford and Mike Simon also
make Navy a tough early season
test for the Cardinal.
Given what the team proved it
could accomplish last season,
today will mark the first of many
challenges on the schedule the
Cardinal will meet head on and
expect to win.
"There is finally a belief in our
room that we should be better, ever)'
year and every day," Buddie said.
