### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
.After surpassing everyone's ex
pectations last season, except per
haps its own, tiie Stanford wrestling
team opens the 2002-2003 season
with a triangular' meet today against
Menlo College and Navy beginning
at 5:00 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

Wrestung
vs. Menlo College, Tonight, 5:00 p.m.
vs. Navy, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

The leadership of Amateur
Wrestling News' National Rookie
Coach of the Year Steve Buddie,
the impact of Newcomer of the
Year Matt Gentry and the team's
determination to garner some re
spect all added up to Stanford's first
winning season in 11 years last year
and the team producing four
NCAA qualifiers.
While some components of the
squad's push towards the top of
the Pacific-10 Conference are
gone, including NCAA qualifier
Levi Weikel-Magden, women's
national champion and USA
World Team member Patricia Mi
randa and heavyweight Brad
Selby, the Cardinal returns eight
starters and welcomes in another
talented freshman class for this
season's campaign.
"As a team, the expectation is
higher [than last year]." Buddie said.
"We finished 50th in the country last
year, and this team is convinced we
can half that and finish in the top 25."
If the Cardinal does reach that
goal and improve upon last year's
10-8 record in dual meets, the
team's two seniors, Justin Walker
and Harold Penson, will be a big

reason why.
Penson, one of the team's three
captains along with Gentry and
sophomore Brad Metzler, won 17
matches last season, including a
10-8 record in dual meets with
two falls.
Walker is coming off his second
straight 20-win season, which includ
ed three falls and his 50th career win
on the Farm.
After wrestling at 133 pounds hist
year, Walker will swap weight classes
with Metzler and wrestle at 141 to
start off the season.
"The change was a matter of per
sonal preference," Walker said. "Last
year I had a little trouble witJi 133,
and I think it affected me mentally
somewhat."
Outside of its two senior leaders,
die Cardinal remains a relatively
young, but talented team.
In his first season as a starter, Met
zler overcame time out with
mononucleosis to record 16 wins
and place fourth at the Pac-10
Championships in one of the confer
ences toughest weight classes to earn
an NCAA bid.
Gentry set the Stanford freshman
record for victories with 35 and had
a 16-mateh winning streak at the end
of the season, helping him qualify for
NCAAs.
"We have pretty much die same
exact team as last year," Gentry said.
" Hie guys who saw the success we
had last year are motivated to do
even better."
Gentry will move up one weight
class to 157 pounds to fill the vacancy
left by Weikel-Magden, who finished
second on the team in wins last year
with 27.
