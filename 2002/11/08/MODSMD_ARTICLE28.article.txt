Twenty-two talents, 22 different person
alities, 22 sets of strengths and weaknesses.
But only one goal.

vs. Fresno St., Tonight, 7:30 p.m.
vs. No. 6 UCLA, Sunday, 3:30 p.m.

And that is to win, as a team.
Any coach will tell you that regardless of
how simple that sounds, that's no easy task.
A team with incredible individual skill and
creativity can go far, but in a team-oriented
sport like soccer, having a competent coach
to put the puzzle pieces together is essential.
And as he has shown in his 21 years of
coaching, Stanford men's soccer head
coach Bret Simon fits this description.
In only his second year with the Cardi
nal, Simon has already established himself
as a man more than capable to lead Stan
ford to its first ever men's soccer NCAA
championship.
This weekend will serve as a large test for
this year's NCAA aspirations, as the Cardi
nal goes up conference rivals Fresno State
(5-8-4, 2-4-1 Pacific-10 Conference) and
No. 5 UCLA (11-2-2, 5-1-0) at Maloney
Field on Friday and Sunday, respectively.
Simon was able to guide Stanford to
within one game of the championship

match in his first season at the Farm, and
despite his team's recent struggles with Pac
-10 opponents, the No. 19 Cardinal (11-3-2,
2-2-2) is still considered a legitimate threat
for the College Cup.
Playing a big role in establishing Stan
ford as a national power is Simon's ability to
not just coach the players to become better
athletes, but to teach them to become better
people as well.
"My aim has always been to help these
student athletes become the best soccer
players and students," he said. "I want
them to be able to maximize potential in
all areas of life, which helps bring the
team together.
"When I first got into coaching, I didn't
realize the responsibility 1 had in the per
sonal development of an athlete," he con
tinued. "I used to concentrate on the
[sport] aspect of coaching, but now 1 like
to think of myself as more of a teacher and
a person who can help the athletes grow
and help the team develop into something
special."
His players certainly appreciate his
honest desire to develop them into some
body above and beyond just another soc
cer player.
"1 think the great thing about [Simon]
is the fact that he's real honest with his
players," said sophomore forward James
Twellman. "He is really upfront with us,
and he's always pushing every player to
make the best of everything and become
better."

Men's soccer coach Brett Simon directs practice. Simon has been in
coaching for three decades, and is in his second season at the helm of
the Cardinal.
ly as the school's men's soccer
coach and athletic director,
Simon broke into the Division I
coaching ranks with Creighton
University.
In six years at Creighton, he
led the Hluejays to two trips to the
College Cup, marking the
school's first-ever appearance in
any NCAA championship contest.
Despite having established
himself at Creighton, Simon
could not pass over the opportu
nity to coach at Stanford, replac
ing the popular Bobby Clark,
who left for Notre Dame two
years ago.
"At Creighton, it was a great
program, and the community
was very supportive," Simon re
called. "But then the opportunity
arose to come here. Stanford had
always been a dream position for
me. This is only place that 1
would have left Creighton for,
because of everything [it offers]:
its academic stature, great weath
er and the great possibilities for
team development."
Also coming along with the
move was the transition into the
always tough Pac-10, which has
provided more than enough
troubles for Stanford this year.
Three weekends ago, Stanford
came home from its last Pac-10
road trip with a 0-0 tie with Fres
no State and a 1-0 loss to UCIA.
That weekend was also the
start of Stanford's offensive
slump, which has seen the Cardi
nal go scoreless in its last four

games.
Although he admits that his
players may have lost some confi
dence, Simon points out that a
few missed shots were only inches
away from breaking the team's
scoreless streak.
"Either of [senior defender]
Todd [Dunivantfs free kicks last
week against California could
have easily been goals," he said.
"[The scoring drought] has not
been for lack of hunger. A bit is
luck, and (he teams we played
have been very disciplined defen
sively. The best we can do is to
keep trying, work very hard in
practice, stay loose and continue
to have fun."
Despite the offensive strug
gles, the Cardinal's defense has
been superb, allowing only three
goals in the last eight games, with
all three coming off restarts. The
defensive hot streak is especially
noteworthy considering the fact
that the team lost Dunivant fora
considerable stretch of that time.
Now with Dunivant back almost
to full health, the Cardinal will
lose freshman defender Chad
Marshall to the U.S. under-20
national team for this weekend's
matches.
With Stanford now in third
place in the Pac-10 and facing a
big uphill climb, sophomore de
fender Aaron Maines actually
likes the team's current situation.
"When we were at the top of the
conference, everybody was look
ing for us and had something to
prove," he said. "Teams thought
they got the better of us, but we're
not going let that happen again.
We're excited to get a second shot
at [UCLA and Fresno State]."
