Twenty-two talents, 22 different person
alities, 22 sets of strengths and weaknesses.
But only one goal.

Men's Soccer
vs. Fresno St., Tonight, 7:30 p.m.
vs. No. 6 UCLA, Sunday, 3:30 p.m.

And that is to win, as a team.
Any coach will tell you that regardless of
how simple that sounds, that's no easy task.
A team with incredible individual skill and
creativity can go far, but in a team-oriented
sport like soccer, having a competent coach
to put the puzzle pieces together is essential.
And as he has shown in his 21 years of
coaching, Stanford men's soccer head
coach Bret Simon fits this description.
In only his second year with the Cardi
nal, Simon has already established himself
as a man more than capable to lead Stan
ford to its first ever men's soccer NCAA
championship.
This weekend will serve as a large test for
this year's NCAA aspirations, as the Cardi
nal goes up conference rivals Fresno State
(5-8-4, 2-4-1 Pacific-10 Conference) and
No. 5 UCLA (11-2-2, 5-1-0) at Maloney
Field on Friday and Sunday, respectively.
Simon was able to guide Stanford to
within one game of the championship

match in his first season at the Farm, and
despite his team's recent struggles with Pac
-10 opponents, the No. 19 Cardinal (11-3-2,
2-2-2) is still considered a legitimate threat
for the College Cup.
Playing a big role in establishing Stan
ford as a national power is Simon's ability to
not just coach the players to become better
athletes, but to teach them to become better
people as well.
"My aim has always been to help these
student athletes become the best soccer
players and students," he said. "I want
them to be able to maximize potential in
all areas of life, which helps bring the
team together.
"When I first got into coaching, I didn't
realize the responsibility 1 had in the per
sonal development of an athlete," he con
tinued. "I used to concentrate on the
[sport] aspect of coaching, but now 1 like
to think of myself as more of a teacher and
a person who can help the athletes grow
and help the team develop into something
special."
His players certainly appreciate his
honest desire to develop them into some
body above and beyond just another soc
cer player.
"1 think the great thing about [Simon]
is the fact that he's real honest with his
players," said sophomore forward James
Twellman. "He is really upfront with us,
and he's always pushing every player to
make the best of everything and become
better."
Simon started his coaching career at
Berry College. After 13 years spent moÂ»i*
