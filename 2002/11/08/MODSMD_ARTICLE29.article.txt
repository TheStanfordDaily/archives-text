# Tom terrorizes Arizona as volleyball rolls

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volleyball team has al
ways aimed to keep its attack balanced between
the five capable starting hitters it has in its regular
lineup. But when you've got a player like three
time Ail-American outside hitter Logan Tom and
it's a night when she's clearly feeling it, it's hard to
come up with a better strategy than setting her
just about every ball.

Women's Volleyball
Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford def. No. 16 Arizona 3-0
vs. No. 24 Arizona State, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
at No. 1 Hawaii, Sunday, 6:00 p.m.

The No. 6 Cardinal (22-3, 12-2 Pacific-10
Conference) was content to stick with the obvious
last night.
Stanford took full advantage of a red-hot Tom,
who put down 26 kills to lead Stanford to a swift
three-game win over No. 16 Arizona (12-9,7-(i) at
Maples Pavilion.
Tom took 55 swings in the match, nearly half
of Stanford's attempts, but still managed to hit at
a .400 clip while also picking up a match-high
two aces.
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani
and junior middle blocker Sara McGee a>mbined
for 19 kills in the match, but it was Tom who was
clearly doing the damage from Stanford's side of
the court.
"Sometimes good players get on rolls that you
just don't want to bother interrupting," Stan
ford coach John Dunning said. "She's getting
kills at least every other set, and when someone
gets like that, you've just got to set them. They
were just guessing. They couldn't figure out a
way to stop her."
Tom really turned it on twice during the
match, starting strong with a ridiculous 11 kills
in the opening game and then finishing big with
six kills on the Cardinal's last nine points of the
third game.

stretches, despite outdigging Stanford 51 -44 in

Senior Logan Tom powers one of her 26 kills against Arizona last night. Stanford likes to rely on a bal

the match and holding with the
Cardinal's nation-leading block by
putting up eight blocks to Stan
ford's 12.5.
"When Logan wants to play,
she's the best player in the country,"
Arizona coach Dave Rubio said.
"We played the first two games
close, but the third game was a run
away. They were the better team
tonight, and Logan came to play."
The match marked the second
straight that the Cardinal has relied
on Lom to carry the team. Tom
picked up 28 kills in Stanford's 3-2
win over then-No. 1 Southern Cali
fornia last Saturday.
.Although the senior has proven
she can hold up the Cardinal's at
tack when she has to, she is looking
forward to Stanford getting back
to the more balanced system that
carried the team to the national

championship last year.
'I still think we should spread out
the offense more, because that will
help us out heading into the NCAA
tournament," Tom xud. "But we had
a lot of out-of-system balls, and that's
what me and Ogonna are there for."
While the Wildcats couldn't get
Tom to miss a step, the Cardinal was
able to neutralize Arizona's biggest
threat, outside hitter Kim Glass.
Glass' 28 kills helped Arizona
overcome a 2-0 deficit to win the two
teams' first meeting in five games on
Oct. 11 in Tucson. But last night,
the freshman was limited to just 12
kills and a .081 hitting percentage.
"We're trying to get into a better
transition phase with better digs,"
said sophomore defensive specialist
Leahi Hall, who came up with seven
digs for the Cardinal. "The back
row is trying to help out the front
row with better digs. We wanted to
take out their strongest hitter, so we
keyed in on [Glass] and got some
good results."
Despite Tom's huge output in

the opening game, the Cardinal was
unable to open up the game. Down
22-20, the Wildcats rallied behind
three kills from Glass to take five
straight points, but the Cardinal re
sponded with a five-point run of its
own behind three kills from Tom.
Stanford reached its first game
point at 29-28, but Arizona stayed
alive on a Nnamani hitting error.
Kills by senior outside hitter Lisa
Rutledge, the lone bright spot for
the Wildcats with team-highs of 16
kills and 11 digs, kept Arizona
going through the next three
Stanford game points, but a kill by
Tom finally sealed a 34-32 win lor
the Cardinal.
Several questionable calls frus
trated Stanford early in the second
game, and rocky passing didn't
make things any easier for the Car
dinal. Arizona was able to outhit
Stanford .292 to .283 in the game,
but Tom was there to boost Sum
ford again, rattling off both of her
aces during a five-point Cardinal
run that broke a 23-23 tie and put

Stanford on its way to a 30-26 win.
Stanford's passing got up to par
by the third game, and Arizona
was dead in the water as the Car
dinal led the whole way in a 30-19
final-game rout.
Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
made up fora dreadful hitting
night by picking up a team-high 1 1
digs for the Cardinal, while junior
middle blocker Jenn 1 larvey came
up with eight blocks to pad her Pac
-10-leading total in that category.
The Cardinal returns to
Maples tonight at 7:00 p.m. to
take on No. 24 Arizona State (10-
7,6-6).
Stanford crushed Arizona Suite
earlier this season, but the Cardinal
won't take anything lor granted.
"Arizona State is a scrappy
team," Tom said. "They touch a lot
of balls and they transition fast. One
of our big goals is going to be to out
dig them."
Stanford then travels to No. 1
Hawaii fora huge showdown on
Sunday.
