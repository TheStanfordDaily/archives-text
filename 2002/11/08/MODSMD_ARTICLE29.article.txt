# Tom terrorizes Arizona as volleyball rolls

### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volleyball team has al
ways aimed to keep its attack balanced between
the five capable starting hitters it has in its regular
lineup. But when you've got a player like three
time Ail-American outside hitter Logan Tom and
it's a night when she's clearly feeling it, it's hard to
come up with a better strategy than setting her
just about every ball.

Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford def. No. 16 Arizona 3-0
vs. No. 24 Arizona State, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
at No. 1 Hawaii, Sunday, 6:00 p.m.

The No. 6 Cardinal (22-3, 12-2 Pacific-10
Conference) was content to stick with the obvious
last night.
Stanford took full advantage of a red-hot Tom,
who put down 26 kills to lead Stanford to a swift
three-game win over No. 16 Arizona (12-9,7-(i) at
Maples Pavilion.
Tom took 55 swings in the match, nearly half
of Stanford's attempts, but still managed to hit at
a .400 clip while also picking up a match-high
two aces.
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani
and junior middle blocker Sara McGee a>mbined
for 19 kills in the match, but it was Tom who was
clearly doing the damage from Stanford's side of
the court.
"Sometimes good players get on rolls that you
just don't want to bother interrupting," Stan
ford coach John Dunning said. "She's getting
kills at least every other set, and when someone
gets like that, you've just got to set them. They
were just guessing. They couldn't figure out a
way to stop her."
Tom really turned it on twice during the
match, starting strong with a ridiculous 11 kills
in the opening game and then finishing big with
six kills on the Cardinal's last nine points of the
third game.
The Wildcats looked helpless during those
stretches, despite outdigging Stanford 51 -44 in

Senior Logan Tom powers one of her 26 kills against Arizona last night. Stanford likes to rely on a bal
anced hitting attack, but some nights it doesn't mind riding the All-American's hot hand.
