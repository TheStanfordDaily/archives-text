# CS prof debunks Gates Bldg. myth

### NATALIE SCHWARTZ 
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts debunked
one of the most widely circulated myths at Stanford
by revealing the truth about his relationship with Bill
Gates.
In 1992, a handful of generous donors provided
funding for the $38.4 million William Gates Com
puter Science building. The donors included indi
viduals such as J. Erik Johnson and William R.
Hewlett, as well as corporations such as AT&T and
Toshiba. Several other companies such as Sun Mi
crosystems and Intel provided equipment grants for
the state-of-the-art facility. Gates, neither a Stanford
graduate nor affiliate, gave the $6 million naming
gift.
After four years of construction, the building hous
es 21 labs, 13 meeting rooms and hundreds of offices.
Although the ranking of the donation relative to
other Stanford donors at the time is not public infor
mation, Susan Abernethy, in charge of Gates' gifts at
Stanford, asserts that the University "had raised
about 100 million around 1996... [Gates' $6 million
donation] was not one of the biggest gifts to Stanford
at the time."
However, given Gates' lack of direct connection
with the school, the reason for the gift has been the
subject of many myths.
