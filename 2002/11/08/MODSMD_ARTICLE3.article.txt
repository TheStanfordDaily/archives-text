# CS prof debunks Gates Bldg. myth
## 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ 
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts debunked
one of the most widely circulated myths at Stanford
by revealing the truth about his relationship with Bill
Gates.
In 1992, a handful of generous donors provided
funding for the $38.4 million William Gates Com
puter Science building. The donors included indi
viduals such as J. Erik Johnson and William R.
Hewlett, as well as corporations such as AT&T and
Toshiba. Several other companies such as Sun Mi
crosystems and Intel provided equipment grants for
the state-of-the-art facility. Gates, neither a Stanford
graduate nor affiliate, gave the $6 million naming
gift.
After four years of construction, the building hous
es 21 labs, 13 meeting rooms and hundreds of offices.
Although the ranking of the donation relative to
other Stanford donors at the time is not public infor
mation, Susan Abernethy, in charge of Gates' gifts at
Stanford, asserts that the University "had raised
about 100 million around 1996... [Gates' $6 million
donation] was not one of the biggest gifts to Stanford
at the time."
However, given Gates' lack of direct connection
with the school, the reason for the gift has been the
subject of many myths.

A report from the West Bank and Gaza
Diana Butto, legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, speaks at the Law School.
An article from The Stanford
Daily published April 25, 2000, re
ferred to a tour guide who used one
myth as part of a tour.
"Before dropping out of Har
vard, Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates was flunked by one of his pro
fessors, Eric Roberts," the article
wrote. "Eventually, this professor
made his way to Stanford to contin
ue teaching computer science, only
to find his office in the building of
his former flunkee, now the world's
richest man: the William Gates
Computer Science Building."
Many different versions of the
stoiy behind the Gates gift have cir
culated in recent years.
"I heard that Gates was so mad
that this teacher, who later became a
professor at Stanford, failed him
while he was a student at Harvard
that Gates donated the buildingjust
to rub his success in the face of his
former professor," reported one
student who toured Stanford in the
spring of2ooo.
Another student reported hear
ing that Gates named the building
in order to show off to a former Har
vard colleague.
Some time after the building was
dedicated, tour guides began circu
lating these rumors through the
hundreds of visitors and prospec
tive students that follow Stanford's
tours each week. Though it is un
clear where or when these legends
originated, it is now clear that they
are false.
Perhaps the guides were sick of
having no glamorous explanation
to visitors' inquiries about Gates'
reason for the gift. Roberts admits
that there is "enough grain of a
grain of truth [in his relationship
with Gates] to start such a story. I am
five years older than Gates and was
a teaching assistant at Harvard
while Gates was an undergrad."
Roberts, part of the Stanford
Computer Science faculty since
1990, did in fact know Gates. They
lived in the same dorm and were
both in the Computer Science De
partment. Although Roberts taught
some 17 courses as a TA, Gates was
never his student.
When Gates came to Stanford in
1996 for the dedication of his build
ing, Roberts reported, "1 don't
think he remembered me at first,
but it had been some 25 or 30
years."
After Roberts reintroduced him
self following Gates' dedication
speech, Gates recognized Roberts,

"Oh, you are the person who used
to fix the PDPI (a machine both
Gates and Roberts worked on at
Harvard)."
Evidently, Gates was unaware of
Roberts' whereabouts prior to the
dedication in 1996.
"Gates didn't even know I was at
Stanford. When he came to the ded
ication, he found out I was here,"
Roberts confirmed.
When one of his students asked
him about die myth several years
ago, Roberts was neither offended
nor insulted. He reported, laugh
ing, "It's a great story." Referring to
the many different versions, he
added, "I think it just grew in the
telling ... It's a 'telephone' story."
Roberts did, however, decide to
follow a tour to hear the story first
hand. He explained that he would
not attempt to find the originator of
the story.
"It's an urban legend. These
things don't have authors," he com
mented.
After the tour, Roberts informed
Visitor Information Services of the
false story that some tour guides
were retelling.
Senior Jackie Fang has been giv
ing tours for two years. She heard
one version of the Gates story on a
tour when she first became a tour
guide.
"During one of our tour-guid
ing meetings last year, someone
asked whether anyone knew for
sure whether or not the rumor
was true," Tang recalled. "And it
was confirmed that the rumor was
false."
Since then, the story has been
added to the "Wall of Myths"
housed in the Visitor Information
Services Office. Andrea Frost, man
ager of VIS since September 2001, is
responsible for maintaining the wall
in the tour office where 13 false leg
ends about Stanford are posted. She
works with Maggie Kimball, Univer
sity archivist, to stop misrepresenta
tions of any kind to Stanford visitors.
Frost reports that "there are
many urban legends on tours."
When interviewing for her current
position, Frost herself heard the
story on a tour. She feels that it is
particularly important that the Bill
Gates story be debunked.
"I think that it is really disre
spectful and it attaches a spiteful
and incorrect motive when all we
should be expressing our gratitude
for his [Gates'] donation," Frost
said. "While we may get a chuckle
out of the crowd [after telling a
myth], our business is neither enter
tainment nor the perpetuation of
rumors. What we say needs to be ac
curate above all."

Stanford, asserts that the University "had raised
about 100 million around 1996... [Gates' $6 million
donation] was not one of the biggest gifts to Stanford
at the time."
However, given Gates' lack of direct connection
with the school, the reason for the gift has been the
subject of many myths.

An article from The Stanford
Daily published April 25, 2000, re
ferred to a tour guide who used one
myth as part of a tour.
"Before dropping out of Har
vard, Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates was flunked by one of his pro
fessors, Eric Roberts," the article
wrote. "Eventually, this professor
made his way to Stanford to contin
ue teaching computer science, only
to find his office in the building of
his former flunkee, now the world's
richest man: the William Gates
Computer Science Building."
Many different versions of the
stoiy behind the Gates gift have cir
culated in recent years.
"I heard that Gates was so mad
that this teacher, who later became a
professor at Stanford, failed him
while he was a student at Harvard
that Gates donated the buildingjust
to rub his success in the face of his
former professor," reported one
student who toured Stanford in the
spring of2ooo.
Another student reported hear
ing that Gates named the building
in order to show off to a former Har
vard colleague.
Some time after the building was
dedicated, tour guides began circu
lating these rumors through the
hundreds of visitors and prospec
tive students that follow Stanford's
tours each week. Though it is un
clear where or when these legends
originated, it is now clear that they
are false.
Perhaps the guides were sick of
having no glamorous explanation
to visitors' inquiries about Gates'
reason for the gift. Roberts admits
that there is "enough grain of a
grain of truth [in his relationship
with Gates] to start such a story. I am
five years older than Gates and was
a teaching assistant at Harvard
while Gates was an undergrad."
Roberts, part of the Stanford
Computer Science faculty since
1990, did in fact know Gates. They
lived in the same dorm and were
both in the Computer Science De
partment. Although Roberts taught
some 17 courses as a TA, Gates was
never his student.
When Gates came to Stanford in
1996 for the dedication of his build
ing, Roberts reported, "1 don't
think he remembered me at first,
but it had been some 25 or 30
years."
After Roberts reintroduced him
self following Gates' dedication
speech, Gates recognized Roberts,

"Oh, you are the person who used
to fix the PDPI (a machine both
Gates and Roberts worked on at
Harvard)."
Evidently, Gates was unaware of
Roberts' whereabouts prior to the
dedication in 1996.
"Gates didn't even know I was at
Stanford. When he came to the ded
ication, he found out I was here,"
Roberts confirmed.
When one of his students asked
him about die myth several years
ago, Roberts was neither offended
nor insulted. He reported, laugh
ing, "It's a great story." Referring to
the many different versions, he
added, "I think it just grew in the
telling ... It's a 'telephone' story."
Roberts did, however, decide to
follow a tour to hear the story first
hand. He explained that he would
not attempt to find the originator of
the story.
"It's an urban legend. These
things don't have authors," he com
mented.
After the tour, Roberts informed
Visitor Information Services of the
false story that some tour guides
were retelling.
Senior Jackie Fang has been giv
ing tours for two years. She heard
one version of the Gates story on a
tour when she first became a tour
guide.
"During one of our tour-guid
ing meetings last year, someone
asked whether anyone knew for
sure whether or not the rumor
was true," Tang recalled. "And it
was confirmed that the rumor was
false."
Since then, the story has been
added to the "Wall of Myths"
housed in the Visitor Information
Services Office. Andrea Frost, man
ager of VIS since September 2001, is
responsible for maintaining the wall
in the tour office where 13 false leg
ends about Stanford are posted. She
works with Maggie Kimball, Univer
sity archivist, to stop misrepresenta
tions of any kind to Stanford visitors.
Frost reports that "there are
many urban legends on tours."
When interviewing for her current
position, Frost herself heard the
story on a tour. She feels that it is
particularly important that the Bill
Gates story be debunked.
"I think that it is really disre
spectful and it attaches a spiteful
and incorrect motive when all we
should be expressing our gratitude
for his [Gates'] donation," Frost
said. "While we may get a chuckle
out of the crowd [after telling a
myth], our business is neither enter
tainment nor the perpetuation of
rumors. What we say needs to be ac
curate above all."
Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts debunked
one of the most widely circulated myths at Stanford
by revealing the truth about his relationship with Bill
Gates.
In 1992, a handful of generous donors provided
funding for the $38.4 million William Gates Com
puter Science building. The donors included indi
viduals such as J. Erik Johnson and William R.
Hewlett, as well as corporations such as AT&T and
Toshiba. Several other companies such as Sun Mi
crosystems and Intel provided equipment grants for
the state-of-the-art facility. Gates, neither a Stanford
graduate nor affiliate, gave the $6 million naming
gift.
After four years of construction, the building hous
es 21 labs, 13 meeting rooms and hundreds of offices.
Although the ranking of the donation relative to
other Stanford donors at the time is not public infor
mation, Susan Abernethy, in charge of Gates' gifts at
Stanford, asserts that the University "had raised
about 100 million around 1996... [Gates' $6 million
