# Women hit court for exhibition game
## Injuries plague basketball squad heading into Love & Basketball matchup 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The sixth-ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team unofficially opens its season at
2:00 p.m. Sunday with an exhibition game
against Love & Basketball. But the Cardinal's
best player will still be on the bench in street
clothes, patiently waiting until she can make
her own season debut.
Junior forward Nicole Powell, a preseason

Women's Basketball
vs. Love & Basketball (exh.), Sunday, 2:00 p.m.
candidate for the Naismith National Player of
the Year Award, has been sidelined with a
bulging disk in her back since Stanford
opened practice in October and has yet to go
through a full practice with the team.
She first noticed the back pain while in
terning at Nike in Portland, Ore., in July. The
nagging pain plagued Powell fora while that
month, faded away and then flared up again
in October.
The most vexing aspect of the whole ordeal
is the star's uncertain timetable to return.
Powell will play, as coach Tara VanDerveer

says, "when [t he back] gets better."
In other words, Powell could be ready to go
any day now, or there's the absolute worst
case scenario: She might have to sit out the en
tire season if the injury doesn't relent.
Powell seems pretty at ease with the whole
situation, though.
"I have kind of prepared myself fora
month-to-six-week kind of thing," she said.
"Mentally, I'm not really frustrated."
Season-disruptive injuries haven't been
strangers to the Stanford team in recent years.
Redshirt sophomores Susan King and
Chelsea Trotter both sat out last year with
knee injuries, and the just-transferred Jamie
Carey missed two years with recur
ring concussions.
So Powell can take a little inspi
ration from seeing her teammates
battle back from such severe de
railments.
"I've just tried to keep things in
perspective, and it really hasn't
been too bad," she said. "I am just
thankful I still have my health and
can come back and play."
The bulging disk is the first fair
ly serious injury Powell has suf
fered in her basketball career.
"[Being an] athlete just speeds
up the process of your back going
out on you," she said. "I think 1
have really tight hips, [and] there's
a lot of pressure there, [so] it's just
the wear and tear."
Powell, in the meanwhile, has
only been able to work out in the
pool and participate in some light
shooting. All she can really do is
wait and hope for the best.
What Powell does know, how
ever, is that regardless of her phys
ical condition come her team's first
regular season game (against Rut
gers on Nov. 22), she won't be in
the lineup. That's because she was
suspended for the first game due
to a minor NCAA rules infraction.
The Stanford star played in a
summer league game which in
cluded a clock and referee — fac
tors which technically constituted a
breach of NCAA rule.
"I had a group of friends 1
wanted to play with," Powell said.
"I wasn't even thinking, obviously,
that I was going to break a rule and
be punished for it."
Meanwhile, the injury report
doesn't end with Powell's back
aches.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the only other junior on the se
nior-less squad, guard Katie
Denny, broke her hand in practice
and will be out six to seven weeks.
Additionally, freshman forward

Eziamaka Okafor, whom Van-
Derveer thought would give her
team a lift inside, suffered an ACL
tear in the summer and isn't ex
pected back before January at the
earliest. And, according to Van-
Derveer, neither King nor Trotter
is playing at 100 percent yet.
So with the Cardinal limping
around, the exhibition season takes

on a new importance. It will give
the coaches their first look outside
of practice at three freshmen—
guards Claire Bodensteiner and
Krista Rappahahn and center Shel
ley Nweke—whom the staff expects
to throw into the fire right away.

The sixth-ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team unofficially opens its season at
2:00 p.m. Sunday with an exhibition game
against Love & Basketball. But the Cardinal's
best player will still be on the bench in street
clothes, patiently waiting until she can make
her own season debut.
Junior forward Nicole Powell, a preseason

Women's Basketball
vs. Love & Basketball (exh.), Sunday, 2:00 p.m.
candidate for the Naismith National Player of
the Year Award, has been sidelined with a
bulging disk in her back since Stanford
opened practice in October and has yet to go
through a full practice with the team.
She first noticed the back pain while in
terning at Nike in Portland, Ore., in July. The
nagging pain plagued Powell fora while that
month, faded away and then flared up again
in October.
The most vexing aspect of the whole ordeal
is the star's uncertain timetable to return.
Powell will play, as coach Tara VanDerveer

says, "when [t he back] gets better."
In other words, Powell could be ready to go
any day now, or there's the absolute worst
case scenario: She might have to sit out the en
tire season if the injury doesn't relent.
Powell seems pretty at ease with the whole
situation, though.
"I have kind of prepared myself fora
month-to-six-week kind of thing," she said.
"Mentally, I'm not really frustrated."
Season-disruptive injuries haven't been
strangers to the Stanford team in recent years.
Redshirt sophomores Susan King and
Chelsea Trotter both sat out last year with
knee injuries, and the just-transferred Jamie
Carey missed two years with recur
ring concussions.
So Powell can take a little inspi
ration from seeing her teammates
battle back from such severe de
railments.
"I've just tried to keep things in
perspective, and it really hasn't
been too bad," she said. "I am just
thankful I still have my health and
can come back and play."
The bulging disk is the first fair
ly serious injury Powell has suf
fered in her basketball career.
"[Being an] athlete just speeds
up the process of your back going
out on you," she said. "I think 1
have really tight hips, [and] there's
a lot of pressure there, [so] it's just
the wear and tear."
Powell, in the meanwhile, has
only been able to work out in the
pool and participate in some light
shooting. All she can really do is
wait and hope for the best.
What Powell does know, how
ever, is that regardless of her phys
ical condition come her team's first
regular season game (against Rut
gers on Nov. 22), she won't be in
the lineup. That's because she was
suspended for the first game due
to a minor NCAA rules infraction.
The Stanford star played in a
summer league game which in
cluded a clock and referee — fac
tors which technically constituted a
breach of NCAA rule.
"I had a group of friends 1
wanted to play with," Powell said.
"I wasn't even thinking, obviously,
that I was going to break a rule and
be punished for it."
Meanwhile, the injury report
doesn't end with Powell's back
aches.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the only other junior on the se
nior-less squad, guard Katie
Denny, broke her hand in practice
and will be out six to seven weeks.
Additionally, freshman forward

Eziamaka Okafor, whom Van-
Derveer thought would give her
team a lift inside, suffered an ACL
tear in the summer and isn't ex
pected back before January at the
earliest. And, according to Van-
Derveer, neither King nor Trotter
is playing at 100 percent yet.
So with the Cardinal limping
around, the exhibition season takes

on a new importance. It will give
the coaches their first look outside
of practice at three freshmen—
guards Claire Bodensteiner and
Krista Rappahahn and center Shel
ley Nweke—whom the staff expects
to throw into the fire right away.
Stanford crushed Love & Bas
ketball last year, 96-48, in its sec
ond exhibition game.

Sophomore guard Kelly Suminski, shown driving against Tulane in the Car
dinal's second-round NCAA tournament victory last year, is one of many
younger players Stanford is expecting to play a big role this year.
