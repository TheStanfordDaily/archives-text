If the Cardinal has its way, though, they won't be
the last games at Maloney Field this year. Though the
the team won't hear anything until Monday, when
the NCAA tournament brackets are announced,
Stanford has every reason to consider itself in good
position for home-field advantage in the opening
rounds of the tournament.
The squad goes into this weekend's play with a 1(3-
1-0 record, including a 7-0-0 Pacific-10 Conference
mark. The record is good enough to put the Cardinal
on top of the Pac-10 standings, with a share of the con
ference crown — and an automatic berth into the
NCAA tournament — sitting just one win away.
But first, the Cardinal will have to take care of Ari
zona and Arizona State, this weekend's opponents. Co
coach Stephanie Erickson isn't worried about the team
looking past this weekend to the tournament, though.
"It's been business as usual this week, just like it's
been all season," Erickson said. "We're aware of what
certain results mean, but the team has done a great job
all season of getting things done
game by game, and I think that will
continue this weekend."
Stanford has run through the
Pac-10 thus far with flying colors,
conceding just one goal — last
weekend at Berkeley — in seven
games. By taking the first two games
of the season against Southern Cali
lornia and UCIA, both in Los An
geles, the team has been able to play
its games without being concerned
with (he rest of the conference.
"We've set ourselves up well,"
Erickson said. " Things are in our
control — that makes things a little
easier."
Nevertheless, Arizona and Ari
zona State present two formidable
opponents.
The Sun Devils, ranked No. 25
in the nation coming into this
weekend's play, bring in a record
of 11-4-2 (4-3 Pac-10). Riding the
speed of their two freshman strik
ers, Kli/abeth Bogus and Manya
Makowski, the Sun Devils have
gained respect around the confer
ence as a team t hat will attack early.
1 heir 18 first-hall goals on the year
prove it.
Arizona comes to the Farm with
a record of 6-10-1 (1-0 Pac-10), yet
has some momentum, thanks to its
double-overtime win last weekend
against Washington, which
snapped a six game Wildcat losing
streak. The Wildcats are also led by
a freshman striker, Kelly Nelson,
whose 13 goals lead the team.
Both visiting teams will be com
ing into a tough environment, as

the Stanford men's and women's
teams are both home this weekend
for the seniors' last home games.
The atmosphere at Maloney Field
should be electric as the two Stan
ford programs look to lock up their
NCAA berths at home.

"We're definitely looking for
ward to being home this weekend,"
Erickson said. "Being able to end
the Pac-10 season in front of our
own crowd, that's going to feel
good. It's a good way for us to send
our seniors off."

The action starts tonight as the
Cardinal takes on Arizona State at
5:00 p.m. at Maloney Field. Sun
day afternoon's 1:00 p.m. game
pits Stanford against Arizona in
this season's last regular-season
contest.
