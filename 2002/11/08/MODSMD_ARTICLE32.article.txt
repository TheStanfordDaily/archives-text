The Cardinal recorded wins in every
event against the Gators. The Stanford
men started strong with a 1-2 finish in the
200-yard medley relay and let the mo
mentum carry them through the dura
tion of the meet.
In the first individual event, the
1000-yard freestyle, freshman Mike
McLean touched first in nine minutes,
20 seconds. Cardinal teammate and fel
low freshn\an Andrew Peterson finished
second in 9:46.91.

"The freshmen all pulled through
with awesome performances in their first
dual meet of the season," senior co-cap

had two wins, and Tobias [Oriwol] had
three. We were all very impressed by
their performances."
McLean earned his second win in the
500 free, and Oriwol recorded victories in
the 100- and 200-yard backstroke events
as well as the 200 individual medley.
In the 200 free, sophomore Thomas
Brown clocked in at 1:42.67, out-touch
ing sophomore teammates Rick Yang
and Eric Dilulio. Stanford also swept the
top three spots in the 100 breast, as senior
Pat Fowler and freshmen Rick Eddy and
Nick Wolfe finished in 57.25, 57.71 and
1:00.36, respectively.
"We really had great team energy through
the entire meet, and it was a great way to start
off the season," Waters said. "Hopefully we
can keep tliis energy going through the win
ter and into the [Pacific-10 (Conference] and

NCAA championships in March."
Despite the pouiing rain,junior Nick Bott
braved the weather to secure a victory in the
200 butterfly with a time of 1:53.90. Fresh
men Michael Passey and Mark Stephens fin
ished second and third in that event in

erhouse scored easy victories in the 50,100
and 500 freestyle events, the 200 back, 200
breast, 100 fly and the 200 individual med

free relay, Stanford swam to a first-place
finish, 15 seconds ahead of the SFSU team.
The coaching staff could not be happi
er with the Cardinal's performance.
"Considering the weather conditions,
our team did very well," assistant coach
Rob Siu said. "Mike McLean went a life
time best in the 1,000 free, and overall,
we did a lot better than we did last year at
this meet. The guys are really looking
good in the water."
