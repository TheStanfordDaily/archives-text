# Stanford students impress in marathon
## Daly and Sinsky both qualify for the Boston Marathon in April 
### JESSICA WANG 
Stanford students Megan Daly
and Carolyn Sinsky recently took
top honors at the Silicon Valley
Marathon on Oct. 27.
Megan Daly, a 23-year-old
Stanford Medical School student,
finished first in the women's over
all division, with a time of 2 hours,
53 minutes, 5 seconds. Carolyn
Sinsky, an 18-year-old freshman,
finished sixth overall and first in
her age group with a time of
3:19:26. Both qualified for the
Boston Marathon in April, beating
the qualifying time of 3:35.
Daly is originally from Salem,
Ore., where she was a gymnast in
high school. She did not start run
ning until her freshman year at
Stanford when she wanted to stay
in shape, and she eventually be
came very involved in the Stanford
Running Club. She ran her first
marathon, at Big Sur, as a sopho
more and now has run a total of

five marathons.
Interspersed among the
marathons, Daly has run in sever
al 5-and 10-kilometer races and a
few half-marathons. Most recent
ly, she ran the Microsoft Trailblaz
er 10K. race in Mountain View in
October, plac ing first overall with
a time of 37:12.
Daly runs year round, and in
the months before a marathon,
builds up her mileage to about 60
to 65 miles a week.
"Training fora marathon pro
vides a wonderful opportunity to
set a goal and work toward it,"
Daly advised those running for the
first time. "There's really no feel
ing like crossing the finish line for
the first time."
Daly majored in biology as an
undergraduate and then took a
year off after graduating to work in
a gravitational biology lab at NASA
Ames at Moffett Field. She is cur
rendy a first-year medical student

interested in neuroscience and
neurology in addition to pediatrics.
In her free time, Daly volunteer
at the Arbor Free Clinic and is in
the medical school PALS program,
which pairs medical students with
chronically ill children at Packard
Children's Hospital.
The Silicon Valley Marathon
was Carolyn Sinsky's first
marathon, although she did
both cross country and track in
high school.
"Running isn't as bad as most
people think it is," Sinsky said.
"After awhile it gets pretty fun,
actually addicting, which defi
nitely makes training easier.
Runner's high is real, especially
for long distances—sort of like a
drug. Whatever it is, I've definite
ly become dependent."
Sinsky is looking forward to
training in more running-con
ducive weather.
"California winters are looking

pretty good too, coming from
lowa," she said. "No more running
in a snowsuit and boots. Yes!"
Sinsky said that she may run the
Boston Marathon, widely consid
ered one of the most important
long-distance running events in
the world, with her parents.
Daly is still figuring out her
plans.
"I definitely want to [run in the
Boston Marathon] at some point,
but I'm not sure if I will this
year," Daly said. "It might be a lit
tle difficult to fit a trip to Boston
in with medical school, and I
think that I might like to work on
lowering my times a little over the
next year or so.
"Boston is supposed to be amaz
ing, but it's not a particularly fast
course, with the crowds of runners
and a couple of big hills. I'm think
ing more seriously about the Los
Angeles marathon for this spring
or Napa Valley again."
