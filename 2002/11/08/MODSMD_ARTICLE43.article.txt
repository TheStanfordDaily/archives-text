# "Lily Chou-Chou"
## Tortured teens take refuge in bad music 
### NICK STONE 
The only good part of the day

Fora crash course in the state of Japan
ese youth culture, you can't really beat "All
About Lily Chou-Chou." "Hie film is shot
almost entirely on the newest, spiffiest dig
ital cameras, and with director Shunji
Iwai's penchant for music video-style cuts
and cyber-anything, "Chou-Chou" is
flashy, dreamlike and very television. Yes,
I am using 'television' as an adjective.
"Chou-Chou" has the look and feel of a re
ally, really well executed made-for-TV
movie — a 146-minute extravaganza of
adolescent alienation, vicious bullying,
petty crime, teenage rape and prostitution
.and the lazy crazy days of summer vacation
(in Okinawa). The film also tackles the ar
bitrary-but-ironclad social hierarchy that
we all remember so fondly from our own
days as awkward, mo<xly 13-year-olds.
Lily Chou-Chou (say fshoo-shoo") is a
fictional pop star, apparently modeled on
Hong Kong diva #1, Faye Wong, but

more closely aligned
with the likes of Tori
Amos or Japan's own

J l
Chara. Our protagonist

r o
Yuichi is Lily's
biggest fan; like
many eighth-graders
in any media-saturat
ed country, pop
music is his lifeline.
We are introduced to

his obsession through the Internet chat
room scene: The film is punctuated by
keyboard clacking as chat room messages
scroll across the screen, discussing and dis
secting Lily's music in the painfully earnest
and melodramatic terms that teenagers re
ally do use. (Before I go any further I must
note that Lily's music is absolutely terrible,
a watered-down version of J-pop's most
banal and angsty moments, which is prob
ably as it should be — the musk that kept
most of us afloat in eighth grade was just as
contrived, and Lily's mediocrity somehow
makes Yuichi's fiisrination that much more
endearing. Besides, you don't actually
hear too much of her music; most of the
film score is Debussy, who has never
sounded so creepy.)
The film is both subtle and intense,
narcotic and violent; it has a quiet
strength and smooth, languid pace that
caught me off guard. "Chou-Chou" takes
an unflinching and only slightly sensa
tionalistic look at the bizarre state of
Japanese youth culture ... the tanned,
bleached-blonde surfer-dude tough
guys; the iconic coolest-girl-in-school
with five or six identical cronies hanging
on her every word; the shy, sullen boys
next-door whose lives revolve around
video games, bikes, and shoplifting.
Everyone's here, dressed to the nines
and with perfect hair, but with no place to
go and nothing to do but grow up fast
and enlist.

They enlist, because while Japan may
have no standing army, Japanese capital
ism demands soldiers: legions of men and
women in painstakingly! perfect uniforms,
stuffed into trains and deployed to offices
and department stores, performing their
duties and routines with the utmost disci
pline and efficiency. This transition from
the sweet, sunny comfort of childhood to
the militaristic pressures of adult life hap
pens almost instantly for most Japanese
youth, and from the looks of "Chou-
Chou," not without a certain bittersweet
gasp of confusion and denial.
The film is a wee bit too poetic and pol
ished for its own good: It follows the con
ventions of Japanese teen dramas and
music videos too closely to be really effec
tive as an emotional broadcast. Then
again, "All About Chou-Chou" is clearly
more a meditation on adolescence than a
legible message about it, so maybe the
film's sleek ambiguity is commendable.
In any case, you may have noticed that
in the last 500 words I haven't said much
about the plot: That's because "Chou-
Chou's" narrative is completely fragment
ed and non-sequential, leaving linear con
tinuity on the cutting room floor in favor of
brief, revealing episodes and a sense of tim
ing straight out of dreams, This works in its
favor, but it makes a synopsis impossible.
All the more reason to see the film; I'll
wager it's the best Japanese TV show you'll
ever watch.

ally do use. (Before I go any further I must
note that Lily's music is absolutely terrible,
a watered-down version of J-pop's most
banal and angsty moments, which is prob
ably as it should be — the musk that kept
most of us afloat in eighth grade was just as
contrived, and Lily's mediocrity somehow
makes Yuichi's fiisrination that much more
endearing. Besides, you don't actually
hear too much of her music; most of the
film score is Debussy, who has never
sounded so creepy.)
The film is both subtle and intense,
narcotic and violent; it has a quiet
strength and smooth, languid pace that
caught me off guard. "Chou-Chou" takes
an unflinching and only slightly sensa
tionalistic look at the bizarre state of
Japanese youth culture ... the tanned,
bleached-blonde surfer-dude tough
guys; the iconic coolest-girl-in-school
with five or six identical cronies hanging
on her every word; the shy, sullen boys
next-door whose lives revolve around
video games, bikes, and shoplifting.
Everyone's here, dressed to the nines
and with perfect hair, but with no place to
go and nothing to do but grow up fast
and enlist.

They enlist, because while Japan may
have no standing army, Japanese capital
ism demands soldiers: legions of men and
women in painstakingly! perfect uniforms,
stuffed into trains and deployed to offices
and department stores, performing their
duties and routines with the utmost disci
pline and efficiency. This transition from
the sweet, sunny comfort of childhood to
the militaristic pressures of adult life hap
pens almost instantly for most Japanese
youth, and from the looks of "Chou-
Chou," not without a certain bittersweet
gasp of confusion and denial.
The film is a wee bit too poetic and pol
ished for its own good: It follows the con
ventions of Japanese teen dramas and
music videos too closely to be really effec
tive as an emotional broadcast. Then
again, "All About Chou-Chou" is clearly
more a meditation on adolescence than a
legible message about it, so maybe the
film's sleek ambiguity is commendable.
In any case, you may have noticed that
in the last 500 words I haven't said much
about the plot: That's because "Chou-
Chou's" narrative is completely fragment
ed and non-sequential, leaving linear con
tinuity on the cutting room floor in favor of
brief, revealing episodes and a sense of tim
ing straight out of dreams, This works in its
favor, but it makes a synopsis impossible.
All the more reason to see the film; I'll
wager it's the best Japanese TV show you'll
ever watch.
