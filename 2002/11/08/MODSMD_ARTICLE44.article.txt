# Documentary of Palestinian youth flawed, but wrenching
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
You ought to see what it's like being on
this end of an entertainment rag. The

press releases make it seem like
everything that comes through r
the Intermission office will '
change your life. Why? Because
it's in the finest tradition of
Kubrick and Fellini! Destined to
define a generation like the Bea
tles! Certain to leave an indelible
mark on the world's culture!
Reminiscent of Dylan! The mod-

ern day "Citizen Kane!"
And the frustrating thing is, there are
writers who believe this shit and allow their
combination of ignorance and laziness to
show through in their articles. Often de
scriptions are shamelessly lifted straight
from the press packet that hundreds of
other reviews also received. To say some
thing new about a film is not that difficult.
But if this claim is really true, then why do
I have such difficulty saying something
about "Gaza Strip?" Ultimately, I think, it
is because this is a film that must be seen to
be understood.
In shooting the film, director James
Longley chose to focus on a 13-year-old
Palestinian boy named Mohammed Hejazi
who has lived in the Gaza Strip his whole
life. Longley follows Mohammed over the
course of several months and the film
splices together this footage in roughly
chronological order beginning a few
months before the Intifada through Ariel
Sharon's election as Israeli prime minister.
Longley's focus on Mohammed as a central
character, however, can be deceptive be
cause it is very clear that he intends to tell
the story of the Palestinian people. The boy
himself is a living metaphor for his com

munity, and "Gaza Strip" begins to take off
once this fact is clear.
Mohammed loses his innocence as a

child early in the film when
one of his stone-throwing
nds is killed in a skirmish
with Israeli troops. Soon,
Sharon is elected and Mo
hammed elicits laughs
while grumbling over the
headlines in the newspa
pers he sells fora living.
"Sharon, I love you!" he de
clares mockingly before

laying a wet one on the man's picture on
the front page. A minute later, one of the
Palestinian men notes that Arafat looks sad
in the newspaper. Mohammed replies,
"Fuck Arafat!" And then, in the type of
tirade you'd expect from a 13-year-old,
"Arafat takes it in the ass!"
As the assaults escalate, Longley gives
us grueling footage of Palestinians con
vulsing from an Israeli gas attack following
the demolition of some apartment build
ings. And then, in one of the most jaunt
ing images of "Ga/a Strip," Longley shows I
a young boy in the emergency room,
whose entire abdomen has been blown out
by a bomb, which the Israeli Kr<jops left in

a boxing glove for the children.
"Gaza Strip" is eeriest, however, when
we see Mohammed, near the end, reflect
ing on his prospects in the hereafter.
Whether he continues living or dies while
throwing stones in one of the battles, Mo
hammed concludes that he will go to hell.
God, he says, will never forgive him for
attacking his ancestral cousins, the Jews.
This fatalistic statement sears the desper
ation of the entire situation into our col
lective conscience.
I will tell you right now that "Gaza

Strip" is a flawed documentary. It drags
near the end. It leaves you unsatisfied,
just like this review. It almost made me
vomit with revulsion, and it made the
lady next to me begin crying. But these
are all characteristics of the protracted
war between the Israelis and Palestinians,
and that is what makes "Gaza Strip" so
compelling.

Violence, confusion, fatalism and occasional humor punctuate the
life of Mohammed, the 13-year-old focus of "GazaStnp^^*'
