# The
						magical glory of pearl milk tea
## 
### SHAWN STANDEFER 
Pearl milk tea is something that I discovered
bnly after arriving in California. The drink,
which at first seems unappealing, is magically
delicious. Take some milk tea and add tapio
ca pearls, and you have pearl milk tea, PMT for short.
I t(x)k it upon myself to try various places near Stan
lord and let the masses know what 1 thought of them.
The Gods of Intermission said I could do this
article and then told me, "You must try the
Tresidder pearl milk tea! Bwahaha ..." On
that ominous note, I headed over to the Corner
Pocket. I overcame my worries and ordered a
standard green milk tea. It was a visual shock;
there were weird chunks floating in it, and it was
one of the most unnatural colors I have ever
seen. Despite this, I took a sip, which caused my
tongue cry out in pain. The tea itself tasted like
an unholy mixture of sugar and saccharine and
distilled grossness. " The pearls may redeem it,"
I thought. How wrong I was. The pearls were
reminiscent of ass-flavored taffy. After recover
ing, I realized just how important it was to inform
clueless Stanford students about real pearl milk tea.
Here, for your pleasure, are some of the bumpinest
PMT places in the area.

Black Pearl
Located 011 California Avenue, Black Pearl gives
neat student discounts, and they also have video
games, checkers and two big couches. 1 had a black
pearl milk tea and a coconut milk tea. Both were real
ly tasty, tea-wise and pearl-wise. On top of that, they
sell other snack food, ramen, s«x>p ice cream and
mochi ice cream. If you've never tried mochi ice
cream, it is worth a trip over to Black Pearl to taste it. It
is ice cream wrapped in mochi, which is a kind of
Japanese rice dough. Ice cream in finger food form:
How cool is that? On a side note, avoid any of the sucky
citrus flavor milk teas. Also, there's a lot of high school
ers that show up. lliey irritate me to 110 end, but
they're definitely a part of the Black Pearl environ
ment.

@lioe Cafe
This PMT place is located 011 University Ave. The
teas taste good, and they have a large selection, but
their itsy-bitsy pearls ruin die beautiful tapestry that is
pearl milk tea. 'I"hey get points for the über-ccx)l prac
tice of sealing the cup with a lid of cellophane. It is fun
to stab the straw through that cover to get at the sweet
drink held within. @Live is a gtxxl place to go if you
have a PMT craving but 110 way to get to a letter place,
lliey have some ice cream if you don't dig the PMT.
The store itself is on the small side, but they have some
neat Chinese fashion magazines laying around that
provide endless entertainment.

Q-Cup
Q-Cup, in Cupertino Village, wins as my favorite.
The store has pop, cartoony decor with techno
music. Their selection is huge and cheap, around
$2.50-$2.75. The most notable non-PMT refresh
ment they have are the heavenly crepes. Big, soft, ice
cream-and-other-stuff filled crepes. While my eyes
were glued to the crepes, I got a jasmine pearl tea and
also tried a coconut milk tea. They both rocked. The
pearls are the perfect size, with a good flavor and con
sistency to boot. On top of all this, Q-Cup seals their
PMT with the plastic covering. STAB! Sweet.
Atmosphere: 4 stars PMT: 5 stars Other stuff: 5 stars
Verde Tea House
At Verde on Castro Street, the PM T is comparable
to Q-Cup's. This place gets packed to the brim on
weekends and serves some really tasty thick toast wit h
peanut butter. Along with PMT, Verde Tea is bright
green inside and stays open late into the evening. It
was here that I lost my PMT cherry, so there is a spe
cial place in my heart for Verde Tea House.
