# Crave caffeine? Get your booty off campus!
## 
### JENNY MILLER 
So you're craving caffeine and a hip
hangout, the CoHo leaves you unful
filled, but you'd like to stay close to home.

Look no further, friend. This
dutiful reviewer has scoured
local coffee joints to find the
best nearby places to get a
good cup of joe, and more. So
grab your books or your
friends, your bike or your car,
and get thee to a coffee house!

Lucu's Tea House

It's located in an alley behind Verde Tea House, 011
Villa Street off Castro. Lucy's wins the Neat Atmos
phere Award. It has mad ambience. Lucy's has a large
stock of board games. I thought it was incredibly fun to
play Go while sipping my tea. The Indian milk tea and
the Thai milk tea were both tasty, 'llie pearls are also a
good size and flavor. Although they do PMT well, their
selection is limited. I'd recommend checking out die
tea floats, which are PMT with a scoop of ice cream in
them. Check this place out, but be warned: the PMT is

a steep $4 unless you
get it to go, then it

drops mysteri
ously to $2.50.
Either you

pay more
or you miss
out on the
coolest part
of Lucy's.

Atmosphere: 5 stars PMT: 4
Stars Other stuff: 5 stars

After a whirlwind
week of PMT compari-

son, I think that Q-Cup is
my favorite. They do everything

right. It is far away, but worth the trip. Lucy's is
the coolest joint to chill at with some friends. Fail
ing that, Black Pearl is still pretty good. I would

say that it
rocks all
right. In
closing, try

some pearl milk
tea but please avoid Tresid
der PMT. It hurts.

S Bakery and Tea House
Cafe
220-B University Ave.
The Lowdown: A recent ad
dition to the local coffeehouse (and
pearl milk tea) scene, S Bakery and
Tea House Cafe deserves to be
come a favorite among Stanford

students. Its friendly decor, perfect people
watching location, good selection of magazines
and appetizing eats invite you to come in and
stay awhile.
The Scene: The Tea House attracts mostly
a youngish crowd: students, young profession
als and their laptops, or pairs of friends.
The Fare: Featured at the Tea House are cakes
and pastries which look as scrumptious as they
taste. Most menu items l(x)ks great fora snack or
a light lunch: soups, salads, sandwiches, as well as
espresso, teas and other dessert drinks, Hie pearl
milk tea is the tastiest I've had in Palo Alto.
The Last word: Great for studying, relaxing
or socializing.

The Prolific Oven
550 Waverly, Palo Alto
The Lowdown: A freshman-year haunt of
mine, this old standard is still a fun, cute place
to get some decent espresso and yummy pas
tries. The cheery oak furniture, including an

old-fashioned glass pastry display
case and charming mismatched ta
bles and chairs, give the impression
that this place has been around
awhile - and it has.

The Scene: No need
to dress up fora visit here.
The Prolific Oven has a fam
ily-owned, casual feel —
even the high school kids be-

hind the counter sport jeans. The place at
tracts families, older folks, younger folks as
well as "non-traditional" customers. (I en
countered a tarot card reading group on my
last visit).

The Fare: The menu is pretty limited,
so head somewhere else if you're not
in the mood lor baked goods. Those

who want to indulge will be at home here,
though. The cakes win awards every year, and
the croissant I had on my recent visit was flaky
and delicious.

The Last Word: Not the greatest place for
studying or staying very long

— the wooden chairs quick
ly start to get uncom-

fortable and noise
reverberates quite a
bit inside, making it
too loud to study at

times. Drop by the Prolific Oven with friends
when yon want to satisfy that sweet tooth —
you won't be sorry.

Happy Donuts
3916 El Camino Real

The Lowdown: An establishment among
Stanford insomniacs, Happy Donuts turns out
tasty donuts and good coffee all night long.
The Scene: Kids studying dominate the ta
bles in the evening. During my last visit, a
band of high school kids had taken

over one side of the shop,
while on the other

side a man studied
Esperanto and
anot h e r
poured over

l
organic
chemistry.
According to

The Last Word: Unlimited access to caf

Cafe Borrone
1010 El Camino Real, Merxlo Park
The Lowdown: A favorite area hangout for
over 10 years, Cafe Borrone attracts its loyal
following as much for its happening atmos
phere as for its tasty coffee and food. Finding
a table in the European-style outdoor plaza is
the hard part — enjoying yourself there is a
cinch!
The Scene: Families, professionals and stu
dents frequent Borrone's. Morning and after
noons are fairly slow, but around meal-

times, watch out — it can get
crowded, especially on

nice days.
The Fare:
Cafe Borrone is
hnfh a rnffee

twin a Louee
shop and a
restaurant, and
its order-at-the-

counter setup,
along with tons
of seating, invites
patrons to stay as

long as they like.
Sandwiches, salads

and most food items run
between five and! 0 dollars, though by

ccononii/iug, a. snack and a tasty espresso
dtinkou be had for about live bucks.
The outdoor plaza at this
is the optimum place to
enjoy sunny California weather. Come here to
study on off-hours, or at mealtimes to grab and
bite and a beer with friends. f@j

Cafe Borrone
1010 El Camino Real, Merxlo Park
The Lowdown: A favorite area hangout for
over 10 years, Cafe Borrone attracts its loyal
following as much for its happening atmos
phere as for its tasty coffee and food. Finding
a table in the European-style outdoor plaza is
the hard part — enjoying yourself there is a
cinch!
The Scene: Families, professionals and stu
dents frequent Borrone's. Morning and after
noons are fairly slow, but around meal-

times, watch out — it can get
crowded, especially on

nice days.
The Fare:
Cafe Borrone is
hnfh a rnffee

twin a Louee
shop and a
restaurant, and
its order-at-the-

counter setup,
along with tons
of seating, invites
patrons to stay as

long as they like.
Sandwiches, salads

and most food items run
between five and! 0 dollars, though by

ccononii/iug, a. snack and a tasty espresso
dtinkou be had for about live bucks.
The outdoor plaza at this
is the optimum place to
enjoy sunny California weather. Come here to
study on off-hours, or at mealtimes to grab and
bite and a beer with friends. f@j

So you're craving caffeine and a hip
hangout, the CoHo leaves you unful
filled, but you'd like to stay close to home.

Look no further, friend. This
dutiful reviewer has scoured
local coffee joints to find the
best nearby places to get a
good cup of joe, and more. So
grab your books or your
friends, your bike or your car,
and get thee to a coffee house!

Lucu's Tea House

It's located in an alley behind Verde Tea House, 011
Villa Street off Castro. Lucy's wins the Neat Atmos
phere Award. It has mad ambience. Lucy's has a large
stock of board games. I thought it was incredibly fun to
play Go while sipping my tea. The Indian milk tea and
the Thai milk tea were both tasty, 'llie pearls are also a
good size and flavor. Although they do PMT well, their
selection is limited. I'd recommend checking out die
tea floats, which are PMT with a scoop of ice cream in
them. Check this place out, but be warned: the PMT is

a steep $4 unless you
get it to go, then it

drops mysteri
ously to $2.50.
Either you

pay more
or you miss
out on the
coolest part
of Lucy's.

Atmosphere: 5 stars PMT: 4

After a whirlwind
week of PMT compari-

son, I think that Q-Cup is
my favorite. They do everything

right. It is far away, but worth the trip. Lucy's is
the coolest joint to chill at with some friends. Fail
ing that, Black Pearl is still pretty good. I would

say that it
rocks all
right. In
closing, try

some pearl milk
tea but please avoid Tresid
der PMT. It hurts.

S Bakery and Tea House
Cafe
220-B University Ave.
The Lowdown: A recent ad
dition to the local coffeehouse (and
pearl milk tea) scene, S Bakery and
Tea House Cafe deserves to be
come a favorite among Stanford

students. Its friendly decor, perfect people
watching location, good selection of magazines
and appetizing eats invite you to come in and
stay awhile.
The Scene: The Tea House attracts mostly
a youngish crowd: students, young profession
als and their laptops, or pairs of friends.
The Fare: Featured at the Tea House are cakes
and pastries which look as scrumptious as they
taste. Most menu items l(x)ks great fora snack or
a light lunch: soups, salads, sandwiches, as well as
espresso, teas and other dessert drinks, Hie pearl
milk tea is the tastiest I've had in Palo Alto.
The Last word: Great for studying, relaxing
or socializing.

The Prolific Oven
550 Waverly, Palo Alto
The Lowdown: A freshman-year haunt of
mine, this old standard is still a fun, cute place
to get some decent espresso and yummy pas
tries. The cheery oak furniture, including an

old-fashioned glass pastry display
case and charming mismatched ta
bles and chairs, give the impression
that this place has been around
awhile - and it has.

The Scene: No need
to dress up fora visit here.
The Prolific Oven has a fam
ily-owned, casual feel —
even the high school kids be-

hind the counter sport jeans. The place at
tracts families, older folks, younger folks as
well as "non-traditional" customers. (I en
countered a tarot card reading group on my
last visit).

The Fare: The menu is pretty limited,
so head somewhere else if you're not
in the mood lor baked goods. Those

who want to indulge will be at home here,
though. The cakes win awards every year, and
the croissant I had on my recent visit was flaky
and delicious.

The Last Word: Not the greatest place for
studying or staying very long

— the wooden chairs quick
ly start to get uncom-

fortable and noise
reverberates quite a
bit inside, making it
too loud to study at

times. Drop by the Prolific Oven with friends
when yon want to satisfy that sweet tooth —
you won't be sorry.

Happy Donuts
3916 El Camino Real

The Lowdown: An establishment among
Stanford insomniacs, Happy Donuts turns out

over one side of the shop,
while on the other

side a man studied
