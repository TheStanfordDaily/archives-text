# 'Coraline': A story about one evil mother
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Neil Caiman (best-known for his comic series "The Sand
man") begins his new nove "Coraline" with a quote from G.K.
Chesterton: "Fairy tales are more than true: Not because they
tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be
beaten." The deliciously creepy and wonderfully weird story
that follows illustrates Chesterton's point almost perfectly, tak
ing both the protagonist and the reader into spooky, perilous
territory in order to reasstire diem that in die end, diey am
overcome die most overwhelming, terrifying odds,

"Coraline" is a cliildren's novel in the best sense: It treats its
young heroine neither as an idiot nor a miniature adult, but
rather as an inhabitant of a world far stranger and more
frightening than our own, one diat even older readers

shouldn't hesitate to visit.
The book Ls also Caiman's second stab at writing something
like a modern fairy tale, but in many ways it couldn't be more dif
ferent from "Stardust," his first. Where "Stardust" was (for all its
sex and violence) a book reminding adults about the won
ders and joys of all tilings fantastical, "Coraline" takes magic 112
and fantasy for granted, regarding them with more fear J

than wonder. "G>raline's" setting Ls not "Stardust's"
beautiful land of faerie, but an old, otherworldly
house controlled by mysterious, malevo-

lent forces.
Coraline, the young heroine, has just
moved onto the second floor of this house
with her parents. She soon grows bored
and decides to explore a mysterious pas
sage in her flat. On the other side, she dis
covers a room almost identical to the one
she left, where her other mother, who has
big black buttons for eyes, is waiting. The
other house and its inhabitants seem to be
strange, through-the-looking-glass dis
tortions of their real world counterparts.
Coraline resists her other mother's temp-

tations and finds her way home, only to discover diat her parents
are missing. She knows that she must return to the other realm,
armed only with her wits, to defeat the other mother and free her
parents.
In contrast to Caiman's last novel, the sprawling "American
Gods," "Coraline" unfolds in 162 pages, has only two main char
acters (die odiers are little more than entertaining decorations),
and occurs almost entirely within the confines of Coraline's house
and its dark reflection.
Not diat I didn't enjoy "American Gods" (hell, I hiked a cou
ple of miles to the bookstore before school on its first day of re
lease so that I wouldn't have to wait a whole day to start reading),
but there's something beautifully, grippingly simple about
"Coraline."
By paring everything down to its essentials, Caiman is in many
ways playing to his strengths. Way back in the early '90s, when
"Sandman" was once again proving that comic lxx>ks could tell
adult, literate stories about people other than men and women in
tights beating the crap out of each other, Gaiman excelled in
conjuring up complex depths of emotion or vast worlds using
only a few carefully chosen words.

Take, for example, the passage introducing the other
mother. In five short sentences, Gaiman tells us almost
everything we need to know: "She looked a little like

Coraline's mother. Only ... Only her skin was white
as paper. Only she was uiller and thinner. Only her
fingers were too long, and they never stopped
moving, and her dark red fingernails were curved
and sharp."
And while we're on the subject of scaring the

bejeezus out of people, iuiyone who has read some of
Caiman's early "Sandman" work (a serial killer con
vention, anyone?) knows diat he am frighten die hell

out of his readers when he wants to. 'Hie terrors that
Goraline faces in her struggle are often quite chilling and
probably particularly disturbing to die children diat die

novel is aimed at, but diat will only make you turn the
pages more quickly and tally grasp the enormity of
Coraline's achievement — and Caiman's — when
you reach the end.

If Chesterton is right, dien "Coraline" is more
dian true — not because it tells us diat die other
mother is real, but because it tells us that die other
mother can be beaten.
