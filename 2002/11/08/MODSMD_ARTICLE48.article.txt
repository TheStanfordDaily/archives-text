# The 						Strokes too small for arena venue, too big for britches
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
Bands such as Koßn, Stone
Temple Pilots, Led Zeppelin,
Queen and even single acts like
Bowie have the authority to grab
an arena by its balls and mount it
with the vivacity of a bull in heat.
Unfortunately, The Strokes are
not such a band. Although talent
ed, they have not yet earned their
arena privileges.
After waiting in line populated
with a disgraceful amount of con

verse shoes and boys dressed like
Strokes lead singer Julian
Casablancas, I was herded with the
throngs into the Bill Graham Civic
Center on Oct. 31. The slogan of
the night was "rock is back."
Sadly enough, this new rock
movement rests mainly on the per
formers' ability to jerk around on
stage, tlail their hands at their hips
and twirl their microphone in pure
Mick Jagger mimicry. Both open
ing bands (the Realistics and the
Mooney Suzuki) typified this

image, and though they had prac
ticed the Jagger swagger to ulti
mate perfection, they should have
spent more time practicing the ac
tual music.
The Strokes were admittedly a
very endearing band and had the
balance and competence that one
would expect of a near-platinum
act. They played all of their hits:
"Hard To Explain," "Someday,"
"Last Nite," and sent the little girls
next to me into a bouncing/
screaming fit with "Barely Legal"

and "Modern Age." The band
even gave the audience a sample of
some of their new songs for their
upcoming second album.
Between the unnecessary
moshing and crowd surfing, I real
ized that these kids were trying
their best to sanction the gestures
of a typical rock concert, which is
the absolute opposite of what the
cavernous venue embodied. In all
honesty, The Strokes are best and
most rockingly experienced in a
small club with dim lights, cheap

drinks and the hum of city taxis in
the background.
Furthermore, this "resurrec
tion of rock" that so many journal
ists have cited (due to bands such
as The Hives, The White Stripes
and The Strokes) is just a different
prototype of pop, not rock. These
new bands are good acts; they play
good music, but they are not bring
ing anything new or innovative to
be considered great rock and roll.
Imitation may be flattery, but in
the end, it is still imitation.
