# Luxe and Reduxe:
## Pavement classic still slanted, still enchanting 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
As I sauntered into The Daily office
on a Tuesday night, I was greeted by an
epiphany of sorts: Ryan Sands, Inter
mission editor, obviously entranced,
was bobbing his head up and down in a
wall-clamped basketball hoop, and co
editor Alice Kim, waiting for an oppor
tunity to dunk (hard), looked on with an

affected indifference. "Sur
real, dude," I thought. We
exchanged crazed glances,
and soon I was led into the
Intermission "inner cham
ber" to receive Pavement's
"Slanted and Enchanted
Deluxe." As I clasped the

plastic redemption to my bosom, Alice
(sure as an oracle) said, simply, "Be" and
Sands, unimpeded by basketball hoops,
added thoughtfully, "Objective."
Surreal, dude.
But why is objectivity central to any dis
cussion about Pavement? To answer that
question, we must first ask, "Who was
Pavement?" Pavement was quite simply
the most intelligent indie-rock band of
the '90s— it made the most beautiful
post-Velvet Underground noise, spoke
the most esoteric words and made slack
ing off an object of faith. Before breaking
up in 1999, this Galifornian band released
a number of defining records — the first
of which, "Slanted & Enchanted," is rated
by most rock critics as one of the greatest
albums of the '90s.
And that is why we must be objective.

That is why I must separate the music from
the phenomenon and allow the years to
temper my judgment of this 10th anniver
sary reissue which features 48 songs col
lected from the album, several EPs, studio
sessions and live shows of that era.
First up, this album is an obvious must
have for all hardcore Pavement fans. It
comes with a tight booklet which has pic
tures of the band, memorable quotations

and song lyrics in their
original form. I literal
ly get down on my
knees four times a day
and read the thing
over-and-over: It's my
freaking prayer book.
The 14 songs

on the original album itself have been re
mastered, and it's still good shit all around:
"Summer Babe (Winter Version)" is
earthy and tired with lazy singing and
badly tuned guitars — it's also the catchiest
song on the album, with a love-me-or
leave-me mid-tempo swagger.
There's also the cool-rock of "Zurich if
Stained" (for all you Anglophiles) and the
video-gaming verve of "Flame Throwa,"
among others. Still, "Slanted and En
chanted" (the LP) is overrated — you've
gotta be into the whole attitude to see
where these guys are coming from, or else
you'll wonder why they're so forcefully
dissonant. And granted, some of the
songs just plain suck. First time listeners
might have to suffer through at times.
The true gems on this album are the
live songs and the sessions from the "Wa

tery" EP. "Texas Never Whispers" begins
with a crystallized guitar and lyrics like
"She's so lackadaisical / she should have
been a West Coast bride" and "Front
wards" is loveable because of its dragging

mis-tuned guitars.
But the true Pave
ment experience is
still waiting for you in
the deep end of the
album: the live acts
glower and growl
and succumb to a
Lou Reed speak-easy
style. Pavement lead
singer Stephen Malk
mus makes the track
"Summer Babe"
even sexier by
drunkenly enunciat
ing every word, and
the rest of the songs
pound with a similar
manic energy.
Surreal, dude.
Perhaps still, if
you've never heard
them, yon are think
ing, "Why should 1
dig Pavement?"
Here's why: Pave
ment is to Radiohead
what Stanford is to
Harvard. Enough
said. And if you have
heard them before,
you're wondering
whv vou still love

Pavement so much, so illogically, so acute
ly. Here's why: They were too intellectual
to know personally, too ironic to be beau
tiful and too lazy to be famous.
Just like you.
