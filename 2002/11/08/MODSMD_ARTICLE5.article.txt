# Profs criticize U.S. Patriot Act

### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Recent bioterrorism legislation and directives
passed by Congress may have a severe impact on
Stanford in the years to come. Faculty Senate mem
ber Mark Mungal and Ann Arvin, a professor of pe
diatrics and of microbiology and immunology, pre
sented the implications of the legislation to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday afternoon and fielded numer
ous questions from members concerned about its
consequences.
The University will be most affected by the legis
lation in two major areas: medical research and in
ternational students' affairs.
Arvin related the "very important topic" of med
ical research to the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act — also
known as the USA Patriot Act — which restricts the
institution's possession of pathogens and limits the
research activities of international students. The leg
islation prohibits possession of these "select agents"
except under certain circumstances, including

"bona fide research."
"The changes being made are
unclear at this point in time," Arvin
said, adding that the definition of
"bona fide research" is yet to be de
termined. According to Arvin, the
legislation is now vague at best and
needs to be quickly clarified in
order for the University to comply
with its stipulations.
Another troubling ambiguity
concerns what defines a "select
agent" whose research requires
strict government regulation.
Though the list of restricted
agents is slated to be finalized by
the government next month, the
University has a lot of work to do
before it can efficiently comply
with the legislation, including
compiling a comprehensive data
base of each substance under
study, Arvin said.
Some faculty members were
troubled by the legislation's stipu
lation that "restricted persons" are
now unable to handle these sub
stances. More troubling, according
to Mungal, is the legislation's
broad definition of a "restricted
person," which includes students
from specified countries, unlawful
users of controlled substances, and
even those previously admitted to
a mental institution for any reason.

While Arvin warned that "new
research could be impacted," she
assured the senate that the Univer
sity is doing everything it can to en
sure the easiest transition to func
tioning under new restrictions.
She said that the University is
promptly responding to federal
mandates — reporting its use of
selected substances and informing
relevant personnel of all regula
tions— and is currently partici
pating in discussion forums, com
menting on the proposed list of re
stricted substances.
Mungal presented the prob
lems that international students
will face under the new legislation,
including but not limited to delays
in acquiring social security num
bers, increased difficulty obtaining
visas, and restrictions on handling
the aforementioned "select
agents."
In other words, students com
ing to Stanford from selected
countries, particularly those desig
nated as "terrorist supporting,"
may have tremendous difficulty
entering and leaving the country
and becoming part of specific re
search teams. International stu
dents will undergo thorough back
ground checks — including the
student's intended area of study —
before being allowed into the
country. Additionally, the govern
ment will now have easier access to
student records.
"We have relatively little

power over this issue," University
President John Hennessy said.
"[This legislation] could be quite
draconian."
There is little legal room for in
stitutions to tail to comply with the
legislation, he added.
Faculty Senate member Phyllis
Gardner expressed disbelief at the
general lack of reaction to such sig
nificant limitations on civil liberties
and said that she felt the Universi
ty should be more vocal about the
legislation. Her sentiments were
seconded by Faculty Senate mem
ber Andrea Goldsmith, who called
the legislation "something we
should speak up about."
Applied Physics and Biological
Sciences Prof. Steven Block ex
pressed disappointment at the
"general failure of the University
to educate faculty [about the leg
islation]," noting that many of the
members present learned for the
first time at that meeting that
"USA Patriot Act" is an acronym
for Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropri
ate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism. He said
that if the faculty is uneducated
about this critical legislation, the
University will be less prepared to
implement it efficiently and least
intrusively.

Eric Roberts, professor of com

puter science and senior associate
dean of student affairs, and under
graduate student Andrew Simons,
co-chairs of the Judicial Affairs
Board, gave an update on the
Board's progress in honor of its
fifth anniversary.
The Committee of Fifteen
was convened in 1996 to revise
the charter of the existing Judi
cial Affairs Board in an attempt
to affirm the importance of the
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard and to guarantee stu
dents a role in establishing judi
cial policy and adjudicating
cases.
According to Roberts, the revi
sion was a huge success.
"I am proud of the work we
did on [The Committee of Fif
teen]," Roberts said.
According to Roberts, the suc
cess of the new Judicial Affairs
Board is due to the fact that it has
"gotten students involved and
empowered."
Simons described the previous
system of adjudication as "a black
box" dominated by the administra
tion with little student input.
"There was no sense of justice," he
said.
The purpose of the Judicial Af
fairs Board is to adjudicate cases
involving the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard and is, ac
cording to Roberts, "a very impor
tant part of the Stanford academic
system."

power over this issue," University
President John Hennessy said.
"[This legislation] could be quite
draconian."
There is little legal room for in
stitutions to tail to comply with the
legislation, he added.
Faculty Senate member Phyllis
Gardner expressed disbelief at the
general lack of reaction to such sig
nificant limitations on civil liberties
and said that she felt the Universi
ty should be more vocal about the
legislation. Her sentiments were
seconded by Faculty Senate mem
ber Andrea Goldsmith, who called
the legislation "something we
should speak up about."
Applied Physics and Biological
Sciences Prof. Steven Block ex
pressed disappointment at the
"general failure of the University
to educate faculty [about the leg
islation]," noting that many of the
members present learned for the
first time at that meeting that
"USA Patriot Act" is an acronym
for Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropri
ate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism. He said
that if the faculty is uneducated
about this critical legislation, the
University will be less prepared to
implement it efficiently and least
intrusively.

injudicial Affairs Board
Eric Roberts, professor of com

puter science and senior associate
dean of student affairs, and under
graduate student Andrew Simons,
co-chairs of the Judicial Affairs
Board, gave an update on the
Board's progress in honor of its
fifth anniversary.
The Committee of Fifteen
was convened in 1996 to revise
the charter of the existing Judi
cial Affairs Board in an attempt
to affirm the importance of the
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard and to guarantee stu
dents a role in establishing judi
cial policy and adjudicating
cases.
According to Roberts, the revi
sion was a huge success.
"I am proud of the work we
did on [The Committee of Fif
teen]," Roberts said.
According to Roberts, the suc
cess of the new Judicial Affairs
Board is due to the fact that it has
"gotten students involved and
empowered."
Simons described the previous
system of adjudication as "a black
box" dominated by the administra
tion with little student input.
"There was no sense of justice," he
said.
The purpose of the Judicial Af
fairs Board is to adjudicate cases
involving the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard and is, ac
cording to Roberts, "a very impor
tant part of the Stanford academic
system."
Recent bioterrorism legislation and directives
passed by Congress may have a severe impact on
Stanford in the years to come. Faculty Senate mem
ber Mark Mungal and Ann Arvin, a professor of pe
diatrics and of microbiology and immunology, pre
sented the implications of the legislation to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday afternoon and fielded numer
ous questions from members concerned about its
consequences.
The University will be most affected by the legis
lation in two major areas: medical research and in
ternational students' affairs.
Arvin related the "very important topic" of med
ical research to the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act — also
known as the USA Patriot Act — which restricts the
institution's possession of pathogens and limits the
research activities of international students. The leg
islation prohibits possession of these "select agents"
except under certain circumstances, including

"bona fide research."
"The changes being made are
unclear at this point in time," Arvin
said, adding that the definition of
"bona fide research" is yet to be de
termined. According to Arvin, the
legislation is now vague at best and
needs to be quickly clarified in
order for the University to comply
with its stipulations.
Another troubling ambiguity
concerns what defines a "select
agent" whose research requires
strict government regulation.
Though the list of restricted
agents is slated to be finalized by
the government next month, the
University has a lot of work to do
before it can efficiently comply
with the legislation, including
compiling a comprehensive data
base of each substance under
study, Arvin said.
Some faculty members were
troubled by the legislation's stipu
lation that "restricted persons" are
now unable to handle these sub
stances. More troubling, according
to Mungal, is the legislation's
broad definition of a "restricted
person," which includes students
from specified countries, unlawful
users of controlled substances, and
even those previously admitted to
a mental institution for any reason.

While Arvin warned that "new
research could be impacted," she
assured the senate that the Univer
sity is doing everything it can to en
sure the easiest transition to func
tioning under new restrictions.
She said that the University is
promptly responding to federal
mandates — reporting its use of
selected substances and informing
relevant personnel of all regula
tions— and is currently partici
pating in discussion forums, com
menting on the proposed list of re
stricted substances.
Mungal presented the prob
lems that international students
will face under the new legislation,
including but not limited to delays
in acquiring social security num
bers, increased difficulty obtaining
visas, and restrictions on handling
the aforementioned "select
agents."
In other words, students com
ing to Stanford from selected
countries, particularly those desig
nated as "terrorist supporting,"
may have tremendous difficulty
entering and leaving the country
and becoming part of specific re
search teams. International stu
dents will undergo thorough back
ground checks — including the
student's intended area of study —
before being allowed into the
country. Additionally, the govern
ment will now have easier access to
student records.

power over this issue," University
President John Hennessy said.
