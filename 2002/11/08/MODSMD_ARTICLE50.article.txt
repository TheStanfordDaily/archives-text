# Shaggy's latest album needs to trim the reggae
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
While preparing to write this review, I decided to get
online and check some message boards to see how the
public was receiving Shaggy's new album "Lncky Day."

Unsurprisingly to me, the reaction was very mixed.
One post comes to mind, where the author posi
tively raved that (and 1 paraphrase) "as a longstand
ing fan who owns every Shaggy album thus far,
'Lucky Day' is fantastic — a return to his reggae
roots. Sorry, 'Hotshot' lovers, less pop and more

reggae here."
But maybe that's just the problem with "Lucky Day." As
another long-standing Shaggy fan, it is my opinion that his
reggae has always been fairly watered down and wishy
washy. It was always in his more pop-oriented fare that he
really shone — I find it no coincidence that most ol his
biggest hits thus far, including "Boombastic, "Luv Me
Luv Me," "Dance and Shout" and the smash "Angel,"
were all based on samples of classic pop /r & b songs. Hie
reason that his last album, the 6-million-selling Hotshot,
was so successful is precisely because it was heavily popu
lated with fun pop songs.
No such luck on Shaggy's latest release "Lucky Day."
Shaggy recently bragged to Billboard that he wanted to
sell 10 million, and had finally written the album to do it. I

would be very surprised if this CD comes even
close to the 10 million sales mark, ITie album
banks largely on a reggae-lite vibe that I just can't
get into, and mainstream audiences probably •
won't either. That said, they'll miss out on one or

Shaggy
i Lucky Day

two jams that do rise |
a cut above the 1
album's mediocrity. *
Hie first single, "Hey
Sexy Lady" (which is A
currently bomb-

ing on the charts despite a video filled
with lots of objectified hot women in
it) is driven by a flamenco under-

current, complete with Spanish
guitar and solo trumpet. And j
"Hookie Jookie" is a sexy /J

cheesy guilty pleasure with an
undeniably tun rhythmic hook. J
'Ihe one song that has real J
potential to explode on radio is J
the highlight of the album, I
"Strength of a Woman." 'Ihe m
song is the closest that "Lucky ■
Day" comes to featuring any- M
thing as enjoyably catchy as I

i earlier hits such as "11 Wasn't Me" and ifShag
| gy knows what's best for him, it will be re-

leased as the next single, The song shows off
Shaeery's bankable sensitive side with words

like "She'll put a smile up on your face/ And
take you to a higher place / So don't you un
derestimate / 'I Tie strength of a woman." Hie

song's chorus is the single most memorable
and interesting moment on the disc.

Iliat song alone can't carry
the record, and overall 1 don't

think "Lucky Day" will be
kever be accessible
i. 11

enough to sell any
where close to the 10
L million of Shaggy's
dreams. That's for
another album. The
Internet fan was
right — there is less
pop and more (lite)
reggae here. But
with less pop comes
less fun, and I find it
i unfortunate.
