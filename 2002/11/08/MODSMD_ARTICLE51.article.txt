# Roxy's guide to scoring off the field

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Dear Roxy,
Help! I am lusting after this totally
hot Stanford athlete. / do not know how
to pursue my endeavors, being the lowly
freshman I am. Are they as stupid here as
they were in high school? Will the same
tactics work? 1 trust you, sex goddess, to
lead me. in the tight direction.
Sincerely,
Atldetic /f.vs Admirer
Dear AAA,
Welcome to the Farm, where
most hormonally charged young
freshmen who look beyond their
books quickly realize the hottest ass
on campus can often be found on
one of the sports teams. You are not
alone in this endeavor to land a tro
phy girlfriend / boyfriend.
First of all, the athletes here are
by no means stupid. This ain't
Kansas anymore, Dorothy. This is
Stanford, where the brains are
often as hot as the bods. As for your
high school tactics, Roxy can only
guess what this means. Sitting on his
car in a whipped cream bikini? Or
telling your friend who knows the
cousin of a friend to find out if she
wants to "go" with you?
The other question Roxy asks is,
"What sort of relationship are you
pursuing?" You also fail to mention
which sport your object of desire
plays. These elements are key, as
each team has a different reputa
tion and style in the pathetically

small dating world here at Stanford.
While Roxy does recognize that
each athlete is an individual (albeit a
pretty fucking HOT individual), we
all know there are certain teams
that get more play than others. Just
get yourself invited to the athlete's
formal and watch what happens.
If all you are after are bragging
privileges, a drunken hookup at a
party will be the quickest road to
success. However, the athletes that
will hop in the sack that quickly
have generally done it before. A lot.
There are willing freshmen every
year, after all.
Because athletes tend to travel
and have demanding schedules, it
may be difficult to pinpoint which
parties they will attend. Your best
bet is to find a friend who knows
when their private team parties are
being held. Ideally the friend is an
other team member, and can bring
you as a guest. If not, just crash it
shamelessly. Chances are, they will
know exactly what you are doing
there. This doesn't mean anyone
will mind (except for your skanky
competition).
Treat the athletes like any other
sexually attractive people you meet
at Stanford, and by all means flirt
your ass off. It's good to be friendly
with the whole team. Be careful to
make it clear which one you are in
terested in though, or you could
end up in a teammate's arms. Many
of them will find it incestuous to
take sloppy seconds, so make sure
you get the one you want. However,

heed Roxy's warning: Just because
they take you up on a one night
hookup does not mean they will be
running into your arms after they
sink the winning basket at the next
game. You and 50 other girls could
be standing there together with that
same expectation.
On the other hand, if you are
looking to have a real relationship,
things are a bit different. You are
going to have to look beyond the
public image and get to know your
athlete as a person. Find a way to
meet your crush in an informal way.
This can be difficult, because they
often travel in packs. As we all know,
that group of team jackets march
ing through the dining hall can
send even the hottest babe into seri
ous insecurity hell.
The major problem with trying
to date an athlete is that they usual
ly do not have to make much effort
when it comes to romance. So sub
tlety is often lost as they are busy
dreaming of their last goal. On the
other hand, appearing desperate is
quite dorky and pointless.
So my friend AAA, what should 1
do, you ask? Roxy's best advice is
this: If you truly like this person,
find a way to ask them out. Yes, on
a date. Go out for dinner, hike the
Dish, etc. The worst they can do is
say no, and even if they do, all your
friends will be in awe at your balls of
steel. Either way, it will be clear if
you have a chance with your crush.
Who knows? You may end up scor
ing a few home runs of your own.

"What sort of relationship are you
pursuing?" You also fail to mention
which sport your object of desire
plays. These elements are key, as
each team has a different reputa
tion and style in the pathetically

small dating world here at Stanford.
While Roxy does recognize that
each athlete is an individual (albeit a
pretty fucking HOT individual), we
all know there are certain teams
that get more play than others. Just
get yourself invited to the athlete's
formal and watch what happens.
If all you are after are bragging
privileges, a drunken hookup at a
party will be the quickest road to
success. However, the athletes that
will hop in the sack that quickly
have generally done it before. A lot.
There are willing freshmen every
year, after all.
Because athletes tend to travel
and have demanding schedules, it
may be difficult to pinpoint which
parties they will attend. Your best
bet is to find a friend who knows
when their private team parties are
being held. Ideally the friend is an
other team member, and can bring
you as a guest. If not, just crash it
shamelessly. Chances are, they will
know exactly what you are doing
there. This doesn't mean anyone
will mind (except for your skanky
competition).
Treat the athletes like any other
sexually attractive people you meet
at Stanford, and by all means flirt
your ass off. It's good to be friendly
with the whole team. Be careful to
make it clear which one you are in
terested in though, or you could
end up in a teammate's arms. Many
of them will find it incestuous to
take sloppy seconds, so make sure
you get the one you want. However,

heed Roxy's warning: Just because
they take you up on a one night
hookup does not mean they will be
running into your arms after they
sink the winning basket at the next
game. You and 50 other girls could
be standing there together with that
same expectation.
On the other hand, if you are
looking to have a real relationship,
things are a bit different. You are
going to have to look beyond the
public image and get to know your
athlete as a person. Find a way to
meet your crush in an informal way.
This can be difficult, because they
often travel in packs. As we all know,
that group of team jackets march
ing through the dining hall can
send even the hottest babe into seri
ous insecurity hell.
The major problem with trying
to date an athlete is that they usual
ly do not have to make much effort
when it comes to romance. So sub
tlety is often lost as they are busy
dreaming of their last goal. On the
other hand, appearing desperate is
quite dorky and pointless.
So my friend AAA, what should 1
do, you ask? Roxy's best advice is
this: If you truly like this person,
find a way to ask them out. Yes, on
a date. Go out for dinner, hike the
Dish, etc. The worst they can do is
say no, and even if they do, all your
friends will be in awe at your balls of
steel. Either way, it will be clear if
you have a chance with your crush.
Who knows? You may end up scor
ing a few home runs of your own.
