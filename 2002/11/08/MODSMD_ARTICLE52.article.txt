ST. LOUIS (AP) — Brian Stew
art's 11 -month-old son was in a
Missouri hospital recovering from
a respiratory ailment when he al
legedly contracted HIV.
Prosecutors said it was Stewart
— a phlebotomist at a local hospi
tal — who injected his own son
with HIV-tainted blood to avoid
paying child support.
A jury found Stewart guilty of
first-degree assault on Dec. 7,
1998. On Jan. 8, 1999, Stewart was
sentenced to life in prision.
Just months after Stewart began
dating "Jennifer," in January
1990, she became pregnant with
his child.
The two never married, and
Stewart continued to deny paterni
ty for years. After the couple split,
he refused to pay child support. A
paternity suit later led to the deter
mination that Stewart was indeed
the baby's father, and he was or
dered to pay support.
The baby was being treated for
respiratory problems at St.
Joseph's Medical Center-West in
Lake St. Louis, where Stewart visit
ed his son on Feb. 6, 1992.
Stewart, who worked as a phle
botomist - one who draws blood for
testing — at another hospital, was
seen carrying a lab coat into the
child's room. The child's mother
left the two alone for about 20 min
utes. When she returned, the door

was closed and the child was
screaming and crying, she said.
It was during the mother's ab
sence that Stewart allegedly inject
ed his son with HIV-tainted blood,
prosecutors contended.
For the next five years, the
child's illnesses puzzled doctors.
But it was not until May 17, 1996,
when he was admitted to Chil
dren's Hospital in St. Louis with an
unknown disease that he was final
ly tested for HIV. On May 25,
1996, he was diagnosed with ad
vanced stages of AIDS.
The child's mother recalled
Stewart telling her not to bother
seeking child support from him
because "the child would not live
for very long anyway." She report
ed seeing Stewart possessing sy
ringes and what appeared to be
blood products in the home.
Stewart was arrested the
evening of Tuesday, April 22,
1998, at St. Louis University Med
ical Center, where he worked as a
lab assistant.
Judge Ellsworth Cundiff, who
sentenced Stewart to life in prison,
told Stewart that when he dies he is
going to "burn in hell from here to
eternity." Stewart appealed his
conviction, but it was denied. His
son, now 11, is still alive and is
doing well with treatments for full
blown AIDS.
