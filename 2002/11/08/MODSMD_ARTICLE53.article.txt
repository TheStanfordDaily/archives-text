# the
						Kinks robbed of legacy by the Beatles, Stones

### JOANNA PETRONE 
Since the '60s, my father has been on a one-man crusade
to elevate the Kinks to their proper place in rock history. For
a long time in our house, Beatles albums could not be played
without extensive prefacing from my dad on how angry he
had been as a youth, about the disproportionate amount of
attention go to the Beatles while the at-least-as-talented, at
least-as-innovative, at-least-as-catchy Kinks were all but un
noticed, at least in the American press. My father would then
play several Kinks albums back-to-back, doing his part to
even out the tallies in God's Big Book Of What Everybody's
Been Listening To.
I spent adolescence, in large part, with my bedroom door
locked, shunning pretty much anything pre-"Nevermind." It is
a testament to the innovation and lasting influence of the Kinks
(as well as my father's sharp taste in music) that I now find my
self forming the same quasi-obsessive fondness for mid-career
Kinks that 1 once saw nearly destroy my own fatfier.
The Kinks are in many ways the prototype for many of
today's groups: intelligent, literate boys standing just out
side of the mainstream, staring in at it through the thick lens
es of their black-rimmed glasses. Ray Davies, the lead singer
/songwriter and the primary creative force behind the
band, with his wit, deadpan humor and laconic postures of
introversion before a personality-hungry press has the same
appeal of, say, Stephen Malkmus — only without all of the
I'm-so-not-cool-that-I'm-the-coolest brand of smarm.
Nowhere does the Kinks' wayward nerdiness and
anachronistic idiosyncrasies come together more gloriously
than in "Arthur, Or The Decline And Fall Of The British
Empire." It is hard to imagine a title more incongruous with

the prevailing
trends in
youth culture
in 1969, the
year of its re
lease. While

the Who were hoping to die before they got old and Rolling
Stone had declared that anyone over 30 was not to be trust
ed, the Kinks were recording a saga about the crumbling
world from the perspective of their parents' generation.
All the songs are about the album's namesake and his
wayward family. "Arthur was born just a plain simple man /
In a plain simple working class position / Though the world
was hard and its ways were set / He was young and he had so
much ambition / All the way he was overtaken / By the peo
ple who make the big decisions," Ray Davies declares in a
voice that moves effortlessly from soft intimations to bacchic
shouts on the album's title song.
While the plot is somewhat unclear and the songs are
connected in a thematic way only, there is a unity of feeling
in the album that demands to be heard out from beginning
to end. Each song is terrific in itself, but, when listened to as
a whole, the album becomes a work of art about the sadness
of growing old in a world, of being betrayed, of trying your
hardest but making misguided decisions.
Erudite as the lyrics are, the songs are never overbear
ingly dry. Critics have written ad nauseum about the diverse
influences on Kinks' sound — spanning everything from
American R&B to good old English music halls in search of
some origins — but the sound of the Kinks is, first and fore
most, the sound of the Kinks: an unlikely, idiosyncratic mix
of imaginative storytelling, impassioned vocals, skillful gui

tar and poor quality recording equipment that, contrary to
all formulas and all expectations, works. Musically, the
Kinks are rock 'n' roll at its best — tuneful, raw, energetic
and highly danceable.
Incidentally, if you are still not convinced that Arthur is at
least worth a listen, the bopping, whimsical and wildly funny
song "She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina," contains what
I venture to say is die most artful kazooing in rock history.
