# University wait lists stir up controversy
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
College admission officers who don't have the
heart to reject qualified applicants are placing
more and more of them on wait listf Nlewsv/eek.
reported recently. As a result, students are given
false hope that they still have a chance of receiv
ing admission to a university, when in actuality
the odds are very slim. But, while the Newsweek
article mentioned Stanford as one of the culprits,
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet maintains that the Universitv reserves its

waiting list for only a small percentage of Regular
Review applicants.
According to an article in Kaplan and
Newsweek's "How to Get Into College" guide,
Columbia placed 1,896 people on its waiting list
and accepted on!)' six in 2000. That same year,
Stanford accepted just 32 students from the 766
people originally put on its waiting list.
According to Mamlet, Stanford's waitlisting
system depends on the number of accepted ap
plicants who decide to attend Stanford.
"A very small percentage of highly qualified
Regular Review applicants are offered a place on

the waiting list," Mamlet said. "Our decision to
admit applicants from the waiting list depends
entirely on the response rate to our initial offers
of admission. In the past five years, die number
of students we have admitted from the waiting list
ranged from none to nearly 60."
If the admissions office finds that the response
rate yields available space for waitlisted students,
then it goes about selecting from the list, Mamlet
said.
"We do not rank candidates on our waiting list;
rather, if we find we can make addi
tional offers of admission, we review
all the applicants on the waiting list
again," she said. "We notify waiting
list candidates of their status by late
May, and a small group may remain
under consideration through the
end of June if they so choose."
Sophomore Max Felsher, who
was placed on Stanford's wait list,
described how he felt before he re
ceived a phone call from the office of
admission in mid-May of his senior
year in high school.
"I understand why colleges use
wait lists, and I definitely prefer hav
ing gotten into Stanford off the wait
ing list to not having gotten in at all,"
Felsher said. "I remember being an
noyed at the time of the waitlisting,
though. I had to wait monthsjust to

hear from Stanford, and then they
tell me that I might get in, but I'll
have to wait another month or two.
"Meanwhile, I had to prepare to
go to another school. I think I
ended up losing the deposit I sent to
my safety school. That's not [the
University's] fault, obviously, and
[Stanford] actually waived the ac
ceptance fee because of it, but it was
annoying at the time."
Mamlet rejected the suggestion
that students are waidisted because
admissions officers don't want to
flat-out reject them or because Stan
ford is trying to improve its spot in
publications' college rankings.
"Stanford uses a waiting list sys
tem to ensure that we do not over
enroll students for each new class,"
Mamlet said. "A successful year for
us is when we get to bring in stu
dents from the wait list, but this com
pletely depends on the yield on our
initial offers of admission in the
spring."

"We do not use our wait list or
Early Decision program to affect
our rankings in national polls and
publications," she added. " Ihe fact
is that Stanford maintains the sec
ond highest 'spring yield' (students

admitted during Regular Review)
among our peer institutions — we
are second only to Harvard — be
cause of the strengths of Stanford as
an institution, not by trying to
'game' our admission process."
