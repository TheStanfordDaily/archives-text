# CDC job fair presents social-change careers
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Social change: to politicians, it is
a catchphrase; but to many seniors
looking for employment after
graduation, it could be their life's
work.
Students who attended the
"Working for Social Change"
panel and fail at the Career Devel
opment Center on Wednesday
night were presented with career
opportunities that may not carry
the prestige or the fat paychecks of
more traditional paths, but offer
the chance to play an active role in
addressing societal injustice and
inequality.
Four companies represented at
the fair — Coro, Justice Matters,
Edvoice and Greenpeace — dis
tributed information, while repre
sentatives from The California
Public Interest Group, The Fund
for Public Interest Research.
Green Corps and Teach for Amer
ica held a panel presentation.
"[The fair] actually started
three years ago," said Sam Ro

driguez, assistant director of coun
seling at the CDC. "Jenna Perry of
Green Corps, a Stanford gradu
ate, suggested the idea and I was
excited to host the event.
"Working fora social change
organization allows one to have di
rect impact on the individuals —
one serves to alleviate social in
equities in our society on both a
local and global level."
Panelists described their cur
rent positions and the overall mis
sions of the organizations for
which they worked. Only one
group, Teach for America, fo
cused on education. The organiza
tion's panelist, Sehba
Zhumkhawala, spoke about her
"often difficult, but always reward
ing" experience as a teacher.
".As a teacher, you affect people
every single day on so many differ
ent levels," she said. "You affect
kids, families and communities —
it's the greatest thing."
The three other groups on the
panel — Green Corps, The Fund
for Public Interest Research and
The California Public Interest
Group — are mainly involved
with grassroots advocacy and
fundraising for environmental
and social justice issues and work
with organizations like the I luman
Rights Group and The Sierra
Club.
Green Corps trains recent col
lege graduates to be "the next gen
eration of environmental and so
cial change leaders," said Parker
Blackmail '90, who went through
the two-year training program
and is now vice president of Fen
ton Communications, which
works with nonprofit businesses.
"At Stanford, I was a history
and French major, and I often re
member hearing from my mother:
'What are you going to do after
graduation?' " Blackmail said.
"After working in real estate devel
opment, which turned out to be a
big mistake, I took a leap of faith
and I found Green Corps... I
thought then, 'It sounds a hell of
lot better than what 1 was doing be
fore!' "
The panelists also offered ad
vice to seniors and students who
are still unsure of what they want
to do after graduation.
"Go on informational inter
views," Zhumkhawala said. "Real
ly figure out what you're going to
be an advocate for. It will open up
the whole world and you'll find out
what is out there. Whatever you
do, make sure you're passionate
about it."
Seth Newton '01, past president
of the ASSU, was present as a rep
resentative of the Hotel Employ
ees and Restaurant Employees
Union. While at Stanford, he was
involved in several social change

movements on campus, including
the Farm Workers Union Straw
berry Campaign, which fought for
rights for California agricultural
workers.
As president of the ASSU, he
also worked for increasing stu
dents' power on campus and
fought for the establishment of
Student Initiated Courses. New
ton said that after graduation, he
knew he wanted a job that was
going to give meaning to his life.
He said that working for the union
was a natural next step.
"My work at Stanford gave me
the tools 1 needed to learn," he
said. "1 want to be an organizer all
of my life and being active on cam
pus was very critical to my goals
now and in the future."
The room at the ClX' where
the panel was held was almost full
by the end of the night. Rodriguez,
who also works in public service ca
reer counseling, said he believes it
was no fluke. He said he noticed
students are becoming more inter
ested in considering careers in the
nonprofit sector or working with
the government.
"The interest in social change
careers has definitely increased,"
he said. "I've had alumni come
back who were involved in failed
start-ups who started thinking
about these career possibilities —
they are looking for something
more meaningful."
Senior Jessica Jenkins, who is
considering working on develop
ment issues and human rights ad
vocacy in Latin America, said she
believes that the opportunities she
has been granted throughout her
life have helped her decide her ca
reer choice.
Jenkins said, "I feel that the
privilege of attending an elite,
powerful institution like Stanford
demands that 1 try to use my edu
cation to help enact positive social
change."

Zhumkhawala, spoke about her
"often difficult, but always reward
ing" experience as a teacher.
".As a teacher, you affect people
every single day on so many differ
ent levels," she said. "You affect
kids, families and communities —
it's the greatest thing."
The three other groups on the
panel — Green Corps, The Fund
for Public Interest Research and
The California Public Interest
Group — are mainly involved
with grassroots advocacy and
fundraising for environmental
and social justice issues and work
with organizations like the I luman
Rights Group and The Sierra
Club.
Green Corps trains recent col
lege graduates to be "the next gen
eration of environmental and so
cial change leaders," said Parker
Blackmail '90, who went through
the two-year training program
and is now vice president of Fen
ton Communications, which
works with nonprofit businesses.
"At Stanford, I was a history
and French major, and I often re
member hearing from my mother:
'What are you going to do after
graduation?' " Blackmail said.
"After working in real estate devel
opment, which turned out to be a
big mistake, I took a leap of faith
and I found Green Corps... I
thought then, 'It sounds a hell of
lot better than what 1 was doing be
fore!' "
The panelists also offered ad
vice to seniors and students who
are still unsure of what they want
to do after graduation.
"Go on informational inter
views," Zhumkhawala said. "Real
ly figure out what you're going to
be an advocate for. It will open up
the whole world and you'll find out
what is out there. Whatever you
do, make sure you're passionate
about it."
Seth Newton '01, past president
of the ASSU, was present as a rep
resentative of the Hotel Employ
ees and Restaurant Employees
Union. While at Stanford, he was
involved in several social change

movements on campus, including
the Farm Workers Union Straw
berry Campaign, which fought for
rights for California agricultural
workers.
As president of the ASSU, he
also worked for increasing stu
dents' power on campus and
fought for the establishment of
Student Initiated Courses. New
ton said that after graduation, he
knew he wanted a job that was
going to give meaning to his life.
He said that working for the union
was a natural next step.
"My work at Stanford gave me
the tools 1 needed to learn," he
said. "1 want to be an organizer all
of my life and being active on cam
pus was very critical to my goals
now and in the future."
The room at the ClX' where
the panel was held was almost full
by the end of the night. Rodriguez,
who also works in public service ca
reer counseling, said he believes it
was no fluke. He said he noticed
students are becoming more inter
ested in considering careers in the
nonprofit sector or working with
the government.
"The interest in social change
careers has definitely increased,"
he said. "I've had alumni come
back who were involved in failed
start-ups who started thinking
about these career possibilities —
they are looking for something
more meaningful."
Senior Jessica Jenkins, who is
considering working on develop
ment issues and human rights ad
vocacy in Latin America, said she
believes that the opportunities she
has been granted throughout her
life have helped her decide her ca
reer choice.
Jenkins said, "I feel that the
privilege of attending an elite,
powerful institution like Stanford
demands that 1 try to use my edu
cation to help enact positive social
change."
Social change: to politicians, it is
a catchphrase; but to many seniors
looking for employment after
graduation, it could be their life's
work.
Students who attended the
"Working for Social Change"
panel and fail at the Career Devel
opment Center on Wednesday
night were presented with career
opportunities that may not carry
the prestige or the fat paychecks of
more traditional paths, but offer
the chance to play an active role in
addressing societal injustice and
inequality.
Four companies represented at
the fair — Coro, Justice Matters,
Edvoice and Greenpeace — dis
tributed information, while repre
sentatives from The California
Public Interest Group, The Fund
for Public Interest Research.
Green Corps and Teach for Amer
ica held a panel presentation.
"[The fair] actually started
three years ago," said Sam Ro

driguez, assistant director of coun
seling at the CDC. "Jenna Perry of
Green Corps, a Stanford gradu
ate, suggested the idea and I was
excited to host the event.
"Working fora social change
organization allows one to have di
rect impact on the individuals —
one serves to alleviate social in
equities in our society on both a
local and global level."
Panelists described their cur
rent positions and the overall mis
sions of the organizations for
which they worked. Only one
group, Teach for America, fo
cused on education. The organiza
tion's panelist, Sehba
Zhumkhawala, spoke about her
