Smart Mobs:
The Next Social Revolution
by author Howard Rheingold
HOBS
COLO
MO
How the convergence of mobile
communications and computing is
driving the next social
revolution-transforming the ways
in which people meet, mate, work,
buy, sell, govern, and create.
Applying insights from sociology,
artificial
intelligence, engineering, and
anthropology, Rheingold offers
a penetrating perspective on
the brave new convergence
of pop culture, cutting-edge
technology, and social activism. At
the same time, he reminds us that,
as with other technological revolu
tions, the real impact of mobile
communications will come not
from the technology itself but from
how people use it, resist it, adapt
to it, and
ultimately use it to transform the
mselves, their communities, and
their institutions. Howard
Rheingold is also the author
of The Virtual Community:
Homesteading on the Electronic
Frontier, They Have a Word for It: A
Lighthearted Lexicon of
Untranslatable Words & Phrases,
Tools for Thought: The History and
Future of Mind-Expanding
Technology, and many more titles
