# Heavenly chimes peal on campus
## Music professor has a unique hobby that adds beauty to campus: bell ringing 
### PRITI SANGHANI 
Timothy Zerlang, a music professor at Stanford,
has one of the more unique hobbies on campus: He
is the "bell ringer" of Hoover Tower, affectionately
known as "Hoo Tow."
A native of Central California, Zerlang came to
the Music Department at Stanford in 1983 as a
graduate student. He thought he had received bad
luck in the draw, because he was placed into
Crothers Hall. But surprisingly, his residence led to
his interest in ringing the bells.
"The best thing about being in Crothers was its
proximity to Hoo Tow. In fact, my window looked
out on the tower," Zerlang recalled.
During that time, the bells were automatically
played twice a day. Zerlang noticed that some
times the bells were played a lot longer than oth
ers, usually when someone was physically playing
them. Zerlang's interest in the bells led him to
Prof. James B. Angell of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, who was the one playing the
bells at that time. Angell began teaching Zerlang.
"We went up to the tower, he let me play, and
that was my first lesson," Zerlang said.
Zerlang continued to learn on the job, practicing
three days a week and receiving comments from
Angell once a week. In 1988, Zerlang became certi
fied as a carillonneur by the Guild of Carillon neurs
in North America. When Angell retired in 1990,
Zerlang took over his Carillionneur duties.
The 1989 earthquake, which destroyed the
unique automatic play mechanism, convinced the
University that the bells had to be restored. In Feb
ruary 2002, after more than two years of no bells,
Stanford received 48 in-tune bells, a glass cabin to

house the new keyboard, and a steel framework to
mount the bells on.
The restored carillon was a "huge improve
ment," according to Zerlang.
Due to the fact that there is no schedule for the
bells in Hoover Tower, except for the times that
they must be played for the Hoover Institution or
University events, Zerlang has relative freedom in
the days and times he plays them.
"I play when I get the urge," Zerlang said. "On
Halloween, I tried some spooky, weird stuff.
Spooky to me at least."
Although many students are only passingly
aware of the music of the bells as they rush to class,
others make time for them in their busy schedules.
"I make it a point to leave my windows open so I
can get a chance to listen to the bells during the
day," freshman Liz Vrolyk said.
The bells are located on the 14th floor of Hoover
Tower, directly above the observation deck that is
open to tourists. Although Zerlang is happy to take
people up with him to hear him perform, the tower
is not open to the public during his performances.
"[The bells] are too loud, and if someone is both
ered by them, there is really no way for them to get
away from them if they need to," Zerlang ex
plained.
For those interested in ringing the bells, a caril
lon practice keyboard is available in Zerlang's office
in Braun Music Center. The keyboard looks like a
piano except that the keys look like "batons" that
thecarillonneurs hit with their fists. The larger bells
are rung by a separate keyboard for the feel.
The practice keyboard, donated by alum and
fellow carillonneur Margot Halsted, provides a
much less public practicing area.
"Now, a student would not have to be heard in
front of the entire University like 1 did [when I
practiced]," Zerlang said.
Since teaching carillon is not part of his teach-
ing appointment, Zerlang teach
es no Stanford student to play
the bells, although he is current
ly working with two bell ringers
in the area.
At Stanford, Zerlang currently
teaches Music 12, the Music De
partment's "Introduction to
Piano" sequence, and also teach
es Music 72, a class with group
sessions for intermediate and ad
vanced pianists.
Playing the bells holds a spe
cial place in his heart.
"I am a musician," he said. "I
express myself best through
sound. To have the opportunity to
manipulate so much sound â€”
well what musician could resist?"
