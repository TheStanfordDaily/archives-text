## Sources: Malvo admits to shootings 
### 
McLEAN, Va. (AP) — Defense attor
neys said yesterday they will seek to sup
press a police interrogation of 17-year
old sniper suspect John Lee Malvo in
which he reportedly confessed to some
of the shootings.
I lie Washington Post, citing anony
mous sources, reported yesterday that
Malvo admitted pulling the trigger on
several of the shootings that left 10
people dead and three others seriously
wounded during a three-week spree
through metropolitan Washington
and Virginia.
Malvo's defense lawyer, Michael Arif,
criticized police yesterday for leaking
the story and questioned the accuracy of
what those sources told the Post.

"The police are flooding the media
and poisoning the jury pool with their
own paraphrasing and subjective in
terpretations ol statements made dur
ing an unconstitutional interrogation,"
Arif said.
I le said the leak "suggests an insecuri
ty on the part of the commonwealth with
the admissibility of these statements."
A Fairfax County police spokesman
declined to comment on the interroga
tion, and Fairfax County Common
wealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr.
did not return calls yesterday.
One of the shootings for which
Malvo took responsibility is the Oct.
14 death of FBI analyst Linda
Franklin. Malvo is charged with capi

tal murder in that crime by Fairfax
County prosecutors.
Malvo and John Allen Muhammad,
41, were handed over to Virginia au
thorities 1 hursday after the federal gov
ernment dropped charges so the state
could prosecute them on death-penalty
murder charges.
Malvo was taken Thursday to Fair
fax County, where he talked to investi
gators for seven hours before being
booked at the county jail early Friday
morning.
While he was being interrogated,
Malvo's court-appointed guardian,
Todd Petit, said he told investigators
to end the questioning but was
brushed aside.
