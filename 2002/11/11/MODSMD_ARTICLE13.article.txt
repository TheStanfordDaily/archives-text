CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Severe
storms brought destructive tornadoes to
two states yesterday — first to Tennessee,
where three people were killed and 13 hurt,
and later Ohio, where authorities knew of at
least one death.
The National Weather Service con
firmed at least live tornadoes across middle
and western Tennessee — with wind speeds
of up to 140 mph — and said a weather
spotter saw four others in Van Wert Coun
ty in northwest Ohio.
At least one person was confirmed dead in
the state, said dispatcher Trena Bart/, of the
Van Wert post of the Ohio Highway Patrol.
The county sheriff's department report
ed some homes were destroyed, an undeter
mined number of people were trapped in
their basements and a county hospital work
er said several people were being treated.
"We've got a mess," Bartz said.

Emergency officials in many northern
Ohio counties reported widespread dam
age to barns, homes and businesses.
In middle Tennessee, Steven Graves and
his wife survived after wind rolled their
Sumner County mobile home 50 feet.
"The trailer bounced over and I told my
wife we ought to get in the closet, and before
we could get out ofbed it started rolling. I just
can remember it rolling for what seemed like
forever," he told WSMV-TV of Nashville.
"I could feel the trailer crumbling apart
and 1 remember thinking I was going to die,"
said Graves, who suffered minor in juries. His
wife was treated and released from a hospital.
In Montgomery County, about 40 miles
northwest of Nashville, Dennis and Karen
Louise Tooby were killed when a tornado
blew their mobile home off its foundation
and hurled it into an open field across the
road, officials said.
