### 
KIBBUTZ METZER, Israel (AP) —A
Palestinian man broke into an Israeli
farming community late yesterday and
went 011 a shooting rampage, killing five
people, including two children, Israeli of
ficials said.
Two hours later, Israeli helicopters
fired rockets into a large auto body shop
in downtown Gaza City, touching off a
huge fire, witnesses said. The workshop
was believed to be empty at the time of
the attack, shortly before 2 a.m.
The Israeli military declined immedi
ate comment, though it has frequently
targeted metal workshops in the* past,
saying Palestinian militants use them to
manufacture weapons.
In the shooting attack, the gunman
entered Kibbutz Metzer, a collective
farming community in northern Israel,
just across the border from the West

Bank shortly before midnight yesterday.
"There was shooting for close to 10
minutes then the security forces arrived
and we're shut inside the houses," a
member of the farm, identified only as
I l it, told Israel radio.
The Israeli security forces could not
immediately locate the gunman, and it
appeared he may have escaped from
the farm, about 30 miles northeast of
Tel Aviv.
The Israeli rescue service, Magen
David Adom, said at least five people
were killed, including two children.
"Israelis in their own homes were bru
tally targeted by Palestinian terrorists,"
said David Baker, an official in Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's office.
Earlier yesterday, a car exploded out
side the kibbutz after Israeli police or
dered the driver to stop. The two occu

pants were killed.
It was one of three instances yesterday
in which Israeli authorities said they
managed to avert a suicide attack.
In another case, the army said it ar
rested a 15-year-old youth from the West
Bank city of Nablus who was on his way
to carry out a suicide bombing when he
was caught.
Also, the army arrested a man it de
scribed as a senior Hamas member who
was planning an attack from the West
Bank town of Hebron.
Before the violence erupted yester
day, the Israeli army withdrew its tanks
and troops to the outskirts of the West
bank town ofjenin. The move came after
a two-week manhunt that concluded
with the killing Saturday of an Islamic
Jihad militant accused of orchestrating
attacks that killed more than 30 people.
