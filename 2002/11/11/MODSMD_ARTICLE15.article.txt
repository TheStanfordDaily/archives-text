## The
						Stanford Daily Diversity goes beyond high black student yield 
### 
Published Since 1891

This year, Stanford University
must be congratulated for
achieving the highest black
student yield rate of any uni
versity in the country. More than 64 per
cent of the black students admitted into
this year's freshman class decided to en
roll at Stanford.
While The Journal of Blacks in Higher
Education deems the yield rate the stan
dard measure of an institution's strength
because it illustrates how attractive a col
lege is to a community, Stanford should
take a number of steps to make the cam
pus more attractive to minorities and in
crease campus diversity.

In September, 190 new black students
arrived on campus, but the current space
and location of the Black Community Ser
vices Center no longer suffices as a home
to the black community
Currently, if any more than 11 per
cent of the black freshman class is going
to attend an event, it has to be held at
another site, because the capacity limit
for any event at the current BCSC site is
only 20.
If Stanford truly wants to welcome mi
nority communities onto campus, it
needs provide community centers with
adequate resources.
The ethnic community centers not

only provide space and support for eth
nic communities, but, through their var
ious events, they also allow students to
learn from and increase their under
standing of the diverse cultural back
grounds on campus.
Furthermore, diversity within the fac
ulty body has a long way to catch up with
the diversity of students. While the ratio
of white faculty to white students is
2.3:1, the ratio of Chicano faculty to Chi
cano students is 14.9:1.
As of 2001, only 21.5 percent of facul
ty were women, while women make up
about half of the student body.
As Stanford becomes more and more

diverse, the University administration
can no longer afford to maintain the sta
tus quo with regards to the makeup oi
the faculty.
Also, the Stanford community should
recognize that race is by no means the
only hierarchy that exists in this coun
try; the University should also track
statistics regarding other issues such as
the socioeconomic background of its stu
dents.
The diversity of the student body
along these lines would also contribute
to the range of perspectives that makes a
University a helpful learning environ
ment.
