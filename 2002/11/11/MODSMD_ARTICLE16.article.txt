# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Stanford's lemonade stand 
### 
Two years ago, I served time as
the display coordinator for the
Stanford Store. Ah, the joys of
retail! My best slogan ran dur
ing Parent's Weekend: "Remember when
we ran our own lemonade stands? Re
member when we sold the most magazine
subscriptions for our school fundraisers?
Remember when we got our first jobs?"
Then in 70-point, red font: "We grew up."
Logo: The Stanford Store.
I took a certain pride in my work with
the store. I wasn't the one who came up
with "Kiss My Axe," but I was glad to be
part of the campaign. At $7 an hour, you
sure ain't working there for the money.
It's a labor of love.
For those of you just tuning in, certain

someones want financial
disclosure from Stanford
Student Enterprises.
When I first read Henry
Towsner's letters to the
editor (Oct. 21, Oct. 28), I
was like, give me a break!
Nobody cares! At the
store, we worked our
butts off to put out a good

product, whether we made money or not.
But then that ugly word "accountability"
made me think twice. SSE is a business, but
it's also a student group. Seems fair that stu
dents should know what's going on with a
system that bears our name. Out of curiosi
ty, I put on my press hat and started asking
some questions.
Here are the fruits of my crack report
ing skills (actually, just random facts
gleaned from SSE's Web site). The ASSU
has not received University funding since
1995. SSE, founded in 1996, funds the
ASSU through its various activities. None
of the money lost or gained by SSE comes
from our tuition.
SSE has three major components: busi
nesses, financial management and develop
ment. Hie businesses are student-run enter
prises like FLiCKS, the Stanford Directory
and the Stanford Store. Financial manage
ment consists of ASSU Banking (handling
student-group accounts) and the Invest
ments Division, or iTeam (turning our $4
million ASSU endowment into yet more en
dowment). Ilie development branch holds
workshops and internships for future Busi
ness-School students. (God have mercy on
their souls.)
The contentious issue is whether or not
the businesses are making money. SSE ar
gues that this information is proprietary,
because competitors could use it to their
advantage. For example, the store com
petes with the Stanford Bookstore, and
the Directory competes with The Daily for
advertising dollars.
"We're not any more secretive than any
other public corporation," says CEO
David Endelman '02. SSE's job is to pro
tect the ASSU's endowment and the Op
erating Fund, money that indirectly be
longs to students. As Endelman has said,

keeping proprietary information from
competitors is "in the best interest of the
student."
Hmm. The way I see it, if SSE funds the
ASSU, and the ASSU funds the students,
then we're all basically shareholders in
SSE. In the real business world, don't
shareholders get access to accounting
records and financial statements? Don't
we, as the students that SSE purports to
represent through its management of our
finances, have a right to know how they're
throwing our money around?
How do we know that the money going
into the so-called "business development
programming" isn't really just going to
catered lunches for pampered econ ma
jors? How do we know that managers
aren't paying themselves bonuses while
their unit operates at a loss?
I'm not implying that there's some
huge, Enron-esque scandal brewing here,
but if SSE wants to put out an image of
competency and professionalism, they
should adhere to the standards of honesty
and transparency that real professionals
follow.
I don't know that much about business.
After all, I'm currently flunking out of
Econ 1. But I have to ask: What exactly
does SSE bring to the table? The ASSU
was making and spending money long
before the creation of SSE. True, SSE
gives us value added in the ASSU's finan
cial independence from the University.
But does that alone legitimize their exis
tence, much less their corporate secrecy?
What do they do for the student that jus
tifies withholding information from the
student?
Unless SSE makes more money than
the ASSU did before 1996 (which, of
course, there's no way to know unless
they disclose their income), the best I
can figure is that SSE gives Stanford stu
dents a chance to get real business expe
rience. That's not anything as lofty as
"promoting financial responsibility" or
"ensuring the long-term financial viabil
ity of the ASSU," but it's not really such
a bad deal, either.
I don't particularly care if SSE loses a
few thousand dollars in a bad year. It hap
pens. It's a learning experience. SSE is
like Stanford's lemonade stand. A really
huge, really professional lemonade stand
staffed by competent, passionate employ
ees (with their own little business cards
and everything). SSE gives the future en
trepreneurs of America a chance to screw
up now, as opposed to later when they're
the CEOs of major corporations.
But don't feed me a line about how it's
"in my best interest" not to know what's
going on in your accounting books or your
corporate boardrooms. If you're going to
go around saying that you operate in the
best interest of the students, then you
need to be accountable to the students.

into the so-called "business development
programming" isn't really just going to
catered lunches for pampered econ ma
jors? How do we know that managers
aren't paying themselves bonuses while
their unit operates at a loss?
I'm not implying that there's some
huge, Enron-esque scandal brewing here,
but if SSE wants to put out an image of
competency and professionalism, they
should adhere to the standards of honesty
and transparency that real professionals
follow.
I don't know that much about business.
After all, I'm currently flunking out of
Econ 1. But I have to ask: What exactly
does SSE bring to the table? The ASSU
was making and spending money long
before the creation of SSE. True, SSE
gives us value added in the ASSU's finan
cial independence from the University.
But does that alone legitimize their exis
tence, much less their corporate secrecy?
What do they do for the student that jus
tifies withholding information from the
student?
Unless SSE makes more money than
the ASSU did before 1996 (which, of
course, there's no way to know unless
they disclose their income), the best I
can figure is that SSE gives Stanford stu
dents a chance to get real business expe
rience. That's not anything as lofty as
"promoting financial responsibility" or
"ensuring the long-term financial viabil
ity of the ASSU," but it's not really such
a bad deal, either.
I don't particularly care if SSE loses a
few thousand dollars in a bad year. It hap
pens. It's a learning experience. SSE is
like Stanford's lemonade stand. A really
huge, really professional lemonade stand
staffed by competent, passionate employ
ees (with their own little business cards
and everything). SSE gives the future en
trepreneurs of America a chance to screw
up now, as opposed to later when they're
the CEOs of major corporations.
But don't feed me a line about how it's
"in my best interest" not to know what's
going on in your accounting books or your
corporate boardrooms. If you're going to
go around saying that you operate in the
best interest of the students, then you
need to be accountable to the students.

Two years ago, I served time as
the display coordinator for the
Stanford Store. Ah, the joys of
retail! My best slogan ran dur
ing Parent's Weekend: "Remember when
we ran our own lemonade stands? Re
member when we sold the most magazine
subscriptions for our school fundraisers?
Remember when we got our first jobs?"
Then in 70-point, red font: "We grew up."
Logo: The Stanford Store.
I took a certain pride in my work with
the store. I wasn't the one who came up
with "Kiss My Axe," but I was glad to be
part of the campaign. At $7 an hour, you
sure ain't working there for the money.
It's a labor of love.
For those of you just tuning in, certain

someones want financial
disclosure from Stanford
Student Enterprises.
When I first read Henry
Towsner's letters to the
editor (Oct. 21, Oct. 28), I
was like, give me a break!
Nobody cares! At the
store, we worked our
butts off to put out a good

product, whether we made money or not.
But then that ugly word "accountability"
made me think twice. SSE is a business, but
it's also a student group. Seems fair that stu
dents should know what's going on with a
system that bears our name. Out of curiosi
ty, I put on my press hat and started asking
some questions.
Here are the fruits of my crack report
ing skills (actually, just random facts
gleaned from SSE's Web site). The ASSU
has not received University funding since
1995. SSE, founded in 1996, funds the
ASSU through its various activities. None
of the money lost or gained by SSE comes
from our tuition.
SSE has three major components: busi
nesses, financial management and develop
ment. Hie businesses are student-run enter
prises like FLiCKS, the Stanford Directory
and the Stanford Store. Financial manage
ment consists of ASSU Banking (handling
student-group accounts) and the Invest
ments Division, or iTeam (turning our $4
million ASSU endowment into yet more en
dowment). Ilie development branch holds
workshops and internships for future Busi
ness-School students. (God have mercy on
their souls.)
The contentious issue is whether or not
the businesses are making money. SSE ar
gues that this information is proprietary,
because competitors could use it to their
advantage. For example, the store com
petes with the Stanford Bookstore, and
the Directory competes with The Daily for
advertising dollars.
"We're not any more secretive than any
other public corporation," says CEO
David Endelman '02. SSE's job is to pro
tect the ASSU's endowment and the Op
erating Fund, money that indirectly be
longs to students. As Endelman has said,

keeping proprietary information from
competitors is "in the best interest of the
student."
Hmm. The way I see it, if SSE funds the
ASSU, and the ASSU funds the students,
then we're all basically shareholders in
SSE. In the real business world, don't
shareholders get access to accounting
records and financial statements? Don't
we, as the students that SSE purports to
represent through its management of our
finances, have a right to know how they're
throwing our money around?
How do we know that the money going
into the so-called "business development
programming" isn't really just going to
catered lunches for pampered econ ma
jors? How do we know that managers
aren't paying themselves bonuses while
their unit operates at a loss?
