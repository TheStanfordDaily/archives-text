'Thank you, Stanford Daily'
Thank you, Stanford Daily, [for run
ning] a story about my case ("In need of
aid, int'l student stays home," Oct. 27).
For your information, I have applied to
find scholarship support for raising my
funding, and right now 1 am waiting for
the final decision from the Institute of In
ternational Education on the Fulbright
scholarship. I was selected as one of five to
six candidates at the first two steps of the
application process, but it is not the final
[stage] yet. Please accept my warm greet
ing to you and your colleagues sent this
cold Mongolian winter evening.

Boston University student
'presents logical fallacy'
In his letter, Matthew Tabor of Boston
University presents a curious logical falla
cy ("Think before submitting 'illogical
tripe' to The Daily," Nov. 7). While he cor
rectly maintains that one does not neces
sarily need to be a member of a particular
population to experience empathy or
study that community's history, he bases
his claim on the premise that it is not ac
ceptable to make claims about history
based on one's personal experience.
Tabor does so by suggesting that [let
ter-writer] Adam Edwards has no right to
express his views on the Civil War as an
African-American, a particularly odd
claim when one notes that nowhere in his
letter ("Race has 'nothing to do with' deci
sions concerning the possible war," Nov.
5) does Edwards argue that only African-
Americans could share his interpretation
of Civil War history. Rather, Edwards
makes clear his own position in relation to
the topic before presenting his argument.
(Tabor does the same by indicating that he
is not African-American.)
Perhaps the real logic underlying
Tabor's letter is hidden in the surprising
analogy he draws when he writes: "Must
we experience a direct tie to an event to
properly evaluate it? I need not smoke
crack cocaine to know that it's bad for me."
I'd be veiy curious to know how a refer
ence to crack cocaine made its way into a let
ter challenging an African-American's right
to take a stand on a historical question.

Students should work to
improve environment
After the election on Nov. 5, CNN re
leased a poll asking voters what the most
important issues in the election were. In
order of importance, they ranked: the
economy, Iraq, Social Security, health
care and education. One issue that did not
appear on this list, climate change, is ar
guably the biggest potential catastrophe to

face mankind. Climate change is not sim
ply a matter of the environment: It en
compasses all the issues cited in the CNN
poll, plus the much-talked-about issues of
national security, terrorism and totalitari
anism. The threat of climate change is un
like any other issue Americans have had to
vote for in a domestic election: It is global
in scale and consequence.
Climate change threatens to destabilize
global economic, biological and political
systems by exposing the planet to unprece
dented weather extremes, food shortages
and the spread of disease-carrying insects.
Due to its devastating impacts on human
health and quality of life, climate change is
a matter of human rights. The world's
poorest and most disenfranchised people
will be hit the hardest by more frequent
and longer-lasting droughts and storms. It
is no coincidence that the island nation of
Tuvalu is planning to sue the United States
for creating the carbon burden that will
sink its shores in the near future. Where
has the leadership been on the issue of cli
mate change? Where has the leadership
been on any of the global issues that threat
en our long-term political stability?
Those of us in our early 20s have a criti
cal responsibility. Climate change has been
called a threat on the order of nuclear holo
caust, yet Americans are complacent. We
should act now, with the kind of urgency felt
by our parents during the Cuban Missile
Crisis, to abate emissions so that we can
avoid some of the impacts of climatic
change. Peaceful, mutual solutions are pos
sible, and, as long as leadership in Washing
ton is lacking, we must lead the nation on
this issue. At Oberlin College, the student
group Climate Justice is targeting the col
lege administration to adopt policies that
will make significant campus-wide reduc
tions in greenhouse gas emissions. We are
holding ourselves responsible and acting re
sponsibly as a result. Other schools such as
Cornell, Tufts and Lewis 8c Clark have al
ready set the precedent by making serious
commitments to ameliorate climate change.
College and university campuses need
to be functioning examples of what the fu
ture can be. Our schools exist to train us
for the future. But if they do not acknowl
edge and address issues like climate
change, what hope is there fora livable fu
ture? We are members of the generation
that will oversee either the undoing of the
planet or its rebirth. If it is to be the latter,
we need to regroup, realize there is hope
for the future and exert our own political
powers on every level of governance —
starting with our schools. It's our future,
so let's make sure it meets our standards
for livability and peace.

The Band's music is 'grating'
I am visiting Stanford this week, and I
went to the women's volleyball match on
Friday night. While 1 enjoyed the superb

level of sporting competition, the quality of
the band was mediocre. Their rendition of
the national anthem was particularly grat
ing, and they appeared to be more interest
ed in who could wear the silliest outfit than
who could hit the right notes. Other U.S.
schools I have visited take their music seri
ously, and it adds gready to the event.

Open letter to President Hennessy
This fall we are facing yet another labor
dispute at the Stanford. Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
workers are fighting for job security, bet
ter staffing standards and wages and ben
efits comparable to those of other Bay
Area hospitals. This Wednesday, workers
will hold a one-day strike to protest man
agement's refusal to meet their basic de
mands. Workers and students are again
organizing in support of better labor con
ditions at Stanford.
Meanwhile, it has been more than a
month since the Coalition for Labor Jus
tice repeated its request for your response
to our proposed Code of Conduct, which
would address many of the same issues of
job security and better wages and benefits
that are affecting hospital workers. We still
have not heard from you.
The University has argued in this cur
rent labor dispute that the Stanford Med
ical Center and Stanford University are
two separate entities. This is true — they
are two distinct non-profit organizations
that serve different purposes.
However, the two are connected by their
shared space, governing bodies, certain
funding and the use of the Stanford name.
Stanford Medical Center is a teaching hos
pital utilized by the Stanford School of
Medicine, a department of Stanford Uni
versity. Stanford medical students and
School of Medicine professors use the Med
ical Center's facilities and resources for re
search and instruction. In addition, rev
enues earned through work completed in
the Stanford Medical Center helps fund the
Sclmk)l of Medicine. Moreover, the govern
ing committee of the Stanford Medical Cen
ter is under your supervision. The connec
tions between the Stanford University and
the Stanford Medical Center are clear.
We implore you, President Hennessy,
to recognize your role in the current labor
dispute by supporting the 1,400 Stanford
Medical Center workers when they strike
on Wednesday. We invite you to join stu
dents and workers at the picket line at
noon at the Stanford Hospital. Finally, we
ask that you respond to our requests fora
Code of Conduct to formally and broadly
address Stanford's continuing cycle of
labor disputes.
