# CAMPUS VIEWPOINTS
## Filipino war veterans should receive equal recognition, honor 
### MARLENE DOMINGUEZ GUEST COLUMNIST 
Most of the country sees Veterans Day
as a day off from work or school. Some will
catch the early sales at the shopping mall,
and others will just spend some time at
home watching TV. The honor of this day
has simply faded into a holiday. However,
for veterans, it is a day to remember fallen
comrades and remember the courageous
sacrifices they made. These veterans
risked their lives for the freedom that
America promised to them and the free
dom that we all enjoy.
Unfortunately, recognition and honor
cannot be shared by all U.S. veterans.
These Filipino veterans bravely served
under the U.S. flag and marched side by

side with their fellow American legion at
the Veteran's Parade â€” but not as recog
nized veterans but rather as civilians.
It has been 61 years since about
140,000 Filipino soldiers were drafted to
serve in the United States military during
World War 11. Their reward for that ser
vice was the Rescission Act of 1946, which
stripped them from the same promised
rights and privileges given to other WWII
U.S. veterans. Out of the 66 allied coun
tries that fought under the U.S. flag dur
ing that war, only the Philippines was sin
gled out and denied benefits.
"[These] valiant Filipino soldiers
fought, died and suffered in some of the
bloodiest battles of World War 11, defend
ing beleaguered Bataan and Corregidor,
and thousands of Filipino prisoners of war

endured the infamous Bataan Death
March and years of captivity," reads a
1996 proclamation signed by former U.S.
President Bill Clinton. "We acknowledge
the important role Filipino soldiers played
in turning back aggression, defending lib
erty, and preserving democracy, and we
extend to them our abiding thanks."
Gratitude is cheap. In 1946, when the
Philippines gained independence, the Fil
ipino soldiers lost the full medical and
pension benefits given to other U.S. veter
ans. Since they have been ignored, they
are living in isolation and poverty. The
San Francisco Chronicle reported in 1993
that 17 Filipino war veterans were held in
virtual slavery in Richmond, Calif.,
chained, beaten or otherwise abused as the
occasion demanded.

Veterans have been fighting for several
years to restore their benefits and the honor
that comes with them. As a country, we
need to acknowledge their contributions to
the defense of democracy. To correct this
iniquitous treatment and injustice to the
veterans, legislation needs to be passed by
Congress repealing the 1946 Rescission
Act. We need to restore their dignity and
equal benefits that are long overdue.
This is an urgent call for all Americans
to support our veterans, whose numbers
are quickly diminishing. Today there are
only 12,000 surviving Filipino-American
veterans in the U.S. and 35,000 Filipino
veterans in the Philippines who are still
waiting to seejustice in their lifetime.
"A great honor would be to earn the
dignity and respect as a veteran," says Eric

I)avao, a veteran. "Give the benefits to
them now so we can enjoy them fora short
period of time, at least."
Since most surviving WWII veterans
are now in their late 70s and 80s, we do not
have the luxury of waiting any longer. The
Filipino American Veterans Equity Bill of
2002 (H.R. 491) must be passed now.
Come out to White Plaza today to honor
our heroes and join their struggle. Let us
not fail to respect their honor and dignity
any longer. Each time a veteran dies with
out realizing the dream of dignity, injus
tice is ignored. Honor all veterans on Vet
erans Day. Pop the bubble.
