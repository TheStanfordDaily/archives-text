# Frustrated grad student resents new sexual harassment policy
## 
### ILIAS CHRISSOCHOIDIS GUEST COLUMNIST 
More than a decade ago, it was hoped
that the fall of communism would bring an
end to social and individual oppression.
But those days may be back.
The USA Patriot Act is one indication.
Stanford's own revised policy on consen
sual relationships is another. The bulk e
mail students received two weeks ago ad
monished us about "the risks that exist in
consensual sexual or romantic relation
ships between individuals in inherently
unequal positions such as teacher and stu
dent, supervisor and employee, etc." It is
the end of the message, however, that
makes defection to Cuba a possibility:
"The University therefore very strongly
discourages such relationships." Though
nominally referring to the student-teacher
category, the statement's prohibitive tone
conditions everything that came before it.
The revised policy is an offense to the
Stanford community and a violation of the
privacy of University employees. It is also
a form of harassment and the most blatant
case of institutional bullying I have seen in
my years at Stanford.
In its perverted application of social

homeopathy, the policy seeks to treat a
problem by exacerbating it. That is, what is
the nature of harassment, if not the unso
licited exercise of psychological pressure
on a person in an inferior position? By dis
couraging sexual relationships between
certain classes of its employees, Stanford
administrators do exercise pressure on
their work force.
But there's more: The new policy smacks
of class mentality. Personal intimacy is re
served for members on the same employ
ment level. Following that argument, assis
tant professors should not date tenured fac
ulty; students should not develop crushes
on academic staff; deans should limit their
search of happiness to endowed chairs; and,
the worst tragedy of all, TAs should reserve
their libido only for fellow TAs.
Sexual segregation is not the reason we
came to Stanford. No employer has the
right to shape the private lives of his em
ployees, especially when he poses as a bas
tion of civil rights. Stanford administrators
have no business to encourage, discour
age, recommend or disapprove of our in
tellectual, emotional or sexual partners.
They are not our mothers or fathers and,
from now on, hardly even the enlightened
employers they imagine themselves to be.

Teachers marry their students. Em
ployers get engaged to their employees.
We forget that it is the response of heart,
not the calculating mind, that allows an in
timate relationship to flourish.
In the recent past, Stanford has suf
fered a number of expensive and reputa
tion-damaging lawsuits. It is understand
able that its administrators seek to address
the problem, especially in a period of
dwindling revenue. But selecting an unin
telligent, impractical and offensive policy
will do no good. America's obsession with
sex and power has given rise to untenable
policies that are laughable to other coun
tries. This is largely because of the perva
sive influence of legal mentality in all as
pects of our life.
Harassment is an exception to the
norm of sexual relationships. But in legal
practice, exceptions are more important
than the norm because they define the
borders of a practice, hence its legal status.
And of course, they generate litigation —
expensive litigation. Administrators are
therefore obliged to define their policies
on the basis of exceptions rather than of
norms. Thus, harassment becomes the
yardstick for revising a policy affecting all
of us. We are asked to refrain from sexual

ly engaging with our inferiors to prevent
the possibility of creating victims. But
then, who is the real victim?
Think, for example, that many of us do
not even have a private life — being either
overwhelmed with academic work or sim
ply afraid of "earning" the harasser stigma
from socially uneducated females —
which makes the discouragement policy
doubly ridiculous. In effect, it restricts
even further the already limited opportu
nities for sexual relief and emotional ful
fillment at Stanford.
Instead of practicing fundamentalism,
Stanford should better educate its com
munity. There are students, for instance,
who do not understand what harassment
means. Discomfort or annoyance with
someone attracted to a student is no
ground for leveling accusations. Nor
should a teacher be automatically under
suspicion when manipulative students
play the harassment card to negotiate
their grade. If psychological pressure is
the key here, it is practiced by all parties —
including both the employer who perse
cutes an employee on sexual accounts and
the student who challenges a teacher with
her sartorial minimalism or verbal insinu
ations. Ballooning the one form by sup

pressing the other is unfair and nourishes
resistance to such policies.
I suggest, then, that the discourage
ment policy be applied directly to its in
spirers: We strongly discourage you, nay
forbid you, to tell us how to run our pri
vate lives. Our lives do not belong to you.
The excerpt you sent us constitutes insti
tutional harassment and merits legal con
test. If some among you have lost their
common sense, we'll gladly help them re
cover it — in a court of law.

I lias Chrissochoidis, a doctoral candidate in the
most relational of arts (music), has returned the
offensive e-mail to its author as unacceptable.
His immediate plans include a Valentine Day's
excursion with a person in an inherently un
equal position to his.
