# Students and faculty celebrate bounty of community farm
## Harvest of happy faces 
### TORI BABIN 
Hidden just at the edge of campus,
there is a one-acre oasis where you can
find everything from lavender to limes
grown by students, faculty and other
members of the Stanford community.
This past Saturday, students who work on
the farm invited others to share with them
the beauty of the community farm at the
First Annual Fall Harvest Festival.
"[At the farm], one can escape to connect
physically, mentally and spiritually with the
land that feeds us," said Farm Coordinator
sophomore Abby Hall.
The festival that took place Saturday at
the farm proved to be more than just an
escape; it was a celebration of the spirit of
the farm, the coming season, and most of
all, the community. Apple tasting, pump
kin carving, student musical perfor
mances and face painting, plus a delicious
organic lunch provided by Dining Ser
vices all added to the enjoyment.
All of the proceeds from the event went
to support the Stanford Farm and its
"wish list," which includes an irrigation
system, seeds, a garden cart and, most of
all, smiling faces.
Farm coordinators Drew Harwell said
he thought the festival was successful in
bringing people out to the farm. The
smiles on Saturday, from young children
to graduate students and faculty, con

firmed that the festival was a complete
success in checking off items from the
wish list, promoting the benefits of organ
ic farming and inviting everyone in the
community to explore the produce in this
treasure of the Stanford community.
The festival, inspired by last year's Stu
dent Initiated Course on organic farming,
also exhibited a workshop on alternative
building. This construction technique recy
cles materials and uses tires, hay and earth
plaster to create natural-looking structures.
Under construction at the moment is a
large bench structure on display on the
farm property.
The farm not only promotes organic
farming, but it also helps to provide edu
cation on sustainability through projects
like alternative building and workshops
that take place every Thursday from 3
p.m. to 6 p.m., with topics ranging from
composting to winter crop covering and
soil health.
The farm reaches much of the Stanford
campus, composting food waste from the
Kool Cafe in the Cantor Arts Center, Olive's
in Bldg. 160 and Chi Theta Chi. The co-op
helps to support the farm, buying a basket
of fresh produce from it each week.
But, most of all, the farm welcomes stu
dents and the entire community to take a
trip out to the farm, to escape fora little
while and take advantage of a great re
source available right on campus grounds.
