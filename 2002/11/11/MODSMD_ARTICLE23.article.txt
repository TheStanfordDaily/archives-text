Football
Saturday: No. 10 USC 49, Stanford 17

In the end, though, it was Stanford
(2-7, 1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) that got
railroaded.
No. 10 USC (7-2, 5-1) rolled to a 49-
17 victory over the hapless Cardinal at
Stanford Stadium behind record-setting
days by senior quarterback Carson
Palmer and freshman wideout Mike
Williams.
Palmer passed for 238 yards and four
touchdowns, giving him 61 touchdown
tosses in his career and breaking Rob
Johnson's USC record of 58. Mean
while, the 6-foot-5 Williams caught
eight balls, giving him 57 on the year,
breaking the freshman Pac-10 record
set by Washington's Reggie Williams
last season.
Palmer wasn't content with his per
formance, though, as he and the Trojans
ended the Cardinal's three-game win
streak over USC.
"I'm mad, I'm frustrated and I'm
angry," Palmer said. "We should have
scored every time we had the ball."
Stanford redshirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter was a perfect 14-of-14

passing for 95 yards in the first half,
while senior Kerry Carter and sopho
more Kenneth Tolon combined for 73
yards rushing on 18 carries. But the Car
dinal still found itself in a 21-10 halftime
hole, thanks to Palmer's precision pass
ing and a botched punt return.
After holding USC to a three-and-out
on the Trojans' first possession of the
game, the Cardinal saw Tom Malone's
punt bounce off freshman T. |. Rushing.
The Trojans recovered the live ball, and,
on the next play, Palmer lofted a lazy pass
into the end zone to a wide-open Keary
Colbert, giving USC the early 7-0 lead.
" Barring the punt that rolled into one

of us, it was a pretty solid 30 minutes of
football," head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The Cardinal came right back after
the mishap, powered by Carter's 36
yards on seven carries. Matter found se
nior wide receiver Ryan Wells coming
across the back of the end zone to tie the
game with 4:50 remaining in the open
ing period.
The Trojans stormed back to score
three minutes later, as Palmer stood tall
in the pocket against a blitz and found
Williams for an 8-vard touchdown.

Senior wide receiver Ryan Wells eludes two USC defenders during Saturday's game. Wells caught
four passes for 34 yards and scored a touchdown during the loss.
Stanford tried to even it up
once again, driving 56 yards in 10
plays before facing third-and-goal
on the Trojan 2-yard line. Matter
rolled out right, but couldn't make
a decision and was sacked by Matt
Grootegoed — one of three sacks
for the linebacker and one ofseven
for USC] on the day.
"A lot of it was secondary pres
sure," Teevens said. "That's part
of the learning process a quarter
back goes through."
Freshman placekic ker Michael
Sgroi salvaged the drive by boot
ing a 25-yard field goal, pulling
the Cardinal within four points.
But Stanford would not threaten
again fora long time, sandwiching
five punts, a turnover on downs
and a lost fumble between the field
goal and its next score, a fourth
quarter touchdown.
Senior All-American safety
Troy Polamalu lead the Trojans'
defense, recording 13 tackles and
a sack.
"Polamalu is just a tremen
dous football player," Teevens
said. "They did a nice job pres
suring."
USC scored with 5:50 remain
ing in the half, as senior tailback
Justin Fargas exploded through
the line fora 9-yard touchdown.
Fhe Trojans received to start
the second half and came out with
an aggressive, pass-heavy attack.
Palmer threw a 13-yard scoring
pass to Colbert — who was 20
yards from the nearest Cardinal
defender — 2:4(5 into the half.
Williams fumbled on the Stan
ford 25-yard line on the Trojans'
next drive, but Matter threw his
first incomplete pass of the day
one play later, as defensive end
Kenechi Udeze tipped and then
intercepted Matter's pass at the
line of scrimmage.
"It seems like once we get into a
rhythm after halftime, everything
turns out great," Polamalu said.
"It's about us gaining confidence
and running with it."
Stanford's defense failed to
pick up tight end Alex Holmes on
the next play, as he caught
Palmer's pass on the 10 and rum
bled into the end zone fora 22-
yard score with 7:44 left in the
third quarter.
After Stanford turned the ball
over on downs on the Trojan 29-

yard line, fullback Malaefou
Mackenzie caught a 21-yard pass
and broke off a 37-yard rush
around left end before scoring on
a 4-yard rush to give USC a 42-17
advantage four seconds into the
final period.
Since the Trojans had long
since shut down the Cardinal s
short routes, Matter looked for,
and had success with, intermedi
ate routes on the next possession,
including his 11-yard fade pass to
sophomore wide receiver Ieyo
Johnson for Stanford s last
touchdown.
Wells started that drive with a
34-yard kickoff return, boosting
him lo 150 return yards on the day
as the return unit effectively
blocked for him for the first time
all year.
"We did the same things [as we
always do]," Wells said ol the
breakthrough. "Coach Feevens
told us this week, it's like a stone: 11
you keep hitting that stone, even
tually it's going to break."
On its next drive, USC contin
ued to do the same things it had
done all evening, and the Cardinal
defense, already broken by
Palmer's relentless passing attack
and the Trojans' experienced
rushing game, lei senior Sultan
McCullough run untouched into
the end zone with 8:53 left for the
final margin.
Despite the Cardinal's fourth
loss by at least three touchdowns in
nine games this season, Teevens
emphasized the pride he has for
his players.
"These guys are just working
their butts off, and that's all you
can ask," he said.

Saturday: No. 10 USC 49, Stanford 17

In the end, though, it was Stanford
(2-7, 1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) that got
railroaded.
No. 10 USC (7-2, 5-1) rolled to a 49-
17 victory over the hapless Cardinal at
Stanford Stadium behind record-setting
days by senior quarterback Carson
Palmer and freshman wideout Mike
Williams.
Palmer passed for 238 yards and four
touchdowns, giving him 61 touchdown
tosses in his career and breaking Rob
Johnson's USC record of 58. Mean
while, the 6-foot-5 Williams caught
eight balls, giving him 57 on the year,
breaking the freshman Pac-10 record
set by Washington's Reggie Williams
last season.
Palmer wasn't content with his per
formance, though, as he and the Trojans
ended the Cardinal's three-game win
streak over USC.
"I'm mad, I'm frustrated and I'm
angry," Palmer said. "We should have
scored every time we had the ball."
Stanford redshirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter was a perfect 14-of-14

passing for 95 yards in the first half,
while senior Kerry Carter and sopho
more Kenneth Tolon combined for 73
yards rushing on 18 carries. But the Car
dinal still found itself in a 21-10 halftime
hole, thanks to Palmer's precision pass
ing and a botched punt return.
After holding USC to a three-and-out
on the Trojans' first possession of the
game, the Cardinal saw Tom Malone's
punt bounce off freshman T. |. Rushing.
The Trojans recovered the live ball, and,
on the next play, Palmer lofted a lazy pass
into the end zone to a wide-open Keary
Colbert, giving USC the early 7-0 lead.
" Barring the punt that rolled into one

of us, it was a pretty solid 30 minutes of
football," head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The Cardinal came right back after
the mishap, powered by Carter's 36
yards on seven carries. Matter found se
nior wide receiver Ryan Wells coming
across the back of the end zone to tie the
game with 4:50 remaining in the open
ing period.
The Trojans stormed back to score
three minutes later, as Palmer stood tall
in the pocket against a blitz and found
Williams for an 8-vard touchdown.


WILLIAM WEST/The Stanford Daily
Senior wide receiver Ryan Wells eludes two USC defenders during Saturday's game. Wells caught
four passes for 34 yards and scored a touchdown during the loss.
Stanford tried to even it up
once again, driving 56 yards in 10
plays before facing third-and-goal
on the Trojan 2-yard line. Matter
rolled out right, but couldn't make
a decision and was sacked by Matt
Grootegoed — one of three sacks
for the linebacker and one ofseven
for USC] on the day.
"A lot of it was secondary pres
sure," Teevens said. "That's part
of the learning process a quarter
back goes through."
Freshman placekic ker Michael
Sgroi salvaged the drive by boot
ing a 25-yard field goal, pulling
the Cardinal within four points.
But Stanford would not threaten
again fora long time, sandwiching
five punts, a turnover on downs
and a lost fumble between the field
goal and its next score, a fourth
quarter touchdown.
Senior All-American safety
Troy Polamalu lead the Trojans'
defense, recording 13 tackles and
a sack.
"Polamalu is just a tremen
dous football player," Teevens
said. "They did a nice job pres
suring."
USC scored with 5:50 remain
ing in the half, as senior tailback
Justin Fargas exploded through
the line fora 9-yard touchdown.
Fhe Trojans received to start
the second half and came out with
an aggressive, pass-heavy attack.
Palmer threw a 13-yard scoring
pass to Colbert — who was 20
yards from the nearest Cardinal
defender — 2:4(5 into the half.
Williams fumbled on the Stan
ford 25-yard line on the Trojans'
next drive, but Matter threw his
first incomplete pass of the day
one play later, as defensive end
Kenechi Udeze tipped and then
intercepted Matter's pass at the
line of scrimmage.
"It seems like once we get into a
rhythm after halftime, everything
turns out great," Polamalu said.
"It's about us gaining confidence
and running with it."
Stanford's defense failed to
pick up tight end Alex Holmes on
the next play, as he caught
Palmer's pass on the 10 and rum
bled into the end zone fora 22-
yard score with 7:44 left in the
third quarter.
After Stanford turned the ball
over on downs on the Trojan 29-

yard line, fullback Malaefou
Mackenzie caught a 21-yard pass
and broke off a 37-yard rush
around left end before scoring on
a 4-yard rush to give USC a 42-17
advantage four seconds into the
final period.
Since the Trojans had long
since shut down the Cardinal s
short routes, Matter looked for,
and had success with, intermedi
ate routes on the next possession,
including his 11-yard fade pass to
sophomore wide receiver Ieyo
Johnson for Stanford s last
touchdown.
Wells started that drive with a
34-yard kickoff return, boosting
him lo 150 return yards on the day
as the return unit effectively
blocked for him for the first time
all year.
"We did the same things [as we
always do]," Wells said ol the
breakthrough. "Coach Feevens
told us this week, it's like a stone: 11
you keep hitting that stone, even
tually it's going to break."
On its next drive, USC contin
ued to do the same things it had
done all evening, and the Cardinal
defense, already broken by
Palmer's relentless passing attack
and the Trojans' experienced

McCullough run untouched into

pass to Colbert — who was 20
yards from the nearest Cardinal
defender — 2:4(5 into the half.
Williams fumbled on the Stan
ford 25-yard line on the Trojans'
next drive, but Matter threw his
first incomplete pass of the day
one play later, as defensive end
Kenechi Udeze tipped and then
intercepted Matter's pass at the
line of scrimmage.
"It seems like once we get into a
rhythm after halftime, everything
turns out great," Polamalu said.
"It's about us gaining confidence
and running with it."
Stanford's defense failed to
pick up tight end Alex Holmes on
the next play, as he caught
Palmer's pass on the 10 and rum
bled into the end zone fora 22-
yard score with 7:44 left in the
third quarter.
After Stanford turned the ball
over on downs on the Trojan 29-

yard line, fullback Malaefou
Mackenzie caught a 21-yard pass
and broke off a 37-yard rush
around left end before scoring on
a 4-yard rush to give USC a 42-17
advantage four seconds into the
final period.
Since the Trojans had long
since shut down the Cardinal s
short routes, Matter looked for,
and had success with, intermedi
ate routes on the next possession,
including his 11-yard fade pass to
sophomore wide receiver Ieyo
Johnson for Stanford s last
touchdown.
Wells started that drive with a
34-yard kickoff return, boosting
him lo 150 return yards on the day
as the return unit effectively
blocked for him for the first time
all year.
"We did the same things [as we
always do]," Wells said ol the
breakthrough. "Coach Feevens
told us this week, it's like a stone: 11
you keep hitting that stone, even
tually it's going to break."
On its next drive, USC contin
ued to do the same things it had
done all evening, and the Cardinal
defense, already broken by
Palmer's relentless passing attack
and the Trojans' experienced
rushing game, lei senior Sultan
McCullough run untouched into
the end zone with 8:53 left for the
final margin.
Despite the Cardinal's fourth
loss by at least three touchdowns in
nine games this season, Teevens
emphasized the pride he has for
his players.
"These guys are just working
their butts off, and that's all you
can ask," he said.
