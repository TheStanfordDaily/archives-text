In its show before Saturday evening's
football game, Southern California's

Saturday: No. 10 USC 49, Stanford 17

In the end, though, it was Stanford
(2-7, 1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) that got
railroaded.
No. 10 USC (7-2, 5-1) rolled to a 49-
17 victory over the hapless Cardinal at
Stanford Stadium behind record-setting
days by senior quarterback Carson
Palmer and freshman wideout Mike
Williams.
Palmer passed for 238 yards and four
touchdowns, giving him 61 touchdown
tosses in his career and breaking Rob
Johnson's USC record of 58. Mean
while, the 6-foot-5 Williams caught
eight balls, giving him 57 on the year,
breaking the freshman Pac-10 record
set by Washington's Reggie Williams
last season.
Palmer wasn't content with his per
formance, though, as he and the Trojans
ended the Cardinal's three-game win
streak over USC.
"I'm mad, I'm frustrated and I'm
angry," Palmer said. "We should have
scored every time we had the ball."
Stanford redshirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter was a perfect 14-of-14

passing for 95 yards in the first half,
while senior Kerry Carter and sopho
more Kenneth Tolon combined for 73
yards rushing on 18 carries. But the Car
dinal still found itself in a 21-10 halftime
hole, thanks to Palmer's precision pass
ing and a botched punt return.
After holding USC to a three-and-out
on the Trojans' first possession of the
game, the Cardinal saw Tom Malone's
punt bounce off freshman T. |. Rushing.
The Trojans recovered the live ball, and,
on the next play, Palmer lofted a lazy pass
into the end zone to a wide-open Keary
Colbert, giving USC the early 7-0 lead.
" Barring the punt that rolled into one

of us, it was a pretty solid 30 minutes of
football," head coach Buddy Teevens
said.
The Cardinal came right back after
the mishap, powered by Carter's 36
yards on seven carries. Matter found se
nior wide receiver Ryan Wells coming
across the back of the end zone to tie the
game with 4:50 remaining in the open
ing period.
The Trojans stormed back to score
three minutes later, as Palmer stood tall
in the pocket against a blitz and found
Williams for an 8-vard touchdown.
