# USC exposes other Stanford weaknesses
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Everything was clicking in the first half for
the Stanford football team's offense. Redshirt
freshman quarterback Kyle Matter was a
perfect 14-of-14 passing, while senior Kerry
Carter and sophomore Kenneth Tolon com
bined for 73 yards on 18 carries.
All season, mistakes, dropped passes and
other miscues had caused the Cardinal (2-7,
1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) to wonder what
could happen if the offense didn't make any
mistakes.

"l think it's just a matter of getting things
going — making plays when you have the
opportunities," head coach Buddy Teevens
said after Stanford's 36-11 loss to Washing
ton State on Oct. 12. "We're trying to make
the pass, and if we do, the game is going to go
differently."
"The first seven games, we've stopped
ourselves," junior receiver Luke Powell said
after the Cardinal's 41-14 loss to Oregon last
week. "We had key dropped passes."
Finally, on Saturday, Stanford did what it
wanted to do. The run was working, and
ever)' single pass thrown was a pass caught.

Finally, Stanford saw what the offense
could do if it didn't make any mistakes.
The result?
A 13-play drive fora touchdown, an 11-
play drive ending in a field goal, three punts
and a 21-10 halftime deficit to No. 10 South
ern California (7-2, 5-1).
Stanford found out that a grinding run
ning game and passing game that looks un
derneath, underneath and underneath
some more, even when mistake-free, is just
not good enough to keep up with the Pac-

10's high-powered offenses.
"We wanted to attack them un
derneath," said Matter, who fin
ished 23-of-35 for just 165 yards,
"but we have to connect on some
deeper shots in order to be success
ful as an offense."
Matter's longest completion of
the game was to tight end Alex
Smith for 17 yards in the first
quarter, as the passing game was

comprised mostly of screen pass
es, short crossing routes and
other quick hits.
When Matter found senior wide
out Ryan Wells in the end zone to tie
the score at 7-7 in the first quarter, it
represented the first time Stanford
had come back from a deficit to tie
or lead a game since its Sept. 14 win
over San Jose Suite. In that game,
the Spartans held 3-oand 10-7 leads
in the first quarter of a game t hat the
Cardinal came back to win, 63-26.
Angry at having allowed Stan
ford to move the ball in the first half,
USC came out in the second half

with a focus on stopping the Cardi
nal's short-yardage game plan.
"After they came out and drove
on us, our coaches made adjust
ments and put us in better situa
tions," Trojan linebacker Matt
Grootegoed said.
Stanford, though, didn't make
any adjustments. The Cardinal
continued to stick with running the
ball into the line and the short pass
ing game in the second half.
"We haven't demonstrated
the ability to close the gap,"
Teevens said. "It is an adjust
ment phase . . . you stay with it,

as frustrating as it may be, and
just keep pounding away."
Pounding is not the problem for
a Stanford team that ranks fourth in
the Pac-10 in rushing (141.4 yards
per game). Rather, it is a passing
game that is last in the conference
(179.6 yards per game), ranking 60
yards behind ninth-place UCLA,
which starts a true freshman at
quarterback.
Football is a game of inches, but
with its quarterback problems this
season, the Stanford offense seems
to have taken that sentiment a little
too literally.

had come back from a deficit to tie
or lead a game since its Sept. 14 win
over San Jose Suite. In that game,
the Spartans held 3-oand 10-7 leads
in the first quarter of a game t hat the
Cardinal came back to win, 63-26.
Angry at having allowed Stan
ford to move the ball in the first half,
USC came out in the second half

with a focus on stopping the Cardi
nal's short-yardage game plan.
"After they came out and drove
on us, our coaches made adjust
ments and put us in better situa
tions," Trojan linebacker Matt
Grootegoed said.
Stanford, though, didn't make
any adjustments. The Cardinal
continued to stick with running the
ball into the line and the short pass
ing game in the second half.
"We haven't demonstrated
the ability to close the gap,"
Teevens said. "It is an adjust
ment phase . . . you stay with it,

as frustrating as it may be, and
just keep pounding away."
Pounding is not the problem for
a Stanford team that ranks fourth in
the Pac-10 in rushing (141.4 yards
per game). Rather, it is a passing
game that is last in the conference
(179.6 yards per game), ranking 60
yards behind ninth-place UCLA,
which starts a true freshman at
quarterback.
Football is a game of inches, but
with its quarterback problems this
season, the Stanford offense seems
to have taken that sentiment a little
too literally.
