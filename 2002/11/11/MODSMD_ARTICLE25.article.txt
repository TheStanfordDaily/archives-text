# Women clinch Pac-10 title with Arizona sweep
## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's soccer team
went into this weekend knowing that one win in its two
games would give it ■. sha»e of the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.
But a share wasn't what the Cardinal was looking for
— it wanted the title for itself.

Women's Soccer
Friday: No. 1 Stanford 2, No. 25 Arizona State 0
Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 6, Arizona 0

The team's two wins this weekend gave it exactly
that — sole possession of this year's Pac-10 title, an au
tomatic berth into the NCAA tournament and an im
proved record of 18-1-0.
The Cardinal's 2-0 win over Arizona State on a rainy
Friday night guaranteed at least a share of the title with
UCLA, depending on yesterday's results. Yet even Fri
day night, it was apparent that the team didn't consid
er its conference season at all finished.
"The championship feels good," co-coach
Stephanie Erickson said Friday night. "But we want it
outright. That's our goal. We're not done yet. We don't
want to share.''
Fhe Cardinal made sure that it didn't have to share
anything with the Bruins, last year's conference cham
pions, after a 6-0 defeat of Arizona yesterday.
Overall, the weekend's games gave the Cardinal a
conference record of 9-0, with only one goal allowed
in those matches. Fhe team ends the regular season
after posting 14 shutouts in its 19 games — a feat not
only attributable to standout sophomore keeper
Nicole Barnhart, but also to an incredibly strong
team defense.


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward Jennifer Farenbaugh runs down the ball against Arizona yesterday. The
Cardinal captured the Pacific-10 Conference title with a 6-0 win over the Wildcats.
It was a member of that de
fense that first got the squad on
the scoreboard this weekend, as
freshman defender Haley Hunt
notched her first collegiate goal
in the 36th minute of Friday's
contest.
A run down the flank by fresh
man striker Jennifer Faren
baugh appeared to cross the
backline after a Stanford touch,
yet the referee awarded a corner
kick. Stanford took full advan
tage of the opportunity as junior
striker Marcie Ward served a ball
into i he box right to Hunt, who
headed it just inside the post for
what would stand up to be the
game-winning goal, despite
protests from Arizona State
coach Ray Leone.
"It was the perfect ball from
Marcie," Hunt said after the game.
"It was just an amazing cross, and
it landed perfectly on my head, so
it was just right there for me."
Hunt's praise for her team
mate was echoed in Erickson's
praise for her.

"Haley is unreal for us," Erick
son said. "We expected her to do
well, but she's so consistent and
composed all the time. She's ex
ceptional — one of the best center
backs in the country."
Farenbaugh continued to
pester the Sun Devil defense with
sharp runs along the sides, and
while Ward and senior striker
Marcia Wallis would both have
chances in the first half, neither
could find the back of the net in the
first 45 minutes.
The second half featured more
intense play as the field surface be
came even more muddy.
While both defenses seemed to
clamp down and contain play
within the middle third of the
field, Ward was able to break
through and increase the Cardinal
lead in the 62nd minute. After
chesting down a cross from mid
field, the junior settled the ball and
laced a shot from the left wing over
the advancing keeper into the far
side netting.
Yesterday, the rain decreased,
and the goals increased. The Car
dinal wasted no time getting on
the board as Wallis found the back
of the net on the team's first shot,
just 1:45 into the game. Wallis took

a pass from Ward off of a set piece
and beat the keeper for an early
lead Stanford would never relin
quish.
While the goal proved to be the
game-winning goal of the champi
onship-clinching game, it was im
portant for Ward as well, as it gave
her 34 assists in her career, which
ties her for the all-time Stanford
record.
Ward herself would score the
second goal of the game, taking a
pass from senior midfielder Becky
Myers and heading it past the
keeper for the score in the ninth
minute.
The Cardinal would tally three
more goals before halftime as
Farenbaugh marked in the 32nd
minute, senior Kelsey Carlson in
the 40th and Wallis again in the
43rd.
farenbaugh added the team's
final goal in the 62nd minute, just
two minutes after the Wildcats'
best scoring chance, coming when
a free kick required a diving save
from Barnhart.
The Cardinal will now wait
until 1:30 p.m. today for news on
its next opponent, when the
NCAA tournament brackets are
announced.
