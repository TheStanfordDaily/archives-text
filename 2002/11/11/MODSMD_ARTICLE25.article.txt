## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's soccer team
went into this weekend knowing that one win in its two
games would give it ■. sha»e of the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.
But a share wasn't what the Cardinal was looking for
— it wanted the title for itself.

Friday: No. 1 Stanford 2, No. 25 Arizona State 0
Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 6, Arizona 0

The team's two wins this weekend gave it exactly
that — sole possession of this year's Pac-10 title, an au
tomatic berth into the NCAA tournament and an im
proved record of 18-1-0.
The Cardinal's 2-0 win over Arizona State on a rainy
Friday night guaranteed at least a share of the title with
UCLA, depending on yesterday's results. Yet even Fri
day night, it was apparent that the team didn't consid
er its conference season at all finished.
"The championship feels good," co-coach
Stephanie Erickson said Friday night. "But we want it
outright. That's our goal. We're not done yet. We don't
want to share.''
Fhe Cardinal made sure that it didn't have to share
anything with the Bruins, last year's conference cham
pions, after a 6-0 defeat of Arizona yesterday.
Overall, the weekend's games gave the Cardinal a
conference record of 9-0, with only one goal allowed
in those matches. Fhe team ends the regular season
after posting 14 shutouts in its 19 games — a feat not
only attributable to standout sophomore keeper
Nicole Barnhart, but also to an incredibly strong
team defense.
