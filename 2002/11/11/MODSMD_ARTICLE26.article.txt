The best of times, the worst of
times — an adequate description
of the Stanford men's soccer
team's weekend.

Men's Soccer
Friday: No. 19 Stanford 2, Fresno State 0
Yesterday: No. 5 UCLA 1, Stanford 0

Fighting off the ugly face of
Mother Nature all weekend, the
No. 19 Cardinal (12-4-2, 3-3-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) finally was
able to get a monkey off its back,
only to have it jump right back on
two days later.
Kept scoreless for its previous
four Pac-10 matches, Stanford for
ward Darren Fernandez finally
broke the streak with a rebound
goal against Fresno State (5-9-4, 2-
5-1) in the first half of Friday
night's 2-0 Cardinal win at Mal
oney Field.
Monkey off?
Not for long.
Stanford's scoring woes re
turned yesterday, as perennial
rival No.' 5 UCLA (12-3-2, 7-2-0)
escaped Maloney with a 1-0 win.
Stanford dominated the first
half, but it was all for naught as the
Cardinal couldn't find the back of
the net. Hie game remained store
less at the half .
From the start of the second
half, the tides turned and the Bru
ins took charge, culminating in a
Cliff McKinley goal in the 64th
minute, giving UCLA a 1-0 lead.

The next 26 minutes did not
have a single dull moment as the
Cardinal put on tons of offensive
pressure in hopes of sending the
game into overtime.
However, as was the case dur
ing its scoreless streak, the Cardi
nal did not get any love from the
soccer gods, as numerous shots
and passes were just inches from
resulting in a score.
Once again, close but no cigar.
The Bruins' defense held on
and recorded a crucial 1-0 confer
ence victory on the muddy Mal
oney Field.
"The first half was a bit of a
struggle for us, because the field
was slippery," McKinley ex
plained. "We were a lot better
team in the second half. The ener
gy changed, and we got to know
the field a bit better. This game all
came from the heart, and I'm real
ly proud of our guys. We battled
and it just feels good getting [the
game] out of the way."
Senior forward Roger
Levesque, unlucky on his one shot
for the day, expressed disappoint
ment.
"After Friday night, we were ex
cited coming into [the UCLA]
game," he said. "The field condi
tions deteriorated as the game
went on, so there was not a lot of
space to run on. UCLA is really
good with counterattacks, and all it
took was one to get the goal. We
gave it everything we had at the
end."
In the first half, Stanford put on
a dominating show of excellent
ball control against the Bruins.
Unfortunately, time of posses
sion does not result in victories.
Despite a 7-1 shot advantage in
the first half, Stanford once again
was unable to finish the deed.
Defender Taylor Graham had a
prime opportunity in the 25th
minute as his header just barely
flew over the top of the UCLA goal
off a corner kick.
Stanford saw another close call
later in the first half when
Levesque took a great pass from
Sean Whalen and missed the goal
just wide right, in a scene all too fa
miliar to the Cardinal the last few
weeks.
After the Bruins' goal, the Car
dinal had three close chances in
the final 10 minutes, but it just
wasn't meant to be.
"There were plenty of chances
up front," said Cardinal head
coach Bret Simon about his team's
offense. "However, the [UCLA]
defense was good; the goalkeeper
was good. They made the right
plays. I've never seen a team [like
Stanford] with this many talented
players playing this well and not
scoring goals. It's just a matter of
the team staying confident and
knowing that some days, those
shots will go in. Hopefully, those
days are coming soon."
Those days seemed to have ar
rived on Friday night.
In the 20th minute of the game
against the Bulldogs, Levesque
fired a shot that Bulldogs keeper
Jeremy Proud stopped, but Fer
nandez snapped Stanford's 13-pe
riod scoring draught with a follow
up goal.
In the second half, sophomore
forward Janusz was able to break
free up the center of the field, and

midfielder Clayton Peters served a
well-placed long ball that Janusz
won and put into the back of the
net for the 2-0 Cardinal victory.
"We're certainly very glad to
score a couple of goals and get a
win," Simon said after Friday's
match. "It's been a while, and
that's important for our confi
dence. It was good, bad and ugly
as far as the play went — kind of

like the day."
Unfortunately, the scoring
trend did not continue yesterday,
and now the Cardinal (11 points)
finds itself lighting for third place
in the Pac-10 with fourth-place
Oregon State, which trails Stan
ford by two points in the standings.
UCLA and No. 9 California are
comfortably ahead with 21 and 19
points, respectively.

later in the first half when
Levesque took a great pass from
Sean Whalen and missed the goal
just wide right, in a scene all too fa
miliar to the Cardinal the last few
weeks.
After the Bruins' goal, the Car
dinal had three close chances in
the final 10 minutes, but it just
wasn't meant to be.
"There were plenty of chances
up front," said Cardinal head
coach Bret Simon about his team's
offense. "However, the [UCLA]
defense was good; the goalkeeper
was good. They made the right
plays. I've never seen a team [like
Stanford] with this many talented
players playing this well and not
scoring goals. It's just a matter of
the team staying confident and
knowing that some days, those
shots will go in. Hopefully, those
days are coming soon."
Those days seemed to have ar
rived on Friday night.
In the 20th minute of the game
against the Bulldogs, Levesque
fired a shot that Bulldogs keeper
Jeremy Proud stopped, but Fer
nandez snapped Stanford's 13-pe
riod scoring draught with a follow
up goal.
In the second half, sophomore
forward Janusz was able to break
free up the center of the field, and

midfielder Clayton Peters served a
well-placed long ball that Janusz
won and put into the back of the
net for the 2-0 Cardinal victory.
"We're certainly very glad to
score a couple of goals and get a
win," Simon said after Friday's
match. "It's been a while, and
that's important for our confi
dence. It was good, bad and ugly
as far as the play went — kind of

like the day."
Unfortunately, the scoring
trend did not continue yesterday,
and now the Cardinal (11 points)
finds itself lighting for third place
in the Pac-10 with fourth-place
Oregon State, which trails Stan
ford by two points in the standings.
UCLA and No. 9 California are
comfortably ahead with 21 and 19
points, respectively.

Senior forward Roger Levesque pulls away from a UCLA defender yester
day. The No. 19 Cardinal fell to the No. 5 Bruins, 1 -0.
The best of times, the worst of
times — an adequate description
of the Stanford men's soccer
team's weekend.

Men's Soccer
Friday: No. 19 Stanford 2, Fresno State 0
Yesterday: No. 5 UCLA 1, Stanford 0

Fighting off the ugly face of
Mother Nature all weekend, the
No. 19 Cardinal (12-4-2, 3-3-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) finally was
able to get a monkey off its back,
only to have it jump right back on
two days later.
Kept scoreless for its previous
four Pac-10 matches, Stanford for
ward Darren Fernandez finally
broke the streak with a rebound
goal against Fresno State (5-9-4, 2-
5-1) in the first half of Friday
night's 2-0 Cardinal win at Mal
oney Field.
Monkey off?
Not for long.
Stanford's scoring woes re
turned yesterday, as perennial
rival No.' 5 UCLA (12-3-2, 7-2-0)
escaped Maloney with a 1-0 win.
Stanford dominated the first
half, but it was all for naught as the
Cardinal couldn't find the back of
the net. Hie game remained store
less at the half .
From the start of the second
half, the tides turned and the Bru
ins took charge, culminating in a
Cliff McKinley goal in the 64th
minute, giving UCLA a 1-0 lead.

The next 26 minutes did not
have a single dull moment as the
Cardinal put on tons of offensive
pressure in hopes of sending the
game into overtime.
However, as was the case dur
ing its scoreless streak, the Cardi
nal did not get any love from the
soccer gods, as numerous shots
and passes were just inches from
resulting in a score.
Once again, close but no cigar.
The Bruins' defense held on
and recorded a crucial 1-0 confer
ence victory on the muddy Mal
oney Field.
"The first half was a bit of a
struggle for us, because the field
was slippery," McKinley ex
plained. "We were a lot better
team in the second half. The ener
gy changed, and we got to know
the field a bit better. This game all
came from the heart, and I'm real
ly proud of our guys. We battled
and it just feels good getting [the
game] out of the way."
Senior forward Roger
Levesque, unlucky on his one shot
for the day, expressed disappoint
ment.
"After Friday night, we were ex
cited coming into [the UCLA]
game," he said. "The field condi
tions deteriorated as the game
went on, so there was not a lot of
space to run on. UCLA is really
good with counterattacks, and all it
took was one to get the goal. We
gave it everything we had at the
end."
In the first half, Stanford put on
a dominating show of excellent
ball control against the Bruins.
Unfortunately, time of posses
sion does not result in victories.
Despite a 7-1 shot advantage in
the first half, Stanford once again
was unable to finish the deed.
Defender Taylor Graham had a
prime opportunity in the 25th
minute as his header just barely
flew over the top of the UCLA goal
off a corner kick.
