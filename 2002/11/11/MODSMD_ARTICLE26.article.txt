The best of times, the worst of
times â€” an adequate description
of the Stanford men's soccer
team's weekend.

Men's Soccer
Friday: No. 19 Stanford 2, Fresno State 0
Yesterday: No. 5 UCLA 1, Stanford 0

Fighting off the ugly face of
Mother Nature all weekend, the
No. 19 Cardinal (12-4-2, 3-3-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) finally was
able to get a monkey off its back,
only to have it jump right back on
two days later.
Kept scoreless for its previous
four Pac-10 matches, Stanford for
ward Darren Fernandez finally
broke the streak with a rebound
goal against Fresno State (5-9-4, 2-
5-1) in the first half of Friday
night's 2-0 Cardinal win at Mal
oney Field.
Monkey off?
Not for long.
Stanford's scoring woes re
turned yesterday, as perennial
rival No.' 5 UCLA (12-3-2, 7-2-0)
escaped Maloney with a 1-0 win.
Stanford dominated the first
half, but it was all for naught as the
Cardinal couldn't find the back of
the net. Hie game remained store
less at the half .
From the start of the second
half, the tides turned and the Bru
ins took charge, culminating in a
Cliff McKinley goal in the 64th
minute, giving UCLA a 1-0 lead.

The next 26 minutes did not
have a single dull moment as the
Cardinal put on tons of offensive
pressure in hopes of sending the
game into overtime.
However, as was the case dur
ing its scoreless streak, the Cardi
nal did not get any love from the
soccer gods, as numerous shots
and passes were just inches from
resulting in a score.
Once again, close but no cigar.
The Bruins' defense held on
and recorded a crucial 1-0 confer
ence victory on the muddy Mal
oney Field.
"The first half was a bit of a
struggle for us, because the field
was slippery," McKinley ex
plained. "We were a lot better
team in the second half. The ener
gy changed, and we got to know
the field a bit better. This game all
came from the heart, and I'm real
ly proud of our guys. We battled
and it just feels good getting [the
game] out of the way."
Senior forward Roger
Levesque, unlucky on his one shot
for the day, expressed disappoint
ment.
"After Friday night, we were ex
cited coming into [the UCLA]
game," he said. "The field condi
tions deteriorated as the game
went on, so there was not a lot of
space to run on. UCLA is really
good with counterattacks, and all it
took was one to get the goal. We
gave it everything we had at the
end."
