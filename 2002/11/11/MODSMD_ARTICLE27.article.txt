I he Cardinal proved yesterday
that it is more than a one-woman
team. With National Player of the
Year candidate Nicole Powell look

bulging disk, her teammates con
vincingly dispatched an athletic and

Basketball 73 (exh.)

savvy Love & Basketball team, 89-
73, at Maples Pavilion in Stanford's
first exhibition game of the season.
Evident during the game were
the Cardinal's strengths, shooting
and passing the ball, along with its
weakness, defending against size.
Love & Basketball is an exhibi
tion team composed of former col
lege players, including recent Stan
lord graduates Charmin Smith,
Melody Peterson, Enjoli Izidorand
Cori Enghusen. Last week, the
team defeated UCLA 77-74.
Early in yesterday's game, Love
& Basketball caused problems for
the Cardinal with intense perime
ter defense and strong post play,
particularly from the 6-foot-7 cen
ter Enghusen, who finished with
17 points.
However, Stanford quickly got
into an offensive rhythm behind
aggressive perimeter shooting,
most notably from sophomore
point guard Susan King, sopho
more guard Sebnem Kimya
cioglu, sophomore forward T'Nae
Thiel and freshman guard Krista
Rappahahn.

The message was clear: Every
(Cardinal player has the green light
and is an offensive weapon. Once
shots began to fall from the perime
ter, junior center Chelsea Trotter
and sophomore forward Azella Fer
ryman had more room to operate
on the block, as they finished with
10 and 13 points, respectively.
When asked about positive as
pects of the game, King pointed to
the Cardinal's balanced attack and
the play of t lie freshmen: guard
Clare Bodensteiner, Rappahan
and center Shelley Nweke (the
team's fourth freshman, Ezimaka
Okafor, is out with an ACL injury).
King, while perhaps not quite
100 percent yet, broke down Love
& Basketball's press, controlled the
ball well and played aggressive
perimeter defense.
Kimyacioglu, whom head coach
Tara VanDerveer calls the team's
most improved player, shot the ball
confidently coming off screens and
finished with 13 points.
"People are looking for their
shots," Kimyacioglu said. "It shows
how versatile we are."
Thiel also helped spread out
Love & Basketball's defense by con
tributing 15 points — the majority
of which came from the perime
ter —while notching a double-dou
ble by pulling down 10 rebounds.
Perhaps the most pleasant sur
prise for the Cardinal yesterday
was the play of 6-foot-5 Nweke.
While still rough around the
edges, the lanky freshman fin
ished with six points and played
aggressively around the paint.
Her defensive presence will be

crucial for an undersized Cardi
nal team this season.
Looking ahead, King cited
perimeter defense as an area that
needs improvement: "We didn't

play great perimeter defense. I
thought we got beaten to the mid
dle a lot. That's one of the things we
talked about after the game and
that we need to work on."
