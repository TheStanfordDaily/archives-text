The buzz around campus may be that
the Stanford-California rivalry is fledg
ling, but rest assured the Stanford field
hockey team has plenty of resentment to
ward Cal.

Friday: Stanford 3, Radford 2
Saturday: California 2, Stanford 1 OT

Actually, the Cardinal's disdain is prob
ably focused solely on Nora Fedderson.
On Saturday, the junior midfielder
scored the game-winning goal against
Stanford, marking the third time this year
that a late Fedderson score has lifted the
Bears to victory over the Cardinal.
Saturday's was the most devastating,
though, as Fedderson's goal 8:44 into
overtime brought the Cardinal's (10-11)
season to an end with a 2-1 loss to Cal (14-

6) in the Northern Pacific Athletic: Con
ference championship game.
"It was very fitting that the champi
onship game came down to California
and Stanford," said Cardinal senior for
ward Amanda Billmyer, who closed out
her Stanford career with 54 points. "I was
really proud of the way our team pulled
together at the end of the season."
Fedderson's score on Saturday was her
second overtime goal against Stanford
this season. Her last one came just a week
ago in a 2-1 Cal win that gave the Bears
the NorPac regular-season title over the
Cardinal.
As in the teams' last meeting, Califor
nia went up early on a goal by Pooja
Mehta. Stanford junior goalkeeper Emily
Zander came out to challenge Mehta on a
breakaway but couldn't control the ball,
allowing Mehta to put one in on the
empty goal only 5:20 into the first half .
And again, as in their last contest, Stan
ford equalized near the end of the half,

when sophomore Eleanor Morgan fired a
diving shot into the back of the net. Senior
Christina Williams was credited with the
assist.
The second half was goose eggs with
no goals by either team, sending the game
to sudden-death overtime, when Fedder
son struck.
"Nora [Fedderson's] international ex
perience is really apparent in her stick
skills," Morgan said. "[Freshman mid
fielder] Missy [ Halliday] did a really good
job of marking her the entire game and
shutting her down through the game."
1 lowever, in overtime the teams must
drop down to seven-on-seven, as opposed
to the 11 players usually on the field for
each team, allowing play to be opened up
and making it much more difficult to de
fend. I lence, goals can be easier to score
in the overtime period, usually prevent
ing the much-hated penalty shootout.

the team's third to Cal this season, eliminated the team from further postseason play.
