# Fedderson ends field hockey's season
## 
### SPENCER PORTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The buzz around campus may be that
the Stanford-California rivalry is fledg
ling, but rest assured the Stanford field
hockey team has plenty of resentment to
ward Cal.

Field Hockey
Friday: Stanford 3, Radford 2
Saturday: California 2, Stanford 1 OT

Actually, the Cardinal's disdain is prob
ably focused solely on Nora Fedderson.
On Saturday, the junior midfielder
scored the game-winning goal against
Stanford, marking the third time this year
that a late Fedderson score has lifted the
Bears to victory over the Cardinal.
Saturday's was the most devastating,
though, as Fedderson's goal 8:44 into
overtime brought the Cardinal's (10-11)
season to an end with a 2-1 loss to Cal (14-

6) in the Northern Pacific Athletic: Con
ference championship game.
"It was very fitting that the champi
onship game came down to California
and Stanford," said Cardinal senior for
ward Amanda Billmyer, who closed out
her Stanford career with 54 points. "I was
really proud of the way our team pulled
together at the end of the season."
Fedderson's score on Saturday was her
second overtime goal against Stanford
this season. Her last one came just a week
ago in a 2-1 Cal win that gave the Bears
the NorPac regular-season title over the
Cardinal.
As in the teams' last meeting, Califor
nia went up early on a goal by Pooja
Mehta. Stanford junior goalkeeper Emily
Zander came out to challenge Mehta on a
breakaway but couldn't control the ball,
allowing Mehta to put one in on the
empty goal only 5:20 into the first half .
And again, as in their last contest, Stan
ford equalized near the end of the half,

when sophomore Eleanor Morgan fired a
diving shot into the back of the net. Senior
Christina Williams was credited with the
assist.
The second half was goose eggs with
no goals by either team, sending the game
to sudden-death overtime, when Fedder
son struck.
"Nora [Fedderson's] international ex
perience is really apparent in her stick
skills," Morgan said. "[Freshman mid
fielder] Missy [ Halliday] did a really good
job of marking her the entire game and
shutting her down through the game."
1 lowever, in overtime the teams must
drop down to seven-on-seven, as opposed
to the 11 players usually on the field for
each team, allowing play to be opened up
and making it much more difficult to de
fend. I lence, goals can be easier to score
in the overtime period, usually prevent
ing the much-hated penalty shootout.

Freshman forward Lyndsay Erickson charges downfield against California yesterday. The loss,
the team's third to Cal this season, eliminated the team from further postseason play.
I'fddt rson, for the second game
against Stanford, used this to her
advantage in scoring the winning
goal.
California will play Patriot
League champion Lafayette on
Tuesday , with the winner of that
contest advancing to the 16-team
NCAA tournament.
Stanford cruised through the
first two rounds of the NorPac
playolfs to make it to Saturday's
final.
Stanford beat its first oppo
nent, Davidson, 3-1 on Thursday,
which was filled with blowouts, as
the top-seeded teams cleaned up
over lower-seeded and out
matched opponents.

Davidson could only muster as
many shots as Stanford had goals
in the game.
"This was a great win for us,"
departing Stanford head coach
Sheryl Johnson said after the
Davidson game. "We had more
people scoring and contributing
today, and that fit into our game
plan."
In semifinal action against Rad
ford on Friday, Stanford fought
through a late scare, as Radford
took a 2-1 lead on the Cardinal in
the second half. But late second
hall goals by senior defender Amrit
Chima and junior forward Noor
Dawood sealed the 3-2 win for the
Cardinal, sending Stanford to the
final.
"Today's game was a great per
formance by our team," Johnson
said after Friday's win. "We had
some awesome goals."

However, Stanford's pesky
problem of finishing reared its ugly
liead yet again in its loss to Califor
nia, with Stanford outshooting the
Golden Bears by a 15-10 margin.
Out of 21 games this season, the
Cardinal was only outshot twice. It
was a problem that they just could
not fix.
Stanford will lose six seniors to
graduation for its campaign next
year, but its biggest loss will be of its
coach. Johnson, who served her
18th and final year as head coach of
the field hockey team, announced
she would step down effective as of
the end of the season. She will pur
sue a career in private investigation
with her brother.
In the meantime, the Cardinal
will have to endure a long offseason
of what-ifs and nightmares of Fed -
derson scoring a game-winning
goal.

ago in a 2-1 Cal win that gave the Bears
the NorPac regular-season title over the
Cardinal.
As in the teams' last meeting, Califor
nia went up early on a goal by Pooja
Mehta. Stanford junior goalkeeper Emily
Zander came out to challenge Mehta on a
breakaway but couldn't control the ball,
allowing Mehta to put one in on the
empty goal only 5:20 into the first half .
And again, as in their last contest, Stan
ford equalized near the end of the half,

when sophomore Eleanor Morgan fired a
diving shot into the back of the net. Senior
Christina Williams was credited with the
assist.
The second half was goose eggs with
no goals by either team, sending the game
to sudden-death overtime, when Fedder
son struck.
"Nora [Fedderson's] international ex
perience is really apparent in her stick
skills," Morgan said. "[Freshman mid
fielder] Missy [ Halliday] did a really good
job of marking her the entire game and
shutting her down through the game."
1 lowever, in overtime the teams must
drop down to seven-on-seven, as opposed
to the 11 players usually on the field for
each team, allowing play to be opened up
and making it much more difficult to de
fend. I lence, goals can be easier to score
in the overtime period, usually prevent
ing the much-hated penalty shootout.

Freshman forward Lyndsay Erickson charges downfield against California yesterday. The loss,
the team's third to Cal this season, eliminated the team from further postseason play.
I'fddt rson, for the second game
against Stanford, used this to her
advantage in scoring the winning
goal.
California will play Patriot
League champion Lafayette on
Tuesday , with the winner of that
contest advancing to the 16-team
NCAA tournament.
Stanford cruised through the
first two rounds of the NorPac
playolfs to make it to Saturday's
final.
Stanford beat its first oppo
nent, Davidson, 3-1 on Thursday,
which was filled with blowouts, as
the top-seeded teams cleaned up
over lower-seeded and out
matched opponents.

Davidson could only muster as
many shots as Stanford had goals
in the game.
"This was a great win for us,"
departing Stanford head coach
Sheryl Johnson said after the
Davidson game. "We had more
people scoring and contributing
today, and that fit into our game
plan."
In semifinal action against Rad
ford on Friday, Stanford fought
through a late scare, as Radford
took a 2-1 lead on the Cardinal in
the second half. But late second
hall goals by senior defender Amrit
Chima and junior forward Noor
Dawood sealed the 3-2 win for the
Cardinal, sending Stanford to the
final.
"Today's game was a great per
formance by our team," Johnson
said after Friday's win. "We had
some awesome goals."

However, Stanford's pesky
problem of finishing reared its ugly
liead yet again in its loss to Califor
nia, with Stanford outshooting the
Golden Bears by a 15-10 margin.
Out of 21 games this season, the
Cardinal was only outshot twice. It
was a problem that they just could
not fix.
Stanford will lose six seniors to
graduation for its campaign next
year, but its biggest loss will be of its
coach. Johnson, who served her
18th and final year as head coach of
the field hockey team, announced
she would step down effective as of
the end of the season. She will pur
sue a career in private investigation
with her brother.
In the meantime, the Cardinal
will have to endure a long offseason
of what-ifs and nightmares of Fed -
derson scoring a game-winning
goal.
The buzz around campus may be that
the Stanford-California rivalry is fledg
ling, but rest assured the Stanford field
hockey team has plenty of resentment to
ward Cal.

Field Hockey
Friday: Stanford 3, Radford 2
Saturday: California 2, Stanford 1 OT

Actually, the Cardinal's disdain is prob
ably focused solely on Nora Fedderson.
On Saturday, the junior midfielder
scored the game-winning goal against
Stanford, marking the third time this year
that a late Fedderson score has lifted the
Bears to victory over the Cardinal.
Saturday's was the most devastating,
though, as Fedderson's goal 8:44 into
overtime brought the Cardinal's (10-11)
season to an end with a 2-1 loss to Cal (14-

6) in the Northern Pacific Athletic: Con
ference championship game.
"It was very fitting that the champi
onship game came down to California
and Stanford," said Cardinal senior for
ward Amanda Billmyer, who closed out
her Stanford career with 54 points. "I was
really proud of the way our team pulled
together at the end of the season."
Fedderson's score on Saturday was her
second overtime goal against Stanford
this season. Her last one came just a week
ago in a 2-1 Cal win that gave the Bears
the NorPac regular-season title over the
Cardinal.
