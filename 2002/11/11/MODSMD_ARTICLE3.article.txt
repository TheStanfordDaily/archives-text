# Questioning SSE's financial viability; two students take on the organization

Does FLiCKS turn a profit
showing second-run movies?
Does the Stanford Store generate
enough revenue to pay for its
"prime location" in Tresidder?
According to the former edi
tors of The Stanford Daily and
The Stanford Review, the student
body deserves to know the an
swers to these questions, but Stan
ford Student Enterprises, which
runs FLiCKS, the Stanford Store
and several other business opera
tions, considers this information
proprietary and will not release it.
On Tuesday, a case will come
before the ASSU Constitutional
Council, brought by former edi
tor in chief ofThe Review, Henry
Towsner, and former editor in
chief ofThe Daily, Mark Bouch
er. This case is meant to resolve
the issue of what is proprietary
information and who can desig
nate it as such.
The petitioners' case is based on
the stipulation in the ASSU Consti
tution that states, "All records of
any Association entity must be avail
able for scrutiny by the public, with
the exception of proprietary busi
ness information of Association
businesses . . . and personnel
records of employees."
The SSE Board of Directors re
cently announced a policy of releas
ing the consolidated statements
from the audits performed by an
independent auditing firm each
year. CEO David Endelman has ar
gued that the release of this infor
mation goes far enough toward
SSE's public reporting obligation.
"The framers [of the constitu
tion] recognized that the long-term
interests of the ASSU demanded
that SSE be allowed to operate as a
true business, independent of polit
ical involvement," Endelman said
in his filing with the Constitutional
Council."The specific allowance
for proprietary business informa
tion within the freedom of informa
tion clause is a clear statement that
the long-term interests of the .Asso
ciation depend fundamentally on
SSE's ability to compete fairly and
succeed in the marketplace."
Arguments in the case come

from a variety of angles, from the
jurisdiction of the Constitutional
Council to the timeliness of a re
sponse by the previous CEO ofSSE,
but the main argument revolves
around who can determine what is
proprietary business information.
ASSU Senator Connie Chen,
chair of the Administration and
Rules Committee, noted, "Poten
tially there is a conflict between the
Joint Bylaws and the constitution,
and it depends on how you inter
pret freedom of information."
The rules committee is examin
ing the question of whether the
constitution implies that as much
information as possible should be
released or only that which is di
rectly required to be released.
After the new Board of Direc
tors policy to release consolidated
audits was announced at the Un
dergraduate Senate meeting last
Tuesday, Chen said, "I think that
a lot [of information] has been re
leased. The case doesn't necessar
ily need to go to the Constitution
al Council. Still, if Henry [Tows
ner] wants to institutionalize this
so that [he sets a precedent] for fu
ture years, 1 think that's great."
The case began last April when
The Review, unsuccessful in ob
taining SSE financial records, de
cided to join with The Daily and
file a formal request asking for fi
nancial statements and personnel
compensation for the SSE and
each of its subsidiaries.
The initial request was re
fused. Ross Davisson, SSE CEO at
the time, stated simply, "I am not
going to be able to release the bal
ance sheet, statement of cash
flows, or income statement for
SSE at this time."
This fall, the former editors
continued their case by filing a
formal petition with the Constitu
tional Council. The petition was
signed by five undergraduate sen
ators, in a process that senator
