# Questioning SSE's financial viability; two students take on the organization
## Opening the books

Does FLiCKS turn a profit
showing second-run movies?
Does the Stanford Store generate
enough revenue to pay for its
"prime location" in Tresidder?
According to the former edi
tors of The Stanford Daily and
The Stanford Review, the student
body deserves to know the an
swers to these questions, but Stan
ford Student Enterprises, which
runs FLiCKS, the Stanford Store
and several other business opera
tions, considers this information
proprietary and will not release it.
On Tuesday, a case will come
before the ASSU Constitutional
Council, brought by former edi
tor in chief ofThe Review, Henry
Towsner, and former editor in
chief ofThe Daily, Mark Bouch
er. This case is meant to resolve
the issue of what is proprietary
information and who can desig
nate it as such.
The petitioners' case is based on
the stipulation in the ASSU Consti
tution that states, "All records of
any Association entity must be avail
able for scrutiny by the public, with
the exception of proprietary busi
ness information of Association
businesses . . . and personnel
records of employees."
The SSE Board of Directors re
cently announced a policy of releas
ing the consolidated statements
from the audits performed by an
independent auditing firm each
year. CEO David Endelman has ar
gued that the release of this infor
mation goes far enough toward
SSE's public reporting obligation.
"The framers [of the constitu
tion] recognized that the long-term
interests of the ASSU demanded
that SSE be allowed to operate as a
true business, independent of polit
ical involvement," Endelman said
in his filing with the Constitutional
Council."The specific allowance
for proprietary business informa
tion within the freedom of informa
tion clause is a clear statement that
the long-term interests of the .Asso
ciation depend fundamentally on
SSE's ability to compete fairly and
succeed in the marketplace."
Arguments in the case come

from a variety of angles, from the
jurisdiction of the Constitutional
Council to the timeliness of a re
sponse by the previous CEO ofSSE,
but the main argument revolves
around who can determine what is
proprietary business information.
ASSU Senator Connie Chen,
chair of the Administration and
Rules Committee, noted, "Poten
tially there is a conflict between the
Joint Bylaws and the constitution,
and it depends on how you inter
pret freedom of information."
The rules committee is examin
ing the question of whether the
constitution implies that as much
information as possible should be
released or only that which is di
rectly required to be released.
After the new Board of Direc
tors policy to release consolidated
audits was announced at the Un
dergraduate Senate meeting last
Tuesday, Chen said, "I think that
a lot [of information] has been re
leased. The case doesn't necessar
ily need to go to the Constitution
al Council. Still, if Henry [Tows
ner] wants to institutionalize this
so that [he sets a precedent] for fu
ture years, 1 think that's great."
The case began last April when
The Review, unsuccessful in ob
taining SSE financial records, de
cided to join with The Daily and
file a formal request asking for fi
nancial statements and personnel
compensation for the SSE and
each of its subsidiaries.
The initial request was re
fused. Ross Davisson, SSE CEO at
the time, stated simply, "I am not
going to be able to release the bal
ance sheet, statement of cash
flows, or income statement for
SSE at this time."
This fall, the former editors
continued their case by filing a
formal petition with the Constitu
tional Council. The petition was
signed by five undergraduate sen
ators, in a process that senator

Hiro Iwanaga characterized as
"really messy." In order for the
case to go to Constitutional Coun
cil, at least five senators had to
deem the case not to be frivolous.
"There were a lot of argu
ments for and against it," Iwana
ga said. "These showed that this
case is not frivolous. It's not our
job to judge whether the case is
constitutional or not."
However, Bo Cowgill, senate
chair, said he was skeptical about
the request at first.
"I thought the case could be
frivolous, and I wanted better in
formation [before I signed the
petition]," he said.
The Constitutional Council,

with its four members recently cho
sen and confirmed, will hear the
case on Tuesday at 5 p.m.
According to chair Bill Curry,
this meeting should be the only one
necessary, and the council will re
lease its ruling soon after.
The key question that the Con
stitutional Council will be grap
pling with is whether the Under
graduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council, through the Joint
Bylaws and Association Financial
Policies, can designate the power to
decide what is proprietary to the
SSH Board of Directors.
Cowgill, defending the actions
of the Senate, said, "It's fine with
me if the Board of Directors de
cides. It's not as though anyone on
the Board of Directors would get
paid. They have more information
about the SSE, and there's always a
senator on the Board."

Towsner argues, however, that
information must be proprietary
for the Board of Directors to
shield it, and that the Board of Di
rectors cannot make arbitrary des
ignations of what is proprietary.
"Such documents must actual
ly be proprietary, in the English
meaning of the term, since other
wise the document could not be
shielded from the public without
violating the Constitution,"
Towsner said.
The Constitutional Council
may be wading into financial de
cision-making in trying to deter
mine what information is propri
etary information.
According to Prof. Madhav
Rajan, an accounting expert at
the Graduate School of Business,
"Anything that, if you release it,
would hurt the company by, for
example, making future earnings

or stock prices go down, is pro
prietary." But, he continued, "It's
really up to [the company] to de
fine proprietary. Each company
will define its own segment [for
disclosure purposes]. There is no
hard and fast rule saying you
have to disclose these segments."
Towsner and Boucher don't
think that the performance of indi
vidual SSE entities is proprietary.
"We don't think it's credible that
SSE would be hurt by giving us this
information," Towsner said.
Endelman was joined by six
former SSE CEOs in filing a letter
with the Constitutional Council
defending the Board's designa
tions of proprietary.
"In every area of our busi
ness," the CEOs noted, "SSE
competes with many groups in a
very crowded Stanford market
place. For example, The Stanford

Daily and other publications
compete directly with ASSU enti
ties like the Stanford Directory
and Ad Agency."
"To make information like
sales levels, cost of goods, salaries
and profits of each enterprise
public would provide an unfair
and potentially damaging
amount of competitive informa
tion to the SSE's competitors,"
the CEOs continued.
"Protection of our business in
formation is a protection of the
student body and the representa
tion of its voice through the
ASSU," they concluded.
Towsner and Boucher reject
ed a proposed settlement last
Tuesday that would have re
leased consolidated financial
statements for the ASSU, includ
ing the SSE.
"We think it's important to get

information about individual
business units," Towsner said.
Endelman argues that, as he is
not a student and, therefore, not a
member of the ASSU, the Consti
tutional Council has no authority
over him, an argument that Tows
ner calls "a little frightening."
Endelman also argues that the
council cannot authorize the release
of information without changing
the Joint Bylaws, which delegate
power to the Board of Directors.
"Whenever any piece of infor
mation is decided, even if [the con
stitution] did say the Senate should
decide, the Senate can delegate
this power," Cowgill said.
Endelman declined to com
ment on his prospects in the case.
Towsner said, "112 think our ar
guments are pretty sound. We'll
probably get all if not most of the
information we're requesting."
