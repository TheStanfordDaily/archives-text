# Sand Hill Rd. up for final vote
## 
### ILENA C. GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After months of debate and weeks of
study by Menlo Park staffers, the latest
chapter in the Sand Hill Road expan
sion saga may come to a close at 7:30
p.m. tomorrow night at the Menlo Park
City Council meeting. The council will
vote tomorrow on a final agreement
with the University about whether it
will allow Stanford to expand the road
from two to four lanes of traffic
through the city.
In August, Menlo Park and Stanford
negotiated an agreement allowing the
University to widen the road. The city
tentatively approved the agreement in
late September, with a final vote pending
a report from the city attorney address
ing council and residents' concerns
about environmental and legal issues.
The report was published on the
city's Web site last Wednesday and in

eluded a revised proposal that will be
voted on tomorrow.
"The conversations between Menlo
Park, Palo Alto and Santa Clara County
have led me to believe there are no sig
nificant obstacles remaining to a vote 011
this issue; that Menlo Park's concerns, at
least from an official city attorney's point

of view, seem to have been answered,"
Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt said.
"[The new proposal] includes the
trail, financial safeguards for the city of
Menlo Park, and it includes adjust
ments to the design primarily to the in-

tersection of Sand Hill Road and
Santa Cruz Avenue."
Currently, Sand Hill Road
narrows from four to two lanes
over San Francisquito Creek, im
pacting two major intersections
in Menlo Park: the intersection of
Santa Cruz Avenue and Sand Hill
Road, and the intersection ofju
nipero Serra Boulevard and
Alpine Road. Congestion is a
major concern, as is emergency
access to the Stanford Hospital.
Despite the benefits, there
have been a variety of concerns
voiced regarding the expansion.
One of the central issues in the
controversy is Stanford's plan to
include a 16-foot-wide hiking
trail along the south side of Sand
Hill Road.
Residents have expressed con
cern about its possible environ
mental impacts, arguing that con
struction could be detrimental to
wildlife and have a negative im
pact on what could be an archaeo
logically significant area.
Some also speculate that Stan
ford is attempting to use the trail to
fulfill Santa Clara County's Gener
al Use Permit's requirements.
"There are people pushing for
[having the trail] on the other
side of the creek — in Santa

Clara county," said Bill McClure,
Menlo Park's city attorney. "Peo
ple are concerned that if Menlo
Park approves the portion of the
trail adjacent to Menlo Park, that
will somehow express a prefer
ence for that location [to fulfill
Santa Clara County's trail re
quirements] and give Stanford a
better argument."
Discussions between the City
Council, the Planning Staff at
Santa Clara County, the San
Mateo County Council's Office
and the Palo Alto City Attorney
decided that it was in Menlo
Park's hands to decide how the
trail's impact will be evaluated.
The City Attorney's report in
dicated that an additional Envi
ronmental Impact Report —
which would take 18 months to
compile — would not be neces
sary if the council decides the
trail is separate from the trail re
quired by Santa Clara County.
But one Menlo Park City
Council member said that she be
lieves that a new Environmental
Impact Report may be necessary.
"What was originally studied
and approved in the original EIR
and development agreement is
different from what's on the table
now," Menlo Park City Council
woman Mary Jo Borak said. "And
it's unclear whether it's different
enough to warrant additional
study. And of course Stanford
says no, no, no; it's fine."

Borak said that Stanford has,
in effect, issued the city an ulti
matum by offering to pay for the
project only if the 16-foot wide
trail is included.
"Stanford has kind of said it's
all or nothing," she said. "I sus
pect the city may approve some
thing that is slightly different
than Stanford's dream package."
Other issues of concern to
Menlo Park included who would
pay for the project and who would
prepare the design package.
"The latest proposal has Stan
ford running the job and Stan
ford being responsible for all pro
ject costs," Schmidt said.
"Menlo Park residents and
taxpayers are protected from cost
overruns in the project."
The addendum to the original
Environmental Impact Report,
prepared by Menlo Park staff,
concluded that the project, in
cluding the trail, does not create
any new hazards or exacerbate
existing problems that had been
identified in the previous Envi
ronmental Impact Report.
The University has a positive
outlook on the upcoming decision.
Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry
Horton said, "I think we are set
on Tuesday night for approval
on the Sand Hill Road projects.
These are long overdue, and I
think it will be quite a benefit to
the area."

In August, Menlo Park and Stanford
negotiated an agreement allowing the
University to widen the road. The city
tentatively approved the agreement in
late September, with a final vote pending
a report from the city attorney address
ing council and residents' concerns
about environmental and legal issues.
The report was published on the
city's Web site last Wednesday and in

eluded a revised proposal that will be
voted on tomorrow.
"The conversations between Menlo
Park, Palo Alto and Santa Clara County
have led me to believe there are no sig
nificant obstacles remaining to a vote 011
this issue; that Menlo Park's concerns, at
least from an official city attorney's point

of view, seem to have been answered,"
Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt said.
"[The new proposal] includes the
trail, financial safeguards for the city of
Menlo Park, and it includes adjust
ments to the design primarily to the in-

tersection of Sand Hill Road and
Santa Cruz Avenue."
Currently, Sand Hill Road
narrows from four to two lanes
over San Francisquito Creek, im
pacting two major intersections
in Menlo Park: the intersection of
Santa Cruz Avenue and Sand Hill
Road, and the intersection ofju
nipero Serra Boulevard and
Alpine Road. Congestion is a
major concern, as is emergency
access to the Stanford Hospital.
Despite the benefits, there
have been a variety of concerns
voiced regarding the expansion.
One of the central issues in the
controversy is Stanford's plan to
include a 16-foot-wide hiking
trail along the south side of Sand
Hill Road.
Residents have expressed con
cern about its possible environ
mental impacts, arguing that con
struction could be detrimental to
wildlife and have a negative im
pact on what could be an archaeo
logically significant area.
Some also speculate that Stan
ford is attempting to use the trail to
fulfill Santa Clara County's Gener
al Use Permit's requirements.
"There are people pushing for
[having the trail] on the other
side of the creek — in Santa

Clara county," said Bill McClure,
Menlo Park's city attorney. "Peo
ple are concerned that if Menlo
Park approves the portion of the
trail adjacent to Menlo Park, that
will somehow express a prefer
ence for that location [to fulfill
Santa Clara County's trail re
quirements] and give Stanford a
better argument."
Discussions between the City
Council, the Planning Staff at
Santa Clara County, the San
Mateo County Council's Office
and the Palo Alto City Attorney
decided that it was in Menlo
Park's hands to decide how the
trail's impact will be evaluated.
The City Attorney's report in
dicated that an additional Envi
ronmental Impact Report —
which would take 18 months to
compile — would not be neces
sary if the council decides the
trail is separate from the trail re
quired by Santa Clara County.
But one Menlo Park City
Council member said that she be
lieves that a new Environmental
Impact Report may be necessary.
"What was originally studied
and approved in the original EIR
and development agreement is
different from what's on the table
now," Menlo Park City Council
woman Mary Jo Borak said. "And
it's unclear whether it's different
enough to warrant additional
study. And of course Stanford
says no, no, no; it's fine."

Borak said that Stanford has,
in effect, issued the city an ulti
matum by offering to pay for the
project only if the 16-foot wide
trail is included.
"Stanford has kind of said it's
all or nothing," she said. "I sus
pect the city may approve some
thing that is slightly different
than Stanford's dream package."
Other issues of concern to
Menlo Park included who would
pay for the project and who would
prepare the design package.
"The latest proposal has Stan
ford running the job and Stan
ford being responsible for all pro
ject costs," Schmidt said.
"Menlo Park residents and
taxpayers are protected from cost
overruns in the project."
The addendum to the original
Environmental Impact Report,
prepared by Menlo Park staff,
concluded that the project, in
cluding the trail, does not create
any new hazards or exacerbate
existing problems that had been
identified in the previous Envi
ronmental Impact Report.
The University has a positive
outlook on the upcoming decision.
Director of Government and
Community Relations Larry
Horton said, "I think we are set
on Tuesday night for approval
on the Sand Hill Road projects.
These are long overdue, and I
think it will be quite a benefit to
the area."
After months of debate and weeks of
study by Menlo Park staffers, the latest
chapter in the Sand Hill Road expan
sion saga may come to a close at 7:30
p.m. tomorrow night at the Menlo Park
City Council meeting. The council will
vote tomorrow on a final agreement
with the University about whether it
will allow Stanford to expand the road
from two to four lanes of traffic
through the city.
