# Muslim activist discusses liberties
## Salam Al-Marayati speaks about civil liberties, potential war in Iraq 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
This Saturday morning, Salam Al-Marayati,
one of the most prominent Muslim activists in
the United States, came to Stanford to speak at
"Shaking the Foundations," the Law School's
fourth annual West Coast conference on pro
gressive lawyering. At the event, Al-Marayati,
the executive director of the Los Angeles
based Muslim Public Affairs Council, spoke
about the negative impact that the aftermath of
Sept. 11 has had on the civil liberties of the
Muslim, Arab and South Asian communities in
the United States.
After his talk, Al-Marayati sat down with The
Daily to give an American Muslim activist's per
spective on many issues currently being debat
ed on American college campuses, including
the USA Patriot Act, the image of the United
States in the Muslim world, the potential war in
Iraq and college campaigns to divest in Israel.
Patriot Act disregards
'presumption of innocence'
In his lecture and afterward, Al-Marayati
stressed the harmful effects the USA Patriot Act,
which was passed by Congress soon after the
Sept. 11 attacks, has had on the civil liberties of
all American residents, especially Muslims.
"When we talk about Muslim charities [in
the United States] being shut dpwn and 14
Muslim offices and homes being raided on
March 14, it's because of the Patriot Act," he
said. "We need to . . . talk about the constitu
tionality of the law that is being used really to
chisel away at the whole notion of the pre
sumption of innocence, which is an American
value and a constitutional guarantee, but that
does not exist anymore. Therefore, we need an

American Muslim voice that speaks about the
security of our country . . . while maintaining
the very essence of America, which is its foun
dation for civil liberties."
Al-Marayati's sentiments echoed the views of
many Stanford professors at the Faculty Senate
meeting last Thursday, when Profs. Mark
Mungal and Ann Arvin and others criticized
the act because of its negative implications on
medical research and international students'
affairs. Al-Marayati suggested that if the Facul
ty Senate and University as a whole feel this act
will hurt Stanford, the University administra
tion should take legal action.
"Anything that's going to be affecting a Uni

versity should be brought up in a legal setting,
and there should be a complaint filed with the
U.S. government on that," he said.
Improving America's image
in the Muslim world
In a meeting with President George W.
Bush two months ago, Al-Marayati and other
American Muslim leaders stressed that the
United States government could strengthen its
image in the Muslim world by building
stronger relationships with Muslims in the
United States.
