# Muslim activist discusses liberties
## Salam Al-Marayati speaks about civil liberties, potential war in Iraq 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
This Saturday morning, Salam Al-Marayati,
one of the most prominent Muslim activists in
the United States, came to Stanford to speak at
"Shaking the Foundations," the Law School's
fourth annual West Coast conference on pro
gressive lawyering. At the event, Al-Marayati,
the executive director of the Los Angeles
based Muslim Public Affairs Council, spoke
about the negative impact that the aftermath of
Sept. 11 has had on the civil liberties of the
Muslim, Arab and South Asian communities in
the United States.
After his talk, Al-Marayati sat down with The
Daily to give an American Muslim activist's per
spective on many issues currently being debat
ed on American college campuses, including
the USA Patriot Act, the image of the United
States in the Muslim world, the potential war in
Iraq and college campaigns to divest in Israel.
Patriot Act disregards
'presumption of innocence'
In his lecture and afterward, Al-Marayati
stressed the harmful effects the USA Patriot Act,
which was passed by Congress soon after the
Sept. 11 attacks, has had on the civil liberties of
all American residents, especially Muslims.
"When we talk about Muslim charities [in
the United States] being shut dpwn and 14
Muslim offices and homes being raided on
March 14, it's because of the Patriot Act," he
said. "We need to . . . talk about the constitu
tionality of the law that is being used really to
chisel away at the whole notion of the pre
sumption of innocence, which is an American
value and a constitutional guarantee, but that
does not exist anymore. Therefore, we need an

American Muslim voice that speaks about the
security of our country . . . while maintaining
the very essence of America, which is its foun
dation for civil liberties."
Al-Marayati's sentiments echoed the views of
many Stanford professors at the Faculty Senate
meeting last Thursday, when Profs. Mark
Mungal and Ann Arvin and others criticized
the act because of its negative implications on
medical research and international students'
affairs. Al-Marayati suggested that if the Facul
ty Senate and University as a whole feel this act
will hurt Stanford, the University administra
tion should take legal action.
"Anything that's going to be affecting a Uni

versity should be brought up in a legal setting,
and there should be a complaint filed with the
U.S. government on that," he said.
Improving America's image
in the Muslim world
In a meeting with President George W.
Bush two months ago, Al-Marayati and other
American Muslim leaders stressed that the
United States government could strengthen its
image in the Muslim world by building
stronger relationships with Muslims in the
United States.

Famed American Muslim activist Salam Al-Marayati talks about laws enacted after Sept. 11 that endan
ger civil liberties. Al-Marayati spoke as part of the Law School's "Shaking the Foundations" conference.
"Whether it's President Bush or
President Clinton, the main prob
lem for [American Muslims] is
there has always been an exclusion
of American Muslims from the pol
icymaking apparatus," he said.
"And . . . if [the U.S.J is trying to
win the hearts and minds of Mus
lims [worldwide], then who better
to serve that critical role than
American Muslims."
Al-Marayati believes that if Pres
ident Bush wants to gain credibili
ty in the Muslim world, Bush
should also distance himself more
from members of the Christian
right who have made anti-Muslim
comments in the recent past.
"... 1 think a concern is that
Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson
and Franklin Graham — those
fundamentalists — are the ones in
fluencing policy [in the United
States], because the image of the
Muslim world is that these people
are actually making the policy, not
the president himself," lie said. "I
think the president has to make
some separation between the hate

ful rhetoric of [people] like that
and what his administration stands
for, if we want to improve Ameri
ca's image [in the Muslim world]."
Informing the
community on Iraq
Regarding the potential war in
Iraq, the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, Al-Marayati's organiza
tion, submitted a statement to the
National Security Council advocat
ing fora removal of Saddam Hus
sein's totalitarian regime, but with
out military intervention.
"MPAC feels that the Iraqi
people — who have been suffer
ing under dictatorship and sanc
tions — do not need to be sub
jected to further suffering in the
trial to remove dictatorship by
foreign intervention," the state
ment reads. "We call on our lead
ership to find a less harmful way
to support democracy in Iraq . . .
. We call on our government to
offer humanitarian aid that will
empower the Iraqi people rather
than subject them to military
strikes that may lead to the en
trenchment of the dictator, or
the replacement of one dictator
with another."
According to Al-Marayati,

college campuses like Stanford
can play an important role in
enlightening the community
about Iraq.
"I think the value of campuses
are the teach-ins to inform and
educate people about these areas
and these regions," said Al-
Marayati, whose family immi
grated to the United States from
Iraq when he was four years old.
"I've seen a lot more opposition
to this war on Iraq than I've seen
before in the previous Persian
Gulf War. I think more questions
have to be asked to our govern
ment about what the goals are,
and how we plan to do it, and
how its going to affect America's
interests."
Divestment campaigns highlight
Israel's 'apartheid policies'
Al-Marayati believes that cam
paigns across American colleges
to divest in Israel are an impor
tant way to educate Americans
about Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians.
"[lsrael's] apartheid policies
have one group of laws for the
Palestinians and another group of
laws for Israelis," he said. "Water is
being taken out of Palestinian ter

ritories, 90 percent of which then
goes to Israelis, for example.
Until those apartheid policies
end, the world should pressure
Israel to reform its treatment of
the Palestinians. It's a human
rights issue.
"On top of that. . . the brutali
ty against the Palestinians is being
done with our American dollars.
So it's my tax dollars that are
going to oppress a whole people,
and I think Americans, therefore,
have a double duty in terms of
speaking to those issues."
Al-Marayati also stated that di
vestment campaigns are not anti-
Semitic.
"Just like we say the war on ter
rorism is not a war on Islam, di
vestment in Israel is not anti-Jew
ish." he said. "It's to deal with a
government that is violating the
human rights of another people,
and it doesn't matter what reli
gion they belong to. Just like we
have sanctions on Sudan for its
treatment of Christians in the
Sudan, and we sanction other
countries for violations, the Is
raeli government should not be
above the law. It should be held
to the same law as every other
government."

Famed American Muslim activist Salam Al-Marayati talks about laws enacted after Sept. 11 that endan
ger civil liberties. Al-Marayati spoke as part of the Law School's "Shaking the Foundations" conference.
"Whether it's President Bush or
President Clinton, the main prob
lem for [American Muslims] is
there has always been an exclusion
of American Muslims from the pol
icymaking apparatus," he said.
"And . . . if [the U.S.J is trying to
win the hearts and minds of Mus
lims [worldwide], then who better
to serve that critical role than
American Muslims."
Al-Marayati believes that if Pres
ident Bush wants to gain credibili
ty in the Muslim world, Bush
should also distance himself more
from members of the Christian
right who have made anti-Muslim
comments in the recent past.
"... 1 think a concern is that
Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson
and Franklin Graham — those
fundamentalists — are the ones in
fluencing policy [in the United
States], because the image of the
Muslim world is that these people
are actually making the policy, not
the president himself," lie said. "I
think the president has to make
some separation between the hate

ful rhetoric of [people] like that
and what his administration stands
for, if we want to improve Ameri
ca's image [in the Muslim world]."
Informing the
community on Iraq
Regarding the potential war in
Iraq, the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, Al-Marayati's organiza
tion, submitted a statement to the
National Security Council advocat
ing fora removal of Saddam Hus
sein's totalitarian regime, but with
out military intervention.
"MPAC feels that the Iraqi
people — who have been suffer
ing under dictatorship and sanc
tions — do not need to be sub
jected to further suffering in the
trial to remove dictatorship by
foreign intervention," the state
ment reads. "We call on our lead
ership to find a less harmful way
to support democracy in Iraq . . .
. We call on our government to
offer humanitarian aid that will
empower the Iraqi people rather
than subject them to military
strikes that may lead to the en
trenchment of the dictator, or
the replacement of one dictator
with another."
According to Al-Marayati,

college campuses like Stanford
can play an important role in
enlightening the community
about Iraq.
"I think the value of campuses
are the teach-ins to inform and
educate people about these areas
and these regions," said Al-
Marayati, whose family immi
grated to the United States from
Iraq when he was four years old.
"I've seen a lot more opposition
to this war on Iraq than I've seen
before in the previous Persian
Gulf War. I think more questions
have to be asked to our govern
ment about what the goals are,
and how we plan to do it, and
how its going to affect America's
interests."
Divestment campaigns highlight
Israel's 'apartheid policies'
Al-Marayati believes that cam
paigns across American colleges
to divest in Israel are an impor
tant way to educate Americans
about Israel's treatment of the
Palestinians.
"[lsrael's] apartheid policies
have one group of laws for the
Palestinians and another group of
laws for Israelis," he said. "Water is
being taken out of Palestinian ter

ritories, 90 percent of which then
goes to Israelis, for example.
Until those apartheid policies
end, the world should pressure
Israel to reform its treatment of
the Palestinians. It's a human
rights issue.
"On top of that. . . the brutali
ty against the Palestinians is being
done with our American dollars.
So it's my tax dollars that are
going to oppress a whole people,
and I think Americans, therefore,
have a double duty in terms of
speaking to those issues."
Al-Marayati also stated that di
vestment campaigns are not anti-
Semitic.
"Just like we say the war on ter
rorism is not a war on Islam, di
vestment in Israel is not anti-Jew
ish." he said. "It's to deal with a
government that is violating the
human rights of another people,
and it doesn't matter what reli
gion they belong to. Just like we
have sanctions on Sudan for its
treatment of Christians in the
Sudan, and we sanction other
countries for violations, the Is
raeli government should not be
above the law. It should be held
to the same law as every other
government."
This Saturday morning, Salam Al-Marayati,
one of the most prominent Muslim activists in
the United States, came to Stanford to speak at
"Shaking the Foundations," the Law School's
fourth annual West Coast conference on pro
gressive lawyering. At the event, Al-Marayati,
the executive director of the Los Angeles
based Muslim Public Affairs Council, spoke
about the negative impact that the aftermath of
Sept. 11 has had on the civil liberties of the
Muslim, Arab and South Asian communities in
the United States.
After his talk, Al-Marayati sat down with The
Daily to give an American Muslim activist's per
spective on many issues currently being debat
ed on American college campuses, including
the USA Patriot Act, the image of the United
States in the Muslim world, the potential war in
Iraq and college campaigns to divest in Israel.
Patriot Act disregards
'presumption of innocence'
In his lecture and afterward, Al-Marayati
stressed the harmful effects the USA Patriot Act,
which was passed by Congress soon after the
Sept. 11 attacks, has had on the civil liberties of
all American residents, especially Muslims.
"When we talk about Muslim charities [in
the United States] being shut dpwn and 14
Muslim offices and homes being raided on
March 14, it's because of the Patriot Act," he
said. "We need to . . . talk about the constitu
tionality of the law that is being used really to
chisel away at the whole notion of the pre
sumption of innocence, which is an American
value and a constitutional guarantee, but that
does not exist anymore. Therefore, we need an

American Muslim voice that speaks about the
security of our country . . . while maintaining
the very essence of America, which is its foun
dation for civil liberties."
Al-Marayati's sentiments echoed the views of
many Stanford professors at the Faculty Senate
meeting last Thursday, when Profs. Mark
Mungal and Ann Arvin and others criticized
the act because of its negative implications on
medical research and international students'
affairs. Al-Marayati suggested that if the Facul
ty Senate and University as a whole feel this act
will hurt Stanford, the University administra
tion should take legal action.
"Anything that's going to be affecting a Uni

versity should be brought up in a legal setting,
and there should be a complaint filed with the
U.S. government on that," he said.
Improving America's image
in the Muslim world
In a meeting with President George W.
Bush two months ago, Al-Marayati and other
American Muslim leaders stressed that the
United States government could strengthen its
image in the Muslim world by building
stronger relationships with Muslims in the
United States.
