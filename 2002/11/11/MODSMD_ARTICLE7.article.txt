# Hospital workers to strike on Wednesday
## Workers reject hospital management's 'final offer' by 76 percent vote 
### ERIC ELDON STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday, union workers at
the Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital voted
to reject the hospitals' final pro
posal fora new contract.
Negotiations between workers

and the hospitals ended last Mon
day, when the previous contract
expired.
The proposal was sent out to
workers by mail last week. An
SEIU Local 715 press release
stated that, on Friday, "76 per
cent of the votes today were to re
ject the final offer."
Workers gave notice to the hos
pitals'management on Nov. 1 that
they will hold a one-day strike this
coining Wednesday if "executives
do not agree to stop bargaining in
bad faith by refusing to seriously

consider worker proposals," ac
cording to the press release.
Unions are required by law to no
tify employers 10 days before a
proposed strike.
Union members' rejection of
the hospitals' offer leaves little
doubt that there will be a strike.
"With today's resounding vote
against management's final offer,
a strike appears imminent," the
press release said.
However, as of late yesterday
evening, a hospital spokesperson
said that the hospitals had not yet

received notification of the re
sults of the vote.
"The union has not notified us
of the results of the contract vote,"
said Maria La Ganga, spokesper
son for the hospitals. "However,
we would be disappointed to hear
that our valued SFIU-represented
employees rejected our generous
proposal of a2l percent average
pay raise over three years and the
creation of a joint labor-manage
ment committee to give workers a
greater voice in staffing and pa
tient care issues."
"Our number one priority is to
provide the highest quality of care
at the Stanford Hospital and clin
ics and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital," La Ganga said. "Our
hospitals are rated among the best
in the nation for the care we pro
vide to our patients."
Both sides said that they would
be willing to go back to the negoti
ating table, if necessary.
Some students are planning ac
tions to support the hospital work
ers during the proposed strike.
"We are having a rally at noon
in the Oval on Wednesday and a
march to the picket line to sup
port the hospital workers be
cause they're making a huge sac
rifice to improve patient care at
the Stanford hospitals," said
Leticia Ramirez, co-coordinator
of the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition.
"Stanford students will be on
the picket line with the workers.
We feel that [University] Presi
dent [John] Hennessy should

also be there to show his commit
ment to workers' rights and qual
ity patient care for our communi
ty," she added.
I he union's press release stat
ed that in the negotiations, work
ers proposed steps that they say
"would allow workers to have a
meaningful voice in setting safe
staffing levels and enable Stan
ford to attract and retain experi
enced caregivers."
Workers claim that the Stan
ford hospitals do not offer workers
pay and workplace incentives on
par with the majority of hospitals
in the Bay Area, and that the new
contract does not meet these in
centives, which they see as essen
tial to quality patient care.
Key worker demands include
a higher pay raise than currently
offered by the hospitals; a step
system that would take fewer
years to attain seniority com
pared to the one currently pro
posed; job guarantees that would
prevent the outsourcing of union
jobs to subcontracting compa
nies; and a joint labor-manage
ment committee to oversee
staffing and patient care deci
sions that would answer to an
outside arbitrator, rather than
hospital management.
