### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University President John Hennessy,
13 Nobel Prize winners and many other
world leaders have joined in signing the
"Human Manifesto," a declaration that
the world must take responsibility for
human rights, the environment and
global peace.
"We have the obligation to free our
world of war by creating an enduring basis
for world peace," the document says in
one of 17 short statements committing hu
manity to building a better world.
"As with anything idealistic, it re
minds us that these things — global
human rights, the environment,
peace — are things we need to care
about," said Hennessy, who endorsed
the document as an individual and not
on behalf of the University.
"I don't sign petitions normally, be
cause normally I'm being asked to sign
on behalf of the University, and I'm wary
of making political statements,"' he said.
"But this case is different.

"Most of what it says is hard to disagree
with; most people would agree that these
are good goals."
The manifesto begins with (lie simple
statement: "Human life on our planet is
in jeopardy."
It goes on to list many threats to hu
manity: war, the denial of human rights,
environmental degradation and popula
tion increase. The manifesto does not call
for specific action but merely states, "We
declare our individual citizenship to the
world community and our support fora
United Nations capable of governing our
planet in the common human interest."
It finishes with obligations to make
peace, human rights and the environ
ment top priorities.
"Life in the universe is unimaginably
rare. It must be protected, respected and
cherished," the manifesto states.
The manifesto was first published in
1972 in a full page add in the New York
Times inspired by then-U.N. Secretary
General U Than).
"The message is more impor
tant today than then," said Dou
glas Mattern, president of the As
sociation of World Citizens, the
San Francisco-based group orga
nizing the manifesto.
"The goal is the message that
our first obligation is to humani
ty, not national interest," Mat

tern added.
The association will send the
manifesto out to world leaders
and different branches of the
United Nations, and it is raising
money to place the document in
ads in newspapers around the
country with the goal of drawing
attention to its quest for world
peace and justice.
"It's good to remember that
these are good goals even if in our
everyday lives we may not think
about them," Hennessy said.
