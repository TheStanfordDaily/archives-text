# Hospital, industry join to help poor

### CAMILLE RICKETTS 
Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, Airline Ambassadors
International and Applied Mate
rials, Inc., have formed an al
liance to send medical relief and
other supplies to disadvantaged
children in Argentina. During
the last weekend of October, a
team of volunteers left for Ar
gentina, where representatives
from AAI personally delivered
supplies to various children's
medical facilities, including San
Isidro Infant Hospital.
The donation consisted of 250
hygiene kits, 150 school kits, 50
newborn kits, 500 toys, wheel
chairs, 400 pairs of socks and 100
pairs of shoes. In addition, the
team distributed $100,000 worth
of medicine and $750 worth of
food to the San Isidro hospital
and three other Argentine hospi
tals. The Children's Hospital
contributed the vast majority of
these supplies, which are predict
ed to last up to a year.
The project began when Ap

plied Materials executives Mike
()'Kartell and Julio Aranovitch
became aware of the poor condi
tions of San Isidro Infant Hospi
tal, a facility known for its large
oncology unit.
"Applied Materials is not in
the health industry, so our ability
to provide the necessary medi
cines, etc., was limited — so we
immediately thought of Lucile
Packard, with whom we have
worked on other community
projects," said O'Farrell, vice
president of global community
affairs at Applied Materials.
Alter organizing their substan
tial donation, Packard and Ap
plied Materials contacted AAI,
which agreed to hand-deliver the
supplies. AAI was already aware
of Argentina's recent social and
political discord.
"Since the economic collapse in
January, we have known that
there were many children in des
perate need," said Nancy Rivard,
founder and president of AAI, an
organization that has delivered
over $10 million worth of supplies
to children around the world.
"We respond to as many calls
for help as we possibly can . . . giv
ing a chance for ordinary people to
hand-deliver aid and love to chil
dren in need," she said.
Volunteers for the Argentine
operation had to apply and be ac
cepted by AAl's mission coordi
nator, Rachel Martinez. The
team that recently came back
from Argentina was composed of
16 people, including four televi
sion crew members from NBC's
Today Show and Dr. Richard
Low, president of Medications
Without Borders.

"We are grateful to the support
of Dr. Richard Low and Medica
tions without Borders for their as
sistance in retrieving the aid we
brought from the airport in a time
ly manner," Rivard said. "The
Today Show team was a great addi
tion, and their TV piece is planned
for airing in late November."
The team traveled through
the nation fora week, distribut
ing supplies to the San Isidro
hospital as well as other facilities
including CLSA, Casa de Ninos
and Todos Unos Sonrisa.
Departing from their scheduled
agenda, the team also brought 75
hygiene kits to the non profit
Warmi in Abra Pampa, an organi
zation working with indigenous
peoples in northern Argentina.
This project is not the first
time the Children's Hospital has
teamed up with AAI. They first

worked together to bring medical
supplies to Bolivia in 1996. The
Children's Hospital itself has
long been committed to bringing
aid to children in poverty-strick
en nations.
"All of our disciples, from doc
tors to nurses to pharmacists to
educators, have a passion for
helping children in need," said
Christopher Dawes, CEO of the
Children's Hospital.
All three organizations involved
appear to be satisfied with the pro
ject's immediate results. Accord
ingly, A\l has already decided to
visit other Argentine regions to de
termine possible needs for its fu
ture missions to the area.
"It was a very successful mis
sion, and AAI has determined to
return at least every two months
to deliver aid to the projects we
identified," Rivard said.

ing supplies to the San Isidro
hospital as well as other facilities
including CLSA, Casa de Ninos
and Todos Unos Sonrisa.
Departing from their scheduled
agenda, the team also brought 75
hygiene kits to the non profit
Warmi in Abra Pampa, an organi
zation working with indigenous
peoples in northern Argentina.
This project is not the first
time the Children's Hospital has
teamed up with AAI. They first

worked together to bring medical
supplies to Bolivia in 1996. The
Children's Hospital itself has
long been committed to bringing
aid to children in poverty-strick
en nations.
"All of our disciples, from doc
tors to nurses to pharmacists to
educators, have a passion for
helping children in need," said
Christopher Dawes, CEO of the
Children's Hospital.
All three organizations involved
appear to be satisfied with the pro
ject's immediate results. Accord
ingly, A\l has already decided to
visit other Argentine regions to de
termine possible needs for its fu
ture missions to the area.
"It was a very successful mis
sion, and AAI has determined to
return at least every two months
to deliver aid to the projects we
identified," Rivard said.
