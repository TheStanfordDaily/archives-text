MOSSY GROVE, Tenn. (AP) —
Searchers and dazed survivors went from
one shattered home to another yesterday,
picking through splintered lumber and torn
sheet metal for any sign of the missing, after
twisters and thunderstorms killed at least 35
people in five states.
More than 70 reported tornadoes cut a
path of destruction from Louisiana to Penn
sylvania over the weekend and into yester
day. Sixteen deaths were reported in Ten
nessee, 12 in Alabama, five in Ohio and one
each in Mississippi and Pennsylvania. More
than 200 people were injured.
"Yesterday, we had a nice brick house
and four vehicles. Today, we don't own a
toothbrush," said Susan Henry of Mossy
Grove, where seven people were killed and

at least 40 were still unaccounted for as of
midafternoon.
The tiny community 40 miles west of
Knoxville was nearly wiped off the map, with
about a do/en of the 20 or so homes reduced
to concrete foundations and piles of rubble a
few leet high.
The tornado — estimated by the Nation
al Weather Service as being between 200 —
and 300-yards wide — cut a five-mile path
across Morgan County.
Daylight brought a picture of destruction.
In Mossy Grove, clothes fluttered from tree
limbs. Power lines dangled from poles. Gars
lay crumpled after being tossed like toys.
About the only sound was the bleating of a
battery-operated smoke alarm buried deep
in the rubble.
