# Israeli tanks enter Tulkarem

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Do/ens of Is
raeli tanks swept into a Palestinian
refugee camp in the northern West
Bank early today, Palestinian security of
ficials said, in an apparent hunt for sus
pects in the shooting deaths of five Is
raelis, including a mother and her two
young sons.
Yesterday, in the second straight
day of violence to take children's lives,
a 2-year-old Palestinian boy was killed
as he played ball in the Gaza town of
Kafah. Palestinians said Israeli sol
diers fired the shots, but Israel said its
forces had returned fire and knew of
no casualties.
The incursion into the Tulkarem
refugee camp began at about 3 a.m.,
and there were no immediate reports
of injuries, the Palestinian officials said.
The Israeli army did not immediately
comment.
The refugee camp is believed to be a
hotbed of the A1 Acjsa Martyrs'
Brigade, a militia with ties to Palestin
ian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah move
ment, which claimed responsibility for
Sunday's shooting in the nearby com
munal farm of Kibbutz Metzer — a
community that symbolized Jewish-
Arab coexistence.
Troops backed by dozens of tanks
carried out searches for suspected mili
tants with ties to the group, Palestinian
security officials said on condition of
anonymity. The Israeli army did not im
mediate!) comment.
A senior Israeli military official said
Israel knew the shooter and his accom
plices came from Tulkarem, but were
dispatched by militants in Nablus.
I'he violence bodes ill for the mission
of U.S. envoy David Satterfield, who ar
rived yesterday to promote a plan for

restarting Mideast peace negotiations
and establishing a Palestinian state with
provisional borders by next year.
Satterfield was to meet yesterday with
other representatives of the so-called
Quartet backing the plan — the United
States, Russia, the European Union and
United Nations.
But notions of renewing peace talks
seemed a world away from the daily
grind of deadly violence, which two
years of myriad Israeli military measures
have failed to quell — and the killing of
the boy in Gaza was sure to further in
flame passions.
The dead boy's uncle said there was
no fighting going 011 at the time he was
killed. The boy was playing with a small
ball — suddenly we came under fire,"

said Mohammed Mashal, the uncle.
"When we looked toward I he boy we
found him lying 011 the ground in a pool
of his blood."
Earlier in the day, Sharon and De
fense Minister Shaul Viola/ toured
stricken Kibbutz Met/.er, including the
bedroom of Noam ()hion, 4, and broth
er Matam, 5, slain with their mother Re
vital while — neighbors said — reading
a bedtime story.
Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin
said the Israeli response will be "within
the parameters" of other recent actions
— seeming to rule out the expulsion of
Arafat, even though the government's
top decision-makers, Sharon, Mofaz and
Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
have supported the idea.
