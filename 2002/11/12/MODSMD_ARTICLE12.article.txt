# Iraqi lawmakers upset with U.N. resolution

### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraqi
lawmakers denounced a tough,
new U.N. resolution on weapons
inspections yesterday as dishonest,
provocative and worthy of rejec
tion — despite the risk of war. But
parliament said it ultimately will
trust whatever President Saddam
Hussein decides.
One after the other, senior law
makers rejected the resolution, the
latest in a long effort to ensure Iraq
scraps its weapons of mass destruc
tion. l his time, however, the Unit
ed States and Britain have made
clear they will attack Iraq if it does

not fully comply.
Parliament speaker Saadoun
Hamadi said the resolution was
stacked with "ill intentions", "false
hood", "lies" and "dishonesty."
Salim al-Koubaisi, head of parlia
ment's foreign relations commit
tee, recommended rejecting the
resolution but also advised defer
ring to the "wise Iraqi leadership"
to act as it sees lit to defend Iraq's
people and dignity.
"The committee advises . . .
the rejection of Security Council
Resolution 1441, and to not
agree to it in response to the

opinions of our people, who put
their trust in us," al-Koubaisi told
fellow lawmakers.
Saddam has used parliament's
action as cover for difficult deci
sions in the past, and harsh
rhetoric does not necessarily mean
parliament will reject the proposal.
Saddam ordered parliament to
recommend a formal response,
and lawmakers were expected to
vote on recommendations for the
Iraqi leadership today.
Iraq has until Friday to accept
or reject the resolution, approved
unanimously last week by the U.N.

Security Council. Exactly when on
Friday was left intentionally vague
in the resolution, IJ.N. spokesman
Fred Fckhard said.
There are numerous interpre
tations for the deadline — the
minute the resolution was adopt
ed, the minute Iraq was notified,
the end of business Friday, or mid
night on Friday. It is up to the Se
curity Council to interpret its own
resolution, Fckhard said.
If Saddam fails to follow
through, a Pentagon plan calls for
more than 200,000 troops to in
vade Iraq.
