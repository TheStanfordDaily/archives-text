## The 						Stanford Daily Student-led '8-Mile' revolt a cause for concern 
### 
Last Wednesday when FLiCKS host
ed a sneak preview of Eminem's re
cently released movie, "8-Mile,"
there was an outcry of dissatisfac
tion from the student body. To put it mild
ly, the recent sneak preview fiasco is trou
bling on several levels.
Many students expressed frustration
over the fact that Stanford Student Enter
prises distributed 500 tickets earlier that
week, 100 more than Cubberley Auditori
um capacity. Others were upset by what
they saw as unfair admissions practices,
mainly that some members of the SSE staff
allowed their friends to cut in line. A few
people even reported that security was
abrasive when students began trying to
sneak into the preview through the School
of Education building's windows.
Frustration quickly turned to anger as stu-

dents began to burn their tickets in a demon
stration against the FLiCKS staff's unfair
practices, and the staff was forced to call in
extra police officers to deal with the crowd.
Many of these students' complaints are
justified. Their frustrations with the SSE
staff's unprofessional behavior is valid. Be
cause SSE is a business, its staff should be
careful to act professionally at all times.
Specifically, in an event of this nature when
so many students are going to be disappoint
ed if they cannot get in, staff members must
steer clear from giving off the impression
that anyone is receiving special treatment.
On the other hand, we commend SSE
for hosting an event of this nature. With
out disregarding the concerns from sever
al unhappy students, it's important to note
that 400 students walked away from the
movie happy that SSE held the viewing.

This idea speaks volumes for the organiza
tion and reiterates SSE's ability to gauge
student interest.
Next time around, however, SSE should
make an extra effort to communicate to wait
ing students that seating is not guaranteed.
Further, students at the end of the line
should have been told earlier that they
weren't going to get in. People have better
tilings to do than wait around all day as SSE
prepares the theater.
Moreover, it's very easy to say in retro
spect that fewer tickets should have been
distributed in the days prior the event, but
the truth is that you never can tell how
many people will actually show up to an
event where tickets are free. And we whole
heartedly believe that the over-distribution
of tickets on the part of SSE was made in a
valid attempt to make sure that the screen-

Taking into account all of SSE's deficien
cies, we're very surprised by the student re
action. In these times of apparent student ap
athy, the response suggests that Stanford stu
dents do actually care about something other
than problem sets and alcohol probation.
So, for those who didn't make it into the
screening, waiting two days and paying $7.50
is by no means the worst societal injustice that
we've heard of. Further, the dissatisfaction
with the SSE staff and sneak preview show
ings in general should be approached with a
little bit of perspective.
In other words, even though the film
boasts one of the most distinguished and in
fluential artists of our time, it's just a movie,
and your outrage is better spent on more sig
nificant issues like world hunger or the im
pending war on Iraq.
