# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Missing New York City 
### 
I've been in a New York state of
mind ever since the leaves started
changing color and the weather has
been the type that television weath
ermen and hopeless romantics call
"crisp." So much so that I unearthed my
old Billy Joel albums and felt like I was
skating in Wollman Rink in Central Park.
In San Francisco, there's the Presidio
where you can go to escape the city, frees
everywhere, and the city looks like it's a
million miles away. In New York, we
have Central Park — the skyscrapers sur
rounding it inhibit its ability to really iso
late you from the urban environment.
It's still a wonderfully surreal place, trees
all around you and, above that, gleaming
steel skyscrapers and stodgy brick towers.
1 know I came to California to get away

from it, but New York is
still home, and it's still
where my allegiance lies.
It's still where my team
plays (let's go Mets!) and
where my subway runs
and where I can pretty
much navigate any
where in the city. I can
tell you the best place to

J r --
get a canoli (Nick's Pizza), the l)est diners
(Cee Whiz and Burger Heaven), the best
Chinese food (Sammy's Noodle Shop),
the best place to get a slice of pizza (actu
ally, it's getting to be impossible to find a
good slice of New York style pizza in New
York, but there are a bunch of places on
Bleeker Street that are pretty good).
There are things out here that 1 just
don't understand. Back home, the subways
run 24 hours a day. The trains run infre
quently late at night, and the stations can
get kind of seedy, but the trains always run.
So when 1 would go see the "Rocky Horror
Picture Show" at midnight, and stumble
back out into the real world at a.m., there
was transportation back home. And it's
cheap and reliable and makes some
amount of sense.
We also believed in only having a limited
number of well-connected public trans
portation systems, as opposed to the Bay
Area's conglomeration of a dozen different
disconnected, disjointed systems that don't
actually go anywhere. In New York, when
you get hungry, there's always a round-the
clock coffee shop or diner open within
walking distance. In a college town, I c an't
understand the lack of these fundamentals
— real pizza places, hole-in-the-wall Chi
nese take-out joints and 24-hour diners. It
just doesn't make sense.
I've been trying to explain to people
what a real pizza is like. It's a large, fairly
flat thing. The outer crust is thick and
puffy, and the inner crust (the part that
the cheese sits on) is incredibly thin. Ide
ally, the bottom of the pizza is crisp, and
the slice can be comfortably folded in half
for easy eating. Domino's is not real pizza

by any stretch of the imagination. Doesn't
anyone else find the cheese medicinal,
the crust greasy, and the entire enter
prise a little too sanitized and McDon
alds-like? People get oddly defensive
about Domino's, but it's not like they're a
local family-owned pizza place that needs
the business.
My quest fora real slice of pizza hasn't
been very fruitful, so I've redirected my
efforts toward the pursuit of good Chi
nese food. A couple of days ago I missed
dinner so 1 could order take-out but then
forgot about it. And by the time my
growling stomach reminded me of the
problem, all the Chinese places were
closed or not delivering. Unexpectedly, a
girl in my dorm offered to drive me in ex
change fora fortune cookie, the pleasure
of my company and the excuse not to do
work. So I'm riding in this girl's car, late
at night, going to go pickup Chinese
food, talking about our families, doing a
very made-for-TV-sitcom collegesque
tiling, and I'm seeing myself as an inse
cure 10-year-old from a camp photo on
my dad's desk. It wasn't even that big of a
deal — I could still cany on a conversa
tion like the 18-year-old I am (as of today,
woo-boo! cigarettes and porn for every
one!), but the experience never feels real
when I'm second guessing whether or
not I'm mature enough to be having
these experiences.
Just about everyone I know is bother
ing me to write about them in my col
umn, so in an effort not to look like a total
tool, let's just say I'm thankful for all the
incredible people I've met here so far. My
parents tried pretty hard to discourage
me from going to school on the West
Coast. They knew ii was a losing battle,
but they tried anyway. My dad's words of
wisdom to me went something like this
"Cornell, MIT, CM U, even UMich; if you
break your leg, we can get in the car and
drive like crazy and be there — if you go
to Stanford, you'd better find a good sup
port group real quick."
Well, I've found a great support
group out here at the Farm. From the
people who lend me their notes or pick
up the handouts when I sleep through
lecture to the people who not so subtly
kick me in the shins when I fall asleep in
I-Hum section. I wouldn't be surviving
right now if it wasn't for you all. So there,
an implicit shout-out to everyone in my
karass (for those who haven't been en
lightened to the teachings of Bokonon
from Kurt Vonnegut's books, a karass is
"a team (of people) which unknowingly
executes Cod's Will"). Have you hugged
your friends today?
