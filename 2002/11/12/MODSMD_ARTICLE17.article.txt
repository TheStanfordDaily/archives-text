'It's not fair' to blame Israel for all of
Palestinian misery
Salam Al-Marayati, billed by The Daily
as one of I he most prominent Muslim ac -
tivists in the United States, is not justified
in calling Israel's policies toward Palestini
ans "apartheid" ("Muslim activist discuss
es libei ties," Nov. 1 1). Eighteen percent of
Israel's population is Muslim. They have
full lights as Israeli citizens. The Arabs of
the West Bank and Gaza are not Israeli cit
izens and therefore do not have citizen
ship rights. Israel took over control of the
West Bank from Jordan in 1967 in a war
instigated by the Arabs, who militarily at
tacked Israel seeking her destruction.
In 1993, under the Oslo accords,
these Palestinians came under the juris
diction of the Palestinian Authority and
their "elected" leader Yasir Arafat. The
Palestinian Authority has squandered
monies donated to help ease the suffer
ing of tlu- Palestinian refugees on
weapons, terrorism and lining their own
Swiss bank accounts.
It is not fair to put all the blame for the
Palestinian misery on Israel without con
sidering the culpability of the Palestini
ans' own leadership or the responsibility

of other Arab nations, among them
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq,
who were directly responsible for the
wars of 1948 and 1967. Israel has tried to
negotiate peace with Arafat, and we all
know how that is going.
Most recently, former Prime Minister
Ehud Barak offered 97 percent of all the
Palestinians were asking, and their re
sponse was jihad. Israel lias re-occupied
West Bank towns to try to keep out the
homicide bombers and to find and arrest
terrorists living among the population.
Israel must do this to protect her citizens,
both Jewish and Muslim, because Arafat
won't. For Al-Marayati to call for divest
ment from Israel without speaking at all
of the faults of the Palestinians and her
surrounding Arab neighbors is to com
mit the sin of omission.
As far as the water issue that Al-Maray
ati brings up, Israel has fulfilled all of its
obligations under the Interim Agreement .
In response to the threat to water posed by
the Intifada, Palestinian and Israeli water
officials issued a joint statement on Jan. 31,
2001, opposing any damage to water and
waste water infrastructure and expressing
the intent to ensure the water supply to all
the Palestinian and Israeli towns, villages

and cities. Israel and the Palestinian Au
thority carry out joint patrols to locate
cases of water theft and other water-relat
ed problems.
