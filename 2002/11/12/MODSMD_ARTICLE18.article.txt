It is the wee hours of morning. The
alarm clock rings, and a man leaps out of
heel and t ails to his wile and children. It is
a family thing. It is time to pray. It is time
to show we care. It is time for Ramadan,
the Muslim holy month of fasting which
began last Wednesday.
Why do Muslims fast? Good question.
There isn't only one reason why, fora
whole month, Muslims all over the world
eat at sunrise and then abstain from eating
or drinking until sunset. Fasting is pre
scribed to make Muslims closer to God. It
teaches us to have stronger willpower and
greater self-control. It makes us morecon

siderate toward the less fortunate in soci
ety, toward those who do not get anything
to eat.
To those unfamiliar with Ramadan,
the notion of fasting fora month may
seem bizarre. There is no doubt thai it
is challenging, but there is also no
doubt that we feel better for it. What
makes us human beings is our ability
to control our desires and to ponder
over reality. From that sense, Ra
madan sharpens those attributes in
Muslims. To not drink or cat during
the day teaches us to control our
hunger and thirst, two of the most
basic human emotions.
I lie most special aspect of Ramadan
is the community spirit that it creates

and the friendships that emerge from it.
During Ramadan, family and friends
gather together in the morning as we
begin the fast.
Life does not stop lor Muslims during
Ramadan. On the contrary, I believe
that Muslims at Stanford probably do
better in our school work during this
month, because we learn not to take life
for granted. Ramadan reminds us all
that we are privileged, but with that priv
ilege comes responsibility.
No discussion of Ramadan at Stanford
would be complete without mentioning
the iftars. I liar is the meal that Muslims
have when we break our last, and, at Stan
ford, about 100 of us come together each
night for this merry occasion.

When we gather tor iftar, we are one
large family, regardless of race, ethnici
ty, gender or major. I lie lbod at our if
tars — Arabian, (Chinese, Pakistani, even
KTC — is as diverse as the people in at
tendance. Alter our iftars, we gather to
gether tor an hour of prayer.
Many things have been said about
Muslims these days, but I encourage you
to lorm your own opinions. To that end,
the Islamic Society at Stanford invites ev
eryone in the Stanford community to an
()pen (Community Iftar we will be having
on Nov. 23.
