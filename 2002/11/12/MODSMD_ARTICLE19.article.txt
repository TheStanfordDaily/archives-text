After falling to eventual champion Agata
Cioroch of Georgia in her opening round sin
gles match, freshman Alice Barnes recovered to
overpower the consolation field.
Barnes turned in an impressive showing by
defeating second-seeded Vilmarie Castellvi of
Tennessee 6-3, 2-0, 6-3 in the singles consola
tion final late Saturday. The lengthy match
followed Barnes' 6-2, 6-1 semifinal battering
of Fresno State's Chloe Carlotti earlier in the
day.
"I was really pleased with my performance in
the final, since it was a pretty tight match, and we
had played a lot of tennis up to that point,"
Barnes said. "I think it showed that our fitness
training is right on."
Barnes added that having her teammates
around her for such an important match gave
her a big boost.
"[Junior] Lauren [Barnikow] gave me some
good advice before I went on court, and that
helped." she said. "Halfway through 1 heard
[sophomore] Erin | Burdette] and Lauren cheer

ing me on from behind my court, and I knew
that they had won the doubles, so that spurred
me on to try and get a Stanford double."
The pressure could have been unnerving
for Barnes with so much riding on her match,
but the Cardinal freshman assumed her task
with great poise.
"I was a little nervous going into the match as
I knew that a win would help our team ranking
[which will be released within the next two
months], but I got a good start and went from
there," Barnes said.
()n the doubles side of the consolation draw,
the veteran team of Barnikow and Burdette
stormed to consolation victory with an 8-5 win

over Kentucky's Jill Buckey and Amy Trefethen.
"1 would say our experience is a significant
factor in our doubles play," Barnikow said.
"This is because Erin and I played together all of
last year and even before we came to Stanford.
Experience as a doubles team is important be
cause we can tell when our partner is struggling
or needs some pumping up."
Barnikow and Burdette's success as a pair is
increasing as the year wears on.
"As a team, we are comfortable with each
other on the court," Barnikow said. "Also, every
time we play we try to improve on something. In
