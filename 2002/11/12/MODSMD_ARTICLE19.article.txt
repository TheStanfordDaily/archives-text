After falling to eventual champion Agata
Cioroch of Georgia in her opening round sin
gles match, freshman Alice Barnes recovered to
overpower the consolation field.
Barnes turned in an impressive showing by
defeating second-seeded Vilmarie Castellvi of
Tennessee 6-3, 2-0, 6-3 in the singles consola
tion final late Saturday. The lengthy match
followed Barnes' 6-2, 6-1 semifinal battering
of Fresno State's Chloe Carlotti earlier in the
day.
"I was really pleased with my performance in
the final, since it was a pretty tight match, and we
had played a lot of tennis up to that point,"
Barnes said. "I think it showed that our fitness
training is right on."
Barnes added that having her teammates
around her for such an important match gave
her a big boost.
"[Junior] Lauren [Barnikow] gave me some
good advice before I went on court, and that
helped." she said. "Halfway through 1 heard
[sophomore] Erin | Burdette] and Lauren cheer

ing me on from behind my court, and I knew
that they had won the doubles, so that spurred
me on to try and get a Stanford double."
The pressure could have been unnerving
for Barnes with so much riding on her match,
but the Cardinal freshman assumed her task
with great poise.
"I was a little nervous going into the match as
I knew that a win would help our team ranking
[which will be released within the next two
months], but I got a good start and went from
there," Barnes said.
()n the doubles side of the consolation draw,
the veteran team of Barnikow and Burdette
stormed to consolation victory with an 8-5 win

over Kentucky's Jill Buckey and Amy Trefethen.
"1 would say our experience is a significant
factor in our doubles play," Barnikow said.
"This is because Erin and I played together all of
last year and even before we came to Stanford.
Experience as a doubles team is important be
cause we can tell when our partner is struggling
or needs some pumping up."
Barnikow and Burdette's success as a pair is
increasing as the year wears on.
"As a team, we are comfortable with each
other on the court," Barnikow said. "Also, every
time we play we try to improve on something. In

this particular tournament, it was
keeping our intensity level high at
all times and simply being aggres
sive."
Every Cardinal player agreed
that last Thursday — t he first day of
competition — was not only disap
pointing but downright shocking.
Barnikow, Burdette and fresh
man Amber Liu were all eliminat
ed from their first-round matches,
as was Barnes, who fell 6-0, 6-4 to
the third-seeded Cioroch.
"Of course we were really disap
pointed with our first round losses,
but we realized that it was very im
[>ortant for the team that we putin a

strong performance in the consola
tion [bracket]," Barnes said.
Barnikow added, "I think that
after our first-round losses, we
were all a bit shocked and shaken
up a bit. Later that night, we fig
ured there was nothing else to do
but bounce back with good, solid
performances and to try to pick up
some wins."
After its first-round losses, the
Cardinal was relieved of some of its
pressure and adapted well to its
new situation.
"As we started to win in the back
draw, the matches became more
comfortable," Barnikow said.
"This got the momentum going
and built confidence for everyone.
I he more matches we played and
won, the harder it was to stop us
from winning again."

There was no question that
Stanford left Texas with a sense of
accomplishment. As a team, the
Cardinal compiled resounding
wins over some of the best players
in the country, thereby solidifying
its spot as a top team.
"We did not let the losses of the
first day bring us down," Barnikow
said. "Instead, I think our compet
itive intensity and desire to win in
creased ten-fold because we want
ed to prove to ourselves and to the
other teams that we can and will
bounce back."
As in previous tournaments,
the tenacity of the squad was
again evident.
"We wanted other teams to
know that we know how to light
and that we can bounce back from
any situation," Barnes said.
