## Facts on iraq 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This article is the seventh
in a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford communi
ty and the potential war in Iraq.

While a majority of Americans in
favor of carrying out military action
against Iraq, many Stanford stu
dents are still undecided on the
question of whether the United
States should wage war — an am
bivalence that many attribute to a
lack of information on the issues.
In an attempt to ascertain the
level of student knowledge about
facts surrounding the Iraq debate,
The Daily conducted an anony
mous informal survey of 50 Sum
ford students yesterday afternoon.
According to the poll's results,
students seemed to have a relatively
clear understanding of the underly
ing issues of the Iraq controversy
but are less knowledgeable about
developments within the last sever
al months.
Ninety-three percent of those
surveyed were able to supply one or
more reason as to why the Bush ad
ministration is currently seeking
military action against Iraq.
"The United Suites demands dis
armament and regime change with
in Iraq," one junior responded.
Eighty-four percent were able to
explain some of the ways that the
United States has been involved in
Iraq since the conclusion of the Per
sian Gulf War. Responses recog
nized missile strikes, enforcement of
no-fly zones, weapons inspections
and other efforts that were carried
out in the region.
Some students mentioned the

negative effects that the post-Gulf
War peace terms have brought
upon Iraq.
"Think of the thousands of inno
cent Iraqis that have died due to the
worthless economic sanctions," a
sophomore said.
While students appeared to be
relatively aware of the history of the
Iraq conflict, knowledge of more re
cent Iraq developments was consid
erably less prevalent. Seventy per
cent of those polled were unaware
that the U.S. Congress recently
passed a resolution granting Presi
dent George W. Bush the power to
carry out a military campaign with
or without U.N. approval.
While the United Nations has
just passed a resolution requiring
Iraq to allow weapons inspectors, 84
percent of students who responded
understood that the United Nations
has passed no resolution to support
military action.
A number of individuals who in
correctly replied that Congress had
not allowed President Bush to use
force against Iraq also incorrectly
believed that the United Nations
had authorized military action
against Iraq.
Ninety-three percent of those sur
veyed were able to identify some sort
of argument against attacking Iraq.
"It would provoke a hostile re
sponse from Iraq and increaseanti-
U.S. sentiment," a senior explained.
"It is also immoral — it would hurt
civilians."
Other students brushed off the
need for an attack, claiming that the
potential action against Iraq has
been "motivated mostly by oil," as a
sophomore explained.

Another sophomore said, "The
U.S. is actually being the 'terrorist'
by attacking."
Sixty-eight percent of students
pointed out what they thought
would be historically "significant or
unique" if the U.S. were to attack
Iraq.
"It would be the first unpro
voked attack," a sophomore ex
plained.
However, not all students ex
pressed such a negative attitude to
ward military action.
"I think what would be histori
cally unique would be the first real
efTort by the U.S. to be effective and
not give in to inaction," a senior
said. "We don't need appeasement
again. We know from experience
that doesn't work."

Many students said that they felt
media coverage of the Iraq issue lias
been sufficient.
"I have not paid much attention
since being here," a junior said.
"But I'm sure if I had been respon
sible and watched the news, I would
know all I needed to."
"The media has been pretty in
depth on this one," another junior
said.
Some complained of unbalanced
coverage about the Iraq issue.
"I think the media have not
shown all sides of the issue," a
sophomore declared. "It is very
American-centric. There is not
enough coverage on why we
shouldn't go to war."
Other students did not express
interest in the issue nor any concern
with their lack of knowledge on the
subject.
"Apparently there is not enough
on MTV about this," a sophomore
said, "or else I would know more."
