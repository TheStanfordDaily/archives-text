Men's Tennis

Thurs. thru Sat.: David Martin/Scott Lipsky reach
doubles semifinals at ITA/Omni National Indoor
Championships

The Cardinal meted out fierce competi
tion the previous weekend at the Omni Re
gionals at Saint Mary's College in Moraga.
Ultimately, two doubles teams — freshmen
K.C. Corkery and James Pade, and seniors
David Martin and Scott Lipsky — were sent
to the national competition. By merit of his
high ranking, Mat tin also went to play in the
singles tournament.
After some early victories, the competi
tion improved and the pressures created
some cracks in Stanford's lineup.
The second-seeded doubles team of Lip
sky and Martin got off to a good start on
Thursday, advancing to the semifinals with
two victories, the first of which was an 8-5
first-round win over Auburn-Mont
gomery's Fero Babej and Sebastian Fit/.
Lipsky and Martin then defeated Arizona
State's Oliver Charroin and Chris Stewart
8-4 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals,
though, the duo fell 9-7 to Richard and
William Barker of Rice.
Lipsky and Martin have now reached at
least t he semifinals of t he last three "major" col
legiate tennis tournaments — the NCAA
Championships, the I TAAII-American Cham
pionships and the Omni National Indoors.
Head coach Dick Could remarked on the
overall solid play in the tournament, but
paid particular notice to the reliability of the
Lipsky-Martin doubles team.
"No matter who they play, Martin and
Lipsky are a great doubles team, and they
are pretty much guaranteed to make it to the
finals or semifinals," Could said.
On Thursday, Corkery and fade fell
to Texas A&M's Lester Cook and Ante
Matijevic 8-4 in the main draw's first
round, but bounced back with an 8-2
consolation quarterfinal win over North
ern Illinois' Juan Pablo Barriga and

Erick Martinez.
In the consolation doubles semifinals on
Friday, (-orkery and Pade nearly pulled oil a
major upset of top-seeded Michael Calkins
and Amer Delic of' Illinois, but the Stanford
pair fell just short, losing 9-8.
Martin was the only Stanford player fea
tured in the 32-player singles competition.
The sixth-seeded Martin fell to Miami's (Fla.)
Todd Widom 7-0,4-6, 6-1.
Lipsky was designated the "first alternate"
iu the singles tournament giving him the
chance to play if any singles player withdrew.
Unfortunately for Lipsky, no one did.
With a little fine-tuning, Gould said lie
thinks a great team can emerge from the
players lie has this season.
"The three tournaments we've played this
year show that the little things make a big dif
ference," Gould said.
The national indoors concluded the meat
oft lie (Cardinal's fall season, though the team
will spend the next two weeks practicing in
preparation for an exhibition tournament at
I lawaii, which will conclude the fall season.
"There are going to be a lot of close
matches this year," Gould said. "There's a
very fine margin between having a good
year and a great year. Right now, I think
we're playing some pretty solid tennis, and
by the time we really get going, we'll be
(long quite well."
