Arizona St. 30-19, 30-20, 30-1 8
Sunday: Stanford def. No. 3 Hawaii
31-29, 30-28, 30-26

Which all made it that much
sweeter for Stanford when the
Cardinal wiped the floor with the
Wahine in a three-game sweep,
31-29, 30-28, 30-24, which
stunned the sold-out crowd of
10,252 at the Stan Sheriff" Center
in I lonolulu.
With its second victory over a
No. 1 team in two weeks — Stan
ford knocked off then-No. 1
Southern California on Nov. 2 —
Stanford (24-3) regained the No. 1
ranking it started the year with.
4'he Wahine's (23-1) first loss of
the year knocked them down to
No. 3 in this week's poll.
The win put the Cardinal in an
excellent position to receive one of
the top four seeds in the NCAA
Tournament, which guarantees
home court advantage up to the

Final Four.
Sophomore All-American out
side hitter Ogonna Nnainani had
a huge night for the defending na
tional champions, slamming down
19 kills at a blistering .630 hitting
clip to guide the Cardinal to its
biggest win of the season.
Nnamani exploded as the
Wahine were able to slow down
senior outside hitter Logan Tom,
who picked up Hi kills on a
match-high 51 swings. Senior
outside hitter Ashley Ivy and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McCee
also picked up the slack on the at
tack, combining for 20 kills while
hitting over .400.
Hawaii, which entered the
match with the nation's highest kill
and hitting averages, looked in
creasingly overmatched as the
night wore on, ending the contest
down 61-54 in the kill column.
Stanford also outhit the Wahine
.321 to .237.
The Cardinal was able to take a
little out ol the Wahine's viscious
leftside combination of outside hit
ters Kim Willoughby and Lily
Kahumoku, ceding 39 kills to the
two, but forcing each to hit under
.300 in the match. Willoughby and
Kahumoku were able to hit
around the NCAA-leading Stan
lord block, which only finished
with 6.5 blocks, but an above-par
defensive effort bv the Cardinal
made up for that.
Ivy finished with a match-high
16 digs to go along with nine each
from Tom and senior defensive
spec ialist Lindsey Yamasaki.
The teams exchanged runs
early in the opening game, with a
six-point streak putting 1 lawaii up
13-9 before Stanford stormed back
to take a 15-14 lead. The Cardinal
got to game point at 29-27, but a
kill and a block by Hawaii evened
things at 29-29. A kill by Ivy and a
block by McGee and junior setter
Anna Robinson sealed a 31-29
game-one win for Stanford.
The Cardinal overcame an

early 4-1 deficit in the second
game to open up a sizable 24-18
lead, but the resilient Wahine
closed i he gap to just one at 27-20.
The teams sided-out from there,
with the Cardinal closing out a 30-
28 game-two win when Willough
by foot-faulted on a serve.
The match was in the bag early
in the third game, as the Cardinal
scorched Hawaii early to take a 15-
9 advantage. There was no come
back in store for the Wahine in the
final game, which Stanford took
30-24.
The win came on the heels of
Stanford's dominating perfor
mance over then-No. 23 Arizona
State on Friday in Pacific-10 Con
ference action.
The Cardinal outhit the Sun
Devils .485 to. 194 in the 30-19,30-

20,30-18 sweep in front 0f2,333 at
Maples Pavilion to improve to 13-2
in conference play. Arizona State
fell to 6-8 in the Pac-10, 10-9 over
all, with the loss and its subsequent
defeat to California on Saturday.
Tom, who was named this
week's Pac-10 Player of the Week
fora record ninth time in her ca
reer, guided the way for Stanford
with 18 kills and a .054 hitting per
centage, while Nnamani hit .765
on the night and picked up 13 kills.
Freshman backup setter Katie
Goldhahn went down with a
sprained ankle in the third game

31-29, 30-28, 30-26

Which all made it that much
sweeter for Stanford when the
Cardinal wiped the floor with the
Wahine in a three-game sweep,
31-29, 30-28, 30-24, which
stunned the sold-out crowd of
10,252 at the Stan Sheriff" Center
in I lonolulu.
With its second victory over a
No. 1 team in two weeks — Stan
ford knocked off then-No. 1
Southern California on Nov. 2 —
Stanford (24-3) regained the No. 1
ranking it started the year with.
4'he Wahine's (23-1) first loss of
the year knocked them down to
No. 3 in this week's poll.
The win put the Cardinal in an
excellent position to receive one of
the top four seeds in the NCAA
Tournament, which guarantees
home court advantage up to the

Final Four.
Sophomore All-American out
side hitter Ogonna Nnainani had
a huge night for the defending na
tional champions, slamming down
19 kills at a blistering .630 hitting
clip to guide the Cardinal to its
biggest win of the season.
Nnamani exploded as the
Wahine were able to slow down
senior outside hitter Logan Tom,
who picked up Hi kills on a
match-high 51 swings. Senior
outside hitter Ashley Ivy and ju
nior middle blocker Sara McCee
also picked up the slack on the at
tack, combining for 20 kills while
hitting over .400.
Hawaii, which entered the
match with the nation's highest kill
and hitting averages, looked in
creasingly overmatched as the
night wore on, ending the contest
down 61-54 in the kill column.
Stanford also outhit the Wahine
.321 to .237.
The Cardinal was able to take a
little out ol the Wahine's viscious
leftside combination of outside hit
ters Kim Willoughby and Lily
Kahumoku, ceding 39 kills to the
two, but forcing each to hit under
.300 in the match. Willoughby and
Kahumoku were able to hit
around the NCAA-leading Stan
lord block, which only finished
with 6.5 blocks, but an above-par
defensive effort bv the Cardinal
made up for that.
Ivy finished with a match-high
16 digs to go along with nine each
from Tom and senior defensive
spec ialist Lindsey Yamasaki.
The teams exchanged runs
early in the opening game, with a
six-point streak putting 1 lawaii up
13-9 before Stanford stormed back
to take a 15-14 lead. The Cardinal
got to game point at 29-27, but a
kill and a block by Hawaii evened
things at 29-29. A kill by Ivy and a
block by McGee and junior setter
Anna Robinson sealed a 31-29
game-one win for Stanford.
The Cardinal overcame an

early 4-1 deficit in the second
game to open up a sizable 24-18
lead, but the resilient Wahine
closed i he gap to just one at 27-20.
The teams sided-out from there,
with the Cardinal closing out a 30-
28 game-two win when Willough
by foot-faulted on a serve.
The match was in the bag early
in the third game, as the Cardinal
scorched Hawaii early to take a 15-
9 advantage. There was no come
back in store for the Wahine in the
final game, which Stanford took
30-24.
The win came on the heels of
Stanford's dominating perfor
mance over then-No. 23 Arizona
