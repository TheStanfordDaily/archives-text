# Yell leaders put Stanford to shame
## 
### 
As I sat in the stands and watched Saturday's
football game, I was not at all embarrassed
by our team's effort in USC's lopsided 49-
17 victory. Stanford gave its all, but the
team is really just too young and inexperienced to
compete in the Pac-10 this year as it has in years past.
Plus, 1 have full confidence that next year will bring
about much better results as the program's crop of
young talent develops.
Hut let me tell you something that 1 truly was embar
rassed by: our self-proclaimed "Yell Leaders" or Axe-
Squad or whatever you call them.

I'm currently in my third year at
Stanford, and I've been to my fair
share of football games here and
elsewhere for that matter â€” proba
bly a whole lot more than most of the
spectators in Stanford Stadium.
And if I have come away with
anything from these games at Stan
ford, it is the conclusion that the
Yell Leaders should get the hell off

the field. It's got to happen.
Maybe it's just me and my other meat-headed 112 i at
guy friends, but I have a feeling that if yon were to take
a straw-poll around campus, the Yell Leaders would
get voted off the island and their asses kicked off the
football Held in a New York second.
1 understand that they're there to get the crowd
cheering, which, in turn, might motivate our team to
play better. But the only thing 1 heard the crowd
cheering on Saturday in response to the Yell Leaders
was, "Shut the f&*% up!"
I'm probably not going to win too many friends
with this column, and I apologize if your roommate,
best friend or late-night-hook-up is a Yell Leader. I'm
sure they're all nic e people. I know a couple, and, off
the field, I like them a lot.
Hut they have no business doing what they do on the
