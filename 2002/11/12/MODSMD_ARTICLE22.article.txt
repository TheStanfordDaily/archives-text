# Yell leaders put Stanford to shame
## 
### 
As I sat in the stands and watched Saturday's
football game, I was not at all embarrassed
by our team's effort in USC's lopsided 49-
17 victory. Stanford gave its all, but the
team is really just too young and inexperienced to
compete in the Pac-10 this year as it has in years past.
Plus, 1 have full confidence that next year will bring
about much better results as the program's crop of
young talent develops.
Hut let me tell you something that 1 truly was embar
rassed by: our self-proclaimed "Yell Leaders" or Axe-
Squad or whatever you call them.

I'm currently in my third year at
Stanford, and I've been to my fair
share of football games here and
elsewhere for that matter — proba
bly a whole lot more than most of the
spectators in Stanford Stadium.
And if I have come away with
anything from these games at Stan
ford, it is the conclusion that the
Yell Leaders should get the hell off

the field. It's got to happen.
Maybe it's just me and my other meat-headed 112 i at
guy friends, but I have a feeling that if yon were to take
a straw-poll around campus, the Yell Leaders would
get voted off the island and their asses kicked off the
football Held in a New York second.
1 understand that they're there to get the crowd
cheering, which, in turn, might motivate our team to
play better. But the only thing 1 heard the crowd
cheering on Saturday in response to the Yell Leaders
was, "Shut the f&*% up!"
I'm probably not going to win too many friends
with this column, and I apologize if your roommate,
best friend or late-night-hook-up is a Yell Leader. I'm
sure they're all nic e people. I know a couple, and, off
the field, I like them a lot.
Hut they have no business doing what they do on the

sidelines of a fixjtball field. A f<x>tball
field is sacred ground, and it just
makes all of us look bad.
I get the idea, in theoiy. We're
smart and quirky, so we come up
with smart and quirky cheers.
But, in my humble opinion,
"Traverse the field, traverse the
field, increase the aggregate
yardage" isn't smart or quirky. It's

straight-up stupid. You don't say
that crap at a football game.
Instead, you drink beer, get
rowdy, curse at the opposing quarter
back and heckle the overweight line
men. You chant "bulls*%t" when the
referee makes a bad call, or any call
not in your team's favor. You mock
the star running back on the other
team for getting busted cheating on a
test or driving under the influence.
When your team picks up a first
down, you simply get up, scream
"First Down!" and maybe point
demonstratively in the direction

that your team is going. You don't
twirl around the sidelines like Brian
Boitano in the Free Dance competi
tion of the Figure Skating Champi
onships — which, I'm sorry, but the
Yell Leaders come pretty close to
imitating perfectly.
And "Penetrate, penetrate,
score, score." Don't even get me
started on that. Okay, so those
words are euphemisms for sex.
That's funny maybe the first one or
two times you hear it. But when you
reach 4,386 times, it's as funny as
Chinese Water Torture. Plus, every

time I hear it, 1 wait for the canned
laughter to follow like some cheesy
joke on an episode of original WB
programming. It's that bad.
On Saturday, with the game well
out of reach, some Yell I racier stall
ed a chant about something having to
do with a USC diploma and it not
being worth anything. So apparently,
here at Stanford, we're not just smart
and quirky; we're arrogant as hell
about it. Watching that chant get
started was like watching some runt
get his ass kicked during recess, then
turn around at his much stronger

and cooler adversary and whine (in as
nasal and weasel-like a voice as possi
ble), "At least I'm smarter than you."
Way to make our student body
look good, guys.
I can honestly say that I appreci
ate the time and effort the Yell Lead
ers put in, and I assume the athletes
do, too — this isn't sarcastic, I swear.
Getting the crowd riled up is a noble
cause at sporting events, and home
Held advantage should definitely
count for something.
But at a certain point, we've got
to stop the bleeding. I'm not sure

what exactly should go in its place.
But all 1 know is that we have to put
the collective animal that is the Yell
Leaders to sleep, and remove its car
cass from the football field.
Maybe that's all the Fun-and-
Gun needs to get going.
