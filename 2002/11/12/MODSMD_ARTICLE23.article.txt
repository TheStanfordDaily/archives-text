Friday: Stanford 23, Menlo College 15; Navy
29, Stanford 13

After Navy easily took care of Menlo
30-6 in the first match of the triangular
meet, Stanford garnered its first victory
of the season and handed the Oaks
their second defeat with a 23-15 win. In
the finale, the Cardinal fell to the Mid

shipmen 29-13.
"Despite coming in with some disad
vantages, I think we could have per
formed better," Stanford head coach
Steve Buddie said. "We gol opening-day
jitters out of the way, but I think this team
and certainly the coaches have a higher
expectation of ourselves this year."
Against Menlo, redshirt sophomore
Brad Met/let got the Cardinal on the
board with ;in impressive 10-0 decision at
133 pounds after Stanford forfeited at 125
as junior Nathan Peterson was out of the
lineup because of a suspension.
In the next bout, senior Justin Walker
had three takedowns in a 7-2 decision to
put Stanford up 7-(i for the meet.
In one of tlie more exciting bouts of'the

night, sophomore Scott Polley took on
Menlo's Saul Lucatero, who is the No. 1
ranked 149-pounder in the NAIA.
Polley jumped out to an early lead
with two early takedowns and a near fall
in the first period. Leading 10-5 at the
start of the third and final period, Polley
held ofFLucatero's best efforts at a conic
back to win 12-10.
Menlo answered at 157 pounds as Joey
Martinez, defeated Stanford junior Gar
rett Johnston 11-3 to knot the team score
at 10 apiece at the halfway point of the
match, much to the delight of the large
contingent of Menlo fans in the bleachers.
Johnston started in place of last year's
win-leader Matt Gentry, who lig
ures to be ready for the team's next
dual after battling a sickness.
The impressive collegiate debuts
of two redshirt freshmen put Stan
ford back ahead for good.
At 165, Brennan Corbett scored
a 3-1 overtime decision against
Eddie Lucatero to quiet the Menlo
crowd.
After the referee deducted a
point from Menlo for unsportsman
like conduct, Stanford's Ryan
Hagen demonstrated the form that
made him a three-time Montana
state champion with a pin of David
de la Fuente in the first period of his
first collegiate bout.
"It was exciting and a good way
for me to start off," Hagen said.
Moving from the inexperienced
to the experienced, Harold Penson
started his senior season off with a
bang and stretched the Cardinal
lead to 23-9 with a 9-0 major deci
sion at 184.
Menlo closed out the scoring
with wins over two more Stanford
redshirt freshmen who were mak
ing their first meet appearances,
Nick Lukens at 197 and heavy
weight Shawn Ritzenthaler.
In the finale against Navy, Met
zler earned his second dominating
win, justifying his No. 17 national

ranking with a 10-1 major decision
over Matt Gulosh.
"I wrestled pretty well, but 1
think I wrestled a little conservative
ly," Metzler said. "I was doubting
my conditioning a little, and I still
have a lot of room to improve."

Walker also tallied his second win
with a hard-fought 7-3 victory over
another Gulosh, Matt's older broth
er Eddie.
At 149, Polley bounced back to
garner his first win of the year and
put Stanford ahead 10-6 followinga

6-3 decision.
Navy's Michael Carbonaro tied
the meet at 10-10 with an 18-8
major decision over Stanford red
shirt freshman Zack Hensleyat 157.
In the next bout, Corbett
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead over
Navy's Luke Lazzo, but Lazzo had
evened the bout at 3-3 heading into
the third period.
An escape to open the final period
put Corbett up 4-3, but Lazzo re
sponded with an escape of his own
and then a takedown with 30 seconds
left in the bout to secure the 6-4 victo
ry which put Navy on top 13-10.
Hagen followed up his first win
with a thrilling 6-4 overtime deci
sion, bringing the Stanford crowd to
its loudest noise level all night.
But Navy responded with two
consecutive pins by Thayer Paxton
and senior Jim Letchfordat 184 and
197 pounds, respectively, to put the
match out of reach.
Navy senior heavyweight Steve
Kovach, ranked No. 8 in the nation
in his weight class, 112 inished the scor
ing with a 13-4 major decision over
Ritzenthaler.
Stanford will not be in action
again until a Nov. 20 home date
with San Francisco Suite.
"We've definitely got some areas
we can improve upon in practice,"
Buddie said. "From a lineup stand
point, Matt Gentry probably should
Ije back by that time and we're
counting on having Nathan Peter
son back in our lineup [at 125]."
