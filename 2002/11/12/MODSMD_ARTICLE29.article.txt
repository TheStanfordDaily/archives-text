Despite rainy conditions at the McDonald's
Swim Stadium last weekend, the Stanford men
dove to strong finishes at the Trojan Diving In
vitational, hosted by Southern California.

Men's Diving

Friday (1 -meter): 1. Nick Bartolotta (CAL), 609.35; 2
Adam Peterson (STAN), 578.25; 4. Gavin Olmstead
(STAN), 558.351

On the first day of competition, sopho
more Adam Peterson took second place in the
3-meter springboard event with 477 points.
Senior Gavin Olmstead placed third with
450.85 points.
"I felt really good for where I am at this
point in the season," Olmstead said. "Some of
the other divers there were a little better pre
pared than us because they have been diving
since early August, and we started in mid-
September. In general, though, we were very
competitive with the rest of the field."
Each diver completed five required and sev
eral optional dives in the 3-meter competition.
Sophomore Jeff Durbin finished ninth in
the 3-meter semifinals with 349.45 points,just
two points short of qualifying for the eighth
spot in the final round.
The Cardinal entered the second day look
ing to match its strong showing from the day
before. Peterson, Olmstead and Durbin all
competed in the 1-meter springboard event
and fared well. Peterson added another sec
ond-place finish to his list of accomplish
ments, capping off the day with 578.25

points. California's Nick Bartolotta took top
honors with 609.35 points.
With a score of 558.35, Olmstead took
fourth place in the 1-meter event, and Durbin
earned 207.20 points, finishing in ninth
place.
During the 1-meter portion of the compe
tition, each diver executed six dives, includ
ing a forward, backward, reverse, inward and
twisting dive.
"All of the teams at the meet were from Cal
ifornia, which made it a lot of fun because we
knew most of the other divers," Durbin said.
"It was also really nice to get a feel for what we
have to expect for the rest of the year."
After experiencing their first taste of the
competition, the Cardinal divers left the meet
with an idea of what improvements they must
make in order to be competitive on the local
and national levels.
"We got a good feel for what mechanics are
there and also for what we still need to work
on in practice," Peterson said. "For the first
time this year, we felt what it was like to dive
under pressure, and now we can take those
experiences back into training and focus on
what is still shaky and not completely right."
If their performances last week were any
indication of what the rest of the season will
have to offer, the divers are confident that it
will be a success.
"When you look back a year ago and see
where we were and compare that to what we
can do today, you see an incredible amount of
improvement," Peterson said. "It is truly a
testament to all of the hard work that we have
been doing this year."
Though the Cardinal does not compete

again until January, Olmstead knows that it
will be ready to take on tough competition
later on in the season.
"No team will be better prepared for the
big meets than ours," Olmstead said. "Our
program really focuses on strength and tech
nique, and we have one of the finest coaches
in the country. I have no doubt that this will
take us all the way to the top."
