# Web site links engineers and public service

### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During the spring quarter of his senior year, Joel
Segre '02 faced a seemingly hopeless task: As a bio
medical engineering major, he wanted to "serve audi
ences that were traditionally underserved." Segre said
that, due to little encouragement from mentors and a
lack of available resources, ii was difficult for him, as a
Stanford engineering graduate, to find jobs working
in public service.
As a result, Segre created Engineering for Impact,
a Web site that serves as a networking tool for people
who are interested in finding "non-profit jobs that do
exist and are highly fulfilling," aiming to "socially mo
tivate [Stanford engineering students] to do some
thing that will change the world."
Discouraged by what he perceived to be a lack of
support from professors, Segre did his own research
and investigation to find a job with a non-profit orga
nization that lie describes enthusiastically as being "the

coolest thing ever." Now Segre
wants Engineering for Impact,
found at impact.stanford.edu, to
make it easier for Stanford students
to search for opportunities in this
line of work.
The Web site allows engineering
majors who want to design products
for less-developed countries to enter
their preferred location, topic, type
of job and engineering concentra
tion, with the goal of matching them
with compatible organizations.
Impact also allows students to
add in their own information and
contacts. Segre said that the "word
is getting out" and that the site will
only become more beneficial as
more people participate.
He wants Stanford engineering
majors to realize that their options
are not limited to the big-name,
high-profile companies that can af
ford to recruit students every year.
"Your impact will be greater if
you work with people for change
rather than money," Segre said,
adding that working fora non-prof
it does not mean $30,000 per year.

"Competitive salaries are avail
able," he said.
Engineering students agreed
that, within the school, opportuni
ties to get involved with public ser
vice are not as readily available as
jobs in the private sector.
"It takes more initiative [to find
jobs in this field]," said Sally Mad
sen, a second year graduate student
in mechanical engineering. As op
posed to public service opportuni
ties for students who are in more
humanities-based majors, "The
University does not have as many
resources," she said.
"Generally, engineers do not
consider public service," said Zach
Warder-Gabaldon, a second year
master's student in mechanical en
gineering. "No one frowns upon it,
but there is little awareness of it."
He added, "Students are nor
mally seduced by companies in the
private industry, so that becomes
ingrained in us. But once in a while,
something like [working for public
service] opens up."
The smaller budget ol non-prof
it organizations also renders them
less able to recruit Stanford engi
neering students, another factor in
the decreased visibility of public ser
vice opportunities.

"Ii is not as easy to get a non-gov
ernment group to come and
speak," said Rrenna I learn, co
president of Stanford's Society of
Women Engineers. "Big corpora
tions often approach us, and that
fills up our schedule."
She added, "I am happy to see
impact.stanford.edu providing re
sources that are hard to find here

on Stanford's campus."
Five months alter graduating,
Segre is currently working in India,
to develop intra-ocular lenses for
people who need cataract surgery.
1 lis group has manufactured a lens
that brings iis cost down from over
$ 100 to only $2 to $5, making it af
fordable for 200,000 people in
India per year to see clearly again.
