The Stanford women's diving
team faced rainy skies and general
ly mediocre competition this week
end in Los Angeles, as the Cardinal
outperformed the majority of (he
contending athletes at the Trojan
Invite at the McDonald's Swim Sta
dium on the campus of Southern
California.

Women's Diving

Friday (3-meter): 1. Blythe Hartley
(USC), 515.30; 2. McKenze Murphy
(STAN), 471.90; 5. Ashlee Rosenthal
(STAN), 439.55; 9. Michaela Skloven
(STAN), 208.35

Sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal
scored 528.05 points and claimed
second place in Thursday's 1 -meter
diving competition, just behind the
2002 NCAA Diver of the Year,
USC's Blythe Hartley.
"Ashlee's 1-meter finals was an
excellent performance," Stanford
coach Rick Schavone said.
Senior McKenze Murphy also
made her way to the finals and
racked up 473.05 points, clinching
the fourth-place spot. Freshman
Michaela Skloven ended the day in
10th place, missing the final round
by two spots.
Friday's 3-meter springboard
event presented more of a chal
lenge to the Cardinal divers due to
the rainy conditions. Nonetheless,
the Stanford women seemed al

most grateful for the experience.
"The extra stress that bad weath
er can cause is good practice for
dealing with the similar stress we
will be feeling during NCAA
zones," Murphy said.
After Friday's competition,
Stanford again had two high-scor
ing divers. Murphy raked in
471.90 points to take second place,
and Rosenthal placed fifth with
439.55. Skloven finished the com
petition by taking ninth place in
the semifinals.
For the second straight day,
USC's Hartley plowed through her
competitors to place first in the 3-
meter competition.
Schavone's squad opted not to
compete in platform diving.
Although the Cardinal re
turned to Stanford with many ac
complishments to be proud of, it
still has much left to work on.
While Rosenthal, Murphy and
Skloven put in a couple of solid
performances at USC and exhib
ited focus in light of stressful
weather, meets later in the year
will only be more competitive
and will require much stronger
diving.
"We're still in the training part
of our season, so I do not place a
lot of importance in competi
tion," Schavone said. "But I feel
after the last two weekends that
we definitely need to make some
significant improvements to
reach our goals."
