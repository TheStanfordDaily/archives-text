# Exhibition game tonight

The unranked Stanford
men's basketball team still exists
as somewhat of an enigma to
outsiders.
Simply put, no one's quite
sure how this young Cardinal
team will react. There are just too
many variables to account for.
The first and most obvious of
those variables is, of course, the
absence of would-be-seniors
wingman Casey Jacobsen and
center Curtis Borchardt, whose
respective decisions to leave
Stanford early for the NBA last
spring have yet to be translated
into tangible replacements.
The second variable sur
rounds team mentality. For the
first time in five years, Stanford
will be considered a clearcut
underdog for the majority of
the season â€” an idea that is
probably foreign to a group
of guys who were recruited
under the guise of a recent
Final Four appearance, No. 1
national rankings and three
consequtive Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships.
And third, the point guard /

leadership variable has present
ed itself as an issue. How will the
Cardinal respond lo the gradua
tion of point guard Tony Gio
vacchini, the injury to sopho
more guard Chris Hernandez
and the consequent shuffling of
positions, which will move se
nior Julius Barnes from the two
guard spot to the one?
The third variable will most
likely be answered the soonest as
Stanford will open up its 2002-
2003 campaign with an exhibi
tion game against the Olympic
Club at 7:00 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
Hernandez will miss four to
six weeks of play because of a
broken foot that he suffered
during practice. The sopho
more, known best for his hard
nosed style of play, was expect
ed to start his first game for the
Cardinal.
"Chris worked really hard
over the summer and earned
his spot as the starting point
guard," said sophomore Rob
Little. "1 know that he's going
to work hard to rehabilitate his
foot, and hopefully we will have
him back at the beginning of
Pac-10 play."
