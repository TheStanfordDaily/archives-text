# Deans unsure about effects of budget cuts

### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Since Provost John Etchemendy's an
nouncement to the Faculty Senate on Oct. 25
that the University may face an approximately
8 percent cut in general funds for Fiscal Year
2004, all budgetary units have been asked to
submit proposals outlining reductions by 5 per
cent., 7.5 percent and 10 percent, along with the
impacts of such cuts.
Though they have not yet determined what
specific cuts they will implement, deans of five
of the University's seven schools —Business,
Earth Sciences, Education, Engineering and
Humanities and Sciences — maintained that
programs integral to their schools' missions
would not be compromised and emphasized
that they do not foresee layoffs.
"We have not been told exactly 8 percent but
rather have been asked to show several scenar
ios," said Sharon Long, dean of humanities and
sciences. "The University will evaluate all of
these before deciding exactly what cuts to give
to various units."
Tim Warner, vice provost for budget and
auxiliaries management, said that by early Feb
ruary, once all of the proposals have been exam
ined, the University will look at the'Tmancial pic
ture" and then make specific decisions regarding
the extent of and where the cuts will be made.
"Until we see the proposals and examine
them carefully, it is too early to say how the bud
get cuts will affect schools and departments on
campus," Warner said.

Dean of Engineering Jim Plummer said that
he will spend the next couple of months look
ing at options for budget cuts.
"Since we have only just begun that process,
we cannot at this time say where the proposed
cuts will come from,"he said. "While any cuts
are obviously painful, the current situation re
quires that we look carefully at what we are
doing and prioritize what we are doing. We
cannot do everything, and what we choose to
do, we must do very well."
According to Dean of Earth Sciences Lynn
Orr, "The dollar amount of the cut will be
smaller for Earth Sciences than it will be for
some other parts of the University [because]
Earth Sciences receives a relatively small
amount of general funds from the University."
However, the school will not go unaffected
by the cuts and will plan accordingly.
"Right now, it looks like we will be able to
deal with the cuts by belt-tightening in a num
ber of areas, but without major reductions in
any one area," Orr said. "It is likely that we will
have to reduce funds available for special pro
jects, matching funds for equipment and pos
sibly some of the funds we use for unusual
field trips."
Stressing the need to "protect the core acad
emic functions of the school," Orr said that
Earth Sciences will "make sure that every ex
penditure is one that is appropriate and for our
core teaching and research, [and Earth Sci
ences will] try to do without the frills first."
Long seemed to share this sentiment. While
the School of Humanities and Sciences has not

determined any specific plans for each of the
different levels of possible reductions in funds,
the school's proposed reductions will be strate
gic and not across-the-board in nature, accord
ing to Long.
"Our first steps will be to make sure that we
are maximizing the use of all of our currently
available resources throughout the school, and
propose efficiencies that will be least damaging
to academic programs and their support."
It seems that some schools will be more af
fected than others by the budget cuts.
"It is going to be hard," said Dean of Educa
tion Deborah Stipek. She said that while a 5
percent cut would not cause a "huge amount of
pain," an 8 percent cut would be tougher to
handle, and a 10 percent cut would be even
more problematic.
"The first level of cuts will require some
