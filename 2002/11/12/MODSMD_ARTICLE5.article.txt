# Education issues on agenda of local reps
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Comprising a relatively small
percentage of the constituencies of
State Assemblyman Joe Simitian
and U.S. Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo, Stanford voters did not
play a tremendous role in re-elect
ing the two incumbents to their re
spective positions last week; many
Stanford students said they felt en
tirely uneducated about the candi
dates in the local elections.
Nonetheless, Eshoo and Simit
ian both said that they have a
strong desire to tackle issues that
affect higher education and Stan
ford students and that they will be
tackling such issues in their up
coming terms.
Simitian chairs the budget sub
committee on education finance,

giving him a large degree of con
trol over student issues like Cal
Grants, scholarship funds forcer
tain California residents that are
applicable to any public or private
university in California.
"Cal Grants is the one thing I
would mention that is likely to be
of particular concern to a number
of Stanford students," Simitian
said. "[lt's a] difficult budget year,
so one of the things I'm going to
be anxious about is our ability to
continue them."
Eshoo is currently working on
increasing funding for student
loans and legislation that would
allow students to write off more
interest on those loans.
" The Bush administration cut
the overall amount for student
loans. We can't stand for that," she
said. "If anything, there should be

more, so that more people in our
country have the opportunity to
get a new education."
She added, "The economy,
the economy, the economy. Once
you're prepared to go out into the
real world and the private sector,
what kind of world will be there?
Will they be able to write off in
terest on student loans? I have a
bill on that — I think it's very im
portant for both undergraduate

and graduate students.
"If someone wants to go into
education, they are si ill burdened
from the student loans and not al
lowed to write that interest off on
the debt."
Ultimately, Stanford and its vot
ers represent only a small portion
of the two legislators' constituen
cies. Stanford falls fairly close to the


ANNA-CHRISTINA DOUGIAS/The Stanford Daily
middle of the electoral districts of
Simitian and Eshoo, which both in
clude portions of San Mateo Coun
ty and Santa Clara County.
"Each [district in California has]
423,000-plus residents, so the
Stanford campus is a relatively
modest portion of that district, and
Stanford students are a smaller
piece still," Simitian said.
Simitian's district includes 13
cities and towns, as well as unin
corporated areas like Stanford.
Despite the relatively small im
pact Stanford voters have on de

termining Eshoo and Simitian's
political (ate, both say they consid
er heavily issues affecting the Stan
ford community.
"Stanford always affects my
thinking, my approaches, how I am
informed about the issues," Eshoo
said." I brag about Stanford being in
the heart of my constituency."
Simitian emphasized that his
district represents a "wide range of
interests and concerns" and that
his "obligation is to represent each
one of those communities as well as
if they were the only community in
my district," but also noted that he
is able to stay connected to Stan
ford because of the proximity of
his office — located across from
campus in Town and Country Vil

lage — and the contact he has with
student interns.
Both candidates campaigned at
Stanford, most recent ly at candidate
forums at which the turnout was ex
tremely low — only several do/en
students attended each event.
Simitian chalked this up to stu
dents' busy schedules and the tim
ing of the elections.
"You know, 1 think it's always a
challenge in the fall, because of the
relatively late start that Stanford
gets in, beginning the school year,"
he said. "And people are under
standably focused on the start of
the school year and their own per
sonal situation. What we saw at
Stanford was pretty much the
same level of enthusiasm or inter

est as we saw around the state,
which was historically low."
This lack of enthusiasm was evi
dent in the apparently low student
voting turnout in the Stanford
precinct. Many did not vote at all,
like freshman Tammy Shuer.
"There was just too much work,
all the measures were too confus
ing, and I just didn't care enough,"
she said. "Here's the thing: 1 just
don't like any of the candidates."
Others focused more on their
home states, voting in absentee
ballots instead of re-registering.
"I'm from Oregon, I don't know
California issues, and 1 would've
been an uninformed voter here,"
said freshman Katie Eichner. "But
I did vote in Oregon."

Simitian's district includes 13
cities and towns, as well as unin
corporated areas like Stanford.
Despite the relatively small im
pact Stanford voters have on de

termining Eshoo and Simitian's
political (ate, both say they consid
er heavily issues affecting the Stan
ford community.
"Stanford always affects my
thinking, my approaches, how I am
informed about the issues," Eshoo
said." I brag about Stanford being in
the heart of my constituency."
Simitian emphasized that his
district represents a "wide range of
interests and concerns" and that
his "obligation is to represent each
one of those communities as well as
if they were the only community in
my district," but also noted that he
is able to stay connected to Stan
ford because of the proximity of
his office — located across from
campus in Town and Country Vil

lage — and the contact he has with
student interns.
Both candidates campaigned at
Stanford, most recent ly at candidate
forums at which the turnout was ex
tremely low — only several do/en
students attended each event.
Simitian chalked this up to stu
dents' busy schedules and the tim
ing of the elections.
"You know, 1 think it's always a
challenge in the fall, because of the
relatively late start that Stanford
gets in, beginning the school year,"
he said. "And people are under
standably focused on the start of
the school year and their own per
sonal situation. What we saw at
Stanford was pretty much the
same level of enthusiasm or inter

est as we saw around the state,
which was historically low."
This lack of enthusiasm was evi
dent in the apparently low student
voting turnout in the Stanford
precinct. Many did not vote at all,
like freshman Tammy Shuer.
"There was just too much work,
all the measures were too confus
ing, and I just didn't care enough,"
she said. "Here's the thing: 1 just
don't like any of the candidates."
Others focused more on their
home states, voting in absentee
ballots instead of re-registering.
"I'm from Oregon, I don't know
California issues, and 1 would've
been an uninformed voter here,"
said freshman Katie Eichner. "But
I did vote in Oregon."
Comprising a relatively small
percentage of the constituencies of
State Assemblyman Joe Simitian
and U.S. Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo, Stanford voters did not
play a tremendous role in re-elect
ing the two incumbents to their re
spective positions last week; many
Stanford students said they felt en
tirely uneducated about the candi
dates in the local elections.
Nonetheless, Eshoo and Simit
ian both said that they have a
strong desire to tackle issues that
affect higher education and Stan
ford students and that they will be
tackling such issues in their up
coming terms.
Simitian chairs the budget sub
committee on education finance,

giving him a large degree of con
trol over student issues like Cal
Grants, scholarship funds forcer
tain California residents that are
applicable to any public or private
university in California.
"Cal Grants is the one thing I
would mention that is likely to be
of particular concern to a number
of Stanford students," Simitian
said. "[lt's a] difficult budget year,
so one of the things I'm going to
be anxious about is our ability to
continue them."
Eshoo is currently working on
increasing funding for student
loans and legislation that would
allow students to write off more
interest on those loans.
" The Bush administration cut
the overall amount for student
loans. We can't stand for that," she
said. "If anything, there should be

more, so that more people in our
country have the opportunity to
get a new education."
She added, "The economy,
the economy, the economy. Once
you're prepared to go out into the
real world and the private sector,
what kind of world will be there?
Will they be able to write off in
terest on student loans? I have a
bill on that — I think it's very im
portant for both undergraduate

and graduate students.
"If someone wants to go into
education, they are si ill burdened
from the student loans and not al
lowed to write that interest off on
the debt."
Ultimately, Stanford and its vot
ers represent only a small portion
of the two legislators' constituen
cies. Stanford falls fairly close to the

middle of the electoral districts of
Simitian and Eshoo, which both in
clude portions of San Mateo Coun
ty and Santa Clara County.
"Each [district in California has]
423,000-plus residents, so the
Stanford campus is a relatively
modest portion of that district, and
Stanford students are a smaller
piece still," Simitian said.
Simitian's district includes 13
