# Education issues on agenda of local reps

### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Comprising a relatively small
percentage of the constituencies of
State Assemblyman Joe Simitian
and U.S. Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo, Stanford voters did not
play a tremendous role in re-elect
ing the two incumbents to their re
spective positions last week; many
Stanford students said they felt en
tirely uneducated about the candi
dates in the local elections.
Nonetheless, Eshoo and Simit
ian both said that they have a
strong desire to tackle issues that
affect higher education and Stan

tackling such issues in their up
coming terms.
Simitian chairs the budget sub
committee on education finance,

loans and legislation that would
allow students to write off more
interest on those loans.

said. "If anything, there should be

more, so that more people in our
country have the opportunity to
get a new education."
She added, "The economy,
the economy, the economy. Once
you're prepared to go out into the
real world and the private sector,
what kind of world will be there?
Will they be able to write off in
terest on student loans? I have a
bill on that â€” I think it's very im
portant for both undergraduate

and graduate students.
"If someone wants to go into
education, they are si ill burdened
from the student loans and not al
lowed to write that interest off on
the debt."
Ultimately, Stanford and its vot
