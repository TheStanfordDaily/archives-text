## 
### NATALYA SHNITSER 
Yesterday, on the afternoon of
Veterans Day, members of the
Pilipino-American Student Union
gathered in White Plaza to raise
awareness about Filipino World
War 11 veterans who have been de
nied benefits by the U.S. govern
ment and to circulate a petition call
ing for Congress to reintroduce the
Veterans' Equity Bill.
Chanting slogans such as "What
do we want? Justice for veterans,"
members of PASU said that they
wanted to make Stanford students
aware of the 12,000 Filipino-Ameri
can veterans in the United States
and the 85,000 Filipino veterans in
the Philippines who are still waiting
to receive U.S. government benefits.
In 1944, after 100,000 Filipinos
were drafted by the United States to
light in World War 11, the U.S.
Congress passed the GI Bill of
Rights to provide full benefits to all
those who served, irrespective of

race, color or nationality. I lowever,
in 1946, when (he Philippines
gained its independence, (longress
passed the Rescission Act, by which
Filipino veterans were deemed in
eligible for all U.S. veteran benefits
except for certain service-connect
ed disability and death benefits.
PASU members asserted (hat, al
though in 1990 the Immigration
and Nationality act did grant U.S.
citizenship to Filipino veterans,
those veterans, now in their late 70s
and 80s, are still not receiving the
benefits that all other veterans have
been receiving for the past 50 years.
According to PASU member
Marlene Dominguez, a sopho
more, one of the organizers of the
event, Filipino veterans receive
about $500,000 total per year for
the more than 46,000 veterans.
As part of their eflorts, the orga
nizers circulated a petition carrying
the slogan "They fought. They
Died. You Promise. You lied"
across the top, demanding that the
Veteran's Equity Bill be reintro
duced and passed during the 108 th
Congress.
By the end of the day, they had
collected almost 200 signatures, in
cluding signatures previously col
lected online and 100 collected yes
terday at the rally. Organizers said
they would continue to collect sig
natures until Nov. 22.
Those stopping to sign the peti
tion agreed that the United States
was not being just.

"The Filipino soldiers fought
under the American flag, and they
were promised benefits," said
sophomore Nicole Araneta. "They
may not be U.S. citizens, but people
should keep their promises."
A senior who declined to give
his name said, "/Ml too often, the
U.S. military goes in and takes ad
vantage of resources — human
and military — and exploits them
in a such a way that the country is
left worse off resource-wise, if not
also politically."
Urging Stanford students to
sign the petition and get involved in
the cause, Dominguez said, "Each
time a veteran dies without realiz
ing the dream of dignity, injustice is
ignored."
