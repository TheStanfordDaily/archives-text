Coder's invitational contest. The programming company's contest calls
upon contestants to solve computer science-related problems in a limit
ed amount of time.
"There will be four semifinal rounds with four contestants in each,
and the four winners will advance to the finals," Wright said.
"This year's invitational contest will be in Connecticut at the Mohegan
Sun Casino," Wright said. "I can't speak for the other competitors, but I
think the best preparation is simple practice — doing as many sample
contests as time allows."
If Wright becomes the tournament champion, he will win $50,000.
"I think different people compete for different reasons, but the three
main ones are money, employer recognition and peer recognition,"
Wright said. "I think all three affected me, though to he honest, at the
moment, money is the primary factor driving me to compete."
Diabetes research foundation launches new center
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Invitational is launching a
$ 1.4 million center at Stanford. A nonprofit and nongovernmental funder
of diabetes research, JDRF funds research on Type 1 Diabetes.
"Researchers are closing in on finding a cure for juvenile diabetes, and
progress here could help scientists find a cure for other autoimmune dis
eases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus," according to a fact sheet pro
vided byJDRF's Karen Arthur. "JDRF has three major'cure' goals: restor
ing normal blood sugar, preventing and reversing diabetes-related com
plications, and preventing diabetes and its recurrence."
A lean and efficient organization, J I )RF received an "A" rating, "the only
such rating for any national diabetes organization" by the American Insti
tute of Philanthropy. Volunteers who support the organization are re
sponsible for much of the guidance to its operations, according to Arthur.
