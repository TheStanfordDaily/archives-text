"The quarterback sends the
football long .. . The wide receiver
catches the ball and cuts upiiehl . .
. It looks like he's going all the way
... Touchdown!"
The commentary makes it seem
like you're in the stands, right be
hind the Stanford Band, but
you're actually enjoying the foot
ball game 112 rom the comfort of your
own room: You're listening to
KZSU's sports coverage from your
radio.
90.1 FM KZSU, Stanford's
radio station, plays music, broad

casts campus events, sponsors call
in talk shows and covers Stanford
sports. According to its Web site,
the station's 500-watt signal reach
es almost all of the Hay Area, the
same area reached by the 50,000-
watt signals of many commercial
stations.
KZSU offers both radio cover
age and online streaming media to
reach a wider audience. On the
radio, the sports division broad
casts football, women's volleyball,
men's basketball, women's basket
ball and baseball live.
The online streaming media,
which allows people to listen to the
radio through the Internet, covers
men's soccer, women's soccer and
Softball. The online show acts as a
second radio station.
In addition to live broadcasts,
KZSU produces Sports Zoo, a
sports talk show which currently

airs Fridays from (i p.m. to 0:45
p.m.
KZSU sports is staffed by 19 stu
dents, 12 of whom work as broad
casters. Working at KZSU, though
rewarding, can also be exhausting.
According to KZSU Sports Di
rector and Sports Zoo host junior
Adam Kapp, the job of a broad
caster can be difficult. Often,
broadcasters are on the road to
cover teams playing away games.
"In the past, we have traveled
with teams on their flights and
stayed in hotels with them, essen
tially becoming part of the travel
ing party," Rappsaid. "The Athlet
ic Department handles logistics,
but we pay the bills."
In addition to making a time
commitment, broadcasters under
go training, most of which hap
pens on the job.
"Training comes in the form of

becoming comfortable on-air
through our shows and such,"
Rapp said. "There is selection of
broadcasters tor t he following year
each spring among the sports di
rectors based on the amount of
work put in throughout the year."
According to Rapp, Stanford
students who worked for K.ZSU
have gotten positions at ESPN and
other television and radio stations
after graduation.
Publicity Director Nari Mann
said that KZSU's sports coverage is
so good that it is nearly impossible
not to appreciate it.
"Sweet sassy molassy, even our
sports announcers are great at
what they do," Nari said. "They
sound so professional that, at an
away game once, the nearby crew
from t lie opponent's college radio
station paid more attention to our
announcing than their own."
