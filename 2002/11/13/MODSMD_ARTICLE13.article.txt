## Netanyahu wants to expel Arafat 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Foreign Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that
if he's elected prime minister, his top pri
ority would be to force Yasser Aralat into
exile. But the country's current leader said

Israel should not "act in haste."
Netanyahu's remarks, which drew
cheers at the Likud party convention
yesterday night, put him at odds with his
boss, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who

has sought to marginalize Arafat but has
not made any public statements about
driving him out.
Instead, Sharon told the convention
in a speech that immediately followed
Netanyahu's remarks that Israel
shouldn't move too last on expelling the
Palestinian leader.
Without specifying any steps he might
take against Arafat, he pledged to wage an
unrelenting batde against Palestinian mili
tants, and predicted the effort could lead to
a more moderate Palestinian leadership.
"The blows that are raining on the
head of terror (groups) might lead to a
historic change in which Palestinian so
ciety . . . might remove the government
of terror that oppresses it, and go with
us toward a (peace) process," he said.
Netanyahu is challenging Sharon for
the party leadership in January elections
and has long called for Arafat's expulsion.
His remarks have taken on added signifi
cance since he joined Sharon's caretaker
government last week.
