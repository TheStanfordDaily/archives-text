# Tape sounds like bin Laden

WAS! UNGTON (AP) â€” The voice on
a new audiotape sounds like Osama bin
Laden, a U.S. official said yesterday as the
Bush administration tried to authenticate
what would be the first hard evidence in a
year tfiat the al-Qaida leader was still alive.
"Something of this import, we want to
be as sure as we can be," said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. "It
does sound like bin Laden's voice. We
have to complete the technical analysis."
The voice refers to several recent ter
rorist attacks, which means it was record
ed within the past few weeks. Communi
cations from bin Laden in the past year
have not carried such specific statements,
leaving officials to wonder if they were old
recordings.
I he attacks mentioned on the new tape
included last month's bombing of a night
club in Bali, Indonesia, that killed close to
200 people.
The voice also makes new threats.
"It is time we get even," the voice says,

according to a U.S. government transla
tion. "You will be killed just as you kill,
and will be bombed just as you bomb.
And expect more that will further dis
tress you."
The tape purporting to be of bin
Laden aired yesterday on Al-Jazeera, a
Qatar-based Arabic television network
that frequently receives statements from
al-Qaida leaders.
To authenticate the tape, U.S. intelli
gence officials are comparing it to known
recordings of bin Laden to determine if
the voiceprints match. The U.S. official
did not know when the technical analysis
on the tape would be finished.
For months, President Bush and other
administration officials have said they
didn't know whether bin Laden was dead
or alive. But operations to find him have
continued on the presumption he sur
vived the onslaught in Afghanistan.
"I don't know whether bin Laden is dead
or alive," Bush told reporters on Oct. 14.
