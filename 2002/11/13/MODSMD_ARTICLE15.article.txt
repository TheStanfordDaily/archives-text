Exchange Commission, and the

SEC's head accountant.

blame Pitt lor not informing fel
low SEC commissioners that Web

knowledged that the information

Bush appointee, resigned a week
ago over that.
Pitt, whose 15-month tenure
lias been marked by a series of po
litical missteps, has remained in of
fice pending President Bush's
naming a replacement to be con

firmed by the Senate.

dence in Webster's integrity, al
though the president also said he
wanted to see t he outcome of an in
vestigation of the circumstances
surrounding Webster's selection.
"Judge Webster is a fine man.
We wish him well and respect his
decision," White House spokes
woman Claire Buchan said yes
terday."The president believes
the oversight board has impor
tant work to do and he urges
them to pursue their work quick
ly and aggressively."
