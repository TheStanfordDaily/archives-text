## The
						Stanford Daily New early admissions policy adds flexibility 
### 
Published Since 1891

Applying to college was probably a
stressful time for most Stanford
students, especially those who
applied early decision and knew
that, if accepted, they had to come to Stan
ford. But thanks to the University's recent
announcement to do away with its binding
early admissions policy, prospective appli
cants will have greater flexibility, and the
Office of Undergraduate Admission will be
able to choose from a larger, more diverse
applicant pool.
Stanford currently admits about one
third of its freshman class through the early
decision process. According to a recent
Newsweek article, many high school se
niors feel they must apply early to a school
in order to ensure their chances of getting

into an elite institution, even if that means
they might not be ready to commit to going
to that school. Stanford's new policy should
ease the pressure for many high school se
niors. It will give students who are accept
ed early the relief of getting into Stanford
without the burden of being forced to
come here.
Those who get accepted early next year
will now have the freedom to evaluate the
University along with other schools. An
added bonus is that these students will be
able to assess their financial aid package
from Stanford and, if they're not satisfied,
hold out fora better offer from another
school. Now the students will have greater
control and more information when decid
ing what college they want to go to.

Critics of Stanford's new policy have
said that if institutions believe students are
"mature enough" to apply early, then it
seems hypocritical to tell the applicants
that they are not capable of making a
binding decision. Students should not be
forced into making a choice by the Nov. 1
early application deadline. So much can
happen in the six months between the fall
and the May 1 matriculation deadline.
Students may find another school with the
exact program they want, or they may de
cide the college they selected is too far
from home. It's not fair to lock students
into a decision, and the last thing anyone
— student or administrator — wants is an
unhappy freshman.
The policy should also attract a more di-

verse range of applicants to Stanford. Now
that students are not required to come, it's
likely that more students will apply early.
Last year's early decision pool increased by
10 percent over the previous year; this fig
ure will probably increase even more.
As we all know, the college application
process can be, at the very least, a trying ex
perience. But by giving students more flex
ibility, Stanford has taken the burden off of
many high school seniors and has in
creased the likelihood that more students
will apply. Admitted students still need to
weigh their options carefully — after all,
Stanford will consume the next four years
of their lives and their tuition money. This
new decision will help ensure the best fit for
everyone.
