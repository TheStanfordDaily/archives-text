## Bad things, good people 
### 
Watching Eminem's new movie,
"8 Mile," we could almost hear
the director telling him during
filming, "Now I want you to
imagine that you're trailer trash ..Before
the movie, excitement was running high.
Suburban gangsters practiced their adopt
ed slang, and a group of 15-year-old girls
were overheard till king about losing their
cell phones at last year's Exotic Erotic. Prac
tically no one in line was over 25. America's
youth couldn't wait to see the newest incar
nation of the talented but down-on-his
luck-hero-confronts-his-personal-demons-
and-goes-on-to-wealth-and-fame story.
Twenty-five years ago, our parents

flocked to see "Rocky."
The posters for "Rocky,"
marketed in the same way
as "8 Mile," said "His
whole life was a million to
one shot." Now we were
getting to see the 21 st cen
tury's Rocky, a rapper
from Detroit. The movies
were the same right down
to the second-rate cities

they were set in (apologies to those of you
from Philly or Motown).
Only — and if you haven't seen "8 Mile"
you may not want to read on — it does not
end quite the same way "Rocky" does. Of
course, Eminem comes out on top. But he
doesn't get the girl. He doesn't get rich. And
he doesn't get out of the trailer park. 'Hie
movie ends with him heading back to the
stamping plant to work the graveyard shift
for some extra cash.
At first, we were left feeling vaguely un
settled. The hero won. He embarrassed his
nemesis, and the whole crowd loved him.
But nothing changed. Then it hits: This
movie is actually like real life. You see, in
real life, g<x>d things don't often happen
through revolution. They happen through
evolution. Sure, people win the lottery, but
the rags-to-riches stories we are brought up
on are American fairy tides. Most of the time
when good things happen to us, it is be
cause our hours of preparation have been
defined positively in a moment of trial, and
even then upward mobility is gradual.
For those of us who are seniors, this has
never seemed so true. Graduation is not
something that is just going to "happen" to
us. It will be the culmination of four years
of work. It will mark a dramatic change in
our lives, but it has been built on the ad
vantages that we have at Stanford. And let's
face it, unlike the classes that came before
us, the bubble has burst, so it isn't like those
advantages translate into stock options and
signing bonuses anymore.
Unfortunately, recent events have
brought to light how tragically things can
work in the opposite way. C»(X)d things
don't usually happen suddenly and with
out warning, but when things do happen
that way, they are usually bad. For the sec
ond time in less than two years, a friend of
the Stanford undergraduate community

has ended up in a hospital through a freak
accident. For those involved, it begs the
question, why is it that the normal course of
events is interrupted by tragedy so much
more often than dumb luck? Why isn't a
life saved for every one ruined?
For those eternal optimists who want to
say that we are wrong, that life-changing
good fortune occurs as often as tragedy of
the same degree — just consider the con
notation of the word "accident." It techni
cally refers to an event that one did not in
tend to happen. In its daily usage though,
it is virtually always a negative thing. No
one says,"I had an accident," when they
find $20 lying on the ground. When we say
that we did something "by accident," we
usually mean that we made a mistake.
The difficulty with American culture is
that we are brought up to believe that
good things just happen to good people.
Hollywood and the media have elevated
being in the right spot at the right time to
an art form. We are obsessed with the rad
ically new, and we have the collective
memory of goldfish. Each time around the
bowl is new. We eat up the rags-to-riches
stories because they are the essence of the
American Dream.
What binds us with the rest of humani
ty is the lesson that no matter how hard we
try to convince ourselves that it isn't so;
American exceptionalism at the individual
level is meaningless. On the grand scale,
we saw this on Sept. 11, 2001, when our
safety bubble was shattered in New York.
As Stanford students, we saw it in March
2001 when then-sophomore BriannaGer
mer passed away, and with another inci
dent only a few weeks ago, and again every
time a member of the Stanford family is in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
American culture has been deeply influ
ence by the Christian tradition, so it is diffi
cult for us to relate these challenges to a
greater good, even in a non-religious sense,
into our conception of life. The answer isn't
necessarily anything that reflects badly on
human nature. It just doesn't give us as clear
a picture as we would like. Most people act
in their own self-interest and in the interest
of those that they consider part of their
greater identity, and there isn't anything
wrong with that. But in doing so, it's rare
that we unintentionally lift up those that we
don't know and who offer us no advantage.
The dark alter-ego of American individ
ualism is humanity's interdependence.
The tragedy of the human condition is that
the power to destroy is much more easily
and unintentionally used than the power
to exalt. As Stanford students and young
Americans, this is a harsh lesson to learn,
and a sad one to learn at the expense of
those that we love.
