Students 'need to worr/ about
University alcohol problems
This past Friday's editorial, "Stanford
should try new strategies for alcohol safety"
(Nov. 8) shifts in a significant way the cur
rent campus dialogue about undergradu
ate alcohol consumption. The shift oc
curred when the editorial stated, "Given
the increased severity of recent alcohol-re
lated incidents, we expect the University to
take measures to implement a safer cam
pus." This is a welcome realism.
Thankfully, we are leaving the early days
of the dialogue where there was too much
blame-casting, much of it directed at the stu
dent affairs administration. I thought this
early dialogue was going nowhere, especial
ly when it was asserted, in campus talk, that
the University had it in for fraternities and
in one Daily letter, that the administration
lacked respect for students. The Universi
ty's vendetta against fraternities is our ver
sion of an urban legend. It will live as long
as there is a Stanford. And, no university
that I know engages student opinion as fully
as Stanford. At the same time, moments
come in every university's history where
boundaries on student behavior have to be
discussed.
This is one of those moments. In fact,
we have been heading for this particular
moment for some time. As a resident fel
low in Branner who has listened to the tra
vails of residence staffs from other houses,
and as a witness to many weekend nights
on Escondido Road, I thought recently we
were losing ground in the struggle with al
cohol consumption.
Fora lew years now, I had the sense that
as the weekend approached, residence
stalls, the police, the residential deans and
many students held theirbreath and hoped
for gcxxl outcomes. Late on Monday, after
all the reports had come in, we could half

exhale, proclaiming the weekend a time of
fun. Still, there had always been incidents
that were nearly dangerous.
From this recent experience, 1 ob
served two differing phenomena. First, I
saw an increase among some students in
what I would call "radical drinking" —
drinking that endangered a person's
health and just as often, generated some
kind of social disruption, i.e., destruction
of property or senseless belligerence.
Second, the idea of "responsible drink
ing" became increasingly the cover for
"radical drinking." While many stu
dents practice "responsible drinking,"
too often 1 heard the idea invoked to ex
plain away really egregious alcohol inci
dents. As a result, our threshold of bad
behavior generated by alcohol was get
ting higher and higher all the time.
While more bad things were happening,
less was shocking.
Having said this, 1 should hasten to add
that the problem of alcohol misuse or abuse
should not be laid at the fraternities' feet. In
fact, I think party alcohol in residences with
large numbers of underage people needs
to be looked at, especially the student af
fairs' registration of parties process, which I
believe to be a smoke-and-mirrors affair.
Which leads me back to Friday's edito
rial: It made four recommendations for
"new, creative approaches to the alcohol
policy." Three of them implied more work
for RFsand RAs. Let's not transfer owner
ship of this problem solely to the houses
and their already-overworked staffs.
Ownership of the problem should be
shared. We need to build a mainstream
coalition that will reinvigorate the "re
sponsible drinking" notion.
In that vein, 1 did not see in Friday's ed
itorial a message urging students to help.
More students need to worry about this,
too. The University needs students to think

about how misuse and abuse of alcohol
might drag us all down, slowly but surely.
For Stanford's sake, we know we can and
should do better on this issue.

Berkeley student encourages Stanford a
cappella groups to participate in 'Big Sing'
I would like to express my disappoint
ment in the Stanford a cappella groups that
are choosing not to participate in this year's
"Big Sing" at Cal.
1 he traditional (and fundamentally
harmless) rivalry that accompanies the
Big Game each year is based on a mu
tual respect and an acknowledgment
that both schools fall in the top rank
ings ol public and private universities
worldwide.
While the rivalry can be demonstrat
ed negatively in some tradition or athlet
ic-related rallies, the annual "sing off' is
a chance to express our spirit and pride
while sharing our mutual gifts and hard
work. Both schools have diverse and
well-respected a cappella groups and
should take advantage of every opportu
nity to share performances.
The audience is expected to cheer and
hiss at this event with the implied under
standing that while the performance is
laudable, school loyalty must be expressed
and no hard feelings or resentment
should result.
I strongly urge the abstaining groups to
reconsider, and I hope we can share anoth
er lively and spirited Big Sing with full par
ticipation by lK>th schools.

all the reports had come in, we could half

exhale, proclaiming the weekend a time of
fun. Still, there had always been incidents
that were nearly dangerous.
From this recent experience, 1 ob
served two differing phenomena. First, I
saw an increase among some students in
what I would call "radical drinking" —
drinking that endangered a person's
health and just as often, generated some
kind of social disruption, i.e., destruction
of property or senseless belligerence.
Second, the idea of "responsible drink
ing" became increasingly the cover for
"radical drinking." While many stu
dents practice "responsible drinking,"
too often 1 heard the idea invoked to ex
plain away really egregious alcohol inci

behavior generated by alcohol was get
ting higher and higher all the time.
While more bad things were happening,
less was shocking.
Having said this, 1 should hasten to add
that the problem of alcohol misuse or abuse
should not be laid at the fraternities' feet. In
fact, I think party alcohol in residences with
large numbers of underage people needs
to be looked at, especially the student af
fairs' registration of parties process, which I
believe to be a smoke-and-mirrors affair.
Which leads me back to Friday's edito
rial: It made four recommendations for
"new, creative approaches to the alcohol
policy." Three of them implied more work
for RFsand RAs. Let's not transfer owner
ship of this problem solely to the houses
and their already-overworked staffs.
Ownership of the problem should be
shared. We need to build a mainstream
coalition that will reinvigorate the "re
sponsible drinking" notion.
In that vein, 1 did not see in Friday's ed
itorial a message urging students to help.
More students need to worry about this,
too. The University needs students to think

about how misuse and abuse of alcohol
might drag us all down, slowly but surely.
For Stanford's sake, we know we can and
should do better on this issue.

Berkeley student encourages Stanford a
cappella groups to participate in 'Big Sing'
I would like to express my disappoint
ment in the Stanford a cappella groups that
are choosing not to participate in this year's
"Big Sing" at Cal.
1 he traditional (and fundamentally
harmless) rivalry that accompanies the
Big Game each year is based on a mu
tual respect and an acknowledgment
that both schools fall in the top rank
ings ol public and private universities
worldwide.
While the rivalry can be demonstrat
ed negatively in some tradition or athlet
ic-related rallies, the annual "sing off' is
a chance to express our spirit and pride
while sharing our mutual gifts and hard
work. Both schools have diverse and
well-respected a cappella groups and
should take advantage of every opportu
nity to share performances.
The audience is expected to cheer and
hiss at this event with the implied under
standing that while the performance is
laudable, school loyalty must be expressed
and no hard feelings or resentment
should result.
I strongly urge the abstaining groups to
reconsider, and I hope we can share anoth
er lively and spirited Big Sing with full par
ticipation by lK>th schools.

Students 'need to worr/ about
University alcohol problems
This past Friday's editorial, "Stanford
should try new strategies for alcohol safety"
(Nov. 8) shifts in a significant way the cur
rent campus dialogue about undergradu
ate alcohol consumption. The shift oc
curred when the editorial stated, "Given
the increased severity of recent alcohol-re
lated incidents, we expect the University to
take measures to implement a safer cam
pus." This is a welcome realism.
Thankfully, we are leaving the early days
of the dialogue where there was too much
blame-casting, much of it directed at the stu
dent affairs administration. I thought this
early dialogue was going nowhere, especial
ly when it was asserted, in campus talk, that
the University had it in for fraternities and
in one Daily letter, that the administration
lacked respect for students. The Universi
ty's vendetta against fraternities is our ver
sion of an urban legend. It will live as long
as there is a Stanford. And, no university
that I know engages student opinion as fully
as Stanford. At the same time, moments
come in every university's history where
boundaries on student behavior have to be
discussed.
This is one of those moments. In fact,
we have been heading for this particular
moment for some time. As a resident fel
low in Branner who has listened to the tra
vails of residence staffs from other houses,
and as a witness to many weekend nights
on Escondido Road, I thought recently we
were losing ground in the struggle with al
cohol consumption.
Fora lew years now, I had the sense that
as the weekend approached, residence
stalls, the police, the residential deans and
many students held theirbreath and hoped
for gcxxl outcomes. Late on Monday, after
all the reports had come in, we could half

exhale, proclaiming the weekend a time of
fun. Still, there had always been incidents
that were nearly dangerous.
