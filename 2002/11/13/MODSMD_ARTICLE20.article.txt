## ESPN vows to step up its CWS coverage 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For fans of the College World
Series — and there should be plen
ty of t hem on the Stanford campus
with the Cardinal advancing to
Omaha the last four years —June
just got even better. According to a
report by reputed college baseball
guru John Manuel of Baseball
America, the NCAA has come to an
agreement with ESPN to broadcast
the Super Regional round of the
NC AA postseason in addition to its
full coverage of the CWS next June.
"I don't know that college base
ball can become a 'mainstream'
sport, but getting on national TV
is an important development to
ward that ever happening,"
Manuel told The Daily in an ex
clusive interview.
"Some teams are just happy to
get to Omaha — see San Jose Suite
2000 — but the struggle to get
there, played out in front of home
fans on campus ballparks in the
Super Regional round, makes this
the most attractive round to put on
TV," he said.
Manuel also said coaches have
already widely accepted the devel
opment as a great opportunity for
fans to see college baseball as it is
normally played, something dif
ferent than the huge stage of
Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha.

With every game of the eight
three-game Super Regionals set
for television — two per day on
ESPN and ESPN2, with some syn
dicated locally — fans will get a
heavy dose of the storylines that
make the CWS such a fantastic
event a week earlier than usual.
"I think it will help build the
story for the CWS, giving fans an
extra week of exposure to teams
and the players," Manuel said.
"College baseball has built-in brand
identity through the colleges them
selves, and now there's an extra
week for the players and teams to
get some national exposure."
Manuel emphasized that
ESPN, which holds broadcast
rights to every game of the CWS
beginning this season, was the
major player in making the deal
work for both parties.
"It's more than I expected,"
Dennis Poppe, the NCAA's direc
tor of baseball and football opera
tions, told Baseball America.
"ESPN has really stepped up to the
plate. It's their baby now, and I'm
impressed. They get it. They like
having the whole thing."

Chris Lewis, both freshmen, led
