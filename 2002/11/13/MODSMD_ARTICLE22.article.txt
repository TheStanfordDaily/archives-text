You could argue that last
night's exhibition game was em
blematic of a bigger struggle.

Men's Basketball
Yesterday: Stanford 84, Olympic Club 67

You might say that in hosting
an Olympic Club team led by Car
dinal alum Chris VVeems (the sec
ond-leading scorer from the 1997-
1998 Final Four squad) that the
unranked Stanford men's basket
ball team was forced once again to
confront its prestigious past.
Maybe the game was a sym
bolic gesture to the history of
the program — an acknowledg
ment of past greatness coupled
with a youthful exertion of liber
ation from that expectation
laden tradition.
Or then again, maybe it was just
a meaningless exhibition game
against a local club team. Who
knows?
Among other things, the exhibi
tion game reiterated head coach
Mike Montgomery's pregame as
sertion that the Cardinal would ex
perience "some growing pains
[this season]."
"1 think [the game] was a little
bit what I expected — a lot of mis
takes," Montgomery said. "I think
with this team being as young as it
is, we're going to have to learn in
games. Hopefully we got a little of
the nervousness out of our system
tonight."
Although Stanford walked

away with an 84-67 victory over
the Olympic Club, the match had
all of the things that one would ex
pect from a preseason exhibition
game: miscues, nervousness and

spurts of offensive productivity fol
lowed by turnovers.
It was definitely messy at times.
Stanford finished the game with
17 turnovers (10 of which came in

the first half) and had a lot of trou
ble getting the ball inside.
"We've got some things to
work on," said freshman point
guard Jason Haas, who played
15 minutes off the bench, record
ing three assists and zero
turnovers in his first collegiate
appearance. "We did some good
things. We did some bad things.
We know what we have to work
on in practice."
The exhibition game also
proved that handling the full
court press is still an issue for the
Cardinal — even against an oppo
nent that was far less athletic than
any team it will face this season.
But, aside from all that, there
were glimmers of hope as well.
There was the spectacular scor
ing performance by senior guard
Julius Barnes. He finished the
game with 27 points, five assists
and one blocked shot.
Also, there was the much-im
proved all-around game of junior
forward Justin Davis. He scored 14
points and grabbed 10 boards (five
of which were on the offensive
end). Furthermore, he perhaps
took the first step in proving that
he can be a viable offensive option
and a leader for this team down
the road.
On the defensive end, sopho
more wingman Josh Childress was
extremely active, finishing with
eight points and two steals despite
missing the last few days of practice
with a slight injury. In addition,
fellow sophomore, center Rob Lit
tle, made his presence felt on the
inside, finishing with nine points
and three offensive boards.
Stanford will return to action on
Monday at Maples Pavilion against
Boston University in what will be
the first game of the Owens Corn
ing Preseason NIT.
