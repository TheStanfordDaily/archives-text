### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman sailor Brian Haines wowed coach
es and spectators alike in October by earning a
berth in last weekend's prestigious Intercolle
giate Sailing Association's Singlehanded Men's
Championship hosted by Rice at the Houston
Yacht Club. There, Haines was at it once again,
taking seventh in the regatta and proving his
skills in a pack of 16 competitive sailors from
around the country.
A month ago, Haines placed second in the
Pacific Coast Championships to qualify for last

weekend's event, and he was looking forward
to the competition.
"I'm excited about going back to Houston,"
he said, noting that his focus over the upcoming
weeks should improve his physical condition
and sailing in the laser as much as possible.
To some extent, Haines' hard work paid off,
resulting in what his coach Jay kehoe called
"some phenomenal races." However, Kehoe
also mentioned that "three bad races added (he
30 points to his score that made the difference
between fourth place and seventh place."
In the end, another freshman, Alexander
Kirkland of Tufts, took fourth. The winner of

the October PCCs, Hawaii sophomore Brian
Lake, again outdid Haines, placing fifth at the
national event.
Young talent was a running theme through
out the top four, which consisted of three fresh
men, including Georgetown's Andrew Camp
bell, who won the regatta.
Wind conditions that varied anywhere from
eight to 18 knots and a highly skilled field —
Kirkland and Campbell are both Olympic
hopefuls — made lor close races and an em
phasis on maneuverability. Representing the
Cardinal, Haines was particularly
successful sailing upwind, even
managing to keep up with the top
four. However, a few key mistakes
ultimately landed him in seventh.
Kehoe believes the competitive
nature of the Singlehanded Men's
Championship will only increase
over time, as possible future

Olympians like Kirkland and
Campbell continue improve.
"Haines will always have [them]
to contend with at this and other
events," he said.
Up ahead for Stanford is the
North / South Regatta — also
called the Fall Championship —
which will be held in Santa Bar
bara on Nov. 16 and Nov. 17. Both
the rankings and scheduling for
spring season hinge on the Cardi
nal's performance in this key re
gatta.
