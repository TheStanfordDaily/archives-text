# Tough weekend for Babin
## 
### 
I awoke yesterday morning eagerly
anticipating another letter from
Cool Rubin, a new tale of some
ridiculous (eat of athletic and di
gestive endurance that would surpass
everything I could possibly imagine.
Unfortunately, when I finally got out
of bed, all I found on my floor was a half
finished problem set and an open eco
nomics book, the pages still wet with
tears from the night before.

Why the tears, you
ask? Why? Because i(
was a weekend of
sports that hurt just
that much.
It started with all
that rain last Friday
night, which did not
really influence the
world of collegiate

sports but certainly made it a lot harder
to walk to parties. But I digress . . .
Saturday afternoon, there was a
chance for Operation Cardinal to break
back into the win column 011 the spoiled
children from down south. This was all
set to be a classic game for the under
dogs. We had beaten USC every year
I've been at this school. They don't like
us; we don't like them. The weather
looked like it could help shut down
their passing game and even the play
ing field.
Right. A few hours later, the only
sound coming out of the Operation
Cardinal camp was the lonely sound of
bugle playing " laps" on a cold, rainy
night.
But I was willing to get over that. I
was willing to accept the facts that our
team is young, that USC is actually

good, that it wasn't our game. I was will
ing to find solace in the fact that the I'ac
-10 does not take its rules from Euro
pean soccer, and even though we may
be free-falling to the bottom of the con
ference, we will not be relegated to the
Mountain West Conference next year.
But it wouldn't have hurt as much,
you see, if 1 didn't see good old Troy
Walters playing for the Colts on Sun
day. I was suddenly nostalgic of mo
ments in my freshman year, that Rose
Bowl season. The game plan back then
was simple.
"OK, here's the play. Troy, get open.
Catch the ball. Run for the score."
And lie would! The 5-foot-6 wonder
would sky d-backs around the confer
ence on 60-yard bombs. He would take
screens out of the backfield and leave
linebackers wondering where they had
lost their jockstraps trying to tackle
Mini-Me.
I caught myself telling freshmen
around me tales of "back in the day"
when the football team was good, when
we went to the Rose Bowl, when no fra
ternities were on probation, when the
Band Run was actually a"run," when
the lake was filled with bonfires in the
fall and water in the spring.
"Well, whose fault is it that that's all
gone now?" they asked.
I didn't answer that part of the
question.
Anyway, I was happy for Troy that his
team pulled it off on Sunday in that big
win over Philly. But my happiness soon
faded, because my team, the Broncos,
did NO T pull it off on Monday night.

Understand that 1 was riding
high on the Broncos wave going
into this game. 1 had won two cases
of beer in their last game and felt
confident enough in the team not
only to make a bet with our chef
(our chef!) on t his one, but to talk a
lot of smack about it, too.
About how rim Brown and

Jerry Rice are old and slow and
our linebackers move faster than
(hat sketchy guy at the parties
Sigma Chi used to have, "back in
the day." About how Rich "Boom-
Boom" Gannon was falling apart.
About how the altitude would
make the Raiders play even older
than they actually are.
And then the Raiders went out
and put me to shame. They abused
(he Broncos, scoring on their first
five possessions and one ofours. We
looked old and slow. Brian Griese,

who has more problems with alco
hol than any fraternity on this cam
pus, couldn't make a throw to save
his life, while Gannon missed only
one pass in the first half.
And yon know what hurt the
most? The Broncos lost this game
on national television on arguably
the most important Monday night
telecast ever.
I'm not talking about the fact
that this was the 500 th game on
Monday Night Football.
Even more important than that.

. . it was Melissa Stark's birthday.
So thanks a lot, Raiders, for
driving the final nail into the
sports coffin that was this week
end. Oh, and for making me cook
dinner for our entire house next
week.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in eco
nomics who really hopes that Narnia's
chef doesn't make him cook for the
house. To find oat what's on the menu,
