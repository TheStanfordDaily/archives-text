# Tough weekend for Babin
## 
### 
I awoke yesterday morning eagerly
anticipating another letter from
Cool Rubin, a new tale of some
ridiculous (eat of athletic and di
gestive endurance that would surpass
everything I could possibly imagine.
Unfortunately, when I finally got out
of bed, all I found on my floor was a half
finished problem set and an open eco
nomics book, the pages still wet with
tears from the night before.

Why the tears, you
ask? Why? Because i(
was a weekend of
sports that hurt just
that much.
It started with all
that rain last Friday
night, which did not
really influence the
world of collegiate

sports but certainly made it a lot harder
to walk to parties. But I digress . . .
Saturday afternoon, there was a
chance for Operation Cardinal to break
back into the win column 011 the spoiled
children from down south. This was all
set to be a classic game for the under
dogs. We had beaten USC every year
I've been at this school. They don't like
us; we don't like them. The weather
looked like it could help shut down
their passing game and even the play
ing field.
Right. A few hours later, the only
sound coming out of the Operation
Cardinal camp was the lonely sound of
bugle playing " laps" on a cold, rainy
night.
But I was willing to get over that. I
was willing to accept the facts that our
team is young, that USC is actually

good, that it wasn't our game. I was will
ing to find solace in the fact that the I'ac
-10 does not take its rules from Euro
pean soccer, and even though we may
be free-falling to the bottom of the con
ference, we will not be relegated to the
Mountain West Conference next year.
But it wouldn't have hurt as much,
you see, if 1 didn't see good old Troy
Walters playing for the Colts on Sun
day. I was suddenly nostalgic of mo
ments in my freshman year, that Rose
Bowl season. The game plan back then
was simple.
"OK, here's the play. Troy, get open.
Catch the ball. Run for the score."
And lie would! The 5-foot-6 wonder
would sky d-backs around the confer
ence on 60-yard bombs. He would take
screens out of the backfield and leave
linebackers wondering where they had
lost their jockstraps trying to tackle
Mini-Me.
I caught myself telling freshmen
around me tales of "back in the day"
when the football team was good, when
we went to the Rose Bowl, when no fra
ternities were on probation, when the
Band Run was actually a"run," when
the lake was filled with bonfires in the
fall and water in the spring.
"Well, whose fault is it that that's all
gone now?" they asked.
I didn't answer that part of the
question.
Anyway, I was happy for Troy that his
team pulled it off on Sunday in that big
win over Philly. But my happiness soon
faded, because my team, the Broncos,
did NO T pull it off on Monday night.
