## Med students benefit from PDA technology 
### DEBBIE HONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Incoming Stanford freshmen
are often surprised to find that
nearly everything they need to do
for school is computerized and on
line. Class sign-ups, report cards,
class announcements, library re
newals and many lecture notes are
managed with the aid of technolo
gy. Many students suffer from
hourly e-mail addiction and be
come frustrated with 56K
modems when they return home
for vacations. What more could
the University do to meld com
pletely with technology at all times
of the day?
Three years ago, the School of
Medicine took up this challenge
with its personal digital assistant
program. The goal of the program
is to eventually have a PDA, such as
a Palm Pilot or a Handspring
Visor, in the lab coat pocket of
every Medical School student. The
program was initiated in the 1999-
2000 school year by medical stu

dents Scott Rush and Shannon
Moffett with the aid ofTodd Grap
pone, the head of Information
Technology at Lane Medical Li
brary.
"I would see these poor med
students carrying around heavy
reference books in their lab coat
pockets and continually look up
the same kind of information, and
they were on their feet all day. To
me, PDAs and med students just
made sense," Moffett said.
Rush and Moffett formed the
"Palm Project" and spent the rest
of the year convincing administra
tors at the Medical School about
the benefits of such a program.
T heir efforts were rewarded when
Lane Medical Library decided to
sponsor a pilot program.
In the (all of 2000, all 240 pre
clinical students found themselves
with new Palm Vx handhelds.
I hese devices contained a drug
database reference, and the Palm
Project worked on making flash

cards with pathology concepts and
images of electron micrographs,
X-rays and computer tomography
scans. In addition, many class in
structors made PDA versions of
their syllabi, course calendars and
important handouts.
Surveys of these former pre
clinical students indicated that
over 70 percent used PDAs at least
once a day in their clinics.
"We had an extremely positive
response to the program," MofFett
said.
The next academic year marked
the first year in which the Medical
School recommended PDAs to all
incoming students. The school sub
sidized a large part of the cost â€” 90
percent of the incoming students
bought the Palm msoo's with a 60
percent discount. This year, the
Palm Project recommended Sony
Clie's (with a cost of approximately
$200) to incoming students in an at
tempt to maximize both affordabil
ity and quality.
The Palm Project is expanding
from its origins as a student-run
group. Henry Lowe, the new dean
of Information Resources Technol
ogy, established an Office of Mobile
Computing this year. Grappone,
the new associate director of the Of

fice of Mobile Computing, said,
" The School of Medicine is really
trying to work with the rest of (lie
University to make this project a
University-wide program."
What is making the PI)As such a
hit is the wireless technology.
" The University is really trying
to switch to wireless computing ...
the switch ... will have as big of an
impact as the introduction of the
Internet," Grappone said.
Stanford undergraduates who
have taken Econ 1 or the Physics
50 series should be familiar with
the infrared "Personal Response
System" devices which professors
use to poll, quiz and take atten
dance of their students in class.
The PDAs at the Medical School
have the same capability, and the
Palm Project is working to estab
lish similar programs with high re
liability and speed. A pilot pro
gram of interactive classroom
teaching was run this past summer
in a histology course.
"The advantage of a hand-held
would be much faster and more
reliable data entry," said Physics
Nobel Laureate Douglas Osheroff.
"With PRS, the IR data string is
100 milliseconds long, and while
that is coming in, a transmitter
cannot accept another string. It
thus takes quite some time for
every student to get his/her re
sponse tallied. The students need
to look up on the screen to see

their transmitter number posted."
Both systems, however, require
installation of specialized receivers
in classrooms.
While FDA technology has im
proved immensely in the last cou
ple years, PDAs still have a way to
go before catching up to laptops.
"The biggest problems with
PDAs right now are their slow data
entry, which doesn't matter much
so far because med students use
PDAs more for data retrieval [i.e.,
looking up reference material] than
data entry, and their lack of securi
ty," Moffett said. "People can't enter
confidential patient information
into their PDAs yet because the tech
nology is not there yet."
However, advances in PDA tech
nology are extremely likely due to
the popularity of PDAs in major
corporations, health care organiza
tions, educational institutions and
the government. In the last few
years, PDAs have doubled in their
internal RAM capacity, and the de
velopment of expansion slots and
cards has increased their versatility
by a considerable amount.
The success of the PDA pro
gram could lead to its extention to
the rest of the University.
"The University as a whole
could in the long run save a lot of
money, time and paper if each and
every student at Stanford had a
Palm in his or her hands," Crap
pone noted.
