## Med students benefit from PDA technology 
### DEBBIE HONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Incoming Stanford freshmen
are often surprised to find that
nearly everything they need to do
for school is computerized and on
line. Class sign-ups, report cards,
class announcements, library re
newals and many lecture notes are
managed with the aid of technolo
gy. Many students suffer from
hourly e-mail addiction and be
come frustrated with 56K
modems when they return home
for vacations. What more could
the University do to meld com
pletely with technology at all times
of the day?
Three years ago, the School of
Medicine took up this challenge
with its personal digital assistant
program. The goal of the program
is to eventually have a PDA, such as
a Palm Pilot or a Handspring
Visor, in the lab coat pocket of
every Medical School student. The
program was initiated in the 1999-
2000 school year by medical stu

dents Scott Rush and Shannon
Moffett with the aid ofTodd Grap
pone, the head of Information
Technology at Lane Medical Li
brary.
"I would see these poor med
students carrying around heavy
reference books in their lab coat
pockets and continually look up
the same kind of information, and
they were on their feet all day. To
me, PDAs and med students just
made sense," Moffett said.
Rush and Moffett formed the
"Palm Project" and spent the rest
of the year convincing administra
tors at the Medical School about
the benefits of such a program.
T heir efforts were rewarded when
Lane Medical Library decided to
sponsor a pilot program.
In the (all of 2000, all 240 pre
clinical students found themselves
with new Palm Vx handhelds.
I hese devices contained a drug
database reference, and the Palm
Project worked on making flash
