# Marijuana study raises questions on addiction
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Is marijuana addictive? Scien
tists are greatly torn when it comes
to answering that question. Accord
ing to recent studies, marijuana has
a lower rate of addiction than many
other substances — 9 percent com
pared, to 15 percent for alcohol, 23
percent for heroin and 33 percent
for cigarettes. Marijuana's negative
effects include greater difficulty in
concentration and increased lung ir
ritation (50 percent more than to
bacco). However, its positive effects
include reducing pain from mi
graines, reducing intraocular pi es
sure (a common symptom of glauco
ma) and combating nausea. These
results will add a new level of com
plexity to the debate of whether or
not to legalize medicinal marijuana.
Cells are generally self-con
tained within their membranes
and communicate indirectly with
each other through structures
called gap junctions in animals
and plasmodesmata in plants. Sci
entists at New York's Brookhaven
National Laboratory and Rice Uni
versity have made a discovery that
challenges this idea. After shining
X-rays at dehydrating cells, the re
searchers found ultra-thin, hour
glass-like stalks connecting the
cells. The finding suggests that cells
could exchange molecules as large
as I)NA, which can help scientists
improve techniques for drug deliv
ery and gene therapy.
With business in the fishing in
dustry slowing down, British sci
entists have come up with a novel
and controversial solution —
make the fish into vegetarians.
The researchers have developed a
synthetic version of fish
pheromone that will induce fish to
eat vegetable matter instead of

smaller fish. The pheromone
would only be released to fish
farms for human consumption. So
far, studies have not detected any
adverse effects on the environ
ment or on the health of the fish.
Meanwhile, the research has incit
ed protests from environmental
activist groups such as Friends of
the Earth, which argues that the
fish are "unnatural."
Scientists at the European
Space Agency's XMM-Newton X
ray observatory announced last
week that they had successfully
measured a neutron star the size
of a large city. Neutron stars are
formed from supernovae which
are explosions of massive stars. An
exploded star can leave behind an
extremely dense core made of
neutrons roughly 10 miles in di
ameter. A teaspoon of the dense
material would weight 100 million

tons on earth. The scientists were
motivated to measure the neutron
star because it has an enormous
magnetic field.
In recent years, there has been
renewed interest in ancient med

ical techniques such as ayurveda,
acupuncture and homeopathy.
But what are these treatments, and
how effective are they? Ayurveda is
an Indian treatment that employs
