# SSE will release financial info
## Deal between SSE CEO and former Daily and Review editors calls for nondisclosure agreement 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Student Enterprises has agreed to release
all financial documents to The Stanford Daily and
The Stanford Review under a nondisclosure agree
ment yet to be worked out between the parties. The
agreement resolved a long and contentious debate
about whether ASSU accountability standards re
quire SSE to divulge what it considers to be propri
etary financial information.
David Endelman, SSE CEO, and Henry Towsner

and Mark Boucher, former editors of The Review
and The Daily, respectively, reached the deal late last
night alter an inconclusive hearing before the ASSU
Constitutional Council.
SSE will release balance statements, income sheets
and cashflows for the whole ASSU and SSE to the
general public. All other information about SSE's in
dividual business units, classified as proprietary by the
SSE Board of Directors, will be released only to the
publications.
The newspapers will also have full access to the
CEO and management at SSE. The agreement came
as a settlement to a case filed by Towsner before the
Constitutional Council.
"We'll work with [The Daily and The Review] to
develop interesting stories," said Endelman, empha-
sizing that there are many stories
that will not hurt SSE's financial
situation.
"The Daily didn't win, The Re
view didn't win, and SSE didn't
win," Towsner said. "1 think we
reached an agreement that will
work for both sides."
"This is a good thing for stu
dents," he concluded.
At last night's hearing, Towsner
and Boucher presented their case
that SSE has withheld too much
proprietary information and
therefore is in violation of the
ASSU Constitution.
"[The process] was sort of a self
realization for both sides about
what was best for students," Endel
man said.
Endelman, the respondent in
the case, was joined by John Hall,
founder of SSE and one of the
writers of the ASSU Constitution,
and Don Coleman, chairman of
the SSE Board of Directors. They
argued that SSE has gone far
enough in disclosing financial in
formation to fulfill its obligations
under the constitution.
Hall, who expounded on the
original role of the freedom of in
formation clause and the exception
for proprietary information, said,

"SSE is doing its damnedest to sup
ply as much open information as it
can while fulfilling its fiduciary re
sponsibilities to the association."
"The whole point of SSE was to
shelter [proprietary] informa
tion," he said, citing in detail two
examples involving how disclosure
hurt FLiCKS financially.
In one, he described FLiCKS in
the era before SSE, explaining
how an article in The Daily under
mined the business's bargaining
power with the University.

"FLiCKS had as its number-one
expense item a monopoly charge
for services associated wit 11 Mem
And,"he explained. "We really felt
the costs were exorbitant.
The business tried to convince
the University to lower the fees
and argued that it could not afford
the expense.
"The University said, 'You can
afford it, you made a thousand
dollars last month according to
The Daily,'" Hall recounted.
"That pulled out our negotiating
position."
Endelman added, "The more
information we give out, the more
vulnerable we are to competition."
Robert Rudnitsky, a member of
the Constitutional Council, sum
marized the direction the proceed
ings were heading right before the
hearing broke off for negotiations.
"There's a big advantage to a lot
of openness," he said, noting SSE's
constitutional responsibility.
" The definition of'proprietary'
should be the narrowest," he con
tinued. "[The SSE Board of Direc
tors has] probably not carved out
the narrowest space."
Despite this, Rudnitsky ex
pressed uncertainty about
whether the Constitutional Coun
cil had the expertise to decide what
was proprietary. The question will
remain undecided, as the parties
plan to withdraw their complaints
pending a final agreement.
