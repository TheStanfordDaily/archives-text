## Telecommunications Crash 
### SIDDHARTHA RAJA 
The telecommunication industry's crash of
2001 is one of the largest business disasters in
history, wiping out more than $2 trillion in
market value over the past two years and easi
ly overshadowing the savings and loan crisis of
the 1980s and the dot-com bust. What forces
were behind the boom of the telecommunica
tions industry and what caused its subsequent
decline?
The dot-com hysteria of the late 1990s

started the proliferation of online businesses
and Web sites selling "eyeballs" to advertisers.
The physical infrastructure of the networks,
which connected computers to one another
and carried packets of data from server to
client, had to be upgraded to meet the over
whelming demand. The problem with this ex
pansion was that it was horribly overdone.
Where one pipe was enough, 10 were laid to
accommodate the estimated 16-fold rise in de
mand per year. Expecting high volumes, and
building to kill competition, carriers began

selling their capacity at ridiculously low prices.
The building frenzy would have been rea
sonable were it not for one important missing
link — the application that would draw users
to demand greater capacity. Video-conferenc
ing never took off, and high-bandwidth trans
fers by residential users — where all the
growth was expected — never caught on. The
applications that were expected to drive the
usage — video on demand, file-transfers,
music and video games — were caught up in
legal and technical traps.
When the demand failed to materialize and
"old-economy" consumers turned away "new
economy" business models, the money
stopped flowing in. Stock prices crashed, and
investors pulled out their funds. Once the well
ran dry, the entire system collapsed. Million
aires were reduced to nothing, and the fiber
laid to satisfy bandwidth-hungry communica
tors was left unused and in excess.
Network and telephone companies suffer
the fate of having huge fixed capital expenses:
the billions of dollars needed to build the net
work. These costs cannot be easily recovered
with the low rates charged for usage.
The implications of the telecom industry's
crash are important to understand. At the
level of the consumer, neither the bankruptcy
of firms such as World Com nor the crash of
telecom stock will have much effect. Yes, if you
had an interest in these companies or the net
works, then you will face a depressed portfolio
value. I lowever, the phones will still work, the
Internet will not shut down, and your local
cable company will not blank out. The greatest
damage is the increasing number of laid-off
workers and declining take-home salaries
caused by the slowed growth, investment and
optimism.
Despite all the bad news, dismal forecasts
and poor finances, it is not the end of road for
telecommunications as a viable business.
Those businesses that last through this phase
of pain will prosper during the golden age of
communications.
Many analysts (who overvalued telecom
munications in the early 19905) are calling this
crash a correction — a cathartic process to sep
arate the serious players from the rest. They
are hopeful that subscribers, usage and profits
will all rise and more than make up for the
losses, gloom and attrition of today.
