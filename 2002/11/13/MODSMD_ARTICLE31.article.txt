## New site fights Yahoo 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The businessmen who salvaged
Excite from one of the Internet's
biggest bankruptcies are launch
ing a new Web site targeted at
disaffected Yahoo! users.
"Yahoo! is Toast" is the theme
of their aggressive new advertis
ing campaign for MyWay.com, a
new online portal that replicates
many of Yahoo's popular fea
tures without ads, fees and intru
sive privacy policies.
MyWay.com will instead find
profits through pay-for-place
ment listings in its search func
tion, which is powered by
Google, said Bill Daugherty, who
also founded the popular online
sweepstakes site iWon.com.
Daugherty, co-CEO of Irving
ton, N.Y.-based Bulldog Hold
ings Inc., is certain the market
ing push will touch a nerve with
Web surfers who feel betrayed by
the changes Yahoo has made
under a new management team
to survive the tech meltdown.
Yahoo now charges for many
once-free services and peppers
its site with a variety of ads that
slow the site's loading speed.
Yahoo offers fee-based services
such as personal ads, the
Hot Jobs career-search site, en
hanced e-mail and game rentals.
The company also loosened
its privacy policies so it could sell
more of the information collect
ed about its registered users.
"No Web site has changed its
relationship more dramatically
in the past two years than Yahoo
has," Daugherty said.
Yahoo, not surprisingly, sees
things differently, pointing to
the Internet icon's huge online
audience and the growing num
ber of visitors willing to pay for
services as a validation of its on
going popularity.
In September, Yahoo ranked
as the Web's third most popular

destination, attracting 60.7 mil
lion unique visitors accessing the
Internet from home, according
to Nielsen/Netßatings.
In the same statement, Yahoo
said it doubts MyWay will be able
to duplicate the "breadth and
depth of the engaging, compre
hensive and relevant services"
offered by its site.
"A simple ad-free site does not
provide value to consumers' lives
if it does not incorporate the
leading technology, compelling
products or an understanding of
consumers," Yahoo said.
Daugherty has established a
solid track record since hitting
the Internet scene four years
ago. His company quickly made
a splash with iWon, which gives
away $10,000 per day, and ex
panded its Web presence late last
year with the $10 million pur
chase of Excite.com from bank
rupt At Home Corp.
IWon and Excite rank among
the Web's 25 most popular desti
nations, attracting a combined
7.6 million unique visitors in
September, according to
N ielsen/Netßatings.
Daugherty thinks he will sub
stantially expand his company's
reach by using MyWay to woo
away disillusioned Yahoo users.
MyWay looks like a clutter
free version of Yahoo, offering
all the standard features of a
Web portal without the distract
ing advertisements.
The ad-free environment en
ables My Way's page to load on
Web browsers quicker than
Yahoo and present more news
headlines on the home page. g
"Once we get the word out,
people are going to start coming
to MyWay and they are going to
like what they see," he predicted.
"II people spend just three min
utes at MyWay, they won't go
back to Yahoo again."
