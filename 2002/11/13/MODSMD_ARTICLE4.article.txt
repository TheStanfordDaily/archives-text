# Cuts to affect student centers
## 
### JULIE TUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following the announcement
of the possibility of a significant
budget cut in the University's gen
eral funds, student concern over fi
nancial support for community
centers and other on-campus re
sources has escalated.
"It's too early in (he budget
process to determine which ser
vices will be impacted by the cuts,"
said Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni. "It's probably
safe to say that, given the magni
tude of the cuts, just about every
area of student affairs will be af
fected."
Student affairs deans and direc
tors have been asked to provide

the administration with three bud
geting scenarios — fora 5-, 7.5-
and 10-percent budget cut — in
cluding information on how their
areas would be impacted. These
proposals will then be reviewed by
the University Budget Committee,
which is chaired by Provost John
Etchemendy.
Awakuni plans to meet with
ASSU leaders to address the cuts
that will be proposed to the Bud

get Committee.
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza said her top priorities are
the community centers and tlie
graduate student programming
board, which organizes events for
the graduate student community.
While she also expressed con
cern for programs under the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, she
anticipates that since they fall
under the realm of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation, such programs will contin
ue to receive funding from the
Campaign for Undergraduate Ed
ucation and will not be impacted
by the budget cuts.
"My hope is that if advocacy ef-

forts [for community centers] are
successful, then the impact won't
be as bad as initially were present
ed," Henestroza said. "All of these
centers offer invaluable resources
to students, [allowing them] to suc
ceed and stay at Stanford."
Although the six community
centers on campus each received
a $50,000 annual funding in
crease beginning (his year, only
half of that amount comes from
permanent funds. The other
$25,000 is derived from one-time
funds that are guaranteed for
three years.
"The programming side of the
community centers has absolutely
blossomed recently since the fund
ing increase," Henestroza said.
"The extra programming money
has mostly gone to student initia
tives; you'd really miss out on the
student component if all the pro
gramming is handled by non-stu
dent administrators."
Senior Owen Li said, "It was

only a few years ago that the com
munity centers had to hold bake
sales to have programming bud
gets. Any sort of budget cut will re
ally take away essential program
ming money."
Li cited examples of program
ming that are now possible such as
the Asian Interactive Mentoring
program and the speaker series,
which are both sponsored by the
Asian American Activities Center.
"Students have been asking a
lot of questions about what's going
to happen, because we really de
pend on the community centers,"
Li said. "There has definitely been
a let of concern about it from peo
ple who don't want to see the pro
gramming cut."
Administrators are working
with the community centers and
other student organizations
through meetings to air concerns
and discuss options.
"My sense with Etchemendy
was that they hadn't consulted stu
dents so much earlier in the year,
but it looks much more promising
now as he's looking to the ASSU to
really help set the agenda as to
what the student priorities are,"

Henestroza said. "But we will real
ly be able to see their commitment
to student issues after the final de
cisions come out."
However, not everyone feels
that enough student input is being
considered.
"Although I will be able to make
my voice heard in an upcoming
meeting my community center is
having with the administration,
that's because I'm 011 the staff,"
said senior Gabriela Rico, academ
ic coordinator at EI Centro Chi
cano. "Others wouldn't have that
same opportunity."
In addition to concerns about
having existing programs cut,
many are anxious about the im
pact the budget cuts may have on
developing new programs.
For instance, the Diversity Ac
tion Council, a committee con
vened by the provost, forwarded
several suggestions for the recruit
ment and retention of minority
students. However, considering
the economic climate and the im
pending budget cuts, Henestroza
doubts that the University will pur
sue the proposals.
"My faculty adviser expressed

some concern that after the Uni
versity declared a budget crisis, a
lot of the recommendations [the
council] made would not be met,
especially for increasing re
sources and diversity in faculty,"
Rico said.
The budget cuts will also impact
other aspects of student life, in
cluding the library system. Tradi
tionally, library hours during
Dead Week extend to 2 a.m. to ac
commodate extra student study
hours, but this year, they will close
at midnight.
According to junior Stewart
NieLson, a former student member
of the academic committee on li
braries, there may be other effects
on the library system that are less
visible. For example, with the hir
ing freeze, books may take longer
to circulate, or the check-out lines
may be understaffed. However, he
does not anticipate that it will affect
actual offerings in the library.
"I don't see much of an effect on
acquisition of books and materials,
because that's definitely a priority
for the library — to keep expand
ing the offerings for the students,"
Nielson said.

cisions come out."
However, not everyone feels
that enough student input is being
considered.
"Although I will be able to make
my voice heard in an upcoming
meeting my community center is
having with the administration,
that's because I'm 011 the staff,"
said senior Gabriela Rico, academ
ic coordinator at EI Centro Chi
cano. "Others wouldn't have that
same opportunity."
In addition to concerns about
having existing programs cut,
many are anxious about the im
pact the budget cuts may have on
developing new programs.
For instance, the Diversity Ac
tion Council, a committee con
vened by the provost, forwarded
several suggestions for the recruit
ment and retention of minority
students. However, considering
the economic climate and the im
pending budget cuts, Henestroza
doubts that the University will pur
sue the proposals.
"My faculty adviser expressed

some concern that after the Uni
versity declared a budget crisis, a
lot of the recommendations [the
council] made would not be met,
especially for increasing re
sources and diversity in faculty,"
Rico said.
The budget cuts will also impact
other aspects of student life, in
cluding the library system. Tradi
tionally, library hours during
Dead Week extend to 2 a.m. to ac
commodate extra student study
hours, but this year, they will close
at midnight.
According to junior Stewart
NieLson, a former student member
of the academic committee on li
braries, there may be other effects
on the library system that are less
visible. For example, with the hir
ing freeze, books may take longer
to circulate, or the check-out lines
may be understaffed. However, he
does not anticipate that it will affect
actual offerings in the library.
"I don't see much of an effect on
acquisition of books and materials,
because that's definitely a priority
for the library — to keep expand
ing the offerings for the students,"
Nielson said.
Following the announcement
of the possibility of a significant
budget cut in the University's gen
eral funds, student concern over fi
nancial support for community
centers and other on-campus re
sources has escalated.
"It's too early in (he budget
process to determine which ser
vices will be impacted by the cuts,"
said Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni. "It's probably
safe to say that, given the magni
tude of the cuts, just about every
area of student affairs will be af
fected."
Student affairs deans and direc
tors have been asked to provide

the administration with three bud
geting scenarios — fora 5-, 7.5-
and 10-percent budget cut — in
cluding information on how their
areas would be impacted. These
proposals will then be reviewed by
the University Budget Committee,
which is chaired by Provost John
Etchemendy.
Awakuni plans to meet with
ASSU leaders to address the cuts
that will be proposed to the Bud

get Committee.
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza said her top priorities are
the community centers and tlie
graduate student programming
board, which organizes events for
the graduate student community.
While she also expressed con
cern for programs under the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, she
anticipates that since they fall
under the realm of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation, such programs will contin
ue to receive funding from the
Campaign for Undergraduate Ed
ucation and will not be impacted
by the budget cuts.
"My hope is that if advocacy ef-

forts [for community centers] are
successful, then the impact won't
be as bad as initially were present
ed," Henestroza said. "All of these
centers offer invaluable resources
to students, [allowing them] to suc
ceed and stay at Stanford."
Although the six community
centers on campus each received
a $50,000 annual funding in
crease beginning (his year, only
half of that amount comes from
permanent funds. The other
$25,000 is derived from one-time
funds that are guaranteed for
three years.
"The programming side of the
community centers has absolutely
blossomed recently since the fund
ing increase," Henestroza said.
"The extra programming money
has mostly gone to student initia
tives; you'd really miss out on the
student component if all the pro
gramming is handled by non-stu
dent administrators."
Senior Owen Li said, "It was

only a few years ago that the com
munity centers had to hold bake
sales to have programming bud
gets. Any sort of budget cut will re
ally take away essential program
ming money."
Li cited examples of program
ming that are now possible such as
the Asian Interactive Mentoring
program and the speaker series,
which are both sponsored by the
Asian American Activities Center.
"Students have been asking a
lot of questions about what's going
to happen, because we really de
pend on the community centers,"
Li said. "There has definitely been
a let of concern about it from peo
ple who don't want to see the pro
gramming cut."
Administrators are working
with the community centers and
other student organizations
through meetings to air concerns
and discuss options.
"My sense with Etchemendy
was that they hadn't consulted stu
dents so much earlier in the year,
but it looks much more promising
now as he's looking to the ASSU to
really help set the agenda as to
what the student priorities are,"

Henestroza said. "But we will real
ly be able to see their commitment
to student issues after the final de
cisions come out."
However, not everyone feels
