# DA will not charge Peterson
## 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Yesterday morning, the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office informed
Daniel Barton, the lawyer of junior Nathan
Charles Peterson, that it would not be tiling
charges against Peterson.
On Oct. 24, the Stanford Police Depart
ment arrested Peterson for alleged rape
and penetration with a foreign object. He
was held overnight in the Santa Clara
County jail. Last Friday, two weeks after
Peterson was released on $50,000 bail, the
District Attorney's office decided that it
would not press charges, according to
Barton.
"The District Attorney's office normally
has two reasons for not filing charges," he

said. "They look at the charges and decide
that a crime wasn't committed, or they
may think a crime was committed, but
can't prove it."
Late yesterday evening, Lt. Hilary
Karp of the Stanford Police Department
confirmed that the District Attorney's of
fice had decided not to file charges. The
Daily was unable to reach the District At
torney's office before press time.
Barton said that he is pleased with the
decision.
"The DA's office did what it was sup
posed to do and decided there was no rea
son to file charges," he said.
â€” Tomorrow's Daily will contain more
detailed coverage of the District Attorney's
office's decision not to charge Peterson.
