# Profs say ancient Greeks used concept of infinity

### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
A casual visit to the Walters Art
Museum in Baltimore by Stanford
Classics Prof. Reviel Netz and col
league Ken Saito of Osaka Prefec
ture University has proven to be
more fruitful than either imag
ined. A scrupulous examination of
a section from the Archimedes
Palimpsest has contradicted wide
ly held views of the history of
mathematics by showing that the
ancient Greeks understood the
concept of infinity.
The palimpsest — text written
over text — contains a compendi
um of mathematical treatises, in
cluding the only copy of "Method
of Mechanical Theorems," in
which Archimedes explains how
lie drew upon mechanical means
to elucidate his mathematical the
orems.
Overlayed by the Ku< hologion,
a 13th-century Greek prayer

hook, the treatise remained hid
den until its discovery in 1906 by
the Danish philologist Johan Lud
vig I leiherg in a volume collection
in Istanbul. Equipped with a mag
nifying glass, Heiberg would set
out to examine the text.
"Back then, the text was in
much better condition," Net/, ex
plained.
Despite his efforts, Heiberg was
unable to fully decipher the trea
tise, skipping over a significant
section of Archimedes' work.
The palimpsest went missing
and remained hidden from the
scholarly community for nearly a
century. In 1998, Christie's Auc
tion I louse sold it to a private col
lector, who supports its conserva
tion at the Walters Art Museum.
Netz and Saito examined the
unread piece of the treatise in
their visit to Baltimore in 2001
and discovered something new.
"It's as if you're reading a text
in chemistry, and it's all about sub

stances and molecules, when sud
denly in the middle you see a pas
sage about forces," Net/ ex
plained.
In a similar way, a sudden shift
of topic in the treatise enabled
Net/, to uncover the undeci
phered portion of the text.
"We could hardly believe our
eyes," he wrote in an article pub

lished in the Nov. I issue of the
journal Science. "It turned out
that Archimedes was looking for
rigorous ways of establish
ing . . . calculus."
Netz's discovery contradicts to
the commonly accepted belief that
modern mathematicians were the

first to be able to handle infinitely
large sets. According to conven
tional wisdom, the Greeks avoid
ed dealing with infinity.
"112 low do you add up infinitely
many lines in a finite area?" Net/
said. "That is the basis of calcu
lus."
Following a conceptual shift to
ward calculus during the Scientif
ic Revolution in the 16th century
and subsequent work by modern
mathematicians and philoso
phers, modern-day mathematics
currently includes an exact con
cept of infinity.
As such, this concept was at
tributed in large part to work by
modern-day mathematicians.
Netz's discovery challenges this
notion.
"This changes an image of the
Greek mind [held] since the 19th
century," he said.
Uncovering the mysteries of
Archimedes' treatise is an ongo
ing process for Netz and the
Archimedes Project. Although so
phisticated computers and soft
ware have enabled the investiga
tors to make groundbreaking ad
vances, there are difficulties in in
terpreting the data.
Current efforts by Netz and
coworkers include analyzing digi
tized portions of the text under
normal and ultraviolet light. This
methodology enables the investi
gators to assess Archimedes' work
in reference to the text written
over it.
"Sophisticated thought about
the nature of infinity and infinite
sets is commonly assumed to be
the exclusive property of modern
mathematics and logic," said D. S.
Neil Van Leeuwen, a doctoral stu
dent in ancient philosophy.
"Netz's Findings will reveal that
ancient Greek mathematics ri
valed our own in more ways than
we thought."
Netz owes much of his work to
that of late History of Science
Prof. Wilbur Richard Knorr, who
was trying to find the Archimedes
Palimpsest prior to his death in
1997.
