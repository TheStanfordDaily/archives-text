# Profs say ancient Greeks used concept of infinity

A casual visit to the Walters Art
Museum in Baltimore by Stanford
Classics Prof. Reviel Netz and col
league Ken Saito of Osaka Prefec
ture University has proven to be
more fruitful than either imag
ined. A scrupulous examination of
a section from the Archimedes
Palimpsest has contradicted wide
ly held views of the history of
mathematics by showing that the
ancient Greeks understood the
concept of infinity.
The palimpsest — text written
over text — contains a compendi
um of mathematical treatises, in
cluding the only copy of "Method
of Mechanical Theorems," in
which Archimedes explains how
lie drew upon mechanical means
to elucidate his mathematical the
orems.
Overlayed by the Ku< hologion,
a 13th-century Greek prayer

hook, the treatise remained hid
den until its discovery in 1906 by
the Danish philologist Johan Lud
vig I leiherg in a volume collection
in Istanbul. Equipped with a mag
nifying glass, Heiberg would set
out to examine the text.
"Back then, the text was in
much better condition," Net/, ex
plained.
Despite his efforts, Heiberg was
unable to fully decipher the trea
tise, skipping over a significant
section of Archimedes' work.
The palimpsest went missing
and remained hidden from the
scholarly community for nearly a
century. In 1998, Christie's Auc
tion I louse sold it to a private col
lector, who supports its conserva
tion at the Walters Art Museum.
Netz and Saito examined the
unread piece of the treatise in
their visit to Baltimore in 2001
and discovered something new.
"It's as if you're reading a text
in chemistry, and it's all about sub

stances and molecules, when sud
denly in the middle you see a pas
sage about forces," Net/ ex
plained.
In a similar way, a sudden shift
of topic in the treatise enabled
Net/, to uncover the undeci
phered portion of the text.
"We could hardly believe our
eyes," he wrote in an article pub

lished in the Nov. I issue of the
journal Science. "It turned out
that Archimedes was looking for
rigorous ways of establish
ing . . . calculus."
Netz's discovery contradicts to
the commonly accepted belief that
modern mathematicians were the
