"We have contingency plans in place," said

hospital spokesperson Maria La Ganga, " The hos
pitals, the clinic sand the emergency room will be
open as usual, but elective surgeries have been
rescheduled."
Negotiations fora new contract had begun in
early September, but union representatives and

''Enough is enough," said
Anna Sale of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition. "We invited
Hennessy to the picket line in an
open letter in The Daily, and he
didn't come. 1,000 Stanford hos
pital workers are on strike. What
will it take for Hennessy to meet
with workers and students about
a code of conduct?"
While some students believe
that Hennessy is in a position to
influence the hospitals' labor poli
cies, Ihe University administra
tion has maintained that it is not
involved in the hospitals' internal
affairs.
"The University is the corporate
parent of the two hospitals," La
Ganga said. "Each hospital has a
separate board of directors respon
sible for our own governance."
Last week, the hospital mailed
what it called its "last, best and
final offer" to workers. The offer
included a2l percent average pay
raise over the next three years, a
new pay scale to take into account
workers' seniority and cost-of-liv
ing expenses, and a proposal to
create a joint worker-manage
ment committee to make deci
sions on staffing levels and other
factors related to patient care.
Last Friday, 76 percent of the

union workers voted against the
hospitals' proposal.
On Oct. 30, union workers had
voted to strike if a compromise
was not reached by the previous
contract's expiration.
Ana Esquivel, a nursing assis
tant and chief union steward at
the children's hospital, said that
the hospitals' proposed wage in
crease is still not competitive.
"Managers want to keep work
ers at the hospitals paid two to
three dollars less than other area
hospitals," she said.
Union workers have also criti
cized the proposed pay scale,
through which it would take 15
years to reach full seniority, as op
posed to what Esquivel claims is
an average of three-and-a-half
years to seven years at other area
hospitals.
In addition, workers are con
cerned that the joint worker
management committee pro
posed by the hospital won't allow
them an effective means to influ
ence patient care-related deci
sions. But the hospital disagrees.
"We proposed a joint labor
management committee that will
give our valued employees a voice
in staffing issues, patient care is
sues and other important con
cerns," La Ganga said. "But we
believe that internal leadership
can make better staff ing decisions
than an outside arbitrator with
out the experience and knowl
edge of our organization."
