### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Robert W. Beyers, renowned for liis
honest reporting din ing the 29 years he
served as director of Stanford News Ser
vice, died of pancreatic cancer at 71 years
ofageonOct. IS. Beyers earned nation
al recognition for reporting the truth
even when it was damaging to the Uni
versity. I lis forthright style of 'journalism
helped Stanford gain recognition as a
top university.
"| Beyers'] premise was that if you tell
people the bad news that they will then
believe you when you have some good
news to tell them," said I larry Press '3D,

who worked with Beyers as editor of the
Stanford Observer, the precursor to
Stanford Magazine.
"Bob Beyers never saw himself as en
gaged in public relations, always as a
journalist," Stanford President Emeritus
Richard YV. Lyman said. "1 le lived by the
highest standards of that profession: un
flagging energy, total integrity, insa
tiable curiosity and unsparing candor."
"I lis services to Stanford were incom
parable, and contributed significantly to
the institution's rapid rise in prestige and
respect, in academia and beyond,"
Lyman continued. "I le combined all this

public relations officer.
with a talent for warm friendship.
I fe will be widely as well as deeply
missed."
Karen Bartholomew '71, who
also worked with Beyers at the
news service, said that Beyers
played a large role in helping The
Stanford Daily win its indepen
dence from the school.
In addition, when police offi
cers, armed with a search warrant,
searched The Daily for photo
graphic evidence of a violent
protest that had taken place earli
er, Beyers defended The Daily
and helped it file a suit which even
tually made its way to the Supreme
Court in The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher.
In addition to befriending col
leagues at the news service, Bey
ers' straightforward approach to
journalism earned him the re
spect of reporters such as Mary
Madison '5-5, who wrote for the
Palo Alto Times. Madison de
scribed how a young woman mar

ried to a Stanford graduate was
murdered in the chapel at the
base of the altar at Stanford in
1971. The Stanford police tried to
cover it up, and the chapel still
had services as usual, but Beyers
told Madison about the event so
she could report it.
"If Bob had chosen to go along
with the police and kept a lid on
that story, the whole world would
have been ranting and accusing
Stanford of hiding such a horrible
truth," Madison said.
While at Stanford, Beyers was
not only an academic resource but
a resource for many.
Philip Taubman '69, now
deputy editorial page editor at the
New York Times, said that "Bob
was the best university spokesman
in the country during the years he
was at Stanford," because he was
candid but also because he was
personable.
"Bob always made it a point to
get to know the Daily staff, and
every year he would host a bar
beque for the Knight fellows and
the Daily staff," Taubman said.
"When I was a student and editor
of The Daily, Bob served not only

as a source of information but as a
friend for many young journalists
at Stanford."
Beyers was born Oct. 10, 1931
in New York City. At Cornell,
where he received his bachelor's
degree, Beyers was editor in chief
of the Cornell Daily Sun. In 1961,
Beyers came to Stanford and
helped found the Campus Report,
which later became the Stanford
Report.
Under Beyers' leadership, the
Stanford News Service produced
publications aimed at recruiting
minorities.
A memorial service will be held
in Stanford's Memorial Church on
Monday, Jan. 6, 2003, at 4 p.m.,
followed by a reception at the Fac
ulty Club.
The family would like contri
butions made out to the Robert
and Charlotte Beyers Fund of the
Stanford Historical Society, c/o
Gift Processing, Office of Develop
ment, 326 Galvez St., Stanford, CA
94305-6105. The fund supports

Robert W. Beyers, renowned for liis
honest reporting din ing the 29 years he
served as director of Stanford News Ser
vice, died of pancreatic cancer at 71 years
ofageonOct. IS. Beyers earned nation
al recognition for reporting the truth
even when it was damaging to the Uni
versity. I lis forthright style of 'journalism
helped Stanford gain recognition as a
top university.
"| Beyers'] premise was that if you tell
people the bad news that they will then
believe you when you have some good
news to tell them," said I larry Press '3D,

who worked with Beyers as editor of the
Stanford Observer, the precursor to
Stanford Magazine.
"Bob Beyers never saw himself as en
gaged in public relations, always as a
journalist," Stanford President Emeritus
Richard YV. Lyman said. "1 le lived by the
highest standards of that profession: un
flagging energy, total integrity, insa
tiable curiosity and unsparing candor."
"I lis services to Stanford were incom
parable, and contributed significantly to
the institution's rapid rise in prestige and
respect, in academia and beyond,"
Lyman continued. "I le combined all this

with a talent for warm friendship.
I fe will be widely as well as deeply
missed."
Karen Bartholomew '71, who
also worked with Beyers at the
news service, said that Beyers
played a large role in helping The
Stanford Daily win its indepen
dence from the school.
In addition, when police offi
cers, armed with a search warrant,
searched The Daily for photo
graphic evidence of a violent
protest that had taken place earli
er, Beyers defended The Daily
and helped it file a suit which even
tually made its way to the Supreme
Court in The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher.
In addition to befriending col
leagues at the news service, Bey
ers' straightforward approach to
journalism earned him the re
spect of reporters such as Mary
Madison '5-5, who wrote for the
Palo Alto Times. Madison de
scribed how a young woman mar

ried to a Stanford graduate was
murdered in the chapel at the
base of the altar at Stanford in
1971. The Stanford police tried to
cover it up, and the chapel still
had services as usual, but Beyers
told Madison about the event so
she could report it.
"If Bob had chosen to go along
with the police and kept a lid on
that story, the whole world would
have been ranting and accusing
Stanford of hiding such a horrible
truth," Madison said.
While at Stanford, Beyers was
not only an academic resource but
a resource for many.
Philip Taubman '69, now
deputy editorial page editor at the
New York Times, said that "Bob
was the best university spokesman
in the country during the years he
was at Stanford," because he was
candid but also because he was
personable.
"Bob always made it a point to
get to know the Daily staff, and
every year he would host a bar
beque for the Knight fellows and
the Daily staff," Taubman said.
"When I was a student and editor
of The Daily, Bob served not only

as a source of information but as a
friend for many young journalists
at Stanford."
Beyers was born Oct. 10, 1931
in New York City. At Cornell,
where he received his bachelor's
degree, Beyers was editor in chief
of the Cornell Daily Sun. In 1961,
Beyers came to Stanford and
helped found the Campus Report,
which later became the Stanford
Report.
Under Beyers' leadership, the
Stanford News Service produced
publications aimed at recruiting
minorities.
A memorial service will be held
in Stanford's Memorial Church on
Monday, Jan. 6, 2003, at 4 p.m.,
followed by a reception at the Fac
ulty Club.
