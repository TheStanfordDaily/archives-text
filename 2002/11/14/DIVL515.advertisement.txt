Qrowfi Thanksgiving
The concept for this Thanksgiving dinner is to have a traditional menu executed from as much local and organic
product as possible. The reasoning behind this is to help support our local farmers as well as to provide the freshest
and most healthy food available. The turkey is free-range and growth hormone free. The beef is grass fed as well
as free-range. Most of the produce is organic and locally grown. The meal is as scratch-cooked as possible
down to the pies and Chantilly cream.
