## Iraqi government agrees to U.N. resolution 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) â€”
Saddam Hussein's government
agreed to a tough U.N. resolution
on weapons inspections yesterday,
declaring it wants to save the Iraqi
people from war. But the harsh
tone of Iraq's acceptance letter
raised questions about how it
would treat the arms inspectors.
Although Iraq agreed to strin
gent new terms, President Bush
warned he had "zero tolerance"
for any Iraqi attempts to hide
weapons of mass destruction and
said a coalition of nations is ready
to force Saddam to disarm.
In a nine-page letter arriving
two days ahead of a deadline, Iraq
said it wants to prove to the world
that it has no weapons of mass de
struction. But the letter was laced
with anti-American and anti-Is
raeli statements as well as stern
warnings for U.N. weapons inspec
tors, whose advance team is to ar
rive in Baghdad on Monday.

In contrast, Iraq's U.N. am
bassador, Mohammed Al-Douri,
said his government had chosen
"the path of peace" and its accep
tance had "no conditions, no
reservations."
Still, the strident tone of Iraqi
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri's letter
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, which included warnings
about how Baghdad expects in
spectors to behave, raised concern
about Iraq's plans to cooperate
with the resolution.
After meeting with Bush in
Washington, Annan said he would
wait to see whether the letter's lan
guage "is an indication that they
are going to play games ... I think
the issue is not their acceptance,
but performance on the ground."
Under the resolution, the inspec
tors have until Dec. 23 to begin their
duties. Following the advance team,
a small group of inspectors are
scheduled to start work on Nov. 25.
