BEIJING (AP) — Vice President Hu Jintao
took another step toward becoming China's
next leader today as the government an
nounced he was the only top politician re-elect
ed to the Communist Party's Central Commit
tee — the most concrete sign yet of his ascent.
As China's National Party Congress came to
an end, party delegates also moved to approve
President Jiang Zemin's "Three Represents"
theory, adding capitalist-style ideology to their
party charter as they work to keep pace with
economic reforms and the introduction of the
market economy.
The official Xinhua News Agency said Jiang

was not on the list of those re-elected, indicating
his expected retirement from a formal party
role.
It specifically identified Hu as "the only mem
ber" of the last party congress' Standing Com
mittee to be re-elected. The Standing Commit
tee is the inner sanctum of party leadership —
and, by extension, the leadership of China.
The leaders are expected to be formally in
troduced tomorrow at the Great Hall of the
People.
Jiang, 76, general secretary of the Commu
nist Party since he replaced Zhao Ziyang in a
1989 purge after the Tiananmen Square

democracy protests, will remain president until
March. But the party position is the wellspring
of his power, and his departure from it makes
his retirement as president certain.
The moves, which launch a younger gener
ation of leaders to shepherd China through a
period of dizzying economic change, come at
the end of the congress, the once-in-five-years
meeting of the party that has ruled China since
its insurgents took the mainland in 1949.
Hu, 59, was designated as Jiang's heir ap
parent by the late senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
His ascent has been widely expected, though
little is known about him.
