# House passes bill on Homeland Security
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
The House voted emphatically
yesterday to create a Homeland
Security Department, pro
pelling President Bush nearer
his goal of answering last year's
terrorist attacks with the biggest
restructuring of government in
half a century.
The measure, if passed by
the senate, would allow airline
pilots to carry guns in cockpits,
give airports a one-year delay
in the Dec. 31 deadline for in
stalling equipment to inspect
all checked bags for explosives,
and let the new agency sign
contracts with U.S. companies
that have relocated abroad to
dodge taxes.
The 299-121 roll call — and a
pair of favorable procedural
votes in the Democratic-run
Senate — signaled that lawmak
ers were ready to award a leg
islative triumph to a president
whose hand was strengthened

by Republican victories in last
week's congressional elections.
Bush began supporting the
idea of a huge new department
combining 22 agencies this sum
mer after initially coming to office
seeking to diminish the role of
government in Americans' lives.
"Times have changed and it's
imperative to the security of our
country and the security of our
families that our government
change as well," said Rep. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio.
Opposition came mostly
from Democrats arguing that
the bill still lacked adequate job
protections for the new agency's
170,000 workers. Voting for the
measure were 212 Republicans
and 87 Democrats, while six Re
publicans, 114 Democrats and
one independent voted "no."
The bill is "just another ex
ample of the Bush administra
tion's union-busting policies,"
said Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla.
