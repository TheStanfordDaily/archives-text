## The 						Stanford Daily University should take stand against Patriot Act 
### 
Published Since 1891

Last week, members of the Faculty Sen
ate raised concerns regarding the im
pact that the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Re
quired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act
— better known as the USA Patriot Act —
would have on research at Stanford and on civil
liberties for students. While acknowledging that
the act could be quite "Draconian," University
President John Hennessy stated that "We (the
administration) have relatively little power over
this issue." We find this stance unacceptable.
As one of the leading research institutions in
the country and one that supposedly promotes
intellectual freedom, Stanford has not only the
power but the responsibility to publicly de
nounce such legislation. The University could
also challenge sections of it in court or lobby its
senators and congressmen to repeal the act.
Hennessy's inactive response can only con
tribute to the legislation's "Draconian" impact.

When coupled with other legislation passed
this year, the act has serious implications for re
search at Stanford, particularly in the biologi
cal and medical fields. The legislation restricts
the possession of certain biological materials.
W T hile the list of restricted materials has still not
been finalized, vague language about their
permissible usage makes engaging in certain
research even more threatening, as possession
of select materials becomes a criminal offense.
The law also specifies "restricted persons"
who cannot handle certain materials. Included
in this category are nationals from Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria—as
well as people convicted of certain crimes, those
dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Aimed
Services, fugitives from justice, unlawful users of
controlled substances and those adjudicated as
"mentally defective" or who have ever been
committed to a mental institution.
Therefore, it is not only the rights of immi

grants, but the rights of all citizens that are
under attack with this legislation. To include as
"restricted persons" people who have been
merely indicted, or formally charged, with cer
tain crimes destroys one of the cornerstones of
the judicial process in this country — that the
accused be innocent before proven guilty.
Foreign students admitted to Stanford have
already felt the discrimination of stricter immi
gration regulations — this year, 25 to 30 un
dergraduate and graduate students did not re
ceive visas in time to arrive for fall quarter. And
students who are citizens of countries seen as
"supporters to terrorism," which include Iraq,
Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, Yemen and
Saudi Arabia, will be subject to fingerprinting,
photographing and reporting to Immigration
and Naturalization Services periodically.
This policy has less to do with preventing ter
rorism than it does with promoting racism. And
in addition to the racist scapegoating of certain

communities, the Patriot Act further threatens
the intellectual freedom and civil liberties of all
residents of this country. The act will allow FBI
agents access to library records without any
onus to provide "probable cause." According to
the American Library Association, librarians
could be forced to hand over circulation
records to FBI agents. As students we should be
very concerned that what we read is now sub
ject to government surveillance.
As the head of an institution dedicated to in
tellectual freedom, Hennessy must take a
stand on these threats to our rights. It is the
president's duty to protect the academic pur
suits of students and faculty on campus, re
gardless of their country of origin. Hennessy
has often said that it is not in University char
ter to take political positions. But when the
very essence of a University is under threat by
a government's policies, silence is a dangerous
political position.
