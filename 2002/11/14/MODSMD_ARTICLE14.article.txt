It is nearly palpable. The nation has em
braced the Bush doctrine and Republi
cans have made history. The COP is
America's party.
For their part, Democrats have had lit
tle more to offer than partisan rhetoric;
consider their recent habit of blaming
President Bush fora bad economy and
waxing nostalgic for Clinton-era prosperi
ty. They ignore that Clinton's only real ac
complishment was to allow Newt Gingrich
and a Republican Congress to enact wel
fare reform, balance the budget, cut taxes
and save Medicare from bankruptcy. More
recently, the Democrats' spiritless capitula
tion to Bush's tax cut has left voters won
dering exactly what Democrats stand for.
Formerly, we could at least count on their
perfunctory support for social engineering

and gross wealth redistri
bution.
The Bush administra
tion's swift annihilation of
the Taliban regime de
clared to the world that
Clinton-Gore appease
ment and passivity had
ceased. Last week the
U.N. Security Council

voted unanimously fora resolution to de
mand Iraqi disarmament. Even Syria, an
Arab nation neighboring Iraq, gave its sup
port. (In contrast, the U.N. resolution to
strike against Iraq in August 1990, a day
after Saddam Hussein's army invaded
Kuwait, fell three votes short of unanimity.)
I n America's own vote last Titesday, the
nation endorsed the Republicans' vision
and clarity of purpose. Now. I invite you to
consider the political climate at Stanford
and just how alien our university finds it
self to the values of the nation at large.
According to a study conducted by the
American Enterprise Institute on college
faculty party affiliations, 151 Stanford
professors registered with the Democrat
ic Party or another party on the left,
while only 17 registered with the Repub
lican Party or another party on the right.
T hat's right — 90 percent of our faculty
presumably votes Democratic (or Green,
or Socialist).
Certainly there is nothing inherently
wrong with the ideological rift between
our faculty and our national policymak
ers. Universities have been, and must al
ways remain, a wellspring of new ideas.
My point is that Stanford students
should recogni/e, firstly, the preponder
ance of liberalism among our faculty and,
secondly, that the personal politics of our
professors almost certainly influence the
content of their courses. Although several
Hoover fellows do teach undergraduate
courses, their numbers hardly restore an
ideological equilibrium.
Of course, Stanford undergraduates
have options; they may pick from a host of
international universities at which to in
dulge their cosmopolitan, citizen-of-the
world sensibilities. Stanford in Oxford.

Stanford in Berlin. Stanford in Santiago.
After perusing the course catalogue,
however, I discovered that many of the
courses at these foreign campuses bear a
strong similarity to Stanford's own relativis
tic, multicultural, anti-Western curriculum.
So I propose a new program that will ex
pose students to new ideas and values —
ideas and values exceedingly scarce at our
university — at a fract ion of the cost: Stan
ford in St. Louis.
I encourage all undergrads to spend a
semester at Fontbonne University, a low-tu
ition school situated in a serene neighbor
hood minutes away from metropolitan St.
Louis. A Midwestern sojourn could be just
what we all need in order to disentangle our
minds from Stanford's liberal orthodoxy.
Unlike Stanford and its sister campus
es, Fontbonne offers classes less infused
with a leftist political agenda.
As Dinesh D'Souza has illustrated in
several of his books, the more prestigious
a university, the greater the proportion of
liberal professors. Fontbonne does not
pose an immediate threat to eclipse Stan
ford or its cohorts in the "US News" rank
ings. Consequently, I would guess that the
school does not come across as a sensitivi
ty re-education camp. Also unlikely is the
coordinated, impassioned resistance to
the First Amendment rights of conserva
tive speakers and writers.
Nor, however, is St. Louis a homoge
neously conservative city. Indeed, in last
week's Senate race, Democrat Jean Carna
han won both the city proper and (nar
rowly) the populous St. Louis County.
Nevertheless, having grown up in this
somewhat provincial Missouri town, 1 can
assure you that it is far more representative
of the values of the USA than Stanford.
A visit to the Midwest would expose
Stanford undergrads to oddities unseen
on elite college campuses: sincere gestures
of patriotism — perhaps a house painter
with an American flag waving atop his
Ford, who has no appreciation for "tacki
ness." Or maybe you will see Bosnian im
migrants laboring assiduously, awed at the
opportunity and self-determination ex
tended to them. Ihe belief in the great
promise of our nation is still alive in the
river city. Such visions might round out
Stanford's alternative take on the Ameri
can Dream — namely, that it is a fraudu
lent, fictitious construct.
I am not suggesting that Stanford, or
any university, adopt a Pollyannaish, un
( l itical view of America. But prestigious
universities should not inculcate leftist po
litical leanings at the expense oftried-and
true tenets of Western education. There
has to be a balance between a critical anal
ysis of our nation's heritage and an ac
knowledgement of that which is right and
true about it.

his love of Stanford with his love of America. E
