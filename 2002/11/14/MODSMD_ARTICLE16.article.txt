Guests at fraternity parties should take
responsibility for their actions
I am writing in response to the recent
articles and letters about the roles of alco
hol and fraternities on this campus. As a
member of a Greek organization, I un
derstand and accept the ideals of collec
tive responsibility, which requires each
Greek member to, at times, be represen
tative of his or her organization. Because
of collective responsibility, fraternities
are held responsible even if only one of
their members breaks a campus rule at a
party. They are also held responsible for
their guests.
What troubles me is the extension of
these ideals into the general campus atti
tude. An underage student attends a fra
ternity party and is taken to the hospital for
alcohol poisoning, and Stanford's immedi
ate reaction is often to place the fraternity
in question on alcohol probation. While
fraternities should, in the current Univer
sity climate, do everything in their power
to avoid serving alcohol to underage stu
dents, it disturbs me that the Stanford com
munity response is to solely blame the fra
ternity fora student's indiscretions.
We as students know that if we drink
too much and wind up in the hospital, we
will get a slap on the wrist from Residential
Education and perhaps a lecture from our
parents. I think by now we also know that
the organization that served us could end
up on probation. At what point do we take
responsibility for ourselves? It is fitting
that we write articles and letters about how
fraternities need to be more responsible,
but perhaps we should turn those admo
nitions inward — if the University is not
going to hold us individually responsible
for our alcohol intake, we need to start
holding ourselves responsible.
Certainly, fraternities should do every

thing they can to ensure the safety of their
guests, but we have a responsibility to our
hosts as well. If you don't want Stanford's
fraternities to be on probation, there are a
few simple steps you can take. If you are
under 21, don't try to obtain alcohol at frat
parties, or at least limit your intake to a
very safe level. If you are over 21, don't
drink too much, and don't drive drunk.
Do not sneak into back doors at fraternity
parties and don't sneak in your non-Stan
ford friends. While these suggestions are
certainly easier said than done, they are
necessary if one wants to help enable fra
ternities to continue to throw parties. We
must realize that fraternity probations are
often a combination of fraternity error
and guest error. We should also realize
that our fraternities are under no obliga
tion to throw all-campus parties and often
do so to their own detriment. Continued
abuse of their hospitality will result in the
strictly enforced invite parties that are the
norm at many schools.
Every student should recognize his or
her role in making Stanford parties safe —
so before you drink yourself into oblivion
at the next frat party (should we ever have
one again), think about the repercussions
your actions could have on the greater
campus community. It's very simple: If
you get into trouble with alcohol at a fiat
party, the fraternity will be held responsi
ble. Therefore, if you want to keep going
to frat parties, don't get yourself into that
kind of trouble. It is time for Stanford stu
dents to stop reaping the benefits of fra
ternity parties without making any contri
bution; we owe it to fraternities to be re
sponsible guests. The continuation of all
campus parties can only occur if both fra
ternities and their student guests commit
themselves to safety.

Administrators on alcohol education
We were pleased to see, in Friday's edi
torial, increased interest in having the Uni
versity develop new ways to promote alco
hol safety and provide more alcohol-free
opportunities. A number of good ideas
were presented in this editorial.
We want the community to know that the
University has been actively working with
students to support effective alcohol educa
tion on campus over the last few years and
has received many positive responses from
students. Iliese initiatives have included a
revamped "Real World: Stanford" and a
new NSC) program, "Walking the Party
Line," which RAsand PHEs conduct in frosh
houses. We also conduct informative and en
tertaining alcohol presentations in the resi
dences and intensive training for RAs, PHEs
and party-planners. Programmatic efforts
directed to de-emphasizing alcohol have
also increased. Recent additions have in
cluded discounted Jamba Juice EANABS,
subsidized (half-priced) tickets to Lively
Arts events, a "movie express" shuttle to
nearby movie theaters on Friday nights and
a soon-to-be-launched shuttle service be
tween San Francisco and Palo Alto on Sat
urday evenings intended to replace the
weekend closing of the CalTrain.
We continue to develop new initiatives,
and we know that these efforts are best
done in partnership between the Univer
sity and students. We welcome your ideas
for increasing alcohol safety and provid
ing alcohol-free options.
