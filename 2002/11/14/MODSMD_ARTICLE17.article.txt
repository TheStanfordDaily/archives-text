# Debating the University's role in on-campus labor issues
## The 						University should do more to improve labor standards and wages for workers on campus The 						University will support campus workers when it has the ability, right to do so

When University President John Hennessy recently
announced his living wage policy, many Stanford work
ers, students and faculty found the proposal to be highly
inadequate. 1 he proposal excludes most service workers
at Stanford, including employees of vendors (such as
Bon Appetit), all unionized workers and workers at the
Stanford Hospitals (not to mention all temporary and
part-time employees).
Because of these narrow guidelines, there are hun
dreds of workers who will still earn poverty wages and go
without health care benefits. The ASSIJ, Graduate Stu
dent Council and Faculty Senate did not approve of the
proposed policy because Hennessy did not produce any
research to demonstrate the effectiveness of this policy or
to show how many workers it would cover.
\ he reason so many workers are being left out of the
proposal is that the University maintains two positions:
First, it will not regulate the labor practices of supposed
"outside" entities that operate on campus, such as ven
dors and the Stanford Hospitals. Second, it will not inter
fere in negotiations between unions and management.
Each situation deserves individual attention, but the
final conclusion is the same: Though the University is not
legally required to become involved in any of these situ
ations, the University has every legal right to create basic
labor guidelines that all of these entities must follow.
The University is fearful of being involved in the labor
practices of on-campus vendors (such as Bon Appetit and
the Treehouse) because, administrators argue, this would
obligate it to be involved in the labor practices of all busi
nesses on campus, even the Macy's at the Stanford Shop
ping Center. To this, we say the University should moni
tor how every business on Stanford land treats its workers
because the rent from on-campus businesses funds the
University. The Stanford Management Company leases
land to the Stanford Shopping Center and other com
mercial vendors like Bon Appetit, and this money goes
back to the endowment, which funds most Stanford pro
grams. When there are so many other sources of money,
the funds that support the University should not come off
of the backs of the lowest-paid workers.
In terms of organized workers, there is nothing illegal
about management and union representatives meeting
before or after contract negotiations, if both sides agree
to meet or if there are extenuating circumstances. SEIU
Local 715 has formally requested meetings with Hen
nessy to discuss a code of conduct for its members (di
rectly hired Stanford workers and Bon Appetit workers),
but Stanford has refused to meet outside of contract ne
gotiations. Basically, the University will not even meet
with the union that represents its own employees to dis
cuss sett ing labor standards.
Even when Stanford is not bargaining directly with a
union, the University can still put pressure on unionized
outside entities to uphold certain labor standards. In fact,

the University met with Bon
Appetit management

last year during contract negotiations to discuss labor stan
dards, although the content of their meetings was not
made public.
Instead of informal meetings with management, we
want an institutionalized process that will allow Stanford to
ensure that basic standards are met everywhere on cam
pus. This is different from interfering in negotiations or
other internal operations of other businesses, because these
are a set of minimum guidelines that all employers must
meet to operate at Stanford.
This is not unprecedented. Living wage ordinances in

San Francisco, San Jose and many other major cities
in the U.S. apply to companies that contract with city
governments and require these companies to abide

by wage and benefit standards.
The Stanford Hospital also desperately needs to
have a code of conduct to protect employees. Yes
terday, more than 1,000 workers went on strike at
the Stanford Hospital because the management

would not give workers job security or a voice in
staffing levels that would improve patient care.
More and more jobs at the hospitals are being

threatened by low-paying subcontractors.
Hennessy maintains that he cannot get involved
because the Medical Center and the University are
separate entities. This is true — they are two dis
tinct non-profit organizations with different pur
poses. Yet, Hennessy neglects to mention that he
supervises the governing committee of the Stan
ford Medical Center, which is comprised of the
CEO of the Stanford Hospital, the CEO of Lucile

Packard Children's Hospital and the dean of the
School of Medicine. Hennessy and members of
t he Board ofTrustees oversaw the selection and

appointment of both CEOs. Stanford Hospital
is also a teaching hospital utilized by the School
of Medicine, a department of the University.

In addition, revenue earned through work
completed in the Stanford Medical Center
helps fund the School of Medicine.

The connections between the University
and the Stanford Medical Center are clear. A code of
conduct should apply to the Stanford Hospital too.

Monitoring the working conditions of every em
ployee on campus is not the responsibility of student
activists. A code of conduct would provide the Univer
sity with a sustained safeguard against labor-related
misconduct on campus. This set of guidelines, creat-

Ed through a democratic process, would clearly de
fine to subcontractors, vendors and the Stanford
Hospitals the types of labor conditions that the Stan
ford community demands from businesses operat-

ing on our campus.
More importantly, this code of conduct
should apply to all workers — whether union,
temporary or part-time and whether in small
contracts or large contracts. Rather than step-

ping away from responsibility, Stanford needs
to willingly use its power to make sure that ev
eryone in the Stanford community enjoys a
decent quality of life. So let's start talking.

For most of the past year, the University has
been grappling with a number of difficult labor
issues. As part of the process, we have solicited
the views of Stanford students, faculty and staff
to develop policies that are fair and equitable.
In considering labor issues, we support the
collective bargaining process, which provides
protections for employees who belong to unions.
For non-union workers, however, we believe a
safety net is required. We are one of the few pri-

vate institutions that has proposed liv-

ing wage guidelines for em-

ployees of subcontractors
— $10.10 per hour for
workers who receive health
benefits; $ 11.35 per hour for
those who receive no health

care coverage.
Fhe Student Labor
Action Coalition has asked the

University to implement a com
prehensive Code of Conduct to
address a wide range of employ
ment issues for companies that

conduct business on the Stanford
campus. As we understand it, this
includes companies that do not
have contracts with the University.

The organization also expressed
concern that the recently adopted
living wage guidelines do not go far
enough and that they were drafted
without "worker or student input."
It is difficult to address a num-

ber of these issues now because we are
still working on the proposed guide
lines. Last month, we met with leaders
of the ASSU and Graduate Student

Council and encouraged them to devel
op a means for gathering student input on

the draft policy. Those comments would sub
sequently be shared with the president and
provost. During that same period, University
President John I lennessy reported on the draft
guidelines to the Faculty Senate and received
feedback from some of its members.
We recently learned that the ASSU and GSC
have decided not to provide student input on
t he draft guidelines. They requested that a steer
ing committee be appointed to address a broad
range of issues regarding a code of conduct and
living wage. We are, instead, willing to hold a
meeting with senior University officials, faculty
and students to discuss the proposed guidelines.
We also continue to welcome input from stu
dents through telephone calls, e-mail and other
means. Also, students should be encouraged to

contact their ASSU and
GSC representatives to
express their opinions
about the new guide
lines.
While our position
on the proposed liv- '
ing wage guidelines
is still evolving, we

operate from a set of basic principles that in some
instances conflict with positions set forth by SI AC.
Regarding concerns about the inclusion of
employees in the policy-drafting process, the
University has a collective bargaining agree
ment with its technical, maintenance and ser
vice employees and meets with their union lead
ership on a regular basis to discuss issues of mu
tual interest that arise under that agreement.
We believe this is the appropriate forum for
these employees to express their concerns and
opinions and to negotiate terms of employment.
Of course, we are also willing to receive input
from all of our employees who wish to commu
nicate with the University, and this includes
their participation in open meetings that are de
signed to receive input and suggestions on the
proposed guidelines.
While the University believes it is appropriate
to set minimum standards for wages of subcon
tracted workers, it does not believe it should play
a role in dictating the detailed terms of employ
ment between a subcontractor and its employees.
The proposed guidelines respect the collec
tive bargaining process for employees repre
sented by a union. We have consistently held the
view that it is inappropriate for the University to
intrude where employees have selected an ex
clusive representative for collective bargaining
purposes, or to second-guess the terms of agree
ments that may be negotiated between employ
ers and the unions.
Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital are separate corpo
rations from the University and from each other.
As a result, the hospitals are legally and function
ally separate entities from the University. Because
they are financially independent and responsible
to their own boards of directors, it would be inap
propriate for die University to dictate either enti
ty's employment or hiring practices.
In proposing living wage guidelines, the
University recognizes that there are economic
challenges involved in working and living in the
Bay Area. Accordingly, we looked to nearby
municipalities that have adopted living wage re
quirements. The standards adopted were guid
ed by the hourly minimums adopted by the City
of San Jose. YVe should note that once these
guidelines become finalized, Stanford would be
one of the few private institutions in the Bay
Area to adopt such policies.
The University realizes that in devising new
labor guidelines and policies, as well as consider
ing alternatives, it must recognize the economic
impact of those decisions — on employees, tu
ition and student aid, among other things. This
is especially true during the difficult economic
times that the University is now facing.
Finally, we have been asked about the num
ber of employees that will be covered by the pro
posed guidelines. This number is difficult to de
termine. Typically, the University requests bids
based on a description of the work to be per
formed, and the bid provides a price to perform
that work without reference to the number of
employees. We estimate, however, that a few
hundred workers will be affected by this policy.
In closing, we want to emphasize our eager
ness to move forward with a policy that will reflect
consideration of many views while providing a

reasonable safety net for non-unionized work
ers at Stanford. We are encouraging every
form of feedback from students and faculty as
we review our proposed living wage policies.

Such feedback is essential, and we hope to
hear from interested students and other
community members in the days ahead.


The ASSU will hold its first Forum on Contem
porary Issues (FOCI) tonight at 7:00 pm in the
Meyer Forum room, focusing on the advantages
and disadvantages of a living wage on Stan
ford's campus. The forum will include Gordon
Earle, John Enyeart, faculty members, students
and workers, representing many viewpoints on
the issue.
