## Card looks to run past Oregon State 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the Cardinal, it now boils
down to ending the season on a
positive note.
At 2-7 (1-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), the Cardinal has no chance
of making a bowl game. I lowever,
winning the last two games of the
season should give the team a
chance to get a running start into
the offseason.
And for the seniors, these are
the last two weeks of their Stanford
careers.
"I'm looking forward to Ore
gon State, the last home game,"
coach Buddy Teevens said. "I
think it has a lot of meaning for our
seniors. Guys continue to push,
continue to play, and that's the
mindset that we are carrying into
the Oregon Suite weekend."
The Oregon State game will be
the final game at Stanford Stadium
for 16 seniors, eight on both sides
of the ball.
"It's a special game, the last
home game for our seniors, and
they want to go out on a positive
note," Teevens said.

For the younger players, end
ing the season on an upbeat note is
also essential going into the winter
and spring workouts.
"The big thing is mindset and
preparation," Teevens said. "I
didn't see anything different than
I've seen all season long, the com
mitment to what we are doing, and
I expect to see that right through
the remainder of the season."
The Cardinal will look to
pound Oregon State (6-4, 2-4 Pac
- 10) with its running game, which is
now fourth in the conference with
141.4 yards per game. Both senior
Kerry Carter and sophomore
Kenneth Tolon have run the ball
well, with Carter starting most of
the games. However, Tolon was
slightly injured in Stanford's loss
to Southern California Saturday.
"He rolled his ankle up, didn't
practice yesterday, pretty much by
design," Teevens said. "I would
anticipate he would be ready to
play and we'll find out a little more
today and expect him to practice
somewhat lightly this afternoon."
