## Card looks to run past Oregon State 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the Cardinal, it now boils
down to ending the season on a
positive note.
At 2-7 (1-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), the Cardinal has no chance
of making a bowl game. I lowever,
winning the last two games of the
season should give the team a
chance to get a running start into
the offseason.
And for the seniors, these are
the last two weeks of their Stanford
careers.
"I'm looking forward to Ore
gon State, the last home game,"
coach Buddy Teevens said. "I
think it has a lot of meaning for our
seniors. Guys continue to push,
continue to play, and that's the
mindset that we are carrying into
the Oregon Suite weekend."
The Oregon State game will be
the final game at Stanford Stadium
for 16 seniors, eight on both sides
of the ball.
"It's a special game, the last
home game for our seniors, and
they want to go out on a positive
note," Teevens said.

For the younger players, end
ing the season on an upbeat note is
also essential going into the winter
and spring workouts.
"The big thing is mindset and
preparation," Teevens said. "I
didn't see anything different than
I've seen all season long, the com
mitment to what we are doing, and
I expect to see that right through
the remainder of the season."
The Cardinal will look to
pound Oregon State (6-4, 2-4 Pac
- 10) with its running game, which is
now fourth in the conference with
141.4 yards per game. Both senior
Kerry Carter and sophomore
Kenneth Tolon have run the ball
well, with Carter starting most of
the games. However, Tolon was
slightly injured in Stanford's loss
to Southern California Saturday.
"He rolled his ankle up, didn't
practice yesterday, pretty much by
design," Teevens said. "I would
anticipate he would be ready to
play and we'll find out a little more
today and expect him to practice
somewhat lightly this afternoon."

is expected to start against the
Beavers, but junior Chris Lewis may
now be healthy enough to come off
the bench during the game.
Matter played his best football
of the season last week, finishing
the first half 14-for-14. However,
with Lewis back from injury, he
will probably get some snaps
throughout the course of the
game, varying up the offensive
scheme.
"They're in a situation where
they're struggling some, as a lot of
us are at this time of year," Ore
gon State coach Dennis Erickson
said. "They're a football team, of
fensively, that has a lot of talent.
They're playing Kyle Matter at

quarterback; I'm not sure who
they're going to start this game,
but they've got some guys who
can play."
Regardless of who starts at
quarterback, the running game is
going to be key for the Cardinal.
"They've run the lootb'all
probably better than most that we
play in our league, with Carter of
fensively," Erickson said.
"They've got some threats at wide
receiver."
On defense, the Cardinal will
have to play without freshman Ju
lian Jenkins, who broke his arm in
the game against USC.
"Jenkins played with [the bro
ken arm] through the late third,
fourth quarter," Teevens said.
"He didn't say much about it —
kind of a stoic individual, he just
went out and kept doing his job.
The game is very, very important

to him. He takes great pride in his
performance and didn't want to
come out. He mentioned it alter
the ballgame."
In spite of the loss of Jenkins,
the Cardinal defense hopes to
bounce back after allowing USC to
score 49 points last Saturday.
"Defensively, they've played
the run real well," Erikson said.
"They're very physical inside —
those are probably the two
biggest things."
However, in the end, it will be
the emotion that will be evident on
Saturday as many Cardinal players
play in front of the home crowd lor
the last time.
"[lt] is always a concern when
you go into an opponents' home
field for the last game for those se
niors who have played there a long
time," Erikson said. "The emotion
al aspect will be there."

receiver."
On defense, the Cardinal will
have to play without freshman Ju
lian Jenkins, who broke his arm in
the game against USC.
"Jenkins played with [the bro
ken arm] through the late third,
fourth quarter," Teevens said.
"He didn't say much about it —
kind of a stoic individual, he just
went out and kept doing his job.
The game is very, very important

to him. He takes great pride in his
performance and didn't want to
come out. He mentioned it alter
the ballgame."
In spite of the loss of Jenkins,
the Cardinal defense hopes to
bounce back after allowing USC to
score 49 points last Saturday.
"Defensively, they've played
the run real well," Erikson said.
"They're very physical inside —
those are probably the two
biggest things."
However, in the end, it will be
the emotion that will be evident on
Saturday as many Cardinal players
play in front of the home crowd lor
the last time.
"[lt] is always a concern when
you go into an opponents' home
field for the last game for those se
niors who have played there a long
time," Erikson said. "The emotion
al aspect will be there."
For the Cardinal, it now boils
down to ending the season on a
positive note.
At 2-7 (1-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), the Cardinal has no chance
of making a bowl game. I lowever,
winning the last two games of the
season should give the team a
chance to get a running start into
the offseason.
And for the seniors, these are
the last two weeks of their Stanford
careers.
"I'm looking forward to Ore
gon State, the last home game,"
coach Buddy Teevens said. "I
think it has a lot of meaning for our
seniors. Guys continue to push,
continue to play, and that's the
mindset that we are carrying into
the Oregon Suite weekend."
The Oregon State game will be
the final game at Stanford Stadium
for 16 seniors, eight on both sides
of the ball.
"It's a special game, the last
home game for our seniors, and
they want to go out on a positive
note," Teevens said.

For the younger players, end
ing the season on an upbeat note is
also essential going into the winter
and spring workouts.
"The big thing is mindset and
preparation," Teevens said. "I
didn't see anything different than
I've seen all season long, the com
mitment to what we are doing, and
I expect to see that right through
the remainder of the season."
The Cardinal will look to
pound Oregon State (6-4, 2-4 Pac
- 10) with its running game, which is
now fourth in the conference with
141.4 yards per game. Both senior
Kerry Carter and sophomore
Kenneth Tolon have run the ball
well, with Carter starting most of
the games. However, Tolon was
slightly injured in Stanford's loss
to Southern California Saturday.
"He rolled his ankle up, didn't
practice yesterday, pretty much by
design," Teevens said. "I would
anticipate he would be ready to
play and we'll find out a little more
today and expect him to practice
somewhat lightly this afternoon."
Redshirt freshman Kvle Matter

Freshman quarterback Kyle Matter executes a play against USC last Satur
day. Matter and the Cardinal will take their running game, ranked fourth in
the Pac-10, into their last home game this weekend against Oregon State.
is expected to start against the
Beavers, but junior Chris Lewis may
now be healthy enough to come off
the bench during the game.
Matter played his best football
of the season last week, finishing
the first half 14-for-14. However,
with Lewis back from injury, he
will probably get some snaps
throughout the course of the
game, varying up the offensive
scheme.
"They're in a situation where
they're struggling some, as a lot of
us are at this time of year," Ore
gon State coach Dennis Erickson
said. "They're a football team, of
fensively, that has a lot of talent.
They're playing Kyle Matter at

quarterback; I'm not sure who
they're going to start this game,
but they've got some guys who
can play."
Regardless of who starts at
quarterback, the running game is
going to be key for the Cardinal.
"They've run the lootb'all
probably better than most that we
play in our league, with Carter of
fensively," Erickson said.
"They've got some threats at wide
receiver."
