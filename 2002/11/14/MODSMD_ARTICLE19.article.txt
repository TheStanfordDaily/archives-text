Stanford beat out Washington for
the first time ever in the women's open
eight event at the I lead of the Lake re
gatta in Seattle, Wash., and did so with
a resounding 14-second margin.
"It was tough to go up there and win
on the Washington home course," said
head coach Aimee Baker. Conditions
over the weekend were fairly good:
cold with (lat water and a slight wind.
"The conditions were not really a
factor at all," Baker said. The Cardinal
A boat began in second position behind
Washington and started the course 10
seconds after the lead boat. Varsity
stroke Sabrina Kolker said that the boat
started at 34 strokes per minute and
settled to a 32 pace for the rest of the
race. Stanford A maintained position
but didn't move on the Huskies as the
course wound through Lake Union
and into Portage Bay.
Baker said that from her vantage
point on a bridge at the halfway mark,
Stanford seemed to have fallen back
three seconds. "There was a 13 second
gap between Washington and Stanford
at the halfway point with three lengths
of open water," Baker said. "From t he
bridge at halfway, at the 2,000 meter
mark, I could see Stanford slowly dos
ing the gap."
In the boat, Kolker said the water

got rough, buffeting the shell as the
Cardinal came around the Montlake
Cut in front of the Huskies' stadium.
"It was like a gauntlet, but the team
handled it really well," she said.
The Cardinal gained momentum
and began narrowing Washington's
lead coming out of the Montlake Cut
and into calmer water, she said.
"As soon as we hit good water wejust
flew," Kolker said. The Cardinal's ini
tial momentum increased as the Stan
ford A boat realized it was closing in on
the Huskies. With 1,000 meters to go,
Stanford A had closed enough to hear
the voice of the Washington coxswain.
"You could definitely hear them.
The whole boat heard it," Kolker said.
"There's nothing like catching a boat."
With the boats coming to the 180-
degree turn in Union Bay, Washington
was still ahead, but its lead was ever
dwindling. Wendy Hoeveler, coxswain
for the Stanford A boat, took the sharp
turn close to the course buoys, posi
tioning the Cardinal for the last 750-
meter push to the finish.
"At that point Wendy was like, 'we're
right there!' " Kolker said. "The UW
coxswain was looking back, because
they know you're closing in."
Stanford maintained its momentum
advantage, overtaking Washington
and finishing in a final time of 16 min
utes 57 seconds. The following teams
were Washington (17:11), Oregon

State (17:14) Washington State (17:15),
Michigan State (17:23) and Texas
(17:29).
"It's just so nice when the training
pays off," Kolker said. "This just gives
us the motivation to push for more."
In the women's second varsity race,
Stanford came in sixth with a time of
18:11, behind Lake Washington, just
three seconds away from third place in
the tight finish. Washington won with a
time of 17:50.

"[The second varsity boat] was more
competitive than [it] has ever been in
the race," Baker said.
The victory at I lead of the Lake will
help motivate the team during winter
training as they prepare for the sprint
races in the spring.
"It's good to compete and let every
body know we were in with the top
teams," Baker said. "This is a fun thing
but our real focus is on NCAA in the
spring."
