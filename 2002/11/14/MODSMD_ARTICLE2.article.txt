On Tuesday night, the Menlo Park City Council
approved the widening of Sand Hill Road in a three
to two vote. According to Larry Horton, the Universi
ty's director of government and community relations,
this vote is the last major approval required fora con
struction project that was first proposed a decade ago.
"The expansion will provide a cure for one of the
most notorious [traffic] bottlenecks in the Bay Area,"
Horton said.
The proposal had met with staunch opposition
due to its impact on the Stanford Golf Course and on
the habitat of San Francisquito Creek.
Sand Hill Road, which often suffers from heavy
congestion during peak traffic hours, currendy nar
rows from four to two lanes as it crosses San Francis
quito Creek. The approved plans call for expanding
this bridge to four lanes.
The project also involves work at two nearby inter
sections — one at Sand Hill Road and Santa Cruz Av
enue, the other at Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Alpine Road — as well as creating a 16-foot-wide trail
south of Sand Hill Road through the Stanford Golf
Course. The project's cost is estimated to be $12 mil
lion and will be paid entirely by the University.
"The University needed to expand the road in
order to address concerns about [traffic] circulation
around the Medical Center, shopping center and [the
west] side of campus," Horton said.
He noted that the widening was initially proposed

as part of a larger project in 1992. That project will
continue to receive funding from the expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center and the construction of a
senior housing project and of Stanford West housing.
