### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Tuesday night, the Menlo Park City Council
approved the widening of Sand Hill Road in a three
to two vote. According to Larry Horton, the Universi
ty's director of government and community relations,
this vote is the last major approval required fora con
struction project that was first proposed a decade ago.
"The expansion will provide a cure for one of the
most notorious [traffic] bottlenecks in the Bay Area,"
Horton said.
The proposal had met with staunch opposition
due to its impact on the Stanford Golf Course and on
the habitat of San Francisquito Creek.
Sand Hill Road, which often suffers from heavy
congestion during peak traffic hours, currendy nar
rows from four to two lanes as it crosses San Francis
quito Creek. The approved plans call for expanding
this bridge to four lanes.
The project also involves work at two nearby inter
sections — one at Sand Hill Road and Santa Cruz Av
enue, the other at Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Alpine Road — as well as creating a 16-foot-wide trail
south of Sand Hill Road through the Stanford Golf
Course. The project's cost is estimated to be $12 mil
lion and will be paid entirely by the University.
"The University needed to expand the road in
order to address concerns about [traffic] circulation
around the Medical Center, shopping center and [the
west] side of campus," Horton said.
He noted that the widening was initially proposed

as part of a larger project in 1992. That project will
continue to receive funding from the expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center and the construction of a
senior housing project and of Stanford West housing.

strong support from Menlo Park residents at previous

city council meetings, it also at
tracted criticism for its impact on
San Francisquito Creek and its al
teration of the 70-year-old golf
course.
"We felt like we had exhausted
all the alternatives," said Menlo
Park Mayor Stephen Schmidt.
" The thoroughfare was going to
be widened eventually, so we
thought that it would be best if a
progressive [city] council ap
proved it."
Schmidt described the final plan
as a compromise between Menlo
Park and the University, noting
that the council was able to include
"strong financial protection and
bike and pedestrian safety."
"We did a reasonable job of
protecting the Stanford Golf
Course," he added.
Tuesday night's decision fol

lowed a council vote on Sept. 24 to
approve the proposal pending a
report from the city attorney —
which was published on Nov. 7 —
addressing further environmental
and legal issues. Schmidt and
council members Charles Kinney
and Nicholas Jellins voted to give
the expansion final approval,
while council members Paul Col
lacchi and Mary Jo Borak voted
against it.
Neither Collacchi nor Borak
could be reached for comment.
Schmidt said that their earlier crit
icisms led to many of the revisions
included in the current plan.
The expansion falls under
three jurisdictions: Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and San Mateo Coun
ty. Palo Alto approved the project
in 1997, and, although the pro
posal has yet to go before the coun
ty's board of supervisors, Horton
predicts that their approval will
come soon. Construction will
begin in 2004 and is projected to
conclude two years later.
