# Volleyball on fire, takes No. 1 ranking
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's hard to imagine having a
nine-day stretch better than the
one the Stanford women's volley
ball team had ending Sunday. In
just over a week, the Cardinal
picked up five wins against ranked
opponents, knocked off two differ
ent No. 1 teams on the road and re
turned to the top of the polls for the
first time since early September.
But even though its 3-2 win at

then-No. 1 Southern California on
Nov. 2 and its sweep at then-No. 1
Hawaii in front of over 10,000 on
Sunday might suggest that the
now-No. 1 Cardinal is ready for
the NCAA tournament to start,
Stanford coach John Dunning still
sees plenty of room for improve
ment for the defending national
champions.
"We have some more real seri
ous work we need to do in the next
two weeks," said Dunning, last
year's National Coach of the Year.
That the Cardinal (24-3, 13-2
Pacific-10 Conference) is still a
work in progress is a scary thought
for Stanford's four remaining op
ponents, especially No. 22 Wash
ington (15-8, 7-7) and No. 17
Washington State (17-7, 7-7),
which will host Stanford on Friday
and Saturday, respectively.
Stanford already creamed the
Huskies and the Cougars earlier
this season, sweeping both teams
at home last month — the possibil
ity that the Cardinal is even better
come the second meetings seems

to make the results a forgone con
clusion.
That is certainly not the ap
proach the Stanford women are
taking, however, as they travel
north to face a pair of teams trying
to shore up their bids for the
NCAA tournament, and possibly
even earn the right to host in the
early rounds.
"The matches will revolve a lot
around the last matches we
played," Dunning said. "We beat
both pretty easily. I remember
looking at their coaches' faces, and
they didn't look happy at all.
"Playing on their court, it will be
different. It won't be worse than
playing at USC or in front of
10,000 at Hawaii, but it will still be
a battle. Our goal has been to be
road warriors, and we have to go
through Washington to achieve
that goal."
Both Washington schools will
need to put up their biggest efforts
of the year to win those battles,
though.
The Stanford attack was on fire
this past weekend, averaging 19
kills per game while hitting a .358
clip in sweeping No. 16 Arizona
and No. 23 Arizona State before
shocking the Wahinein Honolulu.

picking up 19 kills.

on the attack, giving the team
plenty of confidence that its work

"John does a great job at mak
ing us work on specifics in order
to improve our game," junior set

ways try to execute on really
small things that end up making
a big difference. We did a great
job with that on offense this week
end, and we're just going to keep
working on the small things on
defense."
Washington's offense has been
hot lately too, as outside hitters
Paige Benjamin and Sonja Toma
sevic form the most prolific attack
ing pair in the Pac-10 with 8.92
kills per game. The two racked up
27 kills with only seven errors in
Stanford's 3-0 win over the
Huskies on Oct. 18, but the pair
will need support from the rest of
the roster going up against Stan
ford's conference-leading block.

The Huskies' best hope is to use
a strong serve — Washington
leads the conference with 1.94 aces
per game — to throw off the Stan
ford attack, although the Cardi
nal's passing has been as steady as
ever lately.
"Each individual aspect is get
ting pretty good, so as long as we
play as a team, we're going to do
well," said freshman libera Court
ney Schultz, who has been Stan
lord's opponents' primary serving
target. "We have a lot of confi
dence, but we know every team we
play is dangerous. We have to take
every game seriously, not just the
ones against No. 1 teams."
Washington State is going to
have to find a way to beat the Stan
ford net game that stuffed them 18
times in the teams' first meeting on
Oct. 17. The Cougars could only
muster a .087 hitting percentage
in that 3-0 loss.
Stanford is currently one game
behind USC in the Pac-10 stand

"John does a great job at mak
ing us work on specifics in order
to improve our game," junior set
ter Anna Robinsort said. "W r e al
ways try to execute on really
small things that end up making
a big difference. We did a great
job with that on offense this week
end, and we're just going to keep
working on the small things on
defense."
Washington's offense has been
hot lately too, as outside hitters
Paige Benjamin and Sonja Toma
sevic form the most prolific attack
ing pair in the Pac-10 with 8.92
kills per game. The two racked up
27 kills with only seven errors in
Stanford's 3-0 win over the
Huskies on Oct. 18, but the pair
will need support from the rest of
the roster going up against Stan
ford's conference-leading block.

The Huskies' best hope is to use
a strong serve — Washington
leads the conference with 1.94 aces
per game — to throw off the Stan
ford attack, although the Cardi
nal's passing has been as steady as
ever lately.
"Each individual aspect is get
ting pretty good, so as long as we
play as a team, we're going to do
well," said freshman libera Court
ney Schultz, who has been Stan
lord's opponents' primary serving
target. "We have a lot of confi
dence, but we know every team we
play is dangerous. We have to take
every game seriously, not just the
ones against No. 1 teams."
Washington State is going to
have to find a way to beat the Stan
ford net game that stuffed them 18
times in the teams' first meeting on
Oct. 17. The Cougars could only
muster a .087 hitting percentage
in that 3-0 loss.
Stanford is currently one game
behind USC in the Pac-10 stand
ings with three games to play. The
Trojans face crosstown rival No.
19 UCLA this weekend.
It's hard to imagine having a
nine-day stretch better than the
one the Stanford women's volley
ball team had ending Sunday. In
just over a week, the Cardinal
picked up five wins against ranked
opponents, knocked off two differ
ent No. 1 teams on the road and re
turned to the top of the polls for the
first time since early September.
But even though its 3-2 win at

then-No. 1 Southern California on
Nov. 2 and its sweep at then-No. 1
Hawaii in front of over 10,000 on
Sunday might suggest that the
now-No. 1 Cardinal is ready for
the NCAA tournament to start,
Stanford coach John Dunning still
sees plenty of room for improve
ment for the defending national
champions.
"We have some more real seri
ous work we need to do in the next
two weeks," said Dunning, last
year's National Coach of the Year.
That the Cardinal (24-3, 13-2
Pacific-10 Conference) is still a
work in progress is a scary thought
for Stanford's four remaining op
ponents, especially No. 22 Wash
ington (15-8, 7-7) and No. 17
Washington State (17-7, 7-7),
which will host Stanford on Friday
and Saturday, respectively.
Stanford already creamed the
Huskies and the Cougars earlier
this season, sweeping both teams
at home last month — the possibil
ity that the Cardinal is even better
come the second meetings seems

to make the results a forgone con
clusion.
That is certainly not the ap
proach the Stanford women are
taking, however, as they travel
north to face a pair of teams trying
to shore up their bids for the
NCAA tournament, and possibly
even earn the right to host in the
early rounds.
"The matches will revolve a lot
around the last matches we
played," Dunning said. "We beat
both pretty easily. I remember
looking at their coaches' faces, and
they didn't look happy at all.
"Playing on their court, it will be
different. It won't be worse than
playing at USC or in front of
10,000 at Hawaii, but it will still be
a battle. Our goal has been to be
road warriors, and we have to go
through Washington to achieve
that goal."
Both Washington schools will
need to put up their biggest efforts
of the year to win those battles,
though.
