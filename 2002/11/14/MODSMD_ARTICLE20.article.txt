# Volleyball on fire, takes No. 1 ranking
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It's hard to imagine having a
nine-day stretch better than the
one the Stanford women's volley
ball team had ending Sunday. In
just over a week, the Cardinal
picked up five wins against ranked
opponents, knocked off two differ
ent No. 1 teams on the road and re
turned to the top of the polls for the
first time since early September.
But even though its 3-2 win at

then-No. 1 Southern California on
Nov. 2 and its sweep at then-No. 1
Hawaii in front of over 10,000 on
Sunday might suggest that the
now-No. 1 Cardinal is ready for
the NCAA tournament to start,
Stanford coach John Dunning still
sees plenty of room for improve
ment for the defending national
champions.
"We have some more real seri
ous work we need to do in the next
two weeks," said Dunning, last
year's National Coach of the Year.
That the Cardinal (24-3, 13-2
Pacific-10 Conference) is still a
work in progress is a scary thought
for Stanford's four remaining op
ponents, especially No. 22 Wash
ington (15-8, 7-7) and No. 17
Washington State (17-7, 7-7),
which will host Stanford on Friday
and Saturday, respectively.
Stanford already creamed the
Huskies and the Cougars earlier
this season, sweeping both teams
at home last month â€” the possibil
ity that the Cardinal is even better
come the second meetings seems

to make the results a forgone con
clusion.
That is certainly not the ap
proach the Stanford women are
taking, however, as they travel
north to face a pair of teams trying
to shore up their bids for the
NCAA tournament, and possibly
even earn the right to host in the
early rounds.
"The matches will revolve a lot
around the last matches we
played," Dunning said. "We beat
both pretty easily. I remember
looking at their coaches' faces, and
they didn't look happy at all.
"Playing on their court, it will be
different. It won't be worse than
playing at USC or in front of
10,000 at Hawaii, but it will still be
a battle. Our goal has been to be
road warriors, and we have to go
through Washington to achieve
that goal."
Both Washington schools will
need to put up their biggest efforts
of the year to win those battles,
though.
The Stanford attack was on fire
this past weekend, averaging 19
kills per game while hitting a .358
clip in sweeping No. 16 Arizona
and No. 23 Arizona State before
shocking the Wahinein Honolulu.
Three-time Ail-American out
side hitter Logan Tom had 44 kills
in the Arizona matches, and All-
American sophomore outside hit

guably the biggest night of her ca
reer at Hawaii, hitting at .630 in
picking up 19 kills.
The offensive outburst came
after a week of practices focused
on the attack, giving the team
plenty of confidence that its work
