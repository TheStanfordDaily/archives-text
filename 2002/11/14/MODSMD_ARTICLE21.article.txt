Having grown up a Maryland
Terrapins fan, the image of
Juan Dixon tossing the ball to
ward the Georgia Dome roof
after the Terps knocked off Indiana for
their first national title last March is still
pleasantly fresh in my mind.
As is CBS's cheesy musical tribute to
the tournament, "One Shining Mo
ment," which happens to be track 4 — as
in Final Four — on my mix CD of choice
these days.
Yes, Fm a Stanford basketball fan too,
so don't hate. I just thought I'd spare you
the sadness that would come with reliving
memories of the Cardinal's season to
segue this column. That Casey guy left,
right?

While March Mad
ness is still four months
away, November Nutti
ness — which includes
preseason tourna
ments and exhibition
games against ridicu
lously named teams
and sometimes even
more ridiculously look-

ing players — has arrived.
The granddaddy of exhibition teams,
the Harlem Globetrotters, currently
made up of quasi-notable-former-NBA
players such as Olden Polynice and
Cedric Ceballos of blindfolded dunking
