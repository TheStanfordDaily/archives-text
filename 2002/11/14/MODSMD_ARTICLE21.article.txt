# Let's get to the real stuff

### 
Having grown up a Maryland
Terrapins fan, the image of
Juan Dixon tossing the ball to
ward the Georgia Dome roof
after the Terps knocked off Indiana for
their first national title last March is still
pleasantly fresh in my mind.
As is CBS's cheesy musical tribute to
the tournament, "One Shining Mo
ment," which happens to be track 4 — as
in Final Four — on my mix CD of choice
these days.
Yes, Fm a Stanford basketball fan too,
so don't hate. I just thought I'd spare you
the sadness that would come with reliving
memories of the Cardinal's season to
segue this column. That Casey guy left,
right?

While March Mad
ness is still four months
away, November Nutti
ness — which includes
preseason tourna
ments and exhibition
games against ridicu
lously named teams
and sometimes even
more ridiculously look-

ing players — has arrived.
The granddaddy of exhibition teams,
the Harlem Globetrotters, currently
made up of quasi-notable-former-NBA
players such as Olden Polynice and
Cedric Ceballos of blindfolded dunking


Scott Allen
faine as well as not-so-notable Cal
grad Solomon Hughes, took on
the Terps Tuesday night.
After my dose of Maryland bas
ketball on ESPN2 (I taped the
game in case you missed it), 1 dou
bled my exhibition fun by watch
ing Stanford take on the Olympic
Club team at Maples Pavilion.
Julius Barnes and Co. eventu
ally pulled away from the group
of no-names, save Kris Weems,
but Arizona might as well have
been on the opposing bench judg
ing by the way Monty was banging
the scorer's table and riding the
officials. It was beautiful.
Two different female friends,
both Sixth Man Club members,
also repeatedly pointed out to me
throughout the game the accu
mulation of sweat on the Olympic
Club players'jerseys and an eval
uation of the attractiveness, not
skills, of the freshman recruits.

I'hese are the types of things that
don't show up in the box score.
Exhibition excitement is not
unique to Stanford, as the rest of
the Pac-10 is getting in on the
party as well.
Six Pac-10 teams have a date
with the EA Sports All-Stars as
part of their early season slate. I
have to admit, I'm always a little
surprised to see EA Sports get
blown out because on paper, or
PC, or X-Box, they seem to have
the edge.
What prevents them from uti
lizing the "Create a Player" fea
ture to put five guys on the floor
with Yao Ming's size, Allen Iver
son's quickness and 99 player rat
ings across the board?
As much fun as it is to mock the
40-year-old, 5-foot-nothing dude
with the receding hair line and
white high tops in some exhibi
tion games, I'm all for putting a
Playstation 2 and a big screen TV
at mid-court and having the EA
All-Stars and their opponent bat
tle it out in arcade mode.
You could turn the crowd vol

ume down in (lie game, and the
Sixtli Man Club could provide the
excitement, because, after all, if
it's in the game, it's in the game.
Meanwhile, the Trojans sched
uled two fierce battles with the L.A.
City All-Stars 2, and, as you might
have guessed, the L.A. City All-
Stars 1. I'm guessing it's a junior
varsity and varsity kind of deal, sort
of like the Clippers and Lakers.
With star Sam Clancy depart
ed for the NBA, USC coach
Henry Bibby wanted to schedule
the L.A. City All-Stars 7 for the
regular season, but that didn't go
over to well with the NCAA com
mittee, so he settled fora home
game against Morris Brown in
stead.
Preseason No. 1 Arizona is tak
ing the all-commercial approach,
with EA and Team Nike headed
to Tucson. Dickie V sweats the
'Cats so much I'm surprised
Team ESPN isn't on the schedule.
Washington State takes on
Lewis-Clark State and the Basket
ball Travelers, two teams that are
ext remely well traveled, to say the

least. Lewis-Clark State's nick
name must be the Explorers,
right? Wrong. The Lewiston,
Idaho, school — whose mission is
"to connect people with learning
and learning with their world" —
is known as the Warriors.
While the Warriors won't be
coming to Maples, and the Stan
ford men's exhibition season is al
ready over, the Cardinal women's
is not.
After opening against the 2000
Spike Lee joint "Love and Basket
ball" (Omar Epps was nowhere to
be seen), the women face Team
Concept, a group of basketball
players who had the notion to
form a team, tonight.
And then, let the regular sea
son begin.

Scott Allen is an undeclared soplw
more currently starting at point guard
for Team Robinson, which Jell to Palo
Alto High School's junior varsity girl's
team 26-24 in a hotly contested exhibi
tion match two days ago. E-mail him
some shooting tips at ssallen@stan
ford.edu.

After opening against the 2000
Spike Lee joint "Love and Basket
ball" (Omar Epps was nowhere to
be seen), the women face Team
Concept, a group of basketball
players who had the notion to
form a team, tonight.
And then, let the regular sea
son begin.

Scott Allen is an undeclared soplw
more currently starting at point guard
for Team Robinson, which Jell to Palo
Alto High School's junior varsity girl's
team 26-24 in a hotly contested exhibi
tion match two days ago. E-mail him
some shooting tips at ssallen@stan

Having grown up a Maryland
Terrapins fan, the image of
Juan Dixon tossing the ball to
ward the Georgia Dome roof
after the Terps knocked off Indiana for
their first national title last March is still
pleasantly fresh in my mind.
As is CBS's cheesy musical tribute to
the tournament, "One Shining Mo
ment," which happens to be track 4 — as
in Final Four — on my mix CD of choice
these days.
Yes, Fm a Stanford basketball fan too,
so don't hate. I just thought I'd spare you
the sadness that would come with reliving
memories of the Cardinal's season to
segue this column. That Casey guy left,
right?

While March Mad
ness is still four months
away, November Nutti
ness — which includes
preseason tourna
ments and exhibition
games against ridicu
lously named teams
and sometimes even
more ridiculously look-

ing players — has arrived.
The granddaddy of exhibition teams,
the Harlem Globetrotters, currently
made up of quasi-notable-former-NBA
players such as Olden Polynice and
Cedric Ceballos of blindfolded dunking


Scott Allen
faine as well as not-so-notable Cal
grad Solomon Hughes, took on
the Terps Tuesday night.
After my dose of Maryland bas
ketball on ESPN2 (I taped the
game in case you missed it), 1 dou
bled my exhibition fun by watch
ing Stanford take on the Olympic
Club team at Maples Pavilion.
Julius Barnes and Co. eventu
ally pulled away from the group
of no-names, save Kris Weems,
but Arizona might as well have
been on the opposing bench judg
ing by the way Monty was banging
the scorer's table and riding the
officials. It was beautiful.
Two different female friends,
both Sixth Man Club members,
also repeatedly pointed out to me
throughout the game the accu
mulation of sweat on the Olympic
Club players'jerseys and an eval
uation of the attractiveness, not
skills, of the freshman recruits.

I'hese are the types of things that
don't show up in the box score.
Exhibition excitement is not
unique to Stanford, as the rest of
the Pac-10 is getting in on the
party as well.
Six Pac-10 teams have a date
with the EA Sports All-Stars as
part of their early season slate. I
have to admit, I'm always a little
surprised to see EA Sports get
blown out because on paper, or
PC, or X-Box, they seem to have
the edge.
What prevents them from uti
lizing the "Create a Player" fea
ture to put five guys on the floor
with Yao Ming's size, Allen Iver
son's quickness and 99 player rat
ings across the board?
As much fun as it is to mock the
40-year-old, 5-foot-nothing dude
with the receding hair line and
white high tops in some exhibi
tion games, I'm all for putting a
Playstation 2 and a big screen TV
at mid-court and having the EA
All-Stars and their opponent bat
tle it out in arcade mode.
You could turn the crowd vol

ume down in (lie game, and the
Sixtli Man Club could provide the
excitement, because, after all, if
it's in the game, it's in the game.
Meanwhile, the Trojans sched
uled two fierce battles with the L.A.
City All-Stars 2, and, as you might
have guessed, the L.A. City All-
Stars 1. I'm guessing it's a junior
varsity and varsity kind of deal, sort
of like the Clippers and Lakers.
With star Sam Clancy depart
ed for the NBA, USC coach
Henry Bibby wanted to schedule
the L.A. City All-Stars 7 for the
regular season, but that didn't go
over to well with the NCAA com
mittee, so he settled fora home
game against Morris Brown in
stead.
Preseason No. 1 Arizona is tak
ing the all-commercial approach,
with EA and Team Nike headed
to Tucson. Dickie V sweats the
'Cats so much I'm surprised
Team ESPN isn't on the schedule.
Washington State takes on
Lewis-Clark State and the Basket
ball Travelers, two teams that are
ext remely well traveled, to say the

least. Lewis-Clark State's nick
name must be the Explorers,
right? Wrong. The Lewiston,
Idaho, school — whose mission is
"to connect people with learning
and learning with their world" —
is known as the Warriors.
While the Warriors won't be
coming to Maples, and the Stan
ford men's exhibition season is al
ready over, the Cardinal women's
is not.
