# GOP majoritry spells doom for our pro athletes
## 
### 
As the midterm election results poured in last
week, Republicans feasted in celebration, De
mocrats cried in despair, and Green Party
members awoke from that quasi-perpetual
state of self-delusion to realize that three hasn't been
company since hot pants went out of style.
Hut forgotten in that oh-so-predictable maelstrom of
perpetual incumbency were the athletes â€” those hard-

working, self-sacrificing pillars of soci
ety upon whom we entrust countless
hours of weekend entertainment, and
upon whom we blame coundess acts of
random drunken mob violence. Look
ing back on a weekend in which the Re
publicans took control of the House,
the Senate and the near entirety of the
joke lineup on the Daily Show, how will
this political swing affect the athletes

that we hold near and dear to our hearts?
The general sentiment was rather downtrodden this
week at the Major League Baseball offices as they
learned that the new government was putting into place
the "Family Values" legislation package that would ban
the use of baseball bats because they "too closely resem
ble a male phallus, thus imparting evil thoughts such as
sex and / or rock and roll into the impressionable minds
of our 19- and 20-year-olds." The league has several
backups in the planning stage for next season, but the
one gathering the early support was to use wooden carv

choice, as nothing about him could be construed as male.
Besides, what guy hasn't wanted to throw a fastball at his
face at some point in their lives?
Despite the new legislation, Alex Rodriguez was quite
ecstatic with the results of the election. The new tax plan
sought by President Bush, the former owner of A-rod's
current team, is structured in such a way that Ro
driguez's $252 million salary will effectively not be taxed
but actually earn interest. The money to cover this inter
est expense for the government will come by way of
transferring lunch money from poor school districts and
inner-city hospitals and putting it into the "Fund for
(iuys who can Express llieit Salaries as Percentages of a
Billion Dollars."
The initial happiness A-rod experienced as a result of
this policy shift was short-lived however. It was discov
ered by the new powers that be that Rodriguez is a name
often associated with Latinos, and they decided that even
if he worked as both a roofer and a gardener, A-rod still
could not have made that much money legitimately. He
is now on death row in Texas, along with Ivan Ro
driguez, Chi-Chi Rodriguez and Rod Woodson, who
