# GOP majoritry spells doom for our pro athletes
## 
### 
As the midterm election results poured in last
week, Republicans feasted in celebration, De
mocrats cried in despair, and Green Party
members awoke from that quasi-perpetual
state of self-delusion to realize that three hasn't been
company since hot pants went out of style.
Hut forgotten in that oh-so-predictable maelstrom of
perpetual incumbency were the athletes — those hard-

working, self-sacrificing pillars of soci
ety upon whom we entrust countless
hours of weekend entertainment, and
upon whom we blame coundess acts of
random drunken mob violence. Look
ing back on a weekend in which the Re
publicans took control of the House,
the Senate and the near entirety of the
joke lineup on the Daily Show, how will
this political swing affect the athletes

that we hold near and dear to our hearts?
The general sentiment was rather downtrodden this
week at the Major League Baseball offices as they
learned that the new government was putting into place
the "Family Values" legislation package that would ban
the use of baseball bats because they "too closely resem
ble a male phallus, thus imparting evil thoughts such as
sex and / or rock and roll into the impressionable minds
of our 19- and 20-year-olds." The league has several
backups in the planning stage for next season, but the
one gathering the early support was to use wooden carv
ings of Leonardo DiCaprio as the hitting instrument of
choice, as nothing about him could be construed as male.
Besides, what guy hasn't wanted to throw a fastball at his
face at some point in their lives?
Despite the new legislation, Alex Rodriguez was quite
ecstatic with the results of the election. The new tax plan
sought by President Bush, the former owner of A-rod's
current team, is structured in such a way that Ro
driguez's $252 million salary will effectively not be taxed
but actually earn interest. The money to cover this inter
est expense for the government will come by way of
transferring lunch money from poor school districts and
inner-city hospitals and putting it into the "Fund for
(iuys who can Express llieit Salaries as Percentages of a
Billion Dollars."
The initial happiness A-rod experienced as a result of
this policy shift was short-lived however. It was discov
ered by the new powers that be that Rodriguez is a name
often associated with Latinos, and they decided that even
if he worked as both a roofer and a gardener, A-rod still
could not have made that much money legitimately. He
is now on death row in Texas, along with Ivan Ro
driguez, Chi-Chi Rodriguez and Rod Woodson, who

kind of looks Latino if you squint
one eye and cock your head a little.
Similar disappointment was felt
throughout the NBA, as many of
today's newest stars received letters
telling them that under article V,
section 111 of the soon to be enacted
Super-Duper Patriot Act, all basket
ball players of foreign birth shall be
henceforth banned 112 rom playing in
the NBA. While foreign-born play
ers such as Peja Stojakavic, Vlade
Divac and Yao Ming were disap
pointed by the new development,
they expressed outright shock over
the provision of the act that called
for their immediate internment
without trial into a prison camp in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until the
war against "terra" has come to a
conclusion. The imprisoned players
glared jealously at 112 ellow foreigners
Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and
Steve Nash of Canada who were ex
empted from the legislation thanks
to the "You're OK Because You're
County is Pretty Much Like Ours"
clause.
Many athletes were also disap
pointed to learn of impending legis
lation entitled the "That Damn
Tiger Woods Done Gone and
Taken Over Golf From Decent
Folk" statute that will penalize any
transgressor who changes the status
quo racial ratio of sporting profes
sions. The new Congress plans to
make the act retroactive so that re
cent violators of the act — such as
Notre Dame's Ty Willingham,

every black NFL quarterback and
the Central Hockey League's
newest star Manute 80l (yes, the
same Manute 801. He's playing
hockey now. Ice hockey. Seriously.
I've made up a lotofstuffin this col
umn, but this is the most ridiculous
statement yet, and it's legit) — can
be punished for "takin' hard earned
money out o' the hands of honest,
God-fearin' (oik".
But not all the news of the elec
tions was bad for athletes. Many
planned parties to celebrate the fact
that the Republican Congress will
allow every athlete to carry "two
concealed handguns and a sub-ma
chine Uzi" with them at all times,
thus eliminating the need lor body
guards and allowing fora handy
way to deal with those pesky pater
nity suits.
Even though only about 8 per
cent of Americans actually care
enough about midterm elections to
put clown the cheeseburger, turn
off Springer and go to the polls, they
have a profound effect on the way
we live our lives. More importantly,
they affect the way we live our lives
vicariously through the professional
athletes with beautiful wives, even
more beautiful mistresses and piles
of money.
I fere's hoping that compassion
ate conservatism in Washington
brings hardcore extremism on the
field.
