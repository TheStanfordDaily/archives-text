# Card basketball teams face loss of last year's stars
## A
						rebuilt mens team is committed to restoring past glory

There are no stars anymore.
No preseason All-America can
didates.
No early NBA draft specula
tors.
And there are no high expecta
tions anymore either â€” well, at
least from the outside anyway.
For the unranked Stanford
men's basketball team, it's a com
pletely different season now with a
not so different theme.
Now the team stands waist deep
in the aftermath of Casey Jacobsen
and Curtis Borchardt's early de
parture for the NBA, yet the Car
dinal still finds itself in the same
thematic struggle that it was
plagued by last year, the same tug
of-war battle between tradition
and self.
Last year, the preseason specu
lation hinged on whether or not
the Cardinal could pull it together
in the absence of the Collins twins
and remain a contender on the na
tional level. Speculators this year
question whether or not Stanford
should even be judged on a na
tional scale.
"The only bad thing about not
having the big marquee names is
that you don't get the preseason

attention that you're accustomed
to," said sophomore center Rob
Little. "It's tough losing those guys
to the NBA, but that's what basket
ball's all about. But my hope for
the season is that we can be con
tenders in the [Pacific-10 Confer
ence] and hopefully return this
team back to the status quo of
being a national powerhouse."
Regardless of outsider expecta
tions, Stanford enters the season
more united than ever, more com
mitted to team play than ever and
more intent upon returning to the
national prominence it boasted
just three years ago, which now
seems so far away.
At the end of last year's season,
the remaining Cardinal players
knew that there would have to be a
renewed emphasis on team play
due to the exit of Jacobsen and
Borchardt, and consequently a
large contingent of the squad
opted to stay on campus during
the summer.
"Our guys said, 'Let's stay to
gether in the summer, establish a
core and get this team back to
where it needs to be,"' said head
coach Mike Montgomery.
And so they did, and the result
is a basketball team that is much
closer.
"When you have everybody to
gether during the off-season, and
you can see how hard they are
working, there's a lot of team
bonding that occurs," said junior
