# Card basketball teams face loss of last year's stars
## A 						rebuilt mens team is committed to restoring past glory 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
There are no stars anymore.
No preseason All-America can
didates.
No early NBA draft specula
tors.
And there are no high expecta
tions anymore either â€” well, at
least from the outside anyway.
For the unranked Stanford
men's basketball team, it's a com
pletely different season now with a
not so different theme.
Now the team stands waist deep
in the aftermath of Casey Jacobsen
and Curtis Borchardt's early de
parture for the NBA, yet the Car
dinal still finds itself in the same
thematic struggle that it was
plagued by last year, the same tug
of-war battle between tradition
and self.
Last year, the preseason specu
lation hinged on whether or not
the Cardinal could pull it together
in the absence of the Collins twins
and remain a contender on the na
tional level. Speculators this year
question whether or not Stanford
should even be judged on a na
tional scale.
"The only bad thing about not
having the big marquee names is
that you don't get the preseason

attention that you're accustomed
to," said sophomore center Rob
Little. "It's tough losing those guys
to the NBA, but that's what basket
ball's all about. But my hope for
the season is that we can be con
tenders in the [Pacific-10 Confer
ence] and hopefully return this
team back to the status quo of
being a national powerhouse."
Regardless of outsider expecta
tions, Stanford enters the season
more united than ever, more com
mitted to team play than ever and
more intent upon returning to the
national prominence it boasted
just three years ago, which now
seems so far away.
At the end of last year's season,
the remaining Cardinal players
knew that there would have to be a
renewed emphasis on team play
due to the exit of Jacobsen and
Borchardt, and consequently a
large contingent of the squad
opted to stay on campus during
the summer.
"Our guys said, 'Let's stay to
gether in the summer, establish a
core and get this team back to
where it needs to be,"' said head
coach Mike Montgomery.
And so they did, and the result
is a basketball team that is much
closer.
"When you have everybody to
gether during the off-season, and
you can see how hard they are
working, there's a lot of team
bonding that occurs," said junior

forward J ustin Davis.
Despite the team's closeness,
Montgomery acknowledges that
the season will be an uphill battle.
"We're in kind of a tough
stretch with our basketball team,
but 1 think we'll be fine in time,"
Montgomery said. "We're going
to have some growing pains;
there's no question about it. But
the kids have a great attitude,
and they're going to be a fun
team to coach."
Furthermore, Stanford's diffi
cult schedule will leave little
breathing room for this young
Cardinal team. Outsiders will
know very early whether or not
Stanford is a viable competitor.
The Cardinal's first test will be
the preseason NI T, a prestigious
single-elimination four-game
tournament beginning Monday
that boasts teams like No. 2
Kansas and No. 11 Xavier. The
Cardinal will also compete in the
Las Vegas Shootout against
UNLV and the Fete Newell Chal
lenge versus Gonzaga during
winter break.
And by virtue of being a mem
ber of the Pac-10, the Cardinal will
be forced to face a very difficult
schedule. Last year's Pac-10 Tour
nament champion, Arizona, is cur
rently ranked No. 1 in national
preseason polls. No. 9 Oregon and
No. 12 UCI A also make up a Pac
-10 so rich with talent that some
have pegged Stanford to finish as
low as seventh in the conference.
"I think a lot of people, the
media especially, don't expect us

to do as well as we have done in the
past," said junior shooting guard
Matt Lottich. "It's a team goal to
prove them wrong. In previous
years, we've had superstars and
consequently the expectations
were pretty high around here, and
now those guys are gone. There's a
new era of basketball here."
The biggest question surround
ing the season is who's going to fill
the scoring void that Jacobsen and
Borchardt's retirement has left.
The duo averaged 38.8 points per
game on a team that scored just
over 80 per game.
Much of the scoring burden will
be transferred to senior guard
Julius Barnes, the Cardinal's lead
ing returning scorer with 10.9
points per game. Along with
Barnes, junior guard Matt Lottich,
who is described as a "natural scor
er" by many of his teammates, will
be expected to step up offensively
as well.
Sophomore swingman Josh
Childress proved that lie could be
a scoring threat last year as he fin
ished his freshman campaign as
Stanford's fourth-leading scorer
with 7.8 points per game. The Car
dinal's other swingman, 6-foot-6
sophomore Nick "Pops" Robin
son, has also seen significant time
with the No. 1 team during prac
tice as of late and is expected to
contribute this year on both ends
of the court.
"I think the scoring burden will
be taken up by the whole team,"
Little said. "We have eight to 10
guys who can really score 20 points
a game on any given night. People
are looking towards Julius, Josh
and Matt as guys who are going to
be really big scorers for us. I n ad
dition to them, I feel like our inside

guys aren't getting the respect that
is due, but at the same time, we're
going to have to prove ourselves to
everyone. And the proof will be in
the play."
In the absence of Borchardt,
the Stanford big men have big
shoes to fill. Little and Davis, the
expected starters, must have
breakthrough seasons if the Cardi
nal wants to be successful this year
on the block. Both have played sig
nificant minutes in the past and
seem eager and ready to step into
the scoring spotlight. Juniors Joe
Kirchofer, Tyler Besecker and
Teyo Johnson (once he returns
from the football team) and 6-foot
-10 freshman Matt Haryasz will also
add depth down low.
Further, because of the recent
injury to sophomore starting
point guard Chris Hernandez, the
freshman class, which is, for the
most part, a guard-laden group,
may play a more significant role
than in past years. Both Jason
Haas and Carlton Weatherby may
see time at the point if Mont
gomery feels that Barnes can pro
duce better from the two spot.
And if offensive productivity be
comes an issue, freshman wing
man Dan Grunfeld might be
called upon to step in, considering
his ability to shoot the long ball.
"As a freshman [coming into
this program] it's really hard,"
Weatherby said. "But the love you
get from the players and the
coaches makes everything so
much easier."
Stanford's first test this season
will be at 6:15 p.m. on Monday at
Maples Pavilion, where the Cardi
nal will take on unranked Boston
University in the first round of the
preseason NIT.
