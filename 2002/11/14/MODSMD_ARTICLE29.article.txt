# Staying healthy will be key to the women's success this season
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ever since Tara VanDerveer
helped mold the Stanford
women's basketball program into
a national powerhouse in the
early '90s, expectations for the
team's success have been set high
every year on the Farm. This
year, of course, is no different, as
the Cardinal — yet again abound
ing with talent — is being picked
by just about everyone to win the
Pacific-10 Conference, as the
team opens the season ranked
sixth in the country.
But all the hype and excite
ment is contingent upon one sim
ple factor: Stanford must get
healthy and remain so through
out the season.
It's not like that statement is
very profound — teams always
wants to have their best players
out on the floor — but the Cardi
nal (32-3 last year) opens the sea
son with an injury cloud hanging
over its head. Life on the court
has become so dire lately that
Stanford has practiced with as few
as seven players just weeks before
the regular season commences.
"It's really frustrating because
some players are really limited,"
redshirt sophomore center

Chelsea Trotter said. "You're
thinking [about] what UConn
and Tennessee [are] doing with a
full roster."
So, obviously, the notion of
healing as soon as possible has
pervaded the minds of everyone
associated with the club.
"We're counting on getting
people healthy," VanDerveer
said. "You always have some kind
of challenge, so if we can have 11
people available fora game, we're
in great shape."
The most noteworthy of the in
juries is that of junior Nicole Pow
ell, a consensus Naismith Nation
al Player of the Year candidate,
who is suffering from a bulging
disk in her back. She is out indef
initely, and Stanford will miss her
floor presence every game she's
not in the lineup.
Just consider the mind-bog
gling numbers Powell amassed
last year. She recorded five of the
six triple-doubles ever produced
on the Farm and led the Pac-10 in
both rebounding (9.3 rpg) and as
sists (6.3 apg) — the first player in
conference history, male or fe
male, to accomplish the feat. Pow
ell also earned a spot on the
Kodak All-America team, just the
sixth player to do so in the storied
history of Stanford basketball.
But the Cardinal's other in
juries are just as painful to its
overall plan.
Guard Katie Denny, the only
other junior on a team without
any seniors, broke her right hand
in the preseason and will be out
another six weeks. Freshman
Eziamaka Okafor, who was
ranked as high as 26th in one na
tional prep recruiting magazine,
suffered an ACL injury in the
summer and won't return until at
least January, if at all.
Trotter and guard Susan King,
two redshirt sophomores who
both didn't play last season be
cause of injuries, aren't yet play
ing at full strength either. Both
players brooded on the bench last
year with ACL problems, but their
durability will be key for the Car
dinal this winter.
The Cardinal has lost leading
scorer Lindsey Yamasaki (17.2
ppg) and inside cohorts Bethany
Donaphin and Cori Enghusen to
graduation, and Becky Bonner
and Jamie Carey have trans
ferred to Boston University and
Texas, respectively. As a result,
this year's team has a completely
different feel.
In fact, the make-up of the
2002-2003 Cardinal team doesn't
resemble at all the archetypal
VanDerveer roster.
This year's squad possesses
much greater versatility than past
teams. Case in point: 11 of the 12
players on the roster can, at any
time, drain a 3-pointer (freshman
center Shelley Nweke is the only
exception).
"It's great for our offense be
cause everyone can play every po
sition," sophomore guard Seb
nem Kimyacioglu said. "I think
we will be hard to defend."
The heart of that versatility lies
in the backcourt, where Van-
Derveer has a plethora of talented
guards to choose from: King,
sophomores Kelley Suminski and
Kimyacioglu and freshmen Claire
Bodensteiner and Krista Rappa

hahn.
King, who is probably best
known fora 21 -point, five-assist
performance at Tennessee her
freshman year, will be the catalyst
for the Stanford offense this sea
son. Suminski — who was a Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection
last year after leading the confer
ence in 3-point shooting (46.3
percent) — will most likely be one
of the players counted upon to
compensate for the loss of Ya
masaki's scoring.
Kimyacioglu, who played most
of last year at the point, will see
more action at wing this year as a
result of King's return.
Both freshmen will be expect
ed to log minutes due to the in
jury epidemic plaguing the Car
dinal. Bodensteiner is an athletic,
skilled point guard who will back
up King, while Rappahahn, an
other national top-100 prospect,
is an excellent shooter who will be
used extensively at the wing.
In the post, Trotter, sopho
mores T'Nae Thiel (another Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection)
and Azella Perryman and the 6-5
Nweke face the unenviable task of
trying to duplicate the 14 points,
8.3 rebounds and 3.17 blocks per
game that Donaphin and En
ghusen produced together inside
last season.
This year, the change in per
sonnel means a change in philos
ophy as well.
Since Stanford currently lacks
a proven go-to pivot player, Van-
Derveer will try to take advantage
of her team's versatility with a
more wide-open, motion offense,
with lots of movement on the
perimeter and screens for the
pure shooters like Suminski,
Kimyacioglu and Rappahahn.
In essence, says VanDerveer,
it's "less set plays and more read
the-defense."
VanDerveer asserts there will
be changes on the defensive side
of the ball, too — namely the uti
lization of a more extended man
to-man defense as well as full- and

half-court traps and presses.
However, the Stanford coach
concedes that with all the injuries
and new faces, the team hasn't
really had time to install any
complex defensive schemes in
practice.
"You have to make some choic
es, and we decided to work on our
offense first," she said. "As we get
healthier, we'll be able to do some
things defensively."
The Cardinal will confront a
handful of early tests in its rough
nonconference schedule — a sta
ple of the VanDerveer era at
Stanford.
The Cardinal opens against
Rutgers from the rough-and
tough Big East on Nov. 22. Over
Thanksgiving, it's almost a cer
tainty the Cardinal will square off
against No. 5 Kansas State in the
championship game of the Stan
ford Tournament. In December,
the Cardinal will play road games
at Pacific, Boston University and
No. 2 Tennessee. The beginning
of January will see No. 19 Okla
homa ancl a scrappy Pepperdine
team travel to Palo Alto for the last
two games of the grind.
"We aren't dodging anybody,"
VanDerveer said. "[But] we've al
ways done that."
The Pac-10, much maligned
for its low RPI come March last
year, looks to be much improved,
and other Pac-10 teams should
challenge Stanford much more
than it did last season, when the
Cardinal cruised to an 18-0 con
ference record for the fourth time
in school history.
Washington, Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon all possess
marquee players who will pre
sent match-up problems for the
Cardinal.
But in the bigger picture,
whatever Stanford will be able to
accomplish on the court will be a
function of which players are ac
tually in the lineup every night.
So it's safe to say Stanford should
hold steadfastly to a sort of re
vamped motto: Just stay healthy.

and new faces, the team hasn't
really had time to install any

The Cardinal will confront a
handful of early tests in its rough
nonconference schedule — a sta
ple of the VanDerveer era at
Stanford.
The Cardinal opens against
Rutgers from the rough-and
tough Big East on Nov. 22. Over
Thanksgiving, it's almost a cer
tainty the Cardinal will square off
against No. 5 Kansas State in the
championship game of the Stan
ford Tournament. In December,
the Cardinal will play road games
at Pacific, Boston University and
No. 2 Tennessee. The beginning
of January will see No. 19 Okla
homa ancl a scrappy Pepperdine
team travel to Palo Alto for the last
two games of the grind.
"We aren't dodging anybody,"
VanDerveer said. "[But] we've al
ways done that."
The Pac-10, much maligned
for its low RPI come March last
year, looks to be much improved,
and other Pac-10 teams should
challenge Stanford much more
than it did last season, when the
Cardinal cruised to an 18-0 con
ference record for the fourth time
in school history.
Washington, Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon all possess
marquee players who will pre
sent match-up problems for the
Cardinal.
But in the bigger picture,
whatever Stanford will be able to
accomplish on the court will be a
function of which players are ac
tually in the lineup every night.
So it's safe to say Stanford should
hold steadfastly to a sort of re
vamped motto: Just stay healthy.
Ever since Tara VanDerveer
helped mold the Stanford
women's basketball program into
a national powerhouse in the
early '90s, expectations for the
team's success have been set high
every year on the Farm. This
year, of course, is no different, as
the Cardinal — yet again abound
ing with talent — is being picked
by just about everyone to win the
Pacific-10 Conference, as the
team opens the season ranked
sixth in the country.
But all the hype and excite
ment is contingent upon one sim
ple factor: Stanford must get
healthy and remain so through
out the season.
It's not like that statement is
very profound — teams always
wants to have their best players
out on the floor — but the Cardi
nal (32-3 last year) opens the sea
son with an injury cloud hanging
over its head. Life on the court
has become so dire lately that
Stanford has practiced with as few
as seven players just weeks before
the regular season commences.
"It's really frustrating because
some players are really limited,"
redshirt sophomore center

Chelsea Trotter said. "You're
thinking [about] what UConn
and Tennessee [are] doing with a
full roster."
So, obviously, the notion of
healing as soon as possible has
pervaded the minds of everyone
associated with the club.
"We're counting on getting
people healthy," VanDerveer
said. "You always have some kind
of challenge, so if we can have 11
people available fora game, we're
in great shape."
The most noteworthy of the in
juries is that of junior Nicole Pow
ell, a consensus Naismith Nation
al Player of the Year candidate,
who is suffering from a bulging
disk in her back. She is out indef
initely, and Stanford will miss her
floor presence every game she's
not in the lineup.
Just consider the mind-bog
gling numbers Powell amassed
last year. She recorded five of the
six triple-doubles ever produced
on the Farm and led the Pac-10 in
both rebounding (9.3 rpg) and as
sists (6.3 apg) — the first player in
conference history, male or fe
male, to accomplish the feat. Pow
ell also earned a spot on the
Kodak All-America team, just the
sixth player to do so in the storied
history of Stanford basketball.
But the Cardinal's other in
juries are just as painful to its
overall plan.
Guard Katie Denny, the only
other junior on a team without
any seniors, broke her right hand
in the preseason and will be out
another six weeks. Freshman
Eziamaka Okafor, who was
ranked as high as 26th in one na
tional prep recruiting magazine,
suffered an ACL injury in the
summer and won't return until at
least January, if at all.
Trotter and guard Susan King,
two redshirt sophomores who
both didn't play last season be
cause of injuries, aren't yet play
ing at full strength either. Both
players brooded on the bench last
year with ACL problems, but their
durability will be key for the Car
dinal this winter.
The Cardinal has lost leading
scorer Lindsey Yamasaki (17.2
ppg) and inside cohorts Bethany
Donaphin and Cori Enghusen to
graduation, and Becky Bonner
and Jamie Carey have trans
ferred to Boston University and
Texas, respectively. As a result,
this year's team has a completely
different feel.
In fact, the make-up of the
2002-2003 Cardinal team doesn't
resemble at all the archetypal
VanDerveer roster.
This year's squad possesses
much greater versatility than past
teams. Case in point: 11 of the 12
players on the roster can, at any
time, drain a 3-pointer (freshman
center Shelley Nweke is the only
exception).
"It's great for our offense be
cause everyone can play every po
sition," sophomore guard Seb
nem Kimyacioglu said. "I think
we will be hard to defend."
The heart of that versatility lies
in the backcourt, where Van-
Derveer has a plethora of talented
guards to choose from: King,
sophomores Kelley Suminski and
Kimyacioglu and freshmen Claire
Bodensteiner and Krista Rappa

hahn.
King, who is probably best
known fora 21 -point, five-assist
performance at Tennessee her
freshman year, will be the catalyst
for the Stanford offense this sea
son. Suminski — who was a Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection
last year after leading the confer
ence in 3-point shooting (46.3
percent) — will most likely be one
of the players counted upon to
compensate for the loss of Ya
masaki's scoring.
Kimyacioglu, who played most
of last year at the point, will see
more action at wing this year as a
result of King's return.
Both freshmen will be expect
ed to log minutes due to the in
jury epidemic plaguing the Car
dinal. Bodensteiner is an athletic,
skilled point guard who will back
up King, while Rappahahn, an
other national top-100 prospect,
is an excellent shooter who will be
used extensively at the wing.
In the post, Trotter, sopho
mores T'Nae Thiel (another Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection)
and Azella Perryman and the 6-5
Nweke face the unenviable task of
trying to duplicate the 14 points,
8.3 rebounds and 3.17 blocks per
game that Donaphin and En
ghusen produced together inside
last season.
This year, the change in per
sonnel means a change in philos
ophy as well.
Since Stanford currently lacks
a proven go-to pivot player, Van-
Derveer will try to take advantage
of her team's versatility with a
more wide-open, motion offense,
with lots of movement on the
perimeter and screens for the
pure shooters like Suminski,
Kimyacioglu and Rappahahn.
In essence, says VanDerveer,
it's "less set plays and more read
the-defense."
VanDerveer asserts there will
be changes on the defensive side
of the ball, too — namely the uti
lization of a more extended man
to-man defense as well as full- and

half-court traps and presses.
However, the Stanford coach

Bodensteiner and Krista Rappa

hahn.
King, who is probably best
known fora 21 -point, five-assist
performance at Tennessee her
freshman year, will be the catalyst
for the Stanford offense this sea
son. Suminski — who was a Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection
last year after leading the confer
ence in 3-point shooting (46.3
percent) — will most likely be one
of the players counted upon to
compensate for the loss of Ya
masaki's scoring.
Kimyacioglu, who played most
of last year at the point, will see
more action at wing this year as a
result of King's return.
Both freshmen will be expect
ed to log minutes due to the in
jury epidemic plaguing the Car
dinal. Bodensteiner is an athletic,
skilled point guard who will back
up King, while Rappahahn, an
other national top-100 prospect,
is an excellent shooter who will be
used extensively at the wing.
In the post, Trotter, sopho
mores T'Nae Thiel (another Pac
-10 All-Freshman Team selection)
and Azella Perryman and the 6-5
Nweke face the unenviable task of
trying to duplicate the 14 points,
8.3 rebounds and 3.17 blocks per
game that Donaphin and En
ghusen produced together inside
last season.
This year, the change in per
sonnel means a change in philos
ophy as well.
Since Stanford currently lacks
a proven go-to pivot player, Van-
Derveer will try to take advantage
of her team's versatility with a
more wide-open, motion offense,
with lots of movement on the
perimeter and screens for the
pure shooters like Suminski,
Kimyacioglu and Rappahahn.
In essence, says VanDerveer,
it's "less set plays and more read
the-defense."
VanDerveer asserts there will
be changes on the defensive side
of the ball, too — namely the uti
lization of a more extended man
to-man defense as well as full- and

half-court traps and presses.
However, the Stanford coach
concedes that with all the injuries
and new faces, the team hasn't
really had time to install any
complex defensive schemes in
practice.
"You have to make some choic
es, and we decided to work on our
offense first," she said. "As we get
healthier, we'll be able to do some
things defensively."
The Cardinal will confront a
handful of early tests in its rough
nonconference schedule — a sta
ple of the VanDerveer era at
Stanford.
The Cardinal opens against
Rutgers from the rough-and
tough Big East on Nov. 22. Over
Thanksgiving, it's almost a cer
tainty the Cardinal will square off
against No. 5 Kansas State in the
championship game of the Stan
ford Tournament. In December,
the Cardinal will play road games
at Pacific, Boston University and
No. 2 Tennessee. The beginning
of January will see No. 19 Okla
homa ancl a scrappy Pepperdine
team travel to Palo Alto for the last
two games of the grind.
"We aren't dodging anybody,"
VanDerveer said. "[But] we've al
ways done that."
The Pac-10, much maligned
for its low RPI come March last
year, looks to be much improved,
and other Pac-10 teams should
challenge Stanford much more
than it did last season, when the
Cardinal cruised to an 18-0 con
ference record for the fourth time
in school history.
Washington, Southern Cali
fornia and Oregon all possess
marquee players who will pre
sent match-up problems for the
Cardinal.
But in the bigger picture,
whatever Stanford will be able to
accomplish on the court will be a
function of which players are ac
tually in the lineup every night.
So it's safe to say Stanford should
hold steadfastly to a sort of re
vamped motto: Just stay healthy.
