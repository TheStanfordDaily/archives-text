# Staying healthy will be key to the women's success this season

Ever since Tara VanDerveer
helped mold the Stanford
women's basketball program into
a national powerhouse in the
early '90s, expectations for the
team's success have been set high
every year on the Farm. This
year, of course, is no different, as
the Cardinal — yet again abound
ing with talent — is being picked
by just about everyone to win the
Pacific-10 Conference, as the
team opens the season ranked
sixth in the country.
But all the hype and excite
ment is contingent upon one sim
ple factor: Stanford must get
healthy and remain so through
out the season.
It's not like that statement is
very profound — teams always
wants to have their best players
out on the floor — but the Cardi
nal (32-3 last year) opens the sea
son with an injury cloud hanging
over its head. Life on the court
has become so dire lately that
Stanford has practiced with as few
as seven players just weeks before
the regular season commences.
"It's really frustrating because
some players are really limited,"
redshirt sophomore center

Chelsea Trotter said. "You're
thinking [about] what UConn
and Tennessee [are] doing with a
full roster."
So, obviously, the notion of
healing as soon as possible has
pervaded the minds of everyone
associated with the club.
"We're counting on getting
people healthy," VanDerveer
said. "You always have some kind
of challenge, so if we can have 11
people available fora game, we're
in great shape."
The most noteworthy of the in
juries is that of junior Nicole Pow
ell, a consensus Naismith Nation
al Player of the Year candidate,
who is suffering from a bulging
disk in her back. She is out indef
initely, and Stanford will miss her
floor presence every game she's
not in the lineup.
Just consider the mind-bog
gling numbers Powell amassed
last year. She recorded five of the
six triple-doubles ever produced
on the Farm and led the Pac-10 in
both rebounding (9.3 rpg) and as
sists (6.3 apg) — the first player in
conference history, male or fe
male, to accomplish the feat. Pow
ell also earned a spot on the
Kodak All-America team, just the
sixth player to do so in the storied
history of Stanford basketball.
But the Cardinal's other in
juries are just as painful to its
overall plan.
Guard Katie Denny, the only
