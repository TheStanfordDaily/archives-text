# UC admissions policy spurs debate
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
This morning, the Board of Ad
missions and Relations with Schools
— a system-wide faculty committee
established by the University of Cal
ifornia Board of Regents' Academic
Senate - will present a progress re
port to the Board of Regents outlin
ing the first-year implementation of
the UC system's controversial new
admissions policy.
Under this new selection process,
called comprehensive review, all ap
plicants are evaluated according to
14 academic and non-academic cri

teria, such as extracurricular activi
ties and life challenges.
Those in favor of this policy be
lieve that it allows fora more thor
ough and complete review of an ap
plicant's qualifications and accom
plishments. Critics are concerned
that it may be an attempt to bypass
California state Proposition 209,
which banned the use of racial and
ethnic preferences in UC admissions.
Comprehensive review replaces
the previous "two-tiered" admis
sions process, in which 50 to 75 per
cent of the freshmen were admitted
solely based on academic factors.
This new policy was adopted in

Nov. 2001 and went into effect for
the schools' current freshman class.
"Before [Nov. 2001] compre
hensive review was used to evaluate
a portion of the applicants. The
change [in admissions policy] just
means that now, all the students are
reviewed based on the comprehen
sive review," said Hanan Eisenman,
media coordinator for admissions
for the UC Office of the President.
Some critics feared that under
comprehensive review, academic
standards would be lowered. But
Eisenman disagreed.
"Academic achievement is the
most important part of an appli
cant's qualifications," he said. "But
this new policy allows us to use the
full range of accomplishments,
such as community service or
artistic talent. It is designed to cre
ate more fairness because it looks
at everything that an applicant has
to offer."
Of the 14 criteria for admission
into a UC school, the one that has
received the most scrutiny over
the past few months requires that
a student's academic accomplish
ments be reviewed "in light of the
applicant's experiences and cir
cumstances, such as disabilities,
low family income, first genera
tion to attend college, need to
work, disadvantaged social or ed
ucation environment, difficult
personal and family situations or
circumstances, refugee status or
veteran status."
Some educators fear that the new
admissions process places too much
weight on having survived hardship
and life challenges and that it is an
indirect attempt to admit more stu
dents of color.
"This is technically a 'race-neu
tral' policy, but it's really just old
wine in a new bottle," wrote UC-
Berkeley Linguistics Prof. John
McWhorter in an article that ap
peared in The Washington Post this
past August.
"The UC 'suits' have crafted a
canny end run around 1996's
Proposition 209, which outlawed
racial preferences in college admis
sions. The new policy is designed to
bolster the presence of 'brown' mi
norities — blacks and Latinos —
widiout explicitly targeting race,"
McWhorter said.
Eisenman, however, empha
sized that the UC schools do not
consider race or ethnicity in admit
ting students and that the new ad
missions policy is not a way to
covertly do so.

"The criteria about having 'sur
vived hardships' has been misun
derstood. No student is admitted
based on one criterion," he ex
plained. "That [criterion] refers to
looking at a student's academic ac
complishments while having over
come adversity."
Since the adoption of compre
hensive review, there has been a
modest change in terms of the eth
nic makeup of students admitted to
the UC schools.
In fall 2001, 18.0 percent of the
admitted students were from un
derrepresented groups — Ameri
can Indian, African American or
Chicano / Latino. In fall 2002, that
number rose slightly to 19.1 per
cent.
The number of Asian American
and white students also increased
from 71.5 percent in fall 2001 to
72.1 percent in fall 2002, while the
number of students who declined to
state their ethnicity dropped from
8.1 percent to 7.3 percent.
Not all educators see compre
hensive review as a way of increasing
diversity among students.
"Fhe issue is less of trying to get
around Proposition 209 than rec
ognizing that they want to find
ways of finding diverse students,"
said Stanford Education Prof.
John Baugh. "If one rejects race as
a consideration, then perhaps
looking at [having survived] hard
ships is one way.
"I would not agree that consider
ing having survived hardships is a
surrogate for race. Hardships come
in different manners — disabilities,
economics, etc."
Others, like Diana Schmelzer,
principal of University I ligh School
in Irvine, Calif., expressed concern
that students who have not been
faced with adversities may be hurt
by the new admissions policy.
"It kind of says ifyou are in a sta
ble family and a strong school you
are penalized," she told the San
Francisco Chronicle. "Kids are try
ing to think of some big tragedy
they've had in their lives to put on
die application."
The UC system defended its de

cision to adopt comprehensive re
view by saying that the new admis
sions process is similar to those used
by many private schools, which con
sider all aspects, not only academic,
of a student's accomplishments.
The Board of Admissions and
Relations with Schools recommend
ed the extension of comprehensive
review to all applicants in a progress
report released on Nov. 6.
In the report, the Board of Ad
missions and Relations with Schools
cited that comprehensive review al
lows students to be evaluated "not
based on one 01 two narrow quanti
tative indicators, but rather on
achievement and potential in a
broad range of academically rele
vant areas."
At Stanford, applicants are evalu
ated within the context from which
they are applying, according to
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet.
'"litis means that, for each appli
cant, we are able to consider the re
sou ires, both academic and otherwise,
that have been available to the student
and the degree to which a student has
taken advantage of the resources avail
able to him or her," she said.
While the UC schools do not con
sider race or ethnicity in admitting
students, Stanford considers back
ground factors such as ethnicity in
the admission process to "achieve a
diverse student body and ensure
that Stanford's presence is among
the leadership of all communities,"
according to Mamlet.
"Stanford is strongly committed
to enrolling a class that is diverse in
many ways. The educational experi
ence of all students is enhanced by
the diversity of backgrounds and
experiences represented in the stu
dent body," she added.
The UC system's full report,
"First-Year Implementation of
Comprehensive Review in Fresh
man Admissions: A Progress Report
from the Board of Admissions and
Relations with Schools" will be pre
sented to the Board of Regents
today at 8:50 a.m. The presentation

sions process, in which 50 to 75 per
cent of the freshmen were admitted
solely based on academic factors.
This new policy was adopted in

Nov. 2001 and went into effect for
the schools' current freshman class.
"Before [Nov. 2001] compre
hensive review was used to evaluate
a portion of the applicants. The
change [in admissions policy] just
means that now, all the students are
reviewed based on the comprehen
sive review," said Hanan Eisenman,
media coordinator for admissions
for the UC Office of the President.
Some critics feared that under
comprehensive review, academic
standards would be lowered. But
Eisenman disagreed.
"Academic achievement is the
most important part of an appli
cant's qualifications," he said. "But
this new policy allows us to use the
full range of accomplishments,
such as community service or
artistic talent. It is designed to cre
ate more fairness because it looks
at everything that an applicant has
to offer."
Of the 14 criteria for admission
into a UC school, the one that has
received the most scrutiny over
the past few months requires that
a student's academic accomplish
ments be reviewed "in light of the
applicant's experiences and cir
cumstances, such as disabilities,
low family income, first genera
tion to attend college, need to
work, disadvantaged social or ed
ucation environment, difficult
personal and family situations or
circumstances, refugee status or
veteran status."
Some educators fear that the new
admissions process places too much
weight on having survived hardship
and life challenges and that it is an
indirect attempt to admit more stu
dents of color.
"This is technically a 'race-neu
tral' policy, but it's really just old
wine in a new bottle," wrote UC-
Berkeley Linguistics Prof. John
McWhorter in an article that ap
peared in The Washington Post this
past August.
"The UC 'suits' have crafted a
canny end run around 1996's
Proposition 209, which outlawed
racial preferences in college admis
sions. The new policy is designed to
bolster the presence of 'brown' mi
norities — blacks and Latinos —
widiout explicitly targeting race,"
McWhorter said.
Eisenman, however, empha
sized that the UC schools do not
consider race or ethnicity in admit
ting students and that the new ad
missions policy is not a way to
covertly do so.

"The criteria about having 'sur
vived hardships' has been misun
derstood. No student is admitted
based on one criterion," he ex
plained. "That [criterion] refers to
looking at a student's academic ac
complishments while having over
come adversity."
Since the adoption of compre
hensive review, there has been a
modest change in terms of the eth
nic makeup of students admitted to
the UC schools.
In fall 2001, 18.0 percent of the
admitted students were from un
derrepresented groups — Ameri
can Indian, African American or
Chicano / Latino. In fall 2002, that
number rose slightly to 19.1 per
cent.
The number of Asian American
and white students also increased
from 71.5 percent in fall 2001 to
72.1 percent in fall 2002, while the
number of students who declined to
state their ethnicity dropped from
8.1 percent to 7.3 percent.
Not all educators see compre
hensive review as a way of increasing
diversity among students.
"Fhe issue is less of trying to get
around Proposition 209 than rec
ognizing that they want to find
ways of finding diverse students,"
said Stanford Education Prof.
John Baugh. "If one rejects race as
a consideration, then perhaps
looking at [having survived] hard
ships is one way.
"I would not agree that consider
ing having survived hardships is a
surrogate for race. Hardships come
in different manners — disabilities,
economics, etc."
Others, like Diana Schmelzer,
principal of University I ligh School
in Irvine, Calif., expressed concern
that students who have not been
faced with adversities may be hurt
by the new admissions policy.
"It kind of says ifyou are in a sta
ble family and a strong school you
are penalized," she told the San
Francisco Chronicle. "Kids are try
ing to think of some big tragedy
they've had in their lives to put on
die application."
The UC system defended its de

cision to adopt comprehensive re
view by saying that the new admis
sions process is similar to those used
by many private schools, which con
sider all aspects, not only academic,
of a student's accomplishments.
The Board of Admissions and
Relations with Schools recommend
ed the extension of comprehensive
review to all applicants in a progress
report released on Nov. 6.
In the report, the Board of Ad
missions and Relations with Schools
cited that comprehensive review al
lows students to be evaluated "not
based on one 01 two narrow quanti
tative indicators, but rather on
achievement and potential in a
broad range of academically rele
vant areas."
At Stanford, applicants are evalu
ated within the context from which
they are applying, according to
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet.
'"litis means that, for each appli
cant, we are able to consider the re
sou ires, both academic and otherwise,
that have been available to the student
and the degree to which a student has
taken advantage of the resources avail
able to him or her," she said.
While the UC schools do not con
sider race or ethnicity in admitting
students, Stanford considers back
ground factors such as ethnicity in
the admission process to "achieve a
diverse student body and ensure
that Stanford's presence is among
the leadership of all communities,"
according to Mamlet.
"Stanford is strongly committed
to enrolling a class that is diverse in
many ways. The educational experi
ence of all students is enhanced by
the diversity of backgrounds and
experiences represented in the stu
dent body," she added.

"First-Year Implementation of

This morning, the Board of Ad

— a system-wide faculty committee
established by the University of Cal
ifornia Board of Regents' Academic
Senate - will present a progress re
port to the Board of Regents outlin
ing the first-year implementation of
the UC system's controversial new
admissions policy.
Under this new selection process,
called comprehensive review, all ap
plicants are evaluated according to
14 academic and non-academic cri

teria, such as extracurricular activi
ties and life challenges.
Those in favor of this policy be
lieve that it allows fora more thor

that it may be an attempt to bypass
California state Proposition 209,
which banned the use of racial and
ethnic preferences in UC admissions.
