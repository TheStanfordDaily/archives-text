# UC admissions policy spurs debate
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
This morning, the Board of Ad
missions and Relations with Schools
â€” a system-wide faculty committee
established by the University of Cal
ifornia Board of Regents' Academic
Senate - will present a progress re
port to the Board of Regents outlin
ing the first-year implementation of
the UC system's controversial new
admissions policy.
Under this new selection process,
called comprehensive review, all ap
plicants are evaluated according to
14 academic and non-academic cri

teria, such as extracurricular activi
ties and life challenges.
Those in favor of this policy be
lieve that it allows fora more thor
ough and complete review of an ap
plicant's qualifications and accom
plishments. Critics are concerned
that it may be an attempt to bypass
California state Proposition 209,
which banned the use of racial and
ethnic preferences in UC admissions.
Comprehensive review replaces
the previous "two-tiered" admis
sions process, in which 50 to 75 per
cent of the freshmen were admitted
solely based on academic factors.
This new policy was adopted in

Nov. 2001 and went into effect for
the schools' current freshman class.
"Before [Nov. 2001] compre
hensive review was used to evaluate
a portion of the applicants. The
change [in admissions policy] just
means that now, all the students are
reviewed based on the comprehen
sive review," said Hanan Eisenman,
media coordinator for admissions
for the UC Office of the President.
Some critics feared that under
comprehensive review, academic
standards would be lowered. But
Eisenman disagreed.
