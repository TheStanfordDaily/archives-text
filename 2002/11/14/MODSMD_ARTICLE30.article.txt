# Barnes takes new role
## Stanford's lone senior will be looked to as a leader; both on and off the court 
### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
He doesn't luive the resounding joviality
anci hugable teddy bear qualities of Mark
Mad sen.
Nor does he possess the wonder-kid rep
utation capable of drawing two, even three
defenders as Casey Jacobsen.
Like everything on this year's Stanford
men's basketball team, Julius Barnes is just a

little bit different from what Cardinal fans
are used to.
But while Barnes brings varied leader
ship and basketball skills to Maples Pavilion,
pobody is questioning the position he must
assume in the long line of Stanford legends.
As the only senior on this year's young squad
and the highest returning scorer, Barnes has
his work cut out for him. Because of the foot
injury to sophomore point guard Chris
Hernandez, Barnes' role becomes all the
more defined.
"I need to be more vocal this year,"
Barnes said. "We don't have guys like Casey
and Curtis [Borchardt] who weren't afraid

Filling in for the injured Chris Hernandez at point guard, senior Julius Barnes matched his ca
reer high of 27 points against the Olympic Club on Tuesday.
to get on people, or people from the
past like David Moseley and Mark
Madsen who weren't afraid to yell
at people.
"1 feel like my job is to get guys
on the same page when I am on the
floor. It definitely hurts that Chris is
out because it limits my ability to
score at the one. It is more that I
have to get other guys the ball. But
if I do get to the next level, that is
where I will be playing, so it is good
that I can get the experience."
Known as Stanford basketball's
wild child, Barnes has the ability to
dismantle entire defenses with his
penetration.
The first big-stage display of his
talents came in the 2000 Pete
Newell Challenge against eventual
NCAA champion Duke. Barnes
was forced to step up and play 17
minutes while then-senior Mike
McDonald sat on the bench in foul
trouble. In addition to playing stel
lar defense on the Blue Devil's
Jason Williams, Barnes put up nine
points, three rebounds, two assists
and one block, as the Cardinal de
feated Duke on a last-second Jacob
sen shot.
As a junior, Barnes was given
more minutes and a starting role

after just seven games. His num
bers backed him up, as he averaged
10.9 points per game, trailing only
Borchardt and Jacobsen.
Against California on Jan. 4,
Barnes showed his true potential
with a career-high 27 points on the
night.
However, while he can create his
own shot and isn't afraid to take it,
he has often been overlooked in re
cent years for more conservative
options such as Tony Giovacchini
and McDonald.
The framework looked to be in
place diis year to maximize Barnes'
talents while maintaining the con
sistency of head coach Mike Mont
gomery's coaching style. Mont
gomery found control and stability
in Hernandez. And with two fresh
man point guards, Jason Haas and
Carlton Weatherby, joining the ros
ter, Barnes could be placed at the
two guard, allowing him the oppor
tunity to take more shots.
But with Hernandez gone for
the first four to six weeks of the sea
son, Barnes must now assume not
only the sentimental appointment
of team leader, but he must be the
floor leader as well, a position that
excites many Stanford fans.
Barnes' forced appointment at
the one is consistent with the over
all increased athleticism on the ros
ter. However, Barnes himself rec
ognizes that this increase in athleti

cism could mean a decrease in con
trol.
"I think the strength of the team
is our athleticism, but with that
comes lack of fundamentals,"
Barnes said. "Guys like myself, [ju
nior] Justin [Davis] and [sopho
more] Josh [Childress] are athletic,
but sometimes we do lack that fun
damental edge that other guys who
were here before us have pos
sessed."
If Tuesday's exhibition game
against the Olympic Club is any in
dication, Barnes is more that willing
to assume the offensive responsibil
ity. In 29 minutes, he matched his
career high of 27 points on 10-for
-15 shooting. Haas was able to step
in at point guard for 15 minutes of
solid time, moving Barnes to his
more comfortable place on the
wing.
Regardless of his other options,
Montgomery wouldn't mind see
ing a little bit more consistency in
his lone senior.
"1 don't want him to have to
score 27," Montgomery said. "At
least for the time being, I want him
to play a little better, get others in
volved. Now that we moved Julius
over to the point, we know he can
score, but he also needs to get the
team knowing what they are sup
posed to do. If they are not sure
what they are doing, then we are
not going to be successful."

Known as Stanford basketball's
wild child, Barnes has the ability to
dismantle entire defenses with his
penetration.
The first big-stage display of his
talents came in the 2000 Pete
Newell Challenge against eventual
NCAA champion Duke. Barnes
was forced to step up and play 17
minutes while then-senior Mike
McDonald sat on the bench in foul
trouble. In addition to playing stel
lar defense on the Blue Devil's
Jason Williams, Barnes put up nine
points, three rebounds, two assists
and one block, as the Cardinal de
feated Duke on a last-second Jacob
sen shot.
As a junior, Barnes was given
more minutes and a starting role

after just seven games. His num
bers backed him up, as he averaged
10.9 points per game, trailing only
Borchardt and Jacobsen.
Against California on Jan. 4,
Barnes showed his true potential
with a career-high 27 points on the
night.
However, while he can create his
own shot and isn't afraid to take it,
he has often been overlooked in re
cent years for more conservative
options such as Tony Giovacchini
and McDonald.
The framework looked to be in
place diis year to maximize Barnes'
talents while maintaining the con
sistency of head coach Mike Mont
gomery's coaching style. Mont
gomery found control and stability
in Hernandez. And with two fresh
man point guards, Jason Haas and
Carlton Weatherby, joining the ros
ter, Barnes could be placed at the
two guard, allowing him the oppor
tunity to take more shots.
But with Hernandez gone for
the first four to six weeks of the sea
son, Barnes must now assume not
only the sentimental appointment
of team leader, but he must be the
floor leader as well, a position that
excites many Stanford fans.
Barnes' forced appointment at
the one is consistent with the over
all increased athleticism on the ros
ter. However, Barnes himself rec
ognizes that this increase in athleti

cism could mean a decrease in con
trol.
"I think the strength of the team
is our athleticism, but with that
comes lack of fundamentals,"
Barnes said. "Guys like myself, [ju
nior] Justin [Davis] and [sopho
more] Josh [Childress] are athletic,
but sometimes we do lack that fun
damental edge that other guys who
were here before us have pos
sessed."
If Tuesday's exhibition game
against the Olympic Club is any in
dication, Barnes is more that willing
to assume the offensive responsibil
ity. In 29 minutes, he matched his
career high of 27 points on 10-for
-15 shooting. Haas was able to step
in at point guard for 15 minutes of
solid time, moving Barnes to his
more comfortable place on the
wing.
Regardless of his other options,
Montgomery wouldn't mind see
ing a little bit more consistency in
his lone senior.
"1 don't want him to have to
score 27," Montgomery said. "At
least for the time being, I want him
to play a little better, get others in
volved. Now that we moved Julius
over to the point, we know he can
score, but he also needs to get the
team knowing what they are sup
posed to do. If they are not sure
what they are doing, then we are
not going to be successful."
He doesn't luive the resounding joviality
anci hugable teddy bear qualities of Mark
Mad sen.
Nor does he possess the wonder-kid rep
utation capable of drawing two, even three
defenders as Casey Jacobsen.
Like everything on this year's Stanford
men's basketball team, Julius Barnes is just a

little bit different from what Cardinal fans
are used to.
But while Barnes brings varied leader
ship and basketball skills to Maples Pavilion,
pobody is questioning the position he must
assume in the long line of Stanford legends.
As the only senior on this year's young squad
and the highest returning scorer, Barnes has
his work cut out for him. Because of the foot
injury to sophomore point guard Chris
Hernandez, Barnes' role becomes all the
more defined.
"I need to be more vocal this year,"
Barnes said. "We don't have guys like Casey
and Curtis [Borchardt] who weren't afraid

to get on people, or people from the
past like David Moseley and Mark
Madsen who weren't afraid to yell
at people.
"1 feel like my job is to get guys
on the same page when I am on the
floor. It definitely hurts that Chris is
out because it limits my ability to
score at the one. It is more that I
have to get other guys the ball. But
if I do get to the next level, that is
where I will be playing, so it is good
that I can get the experience."
