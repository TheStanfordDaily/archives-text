# Team Concept could prove to be a challenge for Card

### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
concludes its brief two-game exhibition
tour at 7:00 p.m. tonight with a game
against Team Concept, another one of
those traveling teams that's supposed to
provide the Cardinal with an easy prelude
in preparation for the regular season.
But, a quick look at Team Concept's ros
ter reveals a team laden with talent.
Team Concept features six players cur
rently playing in the WNBA: Lisa Burras
and LaQuanda Barksdale (Portland), Do
minique Canty (Detroit), LaTonya John
son (Utah), Takeisha Lewis (Seattle) and

LaTonya Washington (Washington). The
roster also includes Ericka Haney, a mem
ber of Notre Dame's 2001 NCAA c hampi
onship squad plus three other former colle
giate players.
Stanford hopes to duplicate its perfor
mance from Sunday, when the Cardinal
opened its preseason with an 89-73 victory
over Love 8c Basketball.
Sophomore forward T'NaeThiel posted
a double-double with 15 points and 10 re
bounds, and sophomores Sebnem Kirnya
cioglu and Azella Ferryman chipped in
with 13 points apiece.
That the Cardinal outrebounded Love
8c Basketball 38-32 was surely a
good sign for coach Tar a Van-
Derveer and company, since
they are trying to figure out a
way to shore up an otherwise un
proven inside corps, which lost
two key elements to graduation.
Both Bethany Donaphin and
Cori Enghusen left the Farm
after last year, although En

ghusen returned Sunday with
Love 8c Basketball and was the
team's leading scorer in the
game with 17 points.
As for Stanford's key post play
ers, Thiel grabbed her 10 boards,
while both Perryman and redshirt
sophomore Chelsea Trotter
pulled down six rebounds each.
The game also marked the re
turn of Susan King to the court
after sitting out nearly two years
due to knee problems.
King played 22 minutes, scor
ing nine points with five assists and

three steals â€” showing the spark
many expect her to provide this
Stanford club throughout the sea
son.
Meanwhile, three freshmen re
ceived their first taste of collegiate
basketball in the game. Guard
Krista Rappahahn knocked down
three 3-pointers, center Shelley
Nwekehad 13 productive minutes
with six points and three rebounds
and back-up point guard Claire
Bodensteiner gained some valu
able experience breaking Team
Concept's press.
