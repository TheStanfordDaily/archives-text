The Stanford women's basketball team
concludes its brief two-game exhibition
tour at 7:00 p.m. tonight with a game
against Team Concept, another one of
those traveling teams that's supposed to
provide the Cardinal with an easy prelude
in preparation for the regular season.
But, a quick look at Team Concept's ros
ter reveals a team laden with talent.
Team Concept features six players cur
rently playing in the WNBA: Lisa Burras
and LaQuanda Barksdale (Portland), Do
minique Canty (Detroit), LaTonya John
son (Utah), Takeisha Lewis (Seattle) and

LaTonya Washington (Washington). The
roster also includes Ericka Haney, a mem
ber of Notre Dame's 2001 NCAA c hampi
onship squad plus three other former colle
giate players.
Stanford hopes to duplicate its perfor
mance from Sunday, when the Cardinal
opened its preseason with an 89-73 victory
over Love 8c Basketball.
Sophomore forward T'NaeThiel posted
a double-double with 15 points and 10 re
bounds, and sophomores Sebnem Kirnya
cioglu and Azella Ferryman chipped in
with 13 points apiece.
