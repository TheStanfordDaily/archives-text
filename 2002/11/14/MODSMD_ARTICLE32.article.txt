						new year, a new team for Stanford

### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every year the college basketball sea
son ends in loss and disappointment for
all but one team, leaving basketball com
mentators to assess which teams under
or over-achieved.
Despite going undefeated in Pacific
-10 Conference play, earning a ranking as
high as No. 2 in the Associated Press poll
and finishing the season with a 32-3 over
all record, Stanford ended its 2001-2002
campaign on a disappointing note with a
lackluster loss to Colorado in the Sweet
16 of the NCAA tournament — a game
that many felt Stanford should have won.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer prefers,
however, to point to her team's remark
able accomplishments in the face of debil
itating injuries — most notably the loss of
point guard Susan King for most of the
season and leading scorer Lindsey Ya
masaki for the Pac-10 Tournament.
Stanford was, after all, the only Pac-10
team, men's or women's, to survive con
ference play with an unblemished 18-0
record last year.
"I think we had a great season last
year," VanDerveer said. "If was very dis
ruptive to our team when our leading
scorer [Yamasaki] had her appendix out
[before the Pac-10 Tournament]. lam
very proud of how our team did because
we also didn't have Susan. I think we
overachieved."
For the returning players, the theme
that emerged from last year's final game
seems to be a simple one: Learn from
your mistakes and move on.
When asked what went wrong against
an inspired Colorado team, sophomore
guard Sebnem Kimyacioglu explains,
"We got in a slump, and we didn't get our
selves out of it. Usually when something
like that happens, someone starts some
thing and you pick each other up. It didn't
happen for us. We were just in a daze."
Sophomore center Chelsea Trotter,
who sat out last season with knee injuries,
has a similar view.
"We should have won. During that
game we weren't very cohesive, and we
weren't a unit," Trotter said. "So what I
took from that game is the importance of
team unity."
Both players are quick to point out
that this is a new season with a complete
ly different team dynamic. Only four
players who logged minutes in the Col
orado game are on this year's roster.
Kimyacioglu emphasized that point:
"We have forgotten about that game.
The team is so different this year; it's in
the past. It's not going to happen again.

There are so many people here who are
ready to step up that, until a certain point
in the season, we didn't have last year. If
someone is feeling down, you jump right
on top of it, and you pick them back up
and get them back into the rhythm of
things."
Kimyacioglu also believes that the
younger players have learned from last
year and are taking more on their shoul
ders.
"Everyone has the green light," she
said. "I am being a lot more aggressive.
Last year 1 would catch the ball and think
who to pass to."

It is especially important that the
young players accept more responsibility
for the team's success because National
Player of the Year candidate junior
Nicole Powell is temporarily out of the
lineup clue to a bulging disk.
"The players feel a sense of urgency,"
VanDerveer said. "Everyone is going to
be important to our team's successes, and
they know that. There is no one who can
afford to be t he weakest link." She added
that her team has become closer because
it has had to deal with adversity and 1111-
