# Stanford needs Sixth Man
## 
### 
There is something fundamentally wrong
vviili being able to pace in the student sec
tion of a college basketball game. l ues
day night, 1 found myself walking a good
30 feet across the bleachers in the student section of
the "Sixth Man Section."
What the hell?
Last season, being a Sixth Man was one of my fa
vorite parts of the year. Every other Thursday and

Saturday, my friends and I would
drag our lazy asses off the couch
and stand in line outside of Maples
Pavilion.
There was nothing that could
have kept me from a game last
year, and soon we had our "offi
cial" seats. We would always sit in
the third row in the center, and

the people around us were con
sistently the same, too.

Behind us and to the left was "Funny Ciuy."
Every sporting event has a Funny Guy, a dude who
just gets on fire and soon has the whole bleachers
laughing. But last year's Funny Guy, well, he was
REALLY funny.
It's all about subtlety and research if you are
going to draw some laughs in the stands, and lie
always hit the other team where it hurt, whether
he was mocking Washington star Doug Wrenn
about his criminal record or mocking the Arizona
State coach for being a Danny Glover look-alike.
When Funny Guy was in the zone, no one could
stop him.
"Crude Guy" wasjust in front of us. He didn't ac
tually make his presence known until the beginning
ofTac-10 play. But when he was loud, EVERYONE
heard him. You know how sometimes you will beat
a football game and some drunk guy will yell some
thing obscene that doesn't really make sense? Well
Crude Guy was like that, except 100 times more
crude. Seriously, Larry Flynt would flinch if he
heard this guy.
Aside from the regulars, every game's student
section had a wide variety of personalities. There
was that one dude who just yelled "f%*#" for five
minutes after a bad call in the Oregon game. I
think he was too upset to ever really formulate a
sentence.
There was the guy in the red bandanna who was
always first in line and first into the student section.
He once tried to start a fight with UCLA forward
Matt Barnes (luckily, for both parties, I don't think
the fight ever actually happened).
And usually sitting on the floor in front of the
student section was the only Stanford football play

er to win the Heisman Award, Jim Plunkett.
Every game was a new experience. Who can for
get the time the guy sitting in the floor seats got hit
with a flying lemonade that was aimed for an Ari
zona fan. Yes, it sucked that his nice sweater got
drenched with some sugary water. But who yells at
a thousand screaming students? That is just asking
for trouble.
Or how about the time Joe Crispin made the half
court shot? 1 laving been cut by the Lakers, the for
mer Penn State star was in the area and attended
the game. Crispin was the contestant who was
picked to shoot a half court shot to win a Kobe
Bryant jersey at one of the games. He didn't just
make the half court shot, he swished it like it was a
10-foot jumper.
Or how about the girls who did jump-rope dur
ing halftime? It was so amazingly complex that I
can't even explain it. But if you saw it, you know
what I am talking about.
And I haven't even begun mentioning the actu
al basketball games yet. Casey Jacobsen dropping
49 points on the Sun Devils. The overtime loss to
Arizona. The absolute joy when Tony G. made a 3-
pointer to send the Oregon game into overtime.
Those are only snippets of an amazing season.
But being part of the Sixth Man Club is about
more than just basketball. It's about going crazy for
two hours. It's about losing your voice and rolling
your ankles on the wood benches of the student sec
tion. It's about being so tightly pack in that you can
barely breathe.
In its college basketball preview, The Sporting
News listed Maples Pavilion as one of the top-10
"toughest venues to play in."
Yes, I know Tuesday's game was an exhibition
game. But Arizona and Maryland had their exhibi
tion games on national TV, and they looked pretty
packed on Sports Center.
And, yes, I know we probably won't compete for
the Pac-10 title this season. But does that mean we
can't be loud and obnoxious?
This Monday, the Cardinal faces Boston Uni
versity in the first round of the preseason NIT. The
game is being broadcast on ESPN2, and it would
look pretty lousy if the student section were only
half full.
So come on out. Hey, maybe you will be this sea
son's Funny Guv.
