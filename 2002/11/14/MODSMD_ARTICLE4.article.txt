# DA cites insufficient evidence
## District Attorney's office confirms Peterson will not be charged with rape; University action not ruled out 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Victoria Brown, Santa Clara Connty's deputy district
attorney and head of the sex crimes unit, confirmed yes
terday that the District Attorney's office had decided not
to file charges against junior Nathan Peterson due to in
sufficient evidence.
Peterson was originally arrested on Oct. 24 for an in
cident alleged to have occurred on Oct. 19. The police
department arrested him on suspicion of rape and pen

etration with a foreign object.
Although the District Attorney's office has decided
not to file charges, the case may still be pursued through
Judicial Affairs at the University.
Marc Wais, dean of students, said that he could not
confirm or deny whether a complaint had been filed
with the University.
"It is our practice not to confirm or deny if a com
plaint has been forwarded to the Judicial Affairs Office
in our effort to maintain student confidentiality," he
said.
Daniel Barton, Peterson's lawyer, said that the Dis
trict Attorney's decision raises questions about the way
in which the Stanford Police Department handled the
case.
