# DA cites insufficient evidence
## District Attorney's office confirms Peterson will not be charged with rape; University action not ruled out 
### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Victoria Brown, Santa Clara Connty's deputy district
attorney and head of the sex crimes unit, confirmed yes
terday that the District Attorney's office had decided not
to file charges against junior Nathan Peterson due to in
sufficient evidence.
Peterson was originally arrested on Oct. 24 for an in
cident alleged to have occurred on Oct. 19. The police
department arrested him on suspicion of rape and pen

etration with a foreign object.
Although the District Attorney's office has decided
not to file charges, the case may still be pursued through
Judicial Affairs at the University.
Marc Wais, dean of students, said that he could not
confirm or deny whether a complaint had been filed
with the University.
"It is our practice not to confirm or deny if a com
plaint has been forwarded to the Judicial Affairs Office
in our effort to maintain student confidentiality," he
said.
Daniel Barton, Peterson's lawyer, said that the Dis
trict Attorney's decision raises questions about the way
in which the Stanford Police Department handled the
case.
"Sometimes with serious
charges the police department
works with the DA's office before
running out and making an ar
rest," he said. "That didn't happen
in this case.
"I think it's regrettable that the
Stanford Police Department didn't
get good legal advice before making
the arrest. It's especially regrettable
when doing that results in some
one's name in the paper as a rapist
and sex offender."
Barton also questioned the tim
ing of the arrest.
"There were apparently five
days [during which] the police
could have consulted with the Dis
trict Attorney, and they decided not
to do that. I think that's surprising

fora case of this nature.
By California law, a person must
be arraigned within 48 hours of an
arrest. However, if the arrest oc
curs on a Thursday or Friday, the
arraignment need not take place
until the following Monday or
Tuesday, forcing the accused to be
held in jail over the weekend unless
bail is posted.
Peterson, who was arrested on a
Thursday evening, would have
been held in Santa Clara County jail
until his arraignment the following
Tuesday had lie not made bail.
Barton said that he is pleased
with the decision the District Attor
ney has reached.
"I think we're lucky to have a Dis
trict Attorney's office that reviewed
the case as thoroughly as it did," he
said.
