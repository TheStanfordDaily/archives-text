Union workers from the Stan
ford and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospitals held an all-day
strike outside of the hospitals yes
terday in support of a new con
tract to resolve key points that re
main unresolved with the two hos
pitals' managements.
The hospitals continued to
function as normal, while elective
surgeries were rescheduled. Strik
ing workers included nursing as
sistants, laboratory technicians and
other support staff at the hospitals.
"This was a strike by support
staff," said the hospitals'
spokesperson, Maria La Ganga.
"The hospitals continued to be
staffed by trained professionals."
Union representatives estimat
ed that around 700 workers took
part in the strike, advocating a ban
on subcontracting union jobs; the
creation of a joint worker-man
agement committee on patient
care issues that would answer to an
outside arbiter; higher wages; and
a more achievable pay-scale.
"As a unit secretary, I have to
act like an octopus," said Loui des
Arafiles, who works at the Chil
dren's Hospital. "I feel like 1 need
eight hands to answer the phones
and care-needed lights of the pa
tients. We're understaffed and we

Oval to the Stanford and Lucile Packard Children's Hospitals in support of a
new contract between union workers and the hospitals' managements.
want a committee that will solve
these problems."
La Ganga said that senior staff
members at the hospital who are in
volved with patient-care Issues have not
reported short staffing as a problem.
Approximately 70 students,
most of whom were members of
the Coalition for Labor Justice and
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion, met at the Oval at noon yes
terday before marching to the hos
pitals to join the strikers. Many of
them carried pictures of the Uni
versity President John Hennessy's
smiling, bearded face.
The Coalition for Labor Justice,
an umbrella organization led by
the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion, includes a plethora of student
groups focused on bringing about
a campus-wide labor code of con
duct. They believe that the Office
of the President should play an ac
tive role in labor issues at all Stan
ford-affiliated institutions.
"We invited President Hen
nessy to join us in marching to the
hospital to show his support for
workers on campus," said senior
Meghana Reddy of the Stanford

Labor Action Coalition to the
crowd of students. "We invited
him, but he's not here."
Students from member groups
of the Coalition for Labor Justice
participated at the strike.
"As an institution of higher learn
ing, Stanford needs to institutional
ize a way to show respect for work
ers," said senior Jeramie Scott, the
outgoing representative of the Stan
ford chapter of the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People, which is affiliated with
the Coalition for Labor Justice. "A
code of conduct is a way to do this."
Ximena Martinez, co-chair of
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan, or MEChA, said, "As Mechis
tas, we want to show our full support
for workers because we view them as
our family, as our parents, as our
people, and it's so important to
show our solidarity with them."
Hai Binh, a member of the
Stanford Asian American Activism
Coalition, said, "There's a broad
student coalition behind the work
ers â€” it doesn't matter which com
munities the students are from."
Stanford workers from the
main campus were also present.
"We're trying to show our fellow
workers that we're here for them,"
said Suki Manman, who works in
the Facility Operations glass shop.

"We want to let the management
know that we're behind our broth
ers and sisters in the union."
Redwood City Council Member
Ira Ruskin, who spoke to strikers
yesterday evening, said, "It's impor
tant that support workers be fairly
treated at major institutions where
they make valuable contributions."
Workers at the strike empha
sized that they were striking for
better patient care, rather than just
increased wages.
"Stanford put a lot of money on the
table for the workers," said Ana Es
quivel, a nursing assistant at die Chil
dren's Hospital. "Rut we're here fight
ing for quality care for our patients."
The strike officially ended at 5
a.m. diis morning, and all union
members will resume working today.
"We value these employees and
we'll be happy to have them back,"
La Canga said.
While it is not clear what will
happen next, both sides have said
that they are willing to resume
negotiations.
The hospitals have contacted a
federal mediator to take part in fu
ture talks. Federal mediators usu
ally enter into labor negotiations
when both sides are willing to sit
down and discuss specifics con
tract issues and try to bring them
to agreement.
