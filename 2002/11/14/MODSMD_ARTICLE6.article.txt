# Scholars address Iraq policy
## Panelists discuss role of oil in U.S. motivation for war 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a panel entitled "Iraq: War or Diplo
macy?" held last night in Annenberg Audito
rium, four Stanford scholars from a wide
range of expertise came together in a forum
to discuss Iraq and United States foreign
policy in the recent past and coming months.
Discussion centered on issues such as Iraq's
possession of biological and chemical
weapons, the inevitability of war, the role of
oil in U.S.-Iraq relations, and the impor
tance of examining the consequences of war.
The panelists were President Emeritus
Gerhard Casper, Law Prof. John Barton, As
sociate Prof, of History and Middle East ex
pert Ahmad Dallal, and Senior Research
Scholar with the lIS and former Deputy As
sistant Secretary of Defense Elizabeth Sher
wood-Randall.
The event was co-sponsored by the Insti
tute for International Studies and Stanford
Law School and was moderated by Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan.
"Iraq is a major foreign policy issue for the
United States at this time," said Klas
Bergman, associate director of communica
tions for lIS, who was involved in organizing
the event."It is important to provide a forum
for public discussion in the Stanford commu
nity. I can think of little that is more important

than war and peace in the Middle East."
Barton said, "The purpose, at least in my
mind, was to clarify the issues. I view it as ex
planation and analysis rather than as advo
cacy, because I think that is what is needed in
a university context. We need to understand
before we can advocate."
The discussion was especially timely given
the approval of the United Nations resolu
tion on Iraq last Friday and Iraq's accep
tance of the resolution yesterday.
"Your presence reflects many Americans'
concern with the state of the world, worried
about the possibility that nuclear and biolog
ical weapons can get into the wrong hands
and be used against us," Sherwood-Randall
told the audience.
Dallal said he believes that while Iraq does
have chemical and biological weapons, it
does not have the ability to move them out
side its borders. I le noted that many of Iraq's
neighbors do not think it can initiate an ex
pansive attack.
"Few people would refute that Saddam
11 ussein is a brutal despot," Dallal said. How
ever, Dallal later added that Hussein is not
suicidal like Osama bin Laden and is there
fore less likely to use nuclear or biological
weapons rashly.
But Dallal fears the consequences of an
invasion of Iraq because he said the possibil
ity of 1 lussein using weapons is greater if an
invasion occurs.
Sherwood-Randall emphasized that the

threat of force is key to making
diplomacy succeed.
"Without force to back it up,
diplomacy is weak," she said. " The
best case possible is to avoid going
to war, but we have to be real in
our willingness to use force."
Barton worried that, given the
history of how Iraq has dealt with
weapons inspectors in the past, there
still could be a future military crisis.
"Iraq has a history of difficulty
with inspectors," he said. "Be sure
there will be a set of crises later on
when Iraq complicates the life of
the inspectors."
Dallal feels that while war is not
inevitable, the Bush administra
tion seems to have made a decision
to go to war one way or the other,
and that there is not enough focus
on the aftermath of a military con
frontation.
Dallal expressed concern
about lack of consideration for
post-war Iraq and the aftermath
of an invasion.

"No one is thinking of founda
tions fora new Iraqi regime," he
said.
Sullivan asked the panelists to ad
dress U.S. reasons for wanting to go
to war. While they agreed dial there
are many reasons lor the prospective
war, the panelists disputed over
whether oil was the main factor.
Casper was skeptical about the
oil argument, citing that the U.S.
will have oil either way. Sherwood-
Randall echoed the skepticism.
"I don't think this is principally
about oil," she said. "I think the ad
ministration has genuinely decid
ed that Iraq poses a threat."
Dallal disagreed.
"I think oil is a part of it,"he said,
noting that he believes there are
many causes for the possible war in
cluding the U.S. perception that
Hussein is a threat to security and
that Bush's actions are a continua
tion of what his father started.
Dallal also cited a new strategic
document as a primary cause for
the war, which Casper focused on
in his opening remarks.
"We are a republic character
ized by separation of powers and
checks and balances," Casper said.

"[The National Security Strategy
of the United States released Sept.
17] is primarily a statement of how
the government sees global bal
ance of power and what needs to
be done."
Casper worries that the docu
ment depicts a readiness by the ex
ecutive branch to go to war, pre
emptively if necessary, a strategy
which he said has not received
enough public scrutiny.
Despite some criticism of the
Bush administration, members of
(he panel recognized its attempts
to reconcile public opinion and
gain international support. Sher
wood-Randall pointed out that the
U.S. listened to the world when it
stressed that the U.S. not "go it
alone" or pursue military action
before exhausting other actions.
"[The] administration recog
nized the need to engage a broad
er number of countries and the
need to get Congress on board,"
she said. "The only way to pressure
Saddam Hussein to go where we
want him to go is to show him he is
isolated, even from his closest al
lies. If you favor diplomacy over
war, you want Saddam here."

"Without force to back it up,
diplomacy is weak," she said. " The
best case possible is to avoid going
to war, but we have to be real in
our willingness to use force."
Barton worried that, given the
history of how Iraq has dealt with
weapons inspectors in the past, there
still could be a future military crisis.
"Iraq has a history of difficulty
with inspectors," he said. "Be sure
there will be a set of crises later on
when Iraq complicates the life of
the inspectors."
Dallal feels that while war is not
inevitable, the Bush administra
tion seems to have made a decision
to go to war one way or the other,
and that there is not enough focus
on the aftermath of a military con
frontation.
Dallal expressed concern
about lack of consideration for
post-war Iraq and the aftermath
of an invasion.

"No one is thinking of founda
tions fora new Iraqi regime," he
said.
Sullivan asked the panelists to ad
dress U.S. reasons for wanting to go
to war. While they agreed dial there
are many reasons lor the prospective
war, the panelists disputed over
whether oil was the main factor.
Casper was skeptical about the
oil argument, citing that the U.S.
will have oil either way. Sherwood-
Randall echoed the skepticism.
"I don't think this is principally
about oil," she said. "I think the ad
ministration has genuinely decid
ed that Iraq poses a threat."
Dallal disagreed.
"I think oil is a part of it,"he said,
noting that he believes there are
many causes for the possible war in
cluding the U.S. perception that
Hussein is a threat to security and
that Bush's actions are a continua
tion of what his father started.
Dallal also cited a new strategic
document as a primary cause for
the war, which Casper focused on
in his opening remarks.
"We are a republic character
ized by separation of powers and
checks and balances," Casper said.

"[The National Security Strategy
of the United States released Sept.
17] is primarily a statement of how
the government sees global bal
ance of power and what needs to
be done."
Casper worries that the docu
ment depicts a readiness by the ex
ecutive branch to go to war, pre
emptively if necessary, a strategy
which he said has not received
enough public scrutiny.
Despite some criticism of the
Bush administration, members of
(he panel recognized its attempts
to reconcile public opinion and
gain international support. Sher
wood-Randall pointed out that the
U.S. listened to the world when it
stressed that the U.S. not "go it
alone" or pursue military action
before exhausting other actions.
"[The] administration recog
nized the need to engage a broad
er number of countries and the
need to get Congress on board,"
she said. "The only way to pressure
Saddam Hussein to go where we
want him to go is to show him he is
isolated, even from his closest al
lies. If you favor diplomacy over
war, you want Saddam here."
At a panel entitled "Iraq: War or Diplo
macy?" held last night in Annenberg Audito
rium, four Stanford scholars from a wide
range of expertise came together in a forum
to discuss Iraq and United States foreign
policy in the recent past and coming months.
Discussion centered on issues such as Iraq's
possession of biological and chemical
weapons, the inevitability of war, the role of
oil in U.S.-Iraq relations, and the impor
tance of examining the consequences of war.
The panelists were President Emeritus
Gerhard Casper, Law Prof. John Barton, As
sociate Prof, of History and Middle East ex
pert Ahmad Dallal, and Senior Research
Scholar with the lIS and former Deputy As
sistant Secretary of Defense Elizabeth Sher
wood-Randall.
The event was co-sponsored by the Insti
tute for International Studies and Stanford
Law School and was moderated by Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan.
"Iraq is a major foreign policy issue for the
United States at this time," said Klas
Bergman, associate director of communica
tions for lIS, who was involved in organizing
the event."It is important to provide a forum
for public discussion in the Stanford commu
nity. I can think of little that is more important

than war and peace in the Middle East."
Barton said, "The purpose, at least in my
mind, was to clarify the issues. I view it as ex
planation and analysis rather than as advo
cacy, because I think that is what is needed in
a university context. We need to understand
before we can advocate."
The discussion was especially timely given
the approval of the United Nations resolu
tion on Iraq last Friday and Iraq's accep
tance of the resolution yesterday.
"Your presence reflects many Americans'
concern with the state of the world, worried
about the possibility that nuclear and biolog
ical weapons can get into the wrong hands
and be used against us," Sherwood-Randall
told the audience.
Dallal said he believes that while Iraq does
have chemical and biological weapons, it
does not have the ability to move them out
side its borders. I le noted that many of Iraq's
neighbors do not think it can initiate an ex
pansive attack.
"Few people would refute that Saddam
11 ussein is a brutal despot," Dallal said. How
ever, Dallal later added that Hussein is not
suicidal like Osama bin Laden and is there
fore less likely to use nuclear or biological
weapons rashly.
But Dallal fears the consequences of an
invasion of Iraq because he said the possibil
ity of 1 lussein using weapons is greater if an
invasion occurs.
Sherwood-Randall emphasized that the
