### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a panel entitled "Iraq: War or Diplo
macy?" held last night in Annenberg Audito
rium, four Stanford scholars from a wide
range of expertise came together in a forum
to discuss Iraq and United States foreign
policy in the recent past and coming months.
Discussion centered on issues such as Iraq's
possession of biological and chemical
weapons, the inevitability of war, the role of
oil in U.S.-Iraq relations, and the impor
tance of examining the consequences of war.
The panelists were President Emeritus
Gerhard Casper, Law Prof. John Barton, As
sociate Prof, of History and Middle East ex
pert Ahmad Dallal, and Senior Research
Scholar with the lIS and former Deputy As
sistant Secretary of Defense Elizabeth Sher
wood-Randall.
The event was co-sponsored by the Insti
tute for International Studies and Stanford
Law School and was moderated by Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan.
"Iraq is a major foreign policy issue for the
United States at this time," said Klas
Bergman, associate director of communica
tions for lIS, who was involved in organizing
the event."It is important to provide a forum
for public discussion in the Stanford commu
nity. I can think of little that is more important

than war and peace in the Middle East."
Barton said, "The purpose, at least in my
mind, was to clarify the issues. I view it as ex
planation and analysis rather than as advo
cacy, because I think that is what is needed in
a university context. We need to understand
before we can advocate."
The discussion was especially timely given
the approval of the United Nations resolu
tion on Iraq last Friday and Iraq's accep
tance of the resolution yesterday.
"Your presence reflects many Americans'
concern with the state of the world, worried
about the possibility that nuclear and biolog
ical weapons can get into the wrong hands
and be used against us," Sherwood-Randall
told the audience.
Dallal said he believes that while Iraq does
have chemical and biological weapons, it
does not have the ability to move them out
side its borders. I le noted that many of Iraq's
neighbors do not think it can initiate an ex
pansive attack.
"Few people would refute that Saddam
11 ussein is a brutal despot," Dallal said. How
ever, Dallal later added that Hussein is not
suicidal like Osama bin Laden and is there
fore less likely to use nuclear or biological
weapons rashly.
But Dallal fears the consequences of an
invasion of Iraq because he said the possibil
ity of 1 lussein using weapons is greater if an
invasion occurs.
Sherwood-Randall emphasized that the
