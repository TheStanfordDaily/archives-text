# A
						look at caffeine consumption at Stanford
## Cult of the Red Bull 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
How many Stanford students
are addicted to a drug that has been
linked to a range ofconditions from
insomnia to acute confusion states
to coronary heart disease? It Amer
ican adults are any indication, be
tween 80 percent and 90 percent of
the students on campus may be reg
ular users of such a drug: caffeine.
It's not difficult to see how caf
feine could be the most consumed
drug in the U.S., when you consid
er how easy it is to ingest the more
than 300 milligrams that half of
American adults take on a daily
basis. A 6-ounce cup of normal cof
fee has about 100 mg of caffeine,
while the same volume of brewed
tea has about 70.
Soft drinks usually have 50 mg
in their 12-ounce servings, al
though Jolt has 70. For those really
needing the stimulating effect, the
over-the-counter drugs Vivarin
and Dexatrim have 200 mg of caf
feine per tablet, compared to the
100 mg in another drug, No-doz.
Why would students need that
much caffeine? The obvious an
swer is, to study.
"It's not uncommon to see
people stocking up on Red Bull
during exams," said sophomore
Candace Lewis.
Lewis, who plans to major in
international relations or political
science, noted that she drinks a
lot of caffeine, typically a cup of
coffee and two or three cans of
soda a day. However, students
said that the popular opinion is
that techie majors use the most
caffeine.
"CS majors drink the most,
since they have famous overnight
coding sessions," said junior
Cheng Wang, a chemical engi
neering major.

"Computer science would defi
nitely be very high on that list be
cause they often stay up program
ming, but I would think fuzzy ma
jors would also [consume a lot of
caffeine] when they have big pa
pers due," noted sophomore Ar
turo Caballero, a computer science
major.
Caballero explained that he
drinks several cups of Coca-Cola a
day. Other popular caffeine choic
es are plain coffee or Starbucks
Frappuccinos. Students take
espresso shots, Red Bull drinks or
caffeine pills for when extra ener
gy is needed. Some interesting al
ternatives were also mentioned.
"Unfortunately, they haven't
invented the caffeine IV yet,"
Wang lamented. "Still, I really like
chocolate-covered roasted coffee
beans, and I'm very curious about
the caffeinated soap, where you
absorb caffeine through your
skin."
Even though students say they
may sometimes find a lot of caf
feine necessary to get all their work
done, there can be other reasons
for continuing with large-scale caf
feine consumption.
"Lately, I think I drink so much
out of habit more than anything,"
Lewis said. "If I don't, I get a mas
sive withdrawal headache," she
added.
Headaches are just one of the
many problems that can be
caused by caffeine withdrawal.
Fatigue, depression, anxiety,
nausea and impaired motor abil
ity can also occur when the
adrenaline that caffeine triggers
wears off.
Adrenaline is released when
caffeine binds to adenosine recep
tors in the brain, preventing
adenosine from binding and slow
ing down nerve-cell activity. This
process occurs quickly after caf

feine consumption, with blood lev
els typically reaching a peak half an
hour to an hour later, though caf
feine may stay in the body for up to
12 hours.
With a constant supply of caf
feine in the bloodstream, it is easy
to develop a tolerance to the effects
of caffeine, leading to increased
consumption.
"Relief of withdrawal symp
toms appears to be a substantial
component of the satisfaction of
coffee drinking, particularly the
first cup of the day," noted Dr.
Neal Benowitz of UCSF, a local
expert in all things caffeine.
Caffeine addiction may also be
attributed in part to the drug's
ability to trigger an increase in

dopamine, a neurotransmitter as
sociated with pleasure. Although
the effect is smaller, it is compara
ble to that of amphetamines like
heroine and cocaine.
As a stimulant, caffeine also
shares many of the dangers of
these drugs.
"In higher doses, caffeine may
produce insomnia, anxiety,
tremors and seizures," Dr.
Benowitz explained.
Despite the dangers and daily
negative side effects, caffeine con
tinues to be a part of many stu
dents' lives.
Wangjoked, "We need it. With
out caffeine, we'd find ourselves
with an unacceptably high amount
of sleep."
