German Lab and SLAC tag team to develop X-ray
free-electron lasers
The Deutsches-Elektronen-Synchrotron, Germany's leading particle
physics and synchrotron radiation laboratory, and the U.S. Department
of Energy's Stanford Linear Accelerator Center recently signed a Mem
orandum of Understanding, thereby launching a collaborative effort to
develop X-ray free-electron lasers.
The lasers can pulse one thousand times faster and 10 billion times
brighter than existing lasers. Once created, these ultra-brilliant beams
can enhance the fields of chemistry, biology and materials science by al
lowing people to access minuscule areas that are currently inaccessible by
the most sophisticated technology.
"We are all excited by the colossal discovery potential of X-ray free
electron lasers," said SLAC Director Jonathan Dorfan. "International
collaboration is the most efficient, responsible and cost-effective way of
building world-class science facilities. There is already dynamic collabo
ration between SLAC, DESY and the KEK laboratory in Japan on re
search and development fora future high-energy physics linear collid
er. Today's agreement establishes stronger bonds between internation
al centers of excellence."
The collaboration between DESY and SLAC is based on exchange of
personnel, data and research results.
Press symposium to shed light on the future
of news
On Nov. 18, three prominent journalism experts — Geneva Over
holser, Thomas Patterson and Tom Rosenstiel — will speak about the
future of news at the Carlos McClatchy Memorial Symposium. The sym
posium, which starts at 3:45 p.m. in Braun Auditorium, is free and open
to the public.
"These are three top thinkers [in] journalism," said James Bettinger,
professor of communication and director of the Knight journalism fel
lowships program. "They can help us all understand what is happening
to news, and why we should care. Basically, news is essential to democ
racy and self-governing, and when it is threatened, so is society."
Overholser currently holds the Curtis B. Hurley Chair in Public Af
fairs Reporting for the University of Missouri School of Journalism in its
Washington Journalism Center and has her own column in the Colum
bia Journalism Review.
Patterson is the Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press in the
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Rosenstiel is the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism
in Washington, D.C. and vice chairman of the Committee of Concerned
Journalists, a group of about I,ooojournalists who discuss the values of
journalism.
The McClatchy Symposium is sponsored by the Department of Com
munication.
Abuza to discuss war on terror in Southeast Asia
Today, Prof. Zachary Abuza of Simmons College in Boston, will be
discussing t he eflects of the war on terror in Southeast Asia.
Abuza, who has been featured on Jim Lehrer's "Newsllour," has writ
ten "Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam" and was a visiting
researcher at the Institute of International Relations in Hanoi. He has
spoken on Southeast Asian subjects before Congress and at the State De
partment. Recently, Abuza wrote a book about al-Qaida's presence in
Southeast Asia.
"[Abuza] has a book coming out next spring that is rather unorthodox
in the academic world," said Neeley Main, program coordinator for the
Asia/Pacific Research Center. "The research for this book consisted
largely of conducting interviews and conversations with people from all
levels of the Indonesian security forces."
Abuza will be discussing such details as the jihadist violence and the
moderation of the Muslims in Southeast Asia, counter-terror policy and
the al-Qaida network.
The program, which is free and open to the public, will take place
from noon to 1:15 p.m. in the Philippines Conference Room, located on
the third floor in the east wing of Encina Hall.
