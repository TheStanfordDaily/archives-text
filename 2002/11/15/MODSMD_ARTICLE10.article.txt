## Rumsfeld discusses possible war 
### 
WASHIN(.TON (AP) — 1 he
United States is "prepared and
concerned" about possible Iraq
sponsored terrorist attacks if
President Bush orders a war to
disarm Saddam Hussein, De
fense Secretary Donald H. Rums
feld said yesterday.
Rumsfeld also said the Iraqi
leader could launch chemical or
biological attacks on U.S. troops.
"There is a danger that Sad
dam Hussein would do things
he's done previously. He has in
the past used chemical weapons,"
Rumsfeld said. "One has to be
prepared and concerned that
could occur.
"I have no doubt that if he's
able, he would like to see that ter
rorist attacks occur in the event
that military action was taken."
If the United States uses mili
tary force to oust Saddam, Rums
feld said, there would be a mili
tary command in Iraq while au
thorities tried to track down all of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruc
tion— a task Rumsfeld earlier
said could take many months.
Then some sort of interim gov
ernment of Iraqis should take
control, Rumsfeld said.
Iraq probably would not be able
to fight for very long after a U.S.-led
invasion, Rumsfeld said, noting that
ground combat in the 1991 Persian
Gulf War lasted just 100 hours.
"I can't sav if the use of force

would last five days or five weeks or
five months, but it certainly isn't
going to last any longer than that,"
Rumsfeld said. "It won't be a
World War III."
He rejected Saddam's claims
that Iraq lias no chemical, biologi
cal or nuclear weapons programs.
"We know that Saddam Hus

sein has chemical and biological
weapons, and we know he has an
active program for development of
nuclear weapons," Rumsfeld said.
But Rumsfeld sidestepped a
question on whether the United
States would respond with nuclear
weapons if Iraq were to use chem
ical or biological weapons.
