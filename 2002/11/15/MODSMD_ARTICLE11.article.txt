JARRATf, Va. (AP) — A Pakistani man who
killed two CIA employees in a 1993 shooting ram
page outside the agency's headquarters was exe
cuted yesterday as the State Department warned of
global retaliation against Americans.
Aimal Khan Kasi, 38, died by injection at the
Greensville Correctional Center at 9:07 p.m.
"There is no god but Allah," Kasi said, softly
chanting in his native tongue until he lost con
sciousness.
Hours before the execution, the U.S. Supreme
Court rejected an appeal and Gov. Mark R. Warn
er denied a request for clemency, saying Kasi has
"shown absolutely no remorse for his actions."
Last week, the State Department warned that

Kasi's execution could lead to acts of vengeance
against Americans everywhere. Two days after his
conviction, assailants shot and killed four
American oil company workers in Karachi, Pakistan.
Some Pakistani politicians pleaded with Ameri
can officials to spare Kasi's life, saying commutation
could "win the hearts of millions" and help the
United States in its war on terrorism. Hundreds of
religious students protested in Pakistan this week,
warning Americans there that they will not be safe
if Kasi dies.
Kasi killed CIA communications worker Frank
Darling, 28, and CIA analyst and physician Lansing
Bennett, 66, as they sat in their cars at a stoplight in
McLean.
