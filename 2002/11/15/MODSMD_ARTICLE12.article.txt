# Hu Jintao to head Communist Party
## 
### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” Vice Presi
dent Hu Jintao was appointed
today as leader of China's Com
munist Party, handing him the
country's most powerful position
and making him a certain bet to re
place Jiang Zemin as president
next year.
1 lis appointment as general sec
retary positions the little-known
Hu at the head of a new genera
tion of leaders who will guide
China through sweeping changes
and economic reforms launched
by Deng Xiaoping and his succes
sor, Jiang. Meanwhile, Jiang was
re-elected to head China's power

ful military commission.
"This is a united, triumphant
and highly progressive meeting, as
well as a meeting which has carried
on the past and opened a new chap
ter for the future," Hu told re
porters inside the hulking Great
Hall of the People in central Beijing.
He immediately credited Jiang
for laying the groundwork for his
leadership and the party's future.
The party posts symbolize the
true power of China's govern
ment. Although the president is
the head of state in China, his
power is derived from his party
position. Jiang held both posts

since he was named president in
1993.
The eight other newly named
members of the inner-sanctum
Politburo Standing Committee fol
lowed Hu in and stood to his left.
Among them: top officials Luo
Gan and Wen Jiabao.
Wen, now vice premier, is ex
pected to replace the reform
minded Premier Zhu Rongji, who
is also retiring. Luo, the architect
of China's law-enforcement poli
cies, is considered a particularly
hard-line leader who is in the
midst of a public campaign to
tighten controls on the Internet.
