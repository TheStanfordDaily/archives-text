## The 						Stanford Daily Students should determine use of ASSU surplus 
### 
Recently, ASSU leaders debated
whether to redistribute a fee surplus
of approximately $350,000, a figure
representing the accumulation of
special fee collections over many years, since as
early as the 19705. Surplus fees originate from
two fee surcharges, one of which is assessed di
rectly to students. Fee surcharges allow the
ASSU to honor special fee refund requests, by
collecting extra money from students which is
then deposited into a buffer fund.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed several alternatives for redistributing
the surplus funds, including financing a new
student union, improving the ASSU banking
system, providing refunds to students or real
locating the funds to the ASSU endowment.
We believe the most appropriate approach

through a vote or similar procedure, as is done
in the regular distribution of special fees. If such
a mandate is not reached, another response
would be for the ASSU to return fees to the stu
dents who have contributed over die past 30
years â€” but this solution would be impractical
and cost-ineffective.
Past ASSU leaders have favored meaningful
benefits for fewer people over trifling benefits
for all. But such a bias has resulted in the ASSU
enacting policies contrary to the prevailing
wishes of students, who often prefer an individ
ual benefit of any amount to a large investment
that they may not necessarily benefit from.
While we applaud the ASSU for its attempts
to expedite the construction of a student
union, we do not believe it to be fiscally pru
dent for the ASSU to assume the burden of fi
nancing such a venture through surplus fee
collections. Rather, the ASSU should obtain a

student mandate for such a decision. This
would allow it to take a leadership role in rais
ing sufficient funds, while becoming an instru
ment for students and University officials to
mutually determine the best course of action.
Earmarking surplus special fee collections
for future capital projects is contrary to the
role of the ASSU as a representative body, as
it oversteps its bounds of power. Fee money is
distributed according to student voter prefer
ences. Lacking a similar directive about how
to manage excess funds, ASSU leaders must
not appropriate potentially large sums of
money by a process separate from that by
which special fees are regularly distributed.
Furthermore, ASSU leaders should annually
review the year's fee collection, with the aim
of determining how any excess fees should be
redistributed.
It is easy to fault the ASSU's fee collection

process. However, the Stanford electorate
must share part of the responsibility. In the
most recent election, more than 50 special fee
requests were passed, by voters perhaps un
aware of the consequences such actions would
have on student fees.
The ASSIJ has an admirable history of fiscal
prudence that allows it to maintain indepen
dence from the University. In order to contin
ue this tradition, ASSU leaders should strive
fora more transparent fee collection process,
allowing student to better judge the conse
quences of their special fee votes and the path
of their dollars. Such a measure of external ac
countability must be accompanied by an inter
nal effort to restrain the ASSU leadership from
taking matters into their own hands, so that de
cisions about the potential reallocation of
$350,000 does not fall into the exclusive do
main of a self-selected few.
