# THE
						WAY I SEE IT
## Myths of a 'Third World' 
### 
This started out as a piece about
how people in the "First World"
should stop asking dumb ques
tions about life in the "Third World," as
they often do when they meet me, because
I am from South Africa. I was going to
write about questions like: Do you have
electricity? Where did you learn to speak
English? So, where there lots of lions
around when you were growing up? But
that didn't really flow.

The other day, one of I
my professors asked us to
think about why the
world should care about
Africa. At the time, it was
hard for us to come up
with a reason, since Africa
is not exactly an econom
ic powerhouse, and it
doesn't really have a lot of

/
clout in the global political arena — so
why should the West adopt anything
other than a paternalistic, oh-what-a-pity
you're-doing-so-badly-over-there-here's-
some-money-so-our-constituents-can-see-
how-we-help-the-poor-and-su fieri ng atti
tude toward the continent?
Of course now that I've had some time
to mull over this, 1 can think of many rea
sons for the West to adopt a very different
standpoint.
First, here are the answers to the ques
tions I began with: Yes, we do have elec
tricity. We have cities, too. Real urban
areas with skyscrapers and malls and
ATMs. And we have internet and cell
phones and palm pilots and all that other
good stuff without which we could not
imagine life here at Stanford.
And I learned to speak English at home
and in school —just like Americans — ex
cept that we had to take English every quar
ter of every year of school, unlike Ameri
cans, which is why I can use words like "lest"
and "truncate" in everyday conversation
whereas often, Americans, even American
Stanford students, can't. In fact, in my
country it is rare to find someone who can
only speak one language. We're too diverse
(in the true sense) for that, so we learn to
communicate on each other's terms. So the
average person speaks at least three lan
guages, but more likely about five.
Now, the one about the lions is a little
too bizarre to deserve real attention (no, we
don't have lions roaming the streets —
don't you think they would be scared of the
cars?), but it illustrate my point: If someone
can ask me with a straight face whether I
have grown up dodging lions, that shows
me a lot about their perceptions of the
place that I come from, and it also tells me
something about the way that the West
thinks about the continent.
The West still looks at Africa as a dark,
savage and faraway place that is vastly
"underdeveloped" and that is currently
being torn apart by scourges like civil
war and AIDS. Of course, you get this
from the media, which is never going to

give you an accurate portrayal of any
part of the world. So if all you see of
Africa is starving children, people walk
ing around with guns, military coups
and corrupt regimes, it doesn't surprise
me that you would think that is what the
everyday African experience is about.
Hut it's not. It's really, really not. Or let
me say this: It's not like that for all of us.
Yes, some people are starving, many are
dying of AIDS, and quite a few African
governments are really unstable — but it
is not like that all over the continent, and it
is not like that for all people. The true
tragedy of the African experience is the
stark disparity between the good life and
the bad life. That is a leftover of the colo
nial experience, which is one reason that
those who benefited from colonialism —
the West — should care. This is also why a
businessman can get into his BMW X5 in
an African city and, after a 20-minute
drive, find himself next to a corrugated
iron shack built up on a sand dune, some-

times housing up to 15 people. It's like two
worlds in one, and each world has some
thing to teach and show you, and some
thing new to expose you to.
But you would need to travel there and
experience the place firsthand before you
could realize that. Go there and see, but
not so that you can come back with curios
and artifacts and stories for your friends
about the quaint villager you encountered
who learned some English while talking to
you. Go so that you can appreciate the
quality of life that is available, the beauty of
the place, the culture of the people and the
rich historical background. (Jo and appre
ciate these things about Africa on Africa's
terms, and then you will see why it is that
we cannot afford not to care.
My home is not the dusty, dirty, vio
lent place you're thinking of. It is beauti
ful, alive and vibrant, and it offers a qual
ity of life that is unparalleled. The only
shame is the number of its own citizens
who will not get to enjoy that part. Don't
let that be because the West didn't care
about Africa.
