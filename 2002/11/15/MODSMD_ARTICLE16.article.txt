Turn on your bike light!
There is an ongoing problem on cam
pus involving flagrant violation of the
headlight requirement for bicycles. I have
brought this matter to the attention ofThe
Daily and the police and transportation de
partments in the past, and there has been
no improvement in the situation over the
past three years since I began my unofficial
"tracking" of bicycles riding on the campus
roadways after dark. It only becomes obvi
ous to me during the few months of the
year when I leave my campus office at dusk
or after dark, beginning with the time
change at the end of October. During these
months, 1 take a nightly "poll" of how
many bicycles I encounter on the roadways
that are riding with and without head
lights. On any given evening, 1 typically
encounter between 10 and 15 bicycles with
a yield of, at most, four of those using prop
er lighting. Most evenings I find that one,
or none, are lighted.
A series of incidents last night prompt
ed me to write. During my evening com
mute off campus I was, as usual, looking
for bicycles (not just to count them, but to
keep from hitting them). At the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, 1 stopped,
looked both ways and, seeing nothing,
slowly proceeded forward. Out of the dark
from the right, a bicyclist let out a shout
and had to swerve sharply to prevent her
self from hitting my vehicle. She was com
ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor
ner. Had she collided with my vehicle,
she would have injured herself badly. I
stopped, rolled down my window, and
asked her what she was doing riding at
night without any lighting on her bike. I
told her she was not at ail visible and if she
continued riding like that she was going to

get hit. She just stared at me, stunned,
shaken and speechless.
I turned the corner and, slower than
usual, proceeded down Santa Teresa.
Shortly, I encountered a group of about
five bicyclists riding double and triple
abreast along the side of the roadway.
There was no lighting on the rear of any of
the bikes. As I passed them, I checked my
rearview mirror to see if any of them had
headlights. There were none visible. 1
pulled over, put on my emergency flash
ers, stopped, got out and faced the on
coming group. By this time, they had
pulled out in front of the oncoming cars
and were trying to go around me. 1
shouted for them to stop and asked them
why they were riding without headlights
as the law requires. One young woman
reached over her handlebars and pulled
up a very weakly lit headlight that had
been facing downward and said, "My bike
has a light." I told her it was not at all vis
ible and therefore was useless. I told them
1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of
me. She stopped in time and yelled,
"Sorry!" as I drove past.
I have heard and read many accusa
tions against uncourteous car drivers on
campus who speed, run through stop
signs, don't watch out for bicycles, and so
on. Yet in my 1 2 years of driving on cam
pus, I have encountered very few such
drivers, and actually, none since I began
my conscious observations.
I recall a few years ago when I lived in
Cupertino that my son was given a traffic

ticket for riding his hike through a stop
sign without stopping. Surely, traffic tick
ets could be given out to students riding
around campus after dark without lights.
Offering free hike lights is good, but it is
not enough. I believe it is time fora tough
crackdown on such offenders. Their lives
are at stake.

Sacrificing liberty for security's sake
would be tragic
The editorial on the USA Patriot Act
phrases matters very well, and I would like
to commend the editorial board for it
("University should take stand against Pa
triot Act," Nov. 14).
Inherent in the notion of liberty is secu
rity, from others and from the govern
ment. Though I agree that the threat of
terrorism is immediate, 1 fail to see how
curbing the rights of all students from
countries that had nothing to do with the
Sept. 11 attack or terrorist threats will pro
tect us. Even if one feels comfortable trad
ing "liberty" for "security," one is in effect
giving up something for nothing. In eco
nomics, one would call this behavior irra
tional, but when we give up liberty, I be
lieve the appropriate word is "tragic."
When we have all transfigured into liber
ty-less patriots, who will protect us from
the government?
Silence would indeed be dangerous at a
time like this â€” let us move our lips now
lest they Ik- sealed forever.
