Turn on your bike light!
There is an ongoing problem on cam
pus involving flagrant violation of the
headlight requirement for bicycles. I have
brought this matter to the attention ofThe
Daily and the police and transportation de
partments in the past, and there has been
no improvement in the situation over the
past three years since I began my unofficial
"tracking" of bicycles riding on the campus
roadways after dark. It only becomes obvi
ous to me during the few months of the
year when I leave my campus office at dusk
or after dark, beginning with the time
change at the end of October. During these
months, 1 take a nightly "poll" of how
many bicycles I encounter on the roadways
that are riding with and without head
lights. On any given evening, 1 typically
encounter between 10 and 15 bicycles with
a yield of, at most, four of those using prop
er lighting. Most evenings I find that one,
or none, are lighted.
A series of incidents last night prompt
ed me to write. During my evening com
mute off campus I was, as usual, looking
for bicycles (not just to count them, but to
keep from hitting them). At the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, 1 stopped,
looked both ways and, seeing nothing,
slowly proceeded forward. Out of the dark
from the right, a bicyclist let out a shout
and had to swerve sharply to prevent her
self from hitting my vehicle. She was com
ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor
ner. Had she collided with my vehicle,
she would have injured herself badly. I
stopped, rolled down my window, and
asked her what she was doing riding at
night without any lighting on her bike. I
told her she was not at ail visible and if she
continued riding like that she was going to

get hit. She just stared at me, stunned,
shaken and speechless.
I turned the corner and, slower than
usual, proceeded down Santa Teresa.
Shortly, I encountered a group of about
five bicyclists riding double and triple
abreast along the side of the roadway.
There was no lighting on the rear of any of
the bikes. As I passed them, I checked my
rearview mirror to see if any of them had
headlights. There were none visible. 1
pulled over, put on my emergency flash
ers, stopped, got out and faced the on
coming group. By this time, they had
pulled out in front of the oncoming cars
and were trying to go around me. 1
shouted for them to stop and asked them
why they were riding without headlights
as the law requires. One young woman
reached over her handlebars and pulled
up a very weakly lit headlight that had
been facing downward and said, "My bike
has a light." I told her it was not at all vis
ible and therefore was useless. I told them
1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of
me. She stopped in time and yelled,
"Sorry!" as I drove past.
I have heard and read many accusa
tions against uncourteous car drivers on
campus who speed, run through stop
signs, don't watch out for bicycles, and so
on. Yet in my 1 2 years of driving on cam
pus, I have encountered very few such
drivers, and actually, none since I began
my conscious observations.
I recall a few years ago when I lived in
Cupertino that my son was given a traffic

ticket for riding his hike through a stop
sign without stopping. Surely, traffic tick
ets could be given out to students riding
around campus after dark without lights.
Offering free hike lights is good, but it is
not enough. I believe it is time fora tough
crackdown on such offenders. Their lives
are at stake.

Sacrificing liberty for security's sake
would be tragic
The editorial on the USA Patriot Act
phrases matters very well, and I would like
to commend the editorial board for it
("University should take stand against Pa
triot Act," Nov. 14).
Inherent in the notion of liberty is secu
rity, from others and from the govern
ment. Though I agree that the threat of
terrorism is immediate, 1 fail to see how
curbing the rights of all students from
countries that had nothing to do with the
Sept. 11 attack or terrorist threats will pro
tect us. Even if one feels comfortable trad
ing "liberty" for "security," one is in effect
giving up something for nothing. In eco
nomics, one would call this behavior irra
tional, but when we give up liberty, I be
lieve the appropriate word is "tragic."
When we have all transfigured into liber
ty-less patriots, who will protect us from
the government?
Silence would indeed be dangerous at a
time like this — let us move our lips now
lest they Ik- sealed forever.

Columnist Albrecht should
join the military
l hanks for [Craig Albrecht's
column], "A (too) liberal educa
tion" (Nov. 14). As a proud Ameri
can, 1 am sure you are making
plans to enlist in the U.S. military
soon. We are on the brink of war
with Iraq, and maybe with
weapons-holding North Korea,
too. But, North Korea doesn't
have much oil, so who cares about
them.
Nonetheless, why should the
poor people currently serving in
the military have all the fun? I am
sure you can put aside your com
fortable surroundings at Stanford
and fight for your nation's honor
in Iraq. After a quick and painless
victory in Iraq, we may actually
need your brains to help find
Osama.
Look at the proud military
record of President Bush. He
valiantly fought in the Vietnam
War and kept the state of Texas

safe in his national air guard unit.
Now, surely that will inspire you to
light and serve. Enlist today! Our
nation needs young, smart, light
ing men (and women) like you to
help make the world lit for democ
racy and oil everywhere.
God Bless the U.S.A. Go, light,
win!

Wording of new sexual
harassment policy is
cause for concern
Guest columnist I lias Chrisso
choidis was concerned over the
wording of the new sexual harass
ment policy insofar as it discour
ages relationships between people
of different power hierarchies
("Frustrated grad student resents
new sexual harassment policy,"
Nov. 11). I, too, am very concerned
about the use of such a strong word
like "discourage." Far more fright
ening than an Honor Code viola
tion or other punishment is know
ing that somewhere in the bowels
of the administration, someone
might disapprove of my activities.
Mr. Chrissochoidis presents a

potentially tragic scenario: What if
you meet the man / woman of your
dreams who happens to be hierar
chically different from you?
Perhaps the administration
could provide an ombudsperson
of whom we can ask permission to
woo or marry in special circum
stances. Just as Stanford professors
have won Nobel prizes by pursu
ing previously accepted
paradigms, we should seek ap
proval before following our hearts.

Administration should
legitimately seek student input in
living wage policy
The ASSU's statement on the
proposed Living Wage Policy has
apparently become a sort of
Rorschach test, in which everyone
attempts to divine some hidden
motive behind the ASSU's refusal
to take a specific stance on the pro
posal. According to The Daily's ed
itorial board, it was a veiled slap at
an ineffective policy; meanwhile,
[the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion] proclaims it a condemnation
of the lack of supporting evidence
and Vice Provost Gene Awakuni
merely gripes at the ASSU's refusal
to take a stance.
Perhaps there's a simpler expla
nation: ASSU President Monica
Henestroza and Vice President
Nick Rodriguez are keeping their
campaign promises. Last spring
they staked out a novel position on
student input, namely that it
should come from students. Recog
nizing that a handful of ASSU off i
cials can never represent the diver
sity of opinion on campus and that
they will never have the expertise
to judge every idea that comes
along, they took the position that
the ASSU's role is coordinating be
tween students and administrators,
not claiming to be the only people
with opinions that matter.
University administrators want
an easy out: They'd like to see the
ASSU grant an imprimatur to the
policy or at least give a few particular
reasons to reject it, which can then be

either ducked or partially fulfilled.
Either way, the ASSU statement
would provide a shield against fur
(lier criticism, which could be dis
missed as unrepresentative com
plaints from disgruntled students.
Wisely, the ASSU didn't give
the University such an easy out.
They pointed out that the proce
dure behind the policy was flawed
and that no last-minute approval
from the ASSU would fix that.
They proposed that if the Univer
sity wants student input, it should
get real student input: Students
should be involved, from begin
ning to end, in conceiving and
drafting the policy. The proposal
by Awakuni and Vice President
for Public Affairs Gordon Earle in
yesterday's Daily carefully avoids
this: If the ASSU won't rubber
stamp it for them, they'll try to find
other students to do it.
But maybe, just maybe, the
ASSU meant what it said: They
won't pretend that the opinions of
13,000 students can be summed
up in a few paragraphs, and if Uni
versity administrators want to
claim that students were involved
in the policy, then that involve
ment needs to be more than just a
yes or no vote at the end.

Yell leaders' cheers: 'pseudo
intellectual, dorky ana lame'
I couldn't agree more with Mac
Levi ne's column concerning the
slew of issues concerning Stanford
yell leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12). As
Levine mentioned, it is downright
embarrassing to see a few students
representing me as an arrogant,
yuppie student who has to resort to
insulting the academic reputation
of other institutes of higher learn
ing just to show my "spirit." In my
book, spirit should be positive.
Here's an analogy. Someone in
sults your mom. You say, in re
sponse, "My mom is (insert GRE or
SAT word here) but you wouldn't
understand that since you go to an
inferior school." You'd better hope
that whoever you're talking to is

much smaller than you arc and/
or a pacifist. Otherwise, I suggest
you run.
1 assume the idea behind the
bizarre cheers that get the crowd
asking each other, "YVhat the *!#%
are they saying now?" is that they
flaunt our intellectual superiority.
But all they prove is that we don't
understand the correct type of so
cial behavior, given a situation. Yell
leaders and cheerleaders (can we
reinstate those, by the way?) are
supposed to support a football team
by leading the crowd in cheers.
I'll take it as a given that we'll
never get cheerleaders again, but 1
will give the yell leaders a sugges
tion: Maybe we can do this with baby
steps. Go to a Maryland football
game. There's a single yell leader
there (in addition lo the full squad of
cheerleaders) by the name of Special
K. A mainstay of Maryland, he gets
the crowd cheering 11 le wlu>le game,
for one simple reason. 1 le is into the
football game and supporting the
team lie loves more than he is into
himself. His cheers rally the crowd
rather than dumbfound them. He
uses relevant, simple (beers, like
"DE-FENSE."
Any Stanford student who is
wary of such a lowbrow cheer
should find his or her self-esteem
in ways besides pseudo-intellectu
al, but actually really dorky and
lame (to use highbrow vocabu
lary), cheers. A loud, positive
crowd shows your team you care,
not that you're the type of person
who's like "How'd those athletes
get into my academic paradise?"
This year especially, your football
team needs you to cheer them on.
So start a normal cheer at the next
game you go to. Boycott the hack
neyed "Penetrate, yada yada"
cheer, and just enjoy the game.

Budget cuts may not, in fact,
harm community centers
Contrary to the suggestion of
the title of The Daily's Nov. 13 arti
cle on budget cuts ("Cuts to affect
student centers"), senior adminis
trators have given ASSU leader

ship the assurance that the Univer
sity will do its best to ensure that
budget cuts will not negatively af
fect community centers.
On Oct. 25, President Hennessy
informed ASSU leadership that the
University will make sure student
priorities are not significantly affect
ed by projected budget cuts. Two
weeks ago, Provost Etchemendy
said 11 lat the University is committed
to the long-term success of Stan
ford's community centers and
agreed to work with ASSU officials
and student affairs administrators to
shield community centers as much
as possible from the projected cuts.
In the ASSU's upcoming meet
ings with Vice Provost Awakuni and
Dean VVais, we will gain a better
sense ofthe nature of the proposals.
Given that both Awakuni and Wais
have expressed a commitment to
safeguarding community centers,
we do not expect for our optimism
to have been misplaced.

UAC will be affected by budget cuts
The Nov. 13 article on the effect
of impending budget cuts ("Cuts to
affect student centers") contains
erroneous information regarding
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. The UAC, as well as all other
units of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, will be
subject to the same level of budget
reductions as units within the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and
other areas of the University.
Funding from the Campaign for
Undergraduate Education will cer
tainly contribute to improved long
term base funding for many aspects
of undergraduate education, but the
campaign does not provide relief
from 1 lext year's difficult budget situ
ation. The UAC, like other depart
ments on campus, is working dili
gently to identify potential spending
reductions that will have the least di
rect impact on the quality of under
graduates' academic experiences.

ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor
ner. Had she collided with my vehicle,
she would have injured herself badly. I
stopped, rolled down my window, and
asked her what she was doing riding at
night without any lighting on her bike. I
told her she was not at ail visible and if she
continued riding like that she was going to

get hit. She just stared at me, stunned,
shaken and speechless.
I turned the corner and, slower than
usual, proceeded down Santa Teresa.
Shortly, I encountered a group of about
five bicyclists riding double and triple
abreast along the side of the roadway.
There was no lighting on the rear of any of
the bikes. As I passed them, I checked my
rearview mirror to see if any of them had
headlights. There were none visible. 1
pulled over, put on my emergency flash
ers, stopped, got out and faced the on
coming group. By this time, they had
pulled out in front of the oncoming cars
and were trying to go around me. 1
shouted for them to stop and asked them
why they were riding without headlights
as the law requires. One young woman
reached over her handlebars and pulled
up a very weakly lit headlight that had
been facing downward and said, "My bike
has a light." I told her it was not at all vis
ible and therefore was useless. I told them
1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of
me. She stopped in time and yelled,
"Sorry!" as I drove past.
I have heard and read many accusa
tions against uncourteous car drivers on
campus who speed, run through stop
signs, don't watch out for bicycles, and so
on. Yet in my 1 2 years of driving on cam
pus, I have encountered very few such
drivers, and actually, none since I began
my conscious observations.
I recall a few years ago when I lived in
Cupertino that my son was given a traffic

ticket for riding his hike through a stop
sign without stopping. Surely, traffic tick
ets could be given out to students riding
around campus after dark without lights.
Offering free hike lights is good, but it is
not enough. I believe it is time fora tough
crackdown on such offenders. Their lives
are at stake.

Sacrificing liberty for security's sake
would be tragic
The editorial on the USA Patriot Act
phrases matters very well, and I would like
to commend the editorial board for it
("University should take stand against Pa
triot Act," Nov. 14).
Inherent in the notion of liberty is secu
rity, from others and from the govern
ment. Though I agree that the threat of
terrorism is immediate, 1 fail to see how
curbing the rights of all students from
countries that had nothing to do with the
Sept. 11 attack or terrorist threats will pro
tect us. Even if one feels comfortable trad
ing "liberty" for "security," one is in effect
giving up something for nothing. In eco
nomics, one would call this behavior irra
tional, but when we give up liberty, I be
lieve the appropriate word is "tragic."
When we have all transfigured into liber
ty-less patriots, who will protect us from
the government?
Silence would indeed be dangerous at a
time like this — let us move our lips now
lest they Ik- sealed forever.

Wording of new sexual
harassment policy is
cause for concern
Guest columnist I lias Chrisso
choidis was concerned over the
wording of the new sexual harass
ment policy insofar as it discour
ages relationships between people
of different power hierarchies
("Frustrated grad student resents
new sexual harassment policy,"
Nov. 11). I, too, am very concerned
about the use of such a strong word
like "discourage." Far more fright
ening than an Honor Code viola
tion or other punishment is know
ing that somewhere in the bowels
of the administration, someone
might disapprove of my activities.
Mr. Chrissochoidis presents a

potentially tragic scenario: What if
you meet the man / woman of your
dreams who happens to be hierar
chically different from you?
Perhaps the administration
could provide an ombudsperson
of whom we can ask permission to
woo or marry in special circum
stances. Just as Stanford professors
have won Nobel prizes by pursu
ing previously accepted
paradigms, we should seek ap
proval before following our hearts.

Administration should
legitimately seek student input in
living wage policy
The ASSU's statement on the
proposed Living Wage Policy has
apparently become a sort of
Rorschach test, in which everyone
attempts to divine some hidden
motive behind the ASSU's refusal
to take a specific stance on the pro
posal. According to The Daily's ed
itorial board, it was a veiled slap at
an ineffective policy; meanwhile,
[the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion] proclaims it a condemnation
of the lack of supporting evidence
and Vice Provost Gene Awakuni
merely gripes at the ASSU's refusal
to take a stance.
Perhaps there's a simpler expla
nation: ASSU President Monica
Henestroza and Vice President
Nick Rodriguez are keeping their
campaign promises. Last spring
they staked out a novel position on
student input, namely that it
should come from students. Recog
nizing that a handful of ASSU off i
cials can never represent the diver
sity of opinion on campus and that
they will never have the expertise
to judge every idea that comes
along, they took the position that
the ASSU's role is coordinating be
tween students and administrators,
not claiming to be the only people
with opinions that matter.
University administrators want
an easy out: They'd like to see the
ASSU grant an imprimatur to the
policy or at least give a few particular
reasons to reject it, which can then be

either ducked or partially fulfilled.
Either way, the ASSU statement
would provide a shield against fur
(lier criticism, which could be dis
missed as unrepresentative com
plaints from disgruntled students.
Wisely, the ASSU didn't give
the University such an easy out.
They pointed out that the proce
dure behind the policy was flawed
and that no last-minute approval
from the ASSU would fix that.
They proposed that if the Univer
sity wants student input, it should
get real student input: Students
should be involved, from begin
ning to end, in conceiving and
drafting the policy. The proposal
by Awakuni and Vice President
for Public Affairs Gordon Earle in
yesterday's Daily carefully avoids
this: If the ASSU won't rubber
stamp it for them, they'll try to find
other students to do it.
But maybe, just maybe, the
ASSU meant what it said: They
won't pretend that the opinions of
13,000 students can be summed
up in a few paragraphs, and if Uni
versity administrators want to
claim that students were involved
in the policy, then that involve
ment needs to be more than just a
yes or no vote at the end.

Yell leaders' cheers: 'pseudo
intellectual, dorky ana lame'
I couldn't agree more with Mac
Levi ne's column concerning the
slew of issues concerning Stanford
yell leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12). As
Levine mentioned, it is downright
embarrassing to see a few students
representing me as an arrogant,
yuppie student who has to resort to
insulting the academic reputation
of other institutes of higher learn
ing just to show my "spirit." In my
book, spirit should be positive.
Here's an analogy. Someone in
sults your mom. You say, in re
sponse, "My mom is (insert GRE or
SAT word here) but you wouldn't
understand that since you go to an
inferior school." You'd better hope
that whoever you're talking to is

much smaller than you arc and/
or a pacifist. Otherwise, I suggest
you run.
1 assume the idea behind the
bizarre cheers that get the crowd
asking each other, "YVhat the *!#%
are they saying now?" is that they
flaunt our intellectual superiority.
But all they prove is that we don't
understand the correct type of so
cial behavior, given a situation. Yell
leaders and cheerleaders (can we
reinstate those, by the way?) are
supposed to support a football team
by leading the crowd in cheers.
I'll take it as a given that we'll
never get cheerleaders again, but 1
will give the yell leaders a sugges
tion: Maybe we can do this with baby
steps. Go to a Maryland football
game. There's a single yell leader
there (in addition lo the full squad of
cheerleaders) by the name of Special
K. A mainstay of Maryland, he gets
the crowd cheering 11 le wlu>le game,
for one simple reason. 1 le is into the
football game and supporting the
team lie loves more than he is into
himself. His cheers rally the crowd
rather than dumbfound them. He
uses relevant, simple (beers, like
"DE-FENSE."
Any Stanford student who is
wary of such a lowbrow cheer
should find his or her self-esteem
in ways besides pseudo-intellectu
al, but actually really dorky and
lame (to use highbrow vocabu
lary), cheers. A loud, positive
crowd shows your team you care,
not that you're the type of person
who's like "How'd those athletes
get into my academic paradise?"
This year especially, your football
team needs you to cheer them on.
So start a normal cheer at the next
game you go to. Boycott the hack
neyed "Penetrate, yada yada"
cheer, and just enjoy the game.

Budget cuts may not, in fact,
harm community centers
Contrary to the suggestion of
the title of The Daily's Nov. 13 arti
cle on budget cuts ("Cuts to affect
student centers"), senior adminis
trators have given ASSU leader

ship the assurance that the Univer

budget cuts will not negatively af
fect community centers.
On Oct. 25, President Hennessy
informed ASSU leadership that the
University will make sure student
priorities are not significantly affect
ed by projected budget cuts. Two
weeks ago, Provost Etchemendy
said 11 lat the University is committed
to the long-term success of Stan
ford's community centers and
agreed to work with ASSU officials
and student affairs administrators to
shield community centers as much
as possible from the projected cuts.
In the ASSU's upcoming meet
ings with Vice Provost Awakuni and

Given that both Awakuni and Wais
have expressed a commitment to
safeguarding community centers,

UAC will be affected by budget cuts
The Nov. 13 article on the effect
of impending budget cuts ("Cuts to
affect student centers") contains
erroneous information regarding
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. The UAC, as well as all other
units of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, will be
subject to the same level of budget
reductions as units within the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and
other areas of the University.
Funding from the Campaign for
Undergraduate Education will cer
tainly contribute to improved long
term base funding for many aspects
of undergraduate education, but the
campaign does not provide relief
from 1 lext year's difficult budget situ
ation. The UAC, like other depart

gently to identify potential spending
reductions that will have the least di
rect impact on the quality of under

Turn on your bike light!
There is an ongoing problem on cam
pus involving flagrant violation of the
headlight requirement for bicycles. I have
brought this matter to the attention ofThe
Daily and the police and transportation de
partments in the past, and there has been
no improvement in the situation over the
past three years since I began my unofficial
"tracking" of bicycles riding on the campus
roadways after dark. It only becomes obvi
ous to me during the few months of the
year when I leave my campus office at dusk
or after dark, beginning with the time
change at the end of October. During these
months, 1 take a nightly "poll" of how
many bicycles I encounter on the roadways
that are riding with and without head
lights. On any given evening, 1 typically
encounter between 10 and 15 bicycles with
a yield of, at most, four of those using prop
er lighting. Most evenings I find that one,
or none, are lighted.
A series of incidents last night prompt
ed me to write. During my evening com
mute off campus I was, as usual, looking
for bicycles (not just to count them, but to
keep from hitting them). At the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, 1 stopped,
looked both ways and, seeing nothing,
slowly proceeded forward. Out of the dark
from the right, a bicyclist let out a shout
and had to swerve sharply to prevent her
self from hitting my vehicle. She was com
ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor

1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of
me. She stopped in time and yelled,
"Sorry!" as I drove past.
I have heard and read many accusa
tions against uncourteous car drivers on
campus who speed, run through stop
signs, don't watch out for bicycles, and so
on. Yet in my 1 2 years of driving on cam
pus, I have encountered very few such
drivers, and actually, none since I began
my conscious observations.
I recall a few years ago when I lived in
Cupertino that my son was given a traffic

ticket for riding his hike through a stop
sign without stopping. Surely, traffic tick
ets could be given out to students riding
around campus after dark without lights.
Offering free hike lights is good, but it is
not enough. I believe it is time fora tough
crackdown on such offenders. Their lives
are at stake.

Sacrificing liberty for security's sake
would be tragic
The editorial on the USA Patriot Act
phrases matters very well, and I would like
to commend the editorial board for it
("University should take stand against Pa
triot Act," Nov. 14).
Inherent in the notion of liberty is secu
rity, from others and from the govern
ment. Though I agree that the threat of
terrorism is immediate, 1 fail to see how
curbing the rights of all students from
countries that had nothing to do with the
Sept. 11 attack or terrorist threats will pro
tect us. Even if one feels comfortable trad
ing "liberty" for "security," one is in effect
giving up something for nothing. In eco
nomics, one would call this behavior irra
tional, but when we give up liberty, I be
lieve the appropriate word is "tragic."
When we have all transfigured into liber
ty-less patriots, who will protect us from
the government?
Silence would indeed be dangerous at a
time like this — let us move our lips now
lest they Ik- sealed forever.

Nonetheless, why should the

Look at the proud military

valiantly fought in the Vietnam
War and kept the state of Texas

safe in his national air guard unit.
Now, surely that will inspire you to
light and serve. Enlist today! Our

Wording of new sexual
harassment policy is
cause for concern
Guest columnist I lias Chrisso
choidis was concerned over the
wording of the new sexual harass
ment policy insofar as it discour
ages relationships between people
of different power hierarchies
("Frustrated grad student resents
new sexual harassment policy,"
Nov. 11). I, too, am very concerned
about the use of such a strong word
like "discourage." Far more fright
ening than an Honor Code viola
tion or other punishment is know
ing that somewhere in the bowels
of the administration, someone
might disapprove of my activities.
Mr. Chrissochoidis presents a

potentially tragic scenario: What if
you meet the man / woman of your
dreams who happens to be hierar
chically different from you?
Perhaps the administration
could provide an ombudsperson
of whom we can ask permission to
woo or marry in special circum
stances. Just as Stanford professors
have won Nobel prizes by pursu
ing previously accepted
paradigms, we should seek ap
proval before following our hearts.

Administration should
legitimately seek student input in
living wage policy
The ASSU's statement on the
proposed Living Wage Policy has
apparently become a sort of
Rorschach test, in which everyone
attempts to divine some hidden
motive behind the ASSU's refusal
to take a specific stance on the pro
posal. According to The Daily's ed
itorial board, it was a veiled slap at
an ineffective policy; meanwhile,
[the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion] proclaims it a condemnation
of the lack of supporting evidence
and Vice Provost Gene Awakuni
merely gripes at the ASSU's refusal
to take a stance.
Perhaps there's a simpler expla
nation: ASSU President Monica
Henestroza and Vice President
Nick Rodriguez are keeping their
campaign promises. Last spring
they staked out a novel position on
student input, namely that it
should come from students. Recog
nizing that a handful of ASSU off i
cials can never represent the diver
sity of opinion on campus and that
they will never have the expertise
to judge every idea that comes
along, they took the position that
the ASSU's role is coordinating be
tween students and administrators,
not claiming to be the only people
with opinions that matter.
University administrators want
an easy out: They'd like to see the
ASSU grant an imprimatur to the
policy or at least give a few particular
reasons to reject it, which can then be

either ducked or partially fulfilled.
Either way, the ASSU statement
would provide a shield against fur
(lier criticism, which could be dis
missed as unrepresentative com
plaints from disgruntled students.
Wisely, the ASSU didn't give
the University such an easy out.
They pointed out that the proce
dure behind the policy was flawed
and that no last-minute approval
from the ASSU would fix that.
They proposed that if the Univer
sity wants student input, it should
get real student input: Students
should be involved, from begin
ning to end, in conceiving and
drafting the policy. The proposal
by Awakuni and Vice President
for Public Affairs Gordon Earle in
yesterday's Daily carefully avoids
this: If the ASSU won't rubber
stamp it for them, they'll try to find
other students to do it.
But maybe, just maybe, the
ASSU meant what it said: They
won't pretend that the opinions of
13,000 students can be summed
up in a few paragraphs, and if Uni
versity administrators want to
claim that students were involved
in the policy, then that involve
ment needs to be more than just a
yes or no vote at the end.

Yell leaders' cheers: 'pseudo
intellectual, dorky ana lame'
I couldn't agree more with Mac
Levi ne's column concerning the
slew of issues concerning Stanford
yell leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12). As
Levine mentioned, it is downright
embarrassing to see a few students
representing me as an arrogant,
yuppie student who has to resort to
insulting the academic reputation
of other institutes of higher learn
ing just to show my "spirit." In my
book, spirit should be positive.
Here's an analogy. Someone in
sults your mom. You say, in re
sponse, "My mom is (insert GRE or
SAT word here) but you wouldn't
understand that since you go to an
inferior school." You'd better hope
that whoever you're talking to is

much smaller than you arc and/
or a pacifist. Otherwise, I suggest
you run.
1 assume the idea behind the
bizarre cheers that get the crowd
asking each other, "YVhat the *!#%
are they saying now?" is that they
flaunt our intellectual superiority.
But all they prove is that we don't
understand the correct type of so
cial behavior, given a situation. Yell
leaders and cheerleaders (can we
reinstate those, by the way?) are
supposed to support a football team
by leading the crowd in cheers.
I'll take it as a given that we'll
never get cheerleaders again, but 1
will give the yell leaders a sugges
tion: Maybe we can do this with baby
steps. Go to a Maryland football
game. There's a single yell leader
there (in addition lo the full squad of
cheerleaders) by the name of Special
K. A mainstay of Maryland, he gets
the crowd cheering 11 le wlu>le game,
for one simple reason. 1 le is into the
football game and supporting the
team lie loves more than he is into
himself. His cheers rally the crowd
rather than dumbfound them. He
uses relevant, simple (beers, like
"DE-FENSE."
Any Stanford student who is
wary of such a lowbrow cheer
should find his or her self-esteem
in ways besides pseudo-intellectu
al, but actually really dorky and
lame (to use highbrow vocabu
lary), cheers. A loud, positive
crowd shows your team you care,
not that you're the type of person
who's like "How'd those athletes
get into my academic paradise?"
This year especially, your football
team needs you to cheer them on.
So start a normal cheer at the next
game you go to. Boycott the hack
neyed "Penetrate, yada yada"
cheer, and just enjoy the game.

Budget cuts may not, in fact,
harm community centers
Contrary to the suggestion of
the title of The Daily's Nov. 13 arti
cle on budget cuts ("Cuts to affect
student centers"), senior adminis
trators have given ASSU leader

ship the assurance that the Univer
sity will do its best to ensure that
budget cuts will not negatively af
fect community centers.
On Oct. 25, President Hennessy
informed ASSU leadership that the
University will make sure student
priorities are not significantly affect
ed by projected budget cuts. Two
weeks ago, Provost Etchemendy
said 11 lat the University is committed
to the long-term success of Stan
ford's community centers and
agreed to work with ASSU officials
and student affairs administrators to
shield community centers as much
as possible from the projected cuts.
In the ASSU's upcoming meet
ings with Vice Provost Awakuni and
Dean VVais, we will gain a better
sense ofthe nature of the proposals.
Given that both Awakuni and Wais
have expressed a commitment to
safeguarding community centers,

UAC will be affected by budget cuts
The Nov. 13 article on the effect
of impending budget cuts ("Cuts to
affect student centers") contains
erroneous information regarding
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. The UAC, as well as all other
units of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, will be
subject to the same level of budget
reductions as units within the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and
other areas of the University.
Funding from the Campaign for
Undergraduate Education will cer
tainly contribute to improved long
term base funding for many aspects
of undergraduate education, but the
campaign does not provide relief
from 1 lext year's difficult budget situ
ation. The UAC, like other depart

gently to identify potential spending
reductions that will have the least di
rect impact on the quality of under

Turn on your bike light!
There is an ongoing problem on cam
pus involving flagrant violation of the
headlight requirement for bicycles. I have
brought this matter to the attention ofThe
Daily and the police and transportation de
partments in the past, and there has been
no improvement in the situation over the
past three years since I began my unofficial
"tracking" of bicycles riding on the campus
roadways after dark. It only becomes obvi
ous to me during the few months of the
year when I leave my campus office at dusk
or after dark, beginning with the time
change at the end of October. During these
months, 1 take a nightly "poll" of how
many bicycles I encounter on the roadways
that are riding with and without head
lights. On any given evening, 1 typically
encounter between 10 and 15 bicycles with
a yield of, at most, four of those using prop
er lighting. Most evenings I find that one,
or none, are lighted.
A series of incidents last night prompt
ed me to write. During my evening com
mute off campus I was, as usual, looking
for bicycles (not just to count them, but to
keep from hitting them). At the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, 1 stopped,
looked both ways and, seeing nothing,
slowly proceeded forward. Out of the dark
from the right, a bicyclist let out a shout
and had to swerve sharply to prevent her
self from hitting my vehicle. She was com
ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor
ner. Had she collided with my vehicle,
she would have injured herself badly. I
stopped, rolled down my window, and
asked her what she was doing riding at
night without any lighting on her bike. I
told her she was not at ail visible and if she
continued riding like that she was going to

get hit. She just stared at me, stunned,
shaken and speechless.
I turned the corner and, slower than
usual, proceeded down Santa Teresa.
Shortly, I encountered a group of about
five bicyclists riding double and triple
abreast along the side of the roadway.
There was no lighting on the rear of any of
the bikes. As I passed them, I checked my
rearview mirror to see if any of them had
headlights. There were none visible. 1
pulled over, put on my emergency flash
ers, stopped, got out and faced the on
coming group. By this time, they had
pulled out in front of the oncoming cars
and were trying to go around me. 1
shouted for them to stop and asked them
why they were riding without headlights
as the law requires. One young woman
reached over her handlebars and pulled
up a very weakly lit headlight that had
been facing downward and said, "My bike
has a light." I told her it was not at all vis
ible and therefore was useless. I told them
1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of

"Sorry!" as I drove past.

to commend the editorial board for it
("University should take stand against Pa
triot Act," Nov. 14).
Inherent in the notion of liberty is secu
rity, from others and from the govern
ment. Though I agree that the threat of
terrorism is immediate, 1 fail to see how
curbing the rights of all students from
countries that had nothing to do with the
Sept. 11 attack or terrorist threats will pro
tect us. Even if one feels comfortable trad
ing "liberty" for "security," one is in effect
giving up something for nothing. In eco
nomics, one would call this behavior irra
tional, but when we give up liberty, I be
lieve the appropriate word is "tragic."
When we have all transfigured into liber
ty-less patriots, who will protect us from
the government?
Silence would indeed be dangerous at a
time like this — let us move our lips now
lest they Ik- sealed forever.

can, 1 am sure you are making
plans to enlist in the U.S. military
soon. We are on the brink of war
with Iraq, and maybe with
weapons-holding North Korea,
too. But, North Korea doesn't
have much oil, so who cares about
them.
Nonetheless, why should the
poor people currently serving in
the military have all the fun? I am
sure you can put aside your com
fortable surroundings at Stanford
and fight for your nation's honor
in Iraq. After a quick and painless
victory in Iraq, we may actually
need your brains to help find
Osama.
Look at the proud military
record of President Bush. He
valiantly fought in the Vietnam
War and kept the state of Texas

safe in his national air guard unit.
Now, surely that will inspire you to
light and serve. Enlist today! Our
nation needs young, smart, light
ing men (and women) like you to
help make the world lit for democ
racy and oil everywhere.
God Bless the U.S.A. Go, light,
win!

Wording of new sexual
harassment policy is
cause for concern
Guest columnist I lias Chrisso
choidis was concerned over the
wording of the new sexual harass
ment policy insofar as it discour
ages relationships between people
of different power hierarchies
("Frustrated grad student resents
new sexual harassment policy,"
Nov. 11). I, too, am very concerned
about the use of such a strong word
like "discourage." Far more fright
ening than an Honor Code viola
tion or other punishment is know
ing that somewhere in the bowels
of the administration, someone
might disapprove of my activities.
Mr. Chrissochoidis presents a

potentially tragic scenario: What if
you meet the man / woman of your
dreams who happens to be hierar
chically different from you?
Perhaps the administration
could provide an ombudsperson
of whom we can ask permission to
woo or marry in special circum
stances. Just as Stanford professors
have won Nobel prizes by pursu
ing previously accepted
paradigms, we should seek ap
proval before following our hearts.

Administration should
legitimately seek student input in
living wage policy
The ASSU's statement on the
proposed Living Wage Policy has
apparently become a sort of
Rorschach test, in which everyone
attempts to divine some hidden
motive behind the ASSU's refusal
to take a specific stance on the pro
posal. According to The Daily's ed
itorial board, it was a veiled slap at
an ineffective policy; meanwhile,
[the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion] proclaims it a condemnation
of the lack of supporting evidence
and Vice Provost Gene Awakuni
merely gripes at the ASSU's refusal
to take a stance.
Perhaps there's a simpler expla
nation: ASSU President Monica
Henestroza and Vice President
Nick Rodriguez are keeping their
campaign promises. Last spring
they staked out a novel position on
student input, namely that it
should come from students. Recog
nizing that a handful of ASSU off i
cials can never represent the diver
sity of opinion on campus and that
they will never have the expertise
to judge every idea that comes
along, they took the position that
the ASSU's role is coordinating be
tween students and administrators,
not claiming to be the only people
with opinions that matter.
University administrators want
an easy out: They'd like to see the
ASSU grant an imprimatur to the
policy or at least give a few particular
reasons to reject it, which can then be

either ducked or partially fulfilled.
Either way, the ASSU statement
would provide a shield against fur
(lier criticism, which could be dis
missed as unrepresentative com
plaints from disgruntled students.
Wisely, the ASSU didn't give
the University such an easy out.
They pointed out that the proce
dure behind the policy was flawed
and that no last-minute approval
from the ASSU would fix that.
They proposed that if the Univer
sity wants student input, it should
get real student input: Students
should be involved, from begin
ning to end, in conceiving and
drafting the policy. The proposal
by Awakuni and Vice President
for Public Affairs Gordon Earle in
yesterday's Daily carefully avoids
this: If the ASSU won't rubber
stamp it for them, they'll try to find
other students to do it.
But maybe, just maybe, the
ASSU meant what it said: They
won't pretend that the opinions of
13,000 students can be summed
up in a few paragraphs, and if Uni
versity administrators want to
claim that students were involved
in the policy, then that involve
ment needs to be more than just a
yes or no vote at the end.

Yell leaders' cheers: 'pseudo
intellectual, dorky ana lame'
I couldn't agree more with Mac
Levi ne's column concerning the
slew of issues concerning Stanford
yell leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12). As
Levine mentioned, it is downright
embarrassing to see a few students
representing me as an arrogant,
yuppie student who has to resort to
insulting the academic reputation
of other institutes of higher learn
ing just to show my "spirit." In my
book, spirit should be positive.
Here's an analogy. Someone in
sults your mom. You say, in re
sponse, "My mom is (insert GRE or
SAT word here) but you wouldn't
understand that since you go to an
inferior school." You'd better hope
that whoever you're talking to is

much smaller than you arc and/
or a pacifist. Otherwise, I suggest
you run.
1 assume the idea behind the
bizarre cheers that get the crowd
asking each other, "YVhat the *!#%
are they saying now?" is that they
flaunt our intellectual superiority.
But all they prove is that we don't
understand the correct type of so
cial behavior, given a situation. Yell
leaders and cheerleaders (can we
reinstate those, by the way?) are
supposed to support a football team
by leading the crowd in cheers.
I'll take it as a given that we'll
never get cheerleaders again, but 1
will give the yell leaders a sugges
tion: Maybe we can do this with baby
steps. Go to a Maryland football
game. There's a single yell leader
there (in addition lo the full squad of
cheerleaders) by the name of Special
K. A mainstay of Maryland, he gets
the crowd cheering 11 le wlu>le game,
for one simple reason. 1 le is into the
football game and supporting the
team lie loves more than he is into
himself. His cheers rally the crowd
rather than dumbfound them. He
uses relevant, simple (beers, like
"DE-FENSE."
Any Stanford student who is
wary of such a lowbrow cheer
should find his or her self-esteem
in ways besides pseudo-intellectu
al, but actually really dorky and
lame (to use highbrow vocabu
lary), cheers. A loud, positive
crowd shows your team you care,
not that you're the type of person
who's like "How'd those athletes
get into my academic paradise?"
This year especially, your football
team needs you to cheer them on.
So start a normal cheer at the next
game you go to. Boycott the hack
neyed "Penetrate, yada yada"
cheer, and just enjoy the game.

Budget cuts may not, in fact,
harm community centers
Contrary to the suggestion of
the title of The Daily's Nov. 13 arti
cle on budget cuts ("Cuts to affect
student centers"), senior adminis
trators have given ASSU leader

ship the assurance that the Univer
sity will do its best to ensure that
budget cuts will not negatively af
fect community centers.
On Oct. 25, President Hennessy
informed ASSU leadership that the
University will make sure student
priorities are not significantly affect
ed by projected budget cuts. Two
weeks ago, Provost Etchemendy
said 11 lat the University is committed
to the long-term success of Stan
ford's community centers and
agreed to work with ASSU officials
and student affairs administrators to
shield community centers as much
as possible from the projected cuts.
In the ASSU's upcoming meet
ings with Vice Provost Awakuni and
Dean VVais, we will gain a better
sense ofthe nature of the proposals.
Given that both Awakuni and Wais
have expressed a commitment to
safeguarding community centers,
we do not expect for our optimism

UAC will be affected by budget cuts
The Nov. 13 article on the effect
of impending budget cuts ("Cuts to
affect student centers") contains
erroneous information regarding
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. The UAC, as well as all other
units of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education, will be
subject to the same level of budget
reductions as units within the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and
other areas of the University.
Funding from the Campaign for
Undergraduate Education will cer
tainly contribute to improved long
term base funding for many aspects
of undergraduate education, but the
campaign does not provide relief
from 1 lext year's difficult budget situ
ation. The UAC, like other depart
ments on campus, is working dili
gently to identify potential spending
reductions that will have the least di
rect impact on the quality of under
graduates' academic experiences.

Turn on your bike light!
There is an ongoing problem on cam
pus involving flagrant violation of the
headlight requirement for bicycles. I have
brought this matter to the attention ofThe
Daily and the police and transportation de
partments in the past, and there has been
no improvement in the situation over the
past three years since I began my unofficial
"tracking" of bicycles riding on the campus
roadways after dark. It only becomes obvi
ous to me during the few months of the
year when I leave my campus office at dusk
or after dark, beginning with the time
change at the end of October. During these
months, 1 take a nightly "poll" of how
many bicycles I encounter on the roadways
that are riding with and without head
lights. On any given evening, 1 typically
encounter between 10 and 15 bicycles with
a yield of, at most, four of those using prop
er lighting. Most evenings I find that one,
or none, are lighted.
A series of incidents last night prompt
ed me to write. During my evening com
mute off campus I was, as usual, looking
for bicycles (not just to count them, but to
keep from hitting them). At the corner of
Lomita and Santa Teresa, 1 stopped,
looked both ways and, seeing nothing,
slowly proceeded forward. Out of the dark
from the right, a bicyclist let out a shout
and had to swerve sharply to prevent her
self from hitting my vehicle. She was com
ing so fast that it was evident she had not
stopped at the stop sign that is on the cor
ner. Had she collided with my vehicle,
she would have injured herself badly. I
stopped, rolled down my window, and
asked her what she was doing riding at
night without any lighting on her bike. I
told her she was not at ail visible and if she
continued riding like that she was going to

get hit. She just stared at me, stunned,
shaken and speechless.
I turned the corner and, slower than
usual, proceeded down Santa Teresa.
Shortly, I encountered a group of about
five bicyclists riding double and triple
abreast along the side of the roadway.
There was no lighting on the rear of any of
the bikes. As I passed them, I checked my
rearview mirror to see if any of them had
headlights. There were none visible. 1
pulled over, put on my emergency flash
ers, stopped, got out and faced the on
coming group. By this time, they had
pulled out in front of the oncoming cars
and were trying to go around me. 1
shouted for them to stop and asked them
why they were riding without headlights
as the law requires. One young woman
reached over her handlebars and pulled
up a very weakly lit headlight that had
been facing downward and said, "My bike
has a light." I told her it was not at all vis
ible and therefore was useless. I told them
1 had nearly collided with an unlit bike just
minutes earlier and admonished them to
get lights for their bikes. 'They rode on by,
unimpressed with my display of concern.
I got back in my car, pulled out onto the
roadway, and as I began to pass the group
again, one of the bicyclists turned and
started to cross the road directly in front of
me. She stopped in time and yelled,
"Sorry!" as I drove past.
I have heard and read many accusa
tions against uncourteous car drivers on
campus who speed, run through stop
signs, don't watch out for bicycles, and so
on. Yet in my 1 2 years of driving on cam
pus, I have encountered very few such
drivers, and actually, none since I began
my conscious observations.
I recall a few years ago when I lived in
Cupertino that my son was given a traffic

ticket for riding his hike through a stop
sign without stopping. Surely, traffic tick
ets could be given out to students riding
around campus after dark without lights.
Offering free hike lights is good, but it is
not enough. I believe it is time fora tough
crackdown on such offenders. Their lives
are at stake.
