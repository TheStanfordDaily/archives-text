### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER

NCAA tournament.

Women's Soccer
First Round
Stanford/Cal Poly winner vs. Cal/Den
ver winner, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

The Cardinal takes its top rank
ing into the field of 64 teams
tonight at Maloney Field against
Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. California
and Denver will also play their first
games of the tournament at Mal
oney, as the Golden Bears take on
the Pioneers earlier this afternoon
at 4:30 p.m.
This is Stanford's 12th appear
ance in the tournament, but it's the
first time the program has entered
postseason with the No. 1 seed.
Stanford is followed by second
seeded North Carolina, No. 3 Pep
perdine and No. 4 Connecticut.
Pepperdine, however, will find it

self playing an away game on hos
tile turf, even as the No. 3 seed.
The Pacific-10 Conference and
the Atlantic Coast Conference lead
the way in terms of teams, with
each sending six squads to the
dance, but the bracket displays the
increasing level of competitiveness
of West Coast soccer.
"There are so many top-seeded
West Coast teams," said Stanford
co-coach Stephanie Erickson. "So it
looks like we we're lucky to be
home. I'm also a little surprised
that the Pac-10 teams are facing
each other as quickly as they are."
Pac-10 teams will face each
other as soon as the first round,
which will see Arizona State and
Washington State square off.
There are also potential second
round matchups between UCLA
and Southern California, and Stan
ford and Cal. But the Cardinal isn't
looking any further ahead than Cal
Poly tonight.
"[The first round] is all we can
think about right now," Erickson
said. "It's hard to look ahead and
see what the road is going to be be
cause it's going to be so hard to pre
dict. It's a tough first-round game,
