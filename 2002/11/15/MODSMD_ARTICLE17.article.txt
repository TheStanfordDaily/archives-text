### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
. The Stanford women's soccer
team was able to keep its top rank
ing through the last game of the
regular season last weekend.
Now for the really hard work â€”
to keep it through the 21st annual
NCAA tournament.

Women's Soccer
First Round
Stanford/Cal Poly winner vs. Cal/Den
ver winner, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

The Cardinal takes its top rank
ing into the field of 64 teams
tonight at Maloney Field against
Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. California
and Denver will also play their first
games of the tournament at Mal
oney, as the Golden Bears take on
the Pioneers earlier this afternoon
at 4:30 p.m.
This is Stanford's 12th appear
ance in the tournament, but it's the
first time the program has entered
postseason with the No. 1 seed.
Stanford is followed by second
seeded North Carolina, No. 3 Pep
perdine and No. 4 Connecticut.
Pepperdine, however, will find it

self playing an away game on hos
tile turf, even as the No. 3 seed.
The Pacific-10 Conference and
the Atlantic Coast Conference lead
the way in terms of teams, with
each sending six squads to the
dance, but the bracket displays the
increasing level of competitiveness
of West Coast soccer.
"There are so many top-seeded
West Coast teams," said Stanford
co-coach Stephanie Erickson. "So it
looks like we we're lucky to be
home. I'm also a little surprised
that the Pac-10 teams are facing
each other as quickly as they are."
Pac-10 teams will face each
other as soon as the first round,
which will see Arizona State and
Washington State square off.
There are also potential second
round matchups between UCLA
and Southern California, and Stan
ford and Cal. But the Cardinal isn't
looking any further ahead than Cal
Poly tonight.
"[The first round] is all we can
think about right now," Erickson
said. "It's hard to look ahead and
see what the road is going to be be
cause it's going to be so hard to pre
dict. It's a tough first-round game,

but I expected it to be because any
team that has made it is capable of
putting up a good fight."
The Big West Conference
champion Mustangs bring in a
record of 14-6-0 (8-1 Big West) into
their third trip to the tournament.
Striker Megan Schlegal paces
the Mustang attack with 24 points
(nine goals, six assists) on the year.
Schlegal marked a point in 12 of
the Mustangs' wins this season.
Keeper Greta Shirdon led the
Big West with a 0.76 GAA this sea
son and brings in 13 career
shutouts.
The Cardinal will look to get off
to a quick start against the visiting
team as the Mustangs are just 2-6
when they give up the first score.
Should the Cardinal win
tonight's game, it would find itself
matched up against Cal or Den
ver, both teams that the Cardinal

has recent experience against.
Stanford played the Golden
Bears just two weeks ago, taking a
2-1 come-from-behind win at
Berkeley, and the Cardinal
knocked oil the Pioneers in the
opening round of last year's tour
nament. Stanford eliminated
Denver 2-0 with goals from cur
rent sophomore Natalie Sander
son and senior Becky Myers.
Denver heads into its second
consecutive tournament appear
ance on the heels of a 15-game win
ning streak and a Sun Belt Confer
ence Tournament tide.
The Golden Bears come to
Stanford fort heir 11 th appearance
in the postseason and will look to
break their streak of four consecu
tive first-round exits over the past
four years. Tracy Hamm (18
points) and Lara Schott (16 points)
lead the dangerous Gal attack.
The winners of tonight's
games will face off Sunday after
noon at 1:00 p.m. fora ticket to
the third round, which will be
played next weekend.
