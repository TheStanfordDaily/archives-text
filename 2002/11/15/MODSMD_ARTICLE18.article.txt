game closer to ending. The quick
er Stanford's 2-7 season is logged
in the history books, the happier
everyone associated with Stanford
football will be.
Still, almost forgotten in the dis
appointment of Buddy Teevens'
debut on the Farm is the depar
ture of 16 seniors, many of whom
were an integral part of two of the
best seasons in Stanford history.
As freshmen in 1999, the Class of
2003 helped carry the Cardinal to a
Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship and Stanford's first Rose
Bowl since 1972. Asjuniors in 2001,
they took Stanford on another run
at the conference crown and
amassed a 9-3 record along with a
berth in the Seattle Bowl.
Tomorrow, they will take their
bow for the hometown fans at
Stanford Stadium against Oregon
State (6-4,2-4 Pac-10).
"It's a special game, the last
home game for our seniors, and
they want to go out on a positive
note," Teevens said.
A Blow to the Backfield
Throughout the last four
years two backfield mates — tail
back Kerry Carter and fullback
Casey Moore — have been a
model of consistency and record
breaking success.
Moore has struggled to re
bound from a foot injury that has
limited his production in the past
five games. Still, he has not missed
a game, and his Iron Man streak
stands at 42 straight games start
ed. It's nearly impossible to re
member the last time Moore was
absent from the Stanford back
field. Besides exceptional block

ing, Moore has also shown an un
canny knack for the big play, un
heard of from a fullback.
He is singlehandedly responsi
ble for two of the most memorable
plays in Big Game history. In 1999
he scored on a 94-yard touchdown
run, the second longest in school
history. One year later he caught a
game-winning overtime touch
down to beat the Golden Bears at
Berkeley. Moore is the complete
package as a fullback, and he is
equally effective as an inside run
ner, blocker and receiver, giving
him a likely shot to join Greg
Cornelia and Jon Ritchie as Stan
ford fullbacks in the NFL.
Carter has also been a constant
contributor to Stanford's running
game since 1999, when head
coach Tyrone Willingham
thought enough of his skills to
play the true freshman in one of
Willingham's rare decisions to by
pass a redshirt year. Carter scored
the Cardinal's lone touchdown in
the Rose Bowl t hat season and has
continued to perform despite a
slew of costly injuries.
A bruising rusher at 6-foot-2,
235 pounds, Carter is nearly impos
sible to stop near the goal line, re
sulting in 22 rushing touchdowns
and 24 total scores, fourth and sev
enth, respectively, on Stanford's all
time charts. This season he has also
climbed the all-time rushing lists,
needingjust 75 yards in his last two
games to become only the seventh
Stanford running back to amass
over 2,000 career yards.
Teevens is sure to rely heavily
on both seniors during their last
two games in Cardinal and White,
especially with Stanford's bum
bling passing attack.
The Cardinal will try to take its
second Pac-10 victory of the season
against the Beavers, who need a
win to stay in bowl contention.
Around the Pac
The Pac-10 is laden with bowl
eligible squads. Currently seven
teams have the requisite six wins,
and Washington (5-5) needs a win
in its next two games to become
eligible. Thus, every game is im
portant as the schools will scram
ble to reach one of the Pac-10's six
bowl spots.
No. 3 Washington State has a
bye week and controls its own Rose
Bowl fate, needing a win in one of

its last two games against Washing
ton or UCLA to secure at least a
share of the Pac-10 title. The Bru
ins are also idle, currently sitting in
a tie for third place. Coach Bob
Toledo will likely spend the week
preparing his usual quiver of trick
plays, which he hopes will help slay
hated Southern California on Nov.
23.
Meanwhile the No. 8 Trojans
face the offensive attack of Ari
zona State, which shares third
place with the Bruins. USC likely
needs to win its next two confer
ence games for any chance at
challenging the Cougars for the

Pac-10 title.
The last conference matchup
has Cal lining up against Arizona,
the only team winless in the Pac
-10. Despite already grabbing six
wins, the Golden Bears will not go
to a bowl game because of NCAA
sanctions.
Cal fans are still holding onto
hope, however, and due to its un
expected success the school has ap
pealed its postseason probation.
Stanford and Cal will play the
105 th Big Game next Saturday.
Stanford has won the last seven
contests, including last year's 42-
35 triumph at Stanford Stadium.

and 24 total scores, fourth and sev
enth, respectively, on Stanford's all
time charts. This season he has also
climbed the all-time rushing lists,
needingjust 75 yards in his last two
games to become only the seventh
Stanford running back to amass
over 2,000 career yards.
Teevens is sure to rely heavily
on both seniors during their last
two games in Cardinal and White,
especially with Stanford's bum
bling passing attack.
The Cardinal will try to take its
second Pac-10 victory of the season
against the Beavers, who need a
win to stay in bowl contention.
Around the Pac
The Pac-10 is laden with bowl
eligible squads. Currently seven
teams have the requisite six wins,
and Washington (5-5) needs a win
in its next two games to become
eligible. Thus, every game is im
portant as the schools will scram
ble to reach one of the Pac-10's six
bowl spots.
No. 3 Washington State has a
bye week and controls its own Rose
Bowl fate, needing a win in one of

its last two games against Washing
ton or UCLA to secure at least a
share of the Pac-10 title. The Bru
ins are also idle, currently sitting in
a tie for third place. Coach Bob
Toledo will likely spend the week
preparing his usual quiver of trick
plays, which he hopes will help slay
hated Southern California on Nov.
23.
Meanwhile the No. 8 Trojans
face the offensive attack of Ari
zona State, which shares third
place with the Bruins. USC likely
needs to win its next two confer
ence games for any chance at
challenging the Cougars for the

Pac-10 title.
The last conference matchup
has Cal lining up against Arizona,
the only team winless in the Pac
-10. Despite already grabbing six
wins, the Golden Bears will not go
to a bowl game because of NCAA
sanctions.
Cal fans are still holding onto
hope, however, and due to its un
expected success the school has ap
pealed its postseason probation.
Stanford and Cal will play the
105 th Big Game next Saturday.
Stanford has won the last seven
contests, including last year's 42-
35 triumph at Stanford Stadium.

vs. Oregon St., Saturday, 2:00 p.m

game closer to ending. The quick
er Stanford's 2-7 season is logged
in the history books, the happier
everyone associated with Stanford
football will be.
Still, almost forgotten in the dis
appointment of Buddy Teevens'
debut on the Farm is the depar
ture of 16 seniors, many of whom
were an integral part of two of the
best seasons in Stanford history.
As freshmen in 1999, the Class of
2003 helped carry the Cardinal to a
Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship and Stanford's first Rose
Bowl since 1972. Asjuniors in 2001,
they took Stanford on another run
at the conference crown and
amassed a 9-3 record along with a
berth in the Seattle Bowl.
Tomorrow, they will take their
bow for the hometown fans at
Stanford Stadium against Oregon
State (6-4,2-4 Pac-10).
"It's a special game, the last
home game for our seniors, and
they want to go out on a positive
note," Teevens said.
A Blow to the Backfield
Throughout the last four
years two backfield mates — tail
back Kerry Carter and fullback
Casey Moore — have been a
model of consistency and record
breaking success.
Moore has struggled to re
bound from a foot injury that has
limited his production in the past
five games. Still, he has not missed
a game, and his Iron Man streak
stands at 42 straight games start
ed. It's nearly impossible to re
member the last time Moore was
absent from the Stanford back
field. Besides exceptional block

ing, Moore has also shown an un
canny knack for the big play, un
heard of from a fullback.
He is singlehandedly responsi
ble for two of the most memorable
plays in Big Game history. In 1999
he scored on a 94-yard touchdown
run, the second longest in school
history. One year later he caught a
game-winning overtime touch
down to beat the Golden Bears at
Berkeley. Moore is the complete
package as a fullback, and he is
equally effective as an inside run
ner, blocker and receiver, giving
him a likely shot to join Greg
Cornelia and Jon Ritchie as Stan
ford fullbacks in the NFL.
Carter has also been a constant
contributor to Stanford's running
game since 1999, when head
coach Tyrone Willingham
thought enough of his skills to
play the true freshman in one of
Willingham's rare decisions to by
pass a redshirt year. Carter scored
the Cardinal's lone touchdown in
the Rose Bowl t hat season and has
continued to perform despite a
slew of costly injuries.
A bruising rusher at 6-foot-2,
235 pounds, Carter is nearly impos
sible to stop near the goal line, re
sulting in 22 rushing touchdowns
and 24 total scores, fourth and sev
enth, respectively, on Stanford's all
time charts. This season he has also
climbed the all-time rushing lists,
