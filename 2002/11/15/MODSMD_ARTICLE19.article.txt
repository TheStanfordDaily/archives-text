Each fall the Stanford women's
cross country team hosts the Stan
ford Invitational, one of the biggest
cross country meets in the nation.
The last time the Cardinal hosted a
postseason event., however, was in
1997, when Stanford was the site of
the Pacific-10 Championships.
That year, the women's team swept

the conference and regional titles
on its way to a second-place finish at
t he NCAA Championships.
Big-league cross country racing
returns to the Farm tomorrow as
the Cardinal hosts the NCAA West
ern Regionals, where teams will at
tempt to qualify for the national
championships, held nine days
later in Terre Haute, Ind.
The No. 2 Stanford team will toe
the line alongside 32 other teams at
the Stanford Golf Course, but only
the top two teams will automatical
ly advance to nationals.
"We're racing regionals as a
qualifying meet," sophomore Jeane
Goff said, "not meaning that we'll
be taking it easy or not seriously,
but racing how we should in order
to qualify. Our goals aren't neces
sarily for personal records and the
lowest team scores ever. Hut we
want to get the job done."
Stanford dominated the Pacific
-10 Conference meet two weekends
ago, easily beating Arizona State
and Washington. The regional
meet, however, is a far different

beast than the conference champi
onships. With only 10 teams, the
Pac-10 field was less than a third the
size of the regionals' lineup.
With the smaller field, the Car
dinal runners were able to take the
pace of the first mile a little easier,
saving their bullets for the final
showdown and ensuring they did
not go out too hard.
"It worked out perfectly [at Pac
10s]," sophomore Sara Bei said.
"We were able to go out conserva
tively and control the race by being
in the lead from the beginning."
But in a large field, every racer
wants to be at the front so she does
not have to spend the first half of
the race passing slower opponents.
Consequently, the Stanford team
will have to start the race at a very
hard pace.
Going out fast, although neces
sary to snag a top team placing, has
obvious repercussions. It's a thin
line between victory and utter col
lapse halfway through the course,
and it requires years of experience
to pick the perfect pace.
The finish of the Stanford course
is located on a long, slightly uphill
slog— 10 seconds too fast in the
first kilometer can easily return
with a vengeance in the painful
final kilometer, resulting in a long
slide down in the results column.
Fortunately, although the Car
dinal team has many young run
ners, the team has plenty of'experi
ence. Senior Lauren Flesh man, a
two-time NCAA 5,000-meter
champion on the track, is looking to
better her third-place finish at cross
country nationals last year, and will

Like every other race this year it
has entered, the No. 1 Cardinal
men's cross country team is expect

ford Golf Course, I he regional fea
tures 29 men's teams from across
the western United Suites.
The regional meet determines
the qualifiers for the NCAA Cham
pionships in Terre Haute, Ind., on
Nov. 25. The top two teams qualify
automatically and then 13 at-large
bids are given across all the regions
based on a point system determined
by wins and losses to other teams.
But the Cardinal will not be
running as hard as possible this
weekend, looking instead to
save its energy and focus for the
national championships.
"We treat this race the same as a
preliminary in track," said junior
Grant Robison, who claimed the in
dividual Pacific-10 Conference
championship in Pasadena on Nov.
2. "We run hard enough to get the
job done, realizing that there is
something else after it."
Despite the conservative atti
tude, there is little doubt that the
Cardinal will gain its ninth trip to
the national race in as many years
and claim its seventh consecutive
West Regional title.
The closest ranked team to Stan

ford that will be at the regional is
No. 5 Oregon, which the Cardinal
defeated 19-51 at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Oregon's Jason Hartmann, who
was fourth at the Pac-10s, is consid
ered one of the favorites for the in
dividual title, along with the de
fending regional champion, Stan
ford junior Don Sage.
Stanford has had five different
runners lead the team in seven
races this season, displaying the
Cardinal's depth and bringing sev
eral other Stanford athletes into
contention for the individual title.
"I think we will run our normal
race," said Vin Lananna, director
of the Cardinal cross country and
track and field teams. "We will be
focused more on running as a
team. If we have to close big, we
will be in position to, but I don't
anticipate that."
That team focus has been seen in
almost every race the Cardinal has
run this year. The guys have stayed
packed together for as long as pos
sible without sacrificing places,
leading to two dominating perfor
mances in the last two outings—
most notably Stanford's placing
seven runners in the top nine at the
Pac-10 (Championships.
"Defending my Pac-10 title
was more a relief because of the
pressure I felt," Robison said.
"But the win from the team
standpoint was great. I've never
been in a race where we've been
that dominating."
But like any team, keeping moti
vation and excitement is difficult
through such a long season of train
