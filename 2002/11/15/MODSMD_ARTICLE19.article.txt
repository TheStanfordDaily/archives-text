Each fall the Stanford women's
cross country team hosts the Stan
ford Invitational, one of the biggest
cross country meets in the nation.
The last time the Cardinal hosted a
postseason event., however, was in
1997, when Stanford was the site of
the Pacific-10 Championships.
That year, the women's team swept

on its way to a second-place finish at
t he NCAA Championships.
Big-league cross country racing
returns to the Farm tomorrow as
the Cardinal hosts the NCAA West
ern Regionals, where teams will at
tempt to qualify for the national
championships, held nine days
later in Terre Haute, Ind.
The No. 2 Stanford team will toe
the line alongside 32 other teams at
the Stanford Golf Course, but only
the top two teams will automatical
ly advance to nationals.
"We're racing regionals as a
qualifying meet," sophomore Jeane
Goff said, "not meaning that we'll
be taking it easy or not seriously,
but racing how we should in order
to qualify. Our goals aren't neces
sarily for personal records and the
lowest team scores ever. Hut we
want to get the job done."
Stanford dominated the Pacific
-10 Conference meet two weekends
ago, easily beating Arizona State
and Washington. The regional
meet, however, is a far different

beast than the conference champi
onships. With only 10 teams, the
Pac-10 field was less than a third the
size of the regionals' lineup.
With the smaller field, the Car
dinal runners were able to take the
pace of the first mile a little easier,
saving their bullets for the final
showdown and ensuring they did
not go out too hard.
"It worked out perfectly [at Pac
10s]," sophomore Sara Bei said.
"We were able to go out conserva
tively and control the race by being
in the lead from the beginning."
But in a large field, every racer
wants to be at the front so she does
not have to spend the first half of
the race passing slower opponents.
Consequently, the Stanford team
will have to start the race at a very
hard pace.
Going out fast, although neces
sary to snag a top team placing, has
obvious repercussions. It's a thin
line between victory and utter col
lapse halfway through the course,
and it requires years of experience
to pick the perfect pace.
The finish of the Stanford course
is located on a long, slightly uphill
slog— 10 seconds too fast in the
first kilometer can easily return
with a vengeance in the painful
final kilometer, resulting in a long
slide down in the results column.
Fortunately, although the Car
dinal team has many young run
ners, the team has plenty of'experi
ence. Senior Lauren Flesh man, a
two-time NCAA 5,000-meter
champion on the track, is looking to
better her third-place finish at cross
country nationals last year, and will

tures 29 men's teams from across
the western United Suites.
The regional meet determines
the qualifiers for the NCAA Cham
pionships in Terre Haute, Ind., on
Nov. 25. The top two teams qualify
automatically and then 13 at-large
bids are given across all the regions
based on a point system determined
by wins and losses to other teams.
But the Cardinal will not be
running as hard as possible this
weekend, looking instead to
save its energy and focus for the
national championships.
"We treat this race the same as a
preliminary in track," said junior
Grant Robison, who claimed the in
dividual Pacific-10 Conference
championship in Pasadena on Nov.
2. "We run hard enough to get the
job done, realizing that there is
something else after it."
Despite the conservative atti
tude, there is little doubt that the
Cardinal will gain its ninth trip to
the national race in as many years
and claim its seventh consecutive
West Regional title.
The closest ranked team to Stan

ford that will be at the regional is
No. 5 Oregon, which the Cardinal
defeated 19-51 at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Oregon's Jason Hartmann, who
was fourth at the Pac-10s, is consid
ered one of the favorites for the in
dividual title, along with the de
fending regional champion, Stan
ford junior Don Sage.
Stanford has had five different
runners lead the team in seven
races this season, displaying the
Cardinal's depth and bringing sev
eral other Stanford athletes into
contention for the individual title.
"I think we will run our normal
race," said Vin Lananna, director
of the Cardinal cross country and
track and field teams. "We will be
focused more on running as a
team. If we have to close big, we
will be in position to, but I don't
anticipate that."
That team focus has been seen in
almost every race the Cardinal has
run this year. The guys have stayed
packed together for as long as pos
sible without sacrificing places,
leading to two dominating perfor
mances in the last two outings—
most notably Stanford's placing
seven runners in the top nine at the
Pac-10 (Championships.
"Defending my Pac-10 title
was more a relief because of the
pressure I felt," Robison said.
"But the win from the team
standpoint was great. I've never
been in a race where we've been
that dominating."
But like any team, keeping moti
vation and excitement is difficult
through such a long season of train

Both the Stanford men's and women's cross country teams are hosting the
NCAA Western Regionals tomorrow at the Stanford Golf Course. Both
teams are expected to continue their dominance and advance to Nationals.
be instrumental in setting the cor
rect pace for the team.
Fleshman will be joined by se
niors Malindi Elmore and Katie
Hotchkiss, two experienced ath
letes who have considerably
stepped up their running this year.
However, a good part of the squad
— including Goff, Bei, Alicia Craig
and Anita Siraki — are still in their
sophomore year.
Bei and Craig in particular have
had spectacular seasons so far this
year. Hie pair shared a victory in the
season-opening Cal State-Fullerton
Invitational and since then have
never been far from the front.
Bei won the 6,000-meter event
at the Stanford Invitational in late
September (on the same course as

tomorrow's regionals) and also
took the individual title at Pac-lOs.
Craig was Stanford's top runner at
the Pre-NCAA Meet. Although
both are relatively new to the colle
giate scene, both are well-acquaint
ed with dominating national-level
races after running to impressive
careers in high school.
Ilie Cardinal's strongest com
petition this weekend will likely
consist of familiar Pac-10 rivals such
as Arizona State, Washington and
UCLA. Although these teams rep
resent formidable challenges, Stan
ford is confident heading into the
penultimate race of the season.
"We've all lowered our mileage
slightly to taper into the champi
onships," Goff said. "Instead of
doing long interval workouts,
we're doing shorter, faster things
and workouts that get us moving,
but don't kill us. Everyone's been
looking fast."
ing and competition. The runners
spend hours each day training to
gether and working for their goals.
"As we progress, people get
tired and irked at little things,"
Robison said. "But now every
one is re-finding their excite
ment. They know we have a
good shot fat winning the na
tional championship]."
Lananna added, "I think the
guys just need to stay directed. I

really believe they are well
poised for the huge challenge in
front of them."
One of the few questions re
maining for the weekend is the
lineup the Cardinal will race. Often
calling itself "the machine," the
team knows that its depth allows
the coaches to switch the lineup
week to week in order to rest the
runners without compromising the
team's goals.
Even Robison, who has led
the Cardinal in his last two
races, is unsure whether he will
run tomorrow.
"If I don't run, I will just

keep fine-tuning for nationals,"
Robison said. "I want to be there
for the team and be in our top
five at nationals."
The men's team toes the
starting line for the 10,000-
meter race at 1 1:00 a.m. by the
second tee of the golf course.
"We have an established game
plan every time out," Lananna
said. "You can usually predict
how we will run and that we will
go for the win. Running as a
team works for us. We're the
kind of team that's comfortable
with that. And I think that's what
makes us successful."
