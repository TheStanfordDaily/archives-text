# 'Vagina' author plugs V-day in Kresge speech
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many on the Stanford campus heard a
lot about the vagina last night as Eve En
sler, author of and actor in"The Vagina
Monologues," spoke at Kresge Auditori
um. Ensler's major focus was on her V-day
campaign to end world violence against
women.
According to Ensler, whose speech was
primarily sponsored by the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau and the Stanford Women's
Community Center, V-day is a vision of a
new world.
"I think it's this emerging idea of this
other paradigm: that there are women all
around the world who are learning to take
their pain and take their suffering and
take the violence that's been done to them

and transform it in order to stop it from
happening to other women," she said.
"And I think that motion, or that gesture,
or that trajectory, is the new trajectory."
V-day emerged as a result of perfor
mances of "The Vagina Monologues," En
sler's collection of speeches by women dis
cussing their most intimate body parts, as
sembled from over 200 personal inter
views. After performances of the play, En
sler would find women lined up to tell her
their stories of violence, rape, incest and
abuse. She said that she felt immoral not
doing something and founded V-day as a
response in 1997 with a celebrity benefit
performance of "Monologues."
V-day includes broad range of grass
roots fundraising activities, but the biggest

event consists of annual benefit
performances of "Monologues"
around the world on Valentine's
Day, including a performance at
Stanford. According to Ensler, the
"V" stands lor vagina, victory, anti
violence and valentine.
"In five years, V-day's raised
close to $14 million," Ensler said.
"Last year, [the money] went to
1,022 beneficiaries — local groups
all over the world."
Ensler herself has a personal in
terest in V-day, as she was beaten
and raped by her father. For her,
the campaign against violence is
part of the healing process. She has
traveled around the world, to
places including Afghanistan,
Zaire and Bosnia, to discuss
women's issues.
"If you give to the world what
you need and want the most, it will
lieal that part of you," she said.
Ensler said that she holds high
hopes for the campaign. When
asked it V-day could end violence,
she responded, "Absolutely. 2005,
that's been my goal [for ending vi
olence], and I'm staying there until
someone tells me otherwise."
She said that Stanford is a key
supporter in her campaign.
"It's the fifth year of V-day at
Stanford," Ensler said. "Stanford
has been a wildly 'vagina-friendly'

campus. I think they've done in
credibly great work here raising
consciousness about empowering
women, loving women's bodies
[and] ending violence."
The response to V-day at Stan
ford, as well as to Ensler's visit, was
strong.
"I'm excited because I've been
teaching 'The Vagina Mono
logues' in my freshman seminar,

[ The Body]," said Estelle Freed
inan, professor of feminist studies.
"I admire the work she's doing,
using creativity and theater in the
world to make social change."
"She moves the dialogue for
ward historically, breaking silence
about female passion and vulnera
bility. She's brought a fringe move
ment to the mainstream."
Lauren Elliston, a cast member

of this year's V-day performance,
said that she was moved by Ensler's
speech.
"It makes me want to be an ac
tivist," she said. "It's inspiring be
cause you know what she's going
to say, but when yon hear her say
it, and you can hear how much she
cares about it, it really makes you
care and want to make other peo
ple care."

V-day emerged as a result of perfor
mances of "The Vagina Monologues," En
sler's collection of speeches by women dis
cussing their most intimate body parts, as
sembled from over 200 personal inter
views. After performances of the play, En
sler would find women lined up to tell her
their stories of violence, rape, incest and
abuse. She said that she felt immoral not
doing something and founded V-day as a
response in 1997 with a celebrity benefit
performance of "Monologues."
V-day includes broad range of grass

event consists of annual benefit
performances of "Monologues"
around the world on Valentine's
Day, including a performance at
Stanford. According to Ensler, the
"V" stands lor vagina, victory, anti
violence and valentine.
"In five years, V-day's raised
close to $14 million," Ensler said.
"Last year, [the money] went to
1,022 beneficiaries — local groups
all over the world."
Ensler herself has a personal in
terest in V-day, as she was beaten
and raped by her father. For her,
the campaign against violence is
part of the healing process. She has
traveled around the world, to
places including Afghanistan,
Zaire and Bosnia, to discuss
women's issues.
"If you give to the world what
you need and want the most, it will
lieal that part of you," she said.
Ensler said that she holds high
hopes for the campaign. When
asked it V-day could end violence,
she responded, "Absolutely. 2005,
that's been my goal [for ending vi
olence], and I'm staying there until
someone tells me otherwise."
She said that Stanford is a key
supporter in her campaign.
"It's the fifth year of V-day at
Stanford," Ensler said. "Stanford
has been a wildly 'vagina-friendly'

campus. I think they've done in
credibly great work here raising
consciousness about empowering
women, loving women's bodies
[and] ending violence."
The response to V-day at Stan
ford, as well as to Ensler's visit, was
strong.
"I'm excited because I've been
teaching 'The Vagina Mono
logues' in my freshman seminar,

[ The Body]," said Estelle Freed
inan, professor of feminist studies.
"I admire the work she's doing,
using creativity and theater in the
world to make social change."
"She moves the dialogue for
ward historically, breaking silence
about female passion and vulnera
bility. She's brought a fringe move
ment to the mainstream."
Lauren Elliston, a cast member

of this year's V-day performance,
said that she was moved by Ensler's
speech.
"It makes me want to be an ac
tivist," she said. "It's inspiring be
cause you know what she's going
to say, but when yon hear her say
it, and you can hear how much she
cares about it, it really makes you
care and want to make other peo
ple care."
