Many on the Stanford campus heard a
lot about the vagina last night as Eve En
sler, author of and actor in"The Vagina
Monologues," spoke at Kresge Auditori

campaign to end world violence against
women.

Community Center, V-day is a vision of a
new world.
"I think it's this emerging idea of this

take the violence that's been done to them

and transform it in order to stop it from
happening to other women," she said.
"And I think that motion, or that gesture,
or that trajectory, is the new trajectory."
V-day emerged as a result of perfor
mances of "The Vagina Monologues," En
sler's collection of speeches by women dis
cussing their most intimate body parts, as
sembled from over 200 personal inter
views. After performances of the play, En
sler would find women lined up to tell her
their stories of violence, rape, incest and
abuse. She said that she felt immoral not
doing something and founded V-day as a
response in 1997 with a celebrity benefit
performance of "Monologues."
V-day includes broad range of grass
roots fundraising activities, but the biggest
