### JIMMY WU EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the first time during their
Stanford career, they weren't all
together.
After the 2000 men's soccer sea
son, seniors Johanes Maliza and
Andrew I erris decided to explore
their interests elsewhere, as the
two traveled to Paris and Florence,
respectively, fora quarter.
But an ocean could not keep
teammates and classmates Taylor
Graham, Roger Levesque, Todd
Dunivant and Abe Geiger from tak-

ing a spring break trip to Europe to
see their two friends abroad.
On and off the field, they have
been inseparable.
"I think the fact that we all took
the time to visit Johanes and An
drew in Europe, and just the
group of us terrorizing Europe last
spring epitomizes our closeness as
a class," Graham said.
Levesque agreed: "It can be
summed up best as everybody on
campus knowing us as the 'soccer
guys.' They can't really differenti
ate one of us from another. It just
shows the closeness of our group."
The unique bond that brought
the six seniors together has mani
fested itself this season as they have
embraced their leadership roles,
putting the No. 22 Cardinal (12-4-
2, 3-3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) in
good position fora run at the
NCAA championship.
With its last two conference
games coming up tonight at Oregon
State (12-6-0, 3-5-0) and Sunday at
Washington (5-9-3, 2-6-0), Stanford
will be counting on the six seniors to
help the team finish on a strong note,
heading into the postseason.
Head coach Bret Simon appre
ciates how the seniors have led the
team all year.
"It's a tremendous group,"

Simon said. "It's one of the best
groups of seniors I've ever worked
with in the 23 years I've coached,
both on and oil* the field. I suspect
that when it comes down to do-or
die time, you'll see how good they
really are."
Geiger, a redshirt junior who
will most likely return fora fifth
year, appreciates how much he has
learned from the soon-to-be-grad
uated class.
"I really look up to all these
guys," Geiger said. "I definitely
learned a lot from them. This
whole unit exemplifies what Stan
ford soccer should be all about in
terms of commitment and putting
in 110 percent effort on the field."
Their contributions to the soc
cer program have been countless.
During its tenure, the group has
helped the Cardinal to a 61-13-7
record, three NCAA appearances
— including one semifinal berth
— and one Pac-10 championship.
Despite all of their achieve
ments on the field, their friend
ships with each other have been
the most treasured part of their
Stanford experience.
" The soccer and the academics
have been amazing here, but more
than anything, we've become really
close," Geiger said. "They are my
best friends on the soccer team, and
I wouldn't trade that for anything."
Graham, who is a fifth-year se
nior, has come to identify more
with this group of guys than last
year's seniors.
"I was certainly close with my
class, but in terms of living in
dorms, I seem to have the most in
common with these guys," Gra
ham said. "All my friends from my
freshman dorm have said these
guys have corrupted me, and that
I've changed. They said that I've
become more scandalous."
Dunivant also cherishes the ca
maraderie.
"We've come a long way, al
though I don't know if we've ma
tured," Dunivant joked. "I think
all of us have grown together and

learned a lot from each other.
We've picked up new habits from
each other and a lot of inside
jokes. It's been a great four years
for all of us."
The development of this close
ness has allowed them to achieve
success on the field as well.
"One good thing about our
friendship is that we're not afraid
to say stuff to each other on the
field," Maliza said. "If we see some
body doing something off the field
that might affect them on the field,
we will be honest with them."

This ability to gel on the field
will be especially important this
weekend and in upcoming weeks.
"We're really excited about this
weekend," Levesque said. "Every
body is worried about our goal
scoring, but the rest of the squad
knows that the goals will come."
Having experienced the agony of
finis! ling one game short oft 1 le cham
pionship, there is no doubt what the
seniors want before leaving Stanford.
Coach Simon said it best: "I
don't think they have made their
final statement yet."
