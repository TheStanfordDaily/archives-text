# Card too much for Team Concept
## 
### NATHAN KURZ 
It was raining and pouring in
side Maples Pavilion last night.
Three-pointers, that is.
The Stanford women's basket
ball team nailed 16 shots from be
yond the arc, including five 3-point
ers by sophomore guard Sebnem
Kimyacioglu, en route to a 103-61
thrashing of Team Concept.

(exh.)

Things were going so well for
the Cardinal that even a fan was
able to get in on the action. A pre
selected audience member sunk a
half-court shot during a halftime
promotion to win a Kobe Bryant
jersey. That pretty much summed
up how easy shooting was coming
to the Cardinal, who shot an even
50 percent from the field.
The key to the perimeter open
ing up for the shooters was Stan
ford's effective inside-outside game.
" They set us up with outside
shots," sophomore guard Kelley
Suminski said of her teammates on
the interior. "When we pass it in,
they kick it right back out to us."
Stanford was also able to accom
plish something coach Tara Van-

Derveer stressed in preseason: cre
ate offense from defense.
Hie C Cardinal forced 28 turnovers,
leading to 23 fast break points.
"We always want to push the
ball, even on a made basket," Sum
inski said.
Offensively, Stanford had seven
players in double figures, led by
Kimyacioglu's 19 and Suminski's
16 — a great precursor to the sea
son for the Cardinal. Since junior
star forward Nicole Powell is suf
fering from a bulging disk in her
back, balanced scoring will have to
carry the Cardinal at least until
Powell returns.
Ah yes, that elusive question.
When will Powell be back on
the court?
VanDerveer said the Naismith
Award candidate is "resting" —
and that Powell's timetable is still
uncertain.
The most important develop
ment of the exhibition season has
been the steady progression of the
Cardinal freshmen, particularly
guard Krista Rappahahn, who
had 12 points in 18 minutes.
"Krista had some big plays for
us," VanDerveer said. "She had no
turnovers and [a couple] steals."
Sophomore forward T'Nae
Thiel had her second consecutive
double-double with 10 points and

10 rebounds — including seven on
the offensive glass — to pace the
Cardinal's 40-31 rebounding edge.
Stanford led 48-24 at halftime.
Unlike its first exhibition mach
up, the Cardinal didn't stagger out
of the gate. It opened the game
with a 17-4 run, led by two three
pointers by sophomore point
guard Susan King and some stellar
transition offense.
With the exhibition campaign
coming to a close, Stanford seems
in the right mindset to kick off the
season a week from today.
"I think overall our coaches are
pleased with how far we've come in
the three weeks," Perryman said.
"One more week should do it, and
we're gonna be ready for Rutgers."
In recruiting news, the Cardi
nal signed Kristen Newlin, a 6-
foot-5 center from Riverton,
Wyoming, to a letter-of-intent
earlier this week. Newlin was
named the Gatorade Wyoming
Player of the Year last year after
averaging 25.8 points, 13.3 re
bounds, 4.2 blocks and 2.04 steals
per game.
VanDerveer said the Cardinal
won't be signing any more players
since they return everyone next
year, unless "someone with a 4.0
[grade point average] and 1600
SATs" pops up.
