# Potter's sophomore slump
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Ask any booklover or movie buff and
he'll tell you that author J. K. Rowling's
idea of magic is a civilization apart from
anything Chris Columbus ever con
jured up.
It was no surprise, therefore, that last
year's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone"— adapted from the novel by

Rowling and
directed by
Columbus —
was a mixed
cauldron of a
movie: Indi
vidual scenes
felt as if they
were assem
bled by a
clumsy ap-

prentice,
while the spell of the plot still kept loyal
Potter fans enchanted. It's also no sur
prise that the sequel, "Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets" (which opens
today), shares many of the major weak
nesses of the first movie.
At a hefty 161 minutes, "Chamber" is
tcx) long and too slow lor its own benefit.
The film seems to start, stall, and then
restart again in the final hour with a sor
cerer's showdown that is nothing less than
spectacular. But we'll get to that later.
The movie opens, as did the second
book, at number four Privet Drive, where
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has spent
the summer under the supervision of his
cantankerous aunt and uncle. Soon, he's
visited by a house elf named Dobby (a com

puter-generated image that resembles a
dwarfish Jar Jar Binks) with the cryptic
warning not to go back to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft — and later, in only a matter
of movie minutes, his old chum Ron
Weasley (Rupert Grint) is hovering at his
bedroom windowsill in a flying car.
A flying car? But of course!
Most of the details are lifted straight
from Rowling's pages. Yet choices must
be made in a book-to-movie adaptation,
and the screenplay by Steve Kloves
(who also penned the first movie) ne
glects to prioritize key points from less
important subplots.
The result is a product that lumbers
when it should leap. In terms of the
movie, less of Rowling's book would have
been more: Plot and character develop
ment could have been handled with the
wizard's touch, rather than glazed over as
they are in "Chamber."
Take, for instance, the soaring car se
quence. In the book, it's brought to life
through pure magic by Rowling's prose.
In the movie, it's eclipsed with exaggera
tion; the moment never equates to more
than a rollick on a Disneyland coaster, and
you half expect the clouds to chime in with
the song, "It's a Small World After All."
At Hogwarts, the film's pacing doesn't
much improve at first. Harry is reunited
with his old friend Hermione (Emma
Watson) and faces another series of
pseudo-threats from Lucius Malfoy
(Jason Isaacs). Real threat, meanwhile,
comes in the form of a mysterious beast
that roams the school's corridors and
transforms students with non-wizard
blood into paralyzed zombies.

Most of the veteran actors have re
turned for the second installment: Mag
gie Smith, the late Richard Harris as Albus
Dumbledore, John Cleese, Robbie
Coltrane and Alan Rickman as Snape
(who is less villainous this time around
and sorely in need of a haricut). The no
table addition is Kenneth Branagh as
Gilderoy Lockhart, an instructor of dark
arts who isn't the brightest bulb on the
sorcerer's Christmas tree.
It's at the halfway mark, and only then,
that "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets" finally lifts off. The turning point
is the Quidditch match, followed by a sen
sational journey into the Forbidden For
est that unravels with the pure adrenaline

rush of an Indiana Jones movie.
Both scenes demonstrate a crucial
lesson in Potter filmmaking: For the se
ries to work, liberties need to be taken
with the books; Rowling's plots must be
expanded upon, characters must be ex
cised and action sequences developed
around the edges.
"Harry Potter and the Camber of Se
crets" is an adequate film, and in some
ways, an improvement over its predeces
sor. But the climax — which succeeds in
capturing the spirit of Rowling's books —
gives us a glimpse into how spellbinding
the entire movie could have been if Chris
Columbus had more than just a tew tricks
up his sleeve.
