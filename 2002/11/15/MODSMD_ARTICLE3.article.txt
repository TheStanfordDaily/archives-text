## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU's first Forum on Contem
porary Issues last night in the Meyer
Forum room probed living-wage issues
as they relate to Stanford workers. In the
past months, this has been a heated topic,
resurfacing in the form of student
protests and Wednesday's one-day strike
by hospital workers.
The seven-member panel consisted
of individuals from the University ad
ministration, student body and work
ers' coalition.
Event moderator and Vice Provost of
Campus Relations LaDoris Cordell
opened the discussion with specific ques

lions for each speaker.
Senior Meghana Redely of the Coali
tion for Labor Justice was asked to com
ment on the role students and workers
should play in the labor and social jus
tice movement.
"Because we are consumers at the
University, labor issues are a concern to
us," she said. "Workers need to represent
themselves — they need to have their
own voice."
Speaking after Reddy, senior Joe
Londsdale, editor in chief ofthe Stanford
Review alluded to the fact that subsidiz
ing the workers via a living wage does not
resolve the issue.

At last night's Forum on Contemporary Issues, "Learn About a Living Wage," Coalition
for Labor Justice Coordinator Meghana Reddy talks as John Enyeart, a lecturer in
American Studies, looks on.
"Giving people money is not
good for them," lie said. "We should
be starting programs to educate
these people."
Gordon Earle, vice president of
public affairs, subsequently spoke
about the University's position re
garding the living-wage issue.
"The living wage guideline pro
vides a safety net for workers," Earle
said. The University hopes to ap
prove a liv ing wage policy covering
workers who are hired by subcon
tractors, he said.
He said the University would
seek input from students and facul
ty before the policy is finalized in an
open meeting whose date not been
determined.
"We shouldn't underestimate
the students' voice," said Danielle
Mahones of SEIU Local 715. "It is
difficult [for students] to see the
workers who seive you."
Ana Esquivel, an employee at the

Stanford I lospital, spoke next.
"Management doesn't listen to
our concerns... our contract has
expired [and] we are waiting fora
new [one]," she said. "Why doesn't
President Hennessy take responsi
bility in the patient-care issue?"
She added, "Patients are hurt be
cause there aren't enough staff."
Earle defended the University's
position.
"It is not proper for President
Hennessy to be involved because
the hospitals are separate legal and
functional entities from the Univer
sity," he said.
John Cammidge, executive di
rector of human resources, spoke
next. He indicated that he is in
support of measures that educate
the workers.
"Does Stanford do the best job in
terms of staff development?" he
said. "Absolutely not."
Cordell asked the panel to con
template the cost necessary to subsi
dize a living wage.
"I don't know," Cammidge said.
"We have to look for recommenda
tions from the ASSU."

According to Redely, "there are
tremendous fund raising capabili
ties within this institution."
Londsdale argued, "I think peo
ple should be paid what's required
for them to do a good job ... There
is no need to pay the extra money
except to be nice," he added.
Earle was asked to comment on
the fact that Harvard has a steering
committee to probe the living-wage
issue.
"We have not established a steer
ing committee for this issue," he
said. "We believe that the final deci
sion on the living wage guidelines
should rest with the office of the
president and provost."
This view is consistent with (lam
midge's assertion that I larvard's
president made the final decision
regarding the living-wage issue.

Ray Chicano Docena, a member of
the audience, said that the Univer
sity should be more committed to
ward dealing with the issues facing

he said.

bility in the patient-care issue?"
She added, "Patients are hurt be
cause there aren't enough staff."
Earle defended the University's
position.
"It is not proper for President
Hennessy to be involved because
the hospitals are separate legal and
functional entities from the Univer
sity," he said.
John Cammidge, executive di
rector of human resources, spoke
next. He indicated that he is in
support of measures that educate
the workers.
"Does Stanford do the best job in
terms of staff development?" he
said. "Absolutely not."
Cordell asked the panel to con
template the cost necessary to subsi
dize a living wage.
"I don't know," Cammidge said.
"We have to look for recommenda
tions from the ASSU."

According to Redely, "there are
tremendous fund raising capabili
ties within this institution."
Londsdale argued, "I think peo
ple should be paid what's required
for them to do a good job ... There
is no need to pay the extra money
except to be nice," he added.
Earle was asked to comment on
the fact that Harvard has a steering
committee to probe the living-wage
issue.
"We have not established a steer
ing committee for this issue," he
said. "We believe that the final deci
sion on the living wage guidelines
should rest with the office of the
president and provost."
This view is consistent with (lam
midge's assertion that I larvard's
president made the final decision
regarding the living-wage issue.
Stanford Hospital Employee
Ray Chicano Docena, a member of
the audience, said that the Univer
sity should be more committed to
ward dealing with the issues facing
hospital workers.
"We are not asking for charity,"
he said.
