# Panelists debate wages for on-campus workers
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU's first Forum on Contem
porary Issues last night in the Meyer
Forum room probed living-wage issues
as they relate to Stanford workers. In the
past months, this has been a heated topic,
resurfacing in the form of student
protests and Wednesday's one-day strike
by hospital workers.
The seven-member panel consisted
of individuals from the University ad
ministration, student body and work
ers' coalition.
Event moderator and Vice Provost of
Campus Relations LaDoris Cordell
opened the discussion with specific ques

lions for each speaker.
Senior Meghana Redely of the Coali
tion for Labor Justice was asked to com
ment on the role students and workers
should play in the labor and social jus
tice movement.
"Because we are consumers at the
University, labor issues are a concern to
us," she said. "Workers need to represent
themselves â€” they need to have their
own voice."
Speaking after Reddy, senior Joe
Londsdale, editor in chief ofthe Stanford
Review alluded to the fact that subsidiz
ing the workers via a living wage does not
resolve the issue.
