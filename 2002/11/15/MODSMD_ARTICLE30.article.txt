# Lesbian sex scenes can't save this jewel heist stinker

Not only does super hot Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos get naked in this movie,
she does it with flair: "You don't have to
lick my ass," she growls to a bewildered
Antonio Banderas. "Just fuck me."
Caught in the utter absurdity of this
moment, I couldn't help wondering what
would make her want to do such a film.
Surely the blue-bodied mime from"X-

Men" would eventually want a role that
proves she can act, or at least deliver a ser
viceable line, right? Unfortunately, those
interested in Stamos' artistic assets will still
be left in the dark after seeing "Femme
Fatale," a striptease of a movie that
promises mystery, intrigue and even
metaphysics but delivers none of the
above.

The fundamental flaw
lies with director Brian rt

DePalma, a style guru with no concept of
narrative. He showed us he had game
with the underappreciated "Mission: Im
possible," but recent big studio clunkers
like "Snake Eyes" and "Mission to Mars"
pointed to larger problems. That 20-
minute continuous take that opens
"Snake Eyes?" Pretty fucking cool. The

I plot unraveling that occurs 30
minutes into that movie? Not so
much. The guy can knock your socks

off with what he puts in front ofhis
camera, but he can't sense a weak
plot when it's right in front ofhis
nose.
Of course, up until now you
could have argued that he just
hadn't found the right material,
the right writer to give him a satis-

fying story to tell. Strike that theory. With
"Feinme Fatale" I)e Palma is the writer,
meaning that all blame lies solely with him.
Lite plot is haphazard, to say the least.
Romijn-Stamos starts out as a thief for hire
stealing some valuable jewelry during (of
all things) the Cannes Film Festival. It's
pretty much your standard Mission: Im
possible type operation, except with the
titillating twist of a protracted lesbian
make-out scene. Stamos' character be
trays her crew and flees with the jewelry.
Jump to seven years later, and suddenly
she's the reclusive wife of an American
ambassador who's being chased by Anto
nio Banderas' retired paparazzo.
To reveal anything more might give

away too much — or imply that it matters.
To be sure, there are some admirable cin
ematic moments here — the opening
heist sequence and particularly pivotal
moments are well-directed, if drawn out.
The first half of the movie has a unique at
mosphere to it, minimizing dialogue and
relying heavily on music to convey the
disembodied feel of a cerebral foreign
film. De Palma even opens with a scene
from "Double Indemnity," alluding to his
aspirations of making a true film noir,
and at least fora while he succeeds. His
distinctive roving camera movements are
great at setting us on edge.
Unfortunately, we as an audience
eventually need this story to make some
sort of sense, and it's in this denouement
that the film utterly fails. Those cool cam
era sweeps eventually gel tiresome as you
start wishing for direct shots that won't
keep you waiting for the frame to move to
the right position. And when Romijn-Sta
mos finally opens her mouth to deliver
continuous lines of expository dialogue,
the spell of the movie is broken. It's not
Stamos' fault; her delivery may not be
perfect, but it's De Palma who refuses to
give us any info on her character until
well beyond the point where we've
stopped caring.
The final straw is the film's black box
ending, a convoluted lesson in fate and
second chances that it just laughably
bad. It's a dramatic failure, one that no
amount of T & A can ever salvage.


John Stamos-look alike is coyly shushed by Grace Kelly-look alike.
