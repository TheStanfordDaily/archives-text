The Pattern
Real Feelness

It's no secret that places like Toys 'R' Us and the mall don't carry the same
allure they once did. Sure, I've outgrown action figures and, to a much lesser
extent, video games. That's not the problem, though.
My real beef with toy stores and the mall is the mangy, drooling, filthy lit
tle shits that prowl these places like rabid suburban alley cats. Mouths sticky
and crusted with Cinnabon, they howl the unholy cry of Armageddon itself
when their mothers or fathers refuse to buy them the new Super Soaker gun.
Most of the time, I want to grab these children by their dirty hair and slam
them into the cash register. I don't go to Toys 'R' Us or the mall too often any
more.
When I first heard Chris Applegren's voice, I was sure that the Pattern
frontman was one of those kids at some point in his life. On the Pattern's first
LP, "Real Feelness," he screams, whines and yelps. But Applegren and his
bandmates are not snivelling little shits. They are Oakland's finest new rock
band.
"Real Feelness" continues down the path started by the Pattern's debut EP,
"Immediately," with a mix of electric guitars gnashing their teeth over Apple
gren's indignant wails. Most recently, the group has been called the Bay Area's
answer to the "new-garage" movement that includes the Hives and the White
Stripes. While the Pattern definitely mark a break from Lookout Records'
patented East Bay punk-pop, the "new garage" label gready oversimplifies the
band's music. As Applegren has said, it's akin to calling Blink 182 a "punk"
band or Weezer an "emo" band.
Instead, it would be more worthwhile to see the Pattern as a band that
makes music on its own terms. "Thunder Us," for example, hints at the com
plexity of a stripper's life: "Janet dances at night for the hard stares of the se
niors / When she yawns it's all right because they blink slow and don't see it."

"Happy Sarong" might be a sly observation about the band's role in the Bay
Area rock scene: "Spent some time feeling sorry / The best excuse fora party
/ Now I have to call back the see-you-laters / Killing all my time waiting for the
waiters." And in a totally unexpected deviation from the fast-'n'-furious rock
'n' roll blueprint, the last song, "Rangefinder" is a terribly sweet acoustic gui
tar song with no howling at all, just Applegren's tender, sincere and somewhat
awkward vocals.
Additionally, one of this album's real strengths is that the band knows when
to quit. With 12 songs delivered in just over half an hour, this is definitely a
punk record. "Real Feelness" is a nice introduction that doesn't overstay its
welcome and doesn't grate on your nerves. In fact, it's very pleasant. Its main
flaw is that the songs sometimes melt together.
So, no, the Pattern is not a group of irritating brats at the toy store, which
is a mixed blessing. After all, if I thought that the incorrigible little pigs at the
department store had the potential to someday make music this gcx>d, we'd all
have reason to be a bit more patient next time at the mall.
