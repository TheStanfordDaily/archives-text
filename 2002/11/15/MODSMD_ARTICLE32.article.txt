# Sigur Rós is here to depress you
## 
### KEVIN LIM 
The new record from Icelandic post-rock sensation
Sigur Ros has arrived just in time for November's gray
skies and onsets of seasonal depression. The experience of
the new album flows fluidly, but is rich and almost over
powering in its tranquilizing effect. At times, you're in
tensely watching a lonesome glacier from afar, seeing its
slow dance, understanding its calm, unfilled yearning for
intimacy. Soon, without apparent segue, you're experi
encing solemn dirges from within the warmth of your
mother's womb. Sad bastard space-out sessions haven't
had such a devoted and appropriate soundtrack in years.

Structure and adher
ence to convention has
been brutally minimized

by the aggressively esoteric band: The tracks are all unti
tled, and the album itself is signified only by an empty set
of parentheses. The liner notes in "{)" are equally devot
ed to feeling without form. They have a strange, plasticky
vellum feel and contain only soft images that resemble a
worm s eye view of an arid tundra. The words oozed out
by vocalist Jon Tlior Birgisson are sung in "Hopelandic,"
Sigur Ros custom-made dialect of Icelandic with a side of
English mishmash. This denial of structures and labels
creates fora panic-free, slow drowning in spontaneously
arriving, powerfully lingering emotion.
Sleepy and sad listeners beware, for this is a major de
pression inducer, ready to defeat any preexisting upbeat
feelings you may have. The tracks on "()" need not refer
to concrete things to bring the common listener down.
Birgisson's eerie falsetto delivers groans of raw melan
choly which coax out the depressing imagery from every
soul within its range. The long, nameless tracks wander to
ward you, each bringing a greater intensity, until the 20-
minute long climax slowly obliterates the emotional land
scape in track seven, leaving the listener in a tranquil,
emotionally purged haze.
Given some patience, optimism and a ton of emotional
resilience, this record can be appreciated for what it does
well. Post-rock artists pompously prophesize about, them
selves and have declared Sigur Ros their übertalented
princes of the future. The recent popularization of Sigur
Ros by high-profile ambassadors such as Brad Pitt and
Thorn Yorke (who have both pushed these Icelanders)
may have given them a case of accessibility anxiety. But
they have nothing to worry about; this album has ascend
ed to the elite esoteric shelf where all of us still enamored
with this yesteryear genre called "rock" will find it hard to
reach and hardly appealing. Regardless of the attitude,"(
)" is well- orchestrated and beautiful in its own way, and
there is definitely a place for mood engineering like this.


The Icelandic boys of Sigur Ros come together (or a moment
of dreary self-reflection.
