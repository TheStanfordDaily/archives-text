# I Am the WTC interview
## Duo just wants you to dance 
### Ryan Sands 
sometimes it's hard to turn people onto a
band with a name like I Am the World
Trade Center. When I mention their name
to friends, jaws often drop and people as
sume some sort of sick capitalization on a
national tragedy to be occurring. Only at
the reassurance that 1 Am ihe World Trade Center,
made up of duo Dan Geller and Amy Dykes, have had
their name sine 1999, do people even give the music a
chance. For those who can't get past the name, they
are missing out on really rad electronic pop music.
And for those who take the time to learn the details be
hind the band and the PR nightmare that they en
dured following the Sept. 11 attack on New York, you
see a core of two people working and living together
in a deep personal and professional relationship.
lATWTC's latest album, "The Tight Connection,"
was released on Kindercore Records, which was
founded by Geller in Athens, Georgia and later moved
its headquarters to New York City. While in NYC,
Geller started I Am the World Trade Center with
Dykes. The World Trade Center dominated Geller
and Dyke's daily skyline as the recorded their first
album "Out of the Loop. The duo, who have dated
since 1997, decided on the name as a perfect metaphor
for the dynamic of their relationship. The two towers,
equal and independent, together made up one entity
and came to represent the relationship that Geller and
Dykes forged professional and personally.
When the attacks happened, the band found itself
with a huge dilemma: to keep its name or not to keep
its name? After making statements on their web site
(which was hit with some 7 million visitors on Sept. 11
as people searched Google for information on the
WI'C attack) and touring under the shortened, "1 Am
The World," Geller and Dykes finally decided to keep
the name that had come to mean so many things to
them. For awhile, lATWTC prefaced each show with
an explanation of the band name's origin, but now are
greeted by very positive crowds during their tours
throughout the country this past year.

Though the band's name was at first a light
ning rod for media interest, lATWTC has
recently received tons of praise from in-

dependent press and alternative music
magazines regarding their second
112 major release, " The Tight Connec-

tion." The album is chock-full of
lovely and infectious electronic
compositions that combine the

best pop melodies and elec
tronic beats have to otter. The
tracks feature Geller's won
derful panache for get-your-

ass-on-the-dance-floor |
hooks and Dykes' some-J
times-commanding, some
times-lilting voice deliver- *
ing personal reflections

and accounts on the year that 2001 came to be for the
band.
I talked to Geller earlier this week and discuss the
band's post-9/11 situation, the unique and modern
sound on their new album and his secret life as a geeky
bioengineering major.
INTERMISSION: I know that the band formed while
you were living in New York City. As the place where
lATWTC first started out and the site of the 9/11 at
tacks, how do crowds in NYC react to your live shows?
DAN GELLER: NYC crowds have been VERY sup
portive. We have had our best shows ever in NYC.
Fhe first time we played NYC. after 9/11 was at the
Knitting Factory. Amy explained the name and why
we kept it and we were met with a standing ovation.
We actually have quite a big following in NYC and def
initely feel love whenever we go there.
INTERMISSION: Now, the term "electroclash" has
been thrown around by music critics, with synth throw
backs like Peaches, Ladytron and Fischerspwner in the
forefront of discussions. W r here do you think lATWTC
fits in to this ? Do you feel like you are peers of the artists
involved with the electroclash movement?
GELLER: I don't feel like we are a part of electroclash
at all. Electroclash seems to be pretty impersonal and
cold. The whole point of world trade is to be real and
personal. We are trying to take electronic music and
bring it to the people, whereas electroclash seems ex
clusive. I like some of that music, but we don't feel a
part of that scene. It just lacks the songwriting side of
music that is just as important to us as the sound of our
music. We are trying to do something on our own. If
there is any crossover, it is unintentional, but we don't
really worry about labels too much. After a while you
get over that stuff.

INTERMISSION: "The light Connection" features
a really rad cover of an early Stone Roses song and

the classic '80s tune, "(all Me" by Blondie and
Georgio Moroder. And yet, I don't really feel
the influence of' Bos new wave in your sound
on "The light Connection," that is, it sounds
very modern and electronic at the same time.
Do you intentionally try to keep from falling
into the trap of sounding "retro?"

GELLER: I am glad to hear that you feel
that way. I had no intentions of making a
retro record when making "Connection." A

lot of people have been trying to throw it in with the
whole '80s retro movements. In our minds, it is cer
tainly a modern record. Ironically, I was not even con
scious that it would be considered retro, so I never had
any intention of NOT making it sound retro either.
The influences on this record were really gear-related
as much as musical. We got a Nord Micro Modular
and it had a big role in shaping the sound of the
record. It makes a lot of electro bleeps which actually
give the record any retro feel it might have.
INTERMISSION: Both "Out of The Loop" and"The
light Connection" were recorded and mixed com
pletely on a Mac laptop. What are the limitations you
see in using only a computer to produce an album?
GELLER: I really see no limitations. Software and
hardware have progressed to the point that I have
been able to do anything I have wanted to with the
laptop studio. As long as the signals coming in are
clean, anything can be accomplished. The biggest
advantage is that we can work on the music anytime
we want; we don't have to wait fora studio to free up
to record new songs.
INTERMISSION: Everyone I've talked to who has
seen you perform live says that you guys are even more
exciting in person than on the albums. With only two
members and a lot of technical equipment with you on
stage, what is your approach when performing live?
GELLER: We f<x:us on creating as much energy as hu
manly possible between two people and getting the en
tire crowd to join in. The show is centered around com
plete physical and visual performance. We throw our
entire bodies into the show — It is sort of like running a
dance marathon with the goal of getting the entire
room to dance with us. We know we have accomplished
our goal when everyone in the room is dancing!

INTERMISSION: A lot of indie
pop bands are composed of a

duo in a relationship — I im
mediately think ofSan Fran-

Cisco-based couple Mates of State, and formerly-mar
ried bands like Quasi and the White Stripes. How does
the relationship between you and Amy drive the
band's songwriting and performances?
GELLER: I think the relationship is very influential
on the lyrics. Amy writes a lot about our relationship.
In fact, if you look close, I think one can read a lot into
our relationship (and it certainly isn't all roses). The
performance is entirely centered on the energy we
create between us; we play off each other really well
because we are always around each other.
INTERMISSION: I read that you just finished your
master's degree in bioengineering. Where did you go
to school, and how did you manage to finish while
being in a band and running a record label?
GELLER: I got my biological engineering masters at
the University of Georgia. It is really a balancing act to
do all of my activities. 1 still do research as an engineer
when 1 am at home, and Kindercore is sort of running
itself now since we have a new distribution deal. The
band takes top priority and the other activities are just
hobbies — well, as much as label head and engineer
can be.
INTERMISSION: I have to ask. What were you like
in college? If you were an engineering student, you
must have been pretty ... tun ... busy with classes?
I'm not trying to say nerdy, I swear.
GELLER: 1 was a scenester in college too I guess. I
went to about 5 shows a week and was as in to music as
I am now. I also suirted Kindercore in college so that
took away some of the nerdy stigma. The key was that
I didn't drink at all in college. I kept a clear head and
was able to make straight A's. Now I drink a little since
I don't need all my brain cells anymore.
INTERMISSION: What is the next step for
lATWTC? "The Tight Connection" marks a much
more lyrically and musically complex album for the
band. Are you going to keep going in the direction you
went from "Out of the Loop" to your latest record, or
are you looking to any new techniques that you are
hoping to try out?
GELLER: The new record is already underway and is
turning out to be a much more rock record. I got a gui
tar really cheap so I have been adding a lot of guitar
riffs to the new stuff. I have this hidden agenda that
the new record will be a faux-heavy metal album a la
Metallica's "Black Album." But don't worry, despite
the rockin' guitars the new stuff is wholly electronic
and danceable. The guitars serve only as a new source
of loops to tweak and make pop songs with. I have
been told the new stuff sounds like an electronic ver
sion of the Jam with female vocals, which is pretty
freaking cool as far as I am concerned.
I Am the World Trade ('.enter will be performing tonight at
10 p.m. in San Francisco at Blast Haus.

them. For awhile, lATWTC prefaced each show with
an explanation of the band name's origin, but now are
greeted by very positive crowds during their tours
throughout the country this past year.

Though the band's name was at first a light
ning rod for media interest, lATWTC has
recently received tons of praise from in-

dependent press and alternative music
magazines regarding their second
112 major release, " The Tight Connec-

tion." The album is chock-full of
lovely and infectious electronic
compositions that combine the

best pop melodies and elec
tronic beats have to otter. The
tracks feature Geller's won
derful panache for get-your-

ass-on-the-dance-floor |
hooks and Dykes' some-J
times-commanding, some
times-lilting voice deliver- *
ing personal reflections

and accounts on the year that 2001 came to be for the
band.
I talked to Geller earlier this week and discuss the
band's post-9/11 situation, the unique and modern
sound on their new album and his secret life as a geeky
bioengineering major.
INTERMISSION: I know that the band formed while
you were living in New York City. As the place where
lATWTC first started out and the site of the 9/11 at
tacks, how do crowds in NYC react to your live shows?
DAN GELLER: NYC crowds have been VERY sup
portive. We have had our best shows ever in NYC.
Fhe first time we played NYC. after 9/11 was at the
Knitting Factory. Amy explained the name and why
we kept it and we were met with a standing ovation.
We actually have quite a big following in NYC and def
initely feel love whenever we go there.
INTERMISSION: Now, the term "electroclash" has
been thrown around by music critics, with synth throw
backs like Peaches, Ladytron and Fischerspwner in the
forefront of discussions. W r here do you think lATWTC
fits in to this ? Do you feel like you are peers of the artists
involved with the electroclash movement?
GELLER: I don't feel like we are a part of electroclash
at all. Electroclash seems to be pretty impersonal and
cold. The whole point of world trade is to be real and
personal. We are trying to take electronic music and
bring it to the people, whereas electroclash seems ex
clusive. I like some of that music, but we don't feel a
part of that scene. It just lacks the songwriting side of
music that is just as important to us as the sound of our
music. We are trying to do something on our own. If
there is any crossover, it is unintentional, but we don't
really worry about labels too much. After a while you
get over that stuff.

INTERMISSION: "The light Connection" features
a really rad cover of an early Stone Roses song and

the classic '80s tune, "(all Me" by Blondie and
Georgio Moroder. And yet, I don't really feel
the influence of' Bos new wave in your sound
on "The light Connection," that is, it sounds
very modern and electronic at the same time.
Do you intentionally try to keep from falling
into the trap of sounding "retro?"

GELLER: I am glad to hear that you feel
that way. I had no intentions of making a
retro record when making "Connection." A

lot of people have been trying to throw it in with the
whole '80s retro movements. In our minds, it is cer
tainly a modern record. Ironically, I was not even con
scious that it would be considered retro, so I never had
any intention of NOT making it sound retro either.
The influences on this record were really gear-related
as much as musical. We got a Nord Micro Modular
and it had a big role in shaping the sound of the
record. It makes a lot of electro bleeps which actually
give the record any retro feel it might have.
INTERMISSION: Both "Out of The Loop" and"The
light Connection" were recorded and mixed com
pletely on a Mac laptop. What are the limitations you
see in using only a computer to produce an album?
GELLER: I really see no limitations. Software and
hardware have progressed to the point that I have
been able to do anything I have wanted to with the
laptop studio. As long as the signals coming in are
clean, anything can be accomplished. The biggest
advantage is that we can work on the music anytime
we want; we don't have to wait fora studio to free up
to record new songs.
INTERMISSION: Everyone I've talked to who has
seen you perform live says that you guys are even more
exciting in person than on the albums. With only two
members and a lot of technical equipment with you on
stage, what is your approach when performing live?
GELLER: We f<x:us on creating as much energy as hu
manly possible between two people and getting the en
tire crowd to join in. The show is centered around com
plete physical and visual performance. We throw our
entire bodies into the show — It is sort of like running a
dance marathon with the goal of getting the entire
room to dance with us. We know we have accomplished
our goal when everyone in the room is dancing!

INTERMISSION: A lot of indie
pop bands are composed of a

duo in a relationship — I im
mediately think ofSan Fran-

Cisco-based couple Mates of State, and formerly-mar
ried bands like Quasi and the White Stripes. How does
the relationship between you and Amy drive the
band's songwriting and performances?
GELLER: I think the relationship is very influential
on the lyrics. Amy writes a lot about our relationship.
In fact, if you look close, I think one can read a lot into
our relationship (and it certainly isn't all roses). The
performance is entirely centered on the energy we
create between us; we play off each other really well
because we are always around each other.
INTERMISSION: I read that you just finished your
master's degree in bioengineering. Where did you go
to school, and how did you manage to finish while
being in a band and running a record label?
GELLER: I got my biological engineering masters at
the University of Georgia. It is really a balancing act to
do all of my activities. 1 still do research as an engineer
when 1 am at home, and Kindercore is sort of running
itself now since we have a new distribution deal. The
band takes top priority and the other activities are just
hobbies — well, as much as label head and engineer
can be.
INTERMISSION: I have to ask. What were you like
in college? If you were an engineering student, you
must have been pretty ... tun ... busy with classes?
I'm not trying to say nerdy, I swear.
GELLER: 1 was a scenester in college too I guess. I
went to about 5 shows a week and was as in to music as
I am now. I also suirted Kindercore in college so that
took away some of the nerdy stigma. The key was that
I didn't drink at all in college. I kept a clear head and
was able to make straight A's. Now I drink a little since
I don't need all my brain cells anymore.
INTERMISSION: What is the next step for
lATWTC? "The Tight Connection" marks a much
more lyrically and musically complex album for the
band. Are you going to keep going in the direction you
went from "Out of the Loop" to your latest record, or
are you looking to any new techniques that you are
hoping to try out?
GELLER: The new record is already underway and is
turning out to be a much more rock record. I got a gui
tar really cheap so I have been adding a lot of guitar
riffs to the new stuff. I have this hidden agenda that
the new record will be a faux-heavy metal album a la
Metallica's "Black Album." But don't worry, despite
the rockin' guitars the new stuff is wholly electronic
and danceable. The guitars serve only as a new source
of loops to tweak and make pop songs with. I have
been told the new stuff sounds like an electronic ver
sion of the Jam with female vocals, which is pretty
freaking cool as far as I am concerned.
I Am the World Trade ('.enter will be performing tonight at
10 p.m. in San Francisco at Blast Haus.


sometimes it's hard to turn people onto a
band with a name like I Am the World
Trade Center. When I mention their name
to friends, jaws often drop and people as
sume some sort of sick capitalization on a
national tragedy to be occurring. Only at
the reassurance that 1 Am ihe World Trade Center,
made up of duo Dan Geller and Amy Dykes, have had
their name sine 1999, do people even give the music a
chance. For those who can't get past the name, they
are missing out on really rad electronic pop music.
And for those who take the time to learn the details be
hind the band and the PR nightmare that they en
dured following the Sept. 11 attack on New York, you
see a core of two people working and living together
in a deep personal and professional relationship.
lATWTC's latest album, "The Tight Connection,"
was released on Kindercore Records, which was
founded by Geller in Athens, Georgia and later moved
its headquarters to New York City. While in NYC,
Geller started I Am the World Trade Center with
Dykes. The World Trade Center dominated Geller
and Dyke's daily skyline as the recorded their first
album "Out of the Loop. The duo, who have dated
since 1997, decided on the name as a perfect metaphor
for the dynamic of their relationship. The two towers,
equal and independent, together made up one entity
and came to represent the relationship that Geller and
Dykes forged professional and personally.
When the attacks happened, the band found itself
with a huge dilemma: to keep its name or not to keep
its name? After making statements on their web site
(which was hit with some 7 million visitors on Sept. 11
as people searched Google for information on the
WI'C attack) and touring under the shortened, "1 Am
The World," Geller and Dykes finally decided to keep
the name that had come to mean so many things to
them. For awhile, lATWTC prefaced each show with
an explanation of the band name's origin, but now are

backs like Peaches, Ladytron and Fischerspwner in the
forefront of discussions. W r here do you think lATWTC
fits in to this ? Do you feel like you are peers of the artists
involved with the electroclash movement?
GELLER: I don't feel like we are a part of electroclash
at all. Electroclash seems to be pretty impersonal and
cold. The whole point of world trade is to be real and
personal. We are trying to take electronic music and
bring it to the people, whereas electroclash seems ex
clusive. I like some of that music, but we don't feel a
part of that scene. It just lacks the songwriting side of
music that is just as important to us as the sound of our
music. We are trying to do something on our own. If
there is any crossover, it is unintentional, but we don't
really worry about labels too much. After a while you
get over that stuff.

INTERMISSION: "The light Connection" features
a really rad cover of an early Stone Roses song and

the classic '80s tune, "(all Me" by Blondie and
Georgio Moroder. And yet, I don't really feel
the influence of' Bos new wave in your sound
on "The light Connection," that is, it sounds
very modern and electronic at the same time.
Do you intentionally try to keep from falling
into the trap of sounding "retro?"

GELLER: I am glad to hear that you feel
that way. I had no intentions of making a
retro record when making "Connection." A

lot of people have been trying to throw it in with the
whole '80s retro movements. In our minds, it is cer
tainly a modern record. Ironically, I was not even con
scious that it would be considered retro, so I never had
any intention of NOT making it sound retro either.
The influences on this record were really gear-related
as much as musical. We got a Nord Micro Modular
and it had a big role in shaping the sound of the
record. It makes a lot of electro bleeps which actually
give the record any retro feel it might have.
INTERMISSION: Both "Out of The Loop" and"The
light Connection" were recorded and mixed com
pletely on a Mac laptop. What are the limitations you
see in using only a computer to produce an album?
GELLER: I really see no limitations. Software and
hardware have progressed to the point that I have
been able to do anything I have wanted to with the
laptop studio. As long as the signals coming in are
clean, anything can be accomplished. The biggest
advantage is that we can work on the music anytime
we want; we don't have to wait fora studio to free up
to record new songs.
INTERMISSION: Everyone I've talked to who has
seen you perform live says that you guys are even more
exciting in person than on the albums. With only two
members and a lot of technical equipment with you on
stage, what is your approach when performing live?
GELLER: We f<x:us on creating as much energy as hu
manly possible between two people and getting the en
tire crowd to join in. The show is centered around com
plete physical and visual performance. We throw our
entire bodies into the show — It is sort of like running a
dance marathon with the goal of getting the entire
room to dance with us. We know we have accomplished
our goal when everyone in the room is dancing!

INTERMISSION: A lot of indie
pop bands are composed of a

duo in a relationship — I im
mediately think ofSan Fran-

Cisco-based couple Mates of State, and formerly-mar
ried bands like Quasi and the White Stripes. How does
the relationship between you and Amy drive the
band's songwriting and performances?
GELLER: I think the relationship is very influential
on the lyrics. Amy writes a lot about our relationship.
In fact, if you look close, I think one can read a lot into
our relationship (and it certainly isn't all roses). The
performance is entirely centered on the energy we
create between us; we play off each other really well
because we are always around each other.
INTERMISSION: I read that you just finished your
master's degree in bioengineering. Where did you go
to school, and how did you manage to finish while
being in a band and running a record label?
GELLER: I got my biological engineering masters at
the University of Georgia. It is really a balancing act to
do all of my activities. 1 still do research as an engineer
when 1 am at home, and Kindercore is sort of running
itself now since we have a new distribution deal. The
band takes top priority and the other activities are just
hobbies — well, as much as label head and engineer
can be.
INTERMISSION: I have to ask. What were you like
in college? If you were an engineering student, you
must have been pretty ... tun ... busy with classes?
I'm not trying to say nerdy, I swear.
GELLER: 1 was a scenester in college too I guess. I
went to about 5 shows a week and was as in to music as
I am now. I also suirted Kindercore in college so that
took away some of the nerdy stigma. The key was that
I didn't drink at all in college. I kept a clear head and
was able to make straight A's. Now I drink a little since
I don't need all my brain cells anymore.
INTERMISSION: What is the next step for
lATWTC? "The Tight Connection" marks a much
more lyrically and musically complex album for the
band. Are you going to keep going in the direction you
went from "Out of the Loop" to your latest record, or
are you looking to any new techniques that you are
hoping to try out?
GELLER: The new record is already underway and is
turning out to be a much more rock record. I got a gui
tar really cheap so I have been adding a lot of guitar
riffs to the new stuff. I have this hidden agenda that
the new record will be a faux-heavy metal album a la
Metallica's "Black Album." But don't worry, despite
the rockin' guitars the new stuff is wholly electronic
and danceable. The guitars serve only as a new source
of loops to tweak and make pop songs with. I have
been told the new stuff sounds like an electronic ver
sion of the Jam with female vocals, which is pretty
freaking cool as far as I am concerned.
I Am the World Trade ('.enter will be performing tonight at
10 p.m. in San Francisco at Blast Haus.


sometimes it's hard to turn people onto a
band with a name like I Am the World
Trade Center. When I mention their name
to friends, jaws often drop and people as
sume some sort of sick capitalization on a
national tragedy to be occurring. Only at
the reassurance that 1 Am ihe World Trade Center,
made up of duo Dan Geller and Amy Dykes, have had
their name sine 1999, do people even give the music a
chance. For those who can't get past the name, they
are missing out on really rad electronic pop music.
And for those who take the time to learn the details be
hind the band and the PR nightmare that they en
dured following the Sept. 11 attack on New York, you
see a core of two people working and living together
in a deep personal and professional relationship.
lATWTC's latest album, "The Tight Connection,"
was released on Kindercore Records, which was
founded by Geller in Athens, Georgia and later moved
its headquarters to New York City. While in NYC,
Geller started I Am the World Trade Center with
Dykes. The World Trade Center dominated Geller
and Dyke's daily skyline as the recorded their first
album "Out of the Loop. The duo, who have dated
since 1997, decided on the name as a perfect metaphor
for the dynamic of their relationship. The two towers,
equal and independent, together made up one entity
and came to represent the relationship that Geller and
Dykes forged professional and personally.
When the attacks happened, the band found itself
with a huge dilemma: to keep its name or not to keep
its name? After making statements on their web site
(which was hit with some 7 million visitors on Sept. 11
as people searched Google for information on the
WI'C attack) and touring under the shortened, "1 Am
The World," Geller and Dykes finally decided to keep
the name that had come to mean so many things to
them. For awhile, lATWTC prefaced each show with
an explanation of the band name's origin, but now are
greeted by very positive crowds during their tours
throughout the country this past year.

Though the band's name was at first a light
ning rod for media interest, lATWTC has
recently received tons of praise from in-

dependent press and alternative music
magazines regarding their second
112 major release, " The Tight Connec-

tion." The album is chock-full of
lovely and infectious electronic
compositions that combine the

best pop melodies and elec
tronic beats have to otter. The
tracks feature Geller's won
derful panache for get-your-

ass-on-the-dance-floor |
hooks and Dykes' some-J
times-commanding, some
times-lilting voice deliver- *
ing personal reflections

and accounts on the year that 2001 came to be for the
band.
I talked to Geller earlier this week and discuss the
band's post-9/11 situation, the unique and modern
sound on their new album and his secret life as a geeky
bioengineering major.
INTERMISSION: I know that the band formed while
you were living in New York City. As the place where
lATWTC first started out and the site of the 9/11 at
tacks, how do crowds in NYC react to your live shows?
DAN GELLER: NYC crowds have been VERY sup
portive. We have had our best shows ever in NYC.
Fhe first time we played NYC. after 9/11 was at the
Knitting Factory. Amy explained the name and why
we kept it and we were met with a standing ovation.
We actually have quite a big following in NYC and def
initely feel love whenever we go there.
