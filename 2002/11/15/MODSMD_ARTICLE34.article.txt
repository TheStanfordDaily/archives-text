# Eminem makes your momma cry
## '8 Mile' is derivative of 'Rocky' without all the cool boxing. 
### PHIL FLORES 
Does Eminem look like Rocky Balboa, that indomitable Ital
ian from all those "Rocky" flicks of the late '70s, '80s, and '90s?
As my good friend Samuel L. Jackson from "Star Wars: Episode
II" would say, "I don't think so." But, that's what director Cur
tis Hanson and writer Scott Silver would want you eager ticket

buyers to think.
Set in 1995 on the
gritty streets of Detroit,
the film chronicles a
few important days in
the life of young rapper
/ auto machinist Jimmy
Smith, Jr., played by
Eminem a.k.a. Mar
shall Mathers. Bur
dened with an out-of
work mother (Kim
Basinger) and a pen
chant for choking at
rap battles, Jimmy re
mains determined to
make a name for him
self as a rapper and es
cape his trailer-park ex
istence. Replace Detroit
with Philadelphia and
rapping with boxing,
and what do you get?

The entire "Rocky" series, of course.
As expected, Eminem, doesn't offer much range in his acting
debut. Basically, he has two different acting faces: his "pissed
off-at-life-that-I'm-just-trailer-trash" face and his "sweet-caring
soft-voice" face. Ilie first one can be seen in his many music
videos, while the second appears every time Jimmy shares a
scene with his little sister.
While the film proves that Eminem will not be the next Bran
do or even the next Tom Arnold as far as acting goes, it does
tout a few strong performances, mainly from Jimmy's friends.
As Jimmy's wise pal Future, Mekhi Phiter acts with just the right
amount of strength and charisma to make his words ring with
resonance. Since his debut in Spike Lee's "Clockers," Phifer has
built a large, yet inconsistent body of work. Hopefully, his per

formance here will bring him better projects. On the other end
of the scale is the loveable Cheddar Bob, played with idiotic hi
larity by Evan Jones. Apparently graduating from the "Steve
Zahn ("That Thing You Do")" school of acting, Jones provides
most, if not all, the laughs in this movie.
The rest of the film's acting falls flat. Basinger, a long, long way
from her best-supporting-actress turn in director Hanson's "LA
Confidential," is horrible as Jimmy's mother. She doesn't garner
much sympathy even from those people that question Eminem's
hateful lyrics toward his real-life mother. Brittany Murphy, as
Eminem's one-night stand / love interest Alex, exudes such an
excessive amount of skankiness that even Christina Aguilera on
her good days couldn't hold a candle to her.
After seeing this movie, one has to wonder why an accom
plished filmmaker like Hanson would take on such a lousy pro
ject as "8 Mile." Perhaps, the challenge of remaking "Rocky" for
the new millennium was something he just couldn't pass up.
Despite the terrible screenplay by Silver, Hanson recruited an
A-list crew that salvaged some of the movie. Foremost among
them is cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ("Amores Perros" and
the upcoming Spike Lee film "25th Hour") whose harrowing vi
sion ofa cold and dungy Detroit represents one of the few high
lights this waste of a movie offered.
