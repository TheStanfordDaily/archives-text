# Kurt's 'Journals':
## An intimate look at the Man 
### NICK STONE 
Back in the day, Nirvana was huge.
Everyone and their brother liked
Nirvana, but more importantly,
they saved a lot of weirdos and
outcasts from going the Columbine route.
Marc Rios was the kid in middle school who
everyone picked on and made fun of: He
had a big round head with a classic bowl-cut
and cowlick combo and buckteeth.
When I was an eighth-grader about to
leave for California, he was still a dorky sev
enth-grader stuck in suburban Illinois, but

toward the end of the year
I witnessed his metamor-

phosis. Marc Rios grew his hair long and
dyed it different colors; he started sporting
a shabby-looking trench-coat; he got a pair
of Converse All-Stars and wrote "SID" on
the left toe and "NANCY" on the right, in
pen; and, quelle surprise, he started wear
ing Nirvana t-shirts. Nirvana was undoubt
edly responsible for his transformation, as it
had been for mine a year and half before.
This was more than a trend: For lots of
kids, Nirvana changed more than our
clothes. For devotees like myself, Nirvana
and Kurt Cobain in particular represented
a new set of values, a new ethos that would
keep us alive through the looming horrors
of high school life.
And now it's 2002, and Kurt Cobain is
just another wax dummy in the rock and
roll pantheon. And somehow it made
sense to someone, somewhere, to publish
selected pages of his private journals —
letters, essays, stoned scribblings, draw
ings, lists of favorite albums — in a big art
book. Without question, it is an art book:
The pages have been reverently repro
duced digitally and life-size, with mushed
wire spine and dog-eared pages and all. I
would have sold my soul for this book
when I was 12, but now I feel intrusive and
skeptical looking through someone else's
affairs. In some ways it's probably better to
maintain some distance from the icons you
used to hold sacred. The alienation and
anger and sadness that resonated with me
so strongly when I was 12 now seem a little
decadent and naive.
But on the whole, I found "Journals" im
mensely satisfying. At its best moments, it's
like the most personal, honest fanzine pos
sible. "Journals" is a really intimate look at
Cobain's interests and obsessions, and his

halting attempts to come to terms with hick
towns, bozo jock rockers, the music indus
try, "scene" elitism, etc.
There are some hilarious, beautiful and
disgusting moments in the book, and as an
archive, for all its limitations, it looks great
— take a look under the funereal dust jack
et at a superb book cover, masquerading as
a Mead spiral notebook. This alone is worth
the 30 bucks.
Despite its similarly melodramatic black
packaging, "Nirvana" is the worst possible
complement to "Journals." Where the book
is personal, flawed and emotional, the
album is a detached and truncated greatest
hits retrospective that outfits old songs with
shiny new digital mastering. I can't hear
much of a difference except that all the
songs somehow sound worse than they ever
did on the albums. "Nirvana" is the kind of
shady deal that should only be sold by late
night infomercial. An hour of cheesy, melo
dramatic video montages and third-rate
celebrity appearances is the accompani
ment this release deserves.
What "Journals" hints at, and what
"Nirvana" strenuously ignores, is that the
whole appeal of Nirvana was just as much
about fun and energy as it was about ado
lescent angst. For all the bullshit about
Kurt Cobain and John Lennon as silver
tongued generational spokesmen, both
men wrote a lot of songs based on word
play and nonsense in addition to their,
ahem, Anthems of Alienation. "Journals"
makes it clear that Cobain was just as influ
enced by Devo and Shonen Knife as he was
by Sabbath and Zeppelin. The importance
of making thoughtful music that doesn't
take itself too seriously is discussed in one
of his earlier journal entries:
"My lyrics are ... split down the middle
between very sincere opinions and feelings
and sarcastic and hopefully humorous re
buttals towards cliche bohemian ideals that
have been exhausted for years. I mean it
seems like there are only two personalities
for songwriters — either they're sad, tragic
visionaries like Morrissey or Michael Stipe
or Robert Smith, or the goofy, nutty white
boy, 'Hey let's party and forget everything
people' like Van Halen or all that other
heavy metal crap. I mean 1 like to be pas
sionate and sincere, but 1 also like to have
fun and act like a dork. Geeks Unite."

songs somehow sound worse than they ever
did on the albums. "Nirvana" is the kind of
shady deal that should only be sold by late
night infomercial. An hour of cheesy, melo
dramatic video montages and third-rate
celebrity appearances is the accompani
ment this release deserves.
What "Journals" hints at, and what
"Nirvana" strenuously ignores, is that the
whole appeal of Nirvana was just as much
about fun and energy as it was about ado
lescent angst. For all the bullshit about
Kurt Cobain and John Lennon as silver
tongued generational spokesmen, both
men wrote a lot of songs based on word
play and nonsense in addition to their,
ahem, Anthems of Alienation. "Journals"
makes it clear that Cobain was just as influ
enced by Devo and Shonen Knife as he was
by Sabbath and Zeppelin. The importance
of making thoughtful music that doesn't
take itself too seriously is discussed in one
of his earlier journal entries:
"My lyrics are ... split down the middle
between very sincere opinions and feelings
and sarcastic and hopefully humorous re
buttals towards cliche bohemian ideals that
have been exhausted for years. I mean it
seems like there are only two personalities
for songwriters — either they're sad, tragic
visionaries like Morrissey or Michael Stipe
or Robert Smith, or the goofy, nutty white
boy, 'Hey let's party and forget everything
people' like Van Halen or all that other
heavy metal crap. I mean 1 like to be pas
sionate and sincere, but 1 also like to have
fun and act like a dork. Geeks Unite."


Kurt Cobain: From bowl-headed blonde child to grunge rock God.
Back in the day, Nirvana was huge.
Everyone and their brother liked
Nirvana, but more importantly,
they saved a lot of weirdos and
outcasts from going the Columbine route.
Marc Rios was the kid in middle school who
everyone picked on and made fun of: He
had a big round head with a classic bowl-cut
and cowlick combo and buckteeth.
When I was an eighth-grader about to
leave for California, he was still a dorky sev
enth-grader stuck in suburban Illinois, but

toward the end of the year
I witnessed his metamor-

phosis. Marc Rios grew his hair long and
dyed it different colors; he started sporting
a shabby-looking trench-coat; he got a pair
of Converse All-Stars and wrote "SID" on
the left toe and "NANCY" on the right, in
pen; and, quelle surprise, he started wear
ing Nirvana t-shirts. Nirvana was undoubt
edly responsible for his transformation, as it
had been for mine a year and half before.
This was more than a trend: For lots of
kids, Nirvana changed more than our
clothes. For devotees like myself, Nirvana
and Kurt Cobain in particular represented
a new set of values, a new ethos that would
keep us alive through the looming horrors
of high school life.
And now it's 2002, and Kurt Cobain is
just another wax dummy in the rock and
roll pantheon. And somehow it made
sense to someone, somewhere, to publish
selected pages of his private journals —
letters, essays, stoned scribblings, draw
ings, lists of favorite albums — in a big art
book. Without question, it is an art book:
The pages have been reverently repro
duced digitally and life-size, with mushed
wire spine and dog-eared pages and all. I
would have sold my soul for this book
when I was 12, but now I feel intrusive and
skeptical looking through someone else's
affairs. In some ways it's probably better to
maintain some distance from the icons you
used to hold sacred. The alienation and
anger and sadness that resonated with me
so strongly when I was 12 now seem a little
decadent and naive.
But on the whole, I found "Journals" im
mensely satisfying. At its best moments, it's
like the most personal, honest fanzine pos
sible. "Journals" is a really intimate look at
Cobain's interests and obsessions, and his

halting attempts to come to terms with hick
towns, bozo jock rockers, the music indus
try, "scene" elitism, etc.
There are some hilarious, beautiful and
disgusting moments in the book, and as an
archive, for all its limitations, it looks great
— take a look under the funereal dust jack
et at a superb book cover, masquerading as
a Mead spiral notebook. This alone is worth
the 30 bucks.
Despite its similarly melodramatic black
packaging, "Nirvana" is the worst possible
complement to "Journals." Where the book
is personal, flawed and emotional, the
album is a detached and truncated greatest
hits retrospective that outfits old songs with
shiny new digital mastering. I can't hear
much of a difference except that all the
songs somehow sound worse than they ever
did on the albums. "Nirvana" is the kind of
shady deal that should only be sold by late
night infomercial. An hour of cheesy, melo
dramatic video montages and third-rate

ment this release deserves.
