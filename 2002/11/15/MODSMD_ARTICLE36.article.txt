# Foos got nothin' to lose except creativity, rockingness

### KARAN MAHAJAN 
During those misty Nirvana-nostalgic October days that
led up to the release of The Foo Fighter's "One by One," I
found myself poring over interviews with Dave Grohl and
developing an unhealthy pen-cap chewing habit. As my
gums bled blue, one line in particular caught my attention:
"Armed with a Heineken and a pack of Marlboros,"
Grohl's ready to talk about the album, and more. "This time,"
Grohl says,"I just thought, 'Fuck it.' I got nothin' to lose."
While 1 appreciated the appropriate use of the phrase
"Fuck it" at the time, having now heard the album, 1 recoil.
Why? Because "I got nothin' to lose" happens to be the same
vague approximation of attitude Grohl used to title the Foo's
last album "There Is Nothing Left To Lose;" the repetition
also sums up just how formulaic, predictable and lacking in
originality this otherwise awesome songwriter has become.
Well, yeah, he's still an awesome songwriter. All the four
and-a-half-minute pretty ditties on "One by One" are po
tential hits — they come with earwax-melting melodies and
rampant post-Grunge rifling — yet the album as a whole is
as boring as crap. It packs on the polish, builds up the

promises, gels up on the
angst but never peaks; as a
result, you're always left
waiting fora moment when
the Foos will adapt the for
mula, or, hell, just veer out
of tune.

Still, even though this album lacks the calculated dissonance
of "Stacked Actors" or the sacrificial relish of "Break Out," its
best moments are killer. "All My Life," with its chugging, low
guitars and a knee-jerk chorus, is a perfect opener, and Grohl
actually manages to sound ominous with silly lines like "such a
delicate wrist / what if I give it a twist." Well, almost .
The aggressive rilling of "Have It All," meanwhile, is
promptly substituted with an overcharged, saccharine
Duran-Duran style chorus; it is also a fond reminder of the
goose-bumpy ride of "There Is Nothing Left To Lose."
But the finest moment of the albiun — which occurs on
the low-key "Tired of You" — is also its most unexpected.
Despite the fact that Grohl commits the indiscretion of
rhyming "lire" with "desire," the song retrains from launch
ing into a chorus. Instead, it superimposes sleepy, depress

ing guitars on a "Pennyroyal Tea" style start and makes for
an excellent I-Hum-paper soundtrack.
Most of the other songs, like the fuzzy "Low" and "Over
drive," fail because they don't live up to the angst of their
lyrics. Maybe it's because these Beach-Boyish Foos are a bit
too conscious of their own pop-genius. Or because the songs
are cruelly choked by the lack of atmosphere. In any case,
Grohl isn't punishing his larynx enough ("Monkey
Wrench," anyone?), and the songs bask around in their own
plastic-glory too long ("Come Back" stands at a whopping
eight minutes!) And the lyrics? Blah.
Anyhow, now that I've asserted just how claustrophobic,
consistent and generic the sound is, I can almost hear some
of you cronies saying, "Dave Grohl has to be generic be
cause, cluh, he invented the genre." Sure, I admit that the
Foos last two albums were awesome, and, further, I can for
give them for having become the Def Leppard of Post-
Grunge. I have, after all, granted them three stars. But in
the end that's just a consolation prize for what this album
really is: A collection of vague pre-party anthems for Nir
vana-holies who lost their soul and attitude when that kid
named-Kurt rolled over and died.
