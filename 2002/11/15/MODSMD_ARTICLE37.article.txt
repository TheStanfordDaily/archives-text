# Roxy faces her dirty past

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
This week Ms. Sass takes a respite
from discussing relationships and
delves into even messier territory:
their aftermath. This issue is espe
cially delicate here in the Stanford
bubble where the social landscape is
limited and run-ins (at the CoHo,
Flicks, an SAE party...) seem in
evitable. With that in mind, Roxy
wonders, how does one practice ap
propriate "ex etiquette?"
Granted, the guidelines depend
upon which of the two general
types of break-up took place. If the
split involved one party being hor
ribly and unforgivably wronged,
etiquette varies widely; anything
from total avoidance to criminal
arson could be acceptable. Howev
er, most of us live tamer lives, and
our break-ups fall under the broad
umbrella of amicability.
Maybe the relationship started
out strong in the lonely, house
bound days of winter quarter, but
Fizzled as the enticing summer
loomed ahead. Or maybe you fell

prey to the demon of dormcest and
came to your senses only after the
"dorm couple" label stuck. In cases
like these, you may try to maintain
good relations with an ex.
When dealing with unexpected
run-ins, always, always, always be
friendly; this means no escape tac
tics, even if you look like shit. At a
party or similarly chaotic setting,
you can get away with a quick hug
or arm squeeze and a "Hey, how are
ya?" since chances are he or she
won't be able to hear you anyway.
It's a little more complex if the
run-in occurs in a quieter, more pri
vate setting. In these circumstances,
it's best to rely on simple conversa
tion — one centered on safe topics
like class, mutual friends and dorm
life. For most exes, this will be
enough to keep a casual acquain
tance going pleasantly and will pre
vent your being referred to as "the
bitch who ruined my life."
"Rut Roxy," you ask, "these
guidelines are just fine if my ex is
alone, but what if he / she is with an
other girl / guy, a.k.a. my replace
ment?" Well, dear reader, I must

admit that such a situation can be
tricky if you don't, stick to protocol.
Keep your greeting warm but
brief. Physical contact is discour
aged. If your ex doesn't introduce
you to the new arm candy, intro
duce yourself, and act nice. For
decorum's sake, it's best to wait until
after they leave to consider how
much of a better catch you were.
This etiquette lesson may seem
primitive by Emily Post standards,
but is by no means less vital than any
of the more traditional ones. We will
probably have to deal with an ex at
least one time this month — when
will we ever need to know which is
the proper fork for pheasant?
Ms. Sass believes it is well worth
the extra effort to practice ex eti
quette. If a person merited your
commitment, then why should you
be uncivil afterwards? At best, an ex
is someone who was devoted to you,
someone who knew you intimately
at a certain time in your life. At worst,
he or she is just someone who has
seen you naked. Either way, it Ls
probably in your best interest to
keep those memories sweet.
