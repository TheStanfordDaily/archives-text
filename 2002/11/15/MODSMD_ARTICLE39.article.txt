Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions
To Hold Us Back
1988

Public Enemy's second album, "It
Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us
Back" begins with an odd introduction
from a live appearance in London. As a
British BBC announcer asks the crowd
to "make some noise for Public
Enemy," horns begin to blare in the
background — the air raid sirens of
World War 11. The fact is that "It Takes
A Nation of Millions" was a bomb that
forever changed the terrain of all
music, not just hip hop.
In the years since this album ap
peared, rappers Chuck D, Flavor Flav
and DJ Terminator X have been recog
nized as elder statesmen and pioneers
of hip hop. Despite this, however, they
are often maligned and caricatured as
angry, aimless black militants. Howev
er, while Public Enemy's songs were
frequently angry, the group's social ob
servations were sharp, intelligent and
organized within the greater frame
work of excellent music.
Public Enemy will be remembered
for its message, but "It Takes A Nation
of Millions" is also a superb, tightly ex
ecuted album. It samples from
Funkadelic, Slayer and the Beastie
Boys and invokes Martin Luther King,
Huey Newton, Marcus Garvey and Mal

colm X. While the references tcl Louis
Farrakhan may make iome uncomfort-

able, Chuck I) speaks! fjor m<iny, in
"Bring the Noise" when hie syaysj "Far
rakhan's a prophet that I think you

ought to listen to / What he can say
to you, what you ought to do."
When juxtaposed with much i

of today's popular music,
Chuck D's raps on "Can I ,

Get A Witness" are almost
prescient: "You singers
are spineless / As you sing
your senseless songs to
the mindless / Your gener-

al subject love is minimal / It's
sex for profit." With sharp
and damning critiques of as
pects of the apathetic culture
Public Enemy fought against,
many of the songs on "It
Takes A Nation of Millions"
are seminal hip hop anthems.
The best of these,
"Black Steel In The Hour Of
Chaos" features Chuck D
rapping about breaking out
of a prison over a paranoid
piano loop. It also coined a
phrase for the American jus
tice system ("the anti-nigger
machine") and a refrain
("Death Row / What a brother
knows") that have found
their way into the songs of
countless groups since. For

example, Jurassic 5 recently
sampled "Prophets of Rage"

on its newest album.

Chuck D's distinc-

tive baritone will al-

ways be in-

stant-

ly recognizable and his foil, Flavor Flav,
is a character that will never fade from
memory. "It Takes A Nation of Mil
lions" was the album that put Public
Enemy on the map, but it is also an
album that set a higher standard for
what hip hop could be. While the music
has always had a social conscience,

going back to Run-

Enemy lent its
face and voice
