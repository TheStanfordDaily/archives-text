# University criticizes ASSU living-wage response
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a statement issued yesterday re
sponding to the ASSU's refusal to com
ment on the University's proposed liv
ing-wage guidelines, the administration
both expressed disappointment that the
ASSU did not provide feedback on its
wage guidelines and rejected the ASSU's
request that all stakeholders be involved
in forming University labor policy.
After developing the wage policy in

The statement continued, "We
looked forward to hearing comments
from a variety of individuals and groups,
and we wanted to formally include your
organization in this process."
The statement said that the pro
posed living-wage guidelines were de

living-wage policies already in place in
the city of San Jose, where they said sim

In response to the ASSU's suggestion
fora standing committee on labor issues,
the statement said, "We welcome a meet

and students to discuss all aspects of the
proposed guidelines."
The University also said that workers

labor issues.
"We have deep concerns, however,
