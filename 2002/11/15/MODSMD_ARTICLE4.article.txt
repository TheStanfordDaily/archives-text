# University criticizes ASSU living-wage response
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a statement issued yesterday re
sponding to the ASSU's refusal to com
ment on the University's proposed liv
ing-wage guidelines, the administration
both expressed disappointment that the
ASSU did not provide feedback on its
wage guidelines and rejected the ASSU's
request that all stakeholders be involved
in forming University labor policy.
After developing the wage policy in
ternally earlier this year, the administra
tion requested an official statement on
the policy by the ASSU in early October.

In mid-October, the ASSU and Grad
uate Student Council issued a statement,
approved unanimously by both organi
zations, that they were unable to com
ment on the proposal "as it is our position
that stakeholders should be actively in
volved in University decision-making
rather than incorporated at the end of
such a process."
The ASSU requested that (he ad
ministration make public the data
used to write the wage guidelines and
that the University form a standing
committee to set labor policies that
would include students, faculty, work
ers and administrators.

The response issued yesterday,
written by Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni and Vice President
for Public Affairs Gordon Earle, stated,
"In all honesty, we're disappointed
that you have chosen not to provide
such input [on the proposed living
wage guidelines]."
The statement continued, "We
looked forward to hearing comments
from a variety of individuals and groups,
and we wanted to formally include your
organization in this process."
The statement said that the pro
posed living-wage guidelines were de
veloped after administrators looked at

living-wage policies already in place in
the city of San Jose, where they said sim
ilar cost-of-living and economic condi
tions existed.
In response to the ASSU's suggestion
fora standing committee on labor issues,
the statement said, "We welcome a meet
ing of senior University officials, faculty
and students to discuss all aspects of the
proposed guidelines."
The University also said that workers
have separate means for engagement in
labor issues.
"We have deep concerns, however,
about including employees in the
policy chatting process," the state
ment said. "The University has a col
lective bargaining agreement with its
technical, maintenance and service
employees and regularly meets with
their union leadership to discuss is
sues of mutual interest that arise
under the agreement. We believe
that this is the appropriate forum for
these employees to express their con
cerns and opinions and negotiate
terms of employment."
The response noted that, "We
continue to welcome input from
the .ASSU and CISC leadership as
well as Stanford students in general
on our proposed guidelines. Of
course, it is your right not to pro
vide such input."

The University concluded by
welcoming students to contact them
directly about these issues.
While an oflic iid ASSU response is
forthcoming, ASSU President Moni
ca 1 lenestroza said last night, "We're
also disappointed in their response
because we hoped that they would
take the ASSU statement to substan
tively involve students in the deci
sion-making process. However, we
l(x)k forward to working with the ad
min istration to make sure that stu
dent voice is heard."
She added, "It we're able to
reach an agreement on including
student voice on this issue, it could
set a good precedent for student
representation on other con
tentious issues."
Henestroza also noted that it had
taken the University almost a
month to answer the ASSU state
ment on the guidelines.
"While we understand that the

administration has many other re
sponsibilities, students have contin
ued to ask us about the University's
response." she said
In reply, Earle commented,
"This is a very serious matter, and
we wanted to give [our response]
careful consideration."
He said, "We will continue to
work with the ASSU in the way that
we originally proposed."
The University will continue to
look for opinions from outside of
the administration on the guide
lines before making any final de
cision.
"We do not have a timeline es
tablished at this time, but our next
step is to get input from students,
faculty, and others," Earle said.
"Having had a useful dialogue
tonight [at the Forum on Contem
porary Issues, which focused on the
living-wage guidelines], we look for
ward to moving forward."
