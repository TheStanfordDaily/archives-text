# Law dean rescinds offer to attorney
## Sullivan denies mentorship to controversial lawyer because of political views 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a decision that has polarized stu
dents and caused some to question
whether the Stanford Law School
compromised its educational mission
in the face of public pressure, Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan an
nounced last Friday that she was re
scinding the school's offer of a visiting
mentorship position to New York
criminal defense lawyer Lynne Stew
art, who gained national visibility for
defending Sheikh Omar Abdel Rah
man in his trial following the 1993
World Trade Center bombing.
On Nov. 8, Sullivan released a state
ment saying that she made the decision
to revoke Stewart's title after it had
"come to [her] attention that Ms. Stew
art has expressed sympathy for and
tacit endorsement of the use of direct

eel violence to achieve social change."
In the statement, Sullivan said she had
decided it was "not appropriate" to
make Stewart a David W. Mills Public
Interest Mentor.
Students supportive of Sullivan's de
cision have argued that it is unfitting for
a law school to confer an official position
upon any attorney who has advocated
circumventing the rule of law to achieve
societal change, or in Stewart's case, en
dorsing violence instead of democratic
legal processes. Student opposition to
Stewart has drawn upon a 1995 New
York Times article that quoted her as
saying, "I don't believe in anarchist vio
lence but in directed violence. That
would be violence directed at the insti
tutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism, and at the people
who are the appointed guardians of
those institutions, and accompanied by
popular support."
However, those angered by the de
cision have claimed that Stewart's po
litical views are separate from her
record as a lawyer and that denying
her the right to formally mentor at
Stanford is victimizing her for exercis

ing her right to free speech and bor
ders on censorship.
"I don't agree with her views on po
litical violence — I haven't met a stu
dent who does," said Shahid Buttar, a
third-year law student. "But this is
about her right to speak. Her views
about violence had nothing to do with
her invitation. She was not invited to
speak about her views; she was invited
to speak about her job."
Those critical of Sullivan's decision
have argued that it was based on outside
pressure as opposed to the Law School's
educational principles and that this has
exacerbated the controversy caused by
the decision.
"This all happened behind the
scenes — it was very covert, very insidi
ous," Buttar said. "All we know that
something behind the scenes . . . some
body pulled a string — and that, I think,
is very sick."
"The reason this has proven so divi
sive is because the Law School didn't
have the gumption to stand up to pub
lic interest," he added. "They got sever-
al calls from wealthy alums and
caved in. That's what really
scared me."
Stewart stated, "The real issue
is that the University felt that it
had to do that, and it did do that,
rather than stand up and say
'This person adds a dimension to
[our student body and intellectu
al environment].' In the final
analysis, I think it bodes ill fora
free exchange of ideas on a uni
versity campus."
A week from last Tuesday,
when the student body of the Law
School was notified that Stewart
would be coming to speak, sever
al students independently began
campaigns to prohibit Stewart
from receiving any formal recog
nition by the Law School.
First year law student Elliot
Bladen and second year law stu
dent Carter Ruml, supported by
other students in the Law
School, each independently sent
Sullivan letters detailing why
they felt it was inappropriate for
Stewart to be recognized by the
Law School. Bladen also circu
lated a petition, signed by 64 law
students when it was submitted
to Sullivan, stating that students
were "deeply disturbed" that
Stewart was being recognized as
a public interest mentor.
On the Thursday before Sulli
van's announcement, an article ti
tled "Terror Defendant is Stan
ford 'Mentor' " appeared in
Opinionjournal, an online publi
cation of the Wall Street Journal,
which some students said they be
lieved sparked a campaign by
Law School alumni and donors to
block Stewart's recognition.
A spokesperson for University
President John Hennessy said
that he had no involvement in the
decision. As of 2 p.m. yesterday,
Law School Communications Di
rector Ann Dethlefsen said that

the University had only received
two e-mails from Law School
alumni and two e-mails from un
dergraduate alumni calling for
the University to rescind its invi
tation to Stewart.
Ruml also denied that he or
any others made "any attempt to
contact any big alums or big
donors."
Sullivan's statement said that
Stewart had been invited "with
out full consultation with faculty
and senior administrators." Nei
ther Sullivan nor Eduardo Capu
long, director of public interest
and public policy programs at the
Law School, could be reached for
further comment.
Stewart was invited to serve at
Stanford as a public interest men
tor last July, after she was indicted
in April by the U.S. Department of
Justice on charges that she illegal
ly helped Rahman communicate
with an Egyptian terrorist organi
zation. Stewart denies the charges.
She emphasized that both her
political views and federal indict
ment had made national media
headlines by the time she was in
vited to come and thus ques
tioned whether her political
views in and of themselves were
the reason the Law School re
scinded its invitation for her to
serve as a mentor.
"In my own mind, that's why 1
was invited," she said, calling her
self a "poster girl" for Attorney
General John Ashcroft's new poli
cies that lessen privacy between
attorneys and their clients.
When Stewart arrived in Palo
Alto last Friday, she received a fax
informing her that she was no
longer being offered the position
of mentor.
"The dean did not call me up
and say, 'Let's come in and talk
this over,' " Stewart said. "I was
given a flat out 'get out of town'
kind of thing."
Stewart spoke at the "Shaking
the Foundations" progressive
lawyering conference last week
end and at a Law School event on

Monday. She also came to campus
on Tuesday to mentor students
on an informal basis.
Both Sullivan and students
who supported her decision have
emphasized that they did not
want to prohibit Stewart from
sharing her views with law stu
dents; they just did not want her
to do so with official recognition
from the Law School.
"[We were] in favor of her com
ing in to speak in the open mar
ketplace of ideas," Bladen said.
"We were drawing a distinction
between having your ideas be
censored, which we felt would be
entirely inappropriate. What we
felt, though, was that we didn't
want her to be honored."
Nonetheless, the Law School's
revocation of her formal title an
gered many students involved
with its public interest program
and among the student body as a
whole. Those students have start
ed an e-mail campaign and peti
tion to oppose Sullivan's decision.
"We're a norm-setting institu
tion, and whatever distinction
you make between right to speak
and right to mentor gets lost,"
Buttar said. "And to make that
sort of a statement is really dan
gerous."
Stewart said that her experi
ence last week with law students
was overwhelmingly positive,
but questioned why Sullivan
cited her political ideas to keep
her from mentoring students as
an attorney.
"My mentoring of the students
had to do with my profession; [it]
had nothing to do with my private
political outlook on things," she
said. "I was there to talk as a
lawyer about being indicted as a
lawyer and not about my person
al views," she said.
Buttar emphasized that re
scinding Stewart's position made
it impossible for some law stu
dents to get access to a prominent
attorney in their field of interest.
"She is a criminal defense
lawyer for very unpopular defen

dants, and that's what we wanted
to talk to her about," Buttar said.
"We very much need the chance
to be mentored by her because in
this political climate we're being
victimized now, [and] it's very
hard to hear those voices."
He added, "And it's important
to remember that the students
who were involved in the cam
paign to disinvite Lynne Stewart,
none of them are public interest
students. We're having our agen
da dictated to us."
Ruml argued that, although
those opposing Stewart's mentor
ship were not from the public in
terest program, their affiliation
with the Law School still involves
them in the decision-making
process.
"When the Law School endors
es somebody, we are all part of the
Law School," he said.
Stewart and law students have
also challenged her statements
supporting violence as grounds
for barring her from being ac
cepted as a mentor.
"One could argue that war on
Iraq could be used to [achieve] a
social change objective," Stewart
said, noting that the Law School
has conferred honors upon
those who support war against
Iraq. "I think it is a duplicitous
argument."
"We've not only had people
speak, but we've honored people
who have [openly supported]
state-sponsored violence," Buttar
said, referring to current FBI Di
rector Robert Mueller.
Ruml disagreed that the vio
lence supported by Stewart and
government actors was analo
gous.
"Director Mueller is acting
within the rule of law and is ulti
mately responsible to democrati
cally-elected representatives,
which is a profound difference in
legitimacy between him and sup
porters of direct violence, i.e. ter
rorism, who decide to kill those
who anger them without any re
spect for the rule of law," he said.

racism and sexism, and at the people
who are the appointed guardians of
those institutions, and accompanied by
popular support."
However, those angered by the de
cision have claimed that Stewart's po
litical views are separate from her
record as a lawyer and that denying
her the right to formally mentor at
Stanford is victimizing her for exercis

ing her right to free speech and bor
ders on censorship.
"I don't agree with her views on po
litical violence — I haven't met a stu
dent who does," said Shahid Buttar, a
third-year law student. "But this is
about her right to speak. Her views
about violence had nothing to do with
her invitation. She was not invited to
speak about her views; she was invited
to speak about her job."
Those critical of Sullivan's decision
have argued that it was based on outside
pressure as opposed to the Law School's
educational principles and that this has
exacerbated the controversy caused by
the decision.
"This all happened behind the
scenes — it was very covert, very insidi
ous," Buttar said. "All we know that
something behind the scenes . . . some
body pulled a string — and that, I think,
is very sick."
"The reason this has proven so divi
sive is because the Law School didn't
have the gumption to stand up to pub
lic interest," he added. "They got sever-
al calls from wealthy alums and
caved in. That's what really
scared me."
Stewart stated, "The real issue
is that the University felt that it
had to do that, and it did do that,
rather than stand up and say
'This person adds a dimension to
[our student body and intellectu
al environment].' In the final
analysis, I think it bodes ill fora
free exchange of ideas on a uni
versity campus."
A week from last Tuesday,
when the student body of the Law
School was notified that Stewart
would be coming to speak, sever
al students independently began
campaigns to prohibit Stewart
from receiving any formal recog
nition by the Law School.
First year law student Elliot
Bladen and second year law stu
dent Carter Ruml, supported by
other students in the Law
School, each independently sent
Sullivan letters detailing why
they felt it was inappropriate for
Stewart to be recognized by the
Law School. Bladen also circu
lated a petition, signed by 64 law
students when it was submitted
to Sullivan, stating that students
were "deeply disturbed" that
Stewart was being recognized as
a public interest mentor.
On the Thursday before Sulli
van's announcement, an article ti
tled "Terror Defendant is Stan
ford 'Mentor' " appeared in
Opinionjournal, an online publi
cation of the Wall Street Journal,
which some students said they be
lieved sparked a campaign by
Law School alumni and donors to
block Stewart's recognition.
A spokesperson for University
President John Hennessy said
that he had no involvement in the
decision. As of 2 p.m. yesterday,
Law School Communications Di
rector Ann Dethlefsen said that

the University had only received
two e-mails from Law School
alumni and two e-mails from un
dergraduate alumni calling for
the University to rescind its invi
tation to Stewart.
Ruml also denied that he or
any others made "any attempt to
contact any big alums or big
donors."
Sullivan's statement said that
Stewart had been invited "with
out full consultation with faculty
and senior administrators." Nei
ther Sullivan nor Eduardo Capu
long, director of public interest
and public policy programs at the
Law School, could be reached for
further comment.
Stewart was invited to serve at
Stanford as a public interest men
tor last July, after she was indicted
in April by the U.S. Department of
Justice on charges that she illegal
ly helped Rahman communicate
with an Egyptian terrorist organi
zation. Stewart denies the charges.
She emphasized that both her
political views and federal indict
ment had made national media
headlines by the time she was in
vited to come and thus ques
tioned whether her political
views in and of themselves were
the reason the Law School re
scinded its invitation for her to
serve as a mentor.
"In my own mind, that's why 1
was invited," she said, calling her
self a "poster girl" for Attorney
General John Ashcroft's new poli
cies that lessen privacy between
attorneys and their clients.
When Stewart arrived in Palo
Alto last Friday, she received a fax
informing her that she was no
longer being offered the position
of mentor.
"The dean did not call me up
and say, 'Let's come in and talk
this over,' " Stewart said. "I was
given a flat out 'get out of town'
kind of thing."
Stewart spoke at the "Shaking
the Foundations" progressive
lawyering conference last week
end and at a Law School event on

Monday. She also came to campus
on Tuesday to mentor students
on an informal basis.
Both Sullivan and students
who supported her decision have
emphasized that they did not
want to prohibit Stewart from
sharing her views with law stu
dents; they just did not want her
to do so with official recognition
from the Law School.
"[We were] in favor of her com
ing in to speak in the open mar
ketplace of ideas," Bladen said.
"We were drawing a distinction
between having your ideas be
censored, which we felt would be
entirely inappropriate. What we
felt, though, was that we didn't
want her to be honored."
Nonetheless, the Law School's
revocation of her formal title an
gered many students involved
with its public interest program
and among the student body as a
whole. Those students have start
ed an e-mail campaign and peti
tion to oppose Sullivan's decision.
"We're a norm-setting institu
tion, and whatever distinction
you make between right to speak
and right to mentor gets lost,"
Buttar said. "And to make that
sort of a statement is really dan
gerous."
Stewart said that her experi
ence last week with law students
was overwhelmingly positive,
but questioned why Sullivan
cited her political ideas to keep
her from mentoring students as
an attorney.
"My mentoring of the students
had to do with my profession; [it]
had nothing to do with my private
political outlook on things," she
said. "I was there to talk as a
lawyer about being indicted as a
lawyer and not about my person
al views," she said.
Buttar emphasized that re
scinding Stewart's position made
it impossible for some law stu
dents to get access to a prominent
attorney in their field of interest.
"She is a criminal defense
lawyer for very unpopular defen

dants, and that's what we wanted
to talk to her about," Buttar said.
"We very much need the chance
to be mentored by her because in
this political climate we're being
victimized now, [and] it's very
hard to hear those voices."
He added, "And it's important
to remember that the students
who were involved in the cam
paign to disinvite Lynne Stewart,
none of them are public interest
students. We're having our agen
da dictated to us."
Ruml argued that, although
those opposing Stewart's mentor
ship were not from the public in
terest program, their affiliation
with the Law School still involves
them in the decision-making
process.
"When the Law School endors
es somebody, we are all part of the
Law School," he said.
Stewart and law students have
also challenged her statements
supporting violence as grounds
for barring her from being ac
cepted as a mentor.
"One could argue that war on
Iraq could be used to [achieve] a
social change objective," Stewart
said, noting that the Law School
has conferred honors upon
those who support war against
Iraq. "I think it is a duplicitous
argument."
"We've not only had people
speak, but we've honored people
who have [openly supported]
state-sponsored violence," Buttar
said, referring to current FBI Di
rector Robert Mueller.
Ruml disagreed that the vio
lence supported by Stewart and
government actors was analo
gous.
"Director Mueller is acting
within the rule of law and is ulti
mately responsible to democrati
cally-elected representatives,
which is a profound difference in
legitimacy between him and sup
porters of direct violence, i.e. ter
rorism, who decide to kill those
who anger them without any re
spect for the rule of law," he said.
In a decision that has polarized stu
dents and caused some to question
whether the Stanford Law School
compromised its educational mission
in the face of public pressure, Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan an
nounced last Friday that she was re
scinding the school's offer of a visiting
mentorship position to New York
criminal defense lawyer Lynne Stew
art, who gained national visibility for
defending Sheikh Omar Abdel Rah
man in his trial following the 1993
World Trade Center bombing.
On Nov. 8, Sullivan released a state
ment saying that she made the decision
to revoke Stewart's title after it had
"come to [her] attention that Ms. Stew
art has expressed sympathy for and
tacit endorsement of the use of direct

eel violence to achieve social change."
In the statement, Sullivan said she had
decided it was "not appropriate" to
make Stewart a David W. Mills Public
Interest Mentor.
Students supportive of Sullivan's de
cision have argued that it is unfitting for
a law school to confer an official position
upon any attorney who has advocated
circumventing the rule of law to achieve
societal change, or in Stewart's case, en
dorsing violence instead of democratic
legal processes. Student opposition to
Stewart has drawn upon a 1995 New
York Times article that quoted her as
saying, "I don't believe in anarchist vio
lence but in directed violence. That
would be violence directed at the insti
tutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism, and at the people
who are the appointed guardians of
those institutions, and accompanied by
popular support."
However, those angered by the de
cision have claimed that Stewart's po
litical views are separate from her

Stewart stated, "The real issue
is that the University felt that it
had to do that, and it did do that,
rather than stand up and say
'This person adds a dimension to
[our student body and intellectu
al environment].' In the final
analysis, I think it bodes ill fora
free exchange of ideas on a uni
versity campus."
A week from last Tuesday,
when the student body of the Law
School was notified that Stewart
would be coming to speak, sever
al students independently began
campaigns to prohibit Stewart
from receiving any formal recog
nition by the Law School.
First year law student Elliot
Bladen and second year law stu
dent Carter Ruml, supported by
other students in the Law
School, each independently sent
Sullivan letters detailing why
they felt it was inappropriate for
Stewart to be recognized by the
Law School. Bladen also circu
lated a petition, signed by 64 law
students when it was submitted
to Sullivan, stating that students
were "deeply disturbed" that
Stewart was being recognized as
a public interest mentor.
On the Thursday before Sulli
van's announcement, an article ti
tled "Terror Defendant is Stan
ford 'Mentor' " appeared in
Opinionjournal, an online publi
cation of the Wall Street Journal,
which some students said they be
lieved sparked a campaign by
Law School alumni and donors to
block Stewart's recognition.
A spokesperson for University
President John Hennessy said
that he had no involvement in the
decision. As of 2 p.m. yesterday,
Law School Communications Di
rector Ann Dethlefsen said that

the University had only received
two e-mails from Law School
alumni and two e-mails from un
dergraduate alumni calling for
the University to rescind its invi
tation to Stewart.
Ruml also denied that he or
any others made "any attempt to
contact any big alums or big
donors."
Sullivan's statement said that
Stewart had been invited "with
out full consultation with faculty
and senior administrators." Nei
ther Sullivan nor Eduardo Capu
long, director of public interest
and public policy programs at the
Law School, could be reached for
further comment.
Stewart was invited to serve at
Stanford as a public interest men
tor last July, after she was indicted
in April by the U.S. Department of
Justice on charges that she illegal
ly helped Rahman communicate
with an Egyptian terrorist organi
zation. Stewart denies the charges.
She emphasized that both her
political views and federal indict
ment had made national media
headlines by the time she was in
vited to come and thus ques
tioned whether her political
views in and of themselves were
the reason the Law School re
scinded its invitation for her to
serve as a mentor.
"In my own mind, that's why 1
was invited," she said, calling her
self a "poster girl" for Attorney
General John Ashcroft's new poli
cies that lessen privacy between
attorneys and their clients.
When Stewart arrived in Palo
Alto last Friday, she received a fax
informing her that she was no
longer being offered the position
of mentor.
"The dean did not call me up
and say, 'Let's come in and talk
this over,' " Stewart said. "I was
given a flat out 'get out of town'
kind of thing."
Stewart spoke at the "Shaking
the Foundations" progressive
lawyering conference last week
end and at a Law School event on

Monday. She also came to campus
on Tuesday to mentor students
on an informal basis.
Both Sullivan and students
who supported her decision have
emphasized that they did not
want to prohibit Stewart from
sharing her views with law stu
dents; they just did not want her
to do so with official recognition
from the Law School.
"[We were] in favor of her com
ing in to speak in the open mar
ketplace of ideas," Bladen said.
"We were drawing a distinction
between having your ideas be
censored, which we felt would be
entirely inappropriate. What we
felt, though, was that we didn't
want her to be honored."
Nonetheless, the Law School's
revocation of her formal title an
gered many students involved
with its public interest program
and among the student body as a
whole. Those students have start
ed an e-mail campaign and peti
tion to oppose Sullivan's decision.
"We're a norm-setting institu
tion, and whatever distinction
you make between right to speak
and right to mentor gets lost,"
Buttar said. "And to make that
sort of a statement is really dan
gerous."
Stewart said that her experi
ence last week with law students
was overwhelmingly positive,
but questioned why Sullivan
cited her political ideas to keep
her from mentoring students as
an attorney.
"My mentoring of the students
had to do with my profession; [it]
had nothing to do with my private
political outlook on things," she
said. "I was there to talk as a
lawyer about being indicted as a
lawyer and not about my person
al views," she said.
Buttar emphasized that re
scinding Stewart's position made
it impossible for some law stu
dents to get access to a prominent
attorney in their field of interest.
"She is a criminal defense
lawyer for very unpopular defen

dants, and that's what we wanted
to talk to her about," Buttar said.
"We very much need the chance
to be mentored by her because in
this political climate we're being
victimized now, [and] it's very
hard to hear those voices."
He added, "And it's important
to remember that the students
who were involved in the cam
paign to disinvite Lynne Stewart,
none of them are public interest
students. We're having our agen
da dictated to us."
Ruml argued that, although
those opposing Stewart's mentor
ship were not from the public in
terest program, their affiliation
with the Law School still involves
them in the decision-making
process.
"When the Law School endors
es somebody, we are all part of the
Law School," he said.
Stewart and law students have
also challenged her statements
supporting violence as grounds
for barring her from being ac
cepted as a mentor.
"One could argue that war on
Iraq could be used to [achieve] a
social change objective," Stewart
said, noting that the Law School
has conferred honors upon
those who support war against
Iraq. "I think it is a duplicitous
argument."
"We've not only had people
speak, but we've honored people
who have [openly supported]
state-sponsored violence," Buttar
said, referring to current FBI Di
rector Robert Mueller.
Ruml disagreed that the vio
lence supported by Stewart and
government actors was analo
gous.
"Director Mueller is acting
within the rule of law and is ulti
mately responsible to democrati
cally-elected representatives,
which is a profound difference in
legitimacy between him and sup
porters of direct violence, i.e. ter
rorism, who decide to kill those
who anger them without any re
spect for the rule of law," he said.
In a decision that has polarized stu
dents and caused some to question
whether the Stanford Law School
compromised its educational mission
in the face of public pressure, Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan an
nounced last Friday that she was re
scinding the school's offer of a visiting
mentorship position to New York
criminal defense lawyer Lynne Stew
art, who gained national visibility for
defending Sheikh Omar Abdel Rah
man in his trial following the 1993
World Trade Center bombing.
On Nov. 8, Sullivan released a state
ment saying that she made the decision
to revoke Stewart's title after it had
"come to [her] attention that Ms. Stew
art has expressed sympathy for and
tacit endorsement of the use of direct

eel violence to achieve social change."
In the statement, Sullivan said she had
decided it was "not appropriate" to
make Stewart a David W. Mills Public
Interest Mentor.
Students supportive of Sullivan's de
cision have argued that it is unfitting for
a law school to confer an official position
upon any attorney who has advocated
circumventing the rule of law to achieve
societal change, or in Stewart's case, en
dorsing violence instead of democratic
legal processes. Student opposition to
Stewart has drawn upon a 1995 New
York Times article that quoted her as
saying, "I don't believe in anarchist vio
lence but in directed violence. That
would be violence directed at the insti
tutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism, and at the people
who are the appointed guardians of
those institutions, and accompanied by
popular support."
However, those angered by the de
cision have claimed that Stewart's po
litical views are separate from her
record as a lawyer and that denying
her the right to formally mentor at
Stanford is victimizing her for exercis

ing her right to free speech and bor
ders on censorship.
"I don't agree with her views on po
litical violence — I haven't met a stu
dent who does," said Shahid Buttar, a
third-year law student. "But this is
about her right to speak. Her views
about violence had nothing to do with
her invitation. She was not invited to
speak about her views; she was invited
to speak about her job."
Those critical of Sullivan's decision
have argued that it was based on outside
pressure as opposed to the Law School's
educational principles and that this has
exacerbated the controversy caused by
the decision.
"This all happened behind the
scenes — it was very covert, very insidi
ous," Buttar said. "All we know that
something behind the scenes . . . some
body pulled a string — and that, I think,
is very sick."
"The reason this has proven so divi
sive is because the Law School didn't
have the gumption to stand up to pub
lic interest," he added. "They got sever-
al calls from wealthy alums and
caved in. That's what really
scared me."
Stewart stated, "The real issue
is that the University felt that it
had to do that, and it did do that,
rather than stand up and say
'This person adds a dimension to
[our student body and intellectu
al environment].' In the final
