# Law dean rescinds offer to attorney
## Sullivan denies mentorship to controversial lawyer because of political views 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a decision that has polarized stu
dents and caused some to question
whether the Stanford Law School
compromised its educational mission
in the face of public pressure, Law
School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan an
nounced last Friday that she was re
scinding the school's offer of a visiting
mentorship position to New York
criminal defense lawyer Lynne Stew
art, who gained national visibility for
defending Sheikh Omar Abdel Rah
man in his trial following the 1993
World Trade Center bombing.
On Nov. 8, Sullivan released a state
ment saying that she made the decision
to revoke Stewart's title after it had
"come to [her] attention that Ms. Stew
art has expressed sympathy for and
tacit endorsement of the use of direct

eel violence to achieve social change."
In the statement, Sullivan said she had
decided it was "not appropriate" to
make Stewart a David W. Mills Public
Interest Mentor.
Students supportive of Sullivan's de
cision have argued that it is unfitting for
a law school to confer an official position
upon any attorney who has advocated
circumventing the rule of law to achieve
societal change, or in Stewart's case, en
dorsing violence instead of democratic
legal processes. Student opposition to
Stewart has drawn upon a 1995 New
York Times article that quoted her as
saying, "I don't believe in anarchist vio
lence but in directed violence. That
would be violence directed at the insti
tutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism, and at the people
who are the appointed guardians of
those institutions, and accompanied by
popular support."
However, those angered by the de
cision have claimed that Stewart's po
litical views are separate from her
record as a lawyer and that denying
her the right to formally mentor at
Stanford is victimizing her for exercis

ing her right to free speech and bor
ders on censorship.
"I don't agree with her views on po
litical violence — I haven't met a stu
dent who does," said Shahid Buttar, a
third-year law student. "But this is
about her right to speak. Her views
about violence had nothing to do with
her invitation. She was not invited to
speak about her views; she was invited
to speak about her job."
Those critical of Sullivan's decision
have argued that it was based on outside
pressure as opposed to the Law School's
educational principles and that this has
exacerbated the controversy caused by
the decision.
"This all happened behind the
scenes — it was very covert, very insidi
ous," Buttar said. "All we know that
something behind the scenes . . . some
body pulled a string — and that, I think,
is very sick."
"The reason this has proven so divi
sive is because the Law School didn't
have the gumption to stand up to pub
lic interest," he added. "They got sever-
