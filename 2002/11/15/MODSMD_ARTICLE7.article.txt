### CAMILLE RICKETTS 
Last night, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford sponsored a panel on
environmental justice at the History Cor
ner, featuring four speakers who had at
tended the People of Color Environmen
tal justice Summit at the end of October in
Washington, D.C. The panelists spoke
passionately about their experiences at the
summit and engaged the audience with
discussion and anecdotes about both local
and global environmental justice issues.
The term "environmental justice" was
lirst coined in 1992 at the first Washing
ton, D.C. summit as "the notion that all
people, regardless of race, class, gender
and sexuality, have the right to live, work
and play in a safe environment," said Car
oline Picker, one of the summit coordina
tors. After learning more about this blend
of social and environmental advocacy,
SEAS adapted its mission statement to at

tack environmental injustices in the Bay
Area and around the world.
Yesterday's panel addressed issues
such as war as a form of racism; the influ
ence of Silicon Valley industry on East
Palo Alto; environmental injustice in
labor issues; and the importance of youth
organization in community and ecologi
cal causes.
"Hopefully, this panel will promote
SEAS's campaign to discuss war as an en
vironmental injustice," Picker said. "The
issue seems very pertinent right now relat
ing environmental justice to what many
other campus activists are involved in."
The first speaker, junior Kellea Miller,
discussed her specific interest in injustice
on Native American reservations and
being involved in the movement as a Cau
casian, referring to herself as a "white ally."
"It's shocking how much is going on
that we don't even know about," said
Miller, who used her speech to call atten

tion to the Indian Health Service's alleged
sterilization of Native American women
after they give birth. According to Miller,
the goal of the procedure was to weaken
the population and therefore the resis
tance to demands for natural resources on
Native American land.
"Even it it's not a personal thing," Miller
said in reference to her ethnic identity, "I
realize that it is so important to discuss it.
Since the summit, I have a dire need to get
involved and tell everyone I know how I
feel about it."
Aimee Suzara of the Filipino-Ameri
can Coalition for Environmental Solu
tions followed Miller. Placing the issue of
environmental justice on a global stage,
Suzara described the effects of toxic
waste residue leaking from vacated
American army bases in the Philippines.
Suzara said that toxic substances such as
