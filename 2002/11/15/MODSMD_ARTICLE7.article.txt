# Talk decries environmental injustice

### CAMILLE RICKETTS 
Last night, Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford sponsored a panel on
environmental justice at the History Cor
ner, featuring four speakers who had at
tended the People of Color Environmen
tal justice Summit at the end of October in
Washington, D.C. The panelists spoke
passionately about their experiences at the
summit and engaged the audience with
discussion and anecdotes about both local
and global environmental justice issues.
The term "environmental justice" was
lirst coined in 1992 at the first Washing
ton, D.C. summit as "the notion that all
people, regardless of race, class, gender
and sexuality, have the right to live, work
and play in a safe environment," said Car
oline Picker, one of the summit coordina
tors. After learning more about this blend
of social and environmental advocacy,
SEAS adapted its mission statement to at

tack environmental injustices in the Bay
Area and around the world.
Yesterday's panel addressed issues
such as war as a form of racism; the influ
ence of Silicon Valley industry on East
Palo Alto; environmental injustice in
labor issues; and the importance of youth
organization in community and ecologi
cal causes.
"Hopefully, this panel will promote
SEAS's campaign to discuss war as an en
vironmental injustice," Picker said. "The
issue seems very pertinent right now relat
ing environmental justice to what many
other campus activists are involved in."
The first speaker, junior Kellea Miller,
discussed her specific interest in injustice
on Native American reservations and
being involved in the movement as a Cau
casian, referring to herself as a "white ally."
"It's shocking how much is going on
that we don't even know about," said
Miller, who used her speech to call atten

tion to the Indian Health Service's alleged
sterilization of Native American women
after they give birth. According to Miller,
the goal of the procedure was to weaken
the population and therefore the resis
tance to demands for natural resources on
Native American land.
"Even it it's not a personal thing," Miller
said in reference to her ethnic identity, "I
realize that it is so important to discuss it.
Since the summit, I have a dire need to get
involved and tell everyone I know how I
feel about it."
Aimee Suzara of the Filipino-Ameri
can Coalition for Environmental Solu
tions followed Miller. Placing the issue of
environmental justice on a global stage,
Suzara described the effects of toxic
waste residue leaking from vacated
American army bases in the Philippines.
Suzara said that toxic substances such as
benzene have seeped into several
communities' water supplies and
have caused diseases ranging from
leukemia to diabetes, as well as
over 100 deaths.
Both the Filipino and American
governments have been unsup
portive in solving the problem, said
Suzara, who is currendy part of a
team bringing a lawsuit against the
American government that she
hopes will lead to U.S.-funded
cleanup of die hazardous waste.
"Cleaning up these sites will be
very expensive. The people in
these communities are very poor
and do not have the resources
they need," Suzara said, noting
that the American government
wants to avoid the claims in order
to save money.
The next panelist, Sergio Gon
zales, a youth organizer from
Youth United for Community Ac
tion (YUCA), applied environmen
tal justice to East Palo Alto, where
he attends high school and witness
es the direct effects Silicon Valley
industry has on his community. He
focused on the issues of labor and
youth activism.
Gonzales said that he definitely
sees his area victimized by environ
mental injustice, particularly be
cause it is home to lower income
families and many minority groups.
Many East Palo Alto citizens suffer
from increased pollution and occu
pational discrimination due to near
by industry, he added.
As a YUCA leader, Gonzales
leads what he calls "toxic tours,"
during which he and his classmates
lead concerned citizens through
polluted areas of the city and in
form them of the origins of and
possible solutions for environmen
tal hazards.
To emphasize his point, Gonza
les gave an account of a man from
his community who was working in
Silicon Valley on a job that re

quired him to be submerged in a
tank of chemicals for small inter
vals of time. On one occasion, while
submerged, his manager neglect
ed to raise him out of the tank, and
the worker, overexposed and as
phyxiated by the chemicals, suf
fered debilitating brain damage.
According to Gonzales, the compa
ny took advantage of the worker's
low-income status and awarded
him only $6,000 in workers' com
pensation, not nearly enough to
cover his family's expenses.
"ft is situations like these that
make it necessary for us, as kids who
see it happen all the time, to orga
nize and work to do something
about it," Gonzales said.
The final panel speaker, Ajamu
Kitwana, a Stanford graduate in
civil and environmental engineer
ing, shifted attention to the recent
Bay Area Environmental Justice
Water Summit and described the
conference's focus and its larger im
plications.
The Environmental Justice
Coalition for Water is a statewide
network that ensures that water
policy and regulation acknowledge
the problems faced by low-income
and minority communities
throughout California. The coali
tion played a large role in the sum
mit Kitwana attended, where it
planned to kick off a campaign to
fight environmental injustice con
cerning water in urban areas.
By calling these varied issues to
the forefront, SEAS hopes to en
courage more students and com
munity members to increase both
their environmental and social
awareness. The panel, which drew a
healthy turnout, was the first of the
organization's events to facilitate
this awareness and involvement.
"Environmental justice succeeds
by connecting environmentalism to
the people," said Sabrina Eernan
des, one of the summit coordina
tors. "No activist issue is isolated,
and 1 think environmental justice is
the epitome of activism toward find
ing solutions to all kinds of social
problems."
