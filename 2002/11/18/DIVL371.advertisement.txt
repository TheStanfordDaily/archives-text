Rodney Merrill's
translation of Homer's
The Odyssey
Monday, November 18,2002 • 7pm
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
The Odyssey is one of the great
est poems in world literature, and
its basic story, the homecoming of
Odysseus, is widely known.
Though it has often been translat
ed, most earlier or contemporary
versions do not even attempt
to give the reader a sense of its
original character as an oral epic,
really a song which came into
being during a long tradition of
performances by singers who
lived before writing was widely
known or practiced. Then when it
was finally written down, it
retained this oral-formulaic char
acter in ways which are clearly
discernible, and which this trans
lation tries to capture. By read
ing this version-especially aloud,
as the translator recommends
readers will gain many fresh
insights into the greatness of the
singer we call Homer and of his
song about the difficult return to
his native country of one of the
most famous characters of all
time.
