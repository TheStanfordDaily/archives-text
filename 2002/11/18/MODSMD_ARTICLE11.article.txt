## N. Korea claims nuke 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
North Korea's state-run radio re
ported for the first time yesterday
that the communist country has
nuclear weapons, but South Kore
an officials doubted the credibility
of the report.
Pyongyang Radio reported in a
Korean-language report that the
country "has come to have nuclear
and other strong military weapons
due to nuclear threats by U.S. im
perialists," according to South
Korea's Yonhap news agency,
which monitors broadcasts from
the North.
Some took the report as the
North's first confirmation of pos
session of nuclear weapons. Until
now, North Korea had claimed
that it was "entitled to have nu
clear weapons and more power
fill weapons than that to protect
its sovereignty from U.S.
threats."
But today, South Korean offi
cials were skeptical that the report
represented a change in North
Korea's official position on nuclear
weapons, which has been to nei
ther confirm nor deny that the
country has them.

"It's too early to say whether
North Korea's official position on
its nuclear issue has changed,"
said Choi Young-joon, a chief an
alyst at South Korea's Unification
Ministry.
"In North Korea, such a report
should follow an official govern
ment statement or policy an
nouncement or comments by a top
official," he said.
Yonhap played down the sig
nificance of the report carried by
Pyongyang Radio, which is meant
chiefly for the South Korean audi
ence. No other Northern media,
including its English-language for
eign news outlet, the Korean Cen
tral News Agency, carried it.
"Also, it was a one-time report
and was not repeated," Yonhap
said.
Yonhap said it was likely that
the news anchor made a mistake
or that the North was deliberately
trying to create confusion.
In the report, North Korea ac
cused the United States of trying to
isolate it from the world by claim
ing that the communist country
had broken nuclear arms control
agreements.
