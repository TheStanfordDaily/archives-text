## The 						Stanford Daily Eve Ensler's message proves relevant to Stanford 
### 
Published Since 1891

When Eve Ensler, author of "The
Vagina Monologues," spoke at
Kresge Auditorium on Friday
night, she praised the Stanford community
fora "vagina-friendly" campus committed
to empowering women. We share Ensler's
admiration tor the campus groups that sup
port women's issues â€” from the Women's
Center, the Campus Sexual Assault Re
sponse and Recovery Team and 5-SURE
(SURE stands for Stanford United for Rape
Elimination) to the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
which brought Ensler to campus.
We believe that Ensler's speech, which
focused on her campaign to end violence
against women on a global scale, pertains
to Stanford's community as well.

Since 1996, there have been seven al
leged rapes reported to the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety and 74 alleged
forcible sexual assaults reported to campus
counselors, according to campus statistics.
However, the Bridge fields only one or two
calls each quarter related to sexual assault,
and the number of students who report
such incidents to the Campus Sexual As
sault Response and Recovery 1 earn is much
higher, according to a Bridge counselor.
Why the disparity between calls to the
Bridge and reported incidents? One rea
son is that many victims avoid reporting
such crimes to police.
According to Counseling and Psycho
logical Services, a 1993 Health Needs As

sessment survey found that within their
lifetimes, 27 percent of undergraduate and
33 percent of graduate Stanford women
had experienced unwanted sexual activity
involving continual arguments and pres
sure, drugs and alcohol, or the threat or
use of physical force.
Although two-thirds of these women
talked to someone about their experi
ence, only 14 percent sought counsel
ing, and just 2 percent reported the in
cidents to the police.
The stigma attached to reporting sexual
assault and rape incidents is not limited to
Stanford's campus. In 2001, about two
thirds of rapes and sexual assaults went un
reported, according to the Bureau of Justice

Statistics. We find these numbers disturbing
and hope that awareness and empowerment
can begin to reverse the trend of silence.
On Stanford's campus, in particular,
women should know that there are many
resources available to promote safety,
from the 5-SURE escort service to the
anonymous, 24-hour CAPS Sexual As
sault and Sexual Harassment Line.
Even on a campus that is praised by a
well-known women's rights activist, no
body is immune to crimes like sexual as
sault and rape. We believe that students
should be informed and educated about
their rights regarding these issues and
should feel comfortable taking advantage
of the available resources if necessary.
