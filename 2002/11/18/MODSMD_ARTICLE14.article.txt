# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Ghosts of Bio 44Y 
### 
In the spirit of good Halloween fun, I
went and saw "The Ring" on Oct.
31st and proceeded to scare the liv
ing shih-tzu out of myself every time I saw
a television set for the next three hours. I
feel like I got my seven bucks' worth.
Ah, I remember a time when I'd be
feeling the effects of a horror movie for
the next week, if not more. I couldn't look
at a mirror fora month after Poltergeist 3.

Now, I'm so desensitized
that it takes bigger and
bigger thrills to make me
jump at shadows. While
watching "The King," I
admit I had to squeeze
my neighbor's hand
through the scary parts
(and I distinctly remem
ber whispering "oh god,

oh god, oh god," to myself when that kid
says THAT LINE), but it didn't keep me
up that night. (The mass quantity of
sugar I consumed in the form of straw
berry Icee did.)
It's so sad and funny, funny and sad
how when we're little, we make up
ghosts to scare ourselves, but when
we're grown up, we don't need to. Be
cause then the real ghosts take over.
What haunts you? What keeps you up)
at night now that you're not afraid of
the dark anymore?
Early in spring quarter of my ju
nior year, I dropped out of Bio 44Y,
and thus out of being pre-med. It was
the night before the first lab report
was due (it was the trophic cascades
one — you try counting bugs under a
clunky old microscope and see how
excited you are about ecology).
I said to myself, "Do I want to be a
doctor so much that I would spend
three hours writing that my data may
be skewed because I couldn't tell the
difference between Chironomidae
and Culicidae?"
So there I am, one class from finish
ing my pre-med requirements (well, not
to mention five or six science GPA points
from the national average), and I quit.
I had already switched into feminist
studies during the winter of my sopho
more year, but up until then, I'd had
that safety net. You know, when people
would ask me what my major is, I would
say, "Fem studies. But I'm also pre
med." Then they would smile and nod,
thinking to themselves "Ah, what a
clever little Stanford student. Socially
conscious AND academically rigorous."
It just don't sound as cool to say, "I'm
a feminist studies major — but I USED
to be pre-med." Uh huh. Whatever.
Couldn't cut it, could ya? Ran away from
those tough sciencey classes into the
fuzzy-wuzzy arms of your girls club, eh?
Now, I will be the first person to de

fend fem studies. We work our asses off.
We don't just sit around talking about
our feelings (although we do believe that
personal experience is a valid founda
tion for the intellect). We're in the busi
ness of changing the world. And it takes
a crapload of courage to do FS or CSRE
or Studio Art when everyone and his
dog is majoring in econ and hum bio.
But there's always this little voice in
my head telling me that I'm a punk, I'm
a wussy, I'm a quitter, I chickened out.
That I quit pre-med not because I had
found my passion elsewhere, but be
cause I wasn't smart enough. That a true
Stanford student would have toughed it
out. That now I'll never get a paying job.
That I screwed it up big time, and I can
never go back.
And it haunts me. It haunts me to
the core.
What did I give up when I went on
Axess and pressed that little button,
"DROP THIS CLASS"? The worst is
they give you the dialog box that says,
"Are you sure?" Well, when was 1 ever
going to be sure? I had slaved and suf
fered through the biocore and
through Chem 135, and I couldn't be
bothered to write a stupid lab report?
What was I thinking?
All I can say in my defense is that I
just knew it. I knew it in my heart,
knew that this doctor stuff just wasn't
for me. Not that I wasn't smart
enough, not that I wasn't tough
enough, but I looked down that long,
dark path to an M.D. and said to my
self, "No." No more biology classes that
I hate. No more trying to reduce my
self to a medical school application. No
48-hour shifts as an intern. No heart
break the first time one of my patients
dies. No. None of it. Enough.
It was the easiest and the hardest de
cision of my life.
That's why I feel so old, I guess. The
byline is "21 and Still Clueless," mean
ing I think I should have things fig
ured out by now, but I don't. I feel like
I'm too old to jump and scream at
scary movies, but I'm way too young to
have my own ghosts already.
Is this what the real ghosts are made
of? Decisions we made in the distant
past, the consequences of which we re
gret even now? The longing for what
might have been? The chances we
missed, the train that left us on the
platform, the choice that ruled out all
other choices, the time we wanted to
say "Come back to me; 1 love you," but
we couldn't. We just couldn't. So we let
them walk away.
Scary stuff. Sleep tight tonight.

Now, I will be the first person to de

fend fem studies. We work our asses off.
We don't just sit around talking about
our feelings (although we do believe that
personal experience is a valid founda
tion for the intellect). We're in the busi
ness of changing the world. And it takes
a crapload of courage to do FS or CSRE
or Studio Art when everyone and his
dog is majoring in econ and hum bio.
But there's always this little voice in
my head telling me that I'm a punk, I'm
a wussy, I'm a quitter, I chickened out.
That I quit pre-med not because I had
found my passion elsewhere, but be
cause I wasn't smart enough. That a true
Stanford student would have toughed it
out. That now I'll never get a paying job.
That I screwed it up big time, and I can
never go back.
And it haunts me. It haunts me to
the core.
What did I give up when I went on
Axess and pressed that little button,
"DROP THIS CLASS"? The worst is
they give you the dialog box that says,
"Are you sure?" Well, when was 1 ever
going to be sure? I had slaved and suf
fered through the biocore and
through Chem 135, and I couldn't be
bothered to write a stupid lab report?
What was I thinking?
All I can say in my defense is that I
just knew it. I knew it in my heart,
knew that this doctor stuff just wasn't
for me. Not that I wasn't smart
enough, not that I wasn't tough
enough, but I looked down that long,
dark path to an M.D. and said to my
self, "No." No more biology classes that
I hate. No more trying to reduce my
self to a medical school application. No
48-hour shifts as an intern. No heart
break the first time one of my patients
dies. No. None of it. Enough.
It was the easiest and the hardest de
cision of my life.
That's why I feel so old, I guess. The
byline is "21 and Still Clueless," mean
ing I think I should have things fig
ured out by now, but I don't. I feel like
I'm too old to jump and scream at
scary movies, but I'm way too young to
have my own ghosts already.
Is this what the real ghosts are made
of? Decisions we made in the distant
past, the consequences of which we re
gret even now? The longing for what
might have been? The chances we
missed, the train that left us on the
platform, the choice that ruled out all
other choices, the time we wanted to
say "Come back to me; 1 love you," but
we couldn't. We just couldn't. So we let
them walk away.
Scary stuff. Sleep tight tonight.

In the spirit of good Halloween fun, I
went and saw "The Ring" on Oct.
31st and proceeded to scare the liv
ing shih-tzu out of myself every time I saw
a television set for the next three hours. I
feel like I got my seven bucks' worth.
Ah, I remember a time when I'd be
feeling the effects of a horror movie for
the next week, if not more. I couldn't look
at a mirror fora month after Poltergeist 3.

Now, I'm so desensitized
that it takes bigger and
bigger thrills to make me
jump at shadows. While
watching "The King," I
admit I had to squeeze
my neighbor's hand
through the scary parts
(and I distinctly remem
ber whispering "oh god,

oh god, oh god," to myself when that kid
says THAT LINE), but it didn't keep me
up that night. (The mass quantity of
sugar I consumed in the form of straw
berry Icee did.)
It's so sad and funny, funny and sad
how when we're little, we make up
ghosts to scare ourselves, but when
we're grown up, we don't need to. Be
cause then the real ghosts take over.
What haunts you? What keeps you up)
at night now that you're not afraid of
the dark anymore?
Early in spring quarter of my ju
nior year, I dropped out of Bio 44Y,
and thus out of being pre-med. It was
the night before the first lab report
was due (it was the trophic cascades
one — you try counting bugs under a
clunky old microscope and see how
excited you are about ecology).
I said to myself, "Do I want to be a
doctor so much that I would spend
three hours writing that my data may
be skewed because I couldn't tell the
difference between Chironomidae
and Culicidae?"
So there I am, one class from finish
ing my pre-med requirements (well, not
to mention five or six science GPA points
from the national average), and I quit.
I had already switched into feminist
studies during the winter of my sopho
more year, but up until then, I'd had
that safety net. You know, when people
would ask me what my major is, I would
say, "Fem studies. But I'm also pre
med." Then they would smile and nod,
thinking to themselves "Ah, what a
clever little Stanford student. Socially
conscious AND academically rigorous."
It just don't sound as cool to say, "I'm
a feminist studies major — but I USED
to be pre-med." Uh huh. Whatever.
Couldn't cut it, could ya? Ran away from
those tough sciencey classes into the
fuzzy-wuzzy arms of your girls club, eh?
Now, I will be the first person to de

fend fem studies. We work our asses off.
We don't just sit around talking about
