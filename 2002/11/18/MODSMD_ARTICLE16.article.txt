Revised policy 'does not prohibit
consensual sexual relationships'
I would like to address a misimpression
that may have been gained by readers of
I lias Chrissochoidis' opinion piece ("Frus
trated grad student resents new sexual ha
rassment policy," Nov. 11).
The revised consensual relationship
portion of Stanford's sexual harassment
policy does not prohibit consensual sexual
relationships between individuals in posi
tions of unequal power within the Univer
sity. Indeed, with one exception, it does
not state that such relationships in general
are discouraged by the University.
Instead, the policy notes the risks in
herent in these relationships, such as the
potential for conflict of interest, exploita
tion, favoritism and bias. For this reason
the policy states that the person in the
position of greater power will bear the
primary burden of accountability, and
must ensure that he or she does not ex
ercise any supervisory or evaluative
function over the other person in the re
lationship. Where such recusal is re
quired, the recusing party is also re
quired to notify his or her supervisor,
department chair or dean, so that the ad
equacy of the alternative supervisory or
evaluative arrangements put into place
can be assessed.
There is, however, a special note in the
policy concerning the unique role of a
teacher with regard to students at the Uni
versity. Consensual sexual or romantic re
lationships between teachers and students
are explicitly discouraged because — in
addition to the problems previously noted
— they are inconsistent with the proper
role of the teacher and can result in di
minishing the teacher's potential to serve
as a mentor, counselor and adviser. This is
the case whether or not the teacher is ex

ercising any supervisory or evaluative
function. Additionally, such consensual
sexual or romantic relationships can dif
ferentially affect the experience of others
in the academic setting.
We encourage members of the Stan
ford community to become acquainted
with the changes in Stanford's sexual ha
rassment policy, and contact our office
with any questions that they may have.

Treatment of Stewart was 'hurtful
and shameful'
I write in response to your article on
the heated controversy last week at the
Law School surrounding attorney Lynne
Stewart's invitation to serve law students
as a David M. Mills Public Interest Men
tor ("Law dean rescinds offer to attor
ney," Nov. 15). Il seems to me that there
are actually two issues to be addressed
here, not one.
The first concerns whether the Law
School should have invited someone to
serve as a public interest mentor who, to
borrow from Dean Kathleen M. Sulli
van's words, "has expressed sympathy
for and tacit endorsement of the use of di
rected violence to achieve social change."
The second issue, and one that has un
fortunately not received as much atten
tion, concerns whether the Law School
acted properly in rescinding Ms. Stew
art's title and the honorarium that came
with it after Ms. Stewart had already ar
rived on campus.
Conservative students at the Law
School argue that it would be unfitting for
a law school to confer an official title upon
an attorney who advocates circumventing

the rule of law to achieve social change. As
a liberal student, I agree that this is an
issue that deserves debate, and the posi
tion we take on as a community is an im
portant one. But it is the second issue that
concerns me here. Whether or not Stan
ford should have rescinded Stewart's title
after she arrived on campus seems to me
to be a question with more of a clear an
swer, and I would hope that this latter
issue is not one that needs to be debated.
Simply put, the way in which Stewart was
treated by our administration once she ar
rived at Stanford was hurtful and shame
ful. Rather than notifying Stewart of Stan
ford's decision personally, the dean of the
Law School sent a fax to Stewart's hotel
room informing her that her title of David
M. Mills Public Interest Mentor, and the
monetary honorarium that comes with it,
would be rescinded.
Whether someone should be invited to
Stanford in the first place is a separate
issue from whether that person deserves
to be treated with decency and respect by
our administrators once they have arrived
on campus.
I hope that students on both ends of the
political spectrum will agree that the
method by which Stewart's title was re
scinded reflects poorly on the Law School
and on Stanford University as an educa
tional institution.
It was simply wrong for the Law
School to take away Stewart's title and
honorarium "after the fact." In the fu
ture, the burden should fall on those
who believe that controversial figures
should not be officially recognized by the
Law School to do their research on these
people's views before, and not after,
inviting them to campus.
