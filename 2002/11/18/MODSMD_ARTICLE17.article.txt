## Bush administration must understand the roots of terrorism 
### PAUL EHRLICH GUEST COLUMNIST 
Perhaps the greatest mistake of the
Bush administration lias been its utter
failure to take any steps to reduce the lac -
tors that inspire terrorists to attack us.
One factor, of course, is rich-world at
tempts to control oil llows, as exempli
fied most recently by Bush's apparent
plans to take control of Iraq's vast
petroleum reserves. ()il also explains the
presence of American troops in Saudi
Arabia, which enrages some Muslims, es
pecially Osama bin Laden. But demo
graphic and socioeconomic factors — es
pecially poverty, inequality and large
numbers of young men fac ing dim eco
nomic prospects — also are likely con
tributors to such terrorism.
I he United States and its allies have
responded to the heinous attacks of
Sept. 1 I with a short-term campaign fo
cused on the necessary but insufficient
task of bringing the perpetrators to jus
tice. It did not respond by instituting a
sane energy policy emphasizing con
servation and renewable sources. I hat
would have undoubtedly reduced the
threat of terrorism, but it would also
have menaced America's love affair
with gas-guzzling SUV's.
But oil geopolitics alone can't explain
the atrocity of the Sept. I I attacks. Sadly,
an integrated framework that explains
the origins of terrorism in general, and
terrorism against the West based in Is
lamic- fundamentalism in particular, is
still lacking. For instance, why Arab na
tions have not maintained the enormous
cultural and economic lead they once en
joyed over the Christian West is poorly
understood. It seems unlikely that cul
tural disappointment over these long
term trends would make Muslims more
prone to terrorism than any other mili

tarily impotent group. The persistence
of non-democratic governments in Mus
lim nations certainly might help gener
ate resentment against the West to the
degree that Western intervention in aid
of corrupt, autocratic rulers is perceived
as a factor.
In the Nov. issue of Population and
Knvironment, Jianguo "Jack" Liu of
Michigan State University and I define
Sept. I I-type terrorism as actions car
ried out by militarily weak sub- or
trans-national groups from developing
nations to gain political ends through
violence against private citizens or pub
lic property of militarily powerful de
veloped nations.
Certain persistent socioeconomic and
demographic factors seem to help create
ibis kind of terrorism and make it easier
to recruit terrorists, but the Bush admin
istration seems not to recognize these
factors, and the press all too often ig
nores them. Widespread poverty is obvi
ously one of the most important, espe
cially because of the severely unequal
distribution of wealth between and with
in nations. Others include a lack of gen
der equity; substandard public health,
education and communication capabili
ties; and frequent exposure to violence.
In our report, Liu and I examined so
cial indicators in a sample of developing
countries that seem likely sources of ter
rorists, the majority of which contained
substantial Muslim populations. On av
erage, a substantial gap in all of those in
dicators was found between the poor
countries and a sample of developed na
tions, with only a very few overlaps.
We concluded that, at the very least,
these factors can be important to the mo
tivations and recruitment of terrorists,
even when those terrorists are relatively
prosperous and well educated individu
als as were the Sept. 11 Saudis and

Osama bin Laden himself. I he soc ioeco
nomic and political conditions in their
nations provided a good basis for both
moral indignation and grassroots sup
port. And sadly, what projections c an be
made give little hope that this salient set
of socioeconomic differences between
the developing and developed nations in
our sample will be substantially reduced
in the near future.
For example, population growth
projections indicate that the economies
of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan
and Egypt will need to grow by about
100 percent, 75 percent, 70 percent
and 40 percent, respectively, in the
next quarter century just to keep per
capita purchasing power from falling.
Furthermore, the very strictness of reli
gious fundamentalism makes many
people in these countries extremely re
sistant to change and promotes a will
ingness to die for beliefs.
The vast majority of terrorists are
young adult males. This is hardly sur
prising; after all, most violent anti-social
behavior is generated by young men,
often unemployed or underemployed.
In the first half of this century, the
proportion of young men in developing
nations will continue to be substantially
larger than in developed countries.
Huge numbers of boys now under 15,
many in Muslim nations acquiring a ha
tred for the United States, will soon enter
their high-crime years; and the effects of
this young population will persist. Job
opportunities for the disproportionate
numbers of young men in poor
economies are relatively scarce now. But
high population growth rates are expec t
ed to continue in many developing na
tions, and in the face of that growth, job
opportunities may become much rarer.
Many believe population growth itself
now retards development, widening the

rich-poor gap and increasing the distress
to those left behind.
Why, then, have many countries (e.g.,
in I .atin America) sharing some socioeco
nomic and demographic conditions with
the countries in our sample not generat
ed the same sort of terrorist threats
against the rich countries as have origi
nated in the Middle East?
One answer might be that the United
States' exceptional support of Israel cou
pled with its oil profligacy as a clear sin
gle-resource root of policies have served
as triggers in the Middle East but not in
other regions. The active suppression by
national governments of guerrilla move
ments such as the Shining Path in Peru is
probably significant as well.
I am convinced that the prudent
course for the United States and other
rich nations is to work to ameliorate so
cial and economic rich-poor disparities
while trying to unravel the complex root
causes of terrorism. After all, we would
reap many other benefits from improv
ing conditions in developing nations
even if t he ef forts did not significantly re
duce terrorism.
The United States should play a cen
tral role in improving demographic
and socioeconomic conditions in devel
oping nations. It is one of the stingiest
rich nations in terms of development
assistance — ranking 15th by donating
only one-tenth of 1 percent of its gross
national product.
Without dramatic action, however,
the demographic and socioeconomic
conditions that prevail in much of the
world will help provide a substrate on
which 9/11-type terrorism can thrive
into the foreseeable future. Exacerbat
ing terrorist tendencies are policies of
the developed nations designed to ex
pand their consumption and maintain
their access to natural resources in less

developed regions — including waging
war on anyone who we decide might
impede the flow of oil into American
SUV's and dollars into the pockets of
George Bush's friends.
The United States and other rich na
tions should then move as rapidly as
possible toward an energy-efficient
economy that works to minimize de
pendence on oil (and coal), while
putting much more effort into limiting
wasteful resource consumption and
closing the rich-poor gap. In the pro
cess, tfie rich could create brand new
markets for the outputs of the new
economy and speed the reduction of
their own population sizes to more sat
isfactory and sustainable levels while
helping to protect the environment.
The United States also could increase
its pathetic level of foreign aid and care
fully target that aid on, for example, in
creasing employment and lowering fer
tility rates in developing countries. Aid to
develop labor-intensive enterprises and
lo education, particularly of women, are
two examples.
T his effort will require innovation, care
and tough diplomacy, and will not happen
overnight. That is all the more reason for
announcing our good intentions and
changing our attitudes right now.
