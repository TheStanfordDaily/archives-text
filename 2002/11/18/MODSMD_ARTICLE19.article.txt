# Hillel to move into new campus home
## 
### SEAN VOIGT 
Synonymous with fraternity par
tics, co-ops and herds of frosh mi
grating through it every Friday and
Saturday night, May field Ave. is a
bristling hub of campus social activi
ty. Yet one house, 565 Mayfield, in a
prime location where the red cups
are strewn and the Marguerite pass
es every 15 minutes, stands silent.
In the spring of 2001,1 lillel, the
Center for Jewish Life at Stanford,
purchased the lease for this building
from Stanford University. It took
over six years, intensive fitndraising,
and $5 million, but now Hillel is
ready to start turning this historic
site into The I larold and Libby Ziff
Center for Jewish Life. And it has
started with the small things.
The building's tall, imposing
columns are cracked and faded. I he
once-white facade is nowadingy gray
and die dark green shutters, commis
sioned over a 100, were meant to im
itate Boston architecture at a time
when the East and West Coasts still
seemed insurmountably distant.
And yet, before (his silent house,
with its impossibly overgrown gar
den, its weeds, and a yellow lawn
that hasn't been tended in years,
meticulously maintained rose bush
es flower in pinks, reds and white.
Recently pruned, in full bloom, they
are symbolic of the potential for re
newal latent in this seemingly dilap
idated house.
"We've been tending the
roses . . . since the last resident
passed away," said Debra Stein, ex
ecutive director of 1 lillel, referring to
the bushes that have grown in front
of 565 since 1899. "We're committed
to the history of that building."
When planning and construc
tion of the Ziff Center for Jewish Life
are complete, the building will
house a library along with meeting
rooms, seminar rooms, and class
rooms, which will provide for intel
lectual stimulation.
Elsewhere, a reception hall,
lounge, worship spaces and quiet

meditative areas will augment the
social and spiritual identity of the
center. Besides an auditorium, a
landscaped courtyard and an up
scale cafe, the Ziff Center for Jewish
Life will also provide Stanford's 112 irst
kosher dining hall.
"The Ziff Center will become a
spacious, warm and welcoming
home for the campus Jewish com
munity," Stein said. "It will be a
powerful physical presence for the
Jewish community at Stanford and
in the Bay Area."
While the center will provide
over 13,000 square feet of space,
Hillel is currently limited to only
750 square feet — two rooms and
a small library in the basement of
Old Union.
"As it stands, Hillel is a great
place, but it can't fully accommodate
the needs of the Jewish community
given its spatial restraints," said So
phie Roberts, a sophomore and the
education and culture chair at I lil
lel. "We have a vibrant, thriving

Jewish community, and we need an
appropriate space for it."
"We'd love to be able to have
all the different services (Ortho
dox, Conservative and Reform)
happen separately, but in the
same building, and then have us
come together to have a meal af
terwards," Stein said. "But in
stead, we often have to put one
service in a classroom in Braun,
another in Tresidder and anoth
er one in the ballroom."
The Ziff Center, with its
kosher kitchen, dining hall and
multiple areas for worship, will
more than be able to provide for
such gatherings.
The center will be able to ac
commodate far more than num
bers, however, welcoming Jews
and non-Jews alike.
"Hillel is an extremely inclu
sive organization, and it is with
out question that the Ziff Center
will be the same way," Roberts
said. "It will be a welcoming envi

ronment in which all students, re
gardless of religious affiliation or
observance, will feel comfortable
and accepted."
But despite all that the Ziff
Center will be, 565 Mayfield re
mains a vacant building with
peeling paint, a yellow lawn and a
garden that is nnkept s»ve a row
of carefully pruned rose bushes.
Even though it has secured the
lease to this building, Hillel must
raise an additional $5 million to
pay for construction and renova
tion, and another $5 million in
order to establish an endowment
fund to support the operations,
maintenance and programs in
the new center. The anticipated
date of completion is winter 2003.
"1 think that the Ziff Center is
an important milestone in the
history of constantly growing
Jewish community at Stanford,"
Roberts said. "I'm excited to have
it be our new home and 1 can't
have the opportunity to use it."

newal latent in this seemingly dilap
idated house.
"We've been tending the
roses . . . since the last resident
passed away," said Debra Stein, ex
ecutive director of 1 lillel, referring to
the bushes that have grown in front
of 565 since 1899. "We're committed
to the history of that building."
When planning and construc
tion of the Ziff Center for Jewish Life
are complete, the building will
house a library along with meeting
rooms, seminar rooms, and class
rooms, which will provide for intel
lectual stimulation.
Elsewhere, a reception hall,
lounge, worship spaces and quiet

meditative areas will augment the
social and spiritual identity of the
center. Besides an auditorium, a
landscaped courtyard and an up
scale cafe, the Ziff Center for Jewish
Life will also provide Stanford's 112 irst
kosher dining hall.
"The Ziff Center will become a
spacious, warm and welcoming
home for the campus Jewish com
munity," Stein said. "It will be a
powerful physical presence for the
Jewish community at Stanford and
in the Bay Area."
While the center will provide
over 13,000 square feet of space,
Hillel is currently limited to only
750 square feet — two rooms and
a small library in the basement of
Old Union.
"As it stands, Hillel is a great
place, but it can't fully accommodate
the needs of the Jewish community
given its spatial restraints," said So
phie Roberts, a sophomore and the
education and culture chair at I lil
lel. "We have a vibrant, thriving

Jewish community, and we need an
appropriate space for it."
"We'd love to be able to have
all the different services (Ortho
dox, Conservative and Reform)
happen separately, but in the
same building, and then have us
come together to have a meal af
terwards," Stein said. "But in
stead, we often have to put one
service in a classroom in Braun,
another in Tresidder and anoth
er one in the ballroom."
The Ziff Center, with its
kosher kitchen, dining hall and
multiple areas for worship, will
more than be able to provide for
such gatherings.
The center will be able to ac
commodate far more than num
bers, however, welcoming Jews
and non-Jews alike.
"Hillel is an extremely inclu
sive organization, and it is with
out question that the Ziff Center
will be the same way," Roberts
said. "It will be a welcoming envi

ronment in which all students, re
gardless of religious affiliation or
observance, will feel comfortable
and accepted."
But despite all that the Ziff
Center will be, 565 Mayfield re
mains a vacant building with
peeling paint, a yellow lawn and a
garden that is nnkept s»ve a row
of carefully pruned rose bushes.
Even though it has secured the
lease to this building, Hillel must
raise an additional $5 million to
pay for construction and renova
tion, and another $5 million in
order to establish an endowment
fund to support the operations,
maintenance and programs in
the new center. The anticipated
date of completion is winter 2003.
"1 think that the Ziff Center is
an important milestone in the
history of constantly growing
Jewish community at Stanford,"
Roberts said. "I'm excited to have
it be our new home and 1 can't
have the opportunity to use it."

After negotiating a new lease with the University, Hillel will move into its new home at 565 Mayfield Ave. The center
will provide expanded meeting space for the Jewish community on campus.
Synonymous with fraternity par
tics, co-ops and herds of frosh mi
grating through it every Friday and
Saturday night, May field Ave. is a
bristling hub of campus social activi
ty. Yet one house, 565 Mayfield, in a
prime location where the red cups
are strewn and the Marguerite pass
es every 15 minutes, stands silent.
In the spring of 2001,1 lillel, the
Center for Jewish Life at Stanford,
purchased the lease for this building
from Stanford University. It took
over six years, intensive fitndraising,
and $5 million, but now Hillel is
ready to start turning this historic
site into The I larold and Libby Ziff
Center for Jewish Life. And it has
started with the small things.
The building's tall, imposing
columns are cracked and faded. I he
once-white facade is nowadingy gray
and die dark green shutters, commis
sioned over a 100, were meant to im
itate Boston architecture at a time
when the East and West Coasts still
seemed insurmountably distant.
And yet, before (his silent house,
with its impossibly overgrown gar
den, its weeds, and a yellow lawn
that hasn't been tended in years,
meticulously maintained rose bush
es flower in pinks, reds and white.
Recently pruned, in full bloom, they
are symbolic of the potential for re
newal latent in this seemingly dilap
idated house.
