## Beavers mount 31-21 comeback 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STMT 
Holding a 21-6 lead at the half,
the Stanford football team (2-8, I -6
Pacific-10 Conference) looked like
it was going to finally put away a
solid victory to celebrate the last
home game for its 16 seniors.

Football
Saturday: Oregon State 31, Stanford 21

By the end of the game,
though, the Cardinal had folded,
as Oregon State (7-4, 3-4)
outscored the Cardinal 25-0 in the
second hall to win the contest 31-
21. Stanford saw yet another
winnable game slip away as defen
sive mistakes and offensive stagna
tion allowed the Beavers to slowly
but surely storm back and make
themselves bowl-eligible.
"We struggled, but it gives us a
lot of confidence," Beavers quar
terback Derek Anderson said. "We
pulled our end of it today, and die
defense played great for us."
Oregon State running back
Steven Jackson rushed 35 times for
230 yards and a touchdown, break
ing off runs of 54 and 70 yards in
the second half. Anderson tallied
290 passing yards, including a 46-
yard touchdown toss to James New
son that gave the Beavers the lead
with 9:36 remaining in the game.
Despite the Beavers' gaudy
final numbers, Stanford held the
upper hand throughout the first
half. On its second possession, the
Cardinal drove 91 yards to pay
dirt, as redsfiirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter hit junior Luke
Powell in stride down the light
sideline, and the wide receiver out

rail the secondary fora 49-yard
touchdown. It was Stanford's
longest touchdown pass of the
year, and it came at the end of a six
play chive that was also the Cardi
nal's longest of the season.
With seven minutes to play in
the second half, true freshman cor
nerback T.J. Rushing alertly
snatched a hobbled pass away from
Beaver wideout Kenny Farley and
beat the entire Oregon State team
up the right sideline for 63 yards
before Newson finally caught up to
him at the 7-yard line. Senior tail
back Kerry Carter finished the job
with a I-yard touchdown plunge.
The Beavers went three-and
out on the ensuing possession, and
Powell benefited from good block
ing in breaking up the right side
line for 32 yards on the punt re
turn. On the next play, senior full
back Casey Moore came out of the
backfield on the right side and just
kept running as Matter rolled out
right. The freshman connected
with the senior down the field, and
Moore rumbled untouched into
the end zone for the 31-yard score.
"We did not play very well in the
first half, and they made some big
plays to take advantage," Beavers
head coach Dennis Erickson said.
Oregon State would manage
only two field goals by Kirk Ylinie
mi, as the Cardinal defense held
Jackson to 65 yards on 19 carries,
and Anderson overthrew receiver
after receiver in going 12-of-26
passing for 165 yards.
"We said we had to pick it up
and get it going on both sides of the
ball," Beavers tight end Tim Euhus
said. "The defense had to do their
share, and we had to do ours."
If there was any doubt about

Oregon State's renewed resolve,
the first play from scrimmage in the
second half resolved them.
Jackson took the handoff, beat
the Stanford defenders to the
perimeter, and then left them in his
dust as he dashed 58 yards into the
end zone, closing the gap to 21 -13.
The Cardinal wasn't fazed,
though, as a fake field goal try re

suited in an 11-yard completion to
Moore, giving Stanford first-and
goal on the 5-yard line. Two plays
later, though, Matter's pass for se
nior wideout Ryan Wells wound
up in the waiting arms of line
backer Richard Seigler.
"The ball just didn't go where I

"I mean, that doesn't happen to

Oregon State and Stanford
would each come up empty on
their next three possessions, as An

record for number of receivers

down the Cardinal running game.
" 112 heir game plan was to jam a
bunch of guys in the box and take
away our strength, which has been
power running," senior offensive
lineman Creg Schindler said.

"They left some opportunities

ball," Matter said. "In the first half
we did that, in the second half we

Yliniemi kicked a 23-yard field
goal with 13:53 to play in the
fourth quarter, and, after Matter
was intercepted, Anderson con
nected with Newson for the go
ahead score with 9:36 to play.

"We clid some things to get our

Stanford - WELLS, Ryan 3-45.
Holding a 21-6 lead at the half,
the Stanford football team (2-8, I -6
Pacific-10 Conference) looked like
it was going to finally put away a
solid victory to celebrate the last
home game for its 16 seniors.

Football
Saturday: Oregon State 31, Stanford 21

By the end of the game,
though, the Cardinal had folded,
as Oregon State (7-4, 3-4)
outscored the Cardinal 25-0 in the
second hall to win the contest 31-
21. Stanford saw yet another
winnable game slip away as defen
sive mistakes and offensive stagna
tion allowed the Beavers to slowly
but surely storm back and make
themselves bowl-eligible.
"We struggled, but it gives us a
lot of confidence," Beavers quar
terback Derek Anderson said. "We
pulled our end of it today, and die
defense played great for us."
Oregon State running back
Steven Jackson rushed 35 times for
230 yards and a touchdown, break
ing off runs of 54 and 70 yards in
the second half. Anderson tallied
290 passing yards, including a 46-
yard touchdown toss to James New
son that gave the Beavers the lead
with 9:36 remaining in the game.
Despite the Beavers' gaudy
final numbers, Stanford held the
upper hand throughout the first
half. On its second possession, the
Cardinal drove 91 yards to pay
dirt, as redsfiirt freshman quarter
back Kyle Matter hit junior Luke
Powell in stride down the light
sideline, and the wide receiver out

rail the secondary fora 49-yard
touchdown. It was Stanford's
longest touchdown pass of the
year, and it came at the end of a six
play chive that was also the Cardi
nal's longest of the season.
With seven minutes to play in
the second half, true freshman cor
nerback T.J. Rushing alertly
snatched a hobbled pass away from
Beaver wideout Kenny Farley and
beat the entire Oregon State team
up the right sideline for 63 yards
before Newson finally caught up to
him at the 7-yard line. Senior tail
back Kerry Carter finished the job
with a I-yard touchdown plunge.
The Beavers went three-and
out on the ensuing possession, and
Powell benefited from good block
ing in breaking up the right side
line for 32 yards on the punt re
turn. On the next play, senior full
back Casey Moore came out of the
backfield on the right side and just
kept running as Matter rolled out
right. The freshman connected
with the senior down the field, and
Moore rumbled untouched into
the end zone for the 31-yard score.
"We did not play very well in the
first half, and they made some big
plays to take advantage," Beavers
head coach Dennis Erickson said.
Oregon State would manage
only two field goals by Kirk Ylinie
mi, as the Cardinal defense held
Jackson to 65 yards on 19 carries,
and Anderson overthrew receiver
after receiver in going 12-of-26
passing for 165 yards.
"We said we had to pick it up
and get it going on both sides of the
ball," Beavers tight end Tim Euhus
said. "The defense had to do their
share, and we had to do ours."
If there was any doubt about

Oregon State's renewed resolve,
the first play from scrimmage in the
second half resolved them.
Jackson took the handoff, beat
the Stanford defenders to the
perimeter, and then left them in his
dust as he dashed 58 yards into the
end zone, closing the gap to 21 -13.
The Cardinal wasn't fazed,
though, as a fake field goal try re

suited in an 11-yard completion to
Moore, giving Stanford first-and
goal on the 5-yard line. Two plays
later, though, Matter's pass for se
nior wideout Ryan Wells wound
up in the waiting arms of line
backer Richard Seigler.

Oregon State and Stanford

record for number of receivers

" 112 heir game plan was to jam a

"They left some opportunities

Yliniemi kicked a 23-yard field
goal with 13:53 to play in the
fourth quarter, and, after Matter
