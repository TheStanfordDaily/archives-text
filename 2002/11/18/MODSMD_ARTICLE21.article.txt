# Men to face Terriers
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Both unranked Stanford and
unranked Boston University are
seeking to gain the same thing when
they face oft'in the Preseason Nil
tonight â€” respect.
Respect...
It's a relatively meaningless term
when yon have it. It's expected,
taken for granted, appreciated but
not always acknowledged. I lowever
when you don't have it, it's all you
want. It's the self-motivator. It's the
reason you play the game.
The unranked Terriers, who
play the Cardinal tonight at 6:15
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, are at that
point in their program's history,
with people finally starting to stand
up and take notice. Naturally, gar
nering respect from outsiders re

team's ascent.
BU, a self-described "gritty"
team, returns its top eight scorers
from the squad that captured the
America Last Conference champi

tournament appearance.
"Following up on a season like

we had last year presents certain
challenges," said BU head coach
Dennis Wolff. "The players have ex
pectations about doing better.
There are other goals these guys
can accomplish."
The Cardinal knows what it'slike
to be on top. It remembers what na
tional attention speculation and
feels like, and more than anything,
it's what the team wants back now.
"We're under the national radar
right now, and I think [the Presea
son NIT] gives us the opportunity
to make a name for ourselves, make
some people notice us," Stanford ju
nior center Joe Kirchofer said.
It's almost fitting, then, that the
two teams open up their respective
seasons against one another in one
of the most prestigious preseason
tournaments in the nation.
"We're going to be tested early,"
Cardinal junior Matt Lottich said.
"[Hie tournament | is really going to
show us where we stand."
Both BU and Stanford struggled
in their first exhibition games of the
season. Like the Cardinal, the Ter
riers'didn't pull away from their op
