# Men to face Terriers
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Both unranked Stanford and
unranked Boston University are
seeking to gain the same thing when
they face oft'in the Preseason Nil
tonight â€” respect.
Respect...
It's a relatively meaningless term
when yon have it. It's expected,
taken for granted, appreciated but
not always acknowledged. I lowever
when you don't have it, it's all you
want. It's the self-motivator. It's the
reason you play the game.
The unranked Terriers, who
play the Cardinal tonight at 6:15
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, are at that
point in their program's history,
with people finally starting to stand
up and take notice. Naturally, gar
nering respect from outsiders re
mains a major component of the
team's ascent.
BU, a self-described "gritty"
team, returns its top eight scorers
from the squad that captured the
America Last Conference champi
onship and made its sixth NCAA
tournament appearance.
"Following up on a season like

we had last year presents certain
challenges," said BU head coach
Dennis Wolff. "The players have ex
pectations about doing better.
There are other goals these guys
can accomplish."
The Cardinal knows what it'slike
to be on top. It remembers what na
tional attention speculation and
feels like, and more than anything,
it's what the team wants back now.
"We're under the national radar
right now, and I think [the Presea
son NIT] gives us the opportunity
to make a name for ourselves, make
some people notice us," Stanford ju
nior center Joe Kirchofer said.
It's almost fitting, then, that the
two teams open up their respective
seasons against one another in one
of the most prestigious preseason
tournaments in the nation.
"We're going to be tested early,"
Cardinal junior Matt Lottich said.
"[Hie tournament | is really going to
show us where we stand."
Both BU and Stanford struggled
in their first exhibition games of the
season. Like the Cardinal, the Ter
riers'didn't pull away from their op

Senior Julius Barnes drives to the basket against Kris Weems in an exhibition
game last Tuesday. The team faces Boston University tonight at 6:15 p.m.
ponent until the second half.
Likewise, after Stanford's game
against the Olympic (Hub last l ues
day, it's clear to everyone that there
are places for the Cardinal to im
prove. Stanford's ability to produce
offensively will be a key in this
matchup against BU.
After Tuesday's exhibit ion game,
questions remain: Can senior point
guard Julius Barnes repeat last
week's heroic 27-point scoring per
formance? Will junior Justin Davis
be a consistent presence offensively?
Can sophomore wing Josh Chil
dress and junior shooting guard
Matt Lottich remain offensive
threats? Will sophomore Rob Little
emerge as a dominating center?
"There's a lot of things that we
could have done better in the exhi
bition game," said freshman wing
Dan Grunfeld. "I think we im
proved even from the first half to
the second half in the first game,
and hopefully we can carry that
over and improve even more."
Keeping the offensive question
marks in mind, success against BU
could be contingent upon the abili
ty of Stanford's fiontcourt to stay
out of foul trouble. The Terriers,
lacking the presence of a dominant
big man inside, make up for that

shortcoming through the team's all
around deep shooting ability.
BU's senior forward Billy Collins
is coming off a junior campaign in
which lie averaged 12 points and
8.1 rebounds per game while simul
taneously posting the team's higli
est-ever single-season 3-point
shooting mark, hitting 48.2 percent
from behind the arc.
Junior forward Jason Gro
chowalski proved that he could re
ally light it up during the exhibition
game. Ile finished with 1S points on
8-of-l 1 shooting, going2-of-3 from
behind the arch.
"Boston will put live guys on the
court who are legitimate shooters,"
Little said. "They don't necessarily
have a dominant post player, but
they're going to be setting a lot of
screens for their big men and hav
ing them actually shooting threes
and running cuts. It's going to be a
different style of defense that our
big men aren't use to, and we're
going to have to be guarding guys
on the perimeter and going out to
the3-point line extended to play de
fense and apply pressure."
Stanford players seem optimistic
about Monday's matchup.
"I'm really looking forward to this
game," Childress said. "1 think that
both teams are going to come out
and play hard, and bottom line, it's
going to come down to execution."
The winner will play in the sec
ond round on Wednesday.
