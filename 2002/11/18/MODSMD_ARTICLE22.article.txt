# Seniors say goodbye
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
()n Saturday, the seniors on the
Stanford football team played their
last game at Stanford Stadium.
While the Cardinal was unable
to pull through with a victory, the
game was still an emotional one, as
16 players ended their careers on
the Farm.
"We had the senior dinner last
night for the moms and dads, and
it was really touching just to see
how much Stanford football has
meant to families," coach Buddy
l eevens said. "We talked about
wanting to do something special
for the seniors in their last oppor
tunity in Stanford Stadium. We
regret that those guys didn't go
out with a win, but I admire the
effort across the board. They
played hard."
The seniors were one of the
main reasons that the Cardinal
was able to keep the game close.
Fullback Casey Moore played well
out of the backfield, catching three
passes for 42 yards. His 31-yard
grab in the second quarter put the
Cardinal up 21-3, and in the third
quarter, he caught a key 11-yard
pass on a fake field goal attempt
fora Cardinal first down.
Wide receiver Ryan Wells also
had a strong game for the Cardi
nal. In addition to his team-lead
ing 45 yards receiving, Wells had
75 yards in kickoff returns, giving
the team good Field position
throughout the game.
Running back Kerry (barter was
the primary driving force for (he
offense, rushing 20 times for 81
yards. Carter's play opened up the
attack, allowing quarterback Kyle
Matter to throw down field with
greater success than he has in the
past few games.
On defense, the seniors were es

sential to holding the Beavers to
six points in the first half. Free
safety Colin Branch finished with
six solo tackles, while Matt
Leonard played strong on the line,
getting in on four tackles.
However, Saturday's contest
also showed off the future of Car
dinal football on both sides of the
ball. On defense, true freshman
T.J. Rushing played well, inter
cepting a pass and returning it 63
yards to the Beavers' 7-yard line.
1 lie (Cardinal was able to capitalize
on the field position, scoring on a
Carter run.
"T.J.'s got some stuff; he's an
exciting player," leevens said.
"You like to see a guy like that —
he's fun to be around, he's fun to
coach, he's positive, he's a believer.
He's a very talented athlete, and
he works hard."
Rushing also had four tackles in
the game, two of which were solo.
"He's amazing —fora fresh
man coming out playing the way
he does every game, he plays hard
nosed football," senior defensive
lineman Trey Freeman said.
"That interception, it was amaz
ing; he caught it with one hand.
You can't say enough about him.
He's going to be an extremely
good player by the time he gets to
be a senior."
Sophomore Oshiomogho Atog
we also played well for the Cardi
nal, starting at strong safety. Atog
we finished the contest with a
game-leading 11 tackles, helping
hold the Beavers to only 17 com
pletions on 41 attempts. Atogwe is
also leading the team in intercep
tions this season, picking off three
passes in 10 games.
On offense, the Cardinal also
saw some solid play from its
younger guys. Matter, a redshirt
