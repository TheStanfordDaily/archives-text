## 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
Four teams came to Maloney
Field this weekend for the first two
rounds of the NCAA tournament.
And after three games — and
as exciting a conclusion as possible
to wrap up the opening weekend
of play — the No. I Stanford
women's soccer team will be the
only squad advancing to next
weekend's third round.

Women's Soccer
Friday: No. 1 Stanford 4, Cal Poly 0
Yesterday: Stanford 1, California 0 OT

After easily handling Cal Poly 4-
0 Friday night, the Cardinal beat a
tough California squad 1-0 in
overtime yesterday afternoon to
set up a third-round match against
Notre Dame next Saturday night.
Friday night's game was the first
step towards the championship
that has been the team's goal all
season, and the squad came out fir
ing on all cylinders, jumping out to
a 2-0 lead in the first 15 minutes.
Stanford got onto the board in
the sixth minute, as junior striker
Marcie Ward took a corner and
lobbed the ball into the box. Se
nior midfielder Callie Withers
headed the ball to the feet of se
nior striker Mania Wallis, who
fired it into the back of the net for
the early lead.
The goal not only gave the Car
dinal a lead it would never give up,
but it also made Ward the all-time
school leader in assists.
She added to her record just 10
minutes later on another corner
kick. Ward again served the set piece
up to Withers, who this time was able
to settle the ball and beat the keeper
for the team's second goal.
Ward would add a third assist in
the second half as she again fed the
ball to Wallis for her second goal of
the match. In the 56th minute,
Ward took a free kick and sent the
ball ahead to Wallis, who beat her
defender and buried the open shot.
"[Ward and Wallis] have devel
oped a telepathic understanding
on set plays, and it's very pleasing
to watch," Stanford co-coach Paul
Sapsford said. "You have to have

a good soccer brain to exploit
things like that."
I he final goal of the night
would come off the foot of fresh
man striker Jennifer Farenbaugh,
who completed an unassisted run
down the wing with a laser of a shot
from 25 yards out. The speed
down the wings has been a
strength of the Cardinal attack all
season, and Friday night's game
was no exception.
While Cal Poly had its c hances,
especially one excellent opportu
nity iu the 'Wrd minute, it seemed
that the Mustangs were, on the
whole, overmatched.
"Stanford is a very good team,"
Cal Poly head coach Alex Crozier
said. "I thought our team (ought
well. We never gave up, so I was
proud of them. "
With the lirst-round jitters out
of the way, the Cardinal prepared
fora second-round matchup
against conference rival California
yesterday afternoon. The fires of
the rivalry were stoked even
stronger the previous week when
an online Cal player journal de

scribed the Stanford team as "soft."
The two teams have always had
physical battles, though Stanford
started slow during a game two
weeks ago in Berkeley.
"It's important to let Cal know
that we're not the team they faced
in the first IT) minutes," Ward
said after Friday night's game.
"We're the team they faced in the
other 75 minutes."
"Soft" could hardly be a word
used to describe either squad yes
terday afternoon. They combined
to play a game that was at times
frantic, often physical, always ex
citing, and in the end could not
even be resolved in regulation.
Stanford had the better scoring
opportunities in regulation, many
of which came in three- or four
minute batches. The Cardinal's
best scoring chance came in the
82nd minute, as Wallis took a pass
from Ward past her defender and
faced a one-on-one with the keep
er. I let shot went left of the keep
er towards the post, but ricocheted
off the inside of the post and flew
straight across the goal mouth.

()ne of (lal's best scoring oppor
tunities in regulation came just
after halftime, when freshman
midfielder Tracy llamm ap
peared to have a clear breakaway
to the goal, only to be caught by
Stanford defender Alison Pabon.
While both teams had subse
quent chances, there was little How
to a game filled with challenges
and quick counterattacks. Neither
team was able to store in regula
tion, yet only five minutes of the
extra period were necessary to
produce a victor.
Pabon took a ball down the wing
and sent it to Wallis, who crossed the
ball into the box. Ward jumped to
head it, but the ball came just past
her to senior Allyson Marquand,
who was able to set it at her feet and
send it past the keeper for the gold
en goal and a trip to the third round.
"ft landed at my feet," Mar
quand said. "1 just shot it and
hoped it went in, and it did."
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its championship tun Satur
day night at 7:00 p.m. when it
hosts Notre Dame at Maloney.
