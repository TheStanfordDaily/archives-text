# Cross country teams sweep West Regionals

Stanford junior Donald Sage
looked back one last time with 50
meters to go to be certain he had
the victory. With Oregon's Jason
I lartmann struggling to hang on to
the pace, Sage shook his fist in cele
bration as he successfully defended
his individual NCAA regional title.
As junior Adam 1 enforde came
up the fairway towards the finish
line, he tried to excite the crowd,
waving his arms and smiling as he
finished, excited for (lie team's cer
tain victory.
There were veiy few surprises at
the NCAA West Regional Champi
onships among the top-ranked
teams. But there was plenty of ex
citement for the Cardinal, which
dominated the field and won its sev
entli consecutive West Regional title.
Similar to the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, Stanford
jumped to the front of the race
early and controlled the pace. Six
Cardinal runners led the tight
pack up front until the middle of
the fifth mile when Hartmann
moved up to join Sage in the lead.
Sage pulled away from Hart
mann in the last half-mile and

cruised into the finish in HO min
utes, 13 seconds.
"It was a matter of pride," Sage
said of his win. "The race was on
our home course, and I wanted to
be sure a Stanford runner won it."
Chasing Sage and Hartmann
into the finish were three Stanford
runners, junior lan Dobson fin
ished third in 30:21 followed by
l enforde and junior Louis Luchi
ni in fourth and fifth, respectively,
both posting times 0f30:32. Fresh
man Neil Davis rounded out the
scoring for the Cardinal, finishing
eighth in 30:41.
Sophomores Ryan Hall (9th,
30:41) and Robert Smitson (38th,
31:58) also contributed to the Car
dinal's winning effort.
Stanford scored only 21 points
to easily beat runner-up Oregon.
The No. 5 Ducks scored 43 points
behind three top-10 finishes. Both
teams now have an automatic bid
to the NCAA Championships in
Terre I laute, Ind., on Nov. 25.
"We just wanted to gel the job
done and qualify on to the NCAA
Championships," said Vin Lanan
na, director of cross country and
track and field. "We've accom
plished that goal and are now look
ing forward to the national race."

1 lie West Regional was one of
nine regional races run on Satur
day. While the top two teams in
each region automatically quali
fied for the national champi
onships, another 13 at-large bids
from across all the regions are
being determined.
In the typical style of the cham
pionship season, it was also a day of
upsets across the country as
ranked teams fell to lower-ranked
or even unranked teams.
In the West Region at Stanford,
No. 22 Arizona State finished fifth
behind unranked Cal Poly and
Portland. Because Cal Poly is not
ranked, it is unlikely the Mustangs
will earn an at-large bid, thus
blocking Arizona State and Port
land from trips to (he national
championships as well.
In the Mountain Region, No. 3
Colorado was upset by No. 8
Northern Arizona, but the Buf
faloes still grabbed the region's sec
ond automatic bid. Brigham
Young's KipK angogo, considered
a favorite for the national title,
faded during the race with a ham
string injury and finished 28th. He
will be at nationals with his team
after it earned an at-large bid.
No. 2 Arkansas, considered the
biggest threat to Stanford's title
run, was almost upset by un
ranked Southern Methodist in the
South Central Region, 47-49.
And No. 23 Dartmouth finished
third in the Northeast Region be
hind No. 6 lona and No. 12 Provi
dence.
If the upsets and close calls on
the national scene this weekend
are any indication of how things
may play out at the national race,
the Cardinal will have a difficult
time defending its top ranking.
"We are going to do everything
we can to be in position to win at
nationals," Lananna said. "We will
do our best to put seven guys on
the line who can be Ail-American."
Sage added, "I think we will run
as a pack like we have all year. It is
nice to have your teammates with
you to help you along. I think we
are prepared for anything."

With only nine days to go until nationals, the Stan
ford women's cross country team will not get any more
fit. The Cardinal athletes have been training toward
this one race since early August, and since it generally
takes about 10 days fora workout's effect to be noticed,
the Stanford runners must now concentrate on honing
their peak speed instead of working on overall im
provement.
With this in mind, the team ran through the NCAA
West Regional on Saturday at the Stanford Coif Course
with one eye on the NCAA championship, which will be
decided in Terre Haute, Ind., on Nov. 25. The Cardi
nal scored 24 points to beat Arizona State (70) and
UCLA (84), but more importantly Stanford had the
perfect tune-up race before nationals.
Although the Cardinal's fitness level will not improve
much in the last two weeks before nationals, its racing
speed certainly will. In the early part of the season, the
team went into races slightly tired from its workouts, in
order to run faster later on.
The mix between rest and hard efforts in the days be
fore nationals is crucial. Too much rest, and the run
ner's legs feel flat and stagnant; too much intensity, and
the legs are tired and don't perform at their maximum.

At tlic West Regional, Stanford needed to place in
the top two to automatically qualify for nationals. And
judging from the team's dominant performance at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships two weeks ago,
which the team won by 36 points, it was cleat heading
into Saturday's race that Sum ford was the team to beat.
The results clearly backed up such suspicions:
Sophomore Alicia Craig won the 6,000-meter event in a
time of 20 minutes, 39 seconds, while her teammates —
senior Lauren Fleshman (3rd, 20:54), senior Malindi
Elmore (4th, 21:07), sophomore Sara Bei (i»th, 21:08)
and sophomoreJeane Goff (11th, 21 :. r )l) —finished out
the scoring for the Cardinal.
That domination gave Stanford a bit of breathing
room, allowing the runners to avoid digging themselves
into a hole before nationals.
"I had a different strategy than normal," Fleshman
said. "1 t(x)k it a bit easier the first few miles and didn't
redline it."
At the start of the race, 1 lawaii and UC-Irvine took
up pacemaking duties as the Stanford pack slotted in
about 15 feet behind. But the Anteaters could not keep
their pace and slid to seventh by the end of the race.
By the first kilometer, the duo of Bei and Craig had
taken control of the race, striding to a 20-meter gap over
a small pack that included teammates Fleshman and El
more.
The pair looked smooth and in control as they en
tered the tunnel leading to the hilly backside of the
course. But when the runners emerged onto the final
stretch, it was clear that the hills had shaken up the front
of the field.
Craig was still in the lead, but behind her was UCLA
star Lena Nilsson and Fleshman. Bei trailed in a few sec
onds later, her pace visibly slowed, and was caught by
teammate Elmore on the line.
"We didn't change the pace that much," Craig said.
"On the back of the course, Sara just backed off"a bit.
Our goal was to qualify but not kill ourselves, so it was in
her best interest to back off."
Meanwhile, the slower-starting Fleshman and El
more had been closing the gap to the front, although
carrying unwanted baggage in the form of Nilsson.
There can only be so many times an athlete digs re
ally deep inside themselves, bringing her body close to
the limits of human performance. Although the pack of
Fleshman, Elmore and Nilsson came off the hill togeth
er, the final finishing order reflected t he runners' goals
for the race.
Nilsson's UCLA team was locked in a viscous strug
gle with Arizona State for the final spot to qualify for na
tionals, while Elmore and Fleshman, secure in the
knowledge of the their team's qualification, could afford
to not push their bodies over the edge in this last race be
fore nationals.
"On the downhill Lena and 1 really started moving,"
Fleshman said. "But she started kicking it in hard, and
I took it a bit easier, saving something for next week.
Things are coming together for our team."

we can to be in position to win at
nationals," Lananna said. "We will
do our best to put seven guys on
the line who can be Ail-American."
Sage added, "I think we will run
as a pack like we have all year. It is
nice to have your teammates with
you to help you along. I think we
are prepared for anything."

With only nine days to go until nationals, the Stan
ford women's cross country team will not get any more
fit. The Cardinal athletes have been training toward
this one race since early August, and since it generally
takes about 10 days fora workout's effect to be noticed,
the Stanford runners must now concentrate on honing
their peak speed instead of working on overall im
provement.
With this in mind, the team ran through the NCAA
West Regional on Saturday at the Stanford Coif Course
with one eye on the NCAA championship, which will be
decided in Terre Haute, Ind., on Nov. 25. The Cardi
nal scored 24 points to beat Arizona State (70) and
UCLA (84), but more importantly Stanford had the
perfect tune-up race before nationals.
Although the Cardinal's fitness level will not improve
much in the last two weeks before nationals, its racing
speed certainly will. In the early part of the season, the
team went into races slightly tired from its workouts, in
order to run faster later on.
The mix between rest and hard efforts in the days be
fore nationals is crucial. Too much rest, and the run
ner's legs feel flat and stagnant; too much intensity, and
the legs are tired and don't perform at their maximum.

At tlic West Regional, Stanford needed to place in
the top two to automatically qualify for nationals. And
judging from the team's dominant performance at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships two weeks ago,
which the team won by 36 points, it was cleat heading
into Saturday's race that Sum ford was the team to beat.
The results clearly backed up such suspicions:
Sophomore Alicia Craig won the 6,000-meter event in a
time of 20 minutes, 39 seconds, while her teammates —
senior Lauren Fleshman (3rd, 20:54), senior Malindi
Elmore (4th, 21:07), sophomore Sara Bei (i»th, 21:08)
and sophomoreJeane Goff (11th, 21 :. r )l) —finished out
the scoring for the Cardinal.
That domination gave Stanford a bit of breathing
room, allowing the runners to avoid digging themselves
into a hole before nationals.
"I had a different strategy than normal," Fleshman
said. "1 t(x)k it a bit easier the first few miles and didn't
redline it."
At the start of the race, 1 lawaii and UC-Irvine took
up pacemaking duties as the Stanford pack slotted in
about 15 feet behind. But the Anteaters could not keep
their pace and slid to seventh by the end of the race.
By the first kilometer, the duo of Bei and Craig had
taken control of the race, striding to a 20-meter gap over
a small pack that included teammates Fleshman and El
more.
The pair looked smooth and in control as they en
tered the tunnel leading to the hilly backside of the
course. But when the runners emerged onto the final
stretch, it was clear that the hills had shaken up the front
of the field.
Craig was still in the lead, but behind her was UCLA
star Lena Nilsson and Fleshman. Bei trailed in a few sec
onds later, her pace visibly slowed, and was caught by
teammate Elmore on the line.
"We didn't change the pace that much," Craig said.
"On the back of the course, Sara just backed off"a bit.
Our goal was to qualify but not kill ourselves, so it was in
her best interest to back off."
Meanwhile, the slower-starting Fleshman and El
more had been closing the gap to the front, although
carrying unwanted baggage in the form of Nilsson.
There can only be so many times an athlete digs re
ally deep inside themselves, bringing her body close to
the limits of human performance. Although the pack of
Fleshman, Elmore and Nilsson came off the hill togeth
er, the final finishing order reflected t he runners' goals
for the race.
Nilsson's UCLA team was locked in a viscous strug
gle with Arizona State for the final spot to qualify for na
tionals, while Elmore and Fleshman, secure in the
knowledge of the their team's qualification, could afford
to not push their bodies over the edge in this last race be
fore nationals.
"On the downhill Lena and 1 really started moving,"
Fleshman said. "But she started kicking it in hard, and
I took it a bit easier, saving something for next week.
Things are coming together for our team."

ANDREW PETERMAN/The Stanford Daily
Sophomores Alicia Craig and Sara Bei lead the pack dur
ing yesterday's NCAA West Regional Championships.
Stanford junior Donald Sage
looked back one last time with 50
meters to go to be certain he had
the victory. With Oregon's Jason
I lartmann struggling to hang on to
the pace, Sage shook his fist in cele
bration as he successfully defended
his individual NCAA regional title.
As junior Adam 1 enforde came
up the fairway towards the finish
line, he tried to excite the crowd,
waving his arms and smiling as he
finished, excited for (lie team's cer
tain victory.
There were veiy few surprises at
the NCAA West Regional Champi
onships among the top-ranked
teams. But there was plenty of ex
citement for the Cardinal, which
dominated the field and won its sev
entli consecutive West Regional title.
Similar to the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, Stanford
jumped to the front of the race
early and controlled the pace. Six
Cardinal runners led the tight
pack up front until the middle of
the fifth mile when Hartmann
moved up to join Sage in the lead.
Sage pulled away from Hart
mann in the last half-mile and

cruised into the finish in HO min
utes, 13 seconds.
"It was a matter of pride," Sage
said of his win. "The race was on
our home course, and I wanted to
be sure a Stanford runner won it."
Chasing Sage and Hartmann
into the finish were three Stanford
runners, junior lan Dobson fin
ished third in 30:21 followed by
l enforde and junior Louis Luchi
ni in fourth and fifth, respectively,
both posting times 0f30:32. Fresh
man Neil Davis rounded out the
scoring for the Cardinal, finishing
eighth in 30:41.
Sophomores Ryan Hall (9th,
30:41) and Robert Smitson (38th,
31:58) also contributed to the Car
dinal's winning effort.
Stanford scored only 21 points
to easily beat runner-up Oregon.
The No. 5 Ducks scored 43 points
behind three top-10 finishes. Both
teams now have an automatic bid
to the NCAA Championships in
Terre I laute, Ind., on Nov. 25.
"We just wanted to gel the job
done and qualify on to the NCAA
Championships," said Vin Lanan
na, director of cross country and
track and field. "We've accom
plished that goal and are now look
ing forward to the national race."

1 lie West Regional was one of
nine regional races run on Satur
day. While the top two teams in
each region automatically quali
fied for the national champi
onships, another 13 at-large bids
from across all the regions are
being determined.
In the typical style of the cham
pionship season, it was also a day of
upsets across the country as
ranked teams fell to lower-ranked
or even unranked teams.
In the West Region at Stanford,
No. 22 Arizona State finished fifth
behind unranked Cal Poly and
Portland. Because Cal Poly is not
ranked, it is unlikely the Mustangs
will earn an at-large bid, thus
blocking Arizona State and Port
land from trips to (he national
championships as well.
In the Mountain Region, No. 3
Colorado was upset by No. 8
Northern Arizona, but the Buf
faloes still grabbed the region's sec
ond automatic bid. Brigham
Young's KipK angogo, considered
a favorite for the national title,
faded during the race with a ham
string injury and finished 28th. He
will be at nationals with his team
after it earned an at-large bid.
No. 2 Arkansas, considered the
biggest threat to Stanford's title
run, was almost upset by un
ranked Southern Methodist in the
South Central Region, 47-49.
And No. 23 Dartmouth finished
third in the Northeast Region be
hind No. 6 lona and No. 12 Provi
dence.
If the upsets and close calls on
the national scene this weekend
are any indication of how things
may play out at the national race,
the Cardinal will have a difficult
time defending its top ranking.
"We are going to do everything
we can to be in position to win at

tionals, while Elmore and Fleshman, secure in the
knowledge of the their team's qualification, could afford
to not push their bodies over the edge in this last race be
fore nationals.
"On the downhill Lena and 1 really started moving,"
Fleshman said. "But she started kicking it in hard, and
I took it a bit easier, saving something for next week.
Things are coming together for our team."

Sophomores Alicia Craig and Sara Bei lead the pack dur
ing yesterday's NCAA West Regional Championships.
Stanford junior Donald Sage
looked back one last time with 50
meters to go to be certain he had
the victory. With Oregon's Jason
I lartmann struggling to hang on to
the pace, Sage shook his fist in cele
bration as he successfully defended
his individual NCAA regional title.
As junior Adam 1 enforde came
up the fairway towards the finish
line, he tried to excite the crowd,
waving his arms and smiling as he
finished, excited for (lie team's cer
tain victory.
There were veiy few surprises at
the NCAA West Regional Champi
onships among the top-ranked
teams. But there was plenty of ex
citement for the Cardinal, which
dominated the field and won its sev
entli consecutive West Regional title.
Similar to the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, Stanford
jumped to the front of the race
early and controlled the pace. Six
Cardinal runners led the tight
pack up front until the middle of
the fifth mile when Hartmann
moved up to join Sage in the lead.
Sage pulled away from Hart
mann in the last half-mile and

cruised into the finish in HO min
utes, 13 seconds.
"It was a matter of pride," Sage
said of his win. "The race was on
our home course, and I wanted to
be sure a Stanford runner won it."
Chasing Sage and Hartmann
into the finish were three Stanford
runners, junior lan Dobson fin
ished third in 30:21 followed by
l enforde and junior Louis Luchi
ni in fourth and fifth, respectively,
both posting times 0f30:32. Fresh
man Neil Davis rounded out the
scoring for the Cardinal, finishing
eighth in 30:41.
Sophomores Ryan Hall (9th,
30:41) and Robert Smitson (38th,
31:58) also contributed to the Car
dinal's winning effort.
Stanford scored only 21 points
to easily beat runner-up Oregon.
The No. 5 Ducks scored 43 points
behind three top-10 finishes. Both
teams now have an automatic bid
to the NCAA Championships in
Terre I laute, Ind., on Nov. 25.
"We just wanted to gel the job
done and qualify on to the NCAA
Championships," said Vin Lanan
na, director of cross country and
track and field. "We've accom
plished that goal and are now look
ing forward to the national race."

1 lie West Regional was one of
nine regional races run on Satur
day. While the top two teams in
each region automatically quali
fied for the national champi
onships, another 13 at-large bids
from across all the regions are
being determined.
In the typical style of the cham
pionship season, it was also a day of
upsets across the country as
ranked teams fell to lower-ranked
or even unranked teams.
In the West Region at Stanford,
No. 22 Arizona State finished fifth
behind unranked Cal Poly and
Portland. Because Cal Poly is not
ranked, it is unlikely the Mustangs
will earn an at-large bid, thus
blocking Arizona State and Port
land from trips to (he national
championships as well.
In the Mountain Region, No. 3
Colorado was upset by No. 8
Northern Arizona, but the Buf
faloes still grabbed the region's sec
ond automatic bid. Brigham
Young's KipK angogo, considered
a favorite for the national title,
faded during the race with a ham
string injury and finished 28th. He
will be at nationals with his team
after it earned an at-large bid.
No. 2 Arkansas, considered the
biggest threat to Stanford's title
run, was almost upset by un
ranked Southern Methodist in the
South Central Region, 47-49.
And No. 23 Dartmouth finished
third in the Northeast Region be
hind No. 6 lona and No. 12 Provi
dence.
If the upsets and close calls on
the national scene this weekend
are any indication of how things
may play out at the national race,
the Cardinal will have a difficult
time defending its top ranking.
"We are going to do everything
we can to be in position to win at
nationals," Lananna said. "We will
do our best to put seven guys on
the line who can be Ail-American."
Sage added, "I think we will run
as a pack like we have all year. It is
nice to have your teammates with
you to help you along. I think we
are prepared for anything."

With only nine days to go until nationals, the Stan
ford women's cross country team will not get any more
fit. The Cardinal athletes have been training toward
this one race since early August, and since it generally
takes about 10 days fora workout's effect to be noticed,
the Stanford runners must now concentrate on honing
their peak speed instead of working on overall im
provement.
With this in mind, the team ran through the NCAA
West Regional on Saturday at the Stanford Coif Course
with one eye on the NCAA championship, which will be
decided in Terre Haute, Ind., on Nov. 25. The Cardi
nal scored 24 points to beat Arizona State (70) and
UCLA (84), but more importantly Stanford had the
perfect tune-up race before nationals.
Although the Cardinal's fitness level will not improve
much in the last two weeks before nationals, its racing
speed certainly will. In the early part of the season, the
team went into races slightly tired from its workouts, in
order to run faster later on.
The mix between rest and hard efforts in the days be
fore nationals is crucial. Too much rest, and the run
ner's legs feel flat and stagnant; too much intensity, and
the legs are tired and don't perform at their maximum.

At tlic West Regional, Stanford needed to place in
the top two to automatically qualify for nationals. And
judging from the team's dominant performance at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships two weeks ago,
which the team won by 36 points, it was cleat heading
into Saturday's race that Sum ford was the team to beat.
The results clearly backed up such suspicions:
Sophomore Alicia Craig won the 6,000-meter event in a
time of 20 minutes, 39 seconds, while her teammates —
senior Lauren Fleshman (3rd, 20:54), senior Malindi
Elmore (4th, 21:07), sophomore Sara Bei (i»th, 21:08)
and sophomoreJeane Goff (11th, 21 :. r )l) —finished out
the scoring for the Cardinal.
That domination gave Stanford a bit of breathing
room, allowing the runners to avoid digging themselves
into a hole before nationals.
"I had a different strategy than normal," Fleshman
said. "1 t(x)k it a bit easier the first few miles and didn't
redline it."
At the start of the race, 1 lawaii and UC-Irvine took
up pacemaking duties as the Stanford pack slotted in
about 15 feet behind. But the Anteaters could not keep
their pace and slid to seventh by the end of the race.
By the first kilometer, the duo of Bei and Craig had
taken control of the race, striding to a 20-meter gap over
a small pack that included teammates Fleshman and El
more.
The pair looked smooth and in control as they en
tered the tunnel leading to the hilly backside of the
course. But when the runners emerged onto the final
stretch, it was clear that the hills had shaken up the front
of the field.
Craig was still in the lead, but behind her was UCLA
star Lena Nilsson and Fleshman. Bei trailed in a few sec
onds later, her pace visibly slowed, and was caught by
teammate Elmore on the line.
"We didn't change the pace that much," Craig said.
"On the back of the course, Sara just backed off"a bit.
Our goal was to qualify but not kill ourselves, so it was in
her best interest to back off."
Meanwhile, the slower-starting Fleshman and El
more had been closing the gap to the front, although
carrying unwanted baggage in the form of Nilsson.
There can only be so many times an athlete digs re
ally deep inside themselves, bringing her body close to
the limits of human performance. Although the pack of
Fleshman, Elmore and Nilsson came off the hill togeth
er, the final finishing order reflected t he runners' goals
for the race.
Nilsson's UCLA team was locked in a viscous strug
gle with Arizona State for the final spot to qualify for na
tionals, while Elmore and Fleshman, secure in the
knowledge of the their team's qualification, could afford
to not push their bodies over the edge in this last race be
fore nationals.
"On the downhill Lena and 1 really started moving,"
Fleshman said. "But she started kicking it in hard, and
I took it a bit easier, saving something for next week.
Things are coming together for our team."
