# Activist speaks on AIDS

### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
It is a nightmare scenario: being in
jected with HIV-laden blood at a gov
ernment-sponsored blood drive. Yet this
is the gi im truth as painted by Chinese
AIDS activist Dr. Wan Yan Hai in a
speech to about 50 people last Friday fo
cusing on the AIDS / IIIV crisis in Cen
tral China and the Chinese govern
ment's mishandling of the epidemic.
Wan received international attention in
August after being detained by the Chinese
government for leaking state secrets. He
spent 31 days in a state prison and, thanks
largely to international pressure, was re
leased after confessing to t he charges.
His organization, the AIDS Action Pro
ject, has been involved in AIDS education
and policy research since 1994. In 1998 the
group began to focus on unsanitary blood
drives in the provinces of Central China, es
pecially Henan, where in some villages 80
percent of adults participated in the drives.
'The government wants to cover up the
issues of blood selling," Wan said, referring
to a practice popular in the early 1990s
wherein the local government paid villagers
to donate blood.
Officials pooled the blood, removed the
valuable plasma and injected the red blood

cells back into the donors, a process which
allowed the villagers to safely give blood
every three days.
While pooling the blood made the
technique cheaper, it also facilitated the
spread of HIV. Wan noted that epi
demics sprung up in 10 to 15 provinces
primarily as a result of the blood sales.
One researcher found that more than 60
percent of those selling blood in Henan
became infected afterwards.
"Some doctors in Henan found the epi
demic and reported the epidemic to the
provincial government," Wan said. "The
doctors lost their jobs."
"[The government] doesn't want to
admit the epidemic. They don't want to take
responsibility," he said.
While the government stopped spon
soring the drives in 1995, the vacuum its
departure created and the continued
pharmaceutical demand for plasma
prompted a number of illicit blood deal
ers to begin operating.
With his group's increased involve
ment in the blood sale issue, Wan saw in
creased pressure from the government
to stop his work.
At a workshop Wan's group hosted in
March, "we brought different
NGO people to listen and have
some contact. The workshop was
investigated by the police and we
had to stop," he said.
On July 1 the Chinese govern
ment shut down the offices of the
AIDS Action Project and then, in
August, Wan was arrested. In
order to be released, Wan had to
confess to the accusations against
him.
"I confessed and admitted my
mistake and expressed regret and
asked for tolerance," he said.
Despite the seeming capitula
tion, he also saw his detainment as
an opportunity for dialogue with
government officials on AIDS and
Other health issues.
"When the government was
educating me, they also got a les
son," he said.
His lesson for the officials includ
ed the many general governmental
failures he had noticed during his
years as an activist.
"In general, the attitude of our
government towards AIDS is still
not open."
Instead of properly educating
the people, "AIDS has become a
weapon fort he authorities to attack
Western society," he said, noting
that many officials refer to the dis
ease as only a "Western illness."
Wan also condemned the coun

try's inability to combat the spread
of HIV, saying that "not many hos
pitals are prepared in the right
treatments. In Beijing there are
good, trained doctors. But there are
not enough."
In fact, while the government es
timates that about one million peo
ple in Henan province are infected,
only 300 or so receive the costly, but
effective, cocktail treatment.
"Most patients get no treat
ment," he said. "If the patients keep
silent, government keeps silent. If
patients protest, government gives
money."
Many are working to change the
status quo, however.
"Some projects have been orga
nized to educate the government,"
Wan said.
Wan's group is also working
closely with those directly affected
by the epidemic.
"We are helping villages to set
up self-supporting groups. We
are training local people to use
the computer and access the In
ternet," lie said.
The speech, sponsored by the
American Red Cross at Stanford
and the Undergraduate Chinese
American Association, was orga
nized by Helena Chang, a senior
majoring in biology and interna
tional relations who met Wan at
the UCSF International Health
Conference last spring.
"What is striking about what
he's done is his persistence," she
said. "He has been very aware of
his opportunities."

"In general, the attitude of our
government towards AIDS is still
not open."
Instead of properly educating
the people, "AIDS has become a
weapon fort he authorities to attack
Western society," he said, noting
that many officials refer to the dis

Wan also condemned the coun

try's inability to combat the spread
of HIV, saying that "not many hos

treatments. In Beijing there are
good, trained doctors. But there are
not enough."
In fact, while the government es
timates that about one million peo
ple in Henan province are infected,
only 300 or so receive the costly, but
effective, cocktail treatment.
"Most patients get no treat
ment," he said. "If the patients keep
silent, government keeps silent. If
patients protest, government gives
money."
Many are working to change the
status quo, however.
"Some projects have been orga
nized to educate the government,"
Wan said.
Wan's group is also working
closely with those directly affected
by the epidemic.
"We are helping villages to set
up self-supporting groups. We
are training local people to use
the computer and access the In
ternet," lie said.
The speech, sponsored by the
American Red Cross at Stanford

It is a nightmare scenario: being in
jected with HIV-laden blood at a gov
ernment-sponsored blood drive. Yet this
is the gi im truth as painted by Chinese
AIDS activist Dr. Wan Yan Hai in a
speech to about 50 people last Friday fo
cusing on the AIDS / IIIV crisis in Cen
tral China and the Chinese govern
ment's mishandling of the epidemic.
Wan received international attention in
August after being detained by the Chinese
government for leaking state secrets. He
spent 31 days in a state prison and, thanks
largely to international pressure, was re
leased after confessing to t he charges.
His organization, the AIDS Action Pro
ject, has been involved in AIDS education
and policy research since 1994. In 1998 the
group began to focus on unsanitary blood
drives in the provinces of Central China, es
pecially Henan, where in some villages 80
percent of adults participated in the drives.
'The government wants to cover up the
issues of blood selling," Wan said, referring
to a practice popular in the early 1990s
wherein the local government paid villagers
to donate blood.
Officials pooled the blood, removed the
valuable plasma and injected the red blood

cells back into the donors, a process which
allowed the villagers to safely give blood
every three days.
While pooling the blood made the
technique cheaper, it also facilitated the
spread of HIV. Wan noted that epi
demics sprung up in 10 to 15 provinces
primarily as a result of the blood sales.
One researcher found that more than 60
percent of those selling blood in Henan
became infected afterwards.
"Some doctors in Henan found the epi
demic and reported the epidemic to the
provincial government," Wan said. "The
doctors lost their jobs."
"[The government] doesn't want to
admit the epidemic. They don't want to take
responsibility," he said.
While the government stopped spon
soring the drives in 1995, the vacuum its
departure created and the continued
pharmaceutical demand for plasma
prompted a number of illicit blood deal
ers to begin operating.
With his group's increased involve
ment in the blood sale issue, Wan saw in
creased pressure from the government
to stop his work.
At a workshop Wan's group hosted in
March, "we brought different
NGO people to listen and have
some contact. The workshop was
investigated by the police and we
had to stop," he said.
On July 1 the Chinese govern
ment shut down the offices of the
AIDS Action Project and then, in
August, Wan was arrested. In
order to be released, Wan had to
confess to the accusations against
him.
"I confessed and admitted my
mistake and expressed regret and
asked for tolerance," he said.
Despite the seeming capitula
tion, he also saw his detainment as
an opportunity for dialogue with
government officials on AIDS and
Other health issues.
"When the government was
educating me, they also got a les
son," he said.
His lesson for the officials includ
ed the many general governmental
failures he had noticed during his
years as an activist.
"In general, the attitude of our
government towards AIDS is still
