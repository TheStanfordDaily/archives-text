# Activist speaks on AIDS

It is a nightmare scenario: being in
jected with HIV-laden blood at a gov
ernment-sponsored blood drive. Yet this
is the gi im truth as painted by Chinese
AIDS activist Dr. Wan Yan Hai in a
speech to about 50 people last Friday fo
cusing on the AIDS / IIIV crisis in Cen
tral China and the Chinese govern
ment's mishandling of the epidemic.
Wan received international attention in
August after being detained by the Chinese
government for leaking state secrets. He
spent 31 days in a state prison and, thanks
largely to international pressure, was re
leased after confessing to t he charges.
His organization, the AIDS Action Pro
ject, has been involved in AIDS education
and policy research since 1994. In 1998 the
group began to focus on unsanitary blood
drives in the provinces of Central China, es
pecially Henan, where in some villages 80
percent of adults participated in the drives.
'The government wants to cover up the
issues of blood selling," Wan said, referring
to a practice popular in the early 1990s
wherein the local government paid villagers
to donate blood.
Officials pooled the blood, removed the
valuable plasma and injected the red blood

cells back into the donors, a process which
allowed the villagers to safely give blood
every three days.
While pooling the blood made the
technique cheaper, it also facilitated the
spread of HIV. Wan noted that epi
demics sprung up in 10 to 15 provinces
primarily as a result of the blood sales.
One researcher found that more than 60
percent of those selling blood in Henan
became infected afterwards.
"Some doctors in Henan found the epi
demic and reported the epidemic to the
provincial government," Wan said. "The
doctors lost their jobs."
"[The government] doesn't want to
admit the epidemic. They don't want to take
responsibility," he said.
While the government stopped spon
soring the drives in 1995, the vacuum its
departure created and the continued
pharmaceutical demand for plasma
prompted a number of illicit blood deal
ers to begin operating.
With his group's increased involve
ment in the blood sale issue, Wan saw in
creased pressure from the government
to stop his work.
