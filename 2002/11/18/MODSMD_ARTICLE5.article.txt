# Mongolia weathers stormy transition to democracy
## 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Editors Note: This is the first in a weekly series of in
terviews uiit/i international students at Stanford
meant to heighten awareness of issues of social and
political importance around the world.

Mongolia, a country of about 2.6 million
that lies between Russia and China, lias
been democratizing and shifiting to a mar
ket economy over the past 12 years. Last
week, however, there was a governmental
crackdown on democratic protesters in
Ulaan Bataar, the country's capital. The
protesters were demonstrating fora more
equitable distribution of privatized land.
Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, 35, is the first
Mongolian student to be accepted by Stan
lord University. She has not matriculated
yet because she could not raise enough
money for tuition, and she is currently in
Mongolia, applying to various organiza
tions for funding.
Tsedevdamba is a political and human
rights activist and the executive director of
Liberty Center, a non-governmental orga
nization whose "mission is to protect rights

and liberties stated in the Mongolian Con
stitution and to strengthen democratic val
ues in Mongolia."
On Friday, The Daily spoke with Tsede
vdamba about the current political and eco
nomic issues facing Mongolia.
The Daily: What is the basic political situ
ation in Mongolia right now?
Oyungerel Tsedevdamba: So after Nov. 13,
the police did a night attack. The rulers are
spreading a lot of confused information.
They insist there was no attack at midnight.
However, there is some information, like
photos and videos, pictures and real wit
nesses and victims and also press confer
ences both showing and presenting the doc
uments. Only people who are watching free
and private [television] channels know the
facts; the rural people who are watching
only national TV, which is under the prime
minister's control, those people are seeing
only the government's side of the story.
TD: Why is the government allowing police
to attack the democratic protesters?
0 F: First of all, this was during the
nighttime and there was no
protest then ... but the govern
ment wanted to show that the or
ganizers were breaking the law . . .
1 now conclude that the govern
ment is convincing people that
they were breaking laws and it was
necessary to stop all of the tractors
[that were blocking the roads] and
stop all the demonstrations.
TD: Why is the government against
the privatization of the land?
OT: They were not against the
whole law; first of all, the law was a
very good idea; everybody thinks
the privatization of the land is a
good idea, but there were certain
articles in the law that seemed to
be unfair to the farmers . . . who
hoped to have some land using
this opportunity, but in this law it
is mentioned that farmland will be
privatized only for those compa
nies who are technically and finan
cially capable to continue the
farming work. It will be privatized
only for those companies who
have the money to buy farming
land. NoVv the farmers are de
manding that the land be divided
equally in order that regular farm
ers have the opportunity to own
the people's land.
TD: Can you talk a little about the
history of democracy in Mongolia?
OT: Democracy began in Mongo
lia in 1990 after years of demon
strations by the people which in
cluded hunger strikes against the
communist rule. It's the national
pride of Mongolia that there was
no force or violence used in order
to bring about democracy. It was
executed by peaceful consensus;
there was a peaceful fight for
democracy in 1990, and Mongolia
had free elections and changed
government many times and
everybody thought that we had
the right to free speech, to free
demonstration. We thought that
democracy has already been es
tablished here, but this incident

has told ns that Mongolian democ
racy is still very young and vulner
able and can be damaged.
TD: How long did the communist
regime rule Mongolia before
1990?
OT: The communists ruled Mon
golia from 1921.
TD: Do you think the world com
munity has any role to play in this
issue, or is it just a domestic issue?
OT: This is of course truly a domes
tic issue; constitutionally it is not al
lowed for land to be sold to foreign
ers, but at the same time it is a
human rights issue, that is, the use
of force against peaceful demon
strators for farmland. This is some
thing that is international and com
mon, because the Mongolian gov
ernment has lowered the common
standards of human rights as main
tained by the United Nations and
other countries who support the
U.N. resolution on human rights.
TD: What do you think of the polit
ical leadership in Mongolia today?
OT: [The] Mongolian ruling party
is now called the Mongolian Peo
ple's Ruling Party, MPRP. This is
exactly the same party, same name
and same rule as the communist
regime that ruled for 70 years. It
has not changed its name or its
structure even since 1990. This
party announced that it no longer
has communist ideals and has
changed. So the international
community and the people be
lieved that the MPRP has really
changed to become a democratic
party with democratic standards.
But they still cannot be truly de
mocratic and their activities and
actions reveal that they still have
some communist ideals and some
communist values.
TD: When are the next elections
in Mongolia?
OT: The next elections will be in
J une or July 0f2004. Elections are
held every four years.
TD: How do you think these elec
tions will turn out?
OT: We don't have to fear that the
ruling party will win the next elec
tions because their ratings are con

tinuously falling clown since May
of 2000. Mongolians value democ
racy; studies have shown that 85
percent of Mongolians view
democracy as the best option for
their society.
TD: What is the condition of the
economy in Mongolia?
OT: The economy of Mongolia
has been poor for many years.
Even during communism, when
Mongolia was dependent upon
the Soviet Union, it did not make
significant economic develop
ment. The economy was based on
the mining industry and agricul
ture. Since 1990, when democracy
began, when private enterprise
was permitted, the economy has
been growing; the growth rate has
been 2 percent for the last 2 years.
Between 1996 and 2000, the
growth rate was 3.4 percent. This
is very unsatisfactory growth.
TD: How are the relations between
Mongolia and its neighbors?
OT: It is officially stated that there
is parity in Mongolia's relations
between its two neighbors, Russia
and China. Mongolian officials
stress the good relations between
Mongolia and Russia and Mongo
lia and China. But there is also
public opinion that Russia is a bet
ter foreign ally than China. In sur
veys comparing different nations,
Russia always came first, America
second, Europe third, and China
always came fourth or fifth.
TD: Does Russia or China pro
vide economic aid to Mongolia?

Of; They do give us aid; I don't
know how significant it is. Mongo
lia receives most of its aid from the
International Monetary Fund and
Japanese aid is also considerable,
both in its amount and its scope.
TD: Does the United States pro
vide any aid to Mongolia?
OT: Yes the Americans give aid
and . . . wheat and also give Mon
golia favorable trade conditions.
TD: What are the relations like
between Mongolia and the Unit
ed States?
OT: We value any relations with
the United States. Because of our
territorial position between Russia
and China, we seek a third reliable
friend, and the United States and
Mongolia announced in 1992 or
1993 that they regard their rela
tionship as a "neighbors" relation
ship, and in this regard Mongo
lians view relations with the Unit
ed States very warmly.
TD: Is there anything else you'd
like to say about the state of the
transition into democracy in
Mongolia?
OT: I would like to say that
democracy is very dependent
upon the media, because democ
racy is based upon the people's
choice, and people can choose well
only when they have information.
So restricting information by mo
nopolizing national TV makes
democracy very vulnerable. If
ihey had free press like in the U.S.,
Mongolians would never vote for
communism. I can guarantee it.
