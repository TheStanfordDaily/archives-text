# Mongolia weathers stormy transition to democracy
## 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Editors Note: This is the first in a weekly series of in
terviews uiit/i international students at Stanford
meant to heighten awareness of issues of social and
political importance around the world.

Mongolia, a country of about 2.6 million
that lies between Russia and China, lias
been democratizing and shifiting to a mar
ket economy over the past 12 years. Last
week, however, there was a governmental
crackdown on democratic protesters in
Ulaan Bataar, the country's capital. The
protesters were demonstrating fora more
equitable distribution of privatized land.
Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, 35, is the first
Mongolian student to be accepted by Stan
lord University. She has not matriculated
yet because she could not raise enough
money for tuition, and she is currently in
Mongolia, applying to various organiza
tions for funding.
Tsedevdamba is a political and human
rights activist and the executive director of
Liberty Center, a non-governmental orga
nization whose "mission is to protect rights

and liberties stated in the Mongolian Con
stitution and to strengthen democratic val
ues in Mongolia."
On Friday, The Daily spoke with Tsede
vdamba about the current political and eco
nomic issues facing Mongolia.
The Daily: What is the basic political situ
ation in Mongolia right now?
Oyungerel Tsedevdamba: So after Nov. 13,
the police did a night attack. The rulers are
spreading a lot of confused information.
They insist there was no attack at midnight.
However, there is some information, like
photos and videos, pictures and real wit
nesses and victims and also press confer
ences both showing and presenting the doc
uments. Only people who are watching free
and private [television] channels know the
facts; the rural people who are watching
only national TV, which is under the prime
minister's control, those people are seeing
only the government's side of the story.
