# Students seek bigger BCSC
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Representatives from the Black
Student Union hope to meet with
Provost John Etchemendy and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni on Dec. 6 to submit
a proposal requesting more space
for the 30-year-old Black Commu
nity Services Center. This propos
al is the last step in a campaign to
expand the center which has been
ongoing for several years. The
center, which currently boasts just
over one square foot of meeting
space per black undergraduate â€”
making commupity-wide meet
ings impossible at the center.
As a part of this campaign, the
BSU will hold a meeting at 7 p.m.
tonight in the BCSC to educate in
terested students about the issue.
Following the meeting, a petition
for students to show support for
the BCSC's desire for more space
will be placed online.
The current BCSC, which

serves the University's 597-stu
dent black undergraduate com
munity, occupies 1,401 square
feet of space, including 080
square feet of meeting space. The
center also houses a computer
cluster, a kitchen, a bathroom
and office space.
According to BSU Co-Chair
Kevin Dious, a junior, the BCSC is
too small for most activities. As an
example, Dious said that the BSU
holds most of its meetings in El
Centro Chicano.
"The black community has to
scuffle and struggle to find ade
quate meeting space," he said.
"It's impossible to put on pro
grams and have real
events ... As the number of
black students at Stanford rises,
the center has just not been ade
quate to meet [our] needs."
BCSC Program Coordinator
Amy Keith, a sophomore, noted
that the building currently does
not have enough space for stu
dents to use all the computers in its
cluster at once, and that the

BCSC's kitchen must double as its
storage closet.
"Stanford respects and high
lights its community centers
when trying to attract applicants,
but when it comes to funding
we're at the bottom of the totem
pole," Keith said. "A bigger, bet
ter black house will revitalize the
community. It will be great to
have a place where students can
have meetings and, more impor
tantly, truly call a home."
Awakuni said that the Office of
Student Activities is currently work
ing with a space-planning consul
tant to review the space needs for all
student activities on campus.
"1 recently learned about the
BCSC desire for additional space,"
he said. "Currently, there is no
space available for allocation to any
student group. There is a space
crunch on campus and many ex
isting units are already in over
crowded quarters. The prospect of
new space being built for student
