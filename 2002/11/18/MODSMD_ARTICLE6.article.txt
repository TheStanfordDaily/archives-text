# Students seek bigger BCSC
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Representatives from the Black
Student Union hope to meet with
Provost John Etchemendy and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni on Dec. 6 to submit
a proposal requesting more space
for the 30-year-old Black Commu
nity Services Center. This propos
al is the last step in a campaign to
expand the center which has been
ongoing for several years. The
center, which currently boasts just
over one square foot of meeting
space per black undergraduate —
making commupity-wide meet
ings impossible at the center.
As a part of this campaign, the
BSU will hold a meeting at 7 p.m.
tonight in the BCSC to educate in
terested students about the issue.
Following the meeting, a petition
for students to show support for
the BCSC's desire for more space
will be placed online.
The current BCSC, which

serves the University's 597-stu
dent black undergraduate com
munity, occupies 1,401 square
feet of space, including 080
square feet of meeting space. The
center also houses a computer
cluster, a kitchen, a bathroom
and office space.
According to BSU Co-Chair
Kevin Dious, a junior, the BCSC is
too small for most activities. As an
example, Dious said that the BSU
holds most of its meetings in El
Centro Chicano.
"The black community has to
scuffle and struggle to find ade
quate meeting space," he said.
"It's impossible to put on pro
grams and have real
events ... As the number of
black students at Stanford rises,
the center has just not been ade
quate to meet [our] needs."
BCSC Program Coordinator
Amy Keith, a sophomore, noted
that the building currently does
not have enough space for stu
dents to use all the computers in its
cluster at once, and that the

BCSC's kitchen must double as its
storage closet.
"Stanford respects and high
lights its community centers
when trying to attract applicants,
but when it comes to funding
we're at the bottom of the totem
pole," Keith said. "A bigger, bet
ter black house will revitalize the
community. It will be great to
have a place where students can
have meetings and, more impor
tantly, truly call a home."
Awakuni said that the Office of
Student Activities is currently work
ing with a space-planning consul
tant to review the space needs for all
student activities on campus.
"1 recently learned about the
BCSC desire for additional space,"
he said. "Currently, there is no
space available for allocation to any
student group. There is a space
crunch on campus and many ex
isting units are already in over
crowded quarters. The prospect of
new space being built for student
use is probably pretty slim."
Dious said that the BCSC ex
pressed its interest in a new center
to the administration several years
ago. In particular, black commu
nity members hoped to move the
center to Building 505, recently
vacated by the Career Develop
ment Center.
"That would be the ideal place,"
Dious said. "If not [Building 505],
then expand the current center or
find us a new location that's not on
the outskirts of campus."
Despite the students' request,
the administration granted Build
ing 505 to the School of Education,
according to Dious.

ASSU Senator Michael Brown
11, a sophomore, said that the HSU
has decided to submit a written
proposal "once and for all" to "get
something back [from the admin
istration | in writing."
I lit* BSU is also asking ASSU
senators to sign the proposal as a
gesture of support.
Both Brown and Dions said
that they believed that the cam
paign also brought up the larger
issue of how centralized campus
space is allocated. According to
Blown, this issue will be of partic
ular importance in the coining
years as rooms in Old Union are
vacated, opening up centralized
space that Brown said he hoped
would go to students.
"I understand that the School
of Education is entitled to space,
but 1 think that it's more impor

tant for space at the heart of cam
pus to go to student activities,"
Dious said.
ASSU Senator Keenon De-
Vaughn, a junior, expressed hope
that students from the greater
Stanford community will become a
part of the campaign. I le said that
students should wear black today
to support the BCSC's campaign.
"People who are interested
can start writing opinions pieces
and letters to the editor support
ing the BSU," he said. "We want
the whole campus to be buzzing
and talking about it . . . The
other community centers under
stand that if one of us gets space,
then that's positive."
He concluded, "We want peo
ple to see that this is a Stanford stu
dent issue, not a black Stanford
student issue."

cluster at once, and that the

BCSC's kitchen must double as its
storage closet.
"Stanford respects and high
lights its community centers
when trying to attract applicants,
but when it comes to funding
we're at the bottom of the totem
pole," Keith said. "A bigger, bet
ter black house will revitalize the
community. It will be great to
have a place where students can
have meetings and, more impor
tantly, truly call a home."
Awakuni said that the Office of
Student Activities is currently work
ing with a space-planning consul
tant to review the space needs for all
student activities on campus.
"1 recently learned about the
BCSC desire for additional space,"
he said. "Currently, there is no
space available for allocation to any
student group. There is a space
crunch on campus and many ex
isting units are already in over
crowded quarters. The prospect of
new space being built for student
use is probably pretty slim."
Dious said that the BCSC ex
pressed its interest in a new center
to the administration several years
ago. In particular, black commu
nity members hoped to move the
center to Building 505, recently
vacated by the Career Develop
ment Center.
"That would be the ideal place,"
Dious said. "If not [Building 505],
then expand the current center or
find us a new location that's not on
the outskirts of campus."
Despite the students' request,
the administration granted Build
ing 505 to the School of Education,
according to Dious.

ASSU Senator Michael Brown
11, a sophomore, said that the HSU
has decided to submit a written
proposal "once and for all" to "get
something back [from the admin
istration | in writing."
I lit* BSU is also asking ASSU
senators to sign the proposal as a
gesture of support.
Both Brown and Dions said
that they believed that the cam
paign also brought up the larger
issue of how centralized campus
space is allocated. According to
Blown, this issue will be of partic
ular importance in the coining
years as rooms in Old Union are
vacated, opening up centralized
space that Brown said he hoped
would go to students.
"I understand that the School
of Education is entitled to space,
but 1 think that it's more impor

tant for space at the heart of cam
pus to go to student activities,"
Dious said.
ASSU Senator Keenon De-
Vaughn, a junior, expressed hope
that students from the greater
Stanford community will become a
part of the campaign. I le said that
students should wear black today
to support the BCSC's campaign.
"People who are interested
can start writing opinions pieces
and letters to the editor support
ing the BSU," he said. "We want
the whole campus to be buzzing
and talking about it . . . The
other community centers under
stand that if one of us gets space,
then that's positive."
He concluded, "We want peo
ple to see that this is a Stanford stu
dent issue, not a black Stanford
student issue."
Representatives from the Black
Student Union hope to meet with
Provost John Etchemendy and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni on Dec. 6 to submit
a proposal requesting more space
for the 30-year-old Black Commu
nity Services Center. This propos
al is the last step in a campaign to
expand the center which has been
ongoing for several years. The
center, which currently boasts just
over one square foot of meeting
space per black undergraduate —
making commupity-wide meet
ings impossible at the center.
As a part of this campaign, the
BSU will hold a meeting at 7 p.m.
tonight in the BCSC to educate in
terested students about the issue.
Following the meeting, a petition
for students to show support for
the BCSC's desire for more space
will be placed online.
The current BCSC, which

serves the University's 597-stu
dent black undergraduate com
munity, occupies 1,401 square
feet of space, including 080
square feet of meeting space. The
center also houses a computer
cluster, a kitchen, a bathroom
and office space.
According to BSU Co-Chair
Kevin Dious, a junior, the BCSC is
too small for most activities. As an
example, Dious said that the BSU
holds most of its meetings in El
Centro Chicano.
"The black community has to
scuffle and struggle to find ade
quate meeting space," he said.
"It's impossible to put on pro
grams and have real
events ... As the number of
black students at Stanford rises,
the center has just not been ade
quate to meet [our] needs."
BCSC Program Coordinator
Amy Keith, a sophomore, noted
that the building currently does
not have enough space for stu
dents to use all the computers in its
cluster at once, and that the

BCSC's kitchen must double as its
