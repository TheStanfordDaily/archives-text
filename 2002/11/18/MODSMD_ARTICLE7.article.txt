# Budget cuts may not hurt research
## Most research at University is funded by government and outside grants 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Wiiile faculty and administrators are
bracing for another round ofbudget cuts
and scrambling to "belt-tighten" without
endangering the primary functions of

the University, the one thing they may
not have to be too concerned about is en
suring that Stanford maintains its ability
to perform an elite research university's
primary task: research.
Primarily because the vast majority of
University research is funded by sources
outside of Stanford, the anticipated 8
percent cut in the general funds budget
for the upcoming fiscal year will not
have much influence of the ability of fac
ulty and students to conduct their re
search. In recent years, money flowing

into the University to carry out research
has actually increased by as much as 10
percent, and, despite questions about
the stability of the nation's economy,
there's a good chance that some of the
University's major sources of funding
will actually increase their contributions
in the coming years.
Yet while the majority of Stanford's
research is conducted without help from
the University's general funds or in-
come from I he endowment, those
facets of the University that re
ceive less outside funding — par
ticularly the humanities and social
sciences — may be hit harder than
others, and the University ofiices
that help (acuity and students pro
cure funding are also facing the
reality of significant cuts in avail
able funds. Furthermore, there is
no guarantee that the priorities or
financial conditions of the Univer
sity's outside sponsors will remain
stable if the political and econom
ic landscape of the United States
continues to change.
Charles Kruger, dean of re
search and graduate policy, said
that the budget cuts should not hin
der faculty or student scholarship.
"There are two kinds of
things," Kruger said. "There are
the administrative resources for
research, and, just as with any
other sort of support, budget cuts
will put some pressure on those.
"Then, there is scholarship and
research that is done indepen
dently on sponsored projects,
gifts, etc. that is not effected by
budget cuts."
Kruger explained that some
funds from the budgets of the
University's seven schools are put
toward research or financing
teaching, but said he "didn't
think that there is much pressure
on the scholarship on the faculty
and students coming from the
budget cuts."
Although the University un
derwent a 5 percent cut in its gen
eral funds budget last year, the
amount of money Stanford re
ceived from outside sources in the
form of contracts and grants for
sponsored projects increased
from 2001 to 2002 by over 11 per
cent from $722,341,125.58 to
$804,038,850.82.

a combination of research, in
struction, administration and
other activities, but encompasses
research funded by outside grants
that are applied for individually
by faculty and students. Last year's
more than $800,000-dollar in
crease in sponsored projects was
the biggest percentage increase in
the last 10 years.
"These are what we call 're
stricted funds,' not general Uni
versity funds flowing from the en
dowment or gifts," said Geoff
Grant, associate vice president for
research administration. " These
are restricted, sponsored funds
that for the most part are entirely
unaffected by [budget cuts]."
Approximately 85 percent of
sponsored projects at Stan lord are
funded by the U.S. government,
making much of the University's
research dependent not as much
upon the ups and downs of the
economy as on the priorities of
Congress.
For example, increases in the
budget of the Department of
Health and Human Services,
which is home to the National In
stitutes of Health, has translated to
about an extra $20 million per
year coming into the University
for research. NIH-sponsored pro
jects totaled over $245 million in
2002, over 30 percent of money
coming into Stanford from gov
ernment sources. Congress is also
considering doubling the budget
of the National Science Founda
tion, an agency that provided

Stanford with over $47 million in
2002.
The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center, funded by the Depart
ment of Fnergy, accounts for over
one-fourth of sponsored projects
financed by the government
amounting to $230 million in
2002 — and is often considered
separately from the rest of the
University's sponsored projects.
Research at Stanford is also not
immune to the reality of the inter
national political climate, either.
Funding for research on "bio-de
fense," or research on bioterror
ism, has flooded into the Universi
ty in the last several years, Grant
said, and government interest in
projects in engineering, medicine
and the basic sciences might shift il
the United States finds itself at war
in the upcoming months.
"This is an uncertain period ...
These worldwide events can affei I
research," Grant said. "The
Homeland Security Department
and any potential war could ailed
budget priorities and could ailed
research."
While funds from government
sponsored projects increased by
10.4(5 percent from 2001 to 2002,
private-sector donations showed
an even greater relative gain
16.79 percent, or approximately
$15 million. Money in sponsored
projects from corporations rose
last year after peaking in 2000 and
falling by nearly 15 percent in
2001, a decrease that can be attrib
uted to the burst of the stock mar
ket bubble in 2000.
Funding from charitable foun
dations, state and local govern
ments and private foundations all
showed increases between 10 and
20 percent, and 112 unding from cor
porate foundations increased by
overfl million, a 72 percent gain.
Research in those areas where
outside funding is less forthcom
ing, specifically the humanities
and social sciences, will most likely
led (he greatest effects ot the bud
get ( ins. In 2002, the School of
I Iiimanities ancl Sciences received
$57.7 million of the $804 million
coming into the University from
sponsored projects. Of that total,
approximately $50.5 million went
toward sponsored research, and
ol that money, about $45.5 million
was for research in the physical
sciences. ()l the remaining $4.98
million for the humanities and so
cial sciences, l million went to
the psychology department.
"In the humanities generally
there has been much less money
available," (Irani said, noting that
education also has a harder time
finding funding for research.
As a result, a larger portion of
funding for humanities research
tomes from gifts or University
general funds.
"The sponsored projects,
which is a defined term, are large
ly in science and engineering,"
Kruger said. "The support for the
humanities tends to be from a dif
ferent kind," be added, citing gifts
from the Mellon Foundation, for
example, that were used to fund
research in the humanities.
Yet a less robust economy can
also often translate into a decrease
in these donations from outside
sources.
"1 can't tell you specifically how
those dollars are compared to last
year — I would assume that they
will not be immune from the
down pressure of general giving
across the board," said Associate
Vice President for Development
Bob Pringle. "There's a lot of at
tention on development to see if
we can help lill the gap."

For areas of the University
I hat have a greater dependence
on gifts and University funds, the
budget cuts may furl her compli
cate the task of submitting re
vised budgets that accommodate
5, 7.5 or 10 percent cuts in gen
eral funds.
"In addition to the research
funding received from spon
sored projects, the Dean's Office
and all departments also use a
combination of general funds,
gifts and endowment income to
provide additional research and
scholarship support," said Jim
I lenry, director of finance for hu
manities and sciences. "H&S be
lieves that scholarship and re
search are essential parts of Stan
lord ;iikl of the school, so main
taining this support will be a very
high priority as we develop our
[fiscal year) '03 / '04 budget.
"The school is still exploring
budget options, but will first focus
on ways to maximize use of fund
flows and balances throughout
the school in order to minimize re
ductions in research funding or
other areas."
Nonetheless, faculty concerns
regarding the budget cuts, even
for those in the humanities and
social sciences, have not centered
on research.
"There are little pots of money
here and there in the University
that you can apply for," said Sociol
ogy Prof. Cecilia Ridgeway. "[But]
pretty much it's outside founda
tions and government grants."
She added, "I haven't person
ally been interpreting these bud
get cuts at the University as threat
ening access to research funds,
and I think my colleagues feel the
same way."
