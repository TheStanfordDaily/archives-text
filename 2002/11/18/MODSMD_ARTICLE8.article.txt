# On Wednesdays, while most GSB students hit the books, others are...

Monday, wash day; Tuesday, ironing day; Wednesday,
Golf Day?
For perhaps as long as 40 years, Wednesdays have been in
formally termed "Golf Day" by members of the Graduate
School of Business. Unlike most business schools, Stanford's
GSB has no classes on Wednesdays. Many students use this
mid-week break to get over to the Stanford Golf Course and
practice their swing.

"There are certainly more Business School students
on Wednesdays," affirmed assistant pro Ed Bernhart.
"There's absolutely no doubt about it."

According to Bernhart's calculations, 35 of the 200
golfers on Wednesday, Oct. 6 were from GSB. He

estimated that this number was lower than

usual because of the forecasted rainstorm.
"There's always a pretty regular

crowd of GSB students," Bernhart
said. "Some play more than once

a week.
"Wednesdays are par
ticularly tight. Peoplecan ,
start signing up for tee ||
times at 6:30 in the morn
ing, and by 6:35 all of the

times have already been taken."
However, GSB student Brian O'Hara
was quick to stress that not all of his class
mates treat Wednesdays as an opportuni
ty to play golf.
"1 think if you asked GSB students if
Wednesday was Golf Day, a large majority
of the answers would range from 'Nope' to
'1 wish,'" O'Hara said. "Despite the fact
that the Business School doesn't generally
have classes on Wednesday, it is often one
of the busiest days of the week for some
people."
O'Hara pointed out that most top
MBA programs have one day in the i
week without classes: Kellog Business
School at Northwestern also has no I
dass on Wednesday, whereas liar- 4
vard's free day is Friday. '

Stanford students use their day off to work together on as
signments and engage in community service projects.
"The Business School emphasizes group work far more
than any part of the University," said Asst. Prof, of Economics
Justin Wolfers. "Our hope on (he faculty side is that Wednes
days are used for group work."
"Almost every class throughout the two-year program in
volves group meetings of some sort," O'l lara said. "Since peo
ple's schedules are so busy and varied throughout most of the
week, many of these group meetings tend to take place on
Wednesdays."

Community service projects include I Have a Dream,
Challenge for Charity, Board Fellows and Start-Up.

MBA students participating in I Have a

Dream serve as mentors to local lower in
come school districts. In Challenge for
Charity, they help out at local events for the

Special Olympics. Students in Board Fellows
serve on the board of a local non-profit compa
ny. Start-Up matches GSB students with local
entrepreneurs in lower income neighbor
hoods.

"Wednesday is not quite the mid-week
vacation that it's perceived to be," O'Hara
said.

Lisa Schwallie, associate director for
the MBA Program, had a similar take on
the matter.

"Most Business School students will tell
you that Wednesdays are one of their
most busy, study-packed days," she said.

Brad Nabors, GSB c lass of '04, had
looked forward to having more free time.
"1 can't speak for the second-years,
but us first-years are pretty overwhelmed
in the fall quarter," Nabors said.
Nabors hasn't played golf since before
the initial Orientation on Sept. 9, though
he's hoping he'll have some opportunities
in the spring.

"My first five Wednesdays were ab
solutely packed solid," Nabors said. "I think I
haveovercommitted as well, and I have a wife
and a daughter, so I have trouble just keeping
up with my readings and assignments."

Nabors was excited by the
prospect of an only half-full
Wednesday coming up, as he
might finally have a chance to get
over to the golf course.
"I am an avid golfer!" he ex
claimed. "Or at least I was until
eight weeks ago."
