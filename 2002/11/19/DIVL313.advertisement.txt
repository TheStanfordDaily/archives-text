Dear Members and Friends of the Stanford and Berkeley Communities:
On November 23, 2002, Stanford and Cal will square off in the 105 th annual
Big Game at Memorial Stadium, an event that has become a Bay Area tradi
tion. Our two universities share a strong football and academic heritage as
well as a spirited and storied rivalry.
This continues to be a trying time for our campus communities, the Bay Area,
and the nation. It is all the more fitting, then, that the traditional goal of the
Big Game be reinforced this year: a spirited competition on the field and an
enjoyable experience for those in the stands.
Unfortunately, there have been years in which the spirit of Big Game has been
dampened by the irresponsible behavior of some that resulted in injuries and
property damage. Most recently, though, fans on both sides have enjoyed the
game without resorting to dangerous behavior. We ask that you build on that
recent tradition and refrain from engaging in malicious "pranks" or other activ
ities that may draw law enforcement and security personnel and resources away
from responding to more pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big Game should not have to fear for their
safety; therefore, we must emphasize that fans who engage in incidents of field
trespass, physical assault and/or property damage will be ejected from the stadi
um. Students found responsible for these types of activities will face discipli
nary action at their respective institutions; such action may include suspension
or dismissal.
Please respect more than a century of Big Game tradition and celebrate your
school spirit, pride and sportsmanship in a safe, positive and friendly manner.
Enjoy the game!
Sincerely,
John L. Hennessy
President
Stanford University
