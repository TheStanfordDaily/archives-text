I take another swijj; of my Vodka on t lie- Shlocks
id divert my gaze to the left lor a sight so shockingly
beautiful I almost spew the vile liquid all over the black-painted walls. It's
none other than the love of my lile, walking in the door in a tube top and
combat boots. It's Kavana Wang, center ol my soul, Cleopatra ol my
chemistry class, heart of inv heart and the sexiest l'( )A in all ol I arzana High.
This could get ugly. But don't worry, Sander's got it under control.
Sander's got evervthing under control. I m lulling, very soon, the lovely and
intelligent Ravana.
So let's rec ap. I'm inside the Teacup Trance with an angry lesbian on one
side, a bad punk band onstage preparing to strum the stuffing out of my
sensitive, cultured eardrums, and the most beautiful woman in the entire
world is sitting like the clxmy-taloned bird of pray-lbr-your-lile-you-don't
la 11-in-love- wit li-th i s-o n e-ca use-she's-go n na-tear-you-u p-like-an
incriminating-document that she is on the edge ol a busted barstool.
Furthermore, in case you've forgotten, I'm in deep trouble for the
magical mcssuplast night in the Gabriels, and Mandv's holding me down like
the lid on ;i blender till she gels an explanation. Preferably a nice smooth one
with strawberry banana flavoring. And I've also deeply dented the valor and
the vehicle of a prick in a gold l-exus, who is bound to be following me, and
I've probably got only about live minutes to make tny getaway.
I try to wave at Ravana - she's entirely ignoring me, lost in her cloud of
bait and self-possession - but Mandv's holding both inv hands behind my
back and twisting her nails in. She wants me to talk. But I in not talking.
Suddenly I hear a screech, see a flash of gold through the spray-painted
window, and a skinny white wino in a Silver Nitrate T-shirt steps out from the
driver's seal. He's holding something in his left hand that might be a squill
gun. Or it might be a real one. Frankly, the angle of viewing isn't all one
would desire, but regardless, we're in some crap — level and density of
which yet to be determined by passing sound waves through the mass of it
and observing the rate of transmission, but make no mistake, the c rap
nonetheless.
That's when I have the most brilliant idea since the Nina, the I'inta, and
the Santa Maria decided to take Plymouth Rock to Jamaica or whatever the
hell. Spain. F.ugland. Puritans. I've never quite understood how that worked
out. But the sheer brilliance of the conception, the arrogance of the action, is
what I want you to fix your mind upon.
In one fluid motion, I shake Mandy oil, stand up from the couch, walk
straight over to Ravana, grab her arm and pull her up from the barstool.
She stands so straight she looks like a marble pillar and looks straight in
my eyes like I better have a good explanation or she's letting down the whole
Coliseum on my freshly minted hairdo.
Eleven words, baby. Eleven words.
"We've got to get out of here. I'm taking you home."
SI.AMI Oh baby oh baby, and we're out the door in one of tny c lassic
elegant getaways, we are in the car and the door is sltul and buc kle your
seatbelt cause we are ()l I'l and chugging turquoise smoke like you wouldn't
believe. Lexus Boy swivels in Ins stance to see us dying away. He fires a
parting shot at /.eta's tires, but she dodges them like the sexy dancer she is,
and we are Gone.

window, and a skinny white wino in a Silver Nitrate T-shirt steps out from the
driver's seal. He's holding something in his left hand that might be a squill
gun. Or it might be a real one. Frankly, the angle of viewing isn't all one
would desire, but regardless, we're in some crap — level and density of
which yet to be determined by passing sound waves through the mass of it
and observing the rate of transmission, but make no mistake, the c rap

That's when I have the most brilliant idea since the Nina, the I'inta, and
the Santa Maria decided to take Plymouth Rock to Jamaica or whatever the
hell. Spain. F.ugland. Puritans. I've never quite understood how that worked

In one fluid motion, I shake Mandy oil, stand up from the couch, walk
straight over to Ravana, grab her arm and pull her up from the barstool.

SI.AMI Oh baby oh baby, and we're out the door in one of tny c lassic
elegant getaways, we are in the car and the door is sltul and buc kle your
seatbelt cause we are ()l I'l and chugging turquoise smoke like you wouldn't
believe. Lexus Boy swivels in Ins stance to see us dying away. He fires a
parting shot at /.eta's tires, but she dodges them like the sexy dancer she is,
and we are Gone.
