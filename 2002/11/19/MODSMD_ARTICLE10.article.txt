came to hear speeches from representatives of
local non-profit organizations on domestic issues
that rally organizers fear are being overlooked by
students.
"Right now there is a lot of focus on the im
pending war in Iraq,justifiably, but we need to be
conscious of the ongoing war going on here at
home, which is the war against the poor and mar
ginalized in our own society," said senior Jessica
Jenkins, one of the organizers of the event. "We
are inviting people to come to get a glimpse of the
human face of poverty."
The event is part of a national week of aware
ness, organized by the National Coalition for the
Homeless.
Among the speakers present for the rally were
United Christian Campus Ministries Head Jim

Burklo, Ecumenical Hunger Program Director
Nevida Butler, Ecumenial 1 lunger Program As
sistant Director Maleah (-hoi, Urban Ministry of
Palo Alto Program Director Don Jensen, James
Tracy from the San Francisco Coalition on
Homelessness ancl Norm Carroll, homeless resi
dent of Palo Alto and "Street Forum" columnist.
The speakers discussed their involvement in
working to alleviate hunger ancl homelessness
and pushed students to engage themselves in
combating these issues.
Jensen explained, " The biggest problems
facing the homeless today are affordable hous
ing, health care, finding jobs with decent wages
and transportation." I le also thanked Stanford
students for their service to the community
through student groups like Night Outreach
and the Stanford Project on Hunger, or
SPOON, which cook and donate food to the
local homeless shelters.
Tracy also spoke about the large part that stu
dents play in the movement for social justice.
"It is all about who you choose to serve with the
degree you get from Stanford," he said. "Urban
planning studentscan either break up communi
ties or help them invaluably."

Carroll challenged students to capitalize on
their unique situation by taking action.
"Use your minds — you're the ones who can
change things," he said. "You don't know the
rules. You c an still break them out of ignorance."
