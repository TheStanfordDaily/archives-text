## Iranian regime clashes with students 
### 
TEH RAN, Iran (AP) — Fist lights broke out yes
terday between supporters oflran's Islamic regime
and university students who issued a rare public
criticism oflran's supreme leader during a rally in
support of a history professor sentenced to death
for insulting Islam.
The students organized the demonstration at
Sharif Technical University in Tehran to support
reformist scholar Hashem Aghajari. About 3,000
students chanted slogans calling for freedom of
speech and accusing hard-line clerics of thwarting
President Mohammad Khatami's political and so
cial reform programs.
Aghajari was sentenced to death by a court in
liamedan in western Iran on Nov. 0 after being
convicted of insulting Islam and questioning the
rule of hard-line clerics.
Iran's ruling clerics had been enraged by a
speech Aghajari gave in June in which he said that

each generation should be able to interpret Islam
on its own, without the guidance of clerics.
When the students criticized the supreme
leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei, and called fora ref
erendum to determine the country's reform pro
grams, about 700 supporters of the regime who
were standing by rushed the student demonstra
tors and began throwing punches.
Police stood guard outside the university to
keep passers-by away from the rally but did not
intervene in the melee. The number of injuries
was not clear, but students were seen carrying
colleagues away.
Aghajari's case has heightened tensions in the
power struggle between reformists — many of
them students — who seek more social and polit
ical freedoms, and Islamic hard-liners, who con
trol the police, judiciary and other levers of
power.
