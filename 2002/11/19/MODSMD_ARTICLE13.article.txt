BAG! I DAI), Iraq (AP) â€” U.N. arms inspectors re
turned to Iraq after a four-year hiatus yesterday, call
ing on President Saddam Hussein's government to
cooperate with their search for weapons of mass de
struction in the interest of peace. But Washington
said it already sees likely violations.
Chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix and about 30 in
spectors flew into the Iraqi capital aboard a white
cargo plane emblazoned with the black letters "U.N."
as allied warplanes bombed Iraqi air defense systems
in the northern no-fly/one. The U.S. military said the
jets were fired on during routine patrols.
At the White House, spokesman Scott McClellan
said yesterday the Iraqi anti-aircraft lire "appears to
be a violation" of the U.N. resolution that sent the in
spectors back to Iraq.
It was unclear whether other countries on the Se
curity Counc il would consider incidents in the no-fly
/.one serious enough to merit a response, because the
council never explicitly authorized the patrols. Iraq
considers such patrols a violation of its sovereignty
and frequently shoots at them. Defense Secretary
Donald 11. Rumsfeld, traveling in (lliile, said the Unit
ed States is waiting fora pattern of Iraqi misdeeds be
fore going back to the council.
I he return of the inspectors is widely seen as Sad
clam's last chance to avoid a devastating war with the
United States. President Bush has warned Saddam that
failure to cooperate with the inspectors will bring on an
American attack and that Washington will pursue a
policy of "zero tolerance" toward Iraqi infractions.
Saddam's deputy, Izzat Ibrahim, told the official
Iraqi News Agency that Iraq will work with inspectors
to protect its people from Americ a but will fight "il war
is imposed on us."
Eventually more than 220 inspectors from 49
countries will be deployed, although how many at any
one time would vary depending on what is required.
At least 30 inspectors are American, the largest na
tionality represented, and at least five are women.
