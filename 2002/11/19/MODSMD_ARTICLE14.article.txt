# Coalition sought to aid prisoners
## U.S. court rejects detention case 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court
yesterday rejected a challenge to the detention of 000
or so Afghan war prisoners at the Cuantanamo Bay
Naval Base, ruling that a group of clergy members
and professors have no legal standing to intervene.
I he Coalition of Clergy, Lawyers and Professors
sued on behalf of the prisoners, many of whom have
been held at the U.S. base in Cuba lor about a year.
I he lawsuit alleged they have been denied access to
lawyers and have been held without being charged, in
violation of the Constitution.
Ihe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to
address that issue, and instead ruled 3-0 that the cler
gy do not have legal standing to seek redress for the
prisoners.
I he court declined to rule on whether individual
prisoners could bring their own cases.
"Without allowing this lawsuit, there's no way to pro
tect the rights of these individuals," said Erwin
Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California law
professor who brought the lawsuit. "The reality is
you're dealing with people from another country,
whose family may not even know where they are or may
not have the resources to hire an American lawyer."
Ihe government says the U.S. courts have no
power over American military policy being carried
out in a foreign nation as part of the war on terrorism.
The coalition asserted that Cuantanamo Bay is Amer
ican territory, and that rights under the Constitution
therefore apply.
I he decision upheld a ruling by a Los Angeles fed
eral in February.
In August, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotel
ly of Washington, D.C., ruled in a similar case that sus
pected Taliban and al-Qaida fighters held in Cuba
have no right to U.S. court hearings, meaning the mil
itary can hold them indefinitely without filing charges.
In that case, involving two Britons, an Australian
and 12 detained Kuwaitis, the judge said the prison
ers are not in the United States and thus do not fall
under the jurisdiction of federal courts.
