## The 						Stanford Daily Law School dean should restore attorney's mentorship 
### 
Published Since J 891

On Nov. 8, Law School Dean Kath
leen M. Sullivan released a state
ment rescinding the Law School's
offer of a visiting mentorship to
New York criminal defense attorney Lynne
Stewart. Sullivan's unacceptable decision
undermines the academic value of free ex
pression, and the way in which Stewart was
notified about the decision was disrespect
ful as well. We urge Sullivan to apologize to
Stewart and reinstate her as a David W.
Mills Public Interest Mentor as soon as
possible.
According to Sullivan, she revoked the
position because Stewart "has expressed
sympathy for and tacit endorsement of the
use of directed violence to achieve social
change." For Sullivan to deny a mentor
ship solely because she disagrees with

Stewart's political views sets a dangerous
precedent. Even more unfortunate is that
Sullivan's statement was based on a quote
Stewart made in the New York Times seven
years ago, a quote Stewart says was taken
out of context.
Stanford's professors have a range of po
litical views, and the University rightfully al
lows them to express their views. Stanford
even has professors who support the possi
ble war in Iraq, which can be argued en
dorses the "use of directed violence to
achieve social change." Would Sullivan deny
those professors from teaching because of
their political beliefs?
Furthermore, Stewart wasn't even invited
to Stanford because of her political views;
she was going to mentor students in her ca
pacity as a lawyer who has defended some

unpopular clients, like Sheikh Omar Abdel
Rahman, who was convicted for plotting the
1993 World Trade Center bombing. Sulli
van's decision disregarded the wishes of
many law students in the public interest pro
gram who were eagerly anticipating Stew
art's arrival. Many students were extremely
pleased with the informal mentoring ses
sions that Stewart held when she visited the
campus two weeks ago.
The manner in which Sullivan rescinded
the mentorship was inappropriate as well.
The Law School offered Stewart the position
in July, three months after Stewart was in
dicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on
charges that she illegally helped Rahman
communicate with an Egyptian militant or
ganization, charges which Stewart denies.
Considering Stewart's case had already re-

ceived national media attention when she
was hired by the Law School tliis summer, it
seems odd that Sullivan would wait until the
week Stewart arrived on campus to rescind
Stewart's position.
Some students claim that Sullivan buckled
to outside pressure. Or perhaps a petition
signed by 64 Law School students — none of
whom were part of" the public interest pro
gram — opposing Stewart's mentorship
might have influenced the last-minute deci
sion. Either way, Sullivan should have stood
by her initial offer instead of sending Stewart
a fax to her hotel room revoking the position
the day she arrived to Stanford.
Sullivan's legal and academic work indi
cate that she is a staunch supporter of free
dom of speech. If that's true, she should
allow Stewart to mentor at the Law School.
