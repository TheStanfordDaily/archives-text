# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Dave gets political 
### 
Being a guy with long hair means
that people usually assume
something about me. Letting my
freak flag fly means some people
assume I'm a freak. Sometimes people as
sume that I'm a pothead (which I'm not,
by any stretch of the imagination), but
mostly people guess that I'm a liberal hip
pie sympathizer. And that's OR with me. I
like to picture myself at the helm of a new
revolution that picks up where my parents
left off, this time combining a real political
agenda with the money, power and prag
matism that their kids now have.
My dad's new fear in life is that I'm
going to end up spending seven years at

Stanford getting a law
degree and come out a
legal aid lawyer. He'd be
proud of me, but, well,
the decade of tuition
might be a little bit of a
problem if I do every
thing pro bono. But I
don't really think that'll
happen. I have too

much hope fora future where I make
lots of money when I'm young, enough
to make an early retirement and a cushy
life a reality.
How disgustingly capitalistic of a goal is
that? It's the American dream, and I think
it's what I want, but at the same time,
wouldn't it be nice to spend my life as a
poor idealistic fool, feeding people in
Third World countries?
I get this feeling that because the '60s
happened, our generation feels like we
don't need to be radical for another few
decades — like they did everything that
needed to be done. But that's not true by a
long shot. How is it possible that we still
don't have an equal rights amendment for
women? Why is it that no state in the
union allows gay marriages? I low is it that
we still treat marijuana possession like a
crime against humanity, with stauncher
penalties than for murderers, and hemp is
treated like a plague upon our nation.
Our body of laws isn't getting more liber
al, they're getting more restrictive. The
USA Patriot Act scares me more than 'The
Ring." And as a geek, I wonder how it's
possible that we're watching our fair use
rights be stripped away. But, at the same
time, who the hell cares whether or not
I'm allowed to watch a DVI) when there
are people dying around the world?
If I'm going to be spending my blood,
sweat and tears on a good cause, shouldn't I
be doing things of greater social impor
tance? Not just protecting my already fairly
cushy rights as an American citizen, but
bringing freedoms to women worldwide?
Should I be attacking the World Trade
Organization? Or should I ignore that and
just worry about delivering pure drinking
water to people who don't have it? And as
an American, should I focus myself back
home and worry more about those in Palo

Alto living below the poverty line?
Isn't social inequity a mandatory part of
capitalism? Won't we always need Deltas
and Epsilons cleaning bathrooms and
serving fast food? I'm too much of a cynic
to ever call for socialism. I believe the
human condition will never allow it to
flourish. We're all too greedy and too lazy.
But at the same time, something inside of
me says it's a human right for people to
not need to struggle for survival. And that
it's a human duty to provide for the less
fortunate.
Do I have any right to be eating a steak
at a fancy restaurant? Do I have any right
to own more than one computer? Do we
have any right to be spending a small for
tune being educated at Stanford? Should 1
drop out and convince my parents to take
half the money they would've spent on tu
ition and donate it to charity and spend
the other half supporting me while I wan
der around the globe in search of some
thing good to do with my life?
Where to begin? There's so much
wrong here at home and so much in the
world, and it overwhelms me to the point
of paralysis. There are days 1 can't figure
out how to start cleaning my room , so
where do 1 start in my battle to solve all the
world's problem? Because I won't be con
tent unless I can fix everything. Just a little
isn't enough for me.
Or should I stop worrying about my fel
low human beings and start worrying
about my kids? I somehow expected that
the whole pollution thing would've re
solved itself by now. For some reason I had
this naive belief that eventually the envi
ronmental situation would become too
dire, and the world would stop fighting,
and we'd get together and stop burning
down the rain forest. Yes, I really can be
this idealistic sometimes. Bui the fact that
we aren't even acknowledging these prob
lems makes me depressed enough to be
lieve that there's no point in believing in
them at all.
Before I decide to start solving any of
the world's problems, shouldn't I turn
off all my computers, stop using paper
towels and become a vegetarian? Aren't I
just spouting hypocrisy at the top of my
lungs if I 'm not willing to give up my lux
uries for my ideals? It's not like I'm do
nating HO percent of my income to char
ity — I'm saving up fora new stereo sys
tem and maybe a car. Looking at my
wants and my actions, I wonder if there's
any self preservation instinct left in the
human race?
Where to begin to attempt change?
When do we stop consuming and start do
nating? I can't decide. Can you?
