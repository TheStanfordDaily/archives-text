Police should 'find something better to
do' than fine bikers
In response to the Nov. 15 letter, "Turn
on your bike light," which requests that cam
pus police "crack down" harder on students
without bike lights, I must say the whole sit
uation is farcical. (Campus police should real
ly find something better to do at night than
set up traps to catch these "flagrant" light
less bikers. I have been stopped twice by
campus police, while riding in an area com
pletely devoid of cars, and given citations for
having no bike light and no "bike license."
When 1 asked the officer exactly what
constitutes a "bike license" he told me that I
must go to the Department of Transporta
tion and pay $3.50 to get my bike license or
appear in court. A bike license, which re
quires of me no skill other than my ability to
pay these people $3.50 sounds like a mafia
right, if I ever heard of one.
Stanford students are smart, and if they
choose for whatever reason not to equip
their bikes with lights, so be ii. The under
lying assumption behind the bike light de
bate is that sacrificing individual liberty for
the sake of security is okay. I hat's just crazy.
Campus police should really move some
units to East Palo Alto rather I ban spending
their time making Stanford students feel
like criminals. Stop the reign of terror!

'No simple answer' for student
meeting space issues
Useless statistics will not gel more meet
ing space built on campus. Yesterday's
Daily stated that the Black Community
Services Center boasts just 1 .4 square leet
of meeting space per black undergraduate

student ("Students seek bigger BCSC").
The number by itself means very little
without something to compare it to. How
many Asian undergraduates are there per
square foot of meeting space at the Asian
American Activities Center? How many
Mexican Americans per square foot at El
Centro Chicano? Can you imagine all the
women on campus jammed into the first
floor of the Fire Truck House?
I completely support the BCSC in its
quest for more space and wish them well in
their meeting with Provost Etchemendy
and Vice Provost Awakuni in December.
The provost and vice provost are sympa
thetic, decent and resourceful leaders try
ing to balance many needs during a bud
getary challenge. The call for more meet
ing space will need to come from every cor
ner of the campus to gel their attention.
Not just from the HSU. Not just from the
minority centers. Over the last few years, al
most every dorm on campus has lost meet
ing and study space to house students. That
trend will not reverse itself . There is no sim
ple answer. Money is tight and pragmatic
suggestions for attainable solutions are
rare. 1 would like to see The Stanford Daily
combine some investigative journalism
with public service and offer a forum for
some of those pragmatic suggestions. The
rest of us have to supply the suggestions.
The Daily should give us some more
facts to mull over. Call Jeanette Smith-
Laws, the director of Meeting Services and
find out at what percent of capacity the
available spaces at Tresidder are booked.
Call the University Architect / Planning
Office and find out if there is any new stu
dent meeting space in the planning stage.
I'hen let us know what you learn.

Decision to rescind Stewart's invitation
'reflects a clear bias and
double standard'
I am writing in response to your Nov. 15
article, "Law clean rescinds offer to attor
ney," about the controversial invitation to
noted defense attorney Lynne Stewart to
serve as a mentor to public interest law stu
dents. Stewart was invited NOT because of
any statements she allegedly made regard
ing directed violence — statements that she
says have been taken out of context. She
was invited because she is the first attorney
to be indicted under the post-Sept. 11 U.S.
Patriot Act for refusing to disclose to the
government the contents of confidential at
torney-client communications. She was also
invited to speak about the experience of
being an advocate for despised criminal de
fendants. In addition to being Sheikh Rah
man's court-appointed attorney, she has
defended members of the mafia and others
in her long career.
I strongly oppose the Law School's ac
tion. 1 should make clear at the outset that
1 do not at all agree with advocating vio
lence— that's why 1 oppose Stewart's con
troversial remarks as well as President
Bush's rabid hunger for war on Iraq. Like
wise, I was not interested in mentoring
sessions with Stewart, as I hope to work for
the district attorney's office after gradua
tion. However, 1 am deeply troubled by
the chilling effect of the decision on aca
demic discourse, as well as the dean blam
ing the Law School's director of the public
interest program for the controversy.
Dean Kathleen Sullivan's decision to re
scind the mentoring offer for fear of it ap
pealing to endorse Stewart's remarks re
flects a clear bias and double standard. The
school has honored alumnus Warren
Christopher, despite his statements at a I .aw
School panel where he explicitly endorsed
political assassination as a legitimate tool of
statecraft. Sullivan's decision was made
without any input from or conversations
with public interest students and faculty, but

instead after receiving pressure from
wealthy donors and conservative students.
Stewart was scrutinized on account of
her speech. The dean's decision sounds the
alarm that dissent from mainstream hege
mony is unwelcome. Worse yet, the decision
to restrict Stewart's platform was made by
none other than Sullivan, a self-proclaimed
champion of tree speech and the 112 ree ex
change of ideas — at least in her casebooks
and Supreme Court arguments. Her be
trayal of the tenets of dissident speech is es
pecially devastating to the 112 uture of present

ing controversial ideas at Stanford or other
schools. Historically, universities are a place
where contentions ideas can be discussed,
debated and evaluated — especially during
times of national crisis. Sadly, it appears that
the Law School has been co-opted by the
same forces that argue for unquestioned ad
herence to the unconstitutional dictates of
"national security."
Finally, I write to condemn any puni
tive measures that Dean Sullivan may
take against Eduardo Capulong, the di
rector of the public interest program. He

has been unfairly and falsely blamed for
inviting Stewart without adequate consul
tation, which is not true. Capulong and
his public interest program have greatly
enriched the Law School community for
all students and staff. Furthermore, his
dedication and support of students seek
ing to work in public service is amazing,
and reminds us why we went to law school
in the first place.
