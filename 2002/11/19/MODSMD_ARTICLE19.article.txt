# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## U.S. actions in Iraq could have far-reaching consequences 
### PHILIPPE BUC GUEST COLUMNIST 
It is too early to predict whether Ameri
ca will go to war in Iraq. But it is not too
late to speculate how an American mili
tary action will be perceived in the broader
Middle hast and beyond, absent any con
comitant diplomatic breakthrough on the
Israeli-Palestinian question. The History
Department is organizing an academic
teach-in today that will try to place the crisis
with Iraq in historical perspective; I want to
volunteer here some additional reflections
— a view from the edge of the Arab world.
1 have just returned from Morocco. Until
recently, this geographically westernmost
corner of the Arab-Muslim world was ar
guably a firm and safe ally of the United
States and a mediator between Israel and the
Middle East's frontline states. This all may
change. A research project led me to discuss
international polity issues with Moroccan in
tellectuals and public figures, as well as with
the man in the street. The ordinary Moroc
can — taxi driver, street vendor, shopkeep
er, student — readily will ask a customer or
chance encounter what he thinks about the
Middle East and quickly emote about both
the Palestinian question and the U.S. in
volvement with Iraq. Intellectuals and peo
ple of substance enter discussion very cau
tiously. Many in these groups have a vested
interest in presenting the best face possible to
Europeans and Americans — what they be
lieve the West wants to see and hear.
At a dinner, a businessman seated oppo

site from me, upon hearing that I was work
ing on a volume on Sept. 11, immediately
proclaimed, "We Moroccans universally re
prove what happened." But once the West
erner makes clear that lie or she does not
buy this simplifying fiction, a real debate
can begin. Caution works multi-directional
ly — these elites do not readily condemn
Sept. 11 in public, before an Arab audience,
for they know the people's feelings. The
U.S. Embassy, I was told, listens too much
to the cautious set, and does not take the
temperature of the so-called "Arab street."
If this is true, U.S. decision makers are
working on the basis of flawed data when
they try to evaluate possible reactions of the
Arabs to an intervention in Iraq. They are
all the more distant from what New York
Times columnist Tom Friedman has called
the "Arab basement" — the hidden groups
that so actively hate the U.S. that, given a
chance, they would strike against it. And an
intervention in Iraq risks turning America's
friends into neutrals, neutrals into America
haters and America haters to active haters.
Otherwise put, convert those who might
have acted against potential terrorists into
passive observers, those who might have
been passive into abettors, and those who
were passive helpers of terrorism into live
human bombs. I have met officers and petty
officers, men filled with admiration for the
United States soldiers who they trained
with, wondering in anger at American for
eign policy. Anger can become hatred.
"How does one say 'merci in Arabic?" To
this puzzling question — puzzling because

obvious answers like "shukran" or "baraka
Inujik" were dismissed haughtily by the
questioner, the questioner had a lightning
answer: "In Arabic, one says bin Laden.' "
This chance street conversation — the par
ties did not know one another — conveys
why bin Laden is a hero, not only to the
basement, but to the street. He is paying
back the United States for 30 years of back
ing Israel and for 10 years of operations
over Iraq. To quote a small shopkeeper, a
man otherwise peaceable and reputed up
right and honest, "America is like a big lion.
If one does not hit it hard on the snout, it
will rage and devour everything."
In early 2002, 75 percent of the popula
tion considered that bin Laden was a hero,
and 75 percent believed that Sept. 11 had
been a crime. A common commentary was
that no Muslim could have committed such
a deed. Bin Laden is a hero for standing up
to America, yet public opinion at that date
deems the destruction of the World Trade
Center un-Islamic and not his act. I'll is con
tradictory stance is an indication of the
depth of the Arab desire fora hero.
That Moroccan public opinion accepts
suicide bombings in Israel and the occu
pied territories as rightful resistance and
martyrdom suggests that a U.S. action
against Iraq coupled with inaction over the
Palestinian question might change some
people's views and make them see Ameri
cans through the real bin eyes —as
fair game.
The deaths on Sept. 11 are to us unique
deaths. In late September 2001, the Moroc

can lUeitui —the informal group of men pos
sessing the knowledge and authority to pro
nounce on matters concerning the commu
nity — avoided condemning the New York
City and Washington terror attacks. To the
Western observer, this silence seemed on
the surface of things reprehensible. It quick
ly turned crystal-clear. No public figure
could risk blaming Sept. 1 I. The dead, at
the very moment of their dying, were im
mediately integrated in the wider issues of
concern to the Moroccans and to the wider
Arab-Muslim world — Palestine and the un
finished Second Gulf War of 1991-2002.
Any member of the idema coming out to
condemn Sept. 11 would have been con
demned by public opinion. It was perhaps
even unthinkable to condemn Sept. 11. Mo
roccan elites could not take a truly horrified
public position concerning the New York
and Washington dead. For them, the U.S.
casualties were contextualized, no, more
even — submerged — in the preexisting
ocean of emotions—those feelings of anger,
powerlessness and pan-Arab solidarity sum
moned again and again by the Iraqi casual
ties of Desert Storm 1991, by those Iraqi
dead incidental to the occasional but regular
pinpoint strikes by coalition airplanes in the
no-fly zone and by the images of Palestinian
casualties in the Holy Land.
Cynics have posited that the Arab street
will never rise up against pro-American
rulers, and that, therefore, the United States
need not fear loosing allies — those who
matter having the power of command —
owing to an invasion of Iraq. They may be

right — but this is not necessarily the main
problem, depending on what the war is
meant to achieve. And this is the point at
issue: What are the war aims? The United
States and its citizenry should be clear about
what it hopes to achieve with such a war. It
should do so with an equally clear definition
of the American common good.
If the aim of the war is to stop terrorism,
it will fail, lor reasons stated above. If the aim
of the war is to protect Israel from 1 lussein's
weaponry, it is unclear that in the long run
Israel will benefit. The more Arab anger
I'ises, the greater the chances that someone
some day somehow will detonate a mass-de
struction weapon between Jordan and the
Mediterranean. If the aim of the invasion is
to prevent the Iraqi dictator from one day
neutralizing with his weapons the U.S. bases
located in the Middle East, we should be
clear that this war will be fought to preserve
the upper hand in the game of empire.
It may be fine if the citizens of this coun
try, with full knowledge of the parameters
of the situation, decide that the defense of
empire is worth risking increased terror
ism. But they should not delude themselves
as to the amount of danger that they are ex
posing themselves to, now and in the long
run. America will create enemies, and en
mities in the Old World cultures of remem
brance are long-lasting.

volunteer here some additional reflections
— a view from the edge of the Arab world.
1 have just returned from Morocco. Until
recently, this geographically westernmost
corner of the Arab-Muslim world was ar
guably a firm and safe ally of the United
States and a mediator between Israel and the
Middle East's frontline states. This all may
change. A research project led me to discuss
international polity issues with Moroccan in
tellectuals and public figures, as well as with
the man in the street. The ordinary Moroc
can — taxi driver, street vendor, shopkeep
er, student — readily will ask a customer or
chance encounter what he thinks about the
Middle East and quickly emote about both
the Palestinian question and the U.S. in
volvement with Iraq. Intellectuals and peo
ple of substance enter discussion very cau
tiously. Many in these groups have a vested
interest in presenting the best face possible to
Europeans and Americans — what they be
lieve the West wants to see and hear.
At a dinner, a businessman seated oppo

site from me, upon hearing that I was work
ing on a volume on Sept. 11, immediately
proclaimed, "We Moroccans universally re
prove what happened." But once the West
erner makes clear that lie or she does not
buy this simplifying fiction, a real debate
can begin. Caution works multi-directional
ly — these elites do not readily condemn
Sept. 11 in public, before an Arab audience,
for they know the people's feelings. The
U.S. Embassy, I was told, listens too much
to the cautious set, and does not take the
temperature of the so-called "Arab street."
If this is true, U.S. decision makers are
working on the basis of flawed data when
they try to evaluate possible reactions of the
Arabs to an intervention in Iraq. They are
all the more distant from what New York
Times columnist Tom Friedman has called
the "Arab basement" — the hidden groups
that so actively hate the U.S. that, given a
chance, they would strike against it. And an
intervention in Iraq risks turning America's
friends into neutrals, neutrals into America
haters and America haters to active haters.
Otherwise put, convert those who might
have acted against potential terrorists into
passive observers, those who might have
been passive into abettors, and those who
were passive helpers of terrorism into live
human bombs. I have met officers and petty
officers, men filled with admiration for the
United States soldiers who they trained
with, wondering in anger at American for
eign policy. Anger can become hatred.
"How does one say 'merci in Arabic?" To
this puzzling question — puzzling because

obvious answers like "shukran" or "baraka
Inujik" were dismissed haughtily by the
questioner, the questioner had a lightning
answer: "In Arabic, one says bin Laden.' "
This chance street conversation — the par
ties did not know one another — conveys
why bin Laden is a hero, not only to the
basement, but to the street. He is paying
back the United States for 30 years of back
ing Israel and for 10 years of operations
over Iraq. To quote a small shopkeeper, a
man otherwise peaceable and reputed up
right and honest, "America is like a big lion.
If one does not hit it hard on the snout, it
will rage and devour everything."
In early 2002, 75 percent of the popula
tion considered that bin Laden was a hero,
and 75 percent believed that Sept. 11 had
been a crime. A common commentary was
that no Muslim could have committed such
a deed. Bin Laden is a hero for standing up
to America, yet public opinion at that date
deems the destruction of the World Trade
Center un-Islamic and not his act. I'll is con
tradictory stance is an indication of the
depth of the Arab desire fora hero.
That Moroccan public opinion accepts
suicide bombings in Israel and the occu
pied territories as rightful resistance and
martyrdom suggests that a U.S. action
against Iraq coupled with inaction over the
Palestinian question might change some
people's views and make them see Ameri
cans through the real bin eyes —as
fair game.
The deaths on Sept. 11 are to us unique
deaths. In late September 2001, the Moroc

can lUeitui —the informal group of men pos
sessing the knowledge and authority to pro
nounce on matters concerning the commu
nity — avoided condemning the New York
City and Washington terror attacks. To the
Western observer, this silence seemed on
the surface of things reprehensible. It quick
ly turned crystal-clear. No public figure
could risk blaming Sept. 1 I. The dead, at
the very moment of their dying, were im
mediately integrated in the wider issues of
concern to the Moroccans and to the wider
Arab-Muslim world — Palestine and the un
finished Second Gulf War of 1991-2002.
Any member of the idema coming out to
condemn Sept. 11 would have been con
demned by public opinion. It was perhaps
even unthinkable to condemn Sept. 11. Mo
roccan elites could not take a truly horrified
public position concerning the New York
and Washington dead. For them, the U.S.
casualties were contextualized, no, more
even — submerged — in the preexisting
ocean of emotions—those feelings of anger,
powerlessness and pan-Arab solidarity sum
moned again and again by the Iraqi casual
ties of Desert Storm 1991, by those Iraqi
dead incidental to the occasional but regular
pinpoint strikes by coalition airplanes in the
no-fly zone and by the images of Palestinian
casualties in the Holy Land.
Cynics have posited that the Arab street
will never rise up against pro-American
rulers, and that, therefore, the United States
need not fear loosing allies — those who
matter having the power of command —
owing to an invasion of Iraq. They may be

right — but this is not necessarily the main
problem, depending on what the war is
meant to achieve. And this is the point at
issue: What are the war aims? The United
States and its citizenry should be clear about
what it hopes to achieve with such a war. It
should do so with an equally clear definition
of the American common good.
If the aim of the war is to stop terrorism,
it will fail, lor reasons stated above. If the aim
of the war is to protect Israel from 1 lussein's
weaponry, it is unclear that in the long run
Israel will benefit. The more Arab anger
I'ises, the greater the chances that someone
some day somehow will detonate a mass-de
struction weapon between Jordan and the
Mediterranean. If the aim of the invasion is
to prevent the Iraqi dictator from one day
neutralizing with his weapons the U.S. bases
located in the Middle East, we should be
clear that this war will be fought to preserve
the upper hand in the game of empire.
It may be fine if the citizens of this coun
try, with full knowledge of the parameters
of the situation, decide that the defense of
empire is worth risking increased terror
ism. But they should not delude themselves
as to the amount of danger that they are ex
posing themselves to, now and in the long
run. America will create enemies, and en
mities in the Old World cultures of remem
brance are long-lasting.

It is too early to predict whether Ameri

late to speculate how an American mili

Middle hast and beyond, absent any con

Israeli-Palestinian question. The History
