112 lic front page article "Budget cuts
may not hurt research" in yesterday's
Daily incorrectly stated that Geoff Grant,
associate vice president for research ad
ministration, said that "funding for re
search on 'bio-defense' . . . has flooded
itito the University the last several years."
According to Grant, funding for bio-de
fense has just been beginning, and it is
still unknown how much of it Stanford
might receive.
