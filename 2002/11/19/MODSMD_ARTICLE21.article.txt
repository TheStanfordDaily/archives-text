## Fatigued volleyball earns split up north 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's volley
ball program has a rich tradition of
annualy having the nation's
toughest schedule. This year,
there's no question that the No. 4
Cardinal's is the most brutal.

Women's Volleyball
Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. Washington
30-26, 30-21,27-30, 30-28
Saturday: No. 13 Washington State def.
Stanford 31-29, 30-24, 23-30, 30-26

But although Stanford usually
wears its tough match lineup as a
badge of honor, the Cardinal's
scheduling masochism really got
the better oft he team last weekend.
Playing its sixth and seventh
straight matches against ranked
opponents — its fourth and fifth
on the road during that stretch —
a bruised and weary Cardinal (25-
4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Conference) split
its matches against the Washing
ton schools last weekend.
Stanford managed a 3-1 victo
ry over then-N0.22 Washington
(15-10, 7-9) on Friday. But by the
next night, sickness and injuries
overwhelmed the Cardinal,
which fell in four games to Wash
ington State (19-7, 9-7) in front of
2,539 fans who packed into
Bohler Gym on the Cougars' Se
nior Night.
"In a 15-day period, we played
seven matches, five on the road,
two on the road against No. 1
teams (Southern California and
Hawaii)," said Stanford coach
John Dunning. "We played tired
on Friday but got a win, and we
played tired on Saturday and it
didn't happen. We have people
who are sick and banged up. It
piles up."
The loss to Washington Stale
knocked Stanford out of the No. 1
spot in the rankings, a spot that it
had taken after wins over USC and
Hawaii the previous two week
ends. It also effectively sealed the

Pat-10 title for USC, which has a
game-and-a-half lead over tlit*
Cardinal heading into the final
weekend of Pac-10 play.
But the biggest loss of the week
end might he yet to tome.
All-Ameriean senior outside
hitter Logan Tom, the Cardinal's
killing and digging leader,
jammed her thumb early in the
fourth game against the Cougars.
X-ray results weren't available as
of press time, but the prospect of
not having Tom on the left side
heading into the postseason is one
that no one on the Farm wants to
think about.
"This weekend was definitely a
difficult weekend," said sopho
more outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani, who picked up 38 kills in the
two matches. "The only thing that
we can do right now is look for
ward toward our future chal
lenges, and 1 believe that this
weekend happened fora reason, a
reason that we will hopefully be
able to understand when we are
looking back at our season."
The injury to Tom, who fin
ished the match, clearly took its toll
on Stanford, which saw a 17-11
lead in the fourth game and its
hopes fora comeback fade away. A
late six-point run by the Cougars,
pushed by three hitting errors
from loin, sealed the match with a
30-26 final-game win for Washing
ton State.
With junior middle blocker
Sara MtGee and junior setter
Anna Robinson under the weath
er, the tone of the match was set
right out of the blocks, as Stan
ford hitting errors on the first
three rallies helped the Cougars
to an 8-1 lead in the opening
game. The Cardinal ehipped
away at the lead and eventually
reached game point first at 29-28,
but back-to-back hitting errors by
Stanford gave Washington State
a 31-29 win.
"We started slowly, but we
played our best volleyball of the
match in the rest of the game,"

Dunning said. "We had the chance
to win it, but we didn't doit. We've
been through a lot this year, so we
didn't freak out or anything."
Playing her last regular-sea
son match ai home, Washington
State senior outside hitter La-
Toya Harris took over in the sec
ond game. Harris knocked
down 10 of her career-high 29
kills in the Cougars' 30-24 sec
ond-game win.
A big blocking effort by t he Car
dinal in the third game led by

Robinson and McGee, who each
finished with six blocks on the
night, helped Stanford to an easy
30-23 win in the third game.
Despite the injury, Tom fin
ished with 19 kills and 21 digs,
though her defensive number
paled in comparison to Cougar se
nior libero Kortney Jamtaas, who
had a huge Senior Night as well
with a school-record 34 digs in the
match. Washington State outdug

Senior Logan Tom and the No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team suffered
a tough four-game loss to Washington State in Pullman on Saturday after de
feating Washington in four games on Friday.
Stanford 84-73, which helped the
Cougars out hit the Cardinal .226
to .183.
"It's like a fairy tale that's real,"
Jamtaas said. "We knew it was our
last game [at home], and we want
ed to go out with no regrets."
The road-weary Cardinal,
which had to travel cross-state
from Seattle to Pullman on Satur
day, looked tired enough on Fri
day already.
Tom led four players with
double-digit kill totals with 21,
as the Cardinal eked out a 30-

26, 30-21, 27-30, 30-28 win over
the Iluskies.
McGee added 16 kills while hit
ting at a .440 clip, while senior de
fensive specialist Lindsey Yamasa

up three aces in the win.

ranking in this week's poll, while

The Cardinal is taking its third
straight day off today to get some
much needed rest before its final
regular-season matches against
Cal on Saturday and No. 11 Santa
Clara next week.
The Stanford women's volley
ball program has a rich tradition of
annualy having the nation's
toughest schedule. This year,
there's no question that the No. 4
Cardinal's is the most brutal.

Stanford 31-29, 30-24, 23-30, 30-26

But although Stanford usually
wears its tough match lineup as a
badge of honor, the Cardinal's
scheduling masochism really got
the better oft he team last weekend.
Playing its sixth and seventh
straight matches against ranked
opponents — its fourth and fifth
on the road during that stretch —
a bruised and weary Cardinal (25-
4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Conference) split
its matches against the Washing
ton schools last weekend.
Stanford managed a 3-1 victo
ry over then-N0.22 Washington
(15-10, 7-9) on Friday. But by the
next night, sickness and injuries
overwhelmed the Cardinal,
which fell in four games to Wash
ington State (19-7, 9-7) in front of
2,539 fans who packed into
Bohler Gym on the Cougars' Se
nior Night.
"In a 15-day period, we played
seven matches, five on the road,
two on the road against No. 1
teams (Southern California and
Hawaii)," said Stanford coach
John Dunning. "We played tired
on Friday but got a win, and we
played tired on Saturday and it
didn't happen. We have people
who are sick and banged up. It
piles up."
The loss to Washington Stale
knocked Stanford out of the No. 1
spot in the rankings, a spot that it
had taken after wins over USC and
Hawaii the previous two week
ends. It also effectively sealed the

Pat-10 title for USC, which has a
game-and-a-half lead over tlit*
Cardinal heading into the final
weekend of Pac-10 play.
But the biggest loss of the week
end might he yet to tome.
All-Ameriean senior outside
hitter Logan Tom, the Cardinal's
killing and digging leader,
jammed her thumb early in the
fourth game against the Cougars.
X-ray results weren't available as
of press time, but the prospect of
not having Tom on the left side
heading into the postseason is one
that no one on the Farm wants to
think about.
"This weekend was definitely a
difficult weekend," said sopho
more outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani, who picked up 38 kills in the
two matches. "The only thing that
we can do right now is look for
ward toward our future chal
lenges, and 1 believe that this
weekend happened fora reason, a
reason that we will hopefully be
able to understand when we are
looking back at our season."
The injury to Tom, who fin
ished the match, clearly took its toll
on Stanford, which saw a 17-11
lead in the fourth game and its
hopes fora comeback fade away. A
late six-point run by the Cougars,
pushed by three hitting errors
from loin, sealed the match with a
30-26 final-game win for Washing
ton State.
With junior middle blocker
Sara MtGee and junior setter
Anna Robinson under the weath
er, the tone of the match was set
right out of the blocks, as Stan
ford hitting errors on the first
three rallies helped the Cougars
to an 8-1 lead in the opening
game. The Cardinal ehipped
away at the lead and eventually
reached game point first at 29-28,
but back-to-back hitting errors by
Stanford gave Washington State
a 31-29 win.
"We started slowly, but we
played our best volleyball of the
match in the rest of the game,"

Dunning said. "We had the chance
to win it, but we didn't doit. We've
been through a lot this year, so we
didn't freak out or anything."
Playing her last regular-sea
son match ai home, Washington
State senior outside hitter La-
Toya Harris took over in the sec
ond game. Harris knocked
down 10 of her career-high 29
kills in the Cougars' 30-24 sec
ond-game win.
A big blocking effort by t he Car
dinal in the third game led by

Robinson and McGee, who each
finished with six blocks on the

30-23 win in the third game.
