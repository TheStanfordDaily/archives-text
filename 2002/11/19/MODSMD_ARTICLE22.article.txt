# Soccer sweeps final Pac-10 matches
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Heading into last weekend, the Stanford men's
soccer team was already oul of the running for its sec
ond straight Pacific-10 Conference title. It had been
kept scoreless in five of its last six matches and was also
ranked a season-low 19th in the nation.
For those who can't look beyond statistics and
numbers, the Cardinal is as good as out in terms of
competing for the national title.
But to all those naysayers, please refer to last
weekend.
After the No. 22 Cardinal (14-4-2, 5-3-2 Pac-10)
finished off its regular season with a dominating 4-1
victory at ()regon State (13-7,4-6) and a double-over-

Sunday: Stanford 2, Washington 1 (2 OT)

time 2-1 win at Washington (6-10-3, 3-7), those who
still don't believe in Stanford might be surprised come
December.
"We played well this weekend, and it was good to
score some goals," assistant coach Matt Stimson said.
"The forwards did a great job and got some great
chances. I his gets us moving in the right direction."
Although the wins left Stanford short of the Pac-10
crown, the players were extremely pleased with the
way the team was able to finish the regular season.

Sophomore midfielder Darren Fernandez busts a move. Fernandez and the Cardinal won its final two games of the
regular season in the Pacific Northwest, defeating Oregon State 4-1 and Washington 2-1 in double overtime.
"II was a really big weekend he
cause we needed to get a couple ol
victories to try to get one of the top
-16 seeds, which gives us a lirst
round bye," sophomore forward
Matt Janus/ said. "It was really im
portant lor us to come out and get
a lew big wins, because although
we've been playing well, we haven't
been getting results lately."
Deeply troubling the Cardinal
over the past six games had been
the squad's inability to score goals.
Besides its 2-0 victory over Fresno
State on Nov. 8, Stanford was held
scoreless by UCLA and California
twice and by Fresno State once.
Even more frustrating was the
fact that Stanford actually outshot
its opponents 53-42 in those live
matches. The offense certainly had
its chances, and the three losses
and two ties could have easily gone
Stanford's way.
Last Friday night, though,
sophomore midfielder Darren
Fernandez and the Cardinal made
sure that the pattern was broken.
From the get-go, Stanford
rekindled the offensive fire that
had allowed the Cardinal to accu
mulate a 31-8 goal advantage in
its first 12 games.
Fernandez opened the
game's scoring at the eight
minute mark when he took a
centering pass from senior mid
fielder Johanes Maliza and split
two defenders to score from 10

yards out fora I -0 lead.
I he Beavers were able to score
the equalizer on .in Alan Cordon
goal, which was only the fourth
goal allowed by junior Cardinal
keeper Robby Fulton this season.
Bui the Beavers' momentum
was quickly squashed, as Maliza
controlled a loose ball in the mid
dle of the penalty box and sent the
ball into the net fora 2-1 advan
tage heading into halftime.
Fven without the Cardinal's
leader in points, senior forward
Roger Levesque(MCL injury), and
Chad Marshall (playing with U-20
national team), the Cardinal con
tinued to dick in the second half.
Alter an Oregon State foul in
the 58th minute, senior defender
Todd Dunivant served a brilliant
ball toward the far post that
sophomore forward James Twell
man was able to tap in.
Fernandez then added his sec
ond goal of the day and a team
leading ninth goal of the season
five minutes later to secure the 4-1
victory.
Stanford last enjoyed a victory
this big when it crushed Santa
Clara 3-0 almost two months ago.
Sunday's match against Wash
ington, though, was not as com
fortable.
Still without Levesque and
Marshall's services and also with
out Janus/., who was injured on
Friday, the team looked to be in
some trouble. But a lew unlikely
heroes emerged in the game.
Filtering the second half in a
scoreless tie, sophomore forward
Sean Whalen took a centering pass

from Dunivant and tlicn sent an
18-yard shot to the lar left corner
of the net for his first goal of the
season. Sophomore midfielder
Todd Leber also played a key role
in tilling in lor the injured players.
Nursing a 1-0 lead, the Cardi
nal defense was unable to hold on,
as the I luskies tied die match with
only four minutes left.
Two minutes into the second
overtime, the referee called a
Washington foul in the Huskies'
penalty box, and Dunivant sec ured
Stanford's 13th victory of the sea
son on the ensuing penalty kirk.
With the two road victories, the
Cardinal was able to battle oil the
Beavers fora third-place confer
ence finish.
Janus/ said he was pleased with
the depth the team showed over
the weekend.
"We played a lot better as a
team. It wasn't just the defense or
just the offense playing well," he
said. "It was nice to see that no
matter who we're playing on the
field, there's no drop off."
Seedings for the NCAA Tour
nament was announced yester
day, and although the Cardinal
did not receive one of the top
eight spots, it earned a first
round bye. Stanford will play the
winner of the Portland / Oregon
State game on Nov. 27 at Mal
oney Field.
Wake Forest earned the No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament. II
the Cardinal is successful in its first
two matches, it could potentially
face the top-seeded Demon Dea
cons in the quarterfinal round.
