# Spencer and field hockey's infidelity
## 
### 
My heart was broken.
My dreams shattered.
My self-esteem in Ihe
basement. I broke up
with my longtime girlfriend last
week. I had pined over her all
summer, thinking of road trips,
parties, deep conversations, meet
ing parents, long walks, exuber
ance and love.
We started going out this year,
and it was going great. I mean, I
really liked her. It was a cool rela
tionship: laid back, kind of small
scale, but I knew it would blossom,
and I think she did too. I was real
ly happy.

But it all came
to a disturbing,
crashing halt. In
the span of one
long "state of the
union" e-mail,
she dumped me.
She kicked me to
the curb as it I was
a red-headed

stepchild. And it hurt. It hurt like
someone was criticizing me for
being myself, which is the worst
kind of breakup.
So like John Cusack in High
Fidelity, I added her to my list of
all-time top-five breakups. To
tell the truth, I'm not sure I've
gone out with enough girls to
validate an all-time top-five
breakup list, but I think I've got
enough for three.
So here are my top three (in
chronological order of course):
No. 1: Lacy Tolsmann, 4th
grade. I was (still am) a dork; she
was (still is) ultra-hot. we filed
out for recess, a note on her desk
said "I like Spenser." It was the
best recess ever. Misspelling aside,
this was the best thing that had
ever happened to me. 1 was no
longer the class nerd, but now the
pimp of grade school.
Until I found out the note was
forged. It was a prank on Lacy, to
embarrass her by making people
think that she liked the dorkiest
kid iu school. I was a stigma. An

embarrassment. A scarlet letter.
Grade school was about as much
fun for me as rotting meat.
No. 2: Molly Tisdale, senior
year of high school. After going
out on a date with her during the
summer before coming to Stan
lord, I called her fora second one,
but her phone message machine
told me she had permanently
moved to Honduras. She just de
cided not to tell me two days be
fore (iMny Bueno!).
And, finally, the big No. 3. Dis
placing a dormcest from fresh
man year, 1 present my worst
breakup to date. It was a tough
decision to put it on the list, but it
was justified. Just last week, 1
broke up with my most recent
girlfriend: The Stanford field
hockey team.
It was terrible, just plain terri
ble. I had never felt so violated,
used and abused. I felt wronged.
Let me explain.
I have been The Daily's beat
writer for the field hockey team all
year. You may have read an article
or two about them. Yeah, ok, so
nobody reads field hockey articles,
but that's not the point.
Anyway, like I said, it started
out great. I got good interviews,
and the players seemed nice,
willing to work with me, willing
to share some stories about
their team, ft was going to be a
good year.
Now, perhaps the best way to
understand the breakup is to see
the letter they sent me after they
had finished their season when
they had been eliminated by Cal
in the finals of the NorPac Cham
pionships. In fact, this was the
third time that they had lost to Cal
all year, and all three games had
been decided by game-winning
goals by the Golden Bears' Nora
Fedderson.
Essentially, Fedderson had pre
vented Stanford from winning a
NorPac regular-season title, and


Spencer Porter
then, in the NorPac playoffs, she
single-handedly defeated the Car
dinal in sudden-death overtime.
So after my article about the
team's last game, the floodgates
burst, and the onslaught of water
was directed squarely at me. That
night, 1 received a letter from ju
nior goalkeeper Emily Zander.
The following is an exerpt from
Zander's letter:
"1 am not sure who 1 am more
mad at: myself, for waiting so long
to make my opinions known to
you, or YOU, for writing about the
Stanford field hockey team with
such disrespect and ignorance all
season long.
"Too often your writing glori
fies our opponents' achievements
while neglecting to acknowledge
the incredible obstacles that this

team lias overcome throughout
the season...
"You have no idea what this
team has gone through this
year... Every game we played was
better than the game before it. I
would sum up our season with
the words 'improvement' and
'adjustment.' VOU decided to
sum up our season with the words
'Nora Fedderson'. How absolute
ly superficial of you.
"On behalf of the Stanford field
hockey team, Emily Zander."
1 just wanted to cry. My girl
friend wasn't a lover, but a hater all
along, waiting for the end of the
season to break up with me. What
a sham!
Now in response, let me just
say two things. First off, they are
absolutely right â€” I know very lit
tle about field hockey, especially
compared to them. Hut then
again, how many people read the
articles in The Stanford Daily for
in-depth discussions of field hock

ey strategy?
If I wrote about the compara
tive advantages ofdilferent forma
tions, styles of play and attacking
strategy, I'd win back my spot as
"least read sport" from women's
fencing. People are much more in
terested in player's quotes, atti
tudes and how the season is going.
And secondly, in response to
the comments 011 Nora Fedder
son, I say this: I write about field
hockey games at Stanford. II a
player on another team does
something outstanding in a game,
I will write about it. If a player on
the Stanford team does something
outstanding in a game, I will write
about it. It is that simple.
Nora Fedderson, like it or not,
beat Stanford twice 011 game-win
ning goals in sudden-death over
lime. While 1 agree that this is just
one part of a much larger season, it
is a pretty interesting story.
But overall, I'm sorry. 1 really
am. I meant no disrespect, and

I'm depressed lhat (he field hot k
ey team didn't like me. I'm just
very sad that our arrangement
didn't work out. I thought it
would blossom into a longer,
more involved romance, but ap
parently, we just weren't meant
for each other.
I probably should have cut it oil
earlier. Alter I cheated on lick I
hockey, missing the lirst half of a
game to watch the women's soccer
team play, I lelt dirty and untrue.
Damn those soccer girls and
their short shorts. They're so hot, I
should write for them next year.

Spencer Porter, a sophomore, is secretly
in love with Nora Fedderson, but that
lias nothing to do with his writing this
season, lo add your imput on yet an
otlier/ai/ed relationship, e-mail him ad
vice at porters(ii stanford.edu.
Editor's note: Remember that
