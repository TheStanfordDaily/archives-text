It was, unarguably, the defining
moment in the game â€” the turning
point for this young Cardinal team
in a 61-57 hotly contested win over
Boston University in the first round
of the Preseason NIT at Maples
Pavilion.

Last night: Stanford 61,
Boston University 57

Junior forward Justin Davis fol
lowed up a missed layup by senior
guard Julius Barnes with an emphat
ic dunk and a loud outcry of emotion.
It was a celebratory yell, a c ulmi
nating scream, full of anger and re
lief and joy and frustration.
After 34 minutes of play, Stan
ford, for the first time in last night's
game, took a lead, 31-30.
Needless to say, outcries of joy
came late in the game for Stanford,
as the Cardinal (1-0) struggled to
produce offensively in the first half.
Simply put, nothing would fall.
The opportunities were there, but
Stanford just couldn't seem to capi
talize as the Terriers (0-1) went on a
12-3 run in the first eight minutes of
play. In fact.it took Stanford almost
seven minutes to even get on the
scoreboard. The Cardinal shot a
dismal 25 percent in the first half
and went 2 for 10 from behind the
3-point arch.
If nothing else, the one thing this
Preseason Nil game proved was
that the NCAA should think twice
about moving the three-point line
back. Both Stanford and BU strug
gled with the elongated three-point
line. The teams went a combined 9
for 44 from behind the arch.
The Terriers didn't show much
more offensive prowess than the
Cardinal, especially fora team that
returned its top eight scorers from

last season. Senior forward Hilly
Collins scored 13 points and
grabbed 10 boards and was sup
ported by center Ryan Butt, who
finished with 12 points.
"I think this was the ugliest game
that I've ever been a part of,"
Barnes said. "After awhile, when

my shots weren't falling, I was just
so frustrated."
It's difficult to say, however,
whether or not Stanford's first half
oflensive woes were caused more
by the sheer defensive will of BU's
