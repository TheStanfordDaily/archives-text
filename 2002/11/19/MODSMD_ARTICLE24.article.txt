It was, unarguably, the defining
moment in the game â€” the turning
point for this young Cardinal team
in a 61-57 hotly contested win over
Boston University in the first round
of the Preseason NIT at Maples
Pavilion.

Last night: Stanford 61,
Boston University 57

Junior forward Justin Davis fol
lowed up a missed layup by senior
guard Julius Barnes with an emphat
ic dunk and a loud outcry of emotion.
It was a celebratory yell, a c ulmi
nating scream, full of anger and re
lief and joy and frustration.
After 34 minutes of play, Stan
ford, for the first time in last night's
game, took a lead, 31-30.
Needless to say, outcries of joy
came late in the game for Stanford,
as the Cardinal (1-0) struggled to
produce offensively in the first half.
Simply put, nothing would fall.
The opportunities were there, but
Stanford just couldn't seem to capi
talize as the Terriers (0-1) went on a
12-3 run in the first eight minutes of
play. In fact.it took Stanford almost
seven minutes to even get on the
scoreboard. The Cardinal shot a
dismal 25 percent in the first half
and went 2 for 10 from behind the
3-point arch.
If nothing else, the one thing this
Preseason Nil game proved was
that the NCAA should think twice
about moving the three-point line
back. Both Stanford and BU strug
gled with the elongated three-point
line. The teams went a combined 9
for 44 from behind the arch.
The Terriers didn't show much
more offensive prowess than the
Cardinal, especially fora team that
returned its top eight scorers from

last season. Senior forward Hilly
Collins scored 13 points and
grabbed 10 boards and was sup
ported by center Ryan Butt, who
finished with 12 points.
"I think this was the ugliest game
that I've ever been a part of,"
Barnes said. "After awhile, when

my shots weren't falling, I was just
so frustrated."
It's difficult to say, however,
whether or not Stanford's first half
oflensive woes were caused more
by the sheer defensive will of BU's

tightly packed 2-3 zone or simply a
lack of offensive production on the
part of the Cardinal. The Terrier's
2-3 zone pretty much negated
Stanford's athletic edge.
"1 don't think any of us expec t
ed them to go zone the whole
game," Barnes said, a sentiment
that was echoed by Montgomery.
"VVe couldn't get any defensive re
bounds and, [consequently], we
couldn't get out on the break."
Further, BU opted to test Stan
ford's ball-handling abilities early
with a light fullcourt press followed

by a tight 2-3 zone, both of which
proved somewhat effective in stop
ping the Cardinal's penetration.
"It was a good pester press," said
head coach Mike Montgomery.
" They did a good job of containing
the ball. 1 don't think that was much
of a factor, although we did turn it
over a couple of times."
Despite an offensively disaster
oils first half, Stanford showed re
solve. The Cardinal fought its way
back from a nine-point deficit and
went into the locker room at half
time down by only four points, a
feat which Montgomery later de
scribed as "a blessing."
After the half , sophomore swing
man Josh Childress finally found
his offensive rhythm. He finished

the game as Stanford's leading scor
er with a career-high 22 points oil'
(j-of-14 shooting and managed to
grab 11 rebounds along the way
(second only to Davis, who finished
the game with 13 boards).
Montgomery was, among other
things, impressed with the rebound
ing effort put forth by the Cardinal.
"Our [rebounding effort | was
more just a matter of survival," he
said. "Shots weren't falling, we had
to do something."
Junior guard Malt Lottich also
showed that he could contribute
offensively. He scored 12 points,
hut more importantly, hit two big
3-pointers. He ended Stanford's
first- half scoring drought and
later put the Cardinal's first

points of the second half on the
board. Lottich's second-half 3-
pointer was much more meaning
ful than his first. It wasn't until
then, with 17 minutes left to play,
that the basketball gods came
down from the heavens and said
to the Cardinal players, "You may
score now." 11 is shot sparked a 12-
2 Cardinal run that culminated in
(he Davis slam.
"We just found a way to win,"
Barnes said.
And when it's all said and done,
that's enough to shout about.
Stanford will continue play in
the Preseason Nil with a second
round game against No. 11 Xavier
on Wednesday night at Maples.
Tipoff is slated for 7:15 p.m.
