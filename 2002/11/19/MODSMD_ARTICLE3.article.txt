# Campus defends its ethnic theme houses
## 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Since the early 19705, ethnic
theme dorms have been among
the most visible manifestations of
Stanford's commitment to pro
moting diversity. But the idea of
residential theming and program
ming that focuses on members of a
certain race has never been im
mune to controversy.
From those who believe that
theme dorms represent a divisive
form of self-segregation to those
who see them as paternalistic at
tempts by universities to improve
minority students' chances of suc
cess in college, the system has a wide
range of detractors. A recent report
from a New York-based civil rights
group has brought the debate back
to the forefront of the higher edu
cation world.
Yet Stanford students, faculty
and administrators have largely
expressed continued support for
the dorms, which by now have as
sumed unquestioned roles in the
promotion of cultural awareness
on campus.
Report criticizes ethnic housing
On Sept. 9, the New York Civil
Rights Coalition, NYCRC, pub

lished a highly controversial report
that proclaimed many of America's
institutions of higher learning to be
"paternalistic" and "segregationist."
The authors of the report at
tempted to highlight "thecolor-con
scious policies of the colleges and
universities that permit or encour
age, and, oftentimes, fund a balka
nized campus environment."
Among the universities profiled
was Stanford. The report claimed
that "officials of many universities
regard the self-segregation of mi
nority students on their campuses as
supportive of their efforts to foster
the comfort of a culturally, econom
ically, geographically and racially di
verse group of students."
Ethnic theme housing in particu
lar came under tire in the report.
"Many of these racially based
houses make it very clear in their
mission statements that their goal is
racial consciousness and identity,
thus precluding the concept of a
unified campus."
With regard to Stanford, the re
port mentioned that "by giving each
minority separate support systems,
the college suggests that ethnicity
specific support is preferable to gen
eral student support services. Pater
nalism is clearly at work."

Many in the Stanford communi
ty disagreed strongly with the re
port's conclusions.
Exclusion or integration?
Michael Brown, ethnic theme as
sociate for Ujainaa, said he believes
the purpose of theme dorms is to in
tegrate rather than exclude.
"If you consider the dorm being
racially and ethnically balanced,
then that is the only support service
provided exclusively to African-
American students; our services re
ally are for all students in the dorm,"
he said.
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo expanded on this

point in her letter to the editor in the
Chronicle of Higher Education.
"In fact, in these program hous
es, the system of support and pro
gramming is exactly the same as any
residence with freshmen," she said.
" There are additional education
al programs on the ethnic theme,
for which there are program staff
identified. This would be similar to
the structure in other academic or
culture program houses like Public
Policy 1 louse, Performing Arts
House, Italian Language House,"
she wrote.
