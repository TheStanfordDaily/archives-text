# Campus defends its ethnic theme houses
## 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Since the early 19705, ethnic
theme dorms have been among
the most visible manifestations of
Stanford's commitment to pro
moting diversity. But the idea of
residential theming and program
ming that focuses on members of a
certain race has never been im
mune to controversy.
From those who believe that
theme dorms represent a divisive
form of self-segregation to those
who see them as paternalistic at
tempts by universities to improve
minority students' chances of suc
cess in college, the system has a wide
range of detractors. A recent report
from a New York-based civil rights
group has brought the debate back
to the forefront of the higher edu
cation world.
Yet Stanford students, faculty
and administrators have largely
expressed continued support for
the dorms, which by now have as
sumed unquestioned roles in the
promotion of cultural awareness
on campus.
Report criticizes ethnic housing
On Sept. 9, the New York Civil
Rights Coalition, NYCRC, pub

lished a highly controversial report
that proclaimed many of America's
institutions of higher learning to be
"paternalistic" and "segregationist."
The authors of the report at
tempted to highlight "thecolor-con
scious policies of the colleges and
universities that permit or encour
age, and, oftentimes, fund a balka
nized campus environment."
Among the universities profiled
was Stanford. The report claimed
that "officials of many universities
regard the self-segregation of mi
nority students on their campuses as
supportive of their efforts to foster
the comfort of a culturally, econom
ically, geographically and racially di
verse group of students."
Ethnic theme housing in particu
lar came under tire in the report.
"Many of these racially based
houses make it very clear in their
mission statements that their goal is
racial consciousness and identity,
thus precluding the concept of a
unified campus."
With regard to Stanford, the re
port mentioned that "by giving each
minority separate support systems,
the college suggests that ethnicity
specific support is preferable to gen
eral student support services. Pater
nalism is clearly at work."

Many in the Stanford communi
ty disagreed strongly with the re
port's conclusions.
Exclusion or integration?
Michael Brown, ethnic theme as
sociate for Ujamaa, said he believes
the purpose of theme dorms is to in
tegrate rather than exclude.
"If you consider the dorm being
racially and ethnically balanced,
then that is the only support service
provided exclusively to African-
American students; our services re
ally are for all students in the dorm,"
he said.
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo expanded on this

point in her letter to the editor in the
Chronicle of Higher Education.
"In fact, in these program hous
es, the system of support and pro
gramming is exactly the same as any
residence with freshmen," she said.
" There are additional education
al programs on the ethnic theme,
for which there are program staff
identified. This would be similar to
the structure in other academic or
culture program houses like Public
Policy 1 louse, Performing Arts
House, Italian Language House,"
she wrote.
Many people outside of theme


SEVGI YUKSEI/The Stanford Daily
dorms question the need for such
places on campus. At colleges that
don't have ethnic theme dorms,
such as the University of Arizona,
many students react negatively to
the idea of living in one.
Asked whether she would like to
live in an ethnic theme dorm, Uni
versity of Arizona freshman Leah
Adams replied, "No way! I think
they are awful — that's not what col
lege is about at all; we are supposed
to mix with all different people."
Proponents of Stanford's theme
dorms cite that the minority whose
ethnicity is dominant in the house
makes up only halfof its population.
" The goal of the program is not
only to provide a supportive envi
ronment for underrepresented stu
dents, but also create an educational
opportunity for students who are
not of that ethnicity," Camarillo said.
History of ethnic houses at Stanford
The first ethnic theme dorm at
Stanford was established in 1970 on
the heels of lobbying efforts by the
Black Community Services Center
and the Black Student Union.
Thom Massey, assistant dean of
the graduate life office, described
the change from a black student
dorm in Wilbur in 1970 — created
lor the sole purpose of providing a
sort of "ethnic neighborhood" with
simply a larger concentration of
black students —to its current
home, U jamaa, a center for the cel
ebration of black culture.
The initial reaction to the cre
ation of an African-American theme
dorm was similar to that expressed
in the recent NYCRC report.
According to Massey, many
questioned the need for an ethnic
theme dorm, fearing that it could
become exclusionary and thus
detrimental to the Stanford com
munity at large.
Massey argued that the dorm has
instead made significant positive
contributions to the general com
munity, as evidenced by projects
such as the gospel choir.
" Excellent students, when put to
gether, produce excellence,"
Massey said. "fUjamaa] highlights
African-American culture, a culture
worth celebrating."
In 1971, Stanford founded an
Asian-American theme house. In
1980, it was named Okada, after
John Okada, the author of "No-No

Boy," a book that describes the
plight of Japanese-Americans who
refused to serve in the U.S. military
and give up their ties to Japan.
The Native American theme
dorm was also established in 1971.
The Muwekma tribe, indigenous to
the Bay Area, named the house
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which can be
translated to "house of the people."
Muwekma-tah-ruk is currently
home to about 30 undergraduates.
Senior Diana Vizcarra, who lives
in Casa Zapata, the Chicano theme
house, took issue with the NYCRC's
claim that "colleges have chosen to
facilitate segregation by creating
ethnic or 'identity' housing lor mi
nority students."
"Groups and people have fought
for [ethnic theme dorms]; the Uni
versity hasn't founded them," she
said.
'A safe space to discuss race'
According to Camarillo, ethnic
theme dorms are meant to serve a
wide variety of purposes.
"In this educational residential en
vironment, students discuss stereo
types, falsehoods about race and eth
nicity and challenge them through
their own living experience and dia
logues IxHween peers," she said.
The theme dorms have from one
to three ethnic theme associates,
El As, who serve to create programs
that celebrate and spread awareness
of the cultures of their respective
dorms. They create weekly events,
such as Ujamaa's "Blacks and Jews:
Bridging the Gaps," or classes
taught by the ETAs themselves. ()ne
Muwekma ETA created a class that
discusses various Native American
cultures.
According to senior Meera Kota
gal, an El A for Okada, ethnic theme
dorms were formed "as a safe space
for students who were misunder
stood and discriminated against."
"Because of the theme, it opens up
a round of discussion," she contin
ued. "It is a safe space to discuss race."
Senior Emiley Chang, also an
ETA for ()kada, said that there is "an
implicit understanding that there
will be openness and people will re
spect your opinions."
Casa Zapata resident assistant
Carmen Gutierrez said that eth
nic theme dorms also "provide a
network of support for the com
munity and expose the larger
Stanford campus to the culture
we celebrate."
Added Casa Zapata resident
Megan (lark, students can "foster
culture better if [they are] all to

gether ... Organizing [is easier]
proximity-wise."
Finding a support system
"[Living in a theme dorm] is a really
good experience," said Geoff Mad
dox, an RAin Muwektna. "You get
exposed to a culture and environ
ment that you're not used to."
For people belonging to (lie
specified ethnicity, these residences
provide a welcoming environment.
"It makes you feel comfortable
[while making an] adjustment into a
predc)minantly white institution," said
Ujamaa freshman Meena 1 larris.
As a white student living in U jii
maa, Libby Patbergsaid she felt her
experience was generally positive.
"Ujamaa was actually my third
choice," she said. "It seemed to me
that there would be a stronger bond
formed between the housemates. I
definitely felt a little apprehensive at
first about being a minority for the
first time in my life.
"1 think a lot of it was meoveran
aly/ing how people interacted with
me; in other words, 1 was a little
paranoid about not being accepted,
of'sticking out.'"
For Patberg, support through
out the house was an important lac
tor for fitting into the community.
"I was lucky to have a roommate
for whom this wasn't a problem,"
she continued. "1 could fall back on
[her] when others made me feel a bit
isolated. That whole feeling of being
left out went away shortly though,
once people got to know me. I n gen
eral I was impressed with how open
minded people were.
"I fervently believe that theme
houses are a good thing for any in
stitution like Stanford ... I think it is
really important for minority peo
ple to have a strong support group
especially in the face of such uproot
ing. I now realize this more than
ever because I feel like a minority in
U jamaa," Patberg added.
Junior Jerry Simmons, living in
Muwekma, further emphasized the
importance ofa support system. "For
natives, coming from small reserva
tions, coming here is a bit of a culture
shock ... 1 think if they couldn't re
late toother [natives like themselves]
their resiliency would Ix.* very low."
But while the NYCRC report
contended that "some minorities
are assumed in need of support and
attention |by colleges]," many stu
dents argued that theme dorms are
not vital to the success of minorities
at Stanford.
Kotagal argued that Stanford's
theme dorms are "resources that can

be used but don't have to be used."
Instead, theme houses become
bases for the communities to reach
out to the University.
"[Ujamaa] puts on programs
eveiy week that are open to everyone
on campus," noted senior Victor
Moulin, an Ujamaa RA.
Questioning the NYCRC's methods
Many at Stanford criticized the
NYCRC report for presenting su
perficial data.
"Everything [in the report] is
based on pamphlets from the
schools," Gutierrez said. "[ The au
thors] didn't interact with people of
the houses."
Massey agreed.
"They need to study what we've
lived out... highlighting diversity,"
he said. "They cannot look at our
own situation and say it's exclusion
ary." He described the report as a
"scare tactic."
Others questioned the NYCRC's
objectivity.
"The New York Civil Rights
Coalition conducted its research
without ever stepping foot inside of
any Stanford ethnic theme dorm; I
find it to be an organization with an
agenda," Brown said.
David Palumbo-Liu, professor of
comparative literature, wrote a letter
to the editor in The Chronicle of
Higher Education stating that the
N YCRC "is a kind of lilxTtarian-spir
ited organization that once in a while
protests racial stereotyping and sin
gle-sex schools. But it receives fund
ing from the arch-conservative Olin
Foundation, which has its own par
ticular notion of "civil rights" and is
decidedly "anti-mukiculturalist."
The debate continues
A recent article published by the
New York limes, entitled "Colleges
find diversity is not just numbers,"
discussed how the focus on promot
ing diversity on campus was shifting
from a statistically based approach
to a drive toward "breaking down
the barriers between students of dif
ferent backgix >unds."
Stanford's ethnic theme dorms
were set up partly with this goal in
mind, and for the majority of the
community, it is this integrative el
fect — rather than segregation or
polarization — that defines the
theme-dorm concept.
"I think if you came into [the
dorms] with an open mind, you'll
appreciate them more," Kotagal
said.
"But ultimately, it's also just a
home."
