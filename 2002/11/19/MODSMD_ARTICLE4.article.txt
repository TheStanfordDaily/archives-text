### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Speaking before a close-to-ca
pacity afternoon audience at Cub
berley Auditorium yesterday,
President and Publisher of the
New York Times Arthur Sulzberg
er, Jr. addressed the major issues
he saw facing journalism and
media, focusing on the challenge
of running a profitable business
enterprise while providing honest
and unbiased news coverage.
1 lelcl in question-and-answer
format and moderated by Stan
ford Communication Prof. James
Bettinger, Sulzberger's talk ad
dressed issues including biases in
news coverage and how news is
reconciled with national security
and advertising interests.
The Stanford News Reader
ship Program and ASSU Speak
ers Bureau sponsored the event.
On the topic of high news
stand prices for his publication,
Sulzberger defended the need of
income to support large projects
and an expensive newsroom,
while also admitting that part of
his job is to satisfy investors by
bringing in as much profit as
possible.

"It's a circle: It's quality news, it
brings a quality audience, it drives
quality advertising and quality
readership which we reinvest in
the quality of the news," he said.
"But the New York limes news
room is an expensive place to op
erate, and our plans are great, but
they're not cheap."
Two of these plans involve the
Times' quest to continue to ex
pand into new markets. With its
acquisition of The Washington
Post's stake in the International
Herald Tribune, the New York
Times finds itself in control of a
leading international paper that
can help it to penetrate a lucrative
market, Sulzberger said.
Additionally, the Times ac
quired half ownership of a digital
television station six months ago.
The station, co-owned by the Dis
covery Channel, represents what
Sulzberger hopes will be the
Times' next major area of expan
sion: television.
"I think that the next great chal
lenge for us will be to move into a
medium that quite frankly we're
scared of and don't hold in high re
gard — television — and how we
can do that in a way that doesn't di
minish us [as a newspaper]," he said.
While acknowledging that the
limes is a business venture primari
ly concerned with maximizing profit,
Sulzlx*rger also argued that it is the
readers he hopes to cater to more
than any advertiser or politician.
"Advertising remains the
largest segment of our profitabili
ty, and yes, it is sometimes a chal -
lenge to balance our news and ad
vertising," he said. "But in the end
it's not that hard — in the end, ad
vertising loses."
Sulzberger said that because
the paper's "core value" is the
reader and it receives income 112 rom
a wide variety of advertisers, "we
can afford to take the hits in cer
tain areas [financially]" in order to
break a story that may be unfavor
able to one of its advertisers.

Addressing criticism that televi
sion stations over-covered the re
cent sniper attacks, and that they
generally provoke unreasonable
fears through large-scale coverage
of an event, Sulzberger argued that,
in the end, the audience is at fault.
"We are to blame... go back
and look at what happened when
any of the television stations
dropped that story: People
changed the channel," he said. "So
as much as we like to blame CNN
and the rest of them for their inces
sant focus on the story of the day,
let's look at ourselves. They're
doing what we ask them to do."
Students viewed interest in the
talk itself, and Sulzberger's opin
ions as indicative of increasing
general interest in current events.
"It was interesting to see how
many students showed up to see
Mr. Sulzberger because I think it
shows that students do certainly
care about the news and the world
around them," said sophomore
Kian Eftekhari.
