Speaking before a close-to-ca
pacity afternoon audience at Cub
berley Auditorium yesterday,
President and Publisher of the
New York Times Arthur Sulzberg

market, Sulzberger said.
Additionally, the Times ac

television station six months ago.
The station, co-owned by the Dis
covery Channel, represents what
Sulzberger hopes will be the
Times' next major area of expan
sion: television.
"I think that the next great chal

medium that quite frankly we're
scared of and don't hold in high re
