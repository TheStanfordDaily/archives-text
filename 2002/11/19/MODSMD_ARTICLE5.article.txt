# Former student urges campus to act
## 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
David Harris, former Stanford
student body president and na
tionally renowned activist, called
fora "new student movement" last
night in a talk that opened a week
long series of activities for student
awareness regarding the situation
in Iraq.
"There is a point for all human
beings to stand up to the largest
forces of the world and to speak the
truth to power," Harris said.
"There comes a time when the sit

uation is so outrageous you must
do so in order to still think of your
self as a human being."
AttheToyon Hall lounge, Harris
shared his experiences as a student
and protester during the Vietnam
War with an audience of about 100
Stanford community members.
After leaving Stanford, Harris
worked as a Vietnam War resister
and was imprisoned at one point
for many months at a maximum se
curity facility for his actions against
the government. I le went on to be
come a journalist for The New
York limes and authored several

books on Vietnam.
"Think of me as a foreign ex
change student from the class of
'67," Harris said, as he recalled his
anti-war activities from his days as a
Stanford undergraduate, which in
cluded organizing a movement for
the collection of draft cards as a re
sistance to conscription.
Harris emphasized that beingac
tive was more an issue of life choices
rather than politics and urged all
students to "light for your futures"
by becoming more involved.
"None of us came on campus
expecting to be activists," Harris
said. "I was my high school's varsi
ty football player. We were not in
volved because we were interested
in politics or some other abstract
concept. We were acting because
we believed we needed to tell our
government to back down."
The lack of mass movements of
dissent and visible expressions of
discontent on campus did not faze
Harris.
He spoke of the beginnings of
Stanford activism during the late
'60s and how all opposition "starts
in little groups like this one talking
about the issue."
He stressed that it was more im
portant for students to begin think
ing that "it is not enough to do
something because your govern
ment says it is good."
Many believed that Harris' talk
was helpful in garnering student
interest in the Iraqi conflict.
"1 think the Iraq situation is
relevant to a lot of the experiences
he brought up tonight," said
mathematics doctoral student
Julia Salzman. "It is important to
show our opposition to the war in
the same way."
Others, however, felt that Har
ris did not place enough stress on
what the present generation of
Stanford students can do.
"It is great that people are lis
tening to what I larris is saying,"
said sophomore Erin Beller. "[But]
I wish that he had given more op
tions or ideas for the students to
take action."
The talk was organized by facul
ty Against War and also sponsored
by the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice.
