## 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
David Harris, a former Stan
ford student and ASSU presi
dent in the 19605, said that his
years at the Farm were some of
the most formative of his life. In
an interview with The Daily,
Harris discussed his time at
Stanford and how activism at the
University now compares to po
litical activity during his years.
The Daily: When did you
first become politically active
or aware?
David Harris: During my fresh
man year at Stanford. It was
1963 and the Civil Rights Move
ment in Mississippi had arrived
on campus. I was active in send
ing students to Mississippi and
went clown there myself the fol
lowing year.
TD: To whom or what experi
ence do you attribute your ded
ication to activism?
DH: My introduction to it was
the Civil Rights Movement. The
defining factor of it would be
the Vietnam War.
T D: What made you decide to
become an activist after leaving

Stanford?
DH: I encountered what I con
sidered to be a major impera
tive. I did not think anyone who
believed in democracy could
stand back and watch millions
be killed. The situation de
manded I act on my belief. This
resulted me in spending 10
years of my life working for this.
TD: How involved were you in
activism at Stanford?
I)H: I was one of the campus ac
tivists. I became the premier of
it as student body president. I
had already been involved in
certain conflicts with the admin
istration ... 1 also founded ana

tional organization called The Re
sistance, which encouraged peo
ple to commit civil disobedience
for what they believed in.
TD: You were student body presi
dent from 1966-1967, a very turbu
lent time. What were your main
political concerns during this
time?
DH: It certainly involved doing
what I believed in. One of my
goals as student body president
was to turn the University into an
instrument for ending the war. I
was elected on this platform so I
felt comfortable doing that.
Another issue we were con
cerned with at the time was estab
lishing equal rights for women. At
that time, there was separate
housing for men and women.
Women had hours and had to
sign in and out, and if they didn't
obey, they were severely pun
ished. The men were not subject
to any of those things. If the man
kept the woman out late, the
woman would be punished, but
the man would not. Women also
didn't have the right to live oil
campus until their senior year.
The administration's argument

was that if they did, "They would
be having sex," to which I re
sponded, "What do you think
they are doing now?"
The University claimed it had
to right to act as the parent. We
believed that the students should
have an equal part to the Univer
sity as the faculty.
TD: We are now possibly ap
proaching turbulent times as
well. Do you feel that it is impor
tant for the Stanford community
to become more political?
DH: Absolutely. It is incumbent
upon all Americans to take charge
of the situation. All of us as citizens
have the responsibility to stop [the
possible war against Iraq]. My
hope in speaking tonight is to
spark interest in these questions.
The country really needs a stu
dent movement badly.
TD: How do you think the stu
dent body at Stanford has
changed from the time you were
here to now?
DH: My impressions are fragmen
tary, but I think it's obvious that
[the students] aren't raising much
dust. There are lots of very bright,
very serious people getting
plugged into the bright and seri
ous ladder of the economy. In
order to give life meaning we must
address the issues of the planet.
