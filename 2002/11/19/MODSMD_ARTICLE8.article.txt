# Mideast students fear instability

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This article is the eighth
in a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford commu
nity and the potential war in Iraq.

junior Wael Salloum is going to
stay in the United States for winter
break this year, instead of traveling
to Kuwait to visit his family and
friends as he usually does. And
while freshman Mohammad
Subeh is now a permanent resi
dent of the United States, his rela
tives in the Persian Gulf are anx
ious about the prospect of war,
worried that a U.S.-led strike on
Iraq could spill over into Kuwait
and c ause greater unrest than was
seen during Desert Storm over a
decade ago.
For many of Stanford's Middle
Eastern international students —
several of whom lived through the

Persian Gulf War — the possibility
of renewed conflict in Iraq has al
ready had an effect on their lives,
giving them a different interpreta
tion of consequences of such a war.
Regardless of their attitude to
ward Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and the politics of a U.S.-
led strike, many students fear that
any war with Iraq will destabilize
the region and negatively affect
the civilian population.
"Most of the civilians don't real
ly want anything to happen; they
don't want any disorder to go on,"
said Subeh, who was born in
Kuwait. "[According to] my family
. . . life there isn't as good as it was
before the Persian Gulf War, but
they don't want it to get worse.
They fear that another war on Iraq
will just c ause more disorder."
Subeh, who was seven years old
during (he Persian Gulf War, said
that many in the Gulf fear that war
in the region poses a greater threat

than currently exists because of
Hussein's presence.
"I think [Kuwaitis are] always
fearful, because Kuwait is now an
ally to the U.S.. he said. "In gen
eral, my family is obviously afraid,
but. . . the U.S. makes it seem like
we have to take |Hussein] out of
power because he's persecuting
the people in all these countries
around them. My family, person
ally, they aren't afraid of dying
every day. The U.S. makes you
think that, the media especially."
Though he moved to the Unit
ed States after the Persian Gulf
War, Subeh said he gained an un
derstanding of the implications of
the war that he believes many
American students to overlook.
"When the U.S. goes and at
tacks Iraq and kills c ivilians, you
don't know how that's going to af
fect one person's life," Subeh
said. "Killing one person is a big
thing. A lot of people lose per
spective on that."
Salloum, who is an American
citizen but whose immediate fami
ly lives in Kuwait, said that his fam
ily is generally in support of the
war and "hates" Hussein. Howev
er, fearing that Kuwait could be
embroiled in a war that Salloum
said would cause far more civilian
casualties than the Persian Cull
War did, his family has already
taken precautions to minimize the
potential fallout from the war.
"They already signed over to
me and my sister all of their fi
nances," Salloum said. "1 go to
Kuwait every summer to see my
(family and friends]. As it is, I'm al
ready not going back for Christ
mas. And because they feel it will
be unstable, my family is coming
[to the United States]; I'm not
coming there. I won't see my ex
tended family, nor will I see my
friends."
Qatari freshman Abdulla
AlMisnad, whose home country
houses the largest U.S. military
base in the Persian Cull", said that
while he is not verv worried that a

war in I rat) could bring violence to
his nation, people in his country
are put in the precarious position
of being the launching pad for an
assault against Iraq.
"The whole Gulf is basically like
one big family," he said. "Nobody
wants a war; nobody wants people
to die."
1 leadded, "Nobody wants to be
responsible for killing people in
Iraq. And if anything does hap
pen, it'll come out of Qatar. And
people are frustrated."
According to Israeli law student
Amichai Magen, the population in
Israel has been preparing for war
by inoculating civilians against clis-.
eases such as small pox and the
plague. Otherwise, though,
Magen said that the possibility for
war with Iraq was not changing
the habits of many Israeli citizens.
"I would say that we have expe
rience of this type of war," Magen
said, but added, "Israelis live
under a daily threat of violence
and terror. So the added threat of
war from outside is adding to an al
ready very intense and difficult sit
uation for the Israeli public.
"I'm not planning to make any
changes. I think giving into terror
and violence is wrong, and we
need to carry on with our lives and
be strong and resilient and not let
dictators dictate our lives."

led strike, many students fear that
any war with Iraq will destabilize
the region and negatively affect
the civilian population.
"Most of the civilians don't real
ly want anything to happen; they
don't want any disorder to go on,"
said Subeh, who was born in
Kuwait. "[According to] my family
. . . life there isn't as good as it was
before the Persian Gulf War, but
they don't want it to get worse.
They fear that another war on Iraq
will just c ause more disorder."
Subeh, who was seven years old
during (he Persian Gulf War, said
that many in the Gulf fear that war
in the region poses a greater threat

than currently exists because of
Hussein's presence.
"I think [Kuwaitis are] always
fearful, because Kuwait is now an
ally to the U.S.. he said. "In gen
eral, my family is obviously afraid,
but. . . the U.S. makes it seem like
we have to take |Hussein] out of
power because he's persecuting
the people in all these countries
around them. My family, person
ally, they aren't afraid of dying
every day. The U.S. makes you
think that, the media especially."
Though he moved to the Unit
ed States after the Persian Gulf
War, Subeh said he gained an un
derstanding of the implications of
the war that he believes many
American students to overlook.
"When the U.S. goes and at
tacks Iraq and kills c ivilians, you
don't know how that's going to af
fect one person's life," Subeh
said. "Killing one person is a big
thing. A lot of people lose per
spective on that."
Salloum, who is an American
citizen but whose immediate fami
ly lives in Kuwait, said that his fam
ily is generally in support of the
war and "hates" Hussein. Howev
er, fearing that Kuwait could be
embroiled in a war that Salloum
said would cause far more civilian
casualties than the Persian Cull
War did, his family has already
taken precautions to minimize the
potential fallout from the war.
"They already signed over to
me and my sister all of their fi
nances," Salloum said. "1 go to
Kuwait every summer to see my
(family and friends]. As it is, I'm al
ready not going back for Christ
mas. And because they feel it will
be unstable, my family is coming
[to the United States]; I'm not
coming there. I won't see my ex
tended family, nor will I see my
friends."
Qatari freshman Abdulla
AlMisnad, whose home country
houses the largest U.S. military
base in the Persian Cull", said that
while he is not verv worried that a

war in I rat) could bring violence to
his nation, people in his country
are put in the precarious position
of being the launching pad for an
assault against Iraq.
"The whole Gulf is basically like
one big family," he said. "Nobody
wants a war; nobody wants people
to die."
1 leadded, "Nobody wants to be
responsible for killing people in
Iraq. And if anything does hap
pen, it'll come out of Qatar. And
people are frustrated."
According to Israeli law student
Amichai Magen, the population in
Israel has been preparing for war
by inoculating civilians against clis-.
eases such as small pox and the
plague. Otherwise, though,
Magen said that the possibility for
war with Iraq was not changing
the habits of many Israeli citizens.
"I would say that we have expe
rience of this type of war," Magen
said, but added, "Israelis live
under a daily threat of violence
and terror. So the added threat of
war from outside is adding to an al
ready very intense and difficult sit
uation for the Israeli public.
"I'm not planning to make any
changes. I think giving into terror
and violence is wrong, and we
need to carry on with our lives and
be strong and resilient and not let
dictators dictate our lives."

in a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford commu
nity and the potential war in Iraq.

junior Wael Salloum is going to
stay in the United States for winter
break this year, instead of traveling
to Kuwait to visit his family and
friends as he usually does. And
while freshman Mohammad
Subeh is now a permanent resi
dent of the United States, his rela
tives in the Persian Gulf are anx
ious about the prospect of war,
worried that a U.S.-led strike on
Iraq could spill over into Kuwait
and c ause greater unrest than was
seen during Desert Storm over a
decade ago.
For many of Stanford's Middle
Eastern international students —
several of whom lived through the

Persian Gulf War — the possibility
of renewed conflict in Iraq has al
ready had an effect on their lives,
giving them a different interpreta
tion of consequences of such a war.
Regardless of their attitude to
ward Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and the politics of a U.S.-
led strike, many students fear that
any war with Iraq will destabilize
the region and negatively affect
the civilian population.
