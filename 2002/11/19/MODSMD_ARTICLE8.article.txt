# Mideast students fear instability

Editors Note: This article is the eighth
in a weekly series investigating the rela
tionship between the Stanford commu
nity and the potential war in Iraq.

junior Wael Salloum is going to
stay in the United States for winter
break this year, instead of traveling
to Kuwait to visit his family and
friends as he usually does. And
while freshman Mohammad
Subeh is now a permanent resi
dent of the United States, his rela
tives in the Persian Gulf are anx
ious about the prospect of war,
worried that a U.S.-led strike on
Iraq could spill over into Kuwait
and c ause greater unrest than was
seen during Desert Storm over a
decade ago.
For many of Stanford's Middle
Eastern international students —
several of whom lived through the

Persian Gulf War — the possibility
of renewed conflict in Iraq has al
ready had an effect on their lives,
giving them a different interpreta
tion of consequences of such a war.
Regardless of their attitude to
ward Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and the politics of a U.S.-
led strike, many students fear that
any war with Iraq will destabilize
the region and negatively affect
the civilian population.
"Most of the civilians don't real
ly want anything to happen; they
don't want any disorder to go on,"
said Subeh, who was born in
Kuwait. "[According to] my family
. . . life there isn't as good as it was
before the Persian Gulf War, but
they don't want it to get worse.
They fear that another war on Iraq
will just c ause more disorder."
Subeh, who was seven years old
during (he Persian Gulf War, said
that many in the Gulf fear that war
in the region poses a greater threat

than currently exists because of
Hussein's presence.
"I think [Kuwaitis are] always
fearful, because Kuwait is now an
ally to the U.S.. he said. "In gen
eral, my family is obviously afraid,
but. . . the U.S. makes it seem like
we have to take |Hussein] out of
power because he's persecuting
the people in all these countries
around them. My family, person
ally, they aren't afraid of dying
every day. The U.S. makes you
think that, the media especially."
Though he moved to the Unit
ed States after the Persian Gulf
War, Subeh said he gained an un
derstanding of the implications of
the war that he believes many
American students to overlook.
"When the U.S. goes and at
tacks Iraq and kills c ivilians, you
don't know how that's going to af
fect one person's life," Subeh
