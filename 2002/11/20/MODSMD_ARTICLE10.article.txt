# Liver Center launches awareness campaign
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I n the suite of (California, liver cancer is one of
the top five leading cancer-related causes of
death for Asian-Americans, and 80 percent of
these cases are caused by chronic hepatitis B. To
promote awareness about the disease, the Asian
Liver Center launched the Jade Ribbon Cam
paign in the Bay Area in May 2001.
The multimedia campaign includes televi
sion public service announcements, radio shows,
bus ads and lectures offered to the community.
"The campaign aims to raise awareness both
nationally and globally," said center director Dr.
Samuel So. "Our aim is to reduce the incidence
and mortality rate of liver diseases."
Liver cancer is the greatest health disparity
between Asian-Americans and Caucasian Amer
icans. Asians are 10 times more likely than Cau
casians to die of liver cancer. About 10 percent of
Asians and Pacific Islanders have chronic hepati
tis B infection, compared to only 0.1 percent of
Caucasian Americans.
"People with chronic infection are often
asymptomatic, but they are at high risk for de
veloping chronic hepatitis throughout their life

time. Up to 15 percent to 25 percent may die
prematurely from either cirrhosis or liver can
ter," explained infectious disease specialist Dr.
Ki istie Marks '93.
People can suddenly develop the cancer in
their early 30s and may die a few months
later. Victims of chronic hepatitis B often dis
play no symptoms.
While hepatitis B can be transmitted by
blood transfusions, sharing needles and unpro
tected sex, most victims become infected as in
fants or young children. Frequently, transmis
sion of the hepatitis B virus occurs during the
birthing process.
"People have the notion that it's a dirty dis
ease spread through drug needles and sex," So
said. "Most often, that's not the case."
He highlighted the importance of viewing the
disease from a culturally broad perspective.
"Hepatitis B is a buried issue," he added.
"People tend to forget about it because it hasn't
gotten much media attention and because it's a
disease that usually doesn't affect Caucasians."
So emphasized that hepatitis B has a particu
larly large significance on a campus with such a
high percentage of Asian-Americans.
"Mam members of the Stanford community

have become my patients [at the Liver Clinic],"
he said.
I iepatitis B is a preventable disease.
"It's not like HIV," So explained. " There's
both treatment and a safe vaccine. Eight out of
10 college freshmen haven't been vaccinated.
Go get vaccinated and get a blood test to see if
you're infected with hepatitis B, especially if
you're Asian."
People can support the campaign by wearing
jade ribbons obtainable through the Asian Liver
Center's Web site: http://liver.stanford.edu. The
ribbons have a small loop, which resembles the
Chinese character for "people" to highlight the
campaign's emphasis on community.
So praised Stanford students for their hard
work at the center.
" There are 14 Stanford students working in
I he center," he added. "They've all played an im
portant role in the campaign. They're terrific."
JefFery Lee, an intern at the Asian Liver Cen
ter, spoke about his involvement.
"The experience has been one of the most re
warding and beneficial experiences of my life
thus far," he said.
"It's definitely a worthwhile [cause] that I am
veiy willing to invest my time and energy into."
