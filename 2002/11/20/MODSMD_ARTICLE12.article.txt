## Iraq vows to meet deadline 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —The chief U.N. weapons
inspectors, wrapping up a critical two-day visit, urged
Iraqi officials yesterday to Icx>k again in their nuclear,
chemical and biological "stocks and stores" to ensure
they have no weapons-making to report.
Iraq's position that it has no weapons of mass de
struction "must be convincingly shown by docu
mentation, by evidence," said Hans Blix, head of
the U.N. weapons-hunting team.
"We don't think that has yet been convincingly
done."
Blix and chief U.N. nuclear watchdog Mo
hamed Elßaradei spoke with reporters after Iraqi
officials confirmed they would meet a U.N. dead
line and file by Dec. 8 a comprehensive list of nu
clear, chemical and biological programs, including
any meant to develop weapons.
The two U.N. officials offered a "light at the end
of the tunnel" for Iraq, however, saying that if the
Baghdad government cooperates fully with their

inspections, they might be able to report in about
one year that it has complied with Security Council
requirements and that U.N. economic sanctions on
Iraq should be lifted.
Blix and Elßaradei, who depart today, led ad
vance teams of about two dozen U.N. officials who
returned to Baghdad on Monday to resume the
weapons inspection program that ended abruptly
four years ago. Additional inspectors arrive next
Monday, and their first field operations are expect
ed by Nov. 27.
The latest Security Council resolution calls the
inspections a "final opportunity" for Iraq to meet its
post-Gulf War obligations to give up any weapons
of mass destruction. President Bush has threatened
military action if the Iraqis don't disarm.
A seven-year inspection regime in the 1990s dis
mantled Iraq's nuclear program before it could
build a bomb, and destroyed large amounts of
chemical and biological weapons.
