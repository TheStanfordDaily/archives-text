# Oil tanker sinks close to Spain

### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — An oil
tanker carrying 20 million gallons
of fuel oil broke in two and sank
yesterday in the Atlantic Ocean,
threatening a spill nearly twice as
big as the Exxon Valdez's and an
environmental catastrophe along
a scenic Spanish coastline.
The hope was that the oil would
sink and harden in waters more
than two miles deep before it could
inflict disaster and engulf the area's
rich fishing grounds. But it has al
ready soiled 125 miles of Spanish
coastline, and its highly viscous and
toxic load is far bigger than the
10.92 million gallons dumped off

Alaska by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
As the Bahamas-flagged tanker
Prestige sank, it leaked between
800,000 to 1.02 million gallons of oil,
according to government estimates.
SMIT, the Dutch salvage company
hired to keep the ship afloat, esti
mated the spillage at 13 percent of its
load. Nor was it clear how much oil
might reach land, or where. Portu
gal said it was monitoring a slick 22
miles by one-third of a mile.
Shut out of Spanish and Por
tuguese ports after its hull split in a
storm six days ago, the tanker was
towed some 150 miles out to sea off
the coast of Spain's Galicia region.
When it finally capsized and sank

crews were already cleaning up
Galicia's coast, where an estimated
800,000 gallons of oil has contami
nated fisheries, blackened beaches
and killed wildlife.
The calamity has highlighted
concerns about older, single-hull
ships like the 26-year-old Prestige
that are due to be phased out by
2015 — and about what Europe
should do to keep them safe and
inspected in the meantime.
The European Union charged
yesterday that single-hull ships skirt
European ports to avoid tough new
EU-mandated inspection rules. It
urged national governments to
work harder to enforce them.
