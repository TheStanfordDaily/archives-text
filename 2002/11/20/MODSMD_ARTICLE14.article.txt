# Senate passes Homeland bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate voted decisively yesterday
to create a I lomeland Security De
partment, delivering a triumph to
President Bush and setting the
stage for the biggest government
reshuffling in a half-century as a
way to thwart and respond to ter
rorist attacks.
The final vote was 90-9, belying
bitter clashes that pitted Congress
against the White House and the
two parties against each other and
that prolonged work on the legisla
tion for nearly a year. Eight Democ
rats and independent Sen. James
Jeffords of Vermont voted no.
"It is landmark in its scope and
it ends a session which has seen two
years worth of legislative work

which lias been very productive
for the American people," Bush
told Senate Republican leaders
from Air Force One as he flew to
NA TO meetings in Europe.
The new Cabinet-level depart
ment will merge 22 agencies with
combined budgets of about $40
billion and employ 170,000 work
ers — the most grandiose federal
reorganization since the Defense
Department's birth in 1947.
Even so, it will take months for
the new agency to get fully off the
ground. And a budget stalemate
continues to block most of the extra
money for domestic security en
hancements both sides want for the
federal fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
The House overwhelmingly ap

proved the bill on Nov. 13, so the
Senate vote was the crucial, final
test. Because of technical changes
the Senate made, however, the
House is expected to provide final
congressional approval Friday
with an anticlimactic voice vote.
Senators cleared the way for the
final vote by rejecting, 52-47, a De
mocratic bid to block provisions that
will aid vaccine producers and other
industries. That vote came after Re
publican leaders made last-minute
concessions that ensured support
from four moderate senators.
"This bill still needs work," said
Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., voicing the mis
givings of Democrats who oppc >sed
the pro-industry provisions.
