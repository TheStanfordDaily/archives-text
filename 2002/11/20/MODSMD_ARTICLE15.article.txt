## The 						Stanford Daily Comprehensive review a necessary step to improve diversity 
### 
This past Thursday a committee es
tablished by the University of Cali
fornia Board of Regents' Academic
Senate released a report finding that
the comprehensive review admissions policy
has been successfully implemented. The poli
cy has been criticized by some as a way of get
ting around Proposition 209, which banned
the use of racial identity and sex as factors for
admissions to California public universities.
Prop. 209 restricts the ability of admissions
staff to accumulate all the information neces
sary to select the best candidates. Like Stan
ford, all universities should have the right to
use a variety of factors to deduce whether an
applicant should be admitted. The success of
the comprehensive review policy only rein
forces the need to evaluate UC applicants in a
holistic manner.

Published Since 1891

Under the comprehensive review policy,
students are evaluated according to 14 aca
demic and non-academic criteria. Some have
argued that the use of non-academic criteria
can hurt certain students' chances of gaining
admission. In particular, opponents criticize
the validity of the life challenges section,
which they say privileges applicants who
come from disadvantaged social or economic
environments.
First of all, such arguments are disproved by
the evidence released in last week's report.
Under the comprehensive review system, the
SAT scores and GPAs of accepted students re
mained at similar levels as compared to the
previous year's admissions level, when a ma
jority of students were admitted based solely
on academic criteria.
Secondly, such arguments seem to favor the

idea that standardized tests are the primary
yardstick for one's academic capacity. The pres
ident and founder of the Princeton Review be
lieves that the SAT does not measure intelli
gence or capacity and is only useful to compare
grading systems at different schools. Admis
sions counselors across the country agree. At
Berkeley, one admissions officer noted that
someone with low test scores who works two
jobs might be able to offer a lot to the campus.
Although racial identity is only one targeted
demographic within the comprehensive review
policy, the advancements in diversifying a stu
dent body from a racial standpoint cannot be ig
nored. Though one cannot automatically
equate hardships with racial background, this
policy begins to reiterate the importance of cam
pus diversity. The percentage of under-repre

Stanford and other elite private universities
consider a myriad of factors in their admissions
policies to create a diverse class. Comprehensive
review allows admissions officers to consider the
privileges some applicants might have on ac
count of the racial hierarchy that pervades
American society. To a certain degree, the new
comprehensive review admissions policy begins
to give admissions officers the kind of freedom
they deserve to select the best candidates, but
until Prop. 209 is repealed, they will not enjoy
the same freedoms Stanford does. Until then,
the Stanford community should be active in its
opposition to the legislation.
