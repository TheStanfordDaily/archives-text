## Cal (still) sucks 
### 
Now, normally we wouldn't even
think of writing a column about
the rivalry between Stanford
and Cal. What rivalry? The
term rivalry implies that there is some as
pect of the relationship between the two
parties that is competitive. What we have
here is merely petty jealousy.
For those of us who are seniors, we were
in eighth grade the last time Stanford lost
Big Game. It was also the last year that your
sexually repressed computer science TA
got any action. Not only that, but Stanford
has won 14 of the last 19 Big Games. So,

today, the first night of
Gaieties, it is only the bare
possibility of a Cal victory
this weekend that has re
minded us of the exis
tence of our less-accom
plished neighbors across
the Bay.
When one thinks of the
great collegiate rivalries,

one thinks about Michi
gan-Ohio State, Army-Navy, or Yale-Har
vard. However, when one looks at these ri
valries, one is struck by how similar the par
ticipants are. Midwest state school versus
Midwest state school, cadet versus midship
man, anal-retentive WASP versus anal-re
tentive WASP. Nowhere in the annals of
college sports do we see a rivaliy that pits
such an elite institution populated by eru
dite, sophisticated, not to mention well
groomed, students against a dirty, over
crowded lot of neo-hippies. To see the
Stanford Band march through the streets
of Berkeley evokes the image of a mighty
army of Adonises come to civilize the bar
barian horde. But seriously folks, it's Big
Game, which means anything can happen.
Although it did give up 52 points to the of
fensive genius that is Mackovic this past
weekend, Cal is a decent team on paper. For
example, of the six common opponents be
tween Stanford and Cal, Stanford lost by a
combined 107-215 (points for vs. points
against), while Cal nearly broke even at 192-
204. And, for those superstitious sports fans
out there, Cal has had an auspiciously good
season against Stanford in other sports —
take the men's soccer team 0-1-1 record vs.
Cal, the men's waterpolo team's 8-9 loss two
weeks ago, or the women's field hockey
team's 0-3 record vs. Cal this year (props go
to the women's soccer and volleyball teams
for their clean slates vs. Cal).
The numbers suggest there won't be any
Casey Moore cutting surreptitiously
through the middle or as many errant
Boiler passes this year. The experience will
be complicated by the 20th anniversary of
The Play (knee = down), which is likely to
be commemorated din ing pre-gatne, half
time and TV timeout ceremonies by the Cal
faithful. And so, when time runs out, before
Cal Chancellor Berdahl can even spell
SAT, the rabid Cal students — Ira Fried
man, mobilize the shots now — will most
likely circumvent the watchful gaze of all
three UC security guards to pour onto the

field. Evidently, last year's storming of the
court after their men's basketball win ver
sus Stanford, the first in the Bears' 11 tries,
just didn't get it out of their system. One can
only hope that they won't get within range
for the typical assualt of dense, blunt objects
(Tim's money is on increased use of the
frozen grapefruits; Alex is looking out for
the D batteries).
There are, of course, other types of ri
valries besides merely the athletic one.
One might, for example, look at the great
Internet wars of the late 19905. Yahoo ver
sus Excite versus Google. The casual on
looker was thrilled at the prospect of a
clash between these giants of the new
media. It was the '90s version of the Cola
Wars. And when the bubble burst, Excite
went into bankruptcy, and Yahoo started
charging for its online content. What les
son can we draw from this example? That
all of the aforementioned companies were
founded by Stanford alums! Of course,
some of them were failures, but they were
very, very wealthy failures. When we fail,
we fail spectacularly. But that isn't to say
that Cal grads didn't partake of the great
est economic boom the nation has ever
seen. We are sure that Jerry Yang kept a
few Bears around the office to get him cof
fee, or count his money. Coming from
such an underprivileged background is
something that anyone would need help
overcoming — perhaps Jerry Yang was
the inspiration for the dubious new UC
"life challenges" admissions policy.
Of course, money isn't everything, and to
show that we can be good sports too, we'd
like to make a suggestion. Two weeks ago,
we wrote a column in which we challenged
housed fraternities to legitimate their status
in the eyes of the student body, and we've
thought of a way they could do it. To add to
their community service portfolio, fraterni
ties could host a kiddie carnival and hire Cal
students to sit in the dunk tank. ITiat way we
could redistribute some of Stanford's wealth
to those less privileged than we are, as well as
help the neo-hippies start bathing. Or, the
ASSU could donate a portion of its $350,000
surplus to help the ASUC at Berkeley, which
is an equal amount in the red.
The ultimate irony is that even if Cal
wins the game and finishes the season with
a bowl-eligible record, they can't go to a
bowl game. This is not a sports column, so
we will not bore you with the details, but
suffice it to say that the NCAA does not per
mit cheaters to play in bowl games. We
would expect nothing less from a school
that tore up chunks of their own field four
years ago to throw at the jubilant Stanford
fans celebrating their fourth consecutive
win. Here's to hoping you make it out of
Memorial Stadium unscathed after Stan
ford's eighth straight Big Game win!

Alex Greninger and Tim Meyer would like to re
mind Cal students thai although you may un a this
Big Game, in 15 years you'll still be fired. E-mail
them atgerlrix@stanford.edu and tlmeyer(a)stan
ford.edu.
