Stewart's speech was not limited'
Ilie Daily's editorial of Nov. 19 about
Stanford Law School and Lynne Stewart
was inaccurate and misleading ("Law
School Dean should restore attorney's men
torship"). Ms. Stewart did not have her
speech limited nor were students denied ac
cess to her as you suggest. Rather she spoke
to students both formally and informally as
scheduled, without the title of "mentor."
Stewart was invited to speak at Stanford
Sch(X)l by students organizing a week
end conference called "Shaking the Foun
dations." The Law School's director of
public interest programs, on his own initia
tive, invited her to extend her visit to cam
pus in order to speak to students as a "Mills
Public Interest Mentor," an honor that is
normally given to very few attorneys a year
whom the school seeks to hold up as role
models.
When I learned during the week before
Stewart's visit that she had expressed sup
port for "directed violence directed at the
institutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism," and, in reference to the
Sept. 11 attacks, "armed struggle" with
civilian casualties, I made the decision to
proceed fully with Stewart's speaking en
gagements at the Law School but to rescind
the title of "Mills Mentor" in connection
with her visit.
This decision, consistent with academic
freedom and with ordinary First Amend

ment distinctions between providing a
forum for speech and placing an impri
matur of approval upon speech, enabled
Stewart to speak her views and be heard by
our students, while withholding the Law
School's endorsement.
Stewart completed all of her speaking
engagements at the Law School and met
with students as scheduled without inci
dent. The Law School of course has also
honored the original financial arrange
ments with Stewart; my letter of Nov. 8 to
Stewart rescinded the tide of "mentor" but
nothing else about her visit.

RCSC can 'touch and transform' lives
A bigger Black Community Services
Center is long overdue. The need for more
space is especially pressing now because of
the size of Stanford's black student commu
nity (which also includes a community of in
ternational students who self-identify as
black although they are not counted as such
by the University). If Stanford is going to
pride itself on having beaten out Harvard
in terms of African-American matricula
tion, then the University needs to make the
necessary provisions for this newly expand
ed community. Nevertheless, although the
need for more space seems most palpable
now because of the numbers, let us not for

get that this campaign for more space is
part of a much larger established move
ment that has been sustained over the years
by alumni, undergraduates, faculty, gradu
ate students and administrators of all races
and ethnicities.
The members of this movement have
come to recognize, as the whole University
now must, that the programming birthed
in the BCSC has had and will continue to
have invaluable relevance to the entire stu
dent body.Thus the BCSC is in dire need of
more space, not simply because of an in
crease in the number of black students, but
also because the time has come to demand
that this University show some institutional
support fora community that has histori
cally molded much of Stanford's academic,
social, cultural and political landscape. It is
important to clarify that the programming
that comes out of the BCSC is not just for
black students; it is, always has been and will
continue to be for all students be they Chi
cano, Latino, Native American, Asian,
black, white, international or of mixed race.
As a former BCSC staff member, I was both
hurt and awestruck by the miracles per
formed in that small house in the middle of
a parking lot.
The BCSC] has gone to great lengths and
made some incredible sacrifices to support,
affirm, guide, protect, nurture and educate
all students on this campus about race,
queer identity, gender identity, class privi
lege, sexism, elitism, the prison industrial
complex, white identity, colorism, sexuali
ty, African history, homophobia and a
whole host of other issues. But with more
space and more resources, there will be no
limit to the lives the BCSC can touch, trans
form and sustain here at Stanford.
Whether or not to gi ant the BCSC more
space ought not to be up for debate. Simi
larly, not granting the BCSC (and all the
community centers on campus for that
matter) more resources, even in the midst
of a budget crunch, ought not to be a viable
option. Expanding the BCSC and increas

ing its resource base may very well save a
student's life. As one of this University's
most valuable resources, we, the student
body, must require that the University
value all oi us. Bigger Black House Now! All
of our lives depend on it.

Sports column is 'deeply offensive'
I had the misfortune of reading
Spencer Porter's column of Nov. 19 titled
"Spencer and field hockey's infidelity." I
found myself deeply offended. Through
both his message and the manner in
which it is delivered, Porter succeeded in
expressing nothing but contempt for the
subject he was assigned to cover. By fram

ing his conflict with the field hockey team
as a "breakup," and by characterizing the
team itself as his "girlfriend," Porter dis
plays both a chauvinistic attitude toward
women's sports and a mistaken impres
sion that the field hockey team would ac
tually date him.
If the men's basketball team had ex
pressed displeasure at a theoretical arti
cle by Porter, would he have character
ized that rift as a "breakup"? Professor
Judith Jenkins George of the Women's
Sports Foundation has suggested it is the
responsibility of media outlets to aug
ment Title IX and the growth of
women's sports with appropriate news
coverage. This admirable endeavor must
be left to other journalists, for Porter
clearly is not up to the task. He concedes
he "knows very little about field hockey"

and even admits he missed the first half
of a game. I find it grossly irresponsible
that The Daily allowed a reporter with
little knowledge and a clear disdain for
his subject to continue in his capacity as a
source of news. If "quotes, attitudes and
how the season is going" are what people
want to hear, they must be tempered
with what people need to hear: objective
and informed accounts of the evolution
of a hard-working team. As for Porter s
fear of winning back the "least read
sport" title, I would remind him that the
women of the field hockey team do not
write his columns and are therefore an
inappropriate focus for his professional
frustrations.
In closing, I'd like to address the filler
box accompanying the column. 1 lie box
announces an opening in The I )aily's sports

department lor someone who is "able to
give .t damn about field hockey." As some
one who fits that description, I feel confi
dent in saving there are hundreds who
would gladly apply. 1 he field hockey team
is not a monolithic entity to be ridiculed, but
a collection of sisters, daughters and fellow
students, each supported by an enviable
network of friends and family. Ask any of
us, and you II get a story worth printing, a
story about sacrifice, adversity, will,
strength and triumph.

the title of "Mills Mentor" in connection
with her visit.
This decision, consistent with academic
freedom and with ordinary First Amend

ment distinctions between providing a
forum for speech and placing an impri
matur of approval upon speech, enabled
Stewart to speak her views and be heard by
our students, while withholding the Law

Stewart completed all of her speaking

RCSC can 'touch and transform' lives
A bigger Black Community Services
Center is long overdue. The need for more
space is especially pressing now because of
the size of Stanford's black student commu
nity (which also includes a community of in
ternational students who self-identify as
black although they are not counted as such
by the University). If Stanford is going to
pride itself on having beaten out Harvard
in terms of African-American matricula
tion, then the University needs to make the
necessary provisions for this newly expand
ed community. Nevertheless, although the
need for more space seems most palpable
now because of the numbers, let us not for

get that this campaign for more space is
part of a much larger established move
ment that has been sustained over the years
by alumni, undergraduates, faculty, gradu
ate students and administrators of all races
and ethnicities.
The members of this movement have
come to recognize, as the whole University
now must, that the programming birthed
in the BCSC has had and will continue to
have invaluable relevance to the entire stu
dent body.Thus the BCSC is in dire need of
more space, not simply because of an in
crease in the number of black students, but
also because the time has come to demand
that this University show some institutional
support fora community that has histori
cally molded much of Stanford's academic,
social, cultural and political landscape. It is
important to clarify that the programming
that comes out of the BCSC is not just for
black students; it is, always has been and will
continue to be for all students be they Chi
cano, Latino, Native American, Asian,
black, white, international or of mixed race.
As a former BCSC staff member, I was both
hurt and awestruck by the miracles per
formed in that small house in the middle of
a parking lot.
The BCSC] has gone to great lengths and
made some incredible sacrifices to support,
affirm, guide, protect, nurture and educate
all students on this campus about race,
queer identity, gender identity, class privi
lege, sexism, elitism, the prison industrial
complex, white identity, colorism, sexuali
ty, African history, homophobia and a
whole host of other issues. But with more
space and more resources, there will be no
limit to the lives the BCSC can touch, trans
form and sustain here at Stanford.
Whether or not to gi ant the BCSC more
space ought not to be up for debate. Simi
larly, not granting the BCSC (and all the
community centers on campus for that
matter) more resources, even in the midst
of a budget crunch, ought not to be a viable
option. Expanding the BCSC and increas

ing its resource base may very well save a
student's life. As one of this University's
most valuable resources, we, the student
body, must require that the University
value all oi us. Bigger Black House Now! All
of our lives depend on it.

Sports column is 'deeply offensive'
I had the misfortune of reading
Spencer Porter's column of Nov. 19 titled
"Spencer and field hockey's infidelity." I
found myself deeply offended. Through
both his message and the manner in
which it is delivered, Porter succeeded in
expressing nothing but contempt for the
subject he was assigned to cover. By fram

ing his conflict with the field hockey team
as a "breakup," and by characterizing the
team itself as his "girlfriend," Porter dis
plays both a chauvinistic attitude toward
women's sports and a mistaken impres
sion that the field hockey team would ac
tually date him.
If the men's basketball team had ex
pressed displeasure at a theoretical arti
cle by Porter, would he have character
ized that rift as a "breakup"? Professor
Judith Jenkins George of the Women's
Sports Foundation has suggested it is the
responsibility of media outlets to aug
ment Title IX and the growth of
women's sports with appropriate news
coverage. This admirable endeavor must
be left to other journalists, for Porter
clearly is not up to the task. He concedes
he "knows very little about field hockey"

and even admits he missed the first half
of a game. I find it grossly irresponsible
that The Daily allowed a reporter with
little knowledge and a clear disdain for
his subject to continue in his capacity as a
source of news. If "quotes, attitudes and
how the season is going" are what people
want to hear, they must be tempered
with what people need to hear: objective
and informed accounts of the evolution
of a hard-working team. As for Porter s
fear of winning back the "least read
sport" title, I would remind him that the
women of the field hockey team do not
write his columns and are therefore an
inappropriate focus for his professional
frustrations.
In closing, I'd like to address the filler
box accompanying the column. 1 lie box
announces an opening in The I )aily's sports

department lor someone who is "able to
give .t damn about field hockey." As some
one who fits that description, I feel confi
dent in saving there are hundreds who
would gladly apply. 1 he field hockey team
is not a monolithic entity to be ridiculed, but
a collection of sisters, daughters and fellow
students, each supported by an enviable
network of friends and family. Ask any of
us, and you II get a story worth printing, a
story about sacrifice, adversity, will,
strength and triumph.

Stewart's speech was not limited'
Ilie Daily's editorial of Nov. 19 about
Stanford Law School and Lynne Stewart
was inaccurate and misleading ("Law
School Dean should restore attorney's men
torship"). Ms. Stewart did not have her
speech limited nor were students denied ac
cess to her as you suggest. Rather she spoke
to students both formally and informally as
scheduled, without the title of "mentor."
Stewart was invited to speak at Stanford
Sch(X)l by students organizing a week
end conference called "Shaking the Foun
dations." The Law School's director of
public interest programs, on his own initia
tive, invited her to extend her visit to cam
pus in order to speak to students as a "Mills
Public Interest Mentor," an honor that is
normally given to very few attorneys a year
whom the school seeks to hold up as role
models.
When I learned during the week before
Stewart's visit that she had expressed sup
port for "directed violence directed at the
institutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism," and, in reference to the
Sept. 11 attacks, "armed struggle" with
civilian casualties, I made the decision to
proceed fully with Stewart's speaking en
gagements at the Law School but to rescind
the title of "Mills Mentor" in connection
