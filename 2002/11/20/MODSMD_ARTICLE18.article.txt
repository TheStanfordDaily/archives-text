Stewart's speech was not limited'
Ilie Daily's editorial of Nov. 19 about
Stanford Law School and Lynne Stewart
was inaccurate and misleading ("Law
School Dean should restore attorney's men
torship"). Ms. Stewart did not have her
speech limited nor were students denied ac
cess to her as you suggest. Rather she spoke
to students both formally and informally as
scheduled, without the title of "mentor."
Stewart was invited to speak at Stanford
Sch(X)l by students organizing a week
end conference called "Shaking the Foun
dations." The Law School's director of
public interest programs, on his own initia
tive, invited her to extend her visit to cam
pus in order to speak to students as a "Mills
Public Interest Mentor," an honor that is
normally given to very few attorneys a year
whom the school seeks to hold up as role
models.
When I learned during the week before
Stewart's visit that she had expressed sup
port for "directed violence directed at the
institutions which perpetuate capitalism,
racism and sexism," and, in reference to the
Sept. 11 attacks, "armed struggle" with
civilian casualties, I made the decision to
proceed fully with Stewart's speaking en
gagements at the Law School but to rescind
the title of "Mills Mentor" in connection
with her visit.
This decision, consistent with academic
freedom and with ordinary First Amend

ment distinctions between providing a
forum for speech and placing an impri
matur of approval upon speech, enabled
Stewart to speak her views and be heard by
our students, while withholding the Law
School's endorsement.
Stewart completed all of her speaking
engagements at the Law School and met
with students as scheduled without inci
dent. The Law School of course has also
honored the original financial arrange
ments with Stewart; my letter of Nov. 8 to
Stewart rescinded the tide of "mentor" but
nothing else about her visit.

RCSC can 'touch and transform' lives
A bigger Black Community Services
Center is long overdue. The need for more
space is especially pressing now because of
the size of Stanford's black student commu
nity (which also includes a community of in
ternational students who self-identify as
black although they are not counted as such
by the University). If Stanford is going to
pride itself on having beaten out Harvard
in terms of African-American matricula
tion, then the University needs to make the
necessary provisions for this newly expand
ed community. Nevertheless, although the
need for more space seems most palpable
now because of the numbers, let us not for

get that this campaign for more space is
part of a much larger established move
ment that has been sustained over the years
by alumni, undergraduates, faculty, gradu
ate students and administrators of all races
and ethnicities.
The members of this movement have
come to recognize, as the whole University
now must, that the programming birthed
in the BCSC has had and will continue to
have invaluable relevance to the entire stu
dent body.Thus the BCSC is in dire need of
more space, not simply because of an in
crease in the number of black students, but
also because the time has come to demand
that this University show some institutional
support fora community that has histori
cally molded much of Stanford's academic,
social, cultural and political landscape. It is
important to clarify that the programming
that comes out of the BCSC is not just for
black students; it is, always has been and will
continue to be for all students be they Chi
cano, Latino, Native American, Asian,
black, white, international or of mixed race.
As a former BCSC staff member, I was both
hurt and awestruck by the miracles per
formed in that small house in the middle of
a parking lot.
The BCSC] has gone to great lengths and
made some incredible sacrifices to support,
affirm, guide, protect, nurture and educate
all students on this campus about race,
