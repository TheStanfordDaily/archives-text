# HIGH WATER RISING
## Iraq: If inspections don't work, what should we do next? 
### 
In the early morning hours of June 7,
1981, nine Israeli fighter jets destroyed
a nearly-completed nuclear reactor at
Osirak, Iraq. In the aftermath of this strike,
roundly condemned by the international
community, Israel declared: "Under no cir
cumstances will we allow an enemy to de
velop weapons of mass destruction against
our people." Were Israel slightly less vigi
lant, Saddam Hussein would have pos
sessed a nuclear weapons capability over 20
years ago.
Today, the scenario averted by Israeli
strategic acumen looms again. Since the
severe depletion of Saddam's conven
tional weapons infrastructure in the Gull
War (accompanied by a clear atrophying
of loyalty to his Ba'athist regime among
Iraq's national army), he has refocused
his energies on bolstering his arsenal of
weapons of mass destruction. He har
bors stockpiles of weaponized Anthrax,
VX nerve gas and Sarin (which he used
against Kurdish villages). The creation of
a crude nuclear device is high on his to
do list, and in all likelihood, he'll be able
to check it off soon enough.
We are not certain of this last point, in
the sense that we can't prove it. The rea
son we can't prove it is because Saddam,

over the last 10 years,
has systematically
thwarted the efforts of
U.N. weapons inspec
tors to pinpoint the ex
tent and magnitude of
his nuclear program.
His scientists no longer
work with large reactors
like the one Israel de-

stroyed, but rather in highly portable
laboratories that are nearly impossible to
discover in the face of local resistance.
The efforts of the new U.N. inspections
team will likely be subject to similar set
backs and frustrations.
Some voices advocate ignoring the
threat altogether in the interest of preserv
ing the sacred democratic precedent that
bars preemptive strikes without compelling
evidence of imminent attack. Needless to
say, they ignore some heavy strategic reali
ties in constructing their argument.
Indeed, in a world increasingly charac
terized by asymmetric threats — most no
tably a blatant disregard of the rules gov
erningconflict by rogue state actors and ter
rorists — we can no longer afford, as De
fense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld often ad
monishes, to equate the absence of evi

dence of a threat with evidence of its ab
sence. Since political assassinations are cur
rently barred by executive order — a bur
dening and dated policy, as former Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher pointed
out on a recent visit to Stanford —a military
strike stands as the only lawful method of
unseating Saddam.
Former weapons inspectors assert al
most uniformly that Saddam's WMD pro
gram is his highest priority, superseding
even lucrative oil exports (U.N. Resolution
687 was intended to make him choose be
tween weapons and commerce: He chose
the former). Charles Duelfer, who served as
deputy executive chairman of UNSCOM
from 1993 to 1990, notes that "Baghdad
learned from the Gulf War... that nuclear
weapons are even more important than
they had thought. . . Certainly, Saddam
Hussein understands that today's debate
about invading Iraq to effect regime
change would not be taking place if Bagh
dad could threaten to hit U.S. forces or Is
rael with a nuclear weapon."
It is also worth noting that according to
Resolution 687, the burden of proof was on
Iraq to demonstrate that it has desisted
from producing WMDs and was actively
dismantling them. In the old inspection sys

tem, Saddam broke promise after promise:
He diverted money from the oil-for-food
initiative to his weapons programs; lie kept
inspectors sitting in empty parking lots li>i
days as his mobile stockpiles were trans
ported to secret locations.
The Bush administration's success in de
manding a new resolution with teeth un
derscores a vital unwillingness to let such a
charade persist without a military response.
Imagine how much worse the situation
would become if Saddam could have re
sponded to this new round of inspections
with the announcement that he had placed
a crude nuclear device in lei Aviv or San
Francisco, and would detonate it if the I.N.
team entered Baghdad. We simply cannot
let him get there.
The decision to unseat a despot bent on
bolstering his arsenal of death should be
pursued with maximum diplomacy, but
with no compromise on the fundamental
strategic goal. It is fortunate that the ad
ministration elected to work with the l .N.
so far, and hopefully, such cooperation
will continue. But if Saddam further
breaches the resolutions of the Securit\
Council — he has already muddied the
waters by shooting at U.S. and British
planes in Iraq's no-fly zones over the last

lew days — oil! friends and allies around
tlu* world must keep their word and sup
pot t a military strike.
As Benjamin Netanyahu said, "If action
is not taken now, we will all be threatened
In <i much greater peril. . . it is possible
today to delend against chemical and bio
logical attack . . . but no gas mask and vac
cine can prevent against nuclear weapons."
And as the recent developments in
North Korea have demonstrated, once a
dictator has a nuclear capability, the game
changes, radically and forever: 1 Usability to
ruthlessly oppress his people, unmolested,
would be guaranteed; expansionist incur
sions into neighboring countries would be
unstoppable (as would alliances with al-
Qaida and other terrorist networks); a final
gesture of megaloinaniacal rage from his
deathbed, manifested in a warhead de
ployed to an enemy's c apital, would be un
fathomably devastating. "Under no cir
cumstances will we allow an enemy to de
velop weapons of mass destruction against
our people." Ihe declaration rings truer
now than evei. Saddam must be stopped.

ties in constructing their argument.
Indeed, in a world increasingly charac
terized by asymmetric threats — most no
tably a blatant disregard of the rules gov
erningconflict by rogue state actors and ter
rorists — we can no longer afford, as De
fense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld often ad
monishes, to equate the absence of evi

dence of a threat with evidence of its ab
sence. Since political assassinations are cur
rently barred by executive order — a bur
dening and dated policy, as former Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher pointed
out on a recent visit to Stanford —a military
strike stands as the only lawful method of
unseating Saddam.
Former weapons inspectors assert al
most uniformly that Saddam's WMD pro
gram is his highest priority, superseding
even lucrative oil exports (U.N. Resolution
687 was intended to make him choose be
tween weapons and commerce: He chose
the former). Charles Duelfer, who served as
deputy executive chairman of UNSCOM
from 1993 to 1990, notes that "Baghdad
learned from the Gulf War... that nuclear
weapons are even more important than
they had thought. . . Certainly, Saddam
Hussein understands that today's debate
about invading Iraq to effect regime
change would not be taking place if Bagh
dad could threaten to hit U.S. forces or Is
rael with a nuclear weapon."
It is also worth noting that according to
Resolution 687, the burden of proof was on
Iraq to demonstrate that it has desisted
from producing WMDs and was actively
dismantling them. In the old inspection sys

tem, Saddam broke promise after promise:
He diverted money from the oil-for-food
initiative to his weapons programs; lie kept
inspectors sitting in empty parking lots li>i
days as his mobile stockpiles were trans
ported to secret locations.
The Bush administration's success in de
manding a new resolution with teeth un
derscores a vital unwillingness to let such a
charade persist without a military response.
Imagine how much worse the situation
would become if Saddam could have re
sponded to this new round of inspections
with the announcement that he had placed
a crude nuclear device in lei Aviv or San
Francisco, and would detonate it if the I.N.
team entered Baghdad. We simply cannot
let him get there.
The decision to unseat a despot bent on
bolstering his arsenal of death should be
pursued with maximum diplomacy, but
with no compromise on the fundamental
strategic goal. It is fortunate that the ad
ministration elected to work with the l .N.
so far, and hopefully, such cooperation
will continue. But if Saddam further
breaches the resolutions of the Securit\
Council — he has already muddied the
waters by shooting at U.S. and British
planes in Iraq's no-fly zones over the last

lew days — oil! friends and allies around
tlu* world must keep their word and sup
pot t a military strike.
As Benjamin Netanyahu said, "If action
is not taken now, we will all be threatened
In <i much greater peril. . . it is possible
today to delend against chemical and bio
logical attack . . . but no gas mask and vac
cine can prevent against nuclear weapons."
And as the recent developments in
North Korea have demonstrated, once a
dictator has a nuclear capability, the game
changes, radically and forever: 1 Usability to
ruthlessly oppress his people, unmolested,
would be guaranteed; expansionist incur
sions into neighboring countries would be
unstoppable (as would alliances with al-
Qaida and other terrorist networks); a final
gesture of megaloinaniacal rage from his
deathbed, manifested in a warhead de
ployed to an enemy's c apital, would be un
fathomably devastating. "Under no cir
cumstances will we allow an enemy to de
velop weapons of mass destruction against
our people." Ihe declaration rings truer
now than evei. Saddam must be stopped.

In the early morning hours of June 7,
1981, nine Israeli fighter jets destroyed
a nearly-completed nuclear reactor at
Osirak, Iraq. In the aftermath of this strike,
roundly condemned by the international
community, Israel declared: "Under no cir
cumstances will we allow an enemy to de
velop weapons of mass destruction against
our people." Were Israel slightly less vigi
lant, Saddam Hussein would have pos
sessed a nuclear weapons capability over 20
years ago.
Today, the scenario averted by Israeli
strategic acumen looms again. Since the
severe depletion of Saddam's conven
tional weapons infrastructure in the Gull
War (accompanied by a clear atrophying
of loyalty to his Ba'athist regime among
Iraq's national army), he has refocused
his energies on bolstering his arsenal of
weapons of mass destruction. He har
bors stockpiles of weaponized Anthrax,
VX nerve gas and Sarin (which he used
against Kurdish villages). The creation of
a crude nuclear device is high on his to
do list, and in all likelihood, he'll be able
to check it off soon enough.
We are not certain of this last point, in
the sense that we can't prove it. The rea
son we can't prove it is because Saddam,

over the last 10 years,
has systematically
thwarted the efforts of
U.N. weapons inspec
tors to pinpoint the ex
tent and magnitude of
his nuclear program.
His scientists no longer
work with large reactors
like the one Israel de-

stroyed, but rather in highly portable
laboratories that are nearly impossible to
discover in the face of local resistance.
The efforts of the new U.N. inspections
team will likely be subject to similar set
backs and frustrations.
Some voices advocate ignoring the
threat altogether in the interest of preserv
ing the sacred democratic precedent that
bars preemptive strikes without compelling
evidence of imminent attack. Needless to
say, they ignore some heavy strategic reali
ties in constructing their argument.
Indeed, in a world increasingly charac
terized by asymmetric threats — most no
tably a blatant disregard of the rules gov
erningconflict by rogue state actors and ter
rorists — we can no longer afford, as De
fense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld often ad
