# Faculty optimistic about Bio-X program's potential
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the upcoming completion of the
Clark Center for Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences and a variety of interdiscipli
nary initiatives authorized last month by
University President John Hennessy, Stan
ford's fledgling Bio-X program is rapidly
working to close the divide between on-cam
pus science disciplines.
The innovative research effort has united
faculty members and students from the
School of Earth Sciences, the School of Engi
neering, the School of Humanities and Sci

ences and the School of Medicine.
"I think that it is an extraordinarily
provocative program that is all about en
couraging the intersection of the science
teaching and research that is currently going
on," said Beth Kane, director of operations
at Bio-X. "The real 'wow' is in the potential
of the collaborations that we'll see."
Matthew Scott, a professor of develop
mental biology and of genetics, is the cur
rent chair of the Bio-X Leadership Council.
He stated that Stanford already has accu
mulated a broad history of using interdisci-

plinary efforts to address biologi
cal problems.
"Despite these successes, it is
quite clear biologists have limited
knowledge of the enormous capa
bilities in the engineering depart
ments," Scott said. "Conversely,
there is limited knowledge in engi
neering of the mysteries of biology
that people want to explore."
Scott said he believes that by
bringing together individuals from
these different fields and having
them collaborate, research
progress will reach new levels.
"Where will they meet each
other?" Scott said. "We are trying
to answer that in part with the
Clark Center — it will be a gather
ing place for people in all these
fields. All of these things will be rep
resented in that building, with 40
faculty members and their re
search groups."
Maggie Brugett, project manag

er for the construction of the Clark
Center, said that the new Bio-X
building is currently scheduled to
open June 2003.
"Construction is moving very
rapidly and is approximately 70
percent complete," Brugett said,
"fit] is. funded by a gift from Jim
Clark and an anonymous donor."
She explained that the building
"has highly visible lab space, exteri
or circulation and shared equip
ment. It fosters collaboration by
providing flexible lab space, an
open work plan, a centralized site
and adaptable infrastructure."
Brugett added that the building
will facilitate further interaction
among faculty and students by in
cluding social spaces such as a cafe
and classrooms.
Last October, according to
Kane, 21 Bio-X proposals were
granted a total of $3 million in
funding from the Interdisciplinary
Initiatives Program.
"These grants promote bound
ary-breaking investigations and
provide a jump start to worthy pro
jects that have the potential to re

shape the research agenda," Hen
nessy said. " This type of collabora
tive innovation is the heart and soul
of the Bio-X initiative, and the Uni
versity is proud to encourage our
faculty in their efforts to think cre
atively about the scientific chal
lenges we face."
Scott identified a number ofcur
rent ongoing research projects
within Bio-X, including the imag
ing of cells and tissues, protein fold
ing, the physics and biology of sin
gle protein molecules, chemical bi
ology and biodesign.
However, Scott explained that
"what is exciting will continue to
change — the idea is to promote
the entry of Stanford people into
new fields."
Biochemistry Prof. Jim Spu
dich, co-founder and previous
chair of the Bio-X program, ex
plained, "The way it started was by
a collaboration between myself in
biochemistry and Steve Chu in
physics. We had a unique collabo
ration in that our students actually
physically moved to each other's
laboratories and worked there for

long periods of time."
About five years ago, Spudich
said Chu and he approached vari
ous University administration
members about creating a more
permanent interdisciplinary effort.
"The leadership of the Universi
ty bought into this idea and told us
to form a faculty group who would
come forth with a more detailed
recommendation," he continued.
"After this, it became a fairly major
effort on the part of a large number
of faculty from these different disci
plines working together with archi
tects and the Facilities Planning Of
fice to put together [the Clark Cen
ter] and also to develop the ideas of
what this broader Bio-X campus
program would be."
Spudich said that he felt "the
idea has moved forward in quite a
robust way."
According to Kane, Bio-X's
prospects appear quite promising
as of now.
"There is a lot going on — a lot
more dialogues and discussions,"
Kane said. "The momentum is re
ally growing."

open June 2003.

rapidly and is approximately 70
percent complete," Brugett said,
"fit] is. funded by a gift from Jim
Clark and an anonymous donor."
She explained that the building
"has highly visible lab space, exteri
or circulation and shared equip
ment. It fosters collaboration by
providing flexible lab space, an
open work plan, a centralized site
and adaptable infrastructure."
Brugett added that the building
will facilitate further interaction
among faculty and students by in
cluding social spaces such as a cafe
and classrooms.
Last October, according to
Kane, 21 Bio-X proposals were
granted a total of $3 million in
funding from the Interdisciplinary
Initiatives Program.
"These grants promote bound
ary-breaking investigations and
provide a jump start to worthy pro
jects that have the potential to re

shape the research agenda," Hen
nessy said. " This type of collabora
tive innovation is the heart and soul
of the Bio-X initiative, and the Uni
versity is proud to encourage our
faculty in their efforts to think cre
atively about the scientific chal
lenges we face."
Scott identified a number ofcur
rent ongoing research projects
within Bio-X, including the imag

ing, the physics and biology of sin

However, Scott explained that
"what is exciting will continue to
change — the idea is to promote
the entry of Stanford people into
new fields."
Biochemistry Prof. Jim Spu
dich, co-founder and previous
chair of the Bio-X program, ex
plained, "The way it started was by
a collaboration between myself in
biochemistry and Steve Chu in
physics. We had a unique collabo
ration in that our students actually
physically moved to each other's
laboratories and worked there for

long periods of time."
About five years ago, Spudich
said Chu and he approached vari
ous University administration
members about creating a more
permanent interdisciplinary effort.
"The leadership of the Universi
ty bought into this idea and told us
to form a faculty group who would
come forth with a more detailed
recommendation," he continued.
"After this, it became a fairly major
effort on the part of a large number
of faculty from these different disci
plines working together with archi
tects and the Facilities Planning Of
fice to put together [the Clark Cen
ter] and also to develop the ideas of
what this broader Bio-X campus
program would be."
Spudich said that he felt "the
idea has moved forward in quite a
robust way."
According to Kane, Bio-X's
prospects appear quite promising
as of now.
"There is a lot going on — a lot
more dialogues and discussions,"
Kane said. "The momentum is re
ally growing."
With the upcoming completion of the
Clark Center for Biomedical Engineering
and Sciences and a variety of interdiscipli
nary initiatives authorized last month by
University President John Hennessy, Stan
ford's fledgling Bio-X program is rapidly
working to close the divide between on-cam
pus science disciplines.
The innovative research effort has united
faculty members and students from the
School of Earth Sciences, the School of Engi
neering, the School of Humanities and Sci

ences and the School of Medicine.
"I think that it is an extraordinarily
provocative program that is all about en
couraging the intersection of the science
teaching and research that is currently going
on," said Beth Kane, director of operations
at Bio-X. "The real 'wow' is in the potential
of the collaborations that we'll see."
Matthew Scott, a professor of develop
mental biology and of genetics, is the cur

He stated that Stanford already has accu

plinary efforts to address biologi
cal problems.
"Despite these successes, it is
quite clear biologists have limited
knowledge of the enormous capa
bilities in the engineering depart
ments," Scott said. "Conversely,
there is limited knowledge in engi
neering of the mysteries of biology
that people want to explore."
Scott said he believes that by
bringing together individuals from
these different fields and having
them collaborate, research
progress will reach new levels.
"Where will they meet each
other?" Scott said. "We are trying
to answer that in part with the
Clark Center — it will be a gather
ing place for people in all these
fields. All of these things will be rep
resented in that building, with 40
faculty members and their re
search groups."
