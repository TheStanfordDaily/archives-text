# $12,500 prize supports emerging authors
## 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Emerging writers often face an uphill
struggle for recognition in a field where only
the top names have any sort of fame. But a
new competition is aiming to change that by
exposing and rewarding new talent. The
Stanford University Libraries and the William
Saroyan Foundation together are sponsoring
the William Saroyan International Prize for
Writing, a contest for newly published works
of fiction.
In its first year, the biennial competition of
fers a $ 12,500 prize to the winner, who will be
chosen by a panel of judges.
"The contest is a vehicle for encouraging
and rewarding promising writers," said An
drew Herkovic, head of foundation rela
tions and strategic projects at the Stanford
University Libraries. "As it requires entries
to be published books, it is also, in part, a
way to encourage and engage with publish
ers, particularly to foster and support their
willingness to publish works of merit, as op
posed to selection for guaranteed sales to
the chain bookstores."
Entries must have been published in the
2002 calendar year and written in English,

but they can be any work of fiction — novels,
short stories, dramas and memoirs are all eli
gible. In addition, anyone can submit a book,
as long as it has been published.
"The Saroyan Writing Prize is in part in
tended to highlight the legacy of the 20th-cen
tury writer [William Saroyan], whose archive
constitutes part of our special collections,"
Stanford University Librarian Michael A.
Keller told the Stanford Report. "Our major
goal, however, is for the prize to bring mean
ingful and lasting attention to emerging writ
ers of real note. We can only approach that
goal if we receive a critical volume of com
pelling work — pun intended."
The prize was a goal of Saroyan himself,
who late in his life wanted to encourage up
coming writers.
But the objective of the contest isn't just
highlighting new works of fiction.
"There are several purposes," Herkovic
said. "[They include] keeping Saroyan's
name before the public and reminding the
reading public of his highly varied output
and distinctive style and perspective; inform
ing the scholarly community of the presence
of the Saroyan Archives at Stanford and thus
attracting research use of that collection, as
well as the many other special collections we

steward; encouraging literary publishing;
[and] recognizing and encouraging talented
writers.
"Which is the main purpose depends on
whom you ask. It is certainly good for Stan
ford to be engaged in this way with the read
ing public and general publishing."
While students are not involved in the
process of selecting a final winning entry, they
are encouraged to take part in the screening
of the applications.
According to the competition guidelines,
"Nominating jurors for the prize are appoint
ed by the William Saroyan International Prize
For Writing Committee. They are invited to
exercise their independent and collective
judgment and submit three nominations."
After the entries are screened, a panel of
judges will take the nominations and either
choose one winner from among the nomina
tions or submit their own. Cairrendy the panel
includes poet Eavan Boland, who is the Bella
Mabury and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor
in Humanities; author Stina Katchadourian;
and Hank Saroyan, a two-time Emmy Award
winning writer, producer and director.
The deadline for submitting entries is Jan.
31, 2003. More information can be found at
