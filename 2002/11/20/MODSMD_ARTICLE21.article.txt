# EPA board members vow to oust superintendent
## Move could create shake-up in troubled Ravenswood district 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three new officials running cam
paigns promising the ouster of Su
perintendent Charlie Mae Knight
were recently elected to East Palo
Alto's Ravenswood School District
board, defeating two incumbents
and several challengers. The district
is one in which University service
groups such as Ravenswood Reads
and East Palo Alto Stanford Acade
my are heavily involved.
Todd Gaviglio, Marcelino
Lopez and Adam Mitchell
promised in their campaign plat
forms to remove Knight and re
form the long-troubled school dis

trict. These three now constitute a
majority on the five-member
board, so Knight's dismissal may
be imminent.
Knight's administration has re
cently been dogged by legal dis
putes and accusations of misman
agement. Last year, she was ac
quitted on 19 felony conflict-of-in
terest charges involving allega
tions that she profited from
school-district loans to employees
who owed her money.
The district's alleged failure to
serve children with disabilities has
led to the threat of a state
takeover. The district is near
bankruptcy, and its legal fees for
this year have been approximate
ly seven million dollars. Fewer
than half of the district's middle
school graduates go on to gradu
ate from high school, and
Ravenswood has difficulty in re
taining teachers.

Gaviglio, Lopez and Mitchell
have vowed to place Knight on ad -
ministrative leave as soon as they
take office in December, pleasing a
large number of parents and
teachers who have organized
meetings demanding Knight's re
moval and fiercely campaigning
against her supporters.
"Money is going to be spent on
our kids, not on lawyers and trips,"
Lopez said.
Knight was not available for
comment, and The Daily was un
able to reach anyone in the district
who identified themselves as a sup
porter of hers.
While some are unsure of
whether a new superintendent is the
right solution for Ravenswood,
Knight's detractors believe diat her
removal could be die dawn of a turn
around for the district's schools.
Knight has been in office for as
long or longer than many of the

Stanford programs that deal with
the district. The Ravenswood
Reads program, for example, was
founded a year after Knight be
came superintendent in 1985.
However, Jesse Moya, coordi
nator of Ravenswood Reads, said
that the program has no direct
communication with Knight and
that he works mainly with the dis
trict's assistant superintendent.
"We're just working with the
schools," he said, indicating that
it is not the program's policy to
get involved with the politics of
the system.
Suzanne Abel, director of ex
ternal relations and develop
ment for the Haas Center, was
similarly reticent.
"The elections are a community
issue, and we work with the com
munity, but our focus is on the
schools," she said, declining to
comment further.
