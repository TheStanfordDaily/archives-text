## Card faces test against No. 11 Xavier All-American forward David West and his Musketeers battle the Cardinal at Maples tonight 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tonight, Stanford gets to play the game it
wanted all along. Forget unranked Boston Uni
versity. Forget the Preseason NIT.
Right now, its about No. 11 Xavier at Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:15 p.m.

Men's Basketball

vs. No. 11 Xavier, Tonight, 7:15 p.m., NIT Quarterfinal

Fora Cardinal squad that isn't being given
its usual national attention early in the season, a
win in tonight's NIT quarterfinal game would
mean more than a Thanksgiving in New York
for the NIT semifinals.
"Anytime you get a chance to go up against a
top team like Xavier — and you're not a big
team yourself, you're not ranked in the presea
son top 25, and you can even contend with
them or beat them — that can do a lot for your
team and your standing," said junior forward
Justin Davis. "So if we can just go into the Pre
season NIT and play hard and get our names
out there, it will do a lot for us."
Which, of course, is not to say that that's
going to be easy — the Musketeers are No. 11
fora reason. Xavier returns an experienced

group that gave Oklahoma, an eventual Final
Four team, all it could handle before succumb
ing 78-65 in the second round of the NCAA
tournament last season.
The Musketeers return four big playmakers
from last year's team, including preseason Ail-
American David West. The 6-foot-9 240-
pound forward averaged 18.5 points per game
and 9.8 rebounds last season and is a frontrun
ner in the National Player of the Year race. Ju
nior shooting guard Romain Sato (16.1 ppg,
6.6 rpg), senior point guard Lionel Chalmers
(12 ppg, 4.2 apg) and senior forward David
Young (8 ppg) also return from a team that
won 26 games last year.
" They've got a great inside-outside game,
and West will be a big challenge for our guys,"
said Stanford freshman forward Matt Haryasz.
"I think everyone on the team is really looking
forward to getting out there and seeing where
we're at. We're just going to battle hard and
give it all we've got."
But perhaps more significant than Xavier's
obvious offensive accomplishments is the idea
that the Musketeer squad is a defensive-mind
ed team. Just to put the defensive capabilities of
Xavier in perspective, the Musketeers held
their opponents to 62.6 points per game last
season. And in their first round Preseason NIT
game, the Musketeers forced Saint Peter's to
miss 17 of its first 20 shots.
Monday night against BU, Stanford took
6:19 to score its first basket and finished the first
half shooting only 25 percent from the field.
Needless to say, if the Cardinal hopes to be sue

cessful tonight, a repeat of that poor first-half
shooting performance cannot occur.
"Last night, we got a little down [on our
selves] and stopped shooting the ball, but that
just can't happen [tonight]," said sophomore
swingman Josh Childress. "We have to come
out ready to play, because if you let a top team
like Xavier get out on you early, it's hard to get
back in the game."
"It's a good challenge fora young team,"
added freshman wing Dan Grunfeld, who
came off the bench on Monday and provided
an offensive lift for the Cardinal. "[Hopeful
ly,] we can come out a little more relaxed, play
our game and make shots. We didn't really
make too many shots in the first half [against
BU]. But we've been there now; we've settled
down, and we're ready to play well and make
some shots."
If Xavier has any weakness at all — and
that's a big "if' — it may be the lack of depth it
has coming off the bench. After the starting
five, there is only one player that has averaged
more than 10 minutes per game, meaning
that foul trouble is definitely a concern for the
Musketeers.
But aside from all the facts and figures, the
big question on the minds of Stanford fans is
whether or not there's any room to hope fora
Cardinal victory tonight.
Forget all of the speculation — Monday
night's shooting percentages, last season's ac
complishments, this year's preseason national
rankings. Right now, the only question worthy
of consideration is: Can Stanford contend?

shooting performance cannot occur.
"Last night, we got a little down [on our
selves] and stopped shooting the ball, but that
just can't happen [tonight]," said sophomore
swingman Josh Childress. "We have to come
out ready to play, because if you let a top team
like Xavier get out on you early, it's hard to get
back in the game."
"It's a good challenge fora young team,"
added freshman wing Dan Grunfeld, who
came off the bench on Monday and provided
an offensive lift for the Cardinal. "[Hopeful
ly,] we can come out a little more relaxed, play
our game and make shots. We didn't really
make too many shots in the first half [against
BU]. But we've been there now; we've settled
down, and we're ready to play well and make
some shots."
If Xavier has any weakness at all — and
that's a big "if' — it may be the lack of depth it
has coming off the bench. After the starting
five, there is only one player that has averaged
more than 10 minutes per game, meaning
that foul trouble is definitely a concern for the
Musketeers.
But aside from all the facts and figures, the
big question on the minds of Stanford fans is
whether or not there's any room to hope fora
Cardinal victory tonight.
Forget all of the speculation — Monday
night's shooting percentages, last season's ac
complishments, this year's preseason national
rankings. Right now, the only question worthy
of consideration is: Can Stanford contend?

Tonight, Stanford gets to play the game it
wanted all along. Forget unranked Boston Uni
versity. Forget the Preseason NIT.
Right now, its about No. 11 Xavier at Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:15 p.m.

Men's Basketball

vs. No. 11 Xavier, Tonight, 7:15 p.m., NIT Quarterfinal

Fora Cardinal squad that isn't being given
its usual national attention early in the season, a
win in tonight's NIT quarterfinal game would
mean more than a Thanksgiving in New York
for the NIT semifinals.
"Anytime you get a chance to go up against a
top team like Xavier — and you're not a big
team yourself, you're not ranked in the presea
son top 25, and you can even contend with
them or beat them — that can do a lot for your
team and your standing," said junior forward
Justin Davis. "So if we can just go into the Pre
season NIT and play hard and get our names
out there, it will do a lot for us."
Which, of course, is not to say that that's
going to be easy — the Musketeers are No. 11
fora reason. Xavier returns an experienced

group that gave Oklahoma, an eventual Final
Four team, all it could handle before succumb
ing 78-65 in the second round of the NCAA
tournament last season.
The Musketeers return four big playmakers
from last year's team, including preseason Ail-
American David West. The 6-foot-9 240-
pound forward averaged 18.5 points per game
and 9.8 rebounds last season and is a frontrun
ner in the National Player of the Year race. Ju
nior shooting guard Romain Sato (16.1 ppg,
6.6 rpg), senior point guard Lionel Chalmers
(12 ppg, 4.2 apg) and senior forward David
Young (8 ppg) also return from a team that
won 26 games last year.
" They've got a great inside-outside game,
and West will be a big challenge for our guys,"
said Stanford freshman forward Matt Haryasz.
"I think everyone on the team is really looking
forward to getting out there and seeing where
we're at. We're just going to battle hard and
give it all we've got."
But perhaps more significant than Xavier's
obvious offensive accomplishments is the idea
that the Musketeer squad is a defensive-mind
ed team. Just to put the defensive capabilities of
Xavier in perspective, the Musketeers held
their opponents to 62.6 points per game last
season. And in their first round Preseason NIT
game, the Musketeers forced Saint Peter's to
miss 17 of its first 20 shots.
Monday night against BU, Stanford took
6:19 to score its first basket and finished the first
half shooting only 25 percent from the field.
Needless to say, if the Cardinal hopes to be sue

cessful tonight, a repeat of that poor first-half
shooting performance cannot occur.
"Last night, we got a little down [on our
selves] and stopped shooting the ball, but that
just can't happen [tonight]," said sophomore
swingman Josh Childress. "We have to come
out ready to play, because if you let a top team
like Xavier get out on you early, it's hard to get
