# Mac rambles:
## Yao, NASCAR and Big Game 
### 
I was trying to decide what to write my column
about this week, and 1 was just inundated with
ideas — way too many random thoughts about
the sports world cluttering my mind. So, I de
cided to jot as many down as possible in my first in
stallment of Mac's Ramblings (apologies to ESPN's
Sportsguy for biting his style):
Stanford basketball is going to surprise some peo
ple this year. I'm not saying Final Four, but a ninth
straight trip to the Big Dance may be in the cards.
The team is well-coached, pretty athletic, and the

guys can shoot the lights out. But
when you live by the three, you also
die by the three.
Why is it that fat athletes are al
ways considered so jolly and likable
(The Fridge, El Guapo and Sir
Charles, to name a few), and how
did Shawn Kemp miss the boat on
that one? I guess some people are
still annoyed about the numerous

drug arrests and that he has seven kids with six dif
ferent women. But doesn't he deserve a (twenty )-sec
ond chance?
There may not be a stranger sight in all of sports
than the Houston Rockets' Yao Ming. He's 7-foot-6
and Chinese — that's not a typo — he dunks with
out jumping and his facial expressions when he tries
to get pumped up are priceless. I can't even describe
them. For the first time in my life, I'm speechless. He
has to star in his own movie. I'm thinking a buddy
cop flick with Jackie Chan.
Donovan McNabb playing last Sunday's game
after breaking his ankle on the third play of the game
is an absolutely amazing accomplishment. Oh yeah,
the Fugles QB wasn't half-bad either, throwing for
255 yards and four touchdowns while leading his
team to victory. lTie bad news for Donovan is that he's
now out for the season — sucks for the Eagles, good
for my Giants.
If high school basketball star Leßron James doesn't
have the biggest ego in the world, he should. He's boys
with M.J. and Jay-Z, as well as every other NBA star
and platinum rapper. He will be the undisputed No.
1 pick in the NBA Draft come June, he's already been
on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and his high school
games are shown on pay-per-view in Ohio. Sounds
like the life of your average 17-year-old, right?
Sammy Sosa is definitely on steroids, Barry Bonds
might be on steroids, and Shawn Bradley should get
on steroids as quickly as possible.
All those people that said the amazing World Cup
performance by the United States would jump-start
soccer in America were dead wrong. The U.S. beat El
Salvador 2-0 this past weekend in a friendly, and no
one here gives a crap. The MLS didn't get any atten
tion this summer post-Cup, and it looks like soccer is
still a once-in four-years deal for us dumb Americans.
Speaking of dumb Americans, what's the deal with
NASCAR, and why is it so damn popular? More peo
ple watch NASCAR races than any other sporting
event in America. Is that crazy, or is it just me, since it
is basically hours of people driving around in circles?
But I do admit that Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart and
the rest of NASCAR's stars probably pimp every hot
trailer-park chick across the country (the ones that
look like Brittany Murphy's character in "8 Mile").
