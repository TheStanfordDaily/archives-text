Wrestling

vs. San Francisco St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m

Twelve years ago, Scott Polley,
a native of this small town of
7,000 located 10 miles west of the
Missouri border, began
wrestling.
Today, the Renaissance Festi
val remains an annual event in
Bonner Springs. And Polley, a
redshirt sophomore on the Stan
ford wrestling team (1-1) that will

take on San Francisco State at
7:00 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion
tonight, is working toward what
he hopes will be the ultimate
homecoming. The NCAA Cham
pionships will be held just a short
trip up 1-70 in St. Louis March 20
to March 22.
"I always knew I wanted to
wrestle in college. I just wasn't
sure about my ability, whether or
not it was going to become a real
ity," Polley said.
By the end of Polley's sopho
more year of high school, howev
er, any questions about his ability
were answered in the form of re
cruiting letters, many from
schools in the Midwest, the
Mecca of collegiate wrestling.
Polley compiled 137 victories
and was a three-time freestyle state
champion in high school, placing
second twice and fourth once in the
Kansas State Tournament.
