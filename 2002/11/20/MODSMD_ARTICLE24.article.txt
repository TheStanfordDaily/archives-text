Over 20 years ago, the Kansas
City Renaissance Festival was
held in Bonner Springs, Kan., for
the first time.

Wrestling

vs. San Francisco St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m

Twelve years ago, Scott Polley,
a native of this small town of
7,000 located 10 miles west of the
Missouri border, began
wrestling.
Today, the Renaissance Festi
val remains an annual event in
Bonner Springs. And Polley, a
redshirt sophomore on the Stan
ford wrestling team (1-1) that will

take on San Francisco State at
7:00 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion
tonight, is working toward what
he hopes will be the ultimate
homecoming. The NCAA Cham
pionships will be held just a short
trip up 1-70 in St. Louis March 20
to March 22.
"I always knew I wanted to
wrestle in college. I just wasn't
sure about my ability, whether or
not it was going to become a real
ity," Polley said.
By the end of Polley's sopho
more year of high school, howev
er, any questions about his ability
were answered in the form of re
cruiting letters, many from
schools in the Midwest, the
Mecca of collegiate wrestling.
Polley compiled 137 victories
and was a three-time freestyle state
champion in high school, placing
second twice and fourth once in the
Kansas State Tournament.

Redshirt sophomore Scott Polley battles a Navy opponent on Nov. 8. Polley was victorious in both
of his first two matches, including a win over the No. 1 -ranked 149-pounder in the NAIA.
He was also voted Most Out
standing Wrestler at the 2000
Southeast Regional Freestyle
Championships in New Orleans.
"I knew I wanted to use
wrestling as a tool to get into a
more selective school," Policy said.
Enter Stanford.
"I got a letter from Stanford
and can remember almost not
sending it back out of pure lazi
ness," Polley said. "I had already
received several others, and all
the others came with a self-ad
dressed stamped envelope."
Stanford's didn't but, lucky for
the Cardinal, Polley took the time
to find a stamp.
"Stanford was my first trip,
and 1 called my parents from San
Jose Airport, saying 'This is
where I want to go to school,' " he
said. "I can remember them say
ing, 'We're glad you had a good
time, but I'm sure you're going to
say that after all of your trips.' "
But he didn't say that after all
of his trips, and, during his fresh
man year on the Farm, Polley
showed no signs of the laziness
that almost kept him from com
ing to Stanford. He defeated the
varsity 157-pounder in an in
trasquad match and in an open
tournament, but still decided to
redshirt, partly in consideration
of his knee, which was operated
on between his junior and senior
years of high school.
"As intense and enduring as
the college season is, I thought I
should focus on letting that heal
up a little more," Polley said.
With his knee healed and a
year of practice and experience
in open tournaments under his
belt, Polley entered last season
expecting to earn the varsity spot
at 157.
Much to his surprise, howev
er, then-senior Levi Weikel-Mag
den had bumped up over the
summer from 149 to 157, tem

porarily dashing his high hopes
of becoming an immediate con
tributor for the Cardinal.
"Having that happen was
kind of a reality check," Polley
said. "As much as I would've
liked to have been varsity, in
hindsight it was a really valuable
experience."
After compiling a 10-7 record
last year, mainly in open tourna
ment competition, Polley made a
weight change of his own over the
summer and worked hard to earn
the starting spot this year at 149.
In Stanford's first meet of the
year, a triangular against Menlo
College and Navy, Polley came
away with two victories, includ
ing one over the No. 1-ranked
149-pounder in the NAIA, Saul
Lucatero.
"I wouldn't say it was a confi
dence booster because it was
definitely something I knew I
was capable of doing and ex
pected of myself," Polley said.
"At the same time, I think it was
incredibly important to start on
an upswing."
Polley, like the rest of this
year's Stanford team, has lofty
goals for the future but remains
focused on the present.
"My ultimate goal is to be an
All-American," Polley said.
"Other than that, I definitely
have goals but I set them on a
shorter-term basis."
Achieving the former would be
especially sweet for Polley given
the proximity of the NCAA
Championships to his home in
Kansas.
Hut one thing working against
his chances is the fact that the de
fending Pac-10 champions at 141,
149 and 157 are all at 149 this year.
"I know that there's a lot of
work that needs to be done for
me to get to the point where I am
able to achieve that end goal,"
Polley said.
As for the shorter-term goals,
some of those can begin to be re
alized tonight in the Cardinal's
last home meet until a Jan. 9 date
with Pennsylvania.
