# Swimming to battle Cal this afternoon at Berkeley
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ah, the revelries of Big Game week —
football games, pep rallies, bonfires, Gai
eties and ... swim meets?
Yes, that's right. Fifteen years ago,
the Cardinal men's swimming team
conjured up a little Big Game fun of its
own, and since its inception, the Stan
ford-California Double Distance Meet
has been a standard event the week pre
ceding Big Game.

at California, Today, 2:00 p.m

Despite the "tradition" behind the
meet, the format was not so traditional
at all. As the name suggests, the athletes
competed in all of the normal dual
meet events, only they swam double the
distance. Stanford hosted the meet
each year a few days prior to the actual
Big Game.
"We first started holding the meet to
take advantage of all of the hoopla sur
rounding Big Game," head coach Skip
Kenney said. "We really just wanted the
two teams to have fun competing in such
an unusual meet format."
Kenney added that the Double Dis
tance Meet was always exciting because
the swimmers had the opportunity to
swim events — such as the 400-yard but
terfly and the 2,000-yard freestyle—that
they would not normally swim in compe
tition. This year, however, Cal decided to
start a new tradition of its own.
"We had the meet on our schedule
for the Thursday before Big Game, but
then the athletic director at Cal called
us up and told lis that their swim team

couldn't make the meet," assistant
coach l ed Knapp said. "They never
gave us a reason why, but we told them
that we still wanted to swim against
them, so they changed the day and the
format."
The Cardinal will head to Cal this af
ternoon to carry on the ritual Big Game
rivalry. However, instead of the double
distance format, Cal has decided to
switch things up, dividing the meet into
six different categories: sprint free, dis
tance free, backstroke, breaststroke,
butterfly and individual medley. Each
swimmer will select a category and then
compete in three events within that cat
egory. For example, those athletes par
ticipating in the sprint free portion of
the competition will each swim the 50-,
100- and 200-yard freestyle events.
According to Knapp, the top finisher
in each event will receive one point, the
second two points and the third three
points. At the completion of all three
events within the category, the person
with the lowest score will win that portion
of the competition.
"I think that there is really going to be
some exciting competition at the meet,"
Knapp said. "This is our only chance to
race a top-caliber team before the start of
the regular season in January.
"Cal has one of its most versatile teams
this year, and it would be great to go in
t here and dominate a couple of the cate
gories against such a talented team. The
athletes are really excited because they
get to swim real race distances and each
of them will also have the opportunity to
compete in multiple events."
Senior Thomas Zochowski, who will
compete in the sprint free category, be
lieves that this new format will allow the

Cardinal to test its strengths against Cal.
"This is really going to give us a
chance to flex our muscles," Zochowski
said. "Cal has some great talent in the
50 and 100 free, but our guys are solid
in all three of the sprint events. At the
Double Distance Meet, we always
ended up swimming events that don't
actually exist in regulation competition.
This format, though, will give everyone
a chance to swim some really good,
competitive events."

Last year, Cal finished second behind
Stanford at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships. Cal returns several top
swimmers this season, including Alex
Lim, Duje Draganja and Olympic gold
medal winner Anthony Ervin.
"It will be very beneficial for us to see
how their team is doing at this point in
the season," Knapp said. "This meet
will give us an opportunity to check out
Cal's freshman class and to judge the
talent level."

"We had the meet on our schedule
for the Thursday before Big Game, but
then the athletic director at Cal called
us up and told lis that their swim team

couldn't make the meet," assistant
coach l ed Knapp said. "They never
gave us a reason why, but we told them
that we still wanted to swim against
them, so they changed the day and the
format."
The Cardinal will head to Cal this af
ternoon to carry on the ritual Big Game
rivalry. However, instead of the double
distance format, Cal has decided to
switch things up, dividing the meet into
six different categories: sprint free, dis
tance free, backstroke, breaststroke,
butterfly and individual medley. Each
swimmer will select a category and then
compete in three events within that cat
egory. For example, those athletes par
ticipating in the sprint free portion of
the competition will each swim the 50-,
100- and 200-yard freestyle events.
According to Knapp, the top finisher
in each event will receive one point, the
second two points and the third three
points. At the completion of all three
events within the category, the person
with the lowest score will win that portion
of the competition.
"I think that there is really going to be
some exciting competition at the meet,"
Knapp said. "This is our only chance to
race a top-caliber team before the start of
the regular season in January.
"Cal has one of its most versatile teams
this year, and it would be great to go in
t here and dominate a couple of the cate
gories against such a talented team. The
athletes are really excited because they
get to swim real race distances and each
of them will also have the opportunity to
compete in multiple events."
Senior Thomas Zochowski, who will
compete in the sprint free category, be
lieves that this new format will allow the

Cardinal to test its strengths against Cal.
"This is really going to give us a
chance to flex our muscles," Zochowski
said. "Cal has some great talent in the
50 and 100 free, but our guys are solid
in all three of the sprint events. At the
Double Distance Meet, we always
ended up swimming events that don't
actually exist in regulation competition.
This format, though, will give everyone
a chance to swim some really good,
competitive events."

Last year, Cal finished second behind
Stanford at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships. Cal returns several top
swimmers this season, including Alex
Lim, Duje Draganja and Olympic gold
medal winner Anthony Ervin.
"It will be very beneficial for us to see
how their team is doing at this point in
the season," Knapp said. "This meet
will give us an opportunity to check out
Cal's freshman class and to judge the
talent level."
