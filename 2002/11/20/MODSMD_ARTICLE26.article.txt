Tht* Stanford men's and women's club polo
teams kicked off their seasons with wins over
UC-San Diego at the Horse Park Polo Club in
Woodside over the weekend.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

The Cardinal women's team — composed of
senior Diana Hernandez, junior Laura Watkins
and sophomores Heather Lake and Carly
Schuster — cruised to an easy 10-1 win over the
Triton squad on Saturday. Lake and Schuster
each picked up lour goals in the victory.
Sophomore David Velez, sophomore Cary
Kempston and senior Marcello Halleck guided
the men's team to a 10-8 come-from-behind
win on Sunday. Down 6-3 at the half, the Stan
ford men rallied in the third chukker to take
control of the match. Velez finished as the
game's high scorer with seven goals.
College polo is played three-on-three in a
300-foot long, 100-foot wide arena, as opposed
to traditional polo which is played four-on-four
on a field that's over three times as large. Stan
ford is one of nine collegiate polo teams on the
West Coast and one of 27 in the country. The
club is open to anyone affiliated with Stanford,
although only undergraduates are eligible to
play in intercollegiate matches.
The Cardinal men return to action this
weekend at UC-Davis. Both teams officially
begin their intercollegiate seasons next quarter
with matches against the Aggies at home.
Stanford triathlon club performs well at
Salmon Duathlon
The Stanford triathlon club — riding high

after sealing sponsorship deals with Mike's
Bikes of Palo Alto and Cannondale — capped
off a busy few weeks with a solid showing at the
Salmon Duathlon in Knights Ferry, Calif., on
Nov. 2. The Cardinal was represented by 17
athletes in the race, which featured a 30-kilo
meter bike and a 2.5-kilometer run.
Graduate student Eric Bean and senior Dan
Parris took first and second in the race, respec
tively, each shattering the previous course
record. Two other Stanford athletes also land
ed medals in the event: Graduate student
Amanda Brandy finished third in her age
group — sixth among women overall — and
freshman Brian Bergmark took third in the
men's under-19 division.
A week earlier, the Cardinal also turned in
a strong showing at the Cal Bearathlon in
Berkeley, which featured a 500-yard swim, a

13-mile bike with a nasty hill on it and a 3.75-
mile run.
Harris took second in that race as well, fin
ishing the brutal course in 1 hour, 13 minutes,
45 seconds. Close behind was senior teammate
Michael O'Neil, who took third with a time of
1:15:05.
Stanford sophomore Katherine Luna took
10th on the women's side with a 1:37:45, with
freshman Sofia Leon rounding out the Stan
ford finishers at 1:50:37.
Women's rugby punishes Hornets
After a two-week hiatus, the Stanford
women's rugby team returned to the field fora
scrimmage against Sacramento State on Satur
day. The Cardinal dominated most of the scrim
mage, which consisted of three 30-minute peri
ods, eventually forcing the Hornets' squad to
cut things short with injuries mounting to their
forwards because of Stanford's strength in the
scrums.
Fly half Kelsey Lynn scored three tries in the
first period to put Stanford ahead early. Sacra
mento State attempted a comeback with three
tries of its own at the beginning of the second
period, but the Cardinal regained its momen
tum with four more tries over the course of the
rest of the game, including freshman Olivia
Anglade's first try of her collegiate career early
in the third period.
Stanford's fall quarter playing schedule will
be topped off with the annual Alumni Game on
Sunday at 11:00 a.m. at Roble Field.
