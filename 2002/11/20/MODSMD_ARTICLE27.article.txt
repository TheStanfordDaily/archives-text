# Card sailing finishes fall season on positive note
## Sailing places third overall behind Southern California and Hawaii at regatta 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the final event of the (Cardinal sailing
team's fall season, the North / South Re
gatta near Santa Barbara last weekend
gave Stanford one more opportunity to
demonstrate its skill and athleticism on the
water and to establish itself as a veritable
force for the upcoming spring season.
The Cardinal certainly achieved these
goals, placing third out of 18 competitors,
behind the two teams that have consistent
ly dominated the pack throughout the sea
son, Southern Calfornia and Hawaii.
The level of consistency in and across
the four divisions, A through I), that com
prised the regatta determined overall
point totals for the top three teams. Cham
pion USC impressively swept the A-Divi
sion, collecting only 17 points, while
Hawaii and Stanford registered 44 and 36,
respectively.
Though the Cardinal tied Southern
California in the B-Division with 27 points,
its inconsistent performance in other divi
sions, as well as its inability to compete with
Trojan freshman Mikee Mitterling in the
doublehanded A-division competition, re
sulted in a large gap in the overall scores.
While Stanford senior skipper Ted Con
rads and sophomore crew Lucy Horton

held their own against Mitterling, it was
only good enough to place second in the
A-l)ivision. Stanford Coach Jay Kehoewas
satisfied with the team's effort.
"Ted and Lucy got the job done by fin
ishing second," Kehoe said. "Mitterling
was on his game and tough to catch in the
light and shifty breeze."
Weather, as usual, affected the schedul
ing this weekend, allowing fora mere two
races on Saturday and necessitating that
the remaining six occur Sunday.
Sunday saw fierce competition for sec
ond place in the B-Division, as Stanford's
duo of junior skipper Dave Phillips and
junior crew Sonja Bebber faced off
against Trojan sailors David Levy and
Kyrstin Munson. In true down-to-the
wire style, the two teams were tied until
the final race of the day, when the Cardi
nal failed to pull out the win.
UC-Irvine, who finished the regatta
fourth overall, won the division, as star
skipper Jordan Kross dominated his op
ponents by more than 10 points.
The C- and D-Divisions entailed t he rac
ing of singlehanded Laser sailboats. Stan
ford freshman Brian Haines, fresh from
bis solid performance at the ISCA Single
handed Nationals in Houston last week,
didn't perform as well as he may have
hoped, taking fourth in the C-Division.
"Haines had a tough time in the light
air at Lake Cachuma," Kehoe said. "Two
races out of the top five are the difference
between second and fourth."
Haines faced strong competition from
Hawaii's Matt Stine, who earned an amaz

ing six first-place finishes over eight races
to pull away from the field.
Dave Kenny represented Stanford in
the D-Division, placing second, just one
point behind USC's Katie Clausen. Just
as Stine dominated the C-Division,
Hawaii's Willy Edwards won the 1)-Divi

sion by finishing in the top two in six of
eight races, beating the Cardinal by 10
points.
And so ends the Stanford sailing team's
fall season. Winter will see only a few
events, and the team will not be back on
the water consistently until the spring sea

son, which begins in March. With the
North / South Regatta behind it, the Car
dinal will focus on placing in the top two in
the Women's, Coed and Team Race Pacif
ic Coast Championships in April in order
to qualify for the National Championships
in June.
