## School comes home with distance learning 
### ABHI VASE 
At the pinnacle of the distance
learning boom several years ago,
software CEO Michael Savior had
an ambitious plan: to use $ 100 mil
lion of his own money to create a
free online university with lectures
from the world's geniuses and lead
ers. While it might have seemed
like a good idea at the time, Saylor's
vision fora free virtual education
never materialized.
Today, MIT is on the cusp of re
alizing Saylor's vision. While other
universities and individuals strive to
turn online education into gold,
MIT, embracing a spirit reminiscent
of the Free Software Foundation,
has chosen the opposite path â€” to
post virtually all its course materials
on the Web, free for everyone.
Known as OpenCourseWare
(OCW), the initiative took root in
the spring of 2001, with $11 mil
lion in startup grants from the An
drew W. Mellon Foundation and
the William and Flora Flewlett
Foundation.
OCW is not about online degree
programs or even about online
courses for which students can
audit or enroll. In fact, it does not
even allow users to interact with
teachers. The idea behind OCW is
to make the course materials of al
most all of MlT's undergraduate
and graduate subjects available on
line and free of charge to users any
where in the world, according to
Jon Paul Potts, spokesman for the
OCW project.
"Our goal is open knowledge,"
Potts said. "We're really trying to

buck the trend of commercializa
tion of knowledge and start the
trend of sharing knowledge
around the world."
OpenCourseWare allows mate
rials to be used, copied, distributed,
translated and modified only for
non-commercial educational pur
poses. The program's vision is that
educators could use the online
course content for curriculum de
velopment and that individuals
could access the site for self-direct
ed study.
MIT OpenCourseWare de
buted Sept. 30 with no formal an
nouncement. But word spread
quickly, and by Oct. 7 at 7 p.m.,
there had been 13,381,691 hits on
the MIT site, with an average of
1.91 million hits per day and 12 av
erage page views per visitor - .
The Web site's initial offering in
cluded material from 32 classes in
17 departments. The next round of
courses will be released at the turn
of next year.
The OCW resource will eventu
ally host the materials for more
than 2,000 classes taught at MIT.
The goal is to provide a coherent
interface that will include sophisti
cated search algorithms to explore
additional concepts, pedagogies
and related attributes across the
site, as well as within a course. This
ambitious plan will be implement
ed in three major phases, with the
final phase scheduled for comple
tion in 2007.
In spite of MFF's strong support
and desire to see OCW flourish, the
