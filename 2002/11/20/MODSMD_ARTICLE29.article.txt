# Fighting a biological battle
## Drug company declares war on bacteria 
### JONATHAN THAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Palo Alto biotech company co-founded by
a Stanford professor is developing a new class of
antibiotics designed to combat bacterial dis
eases that are becoming increasingly resistant
to existing drugs.
The company, Anacor Pharmaceuticals, will
develop new antibiotics based on the work of
Lucy Shapiro, a professor in developmental bi
ology at the School of Medicine, and Steve
Benkovic, a chemist at Penn State University.
Some of the antibiotics the company is de
veloping are designed to work against bacterial
diseases used in bio-warfare, such as anthrax,
brucella and tularemia.
Last month, Anacor signed a $21.6 million
joint contract with the Defense Advanced Re
search Agency (DARPA) and the United States
Army Medical Research and Materials Com
mand (USAMRMC) to develop drugs for use
against bio-warfare agents, such as anthrax.
Anacor has also received $7 million in ven
ture-capital funding to help develop antibiotics
for use against infections caused by streptococ
ci and staphylococci bacteria.
Streptococci bacteria cause many different
diseases, strep throat being the most common.
Staphylococci bacteria cause diseases ranging
from wound infections to pneumonia.
Since the introduction of penicillin in the
19405, bacteria such as strep and staph have be
come increasingly resistant to antibiotics, mak
ing the drugs less effective and posing signifi
cant risks to infected patients.
The growing resistance of bacteria to antibi
otics has become an especially significant prob
lem in hospitals.
According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, approximately two million pa
tients in the United States get an infection while
in the hospital. About 90,000 of those die as a
result. More than 70 percent of bacteria that
cause infections in hospitals are now r resistant to
at least one of the drugs most commonly used
to treat them.
Shapiro says that Anacor is fighting both of
these bat tles — one against diseases that could be
used in bio-warfare and the other against bacte
ria that are increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
"It's the same problem from different points
of view," she said.
And perhaps most worrying, bacteria used
in bio-warfare might be specially designed to
resist existing antibiotics.
"Somebody who is serious about hurting
people with a biological attack is likely to engi
neer resistance to our existing antibiotics,"
David Perry, Anacor's chief executive officer,
said. "So creating new antibiotics that will be ef
fective against these engineered organisms is
really important," he said.
I'he drug technology that Anacor is devel
oping has been several years in the making.
During her research, Shapiro discovered a
particular enzyme that bacteria require to re
produce. Though the enzyme exists in bacteria

such as strep and staph, it does not exist in so
called "higher-level organisms," such as people.
"Our job is to figure out how to kill the in
vading bacterial pathogens without harming
the host animal: people," Perry said.
Benkovic designed a new class of antibiotic
and built thousands of derivatives of these
chemicals to find those that would knock out
the enzyme — killing the bacteria, yet leaving
the human unharmed.
"He came up with a number that looked
promising, and we've now narrowed the num
ber down to three," Perry said.
When Shapiro and Benkovic realized they
were on to something that could be used as a
defense against bio-warfare, they went to see
DARPA, the U.S. government agency that was
also instrumental in creating the Internet.
DARPA offered to fund their research through
a grant awarded in 1997.
The Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and sub
sequent events involving anthrax-tainted let
ters made DARPA even more interested in
Shapiro and Benkovic's research.
"The fact that our drugs hit anthrax and that
they were an entirely few class of antibiotic
made DARPA extremely interested," Shapiro
said. DARPA encouraged Shapiro and
Benkovic to create a company that would speed
up development of the new antibiotics.
With a new contract from DARPA and ven
ture capital funding, Anacor — which current
ly only employs 11 people working out of an
800-square-foot office in Palo Alto — now has
the resources to push on with making its vision
a commercial reality.
Anacor is busy hiring and is expected to
grow to 20 employees over the next two
months, Shapiro said.
The company will also soon be moving into

a 15,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto.
Both Perry and Shapiro stress that they will
never be working with dangerous disease-caus
ing pathogens either in labs at Stanford or in
Anacor's own labs.
"We do not work with pathogens at Stanford
in our laboratory, and our company will not,"
Shapiro said "There will never be anthrax in
the building."
Instead of working with pathogens directly,
Shapiro works with model non-pathogens.
The actual testing of Anacor's drugs will be
done at outside facilities, such as the U.S. Army
Medial Research Institute of Infectious Dis
eases in Fort Detrick, Md., or at other labs
around the country or overseas.
Although Shapiro sits on Anacor's scientific
advisory board, she is not involved in the day
to-day running of the company, preferring in
stead to continue her research at Stanford.
The links between Stanford and Anacor are
set to remain strong, though. The patents for
Anacor's technology are owned jointly by Penn
State and Stanford, and in a return for an equi
ty stake in the company, Anacor has an exclu
sive license to the technology.
Even though Anacor's technology is based
on years of research, the sheer complexity of
drug development means that the company
faces an uphill struggle.
"I've been very involved in advising and
watching antibiotic discovery and it's extraordi
narily difficult, and most of the time it doesn't
work," Shapiro said. "The chances of this work
ing are not high, but unless we try for sure, it
won't work.
"What people need to realize is the solution
to dealing with antibiotic resistance is another
side of the same coin in what we have to do in
dealing with bio-warfare," Shapiro said.

Some of the antibiotics the company is de
veloping are designed to work against bacterial
diseases used in bio-warfare, such as anthrax,
brucella and tularemia.
Last month, Anacor signed a $21.6 million
joint contract with the Defense Advanced Re
search Agency (DARPA) and the United States
Army Medical Research and Materials Com
mand (USAMRMC) to develop drugs for use
against bio-warfare agents, such as anthrax.
Anacor has also received $7 million in ven
ture-capital funding to help develop antibiotics
for use against infections caused by streptococ
ci and staphylococci bacteria.
Streptococci bacteria cause many different
diseases, strep throat being the most common.
Staphylococci bacteria cause diseases ranging
from wound infections to pneumonia.
Since the introduction of penicillin in the
19405, bacteria such as strep and staph have be
come increasingly resistant to antibiotics, mak
ing the drugs less effective and posing signifi
cant risks to infected patients.
The growing resistance of bacteria to antibi
otics has become an especially significant prob
lem in hospitals.
According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, approximately two million pa
tients in the United States get an infection while
in the hospital. About 90,000 of those die as a
result. More than 70 percent of bacteria that
cause infections in hospitals are now r resistant to
at least one of the drugs most commonly used
to treat them.
Shapiro says that Anacor is fighting both of
these bat tles — one against diseases that could be
used in bio-warfare and the other against bacte
ria that are increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
"It's the same problem from different points
of view," she said.
And perhaps most worrying, bacteria used
in bio-warfare might be specially designed to
resist existing antibiotics.
"Somebody who is serious about hurting
people with a biological attack is likely to engi
neer resistance to our existing antibiotics,"
David Perry, Anacor's chief executive officer,
said. "So creating new antibiotics that will be ef
fective against these engineered organisms is
really important," he said.
I'he drug technology that Anacor is devel
oping has been several years in the making.
During her research, Shapiro discovered a
particular enzyme that bacteria require to re
produce. Though the enzyme exists in bacteria

such as strep and staph, it does not exist in so
called "higher-level organisms," such as people.
"Our job is to figure out how to kill the in
vading bacterial pathogens without harming
the host animal: people," Perry said.
Benkovic designed a new class of antibiotic
and built thousands of derivatives of these
chemicals to find those that would knock out
the enzyme — killing the bacteria, yet leaving
the human unharmed.
"He came up with a number that looked
promising, and we've now narrowed the num
ber down to three," Perry said.
When Shapiro and Benkovic realized they
were on to something that could be used as a
defense against bio-warfare, they went to see
DARPA, the U.S. government agency that was
also instrumental in creating the Internet.
DARPA offered to fund their research through
a grant awarded in 1997.
The Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and sub
sequent events involving anthrax-tainted let
ters made DARPA even more interested in
Shapiro and Benkovic's research.
"The fact that our drugs hit anthrax and that
they were an entirely few class of antibiotic
made DARPA extremely interested," Shapiro
said. DARPA encouraged Shapiro and
Benkovic to create a company that would speed
up development of the new antibiotics.
With a new contract from DARPA and ven
ture capital funding, Anacor — which current
ly only employs 11 people working out of an
800-square-foot office in Palo Alto — now has
the resources to push on with making its vision
a commercial reality.
Anacor is busy hiring and is expected to
grow to 20 employees over the next two
months, Shapiro said.
The company will also soon be moving into

a 15,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto.
Both Perry and Shapiro stress that they will
never be working with dangerous disease-caus
ing pathogens either in labs at Stanford or in
Anacor's own labs.
"We do not work with pathogens at Stanford
in our laboratory, and our company will not,"
Shapiro said "There will never be anthrax in
the building."
Instead of working with pathogens directly,
Shapiro works with model non-pathogens.
The actual testing of Anacor's drugs will be
done at outside facilities, such as the U.S. Army
Medial Research Institute of Infectious Dis
eases in Fort Detrick, Md., or at other labs
around the country or overseas.
Although Shapiro sits on Anacor's scientific
advisory board, she is not involved in the day
to-day running of the company, preferring in
stead to continue her research at Stanford.
The links between Stanford and Anacor are
set to remain strong, though. The patents for
Anacor's technology are owned jointly by Penn
State and Stanford, and in a return for an equi
ty stake in the company, Anacor has an exclu
sive license to the technology.
Even though Anacor's technology is based
on years of research, the sheer complexity of
drug development means that the company
faces an uphill struggle.
"I've been very involved in advising and
watching antibiotic discovery and it's extraordi
narily difficult, and most of the time it doesn't
work," Shapiro said. "The chances of this work
ing are not high, but unless we try for sure, it
won't work.
"What people need to realize is the solution
to dealing with antibiotic resistance is another
side of the same coin in what we have to do in
dealing with bio-warfare," Shapiro said.
