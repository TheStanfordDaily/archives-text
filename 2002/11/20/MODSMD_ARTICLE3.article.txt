### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an excursion that included visits with
alumni, speeches at conferences and a
meeting with the president of Taiwan,
University President John Hennessy
briefly toured Asia last month for the first
time during his presidency.
Steven Suda, the director of the Office
of Asian Relations, said that destinations
on Hennessy's trip included Tokyo, Taipei
and Hong Kong.
He explained that one of the reasons
for the trip was the large number of stu
dents from Asia who attend Stanford.
According to the Office of Asian Rela
tions, six out of the top seven foreign coun
tries that send students to Stanford are in
Asia. In all, over 50 percent of the Univer

sity's international students and 18 per
cent of the entire graduate student popu
lation hail from Asia.
Suda said that Hennessy met with
alumni, parents and leaders in govern
ment, higher education and business dur
ing his one-week trip.

"In particular, his trip to Asia helped
deepen the ties between the growing
Stanford family in the region and the
University," Suda said.
He also mentioned that there are a


GINA HSIEH/The Stanford Daily
number of University research in
terests throughout Asia.
"His trip was to help advance
and encourage those research and
teaching interests," Suda said.
"[These interests] go across the en
tire spectrum of research topics."
As for Hennessy's visit with the
Taiwanese president, Suda said
that it was the first time the two
had met.
"It was just to affirm their mutu
al interest in promoting collabora
tion between Taiwan and Stan
ford," Suda said. "Stanford has
many students from Taiwan."
According to Suda, Hennessy
gave speeches at two conferences
during his travels.
"[Hennessy] gave a keynote
speech at the Nikkei Global
Forum," Suda said. "In Hong
Kong, President Hennessy gave
the keynote speech at the [Gradu
ate School of Business] Alumni
Conference where four other Stan
ford faculty participated."

At the forum in Nikkei, Hen
nessy reflected on the importance
of research and innovation as a
means for economic growth.
"As we go forward, the chal
lenges to create new technologies
and new industries based on
those technologies will require a
long investment horizon, and
probably a great deal of risk,"
Hennessy said. "But I believe that
leadership in science and technol
ogy is a fundamental advantage
that will continue to be a source of
economic growth in those coun
tries that pursue that leadership
and make the investments in in
novation."
Hennessy's remarks during an
interview with The Japan Times
expanded on the underlying issues
he addressed at the Nikkei forum.
"Universities have an obligation
to see if their research can be a ser
vice to the public," Hennessy said.
"But 1 think equally importandy,
the way in which they interact with
industry can affect how ... re
search develops."
According to Suda, "It was very
significant trip in terms of raising
Stanford's profile."
