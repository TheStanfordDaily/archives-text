# Meteor showers light up sky
## Late night viewers observed comet particles traveling faster than speeding bullets 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
If you were up late two nights ago, you
might have witnessed one of the most spectac
ular meteor showers in history. During the
early morning hours, our planet crossed with
the debris of the Temple-Tuttle comet travel
ing around the sun. The Leonids meteor show
er was composed of specks of dust traveling
faster than a bullet. Upon hitting the Earth's at
mosphere, the dust vaporizes and looks like a
shooting star. This year's viewers were especial
ly lucky because they could see the remains of
debris from 1767 and 1866.
Last week, scientists from the University of
Newcastle successfully extracted protein
from fossil bone, a breakthrough that suggests
proteins can survive in fossilized form for mil
lions of years. The protein remained pre
served primarily to the presence of osteocalcin,
a structural protein that bonds directly to the
minerals of bone. By comparison, present am
plification techniques only permitted the study
of DNA that had been in permafrost for at most
100,000 years.
Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania
announced last week they were able to avert a
Parkinson's-like disease in fruit flies. The re
searchers treated flies that were genetically pre
disposed to the neurogenerative disorder with

an antibiotic. Instead of losing neurons as
would be expected, the flies maintained con
stant levels of neurons. The discovery offers
hope for humans with Parkinson's disease, the
second most common neurodegenerative dis
order. Current medication can only alleviate
the symptoms, which include tremors, postural
rigidity and progressive loss of neurons in cer
tain areas of the brain, but cannot slow or stop
the neuron degeneration

Most people have heard about the Nobel
Prize, but what is the Ig Nobel Prize? The Ig
Nobel is awarded to scientists who have con
ducted experiments that cannot or should not
be repeated. This year's recipient is Arnd Leike,
a German physicist who demonstrated that
beer froth obeys the mathematical laws of ex
ponential decay. Leike used three different
kinds of beer, poured them into equal cylin
ders, and then measured the height of the froth
periodically. He then performed statistical
analyses and used his experiment to teach his
students how to analyze experimental data.
According to the World Health Organiza
tion, 56 million people die each year, and 10
lifestyle risk factors account for 10 percent of
these deaths. In order of highest to lowest risk,
the risk factors are hunger, unsafe sex, high
blood pressure, tobacco, alcohol, bad water and
poor sanitation, high cholesterol, indoor air
pollution, iron deficiency and obesity. The
WHO also found that the presence of these risk
factors was related to the degree of economic
development of a particular country. Develop
ing nations typically have higher incidences of
hunger, bad water and poor sanitation while
developed nations have a greater prevalence of
high blood pressure and obesity. The WHO es
timates that eliminating these problems would
require less than 5 percent of the world GDP
and could increase life-spans between five and
16 years globally.
