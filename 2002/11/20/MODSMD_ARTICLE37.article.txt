# Two black holes on the verge of a collision

Eruption would not be viewed
on Earth for at least 100 million
years, according to astronomers
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a looming colli
sion of giants, two super'massive black holes are
drifting toward a violent merger and an erup
tion of energy that will warp the fabric of space.
It is all happening in a bright galaxy 400 million
light years away.
Images from the Chandra X-ray Observato
ry have captured for the first time the circling
dance of two black holes — each millions of
times the mass of the sun — as they whirl
around each other in a 100-million-year pirou
ette to merger.
"This is the first time we have ever identified
a binary black hole," said Stefanie Komossa, an
astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Ex
traterrestrial Physics and the co-author of a
study of the double black hole. "This is the af
termath of two galaxies that collided sometime
in the past."
Each of the galaxies was about the size of the
Milky Way, with billions of stars, and each con
tained at its center a supermassive black hole
with a mass equal to perhaps 100 million suns,
Komossa said Tuesday at a news conference
announcing the discovery. When they blended,
the galaxies formed a single, extraordinarily
bright galaxy known as NGC624O. Because of
its distance from the Earth, the image now seen
is 400 million years old.
Although NGC624O is far away, as
tronomers said the merger is a glimpse of what
may await the Earth's galaxy. Astronomers be
lieve that in about four billion years, the billions
of stars and the black holes of the Milky Way

and of the nearby Andromeda galaxy will col
lide and merge.
"We're seeing our own future," said Steinn
Sigurdsson, a Pennsylvania State University as
tronomer who participated in the news confer
ence as a visiting expert.
The astronomers said as the galaxies of
NGC624O merged, the two black holes began
circling each other, starting a 100-million-year
spiral toward a collision that was expected to
spew radiation and gravitational waves across
the universe.
That collision would not be viewed on Earth
for at least another 100 million years, the as
tronomers said.
Gunther Hasinger, a Max Planck astro
physicist and co-author of the study, said the
Chandra images indicate the black holes are
about 3,000 light years apart and circling
each other at a speed of about 22,000 mph. As
they grow closer and closer over millions of
years, the circling speed will get faster and
faster, eventually approaching the speed of
light, about 671 million miles an hour, said
Hasinger.
When the black holes do merge, much of
the angular momentum of their waltz will be
converted into gravitational waves that will
race across the universe, touching and affect
ing everything they pass, Hasinger said.
Joan Centrella, a NASA astrophysicists who
did not participate in the Chandra study, said
the merger would briefly warp the fabric of
space, just as a pebble thrown into a still pond
will cause bank-to-bank ripples. The effect of
the gravitational waves on other stars, galaxies
and planets will be like the way ripples in that
pond cause floating leaves to rise and fall slight
ly, said Centrella.
"The ripple across space will be such that a

planet could pulsate," Sigurdsson said. "A
whole planet could be squeezed by an inch or so
every few minutes," depending on how close it
is to the merged black holes. Satellites would
jiggle and navigation equipment could wobble
momentarily, he said.
The merge will also trigger an enormous
eruption of light and X-rays, spewing in all di
rections, along with jets of plasma matter racing
out of the ends of the donut-shaped cloud of
dust and gas swirling about the black holes.
Hasinger said the two black holes have enor
mous appetite — each minute sucking in mass
equal to about the mass of the sun.
A black hole is a point in space so dense with
matter that its gravitational field will not let any
thing — not even light — escape. Stellar black
holes, equal to a mass 3.5 to 15 times that of the
sun, can be formed by the collapse of a single
massive star. But galactic black holes, such as
those in NGC624O, are much larger, equal per
haps to many millions of solar masses, and are
usually at the center of galaxies. The Milky
Way, home galaxy of the sun and its planets,
has a black hole at its center.
With its immense gravitational pull, a black
hole can suck in gas, dust and other matter
from the surrounding space. Entire stars can be
stripped and pulled into the bottomless maw.
As it spirals in at near light speeds, matter cap
tured by a black hole heats by millions of de
grees and gives out intense radiation in several
parts of the spectrum, including X-rays. The
orbiting Chandra observatory can detect these
X-rays down to the very edge of the black hole
and relay the data to Earth for study by as
tronomers.
NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory was
launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Co
lumbia on July 23, 1999.
