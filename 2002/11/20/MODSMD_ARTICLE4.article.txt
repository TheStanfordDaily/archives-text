While the economic disparities be
tween Palo Alto and its neighbor to the
east are widely acknowledged by the
Stanford community, campus minister
Jim Burklo believes too few take the ini

Burklo was the founder and director of
the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, which

often took Stanford student volunteers
on informal tours of the area to explore

Palo Alto.

When he began working at Stanford,
he found himself giving more of these
informal tours, and finally decided to

involved in the program.
"Our hope is that Reality Check will
become an entirely student-led pro

"We really need more student volun
