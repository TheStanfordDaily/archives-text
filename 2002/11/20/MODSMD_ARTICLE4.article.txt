# Stanford's reality check in EPA
## 
### JESSICA WANG 
While the economic disparities be
tween Palo Alto and its neighbor to the
east are widely acknowledged by the
Stanford community, campus minister
Jim Burklo believes too few take the ini
tiative to explore East Palo Alto first
hand. So for the last eight years, Burklo
has been giving students the opportuni
ty to witness the stark realities of pover
ty and homelessness in East Palo Alto
through a weekly program called Reali
ty Check Tours.
The two-hour tours are designed to
educate students and expose them to
service opportunities in the area.

"Stanford is an island — a sell-con
tained world — and it takes a special efibrt
for students to go outside of it to get in
volved in community affairs," Burklo said.
" The tour became a good way to get
introduced to the community beyond
campus and to ways that students can
make a difference," he added.
Before becoming the progressive
Christian campus minister at Stanford,
Burklo was the founder and director of
the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, which
serves homeless people locally. He
often took Stanford student volunteers
on informal tours of the area to explore
the socioeconomic conditions of East
Palo Alto.

When he began working at Stanford,
he found himself giving more of these
informal tours, and finally decided to
offer them on a regular basis.
He started the weekly Reality Check
Tours program in 1995. At first, only
Burklo led the tours, but currently a
team of three student tour leaders is also
involved in the program.
"Our hope is that Reality Check will
become an entirely student-led pro
gram, with myself and others as advis
ers," Burklo said.
"We really need more student volun
teer tour leaders for that to happen. I
think the demand for the tour is
much greater than the number of
tours we can now offer, so I'm hop
ing this effort will grow so that lots
more students can have this expe
rience," he added.
The experience seems to be re
warding for the students who do
go on the tour. Students are con
sistently surprised by the contrasts
between East Palo Alto and the
Palo Alto they usually see.
Freshman Nicole Schuetz, who
went on the tour this year, com
mented, "I found the tour to be
very informative. I learned a lot
about the history of the area. The
difference between Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto was pretty amazing.
A lot of the economic hardships in
the area have to do with sales tax
acting as the main source of in
come for the city.
"It was also a good way to get in
troduced to service opportunities
in the community. I really enjoyed
the tour," she continued.
The tour begins on campus and
goes down Palm Drive, which
turns into University Avenue and
leads to East Palo Alto. Along the

way, tour guides give the history of
the area, explaining the develop
ment of the land and the various
economic levels that co-exist
alongside one another.
In East Palo Alto, students are
taken to the Urban Ministry, a cen
ter sponsored by local churches
and synagogues, where people can
donate food and clothes.
Another big stop on the tour is
the Ecumenical Hunger Program,
where people go if they run out of
money for food before the end of
the month. About a third to a half
of the East Palo Alto population
stops here each month for help.
Other stops on the tour include
Home Depot, the Boys 8c Girls
Club and the new South County
Community Health Clinic.
Each year, approximately 300 stu
dents and staff go on the tour. Be
tween seven and 20 students take
the tour each Friday from 3:15-
5:15 p.m.
Burklo emphasized that the
tours provided a springboard for
students to pursue community ser
vice opportunities in East Palo Alto.
Said Burklo, "The tours have
resulted in many students making
ongoing volunteer commitments
with the nonprofits that we visit or
pass by on the tour, and 1 feel es
pecially gratified by that."

Each year, approximately 300 stu
dents and staff go on the tour. Be
tween seven and 20 students take
the tour each Friday from 3:15-
5:15 p.m.
Burklo emphasized that the
tours provided a springboard for
students to pursue community ser
vice opportunities in East Palo Alto.
Said Burklo, "The tours have
resulted in many students making
ongoing volunteer commitments
with the nonprofits that we visit or
pass by on the tour, and 1 feel es
pecially gratified by that."
