### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
A new internship established in the
memory of Wall Street Journal foreign
correspondent Daniel Pearl '85 will help
to ensure that his legacy of facilitating in
tercultural understanding and highlight
ing individual dignity lives on in the work
of future journalists.
Announced last night, the Daniel Pearl
Memorial Journalism Internship will be
awarded annually to a Stanford student
whose work in journalism exemplifies the
ideals embodied in Pearl's work. Fi
nanced in part by Stanford's Daniel Pearl

Memorial fund, the internship will send
the winning student to work in an over
seas bureau of a major U.S. newspaper.
In the internship's first few years, that
paper will be The Wall Street Journal.
"We wanted to create an internship
that finds the next wave of Daniel Pearls
and gives them a chance to work overseas
early in their career," said Communica
tion Prof. James Bettinger, who chaired
the Pearl Memorial Fund committee.
Pearl, who majored in communication
at Stanford and wrote for The Daily, was
kidnapped and murdered by Pakistani
militants while working in Karachi in Jan
uary on a story about "shoe bomber"
Richard Reid.
"Our family is very pleased that Stan
ford has chosen to honor Danny with this
international journalism internship,"
said Michelle Pearl '91, Daniel Pearl's sis
ter and vice president of the Daniel Pearl

Foundation, in a press release. "Danny's
own internship experience played a piv
otal role in shaping his career path.
"Through this program, new genera
tions of sharp, inspired journalists will fol
low in Danny's footsteps and continue his
quest for truth and understanding," she
added.
Paul Steiger, managing editor of The
Wall Street Journal, commented on the
new program in the press release.
"We hope that this internship will in
spire young reporters to seek out the
kinds of stories that made Danny Pearl's
work so distinctive," he said.
The deadline for applications is Jan.
15, 2003. The internship is open to Stan
ford undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, with preference given to under
graduates. Details about the application
process will be available from the Com
munication Department.
