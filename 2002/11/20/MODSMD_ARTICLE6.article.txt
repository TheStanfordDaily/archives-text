# Conduct Board replaces Greek J-Board
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Greek Judicial Board, which for
merly heard cases on violations of Uni
versity policies involving fraternities and
sororities, is officially no more. In its
place, this year the Dean of Students' Of
fice created the Organizational Conduct
Board, or OCB, which will hear cases in
volving both Greek and non-Greek regis
tered student organizations and has al
ready met to review its first two cases.
l he purpose of this change was to cre
ate a single body that would review cases
for all student organizations.
"There have been discussions for two
years about creating the OCB in order to
afford the same opportunities to all stu
dent organizations as were afforded by
the Greek Judicial Board," said Morris

Graves, associate dean of students and
adviser to the OCB.
The OCB has the responsibility of in
vestigating violations of University poli
cies by student organizations, holding
hearings and making recommendations
to Dean of Students Marc Wais. While
Wais is not bound by the board's recom
mendations, he is generally expected to
accept its basic decisions.
"In the past, Dean Wais has increased
or decreased penalties 5 to 8 percent of
the time," Graves said.
A new panel is created for each case.
The panelists are drawn from five pools:
the African-American Fraternal and
Sororal Association, the Interfraternity
Council, the Intersorority Council, the
ASSU Nominations Commission and the
staff of the office of the vice provost of stu
dent affairs. A total of two Greek students,

three non-Greek students and two staff
members serve on each panel. All pan
elists are supposed to be unbiased.
" The IFC and ISC members are not
there to fight for the rights of the Greek
community, but to add to a more bal
anced perspective on the Conduct
Board," said Interfraternity Council
President senior Jordan Connors.
One of the first cases that the OCB re
viewed involved allegations against the
Kappa Sigma fraternity of allowing un
derage drinking at an all-campus party
on Sept. 27. The fraternity was placed on
alcohol probation on Oct. 23, and the
hearing occurred on Nov. 13.
The board's recommendation has not
yet been released.
"The hearing itself was fair, and
Kappa Sigma representatives
were given an opportunity to as
sert their arguments," said
Kappa Sigma President Kyle
Vataha, a junior.
However, Vataha expressed
some reservations about the
general workings of the OCB.
He explained that alcohol pro
bation is the immediate re
sponse of the dean of students
when an alleged alcohol incident
threatens the health and safety
of the community.
"The inherent problem with
this practice is that organizations
are punished because of 'alleged
incidents,' before they are found
to be guilty of any violations of
University policy," Vataha said.
"This precautionary measure
would be less severe given greater
efficiency of the OCB process. But

as it proceeds currently, there is a
considerable delay between the
temporary instatement of proba
tion and the OCB hearing."
However, both Vataha and
Connors see the OCB as a great
improvement over the Greek Ju
dicial Board.
"I believe that the Conduct
Board is a welcome change from
the Greek Judicial Board because
it focuses on conduct issues related
to all of campus rather than sin
gling out Greeks," Connors said.
Vataha stressed that, while not
perfect, the OCB is faster and
more even-handed than the
Greek Judicial Board.
"I believe the creation of the
OCB represents a positive move
ment in the handling of violations
of University regulations by stu
dent organizations, including
Greek groups," Vataha said.
"[But] I see it as a work in progress
that should be evaluated in order
to derive the most efficient and just
process possible."
