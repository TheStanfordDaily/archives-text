University President John Hennessy
will announce today that Stanford is in the
process of creating the Global Climate and
Energy Project, or G-CEP. The project is
designed to be "an unprecedented collab
oration between the scientific and engi
neering community and global corpora
tions to address the need for new tech
nologies that meet the energy and envi
ronmental demands of a growing world
population," according to a Stanford
News Service press release.

At 11 a.m. at the Schwab Residential
Center, Hennessy and G-CEP Project Di
rector Lynn Orr, dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, will expand on the goals
and future implementation of the project.
Using Stanford's many resources and
commitment to research, the project plans
to combine science and technology to find
ways of developing innovative energy al
ternatives. After finding the energy alter
natives, the project hopes to "determine
which are most likely to be accepted in the
marketplace, and accelerate the develop
ment of those technologies on a global
scale," the press release states.
