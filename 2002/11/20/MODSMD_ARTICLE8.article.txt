# ASSU looks at budget surplus

The ASSU Undergraduate Senate last
night began to deliberate about the best ap
proach to dealing with the special-fee bud
get surplus, ultimately tabling the discus-

sion to the Executive Committee.
The Senate rejected the idea of creating
an ad hoc committee to decide the fate of
the surplus, opting instead to work within
the executive branch to determine the level
of student input and the eventual use of the
funding.
Initially, the surplus was thought to be
approximately $350,000. However, the
amount will be closer to .$300,000 after the
Senate appropriates money to student
groups it has not yet compensated.
The Senate realized a few weeks ago that
the amount it has been holding in reserve to
distribute to special-fee recipients and to
compensate students who request special
fee refunds is around $500,000, where it
should only be $200,000. This money
comes from both undergraduate and grad
uate students, so both the Senate and the
Graduate Student Council must agree on a
course of action.
Senator Ellie Martin, a sophomore, sug
gested a Senate town hall meeting to ascer
tain student sentiments on how these funds
should be dispensed.
Opposing Martin's idea of soliciting
campus opinions, Appropriations Commit-
