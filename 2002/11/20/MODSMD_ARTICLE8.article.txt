# ASSU looks at budget surplus
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate last
night began to deliberate about the best ap
proach to dealing with the special-fee bud
get surplus, ultimately tabling the discus-

sion to the Executive Committee.
The Senate rejected the idea of creating
an ad hoc committee to decide the fate of
the surplus, opting instead to work within
the executive branch to determine the level
of student input and the eventual use of the
funding.
Initially, the surplus was thought to be
approximately $350,000. However, the
amount will be closer to .$300,000 after the
Senate appropriates money to student
groups it has not yet compensated.
The Senate realized a few weeks ago that
the amount it has been holding in reserve to
distribute to special-fee recipients and to
compensate students who request special
fee refunds is around $500,000, where it
should only be $200,000. This money
comes from both undergraduate and grad
uate students, so both the Senate and the
Graduate Student Council must agree on a
course of action.
Senator Ellie Martin, a sophomore, sug
gested a Senate town hall meeting to ascer
tain student sentiments on how these funds
should be dispensed.
Opposing Martin's idea of soliciting
campus opinions, Appropriations Commit-

dresses the issue of a recent budget surplus.
The surplus amount is close to $300,000.
tee Co-Chair junior Keenon De-
Vaughn said, "What's the best idea
the students can come up with?
Having all the knowledge and at
taining even more [information],
which is just as useful as feedback
from students, senators can make
this decision. We're students, too,
just like them."
Financial Manager Dave Endel
man, a senior, gave an example of
a similar situation that had oc
curred in the past.
"This money came from years
and years of students contributing
to the fee system," Endelman said.
"It is important to pay tribute to its
intergenerational source. Spend
the money to benefit those groups
and future groups.
"For example, when the com
munity service reserve was too
high because they were not spend
ing what they had budgeted, they
bought vans for the Haas Center
and will not let [groups] receive
fees for travel fare."
Student Life Chair sophomore
Joey Natoli said the "money was

intended just to pay groups," sug
gesting that it could be spent on
supplies most student groups re
quest like projectors, chairs, tables
and paper.
Nanci Howe, assistant dean and
director of student activities, ad
dressed the Senate's good fortune.
"I can't recall a time when the
ASSU has had such a large pot of
money," Howe said. "Invest it for
the long term, not on a program or
to compensate for 3 budget cut,
but use it as seed money. If you
whittle it away, you will lose your
influence as an organization. You
can get ideas from other students,
but invest it for future students."
Disapproving of the idea of
using the surplus to compensate
for budget cuts, Natoli said, "Ad
ministrators will see this as 'hey, we
just found $300,000.' That's how
politics works."
Howe posed a question the Sen
ate did not directly answer.
"Is this student money or stu
dent group money? What is the
goal or focus?" Howe asked.
ASSU president Monica Hene
stroza suggested continuing the
discussion in the Executive Com
mittee, which was the ultimate
consensus of the Senate.
