Countless authors have
chronicled the lives of peo
ple who survived the trials
of 20th-century China, but
few bring as much knowl
edge and style as Chin
(Children of China: Voices
from Recent Years) does.
The esteemed Yale histori
an successfully combines
an academic's interest in
the big picture and a novel
ist's attention to the finest
detail in limning the lives of
the title characters of this
excellent account. The his
tory of the Chang sisters is
heavy with episodes of
injury and inhumanity, yet
Chin has found affecting
anecdotes of how the sis
ters fought to "make
mirth" in the face of
anguish and loss brought
by imperial collapse, for
eign invasion, civil and
world war. revolution and
famine.
