Be a Sexton at Memorial Church! A what?
Sextons arc in charge of making church services (e.g., weddings, Sunday morning worship,
memorial services, concerts and other events) run smoothly. Responsibilities include
welcoming people, lighting candles, keeping evil tourists out, pointing people to the
bathroom, locking up afterwards, etc. You also get to eat congregational cookies and wear
a cool maroon robe. Oh, you get paid, too. More information: eje nay tan ford.edu.
