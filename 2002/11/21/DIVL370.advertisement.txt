Archaeology Research Opportunity
The Department of Anthropological Sciences is pleased to offer a special opportunity for
student archaeological research in 2003.
Greater Yellowstone Archaeological Internships
in Montana, June to August 2003.
Up to five six-week internships may be available for Stanford students (undergrad or grad) interested in working on a
team attempting to locate and investigate Paleo and prehistoric Native American sites west of Yellowstone Park in the
Madison Valley area of Montana. High sensitivity to Native American rights and culture is essential. Study of high plains
hunter and gatherer lifeways of the area can help inform an incomplete archaeological record of a valley under pres
sure from some development.
This is a reconnaissance survey. It is important that applicants are physically able to hike long distances.
Housing is provided. Internship awards should cover research costs, round trip travel to the area, food, and summer
earnings offset. Interested students should attend an informational meeting:
