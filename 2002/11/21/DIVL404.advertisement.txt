Can the 'Canes repeat? Can the Sooners make it two out of the last three? Who will win the Heisman?
How many polygons does a Butkus Award winner get? Where is Berkeley? The answers to these
(No. No. Look to Texas. Thousands. Take I-80 west and follow the signs.) and other pressing ques
tions can be found in this year's College Football Top 25 poll:

How good is this team? Eight or
nine of their starters should be
in NFL GameDay ,v, next year. The
'Canes may have the toughest
schedule in football, with games
against the Florida Gators,
Tennessee Volunteers, Virginia
Tech Hokies and Florida State
Seminoles. About the only qual
ity teams not on their schedule
are in the NFL.
3 OKLAHOMA
New Flot Routes can put the
2000 NCAA champs right back
at the top. Which means almost
as much to this Oklahoma
Sooner team as beating their
heated rival, the Nebraska
Cornhuskers. But, kicking game
may be a chink in the armor.
4 COLORADO
Will the Buffs defend their Big
12 crown using the wishbone?
The flexbone? The full house?
Only the coach controlling the
playbook knows for sure.
5 TENNESSEE
New high-low tackling may
allow the Volunteers to field
their toughest defense in years.
And defense wins champi
onships. The question is: will
their offense underachieve? A
0-0 game doesn't go down in
the win column.
6 TEXAS
Can their quarterback capture the
Heisman Trophy against what
may be the toughest conference
in Division I football? Can the
defense come up Texas big? Not

way to another SEC title.
Louisiana State University's
pass- and run-blocking is top
notch this year.
Lots of excitement building for
'Cocks this year. Volatile offense

of a full-house formation.

A weak schedule equals strong
wins. Will Keith Jackson, in
Gameßreaker's booth, call them
"rumbling" or "bumbling"?
23 TEXAS A&M
Several players converted to
defense. Too bad they're in the
country's toughest conference.
24 LOUISVILLE
Gamebreakers on both sides of
the ball. Look for the Louisville
Cardinals to go to their Wing T
offense for big points.

Same classic CGI uniforms. Same
