## U.S. seeking allies vs. Iraq 
### 
PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) — Presi
dent Bush, recalling Europe's grim history
of "excusing aggression," challenged skepti
cal NATO allies yesterday to stand firm
against Saddam Hussein as the alliance ex
pands in size and might to combat terrorism.
A senior administration official also said
yesterday that the Bush administration has
quietly contacted 50 countries, including
Canada, Britain and Germany, to solicit con
tributions of troops and war material in the
event Bush decides to use force.
Saddam has until Dec. 8 to give the Unit
ed Nations an accounting of his weapons of
mass destruction. Bush said Iraq had a
"short time" to come clean.
Should the Iraqi leader deny next month
that he possesses weapons of mass destruc
tion, "he will have entered his final stage
with a lie," Bush said on the eve of a two-day
NATO summit.
"And deception this time will not be toler
ated. Delay and defiance will invite the
severest of consequences," he declared.
Even as Bush spoke, President Jacques
Chirac of France renewed his position that
the United States cannot determine on its
own whether to wage war against Iraq.
The U.N. Security Council "is the only
body established to put in motion action of a

military nature, to take the responsibility, to
commit the international community,"
Chirac said.
Czech President Vaclav Havel said he
would prefer that Iraq disarm without force.
"If, however, the need to use force does
arise, I believe that NATO should give an
honest and speedy consideration to its en
gagement as an alliance," he said.
A day before the formal NATO vote,
Bush endorsed plans to usher seven former
communist nations into the fold — Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slova
kia and Slovenia. And he renewed his call for
greater expansion.
"We strongly support the enlargement of
NATO, now and in the future," the presi
dent said.
While he did not direcdy accuse Europe's
leaders of indifference toward Saddam, Bush's
sternly worded appeal for action against ter
rorists and like-minded regimes was clearly
aimed at the likes of Germany, which opposes
military action in Iraq, and France, which
forced the United States to water down a U.N.
resolution to disarm Saddam.
"The world needs the nations of this con
tinent to be active in the defense of freedom,
not inward looking or isolated by indiffer
ence," the president told students in Prague.
