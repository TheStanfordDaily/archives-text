BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Thou
sands of unemployed Argentines concluded a
peaceful three-day protest yesterday demand
ing jobs, food and social benefits from their
cash-starved govern ment.
Four years of painful economic recession, 22

middle-class nation. Now half of the country's
37 million people live below the poverty line.

"We have no other choice but to protest,"
said Margarita Galimani, 50, an unemployed
nurse. "I have worked all of my life for what, to
see my dreams vanish as the economy sours?"
Galimani joined about 400 protesters who
sat peacefully along the main bridge between
Buenos Aires and the capital's southern sub
urbs, blocking traffic for hours.
Since Monday, members of major groups rep
resenting the unemployed held similar rallies
and marches throughout Argentina's 21

provinces. The three-day protest culminated
with a rally on the capital's main plaza outside the
presidential palace. No violence was reported.
Protesters accused President Eduardo
Duhalde of doing too little to pull the country
out of its worst-ever economic crisis.
"I feel completely tossed aside by the
Duhalde government," said Graciela Jorge, an
unemployed mother of four.
Duhalde is a caretaker president who took
office in January.
