# Report: Moussaoui tied to Sept. 11 plot
##

WASHINGTON (AP) — An al-
Qaida prisoner's reported de
scription of Zacarias Moussaoui as
merely a backup figure could
weaken the government's argu
ment for executing the man ac
cused as a Sept. 11 conspirator,
legal experts said yesterday.
U.S. officials said Tuesday that a
top al-Qaida operative, Ramzi Bi
nalshibh, told interrogators that
Moussaoui met with the suspected
mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks
in late 2000 or early 2001 in
Afghanistan.
Binalshibh, a former aide to top
al-Qaida operative Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed, said Mohammed
provided Moussaoui with contacts
in the United States — but the two
men were not confident that
Moussaoui could keep a secret,
said officials speaking on the con
dition of anonymity.
Moussaoui, acting as his own
lawyer, and a defense team ap
pointed by the judge have asked
that Binalshibh be a defense wit
ness. The request is complicated
in Moussaoui's case because the
government may not want
enemy combatants like Binal
shibh to reveal sensitive informa
tion in courtrooms.
Legal experts said Binalshibh's
reported statements posed a
threat to the prosecution's stated
goal ofexecuting Moussaoui if he's
convicted. The experts were less
certain about the effect on the guilt
or innocence phase without more

details about possible Moussaoui
knowledge of the Sept. 1 i plot.
Moussaoui has admitted his loyal
ty to al-Qaida but has denied a role
in the hijackings.
David Bruck,"a Columbia, S.G.,
lawyer who heads a death penalty
project for federal public defend
ers, said the federal death penalty
law requires the government to
prove a defendant's intention to
kill — and that victims died as a re
sult of his actions.
Moussaoui, who was arrested at
a Minneapolis area flight school in
August 2001, was in custody on
Sept. 11.
"The statute was intended to
cover a person who hires a hit
man," Bruck said. "Being a stum
blebum on the fringes, who was
too unreliable to be trusted and
then abandoned by plotters, is not
committing an act that leads to
anybody's death," Bruck said.
Stephen Bright, director of the
Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta, said the
Supreme Court has made it clear
that major participation in taking a
life is necessary for imposition of
the death penalty.
Robert Precht, an assistant
dean at the University of Michi
gan's law school, and the lawyer
fora defendant in the first World
Trade Center bombing case, said
it's difficult to determine whether
Binalshibh's evidence could be ex
culpatory — tending to clear
Moussaoui of guilt.
