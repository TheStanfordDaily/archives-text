## The 						Stamford Daily Hennessy should play active role in labor debate 
### 
Published Since 1891

Recently, University President John
Hennessy endorsed the Human
Manifesto, a declaration that asserts
commitment to human rights. We
commend Hennessy for taking a visible stance
on the global stage and encourage him to exert
the same commitment at Stanford by taking an
active part in establishing fair labor standards
for campus workers.
Last week, the ASSU invited faculty, stu
dents, workers and University officials to par
ticipate in its Forum on Contemporary Issues,
in an effort to expand living-wage dialogue to
the larger Stanford community. The ex
change between stakeholders developed com
munication that might lead to progress. How
ever, one figure was missing from the table:
Hennessy himself.
In a recent guest column in The Daily, ad
ministration officials explained and supported

the University's level of involvement in cam
pus labor issues. For many members of the
Stanford community, this was the first time the
University's position had been laid out. We ap
preciate the administration's effort to open the
lines of communication — but again, an im
portant name failed to appear in the column's
byline: Hennessy's.
In fact, though University officials have re
cently shown more interest in communicating
with those who want to talk, Hennessy has re
mained on the sidelines. Though he expresses
commitment to the interests of campus work
ers, he has yet to meet in person with students
or workers to discuss the living wage policy. In
stead, the University has usually been repre
sented by Gordon Earle, vice president for
public affairs.
In a statement issued last week, the admin
istration expressed disappointment with the

ASSU for failing to respond to the proposed
living wage guidelines. Such disappointment
assumes that students should not participate
in the decision-making process, but should
rather offer feedback on predetermined deci
sions. When this assumption governs policy,
stakeholder voice has been taken for granted.
Though we do not expect the University to
cater to every whim of every stakeholder, stu
dents and workers do have a right to express
interests at the same table with policy deci
sion-makers.
We acknowledge Hennessy's commitment
to the University and realize he cannot attend
every campus meeting. However, we do expect
him to meet with stakeholders regarding such
important issues as Stanford's living-wage pol
icy. And as the leader of the University, we ex
pect him to be present at important discus
sions, such as the ASSU's forum last week.

I 'his editorial represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial hoard. I"he board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing editor for daily special sections, two opinions
editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

When communication ceases to exist, stu
dents resort to other means to draw attention
to their voices. When less communication oc
curs between students and administration, stu
dents are more likely to rationalize dissent as
necessary. Administrators may observe such
dissent and hesitate to meet with these stu
dents. This self-perpetuating cycle does not
help either party. Indeed, the resulting mis
communication has already led to visible ten
sion between students and administrators.
University officials have stated that the ad
ministration does not have the responsibility
or right to be involved in labor issues regard
ing non-University workers. But as the lead
er of the University, Hennessy himself does
have the right to speak his mind. If he en
dorses responsibility for global human
rights, he should act accordingly, starting at
the campus level.
