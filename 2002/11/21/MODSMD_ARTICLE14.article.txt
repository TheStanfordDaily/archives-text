## An ode to football 
### 
This Saturday the Stanford foot
ball team will travel to Berkeley to
play in the 105 th Big Game, one
of the oldest and greatest rivalries in col
lege football. From the first contest in
1892 (Stanford's equipment manager: fu
ture president Herbert Hoover), Big
Game has been, in the manner of Stan
ford itself, the source of traditions both
austere and irreverent.
Even though Stanford Stadium rarely
reaches capacity, and our student body
does not often exhibit the boisterous school
spirit of, say, Ohio State or Michigan stu
dents, Big Game promises each year to rep
resent the very best of college football.
And although football players and
coaches are discouraged by media relations
types 112 rom mouthing off about opponents,

preferring instead terse (if
uninformative) state
ments, certain games de
mand a measure of provo
cation and hype.
Last year Scott Fujita,
a senior linebacker from
Cal, published a vivid
essay in The Daily Cali
fornian envisioning a

Bear victory in Big Game. Although not
one of Fujita's premonitions came to
fruition, the images he described have
stuck with me.
Inhere is the vision of a Cal player (and I
am trying to describe this more delicately
than the author) forcibly inducing a bowel
movement from "somebody," presumably a
Stanford athlete. Or his exhortation to Cal
fans to "take down" the Tree. Or the count
less expletives. Evidently Fujita's column
was exempted from censorship of any kind.
(Now if only Cal would extend such free
dom of expression to the California Patriot,
its conservative publication, and the Berke
ley (College Republicans).
Unfortunately, I am not exempt from
basic standards of decency, so I must make
do without Fujita's inspired scatology.
Nonetheless, I hope that my column en
courages the Stanford community to sup
port its team in Berkeley this Saturday.
According to the motivational posters
you see in those in-flight magazines,
Arnold Palmer once called golf both "end
lessly complicated," and "deceptively sim
ple." J think the same can be said of foot
ball, a game of paradoxes.
An offensive play — the precise physi
cal choreography of 11 large, fast, angry
men — can be utterly byzantine. Consider
the prodigious quantity of formations and
the myriad permutations of personnel
groupings. Consider, too, the minute sub
conscious adaptations each player makes
as a play unfolds.
Yet, viewed from afar, one might be
surprised by the game's simplicity, in
essence. It is a contest for territory, fought
on one front. And despite voluminous
playbooks, monomaniacal coaches, aerial
photography, painstaking film analysis
and athletes who train themselves to ex

haustion year-round, each play ceases
when the ballcarrier ... falls over.
The propensity to construe football as
war's symbolic equivalent is oIF-base (and
fortunately, since Sept. 11, is rare), but
football can have symbolic value. In a cul
ture of ambiguity and relativism, football
promises symmetry and clarity. The
"gridiron" derives its name from the
strict geometry of the football field; all
lines of demarcation are discrete. Eleven
men versus 11 men.
In his biography of ex-Packers coach
Vince Lombardi, "When Pride Still Mat
tered," David Maraniss writes, " The con
tradictory ideals of unity and indepen
dence, conformity and rebellion, run
deep in the American psyche, and along
that divide football is the sport most
closely aligned with unity and conformi
ty, for better and worse." George F. Will
describes the social utility of football:
"[The] freely chosen subordination to a
collective enterprise."
Even in a society as free as the U.S.,
where we have garnered the reputation of
being indolent and apathetic, hundreds of
thousands of young men volunteer to play
an intensely difficult, violent and danger
ous game. The specter of "gassers" in the
oppressive preseason heat, or the hazard
of torn ACLs, compound fractures and re
current "stingers," can hardly dissuade
men from playing this game.
Of course, the last century has
changed football dramatically. A strange
incarnation of rugby played at elite East
ern colleges in front of a smattering of on
lookers has evolved into a highly com
mercialized enterprise, both profession
ally and on the collegiate level. The ulti
mate NFL game, the Super Bowl, in
creasingly approximates a mere vehicle
for corporate advertisements.
Though the NCAA still purports to
preserve the amateur spirit of college foot
ball, scandals involving payouts have tar
nished many college football programs
over the years.
But through it all, Stanford football re
mains a bastion of the amateur ideal. It is
for this reason that I implore you to cheer
on the Cardinal — your classmates, your
students, your friends — at the 105 th Big
Game.The Stanford community is full of
highly accomplished men and women,
not the least of whom are the genuine Re
naissance men — men of the highest com
petitive instincts and intellectual dedica
tion — who will suit up against Cal this
weekend. Of course, I am severely biased.
I have met my best friends on the Stanford
football team.
And now that I have the chance, I
would like to commit some space here at
the end of my column to a more selfish
end. I want to thank Stanford football.
You guys are rad.

Craig Albrecht would give his right Achilles ten
don to play in Hig Game this weekend. E-mail
your condolences to craiger@stanford.edu.
