Call for BCSC not just a BSU thing
In response to the recent discussion
on the campaign for expanding the Black
Community Services Center, I would like
to provide an additional point of view.
First, it is important to realize that the
BCSC campaign is not based on the mere
statistic that 1.4 square feet of meeting
space exists per black undergraduate stu
dent. This fact presented alone is obvi
ously insufficient to demonstrate the
need for additional space. And the statis
tic itself is not nearly as important as the
hundreds of voices that are bringing the
issue into light. With the exception of the
LGBT-CRC, the BCSC is the only com
munity center that has a major campaign
for additional space. Space is a very high
priority for the BCSC, illustrated not
only by the statistics that are being pre
sented, but also by the support that the
BCSC has received.
Second, the call for space for the BCSC
is not just from the BSU or the minority
centers. It is indeed a call from every corner
of campus. The community centers do not
serve only the students of those communi
ties, but all members of the Stanford com
munity. Not only do many non-ethnic or
ganizations house their events and meet
ings at community centers, but the entire
campus benefits from the programming
and presence of the community centers.
The BCSC, like every other community
center, is not just a center for black stu
dents, but serves all students. In fact, with
additional space, the BCSC could perform
its charge of outreach more efficiently.
I would surmise that although the BSU
is taking the lead on the campaign, they
have the full support of all students on
campus.

Black student proposal uses language
University can understand'
The numbers and statistics that are
being used by students in our campaign
to get a larger BCSC are by no means use
less (Letter to the Editor," 'No simple an
swer' for student meeting space issues,"
Nov. 19). Stanford never hesitates to
boast about its high number of admitted
black students and its ranking in regards
to black students on campus. So when
students use statistics in our proposal, we
are simply stating facts in the language
the University uses and can understand.
But comparing our needs to other
community centers in a way that will cre
ate divisions in the student community on
campus is not to the benefit of anyone and
will not work.
Black students and students of color
have always been willing to fight for the
things they feel are important, even when
the University is not anxious to meet those
needs. These victories by students are
some of the same institutions that Stanford
now boasts when recruiting new students
to the University, including community
centers and diversity in classrooms. Al
though the support of every student on
campus is ideal, to suggest that students of
color need the stamp of approval from
white students for our needs and cam
paigns to be legitimate is an insult to every
alum of color whose legacy we follow.

Sullivan had 'right and responsibility' to
withdraw Stewarfs mentorship position
I would like to express my satisfaction
that Lynne Stewart was prevented from

being honored at Stanford. Dean Sullivan
had every right and indeed responsibility
to prevent Stewart from receiving the
David W. Mills Public Interest Mentorship.
As the Nov. 19 Wall Street Journal edi
torial stated, there is a difference between
free speech and academic freedom, and
the latter is a privilege and not a constitu
tional right. Stewart has every right to say
whatever she wants whenever she wants,
but Stanford need not sponsor her. Advo
cating terrorism does not deserve rewards.
The "use of directed violence to achieve
social change" is the goal of violence in gen
eral, and terrorism and war fall into this
category. But for The Daily to fail to see the
difference between the two is sad and to
claim that they are equal is simply silly.
Attempting to blow up the World Trade
Center in a strike against capitalism is a far
cry from going to war with Iraq. While one
is internationally recognized terrorism, the
other, especially with U.N. support, will be
internationally recognized war. Not seeing
the difference makes me think of the differ
ence between murder and manslaughter.
The victim is dead either way, but one is pe
nalized much more than the other.
