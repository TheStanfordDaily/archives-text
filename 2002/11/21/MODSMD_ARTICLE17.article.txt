# ASSU plans to reduce students' cost of living
## 
### WINSTON LIN 
One of the most hotly debated is
sues raised during the 2002 .ASSU
elections last spring was the high
cost of living on campus. Reducing
the prices of gtxxls and services of
fered on campus is one of the pri
mary goals of the current ASSU
cost-of-living committee, which has
begun to identify key areas in need
of improvement, design plausible
proposals and initiate discussions
with the University administration.
"This quarter is dedicated to in
vestigating the subject thoroughly
so that we will be able to make our
case to the administration in the
near future," said Cost-of-living
Committee Director and ASSU Un
dergraduate Senator Sarah Schul
man. "The cost-of-living campaign
has a long timeline. There are both
short- and long-term goals."
"We are currently opening lines
of communication with CoinMach
Laundry Services, the Library
Committee and Administrators,
ResComp, the Stanford Bookstore,
TresEx and Bon Appetit," she
added.
The ASSU is currently in the
process of analyzing data from the
Survey on the Farm (SurF), an on
line survey created to gather stu
dent feedback on the quality of life
at Stanford. Results from the survey
will allow the opinions of the stu
dent body to be heard, according to
Schulman.
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza believes the issue is central to
improving student life.
"The ASSU executive campaign
to lower students' cost of living has
found much student support be
cause of the impact that the high
cost of living on campus and in the
local area has on all Stanford stu
dents," she said.
Noting that students from mod
est-income families may have to
overcome economic adversity in
order to be able to attend Stanford,
Henestroza emphasized the neces
sity of finding solutions to the high
cost of living.

"So long as Stanford is unafford
able to students, we will not be able
to competitively attract and / or re
tain students who come from work
ing-class backgrounds or who, for
other reasons, cannot afford to pay
the exorbitant prices of certain es
sential products," she said.
However, Henestroza said she
has the utmost confidence in the
cost-of-living committee to discover
creative answers.
"Sarah Schulman has done an
excellent job of spearheading the
campaign thus far. And it is our
hope that the work accomplished
this year — both the visible gains
and the groundwork that we lay for
the future — will help make Stan
ford University accessible to stu
dents from all socioeconomic back
grounds," Henestroza said.
From a student's perspective,

the costs involved in living at Stan
ford seem to be an area of concern.
"Overall, the prices on campus
are reasonable considering the
convenience that the nearby busi
nesses provide," said freshman
Daniel Salinas. "However, some of
the costs, such as the monthly $10
network connection fee, do not
seem necessary considering that
we are already paying housing
fees."
Salinas ottered his opinion on
what he would like to see changed.
"If the prices themselves can
not be directly lowered easily, per
haps some side benefits could be
made possible. For example, the
Bookstore could create a reward
system where students received
points that could be used for, say,
10 percent discount coupons or
other rewards."

Freshman Julie Spiegel said, "I
think that the prices are indicative
of the fact that some businesses
have a monopoly and can thus
charge higher prices. I would feel
better about costs if the reasons
why the prices are what they are
were explained. For instance, a
breakdown of the costs involved
with producing a textbook would
justify the prices that the Rook
store charges."
The cost-of-living committee will
soon publish a report that will in
clude the results of the committee's
findings and other informative
items, such as a price comparison
between different textbook outlets.
"We also welcome the input of
students," Schulman said. "Any
body with comments can direct
them to us. After all, this committee
was created to serve their needs."

One of the top priorities of the ASSU cost-of-living committee is to reduce prices of goods and services offered at on
campus businesses, such as the Stanford Bookstore and Tresidder Express.
