# Students celebrate Ramadan away from home
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Muslims worldwide are celebrat
ing Ramadan, the annual month of
fasting that forms one of the pillars
of their faith. Beginning Nov. 6, the
first day of Ramadan this year, Stan
ford students and other Muslims
from the surrounding community
have gathered daily lor prayers and
the fast-breaking meal, iftar, orga
nized by the Islamic Society ofStan
ford University.
"Everyone is so open and warm,
and then there's the scrumptious
food everyday," said freshman
Maham Mela.
Still, the Ramadan celebrations
can be different from those that stu
dents practice at home before com
ing to campus.
"Back home in Pakistan, the most
striking aspect of Ramadan was that
everyone knew it was Ramadan,
everything revolved around the
fast-opening time and there was a
reminder everywhere that it was a

holy month," Mela explained.
"[Ramadan] feels like a holiday
when you're with your family, but
here it's just like any other day, ex
cept you're not eating," said fresh
man Mohammad Subeh.
Though they may participate in
events organized by the society,
Muslim students at Stanford don't
have the same opportunities or
family support that they are used
to having.
"It feels a lot different," Subeh
said. "1 don't have that sense of
community, like at home or at the
mosque.
"I had my parents to tell me to
get up and pray, and here, you re
ally don't have anyone to say that to
you, so you have to take it upon
yourself."
Mela noted, "It's not easy some
times to get into the spirit of tilings,
because your college classes and ac
tivities clash with Ramadan timings."
On the upside, Ramadan can also
be a time for Muslim students to ex
plain their faith and practices to non-

Muslim students. Junior Ali Hassan
said he takes time to teach other stu
dents about his practice.
"It comes up in conversation as
someone asking, 'I've got some
food, do you want to eat?' and I'll
say, 'No, I'm fasting,' so discussion
goes on from there," he said.
"Talking to other students, it's a
little bit harder for them to relate to
why we would fast," he continued.
Some Muslim students said that
they feel like students who are not
aware of the fasting practices see
these traditions as difficult to follow.
Students last from sunrise to sun
down and then meet together to
pray and eat at the end of the day.
"A lot of [non-Muslim students]
see it as a big hardship to the Mus
lim community, when in fact it's re
ally not," said junior Ariege Mish
erghi, a computer science and
product design major.
Continuing the society's annual
Ramadan community day tradition,
the group hopes to share the expe
rience of tiiis holiday with other in

terested non-Muslim students
through an upcoming open iftar.
Several of Subeh's non-Muslim
dormmates are already learning a
bit about Ramadan, and they have
joined him in fasting this month.
"I can't say that it's hard for me,
because other people are doing it,
and they haven't done it before,"
he explained. "1 get a lot of sup
port here."
Still, for Muslim students, the Is
lamic society's gatherings are the
best way of maintaining interper
sonal lies to Islam.
"You get that sense of commu
nity here because of the Islamic
Society," Subeh said. "I don't
think I would have felt that if they
weren't here."
Mela added, "I love the Muslim
community spirit here."
