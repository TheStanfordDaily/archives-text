### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER

NCAA qualifiers Nathan Peterson
and Matt Gentry to the starting
lineup.

The bigger news (285 pounds
worth) came in the last bout of the
meet, as Stanford redshirt fresh
man and heavyweight Shawn
Ritzenthaler recorded his first col
legiate win in the form of a pin at
4:03 to secure a 25-16 Stanford
victory.
"It feels great," Ritzenthaler
said. "I went into the match know
ing that I finally had a chance to
wrestle someone my size. I wanted
to prove to my teammates and my
self that 1 can compete at the col
lege level."
The win improved Stanford's
record to 2-1 this season, while
San Francisco State dropped its
opener.
In the first bout of the night, Pe
terson — in his first meet after
coming off a suspension —
jumped out to an early 4-0 lead
over junior Joey Bareng. Trailing
8-7 late in the third period, Bareng
scored a takedown with one sec

end left for the 9-8 decision.
"Nathan looked good fora pe
riod and a half," Stanford coach
Steve Buddie said. "Making
weight for the first time during the
year is really tough, and I think it
took a lot out of him."
At 133, sophomore Brad Met
zler followed up his two major de
cisions in the team's first meet
against Menloand Navy two weeks
ago with a 10-2 major decision
over sophomore Donald Lockett.
Senior Justin Walker stretched
Stanford's team lead to 7-3 and
earned his third win of the season
in as many bouts with a 13-8 deci
sion over Gator freshman Pacifico
Garcia.
In an exciting bout that includ
ed a near tall and an unnecessary
roughness call, Stanford sopho
more Scott Polley remained per
fect on the season, holding off
Luke Santos fora 7-6 decision.
After missing the first part of
the season with mononucleosis,
last season's team points leader
Gentry returned to the starting
lineup in fine fashion.
Already holding a 6-1 lead fol
lowing three takedowns in the sec
ond period, Gentry recorded a pin
at 3:51, increasing the Cardinal
lead to 16-3.
At 165, Stanford junior John
Garfinkel took on Josh McDonald,
the first of four straight San Fran
cisco State seniors.

The Cardinal wrestling squad jumped out to an early lead in last night's meet
against San Francisco State. The Gators closed the gap, setting up the meet
deciding final bout, which Stanford's Shawn Ritzenthaler won with a pin.
After a scoreless first period,
the two traded escapes before
McDonald took a 2-1 decision
courtesy of a stalling call in the
final period.
Coming off two wins, including
a pin, in his collegiate dual meet
debut, redshirt freshman Ryan
Hagen held off the Gators'
Michael Cordsen fora 7-6 deci
sion to increase the Stanford lead
to 19-6.
Mauricio Wright, the defend
ing Division II national champion
at 184, brought the Gators back
with a pin of Stanford senior
Harold Penson at 4:56.
A major decision by San Fran
cisco State's Drew Dunbar at 197
narrowed the Stanford lead to 19-

16 and set the stage for kit/en
thaler's meet-deciding win in the
heavyweight bout.
Despite his team's victory, Bud
die stressed the Cardinal still has
plenty to work on.
"Overall I was not pleased,"
Buddie said. "We have some
bright spots and some things to be
excited about, but there are more
things to lix then there are things
to celebrate right now. Our team
realizes that."
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will
travel to Cal State-Fullerton for
its final dual meet of the early
season. Stanford will not return
to action until Dec. 29 at the
Midlands Tournament in
Evanston, 111.
Fullerton (2-0, 1-0 Pacific-10
Conference) defeated Menlo Col
lege 26-9 and UC-Davis 20-14 last
Friday.
Last season, Stanford out-mus

cled the Titans 34-9, with Walker
posting a major decision and
Fullerton forfeiting at two weight
classes.
Dan 1 licks, an assistant coach at
Oregon State for five years, re
places Ardeshir Asgari as head
coach of the Titans. Asgari retired
at the end of last season, in which
Fullerton was 3-13 and 0-6 in the
Pac-10.
Fullerton was predicted to fin
ish seventh in the Pac-10 Presea
son Coaches Poll and is led by se
nior Rowdy Lundegreen, a fa
vorite to win the Pac-10 champi
onship at 184 pounds.
Saturday, the Cardinal will
compete in the annual California
Open, also at Fullerton. In addi
tion to serving as a great chance for
Stanford's starters to try out new
techniques, the all-day tourna
ment will also be the first action for
Stanford's redshirts.
