### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER

The bigger news (285 pounds
worth) came in the last bout of the
meet, as Stanford redshirt fresh
man and heavyweight Shawn
Ritzenthaler recorded his first col
legiate win in the form of a pin at
4:03 to secure a 25-16 Stanford
victory.
"It feels great," Ritzenthaler
said. "I went into the match know
ing that I finally had a chance to
wrestle someone my size. I wanted
to prove to my teammates and my
self that 1 can compete at the col
lege level."
The win improved Stanford's
record to 2-1 this season, while
San Francisco State dropped its
opener.
In the first bout of the night, Pe
terson — in his first meet after
coming off a suspension —
jumped out to an early 4-0 lead
over junior Joey Bareng. Trailing
8-7 late in the third period, Bareng
scored a takedown with one sec

end left for the 9-8 decision.
"Nathan looked good fora pe
riod and a half," Stanford coach
Steve Buddie said. "Making
weight for the first time during the
year is really tough, and I think it
took a lot out of him."
At 133, sophomore Brad Met
zler followed up his two major de
cisions in the team's first meet
against Menloand Navy two weeks
ago with a 10-2 major decision
over sophomore Donald Lockett.
Senior Justin Walker stretched
Stanford's team lead to 7-3 and
earned his third win of the season
in as many bouts with a 13-8 deci
sion over Gator freshman Pacifico
Garcia.
In an exciting bout that includ
ed a near tall and an unnecessary
roughness call, Stanford sopho
more Scott Polley remained per
fect on the season, holding off
Luke Santos fora 7-6 decision.
After missing the first part of
the season with mononucleosis,
last season's team points leader
Gentry returned to the starting
lineup in fine fashion.
Already holding a 6-1 lead fol
lowing three takedowns in the sec
ond period, Gentry recorded a pin
at 3:51, increasing the Cardinal
lead to 16-3.
At 165, Stanford junior John
Garfinkel took on Josh McDonald,
the first of four straight San Fran
cisco State seniors.
