# Stanford launches energy project
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
University President John Hen
nessy announced yesterday the es
tablishment of the Global Climate
and Energy Project, a $225 million
partnership between Stanford and
corporate sponsors such as Exxon-
Mobil, General Electric and Schlum
berger. The program, which will be
implemented over a period of 10
years, will address concerns about
climate change and investigate the
promise and practicality of new en
vironmentally friendly technologies
to provide for the increased global
energy needs of the 21st century.
"It is a major initiative focused on
one of the most challenging prob
lems that we face: the issue of gen

erating energy in a way that is envi
ronmentally benign," Hennessy
said. "This is a fundamentally im
portant problem that requires a
strong multidisciplinary approach."
While the project has drawn
skeptical responses from some in
the environmental community,
who question whether research
funded by oil-reliant companies
can be independent of their influ
ence, remarks at today's unveiling
focused on the excitement sur
rounding the project's launch.
Franklin Orr, out-going dean of
the School of Earth Sciences and
appointed project director for G
CEP, explained that the project was
somewhat influenced by the devel

opment of Bio-X, another program
that features an interdisciplinary
approach to problem-solving.
"We did use [Bio-X] as a way to
think about how to do G-CEP orga
nizationally within the University,"
Orr said. "We will create an inter
disciplinary project with common
organizational themes with Bio-X."
According to Orr, "[G-CEP's]
objective is to understand and cre
ate technologies for global energy
systems to supply the needs of
growing populations with low
greenhouse emissions."
"That is a huge challenge," he
continued. "But it is one that places
like Stanford should engage in. We
will work hard to build the technol
ogy base to do that."
Hennessy explained that the
problems G-CEP hopes to tackle will
by no means Ix* simple to resolve.
"It is not a problem that will be
solved in two or three years, but
one that requires a long-time in
vestment," Hennessy said. "I
think the decade-long horizon is
appropriate."
Orr said that the"the project is
unusual in its breadth. We are look
ing across the full spectrum of en
ergy sources."
Hennessy explained that the
preparations for the project began
more than a year and a half ago.
"We had been contemplating a
variety of initiatives in the environ
mental area, with one of the thrusts
being the whole energy problem,"
Hennessy said. "It was actually the
industrial companies that ap
proached us about the initiative —
seeking this scale and longevity was
started by the companies."
He argued that the project's cor
porate sponsorship, spearheaded
by ExxonMobil's $100 million,
would be a boon rather than a
detriment.
"On a scale that is simply undu
plicated as far as we know, we be
lieve this to be the largest ever cor

porate research grant to a universi
ty," Hennessy said. "That is a testi
mony to how important the prob
lems are and how difficult they will
be to solve."
Hennessy said that he does not
believe that the research efforts of
G-CEP will compromised, even
though it is funded by grants from
private corporations.
"Stanford actually will control
the research agenda for the cen
ter," Hennessy said. "We will have a
corporate advisoiy group that will
set out long-term areas for work:
how to generate energy in a more
benign way and how to control [car
bon dioxide] in the atmosphere."
"The results of the research will
be freely available," he continued.
"We have gone a long way in en
suring the research independence
of the activity."
Frank Sprow, ExxonMobil vice
president of safety, health and envi
ronment activities, explained that
his company is funding the re
search to find "attractive choices."
"Unless changes are both conve
nient and affordable, they are likely
to be resisted and possibly reject
ed," Sprow said. "The way around
this conundrum is to focus on alter
natives that provide appealing
choices."
Philippe Lacour-Gayet, vice
president and chief scientist at
Schlumberger, echoed Sprow's
sentiments in stating "the key to
sustainable development is the
availability of an energy system with
two key properties: low cost and
minimum climate impact."
In a letter from Spencer Abra
ham, the U.S. secretary of energy,
he declared that G-CEP's research
activities "will play a crucial role in
helping to accelerate the develop
ment and commercialization of
promising technologies that will
bring significant environmental
benefits."
Orr said, "It is a fabulous oppor
tunity to unleash the talents of cre
ative Stanford faculty and students
on one of the grand challenges of
this century. We are very excited
about the opportunity."

lems that we face: the issue of gen

erating energy in a way that is envi
ronmentally benign," Hennessy
said. "This is a fundamentally im
portant problem that requires a
strong multidisciplinary approach."

skeptical responses from some in

opment of Bio-X, another program
that features an interdisciplinary
approach to problem-solving.
"We did use [Bio-X] as a way to
think about how to do G-CEP orga
nizationally within the University,"
Orr said. "We will create an inter
disciplinary project with common
organizational themes with Bio-X."
According to Orr, "[G-CEP's]
objective is to understand and cre
ate technologies for global energy
systems to supply the needs of
growing populations with low
greenhouse emissions."
"That is a huge challenge," he
continued. "But it is one that places
like Stanford should engage in. We
will work hard to build the technol
ogy base to do that."
Hennessy explained that the
problems G-CEP hopes to tackle will
by no means Ix* simple to resolve.
"It is not a problem that will be
solved in two or three years, but
one that requires a long-time in
vestment," Hennessy said. "I
think the decade-long horizon is
appropriate."
Orr said that the"the project is
unusual in its breadth. We are look
ing across the full spectrum of en
ergy sources."
Hennessy explained that the
preparations for the project began
more than a year and a half ago.
"We had been contemplating a
variety of initiatives in the environ
mental area, with one of the thrusts
being the whole energy problem,"
Hennessy said. "It was actually the
industrial companies that ap
proached us about the initiative —
seeking this scale and longevity was
started by the companies."
He argued that the project's cor
porate sponsorship, spearheaded
by ExxonMobil's $100 million,
would be a boon rather than a
detriment.
"On a scale that is simply undu
plicated as far as we know, we be
lieve this to be the largest ever cor

porate research grant to a universi
ty," Hennessy said. "That is a testi
mony to how important the prob
lems are and how difficult they will
be to solve."
Hennessy said that he does not
believe that the research efforts of
G-CEP will compromised, even
though it is funded by grants from
private corporations.
"Stanford actually will control
the research agenda for the cen
ter," Hennessy said. "We will have a
corporate advisoiy group that will
set out long-term areas for work:
how to generate energy in a more
benign way and how to control [car
bon dioxide] in the atmosphere."
"The results of the research will
be freely available," he continued.
"We have gone a long way in en
suring the research independence
of the activity."
Frank Sprow, ExxonMobil vice
president of safety, health and envi
ronment activities, explained that
his company is funding the re
search to find "attractive choices."
"Unless changes are both conve
nient and affordable, they are likely
to be resisted and possibly reject
ed," Sprow said. "The way around
this conundrum is to focus on alter
natives that provide appealing
choices."
Philippe Lacour-Gayet, vice
president and chief scientist at
Schlumberger, echoed Sprow's
sentiments in stating "the key to
sustainable development is the
availability of an energy system with
two key properties: low cost and
minimum climate impact."
In a letter from Spencer Abra
ham, the U.S. secretary of energy,
he declared that G-CEP's research
activities "will play a crucial role in
helping to accelerate the develop
ment and commercialization of
promising technologies that will
bring significant environmental
benefits."
Orr said, "It is a fabulous oppor
tunity to unleash the talents of cre
ative Stanford faculty and students
on one of the grand challenges of
this century. We are very excited
about the opportunity."
University President John Hen
nessy announced yesterday the es
tablishment of the Global Climate
and Energy Project, a $225 million
partnership between Stanford and
corporate sponsors such as Exxon-
Mobil, General Electric and Schlum
berger. The program, which will be
implemented over a period of 10
years, will address concerns about
climate change and investigate the
promise and practicality of new en
vironmentally friendly technologies
to provide for the increased global
energy needs of the 21st century.
"It is a major initiative focused on
one of the most challenging prob
