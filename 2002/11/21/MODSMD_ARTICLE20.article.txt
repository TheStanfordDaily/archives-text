### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
There was a restored sense of hope in Maples Pavil
ion last night.
As the final buzzer sounded and a Sixth Man Club
cheering section that had been behind the Cardinal all
the way rushed the floor in celebration, it was as if every
one — Stanford players included — began to believe
that success was really possible this year with this team.

Last night: Stanford 63, No. 11 Xavier 62

The Cardinal's (2-0) 68-62 Preseason NIT quarter
final victory came over a tough No. 11 Xavier (1 -1) team
that never backed down.
"This game was huge for us," said junior forward
Justin Davis. "We beat a top team, and it wasn't because
they didn't play well or because they didn't play hard.
We played harder, and we pulled it out."
"I'll be honest with you — I wasn't sure that we had
that in us just yet," added Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery.
Montgomery wasn't the only one surprised. The
Musketeers were stunned by a poised Stanford squad,
the same one that had barely escaped unranked Boston
University two nights earlier.
"Well, I'm not sure that that was the same team you
saw Monday night," Montgomery continued. "That
was really pretty good. We didn't appear to be as ner
vous. [We] were really fired up for this."
Surprise No. 1: In the first half, Stanford shot the ball
much better than it did against BU. The Cardinal head
ed into the locker room at the half up nine points,
shooting 55 percent from the field and going 4-for-10
from behind the arc.
Surprise No. 2: Stanford opted to go with a 1-3 zone
against the Musketeers.
"The zone was huge for us," Montgomeiy said. "It
got them standing around a bit. I don't know that we
could have guarded [Xavier's David] West man-to
man. I thought that [Xavier's] individual talent over
time would have worn us down."

victory. Childress led the Cardinal scoring along with Julius Barnes, each putting up 14 points.
Surprise No. 3: The Cardinal
handled Xavier's full-court pres
sure well.
With eight minutes to go in the
first half, Xavier decided that what
ever it was doing defensively just
wasn't working. The Musketeers
came out of the television timeout
in a full-court press. But even that
didn't detour the Cardinal. Stan
ford finished the first half in near
flawless form, only picking up three
turnovers — none of which were
caused by the full-court pressure.
In the first half, Stanford simply
outshot, outperformed and
showed more poise on the offensive
end than the Musketeers, who shot
38 percent from the field in the first
20 minutes.
Despite the early foul trouble of
Davis, who picked up two quick
fouls and was forced to sit out the
last 15 minutes of the first half,
Stanford matched Xavier's re
hounding effort.
"We crashed the heck out the
boards, and that was key for us
because they're a big team, and
we just outmuscled them," said
sophomore swingman Josh Chil
dress, who once again provided a
solid offensive performance for
the Cardinal. He finished the
game with 14 points and eight
rebounds.
The Musketeers, however, did

not go down easily. They opened
the second half on a 13-7 run. West,
a preseason All-American, was in
his usual stellar form for Xavier, fin
ishing the game with 19 points, 12
of which came in the first half.
But the Cardinal weathered
Xavier's sudden offensive storm —
and its own subsequent shooting
drought — and managed to walk
away with the victory.
With 28 seconds left in the game,
the Cardinal had exactly who they
wanted on the free-throw line, se
nior guard Julius Barnes, who fin
ished the game with 14 points. T he
usually stoic Barnes looked more
relaxed than ever as he stepped to
the charity stripe with a one-point
lead and the hopes of the Cardinal
left squarely on his shoulders. He
knocked down both free throws to
extend Stanford's lead to three on a
night when the Cardinal clearly
struggled from the line.
Stanford made a dismal 52 per
cent of its free throws, which kept
Xavier in the game down the
stretch.
"I thought late in the game that
free throws were going to lose it for
us, but they didn't," Montgomery
said. "We had the right guy at the
line late. That's just something
we've got to improve."
Stanford will play the winner of
the Eastern Illinois-Florida game in
the NIT semifinals at Madison
Square Garden on Wednesday. Be
fore that game, however, the Cardi
nal will face Rice on Sunday at 5:30
p.m. in Maples.
