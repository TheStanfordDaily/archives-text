There was a restored sense of hope in Maples Pavil
ion last night.
As the final buzzer sounded and a Sixth Man Club
cheering section that had been behind the Cardinal all
the way rushed the floor in celebration, it was as if every
one — Stanford players included — began to believe
that success was really possible this year with this team.

Last night: Stanford 63, No. 11 Xavier 62

The Cardinal's (2-0) 68-62 Preseason NIT quarter
final victory came over a tough No. 11 Xavier (1 -1) team
that never backed down.
"This game was huge for us," said junior forward
Justin Davis. "We beat a top team, and it wasn't because
they didn't play well or because they didn't play hard.
We played harder, and we pulled it out."
"I'll be honest with you — I wasn't sure that we had
that in us just yet," added Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery.
Montgomery wasn't the only one surprised. The
Musketeers were stunned by a poised Stanford squad,
the same one that had barely escaped unranked Boston
University two nights earlier.
"Well, I'm not sure that that was the same team you
saw Monday night," Montgomery continued. "That
was really pretty good. We didn't appear to be as ner
vous. [We] were really fired up for this."
Surprise No. 1: In the first half, Stanford shot the ball
much better than it did against BU. The Cardinal head
ed into the locker room at the half up nine points,
shooting 55 percent from the field and going 4-for-10
from behind the arc.
Surprise No. 2: Stanford opted to go with a 1-3 zone
against the Musketeers.
"The zone was huge for us," Montgomeiy said. "It
got them standing around a bit. I don't know that we
could have guarded [Xavier's David] West man-to
man. I thought that [Xavier's] individual talent over
time would have worn us down."
