						crack of light on an otherwise dark season

As we're approaching my fourth and
final Big Game as a Stanford student,
I feel at the same time a bit of excite
ment and disappointment about the
event.
My excitement about the game is based
more on hope and blind faith than on recent
performance and execution (kinda like the
same logic we use to justify going to see any
Kevin Costner movie since "Dances With
Wolves").
Reasonable intuition, given last week's im
plosion against Oregon State, would tell the ca
sual Stanford fan that Big Game could very
well turn into an unpleasant Saturday after
noon. But luckily for me, I was distracted from

the game by one of the more
entertaining scenarios I have
been privileged to witness in
side of Stanford Stadium.
Directly blocking my line of
sight to an Oregon State play
er streaking toward the end
/one was the unwelcome sight
of an exposed ass-crack, yearn
ing for freedom from.it's two-

sizes-too-small low-cut blue jean oppressor. As
you can probably tell from the description, the
sight was not very appealing to me, but to the
group of drunken seniors who shall remain
nameless and were sitting directly to my right,
it was a pot of gold.

Or, more appropriately, a potential recep
tacle for quarters (and small bits of chocolate),
as they fruitlessly tried to launch coins and
creamy nngat into what was later termed "The
Land that Knows No Shame."
Taken in this context, blowing an 18-point
lead doesn't really seem all that bad. And since
I was drunk during the USC game, didn't
watch the Oregon game and am still in denial
about UCLA, the last real memory I have of the
Cardinal is of its 16-6 win over Arizona. The
same Arizona team (albeit now with one at
tempted player mutiny on their list of accom
plishments this season) that put up 52 points in
