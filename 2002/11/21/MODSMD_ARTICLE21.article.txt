# A 						crack of light on an otherwise dark season

### 
As we're approaching my fourth and
final Big Game as a Stanford student,
I feel at the same time a bit of excite
ment and disappointment about the
event.
My excitement about the game is based
more on hope and blind faith than on recent
performance and execution (kinda like the
same logic we use to justify going to see any
Kevin Costner movie since "Dances With
Wolves").
Reasonable intuition, given last week's im
plosion against Oregon State, would tell the ca
sual Stanford fan that Big Game could very
well turn into an unpleasant Saturday after
noon. But luckily for me, I was distracted from

the game by one of the more
entertaining scenarios I have
been privileged to witness in
side of Stanford Stadium.
Directly blocking my line of
sight to an Oregon State play
er streaking toward the end
/one was the unwelcome sight
of an exposed ass-crack, yearn
ing for freedom from.it's two-

sizes-too-small low-cut blue jean oppressor. As
you can probably tell from the description, the
sight was not very appealing to me, but to the
group of drunken seniors who shall remain
nameless and were sitting directly to my right,
it was a pot of gold.

Or, more appropriately, a potential recep
tacle for quarters (and small bits of chocolate),
as they fruitlessly tried to launch coins and
creamy nngat into what was later termed "The
Land that Knows No Shame."
Taken in this context, blowing an 18-point
lead doesn't really seem all that bad. And since
I was drunk during the USC game, didn't
watch the Oregon game and am still in denial
about UCLA, the last real memory I have of the
Cardinal is of its 16-6 win over Arizona. The
same Arizona team (albeit now with one at
tempted player mutiny on their list of accom
plishments this season) that put up 52 points in


Ryan Stewart
a win over Cal this past weekend.
Looking at it from this skewed and
clearly illogical point of view, how
could you not be excited about our
prospects for Big Game?
My disappointment with Big
Game stems mainly from the fact
that in no sense of the word is Big
Game actually big. If you were to
visit Austin this weekend in
preparation for the Texas-Texas
A&M grudge match, you would
be overwhelmed by the pure ha
tred these two schools have for
one another. The manifestation
of that hatred on the field and in
the stands of their annual grudge

match is like an injection of pri
mal, bloodlusting, excessive
hooliganism that is so noticeably
missing from the Stanford-Cal ri
valry. Mutual discontent with one
another would probably be a
more accurate description.
There is no big significance to
the Big Game. No national rank
ings at stake. No trips to the Rose
Bowl. No BCS implications. The
fans do not get so riled up as a pre
lude to the event that there are
wild, Bay Area-wide drunken bac
chanals that last throughout the
weekend. In fact, many of the fans
won't even get so riled up as to
even go to the game or watch it on
television.
There are only two big things
about this year's Big Game. First
and foremost, it is the 20th an

niversary of The Play, the ridicu
lous, multi-lateral touchdown re
turn through the Stanford Band
to win the game for Cal that has
become legend in college football.
Secondly, this game will decide
whether or not the Stanford se
niors, along with new head coach
Buddy Teevens, will end a disap
pointing season on a positive note.
Although my reasoning may be
flawed, I predict that the Cardinal
will go out in a big way.
Stanford 23, (lal 21. Ass-C .racks 0.
