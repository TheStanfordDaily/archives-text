# Women swimmers face early challenge
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the early season will reveal any hint
as to how the Stanford women's swim
ming squad will perform in the NCAA
Championships, that hint will come this
weekend in the first home meet of the
year, the Stanford Invitational. The Car
dinal women will face off against Pacific
and defending national champion
Auburn.

Women's Swimming
vs. Auburn and Pacific, Saturday, 10:00 a.m.

"Auburn is loaded. They do not have
a weakness," said Stanford coach
Richard Quick. "They not only have a
quality swimmer in every event, but they
have depth of quality swimmers in every
event."
At last year's NCAA Championships,
Auburn blew away the competition with
a group of 11 swimmers, though the
Tigers only had first-place finishes from
one athlete, then-junior Maggie Bowen.
Yet the team's power lies in its depth.
Each of the 11 athletes that competed in
the NCAAs last March contributed
points to the team score. The Tigers had
10 top-three finishes in the meet and
boasted the second and 10th highest in
dividual scorers of the competition.
From those statistics, it could be easily
deduced that Auburn can't be beaten.
But you'll never see a Stanford athlete
reach that conclusion. After all, the Car
dinal swimmers did finish third in the
NCAAs last year and have finished no
lower than third in the competition in
the last 21 years.
Quick sees the challenge as a great op
portunity to test the strength of his team,
which is currently ranked No. 2 in the

nation.
"How they respond to that kind of
competition, I think it will determine
how successful we can be this weekend
and how successful we're going to be
later in the year," Quick said.
fhe success of the Cardinal team this
weekend will depend greatly on the way
that junior l ara Kirk races. Her breast
stroke races are always crucial, and she
must swim excellent legs in her relay
events.
Quick also calls sophomore Lacey
Boutwell "a key to our chances" in the
Invitational. Boutwell, who already has a
handful of I op-three finishes this season,
will compete in the 100- and 200-yard
freestyle events, in addition lo the 100-

yard butterfly. She also will swim a leg in
the relay events, which must go well for
the Cardinal to triumph over Auburn
and Pacific.
In addition to hoping for great per
formances from his veteran athletes,
Quick expects to see exceptional races
from the Cardinal freshmen.
"I'm looking for our freshmen to step
up and play a huge role," Quick said.
Freshman Kristin Caverly will likely
live up to the expectations of her coach
as she is currently swimming extremely
well and has proven to be a standout on
the team with her performances against
Texas and Southern California earlier

pions, Auburn University, at the Stanford Invitational.
this month.
Quick has also been impressed
with the way that freshmen Ashley
Daly and Laura Davis have been
swimming in practice and predicts
that both will race well. The team
will also be depending on fresh
man Dana Kirk to pull through in
her butterfly and freestyle events
this weekend.
All in all, the meet is going to
have to be a team effort if the
women's squad is to be victorious
against such formidable opponents.

"We have a lot of strength all to
gether as one," Boutwell said,
"and if we each have confidence in
each other to do our own jobs,
then we'll get it done as a team."
If the team can unite to race
consistently well this weekend
against what Quick calls "the
most talented and deepest team
in the country," it could give a
very good indication of how the
Cardinal will compete when the
NCAA Championships roll
around in March.
"We definitely have the talent to
beat Auburn," Tar a Kirk said. "1
think everyone's going to have to
bring their 'A-game.' Everyone's
going to have to step it up."
