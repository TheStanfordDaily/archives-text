# Students use the arts in anti-war protest
## 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR 
Students passing by the clock
tower yesterday at noon may have
been surprised to see a showcase of
visual art, skits and spoken-word
performances. What they saw was
a part of "Guerrilla Theater," a
unique anti-war protest organized
by student groups Resistance Art
and Social Protest and the Stan
ford Community for Peace and
Justice.
Sophomore Mark Otuteye and
third year law student Shahid
Buttar, co-founders of the Stan
ford Spoken Word Collective,
performed original pieces. Both
emphasized the effectiveness of
such rhetoric as a form of political
activism.
"People often ignore an activist
message because they don't know
that they need to hear it. Art is the
sugar that makes activism palat
able. As an art form, spoken word
can turn abstract politics into con
crete realities," Otuteye said.
Buttar agreed and commented
on art's ability to attract attention.
"We could give political speech
es all day, but most people would
just walk right by," he said. "Add
some style, rhythm and maybe a
little rhyming, though, and they'll
at least stick around long enough
to listen."

The performances took place
against a backdrop ofbanners hung
along the clock tower that read
"UNICEF: 500,000 Children Dead
Under U.S. Led Sanctions" and
"CIA says: Attack on Iraq = More
TeiTorism." Members ofSCPJ and
RASP also passed out fliers explain
ing their stance and ideology.
"We are criticizing a general
'culture of fear and violence' that
we see in the government's do
mestic policy, the military policy of
attacking 'dual-use' targets, its bad
faith in international law, and the
willingness to use military force
against a 'threat of a threat' instead
ofa real, imminent threat," said se
nior Calvin Miaw, co-coordinator
ofSCPJ.
According to Miaw, the event
was a part of the National Day of
Student Action, an event initiated
by Not in Our Name! According
to the organization's Web site,
Not in Our Name! was created in
March 2002 as a movement to
"strengthen and expand resis
tance to the U.S. government's
course in the wake of September
11,2001."
"The point [of the event] is to
raise awareness about the costs of
a possible war in Iraq, and some
of the history on this issue that we

normally don't get from the mass
media," said sophomore Robert
Newman, president of RASP.
Buttar expressed a strong sense
of duty and commitment to edu
cate others about the status of U. S.
foreign policy.
"I'd feel profoundly selfish if I
leveraged my education to gain
opportunities without thinking of
the implications for others. If I
can't do my part to educate my
community, I don't have any busi

ness being here. I'd be wasting the
social investment I represent as a
student," he said.
The protest ended with a
march to the CIA recruiting event
taking place in the Career Devel
opment Center. Event organizers
urged spectators to join protesters
to "thank the CIA for their bold
and firm anti-war position."
The event drew a crowd of
around 60.
"It's beautiful to see people
using creative methods to voice
their opinions on the war, and to
attract more attention to the
issue," said freshman Adrian Ros
colo-High tower.
