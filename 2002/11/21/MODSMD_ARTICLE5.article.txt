# Multiple majors uncommon, discouraged by the University
## Against a nationwide trend, 93 percent of Stanford students stick to one major 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS 
While a recent study cited evidence
that the number of students pursuing
double, triple and even quadruple ma
jors is increasing on many campuses
throughout the nation, Stanford ap

pears to be an exception to the trend. Al
though students on campus are split on
how they view multiple majors, the Stan
ford administration and faculty general
ly discourage the practice and endorse
alternative modes of study.
According to an article in The New
York Times, the nationwide trend can
be attributed to the growing number of
students who enter universities with
many credits already earned from Ad-
vanced Placement classes and col
lege courses, as well as an in
creased sense of competition
compounded by the nation's stag
nant economy.
"If you can stick two majors on
your resume, you've got a better
shot in the job market or graduate
school applications," said fifth
year senior Ben Drucker. "It gives
people a hand up."
Drucker, a chemical engineer
ing and linguistics major, is one of
a small fraction of Stanford stu
dents currently pursuing a dou
ble major.
According to University Reg
istrar Roger Printup, the num
ber of students with double ma
jors has consistently remained at
7 percent of each graduating
class since 1997. According to
Printup's statistics, students who
triple major are practically
nonexistent on campus.
Of the 122 students on average
who choose to double major each
year, many hold a positive view of
their experience and the oppor
tunities their double majors offer.
"I feel like I have a larger per
spective because of it," said senior
Jesse Froelich, a linguistics and
Spanish major, who recommends
investing in a double major.
"Often times I'll incorporate
things I've learned in one major
into class discussions for the
other, and it usually illuminates
points that people wouldn't con
sider from a unilateral point of
view," she said.
Others are skeptical of the
benefits of double-majoring. Al
though many freshmen and
sophomores try to engineer
their academic plans to accom
modate two or more majors,
many are still doubtful if they
will be able to do it.
Sophomore Allison Gaw, a po
tential biology and economics
major, is still in the process of de
ciding whether or not to double
major. One of her main concerns
is that she might have to sacrifice
the opportunity to travel abroad
in order to fill her majors' re
quirements.

Many students shy away from
double-majoring, worried that
the workload would prove un
manageable. Drucker and
Froelich emphasized that the po
tential fora multiple major really
does depend on the departments
involved.
According to Jim Plummer,
dean of the School of Engineer
ing, a double major within the en
gineering school "is quite rare . . .
because our majors carry so many
requirements."
"The School of Humanities
and Sciences has 28 departments,
of which 26 give bachelor's de
grees, and all have minors and
honors certificates," said Sharon
Long, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. The
School of Humanities and Sci
ences fits into the University's
broad strategy to steer students
toward minors, as well as other
options such as honors certificates
and research programs.
Vice Provost John Bravman,
who is aware of the national trend
toward multiple majors, said,
"That's one reason why we intro
duced the concept of the minor a
few years ago. That way, we be
lieve students can devote more
time delving into their major and
still gain a second credential."
University officials are also
concerned with the increasing
number of entering freshmen
who have already decided to dou
ble major.
"The focus should be on acquir
ing knowledge, not on stuffing all
of that acquired knowledge into
neat categories called majors," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
Freshmen and Transfer Students.
Stanford faculty and adminis
trators anticipate that the oppor
tunities they foster in place of
multiple majors will present the
University as a unique academic
environment.
"There has been a steady in
crease in the number of students
choosing a minor, doing an
honor's thesis or becoming in
volved in undergraduate re
search," said University President
John Hennessy. "It seems to be
that those intellectual avenues are
more rewarding than trying to
take lots of courses simply to com
plete multiple majors."
