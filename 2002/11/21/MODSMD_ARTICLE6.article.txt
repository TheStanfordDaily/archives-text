# ISIS to track on-campus events
## 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a few weeks, the way that students re
ceive information about on-campus events
will be revolutionized, thanks to a student
initiated endeavor called Innovative Stu
dent Information Services. ISIS leaders
hope to bring, among other things, a
dozen large high-definition plasma screens
to key locations on campus to display event
information and broadcast streaming
video.
ISIS, a joint Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Service Project and ASSU Presidential

Initiative, is being driven by student leaders
with support from optimistic faculty and ad
ministration members.
Senior Scott Cannon, one of" the pro
gram's creators, said that in addition to the
network of plasma screens, students will
have a central calendar and event details at
their fingertips on a Web site.
"[During] the first phase of ISIS, students
will be able to see comprehensive event de
tails at many places in their daily paths,"
Cannon said. "Examples include the Web
site, the high-definition screens and even on
computers in clusters and as a
desktop ticker."
One of ISIS' main focuses is to
help student groups with advertis
ing and coordination of events.
Cannon said that the aspect of
feedback within the system will be
a valuable asset.
"For student groups, we want
to offer a level of unparalleled
knowledge to aid in event-plan
ning," he said. "Group leaders can
use the calendar to avoid conflicts
when designing events. In addi
tion, they'll eventually be able to
gauge interest based on the num
ber of people that view the infor
mation. The plasma screens, Web
site and computer applications
will offer more pervasive means to
drive content to where students
will see it."
Cannon's vision for the pro
gram after the first phase deals with
personalization and community.
"In the months and years
ahead, we hope to reach a level of

intuitive personalization with
ISIS," he said. "Imagine a system
that over time learns what types of
events you like and informs you of
events that cater directly to your
interests. It's an exciting opportu
nity to build a stronger communi
ty between students who share
passions but previously never
would have interacted."
University administration has
been very supportive of the pro
gram, with groups from Housing
and Dining Enterprises to Stan
ford Athletics giving the project a
thumbs up.
"I think it can revolutionize the
way we communicate very impor
tant information, events and activ
ities to students," said Gene
Awakuni, vice provost of student
affairs. "Having screens across
campus provides an opportunity
for students and others to see
what's going on wherever they
may be. It can only be a plus and a
positive thing for all students."
Dean of Freshman and Trans
fer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims
said that she thinks it will help
freshmen find out about more
events that happen on campus.

"[They] are not the most c lue
less people, but perhaps they are
the most eager to be involved,"
Lythcott-Haims said. "[Fresh
men have] said to me, '1 never
know what's going on on cam
pus. I always hear about things

after (hey happen.' So I was able
to explain to them that there's
this hip new thing called ISIS
that the University is very com
mitted to, and it's going to revo
lutionize the way students learn
about what's going on on cam

pus. I think the frosh are really
going to take to it."
Putting the project together has
been no simple task, according to
Cannon.
"One challenge has been in ef
fectively coordinating with the
many individuals and offices who
are involved in this project, mak
ing sure that the solution address
es many needs," he said. "We are
currently focused on designing an
event information system that
truly (its the needs of students and
student group leaders. To make
the system useful, though, we need
to reach a critical mass of users
when it is released in a few
months."
Cannon said that reaching a
large enough group means having
content to display on the screens as
well as resources to which the sys
tem could direct its users.
Organizers agree that one of the
larger challenges will be deciding
what content is displayed and how
importance of events is decided.
"We need to be conscientious
about fair use of the system — de
signing guidelines and processes
that maintain a fair and accurate

display of Stanford events."
Other concerns, according to
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, include "making sure stu
dents actively support the expen
diture of the necessary funds, de
spite impending budget cuts."
"I think it [is] important to
bring ASSU resources — any
thing from funds to access to ad
ministrators — to this project be
cause the student need is there,
the timing is right and it is the re
sponsibility of the ASSU to ensure
that students are empowered to
make necessary changes to areas
affecting their lives."
Cannon said that the ISIS team,
which expects the project to be
completed some time winter quar
ter, has many spots open on its dif
ferent teams.
"We need people to be on ei
ther the ISIS core team — which
will develop the solution and
make it happen —or the pro
duction team, which manages
content."
