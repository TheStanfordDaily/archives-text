# Speaker advocates political reform
## Independent Party movement leader critiques'duopoly' 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of his national speaking
tour on the growth of the Inde
pendent Party movement, Omar
Ali gave a talk entitled "Under
standing the Past, Present and Fu
ture of the Independent Political
Movement in America," last night
in Tresidder Union. He encour
aged students to challenge the
current political structure — what
he calls a "political duopoly" —
and take part in political reform.
"We're accustomed to the bi
partisan nature of politics," Ali
said. "We need to challenge this
and go after parties through polit
ical reform."
Ali is a doctoral fellow in histo
ry at Columbia University and the
director of research for New
York's Committee fora Unified
Independent Party, which was
formed eight years ago. He be
came an Independent as a stu
dent in college, just as the Berlin
Wall came down.
The presentation was .Mi's 19th
stop on a nationwide tour that stint
ed in September and ends this
month. He was brought to campus
through Stanford in Government, a
nonpartisan student organization.
"We hosted the Omar Ali event

because we feel that the lecture's
theme appropriately reflects our
mission of introducing various po
litical viewpoints to Stanford stu
dents and will stimulate critical
thought on how Independent pol
itics play a role in U.S. public poli
cy," said Anne Kim Ho, director of
Stanford in Government's Public
Policy Forum.
As Independents, Ali said peo
ple often feel isolated and do not
get a sense of the national Inde
pendent movement that has been
emerging in the past 10 years, or
they feel frustrated with the limit
ed dialogue produced by the two
party system.
"I don't think non-voters are
apathetic," he said, discounting
the reason often given to people
who do not vote. Instead, Ali
blames political disorganization
as a factor in the lack of voter par
ticipation. That is why Ali is help
ing to organize the growing Inde
pendent movement.
In the talk, Ali also emphasized
the difficulty non-Democratic or
non-Republican Party candidates
face in getting recognition. He
cited that in order to get on a bal
lot, an Independent needs
around 40 times the number of
signatures needed by a Democrat
or Republican.
Ali described the system as un
fair and discriminatory. "Democ
rats and Republicans work togeth
er to minimize competition."
To change the political process,
Ali called for political reform, such

as campaign finance reform, ballot
modifications, same-day voter regis
tration and term-limit adjustments.
Using New York's Committee
fora Unified Independent Party
as a model for what the Indepen
dent movement can do, Ali charac
terized the CUIP as a left-center
right coalition.
"One thing we all agree upon is

the issue of political reform and
the shaping of an environment
that is inclusive," he said. Accord
ing to Ali, the CUIP supports dis
mantling the control of parties
and has been referred to by The
New York limes as "the anti
party party."

Omar Ali, a doctoral fellow in history at Columbia University and the direc
tor for New York's Committee fora Unified Independent Party, encouraged
students to challenge the current U.S. political system in a talk iast night.
Along with reformation of the
voting process, Ali said he believes
more attention needs to be direct
ed at the restructuring of the cur
rent party system.
"There is nothing [written] in
the constitution about parties,"
Ali said. "But parties control
who gets on the ballot, what is
sues get discussed and how they
are discussed."
Students who attended the
speech said they appreciated the
fresh perspective Ali offered.
"He made a persuasive argu
ment that the two party system we
have been accustomed to living in
didn't have to be that way," said ju

nior Sonia Mittal, a chair of Stan
lord in Government. "Growing or
ganization of the Independent
movement could be a symbol of the
emergence of a multiparty system."
Junior Moses Pounds was also
drawn to Ali's discussion on chang
ing the current party system.
"It's refreshing to realize that
there are viable alternatives to the
two-party system and concrete
ways to act on my frustrations with
the parties and the system."
Ali said the growing number of
Independent parties across the
country is a step towards spread
ing support for the Independent
movement.
"We're subjective creatures or
ganized by environments," he
said. "It's going to take the Inde
pendent movement to move the
country forward."

ganization of the Independent
movement could be a symbol of the
emergence of a multiparty system."
Junior Moses Pounds was also
drawn to Ali's discussion on chang
ing the current party system.
"It's refreshing to realize that
there are viable alternatives to the
two-party system and concrete
ways to act on my frustrations with
the parties and the system."
Ali said the growing number of
Independent parties across the
country is a step towards spread
ing support for the Independent
movement.
"We're subjective creatures or
ganized by environments," he
said. "It's going to take the Inde
pendent movement to move the
country forward."
As part of his national speaking
tour on the growth of the Inde
pendent Party movement, Omar
Ali gave a talk entitled "Under
standing the Past, Present and Fu
ture of the Independent Political
Movement in America," last night
in Tresidder Union. He encour
aged students to challenge the
current political structure — what
he calls a "political duopoly" —
and take part in political reform.
"We're accustomed to the bi
partisan nature of politics," Ali
said. "We need to challenge this
and go after parties through polit
ical reform."
Ali is a doctoral fellow in histo
ry at Columbia University and the
director of research for New
York's Committee fora Unified
Independent Party, which was
formed eight years ago. He be
came an Independent as a stu
dent in college, just as the Berlin
Wall came down.
The presentation was .Mi's 19th
stop on a nationwide tour that stint
ed in September and ends this
month. He was brought to campus
through Stanford in Government, a
nonpartisan student organization.
"We hosted the Omar Ali event

because we feel that the lecture's
theme appropriately reflects our
mission of introducing various po
litical viewpoints to Stanford stu
dents and will stimulate critical
thought on how Independent pol
itics play a role in U.S. public poli
cy," said Anne Kim Ho, director of
Stanford in Government's Public
Policy Forum.
As Independents, Ali said peo
ple often feel isolated and do not
get a sense of the national Inde
pendent movement that has been
emerging in the past 10 years, or
they feel frustrated with the limit
ed dialogue produced by the two
party system.
"I don't think non-voters are
apathetic," he said, discounting
the reason often given to people
who do not vote. Instead, Ali
blames political disorganization
as a factor in the lack of voter par
ticipation. That is why Ali is help
ing to organize the growing Inde
pendent movement.
In the talk, Ali also emphasized
the difficulty non-Democratic or
non-Republican Party candidates
face in getting recognition. He
cited that in order to get on a bal
lot, an Independent needs
around 40 times the number of
signatures needed by a Democrat
or Republican.
Ali described the system as un
fair and discriminatory. "Democ
rats and Republicans work togeth
er to minimize competition."
To change the political process,
Ali called for political reform, such

as campaign finance reform, ballot
modifications, same-day voter regis
tration and term-limit adjustments.
Using New York's Committee
fora Unified Independent Party
as a model for what the Indepen
dent movement can do, Ali charac
terized the CUIP as a left-center
right coalition.
"One thing we all agree upon is

the issue of political reform and
the shaping of an environment
that is inclusive," he said. Accord
ing to Ali, the CUIP supports dis
mantling the control of parties
and has been referred to by The
New York limes as "the anti
party party."

Omar Ali, a doctoral fellow in history at Columbia University and the direc
tor for New York's Committee fora Unified Independent Party, encouraged
students to challenge the current U.S. political system in a talk iast night.
Along with reformation of the
voting process, Ali said he believes
more attention needs to be direct
ed at the restructuring of the cur
rent party system.
"There is nothing [written] in
the constitution about parties,"
Ali said. "But parties control
who gets on the ballot, what is
sues get discussed and how they
are discussed."
Students who attended the
speech said they appreciated the
fresh perspective Ali offered.
"He made a persuasive argu
ment that the two party system we
have been accustomed to living in
didn't have to be that way," said ju

nior Sonia Mittal, a chair of Stan
lord in Government. "Growing or
ganization of the Independent
movement could be a symbol of the
emergence of a multiparty system."
Junior Moses Pounds was also
drawn to Ali's discussion on chang
ing the current party system.
