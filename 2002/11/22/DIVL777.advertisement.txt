Dear Berkeley and Stanford Campus Community and Friends,
As we approach the advent of the 105 th Big Game there are a few
important facts of which we should remain mindful. The November
23rd contest will continue one of the oldest, richest traditions in the
Bay Area. Our institutions both have storied heritages on the grid
iron and, most importantly, in the classroom.
This year's contest will be held at the University of California's
Memorial Stadium. While the rivalry between our two schools is
always intense, our primary goal is to ensure that Big Game will be
well played on the field and enjoyable for all those in attendance.
Given the high academic and ethical values of both our universities,
we feel it would immensely tarnish the spirit of Big Game and the
image of our institutions should irresponsible behavior be affiliated
in any manner with this event. Unfortunately, there has been an
occurrence of just such behavior at recent Big Games. We therefore
find it imperative to insist that all involved with Saturday's event
make every effort to ensure that the focus is solely as an athletic
event steeped in tradition. While we encourage those who attend to
express their team spirit, let's all work together to keep these expres
sions of support as responsible as possible.
The Big Game has over a century of memories and tradition. Let
each of us take the appropriate steps to keep these memories and
this great tradition a positive one for all.
