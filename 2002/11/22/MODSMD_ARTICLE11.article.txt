lic service, even during these times of turmoil, according to law student
Jeremiah Frei-Pearson of The American Constitution Society. Dukakis is
currently a professor of political science at Northeastern University.
"(1 )ukakis| will urge t hose in attendance to remember the needs of the
less fortunate as they begin their professional careers," Frei-Pearson
said. "Most Stanford law students are offered jobs paying $125,000 a
year upon graduation. Gov. Dukakis will urge us not to let the promise
of these huge salaries cause us to forget our responsibilities to society."

Berkeley and Stanford engineers will play 'Little
Big Game'
On Nov. 23, engineering students from the Fau Beta Pi chapters of
UG- Berkeley and Stanford will battle each other this Saturday before Big
Game, in the "Little Big Game."
"[The 'Little Big Game'] is a 'mini' football game between the mem
bers of our two chapters to compete for the Fau Beta Pi Axe — a 'mini'
version of the real axe," said Terence Ghia, senior in electrical engineer
ing and economics and president of Fau Beta Pi. "It's also a chance for
the Stanford and Berkeley chapters to interact."
This year, the "Little Big Game" will be held at a field near Big Game
and is expected to have 30 to 40 participants, with about 15 to 20 from
each side, Cliia said.
" Fhe Little Big Game lias been a tradition between the Stanford and
Berkeley chapters for countless years and tries to break the stereotype of
engineers all being nerds with pocket protectors stuck in the lab 24 / 7,"
he added.
This event will be held from 10 a.m. to noon at the North Hearst Field
in Berkeley.
SCBN launches news program
Yesterday, the Stanford Gable Broadcasting Network, channel 5,
aired its first news show at 5:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
"Our news show is basically a learning and training session," said ju
nior Kiki McGehee, the executive director of SCBN. McGehee expects
toairanot her news show on Dec. 4, the last one this quarter. Possible top
ics for the upcoming news show include Gaieties and sports results.
According to McGehee, before the creation of SCBN, she and stu
dents Andy Adler and Lian Bloch, now the two anchors for SCBN, de
cided to launch a news show and worked with a team of other students
with little experience to make their idea a success. In creating the first
news show yesterday, they thought about what they wanted the news to
be and how the show should be formatted.
SCBN, which consists of six reporters, contains news teams in the
areas of entertainment, campus news, sports and interviews or specific
themes. McGehee expressed her hope to have the show aired weekly
during winter quarter.
