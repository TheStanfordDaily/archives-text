## Al-Qaida operative in American custody 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.
authorities are interrogating the
newly captured chief of al-Qaida's
operations in the Persian Gulf in
hopes of gaining information that
might thwart terrorist attacks, offi
cials said yesterday.
Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a sus
pected mastermind of the USS
Cole bombing in October 2000,
was taken in an undisclosed for
eign country during the last sever
al weeks. The Saudi is now in U.S.
custody, U.S. government officials
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Al-Nashiri was held briefly in
Afghanistan before being flown to

an undisclosed location, sources
said. Officials declined to com
ment on the circumstances or loca
tion of his capture. lie had last
been reported in Yemen.
He is probably the highest
ranking lieutenant of Osama bin
Laden seized since the March
capture of Abu Zubaydah, al-
Qaida's chief coordinator of ter
rorist cells around the globe.
Born in Saudi Arabia, al-
Nashiri is believed to be in his mid
30s, officials said.
"He has a reputation as a ruth
less operator," said one U.S. offi
cial. "He is a very committed fol
lower of Osama bin Laden."
