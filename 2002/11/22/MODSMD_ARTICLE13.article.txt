BETHLEHEM, West Bank
(AP) â€” Israeli forces entered the
West Bank town of Bethlehem
early today.
The first Israeli forces entered
Bethlehem from the south, wit
nesses said, and surrounded the
Dheisheh refugee camp next to
the town. The biblical town is just
south of Jerusalem.
It was just the latest Israeli in
cursion into the biblical town. Is
raeli forces have carried out air and
ground raids often during 26
months of Palestinian-Israeli vio
lence, taking full control of Bethle
hem twice before.

Troops headed for Manger
Square to cut off the Church of the
Nativity, which marks the tradi
tional birthplace of Jesus, said Is
raeli military spokesman Doron
Spielman.
In April, dozens of gunmen
fled into the church ahead of in
vading Israeli troops, setting off
a tense 39-day standoff. It ended
when Israel and the Palestinians
agreed to send 26 of the gunmen
to Gaza and exile 13 others to
Europe.
After 3 a.m. today, Israeli troops
entered the town in force for the
first time since August.
