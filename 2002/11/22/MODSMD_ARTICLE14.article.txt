# NATO accepts ex-Soviet states

TALLINN,' Estonia (AP) —
Champagne corks popped, legis
lators cheered and one leader
shaved his beard in celebration as
Eastern European nations re
joiced at receiving invitations to
join NATO.
Latvian Prime Minister Einars
Repse called yesterday the most
important day in his country's his
tory since the Baltics regained in
dependence during the 1991 col
lapse of the Soviet Union.
"This means our independence
and the ideals of freedom and
democracy that we fought for will
be protected forever," he said,
speaking to a crowd in driving
snow by the Freedom Monument
in Riga, Latvia's capital.
Estonian legislator Mart Laar
kept the promise he made as pre
mier last year that he'd shave his
trademark blond beard if NATO
invited the Baltics, which made
entry a top foreign policy priority a
decade ago.
NATO issued invitations to
seven ex-communist nations —
Baltic states Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia, as well as Bulgaria, Ro
mania, Slovakia and Slovenia —
during its summit yesterday in
Prague, the Czech capital. All are
expected to join as full members
in 2004.
" This is the first moment of na
tional dignity after World War I,"
said Traian Basescu, mayor of the
Romanian capital of Bucharest.
After World War 11, Romania fell
under communist dictatorship.

As many as 8,000 schoolchild
ren and office workers, some wav
ing American flags, poured into
the streets of Romania to celebrate.
Lawmakers in Bulgaria abrupt
ly suspended debate on next year's
budget fora 210-1 vote to approve
a resolution praising NA TO.
" Today, Bulgaria achieved its
first significant success in the 21st
century," said Plamen Panayotov,
from the governing National
Movement Simeon 11.
Baltic media broadcast the
event live and politicians watched
TVs, shouting approval as the
names of their countries were
read.
Because of once-vehement
Russian objections to membership
for ex-Soviet republics, the Baltic
bids were seen as far more con
tentious than the others — and
they were initially considered long
shots.
That's made their success all the
sweeter.
"Considering where we were
years ago, it's very gratifying," said
Estonian parliamentarian Mari-
Ann Kelam, sipping celebratory
champagne.
Politicians have avoided saying
it, but most Baltic people are quick
to point to Russia as reason No. 1
for wanting to snuggle under
NATO's protective wing.
"You know other neighbors
who might ever invade us?" said
Tonu Ekberg, 58, shopping at a
market in Tallinn, Estonia's capi
tal. "Sweden? Finland? Come on!"
