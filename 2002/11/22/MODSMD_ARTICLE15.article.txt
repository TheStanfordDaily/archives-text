## The
						Stanford Daily Support Stanford football at 105th Big Game 
### 
Published Since 1891

One might say the Stanford football
team plays two seasons every year.
1 he first season typically consists of
10 games, played against various
opponents, sometimes culminating in a post
season appearance. The second is made up of
just one game, with one rival, for stakes far be
yond that of any bowl game. The first season
usually contains both joys and travails, though
this year it has seen more than its share of dis
appointments, brought on by injuries, person
nel changes and various intangibles. The sec
ond season, however, knows nothing of this
and contains only elation and exuberance.
We encourage all Stanford students, faculty,
stall and alumni to support Stanford football
enthusiastically in its second season, clieering
the Cardinal to victory in the 105 th Big Game
this Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
Perhaps Stanford's most hallowed tradition,
Big Game is also one of the greatest rivalries in

all of college athletics, from which many en
during contributions to the culture of sport
have emerged. Not the least of these, "The
Play," will celebrate its 20th anniversary. (For
the few of you out there who have no idea what
"The Play" is, drop everything this instant and
go to http://alumni.berkeley.edu/KCAA_Mul
timedia/the_play_ 1982.a5p — ignore the solic
itous Cal propaganda.) We urge all Stanford
fans in the Bay Area to participate in this mo
mentous tradition by attending this year's Big
Game. Whether or not they will witness college
football history this Big Game, Stanford fans
will share in the power and spirit of something
much larger than the sport of football.
Stanford students have every reason to be
proud of their football athletes. They are class
acts, such as Ryan Wells and Kirk Chambers.
They are gifted athletes: Luke Powell, Teyo
Johnson, Kerry Carter, Kyle Matter and Chris
Lewis. They are the academic peers of the most

talented students in the world. Over 80 percent
of them graduate, a figure among the best in
the nation, well exceeding the 48 percent grad
uation rate for Cal football players. Kwame
Harris, David Bergeron, Matt Leonard and
Casey Moore are among those who distinguish
themselves with the sorts of exceptional talents
one sees in so many Stanford students. And
some, like Craig Albrecht, have even been
known to write a column for The Daily.
Likewise, Stanford football players, coaches
and staff are proud to represent a campus that is
visited daily by awestruck sightseers, many of
whom dream that they or their children will one
day be among those confident students they see
walking around the Main Quad. Yet even more,
Cardinal football players take great honor in
representing their follow students on the grid
iron, training all year and giving up significant
portions of their lives so that their classmates can
have the singular pleasure to come up close to

the Axe and touch its blade — a pleasure no Cal
student has experienced in the last seven years.
No Big Game editorial would be complete
without the usual exhortations for decorous be
havior and good sportsmanship. While largely
preaching to the choir, we remind Stanford stu
dents to reflect on which school's fans have the
tradition of treating opposing fans more hon
orably. Ponder which school's students practice
peace at home rather than only forcing it on
others, and which school's faithful understand
that justice relates to how you conduct yourself
toward others, not only how you think every
one else should act. Remember which school
has nothing to prove, and which school is still
clamoring to teach the world a lesson. Finally,
consider the two institutions' athletic depart
ments: which one upholds its school's venera
ble Honor Code, and which one has just been
