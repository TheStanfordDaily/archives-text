# THE
						WAY I SEE IT
## Giving thanks

This quarter I'm
taking brain and
behavior, a very
intense look al how the
nervous system basically
runs your life. According
to the professor, a very
high percentage of
Americans currently suf
fer from at least one type

J l
of mental disorder—one ofthe most com
mon of which is depression. Often, I think,
depression is related to people not feeling
satisfied with some aspect of their lives or
themselves. People have issues with not
being pretty, rich, intelligent or hard
working enough, not being happy
enough in their relationships or careers,
and sometimes, just not feeling that life is
really worth it at all.
Which is very sad. More and more, I
see this condition manifesting itself right
here at Stanford — people feel genuinely
unhappy with life despite the fact that
ihey ostensibly live very well. What makes
this particularly tragic is the fact that we
really do live very well. We're just not al
ways able to appreciate thai because we
live in a society with

a mindset that tells
us that we must al
ways be striving to
improve ourselves,
to do better, to
achieve more. It's a
mindset that can
bring a lot of suc
cess, but one that
can also bring a lot

of misery. All this individualistic ambition
ultimately leaves us lonely, tired, unsatis
fied and unfulfilled — even at the top of
the success ladder.
Luckily, I realize that the United States
seems to have built in a mechanism to deal
with this. I'm talking about Thanksgiving.
Since I am not from the U.S., this is a hol
iday that doesn't really take on any special
historical or sentimental significance for
me. I don't ever spend Thanksgiving with
my family because they're too far away, in
South Africa. (If I were to go home, it
would take two days just to reach my fam
ily. All I'd be able to do would be to have
dinner at the airport and then board my
returning flight — so I don't bother.) I
don't even have any special family tradi
tions or a long history of Thanksgiving
memories (though the two I hanksgivings
I've spent at Stanford have been very spe
cial to me because of the love of the beau
tiful, amazing friends I spent them with).
To me, Thanksgiving is not at all a part of
what I've been brought up with. Hut, I do
think it is a wonderful idea.
Oprah says that people should keep
gratitude journals to remind them of all
the beautiful little things they should be
grateful for in life. When 1 think of
Thanksgiving, that's what comes to mind
— Thanksgiving as a time to highlight

your gratitudes, to reflect on them for
yourself and to share them with others.
I'm not trying to get too sentimental
here or anything. Even writing this makes
me think of how annoyed 1 got the other
day while watching the latest India Arie
video for the song "Little Things." In the
song, she sings that she doesn't need fancy
silk or satin because she loves her white
cotton (or something like that) — which
was so irritating to me, because I love both
silk and satin, and 1 get very happy when
I acquire either of them in various forms
(happier than when I get a white cotton t
shirt, for sure). 1 was like, why does she
keep making these songs about not need
ing anything more than what's natural in
life? Surely it's okay to get excited about
something completely consumerist and
superficial?
But as I began writing this column, I
started thinking about the things I am re
ally grateful for. And they ended up being
the simpler things. So here's a short list of
what I really love about my life:
First, I am grateful for my wonderful,
talented and beautiful family. They are
the people who have known and nurtured

me throughout my
life. Amazingly,
they manage to
love me despite my
self, which is no
easy task.
Second, 1 am
grateful for my
friends — some of
the most incredible

people I know.
They are future world leaders, brilliant
engineers, doctors and world-class ath
letes who I'm so blessed to have met here.
I am thankful for the wonderful way they
manage to keep me sane.
Third, I am grateful for the beauty of my
surroundings. This blew my mind again
today. 1 was sitting in the Oval and looking
at the view of Mem Chu and the foothills.
I his campus is so stunningly gorgeous; it's
still a surprise to me, occasionally, even
though I've" been here for three years.
()f course, there are 1,000 other things
I could talk about, but I had to pick those
that would be relevant, and I really found
that these are some of my favorite reasons
for being really glad to be alive. Which is
sometimes all you need to help you figure
out your sadness, stress or depression.
So for the five days of Thanksgiving
break, try to take time to remember what's
important, what brings you happiness and
joy. I think you'll find that what's really
worth worrying and troubling your head
over — what really matters in the scheme
of life — comes down to something less,
and yet so much more, than the difference
between a li+ and an A- on your next
final.
