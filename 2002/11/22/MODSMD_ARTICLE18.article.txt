989 Sports ad 'poisons' Daily
Reading The Daily, I caught an adver
tisement on the back page for 989 Sports'
NCAA Gamebreaker game. It pro
claimed that Cal is number one, based on
a recent "videogame poll." 1 (eel that this
is a terrible mistake because a) it is Big
Game week, and b) Gal absolutely blows.
I hope 989 Sports' stock plummets, and
they have to file Chapter 11. EA's NCAA
Football 2003 is a much better game any
way. I enjoy The Daily, and I want to
keep reading it without having my eyes
poisoned by anything that praises that
miserable school. After all, if there is a
God in this world, then there is a Golden
Bear burning in hell at the left hand of
Satan. Screw Cal.

MEChA supports black community's
campaign for more space
The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan ( MEChA) supports the numer
ous actions the Black Student Union and
the black community are taking to address
the extremely limited space of the Black
Community Services Center. MEChA rec
ognizes the grave importance of adequate
community center space. El Centro C.lii
cano houses more than 15 ('.hie ana / oand
Latina/o organizations that use its re
sources and space on a daily basis. We do
not take this space for granted; it serves
many purposes and provides a comfort
able place that allows students to build a
strongsense of community. Such a space is
necessary for the growth of a community.
As of now, some organizations from the
black community must hold meetings in
El Centro Chicano because of the lack of

space in the current BCSC. El Centro Chi
cano gladly offers its space to other com
munities, but the fact is that each commu
nity needs a separate, individual space to
call its own. This is why MEChA under
stands the importance of a bigger and bet
ter black house and also considers this an
issue that should be addressed by the ad
ministration now.
The issue of more space for the black
community is not a recent demand. It
should be made clear that this issue had al
ready been presented to the administra
tion, which simply chose to stall the obvi
ous problem by ignoring it as long as pos
sible. The moment of accountability to this
community has come. Now is the time to
address the question of why Stanford
boasts its largest incoming class of African-
American students, but ironically refuses
to allocate more space to the BCSC.
Stanford flaunts this diversity, but
when it really counts, it refuses to follow
through on its commitment to diversity
on campus.
Another important point to make is
that most of the recruitment of students
from diverse backgrounds comes from the
community centers. The community cen
ters' recruitment programs during Admit
Weekend are often what attract students
of different ethnicities lo Stanford. These
community centers have limited funding,
are understaffed (most have two or fewer
full-time employees) and depend on stu
dents to run and plan events. The stu
dents who work and volunteer to keep
these centers alive often sacrifice grades
and academic work to support their com
munities. The least Stanford c an do is sup
port the BCSC wilh a bigger and better
space — one that can house the numerous
organizations under the BCSC umbrella
and is located centrally on campus.
MEChA supports the BSU and urges

Stanford to respond to the black commu
nity's demands.

Stewart's freedom of speech
was 'never abridged'
I'lease ( heck your facts before you write
an editorial:
1) Lynne Stewart said her quote on
Sept. 1 1 was taken out of context. She
never said the same thing about her quote
advocating directed violence for social
change in the two instances she spoke at
(he Law School. When I asked her to re
tract it last Monday, when she came to
speak, she refused to.
2) I lie petition that was circulated in
cluded the signatures of quite a few stu
dents involved in the public interest de
partment, including myself , the author of
the petition. I give an evening each week
to the VAl' program, translating for immi
grant families. 1 here were many others
who were involved in the public interest
department who signed the petition.
H) I here are key distinctions between
war waged by our elected officials and
achieving domestic political aims through
violence.
4) Lynne Stewart's freedom of speech
was never abridged. She came here to
speak on the weekend of Nov. 9-10 and in
formally mentored students on Nov. 12.
Her being honored was all that was
abridged. Universities should let all air
their opinions. I hey should not however,
tacitly endorse all opinions that are aired.
