989 Sports ad 'poisons' Daily
Reading The Daily, I caught an adver
tisement on the back page for 989 Sports'
NCAA Gamebreaker game. It pro
claimed that Cal is number one, based on
a recent "videogame poll." 1 (eel that this
is a terrible mistake because a) it is Big
Game week, and b) Gal absolutely blows.
I hope 989 Sports' stock plummets, and
they have to file Chapter 11. EA's NCAA
Football 2003 is a much better game any
way. I enjoy The Daily, and I want to
keep reading it without having my eyes
poisoned by anything that praises that
miserable school. After all, if there is a
God in this world, then there is a Golden
Bear burning in hell at the left hand of
Satan. Screw Cal.

MEChA supports black community's
campaign for more space
The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan ( MEChA) supports the numer
ous actions the Black Student Union and
the black community are taking to address
the extremely limited space of the Black
Community Services Center. MEChA rec
ognizes the grave importance of adequate
community center space. El Centro C.lii
cano houses more than 15 ('.hie ana / oand
Latina/o organizations that use its re
sources and space on a daily basis. We do
not take this space for granted; it serves
many purposes and provides a comfort
able place that allows students to build a
strongsense of community. Such a space is
necessary for the growth of a community.
As of now, some organizations from the
black community must hold meetings in
El Centro Chicano because of the lack of

space in the current BCSC. El Centro Chi
cano gladly offers its space to other com
munities, but the fact is that each commu
nity needs a separate, individual space to
call its own. This is why MEChA under
stands the importance of a bigger and bet
ter black house and also considers this an
issue that should be addressed by the ad
ministration now.
The issue of more space for the black
community is not a recent demand. It
should be made clear that this issue had al
ready been presented to the administra
tion, which simply chose to stall the obvi
ous problem by ignoring it as long as pos
sible. The moment of accountability to this
community has come. Now is the time to
address the question of why Stanford
boasts its largest incoming class of African-
American students, but ironically refuses
to allocate more space to the BCSC.
Stanford flaunts this diversity, but
when it really counts, it refuses to follow
through on its commitment to diversity
on campus.
Another important point to make is
that most of the recruitment of students
from diverse backgrounds comes from the
community centers. The community cen
ters' recruitment programs during Admit
Weekend are often what attract students
of different ethnicities lo Stanford. These
community centers have limited funding,
are understaffed (most have two or fewer
full-time employees) and depend on stu
dents to run and plan events. The stu
dents who work and volunteer to keep
these centers alive often sacrifice grades
and academic work to support their com
munities. The least Stanford c an do is sup
port the BCSC wilh a bigger and better
space — one that can house the numerous
organizations under the BCSC umbrella
and is located centrally on campus.
MEChA supports the BSU and urges

Stanford to respond to the black commu
nity's demands.

Stewart's freedom of speech
was 'never abridged'
I'lease ( heck your facts before you write
an editorial:
1) Lynne Stewart said her quote on
Sept. 1 1 was taken out of context. She
never said the same thing about her quote
advocating directed violence for social
change in the two instances she spoke at
(he Law School. When I asked her to re
tract it last Monday, when she came to
speak, she refused to.
2) I lie petition that was circulated in
cluded the signatures of quite a few stu
dents involved in the public interest de
partment, including myself , the author of
the petition. I give an evening each week
to the VAl' program, translating for immi
grant families. 1 here were many others
who were involved in the public interest
department who signed the petition.
H) I here are key distinctions between
war waged by our elected officials and
achieving domestic political aims through
violence.
4) Lynne Stewart's freedom of speech
was never abridged. She came here to
speak on the weekend of Nov. 9-10 and in
formally mentored students on Nov. 12.
Her being honored was all that was
abridged. Universities should let all air
their opinions. I hey should not however,
tacitly endorse all opinions that are aired.

Review editor's comments at
FOCI panel: 'totally unsound'
I went to the Forum on Contemporary
Issues discussion on a living-wage last
Thursday, and I found the arguments of
one of the speakers, Joe 1 ondsdale, editor
in chief of the Stanford Review, totally un
sound. Londsdale opposes a living-wage
policy of any sort for two reasons: 1) In
creasing wages will take away workers' in
centive to better educate themselves, im
prove their skills and move up the social
ladder, and 2) Policies aimed at income re
distribution, such as a living-wage policy,
are socialist in nature and should not be
practiced in the capitalist United States.
These are not reasons for not imple
menting a living-wage policy. First, il is ex
tremely doubtful that making two more
bucks an hour will really remove the in
centive fora worker to advance his or her
position. Does il sound the slightest bit
plausible that a worker who initially feels
discontent with her status quo and plans on
taking some courses from a community
college will at once become wholly satisfied
with her life and not feel the urge to attend
school any more because of the extra $50
or $60 she can make in a week with the im
plementation of a living-wage policy?
Londsdale wants more educational pro
grams for workers. That's great, but these
programs are not substitutes for the basic
necessities that workers desperately need
for themselves and their children. Besides,
even raising the overall educational level of
the population is not going toeradicate low
skilled jobs. We as a society always require

people to collect the garbage on the street
regardless of how well educated our fellow
citi/ens are. Underdeveloped countries
need garbage collectors; developing coun
tries need garbage collectors; the U.S.,
highly developed as ii is, also ueecls garbage
collectors. If any member of the society is
deprived of access to enough basic nec essi
ties because his or her job does not require
a lot of skills and professional training, that
is just plain wrong and unfair.
Secondly, the claim that a living-wage
policy would be socialist and thus should
not be practiced in the capitalist United
States is a nonsensical claim. Laissez-faire
| practices are] never meant to allow ex
ploitation of workers, just as freedom of
speech is never meant to allow defamatory
remarks. 1 don't see how a living-wage pol
icy breaks the frame of capitalism, since it is
no more than a tool by which workers are
provided with a financial safety net. A liv
ing-wage policy is not a rule intentionally
set up to intervene in the business ac tivities
of companies. And even if a living-wage
policy is indeed socialist, so what? We citi
zens establish whatever system we need to
help everyone lead a better life. It is the sys
tem that is subject to what we want to do
and what we want to achieve, not the other
way around. If "socialism," defined by
I ondsdaleasa system that permits a living
wage policy, does make people better off,
then so be it. I will get in touch with |U.S.
President | George W. Bush tomorrow and
tell him that the U.S. should be called "a so
cialist state"from now on.

Hillel groundbreaking date

As a student who has worked as an in

was excited to see the article, "Hillel to move

Life, l he article captured the enthusiasm
that both the Hillel staff and Jewish stu
dents leel about this project, But as an in
formed party, 1 feel that it is only lair to the
readers ofThe Stanford Daily that I correct
some errors present in the article. First and
foremost, the executive director of! fillel at
Stanford is Debra Feldstein, not Debra
Stein. "Fhrough Feldstein's tireless efforts,

the Jewish community at Stanford has in
creased its visibility and broadened its
range of activities. Also, while the capital
campaign and design of the building is
moving ahead, the project will not be fin
ished by next winter, as slated in the article
and implied by the headline. 1 lillcl has yet
to establish a date for groundbreaking,

Men's wafer polo coverage lacking
I have been disappointed with the lack
of actual sports coverage in I lie Daily's
sports section of late, especially concern
ing men's water polo. There has been vir
tually no mention of the team in the past
few weeks, despite the fact that men's
water polo is ranked number one in the
nation. I realize, though, that it is impera
tive to devote a certain amount of column
space to the editorials and opinions of
columnists such as Spencer Porter, Mac
Levincand Ryan Stewart. Porter's summa
tion of his past love life; Levine's glorifica
tion of beer pong tournaments at SAE;
Stewart's proclamation that he should be
the head football coach — these are all ex
tremely important contributions that be
long in The Daily, and it would be a traves
ty if the Stanford community wasn't able to
be enlightened by these columns.
Despite the necessity of the aforemen
tioned columns, seeing as men's water polo
is a varsity sport, like field hockey, football
and women's volleyball, I don't think it is
too much to ask fora summary of the pre
vious week's games, or, failing that, a single
line reporting the score. 1 don't think that 1
am requesting anything unreasonable. 1
simply believe that everyone, from colum
nists to varsity teams, deserves their fair
share of coverage in the sports section.

Defending Spencer Porter
In response to Wednesday's letter to
the editor from Brandon Reavis ("Sports
column is'deeply offensive' "), I must offer
a defense of Spencer Porter's work. I feel
that that column, although not a journalis
tic masterpiece by any stretch, was com
pletely misunderstood.
First of all, the claim that Porter's col
umn "displays a chauvinistic attitude to
ward women's sports and a mistaken im
pression that the field hockey team would
actually date him" is absurd. I don't think
the gender of the athletes in question was
a major factor in Porter's choice of the
break-up metaphor or the"I ligh fidelity"
reference. I could just as easily see a male
columnist with a similar writing style make
the same comparison when discussing a
male sports team; the intended humor in
no way depends on the athletes being
women. The column was not trying to
imply that the members of the field hoc k
ey team "would actually date him" and to
discuss that scenario is just an unwarrant
ed personal attack on the columnist. To
characterize the column as male c hauvin
ism is just an overeager attempt to invoke
the taboo of political incorrectness.
Also, I think we all know that The Daily
is not having its doors knocked down by
throngs of ambitious young journalists
vying fora spot on the writing staff, as evi
denced by the perpetual presence of ads
looking for writers. The claim that there
are "hundreds" on this campus with the
proper devotion to the sport of field hock
ey is a bit optimistic. I mean no disrespect
to the field hockey team by saying this; I

have the utmost respect and appreciation
lor them as a quality varsity sport on c am
pus. However, it's clear that The Daily is
desperate enough tor heat writers to hire a
licit I hockey novice such as Porter. Reavis
says that he himself is able to give a damn
about Field lux key, so until I see his name
in the byline of a field lux key article, he has
no right to complain.
Porter's column did border on inappro
priate (Okay, it c rossed over that border a
little bit), but ii was self-deprecating more
than anything else; he showed a lot more
contempt lor himself than for the sport of
lield hockey in the course of his fiOO-or-so
words. If anything, the only thing 1 found
truly objectionable in Porter's column was
the fact that he quoted a member ol the
team by name, apparently without her per
mission. Otherwise, though, the com
plaints Reavis voiced in his letter were
reading way too far between the lines of
Porter's column, and he shouldn't be com
plaining about the lack of proper field
hockey coverage in I lie Daily unless he
wants to do something about it.

strongsense of community. Such a space is
necessary for the growth of a community.
As of now, some organizations from the
black community must hold meetings in
El Centro Chicano because of the lack of

space in the current BCSC. El Centro Chi
cano gladly offers its space to other com
munities, but the fact is that each commu
nity needs a separate, individual space to
call its own. This is why MEChA under
stands the importance of a bigger and bet
ter black house and also considers this an
issue that should be addressed by the ad
ministration now.
The issue of more space for the black
community is not a recent demand. It
should be made clear that this issue had al
ready been presented to the administra
tion, which simply chose to stall the obvi
ous problem by ignoring it as long as pos
sible. The moment of accountability to this
community has come. Now is the time to
address the question of why Stanford
boasts its largest incoming class of African-
American students, but ironically refuses
to allocate more space to the BCSC.
Stanford flaunts this diversity, but
when it really counts, it refuses to follow
through on its commitment to diversity
on campus.
Another important point to make is
that most of the recruitment of students
from diverse backgrounds comes from the
community centers. The community cen
ters' recruitment programs during Admit
Weekend are often what attract students
of different ethnicities lo Stanford. These
community centers have limited funding,
are understaffed (most have two or fewer
full-time employees) and depend on stu
dents to run and plan events. The stu
dents who work and volunteer to keep
these centers alive often sacrifice grades
and academic work to support their com
munities. The least Stanford c an do is sup
port the BCSC wilh a bigger and better
space — one that can house the numerous
organizations under the BCSC umbrella
and is located centrally on campus.
MEChA supports the BSU and urges

Stanford to respond to the black commu
nity's demands.

4) Lynne Stewart's freedom of speech

Review editor's comments at
FOCI panel: 'totally unsound'
I went to the Forum on Contemporary
Issues discussion on a living-wage last
Thursday, and I found the arguments of
one of the speakers, Joe 1 ondsdale, editor
in chief of the Stanford Review, totally un
sound. Londsdale opposes a living-wage
policy of any sort for two reasons: 1) In
creasing wages will take away workers' in
centive to better educate themselves, im
prove their skills and move up the social
ladder, and 2) Policies aimed at income re
distribution, such as a living-wage policy,
are socialist in nature and should not be
practiced in the capitalist United States.
These are not reasons for not imple
menting a living-wage policy. First, il is ex
tremely doubtful that making two more
bucks an hour will really remove the in
centive fora worker to advance his or her
position. Does il sound the slightest bit
plausible that a worker who initially feels
discontent with her status quo and plans on
taking some courses from a community
college will at once become wholly satisfied
with her life and not feel the urge to attend
school any more because of the extra $50
or $60 she can make in a week with the im
plementation of a living-wage policy?
Londsdale wants more educational pro
grams for workers. That's great, but these
programs are not substitutes for the basic
necessities that workers desperately need
for themselves and their children. Besides,
even raising the overall educational level of
the population is not going toeradicate low
skilled jobs. We as a society always require

people to collect the garbage on the street
regardless of how well educated our fellow
citi/ens are. Underdeveloped countries
need garbage collectors; developing coun
tries need garbage collectors; the U.S.,
highly developed as ii is, also ueecls garbage
collectors. If any member of the society is
deprived of access to enough basic nec essi
ties because his or her job does not require
a lot of skills and professional training, that
is just plain wrong and unfair.
Secondly, the claim that a living-wage
policy would be socialist and thus should
not be practiced in the capitalist United
States is a nonsensical claim. Laissez-faire
| practices are] never meant to allow ex
ploitation of workers, just as freedom of
speech is never meant to allow defamatory
remarks. 1 don't see how a living-wage pol
icy breaks the frame of capitalism, since it is
no more than a tool by which workers are
provided with a financial safety net. A liv
ing-wage policy is not a rule intentionally
set up to intervene in the business ac tivities
of companies. And even if a living-wage
policy is indeed socialist, so what? We citi
zens establish whatever system we need to
help everyone lead a better life. It is the sys
tem that is subject to what we want to do
and what we want to achieve, not the other
way around. If "socialism," defined by
I ondsdaleasa system that permits a living
wage policy, does make people better off,
then so be it. I will get in touch with |U.S.
President | George W. Bush tomorrow and
tell him that the U.S. should be called "a so

Men's wafer polo coverage lacking
I have been disappointed with the lack
of actual sports coverage in I lie Daily's
sports section of late, especially concern
ing men's water polo. There has been vir
tually no mention of the team in the past
few weeks, despite the fact that men's
water polo is ranked number one in the
nation. I realize, though, that it is impera
tive to devote a certain amount of column
space to the editorials and opinions of
columnists such as Spencer Porter, Mac
Levincand Ryan Stewart. Porter's summa
tion of his past love life; Levine's glorifica
tion of beer pong tournaments at SAE;
Stewart's proclamation that he should be
the head football coach — these are all ex
tremely important contributions that be
long in The Daily, and it would be a traves
ty if the Stanford community wasn't able to
be enlightened by these columns.
Despite the necessity of the aforemen
tioned columns, seeing as men's water polo
is a varsity sport, like field hockey, football
and women's volleyball, I don't think it is
too much to ask fora summary of the pre
vious week's games, or, failing that, a single
line reporting the score. 1 don't think that 1
am requesting anything unreasonable. 1
simply believe that everyone, from colum

Defending Spencer Porter
In response to Wednesday's letter to
the editor from Brandon Reavis ("Sports
column is'deeply offensive' "), I must offer
a defense of Spencer Porter's work. I feel
that that column, although not a journalis
tic masterpiece by any stretch, was com
pletely misunderstood.
First of all, the claim that Porter's col
umn "displays a chauvinistic attitude to
ward women's sports and a mistaken im
pression that the field hockey team would
actually date him" is absurd. I don't think
the gender of the athletes in question was
a major factor in Porter's choice of the
break-up metaphor or the"I ligh fidelity"
reference. I could just as easily see a male
columnist with a similar writing style make
the same comparison when discussing a
male sports team; the intended humor in
no way depends on the athletes being
women. The column was not trying to
imply that the members of the field hoc k
ey team "would actually date him" and to
discuss that scenario is just an unwarrant
ed personal attack on the columnist. To
characterize the column as male c hauvin
ism is just an overeager attempt to invoke
the taboo of political incorrectness.
Also, I think we all know that The Daily
is not having its doors knocked down by
throngs of ambitious young journalists
vying fora spot on the writing staff, as evi
denced by the perpetual presence of ads
looking for writers. The claim that there
are "hundreds" on this campus with the
proper devotion to the sport of field hock
ey is a bit optimistic. I mean no disrespect
to the field hockey team by saying this; I

have the utmost respect and appreciation
lor them as a quality varsity sport on c am
pus. However, it's clear that The Daily is
desperate enough tor heat writers to hire a
licit I hockey novice such as Porter. Reavis
says that he himself is able to give a damn
about Field lux key, so until I see his name
in the byline of a field lux key article, he has
no right to complain.
Porter's column did border on inappro
priate (Okay, it c rossed over that border a
little bit), but ii was self-deprecating more
than anything else; he showed a lot more
contempt lor himself than for the sport of
lield hockey in the course of his fiOO-or-so
words. If anything, the only thing 1 found
truly objectionable in Porter's column was
the fact that he quoted a member ol the
team by name, apparently without her per
mission. Otherwise, though, the com
plaints Reavis voiced in his letter were
reading way too far between the lines of
Porter's column, and he shouldn't be com
plaining about the lack of proper field
hockey coverage in I lie Daily unless he
wants to do something about it.

advocating directed violence for social

tract it last Monday, when she came to
speak, she refused to.
2) I lie petition that was circulated in
cluded the signatures of quite a few stu

partment, including myself , the author of
the petition. I give an evening each week
to the VAl' program, translating for immi

H) I here are key distinctions between

4) Lynne Stewart's freedom of speech
was never abridged. She came here to

Review editor's comments at
FOCI panel: 'totally unsound'
I went to the Forum on Contemporary
Issues discussion on a living-wage last
Thursday, and I found the arguments of
one of the speakers, Joe 1 ondsdale, editor
in chief of the Stanford Review, totally un
sound. Londsdale opposes a living-wage
policy of any sort for two reasons: 1) In
creasing wages will take away workers' in
centive to better educate themselves, im
prove their skills and move up the social
ladder, and 2) Policies aimed at income re
distribution, such as a living-wage policy,
are socialist in nature and should not be
practiced in the capitalist United States.
These are not reasons for not imple
menting a living-wage policy. First, il is ex
tremely doubtful that making two more
bucks an hour will really remove the in
centive fora worker to advance his or her
position. Does il sound the slightest bit
plausible that a worker who initially feels
discontent with her status quo and plans on
taking some courses from a community
college will at once become wholly satisfied
with her life and not feel the urge to attend
school any more because of the extra $50
or $60 she can make in a week with the im
plementation of a living-wage policy?
Londsdale wants more educational pro
grams for workers. That's great, but these
programs are not substitutes for the basic
necessities that workers desperately need
for themselves and their children. Besides,
even raising the overall educational level of
the population is not going toeradicate low
skilled jobs. We as a society always require

people to collect the garbage on the street
regardless of how well educated our fellow
citi/ens are. Underdeveloped countries
need garbage collectors; developing coun
tries need garbage collectors; the U.S.,
highly developed as ii is, also ueecls garbage
collectors. If any member of the society is
deprived of access to enough basic nec essi
ties because his or her job does not require
a lot of skills and professional training, that
is just plain wrong and unfair.
Secondly, the claim that a living-wage
policy would be socialist and thus should
not be practiced in the capitalist United
States is a nonsensical claim. Laissez-faire
| practices are] never meant to allow ex
ploitation of workers, just as freedom of
speech is never meant to allow defamatory
remarks. 1 don't see how a living-wage pol
icy breaks the frame of capitalism, since it is
no more than a tool by which workers are
provided with a financial safety net. A liv
ing-wage policy is not a rule intentionally
set up to intervene in the business ac tivities
of companies. And even if a living-wage
policy is indeed socialist, so what? We citi
zens establish whatever system we need to
help everyone lead a better life. It is the sys
tem that is subject to what we want to do
and what we want to achieve, not the other
way around. If "socialism," defined by
I ondsdaleasa system that permits a living
wage policy, does make people better off,
then so be it. I will get in touch with |U.S.

tell him that the U.S. should be called "a so

Men's wafer polo coverage lacking
I have been disappointed with the lack
of actual sports coverage in I lie Daily's
sports section of late, especially concern
ing men's water polo. There has been vir
tually no mention of the team in the past
few weeks, despite the fact that men's
water polo is ranked number one in the
nation. I realize, though, that it is impera
tive to devote a certain amount of column
space to the editorials and opinions of
columnists such as Spencer Porter, Mac
Levincand Ryan Stewart. Porter's summa
tion of his past love life; Levine's glorifica
tion of beer pong tournaments at SAE;
Stewart's proclamation that he should be
the head football coach — these are all ex
tremely important contributions that be
long in The Daily, and it would be a traves
ty if the Stanford community wasn't able to
be enlightened by these columns.
Despite the necessity of the aforemen
tioned columns, seeing as men's water polo
is a varsity sport, like field hockey, football
and women's volleyball, I don't think it is
too much to ask fora summary of the pre
vious week's games, or, failing that, a single
line reporting the score. 1 don't think that 1
am requesting anything unreasonable. 1
simply believe that everyone, from colum

Defending Spencer Porter
In response to Wednesday's letter to
the editor from Brandon Reavis ("Sports
column is'deeply offensive' "), I must offer
a defense of Spencer Porter's work. I feel
that that column, although not a journalis
tic masterpiece by any stretch, was com
pletely misunderstood.
First of all, the claim that Porter's col
umn "displays a chauvinistic attitude to
ward women's sports and a mistaken im
pression that the field hockey team would
actually date him" is absurd. I don't think
the gender of the athletes in question was
a major factor in Porter's choice of the
break-up metaphor or the"I ligh fidelity"
reference. I could just as easily see a male
columnist with a similar writing style make
the same comparison when discussing a
male sports team; the intended humor in
no way depends on the athletes being
women. The column was not trying to
imply that the members of the field hoc k
ey team "would actually date him" and to
discuss that scenario is just an unwarrant
ed personal attack on the columnist. To
characterize the column as male c hauvin
ism is just an overeager attempt to invoke
the taboo of political incorrectness.
Also, I think we all know that The Daily
is not having its doors knocked down by
throngs of ambitious young journalists
vying fora spot on the writing staff, as evi
denced by the perpetual presence of ads
looking for writers. The claim that there
are "hundreds" on this campus with the
proper devotion to the sport of field hock
ey is a bit optimistic. I mean no disrespect
to the field hockey team by saying this; I

have the utmost respect and appreciation
lor them as a quality varsity sport on c am
pus. However, it's clear that The Daily is
desperate enough tor heat writers to hire a
licit I hockey novice such as Porter. Reavis
says that he himself is able to give a damn
about Field lux key, so until I see his name
in the byline of a field lux key article, he has
no right to complain.
Porter's column did border on inappro
priate (Okay, it c rossed over that border a
little bit), but ii was self-deprecating more
than anything else; he showed a lot more
contempt lor himself than for the sport of
lield hockey in the course of his fiOO-or-so
words. If anything, the only thing 1 found
truly objectionable in Porter's column was
the fact that he quoted a member ol the
team by name, apparently without her per
mission. Otherwise, though, the com
plaints Reavis voiced in his letter were
reading way too far between the lines of
Porter's column, and he shouldn't be com
plaining about the lack of proper field
hockey coverage in I lie Daily unless he
wants to do something about it.

MEChA supports black community's
campaign for more space
The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan ( MEChA) supports the numer
ous actions the Black Student Union and
the black community are taking to address
the extremely limited space of the Black
Community Services Center. MEChA rec
ognizes the grave importance of adequate
community center space. El Centro C.lii
cano houses more than 15 ('.hie ana / oand
Latina/o organizations that use its re
sources and space on a daily basis. We do
not take this space for granted; it serves
many purposes and provides a comfort
able place that allows students to build a
strongsense of community. Such a space is
necessary for the growth of a community.
As of now, some organizations from the
black community must hold meetings in
El Centro Chicano because of the lack of

space in the current BCSC. El Centro Chi
cano gladly offers its space to other com
munities, but the fact is that each commu
nity needs a separate, individual space to
call its own. This is why MEChA under
stands the importance of a bigger and bet
ter black house and also considers this an
issue that should be addressed by the ad
ministration now.
The issue of more space for the black
community is not a recent demand. It
should be made clear that this issue had al
ready been presented to the administra
tion, which simply chose to stall the obvi
ous problem by ignoring it as long as pos
sible. The moment of accountability to this
community has come. Now is the time to
address the question of why Stanford
boasts its largest incoming class of African-
American students, but ironically refuses
to allocate more space to the BCSC.
Stanford flaunts this diversity, but
when it really counts, it refuses to follow
through on its commitment to diversity
on campus.
Another important point to make is
that most of the recruitment of students
from diverse backgrounds comes from the
community centers. The community cen
ters' recruitment programs during Admit
Weekend are often what attract students
of different ethnicities lo Stanford. These
community centers have limited funding,
are understaffed (most have two or fewer
full-time employees) and depend on stu
dents to run and plan events. The stu
dents who work and volunteer to keep
these centers alive often sacrifice grades
and academic work to support their com

Review editor's comments at
FOCI panel: 'totally unsound'
I went to the Forum on Contemporary
Issues discussion on a living-wage last
Thursday, and I found the arguments of
one of the speakers, Joe 1 ondsdale, editor
in chief of the Stanford Review, totally un
sound. Londsdale opposes a living-wage
policy of any sort for two reasons: 1) In
creasing wages will take away workers' in
centive to better educate themselves, im
prove their skills and move up the social
ladder, and 2) Policies aimed at income re
distribution, such as a living-wage policy,
are socialist in nature and should not be
practiced in the capitalist United States.
These are not reasons for not imple
menting a living-wage policy. First, il is ex
tremely doubtful that making two more
bucks an hour will really remove the in
centive fora worker to advance his or her
position. Does il sound the slightest bit
plausible that a worker who initially feels
discontent with her status quo and plans on
taking some courses from a community
college will at once become wholly satisfied
with her life and not feel the urge to attend
school any more because of the extra $50
or $60 she can make in a week with the im
plementation of a living-wage policy?
Londsdale wants more educational pro
grams for workers. That's great, but these
programs are not substitutes for the basic
necessities that workers desperately need
for themselves and their children. Besides,
even raising the overall educational level of
the population is not going toeradicate low
skilled jobs. We as a society always require

people to collect the garbage on the street
regardless of how well educated our fellow
citi/ens are. Underdeveloped countries
need garbage collectors; developing coun
tries need garbage collectors; the U.S.,
highly developed as ii is, also ueecls garbage
collectors. If any member of the society is
deprived of access to enough basic nec essi
ties because his or her job does not require
a lot of skills and professional training, that
is just plain wrong and unfair.
Secondly, the claim that a living-wage
policy would be socialist and thus should
not be practiced in the capitalist United
States is a nonsensical claim. Laissez-faire
| practices are] never meant to allow ex
ploitation of workers, just as freedom of
speech is never meant to allow defamatory
remarks. 1 don't see how a living-wage pol
icy breaks the frame of capitalism, since it is
no more than a tool by which workers are
provided with a financial safety net. A liv
ing-wage policy is not a rule intentionally
set up to intervene in the business ac tivities
of companies. And even if a living-wage
policy is indeed socialist, so what? We citi
zens establish whatever system we need to
help everyone lead a better life. It is the sys
tem that is subject to what we want to do
and what we want to achieve, not the other
way around. If "socialism," defined by
I ondsdaleasa system that permits a living
wage policy, does make people better off,
then so be it. I will get in touch with |U.S.
President | George W. Bush tomorrow and
tell him that the U.S. should be called "a so
cialist state"from now on.

Men's wafer polo coverage lacking
I have been disappointed with the lack
of actual sports coverage in I lie Daily's
sports section of late, especially concern
ing men's water polo. There has been vir
tually no mention of the team in the past
few weeks, despite the fact that men's
water polo is ranked number one in the
nation. I realize, though, that it is impera
tive to devote a certain amount of column
space to the editorials and opinions of
columnists such as Spencer Porter, Mac
Levincand Ryan Stewart. Porter's summa
tion of his past love life; Levine's glorifica
tion of beer pong tournaments at SAE;
Stewart's proclamation that he should be
the head football coach — these are all ex
tremely important contributions that be
long in The Daily, and it would be a traves
ty if the Stanford community wasn't able to
be enlightened by these columns.
Despite the necessity of the aforemen
tioned columns, seeing as men's water polo
is a varsity sport, like field hockey, football
and women's volleyball, I don't think it is
too much to ask fora summary of the pre
vious week's games, or, failing that, a single
line reporting the score. 1 don't think that 1
am requesting anything unreasonable. 1
simply believe that everyone, from colum
nists to varsity teams, deserves their fair
share of coverage in the sports section.

Defending Spencer Porter
In response to Wednesday's letter to
the editor from Brandon Reavis ("Sports
column is'deeply offensive' "), I must offer
a defense of Spencer Porter's work. I feel
that that column, although not a journalis
tic masterpiece by any stretch, was com
pletely misunderstood.
First of all, the claim that Porter's col
umn "displays a chauvinistic attitude to
ward women's sports and a mistaken im
pression that the field hockey team would
actually date him" is absurd. I don't think
the gender of the athletes in question was
a major factor in Porter's choice of the
break-up metaphor or the"I ligh fidelity"
reference. I could just as easily see a male
columnist with a similar writing style make
the same comparison when discussing a
male sports team; the intended humor in
no way depends on the athletes being
women. The column was not trying to
imply that the members of the field hoc k
ey team "would actually date him" and to
discuss that scenario is just an unwarrant
ed personal attack on the columnist. To
characterize the column as male c hauvin
ism is just an overeager attempt to invoke
the taboo of political incorrectness.
Also, I think we all know that The Daily
is not having its doors knocked down by
throngs of ambitious young journalists
vying fora spot on the writing staff, as evi
denced by the perpetual presence of ads
looking for writers. The claim that there
are "hundreds" on this campus with the
proper devotion to the sport of field hock
ey is a bit optimistic. I mean no disrespect
to the field hockey team by saying this; I

have the utmost respect and appreciation
lor them as a quality varsity sport on c am
pus. However, it's clear that The Daily is
desperate enough tor heat writers to hire a
licit I hockey novice such as Porter. Reavis
says that he himself is able to give a damn
about Field lux key, so until I see his name
in the byline of a field lux key article, he has
no right to complain.
Porter's column did border on inappro
priate (Okay, it c rossed over that border a
little bit), but ii was self-deprecating more
than anything else; he showed a lot more
contempt lor himself than for the sport of
lield hockey in the course of his fiOO-or-so
words. If anything, the only thing 1 found
truly objectionable in Porter's column was
the fact that he quoted a member ol the
team by name, apparently without her per
mission. Otherwise, though, the com
plaints Reavis voiced in his letter were
reading way too far between the lines of
Porter's column, and he shouldn't be com
plaining about the lack of proper field
hockey coverage in I lie Daily unless he
wants to do something about it.

989 Sports ad 'poisons' Daily
Reading The Daily, I caught an adver
tisement on the back page for 989 Sports'
NCAA Gamebreaker game. It pro
claimed that Cal is number one, based on
a recent "videogame poll." 1 (eel that this
is a terrible mistake because a) it is Big
Game week, and b) Gal absolutely blows.
I hope 989 Sports' stock plummets, and
they have to file Chapter 11. EA's NCAA
Football 2003 is a much better game any
way. I enjoy The Daily, and I want to
keep reading it without having my eyes
poisoned by anything that praises that
miserable school. After all, if there is a

MEChA supports black community's
campaign for more space
The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan ( MEChA) supports the numer
ous actions the Black Student Union and
the black community are taking to address
the extremely limited space of the Black
Community Services Center. MEChA rec
ognizes the grave importance of adequate
community center space. El Centro C.lii
cano houses more than 15 ('.hie ana / oand
Latina/o organizations that use its re
sources and space on a daily basis. We do
not take this space for granted; it serves
many purposes and provides a comfort
able place that allows students to build a
strongsense of community. Such a space is
necessary for the growth of a community.
As of now, some organizations from the
black community must hold meetings in
El Centro Chicano because of the lack of

space in the current BCSC. El Centro Chi
cano gladly offers its space to other com
munities, but the fact is that each commu
nity needs a separate, individual space to
call its own. This is why MEChA under
stands the importance of a bigger and bet
ter black house and also considers this an
issue that should be addressed by the ad
ministration now.
The issue of more space for the black
community is not a recent demand. It
should be made clear that this issue had al
ready been presented to the administra
tion, which simply chose to stall the obvi
ous problem by ignoring it as long as pos
sible. The moment of accountability to this
community has come. Now is the time to
address the question of why Stanford
boasts its largest incoming class of African-
American students, but ironically refuses
to allocate more space to the BCSC.
Stanford flaunts this diversity, but
when it really counts, it refuses to follow
through on its commitment to diversity
on campus.
Another important point to make is
that most of the recruitment of students
from diverse backgrounds comes from the
community centers. The community cen
ters' recruitment programs during Admit
Weekend are often what attract students
of different ethnicities lo Stanford. These
community centers have limited funding,
are understaffed (most have two or fewer
full-time employees) and depend on stu
dents to run and plan events. The stu
dents who work and volunteer to keep
these centers alive often sacrifice grades
and academic work to support their com
munities. The least Stanford c an do is sup
port the BCSC wilh a bigger and better
space — one that can house the numerous
organizations under the BCSC umbrella
and is located centrally on campus.
MEChA supports the BSU and urges

Stanford to respond to the black commu
nity's demands.

Stewart's freedom of speech
was 'never abridged'
I'lease ( heck your facts before you write
an editorial:
1) Lynne Stewart said her quote on
Sept. 1 1 was taken out of context. She
never said the same thing about her quote
advocating directed violence for social
change in the two instances she spoke at
(he Law School. When I asked her to re
tract it last Monday, when she came to
speak, she refused to.
2) I lie petition that was circulated in
cluded the signatures of quite a few stu
dents involved in the public interest de
partment, including myself , the author of
the petition. I give an evening each week
to the VAl' program, translating for immi
grant families. 1 here were many others
who were involved in the public interest
department who signed the petition.
H) I here are key distinctions between
war waged by our elected officials and
achieving domestic political aims through
violence.
4) Lynne Stewart's freedom of speech
was never abridged. She came here to
speak on the weekend of Nov. 9-10 and in
formally mentored students on Nov. 12.
Her being honored was all that was
abridged. Universities should let all air
