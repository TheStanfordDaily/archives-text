## Gaieties and an upcoming concert build excitement about Saturday's game against Cal 
### KATIE LINGRAS 
Students coming back from tomorrow's
Big Game will certainly have a place to con
tinue their excitement this year. In addition to
the traditional Gaieties performances build
ing up excitement throughout the week, hip
hop artists Nappy Roots will be performing
for Stanford students in Memorial Auditori
um tomorrow night at 8 p.m.
Nappy Roots will be touring to support
their platinum album, "Watermelon, Chicken
and Grit/.." Senior Eric Blackerby, director of
the Stanford Concert Network, said that, al
though SCN considered 60 or 70 artists,
Nappy Roots was the best option.
"We were lucky enough to have them be
excited to perform at Stanford, and we decid
ed that they would be a great fit for the Stan
ford students," Blackerby said.
According to Blackerby, student tickets
have been selling extremely well and will soon
be sold out. Tickets were on sale this week in
White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m., and at the
Stanford Ticket Office, located on the ground
floor of Tresidder, as well as through Tick
ets.com. Blackerby said that though tickets
are still available, only 1,200 seats were re
served at the student price of $ 18. The other
500 seats in Memorial Auditorium will cost
$25, the general admission price.
Blackerby said that the student response
thus far has been very positive.
"When we first broke the show, people
didn't even believe that Nappy R<x>ts was really
coming," he said. "I got people stopping me to
give me hugs and say 'I ain't believe [Nappy
R(X)tsJ is coming to Stanford!' This is the biggest
name in hip hop ever to play at Stanford, so stu
dents are really excited about the show."
According to Blackerby, although there
was a musical performance during Big Game
weekend last year, it was not advertised as a
Big Game show. He attributed the excitement
about this weekend's show, and about SCN it
self, to the expansion of the CoHo Series,
weekly listening parties and the increased
quality of all its shows.

Blackerby also said that lie believes that the
Big Game spirit and the enthusiasm about the
concert will remain una fleeted by speculation
of a UC-Berkeley Big Game victory.
"If students are more excited about the
concert than the game, then it can only help
the concert," he stated. "I lowever, I'd love to
see the football team prove everyone wrong
and beat Cal. Then the concert would be even
better because everyone would be even more
excited."
Several events have occurred around cam
pus this week to increase Big Game spirit, the
most famous being Big Game Gaieties, per
formed by Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest and
largest student-run theatrical organization.
Gaieties will hold its final sold-out perfor
mance tonight in Memorial Auditorium, after
two well-received performances on Wednes
day and Thursday evenings.
This year's theme was"The Quadfather."
Director Maya Powell said that Gaieties is
about "Stanford triumphing over Cal. . . but
also about laughing at ourselves and bringing
the Stanford community together with spirit."
Overall, students seemed to appreciate
these efforts. Junior Erinn Evans said that this
year's show was a success.
"The subtle yet painfully obvious references
to aspects of the University were better than
previous years," Evans said. "The Axis (Axess)
of Evil was really clever, and the students acting
as certain administrators (particularly Robin
Mamlet) was really well done. I thought the
characters — the Godfather, Jesus, Joey
Lawrence, Tupac, etc. — were just so original
and relevant to our college humor. It was also
cunningly offensive — very well done."
Senior Alyson Thomas also appreciated
the jokes in the show.
"1 thought there were a lot more funny
parts than there usually are, but I thought
that the parts making fun of Stanford were
funnier than the parts making fun of Cal,"
Thomas said.
Some students, however, were a bit disap
pointed with the performance. Transfer stu
dent and junior Jorge Caballero found that
Gaieties did not live up to his expectations.
"As a new student, I was made to believe
that it was going to be a lot better than it ac
tually was, so to a certain extent, I feel dis
appointed," Caballero stated. "It was enter
taining, but at the same time it lagged at

some points.
Despite the mixed reactions, Powch says
that ticket sales went well, but feels that there
was some spirit lacking this year.
"Thursday sales have been unusually
slow this year, and as a whole, I have noticed
tli.it tilt' Big Game spirit has been down as
compared to other years," Powch said. "Fri
day always sells out thanks to dorm block
sales, while Wednesday (opening night)
usually is the* weakest in sales. But this year
we had a great Senior Night audience [on
Wednesday]."
Tickets were sold through dorms and to
the public for $9 for students and $15 for
general audience members. According to
Powch, there are a few seats left for tonight's
show at 7:30 p.m., and tickets can be pur
chased at the door.
A final component to Big Game weekend is
the Bus B;ick the Axe program, sponsored by
Stanford Student Enterprises. Bus Back the
Axe provides transportation to and from
Berkeley, so that attending Big Game is as
convenient as possible for Stanford students.
According to Connor Kidd, the manager
of Bus Back the Axe, students previously ex
pressed a need for transportation by renting
buses themselves. 1 iowever, SSE saw the need
and stepped in.
"SSE is always looking to the behavior of
the students to see where there might be
unmet demand," Kidd said. "We have the re
sources to provide 'wholesale prices' to stu
dents and improve the convenience of rent
ing the a bus by doing it on a much larger scale
than an individual dorm."
Students were able to purchase tickets
through their resident assistants either indi
vidually or as a whole dorm. Next, students
simply show up at their assigned pick-up loca
tion, where they will be provided with break
fast and water as they ride to Big Game.
T his year, SSE will be running 17 buses to
and from Berkeley. Kidd said that this service
is an important one, especially for freshman.
"I think it is important because it provides
freshman with an opportunity to go to Big
Game, which would be otherwise difficult
since they are not allowed to have cars on cam
pus," Kidd said.
T his year, Kidd predicted that about 750
students will get to Big Game using the Bus
Back the Axe service.
