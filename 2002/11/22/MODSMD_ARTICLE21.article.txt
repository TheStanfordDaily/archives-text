women's soccer team is headed lor the Sweet 1(>. And
tor the second time in the last four years, the Cardi
nal's Sweet 10 opponent is Notre Dame.

Women's Soccer
vs. Notre Dame, Saturday, 7:00 p.m., NCAA Third Round

After taking care ofCal Poly 4-0 in the first round
last Friday and sneaking past California 1-0 in over
time Sunday afternoon, the Cardinal heads into Sat
urday's game with a healthy squad focused on the
next step of this season's journey.
Stanford has faced Notre Dame six times in the
program's history, with the Irish holding a 4-2 series
edge. Notre Dame has taken the last four meetings,
which included a matchup in the third round of the
1999 NCAA tournament.
However, in postseason elimination soccer, it
seems that statistical references to the past are ren
dered more or less meaningless. ,
"In knockout soccer, you just take each game as it
comes," said Stanford co-coach Paul Sapsford.
leaking each game one at a time has yet to be a
problem for this year's Stanford squad. After running
through the regular season with an 18-1-0 record —
including a perfect 9-0-0 mark in the tough Pacific-10
Conference — and taking the top seed in the NCAA
tournament, the Cardinal raised expectations that

were alreach high to si ait the year. So is lliere any
danger that the team will begin looking toward a trip
to Austin for the College Clip, soccer's Final Four, a
game or two early?
"'Finn's not been a problem," Sapsfbrd said. "The
level of practice has been brilliant. And thai just goes
to show how goal-oriented this team is. We take one
game at a lime. What happened yesterday has been
and gone. The focus is always on today. That's exact
ly what takes team to big games."
So for now the locus remains on the Irish and Sat
urday night's contest at 7:00 p.m. at Maloney Field.
File game comes less than a week after the emotional
overtime win over c ross-Bay rival California, which
was sent home lor the winter by senior Allyson Mar
quand's golden goal.
That early-round scare seems to have only helped
to motivate the team more for this weekend's game.
"Struggling with the win put us a little c loser to re
alizing what it might feel like to not have our season
continue," said junior defender Natalie Spilger after
the Cal game. "And I think that will give us an edge
for the next game because 1 know I don't want to feel
that again."
While last weekend's games pitted the Cardinal
against familiar local foes, this weekend's opponent
brings in more unknowns as the teams have not faced
each other since 2000. But co-coach Stephanie Erick
son wasn't concerned about that adding any difficul
ties to Stanford's preparations.
