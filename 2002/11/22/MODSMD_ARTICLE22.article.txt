# Volleyball may be without Tom for Cal match
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford-California rivalry has never really
spilled over onto the volleyball court — the Cardinal
women haven't lost to the Bears in over 20 years, and
Cal flpesn't even have a men's team.

But with some important NCAA tournament im

tween No. 4 Stanford (25-4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) and Cal (18-10, 7-10) at Berkeley could change

player was in the lineup.

Tom and Cal sophomore Mia Jerkov, potentially ihe
Bears' first Ail-American since 1983, are both ques

Tom, Stanford's kill and dig leader, injured her
thumb in Stanford's 3-1 loss to No. 13 Washington
State on Saturday. Tests came back negative, but Tom
has been limited in practice and may not see much ac
tion tonight — though she could be used as a libero,
with senior Lindsey Yamasaki taking her outside hit
ter spot.
Jerkov, the Pac-10 kill leader, sprained her ankle
in practice on Monday, forcing her to sit out Cal's 3-2
upset of No. 11 Santa Clara on Tuesday.
Both injuries could complicate each team's prepa
rations for tonight's contest.
"They have to prepare for us with Logan and with
out Logan, and we have to do the same [with regards
to Jerkov]," Stanford coach John Dunning said.
"[Jerkov] hurt one ankle and was out a longtime, and
she hurt the other one this week. If she's at full
strength, then, boy, good for her. She's tough. But we

have to prepare both ways."
The Bears have a good shot at
their first NCAA tournament bid
since 1989. A win over Stanford in
tonight's Pac-10 finale would basi
cally guarantee that Cal would
have a spot in the NCAA brackets
released on Dec. 2.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, will
be looking to bolster its hopes of
receiving one of the top four seeds
for the tournament, which would
make Stanford a regional host.
Those chances took a blow on Sat
urday when Stanford, playing its
seventh match against a ranked
opponent in 15 days, fell to No. 13
Washington State in Pullman.
That loss snapped a 10-match
winning streak for the Cardinal,
which included wins over No. 1
Southern California and then-
No. 1 Hawaii on the road. It also
effectively sealed the Pac-10 title
for the Trojans, who have a
game-and-a-half lead over Stan
ford heading into the final week
end of play.
"We all want to know if we're in
the tournament, and what posi
tion we're in and where we're play
ing, but that's just wondering,"
Dunning said. "We're not going to
win the Pac-10, but we want to fin
ish well in the Pac-10. Santa Clara

(Stanford's opponent on Tuesday)
is still ranked high, so we've got a
couple of tough matches ahead of
us before the tournament. We're
focused on those."
If Jerkov is out of the lineup,
the Stanford blockers may focus
on outside hitter Leah Young,
who put up a career-high 29 kills
in Tuesday's upset of the Broncos.
Cal will need to find a way to
slow the Stanford attack — with or
without Tom. Junior middle
blocker Sara McGee, who is sec
ond behind junior teammate Jenn
Harvey in the Pac-10 in blocks,
leads the conference with a .411
hitting percentage. And sopho
more outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani has been warming up lately,
boosting her average to 3.71 kills
per game.
More than anything, the Cardi
nal will be looking to get its engines
firing again after a three-day break
following the long road trip to
Washington last weekend. The
days oil have helped the team re
cover from the sickness and in
juries that had caught up with the
squad during its brutal early-No
vember schedule.
"Everyone's getting better at
just the right time," freshman
libero Courtney Schultz said.
"Logan doesn't seem to be at full
strength yet, but she's so tough
that nothing can keep her out of
competition. It feels like we'll be at
full strength in the near future."

tonight's Pac-10 finale would basi
cally guarantee that Cal would
have a spot in the NCAA brackets
released on Dec. 2.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, will
be looking to bolster its hopes of
receiving one of the top four seeds
for the tournament, which would
make Stanford a regional host.
Those chances took a blow on Sat
urday when Stanford, playing its
seventh match against a ranked
opponent in 15 days, fell to No. 13
Washington State in Pullman.
That loss snapped a 10-match
winning streak for the Cardinal,
which included wins over No. 1
Southern California and then-
No. 1 Hawaii on the road. It also
effectively sealed the Pac-10 title
for the Trojans, who have a
game-and-a-half lead over Stan
ford heading into the final week
end of play.
"We all want to know if we're in
the tournament, and what posi
tion we're in and where we're play
ing, but that's just wondering,"
Dunning said. "We're not going to
win the Pac-10, but we want to fin
ish well in the Pac-10. Santa Clara

(Stanford's opponent on Tuesday)
is still ranked high, so we've got a
couple of tough matches ahead of
us before the tournament. We're
focused on those."
If Jerkov is out of the lineup,
the Stanford blockers may focus
on outside hitter Leah Young,
who put up a career-high 29 kills
in Tuesday's upset of the Broncos.
Cal will need to find a way to
slow the Stanford attack — with or
without Tom. Junior middle
blocker Sara McGee, who is sec
ond behind junior teammate Jenn
Harvey in the Pac-10 in blocks,
leads the conference with a .411
hitting percentage. And sopho
more outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani has been warming up lately,
boosting her average to 3.71 kills
per game.
More than anything, the Cardi
nal will be looking to get its engines
firing again after a three-day break
following the long road trip to
Washington last weekend. The
days oil have helped the team re
cover from the sickness and in
juries that had caught up with the
squad during its brutal early-No
vember schedule.
"Everyone's getting better at
just the right time," freshman
libero Courtney Schultz said.
"Logan doesn't seem to be at full
strength yet, but she's so tough
that nothing can keep her out of
competition. It feels like we'll be at
full strength in the near future."
The Stanford-California rivalry has never really
spilled over onto the volleyball court — the Cardinal
women haven't lost to the Bears in over 20 years, and
Cal flpesn't even have a men's team.

But with some important NCAA tournament im
plications going along with it, tonight's match be
tween No. 4 Stanford (25-4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) and Cal (18-10, 7-10) at Berkeley could change
that — although it would help if each team's marquee
player was in the lineup.
Stanford senior Ail-American outside hitter Logan
Tom and Cal sophomore Mia Jerkov, potentially ihe
Bears' first Ail-American since 1983, are both ques
tionable for tonight's match.
Tom, Stanford's kill and dig leader, injured her
thumb in Stanford's 3-1 loss to No. 13 Washington
State on Saturday. Tests came back negative, but Tom
has been limited in practice and may not see much ac
tion tonight — though she could be used as a libero,
with senior Lindsey Yamasaki taking her outside hit
ter spot.
Jerkov, the Pac-10 kill leader, sprained her ankle
in practice on Monday, forcing her to sit out Cal's 3-2
upset of No. 11 Santa Clara on Tuesday.
Both injuries could complicate each team's prepa
rations for tonight's contest.
"They have to prepare for us with Logan and with
out Logan, and we have to do the same [with regards
to Jerkov]," Stanford coach John Dunning said.
"[Jerkov] hurt one ankle and was out a longtime, and
she hurt the other one this week. If she's at full
strength, then, boy, good for her. She's tough. But we
