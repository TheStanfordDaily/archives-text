# Point guard Clare Bodensteiner is a...
## Fearless Frosh

When reserve point guard Clare Bo
densteiner enters tonight's season-open
ing game against Rutgers from the bench,
it will mark her first baby steps in the
world of college basketball. But don't ex
pect to see a stereotypical knee-knocked,
panic-stricken freshman out on the court
for the No. 5 Cardinal.
Bodensteiner has got a bit of an edge to
her mentality, and to her game.
"If you show any kind of intimidation,
you get eaten up," said the 5-foot-9 first
year player. "The game's a lot different,
but it's still played with an orange ball
and hoop."
This sort of nonchalant, take-nothing
from-nobody attitude probably stems
from her roots. Bodensteiner grew up in
the small town of Rupert, Idaho (popula
tion approximately (>,OOO, with one stop
light). And with the more rural, sparsely
populated environment come major chal-

lenges for an athletic: girl.
"You play basketball wit li the guys be
cause there aren't any girls tliiit wanna
play," she said. "They are so muc h more
athletic and strong, and while they
might not be the same skill-wise, they
can make up for it with strength and
quickness. So it's kind of helped my
game in that aspect."
Though Bodensteiner claims the in
creased speed of the college game has
been difficult to adjust to, she still possess
es a confidence unseen in most freshmen.
"I just wanna be an asset, and come in
there and keep the team up and going as
much as I can," she siiicl.
On a team without any seniors — or
any true leaders at that — Bodensteiner

already has taken on the part of
vocal general, something that
sophomore guard Kelley Suinins
ki can most definitely attest to.
"When I came in, 1 wasn't
vocal at all," Suminski said. "But 1
think [Bodensteiner] is doing a
better job than 1 ever did [in]
stepping up and helping us in
every aspect. It's probably what
she's used to."
Indeed, the freshman guard is
an old liiii at that leadership thing.
Bodensteiner helped orches
trate a marvelous turnaround of
her high school's basketball pro
gram. Her freshman year, Mini
co High School won only two
games. Four years later, Boden
steiner led her team to a fourth
place finish at the Idaho State
Championships.
As a senior, she averaged
20.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and
4.0 assists and was named first
team All-State. And, true to
Stanford form, she was her high
school's valedictorian.
Despite these successes, the
freshman guard never garnered
much praise from any of the na
tional recruiting magazines,
mainly because of her out-of-the
limelight locale. Conversely,
those same national publications
included fellow Stanford fresh
men Krista Rappahahn and Ezia
maka Okafor in their top-100
prospects lists.
But the Stanford coaching staff
feels they have found a diamond
in the rough, so to speak.
"I saw Clare play in a summer
league game, and I said, 'This girl
can jump,' " Cardinal coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "| But] her lead
ership was what really impressed
me. She's a really take-charge
person and is someone that gives
our team great energy."
Just as the coaches are happy
to have heron the Farm, Boden
steiner is also ecstatic to be play
ing under the tutelage of some
one like VanDerveer. The
coach's tenure at Stanford has
produced a pedigree of point
guards that has gone arguably
unmatched in all of women's col
lege basketball.
The distinguished names to

have come through Palo Alto in
the last decade and a hall
abound. Jennifer A/.zi, Sonja
Henning, Molly Coodenbour,
jamila Wideman and Milena
I<lores, among others, have all
had success under the guidance
of VanDerveer.
So these long-winded annals of
the point guard tradition beg the
question, is such greatness in the
future of Bodensteiner, too?
"I see really good things for
Clare," VanDerveer said. "I think
she's going in the right direction.
If she keeps her really positive al
titude, things will fill into place
for her."
Bodensteiner, true to her
character, seems completely com
fortable in working her way up
that illustrious ladder.
"I know it's not gonna be
easy," Bodensteiner said, "but if I
keep going at it, hopefully by the
fourth year it will pay oil."
Tonight's matchup with Rut
gers isn't exactly the optimal be
ginning for even the least-green
of freshmen, however. The Scar
let Knights boast a former na
tional high school player of the
year in sophomore point guard
Cappie Pondexter. The 5-9 ex
plosive guard sat out last year
due to NCAA initial eligibility
standards but starred on the
U.S. 20-and-under national
team this summer.
Rutgers also returns its lead
ing scorer from a year ago, se
nior guard Mauri Horton (13.0
ppg), giving the Knights a tal
ented pair that could potential
ly give Bodensteiner and the
rest of her backcourt peers
some problems.
Last January, Stanford eked
out a 50-46 victory in New
Brunswick after shooting an atro
ciously poor 31.6 percent from
the field. The Cardinal went
ahead for good midway through
the second half when then-fresh
man guard Sebnem Kimyacioglu
hit consecutive 3-pointers to open
up a four-point lead.
Also coming up this weekend
for the Cardinal is a Sunday date
with San Francisco (0-1), a 2002
VVNIL Postseason Tournament
participant. The Dons were no
match for Stanford early last
year, as Suminski poured in 23
points to lead the Cardinal to a
103-72 win.
