As the glamour of the Cardinal's surpris
ing 63-62 victory over No. 11 Xavier on
Wednesday subsides and the reality of that
accomplishment begins to set in, questions
arise as to the validity and potential of this
currently unranked Stanford team.
Ihe win can be looked at in one of two ways.
In retrospect, it's tempting to romanticize

emphatic statement to the nation that the
Cardinal-can still win the big games.

win is, it's difficult to escape images of a ner
vous Cardinal team barely escaping its first
round game against Boston University two
nights prior.

nonconference matchup against Rice on
Sunday will undoubtedly answer a few lin

it's overall mentality and its ability to re-

win] with a lot of pride — pride because we
worked hard in practice and in the offsea

"The win [against Xavier was] big lor us,"
junior guard Matt Lottie h added. "It puts us
back on the national map. We're a new team
in a new era, but we still came away with the
same result, so that's good."
Against Rice, Stanford will have the op
portunity to prove that it can show up tor all
of its games, regardless of who's lining up
against them.
"[ The Xavier] win shows the
nation that we're better than iliey
think," sophomore swingman
Josh Childress said. "Hopefully,
we can keep the momentum
going into Sunday."
The most notable player on
Rice's squad is sophomore
Michael Harris. Alter averaging

12.8 points and 8.6 rebounds per
game last season, the (>-lbot-f> for

Athletic Conference's Freshman
