The Stanford men's water polo team's
Mountain Pacific: Sports Federation sched
ule is already over, but the top-ranked Car
dinal's regular-season finale tomorrow
against No. 2 California could mean a lot
more than pride for the winner.
Granted tomorrow's Big Splash at Berke
ley will decide the regular-season series be
tween the cross-Bay rivals — Stanford took
the first meeting in mid-September, 8-7, only
to have Cal end its MPSF regular-season title
hopes with a 9-8 win at the Avery Aquatic
Center earlier this month. But tomorrow's
10:00 a.m. contest could have much larger
implications for the NCAA tournament, to be
held the first weekend in December at Loy
ola Marvmount.

Stanford and Cal finished second and
third, respectively, in the MPSF standings.
Entering next week's MPSF Tournament in
Los Alamitos, Calif., as the second and third
seeds, then, the Cardinal and the Bears
would face off in the semifinals of the tour
nament.
Only the MPSF Tournament winner gets
an automatic bid to the four-team NCAA
tournament the following weekend, mean
ing that the loser of that potential Cal-Stan
fbrd semifinal would have to hope to get the
one at-large bid to the NCAA Champi
onships.
That's where tomorrow's match comes in.
With a 20-3 record — giving
it two fewer losses than anyone
else is the MPSF — the Cardinal
is in the best position of anyone
to receive that at-large bid
should it fail to win the MPSF
title. On the other hand, Cal,
with a 16-5 mark, could use an
other win over Stanford to add
some insurance for itself should
it fall short in Los Alamitos.
Stanford will look to sophomore

Tony Azevedo, the M PSK's leading
scorer with 78 goals, and junior
Mike Derse (42 goals, eighth in the
MPSF) to give the team an offen
sive boost and to help take some ol
the pressure off the Cardinal in the
defensive end. Stanford hasn't won
a game by more than two goals in
over a month.
To break that streak, the Car
dinal will have to find a way to
beat Cal's senior goalkeeper Rus
sell Bernstein, who picked up 12
saves in the Bears' win at Avery
earlier this month. Junior Attilla
Banhidy is Cal's leading scorer
witli 43 goals.
