The Stanford men's water polo team's
Mountain Pacific: Sports Federation sched
ule is already over, but the top-ranked Car
dinal's regular-season finale tomorrow
against No. 2 California could mean a lot
more than pride for the winner.
Granted tomorrow's Big Splash at Berke
ley will decide the regular-season series be
tween the cross-Bay rivals â€” Stanford took
the first meeting in mid-September, 8-7, only
to have Cal end its MPSF regular-season title
hopes with a 9-8 win at the Avery Aquatic
Center earlier this month. But tomorrow's
10:00 a.m. contest could have much larger
implications for the NCAA tournament, to be
held the first weekend in December at Loy
ola Marvmount.

Men's Water Polo
m
at No. 2 California, Saturday, 10:00 a.m.

Stanford and Cal finished second and
third, respectively, in the MPSF standings.
Entering next week's MPSF Tournament in
Los Alamitos, Calif., as the second and third
seeds, then, the Cardinal and the Bears
would face off in the semifinals of the tour
nament.
Only the MPSF Tournament winner gets
an automatic bid to the four-team NCAA
tournament the following weekend, mean
ing that the loser of that potential Cal-Stan
fbrd semifinal would have to hope to get the
one at-large bid to the NCAA Champi
onships.
That's where tomorrow's match comes in.
