# Babin suffers the ultimate defeat
## 
### 
So there are a lot of big games
this weekend. The Broncos
face the Colts on ESPN's Sun
day Night Football. The
Avalanche has a tough draw against
St. Louis on the road. The Stanford
women's soccer team hosts a Sweet 1(i
match in the NCAA tournament. My
high school soccer team looks to de
fend its state championship.

Right, then there's that college football game, too.
But in case you've missed it amidst all the other ath
letics going on, this is also the second weekend of intra
mural playoffs.
That's how you really know that it's lime for athletics
around here to start getting serious.
The usual suspects all made it through the first two
rounds — the Medical School teams, the chem lab
groups, the Graduate School of Business squads.
My IM ultimate team, unfortunately, is gone. We took
it to Twain in Round 1 (they never showed up), but then
we were summarily trounced by the "Potter Pirates."
I'm not going to lie — it was humbling. We had


Matt Babin
dreams of taking the D-II champi
onship back to the house. Crates of
champagne ready on ice in the
courtyard, a victory mix ready for
the party that would rock the
lakebed until the early hours of the
morning. We were stacked — a
few club players and enough oth
ers that knew how to play. Every
thing was in our favor.
Or so we thought. In hind
sight, there were hints all along
that it wouldn't be our year.
Karma was just not on our side.
We had to forfeit two regular sea
son games — shameful, yes. Even
more shameful when you realize
that we gave the IM people $15
that could have been better put
toward the movement to get
sloshball sanctioned as an IM
sport. Oh, how that burns.
But even still, we made it to the

playoffs. Our team was healthy,
mentally focused and physically
prepared. In short, we were pre
pared to crush Potter.
We didn't even score.
We tried everything — ham
mers, bucks, dominators, trick
plays, mental cunning, sexual dis
tractions. None of it worked. Final
score: Potter 12, House-to-remain
nameless-for-the-sake-of-its-resi-
dents 0. And just like that, our
dreams were shattered.
My roommate and 1 had gone
into the game remembering our
freshman year when we were
teammates on "Beast Flo," East Flo
Mo's ultimate team (this was before
East Flo was SLE, for the younger
readers). Playing IM ultimate with
that team was like letting the polar
bear take a swim in the seal tank at
the zoo.
What we did to other teams, it
just wasn't fair. They had no idea
what was coming for them. We
dropped 23 points in 45 minutes
on Branner. We shut out West

Lag. We dominated the bio labs.
We beat that team from the
Chemistry Department that (alls
itself "We Work for Dick." (That's
a team I have never understood.
Let's say that they actually do
work fora guy named Dick —
why advertise it? I wouldn't tell
anybody. And let's say that they
don't — why make something
like that up? It's really a no-win
situation, I think).
We even beat the (»SB. They
rolled up with their full uniforms.
The shirts that say "Stanlord (irad
uate School of Business Ultimate"
on the front and "It's all about
Sportsmanship, (&%$hole!" 011 the
back. If you play I Ms, you know
the ones I'm talking about.
We took them in the semis and
then beat the Medical School lor
the championship. I still have the
shirt. And I was ready for anoth
er one—until I found myself on
the other side of the lence Satur
day afternoon.
In truth, the game was closer

than (lie score would indicate. Se
riously. No, I really am serious
about llia(. Stop laughing. Ask the
Pirates if you don't believe me.
So in>' house is done in I Ms lor
the fall. While teams still go out
there to "work for Dick," we'll sit
back in our lounge chairs in the
courtyard and remember the
season that might have been.
We'll make sure to get our social
manager up on time to get us a
better time slot for basketball in
the winter. We'll have time to
spend in the cages getting ready
for spring soltball.
Most importantly, we can spend
valuable lime working on that
sloshball proposal. Maybe there
was some good karma in our loss,
after all.

Mall Ha hi 11 is a senior majoring in eco
nomics who actually thinks that Poller
way have only scored 11 points in the
game against Narnia. Actually, it may
have only been nine. You can contact
him at babin(a stanfordedn.

Karma was just not on our side.
We had to forfeit two regular sea
son games — shameful, yes. Even
more shameful when you realize
that we gave the IM people $15
that could have been better put
toward the movement to get
sloshball sanctioned as an IM
sport. Oh, how that burns.
But even still, we made it to the

playoffs. Our team was healthy,
mentally focused and physically
prepared. In short, we were pre
pared to crush Potter.
We didn't even score.
We tried everything — ham
mers, bucks, dominators, trick
plays, mental cunning, sexual dis
tractions. None of it worked. Final
score: Potter 12, House-to-remain
nameless-for-the-sake-of-its-resi-
dents 0. And just like that, our
dreams were shattered.
My roommate and 1 had gone
into the game remembering our
freshman year when we were
teammates on "Beast Flo," East Flo
Mo's ultimate team (this was before
East Flo was SLE, for the younger
readers). Playing IM ultimate with
that team was like letting the polar
bear take a swim in the seal tank at
the zoo.
What we did to other teams, it
just wasn't fair. They had no idea
what was coming for them. We
dropped 23 points in 45 minutes
on Branner. We shut out West

Lag. We dominated the bio labs.
We beat that team from the
Chemistry Department that (alls
itself "We Work for Dick." (That's
a team I have never understood.
Let's say that they actually do
work fora guy named Dick —
why advertise it? I wouldn't tell
anybody. And let's say that they
don't — why make something
like that up? It's really a no-win
situation, I think).
We even beat the (»SB. They
rolled up with their full uniforms.
The shirts that say "Stanlord (irad
uate School of Business Ultimate"
on the front and "It's all about
Sportsmanship, (&%$hole!" 011 the
back. If you play I Ms, you know
the ones I'm talking about.
We took them in the semis and
then beat the Medical School lor
the championship. I still have the
shirt. And I was ready for anoth
er one—until I found myself on
the other side of the lence Satur
day afternoon.
In truth, the game was closer

than (lie score would indicate. Se
riously. No, I really am serious
about llia(. Stop laughing. Ask the
Pirates if you don't believe me.
So in>' house is done in I Ms lor
the fall. While teams still go out
there to "work for Dick," we'll sit
back in our lounge chairs in the
courtyard and remember the
season that might have been.
We'll make sure to get our social
manager up on time to get us a
better time slot for basketball in
the winter. We'll have time to
spend in the cages getting ready
for spring soltball.
Most importantly, we can spend
valuable lime working on that
sloshball proposal. Maybe there
was some good karma in our loss,
after all.

So there are a lot of big games
this weekend. The Broncos
face the Colts on ESPN's Sun
day Night Football. The
Avalanche has a tough draw against
St. Louis on the road. The Stanford
women's soccer team hosts a Sweet 1(i
match in the NCAA tournament. My
high school soccer team looks to de
fend its state championship.

Right, then there's that college football game, too.
But in case you've missed it amidst all the other ath
letics going on, this is also the second weekend of intra
mural playoffs.
That's how you really know that it's lime for athletics
around here to start getting serious.
The usual suspects all made it through the first two
rounds — the Medical School teams, the chem lab
groups, the Graduate School of Business squads.
My IM ultimate team, unfortunately, is gone. We took
it to Twain in Round 1 (they never showed up), but then
we were summarily trounced by the "Potter Pirates."
I'm not going to lie — it was humbling. We had


Matt Babin
dreams of taking the D-II champi
onship back to the house. Crates of
champagne ready on ice in the
courtyard, a victory mix ready for
the party that would rock the
lakebed until the early hours of the
morning. We were stacked — a
few club players and enough oth
ers that knew how to play. Every
thing was in our favor.
Or so we thought. In hind
sight, there were hints all along
that it wouldn't be our year.
