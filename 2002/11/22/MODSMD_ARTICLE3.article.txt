## Senate tables proposal; AP Credit policy to remain unchanged 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to students urging
the University lo take a linn stand
on the issue of the U.S. govern
ment's anti-terrorism legislation
and as a follow-up to the Faculty
Senate's discussion during its previ
ous session, (he senate's Steering
Committee brought forth its Reso
lution on Universities and Anti-
Terrorism Legislation for approval
during yesterday's session. 1 lowev
er, the senate could not come to an
agreement 011 the exact wording of
the document and no resolution
was passed.
Senate Chair Hank Creely in
troduced the resolution to the sen
ate, recommending that it move to
pass it.
"The people involved in chalt
ing [the resolution] feel this is a use
ful, not counterproductive step for
the senate to take," Greely said.
The resolution acknowledged
that legislation currently being dis

cussed or already passed by the
U.S. government could "harm the
educational and research missions
of colleges and universities" and
called upon the Stanford adminis
tration, leaders of other prominent
universities, and leaders of the gov
ernment to work toward develop
ing the most mutually favorable
policies.
The problems leading to the res
olution's referral to the Steering
Committee arose from disagree
ments between senate members
about how the last sentence of the
resolution should be worded.
Linguistics and Philosophy Prof.
Tom Wasow was the first to express
concern about the phrase "unneces
sarily hinder research and educa
tion," which referred to the type of
government interference that the
University would resist if the resolu
tion were passed. Hie resolution's
intention was to dissuade the gov
ernment from taking any action that
hindered a university's progress in
research or education, but it also rec
ognized that under certain extreme
circumstances, the government
should limit a university's functions
in the interest of national security.
