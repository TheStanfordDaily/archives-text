# Faculty haggle over anti-terror resolution
## Senate tables proposal; AP Credit policy to remain unchanged 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to students urging
the University lo take a linn stand
on the issue of the U.S. govern
ment's anti-terrorism legislation
and as a follow-up to the Faculty
Senate's discussion during its previ
ous session, (he senate's Steering
Committee brought forth its Reso
lution on Universities and Anti-
Terrorism Legislation for approval
during yesterday's session. 1 lowev
er, the senate could not come to an
agreement 011 the exact wording of
the document and no resolution
was passed.
Senate Chair Hank Creely in
troduced the resolution to the sen
ate, recommending that it move to
pass it.
"The people involved in chalt
ing [the resolution] feel this is a use
ful, not counterproductive step for
the senate to take," Greely said.
The resolution acknowledged
that legislation currently being dis

cussed or already passed by the
U.S. government could "harm the
educational and research missions
of colleges and universities" and
called upon the Stanford adminis
tration, leaders of other prominent
universities, and leaders of the gov
ernment to work toward develop
ing the most mutually favorable
policies.
The problems leading to the res
olution's referral to the Steering
Committee arose from disagree
ments between senate members
about how the last sentence of the
resolution should be worded.
Linguistics and Philosophy Prof.
Tom Wasow was the first to express
concern about the phrase "unneces
sarily hinder research and educa
tion," which referred to the type of
government interference that the
University would resist if the resolu
tion were passed. Hie resolution's
intention was to dissuade the gov
ernment from taking any action that
hindered a university's progress in
research or education, but it also rec
ognized that under certain extreme
circumstances, the government
should limit a university's functions
in the interest of national security.


PATRICK WOOD/The Stanford Dail-
Some senate members feared
that the word "unnecessarily" could
Ik' interpreted liberally to allow the
government to interfere with Uni
versity operations and place gov
ernmental restrictions on research
and education without fully consid
ering their consequences. Most
agreed that the government might
deem any of its intrusions "neces
sary," thereby defeating the docu
ment's purpose.
l he question then became how
to change the wording to fit the sen
ate's sentiment.
Debate raged for more than 20
minutes about how to reflect the
senate's position that the govern
ment should have the power, albeit
limited, to oversee and restrict op
erations, but that the academic
community should resist overzeal
ous attempts by the government to
control University policies.
Any proposals made about how
to alter the phrase suggesting that
the best interest of the University
should take priority over the best
interest of the country were
strongly rejected. University Presi
dent John Hennessy encouraged
senate members to consider that in
a national emergency, the govern
ment might need to hinder
progress to a certain extent, and
therefore some sort of loophole in
the document — such as the one
present — should be retained to
allow for such a crisis.
"If we don't acknowledge that
possibility [of a national emer
gency], we severely undercut our
credibility as an institution," Hen
nessy said.
The senate did not reach an
agreement and could not pass the
resolution, moving instead to
recommit it to the Steering Com
mittee for further drafting. It will
reappear in its new, revised format
for passage in the senate's session
on Jan. 9.
Though Assoc. Prof, of Medicine

Phyllis Gardner, among others, felt
that "time is of the essence" in pass
ing the resolution — especially in
response to student encourage
ment to take a public stand on the
U.S. government's anti-terrorism
legislation — the senate eventually
voted to let the Steering Committee
perfect the wording in a small
group setting, which Prof. Greely
argued was the most efficient
method of revision.
Prof, of Medicine Stephen Fort
mann attempted to quell any senate
member's fear that unfavorable leg
islation may arise between now and
when the new resolution will be
passed by speculating that "not
much is going to happen in Con
gress before Jan. 9."
After recommitting the resolu
tion, the Faculty Senate then
turned its attention to the subject of
Advanced Placement credit at Stan
ford. Chair of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and Policy
Hazel Markus and Chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid Ewart
Thomas, both professors of psy
chology, presented their respective
committee's reports.
"This year's committees have de
cided after serious and intense con
sideration not to change the AP pol
icy," Greely said.
Both committees, working inde
pendently of one another, reached
the same conclusion, opting to re
tain the current policy that allows
students to use up to 45 units of Ad
vanced Placement credit toward
graduation.
Based on what Greely called
"really hard work in thinking
about this long and hard," the
committees decided that it would
be in the best interest of the stu
dents to preserve the policy.
Thomas summed up months of
work succinctly: "I asked myself,
'What's wrong with the current
policy?' 1 said, 'Nothing.' "
However, both committees
stressed that the issue is far from
resolved, and it will resurface for
what Markus called "plenty more
discussion."
