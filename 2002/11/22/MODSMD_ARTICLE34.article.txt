# Stanford and Cal ready to battle in 105th Big Game
## The
						Cardinal seeks to save its disappointing season with an upset victory 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The scenario is simple for head
coach Buddy Teevens and the Cardinal
football team. Their season will be de
fined by one game, and that game
comes tomorrow at California, in the
105 th rendition of Big Game.
Neither team has any chance at a
postseason, Stanford because of an
abysmal 2-8 record and Cal because of
a bowl ban by the NCAA. So each team
can truly live up to the old cliche and
leave it on (he field. Stanford is deter
mined to leave Berkeley with a victory,
because its record seven-game winning
streak against its rival is hanging in the
balance. The Bears (6-5, 3-4 Pacific 10
Conference) are double-digit favorites,
and see this as their best chance to fi
nally tip the scales and enjoy their first
winning season since 1993.
The only trophy that the squads can
carry home this year is the Axe, yet each
team is led by a first-year head coach
who has never participated in the game
or even laid a linger on the object of
their schools' respective desire.
Yet the coaches are not strangers to
fierce intrastate competitions.
Teevens comes from Florida, where
one of the country's bitterest rivalries
resides between the Gators and Flori
da State. Ted ford has resurrected the
Cal program after heading to Berke
ley from Oregon, where the Civil War
with Oregon State divides the North
west annually.
So where does Big Game rank in
their experience?
"Even being here a short time, I do
understand the importance of the
game for the alumni and for the uni
versity," Ted ford said, "1 think Cioach
Teevens and 1 have both been very well
schooled on what's about to take place."
Teevens is reading up on Big

Game history, yet he agrees with Ted
ford that the rivalry seems quite civil
compared with others in which they
have participated.
"Against Florida State, the fans were
rocking the bus, throwing things at us,"
Teevens said. "If you were a Gator, you
had to hate them. And if you were a
Seminole, you had to hate us. Here,
you not only have grads of both schools
who see each other all the time, they
hire each other."
What both coaches will find come
12:30 p.m. at Memorial Stadium to
morrow is that, for at least one day,

Stanford and Cal hate one another just
as much. And on the 20th anniversary
of "The Play," fans will be expecting the
same sort of surprises that character
ized the last century of Big Game. The
game has been decided by seven points
or less in 50 of its previous installments,
and a remarkable five contests have
hinged on the final play, more than any
other rivalry in the nation.
But casting away the illustrious his
tory, legendary trophy and fans' expec
tations, Big Game remains one of col
lege football's most intense matchups,
and the key to understanding it is

breaking down each team by position
to see who holds the advantage.
Quarterback
Whether Stanford junior Chris
Lewis or redshirt freshman Kyle Mat
ter lines up under center, Cal will have
the upper hand. Senior Kyle Boiler has
exorcised the ghosts of the past three
disappointing seasons and emerged as
the surefire Pac-10 Most Improved
Player. Boiler has 20 touchdown passes
against just nine interceptions. IT Mat-
