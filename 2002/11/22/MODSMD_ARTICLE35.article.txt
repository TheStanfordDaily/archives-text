Big Game is a storied rivalry between Stanford and
California that defies all odds and ignores all logic.
Nobody on earth ever knows who will win the game.
For Stanford and Cal fans, Big Game transcends the
sport of football.
Throughout the past two decades, Big Game has
become a way for Stanford fans to forget about the
first 10 games of the season and demonstrate Stan
lord's superiority over its long-time rival, represent
ing the salvation of the football team's season. This
season is no exception. However, outside the cam
puses of Stanford and Cal, Big Game has become
overshadowed by other rivalry-week games like
Michigan-( )hio State.
Yet Big Game used to have a tremendous impact,
not only for the two Bay Area rivals, but also for the
entire West Coast. Because the Bay Area did not have
any professional sport s teams at the turn of the centu
ry, Big Game became the biggest sporting event on
the West Coast for many years, drawing thousands of
fans from all over California.
The 104-game-old series began during the 1891-
1892 school year after a veteran California football
team challenged newborn Stanford University to a
football game in the fall of 1891. John Whittemore, a
transfer student who began to organize a football
team at Stanford, declined the challenge at first but
accepted it later in the spring.
The two schools met at a sandlot near Haight and
Stanyan Streets in San Francisco on March 19, 1892.
About 20,000 spectators crowded the field that day
as Stanford student manager and future President
Herbert Hoover collected a stunning $30,000 in
gate receipts.
The game was about to begin when the referee dis
covered that neither club brought a football to the
field (Some sources say it was Hoover who forgot to
bring the ball). Luckily, the owner of a local sporting
goods store was in the crowd, and while he rode off on
horseback to get a ball, the crowd waited anxiously for
more than an hour.
Once the game started, Stanford leaped out to a
14-0 lead and held on fora 14-10 upset of the heavily
favored and much more experienced Cal squad, be
ginning Stanford's long-standing tradition of defeat
ing the Golden Bears (Stanford leads the all-time Big
Game series 54-39-11).
Even then, Cal fans found creative ways to justify
their losses. Following a controversial Stanford touch
down iu 1894, a Cal student newspaper reporter
wrote, "[Stanford] won by a fluke and a referee. . .
that is the only just verdict that can be passed. 1 do not
mean to insinuate that the referee was in any way in
lluenced to take a Stanford view of the game, but I do
mean he does not know a touchdown when he sees it."
Perhaps tired of losing to Stanford at football, Cal
proposed to change the sport of the Big Game from
football to rugby in 1904. Fearing that football was too
violent, Cal President Benjamin Wheeler validated
Cal's derogatory nickname — "The Weenies" —
when he said, "The game of football must be entirely
made over or go."
From 1906 to 1914, rugby — which was apparent
ly a less violent sport back then — became the official
sport of Big Game. Stanford also dominated Cal at
rugby, posting a 5-3-1 record.
During the 1920s and 19305, the popularity of Big
Game grew tremendously
throughout the West Coast, forc
ing the Cardinal to build Stanford
Stadium, then the biggest sporting
venue west of New York, in 1921.
I hat year, 62,740 fans packed
the newly built stadium for Big
Game, setting an attendance
record for the West Coast.
However, Stanford Stadium
was still not large enough to fit the
trainloads of fans who came to
watch Big Game from all across
California, and in 1924 Cal built
Memorial Stadium.
Marking the debut of Stanford
coaching legend Pop Warner,
Stanford and Cal played to a 20-20
tie in front of 77,000 fans in what
some considered the greatest of all
Big (James. The ()akland Tribune
even reported that in the parking
lot, scalpers were getting $100 for
a pair of tickets, during an era
when a hot dog cost 15 cents.
On the field, Stanford — play
ing without injured Ail-American
Ernie Nevers — trailed 20-6 with
less than six minutes remaining in
the game. Quarterback Ed Walker
threw two touchdown passes, one

to Murray Cuddeback, who had
been knocked unconscious earlier
in the game after colliding with a
camera tripod, and Stanford es
caped with a tie.
Two years later, Stanford and
Cal competed in what was ar
guably the most important Big
Game ever. Both teams entered
the game tied for the lead in the
conference with perfect 10-0
records. The winner would go to
the Rose Bowl and contend fora
national championship.
As 90,000 people watched the
game at Memorial Stadium,
Stanford defeated Cal 13-0. The
attendance set a Big Game
record that is still intact today.
Stanford went on to tie Alabama
7-7 in the Rose Bowl, and Stan
ford and Alabama shared the na
tional championship.
While neither Stanford nor Cal
will not contend fora national
championship or pack its suitcases
fora bowl game this year, school
pride — and the storied Axe —
will be on the line as Stanford at
tempts its eighth consecutive Big
Game victory.
