# Who would have thought?
## Kyle vs. Kyle 
### AARON LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
I lii.s article originally ran on Nov. 17, 2000, before the
103 rd Big Game. Our fearless prognosticator, Aaron
I wine, wrote the article despite sharp criticism from profes
sional unite rs who said that the Holler-Matter matchup would
never happen, and also despite the fact that Matter had not
yet officially signed with Stanford, which meant that the
Stan ford coaching staff were not able to comment when the
story ran.

In a rivalry filled with 103 years of history, it is only
appropriate to speculate about the future of Big
Game.
In November 2002, Cal vs. Stanford might have an
intriguing matchup on its hands. It's the Kyle Bowl:
Quarterback Kyle Boiler of Cal vs. Stanford QB Kyle
Matter.
It is unlikely that many people have heard about
these young guns. Boiler is just a sophomore at Cal,
and Matter, who said he has" 100 percent" committed


PATRICK WOOD/The Stanford Daily
to Stanford, is still a senior quar
terback in high school.
The similarities do not end
with their first names. Boiler is
a graduate of Hart High
School in Newhall, Calif. — the
same school Matter currently
attends. Each has led Hart to
California Interscholastic Fed
eration Southern Section Divi
sion 111 titles — Boiler in 1998
and Matter in 1999 (Matter also
led I fart to a Division 111 title in
2000).
In his one season as Hart's
quarterback, Boiler was an
All-American, setting the Cali
fornia state passing record,
throwing for 4,851 yards, with
59 touchdowns and only three
interceptions. He was the
most highly touted recruit in
Southern California and start
ed for Cal as a true freshman
last year.
"Kyle | Boiler| was a
tremendous quarterback and
he did an amazing job. I le had
one of the best arms to come
from Southern California
since John Flway (who went to
Granada Hills High)," said
Hart High School coach Mike
Herrington.
Before Mattel even got a
chance to prove his capabilities
as Boiler's successor at Hart
High, he faced many compar

isons in the local papers, which
had already decided that
Boiler's shoes would be impos
sible to fill.
Boy, were they wrong.
In his one-and-a-half sea
sons at the helm of the Hart
football team, Matter has be
come the school's career pass
ing leader with 6,307 yards and
72 touchdowns.
"Kyle [Matter] is an outstand
ing athlete, and he's got great
knowledge of the game," Her
rington said. "He's probably the
most intelligent quarterback
we've ever had."
The Hart coaching staff had
a chance to test Matter's intelli
gence after he suffered a blow
to the head in a league game
last Thursday. They asked Mat
ter, who carries a 4.5 G.P.A.,
what the Pythagorean Theo
rem was.
"I was woozy, but I wanted to
get back in the game," Matter
said. "So when the coaches
weren't looking, I had one of the
linemen remind me what it was."
Of course, in all fairness to
Stanford quarterbacks Chris
Lewis and Teyo Johnson {who
mishit ted in 2000 before moving to
wide receiver), this "Kyle Bowl" is
far from a sure thing— in two
years, Boiler would be a senior,
and, most likely, Matter would
be a redshirt freshman.
But stranger things have
happened, such as a certain
redshirt freshman named
Lewis starting at quarterback

for the Cardinal a few times
this season.
So, in two years, Boiler vs.
Matter could be the headline at
Big Game, creating as much
hype in the Santa Clarita Valley
as any new t ide at Six Flags
Magic Mountain.
"There would be a lot of peo
ple divided down here, but
everyone has great pride in
both players, and I'm sure
many would lly up for the
game," Herrington said.
When asked who he would
be tooting for, Herrington de
clined to make a decision.
"I'd just want a high-scoring
game with both of them passing
for 500 yards and six touch
downs each," he said.
Ilerrington's outrageous
goal might not be too far oil, be
cause bother Boiler and Mattel
have shown their ability to put
up big numbers in high school
games, and, of course, this is the
Pacific-10 Conference.
As for what might happen if
Matter and Boiler met on the
field before the game, Matter
thought that, despite the big ri
valry, they'd "still lie friendly
with each other."
"Kyle [Boiler] was almost
like a mentor to be iti high
school," Matter said. "I'd always
be learning a lot at practices and
at the games [from him]."
In two years, Stanford's
Matter will have a chance to
teach Boiler a few things of
his own.
