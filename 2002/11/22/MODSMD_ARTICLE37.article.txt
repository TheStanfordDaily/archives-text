# The
						risks and rewards of Rivalry Week
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Almost every team has one. Alabama has
Auburn. Michigan has Ohio State. USC
has UCLA. Washington has Washington
State.
Kvery school has that one rival that makes stu
dents' skin crawl and their whole body shiver. That
light song that makes them want to hit something.
That mascot that they wish they would one day find
alone in a dark alley.
As the last weekend before Thanksgiving ap
proaches, schools throughout the nation are in the
midst of "Rivalry Week."
Students have been at bonfires and rallies all
week. Rivalry games often make or break a team's

season, and that idea holds true for many teams
this year.
Tomorrow, undefeated No. 2 Ohio State laces
off against archrival No. 9 Michigan. The Buck
eyes have had a great season, winning 12 games,
and a win will cement their place in the national
title game. However, if they lose against the
Wolverines, this year will appear to be a waste for
many in Columbus.
On the other side of the coin, Washington has
had a disappointing season, winning only six
games. However, a win over intrastate rival Wash
ington State would give the Huskies the "Apple
Cup," in effect validating its season by spoiling the
Cougars' national championship hopes.
