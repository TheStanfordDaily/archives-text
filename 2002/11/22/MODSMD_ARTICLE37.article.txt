# The 						risks and rewards of Rivalry Week
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF COLUMNIST 
Almost every team has one. Alabama has
Auburn. Michigan has Ohio State. USC
has UCLA. Washington has Washington
State.
Kvery school has that one rival that makes stu
dents' skin crawl and their whole body shiver. That
light song that makes them want to hit something.
That mascot that they wish they would one day find
alone in a dark alley.
As the last weekend before Thanksgiving ap
proaches, schools throughout the nation are in the
midst of "Rivalry Week."
Students have been at bonfires and rallies all
week. Rivalry games often make or break a team's

season, and that idea holds true for many teams
this year.
Tomorrow, undefeated No. 2 Ohio State laces
off against archrival No. 9 Michigan. The Buck
eyes have had a great season, winning 12 games,
and a win will cement their place in the national
title game. However, if they lose against the
Wolverines, this year will appear to be a waste for
many in Columbus.
On the other side of the coin, Washington has
had a disappointing season, winning only six
games. However, a win over intrastate rival Wash
ington State would give the Huskies the "Apple
Cup," in effect validating its season by spoiling the
Cougars' national championship hopes.
Then there is Big Game. The
game has been a topic of conversation
since the beginning of the season.
"You see Cal beat Michigan State?
Big Game could be a problem ..."
"If we are getting crushed by the
Sun Devils, the game against the
Golden Bears could get ugly ..."
Standing in the student section last
week, it was easy for conversations to
drift toward Big Game. While every
one wanted us to beat Oregon State,
how much did it really matter? Stan
lord isn't going to a howl game, and it
isn't competing for the Pacific-10
Conference title. Yes, I wanted the
Cardinal to win so that the seniors
could leave Stanford Stadium with a
win. But, in the long run, the game
was irrelevant.
But there is nothing irrelevant
about Big Game. Ever. It doesn't
matter what the records of the two
teams are. It doesn't matter what sto
rylines follow the players or what
year they are. In many ways, Big
Game is about much more than loot
ball. It's about having to face Cal fans
for the next 364 clays.
Throughout I his season, whenev
er I saw a Cal supporter, they would
tell me about how great their team is
this year and about how bad Stan
ford is. But despite all their trash
talk, I always had the same response:
seven in a row.
But if Cal wins tomorrow, that
safety net is gone. I will just have to

stand and take it like a man, and there
is nothing worse than a gloating
Golden Bears fan.
I have had experience with a gloat
ing fan, and it is worse than being
punched in the stomach. When 1 was
a senior in high school, I was a huge
UCLA Bruins fan. 1 watched every
game, and 1 hated the USC Trojans
with all my heart.
I lowever, rivalry week was al
ways an intense affair for me. My
best friend was a USC fan, and
throughout the year we would occa
sionally talk trash, often with some
subtlety. But when Rivalry Week
came, we went crazy. We could
barely talk to each other without
some sort of scuffle.
So senior year we decided to take
the game to the next level.
We made "the bet."
"The bet" was simple. The loser
had to wear a shirt and hat of the win
ning team. Simple enough, right?
The worst thing that could happen
was 1 would have to wear an ugly hat
fora day. And I knew that wasn't
going to happen anyway . . .
Flash forward a few days: It's the
last play of the game at the Rose
Bowl. The Trojans' atrocious kicker
hits a 36-yard field goal with nine
seconds remaining that barely, just
barely, clears the uprights. I will
never forget the sight of that ball just
clearing the bar as my friend went
crazy with glee.
As I drove home from the game,
I couldn't help but think that this
was the worst pain I had felt from a
sporting event. It literally felt like
someone had taken out my heart,

used it as a bowling ball and then
proceeded to eat it. I could barely
speak.
But then Monday came, surpass
ing Saturday in intolerable pain. My
friend had decided to enjoy tortur
ing me, personalizing my punish
ment by drawing on a white shirt
with a red marker. "USC rules,"
"Bruins suck" and"I am the biggest
USC fan in the world" were written
all over the shirt, along with a re
count of the score.
As I walked around campus, peo
ple would be amazed by how much I
loved USC, although most kids just
thought I was a complete idiot. It was
a long day.
With rivalry games come risk.
There is no better feeling than de
stroying a rival with a last-second
play, but there is nothing worse
than losing.
As most Stanford students prepare
fora potential loss tomorrow, there is
a strange aura in the air as " The Play"
celebrates its 20th anniversary. " The
Play," which is the famous Cal kickoff
return that won the 1982 Big Game
(the one where the Stanford Band
ran on the field too early), has been
played repeatedly on ESPN, causing
Stanford fans throughout the country
to relive one of the most painful
sports memories imaginable.
But with suspense in the air, I
smell a Stanford upset. . .

Jacob SapersU'in is a sophomore majoring
in public policy. IJ the Cardinal loses on
Saturday, he will loch himself into his room
until Stanford beats Cal again. Keep him
