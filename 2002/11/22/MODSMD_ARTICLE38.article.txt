# Despite injuries and losses,
## Carter carries on 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the players of the Stanford football
team, this season has not gone exactly ;is
they had hoped.
This is true for senior running back
Kerry Carter, who was injured for part of
the season. With a tweaked knee, Carter
completely missed the game against Ari
zona State and was out for most of the con
test against San Jose State. Carter was also
less than 100 percent in a few other games
over the course of the season.
"I started off being hurt, and that slowed
me down a lot," Carter said. "Right now I
feel in the best shape and the best form. We
have been playing against a lot of teams
with really good defenses ... It is not where
I wanted to be by any stretch of the imagi
nation, but it's been alright."
If the Cardinal wants to beat California
((>-5, 3-4 Pacific-10 Conference), it is going
to need a solid game from Carter.
"Our line has been holding up really
well," Carter said. "Our running game has
been one of the few consistent things we
have had all season."
Carter has been the strength behind the
running game. Using his hard-nosed style,
he has amassed 490 yards, averaging 3.0
yards per carry. But with his knee finally
feeling healthy, he has been more consis
tent, running for more than 70 yards in

four of I he last five games.
"[The knee is] a 100 percent, and 1 am
100 percent," Carter said.
For Carter, like all of the seniors, Satur
day is his last game in a Cardinal uniform.
"We are going to have to come out ag
gressive and confident," Carter said. "We
have to believe in what we can do, believe
that we can come out and execute."
In addition, Cartel has never lost to the
Bears and hopes to extend the winning
streak to eight games.
"Adding to the emotion of Big Game is
the fact that it is my last game and that we
are trying to go for eight in a row," Carter
said. "There is a pressure that we put on
ourselves as a university. Just having the ri
valry itself, every year we want to take it be
cause we want to have bragging rights for
another 364 days."
While Saturday is the last day for Carter
in a Stanford uniform, he doesn't plan on it
being his last in pads.
"I've got to get the whole agent thing
sorted out, and then go from there," (barter
said. "I'll try to get my training done, and
get in the best shape possible for the All-Star
game and the combines so I can improve
my [position in the NFL draft|."
For Carter, it has been an interesting
path to his final collegiate game.
"I started playing football in fifth or

Kerry Carter threads his way through a pack of UCLA defenders earlier this
year. The senior running back is one of only seven players to ever amass
2,000 career rushing yards for the Cardinal.
