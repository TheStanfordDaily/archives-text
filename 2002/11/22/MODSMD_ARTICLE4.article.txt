# Staff debate bandwidth policy
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Not many students seem to know what
their rights are when it comes to comput
er and Internet usage on campus; some
even believe that tliey will get shut down
if they download certain files in exorbi
tant amounts. While these rumors exag
gerate the extent of the University's con
trol over the network, the administra
tion's controversial policy of "traffic shap
ing" has drawn criticism from Stanford's
own employees.
According to Newsweek, Yale Univer
sity prohibits people from using online
file-sharing services such as Kazaa on the
university network. Administrators from
Stanford, on the other hand, said that the
University conducts subtler regulation
and enforces content-monitoring policies
that restrict computer usage for the over
all benefit of the network's effectiveness.
Ethan Rikleen, network and systems
administrator at Residential Computing,
said that Stanford does not have a specif
ic: policy restricting students from clown
loading files.
"I would imagine that the Networking
office has the right to look into an area of
traffic if there is a problem," Rikleen said.
"Other than that, there is no monitoring
that I know of. It's not easy to tell what
people are getting. Even if you can tell
that people are using Kazaa, you can't tell

if the content is legal or not."
Despite Rikleen's claim that the Uni
versity cannot monitor content being
downloaded, Head of Residential Com
puting Rich Holeton noted that Stanford
actively looks for illegal content. Under
the University's policy, students must fol
low all relevant laws, including the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. This means
that they are not supposed to have unli
censed files 011 their computers.
According to Holeton, the University
engages in a form of content control that
distinguishes between academic uses and
entertainment uses of computers.
"A technology called 'traffic shaping' is
used to prioritize, i.e., give more of the
available bandwidth to, what Networking
has determined to be 'academic' related
traffic — Web, e-mail — as opposed to
'entertainment' traffic [such as peer-to
peer, or P2P] file sharing," 1 foleton said.
"Personally, I find this distinction to
be spurious and somewhat arbitrary, and
I think that traffic shaping is a techno
logical euphemism for 'content control,'
" he added. "Further, I think that a poli
cy that de facto 'shapes' or controls con
tent should be debated and decided by
the faculty and students of the Universi
ty, not alone by a staff department that
administers and maintains the infra
structure."
I lowever, I loleton acknowledged that
without such traffic: shaping" net
work use by so many people
would be ineffective due to the
clogged bandwidth.
"It's quite possible that a
process that involved faculty and
students would still come to the
same conclusion and enact the
same policy," he said. "By open
ing up the debate, however, I
think it would become obvious
that what is needed is more band
width or bigger 'pipes,' which cost
money, which would need to be
allocated by the University for
this purpose. I'd like to see that
happen — 1 think that P2P
should be encouraged, not dis
couraged, because these tech
nologies take the Internet in the
constructive, collaborative .and
democratic directions I would
like to see it evolve.
" There is another policy that
impacts file sharing by shaping
network behavior," he continued.
"The network pipes are heavily
balanced in favor of Stanford res
idents downloadingasopposed to
uploading files to those outside
the Stanford network. If you were

a proponent of the free sharing
information via P2P, you might
say that Stanford's policy is a self
ish one, in that people here can
'take' but not 'give' much in terms
of file sharing with the entire In
ternet community."
Rikleen pointed out that one
portion of the Computer and
Network Usage Policy vaguely
refers to file sharing. The 2000
version of the policy states that
"University information re
sources should not be used for
personal activities not related to
appropriate University func
tions, except in a purely inciden
tal matter."
Rikleen expressed disagree
ment with this part of the policy,
arguing that a university is not
only a place for academia, but also
for recreation.
He emphasized that although
he believes there is no specific pol
icy monitoring or restricting stu
dents, faculty and staff who use
University computing resources,
anyone who excessively uses
bandwidth and blocks too much
traffic will be warned.
I lie Networking employees on
campus who look for students
with the highest rate of traffic are
not interested in the traffic's na
ture, according to Rikleen. Gen

erally, students who use excessive
bandwidth are warned ahead of
time, but in rare cases their con
nection can become shut down.
"For instance, if students
don't respond to warnings, or if
the person's computer poses an
immediate danger to the net
work and we can't reach him,
then we will shut down to save
the health of the network," Rik
leeii said. "We want to keep the
network healthy so other people
can use it."
Holeton suggested that out
side sources do more monitoring
of copyright violations in terms of
entertainment file sharing than
does Stanford.
"As for monitoring, I believe
that only very bandwidth-inten
sive sharing or serving of files to
others will attract the direct atten
tion of Networking or Security,"
Holeton said. "They don't scan
the network in search of MP3
files. Most of the 'monitoring' is
effectively done by outsiders,
namely the MPAA (Motion Pic
ture Association of America) and
RIAA (Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America), who constant
ly scan college networks in partic
ular looking for copyright viola
tions, i.e. illegal file sharing / serv
ing of files. When they.find one —

as they do thousands of times per
day — they send 'cease and desist'
form letters to the alleged viola
tor's [Internet service provider]."
According to Rikleen, "Down
loading is not a problem. If, how
ever, people leave their comput
ers on all the time and their files
are open for file sharing by every
one outside of campus, that cre
ates a lot of traffic.
"Stanford is pretty good about
not getting involved in what stu
dents are doing, with the excep
tion of enforcing the law and
making sure the health of the net
work is well-maintained," he
added. "I see monitoring of con
tent of traffic as analogous to ban
ning the importation of coffee
beans into the country because
some people smuggle cocaine in
the coffee."
Holeton expressed a different
opinion of Stanford's policies to
ward file sharing.
"As an analogy to widespread
marijuana use among a previous
generation of Stanford students,
it's the large dealers that attract
the authorities' attention, not so
much the individual users," I lole
ton said. "With the difference, I
might add, that marijuana was ac
tually illegal, while file sharing it
self is not, in itself, illegal."

couraged, because these tech
nologies take the Internet in the
constructive, collaborative .and

like to see it evolve.
" There is another policy that
impacts file sharing by shaping
network behavior," he continued.
"The network pipes are heavily
balanced in favor of Stanford res
idents downloadingasopposed to
uploading files to those outside
the Stanford network. If you were

a proponent of the free sharing
information via P2P, you might
say that Stanford's policy is a self
ish one, in that people here can
'take' but not 'give' much in terms
of file sharing with the entire In
ternet community."
Rikleen pointed out that one
portion of the Computer and
Network Usage Policy vaguely
refers to file sharing. The 2000
version of the policy states that
"University information re
sources should not be used for
personal activities not related to
appropriate University func
tions, except in a purely inciden
tal matter."
Rikleen expressed disagree
ment with this part of the policy,
arguing that a university is not
only a place for academia, but also
for recreation.
He emphasized that although
he believes there is no specific pol
icy monitoring or restricting stu
dents, faculty and staff who use
University computing resources,
anyone who excessively uses
bandwidth and blocks too much
traffic will be warned.
I lie Networking employees on
campus who look for students
with the highest rate of traffic are
not interested in the traffic's na
ture, according to Rikleen. Gen

erally, students who use excessive
bandwidth are warned ahead of
time, but in rare cases their con
nection can become shut down.
"For instance, if students
don't respond to warnings, or if
the person's computer poses an
immediate danger to the net
work and we can't reach him,
then we will shut down to save
the health of the network," Rik
leeii said. "We want to keep the
network healthy so other people
can use it."
Holeton suggested that out
side sources do more monitoring
of copyright violations in terms of
entertainment file sharing than
does Stanford.
"As for monitoring, I believe
that only very bandwidth-inten
sive sharing or serving of files to
others will attract the direct atten
tion of Networking or Security,"
Holeton said. "They don't scan
the network in search of MP3
files. Most of the 'monitoring' is
effectively done by outsiders,
namely the MPAA (Motion Pic
ture Association of America) and
RIAA (Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America), who constant
ly scan college networks in partic
ular looking for copyright viola
tions, i.e. illegal file sharing / serv
ing of files. When they.find one —

as they do thousands of times per
day — they send 'cease and desist'
form letters to the alleged viola
tor's [Internet service provider]."
According to Rikleen, "Down
loading is not a problem. If, how
ever, people leave their comput
ers on all the time and their files
are open for file sharing by every
one outside of campus, that cre
ates a lot of traffic.
"Stanford is pretty good about
not getting involved in what stu
dents are doing, with the excep
tion of enforcing the law and
making sure the health of the net
work is well-maintained," he
added. "I see monitoring of con
tent of traffic as analogous to ban
ning the importation of coffee
beans into the country because
some people smuggle cocaine in
the coffee."
Holeton expressed a different
opinion of Stanford's policies to
ward file sharing.
"As an analogy to widespread
marijuana use among a previous
generation of Stanford students,
it's the large dealers that attract
the authorities' attention, not so
much the individual users," I lole
ton said. "With the difference, I
might add, that marijuana was ac
tually illegal, while file sharing it
self is not, in itself, illegal."
Not many students seem to know what
their rights are when it comes to comput
er and Internet usage on campus; some
even believe that tliey will get shut down
if they download certain files in exorbi
tant amounts. While these rumors exag
gerate the extent of the University's con
trol over the network, the administra
tion's controversial policy of "traffic shap
ing" has drawn criticism from Stanford's
own employees.
According to Newsweek, Yale Univer
sity prohibits people from using online
file-sharing services such as Kazaa on the
university network. Administrators from
Stanford, on the other hand, said that the
University conducts subtler regulation
and enforces content-monitoring policies
that restrict computer usage for the over
all benefit of the network's effectiveness.
Ethan Rikleen, network and systems
administrator at Residential Computing,
said that Stanford does not have a specif
ic: policy restricting students from clown
loading files.
"I would imagine that the Networking
office has the right to look into an area of
traffic if there is a problem," Rikleen said.
"Other than that, there is no monitoring
that I know of. It's not easy to tell what
people are getting. Even if you can tell
that people are using Kazaa, you can't tell

if the content is legal or not."
Despite Rikleen's claim that the Uni
versity cannot monitor content being
downloaded, Head of Residential Com
puting Rich Holeton noted that Stanford
actively looks for illegal content. Under
the University's policy, students must fol
low all relevant laws, including the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. This means
that they are not supposed to have unli
censed files 011 their computers.
According to Holeton, the University
engages in a form of content control that
distinguishes between academic uses and
entertainment uses of computers.
"A technology called 'traffic shaping' is
used to prioritize, i.e., give more of the
available bandwidth to, what Networking
has determined to be 'academic' related
traffic — Web, e-mail — as opposed to
'entertainment' traffic [such as peer-to
peer, or P2P] file sharing," 1 foleton said.
"Personally, I find this distinction to
be spurious and somewhat arbitrary, and
I think that traffic shaping is a techno
logical euphemism for 'content control,'
" he added. "Further, I think that a poli
cy that de facto 'shapes' or controls con
tent should be debated and decided by
the faculty and students of the Universi
ty, not alone by a staff department that
administers and maintains the infra
structure."
I lowever, I loleton acknowledged that
without such traffic: shaping" net
work use by so many people
would be ineffective due to the
clogged bandwidth.
"It's quite possible that a
process that involved faculty and
students would still come to the
same conclusion and enact the
same policy," he said. "By open
ing up the debate, however, I
think it would become obvious
that what is needed is more band
width or bigger 'pipes,' which cost
money, which would need to be
allocated by the University for
this purpose. I'd like to see that
happen — 1 think that P2P
should be encouraged, not dis
couraged, because these tech
nologies take the Internet in the
