# Staff debate bandwidth policy

### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Not many students seem to know what
their rights are when it comes to comput
er and Internet usage on campus; some
even believe that tliey will get shut down
if they download certain files in exorbi
tant amounts. While these rumors exag
gerate the extent of the University's con
trol over the network, the administra
tion's controversial policy of "traffic shap
ing" has drawn criticism from Stanford's
own employees.
According to Newsweek, Yale Univer
sity prohibits people from using online
file-sharing services such as Kazaa on the
university network. Administrators from
Stanford, on the other hand, said that the
University conducts subtler regulation
and enforces content-monitoring policies
that restrict computer usage for the over
all benefit of the network's effectiveness.
Ethan Rikleen, network and systems
administrator at Residential Computing,
said that Stanford does not have a specif
ic: policy restricting students from clown
loading files.
"I would imagine that the Networking
office has the right to look into an area of
traffic if there is a problem," Rikleen said.
"Other than that, there is no monitoring
that I know of. It's not easy to tell what
people are getting. Even if you can tell
that people are using Kazaa, you can't tell

if the content is legal or not."
Despite Rikleen's claim that the Uni
versity cannot monitor content being
downloaded, Head of Residential Com
puting Rich Holeton noted that Stanford
actively looks for illegal content. Under
the University's policy, students must fol
low all relevant laws, including the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. This means
that they are not supposed to have unli
censed files 011 their computers.
According to Holeton, the University
engages in a form of content control that
distinguishes between academic uses and
entertainment uses of computers.
"A technology called 'traffic shaping' is
used to prioritize, i.e., give more of the
available bandwidth to, what Networking
has determined to be 'academic' related
traffic — Web, e-mail — as opposed to
'entertainment' traffic [such as peer-to
peer, or P2P] file sharing," 1 foleton said.
"Personally, I find this distinction to
be spurious and somewhat arbitrary, and
I think that traffic shaping is a techno
logical euphemism for 'content control,'
" he added. "Further, I think that a poli
cy that de facto 'shapes' or controls con
tent should be debated and decided by
the faculty and students of the Universi
ty, not alone by a staff department that
administers and maintains the infra
structure."
I lowever, I loleton acknowledged that
