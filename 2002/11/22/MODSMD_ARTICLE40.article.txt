# Cal's season has been full of surprises, success

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Prior to this season, few would have expect
ed thatCal would bean 11-point favorite head
ing into tomorrow's Big Game at Memorial
Stadium. Cal, after all, was picked in the media
poll to finish dead last in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence by a wide margin, while Stanford was
pegged a lofty seventh. Cal hasn't won the Big
Game since 1994, and this year figured to be
no different.
From the beginning, though, things didn't
go as expected in Berkeley. First-year head
coach Jeff Tedford opened his Cal career with
a bang, as the Bears dropped 70 points on hap
less Baylor, rolled past New Mexico State, and
then rolled into East Lansing and beat then-No.
15 Michigan State, 46-22.
In just three games, Cal had gone from
being picked the worst team in the conference
to being ranked No. 23 in the country.
"We know we have the athletes to play with
anybody in the country," wide receiver
Lashaun Ward said at the time. "Our coaching
staff has told us that, and we're all believers."
After their triumph against the Spartans —
the high point of the Bears' season, barring a
Big Game win — Cal came back to earth, losing
to both Air Force 23-21 and Washington State
48-38, in Berkeley.
Cal has been competitive since then, beating

Washington, UCIA and Arizona State while
losing to Southern California, Oregon State
and Arizona, en route to its current 6-5 record,
including 3-4 in conference.
Last weekend's loss to Arizona — which had
been the only winless team in the Pac-10, as well
as the only conference team Stanford has man
aged to beat so far this year — raised some con
cerns, though, heading into Big Game.
Because of NCAA sanctions related to unau
thorized hotel charges and academic: fraud Ix'-
tween 1997 and 2001, Cal is ineligible to go to a
bowl game, just like the 2-8 CCardinal (1-6 Pac -10).
So, for the Bears, tomorrow's Big Game is
their bowl game.
Cal is lead by senior quarterback Kyle Boiler,
who has finally lived up to expectations, throw
ing for 2,627 yards and 26 touchdowns against
just nine interceptions. Senior tailback Joe
Igber isn't asked to carry the team as much as
he was last year, but he is averaging 4.2 yards
per carry and 82.2 yards per game as the team's
lone ballcarrier, while catching 31 passes and
scoring nine touchdowns.
Boiler doesn't really have a favorite target, as
five Golden Bears have more than 30 pass re
ceptions this year, but senior Lashaun Ward is
the game-breaking threat, averaging 17.7
yards per catch. Ward, wideout Jonathan
Makonnen and tight end Tom Swoboda all
have seven TD catches on the year.
Cal's offense is in fact the top scoring offense

in ilic Pac-10, averaging 36. 1 points per game.
This year, Cal once again lias excellent spe
cial teams all around, and has returned both a
kit koil and a punt for touchdowns.
The defense starts a whopping nine seniors.
In addition to a pass rush led by standout de
fensive end Tully Banta-C lain, who has 12 sacks
and 20 tackles fora loss this season, the Bears
have had good play from their linebackers.
That effort is lead by Marcus Daniels (6(5 tack
les) and Matt Nixon (56 tackles, 3.5 sacks and
one interception which he returned a full 100
yards fora score).
(lal's vulnerability is its secondary, which
ranks last in tin* Pac-10, yielding 289 yards per
game. However, cornerback Jemeel Powell,
who lias five interceptions on the year, is an im
pact player and safety Bert Watts lias proven
adept at chasing down errant receivers, accu
mulating 74 tackles.
Though this season lias been a pleasant sur
prise for the Cal faithful, much judgment will
be withheld until after Big Game, by which time
(lal hopes to have put the crowning touch on a
solid season.
" I understand it's really big," Tedford said of
Big Game. "1 know our players are looking for
ward to it very much."
After all, it's been a nice ride for Cal, but
without bringing the Axe back home to Berke
ley, there would still be plenty of disappoint
ment across the Bay.
