# Moore shines in '50s melodrama
## 
### HART GILULA 
Beneath the shimmering, Technicol
or glimmer of cocktail parties and fresh
ly manicured lawns, something unusual
is afoot in Hartford, Connecticut. At
least, one surmises as much just minutes
into Todd Haynes' viscerally simmering

new film, "Far From Heaven."
Julianne Moore, who

previously teamed with
Haynes in 1995's "Safe,"
plays Cathy Whitaker, the
quintessential homemaker
whose world crumbles
after she discovers her hus
band Frank (Dennis
Quaid) in the arms of an
other man. As Cathy's life

inexorably begins to unravel, she be
friends her African-American gardener
Raymond Deagen (Dennis Haysbert).
Raymond turns out to be sensitive, kind
and cultured: everything 1950s Hartford
doesn't want a black man to be.
Cathy's world embodies the life you
might expect of a cinematic housewife in
1950s suburban New England. Her
weeks are characterized by grocery lists
and carpool duties. Her social circle is
comprised of women who dote on dar
ling new hairstyles and rave about social
functions while they rabidly devour the
town's most vicious gossip.
As Frank grows more distant, Cathy
spends more time with Raymond, enjoy

ing insightful conversation and a sense of
companionship. Of course, as soon as the
gossip mill learns of the friendship, the
town utters a collective gasp. Cathy must
fend off cutting remarks and subtle
sneers from her former social circle.
"Far From Heaven" offers a frank ex
amination ofhomosexualitvand interra-

cial relationships in an era that
shunned such taboos. Haynes

manages this without undermin-

ing these universally human
questions; the 1950s scenario
never overwhelms the con
temporary relevance of the
film's messages. Haynes has
mentioned the deep influ
ence of the great Douglas Sirk

on this film, and the Sirk in-

fluence is indeed everywhere.
Most closely related to Sirk's "All that
Heaven Allows," Haynes' film does not
simply reconstruct Sirk's style; he creates a
respectfully reverential film without being
derivative. Many of the Sirk elements are
there: The mysteriously handsome gar
dener (who is the Caucasian Rock Hudson
in Sirk's "Heaven"), the overbearing best
friend and the pair of unctuous children.
Haynes' women adopt all of the affecta
tions and mannerisms of the women in
Sirk films, right down to the little courtesy
chuckles and patter-style socialite gossip.
Ultimately, though, "Far From Heaven"
stands on its own.
Technically speaking, the film is ex

hilarating. Haynes emulates Sirk's lan
guid pans and tracking shots. Editor
James Lyons gorgeously crossfades from
one scene to die next, skillfully matching
the final hues of one scene with the color
scheme of the next. Composer Elmer
Bernstein uses a similar crossfade effect
to transition from one sweeping orches
tral motive to the next. The consummate
production and costume design provide
the fertile foundation for the film's mas
terful exposition.
"Far From Heaven" is a brilliantly
conceived film. It is well written, skillful

ly directed, beautifully shot, fastidiously
edited and well acted — everything most
movies are not. It tackles major social is
sues without straying from the intimacy
of its subject. The performances are all
outstanding — Moore's in particular. In
coming to grips with her town's racism,
Cathy asks Raymond, "Do you even
think we ever really do? See beyond the
surface of things?" As Todd Haynes deft
ly proves in his latest film, yes, we most
certainly do.
