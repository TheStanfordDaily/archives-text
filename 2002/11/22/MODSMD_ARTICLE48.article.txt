# Leigh depicts brutally honest portrait of family life
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
"All or Nothing," the latest film from
British writer/.director Mike Leigh ("Se
crets &: Lies," "Topsy-Turvy") is in many
ways a formulaic drama about the miseries
of working-class life. You know the story
— friends and family are beaten down by
the hardscrabble life they live, only to re
discover their love for one another in a
time of crisis. But there are moments
when the movie — particularly its actors

— transcends the melodramatic formula,
astonishing us with its empathy and depth
of feeling.
"All or Nothing" tells the story of the
Bassett family and its neighbors, all of
them poor and unhappy. The title proba
bly refers to a remark made by taxi driver
Phil Bassett (Timothy Spall) to a passen
ger: "Funny innit? Love —if you're not to
gether, you're alone." If, as Phil proposes,
love is an all-or-nothing proposition, it
would seem that he and his wife Pennv

(Lesley Manville) have nothing. Penny ei
ther chastises Phil for his laziness or looks
at him with resigned disapproval, while
Phil sits mute as their son Rory (James
Corden) heaps endless verbal abuse on
Penny. Rounding out the family is Rachel
(Alison Garland), a quiet daughter who
spends most of her time reading.
At times, "All or Nothing's" script feels
disappointingly underdeveloped. Among
the supporting cast are caricatures drawn
with embarrassing broadness, particularly
the boozy Carol (Marion Bailey) and the
whacko Craig (Ben Crompton). Not that
every character has to be fully

fleshed out, but given how
annoying and unnecessary i
these characters often are,
one can't help but wonder
why Leigh didn't eliminate
them or drastically cut their
presence so that he could
focus on the Bassetts' story.
Leigh also has a tendency
to pile misfortune after mis-

fortune upon his characters, defying both
plausibility and dramatic good sense. For
example, the film's conclusion includes a
subplot involving a turned-offcell phone
that comes oft as both unlikely and dis
tracting from the central emotional
dilemma; I couldn't help but feel that had
Leigh not been bent on making his char
acters suffer as much as possible — before
ihe redemptive ending, of course — the
whole thing could have been dropped.
Equally guilty is the numbingly weepy
score by Andrew Dickson, its brooding
cello eager to emphasize the misery in a
scene even when none is present.

However, the script does, at times,
overcome this "bring on the pain" mental
ity and offer more perceptive ideas. At its
best, "All or Nothing" doesn't blame its
characters' unhappiness entirely on fate or
on the people themselves, instead believ
ing that they could be happy if they want
ed to — it's just that they've become so
worn down by their lives that they haven't
the energy left for love or optimism. When
Leigh actually allows hope to shine
through, the joy feels earned and real.
Ihe wonderful performances that

Leigh gets out of his stronger
actors are what truly redeem
the film. Standouts include
Manville, whose Penny has
seen heartbreak but is deter
mined to make it through,
and Ruth Sheen, whose Mau
reen hides a fierce, protective
love behind a sharp sense of
humor. There's something
nearly transcendent about
the way Sheen throws off her

worries at a karaoke bar as she sings
"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue."
As dictated by its family-melodrama
formula, "All or Nothing" ends with a
tragedy, leading to a momentous scene be
tween Phil and Penny as their frustrations
come pouring out. That scene alone justi
fies all the mistakes Leigh made in the pre
vious two hours. Spall's performance is a
blubbery masterpiece; any possibility of
going over the top is eliminated by the ex
traordinary empathy that the actor brings
to Phil and his loneliness; every stuttered
line that Phil speaks is a heartbreaker, and
I felt every sob that wracked his body.
