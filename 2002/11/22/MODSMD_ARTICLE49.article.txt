# Could you handle the Brazilian?
## 
### JENNIE KIM 
I am lying on my back, naked from the waist
down, while a petite Vietnamese woman
smears hot wax onto my butt crack. I don't
think this is what my mom envisioned when I
told her I was spending the afternoon doing
journalistic research.
I have always wondered what compels
women to wax what my friend from Kentucky
affectionately refers to as "the cooter." After
coming to grips with the harsh reality that after
I get a Brazilian bikini wax there will be nothing
left to wax, I'm now prepared to find out first
hand. 1 ponder the good people of Brazil —
sure their economy is struggling, but all the
women must be glisteningly hairless.

Hannah, my esthetician at La Belle
Day Spa, is not one to be shy. Sec-

onds after our initial hand
shake, she's inspecting my
pubic hair with her fingertips.
"You're lucky," she says. "Not

too much hair, so it hurts less.
Because we're Asian, you
know?" This comforts me a lit
tle as I situate myself awkwardly
on a bench covered in paper
towels.

After aiming a bright halogen
spotlight on my crotch, Hannah gets

to work and dusts a generous amount of
baby powder on the area to be waxed to

prevent it from sticking. I feel like a giant cup
cake. She bends my knees outward to separate
my legs and positions my hands to hold my skin
taut while she waxes. "Really like teamwork!"
she says cheerily. She spatulas warm wax
against my skin, briskly smoothes a cloth strip
on it, and then ... Rriiiiip!
My pain threshold registers a moderate 7 on
the "Whoa, Nelly!" scale at first while Hannah
waxes my bikini line. Then she moves inward,
and the hurt goes off the chart. By the final two
rriiiiips, I feel an intense pain that is best de
scribed as a mixture of "HOLYMOTHEROF
GOD" and "AAIIIEEEEEEEH!"
fhe waxing process takes 20 agony-filled
minutes. Afterward, Hannah and I chat while
she applies a soothing cream to my traumatized
skin. She says that she's been working here for
a while, but just began doing Brazilians last year
when they became really popular and the salon
decided to offer them.
1 ask her if it was weird at first.
"I HATED it!" she replies emphatically. "You

know, soooo gross!" I can't help but feel a lit
tle guilty. It doesn't seem fair that she is ex
pected to wax dozens of vaginas a month
("Much, much more in summertime!") just
because it's some freaky trend. I'm reminded
of the time I encountered a misplaced print of
Frida Kahlo's "My Birth" while browsing
through the Impressionist section at a muse
um gift shop. Hannah probably began work
ing at posh La Belle thinking it would be all
blurry pastel haystacks, but got hit with a
screaming dose of genitalia as soon as "Sex
and the City" went mainstream.
She says 1 must be doing this for my
boyfriend. I consider lying and just saying yes,
but decide to be honest and tell her I don't even
have a boyfriend, but that this is actually a story

assignment for The Daily. "Really?" she
says incredulously, as she plucks a

stray hair (ouch!). "No, wait, re
ally? Wow. All women usually
| do it for the guy," she informs
me.

Hannah confirms my
suspicion that this, like many
other instances of self-inflicted
pain, is really all about sex.

Ironically, one of the original
functions of pubic hair was sup-

posedly to increase a woman's sexual
attractiveness by trapping her scent,

making a caveman lust even more for
her. But, as the popularity of the Brazilian

proves, this method has long since been ren
dered obsolete; apparently alcohol is now con
sidered to be far superior when trying to attract
men to your vagina.
fhe bill comes to $75, and I leave Hannah a
$20 tip. 1 feel very close to her by this point,
telling myself that we shared an intimate expe
rience, this "teamwork." Plus, the pain has left
me in a daze. I'm in no state to calculate what
15-20% would be.
1 don't get the chance to fully appreciate the
thoroughness of the wax until 1 get home.
Looking at myself in the mirror, 1 realize with
shock that 1 look like a 9-year-old and with
greater shock that I sort of like it — it's the
most squeaky-clean kind of kinky. I must
admit, fora girl who regularly disinfects her
doorknob, going completely bare definitely
has an aesthetic appeal. Maybe when it comes
to this extreme maintenance, women are
mostly motivated by "the guy," but it's nice to
know that there's something in it, pain and all,
for ourselves too.



Envy or pity Hannah, this is whaf she sees every day at work
