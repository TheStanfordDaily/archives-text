# Fisk decries U.S. media bias in Mideast
## 
### ALEX BLEYLEBEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Addressing an overflowing auditorium in Building
400 yesterday afternoon, Britain's most decorated
journalist criticized several aspects of Western media,
calling upon his audience to question the information
spread by a biased press.
In a talk entitled "War and Peace," Robert Fisk, for
eign correspondent for the Independent, a London
newspaper, drew from his personal experiences in
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and the Middle East to argue
that Westerners get a tainted picture of current events
when they receive their news.
Paul George of the Peninsula Peace and Justice ('.en
ter introduced Fisk by saying that his reporting "is des
perately needed oxygen for those of us who are suffo
cating under a constant barrage of misinformation, dis
information, media bias, blather and just plain sloppy
journalism."
Fisk began his talk by proclaiming, "Sept. 11 did not
change the world," and spent most of his talk challeng
ing many assumptions that Western journalists habitu
ally take for granted when they report about events in
the Middle East.
"This has become one of the outstanding, danger
ous lies that journalists have propagated," he said
about the role of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001
in President George W. Bush's War on Terrorism.
"Sept. 11 may have given George W. Bush an excuse to

take action, but that should be ex
posed lor what ii really is: a manip
ulation of grief and lear in order to
start a war that has nothing to do
with the international crimes
against humanity which took place
in New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania."
I o show the bias behind media
coverage from the Middle East,
Fisk drew most of his examples
from the conflict with Iraq, the
U.S. war in Afghanistan, and
American biases in favor of Israel.
Fisk, who has interviewed Osama
bin Laden three times and is the
longest-serving Western journalist
in tlie Middle East, argued that
while Western media get most of
the I acts correct, they blatantly
refuse to report on the actual caus
es of conflicts.
"1 hate 'what' and 'where' sto
ries without the 'why'," he said.
Fisk criticized a media which re

ports daily about terrorism com
mitted by Muslims and anti-Amer
ican sentiment without revealing
why these sentiments are present
in Aral) world.
I Je turned blameoll the United
States lor sparking anti-Western
hatred in the region and lor the
power of Osama bin Laden. Bin
Laden's power rests not with his
actions, Fisk said, but with his
words. II the United States had
acted more intelligently in tlu*
Middle East in the past, then bin
Laden would be "nothing but a
voice in a Ibrest" and would not
have such a strong following.
Fisk was in Afghanistan last
year when he was badly beaten
after his car broke down. I le chal
lenged media coverage of the U.S.
bombing of that nation, arguing
that it makes almost no mention of
thousands of innocent civilians
killed in a campaign that is much
less successful than U.S. govern
ment officials say.
Fisk also questioned the Bush
administration's seemingly sud
den shift in focus away from

Afghanistan and toward Iraq, say
ingthat Iraq should have "nothing
at all" to do with (Ik* United States'
stated purpose of hunting terror
ism around the world. I fe went on
to criticize the press for not ques
tioning this shift in policy.
"1 think the problem here in
America is that a journalist who
starts to seriously question his
country's foreign policy at a time of
crisis — the very moment he
should question it — will find that
his access [to government officials
and other sources] is cut off," he
said. "And then he will find that
perhaps that he's regarded as in
some way subversive for question
ing U.S. foreign policy."
lisk flatly dismissed the War
on Terrorism and the stated hu
manitarian goals of a war in Iraq
as examples of an American
media machine that is merely "an
extension" of the administration's
press service.
"This is a war not on terror, but
a war against America's enemies,
and most probably against those of
Israel also," he said.

Among Fisk's other criticisms
about Western policy in the Mid
dle East was the biased coverage
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
He argued that Palestinian vio
lence is much more likely to be re
ported as an act of "terrorism,"
while bloodier Israeli violence has
often been justified as state mili
tary action. He also harped on
standard media vocabulary that
portrays Israeli actions in a more
favorable way.
As a part of his presentation,
Fisk showed clips of a documen
tary that he made about Israeli
settlements in the West Hank. In
it, he visits a Palestinian family
soon to be displaced by Israeli
construction.
Fisk said that the purpose of his
talk was to illuminate the biases in
Western media coverage in the
Middle East and to present an out
side view.
The main problem "is about the
dangers now posed to journalism
itself, the silent and unquestioning
acceptance of authority, and the
trite, bland and deeply deceiving

government statements which are
inherited by the neglect <>l hun
dreds of headlines," he s.ii<l.
Reactions to his speech were
strong, with most lauding Fisk's
fresh lake on < ui rent events.
"It's a much-needed perspec
tive," said klialil liarhoum, a lec
turer and (lie coordinator ol the
African and Middle Eastern Lan
guages and Literatures program
at Stanford. Karhouin said that
Fisk's talk demonstrated the "dou
ble standard in our policy in the
Middle East and the hypocrisy that
characterizes our treatment ol
Iraq on the one hand and Israel on
the other."
"()ne of Our goals is to sponsor
critical dialog and clitical thoughts
about what is going on in Ameri
can foreign policy, said senior
Calvin Miaw, co-coordinator of the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice, a sponsor ol the event.
"One of the things that has been
demonstrated l>\ l isk is that these
mainstream media sources skew
fads and have a bias that is not just
erratic but deeply patterned."
