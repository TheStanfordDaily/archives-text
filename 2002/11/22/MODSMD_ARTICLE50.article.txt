# The
						Five Greatest Ethnic Foods You've Never Tried

An Ethiopian dinner is a truly communal experi
ence, in which patrons dine from a shared plate
of lentils, tomatoes, peas and finger germs. Al
ways hot, always risky — just the way we like it.
(Trust us on the riskiness factor: We have the pink
eye to prove it.) But be careful: If you look up
"Ethiopian" on Google (as beginners often do),
I you'll find yourself dining in the back room of a
gas station, drinking heroin-infused coffee
and watching bootlegged uipes of
CTmnnm kl traditional Ethiopian mating rituals.
EL liilUr Inll Instead, go to Red Sea, a quaint
spot nestled between pawn shops and
bail bond agencies in the bustling center
of lovely San Jose. The dining area is actu
ally the family living room, complete with gradua
tion portraits and trophies from the Simon Says Championship of
Ethiopia. Don't worry about not understanding the menu; no mat
ter what you order, you'll be served the same denture-friendly meal
of unidentifiable mush atop a soggy bed of sourdough pancakes.
You'll feel like part of the family — including the red-eyed son who
stumbles upon your dinner date at perhaps inopportune times. But
do not fear. Me just wants a tip. (Red Sea Restaurant, 684 N. Ist Street,
San Jose)
Perhaps the most ethnocultish restaurant on our list, Piccolo's
offers a very different dining experience to its Persian and
non-Persian patrons. Persians are escorted to a spacious,
well-lit dining room, where they are entertained by tradi
tional Persian belly-dancers and bar mitzvah-esque musicians (com
plete with synthesizer-created snake-charming sounds). Unfortu
nately, we've never seen it. As non-Persians, we often find ourselves

relegated to the basement boiler room,
constantly decorated with kitschy holi
day decorations to entertain us in the
absence of big-bellied exotic dancers to O
gawk at. Cal
Dining at Piccolo's may be a lengthy BrHfyiK k|
experience. The first part of the dinner I* »
is usually spent trying to decipher the
menu, although it does otter helpful Eng
lish translations, mostly consisting of ex
clamatory food personifications that could be
used to described a pigtailed child on a tricycle
(lovely! darling! rosy-cheeked!). Though the food
arrives rather quickly (always topped with a raw egg, despite pleas
to leave it out), it takes several dozen requests before a check arrives
at the table. Late on Saturday nights, the restaurant fills with sweet,
weathered Persian men and misogynistic college boys smoking
apple-flavored tobacco from hookahs and forgetting this isn't a strip
joint.

Although Singapore
may not seem like an exotic eth
nicity to those of us on
the Stanford campus, fij
we must remember that as an gj
island city 0f4.2 million peo- niPin ■? Jl if
pie, Singapore represents alNuAPuKEftri
less than one one-thou
sandth of the world's popu
lation, making it exotic in all
other contexts. For those not on a
Straits Cafe budget (and / or not in the mood to dine with Screw
Your Sib attendees), Shiok! is a perfect alternative. The direct trans
lation of "Shiok!" is ambiguous — depending on who you ask, it

could mean either sex, delicious or delicious sex. We'll take all three,
especially if served with the restaurant's famous roti paratha, an or
gasmic dish of flaky, buttery flatbread that drips from the plate like
an exploded croissant. Unrestrained consumption may lead to
stomach ailments; a roll of Turns is recommended as dessert. Still,
Shiok! is the perfect place to get in touch with the culture of room
mates, neighbors, econ TAs and / or random Flo Mo residents.

W auhini: So, Dana, what shall we
do for your 20th birthday? I
think if I call right now, I can .
still get a reservation for our 50 mJm
closest friends at Celia's or Beppo's. &mmmw
Dana: Gee, 1 don't think we have that
many friends. How about an intimate
dinner at my grandmother's house, in
stead? I really miss her voice serenading
me with traditional Polish birthday wishes:
Stolat, stolat...
Vauhini: But, Dana! Your grandmother lives over 3,000 miles
away — and the "entertainment" we hired for the occasion might
get grams a little too excited. How about going out to dinner at Old
Krakow House, a traditional, family-owned Polish tavern that
serves fresh Polish delicacies amidst artwork by local Polish artists.
I'm sure they'd be happy to sing Stolat ad nauseum.
Forget Celia's; Old Krakow House is the ideal location fora birth
day dinner. Prepared to road-trip to L.A. for our feast, we were ec
static to discover this gem in the heart of San Francisco's Old Poland
district (shrinking quickly at the borders of a growing Chinatown).
Although his vocabulary is limited, the fresh-cheeked boy-host will
be glad to assure you in English that his grandmother's pierogies
are, quote, "the best in town."
Dana: Do you serve pierogies?
Boy-host: We have the best pierogies in town.

Dana: Do they contain cheese?
Boy-host: We have the best pierogies in town.
Dana: My large intestine is hemorrhaging from accidental inges
tion of dairy products. Where is the bathroom?
Boy-host: We have the best pierogies in town.
Dana: I'm dying.
Boy-host's grandma: Eat your damn pierogies!
Vauhini: Stolat!

jWßßlhe Boss puts it best when he sings,
I £ | "Meet me at Mary's Place / It's gonna
I be a party." Mary's Place is an obvi
ous reference to the classic New Jer- fIF RltiFY
sey diner. Bruce would hang his head in *
shame if he learned that the Denny's on El
Camino is Palo Alto's only substitute for the Tic-
Toc on Route 3 — but for the Jersey half of
us, it's all we've got. We miss Bertha,
with her portly build, gravely smoker
voice and tendency to pinch our
cheeks as she pulls a chewed Bic out
from her leathery cleavage. But on
some nights, unwinding in a booth after
gyrating our pelvises on sticky dance floors for
hours, we are so dizzy that we can almost smell
Bertha's Aquanet wafting through the thick, greasy air.
On those nights, we feel as though we are back at home, watch
ing as Bertha attends to throngs of drama kids who sit at her tables
for hours before leaving pennies in smiley-face formations on the
Formica tabletop. We resent the spread of globalized chain diners
and their proliferation outside the Garden State, but as much as we
hate to admit it, the Original Grand Slam Breakfast almost tastes like
home.
