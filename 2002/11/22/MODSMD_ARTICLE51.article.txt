# FROM SAN JOSE TO BERKELEY: THE BAY AREA'S BEST RECORD STORES
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
You can think of music shopping as follows:
Buying music at a chain store is tantamount to
going to Taco Bell in search of real Mexican
food when a respectable family-Owned tacque- ;
ria serving delicious Mexican goodness is right down the
street.
The land of Palo Alto is shamelessly bereft of suitable
record stores. To the north on El Camino lies Where
house and to the south lies Tower, but neither of these
is satisfactory for the discerning music buyer. For one
thing, both lack any significant used music section. That
means that if you are seeking an out-of-print album,
enjoy digging for CDs or are simply looking fora great
deal, you're out of luck.
Additionally, large chain record stores are imperson
al. These places make their money selling new Celine
Dion albums to middle-aged suburbanites and the
Justin Timberlake solo album to those suburbanites'
kids. In high sch(X)l, 1 knew a girl working at Where
house who didn't know who the Ramones were and
couldn't tell the difference between Marvin Gaye and
James Brown.
In the spirit of helping distinguished music lovers at

Stanford find their way, here are some of the Bay Area's finest record
stores, from Berkeley all the way to San Jose. Are some of these places
far? Yes. But if yon have a car and can get to Menlo Park, yon can
spare 20 minutes on 280 and get to San Jose. En joy your specialty fish
tacos kids.
Street lighl Records CAN IfICE
980 S Bascom Ave wHII IIUwE
This place strikes you a bit like a maze at first. Most of the music is
arranged in diagonal rows and can seem confusing at first. However,
Streetlight in San Jose offers a relatively large selection of music in a

store whose size is not intimidating. The country, reggae and vinyl
sections were extensive, and the staff is extremely friendly and happy
to dispense advice. Perhaps the only drawback is that the used CDs
are typically mixed in with the new ones, which am give you a skewed
sense of what die store's used selection looks like. On the other hand,
this also means that you don't have to search through two sections of
CDs. There are also Streetlight locations in San Francisco and Santa
Cruz.
Rasputin Musk
1820 S Bascom Ave
Technically in Campbell, this store is just a mile or so south of

Streetlight Records. Rasputin is a locally-owned Bay
Area chain with other stores in Pleasant Hill, Berkeley,
San Lorenzo and San Francisco. The Campbell store is
extremely large with generally terrific musical offerings.
Given its size, however, it provides less personable an at
mosphere. Additionally, the international music section
in Campbell is terribly lacking. Compared with its sister
store in Berkeley, Campbell's international section is
downright pathetic. There is a pretty decent selection of
used DVDs though, a neat section of old 7" records for
a dollar each and a respectable hip hop section.
Hear Music PAS ft IIITf)
Stanford Shopping Center I HLII ML I U
Hear Music is pretty hit-or-miss. Though it general
ly caters to the mall crowd, it occasionally stocks obscure
gems. A big advantage is that you can generally listen to
a lot of the music before buying it. The downside is that
the store's prices tend to be comparatively high, which is
predictable fora store in the Stanford Shopping Center.

Amoeba Musk OpH lIOP
1855 Haight St i ilMlilriOyU
This is the big daddy of Bay Area record stores. Though there
is also a Berkeley store (which is impressive in its own right), the
San Francisco store holds claim to the biggest and widest selection
of music anywhere. I once paid a visit with a group of friends
where one walked away with several classic Bach performances
on 12" vinyl. Another bought a box set of Ravi Shankar CDs. And
I came away with Otis Redding's "Dictionary of Soul" and an im
port release by Sudanese musician Abdel Gadir Salim. Hell yeah.
Aquarius Records
1055 Valencia St (at 22nd)
Located in the Mission, Aquarius is beloved for its character and

coziness. The selection is admit
tedly small and will appeal al
most exclusively to an avant
garde crowd. Nonetheless,
most of the new releases have

an attached review written by a
store staff member.
The experimental section is
huge — there was a CD with 92
tracks of frogs making frog
sounds in their natural environ
ments — and there are sizable of
ferings in electronic music as well
However, more mainstream cus

tomers may definitely be alienated by
the snotty attitude here; for example, 1 read a review of The
Faint's latest album, "Danse Macabre," that said that it might not
be "very challenging for most Aquarius customers." Aquarius is
still worth a visit though if only because it is unique, even by Bay
Area standards.
Mod lutng REDVEI CY
2136 University Ave. (at Shattuck) DkIIAELE I
Mod Lang is a small little shop just a block away from the UC cam
pus and specializes in all things indie rock. The store is small, so you
won't find much in the way of hip hop, metal, international, jazz or
the like. But for what it offers, Mod Lang is great with a decently
friendly staff.
Funky Riddrns
2328 Boioditch St
Funky Riddms sells just that. The whole store is barely the size of
four dorm rooms, and its stock consists almost entirely of vinyl — in
dependent hip hop, dance hall imports and electronica. You likely
won't spend much time here, but the store owner is exceedingly kind
and generous with his knowledge. And you can listen to anything in
the store while you're shopping there.

1055 Valencia St (at 22nd)
Located in the Mission, Aquarius is beloved for its character and

coziness. The selection is admit
tedly small and will appeal al
most exclusively to an avant
garde crowd. Nonetheless,
most of the new releases have

an attached review written by a
store staff member.
The experimental section is
huge — there was a CD with 92
tracks of frogs making frog
sounds in their natural environ
ments — and there are sizable of
ferings in electronic music as well
However, more mainstream cus

tomers may definitely be alienated by
the snotty attitude here; for example, 1 read a review of The
Faint's latest album, "Danse Macabre," that said that it might not
be "very challenging for most Aquarius customers." Aquarius is
still worth a visit though if only because it is unique, even by Bay
Area standards.

Mod Lang is a small little shop just a block away from the UC cam
pus and specializes in all things indie rock. The store is small, so you
won't find much in the way of hip hop, metal, international, jazz or
the like. But for what it offers, Mod Lang is great with a decently
friendly staff.
Funky Riddrns
2328 Boioditch St
Funky Riddms sells just that. The whole store is barely the size of
four dorm rooms, and its stock consists almost entirely of vinyl — in
dependent hip hop, dance hall imports and electronica. You likely
won't spend much time here, but the store owner is exceedingly kind
and generous with his knowledge. And you can listen to anything in
the store while you're shopping there.


Shop away the pain at Amoeba Music in San Francisco!

You can think of music shopping as follows:
Buying music at a chain store is tantamount to
going to Taco Bell in search of real Mexican
food when a respectable family-Owned tacque- ;
ria serving delicious Mexican goodness is right down the
street.
The land of Palo Alto is shamelessly bereft of suitable
record stores. To the north on El Camino lies Where
house and to the south lies Tower, but neither of these
is satisfactory for the discerning music buyer. For one
thing, both lack any significant used music section. That
means that if you are seeking an out-of-print album,
enjoy digging for CDs or are simply looking fora great
deal, you're out of luck.
Additionally, large chain record stores are imperson
al. These places make their money selling new Celine
Dion albums to middle-aged suburbanites and the
Justin Timberlake solo album to those suburbanites'
kids. In high sch(X)l, 1 knew a girl working at Where
house who didn't know who the Ramones were and
couldn't tell the difference between Marvin Gaye and
James Brown.
In the spirit of helping distinguished music lovers at

Stanford find their way, here are some of the Bay Area's finest record
stores, from Berkeley all the way to San Jose. Are some of these places
far? Yes. But if yon have a car and can get to Menlo Park, yon can
spare 20 minutes on 280 and get to San Jose. En joy your specialty fish
tacos kids.
Street lighl Records CAN IfICE
980 S Bascom Ave wHII IIUwE
This place strikes you a bit like a maze at first. Most of the music is
arranged in diagonal rows and can seem confusing at first. However,
Streetlight in San Jose offers a relatively large selection of music in a

store whose size is not intimidating. The country, reggae and vinyl
sections were extensive, and the staff is extremely friendly and happy
to dispense advice. Perhaps the only drawback is that the used CDs
are typically mixed in with the new ones, which am give you a skewed
sense of what die store's used selection looks like. On the other hand,
this also means that you don't have to search through two sections of
CDs. There are also Streetlight locations in San Francisco and Santa
Cruz.
Rasputin Musk
1820 S Bascom Ave
Technically in Campbell, this store is just a mile or so south of

Streetlight Records. Rasputin is a locally-owned Bay
Area chain with other stores in Pleasant Hill, Berkeley,
San Lorenzo and San Francisco. The Campbell store is
extremely large with generally terrific musical offerings.
Given its size, however, it provides less personable an at
mosphere. Additionally, the international music section
in Campbell is terribly lacking. Compared with its sister
store in Berkeley, Campbell's international section is
downright pathetic. There is a pretty decent selection of
used DVDs though, a neat section of old 7" records for
a dollar each and a respectable hip hop section.

Hear Music is pretty hit-or-miss. Though it general
ly caters to the mall crowd, it occasionally stocks obscure
gems. A big advantage is that you can generally listen to
a lot of the music before buying it. The downside is that
the store's prices tend to be comparatively high, which is
predictable fora store in the Stanford Shopping Center.

This is the big daddy of Bay Area record stores. Though there
is also a Berkeley store (which is impressive in its own right), the
San Francisco store holds claim to the biggest and widest selection
of music anywhere. I once paid a visit with a group of friends
where one walked away with several classic Bach performances
on 12" vinyl. Another bought a box set of Ravi Shankar CDs. And
I came away with Otis Redding's "Dictionary of Soul" and an im
port release by Sudanese musician Abdel Gadir Salim. Hell yeah.
