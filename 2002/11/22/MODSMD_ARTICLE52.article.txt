# 'Frida': simplistic portrait of artist's complex life
## Less 'Frida,' more 'The Unibrow that Launched a Thousand Ships' 
### ERICK FLORES 
Unibrows, breasts and bright colors abound in Julie Taymor's
"Frida." Why the focus on the material and obscene and not on the
character and concept? Well, because in this roller coaster of a movie,
this is about all you take away from it. Because we're not talking about
the kind of ride that takes you on deep plunges with high rises, leav
ing you breathless; we're talking the kind that jolts and jerks you, pro
viding a thrill for some and motion sickness for others.
In case you have not vet guessed from the title, the movie tells the
story of Frida Kahlo, the mid-20th century Mexican artist most fa-

mous for the agony and intense simplicity
l of her paintings and self-portraits. The
film's focus, however, is decentralized

from the painter's actual work to the collective

experiences that inspired it. From the
opening credits, we are driven through
her paralyzing bus accident, escorted
through her on-the-rocks marriage with
artist Diego Rivera, guided through her
political entanglements and invited to
explore her feminist subversion and ex
plicit lesbian encounters.

Right now the filmmakers are delighting in the so-called compre
hensiveness they've given their film, and yet this may be "Frida's"
greatest weakness. The movie feels like a two-hour checklist of the
artist's life, only before the viewer actually gets to say "check," he's
forced into reading the next bulleted item. Too much breadth with
too little depth tarnishes this film in the same way it does other
biopics like "Ali." In the end, it feels as ample as a music video.
Undoubtedly, "Frida" has only the best intentions and some of
its unique moments can't be overlooked. An independent film with
an art house feel, the movie contains animated segments and comic

book-like montages reminiscent of "Moulin Rouge" or a quality
Peter Gabriel music video. And Salma Hayek, who beat out com
petitors like Jennifer Lopez and Madonna (yes, she was once

again trying to act), puts her full heart and soul into her role
and finally transcends her traditional typecasting as the hot,

accented Latina being pursed by the comedic white guy;
But even with all of Hayek's wit and independent

chica-ness, sometimes you can't help but long ft|tthe
typecast and stupid white guy package. With unbe
lievably corny lines like "Amor, tell me you love me"

preceding steamy sex scenes bet ween a petite Kahlo
and a husky Rivera, you can't help but snicker or
shudder away from what seems UKe a Discovery
Channel episode gone awry featuring mating be-

tween a mouse and an elephant.
