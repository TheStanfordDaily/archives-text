# Jewish MC raps on Russian literature, makes you hot

Holding a microphone and staring at the audi
ence, MC Paul Barman stands on a semi-lit stage, as
the spotlights shine on his pale face and mop of curly
hair. With a smirk and a crazyjump, Barman gets the

crowd rocking, throwing them
something they haven't seen since
K(k>1 Keith sampled Johann Pachel
bel. "What will we do when we have
our own kids? / Give them 12-year
bids after the bars come off the
cribs?" With an off-kilter vocal deliv-

er that teeters deliciously between unrhythmic chaos
and perfect syncopation, Barman makes his multi
faceted rhymes fit nicely between the funk of his DJ's
samples and the audience participation he so effec
tively involves.
After Barman graduated from Brown University
in 1997 and put out a demo of his material, produc
er Prince Paul (of KRS-One, De La Soul and
Gravediggaz fame) heard his unique style and put to
gether an EP with Barnum in 2000. Rolling Stone la
beled it as one of the year's best, and after a few shows,
Barman disappeared for two years, finally emerging
with a new full-length LP.
Barman's new album, "Paullelujah!", out on
Coup D'Etat records, picks up where his debut EP
left off. Dealing with the same cerebral subject ma
terial, the album runs its 44-minute gauntlet as Bar
man jumps in and out of such topics as the nature
of feminism, flatulence and his place in the current
state of hip hop as a Jewish kid from New Jersey.
The album starts out with a song that samples 1 lan
ders Alleljuah chorus, to which Barman sings along
loudly and off tune, substituting the original verse
with his own word, "Paullelujah!" "Cock Mobster,"
the album's single, is a list of celebrities Barman

would like to sleep with, while "Bleed
ing Brain-Grow" is a riff on the Read
ing Rainbow theme song.
One of the album's best songs, "Excuse

You," derives its sirenffh from its momen
turn and Barnun i|s self-analysis, dropping

tri tonometry references and \ ~
su h lines as "I can rock the mike
to silence by Jon Cage." In "Vul

tuje Shark Sculpture Park,"
a long about a nonexis- *

tent horror-park that
Banian admonish

es children to av< id, Barman raps,
"there's Hamsteriram to Amster
dam with a rol*-actional hobo
satchel perched on an ampersand.
. . watch a new-born gorilla dip a
blue corn tortilla chip."

"Paullelujah!" is not a perfect
album, reaching its peak around
track nine, and losing its momentum
as Barman explores folk-music story
telling and word jazz in the last few
tracks. Nevertheless, "Paul-

lelujah!" still holds its
own, through Bar-

man's intelligent
word-play and
Prince Paul's
jazzed-up pro- -4
duction. After ~
all, who can shut
down an MC *
whose "dandy

voice makes the most
anti-choice
panties moist?" 1
