# The 						hat keeps the talent in: 'Fish' unique, rewarding
## 
### BEN FRIEDLAND 
Badly Drawn Boy is an eccentric. The British song
smith— a.k.a. Damon Gough—combines an oddball
sense of humor with densely layered production to cre
ate inspired, unconventional indie-pop.
His new album "Have You Fed The Fish?" is addic
tive, weird, calculated, irreverent and fun, with songs
ranging from acoustic beauties to strange rockers to
overstated pop. With each track markedly different
from the last, Badly Drawn Boy turns concept on its
head, in favor of a style that is as rewarding and multidi
mensional as it is surprising.
Moreover, with so much song-to-song variety, "Have
You Fed The Fish?" risks sounding choppy and dis
jointed. But Cough's endearingly warm Nick Drake
meets-Beck vocals and his consistently catcjhy melodies
form the album's center, unifying even the inost dissim
ilar tracks.
Badly Drawn Boy demonstrated his compositional
quirks on his stunning 2000 debut, " Hie Hour of the Be
wilderbeast," which in its soft-spoken brilliance earned him
England's prestigious Mercury Prize. Last year, Gough
reached a wider audience with his soft-spoken, straightfor
ward soundtrack to the popular film "About A Boy."
However, this latest effort may succeed where his ear
lier albums failed: Neither produced a lasting, hit single.
"Have You Fed The Fish?" has at least three whirlwinds
that should send shock-waves throughout college radio
land.

On the title track, Gough transforms slick piano
and sappy lyrics (" The keys to your heart open the
door to the world .. .") into a silly, over-the-top
anthem. The song's chorus: "Have you fed the fish
today; have you made your wish today?" — ap
parently the first questions Gongli and his wife ask
each other in the morning — recalls U2 in its sing-

I along drama.
: The album's first single "You Were Right" features
a catchy riff and memorable melody before adding
gimmicky lyrics and strings. The song received the
most pre-release hype for its fictional account of the
songwriter's refusal to date Madonna and its refer
ences to the deaths of Kurt C.obain, John Lennon and
I Jeff Buckle\. Despite the hype, the song — like tKe en
tire album — transforms simple folk into a larger
than-life epic.
Badly Drawn Boy explores his funkier side on the
album's finest track "40 Days 40 Fights." ()n top of yet an
other lingering melody, Gough thickens his vocals with
I back-up singers that make this song the catchiest yet. The
I rhythm section also shines here as they combine with
(Gough's acoustic picking fora head-moving groove.
Although less heartfelt than "The Hour of the Bewil
derbeast" and too reliant on studio intricacies, "Have
I You Fed the Fish?" keeps listeners off balance with its
| continual production variation. With his lyrical quirks,
p sophisticated melodies and recording vision, Badly
r Drawn Boy has established on this new album his place
| among indie music's elite.
