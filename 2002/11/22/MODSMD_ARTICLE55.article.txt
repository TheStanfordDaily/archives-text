# Whipped boys, escape your lady's cruel clutches!

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
So what are yon doing tonight?
"Oh, Booboo — that's what we call
each other — has an E4O problem set
due tomorrow, so we'll probably stay
in!" All, yes. This is an unfortunately
familiar scenario — a couple that is a
socially and emotionally self-con
tained entity. In Stanford parlance:
"Whipped."
Like I said, you know the story. Nor
mally, your best guy friend is always
down fora good time, and you count
on him as a confidant and someone
who's not too spastic and embarrassed
to go out dancing with you. One fateful
day, however, the smell of new pussy
and frescia body spray completely
tweaks his loyalty compass. Go out with
you on Saturday? No thanks; he'll
spend the night with his new lady
speeding through the bases. Not to say
that this is unreasonable most of the
time, but it's a problem when you never
see your former best friend anymore.
Naturally, girls are not immune,
usually being the other half of the cou
ple. I knew things had changed when
one of my girl friends began doing the
fucker's laundry after dating him for
two weeks.
Each week the kind folks here at

The Daily give me the podium on In
termission's back page, and today es
pecially, I intend on preaching. So
keep reading, oh knowledge-thirsty
Stanford student. This isn't the type of
sermon you're likely to read again
anytime soon. Roxy's job is to teach
the Stanford faithful that which they
do not know, so pay close attention.
First, let's confront the obvious fact
that we're in college and the chances
of this new gig working out for your
friend and his skank are slim-to-none.
When someone is willing to drop a
friendship that quickly, it should be a
big loud warning to you.
Ultimately, it should not be too
much to ask people to balance their
new flowery romance with the rela
tionships they've spent a couple of
months (for you firosh) or years (for
the upperclassmen) cultivating. Guys
and gals who fall into these types of re
lationships are either incredibly selfish
or incredibly needy people.
It sure seems like college is the right
time to try to develop an adult rela
tionship — or in some cases, many
adult relationships — but to put it
bluntly, a person who is whipped is
not in a healthy adult relationship.
If you're the one doing the whip
ping, you are simply exploiting anoth
er person. And if you're the one being

whipped, you should realize that your
emotional neediness is allowing some
one to take advantage of you. And if
it's mutual, you should realize that you
are fucking each other up. Why? Isn't
it love?
Please, children, don't make Roxy's
job any more frustrating than it needs
to be. Though it may come as a revela
tion, I will tell yon now that a person
who asks you to effectively give up
your life and friends does not really
care for you. Now, given my super
keen powers of perception, I've al
ready anticipated your next concern.
"I care so much about this person.
What if I never meet someone else
who makes me feel this way?"
Take the chance dear student; un
scrupulous assholes reside in many,
many parts of the world. Then sit back
and relax. Sure, you might not be
guaranteed sex fora while, and you
might grow close to that box of
Kleenex sitting on your desk. But hey,
at least you'll have regained your life
and the freedom. And that's what this
whole college thing was about in the
first place, right?

Have you been a bad boy lately? Ms. Sass
ivould love to dish out some scoldings.
