# Bryan Adams: Still a rock phenomenon somewhere
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
This is ninth in a series of articles called ' The
Record Sin'exploring classic albums from the past.
Recent studies about people's reactions
when confronted with this article's title have
revealed the following: A) 40 percent of read
ers believe they have chanced upon a piece of
evidence that the '80s were the most sordid
time for rock music. B) 15 percent think that
some bumbling idiot has misspelled Ryan. C)
45 percent shake their heads and reach the
conclusion that people with names such as
"Karan Mahajan" don't usually write about
rock music.
Well, they're usually right in one respect or
the other, but not here: Canadian rocker
Bryan Adams, contrary to popular belief, has
not retired, died or been launched preemp
tively into space with Lance Bass — instead,
he has shifted his vast net of pop-rock to cap
tive audiences in South Asia.
So, when you're in India, be politically cor
rect. Offer visitors a glass of tea, two spoons
full of sugar and ask them which Bryan
Adams album they'd like to hear. When you
go out to party, be sure to get yonr freak on to
the seminal "Summer of '69." Learn dedica
tion from these people who have stuck by
Adams through his highs and lows and really
lows. Memorize the song order of "So Far So
Good," learn to play air guitar to "18 Til I Die"
and admit that "Bryan Adams Unplugged" is
the best freaking album this side of Newport.
Okay, I'll shetl the pretense and be honest
— I love Brvan Adams. I always have. His

music was my first and best introduction to
rock and roll. Coming out and admitting this
love is no easy thing — my reputation as Ra
diohead-raving-Pavement-peddling alt-rock
fanboy now hangs tenuously like a certain
drop of hair gel on Ben Stiller's ear. (The
things 1 do for my country and its love of B
grade Bollywood style schmaltz!) In all truth,
Bryan Adams remains an awesome entertain
er. His last LP, "On A Day Like Today," which
spent two weeks on the despicably unsympa
thetic Billboard Charts, reigned the top of the
English Charts in New Delhi for nearly —
hold your breath — two years!
And why not? The album was a perfectly
subdued classic rock album, and if one were to
excuse the cliched earnestness of its love
songs, a potential hit. Gosh, Adams even em
ployed the supreme talent of Ms. Sporty
Spice! Yoo-hoo! I'll excuse that because the
mellow "How Do Ya Feel Tonight" is my fa
vorite song of all time. I can guarantee you
will not get bored of this album. I can't guar
antee that you'll find it in stores in America.
So, why do people in India and all of South
Asia and the rest of the world minus the big
pretentious continent of North America love
Bryan Adams? Answer: He's remained true
to his message of entertaining people, and
this message has found resonance in the
hearts of listeners who aren't obsessed with

catharsis or some silly rockstar attitude.
Besides, few modern entertainers have
learnt the execution of the "cheesy-love
song-that-grabs-your-balls" as well as this
boyish leather-jacketeer, and even fewer
rock stars have had the pure gall (or stupid
ity, whichever way you look at it) to pull off
something like "I Wanna Be (Your Under
wear)" in the post-Nirvana era. And we In
dians love sentiment and underwear (we
also love the Vengaboyz and Aqua, but
that's immaterial).
Clearly then, from the U.S. perspective,

Adams' biggest mistake was that he refused to
become a movie star (Bon Jovi anyone?), that
he didn't date a woman with extra-large
breasts and a reality show of her own, that lie
ill-advisedly moved to England from that ver
itable center of the world, Canada, and final
ly, that he didn't sport a mullet or promote a
hairstyle (Bon Jovi, anyone?).
What he did do was study demography
and pick the subcontinent with the fastest
growing population to breed the next gener
ation of mellow-dramatic rock fans: Yes,
Bryan Adams will rise yet again!

So, when you're in India, be politically cor
rect. Offer visitors a glass of tea, two spoons
full of sugar and ask them which Bryan
Adams album they'd like to hear. When you
go out to party, be sure to get yonr freak on to
the seminal "Summer of '69." Learn dedica
tion from these people who have stuck by
Adams through his highs and lows and really
lows. Memorize the song order of "So Far So
Good," learn to play air guitar to "18 Til I Die"
and admit that "Bryan Adams Unplugged" is
the best freaking album this side of Newport.
Okay, I'll shetl the pretense and be honest
— I love Brvan Adams. I always have. His

music was my first and best introduction to
rock and roll. Coming out and admitting this
love is no easy thing — my reputation as Ra
diohead-raving-Pavement-peddling alt-rock
fanboy now hangs tenuously like a certain
drop of hair gel on Ben Stiller's ear. (The
things 1 do for my country and its love of B
grade Bollywood style schmaltz!) In all truth,
Bryan Adams remains an awesome entertain
er. His last LP, "On A Day Like Today," which
spent two weeks on the despicably unsympa
thetic Billboard Charts, reigned the top of the
English Charts in New Delhi for nearly —
hold your breath — two years!
And why not? The album was a perfectly
subdued classic rock album, and if one were to
excuse the cliched earnestness of its love
songs, a potential hit. Gosh, Adams even em
ployed the supreme talent of Ms. Sporty
Spice! Yoo-hoo! I'll excuse that because the
mellow "How Do Ya Feel Tonight" is my fa
vorite song of all time. I can guarantee you
will not get bored of this album. I can't guar
antee that you'll find it in stores in America.
So, why do people in India and all of South
Asia and the rest of the world minus the big
pretentious continent of North America love
Bryan Adams? Answer: He's remained true
to his message of entertaining people, and
this message has found resonance in the
hearts of listeners who aren't obsessed with

catharsis or some silly rockstar attitude.
Besides, few modern entertainers have
learnt the execution of the "cheesy-love
song-that-grabs-your-balls" as well as this
boyish leather-jacketeer, and even fewer
rock stars have had the pure gall (or stupid
ity, whichever way you look at it) to pull off
something like "I Wanna Be (Your Under
wear)" in the post-Nirvana era. And we In
dians love sentiment and underwear (we
also love the Vengaboyz and Aqua, but
that's immaterial).
Clearly then, from the U.S. perspective,

Adams' biggest mistake was that he refused to
become a movie star (Bon Jovi anyone?), that
he didn't date a woman with extra-large
breasts and a reality show of her own, that lie
ill-advisedly moved to England from that ver
itable center of the world, Canada, and final
ly, that he didn't sport a mullet or promote a
hairstyle (Bon Jovi, anyone?).
What he did do was study demography
and pick the subcontinent with the fastest
growing population to breed the next gener
ation of mellow-dramatic rock fans: Yes,
Bryan Adams will rise yet again!
