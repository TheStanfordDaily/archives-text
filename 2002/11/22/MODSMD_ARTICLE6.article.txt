# Honor code scrutinized as cheating increases
## New initiative seeks to raise campus awareness and address honor code issues 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Arguably, it is human nature: temptation
surpasses proper academic conduct and (lie de
sire to excel leads some to take extreme mea
sures. More commonly, writing a paper is only
one click away on the Internet, taking an exam
can be as simple as peeking over a neighbor's
shoulder, and writing a lab report is easier
when concocting results that never were.
In the wake of recent studies showing that
cheating is 011 the rise ai institutions across the
country, coupled with a rise in alleged honor
code violations at Stanford, many feel that it is
time to reassess the University's honor code
and its role in the academic culture.

Duke University's Center for Academic In
tegrity— an institute that helps create honor
codes for its 250 member universities, includ
ing Stanford — has conducted several studies
showing that cheating is on the rise at Duke and
elsewhere. A 2001-02 CAI survey of campuses
nationwide in 2001-02 found that 27 percent of
students attested to falsifying lab data, 41 per
cent admitted to plagiarism on written assign
ments, 30 percent said they cheated during
tests and (50 percent acknowledged unautho
rized collaborations.
Comparison to data from the 1999-2000
academic year shows that the number of college
students who said they had cut and pasted from
the Internet without attributing their source
rose from 10 percent to 41 percent.
Figures reported by Stanford's Office of ju
dicial Affairs reflect the national trend. From
1998 to 2001, there has been a 12(3 percent in
crease in alleged violations of the honor code.
In particular, the number of cases heard by the
Judicial Panel involving "unpermitted aid" has

increased from five to 45 and those involving
"unpermitted collaborations" have risen from
one to eight.
These numbers indicate an increase in re
ported cases across the University, but do not
necessarily show an increase in actual violations
of the honor code.
"Definitely the cases that are being detected
have increased," said Laurette Beeson, the ju
dicial adviser at the Office of Judicial Affairs.
"We see only what gets reported to us."
According to George Wilson, the Judicial Af
fairs program coordinator, in the previous
three academic years there has been an in
crease in the number of charged cases. He fur
ther added that there have been three expul
sions in the past year and only one expulsion in
the three years before that.
"I have observed a lot of in-class cheating,"
said senior Alexis Halaby. "[I have heard] sto
ries of people giving exams to other people to
lake . . . [and people) leaving notes
in the bathroom."
Senior Sara Flores commented,
"When 1 was a sophomore, I took
[Statistics] (">() and [Computer Sc i
enc e| 105 and 1 heard rampant ru
mors [of cheating] in CS," adding
that she also suspec ted cheating in
the statistics class.
junior Khaled Hasan recalled
students fabricating lab data in his
Chemistry 30 class.
"People would make stuff up,"
lie said. "I got the feeling that
they expected people to be com
peting left and right and that
[fabricating data] was part of the
competition."
"If someone cheats on a small
portion to adjust their melting
point... it's trivial," said Jonathan
Touster, a lecturer in the Depart
ment of Chemistry. "If people are
witnessing cheating, why don't
they report them to me?"
The honor code, established in
1921 under high demand from
the student body and revised in
the mid-'OOs, has clear guidelines
for cases involving a breach of aca
demic integrity.
Stanford's code, which is differ
ent from those used by schools like
the University of Virginia, Cornell
and Rice, is enforced by a judicial
panel consisting of faculty, staff
and students. At the University of
Virginia, the system is entirely stu
dent-run.
At Cornell, exams are proc
tored by the instructor or a teach
ing assistant, whereas at Stanford,
the honor code specifically in
cludes a "no-proctoring" clause.
This means that the professor or
teaching assistant must leave the
room before the exam can begin.
Flie honor code at Rice permits
professors to give take-home
exams.
"Students had more freedom to
take tests within the guidelines of
the honor code," said Rice alum
nus Ed Feng, a chemical engineer

ing dot toral c andidate-. "Most tests
were well-crafted in that if you
didn't I figure them out| in three
hours, you wouldn't get it at all."
Although proctors can deter
cheating, they may be unable to
c atch offenders in action.
"Any student who's cheating
will stop when the FA
walks in," I lalaby said.
A solution toan alleged increase
in cheating may involve a more
rigorous use of the honor code,
which is meant to be a culturally
enforced system, she said.
Feng noted that students learn
about Rice's honor code during
Freshman Orientation.
"I don't have a feeling that aca
demic integrity is ever stressed at
Stanford," Halaby said. "Our
honor code lias become that thing
that's just there, and no one really
acknowledges it."
Beeson said, "I think that facul
ty are in a bind in that they feel stu
dents know the honor code and
feel that they don't have to talk
about it."
As such, she suggested that one
improvement to the current sys
tem is to have the faculty talk to
their classes about the honor code.
If accused of cheating, students
face the judicial panel.
If found guilty, "[the] standard
penalty is one quarter's suspension
iollowed by 40 hours of communi
ty service," Wilson said. "Stan
ford's system is educational, not
punitive."
According to Beeson, if a stu
dent admits to having made a mis
take, "the process will go much
more smoothly."
I lalaby and Flores founded the
Honor Code Reform Initiative in
order to ljiise campus awareness
and address honor code issues.
"We want to survey the student
body to see how much students
know in-class cheating," Ha
laby said. "[lt] needs to be ad
dressed."
I'lie survey will be distributed to
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents and faculty next quarter.
Data collected will then be assessed
and used to make suggestions for

improvement.
"We want to see how the honor
code is working for everyone," Flo
res said. "Our hope is that sugges
tions will arise from the survey."
In light of the increase in there
ported incidents of cheating, a
number of departments have im
plemented measures to catch of
fenders. The Computer Science
Department is using the UC-
Berkeley-developed Measure of
Software Similarity program to
automatically search lines of code
for plagiarism, and other depart
ments are using Internet search

engines like Google to achieve the
same purpose, lieeson said.
"You are in college of your own
free will, sn why would you not
want to just do the work and get
good grades on your own merit?"
wondered Pedram Keyani, a com
puter science graduate student,
who acknowledged use of the
MOSS program in certain com
puter science courses. "Ifyou get a
good job or into a good graduate
school based on ill-deserved
grades, everything from that point
on is tainted, even if you never
cheat again."

Figures reported by Stanford's Office of ju
dicial Affairs reflect the national trend. From
1998 to 2001, there has been a 12(3 percent in
crease in alleged violations of the honor code.
In particular, the number of cases heard by the
Judicial Panel involving "unpermitted aid" has

increased from five to 45 and those involving
"unpermitted collaborations" have risen from
one to eight.
These numbers indicate an increase in re
ported cases across the University, but do not
necessarily show an increase in actual violations
of the honor code.
"Definitely the cases that are being detected
have increased," said Laurette Beeson, the ju
dicial adviser at the Office of Judicial Affairs.
"We see only what gets reported to us."
According to George Wilson, the Judicial Af
fairs program coordinator, in the previous
three academic years there has been an in
crease in the number of charged cases. He fur
ther added that there have been three expul
sions in the past year and only one expulsion in
the three years before that.
"I have observed a lot of in-class cheating,"
said senior Alexis Halaby. "[I have heard] sto
ries of people giving exams to other people to
lake . . . [and people) leaving notes
in the bathroom."
Senior Sara Flores commented,
"When 1 was a sophomore, I took
[Statistics] (">() and [Computer Sc i
enc e| 105 and 1 heard rampant ru
mors [of cheating] in CS," adding
that she also suspec ted cheating in
the statistics class.
junior Khaled Hasan recalled
students fabricating lab data in his
Chemistry 30 class.
"People would make stuff up,"
lie said. "I got the feeling that
they expected people to be com
peting left and right and that
[fabricating data] was part of the
competition."
"If someone cheats on a small
portion to adjust their melting
point... it's trivial," said Jonathan
Touster, a lecturer in the Depart
ment of Chemistry. "If people are
witnessing cheating, why don't
they report them to me?"
The honor code, established in
1921 under high demand from
the student body and revised in
the mid-'OOs, has clear guidelines
for cases involving a breach of aca
demic integrity.
Stanford's code, which is differ
ent from those used by schools like
the University of Virginia, Cornell
and Rice, is enforced by a judicial
panel consisting of faculty, staff
and students. At the University of
Virginia, the system is entirely stu
dent-run.
At Cornell, exams are proc
tored by the instructor or a teach
ing assistant, whereas at Stanford,
the honor code specifically in
cludes a "no-proctoring" clause.
This means that the professor or
teaching assistant must leave the
room before the exam can begin.
Flie honor code at Rice permits
professors to give take-home
exams.
"Students had more freedom to
take tests within the guidelines of
the honor code," said Rice alum
nus Ed Feng, a chemical engineer

ing dot toral c andidate-. "Most tests
were well-crafted in that if you
didn't I figure them out| in three
hours, you wouldn't get it at all."
Although proctors can deter
cheating, they may be unable to
c atch offenders in action.
"Any student who's cheating
will stop when the FA
walks in," I lalaby said.
A solution toan alleged increase
in cheating may involve a more
rigorous use of the honor code,
which is meant to be a culturally
enforced system, she said.
Feng noted that students learn
about Rice's honor code during
Freshman Orientation.
"I don't have a feeling that aca
demic integrity is ever stressed at
Stanford," Halaby said. "Our
honor code lias become that thing
that's just there, and no one really
acknowledges it."
Beeson said, "I think that facul
ty are in a bind in that they feel stu
dents know the honor code and
feel that they don't have to talk
about it."
As such, she suggested that one
improvement to the current sys
tem is to have the faculty talk to
their classes about the honor code.
If accused of cheating, students
face the judicial panel.
If found guilty, "[the] standard
penalty is one quarter's suspension
iollowed by 40 hours of communi
ty service," Wilson said. "Stan
ford's system is educational, not
punitive."
According to Beeson, if a stu
dent admits to having made a mis
take, "the process will go much
more smoothly."
I lalaby and Flores founded the
Honor Code Reform Initiative in
order to ljiise campus awareness
and address honor code issues.
"We want to survey the student
body to see how much students
know in-class cheating," Ha
laby said. "[lt] needs to be ad
dressed."
I'lie survey will be distributed to
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents and faculty next quarter.
Data collected will then be assessed
and used to make suggestions for

improvement.
"We want to see how the honor
code is working for everyone," Flo
res said. "Our hope is that sugges
tions will arise from the survey."
In light of the increase in there
ported incidents of cheating, a
number of departments have im
plemented measures to catch of
fenders. The Computer Science
Department is using the UC-
Berkeley-developed Measure of
Software Similarity program to
automatically search lines of code
for plagiarism, and other depart
ments are using Internet search

engines like Google to achieve the
same purpose, lieeson said.
"You are in college of your own
free will, sn why would you not
want to just do the work and get
good grades on your own merit?"
wondered Pedram Keyani, a com
puter science graduate student,
who acknowledged use of the
MOSS program in certain com
puter science courses. "Ifyou get a
good job or into a good graduate
school based on ill-deserved
grades, everything from that point
on is tainted, even if you never
cheat again."

Arguably, it is human nature: temptation
surpasses proper academic conduct and (lie de
sire to excel leads some to take extreme mea
sures. More commonly, writing a paper is only
one click away on the Internet, taking an exam
can be as simple as peeking over a neighbor's
shoulder, and writing a lab report is easier
when concocting results that never were.
In the wake of recent studies showing that
cheating is 011 the rise ai institutions across the
country, coupled with a rise in alleged honor
code violations at Stanford, many feel that it is
time to reassess the University's honor code
and its role in the academic culture.

Duke University's Center for Academic In
tegrity— an institute that helps create honor
codes for its 250 member universities, includ
ing Stanford — has conducted several studies
showing that cheating is on the rise at Duke and
elsewhere. A 2001-02 CAI survey of campuses
nationwide in 2001-02 found that 27 percent of
students attested to falsifying lab data, 41 per
cent admitted to plagiarism on written assign
ments, 30 percent said they cheated during
tests and (50 percent acknowledged unautho
rized collaborations.
Comparison to data from the 1999-2000
academic year shows that the number of college
students who said they had cut and pasted from
the Internet without attributing their source
rose from 10 percent to 41 percent.
