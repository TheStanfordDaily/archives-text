Arguably, it is human nature: temptation
surpasses proper academic conduct and (lie de
sire to excel leads some to take extreme mea
sures. More commonly, writing a paper is only
one click away on the Internet, taking an exam
can be as simple as peeking over a neighbor's
shoulder, and writing a lab report is easier
when concocting results that never were.
In the wake of recent studies showing that
cheating is 011 the rise ai institutions across the
country, coupled with a rise in alleged honor
code violations at Stanford, many feel that it is
time to reassess the University's honor code
and its role in the academic culture.

Duke University's Center for Academic In
tegrity— an institute that helps create honor
codes for its 250 member universities, includ
ing Stanford — has conducted several studies
showing that cheating is on the rise at Duke and
elsewhere. A 2001-02 CAI survey of campuses
nationwide in 2001-02 found that 27 percent of
students attested to falsifying lab data, 41 per
cent admitted to plagiarism on written assign
ments, 30 percent said they cheated during
tests and (50 percent acknowledged unautho
rized collaborations.
Comparison to data from the 1999-2000
academic year shows that the number of college
students who said they had cut and pasted from
the Internet without attributing their source
rose from 10 percent to 41 percent.
Figures reported by Stanford's Office of ju
dicial Affairs reflect the national trend. From
1998 to 2001, there has been a 12(3 percent in
crease in alleged violations of the honor code.
In particular, the number of cases heard by the
Judicial Panel involving "unpermitted aid" has

increased from five to 45 and those involving
"unpermitted collaborations" have risen from
one to eight.
These numbers indicate an increase in re
ported cases across the University, but do not
necessarily show an increase in actual violations
of the honor code.
"Definitely the cases that are being detected
have increased," said Laurette Beeson, the ju
dicial adviser at the Office of Judicial Affairs.
"We see only what gets reported to us."
According to George Wilson, the Judicial Af
fairs program coordinator, in the previous
three academic years there has been an in
crease in the number of charged cases. He fur
ther added that there have been three expul
sions in the past year and only one expulsion in
the three years before that.
"I have observed a lot of in-class cheating,"
said senior Alexis Halaby. "[I have heard] sto
ries of people giving exams to other people to
