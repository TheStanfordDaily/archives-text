# West Nile strikes student; danger low for others

### STEPHANIE CONDON 
For most students, a slight rash would not be much
to worry about. For senior Erin lapping, it signified
the oncoming of the potentially fatal West Nile virus.
This virus only recently arrived in California and has
been the subject of much worry and speculation in the
media.
The news came as quite a shock to Lapping when
she learned, two months after the fact, that the cause
for the rash she developed was the West Nile virus. She
was working in Washington, D.C., at an internship
with the Special Olympics when she noticed her first
symptoms during the last week of July, two small
lymph nodes that swelled up behind I mapping's left ear.
Her symptoms quickly worsened.
"A week later, I woke up one morning with small
red spots on my torso," Lapping said. "Throughout
the course of the next week and a half, the spots
spread throughout my body all the way to my lower
legs, hands and face. For the first few clays I felt tired
and slightly feverish. I had an extremely sore back
and neck muscles and bad headaches."
While the West Nile virus is associated with en
cephalitis, a severe and deadly neurological disease,
the Center for Disease Control's Web site says that it
realistically poses little threat, especially to young
adults.
According to the CDC, the fatality rate for those
who develop a severe illness ranges
I'rom percent to 15 percent, and only
I percent ol'those with (he virus will
develop a severe illness.
I hough Sianlbrd students have lit
tle risk of contracting the West Nile
virus, the llu-like symptoms which
Lapping experienced can also he in
dicative of meningitis, which is a more
common disease among college stu
dents, according to flyers distributed
by Vaden I lealth (Center.
Lapping, who was quite concerned
since she "had no idea what was hap
pening," sought medical attention
right away.
"I went to the hospital on the lirst
morning thai I woke up with spots, but
alier three doctors looked at me, they
decided that I probably had some sort
of virus and that 1 should come back if
symptoms got worse," she said. "But 1
went awa) lor the weekend when the
symptoms did indeed get worse, so I
never went back to the hospital."
The severity of Lapping's symp
toms fluctuated fora period of about
two weeks until she returned to the
hospital. She was given medication to
subdue her symptoms, though she
had vet to be diagnosed correct ly.
Lapping explained, "At the end of
September, my mom, who is a pedia
trician, received information from the
state health agency on the virus be
cause it had finally conic to California.
Alter reading about the symptoms,
she began to suspect that I had had the
West Nile virus. So I got tested and the
results came back positive lor West
Nile antibodies in early October."
According to Lapping, she has not
received any treatment or taken any
medication for the virus.
While a positive outcome to a case
such as 1 apping's is not at all atypical,
she said felt that "all the hype and at
tention surrounding [the West Nile
virus] made me think that it was a hor
rible, deadl) disease that only a few
people in each state had sullered from
and there was no way that I would be
one of those people."
