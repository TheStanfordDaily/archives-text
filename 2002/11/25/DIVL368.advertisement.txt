Spring Break March 22-29, 2003
The Program in African and African American Studies contin
ues our Learning Expeditions with a journey to Belize during the
Spring Break of 2003. The trip is jointly sponsored by Native
American Studies and the Center for Comparative Studies of
Race and Ethnicity. Our purpose is an intensive study of the
Garifuna people, also known as "Black Caribs." The Garifuna,
quintessentially the products of the European colonial enterprise
in the Caribbean, are the result of the intermixture of Africans
with Native Americans-called Caribs. We're also interested in
the Mayan ruins and civilizations in Belize, the culture of
Belizean Creoles, and Belize in general. Our itinerary includes
lectures with Belizean scholars, and visits to various cultural and
archeological sites of Garifuna, Maya, and Creole heritage.
