dodges tliew like the sexy dancer she is, and we are dime.
THE DATE: Dinner and a bad concert, babycakes?
THE TIME: I'll pick you up at 8:00 sharp. Wear that little red number you
got for Christmas. And don't be late.
THE PLACE: Your place or mine?
I have a lull tank of gas, a fleshly turquoised engine, a semi-functional
vehicle, a one-hiindred-percent-functional love machine, and the most
beautiful woman in the world sitting pretty in the passenger seat. And the
toad's so open ii might as well be a I upperware container fresh from the
Savon without a crumb of casserole on it. It's so open it's a tell-it-all confession
on Ricki l.ee Springer with the relatives crying bloody murder in the
background. It's so open . . . it's so open it's like ... it's like. . . what'd you say
about my mom? Shut the hell up.
I love this car. I love the speed, the power, and the engine chugging and
screaming like a Rocky I lorror virgin. I love driving like a maniac. And its
even better with a beautiful girl in the front seat who doesn't know where
you're going.
The lovely, intelligent, confused Ravana Wang looks straight at me as I
pull oil the li eewav at Fallbrook. She blinks her dark eyes and burns these
words into my throbbing soul:
"What the hell, Sander?"
I smile nervously and shrug my shoulders.
"I was just leeling like it was time to get out. Dangerous vibes."
"Dangerous vibes? I was supposed to be meeting my boyfriend
there tonight!"
Boyfriend? I am her boyfriend, she just doesn't know it yet. Who's this
pretender to my throne? I'd love to know, but best to keep her distracted.
She's looking angry.
"Sander, I am completely sick of your crap!"
I pull up at her front door. Feels like my usually slick moves are failing,
for some reason. Don't know why. It's pretty inexplicable. I try to save it,
leaning over and putting an arm over her shoulders.
"Ravana baby, you could come back to my place — I can explain —"
The lovely, intelligent, very angry Ravana Wang went out the door so
last I didn't even notice her slamming it on my fingertips, extended in an
appeal of amity.
|ohn Stuart Mill, that hurts! At least it's the light hand. Man, if she'd got
my lingering lingers, there'll be no mercy. Well, maybe a little if she'd do a
striptease to the music of Velvet Underground. Hut the mercy would be
unmerciful.
It's only two blocks back to my place from hers but I can barely drive my
hand hurts so much. I pull up with an angry screech in the front yard, step
out of the vehicle, and open the hack gate. Nothing tonight is working out.
I head back to dip the throbbing digits into the soothing liquid of the
pool.
Plopping the Sanderial behind down on the sacred concrete of the
traditional Valley poolside patio, I let my lingers linger in the water.
It was glowing chlorine-clear and phosphorescent from the underwater
lights. I could hear movement in the surrounding shrubbery, but all 1 could
see was the green water —and black shadows whirling in its ripples
overhead.
