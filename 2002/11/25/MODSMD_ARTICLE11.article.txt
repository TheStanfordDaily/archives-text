# Senators question U.S.-Saudi ties

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Law
makers pressed lor answers yester
day on a possible Saudi money trail
in the Sept. 1 I hijackings and said
regardless of whether one exists,
the kingdom must stop its "duplic
itous" coddling of terrorists.
Saudi officials spent the week
end having bankers pore over the
records of Princess 1 laila al-Faisal,
wife of their ambassador to the
United States, to see how thou
sands of dollars from her account
might have ended up in the wrong
hands, said Saudi foreign policy
adviser Adel al-Jubeir.
But he said it was "crazy" to sug
gest she had done anything inten
tionally to support terrorism.
Lawmakers said the FBl's in
vestigation should pull no punch
es, and the Bush administration
should be open about the findings,
despite the risk of offending an im
portant ally with whom relations
already have been strained.

In a harsh turn bound to be
uncomfortable for administration
officials as they seek Saudi assis
tance in a possible war with Iraq,
senators upbraided the Saudi
government for what they see as
years of complicity in anti-Ameri
can radicalism.
Saudis "have played a duplici
tous game, and that is, they say to
the terrorists, 'We'll do everything
you want, just leave us alone,' "
said Democratic Sen. Charles
Schumer of New York. "That
game has got to stop."
Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-
Conn., and John McCain, R-Ariz.,
who together set up an indepen
dent commission that will investi
gate the terror attacks, offered
piercing criticism.
Saudi leaders "have to decide
which side they're on," Lieberman
said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
"For too many generations they
have pacified and accommodated

themselves to the most extreme,
fanatical, violent elements of
Islam, and those elements have
now turned on us and the rest of
the world."
Added McCain: "The Saudi
royal family has been engaged in a
Kaustian bargain lor years to keep
themselves in power."
Still, none of the lawmakers
knew whether the princess had
meant for her money to go to
Omar al-Bayoumi and Osama
Basnan. U.S. ollicials believe those
men provided financial support to
two of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers
while the terrorists lived in the
United States.
Al-Jubeir said the princess sent
monthly checks to a Saudi woman
living in America who asked her
for help paying for medical treat
ment, and it came out only now
that the woman was Basnan's wife
and some of the money ended up
with al-Bavoumi's family as well.
