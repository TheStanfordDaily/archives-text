# Iraq: U.S. wants to go to war

BAG 11 DAD, Iraq (AP) â€” In a point-by-point
protest, the Iraqi government complained to the
United Nations yesterday that the small print be
hind the weapons inspections beginning this
week will give Washington a pretext to attack.
The new U.N. resolution on the inspections
could turn "inaccurate statements among thou
sands of pages" of required Iraqi reports into a
supposed justification lor military action, Foreign
Minister Naji Sabri said in a letter to U.N. Secre
tary-General Koli Annan.
"There is premeditation to target Iraq, what
ever the pretext," Sabri said.
His lengthy letter, a detailed commentary on
the Security Council resolution, was not expected
to allect the inspections, which resume Wednes
day after a four-year suspension. Iraq had ac
cepted the resolution in a Nov. 13 letter from
Sabri to Annan.
Preparations moved steadily ahead on Bagh
dad's outskirts yesterday, where technicians at
the U.N. inspection center worked to establish a
"hot line" with liaisons in the Iraqi government.
The first working group of 18 inspectors ar
rives today on a llight from a U.N. rear base in
Cyprus. Their numbers are expected to swell by
year-end to between 80 and 100 at a time in Iraq.
In seven years' work after the 1991 Gulf War,
U.N. experts destroyed large amounts of chemi
cal and biological weapons and longer-range mis
siles forbidden to Iraq by U.N. resolutions, and
dismantled Iraq's nuclear weapons program be
fore it could build a bomb. The inspections were
suspended amid disputes over U.N. access to
Iraqi sites and Iraqi complaints the United States
inserted spies in the inspection teams.
Anew locus on Iraq by the Bush administration
led to adoption of Resolution 1441 and the dis
patch of inspectors back to Iraq with greater pow
ers of unrestricted access to suspected weapons
sites. Washington alleges Iraq retains some pro
hibited weapons and may be producing others.
The resolution, adopted unanimously Nov. 7,
demands the Iraqis give up any chemical, biolog
ical or nuclear weapons, or face "serious conse
quences."
