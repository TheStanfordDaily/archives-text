# Six-year deal would improve wages
## Agreement reached in shipping dispute 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (Al») — West Coast dock
workers and shipping companies have reached a
tentative contract agreement that could end the
drawn-out labor dispute that shut down the coast's
major ports for 10 days and prompted the presi
dent to intervene.
The six-year deal would provide wage and benefit
improvements lor union members, plus technology
and dispute-resolution improvements that the com
panies needed, said I'eter I lurtgen, head of the fed
eral Mediation and Conciliation Service.
He praised both sides, saying lead negotiators
"demonstrated statesmenlike leadership, which
made this agreement possible."
The agreement, reached late Saturday, still must
be ratified by a majority of the 10,500 members of the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union. A
caucus of about 100 union members will meet Dec. 7
to vote on the contract, and the entire rank-and-file
will probably vote on it in early January, according to
union president Jim Spinosa.
The major sticking points in the negotiations had
centered on the desire by the Pacific Maritime Associ
ation, the industry group, for computerized cargo
tracking systems that will make dockside work more
efficient, but also cost an estimated 400 jobs. The
union, in return, wanted increased compensation
and pension benefits.
"With this contract we are ushering in a new era of
modernization," Joseph Miniace, president of the
PMA, said yesterday.
"Workers can harness technology and make it
work for them," said AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer
Richard Trumka, who joined the negotiations. "They
can bridle it, saddle it and ride it to job, pension and
economic security."
1 lurtgen declined to give details of the agreement
but expressed confidence workers would be pleased.
"I think once they see the magnitude of the pen
sion increases, the wage increases — it would be phe
nomenal if they were to turn that down," he said.
Sources familiar with the negotiations said workers
can expect raises of 10 to 15 percent over the six years.
fhe dockworkers' previous contract expired in July.
Union member Bernard Bowden, 45, of Antioch,
said he felt "relief and a lot of apprehension" about
the tentative agreement.
