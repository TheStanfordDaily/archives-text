likely could not ignore the dramatic im
ages covering the pavement. Inside
chalk police outlines ofbodies were the
names of hundreds of victims of violence against
transgender people and the dates that they died.
The designs, drawn for National Transgender
Day of Remembrance last Wednesday, coupled
with the recent death of a Bay Area transgender
teen, are reminders that issues of gender and vi
olence should concern us all.
According to a Web site sponsored by UC-
Berkeley, a transgender person has a "psycho
logical self that differs from the social expecta
tions for the physical sex they were born with."
This encompasses a wide range of people —
one example is a female with a masculine gen
der identity or who identifies as a man. Some
one who is transgender is not necessarily trans
sexual or even gay, and transgender is often

used as a "blanket" term for anyone who identi
fies with the gender that is not his/her own.
The definition is clearly complicated, but one of
the most basic ways Stanford community mem
bers can learn more about transgender issues is
to discuss the various meanings of the term. Res
ident assistants, professors and transgender stu
dents themselves can help educate students by
speaking to dorms and offering programming
to help increase understanding about what it
means to be transgender in the Bay Area.
Unfortunately, the amount of reported vio
lence against transgender people is on the
rise. The National Transgender Advocacy
Coalition reports that 2002 has been the dead
liest year for transgender people, with 25
deaths so far, compared to 19 in 2001. Fur
thermore, California has had the most trans
gender deaths; San Francisco (which has
15,000 transgender people, according to

some estimates) is third in deaths related to
anti-transgender violence. Nearly two months
ago, Newark, Calif, native Owen Araujo, 17,
was beaten to death at a party when it was re
vealed that she was biologically male.
Three young men have been arrested and
charged with murder and special hate-crime
charges. Most shockingly, no one from the
party intervened to stop the violence. Araujo's
death was not an isolated incident and the fact
remains that those who are transgender are in
some cases fearing for their lives. We at Stan
ford cannot let those who are transgender at
Stanford live in fear of violence.
The Stanford community has done an ad
mirable job supporting transgender issues.
Earlier this month, more than 50 students
packed a vigil that was held in Araujo's honor.
Students read poems and organizers hoped to
raise awareness of transgender issues. The

activist Susan Stryker, who spoke about the
film "Boys Don't Cry," which deals with trans
gender issues. Finally, there are transgender
professors and students at Stanford. You may
not know them, but they need your support.
As one member of the LGBT-CRG said in
relation to National Transgender Remem
brance Day,"It is important for the greater
community to understand that gender issues
do not apply only to queer people (we all have
genders, and we all were socialized to some de

community should understand that violence

support is necessary to prevent continued vio
