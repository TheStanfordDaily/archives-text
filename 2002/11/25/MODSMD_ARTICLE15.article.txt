# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## The
						fear of fear itself 
### 
How many times a day do you
think about dying? Just curi
ous. I average about 10 times a
day. My favorite suicide fanta
sy is stabbing myself in the heart and twist
ing the knife clockwise (always clockwise)
and just letting the blood fall right out of
me. Sometimes I entertain rather morbid
speculations as to whether the blood
would gush out in spurts, or if it would
trickle neatly down my clothes.
About 30 percent of college students
suffer from depression. I'm one of them.
We're invisible to the naked eye. You can
know someone for years and never guess.
No one who has it really wants to talk
about it with you, unless you have it too. If
you don't, it's more than likely that you
just won't get it. You probably wouldn't

understand, and then
we'd have to spend 20
minutes justifying our ill
ness. So it's easier just not
to bring it up.
I don't want to come
off as saying you couldn't
possibly understand de
pression if you've never
suffered from it yourself.

But I consistently find that people who
have never been depressed usually first
try to compare it to their own personal
experiences: "Yeah, sometimes 1 feel
down. But then I pick myself right up
again." That's just frustrating. Even
worse is when people try to use depres
sion as an excuse to make generalizations
about society at large: "Society today
forces us to push ourselves too hard,
makes us think we're not pretty enough
or rich enough. That's what causes prob
lems like depression."
I especially hate the commercials lor an
tidepressant medications. As much as I'd
love to believe that pharmaceutical compa
nies put them on to raise awareness and in
spire people to seek treatment, those ads
just make me sick inside. They're designed
to scare people into taking drugs they
don't need. They list a bunch of vague
symptoms that everyone has had at some
point in their life and then in the deep, se
rious voice they intone," Maybe ynmtv some
one you love is suffering from depression."
They trivialize the entire struggle.
Drug stocks enjoyed an enormous
surge in share prices in the 19905, peaking
in early 2001. That and a host of social
commentators eager to cash in their own
two cents on depression has made mental
illness the butt of a running national joke.
I'll be the first to admit that the mental
health industry has ;i dark side. Daily affir
mations. ()prah and I )r. Phil, fhe rise and
fill of self-esteem. Seriouslv, i! I couldn't
laugh about it how ridiculous this all is, all
I could do is sit back and cry. But the end
message is that mental illness is not real;
that it can be solved through touchy-feely
support groups and "positive thinking;"
that psychology is pure bunk and the only

way to deal with negative feelings is to pull
yourself up by the bootstraps. Popular cul
ture tells us that medication is for people
who are too weak to deal with their issues
on their own.
Suffering from depression is like being
in the closet. Cringing every time someone
makes an insensitive remark about crazy
people. Getting all quiet whenever some
one talks disparagingly about therapy.
Pretending to laugh along with the Prozac
jokes. Wondering if people can tell that
you have it just by looking at you. Won
dering if they can see right through you
into the quiet battle that's raging on inside
your mind.
It's different for different people. For
me, it's always boiled down to fear. Fear
that people will judge me. Fear that I'm
not smart enough. Fear that maybe it's not
a treatable biochemical imbalance that's
making me feel this way, but some funda
mental weakness in me. Something that's
wrong with me, only me, and it's my own
damn fault for everything.
Sometimes it's a constant buzzing, the
bad thoughts like angry bees swarming
around my head. When it gets like that,
I'm useless. I can't focus on anything, so I
can't read. Can't write papers because I
can't do the reading. Can't go to class be
cause I haven't turned in the assignments,
and I can't bear to face my professors
empty-handed. It weighs me down. It
keeps me in the room for fear of running
into someone I know who'll recognize my
secret shame.
Other times my head explodes with all
the energy that's been repressed, and I
write and write and write. Most of it's crap,
but some of it I salvage and turn into Daily
columns. Still other times I just want to for
get it all, and 1 drink or smoke, willfully ig
noring the damage I'm doing to my liver
and my lungs. I've got bigger fish to fry.
I have a packet of antihistamines in my
medicine cabinet, the really strong, 12-
hour kind. I went through a time when 1
would hold those tablets in my hand,
thinkingabout how easy it would be just to
take one and then another and then an
other, until I'd taken the whole packet,
and I could just drift away.
I don't do that anymore. It's been a
long journey, but I've discovered there are
things I want to live for. My family. My
friends. My hopes and dreams. Mad love
to the people at Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the Disability Re
solute Center, to my professors who un
derstood and gave me a second chance, to
the people who supported me and contin
ue to support me through the duration.
I think about dying about 10 times a
day. But the important thing is that at the
end of the day, I want to live.
