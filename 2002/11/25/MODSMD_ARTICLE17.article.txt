Roxy Sass' column 'inappropriate'
As a former Daily staffer and Intermis
sion contributor, I was shocked by the
crude and inappropriate language in
Roxy Sass' column. It's possible to have a
smart and funny column about sex with
out all the offensive language.

Journalist Fisk has 'a passion for truth'
I wanted to thank the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, the Coalition for
Justice in Israel / Palestine, the Peninsula
Peace and Justice ("enter and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau for bringing Robert Fisk
to town. What is inspirational about this
man is his passion for the truth and for the
reasons that things happen, and for his can
dor in writing about tlie world as he sees it.
It is true that Fisk, during his talk, was all
over the map — geographically and con
ceptually— but that is how it should be, for
here was a man trying to show us indeed his
map, and encouraging us to find our own.
Fducation must involve helping us find our
values and our own world view, and teach
ing us to be true and unflaggingly commit
ted to those ethics. It was truly a superb
spark of inspiration and a clear moment of
ethics to hear Fisk speak. Il is now up to us
to act upon what we learn and believe.

Stanford should use G-CEP funds well
The Global Climate & Energy Project
(G-CKP), with iis $225 million budget, is
an incredible opportunity to research sus
tainable energy. While much is still 1111-

known about specific research projects, I
am concerned that major potential ad
vances in renewable energy sources (such
as solar) will be overlooked, based on the
official statements and motivations of the
sponsoring companies.
The oil and energy companies fronting
the money, ExxonMobil, Schlumberger
and General Electric, focus on sequestering
carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emis
sions through more efficient energy supply
technology. Many scientists are skeptical
about carbon sequestration as a solution for
global climate change. If it can be made to
work, it will be complicated and expensive.
Solar power can be simple and inexpensive,
and it precludes the need for clean up. Con
sider this analogy: If you found a person
bleeding all over the floor, would you try to
stop the How of blood, or would you buy
sponges to mop up the mess and let the
blood keep flowing?
Reducing greenhouse gases from fos
sil-fuel combustion is a step in the right di
rection, but renewable energy sources can
completely eliminate these emissions. Ad
ditionally, these proposed steps do not ad
dress issues like other pollutants from fos
sil fuels (especially 112 rom coal), the environ
mental damage from drilling and mining,
the non renewable nature of fossil fuels
and the world wars fought over oil.
The CJ-CEP press releases list renew
able energy as a potential research field,
but there is a strong possibility that this will
fall by the wayside as advisory committees
choose where to focus, ll is in the interests
of the oil and power companies to maintain
global reliance on fossil fuels. Schlumberg
er's brochure is titled, "Fossil Fuels — The
Key to Sustainable Development." Official
statements emphasize thai Stanford re
searchers will be working closely with the
industry sector. Though Stanford has offi
cial autonomy from its sponsors, it is in the
University's interests to. cooperate with

these companies to encourage further
funding. Will Stanford pursue end-use en
ergy efficiency and renewable energy solu
tions if ExxonMobil doesn't approve?
The energy companies say they want to
provide cheap and clean energy to the de
veloping world. Solar energy is an obvious
research choice for such a goal, yet some re
searchers have commented that solar tech
nology is too expensive and thus not viable.
Given this unique funding opportunity,
isn't this the perfect time to move solar tech
nology closer to low-cost mass production?
Fossil fuels will only increase in price as sup
plies dwindle, while sunlight will be free and
unlimited. I encourage Stanford faculty to
pursue research in renewable technology
whether or not it is the priority of the spon
soring companies. Our institution has the
opportunity to revolutionize the future of
energy. I hope Stanford will choose well.

Apology to grad students
As you may have heard, last night's 7
p.m. FLiCKS showing of "My Big Fat
(ireek Wedding" was c ancelled due to tech
nical diliiculties. The showing was intended
to be a Grad Night event sponsored by the
GSC. I would like to apologize to those who
came out and to the (ISC., which is in no way
to blame for the movie being cancelled. We
are in the process of improving our pre
shovv tests in an effort to make sure nothing
like this happens again. We have also issued
free tickets, valid for the rest of the academ
ic year, to those in attendance, and will
work with the GSC to ensure successful
graduate student events in the future.

reasons that things happen, and for his can
dor in writing about tlie world as he sees it.
It is true that Fisk, during his talk, was all
over the map — geographically and con
ceptually— but that is how it should be, for
here was a man trying to show us indeed his
map, and encouraging us to find our own.
Fducation must involve helping us find our
values and our own world view, and teach
ing us to be true and unflaggingly commit
ted to those ethics. It was truly a superb
spark of inspiration and a clear moment of
ethics to hear Fisk speak. Il is now up to us
to act upon what we learn and believe.

Stanford should use G-CEP funds well
The Global Climate & Energy Project
(G-CKP), with iis $225 million budget, is
an incredible opportunity to research sus
tainable energy. While much is still 1111-

known about specific research projects, I
am concerned that major potential ad
vances in renewable energy sources (such
as solar) will be overlooked, based on the
official statements and motivations of the
sponsoring companies.
The oil and energy companies fronting
the money, ExxonMobil, Schlumberger
and General Electric, focus on sequestering
carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emis
sions through more efficient energy supply
technology. Many scientists are skeptical
about carbon sequestration as a solution for
global climate change. If it can be made to
work, it will be complicated and expensive.
Solar power can be simple and inexpensive,
and it precludes the need for clean up. Con
sider this analogy: If you found a person
bleeding all over the floor, would you try to
stop the How of blood, or would you buy
sponges to mop up the mess and let the
blood keep flowing?
Reducing greenhouse gases from fos
sil-fuel combustion is a step in the right di
rection, but renewable energy sources can
completely eliminate these emissions. Ad
ditionally, these proposed steps do not ad
dress issues like other pollutants from fos
sil fuels (especially 112 rom coal), the environ
mental damage from drilling and mining,
the non renewable nature of fossil fuels
and the world wars fought over oil.
The CJ-CEP press releases list renew
able energy as a potential research field,
but there is a strong possibility that this will
fall by the wayside as advisory committees
choose where to focus, ll is in the interests
of the oil and power companies to maintain
global reliance on fossil fuels. Schlumberg
er's brochure is titled, "Fossil Fuels — The
Key to Sustainable Development." Official
statements emphasize thai Stanford re
searchers will be working closely with the
industry sector. Though Stanford has offi
cial autonomy from its sponsors, it is in the
University's interests to. cooperate with

these companies to encourage further
funding. Will Stanford pursue end-use en
ergy efficiency and renewable energy solu
tions if ExxonMobil doesn't approve?
The energy companies say they want to
provide cheap and clean energy to the de
veloping world. Solar energy is an obvious
research choice for such a goal, yet some re
searchers have commented that solar tech
nology is too expensive and thus not viable.
Given this unique funding opportunity,
isn't this the perfect time to move solar tech
nology closer to low-cost mass production?
Fossil fuels will only increase in price as sup
plies dwindle, while sunlight will be free and
unlimited. I encourage Stanford faculty to
pursue research in renewable technology
whether or not it is the priority of the spon
soring companies. Our institution has the
opportunity to revolutionize the future of
energy. I hope Stanford will choose well.

Apology to grad students
As you may have heard, last night's 7
p.m. FLiCKS showing of "My Big Fat
(ireek Wedding" was c ancelled due to tech
nical diliiculties. The showing was intended
to be a Grad Night event sponsored by the
GSC. I would like to apologize to those who
came out and to the (ISC., which is in no way
to blame for the movie being cancelled. We
are in the process of improving our pre
shovv tests in an effort to make sure nothing
like this happens again. We have also issued
free tickets, valid for the rest of the academ
ic year, to those in attendance, and will
work with the GSC to ensure successful
graduate student events in the future.

Roxy Sass' column 'inappropriate'
As a former Daily staffer and Intermis
sion contributor, I was shocked by the
crude and inappropriate language in
Roxy Sass' column. It's possible to have a
smart and funny column about sex with
out all the offensive language.

Journalist Fisk has 'a passion for truth'
I wanted to thank the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice, the Coalition for
Justice in Israel / Palestine, the Peninsula
Peace and Justice ("enter and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau for bringing Robert Fisk
to town. What is inspirational about this
man is his passion for the truth and for the
reasons that things happen, and for his can
dor in writing about tlie world as he sees it.
It is true that Fisk, during his talk, was all
