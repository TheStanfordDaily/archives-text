# Murals brighten halls of education

Although the lobby of the School of Education
was once considered cold, stark and unwelcoming,
the recent addition of five murals along the walls
has significantly changed the building's tone.
"We decided to have the murals done to make
the entrance to the School of Education building
more lively and more inviting," said Deborah
Stipek, the school's dean. "We also wanted it to be
clear that the work that goes on in the building is
about education of all kinds and in many contexts."
The five murals, each nine feet high, are set into
the recessed archways along the walls of the lobby.
Each depicts learning in very different settings. The
School of Education provided artists Mark Evans
and Charley Brown of the San Francisco firm Evans
& Brown with suggestions on themes for the murals
that would reflect the school's philosophy.
"We were determined to come up with some
thing that was very decorative and had a lot of
meaning on different levels," Evans said.
He and Brown spent about six months creating
the murals in their San Francisco studio. They
painted the works on canvas with acrylic paint. The
murals were then brought to Stanford and glued to
the walls with an archival adhesive.
Evans and Brown also created tht tmmpe I'oeil
work on the doors ofCaibberloy Auditorium, as well
as the illusion of paneling that arcs over the doors.

"The style of the murals is very specific," Evans
said. "It's very much steeped in a very rich American
tradition of mural painting or illustration that
barkens back to artists like NC VVyeth and Maxfield
Parish who used a lot of photography in their work
as reference, so we used a lot of photography as well."
Although the murals make a conscious effort to
represent the multiculturalism of the University,
students had mixed feelings about them.
"They seem so benign when you walk by them
in passing," said Anne Cortina, a senior in the So
cial Sciences in Education program. "But if you
stop to take a look, and really understand what
each is portraying, it becomes immediately ap
parent that women and minorities are at the pe
riphery of whatever picture of education the
artists were trying to represent.
"For the entrance to the School of Education to
portray women and minorities as assistants, enter
tainers and observers gives the passerby, who does
take the time to look, a false impression of how the
School of Education views these groups."
| unior Cristobal Goa also had mixed reactions to
the murals.
"1 appreciate multicultural-ness and diversity,
but I couldn't help but feel that they were forcing
the subject," he said. "Overall, I felt the murals did
enhance my experience in the education building
by giving me something to look at while 1 was stand
ing around the lobby, waiting to go to class."
