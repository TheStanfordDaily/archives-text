## Card loses first Big Game in eight years 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I he Stanford football team
wore its motto proudly on its chest
going into the 105 th Big (lame at
Berkeley. 1 lie coaches preached it
and their t-shirts proclaimed it: To
win, the Cardinal needed to "exe
cute", something it had been un
able to do all season long.

Football
Saturday: California 30, Stanford 7

Stanford came to Memorial
Stadium as heavy underdogs,
and the Bears ultimately provid
ed the only execution, striking
down the Cardinal 30-7, which
returned the Axe to California
after a seven-year absence.
" I his is one of the worst feelings
I've had," senior tailback Kerry
Carter said. "[The Axe] is some
thing we've had for so long, and we
cherish it, not just this team but
anyone who's ever put on a Stan

ford uniform. We feel like we've let
them down."
I lie* loss cements Stanford (2-9,
1-7 Pacific-10 Conference) to its
worst record in 19 years, securing
the biggest turnaround in school
history after last season's 9-3
record.
Cal (7-5, 4-4) is also on the end
of a school-record turnaround —
though, one for the better — as
first-year coach Jeff Ted ford has
resurrected a 1-10 squad from
2001 into a team that would be
headed fora bowl if not for an
NCAA postseason ban.
"This is the best feeling I've ever
had," Cal senior corner Jemeel
Powell said. "I used to feel like we
were cursed against Stanford, but
all that ended today."
Initially, it appeared Stanford
might overcome the odds and win
its record eighth Big Game. After
forcing a Cal punt on the Bears'
opening possession, the Cardinal
put together a 50-yard scoring
drive capped by redshirt freshman

Kyle Matter's 8-yard touchdown
pass to sophomore Teyo Johnson.
But those seven points was all
that Stanford could manage, and
the Bears quickly answered when
senior quarterback Kyle Boiler
found Lashaun Ward fora 31-
yard scoring pass. From that point
on, Cal dominated Stanford on
both sides of the ball.
Running back Joe Igber led the
Bears with a Big Game record 226
yards on 26 carries, including a 42-
yard end-zone scamper in the sec
ond quarter.
Stanford was especially ineffec
tive on the ground, as Carter bum
bled his way to just 34 yards on 12
carries to lead the team.
The Cardinal did not fare
much better when it took to the
air. Matter completed just 16 of
30 passes for 151 yards with two
interceptions. The passing inep
titude was a fitting end to a sea
son in which new head coach
Buddy Teevens promised to
bring the "fun-and-gun" offense

"It's frustrating. We just were
not very® productive," Teevens
said. "I feel disappointed, but
not discouraged. In my business,

want you out right away, and

Teevens will likely be back fora
second season and a chance at re
demption, while his counterpart at
Cal is receiving praise as the savior
of Golden Bear football.
" The program is on the rise,"
said Boiler, who threw for 188
yards and two touchdowns. "I
wish I could come back for four
more years with Coach Tedford.
It was great to see the goalposts
go down."
It seemed that the real Big
Game battle happened not in the
one-sided contest but after the
game when Cal fans fought with
police and security to tear down
the goalposts. Memorial Stadium
was hosting its first sellout since
1994, the last time Cal won a Big
Game, and blue and gold domi
nated the crowd, most of which
was anticipating an end to seven
years of frustration in Berkeley.

The fans cleared the bleachers
and rushed onto the field even be
fore the final whistle sounded,
Quickly making a move for the
goalposts, which were surrounded
by security. The first few efforts
failed, but eventually the masses
won out and toppled the north
goalpost, with the south uprights
immediately following.

Several arrests were made, but
no injuries have been reported.
Stanford's biggest injury is its
bruised ego, as it enters the off
season with a five-game losing
streak and without its most trea
sured trophy.
"Anyone associated with our
program has got to be disappoint
ed," Teevens said.

Saturday: California 30, Stanford 7

Stanford came to Memorial
Stadium as heavy underdogs,
and the Bears ultimately provid
ed the only execution, striking
down the Cardinal 30-7, which
returned the Axe to California
after a seven-year absence.
" I his is one of the worst feelings
I've had," senior tailback Kerry
Carter said. "[The Axe] is some
thing we've had for so long, and we
cherish it, not just this team but
anyone who's ever put on a Stan

ford uniform. We feel like we've let
them down."
I lie* loss cements Stanford (2-9,
1-7 Pacific-10 Conference) to its
worst record in 19 years, securing
the biggest turnaround in school
history after last season's 9-3
record.
Cal (7-5, 4-4) is also on the end
of a school-record turnaround —
though, one for the better — as
first-year coach Jeff Ted ford has
resurrected a 1-10 squad from
2001 into a team that would be
headed fora bowl if not for an
NCAA postseason ban.
"This is the best feeling I've ever
had," Cal senior corner Jemeel
Powell said. "I used to feel like we
were cursed against Stanford, but
all that ended today."
Initially, it appeared Stanford
might overcome the odds and win
its record eighth Big Game. After
forcing a Cal punt on the Bears'
opening possession, the Cardinal
put together a 50-yard scoring
drive capped by redshirt freshman

Kyle Matter's 8-yard touchdown
pass to sophomore Teyo Johnson.
But those seven points was all
that Stanford could manage, and
the Bears quickly answered when
senior quarterback Kyle Boiler
found Lashaun Ward fora 31-
yard scoring pass. From that point
on, Cal dominated Stanford on
both sides of the ball.
Running back Joe Igber led the
Bears with a Big Game record 226
yards on 26 carries, including a 42-
yard end-zone scamper in the sec
ond quarter.
Stanford was especially ineffec
tive on the ground, as Carter bum
bled his way to just 34 yards on 12
carries to lead the team.
The Cardinal did not fare
much better when it took to the
air. Matter completed just 16 of
30 passes for 151 yards with two
interceptions. The passing inep
titude was a fitting end to a sea
son in which new head coach
Buddy Teevens promised to
bring the "fun-and-gun" offense
