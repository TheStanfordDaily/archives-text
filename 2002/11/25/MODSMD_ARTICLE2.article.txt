"I'm here to introduce a man
that needs no introduction," said
event coordinator Jeremiah Frei-
Pearson, a third-year law student.
With that, former Massachusetts
governor and 1988 U.S. presiden
tial candidate Michael S. Dukakis
stepped up to the podium.
Dukakis spoke last Friday af
ternoon to a packed auditorium
in the Law School on issues tang
ing from the situation in the Mid
dle East to the current recession.
Fhe underlying theme of his talk
was to persuade those in atten
dance to consider a career in pub
lic office, but a significant portion
of his speech centered on criti
cism of the current Bush admin
istration's policies.
Since running for president in
1988, Dukakis has led an active
public life. Following his term as
governor of Massachusetts in
1991, Dukakis was a visiting pro
fessor at Northeastern University.

I Ie lias also served as a visiting pro
lessor at UCI A's School of Public
Policy and Social Research.
lie is currently the acting
chairman of Amtrak, which he re
ferred to as the stepchild of
American mass transportation, in
an attempt to revive a tottering
industry that lie called one of the
nation's greatest assets.
"One ol the great jobs in this
country is doing something for
the national transportation sys
tem," he added.
Dukakis addressed the history
of American politics and of racial
segregation. He said that the cur
rent times are nothing like the
19505, when "two-thirds of all
Americans believed in racially seg
regated schools."
"This was a country that was
racist; it was anti-Semitic,"
Dukakis said.
"The nation's capital was a segre
gated Johannesburg, South Africa."
The former governor also
talked about the current situation
in the Middle Fast, focusing on the

potential war with Iraq, al-Qaida
and the unresolved Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict.
"Personally, 1 think this plan to
invade Iraq is nuts," he said.
Dukakis said that he is in favor of
a tough stance against terrorism.
"We in the international com
munity have a lot of work to do to
break into this international
criminal organization," he said,
referring to al-Qaida.
Dukakis expressed disappoint
ment that the Bush administration
has chosen disengagement re
garding the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. Bush's administration is the
llrst since 1947 to opt for such a
stance, according to Dukakis.
Dukakis also implied that
today's menaces in the Middle Fast
are of the U.S.'s own making.
"Reagan and the first Bush ad
ministration supported Saddam,"
he said. "The situation in Israel
and the West Bank is getting worse
and worse and worse . . . commit-

ling the country to an invasion of
Iraq doesn't make sense."
Dukakis expressed outrage at a
provision in the I lomeland Security
Act — passed last Wednesday by the
U.S. Senate in a 90-9 vote — that ex
empts drug manufacturers from
any liability for the production, sale
and use of defective vaccines and
pharmaceutical products.
"The pharmaceutical industry
has immunity from defective vac
cines," Dukakis proclaimed. "To
relieve an industry from legal
negligence . . . it's outrageous."
Dukakis also spoke about do
mestic concerns, including afford
able housing, the gap between rich
and poor and healthcare.
The problem with affordable
housing, he added, is that "in this
country it is difficult for the aver
age American to afford a home."
"There are 7 million unin
sured people in California.
Where do they get their health
care and who pays for them?" he
added. "When they wind up in
the emergency room, we do."
Dukakis also blamed Bush's
economic policy for the current
recession.
"Whenever a Republican is
elected [president], we have a re
cession," he said. "Is there any
one that doubts that if Core had

won the presidency, and ol
course he did, that things would
have been different today?"
During the question-and-answer
session, Dukakis was asked to com
ment on how he strikes a balance be
tween his personal and political life.
"[Firstly,] Sunday is family clay
— no politics," Dukakis said.
"Secondly, dinner at home at six
o'clock at night . . . When I was
campaigning in Massachusetts, I
was home for dinner."
The former governor ended
the question-and-answer session
with closing remarks directed at
the students in the audience.
"Having the opportunity to
make a difference . . ■. there's
nothing like it," Dukakis said.
"Oet into this; we need you; the
country needs you."
Anne Irwin, one of the coordi
nators of the event, praised
Dukakis for bis integrity.
"He is courageous and would
be an asset for the Democratic
Party now," Irwin said. "Even
during bis campaign in 1988, he
was not afraid. He kept his in
tegrity;.that's rare."
Audience members generally
responded positively to Dukakis'
speech.
"I thought be was absolutely
amazing," said freshman Ben I I
berger. "It's a shame he's not
president."

empts drug manufacturers from
any liability for the production, sale
and use of defective vaccines and
pharmaceutical products.
"The pharmaceutical industry
has immunity from defective vac
cines," Dukakis proclaimed. "To
relieve an industry from legal
negligence . . . it's outrageous."
Dukakis also spoke about do
mestic concerns, including afford
able housing, the gap between rich
and poor and healthcare.
The problem with affordable
housing, he added, is that "in this
country it is difficult for the aver
age American to afford a home."
"There are 7 million unin
sured people in California.
Where do they get their health
care and who pays for them?" he
added. "When they wind up in
the emergency room, we do."
Dukakis also blamed Bush's
economic policy for the current
recession.
"Whenever a Republican is
elected [president], we have a re
cession," he said. "Is there any
one that doubts that if Core had

won the presidency, and ol
course he did, that things would
have been different today?"
During the question-and-answer
session, Dukakis was asked to com
ment on how he strikes a balance be
tween his personal and political life.
"[Firstly,] Sunday is family clay
— no politics," Dukakis said.
"Secondly, dinner at home at six
o'clock at night . . . When I was
campaigning in Massachusetts, I
was home for dinner."
The former governor ended
the question-and-answer session
with closing remarks directed at
the students in the audience.
"Having the opportunity to
make a difference . . ■. there's
nothing like it," Dukakis said.
"Oet into this; we need you; the
country needs you."
Anne Irwin, one of the coordi
nators of the event, praised
Dukakis for bis integrity.
"He is courageous and would
be an asset for the Democratic
Party now," Irwin said. "Even
during bis campaign in 1988, he
was not afraid. He kept his in
tegrity;.that's rare."
Audience members generally
responded positively to Dukakis'
speech.
"I thought be was absolutely
amazing," said freshman Ben I I
berger. "It's a shame he's not
president."

With that, former Massachusetts
governor and 1988 U.S. presiden
tial candidate Michael S. Dukakis
stepped up to the podium.
Dukakis spoke last Friday af
ternoon to a packed auditorium
in the Law School on issues tang
ing from the situation in the Mid
dle East to the current recession.
Fhe underlying theme of his talk
was to persuade those in atten
dance to consider a career in pub
lic office, but a significant portion
of his speech centered on criti
cism of the current Bush admin
istration's policies.
Since running for president in
1988, Dukakis has led an active
public life. Following his term as
governor of Massachusetts in
1991, Dukakis was a visiting pro
fessor at Northeastern University.

chairman of Amtrak, which he re
ferred to as the stepchild of
American mass transportation, in
an attempt to revive a tottering
industry that lie called one of the
nation's greatest assets.
"One ol the great jobs in this
country is doing something for
the national transportation sys
tem," he added.
Dukakis addressed the history
of American politics and of racial
segregation. He said that the cur
rent times are nothing like the
19505, when "two-thirds of all
Americans believed in racially seg
regated schools."
"This was a country that was
racist; it was anti-Semitic,"
Dukakis said.
"The nation's capital was a segre
gated Johannesburg, South Africa."
The former governor also
talked about the current situation
in the Middle Fast, focusing on the

potential war with Iraq, al-Qaida
and the unresolved Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict.
"Personally, 1 think this plan to
invade Iraq is nuts," he said.
Dukakis said that he is in favor of
a tough stance against terrorism.
"We in the international com
munity have a lot of work to do to
break into this international
criminal organization," he said,
referring to al-Qaida.
Dukakis expressed disappoint
ment that the Bush administration
has chosen disengagement re
garding the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. Bush's administration is the
llrst since 1947 to opt for such a
stance, according to Dukakis.
Dukakis also implied that
today's menaces in the Middle Fast
are of the U.S.'s own making.
"Reagan and the first Bush ad
ministration supported Saddam,"
he said. "The situation in Israel
and the West Bank is getting worse
and worse and worse . . . commit-
