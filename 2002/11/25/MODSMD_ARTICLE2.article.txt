"I'm here to introduce a man
that needs no introduction," said
event coordinator Jeremiah Frei-
Pearson, a third-year law student.
With that, former Massachusetts
governor and 1988 U.S. presiden
tial candidate Michael S. Dukakis
stepped up to the podium.
Dukakis spoke last Friday af
ternoon to a packed auditorium
in the Law School on issues tang
ing from the situation in the Mid
dle East to the current recession.
Fhe underlying theme of his talk
was to persuade those in atten
dance to consider a career in pub
lic office, but a significant portion
of his speech centered on criti
cism of the current Bush admin
istration's policies.
Since running for president in
1988, Dukakis has led an active
public life. Following his term as
governor of Massachusetts in
1991, Dukakis was a visiting pro
fessor at Northeastern University.

I Ie lias also served as a visiting pro
lessor at UCI A's School of Public
Policy and Social Research.
lie is currently the acting
chairman of Amtrak, which he re
ferred to as the stepchild of
American mass transportation, in
an attempt to revive a tottering
industry that lie called one of the
nation's greatest assets.
"One ol the great jobs in this
country is doing something for
the national transportation sys

Dukakis addressed the history

19505, when "two-thirds of all
Americans believed in racially seg
regated schools."
"This was a country that was
racist; it was anti-Semitic,"
Dukakis said.
"The nation's capital was a segre
gated Johannesburg, South Africa."
The former governor also
talked about the current situation
in the Middle Fast, focusing on the

potential war with Iraq, al-Qaida
and the unresolved Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict.
"Personally, 1 think this plan to
invade Iraq is nuts," he said.
Dukakis said that he is in favor of
a tough stance against terrorism.
"We in the international com
munity have a lot of work to do to
break into this international
criminal organization," he said,
referring to al-Qaida.
Dukakis expressed disappoint
ment that the Bush administration
has chosen disengagement re
garding the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. Bush's administration is the
llrst since 1947 to opt for such a
stance, according to Dukakis.
Dukakis also implied that
today's menaces in the Middle Fast
are of the U.S.'s own making.
"Reagan and the first Bush ad
ministration supported Saddam,"
he said. "The situation in Israel
and the West Bank is getting worse
and worse and worse . . . commit-
