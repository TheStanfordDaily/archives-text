# Bears ate Cardinal for breakfast

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
It has been a season of role reversal for the Stan
ford football team, and Saturday's 112 inale against Cali
fornia was no exception. Having won seven straight
Big C lames, the Cardinal had long had its way with the
Bears. But this year was, of course, different.
Cal came into the game 11-point favorites, and,
just like Stanford was used to doing in years past, the
Bears easily put away an inferior opponent and took
home the Axe.
The Cardinal, for all its fei-vency, could not mount
a challenge against the Bears and failed to reach the
Cal red /one once during the last 50 minutes of the
contest. The usually listless Bears seized the opportu
nity and did not let up.
"From the beginning, they had tremendous confi
dence," said senior wide receiver Ryan Wells.
And the Cardinal?
"Tremendous desperation," Wells said.
year, Stanford finished 9-2 and went on to

play in the Seatde Bowl; Cal was 1-10, and that was
only because it played Division l-AA doormat Rut
gers. A year later, Stanford is 2-9 (1 -7 Pacific-10 Con
ference), and the Bears are 7-5 (4-4 Pac-10) and
would be headed to a bowl if NCAA violations hadn't
rendered them ineligible.
"Anybody associated with the [Stanford] program
has got to be disappointed," said head coach Buddy
Teevens.
For the players, it was a mystifying year.
"I never, ever thought this season would've gone
the way it did," Wells said.
Senior running back Kerry Carter added," I don't
know what to think right now. I'm disappointed,
heartbroken. This is probably one of the worst feel
ings I've had."
While the Cardinal players experienced their first
Big Game loss, Cal partied like it was 1994.
"I used to feel like we were cursed in this game, be
cause whatever happened, they always seemed to
have the upper hand in this game,"
said senior Bears cornerback and
punt returner Jemeel Powell. "After
what we went through for all those
years, it was time. It was payback.
We earned this day."
It wasn't just role reversal for the
players and coaches, though Cal
and Stanford fans both found them
selves in unfamiliar positions.
Memorial Stadium's atten
dance of 71,224 was a sellout, the
first since 1994's Big Game, which
incidentally was the last one Cal
had won. About eighty percent of
the stadium was clad in gold and
blue, a change from previous
years. TheCal fans were many and
noisy, and the student section put
on an impressive display of various
pro-Cal pictures and words by the
coordinated use of colored signs
en masse.
"I've never seen the fans like

that in here," Cal senior corner
back Nnamdi Asomugha said.
"The excitement was all over the
building."
After the game, Cal students —
almost none of whom had gradu
ated from high school the last
time the Bears won Big Game —
were allowed by security to rush
the field and celebrated by raising
Cal quarterback Kyle Boiler onto
their shoulders. The security
stood aside, as their only mission
was to prevent the goalposts from
being torn down. Despite the se
curity guards' efforts, both goal
posts were eventually brought
down by Berkeley students, after
they assaulted police and event
staff'. Contrast this celebration to,
say, last year's Big Game, in which
Stanford utilized police in riot
gear to make sure nobody had
any such fun.
In short, Cal's fans and players
are going into the offseason on a
high note.
"People will forget about me in
tlu' next couple of months," Cal se

nior tailback Joe Igber said, "[but]
we got the win. We got ihe Axe.
That's all that matters."
For the Cardinal, seeing its
archrival in such good spirits has
motivated it to work harder this off
season, in hopes that eventually
hard work will translate into re
newed success.
"We've got to go back to work to
ensure that this doesn't happen to
us again," Teevens said. "A number
of the players grabbed me inside
[the locker room, after the game]
and said, 'When do we start?' "
Senior offensive lineman Greg
Schindler referenced the program's
history: "Twice in my five years, we
rebounded from losing seasons to
go to ;i bowl game."
No one can say what the future
will hold, but the Cardinal is deter
mined to make Saturday's exercise
in trading places a one-time affair.
"We're all ready to go out, and
work our butts and be a complete
ly different team next season,"
freshman quarterback Kyle Mat
ter said."
