It's one thing to win a close
game — to go head-to-head with a
nationally ranked opponent, to
contend down to the very last sec
ond and come out with a win. But
it's quite another to simply domi
nate a squad, to take them out of
the game from the very start.

Yesterday: Stanford 79 Rice 62

In Stanford's 79-62 defeat over
unranked Rice last night at Maples
Pavilion, two very different Cardi
nal teams showed up.
I he difference between the first
and second halves of play were
quite emblematic of the largest
question still surrounding this
Stanford team: Can the Cardinal
consistently play up to its burgeon
ing potential? »
In the first half, it didn't look
that way as Stanford couldn't seem
to pull away from the Owls, with
11 lead changes taking place in the
first 20 minutes.
Despite its shaky play in the
first half, the Cardinal went into
the locker room with a one-point
lead. On the olfensive end, Rice
outshot Stanford in the first half,
bitting 50 percent from the 3-
point line and going 14-of-30
from the field.
"I thought Rice was very well
prepared," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "They
came in and surprised us with
their quickness and speed."
But Rice's offensive prowess
could not outdo the Cardinal for
long, as Stanford stepped up its
productivity in the second half,
closing the game on a 25-7 run.
Two Stanford guards had ca
reer-high scoring nights.
Senior Julius Barnes finished
the game with 28 points off 9-fbr
-17 shooting from the field. Going
8-for-l I from the 3-point line,
Barnes lied a school record for the
most 3-pointers in a game, set in

1988 by Terry Taylor.
Junior shooting guard Matt
Lottich added 22 points to the
Cardinal scoring effort, going 6-
for-10 from behind the arc. The
Barnes-Lottich duo made up 63
percent of Stanford's total offense
and all of the Cardinal's 3-point
scoring. The 14 3-pointers made
by the two were one short of a
school record.
"I think early, when [Rice] went
into that zone, they really packed it
in, and we got a lot of open shots,"
Lottich said. "I think they scouted
the Boston [University] game
when we didn't shoot [the ball]
very well."
"Obviously Matt and Julius shot
the ball pretty well," added Mont
gomery. "[But] we weren't as men
tally prepared as we needed to be."
Regardless of Barnes and Lot
tich's heroic shooting perfor
mances, it was Stanford's collective
defensive performance that really
paid dividends.
Once again, the Cardinal's
newly implemented 1-3 zone
troubled its opponent. In the
second half, especially, Rice
failed to get into an offensive
rhythm. The Owls scored only
23 points in the second half and
only nine in the final eight min
utes of the game.
"In the past, we put in a zone
and the guys didn't work," Mont
gomery said. "These guys have re
ally responded to it. They have a
lot of confidence in it.
" This |team] is not a finished
product yet. It's going to be game
by game."
()n a side note, the Cardinal will
have to wait a little bit longer for
the return of junior forward Teyo
Johnson. Johnson, who also plays
wide receiver for the Stanford
football team, sprained his left
knee in the closing minutes of the
Cardinal's 30-7 loss to California
in Saturday's Big Game. Doctors
anticipate that his return will be
delayed three to four weeks, ac
cording to the Stan ford Media Re
lations Department.
