Women's Soccer
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 1,
Notre Dame 0, NCAA Third Round

The roles were finally reversed
on Saturday night, as senior for
ward Marcia Wallis' strike in the
81st minute sent Stanford into the
NCAA quarterfinals and sent Notre
Dame back home to South Bend.
The CCardinal will move on to t he
quarterfinals for only the second
time in the program's history —
the first being in 1993 when the
squad was defeated by North Car
olina in Chapel Hill.
Saturday's third-round match —
which was played in front of 2,629,
t he largest crowd ever t<»watcl i a s(x>
cer game at Stanford — began with
injury-depleted Notre Dame domi
nating the attack and dictating the
style of play. Hie speed of the game
seemed to lx" much higher than the
Cardinal was used to and created
some confusion and giveaways on
the Stanford side of the field.
Just seven minutes into the con

test, one such giveaway resulted in
one of Notre Dame's best scoring
chances. Junior attacker Amy
Warner stole the ball oil an at
tempted Cardinal clear and found
herself with a clean shot at the topol
the box. I ler shot, however, sailed
harmlessly over the crossbar.
That play marked what was a
very physical, quick game being
played by the Irish.
"They made it very difficult,"
Stanford co-coach Paul Sapsford
said. " They tackled very hard but
very fairly. We didn't have a lot of
time on the ball."
"We hoped we could throw
something at them that they're not
used to seeing," said Notre Dame
head coach Randy Waldrum.
It was a style that stymied the
usual potent Stanford attack for the
first 20 minutes of the match. Pres
sure around senior midfielder Cal
lie Withers collapsed some space of
the field and made it difficult for
Stanford to move the ball up to the
attack. It was only after Stanford
adapted that the scoring chances
began to come.
"When we started to compete
with them at their level, that's when
the game changed in my mind,"
Sapsford said.
Much ol this change was spread
