Women's Soccer
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 1,
Notre Dame 0, NCAA Third Round

The roles were finally reversed
on Saturday night, as senior for
ward Marcia Wallis' strike in the
81st minute sent Stanford into the
NCAA quarterfinals and sent Notre
Dame back home to South Bend.
The CCardinal will move on to t he
quarterfinals for only the second
time in the program's history —
the first being in 1993 when the
squad was defeated by North Car
olina in Chapel Hill.
Saturday's third-round match —
which was played in front of 2,629,
t he largest crowd ever t<»watcl i a s(x>
cer game at Stanford — began with
injury-depleted Notre Dame domi
nating the attack and dictating the
style of play. Hie speed of the game
seemed to lx" much higher than the
Cardinal was used to and created
some confusion and giveaways on
the Stanford side of the field.
Just seven minutes into the con

test, one such giveaway resulted in
one of Notre Dame's best scoring
chances. Junior attacker Amy
Warner stole the ball oil an at
tempted Cardinal clear and found
herself with a clean shot at the topol
the box. I ler shot, however, sailed
harmlessly over the crossbar.
That play marked what was a
very physical, quick game being
played by the Irish.
"They made it very difficult,"
Stanford co-coach Paul Sapsford
said. " They tackled very hard but
very fairly. We didn't have a lot of
time on the ball."
"We hoped we could throw
something at them that they're not
used to seeing," said Notre Dame
head coach Randy Waldrum.
It was a style that stymied the
usual potent Stanford attack for the
first 20 minutes of the match. Pres
sure around senior midfielder Cal
lie Withers collapsed some space of
the field and made it difficult for
Stanford to move the ball up to the
attack. It was only after Stanford
adapted that the scoring chances
began to come.
"When we started to compete
with them at their level, that's when
the game changed in my mind,"
Sapsford said.
Much ol this change was spread

Senior Marcia Wallis, the Pac-10 Player of the Year, scored the only goal of
the night in Stanford's 1 -0 victory over Notre Dame, advancing the Cardinal
to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.
ing the field on runs up the flanks.
Freshman striker Jennifer Faren
baugh was especially dangerous, as
she took through balls from the
back line and midfield and pushed
the attack up the field.
That manner of attack gave her
team a spectacular chance in the
37th minute. Farenbaugh took a
pass from the back line, outran her
defender up the side of the field and
dished the ball to Brittany Oliveira
just as si le was tackled. ()liveira\s shot
over the advancing Irish keeper
sailed just wide of the net, however.
11isl four minutes later the Car
dinal found itsell with another
chance as junior defender Natalie
Spilger sent a Iwautilul through ball
to junior forward Man ic Ward.
Ward headed the ball to Wallis,

whose shot was blocked by Notre
Dame keeper Frica Bohn.
I hough Bohn recorded only
five saves on the night, many of
them were spectacular efforts.
"She kept us in the game," Irish
freshman defender Cat Sigler said.
"She was exceptional."
"All credit to their goalkeeper,"
Sapsfbrd agreed. "She had a
tremendous game."
Because of the play of Bohn and
the standard defensive pressure of
the Stanford back four, the half
ended scoreless.
Notre Dame found itself with an
other chance just 12 minutes into
the second half as a scramble fora
loose I),ill in front of the Stanford
goal resulted in a moment of confu
sion, but the final shot was easily
saved by Stanford sophomore
keeper Nicole Barnhart.
I he Cardinal found itself in a
similar situation in the 79th minute
as a Stanford corner brought about

a scrum in front, of the Notre Dame
net fora few moments before the
ball was safely cleared by a defender.
I lowever, it would be just two
minutes later that the Cardinal
would find the back of the net, as
Withers headed a clearing pass at
midfield up lo Wallis. Wallis turned
the corner 011 her defender and sh(>t
a laser along the ground just inside
the far post, out of Holm's reach.
The Cardinal back line — which
many on the Stanford side credited
with the win — would preserve (lie
lead through a final flurry of Notre
Dame attacks to send the Cardinal
on to next weekend s quarterfinals.
"We have the best back four in the
c< >unl iy," Wit hers added. "If we have
any problems, it's going to lx* us stor
ing. not us being scored on."
The defense — and the rest of
the team — will get its next test Sat
urday against Portland, with the
winner moving on to the College
Cup Final Four in Austin, Texas.
