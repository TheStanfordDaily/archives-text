these two teams that also ended up in Stanford's
favor by a four-point margin.
According to Rutgers coach Vivian Stringer,
last year's team had the luxury of focusing on
only a few Stanford stars. This year, however, the
Starlet Knights could not afford to ignore any
Stanford players because everyone was an offen
sive threat.

With a depleted rosier, Stanford depended on
ils outstanding group of sophomores: guards
Kelley Suminski and Susan King, forwards
1 Nae I hiel, Azella Ferryman and Sebnem
Kimyaeioglu and center Chelsea Trotter. The
sophomores scored all but four of Stanford's (H
total points.
In the first hall, Stanford outplayed Rutgers
mentally with intelligent passing and a balanced
offense. Five different players took Stanford's
first five shots of the game. And when Rutgers
overcommitted defensively, guards
King and Snminski kepi the Scarlet
Knights honest by attacking the bas
ket aggressively.
Despite its athleticism, Rutgers'
offense in the first half was sloppy
and out of sync. Freshman guard
Cappie Pondexter, a preseason
second-team Big East selection,
forced up some questionable shots

and generally seemed out of
rhythm in her first collegiate
game. According to Stringer, her
team showed a lac k of patience in
its shot selection.
"Wedon't have Stanford's shoot
ing. We tried to switch places with
Stanford," she said.
After the game, Stanford
coach Lara VanDerveer, unable
to single out one key player,
praised the performance of
Kimyacioglu, Perryman, Sumins
ki, Thiel and King.
"When things got bad, our team

got good," VanDerveer said.
"When things really looked the
worst, we started playing our best.
We dug in. We climbed back out of
a hole. 1 was really excited, not nec
essarily about our play, but about
our determination."
Suminski's play, in particular,
embodied that determination. As
one of Stanford's primary ball
handlers (along with King), she
countered Rutgers' relentless and
physical pressure with steady
poise. She played all 40 minutes
and held Pondexter to 14 points
on 6-for-18 shooting.
Suminski, Thiel, Perryman and
Kimyacioglu all scored in double
figures.
Sunday's game against USF was
equally physical and intense, with
the Cardinal pulling out a 59-57
victory.
In the first half, Stanford outshot
San Francisco, converting on 53.8
percent of its attempts compared
with only 29.6 percent for the Lady
Dons. In particular, Trotter's drop
step move on the low block was un
stoppable as she contributed eight
of her career-high 14 points in the
first half.
In front of 2,543 screaming fans
in USF's War Memorial Gym, the
Lady Dons made it clear, however,
that there would be no uncontested
shots for the Cardinal.
Stanford survived (lie first half
with a 32-26 lead, but in the second
half, the Lady Dons finally found
their shooting touch and forced
Stanford to make big plays to win
the game. The Lady Dons connect
ed on two 3-pointers early to tie the
contest at 34-34 with 16:17 left.
I here would be six lead changes
the rest of the way.
With Stanford down 57-54 with
1:10 left in the game, Kimyacioglu
recovered a broken play and
drained a 3-pointer to tie the game.
Stanford won the game on a
post-up basket by Suminski with 15
seconds to play.
"We were veiy fortunate to leave
with a win," VanDerveer said.
" I hey played us very tough. We did
a really good job getting the ball in
side and we made some big shots."
