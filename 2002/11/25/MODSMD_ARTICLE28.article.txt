Men's Cross Country
at NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Ind., Today, 9:00 a.m.

So fin' t his year, the squad has
been able to control and dominate
every race it has entered by running
as a pack. I lie confidence and sup
port that running with teammates
gives has led Stanford to one of its
most successful seasons ever.
With such a strong strategy, lit
tle is expected to change today in
Terre Haute, Ind., as Stanford
seeks its third national title in the
last seven years.
"It's a big mistake to treat this
rate any different," said junior
Adam Tenforde. "I've just devel
oped good habits and a good rou
tine. There is no reason to change
anything now. It's still just a six
mile race."
That fix used attitude and confi
dence can be seen across the team
— running together during work
outs, racing together, controlling
the pace in each meet and celebrat

ing each victory, looking for the
next.
"There is great chemistry on
this team," said Vin Lananna, di
rector of cross country and track
and field. " The guys are poised for
the challenges and enthusiastic for
the possibilities."
I 'he team's quest for the title will
not go unchallenged, however.
One of the strongest and deepest
fields in the history of the NCAA is
converging today on the Indiana
State course.
"We are racing 150 teams, and we
will not count any of them out,"
I .anaiina said." I here are obviously
different tiers of teams, but we can
not locus on just the top tier like
Northern Arizona and Arkansas."
Tenforde added, "It is danger
ous to c hoose one team to key off.
Other teams are going to do what
they will do. You have to run your
own race."
In the team competition, several
schools are expected to challenge
the Cardinal for the title.
No. 2 Arkansas enters the cham
pionships as a team known for per
forming big when it counts.
Arkansas has been one of the most
successful cross country programs
ever, claiming six of the last 10 na
tional championships.
The Razorbacks are lead by ju
nior Alistair Cragg, who is a con
tender for the individual title.
Colorado, the defending cham
pion, was dealt a blow when its No.

2 runner, Dathan Ritzenhein, was
diagnosed with a stress fracture.
However, the strength of the Buf
faloes' front runners has kept them
at the No. 3 spot in the polls most of
the year.
Colorado senior Jorge Torres is
hoping to become only the third
U.S.-horn NCAA cross country
champion in the last 15 years.
"I'm not going to be satisfied un
less I win a national championship,"
lories told the Denver Post.
In the individual competition,
Boa/ Cheboiywo of Eastern Michi
gan, the defending champion, has
had .i difficult early season, but re
turned to form last week, dominat
ing the Great Likes Regional race.
David Rimani of Alabama took
the NCAA individual title as a 112 resh
man in 1999. He looks to regain the
top of the podium after overcoming
injuries and defeating Arkansas'
Cragg twice this year.
But in a field this deep — and
with the uncertain conditions of
cross country — almost anything
can happen, and Stanford hopes to
have some individual contenders of
its own.
fhe athletes that will represent
Stanford today are a secret Linanna
will reveal when his runners toe the
starting line. But from a roster filled
with Ail-American candidates,
Ltnanna will be able to put together
a very dominant team as usual.
"I think we have five guys who
can contend for the individual tide,"
Liinanna said. "But it is most impor
tant that they not be selfish and hurt
the team."
The Cardinal's lineup of seven
will likely include Stanford's four re
turning All-Americans, who are all
in great shape heading into the race
this year. Juniors Don Sage and
Grant Robison respectively won the
Western Regional and Pacific-10
Conference individual titles. Ju
niors lan Dobson and Louis Luchi
ni are also in top form after finishing
third and fifth, respectively, at the
regional championships.
Reemerging as an elite distance
runner after redshirting last season,
Tenforde is expected to represent
the Cardinal today after competing
at the national championships dur
ing his freshman year.
"This is the best team I have
ever been on," Tenforde said. "I
think we are in the right mindset
to capitalize on all the opportuni
ties that await us at national
championships."

I ERRE HAUTE, Intl. — It was widely noted sev
eral times before Big Game that both Stanford and
California's seasons would be defined by their per
formance in that one game. Stanford was looking to
offset a poor record, while bowl-less Cal desperately
wanted to regain the Axe after its seven-year resi
dence in Palo Alto.

Women's Cross Country
at NCAA Championships in Terre Haute, Ind., Today, 10:00 a.m

Two days after the Cardinal football team took
the spotlight, today is the day for the No. 2 Stanford
women's cross country team. At the NCAA Champi
onships in Terre Haute, Ind., the Cardinal will toe
the line as one of the favorites for the national crown.
Unlike the football team, however, this race is not
about erasing memories of poor performances in
the early season — the team won each of its races by
a large margin — or holding tough against a rival,
although an epic battle against No. 1 Brigham
Young has been brewing throughout the year.
Today is simply about winning the national
championship.
Although the runners can look back on the first
part of their season with satisfaction, a win at nation
als has been the team's focus throughout the year.
Two years ago, the Cardinal runners were sur
prised by the 17-degree temperature at the start of
the race and placed third. Last year, the team was
ranked No. 1 in the country aftei a dominating sea
son, but faded to fifth at the NCAAs.
This year, the team feels it's ready for anything.
"We are 112 ully prepared to race the Indiana | State]
course as if it were our home course," senior Malin
di Elmore said. "After racing 11lie Pre-NCAA Meet
on Oct. 19], we all have a good idea of what to ex
pect. Regardless of what comes our way on Monday
— snow, low temperatures, crowds, any other sur
prises. We are ready to make the course our own."
At the Pre-NCAA meet, held on the same course
as today's NCAA Championship, the Stanford team
easily won its race. However, so many teams want to
race on the course that the organizers were forced to
divide the field into two separate races.
Heading up the field in the other race was de
fending national champion BYU, which similarly
dominated its race.
Last weekend, NCAA Regional meets were held
across the country, with the top two teams in each
race automatically qualifying for nationals. Stanford
easily won the Western Regional, held on the Cardi
nal's home course, by a margin of 46 points over sec
ond-placed Arizona State.
At the Mountain Regional, BYU took first over
No. 3 Colorado by 37 points. Both teams looked ex
tremely strong, packing all their runners near the
front of the field.
However, correlating results between different
races is extremely difficult. For example, with only
10 days between regionals and nationals, some Stan
ford runners backed off a bit in the regional race to
save their legs for today's big meet.
"I took the pace out easier in the regional meet

because I had a cold and was trying not to push it too
hard," said senior Lauren Fleshman. "With nation
als only 10 days after regionals, it was no time to put
it all on the line for the sake of pride. My team needs
me in top condition [for nationals], so that required
taking regionals a little easier to ensure good
health."
In late August, the Stanford team traveled to the
Cal State-Fullerton Invitational and handily won its
season-opening race, with sophomores Sara Bei and
Alicia Craig tying for the individual victory.
It was a harbinger of things to come: The team
has remained undefeated since then, recording wins
at the Stanford Invitational on Sept. 21 in both the
4,000-meter and 6,000-meter races, the Notre
Dame Invitational on Oct. 4, the Pre-NCAA Meet,
the Pacific-10 Conference Championships on Nov. 2
and the Western Regionals. Moreover, team mem
bers took the individual event victories in all but two
of those races.
It has been an almost perfect season for the Car
dinal. free of injuries and full of victories. But after
months of hard work, it's now a one-shot season —
nationals is what matters.
"[At today's meet], I will have a much more ag
gressive second half of the race," Fleshman said.
"There will be no reason to hold back, no more
races to prepare for. I hope we all find ourselves in
a position to work our way toward the front togeth
er at nationals."

The Cardinal men race for the national title today in Indiana. Carrying the
nation's top ranking into the championships, the squad must fend of
Arkansas and defending champs Colorado.

The No. 2 Cardinal finished a disappointing fifth in last
year's NCAA Championships, but having dominated
West Regionals, Stanford is in prime position to upset the
defending national champions — No. 1 BYU.
