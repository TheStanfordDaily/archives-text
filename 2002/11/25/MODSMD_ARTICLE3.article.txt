# DIVERSITY IN ACTION
## After decades of affirmative action at Stanford, many still are unclear about the University's policy 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the "Take Affirmative Action
Day" celebration in White Plaza earlier
this month as well as the announcement
that Stanford now has the highest black
student yield rate among top colleges
nationwide, many students are unclear
about what exactly the University's affir
mative action policy is and what role it
plays in promoting on-campus diversity.
A difficult concept to define
Affirmative action is often misconstrued
as being based primarily on quotas.
Asked to define the concept, a senior
who wished to remain anonymous said,
"Affirmative action is the system that en
forces quotas. Like, you have to hire a
certain number of black people or a cer
tain number of women, even if they
aren't necessarily best suited for the job."
However, more recent forms of affir
mative action are more subtly imple

merited and less specific than numerical
requirements.
Diversity plans without quotas or
other requirements are now considered
by many to be affirmative action policies
even if particular results are not man
dated. For example, affirmative action
can be as simple as more comprehensive
outreach efforts to ensure a satislactory
distribution within an applicant pool.
Aside from terminology issues, an
other persistent source of confusion is
the misunderstood legal history sur
rounding affirmative action.
Prop 209 prohibits affirmative action
at UC and Cal State schools
"1 don't even think there is an affir
mative action right now," responded ju
nior Adam I laas when asked about Stan
lord's current approach toward affirma
tive action. "Wasn't that outlawed by
(California a lew years back?"
Proposition 209, an anti-affirmative
action initiative that was passed by Cali-

fornia voters in 1996, outlaws any favor
ing of minorities by state public institu
tions and programs. This law has result
ed in significant repercussions for diver
sity levels at universities that are admin
istered by the state, such as the UC and
Cal State systems.
But because this proposition does not
apply to private institutions like Stan
ford, it has not hindered or affected the
University's affirmative action policies.
Another complicating factor is that

there are actually two distinct compo
nents that comprise the University's
affirmative action plan: the policies
that relate to faculty and staff hiring,
and the policies that focus on admis
sion practices.
Faculty diversity policy governed by law
Robert Weisberg, a law professor and
special assistant to the provost for re-

cruitment and retention, explained
Stanford's approach toward hiring
faculty members.
"The gist of it is that the Univer
sity will take extraordinary efforts in
recruiting faculty to identify out
standing candidates who would
lend diversity to the faculty [and]
who might not come to our atten
tion or get full consideration
through more conventional chan
nels," Weisberg said.
LaDoris Cordell, vice provost
of campus relations, said that sev
eral specific federal laws have set
the guidelines for Stanford's hir
ing policies.
Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act requires employers to
comply with non-discrimination
policies for faculty and staff.
The 1972 Title IX of the so
called "Education Amendments" to
the Civil Rights Act prohibits dis
crimination based on gender in ed
ucational institutions.
Executive Order 11246, which
was signed in 1978 by President
Jimmy Carter, specifically affects
entities that contract with the feder
al government.
"It requires that there not be un
lawful discrimination with respect
to hiring, promotions and compen
sation for employees of federal con
tractors," Cordell said. "With re
spect to universities, employees are
staff and faculty."
However, according to
Cordell, none of the aforemen
tioned laws permit quotas in hir
ing or promotions.

"The law requires us to use our
best efforts in ensuring that the
hiring and promotions of women
and minorities are non-discrimi
natory," Cordell said. "The law
requires us to reach out to the
available pool."
Stanford considers race
in admissions
"We work hard to ensure a di
verse applicant pool through a mul
tifaceted approach to outreach,"
said Dean of Admission and Finan
cial Aid Robin Mamlet.
She explained that such efforts
include targeting prospective
students through print publica
tions and informational pro
grams, partnering with organiza
tions that work with students of
diverse backgrounds, and using
current undergraduates and
alumni to help attract and recruit
students of underrepresented
backgrounds.
According to Mamlet, Stan
ford considers factors such as eth
nicity when making admission
decisions to "ensure that Stan
ford's presence is among the
leadership of all communities."
"With diversity in our applicant
pool comes diversity in our admit
tance," Mamlet said. " This diversity
affects the student body in all of the
ways that our students experience
the University. As students learn so
much from one another, the range
of perspectives affects learning both
in and out of the classroom."
The results of Stanford's
affirmative action policies
Mate Wais, clean of students,
stated that Stanford's affirmative
ac tion policies have led to increased

on-campus diversity.
"This diversity enriches the
quality, depth and scope of our
teaching, learning and research,"
Wais said. "Stanford's diversity
makes it a more vibrant and in
teresting place for students to live
and learn."
Wais' observations are corrobo
rated by available figures on com
position of the faculty and student
body over the past years.
()ver the four decades since af
firmative ad ion policies were first
embraced by Stanford in the
19605, student enrollment has
becoming increasingly diverse in
respect to all types of minorities,
including women, African-Amer
icans, Latinos, Native-Americans
and Asian-Americans.
An equalizer or an unfair edge?
While it may succeed in bring
ing about greater diversity, affir
mative action both at Stanford
and elsewhere remains a contro
versial solution.
Junior David Vytle, president of
the Stanford National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People, said affirmative action "is
not a handout, it is just making
things more equal."
I Ie also explained how "affirma
tive action does not necessarily de
note one particular ethnicity or an
other," and that there are many mi
norities benefiting, not just women
and African-Americans.
"The policies are a lot more
far-stretching than many think,"
Vytle said.
Prof, of Education Kenji 1 laku
taa said that"the main disadvantage
is if the system is inflexible and leads
to rigid quotas or the admission of

students who are not able to com
pete fairly in the environment."
"It may also be seen as unfair by
those students who are not direct
beneficiaries," he added.
Not all students agree with affir
mative action as a principle.
Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore and
the president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans, pointed out that
lie does "not support racial discrim
ination of any sort," and he leels
that affirmative action is a form of
discrimination.
"Race discrimination attracts the
most ridiculous liberal circumlocu
tions, such as 'affirmative action,' "
Fairbanks said.
"No one can'argue that it is not
a violation of the Equal Protection
Clause in the 14th Amendment,"
he continued. "Racial discrimina
tion obviously has helped less
qualified minorities, usually blacks
and Hispanics, take the place of
more qualified applicants, usually
whites and Asians, in receiving a
college education or job. In that
way, it has helped a select few, but
it has been at the expense of many
others and the bedrock of the 14th
Amendment."
The future of affirmative action
Critics have questioned how
long affirmative action policies
should remain in place, while oth
ers feel that no concrete deadline
should be set.
"The primary purpose of affir
mative action is to address and
prevent systematic discrimina
tion," said Sheila Laqui, a sopho
more and the legislative director of
the ASSU. "I don't believe such
policies should be limited to a cer
tain time frame."
