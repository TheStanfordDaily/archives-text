# DIVERSITY IN ACTION
## After decades of affirmative action at Stanford, many still are unclear about the University's policy 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Despite the "Take Affirmative Action
Day" celebration in White Plaza earlier
this month as well as the announcement
that Stanford now has the highest black
student yield rate among top colleges
nationwide, many students are unclear
about what exactly the University's affir
mative action policy is and what role it
plays in promoting on-campus diversity.
A difficult concept to define
Affirmative action is often misconstrued
as being based primarily on quotas.
Asked to define the concept, a senior
who wished to remain anonymous said,
"Affirmative action is the system that en
forces quotas. Like, you have to hire a
certain number of black people or a cer
tain number of women, even if they
aren't necessarily best suited for the job."
However, more recent forms of affir
mative action are more subtly imple

merited and less specific than numerical
requirements.
Diversity plans without quotas or
other requirements are now considered
by many to be affirmative action policies
even if particular results are not man
dated. For example, affirmative action
can be as simple as more comprehensive
outreach efforts to ensure a satislactory
distribution within an applicant pool.
Aside from terminology issues, an
other persistent source of confusion is
the misunderstood legal history sur
rounding affirmative action.
Prop 209 prohibits affirmative action
at UC and Cal State schools
"1 don't even think there is an affir
mative action right now," responded ju
nior Adam I laas when asked about Stan
lord's current approach toward affirma
tive action. "Wasn't that outlawed by
(California a lew years back?"
Proposition 209, an anti-affirmative
action initiative that was passed by Cali-

fornia voters in 1996, outlaws any favor
ing of minorities by state public institu
tions and programs. This law has result
ed in significant repercussions for diver
sity levels at universities that are admin
istered by the state, such as the UC and
Cal State systems.
But because this proposition does not
apply to private institutions like Stan
ford, it has not hindered or affected the
University's affirmative action policies.
Another complicating factor is that

there are actually two distinct compo
nents that comprise the University's
affirmative action plan: the policies
that relate to faculty and staff hiring,
and the policies that focus on admis
sion practices.
