### MARK DOMINIK EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet
last Friday explained Stanford's new early admission
program to a group of about 50 students who work as
tour guides or admissions ambassadors. The University
had announced on Nov. 6 that it was discontinuing its
binding Early Decision program and transitioning to a
non-binding, single-choice Farlv Action program.
Mamlet explained that the reason the Office of
Undergraduate Admission decided to discontinue
its binding Early Decision program is that it put
undue pressure on high schoolers.
"Early decision has acquired a bad name," Mam
let said. "A lot of students are feeling pressured to
apply early, and pressure is unhealthy even for the
strongest of students."
Mamlet said that she has been trying since she ar
rived at Stanford to get more accurate information
about Early Decision into the spotlight of the na
tional media, but this fall decided that Stanford had
to revise its policy.
She entered into talks with University President
John Hennessy and Provost John Ftchemendy. Ihe
three had decided to announce their decision to go to a
single-choice Early Action program after the deadline
for this year's Early Decision applicants in order to avoid
confusion. But on Nov. f>, Yale's announcement of a

similar policy forced Stanford's hand.
"That morning I was talking to high school coun
selors," Mamlet said. "I defended Early Decision,
but then described my ideal plan — single-choice
Early Action.
"After that meeting I began to get calls from The
New York Times and Newsweek. 1 had to decide with
the president and provost what we should do. We de
cided there was a lot to be gained by going ahead and
implementing this new program."
A traditional Early Action program would have
put too much pressure on the Admissions ()ftice to
read a burgeoning number of applications in only

six weeks. So Mamlet decided to
offer a non-traditional, single
choice Early Action plan.
"If we had chosen to have a
standard Early Action program,
we'd simply have two different
deadlines and no control on ap
plying early — we'd be flooded
with applications," she said.
The problem with offering a
single-choice Early Action pro

gram is that it is in violation of
guidelines set out by the National
Association for College Admis
sion Counseling, which recog
nizes only binding Early Decision
and standard Early Action as ac
ceptable admissions policies.
Mamlet said she hopes that
Stanford, Yale and the national as
sociation will come together to
work on a viable solution to the ap
parent breach between the organi
zation and the schools.
"The national association has a
year and a half to work with us,"
she said. "I think this will work."
