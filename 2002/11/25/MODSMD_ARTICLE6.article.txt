# Hewlett funds go to new programs
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's a lot that can be accomplished with a gilt
nearly twice as large as the annual gross domestic
product of the Federated States of Micronesia. From
endowing professorships to strengthening old acad
emic programs and implementing new ones, the
University — in particular the School of Humanities
and Sciences — is undergoing a period of strategic
planning aimed at making full use of a windfall $400
million gilt from the Hewlett Foundation presented
to the University in 2001.
Three hundred million dollars of the gift will go to
the School of I fumanities and Sciences, with the re
mainder going toward the $1 billion goal set by the
Campaign for Undergraduate Education.
"It is tlu* largest gilt to Stanford ever," said Rob
Franklin, the associate dean of external relations for
H&S, who oversees the gifts that the school receives.
Indeed, while there have been larger university
wide gifts, including a recent $000 million donation
to Cal Tech, the Hewlett gift is believed to be the
largest ever to a specific school within a university.
"At least $150 million will be used for matching
funds," Franklin said, referring to a practice designed
to provide an incentive for other would-be donors.
For gifts between $250,000 and $999,999, the
1 lewlett Foundation will match each donation at a I
to-2 ratio. For gifts of at least $1 million, the founda
tion will match at a rate of 1 -to-1.
The school of H&S received a total of $15 million
from the Hewlett gift during the 2002 fiscal year,
with another $5 million going to CUE. Franklin fore
sees a substantially larger payment in 2003.
These funds are "intended to build endow
ment" for new professorships and academic pro
grams, he said.
The school has made a good start in both areas
already. The Hewlett gift has already helped
endow new professorships in the fields of Asian
studies, American studies and economics, along
with several professorships that will be available to
H&S as a whole.
Academic programs in H&S have reaped major
benefits as well. One of the priorities for the gift is
setting up endowments for the new Islamic studies
program, the center for comparative studies in
race and ethnicity, Asian studies, the language cen
ter and film studies.
The University is also planning a new program
on theoretical physics, according to Franklin.
Of the $ 100 million set aside for CUE, "$5O mil
lion is to be used for scholarships," Franklin said.
The other $50 million is designated for under
graduate academic programs.
The Overseas Studies Program will be another re
cipient of money from the 1 lewlett Foundation's gift.
OSP has set out to raise $50 million in order to endow
its already established centers and to expand into
new locations around the world.
The gift comes at a time when I I&S is feeling in
creasing budgetary constraints.
When the gilt was given to Stan
ford, University President John
Hennessy noted that proper re
search funding was not available
for professors in the humanities
and the sciences.
"Our school is under-en
dowed relative to other universi
ties," Franklin said. "In compari
son to our key competitors, we
are at a disadvantage."
H&S, which is the youngest
school at Stanford, provides 90
percent of the University's under
graduate instruction and presents
nearly half the doctoral degrees,
but it receivesjust 14 percent of the
University's endowment.
Walter 1 lewlett, who presented
the University with the gift in
memory of his father William
Hewlett, cited budgetary concerns
as one of his main motives lor mak
ing the donation.
"I have noticed increased
budgetary pressures on the
school," he said. "I started to see
major changes — billets going
unfilled, faculty salaries not
keeping up, students under-sup
ported. It became clear to me
that if something wasn't done to
put the school on a more linn fi
nancial footing, there would be
major deterioration."
fhe gift was also given in part
to motivate other philanthropists
to give generously to academic
institutions.
"We hope, too, that this gift will
encourage others in the philan

thropic world — individuals 'as
well as foundations —to think
boldly about making major com
mitments to the universities and
other institutions that are impor
tant to our future," Hewlett foun
dation Director James CI. (iaither
said when he presented 11 it* gift to
the University in 2001.
The budgetary problems
Hewlett hoped to alleviate intensi
fied recently when l'rovost John
Eteheniendy announced a hiring
freeze and an approximately 8
percent budget c ut lor 2004. I low
ever, 1 l&Sdoes not plan to use the
1 lewlett gift as a stopgap.
"Dean Long has articulated
the principle that this gift will not
be used to shore up the deficit,"
Franklin said. Instead, it will be
used "to strengthen the school

lor the future."
Despite admitting that "the
economy is definitely having an
impact" on recent giving, Franklin
allowed for cautious optimism.
"We're always talking to peo
ple," he said. 1 le went on to men
tion a recent $7.5 million bequest
from an anonymous donor who
gave "decades of volunteer ser
vice to Stanford." 1 he gift will es
tablish a professorship in the hu
manities and provide lor under
graduate scholarships and a
graduate fellowship.
recent years, I l&S has man
aged to raise an annual sum of
$35-40 million in gifts. Last
year's total increased to $53 mil
lion, largely due to the $15 mil
lion received from the Hewlett
Foundation.
