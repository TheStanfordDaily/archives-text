# Dictatorship impedes freedom in Myanmar
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Zaw Lin I Iteik is currentl\ the only Stanford
undergraduate from Myanmar, a country of 4()
million people in Southeast Asia that is also
known as Burma, lie's a freshman struggling
through the normal adjustment to college life,
with the additional burden of living hours
and three plane rides from Yangon, the capital
of Myanmar, where he had lived his entire life
before coming to Stanford.
Although the military government that took
control of the country adopted the name Myan
mar in 1989, the United States has never rec
ognized the current government, and still offi
cially calls the country Burma. While Zaw Lin
Hteik bears a passport from Myanmar, his U.S.
visa identifies him as being from Burma.
Myanmar has recently had a slight loosening
of restrictions with the release of Aung San Suu
Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and arguably the
world's most famous political prisoner. Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy party
won the democratic elections in 1990, but the
military has never allowed her party to take
power. Still, there is no thriving democratic
movement. 1 he last peaceful protests in Myan
mar took place in 1988 and were crushed by the
military, resulting in about 3,000 deaths.
Yesterday, l'lie Daily sat clown with Zaw Lin
Hteik to talk to him about his experiences at
Stanford and his take on politics at home.
The Daily: What's it like being the first

Burmese student here?
Zaw Lin Hteik: First of all, 1 feel kind of
proud, you know, for my friends and my
country. Another thing is 112 feel kind of lonely
because I don't have any Burmese students to
talk to in my language.
TD: What made you want to come to the Unit
ed States?
ZLH: Nowadays most of the students from my
country go abroad after their high school educa
tion, at least to Malaysia, or Singapore, or anoth
er Southeast Asian country for education. Also,
many students go to the States because they be
lieve that it's the best plate tor education. People
in my country, like parents, they are very proud
when their students come to the United States.
People are now more interested in coming
to the United Slates. When I took the SAT,
there were about 40 students who took the test.
I hen, this year, there are more like 150-200
students in the whole country taking the SAT.
II seems like it is becoming more popular.
Three or four years ago there were just two or
three people taking the SAP.
TD: Why do students leave Myanmar for an
education? Does that have to do with your gov
ernment?
ZLH: [The government] is trying to change
policies and improve the education system;
however, in my country we don't have much
technology, even compared to Thailand, our
neighboring country. Technology is very dif
ferent. [Students] are quite sure [they] will get

;i better education abroad.
TD: Do you think the education will improve
in Myanmar? Do you think there will be a time
in the future when people stay?
ZLH: 1 don't think there will be many bigger
changes because we don't have technology.
TD: Tell us a little about the government. It's
a military dictatorship, correct?
ZLH: Yes, but when I lelt my country, two or
three months ago, the political situation was not
very stable; people were kind of expecting a
change. As far as 1 know, there hasn't been a
change yet. People are also quiet; they don't
take any initiative. At the moment, it's kind of
stable, but people are expecting a change. Usu-

politics at all.
TD: What's the economic situa
tion in Burma?
ZLH: Well, c urrently, two months
ago, inllation was very, very high.
TD: Did that make it hard to save,
and hard to have a stable income?
ZLI1: Yes. Prices really were rising
faster than incomes.
TD: So, the people generally
don't support the government,
but no one wants to speak out
against it?
ZLH: The media is somewhat
controlled. It's kind of the nature
of the Burmese people. Even in
history, Burmese people were

very content with their life. They
don't try to change things. 1 hey
will just focus on their life. Even
when our country was a British
colony, il was the same. It's kind
of a Burmese trait; people are
very content with what they have.
They just locus on their own life.
It may be kind of the religion
| Buddhism |, as well.
TD: Do you have access to any
media besides the state-con
trolled press in Myanmar?
ZLH: There are some weekly
newspapers these days; they
seem to be very informative. But
they're not for everyone. They're
a little expensive. Only the mid
dle class can buy them, not the
lower class.
TD: Do you have access to the In
ternet in Myanmar?
ZLH: They are trying to give us
more access. Both the government

and a private company are trying to
give us access, but access is very ex
pensive. We can't get access to some
sites, especially adult sites, gam
bling sites and maybe some political
sites; I'm not sure. Most people still
don't have Internet access.
TD: What was it like coining to a
country and speaking a language
you'd never spoken before?
ZLH: It takes some time to gel
used to it. 1 often get lost. When
I'm talking with a person one-on
one, it's OK. When I'm talking at
a dining table with four or live na
tive speakers, 1 usually get silent.
Because the stuff they're talking
about, I'm usually not very famil
iar with. 1 really miss talking in my
language. When 1 talked on the
phone with Burmese friends in
other colleges, I was so, so happy.
I'd never spoken English in
school before I got here. I just
learned it.

TD: What was it like coining to a
country and speaking a language
you'd never spoken before?
ZLH: It takes some time to gel
used to it. 1 often get lost. When
I'm talking with a person one-on
one, it's OK. When I'm talking at
a dining table with four or live na
tive speakers, 1 usually get silent.
Because the stuff they're talking
about, I'm usually not very famil
iar with. 1 really miss talking in my
language. When 1 talked on the
phone with Burmese friends in
other colleges, I was so, so happy.
I'd never spoken English in
school before I got here. I just
learned it.
Zaw Lin I Iteik is currentl\ the only Stanford
undergraduate from Myanmar, a country of 4()
million people in Southeast Asia that is also
known as Burma, lie's a freshman struggling
through the normal adjustment to college life,
with the additional burden of living hours
and three plane rides from Yangon, the capital
of Myanmar, where he had lived his entire life
before coming to Stanford.
Although the military government that took
control of the country adopted the name Myan
mar in 1989, the United States has never rec
ognized the current government, and still offi
cially calls the country Burma. While Zaw Lin
Hteik bears a passport from Myanmar, his U.S.
visa identifies him as being from Burma.
Myanmar has recently had a slight loosening
of restrictions with the release of Aung San Suu
Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and arguably the
world's most famous political prisoner. Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy party
won the democratic elections in 1990, but the
military has never allowed her party to take
power. Still, there is no thriving democratic
movement. 1 he last peaceful protests in Myan
mar took place in 1988 and were crushed by the
military, resulting in about 3,000 deaths.
Yesterday, l'lie Daily sat clown with Zaw Lin
Hteik to talk to him about his experiences at
Stanford and his take on politics at home.
The Daily: What's it like being the first

Burmese student here?
Zaw Lin Hteik: First of all, 1 feel kind of
proud, you know, for my friends and my
country. Another thing is 112 feel kind of lonely
because I don't have any Burmese students to
talk to in my language.
TD: What made you want to come to the Unit
ed States?
ZLH: Nowadays most of the students from my
country go abroad after their high school educa
tion, at least to Malaysia, or Singapore, or anoth
er Southeast Asian country for education. Also,
many students go to the States because they be
lieve that it's the best plate tor education. People
in my country, like parents, they are very proud
when their students come to the United States.
People are now more interested in coming
to the United Slates. When I took the SAT,
there were about 40 students who took the test.
I hen, this year, there are more like 150-200
students in the whole country taking the SAT.
II seems like it is becoming more popular.
Three or four years ago there were just two or
three people taking the SAP.
TD: Why do students leave Myanmar for an
education? Does that have to do with your gov
ernment?
ZLH: [The government] is trying to change
policies and improve the education system;
however, in my country we don't have much
technology, even compared to Thailand, our
neighboring country. Technology is very dif
ferent. [Students] are quite sure [they] will get

TD: Do you think the education will improve
in Myanmar? Do you think there will be a time
in the future when people stay?
ZLH: 1 don't think there will be many bigger
changes because we don't have technology.
TD: Tell us a little about the government. It's
a military dictatorship, correct?
ZLH: Yes, but when I lelt my country, two or
three months ago, the political situation was not
very stable; people were kind of expecting a
change. As far as 1 know, there hasn't been a
change yet. People are also quiet; they don't
take any initiative. At the moment, it's kind of
stable, but people are expecting a change. Usu-

politics at all.
TD: What's the economic situa
tion in Burma?
ZLH: Well, c urrently, two months
ago, inllation was very, very high.
TD: Did that make it hard to save,
and hard to have a stable income?
ZLI1: Yes. Prices really were rising
faster than incomes.
TD: So, the people generally
don't support the government,
but no one wants to speak out
against it?
ZLH: The media is somewhat
controlled. It's kind of the nature
of the Burmese people. Even in
history, Burmese people were

very content with their life. They
don't try to change things. 1 hey
will just focus on their life. Even
when our country was a British
colony, il was the same. It's kind
of a Burmese trait; people are
very content with what they have.
They just locus on their own life.
It may be kind of the religion
| Buddhism |, as well.
TD: Do you have access to any
media besides the state-con
trolled press in Myanmar?
ZLH: There are some weekly
newspapers these days; they
seem to be very informative. But
they're not for everyone. They're
a little expensive. Only the mid
dle class can buy them, not the
lower class.
TD: Do you have access to the In
ternet in Myanmar?
ZLH: They are trying to give us
more access. Both the government

and a private company are trying to
give us access, but access is very ex
pensive. We can't get access to some
sites, especially adult sites, gam
bling sites and maybe some political
sites; I'm not sure. Most people still
don't have Internet access.
