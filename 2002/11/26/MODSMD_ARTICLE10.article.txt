# Literary fellowships support new writers

### ALLISON DENCKER 
Looking out from behind her
desk, Eavan Boland, director of
Stanford's Creative Writing Pro
gram and the Stegner fellowship,
faces two bookshelves, which in
themselves cover an entire wall.
These bookshelves are crowded
with brand new books, old fading
books, books like "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest" and books by
award-winning authors such as To
bias Wolff.
"Every book in this bookshelf,"
she announces, "was written by a
former Stegner fellow."
Considering the fact that only 10
Stegner fellowships are given each
year — five in poetry and five in fic
tion — this abundance is quite an
achievement. Somehow, the Stan
ford Creative Writing Program,
which operates through the endow
ment of Stegner fellowships, has be
come a standout among its peers.
The current Stegner fellows in
fiction are Andrew AJtschul, Kaui
Hemmings, Eric Puchner,
Stephanie Reents and Malena Wa
trous. Fellows in poetry this year are
Geoffrey Brock, Robin Ekiss, Moni
ca Ferrel, John Lundberg and
David Roderick.
The most salient feature of the
program is that the two-year fel
lowships neither offer nor require
a degree. The application process
for the fellowship looks to writers
as sources of "living writing in a liv
ing community." The writer's per
sonal connection with his or her
work is paramount in the applica
tion process.
Anyone can be a part of this pro
gram because entrance is based on

passion and drive as opposed to cre
dentials.
"That's what this community
stands for," Boland asserts. All of the
fellows are in the process of writing
their first book, and giving them
time and freedom to develop their
work is extremely important. What
Boland perceives as the most signif
icant consideration in selecting the
fellows is deciding if this is the right
time for them to be in the program.
When some fellows leave the pro
gram, they are selected to be Jones
lecturers at Stanford. Current Jones
lecturer Adam Johnson had his
book "EMPORIUM" reviewed by
The New York Times. Z.Z. Packer,
another Jones lecturer, sold her
story collection to Riverhead for
$250,000. Lan Samantha Chang, a
1993-95 fellow, published her first
book "Hunger" in 1998. Consisting
of a novella and several short stories,
the book has received five-star re
views and was nominated for the Los
Angeles limes Best Book of 1998.
Wallace Stegner, the fiction
writer who began the fellowship in
1946, had a tremendous love for
the American West and strong val
ues on the position and conse
quence of a writer. The fellowship
was established in this spirit and
has truly accomplished Stegner's
aim of establishing Stanford as a lit
erary landmark.
The legacy of the Stegner fellow
ship has not only been to establish
Stanford as a respected literary in
stitution, but also to create a com
munity of truly unique writers. Scott
Turow, a former Mirrielees fellow
and Jones lecturer, said, "I am what
ever I am as a writer because I was at
Stanford then."
