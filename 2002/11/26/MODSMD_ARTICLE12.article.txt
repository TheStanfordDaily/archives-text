Award-winning poet Myung Mi Kim to discuss work
Following a reading of her poetry last night, poet Myung Mi Kim will
participate in a discussion today at 10 a.m. in Bldg. 460-126.
Kim has received numerous honors for her work, including the
Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative North American Poetry and the
Multicultural Publisher's Exchange Award. She has published four
books of poetry including "Commons," "Dura," "The Bounty" and
"Under Flag."
Tim Yu, a graduate student coordinator of the workshop, helped
bring Kim to campus. Yu said that Kim, as a Korean immigrant, ad
dresses some disturbing themes of war and immigration in her work
using innovative techniques.
"She is a very intense and serious reader, in keeping with her mater
ial," Yu said. "She has a clear voice that has a kind of hypnotic effect. It's
very atmospheric."
Kim's visit is part of the Workshop on Contemporary Poetry and
Poetics, which sponsors presentations by Stanford scholars and vis
iting poets and speakers. The workshop is sponsored by the Stan
ford Humanities Center and funded by a grant from the Mellon
Foundation.
Kim is currently a professor of English in the poetics program at the
University of New York at Buffalo.
Funding approved for light source project
Stanford's Linac Coherent Light Source project at SI AC passed the
Department of Energy's Critical Decision 1 process and has been allo
cated $6 million for the start of engineering design activities.
The LCLS project involves numerous institutions including SIAC,
Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Labora
tory and UCLA.. The project proposes to create an X-ray free electron
laser using electron beams from the SLAC linear accelerator and oper
ating in a particular wavelength region.
SIAC researcher and LCLS Project Director John Galayda said that
the light sources were powerful research tools for determining the loca
tions and properties of atoms in molecules, solids and liquids.
"Each generation of synchrotron light sources has had tremendous
impact on the physical and life sciences," he said. "The LCLS will pro
duce flashes of X-rays 10 billion times brighter and 1,000 times shorter
[in duration] than any existing source."
Estimated costs for the completion of the LCLS project are $220 mil
lion, and SIAC] proposes that it will be in full operation by September
2008.
lanto Evans to show slides and discuss work
Applied ecologist and landscape architect lanto Evans will show
slides and discuss his new book tonight at 7 p.m. at Synergy. Evans, who
is a pioneer in earth structures and has building experience on six con
tinents, recently published "The Hand-Sculpted House: A Practical and
Philosophical Guide to Building a Cob Cottage."
According to Evans, "Cob is a structural composite of earth, water,
straw, clay, and sand, handsculpted into buildings while still pliable."
Di ew Harwell, the Stanford Community Farm coordinator, said that
Evans' visit is part of his book signing tour.
"The connection with the Stanford Community Farm is that we have
a coc/earth plaster bench that is being build at the farm," Harwell said.
"It was started as part of the Student Initiated Course in natural build
ing alternatives."
A $3 donation to help cover Evans' travel costs is requested, though
not required to attend the event.
Xanatubes repeat as IM water polo champions
In a heated aquatic battle last Sunday, the Xanatubes defeated peren
nial nemesis Tube or Not Tube II 14-5 to retain their Division II intra
mural inner-tube water polo title.
Though the two teams were both undefeated during the regular sea
son with 3-0 records, last weekend was not their first meeting â€” the two
squads met last year in the championship match, where the Xanatubes
edged out a victory.
"We were really well organized and just had some powerful players
in the field," said mechanical engineering coterminal student Steve
Compton, the Xanatubes coach. "We definitely improved drastically
over the course of the season."
Tube or Not Tube II was playing in both the elite Division II and the
co-ed division, which left them fatigued for their primetime match
against the Xanatubes, though Tube or Not Tube II did paddle to 12-
10 victory over Kappa Alpha in the co-ed finals.
"We had a big turnout for the final game so we were able to keep our
players fresh," said junior Jon Salcedo, the Xanatubes captain.
The Xanatubes squad was comprised primarily of Xanadu eating
associates, many of whom have been several year veterans of the
team or have other athletic experience, including top-scorer Sarah
Umetsu, coterminal students Scott Ogawa, Ken Ashcraft and Dan
Francis and recent alumnus Matt Garr, who returned from the East
Coast for the match.
Compton owed the team's success to its ability to "cherry-pick" near
the goal and its "tight man-to-man defense," and Salcedo said that his
ability to rile his players out of bed early on Sunday morning despite all
odds was a key to the team's dominant season.
In other sports, Potter captured the ultimate frisbee championship,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon beat out Sigma Nu for the touch football title.
