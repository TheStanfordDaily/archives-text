## Blix: Iraq claims no WMDs 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Chief U.N.
weapons inspector Hans Blix said yesterday that
lie warned Iraq ii must provide convincing evi
dence if it maintains — as it did last week — that it
has no illegal weapons programs.
Iraqi officials said they intend to cooperate fully
with U.N. inspectors who will resume work to
morrow after nearly four years, Blix told the U.N.
Security Council.
But on the critical issue of access, Iraqi officials
remarked during talks last week in Baghdad "that
the entry into a presidential site or a ministry was
not exactly the same thing as entry into a factory,"
Blix said, according to his briefing notes.
The resolution allows inspectors to go any
where at anytime, including presidential sites, and
Blix said he stressed this point to the Iraqis and
told them his teams would exercise this right. "We
said we would inspect all sites 011 an equal basis,"
he told a news conference afterwards.
He told reporters later that two months after
U.N. inspectors left Iraq in December 1998, they
produced a document with outstanding questions
about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs.
For example, Iraq provided inspectors with fig
ures about their production of mustard gas, a
nerve agent, but "these figures do not give a full
account."
If they want to be believed they better provide
either the weapons if they remain, or better ac
counts," he said, and this holds true for other
weapons programs as well.
Blix said he would have 100 inspectors on the
ground by Christmas and that logistics were
being rapidly strengthened. He also wants to
open a field of lice in the northern city of Mosul
"without delay."

"Thanks to assistance from the government of
New Zealand we already have communications
people and medics in place and before the end of
the week, we may have the first of eight heli
copters in Baghdad."
Blix told the council that the Iraqis had ex
pressed "some uncertainty," about how it should
prepare a declaration of all nuclear, chemical and
biological programs.
Iraq is mandated to provide the council and in
spectors with the declaration by Dec. 8.
Some of the Iraqi concerns appeared to be
technical, including how detailed the submissions
should be on Iraq's petrochemical industry.
"Clearly, the most important thing was that
whatever there existed by way of weapons pro
grams and proscribed items should be fully de
clared," Blix said he told the Iraqis.
"I added that four years had passed since the
last inspections and that many governments be
lieved that weapons of mass destruction programs
remained in Iraq. The council had wanted to offer
Iraq a last opportunity," he said.
"If the Iraqi side were to state — as it still did at
our meeting — that there were no such programs,
it would need to provide convincing documentary
or other evidence," he told the council.
Under the resolution a false statement or omis
sion in the declaration, coupled with an Iraqi fail
ure to cooperate with inspectors, would constitute
a new "material breach" which would be reported
to the council for possible action.
Asked whether he was being pushed by the
United States to be more aggressive and con
frontational, Blix said, "We may not be the bright
est in the world, but I can tell you we're in no
body's pockets."
