# Ridge chosen as Homeland head
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush on yes
terday named close friend Tom Ridge to head die
new Department of Homeland Security, but said
even the biggest government shake-up in more than
a half century can "neither predict nor prevent every
conceivable attack."
"We're doing everything we can to protect Ameri
ca,'' Bush said as he signed a bill creating the depart
ment. " I n a free and open society, no department of
government can completely guarantee our safety
against ruthless killers who move and plot in shadows."
With that sobering assessment from an East Room
stage, Bush asked the Senate to confirm his nomina
tion of Ridge and named two high-powered deputies:
Navy Secretary Gordon England and Drug Enforce
ment Administration chief Asa Hutchinson.
A large portion of the department will take shape
March 1, when the Secret Service, Immigration and
Naturalization Service and a few other agencies transfer
their employees and budgets to the new entity. The final
pieces will be put in place Sept. 30, 2003 — more than
two years after the attacks that prompted the overhaul.
Ridge, 57, is a Vietnam hero, a former congress
man and longtime political ally of the Bush family
who nearly 14 months ago left his position as Penn
sylvania governor to serve in the White House. No
one else was seriously considered for the job, Bush
aides said.
As the president's homeland security adviser,
Ridge has won praise for improving communication
between Washington and local governments. His
most visible creation — the color-coded national
warning system — became an instant butt of jokes but
has helped Americans understand the ebbs and flows
in terrorism threats, even if they're still unsure what,

if anything, to do about the dangers.
Hush initially opposed creation of a homeland se
curity department. But, facing criticism from Democ -
rats, he embraced the concept in June and used it as
a political issue in the midterm election campaign.
