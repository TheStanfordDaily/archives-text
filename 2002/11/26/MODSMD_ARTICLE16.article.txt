# Three charged in identity theft case

### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Federal
authorities broke up what they
tailed the biggest identity theft
case in U.S. history and charged
three men yesterday with stealing
credit information, draining vic
tims' bank accounts and ruining
their credit.
U.S. Attorney James Comey said
the losses were calculated so far at
$2.7 million but would balloon to
many more millions and affect con
sumers in every state. He said cred
it information for 30,000 people
was stolen and authorities are try
ing to determine how many of
those individuals were victimized.
Authorities said the scheme
began about three years ago when
Philip Cummings, a help-desk

worker at Teledata Communica
tions, a Long Island software com
pany, sold passwords and codes for
downloading consumer credit re
ports to an unidentified person.
Cummings was allegedly paid
roughly $30 for each report, and
the information was then passed on
to at least 20 other people, who set
out to make money from the stolen
information, prosecutors said.
"The potential windfall was
probably far greater than the con
tent of a ban k vault, and t hey didn't
even need a getaway car. All they
needed was a phone and a comput
er, or so they thought," said KB 1 As
sistant Director Kevin P. Donovan.
More than 15,000 credit reports
were stolen from Experian, acred

it history bureau, using passwords
belonging to Ford Motor Credit
Corp., officials said.
They said thousands of other
credit reports were stolen from
companies such as Washington
Mutual Finance Co. in Crossville,
Tenn.; Dollar Bank in Cleveland;
Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center
in Illinois; the Personal Finance
Co. in Frankfort, Ind.; the Medical
Bureau in Clearwater, Fla.; Vin
tage Apartments in Houston; and
Community Bank of Chaska in
Chaska, Minn.
Victims have reported losing
money from their bank accounts,
seeing their credit cards hit with
unauthorized charges, and having
their identities assumed by
strangers.
Comey said one sobbing victim
telephoned prosecutors to say
someone stole her identity,
opened a $35,000 line of credit
and cashed a check for $34,000.
