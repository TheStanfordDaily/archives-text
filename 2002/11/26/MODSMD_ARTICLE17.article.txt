## The 						Stanford Daily Big Game proves that Buddy hasn't been our friend 
### 
Published Since 1891

In the midst of successive disappoint
ments on the football field during this
year's Big Game, Cardinal fans enter
tained Memorial Stadium with the fa
miliar chants and taunts of the Cal fans. How
ever, after spirited cheers of "accepted, reject
ed" and "safety school" fell silent, there was
the prevailingly heard grumble, "This is not a
Tyrone Willingham coached team." The 2002
Cardinal football players experienced the
misfortune of being a highly capable group of
people placed into a bad system of coaching,
one that has resulted in disgraceful losses and
a notable amateurishness in the place where
coaching leadership should be.
We believe the lack of leadership from
head coach Buddy Teevens and his staff,
culminating in their failure to prepare the
Cardinal football team adequately for Big
Game competition, is an embarrassment to
Stanford students, alumni, athletes and all

fans of Cardinal athletics. Big Game was
characterized by nothing different from
previous games played under the Teevens
regime. Play selection was predictable, ex
hibiting little confidence in the offensive
line to protect the ball carrier, or receivers to
shake defenders. Showy gadget plays were
called with alarming frequency, nearly al
ways resulting in the kinds of gaffes unchar
acteristic of last season's Seattle Bowl team.
Fans and players alike grew weary of third
and-long situations, which were often con
cluded as three-and-outs, owing to ineffec
tive draw plays and short passes, which
fooled no one.
Faults in the defensive secondary evident
early in the season remained uncorrected,
and were exploited by Cal receivers
throughout the game. Punts originating
from within Stanford's own 20-yard line
usually resulted in the Bears beginning

drives already in field goal range. Teevens'
coaching mishaps, however, were best
demonstrated by repeated dead ball fouls,
and unseemly personal fouls committed pri
marily by special teams, sometimes resulting
in ugly "half-the distance" penalties. Fa
tigued by a season of such coaching negli
gence, the Cardinal had few resources by
which to defend the Axe from a ravenous
Bears team that had nothing to lose. Vince
Lombardi once said, "If you are lucky
enough to find a guy with a lot of head and
a lot of heart, he's never going to come off
the field second."
Would anyone doubt the Cardinal foot
ball team abounds with the sorts of players
Coach Lombardi coveted? Trey Freeman
and Matt Leonard on the defensive line,
Kirk Chambers and Greg Schindler on the
offensive line, past Big Game heroes like
Casey Moore, playmakers such as Ryan

Wells, Luke Powell, Kerry Carter and Teyo
Johnson, younger players such as Leigh
Torrence and Alex Smith — all are very ca
pable of answering a coach's call to step up.
Instead of motivating and inspiring these
and other Cardinal players to greater levels
of performance, however, Teevens has
squandered a year in the athletic careers of
extremely talented players.
Athletic Director Ted Leland hired
Teevens fully aware of his lackluster creden
tials. While willing to accept that the newly
hired Teevens might not immediately repeat
the success of Willingham's team of the year
before, Stanford students had every right to
expect a season characterized by leadership,
dedication and finesse. Instead, we find our
selves in the dishonorable position of making
excuses for our athletic director's hiring deci
sions, and for the perplexing underperfor
mance of our athletes.
