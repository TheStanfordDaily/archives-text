# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## No more regrets 
### 
I feel stupid. I stayed home from Big
Game to do work. Yet I've spent the
day sleeping, eating and explaining
the story of the Axe to my unenlight
ened friends on the East Coast. Many of
whom go so far as to say, "Well, then, it's not
really an axe, is it? It's just a blade." At which
point I shoot lethal axe-blade-shaped mind
bullets at them over the Internet. I don't feel
stupid about the Axe; I feel stupid about not
being at Big Game.
I have this terrible habit of passing up
an opportunity knowing I'll regret it, and
then regretting it. I'm too tired to go this

party. 1 have too much
work to go to Palo Alto
with these friends. I'm
too socially awkward to
talk to these new people,
too stupid to be friendly
to these people, too lazy
to enter this competition,
too neurotic to join that
club. It's not just missing

these experiences that bothers me, but
that I'll never be able to have them at that
specific time in my life.
I know I'm still a freshman because I'm
still making comparisons between high
school and college. Looking back, maybe
high school sucked because I refused to take
advantage of the opportunities that I was
presented with. So I'm here at Stanford,
with my parents footing the bill for me to
hang out and go to classes, and I 'm trying to
make a conscious effort to make the most of
these four years. It's not easy. It would be so
much easier to find a few friends in and
around my dorm, a few CS geeks, a nice
place to go biking by myself and a quiet
place to do work and never venture past
that narrow horizon.
I'll go home after dead week and reflect
on an incredibly surreal quarter and won
der if I made the right choices. It still doesn't
feel real out here to me. Maybe the shock of
going home will fix that. Some days I wake
up, and I can't believe eight weeks have
passed or that I'm even in college. The shift
from a summer of goofing off to an autumn
of goofing off was so subtle that I never got
a chance to register the change. Going
home for the first time will remind me that
college living is a bizarrely artificial con
struct. I wonder what the adjustment peri
od will be like in January.
During winter break,'l'll talk to my
friends and swap stories. I won't have any
g(K>d, first-hand, drunken party stories or
any crazy fixjtball game stories. I'll end up
worrying that I'll keep procrastinating my
s(x ial life for four years, until I emerge into
the real world and go, "I didn't have
enough fun," like I did on the last clay of

high school.
Hopefully that won't happen. I know
what I want out of Stanford, At least, I think
I do. I want stories to tell. I want to make
sure I have stories to tell my kids about how
crazy their dad was in college. (Isn't it weird
that as an 18-year-old, with no desire to have
kids at the moment, I worry about this
stuff?) Having fun is important too; I don't
want to be driving up Palm Drive in four
years and wonder how I got through college
without having a good time. An education?
Eh, I could get that from books. I came for
classes, but I'm staying for the nightlife.
In an effort to make these dreams a real
ity, I've adopted a new policy. Dave doesn't
happen to the world, the world happens to
Dave. I'm going to sit back and enjoy the
ride. So far, it's working. This policy finds
me doing increasingly stupid and impulsive
things.
I find myself trespassing in the foothills at
dawn, in San Francisco seeing "Rent" when
I know I have two papers to be doing, out on
midnight runs to In-N-Out, discussing the
intricacies of the secret menu and staying up
until all hours of the night for no other rea
son than to talk to my dormmates. It's been
fun, although it leads to a much more solip
sistic existence. The fact that I'm exhausted
to the point of feeling stoned doesn't help
me come to grips with my reality either. At
times my life becomes so strange and the
rapid changes in scenery so jarring that I'm
lead to believe none of this is really happen
ing anywhere but in my head, and that to
morrow I'll wake up in my bed and I'll be a
freshman in high school.
This policy means 1 never sleep (even less
than the last time I bitched about it), and all
my work is being done at the last minute
(even closer than the last time I bitched
about it). I see myself working straight
through Thanksgiving (not going home,
don't feel like dealing with the disorientation
and jetlag of three nights back on the East
Coast), followed by a dead week in which I
don't sleep, followed by a finals week in
which I don't sleep, and then I fly home, eat
well fora week, get my wisdom teeth ex
tracted, and then start all over again. I'm
hoping going home will recharge my batter
ies and give mea work ethic for next quarter.
I still can't believe how fast these weeks
have gone by, and by association, these
columns. It's been fun. See you when I get
back. Viva La College I.ife. Have a good
dead week, good luck on finals and try not
to kill your parents when they impose a cur
few on you over break.

Hopefully that won't happen. I know
what I want out of Stanford, At least, I think
I do. I want stories to tell. I want to make
sure I have stories to tell my kids about how
crazy their dad was in college. (Isn't it weird
that as an 18-year-old, with no desire to have
kids at the moment, I worry about this
stuff?) Having fun is important too; I don't
want to be driving up Palm Drive in four
years and wonder how I got through college
without having a good time. An education?
Eh, I could get that from books. I came for
classes, but I'm staying for the nightlife.
In an effort to make these dreams a real
ity, I've adopted a new policy. Dave doesn't
happen to the world, the world happens to
Dave. I'm going to sit back and enjoy the
ride. So far, it's working. This policy finds
me doing increasingly stupid and impulsive
things.
I find myself trespassing in the foothills at
dawn, in San Francisco seeing "Rent" when
I know I have two papers to be doing, out on
midnight runs to In-N-Out, discussing the
intricacies of the secret menu and staying up
until all hours of the night for no other rea
son than to talk to my dormmates. It's been
fun, although it leads to a much more solip
sistic existence. The fact that I'm exhausted
to the point of feeling stoned doesn't help
me come to grips with my reality either. At
times my life becomes so strange and the
rapid changes in scenery so jarring that I'm
lead to believe none of this is really happen
ing anywhere but in my head, and that to
morrow I'll wake up in my bed and I'll be a
freshman in high school.
This policy means 1 never sleep (even less
than the last time I bitched about it), and all
my work is being done at the last minute
(even closer than the last time I bitched
about it). I see myself working straight
through Thanksgiving (not going home,
don't feel like dealing with the disorientation
and jetlag of three nights back on the East
Coast), followed by a dead week in which I
don't sleep, followed by a finals week in
which I don't sleep, and then I fly home, eat
well fora week, get my wisdom teeth ex
tracted, and then start all over again. I'm
hoping going home will recharge my batter
ies and give mea work ethic for next quarter.
I still can't believe how fast these weeks
have gone by, and by association, these
columns. It's been fun. See you when I get
back. Viva La College I.ife. Have a good
dead week, good luck on finals and try not
to kill your parents when they impose a cur
few on you over break.

I feel stupid. I stayed home from Big
Game to do work. Yet I've spent the
day sleeping, eating and explaining
the story of the Axe to my unenlight
ened friends on the East Coast. Many of
whom go so far as to say, "Well, then, it's not
really an axe, is it? It's just a blade." At which
point I shoot lethal axe-blade-shaped mind
bullets at them over the Internet. I don't feel
stupid about the Axe; I feel stupid about not
being at Big Game.
I have this terrible habit of passing up
an opportunity knowing I'll regret it, and
then regretting it. I'm too tired to go this

party. 1 have too much
work to go to Palo Alto
with these friends. I'm
too socially awkward to
talk to these new people,
too stupid to be friendly
to these people, too lazy
to enter this competition,
too neurotic to join that
club. It's not just missing

these experiences that bothers me, but
that I'll never be able to have them at that
specific time in my life.
I know I'm still a freshman because I'm
still making comparisons between high
school and college. Looking back, maybe
high school sucked because I refused to take
advantage of the opportunities that I was
presented with. So I'm here at Stanford,
with my parents footing the bill for me to
hang out and go to classes, and I 'm trying to
make a conscious effort to make the most of
these four years. It's not easy. It would be so
much easier to find a few friends in and
around my dorm, a few CS geeks, a nice
place to go biking by myself and a quiet
place to do work and never venture past
that narrow horizon.
I'll go home after dead week and reflect
on an incredibly surreal quarter and won
der if I made the right choices. It still doesn't
feel real out here to me. Maybe the shock of
going home will fix that. Some days I wake
up, and I can't believe eight weeks have
passed or that I'm even in college. The shift
from a summer of goofing off to an autumn
of goofing off was so subtle that I never got
a chance to register the change. Going
home for the first time will remind me that
college living is a bizarrely artificial con
struct. I wonder what the adjustment peri
od will be like in January.
During winter break,'l'll talk to my
friends and swap stories. I won't have any
g(K>d, first-hand, drunken party stories or
any crazy fixjtball game stories. I'll end up
worrying that I'll keep procrastinating my
s(x ial life for four years, until I emerge into
the real world and go, "I didn't have
enough fun," like I did on the last clay of

high school.
