'Respect 7 missing from Gaieties
One of the fascinating aspects of watch
ing Gaieties is die creation of a Stanford
image before one's eyes, with "in-jokey" ref
erences to various dorms, classes, student
types and, of course, Stanford's supreme
standard of intelligence over Cal's.
Yet despite the fact that the writers go
out of their way to caricature everyone
and everything, I felt like Daily columnist
Mac Levine felt when watching the Stan
ford Yell Leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12): This doesn't
speak for us as a whole, but only for the
people who produced it.
"This is browner than me!" yells a char
acter holding a rotten pastry offered by the
John Hennessy character. Not many peo
ple laughed, and it was a slightly embar
rassing moment, as were those emphasiz
ing Cal's utter stupidity and Stanford's in
tellectual superiority, which the audience
didn't seem to respond to very enthusiasti
cally. As a minority, I am willing at the risk
that I will be labeled oversensitive for mak
ing a point about awareness and ignorance.
This particular joke baffled me, as it did sev
eral others, not only because it was kept in
the show despite its blatant unfunniness,
but in the context of a more general snob
bery and tastelessness.
The show's funny moments came from
witty writingand acting, not from moments
where it was clear the writers were trying to
see how much political incorrectness they
could get away with. What for? 1 find it dis
turbing that this peevish resentment of"po
litical correctness" has continually been so
integral to the caricatured image of Stan
ford that Gaieites presents. When I talk
about these jokes, I'm not talking about po
litical correctness, but about basic decency
and common sense. Why Gaieties, which is
supposed to give us laughs and get us all

into the spirit of Big Game, has continually
been a platform for this type of resentment
is beyond me, and it annoys me that issues
of respect and decency even have to cross
my mind when I just want to have a good
time and take advantage of a rare opportu
nity to feel some school spirit.

'Affirmative action is needed'
1 would like to say the following in re
sponse to Joe Fairbanks who was quoted in
yesterday's article on affirmative action
("Diversity in action," Nov. 25):
Racial discrimination that was here
when the Constitution was written and con
tinues today has obviously helped less-qual
ified white males take the place of more
qualified applicants, of any other race or
gender, in receiving a college education,
job, voting privileges, home loans and an
assumption of intelligence.
In that way, for more than 400 years,
white males have been in a "fraternity" that
has helped a select few (since there are
fewer white males than the combination of
all minorities and women), but it has been
at the expense of many others and the
bedrock of the 14th Amendment.
Since many of the same people who
lynched black men in the 1960s are now
part of the power establishment of this na
tion (they are only in their 60s today) and
continue to believe in the inherent inferi
ority of people with a little more melanin
in their skin, how does Fairbanks propose
that this problem gets fixed?
If lie can provide a better solution than
affirmative action, we would be glad to
hear it. But that solution cannot be some
pie in the sky belief that all of the sudden,
everyone truly believes that we are all ere

atecl equal, as long as others assume that I
have gotten where I am because of affir
mative action rather than in spite of the
circumstances in our country that make it
necessary affirmative action is needed.

Fairbanks' rhetoric is 'appalling'
I was disgusted when I read The Daily's
article titled "Diversity in Action." Joe Fair
banks, president of the College Republi
cans states that "less-qualified minorities,
usually blacks and Hispanics, take the place
of more qualified applicants, usually whites
and Asians" in regard to affirmative action.
As an African-American.woman, I am ap
palled and sickened that sort of rhetoric is
being promoted by anyone, especially
someone who is representing a new stu
dent group on campus.
To suggest that I, as a black person, and
other black and Latino students at this
university are inherently "less qualified"
than whites or Asians is what makes affir
mative action so hurtful to that group of
people of color.
Because I am at Stanford, people like
Fairbanks assume that 1 must be less quali
fied somehow because of my race. Fair
banks should take a look at the academic
records of the many, equally qualified black
and Latino students at this and other pres
tigious universities before making such an
ignorant judgment. Considering that Stan
ford has risen in college rankings in recent
years — years during which Stanford has
also become much more diverse — this
logic that students of color are underquali
fiecl is disproved by Stanford's growing aca
demic reputation.

ford Yell Leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12): This doesn't
speak for us as a whole, but only for the
people who produced it.
"This is browner than me!" yells a char
acter holding a rotten pastry offered by the
John Hennessy character. Not many peo
ple laughed, and it was a slightly embar
rassing moment, as were those emphasiz
ing Cal's utter stupidity and Stanford's in
tellectual superiority, which the audience
didn't seem to respond to very enthusiasti
cally. As a minority, I am willing at the risk
that I will be labeled oversensitive for mak
ing a point about awareness and ignorance.
This particular joke baffled me, as it did sev
eral others, not only because it was kept in
the show despite its blatant unfunniness,
but in the context of a more general snob
bery and tastelessness.
The show's funny moments came from
witty writingand acting, not from moments
where it was clear the writers were trying to
see how much political incorrectness they
could get away with. What for? 1 find it dis
turbing that this peevish resentment of"po
litical correctness" has continually been so
integral to the caricatured image of Stan
ford that Gaieites presents. When I talk
about these jokes, I'm not talking about po
litical correctness, but about basic decency
and common sense. Why Gaieties, which is
supposed to give us laughs and get us all

into the spirit of Big Game, has continually
been a platform for this type of resentment
is beyond me, and it annoys me that issues
of respect and decency even have to cross
my mind when I just want to have a good
time and take advantage of a rare opportu
nity to feel some school spirit.

'Affirmative action is needed'
1 would like to say the following in re
sponse to Joe Fairbanks who was quoted in
yesterday's article on affirmative action
("Diversity in action," Nov. 25):
Racial discrimination that was here
when the Constitution was written and con
tinues today has obviously helped less-qual
ified white males take the place of more
qualified applicants, of any other race or
gender, in receiving a college education,
job, voting privileges, home loans and an
assumption of intelligence.
In that way, for more than 400 years,
white males have been in a "fraternity" that
has helped a select few (since there are
fewer white males than the combination of
all minorities and women), but it has been
at the expense of many others and the
bedrock of the 14th Amendment.
Since many of the same people who
lynched black men in the 1960s are now
part of the power establishment of this na
tion (they are only in their 60s today) and
continue to believe in the inherent inferi
ority of people with a little more melanin
in their skin, how does Fairbanks propose
that this problem gets fixed?
If lie can provide a better solution than
affirmative action, we would be glad to
hear it. But that solution cannot be some
pie in the sky belief that all of the sudden,
everyone truly believes that we are all ere

atecl equal, as long as others assume that I
have gotten where I am because of affir
mative action rather than in spite of the
circumstances in our country that make it
necessary affirmative action is needed.

Fairbanks' rhetoric is 'appalling'
I was disgusted when I read The Daily's
article titled "Diversity in Action." Joe Fair
banks, president of the College Republi
cans states that "less-qualified minorities,
usually blacks and Hispanics, take the place
of more qualified applicants, usually whites
and Asians" in regard to affirmative action.
As an African-American.woman, I am ap
palled and sickened that sort of rhetoric is
being promoted by anyone, especially
someone who is representing a new stu
dent group on campus.
To suggest that I, as a black person, and
other black and Latino students at this
university are inherently "less qualified"
than whites or Asians is what makes affir
mative action so hurtful to that group of
people of color.
Because I am at Stanford, people like
Fairbanks assume that 1 must be less quali
fied somehow because of my race. Fair
banks should take a look at the academic
records of the many, equally qualified black
and Latino students at this and other pres
tigious universities before making such an
ignorant judgment. Considering that Stan
ford has risen in college rankings in recent
years — years during which Stanford has
also become much more diverse — this
logic that students of color are underquali
fiecl is disproved by Stanford's growing aca
demic reputation.

'Respect 7 missing from Gaieties
One of the fascinating aspects of watch
ing Gaieties is die creation of a Stanford
image before one's eyes, with "in-jokey" ref
erences to various dorms, classes, student
types and, of course, Stanford's supreme
standard of intelligence over Cal's.
Yet despite the fact that the writers go
out of their way to caricature everyone
and everything, I felt like Daily columnist
Mac Levine felt when watching the Stan
ford Yell Leaders ("Yell leaders put Stan
ford to shame," Nov. 12): This doesn't
speak for us as a whole, but only for the
people who produced it.
