# Mock trial supports public speaking skills
## Symposium for high schoolers teaches students about the law 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Over 160 high school students from three
Bay Area counties converged on Stanford's
campus this weekend to take part in the first an
nual Mock Trial High School Symposium.
Sponsored by Stanford Mock Trial and the Pre-
Law Society, the Saturday event consisted of
speeches and workshops hosted by Stanford
faculty and students.
The Constitutional Rights Foundation in
troduced the mock trial program to California
in 1980. It was created to help high school stu
dents acquire a working knowledge of the judi
cial system, develop analytical abilities and com
munication skills, and gain an understanding of
their obligations and responsibilities as mem
bers of society.
Each year, the foundation determines a hy
pothetical case based on a prominent issue fac
ing youth. This year's case was People v. Martin,
the trial of Beck Martin, a high school senior
and honor student charged with the murder of
fellow classmate Anne Marcus.
"As Stanford students, we have resources

that would be helpful to local high school stu
dents," said sophomore Hanna Chiou, the
event's coordinator. "We wanted to reach out
to the community."
The workshops were designed to help par
ticipants with improvisation skills, speaking in a
courtroom setting, and direct and cross exami
nation — skills necessary to master California
content standards for history and social science.
"We [wanted] to show that it is more than
about our own individual competition," said ju
nior Julia Martinez, Mock Trial co-president.
"Our workshops [dealt] with different aspects of
the [statewide] competition."
For the statewide competition, high school
teams — consisting of three attorneys, one pre
trial attorney and four witnesses — prepare the
case and compete against other schools in a
courtroom setting. Volunteer judges and attor
neys hear the case and score each team.
According to Stanford Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg, who addressed the participants at
the event's opening, the event helps partici
pants develop their precision speaking skills,
which are not rigorously stressed in schools
across the country.
"I think it is a very good idea for students to
learn public speaking skills," he said. "[Mock
trial] is a confidence builder [and] is a very stim
ulating kind of exercise."

Speaking from experience, Martinez said
that "mock trial in high school is a perfect tool to
help refine public speaking skills."
Mock Trial co-president Chris Bruner said,
"We're here giving as a team. We want to in
spire them about law."
The event was made possible by the ASSU
and a generous endowment from the Presi
dent's Fund, Bruner added.
"People don't place an emphasis on deci
sion-making skills," co-terminal student Lily
Sarafan said. "I think it's a great opportunity for
the next generation of lawyers ... astute and
analytically thinking students to acquire the
skills needed ahead of time to make decisions
early in life."
The workshop came to an end following
closing remarks by Greg Schmunk, Santa Clara
County chief medical examiner.
"It was so rewarding to know that all the ef
fort we put in paid off, because the kids seemed
to love it," Chiou said. "Many coaches came up
afterwards and thanked us for putting on the
symposium, assuring us that they would defi
nitely come back next year."
"I told the kids, 'Look, they're only a few
years older than you," exclaimed one attor
ney coach. "Don't they speak wonderfully?' "
The Stanford Mock Trial team will take part
in the regional competition this February.
