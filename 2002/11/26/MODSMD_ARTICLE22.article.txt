# Schroeder takes first in British rowing meet
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Nov. 17, Stanford junior Jamie Schroed
er surpassed 178 rowers to claim gold in the
men's open heavyweight division of the British
Indoor Rowing Championship.
As a crowd of reporters and commentators
descended upon him, Schroeder stayed on the
rowing machine.
"I was rushed by reporters and commenta
tors, and 1 just had to ignore them fora little
while," Schroeder said. "If I had stopped mov
ing, all the blood would have been in my legs and
I would have passed out. I had to keep doing the
muscle pump and get blood to my brain."
Once he was able to stop and check the scores
though, Schroeder was happy to find that he
had won.
"It would have really sucked to have trav
elled overseas for as something as silly as an
erg competition and lost," he said. "It's pretty
silly to go overseas to race on a rowing ma
chine, because it's the same everywhere.
That's the whole point. It's a very ridiculous
sport, but it is also a sport that has a lot to do
with rowing."
Schroeder'sjourney to gold began 10 months
ago and thousands of miles away. Last February,
Schroeder won the Crash-B World Indoor
Rowing Championships, dethroning the reign
ing champion David Simon. He won the race,
Schroeder said, because of Simon's absence.
"The prior three years he'd won it," Schroed
er said. "And his times were all faster than mine
the previous three years. I had the slowest victo
rious Crash B [time] ever recorded in its eight
year history or something."
This year when Concept 2, makers of the erg,
decided to sponsor the inaugural U.S. team to
challenge the British, Schroeder and Simon
were the obvious choices for the men's open
heavyweight division. Although he did not com
pete in the last Crash-B, Simon is the current
record holder for U.S. indoor rowing. Con
cept 2 notified the team in September and cov
ered all costs for the 20-member U.S. team to
travel to England.

Schroeder left Stanford at 4:30 a.m. on Nov.
13 and boarded a plane for Boston, where Con
cept 2 outfitted the team members with match
ing navy jackets, polos, tank tops and trou before
sending them to Birmingham, England.
The rowing championship was held that
Sunday in the National Indoor Arena in
Birmingham.
"It's like Madison Square Carden," Schroed
er said. "A huge center arena surrounded by sta
dium seating."
The stadium was about half full, but still had
"thousands and thousands" of spectators, he
said. The crowd was there to watch the best erg
ers from America, Canada, Britain, Italy, Cer
rnany and Eastern Europe compete for the
British indoor title.
On the day of the races, the stadium was di
vided in two, with a warmup area separated
from the competition. On the race side, a hun
dred ergs were arranged in rows of 20. In the
first row, top rowers in each division had their
ergs connected to an overhead screen so spec
tators could read the times. With no room left
for coaches or coxswains, rowers competed on
their own, spurred by the roar of the crowd.
Schroeder arrived several hours early for his
1:40 p.m. race and got rid of any nerves in the
warmup.
"Most of the nervous energy gets out once
you do a few hard strokes," he said. "Lining up,
I was just sitting next to Dave Simon, and I was
ready to go."
Seated on side-by-side ergs in the front row,
Schroeder and Simon took center stage in the
auditorium. Out of the 178 rowers in his divi
sion, Schroeder was focused mainly on his fellow
American.
"My race plan was to go stroke for stroke with
[Simon] for the first thousand, because he is no
torious for going out at a very high cadence,
going at a 35 [strokes per minute rate],"
Schroeder said. "So I thought, 'OK, I'm just
going to follow him. If I follow him, my ratio will
be better.'"
The race started at a high rate, with several
men quickly taking the lead. Schroeder pulled a
1 minute, 15 second split before settling to a race

pace of 1:24.8.
"Dave Simon was much below me, actually,"
said Schroeder, referring to the split times in the
race. "He started off a lot faster than I did. 1 set
tled off pretty fast and hit the plateau within the
first 200 meters."
After 500 meters, Rick Egington of England,
Simon, Schroeder, Tone Endreksson of Estonia
and Italy's Mario Palmisano had pulled away
from the pack.
"For about the first 1,000 meters, I was in sec
ond place," Schroeder said. "Dave Simon was
right ahead of me. After about 1,000 meters, his
rate started to fall off a little bit, off the 35 strokes
per minute. I took that as a sign he was really
getting tired, because he usually goes 35 the
whole way."
Schroeder kept his pace steady, pulling away
as Simon trailed off. But for Schroeder, the
hardest part of the race was still to come.
"With 600 meters to go, I had just pulled the
best 1,500 of my life," he said.
Schroeder, however, was used to ergingjust
1,500 meter pieces during training, so his rate
spiked to 1:29 as the other competitors began
to sprint.
"It wasn't that I wasn't prepared for that last
500 [meters], it's just that I don't train that last
500 all too often," he said. "I was just trying to
finish the piece."
Describing the final push to the finish of the
race, Schroeder was fighting against the erg and
his own body.
"I was losing consciousness," he said, explain
ing why his split went up. "Oxygen debt, lactic
acid build-up, general acidosis of the blood, all
that sort of stuffâ€” very exciting."
In the end, just finishing the piece was
enough for Schroeder to capture first, 0.4 sec
onds ahead of Mario Palmisano from Italy.
Schroeder will now train for the Crash-B
sprints in February. He said he wants to capture
the American erging record.
"The American record isn't that far away. It
was set by Dave Simon in 2000," Schroeder said.
"I'm 1.7 seconds on my split away from the U.S.
record, so that's clearly what I'm aiming for this
season."
