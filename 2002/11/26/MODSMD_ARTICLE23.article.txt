# Plans underway for homeless center in Palo Alto
## 
### RAVI GARG 
With the support of many Stanford faculty,
the Community Working Group has purchased
land in Palo Alto to build a center for homeless
residents that will be located adjacent to the Uni
versity. Organizers hope the center, if formally
approved, will provide Stanford students with a
greater opportunity to volunteer with and learn
more about the local homeless community.
The Opportunity Center will act as a full ser
vice provider for the homeless in Palo Alto, ac
cording to Vice Provost for Campus Relations
LaDoris Cordell, who sits on the CWG's board
of directors. Among the center's services will be
the availability of showers, laundry facilities,
counseling and apartments for singles and
small families with low income.
The CWG was founded by Don Ban , associ
ate professor of sociology, for the purpose of
creating the Opportunity Center. For the past
16 years, the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, locat
ed between the Red Cross building and Palo
Alto train station on Stanford property, could
offer only minimal services with volunteers like
doctors and social workers helping out.
Although the CWG has received a grant
from the Packard Foundation and bought
land, plans for building the Opportunity Cen
ter have not been officially approved, in part
because of resistance from the adjacent Town
and Country Shopping Center and Palo Alto
Medical Foundation.
To date, the ministry's drop-in center for the
homeless has never had a secure location. First
located in a motor home parked outside a Palo
Alto church, it was later moved to a motor
home parked outside the Red Cross center.

In its current location in front of the Red
Cross garage home, "the facilities are utterly in
adequate, and the [ministry] has done an amaz
ing job under extremely adverse conditions,"
said Tom Wasow, professor of linguistics and
philosophy, who acts as charter member of the
CWG.
"The clients get wet in the winter [and] hot
in the summer, the noise is bad from F1
Camino, and the only bathroom is a port-a
potty," said Jim Burklo, campus minister for
United Campus Christian Ministry and former
executive director and founder of the ministry.
"It's been a very tough situation now for 16
years [and is] an undignified way to provide
services and hospitality for the poorest of the
poor in our community," he added.
The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and
Town and Country Shopping Center strongly
opposed the creation of the Opportunity Cen
ter at the City Planning Commission hearing a
week and a half ago.
Burklo, however, called the location ideal
and said he is confident the Opportunity Cen
ter will be approved.
"The city government has already made a
very significant money investment in the pro
ject," he said. "Our developer is the County
Housing Authority, which used, with city per
mission, its power of eminent domain to secure
two extra land parcels for our project, so that we
can have over 90 units of subsidized housing in
addition to our Opportunity Center on the site."
Having begun the planning process with the
city of Palo Alto to get the Opportunity Center
approved, the CWG has begun raising money
to build the center and hopes to begin con
struction next summer.

Stanford students have also been involved
with the creation of the Opportunity Center
and its services.
An engineering class at Stanford helped the
architect for the Opportunity Center with ini
tial design concepts and also compiled much
of the data that established the need for the
project and outlined the services needed,
Burklo said.
Another student activity, the Stanford Pro
ject on Hunger, has donated leftover food
from dorm dining halls to the ministry, which
was used to run a meals program at its first
church location.
"Many Stanford students and faculty have
volunteered in the preparation of food in the
[ministry] meals program," Wasow said.
Burklo himself created an organization
known as Night Outreach that introduced stu
dents to Palo Alto's homeless community.
"Stanford students have been involved a
great deal in volunteering at the existing drop
in center for many years, and we expect that
students will have many more ways to be of ser
vice once the new and much expanded Oppor
tunity Center is opened," Burklo said.
Wasow said he hopes that the Opportunity
Center will attract student volunteers, who
could help with services such as food prepara
tion, cleanup and maintenance of computer fa
cilities. He also would like to see medical and
law students volunteer their expertise to help
clients with health or legal difficulties.
Cordell concluded, "It is anticipated that the
()pportunity Center will be a place where Stan
ford students could be involved in internships
and all [types] of community work related to
housing and homeless issues."

more about the local homeless community.
The Opportunity Center will act as a full ser
vice provider for the homeless in Palo Alto, ac
cording to Vice Provost for Campus Relations
LaDoris Cordell, who sits on the CWG's board
of directors. Among the center's services will be
the availability of showers, laundry facilities,
counseling and apartments for singles and
small families with low income.
The CWG was founded by Don Ban , associ
ate professor of sociology, for the purpose of
creating the Opportunity Center. For the past
16 years, the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto, locat
ed between the Red Cross building and Palo
Alto train station on Stanford property, could
offer only minimal services with volunteers like
doctors and social workers helping out.
Although the CWG has received a grant
from the Packard Foundation and bought
land, plans for building the Opportunity Cen
ter have not been officially approved, in part
because of resistance from the adjacent Town
and Country Shopping Center and Palo Alto
Medical Foundation.
To date, the ministry's drop-in center for the
homeless has never had a secure location. First
located in a motor home parked outside a Palo
Alto church, it was later moved to a motor
home parked outside the Red Cross center.

In its current location in front of the Red
Cross garage home, "the facilities are utterly in
adequate, and the [ministry] has done an amaz
ing job under extremely adverse conditions,"
said Tom Wasow, professor of linguistics and
philosophy, who acts as charter member of the
CWG.
"The clients get wet in the winter [and] hot
in the summer, the noise is bad from F1
Camino, and the only bathroom is a port-a
potty," said Jim Burklo, campus minister for
United Campus Christian Ministry and former
executive director and founder of the ministry.
"It's been a very tough situation now for 16
years [and is] an undignified way to provide
services and hospitality for the poorest of the
poor in our community," he added.
The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and
Town and Country Shopping Center strongly
opposed the creation of the Opportunity Cen
ter at the City Planning Commission hearing a
week and a half ago.
Burklo, however, called the location ideal
and said he is confident the Opportunity Cen
ter will be approved.
"The city government has already made a
very significant money investment in the pro
ject," he said. "Our developer is the County
Housing Authority, which used, with city per
mission, its power of eminent domain to secure
two extra land parcels for our project, so that we
can have over 90 units of subsidized housing in
addition to our Opportunity Center on the site."
Having begun the planning process with the
city of Palo Alto to get the Opportunity Center
approved, the CWG has begun raising money
to build the center and hopes to begin con
struction next summer.

Stanford students have also been involved
with the creation of the Opportunity Center
and its services.
An engineering class at Stanford helped the
architect for the Opportunity Center with ini
tial design concepts and also compiled much
of the data that established the need for the
project and outlined the services needed,
Burklo said.
Another student activity, the Stanford Pro
ject on Hunger, has donated leftover food
from dorm dining halls to the ministry, which
was used to run a meals program at its first
church location.
"Many Stanford students and faculty have
volunteered in the preparation of food in the
[ministry] meals program," Wasow said.
Burklo himself created an organization
known as Night Outreach that introduced stu
dents to Palo Alto's homeless community.
"Stanford students have been involved a
great deal in volunteering at the existing drop
in center for many years, and we expect that
students will have many more ways to be of ser
vice once the new and much expanded Oppor
tunity Center is opened," Burklo said.
Wasow said he hopes that the Opportunity
Center will attract student volunteers, who
could help with services such as food prepara
tion, cleanup and maintenance of computer fa
cilities. He also would like to see medical and
law students volunteer their expertise to help
clients with health or legal difficulties.
Cordell concluded, "It is anticipated that the
()pportunity Center will be a place where Stan
ford students could be involved in internships
and all [types] of community work related to
housing and homeless issues."
