## Volleyball pulls out win over California 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Big Game may have been a
total disaster for the Stanford
football team, but a much bigger
catastrophe nearly played out in
California's Haas Pavilion the
night before in the Stanford
women's volleyball team's Pacific
-10 Conference finale against the
Golden Bears.

Women's Volleyball
Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. California
28-30, 30-20, 30-25, 28-30, 15-11

The No. 4 Cardinal (26-4, 15-3
Pat-10) saw its 20-year, 38-match
winning streak overCal (18-11,7-
1 1) nearly come to an end, as the
Hears took Stanford to five games
in front of 1,215 on Senior Night.
A huge blocking and attacking ef
fort by junior middle blocker Sara
McGee — who was honored yes
terday as the Pac-10 Player of the
Week — and an offensive surge by
sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani in the middle

of the match was just enough to
guide Stanford to a much-needed
3-2 win.
"We didn't start off too
pumped up," said McGee, who
boosted her Pac-10-leading hitting
percentage with an incredible .654
effort off of 18 kills with just one
error. "We picked it up, but they
just stayed with us. It was an excit
ing match."
With the victory, the Cardinal
kept its hopes of hosting one of the
four regionals in the NCAA Tour
nament alive heading into the
final week of the regular season.
And with its impressive effort
against the defending national
champions this late in the year,
Cal may have secured its first
NCAA bid since 1989.
"When you get into a fifth game
with anybody, anything can hap
pen," Cal coach Rich Feller said.
"We're excited we got to five
games and played toe-to-toe with
one of the best teams in the coun
try. We're disappointed we

couldn't finish it."
Cal's ability to hang with the
Cardinal was due largely to the ef
forts of sophomore outside hitter
Mia Jerkov, who was questionable
heading into the match after sit
ting out the Bears' 3-2 win over
No. 13 Santa Clara last Tuesday
with a sprained ankle.
There was nothing questionable
about her performance, though, as
she picked up 34 kills — her sixth
30-plus kill performance of the
year — on an unbelievable 91
swings, a Cal record. She also led
the Bears' staunch digging effort
with a match-high 21 digs, as Cal
outdug Stanford 8(5-69.
Jerkov's tip shots gave Stan
ford's blockers fits all night long,
although the Cardinal net game
was able to contain a number of
Jerkov's regular attacks, forcing
her to hit just .203 in the match.
Stanford finished with 20
blocks in the match, but it was
clearly getting more touches at
the net in the three games it won
than in the first and fourth
games, when Jerkov consistently
tipped and dumped around the
Cardinal blockers.
"We lived and died with our
blocking tonight," said McGee,
who tied junior middle blocker
Jenn Harvey with a match-high
eight blocks each. "Mia from the
back row bounced a couple on us,
so we'll have to work on that. We
need to work on being balanced
and being ready for anything, not
just for regular attacks."
Stanford's attack sputtered
early but steadily improved as the
match proceeded, with junior set
ter Anna Robinson keeping her
sets spread.
Nnamani overcame a slow start
to finish with a team-high 19 kills, as
the Cardinal hit .315 in the match.
The Cardinal did not get as much
output as usual from senior outside
hitter Logan Tom, who was playing
with a badly sprained thumb. Tom,
who injured her right thumb in
Stanford's 3-1 loss to No. 11 Wash
ington State last week, looked ten
tative at times and was clearly both
ered by the injury during the
match, though afterward she said it
only hurt "a little."

"I couldn't swing as hard, but
that was about it," said Tom, who
finished with 14 kills. "I was a lit
tle hesitant."
Stanford recovered from an
early 5-1 deficit in the first game to
lead by as many as three points,
thanks to eight kills by McGee. But
Cal picked up many of its 20 first
game digs late to come back for the
30-28 win.
Nnamani overcame a slow first
game to put up seven kills in the
second game, which the Cardinal
easily took, 30-20. Stanford contin
ued to cruise in game three, as six
team blocks and an early 9-1 run
lifted the Cardinal to a 30-25 win.
Cal outside hitter Jessica Zatica
came off the bench and picked up
three quick kills and a block dur
ing an early 9-1 run in the fourth
game that put the Bears ahead for
good in their 30-28 win.
With its winning streak over the
Bears in danger, Stanford jumped
ahead 8-3 in the fifth game on its
way to putting Cal away with a 15-
11 final-game win.
Stanford improved to 3-2 in
five-game matches this season.
"Winning in five games shows
our fight," Tom said. "It gives us
more confidence if we get into an
other situation like that heading
into the postseason."
With the win, Stanford finished
second in the Pac-10, two games
behind No. 1 Southern California.
After sitting through three of
its opponents' Senior Night festiv
ities over the last three weeks,
Stanford will finally have its own
during its regular-season finale
tonight against Santa Clara (24-
5). Senior outside hitter Ashley
Ivy, fifth-year senior Lindsay Ya
masaki and Tom will be honored
before the 7:00 p.m. match at
Maples Pavilion.
"I don't like playing Senior
Nights at other places. They get
too excited," Tom said.
The Broncos, who wrapped up
a second-place finish in the West
Coast Conference over the week
end, will be looking fora win to
seal up home-court advantage in
the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Becky Potter leads the Santa
Clara attack with 5.30 kills per
game, while the Hirsch twins,
Cindy and Chrissy, lead the Bron
cos' solid digging game, combin
ing for 6.58 digs per game.

Jenn Harvey with a match-high
eight blocks each. "Mia from the
back row bounced a couple on us,
so we'll have to work on that. We
need to work on being balanced
and being ready for anything, not
just for regular attacks."
Stanford's attack sputtered
early but steadily improved as the
match proceeded, with junior set
ter Anna Robinson keeping her
sets spread.
Nnamani overcame a slow start
to finish with a team-high 19 kills, as
the Cardinal hit .315 in the match.
The Cardinal did not get as much
output as usual from senior outside
hitter Logan Tom, who was playing
with a badly sprained thumb. Tom,
who injured her right thumb in
Stanford's 3-1 loss to No. 11 Wash
ington State last week, looked ten
tative at times and was clearly both
ered by the injury during the
match, though afterward she said it
only hurt "a little."

"I couldn't swing as hard, but
that was about it," said Tom, who
finished with 14 kills. "I was a lit
tle hesitant."
Stanford recovered from an
early 5-1 deficit in the first game to
lead by as many as three points,
thanks to eight kills by McGee. But
Cal picked up many of its 20 first
game digs late to come back for the
30-28 win.
Nnamani overcame a slow first
game to put up seven kills in the
second game, which the Cardinal
easily took, 30-20. Stanford contin
ued to cruise in game three, as six
team blocks and an early 9-1 run
lifted the Cardinal to a 30-25 win.
Cal outside hitter Jessica Zatica
came off the bench and picked up
three quick kills and a block dur
ing an early 9-1 run in the fourth
game that put the Bears ahead for
good in their 30-28 win.
With its winning streak over the
Bears in danger, Stanford jumped
ahead 8-3 in the fifth game on its
way to putting Cal away with a 15-
11 final-game win.
Stanford improved to 3-2 in
five-game matches this season.
"Winning in five games shows
our fight," Tom said. "It gives us
more confidence if we get into an
other situation like that heading
into the postseason."
With the win, Stanford finished
second in the Pac-10, two games
behind No. 1 Southern California.
After sitting through three of
its opponents' Senior Night festiv
ities over the last three weeks,
Stanford will finally have its own
during its regular-season finale
tonight against Santa Clara (24-
5). Senior outside hitter Ashley
Ivy, fifth-year senior Lindsay Ya
masaki and Tom will be honored
before the 7:00 p.m. match at
Maples Pavilion.
"I don't like playing Senior
Nights at other places. They get
too excited," Tom said.
The Broncos, who wrapped up
a second-place finish in the West
Coast Conference over the week
end, will be looking fora win to
seal up home-court advantage in
the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Becky Potter leads the Santa
Clara attack with 5.30 kills per

Cindy and Chrissy, lead the Bron
cos' solid digging game, combin

Big Game may have been a
total disaster for the Stanford

Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. California
28-30, 30-20, 30-25, 28-30, 15-11

The No. 4 Cardinal (26-4, 15-3
Pat-10) saw its 20-year, 38-match
winning streak overCal (18-11,7-
1 1) nearly come to an end, as the
Hears took Stanford to five games
in front of 1,215 on Senior Night.
A huge blocking and attacking ef
fort by junior middle blocker Sara
McGee — who was honored yes
terday as the Pac-10 Player of the
Week — and an offensive surge by
sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani in the middle

of the match was just enough to
guide Stanford to a much-needed
3-2 win.
"We didn't start off too
pumped up," said McGee, who
boosted her Pac-10-leading hitting
percentage with an incredible .654
effort off of 18 kills with just one
error. "We picked it up, but they
just stayed with us. It was an excit
ing match."
With the victory, the Cardinal
kept its hopes of hosting one of the
four regionals in the NCAA Tour
nament alive heading into the
final week of the regular season.
And with its impressive effort
against the defending national
champions this late in the year,
Cal may have secured its first
NCAA bid since 1989.
"When you get into a fifth game
with anybody, anything can hap
pen," Cal coach Rich Feller said.
"We're excited we got to five
games and played toe-to-toe with
one of the best teams in the coun
try. We're disappointed we

couldn't finish it."
Cal's ability to hang with the
Cardinal was due largely to the ef
forts of sophomore outside hitter
Mia Jerkov, who was questionable
heading into the match after sit
ting out the Bears' 3-2 win over
No. 13 Santa Clara last Tuesday
with a sprained ankle.
There was nothing questionable
about her performance, though, as
she picked up 34 kills — her sixth
30-plus kill performance of the
year — on an unbelievable 91
swings, a Cal record. She also led
the Bears' staunch digging effort
with a match-high 21 digs, as Cal
outdug Stanford 8(5-69.
Jerkov's tip shots gave Stan
ford's blockers fits all night long,
although the Cardinal net game
was able to contain a number of
Jerkov's regular attacks, forcing
her to hit just .203 in the match.
Stanford finished with 20
blocks in the match, but it was
clearly getting more touches at
the net in the three games it won
than in the first and fourth
games, when Jerkov consistently
tipped and dumped around the
Cardinal blockers.
"We lived and died with our
blocking tonight," said McGee,
who tied junior middle blocker
Jenn Harvey with a match-high
eight blocks each. "Mia from the
back row bounced a couple on us,
so we'll have to work on that. We
