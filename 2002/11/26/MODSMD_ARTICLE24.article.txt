## Volleyball pulls out win over California 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Big Game may have been a
total disaster for the Stanford
football team, but a much bigger
catastrophe nearly played out in
California's Haas Pavilion the
night before in the Stanford
women's volleyball team's Pacific
-10 Conference finale against the
Golden Bears.

Friday: No. 4 Stanford def. California
28-30, 30-20, 30-25, 28-30, 15-11

The No. 4 Cardinal (26-4, 15-3
Pat-10) saw its 20-year, 38-match
winning streak overCal (18-11,7-
1 1) nearly come to an end, as the
Hears took Stanford to five games
in front of 1,215 on Senior Night.
A huge blocking and attacking ef

McGee — who was honored yes
terday as the Pac-10 Player of the
Week — and an offensive surge by
sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani in the middle

of the match was just enough to
guide Stanford to a much-needed
3-2 win.
"We didn't start off too
pumped up," said McGee, who
boosted her Pac-10-leading hitting
percentage with an incredible .654
effort off of 18 kills with just one
error. "We picked it up, but they
just stayed with us. It was an excit

With the victory, the Cardinal
kept its hopes of hosting one of the
four regionals in the NCAA Tour
nament alive heading into the
final week of the regular season.
And with its impressive effort
against the defending national
champions this late in the year,
Cal may have secured its first
NCAA bid since 1989.
"When you get into a fifth game
with anybody, anything can hap
pen," Cal coach Rich Feller said.
"We're excited we got to five
games and played toe-to-toe with
one of the best teams in the coun
try. We're disappointed we
