# Women take second at NCAAs; BYU wins
## 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
Despite the sun, the thermome
ter hovered just above freezing be
fore the start of the NCIAA women's
cross country nationals, held yester
day in Terre Haute, Ind. Two years
ago, the Stanford women's cross
country team was surprised by a 17-
degree temperature at NCAAs and
had trouble dealing with the chill.
This year, the team was prepared

for the cold, and capped an excel
lent season with a hard-fought sec
ond-place finish behind defending
champion Brigham Young.
As is typical for nationals, the race
started fast, with Briana Shook of
Toledo and perennial front-runner
Shalane Flanagan of North Caroli
na taking the early lead. The Sum
ford and BYU teams were packed
near the front of the field.
By the third kilometer, Shook
had been absorbed by the field,
Flanagan pounded away 40 meters
off the front of the field, and it had
become obvious that the team com
petition was now a two-way race be
tween Stanford and BYU, the top
two ranked teams in the country
heading into nationals.
The fast early pace had appar
ently not bothered either team. At
the halfway point, the scoring sys
tem — which used a magnetic strip
on each runner's shoe — had calcu
lated a one-point difference be
tween the teams.

"The time board said we were
going fast, but it felt good," sopho
more Alicia Craig said, "it wouldn't
have been too smart to go chase
[Flanagan] at the front. There's a
team aspect in there."
In recent nationals, Flanagan has
characteristically gone out too hist
and finished far back in the field
after a spectacular implosion. But
this year everything clicked. Craig
and Yale's Kate O'Neil jumped out
of the pack in the final two kilome
ters in an attempt to chase down
Flanagan, but the North Carolina
racer was not fading.
Flanagan's split for the second
half the course was two seconds
faster than the first, and she ran
across the line in a time of 19 min
utes, 36 seconds for the win. She
was followed by O'Neil (2nd,
19:45), Craig (3rd, 19:48) and
Stanford senior Lauren Fleshman
(4th, 19:48), who narrowly out
kicked a BYU opponent.
"I ran down the BYU girl right
at the end, so I can sleep tonight
and not feel guilty," Fleshman
said. "I did everything 1 could,
which I think everyone on the
team can say."
Cardinal senior Malindi Elmore,
in the best cross country race of her
collegiate career, started slightly
slower but moved up to 11 th (20:01)
by the end of the race.
"I ran 25 seconds faster than any
other race this year," Elmore said." I
reached three kilometers and re
membered [Stanford coach J Vin
[Lananna] saying it would be really
hard at this point, but it wasn't, and
I got really excited about moving up
in the next loop."
But as Craig and Elmore were

moving forward, their sophomore
teammate Sara Bei was in trouble,
rapidly losing speed in the final two
kilometers. Bei's slide from the lead
pack to 57th (20:54) erased Skin
ford's hopes of a team victory.
"I could see Alicia and Lauren
right in front of me," Bei said. "I
tried to hang on as long as possible,
but fell off with about 1.5 kilometers
to go. I didn't have much strength
at the end."
After all the racers had crossed
the line, the unofficial results were
announced. Despite Bei's slide,
Stanford was listed as first. Rumors

floating around the crowd centered
on BYU's Breanne Sandberg, who
also had a meltdown late in the race.
If Sandberg and Bei had equally
tailed off, Stanford would still be the
winner.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
there had been a problem with the
feed from the magnetic strips. When
the results were recounted, BYU came
out on top by a score of 85 to 11 3.
"At the moment, I was surprised
[when the unofficial results were an
nounced]," Fleshman said. "I
