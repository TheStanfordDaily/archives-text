# Swimming beats Pacific, falls to No. 1 Auburn
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Invitational this weekend saw
a long Cardinal win streak come to an end and
a couple of records fall, as the Stanford
women's swimming team fell to 3-1 for the sea
son. The No. 4 Cardinal defeated Pacific 201-
12 1 at the Avery Aquatic Center but could not
hold off No. 1 Auburn, which outscored the
Cardinal 202.5-129.5. Auburn also defeated
Pacific 214-106.
It was the Cardinal's first loss in its last 16
dual meets. But though the Cardinal couldn't
hinder the Tigers, Stanford recorded many im
pressive individual performances throughout
the weekend.
Freshman Kristen Caverly proved yet
again to be a valuable asset to the Cardinal in
only her second collegiate meet, capturing

Women's Swimming
Saturday: No. 1 Auburn 202.5, No. 4 Stanford 129.5;
Stanford 201, Pacific 121; Auburn 214, Pacific 106

four individual top-three finishes. Caverly fin
ished second in the 400-yard individual med
ley, less than a second behind Auburn's star se
nior, Maggie Bowen.
On Saturday, Bowen again faced Caverly in
the 200-yard medley, an event in which Bowen
holds the American record. The two swimmers
tied for first place with a time of 1 minute,
59.88 seconds.
Caverly also took first in the 100-yard back
stroke with a time 0f55.90 and third in the 200-
yard backstroke with a time of 1:58.51.
Junior Tara Kirk had a huge weekend,
recording three individual top-three finishes.
She shattered her pool record in the 100-yard
breaststroke with a time of 59.74, and in the

process claimed first place in the race to extend
her unbeaten streak in the event to 19. She fin
ished the race just ahead of Bowen, who was
second to Kirk in the same event at last year's
NCAA Championships, where Kirk set the
American record.
Kirk also captured first place in the 200-yard
breaststroke, recording a time of 2:10.92, and
finished third in the 200-yard freestyle.
Freshman Dana Kirk, Tara's younger sister,
captured her first win of the season when she
recorded a time 0f2:00.43 in the 200-yard but
terfly. The younger Kirk also pulled through
with two third-place finishes in the 100-yard fly
(55.36) and the 200-yard freestyle event
(1:52.56).
"My 200 fly was a real confidence booster,"
Dana Kirk said. "I fell strong the whole way,
and now all I need to do is get
faster and be a little more mentally
prepared."
The Cardinal recorded many
other top-three finishes over the
course of the weekend, including
two tremendous wins for sopho
more Lacev Bout well in the 50-yard
free (23.58) and the 100-yard fly
(55.10). Sophomore Kirsten Gilbert
contributed a third-place finish in
the 200-yard breast as well.
Despite those Cardinal victories,
Auburn dominated both Stanford
and Pacific for most of the meet, es
pecially in the relay events. Stan
ford's relay teams placed six times
in the five relay events.
In the 400-yard medley relay,
the team of Tara Kirk, Dana Kirk,
Caverly and Boutwell easily swept
through the competition with a
time of 3:43.30. Other Cardinal
relay teams placed second in the
200-yard medley relay and the
400-yard freestyle relay, and Stan
ford took second and third in the
200-yard free relay.
The Cardinal also claimed third
place in the 800-yard free relay,
behind two Auburn teams, one of
which smashed the 22-year-old
pool record by about 10 seconds.
In the end, the fact that Auburn
had strong swimmers in every
event allowed the Tigers to rise

above the competition, as it often
clinched more than one top-three
finish in each race.
"I think that the [Stanford]
team needed to step up and score
more of the second and third
place points," Tara Kirk said.
"Auburn really beat us when it
came to depth."
The Stanford swimmers saw the

meet as a chance to measure their
readiness for March's NCAA
Championships, and it was agreed
that there is still a lot of work left to
be done. The regular season will
be spent making what the elder
Kirk calls "significant steps" in
order to top Auburn and the other
tough competition at NCAAs.
Until then, the Cardinal is

grateful for the learning experi
ence that it had in encountering
the country's top team so early in
the year.
"Facing Auburn showed both
good and bad things about our
team," Dana Kirk said. "We need
to work on getting more seconds
and thirds. But it also showed that
we have some amazing talent."

meet as a chance to measure their
readiness for March's NCAA
Championships, and it was agreed
that there is still a lot of work left to
be done. The regular season will
be spent making what the elder
Kirk calls "significant steps" in
order to top Auburn and the other
tough competition at NCAAs.
Until then, the Cardinal is

grateful for the learning experi
ence that it had in encountering
the country's top team so early in
the year.
"Facing Auburn showed both
good and bad things about our
team," Dana Kirk said. "We need
to work on getting more seconds
and thirds. But it also showed that
we have some amazing talent."

The No. 4 Stanford women's swimming team defeated Pacific but fell to No. 1 Auburn at the Stanford Invitational at
the Avery Aquatic Center over the weekend.
The Stanford Invitational this weekend saw
a long Cardinal win streak come to an end and
a couple of records fall, as the Stanford
women's swimming team fell to 3-1 for the sea
son. The No. 4 Cardinal defeated Pacific 201-
12 1 at the Avery Aquatic Center but could not
hold off No. 1 Auburn, which outscored the
Cardinal 202.5-129.5. Auburn also defeated
Pacific 214-106.
It was the Cardinal's first loss in its last 16
dual meets. But though the Cardinal couldn't
hinder the Tigers, Stanford recorded many im
pressive individual performances throughout
the weekend.
Freshman Kristen Caverly proved yet
again to be a valuable asset to the Cardinal in
only her second collegiate meet, capturing

Saturday: No. 1 Auburn 202.5, No. 4 Stanford 129.5;
Stanford 201, Pacific 121; Auburn 214, Pacific 106

four individual top-three finishes. Caverly fin
ished second in the 400-yard individual med
ley, less than a second behind Auburn's star se
nior, Maggie Bowen.
On Saturday, Bowen again faced Caverly in
the 200-yard medley, an event in which Bowen
holds the American record. The two swimmers
tied for first place with a time of 1 minute,
59.88 seconds.
Caverly also took first in the 100-yard back
stroke with a time 0f55.90 and third in the 200-
yard backstroke with a time of 1:58.51.
Junior Tara Kirk had a huge weekend,
recording three individual top-three finishes.
She shattered her pool record in the 100-yard
breaststroke with a time of 59.74, and in the

process claimed first place in the race to extend
her unbeaten streak in the event to 19. She fin
ished the race just ahead of Bowen, who was
second to Kirk in the same event at last year's
NCAA Championships, where Kirk set the
American record.
Kirk also captured first place in the 200-yard
breaststroke, recording a time of 2:10.92, and
finished third in the 200-yard freestyle.
Freshman Dana Kirk, Tara's younger sister,
captured her first win of the season when she
recorded a time 0f2:00.43 in the 200-yard but
terfly. The younger Kirk also pulled through
with two third-place finishes in the 100-yard fly
(55.36) and the 200-yard freestyle event
(1:52.56).
"My 200 fly was a real confidence booster,"
Dana Kirk said. "I fell strong the whole way,
and now all I need to do is get
faster and be a little more mentally
prepared."
The Cardinal recorded many
other top-three finishes over the
course of the weekend, including
two tremendous wins for sopho
more Lacev Bout well in the 50-yard
free (23.58) and the 100-yard fly
(55.10). Sophomore Kirsten Gilbert
contributed a third-place finish in
the 200-yard breast as well.
Despite those Cardinal victories,
Auburn dominated both Stanford
and Pacific for most of the meet, es
pecially in the relay events. Stan
ford's relay teams placed six times
in the five relay events.
In the 400-yard medley relay,
the team of Tara Kirk, Dana Kirk,
Caverly and Boutwell easily swept
through the competition with a
time of 3:43.30. Other Cardinal
relay teams placed second in the
200-yard medley relay and the
400-yard freestyle relay, and Stan
ford took second and third in the
200-yard free relay.
The Cardinal also claimed third
place in the 800-yard free relay,
behind two Auburn teams, one of
which smashed the 22-year-old
pool record by about 10 seconds.
In the end, the fact that Auburn
had strong swimmers in every
event allowed the Tigers to rise

above the competition, as it often
clinched more than one top-three
finish in each race.
"I think that the [Stanford]
team needed to step up and score
more of the second and third
place points," Tara Kirk said.
"Auburn really beat us when it
came to depth."
The Stanford swimmers saw the

meet as a chance to measure their
readiness for March's NCAA
Championships, and it was agreed
that there is still a lot of work left to
be done. The regular season will
