The Stanford Invitational this weekend saw
a long Cardinal win streak come to an end and
a couple of records fall, as the Stanford
women's swimming team fell to 3-1 for the sea
son. The No. 4 Cardinal defeated Pacific 201-
12 1 at the Avery Aquatic Center but could not
hold off No. 1 Auburn, which outscored the
Cardinal 202.5-129.5. Auburn also defeated
Pacific 214-106.
It was the Cardinal's first loss in its last 16
dual meets. But though the Cardinal couldn't
hinder the Tigers, Stanford recorded many im

the weekend.
Freshman Kristen Caverly proved yet

On Saturday, Bowen again faced Caverly in
the 200-yard medley, an event in which Bowen
holds the American record. The two swimmers

59.88 seconds.
Caverly also took first in the 100-yard back
stroke with a time 0f55.90 and third in the 200-

Junior Tara Kirk had a huge weekend,
recording three individual top-three finishes.
She shattered her pool record in the 100-yard
breaststroke with a time of 59.74, and in the

process claimed first place in the race to extend
her unbeaten streak in the event to 19. She fin
ished the race just ahead of Bowen, who was
second to Kirk in the same event at last year's
NCAA Championships, where Kirk set the

Kirk also captured first place in the 200-yard
breaststroke, recording a time of 2:10.92, and
