### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
After starting its weekend off on a sour note at

2, 0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) bounced back the
next day at the California Open, placing eight
wrestlers, topped by a first-place finish by redshirt
sophomore Brad Metzler.

Friday: Cal Sfate-Fullerton 19, Stanford 16

Two days removed from a narrow victory over
San Francisco State, the Cardinal found itself on
the- losing end of a tight match against the Titans on
Friday.
Stanford junior Justin Walker dropped his first
bout of the year, a 3-1 overtime decision, to start the
match at 141 before sophomore Scott Polley im
proved his early-season record to 4-0 and tied the
team score at 3-3 with a 12-8 decision at 149.
Redshirt sophomore Matt Gentry, who made his
season debut with a pin against San Francisco State,
scored a close 3-2 decision at 157 to put Stanford up
6-3.
"We needed to win all the close matches to take
that dual meet," Stanford head coach Steve Buddie
said. "We could've won seven or eight bouts."
Instead, Stanford won five bouts, and Fullerton
also won five, including the next four.

A major decision at 174 by the Titans' Chris Car
lino and a pin by their senior leader Rowdy Lunde
green at 184 proved to be the difference in the
match.
Cardinal redshirt freshman heavyweight Shawn
Ritzenthaler, who earned his first collegiate victory
with the meet-deciding pin on Wednesday night
against the Gators, gave Stanford a glimmer of
hope with an 8-3 decision to cut t he Cardinal deficit
to 19-9.
Redshirt sophomore Nathan Peterson, an
NCAA qualifier last season, secured his first win of
the season with a 7-6 decision. But trailing 19-12
with one bout to go, it was too little too late for the
Cardinal.
With the team's fate sealed, redshirt sophomore
Brad Met/ler improved to 4-0 on the season with a
major decision over the Titans' David Rodriguez at
133 to complete the scoring.
"They were a team that we expected to beat,"
Buddie said. "I knew that I had to be cautious be
cause they'd already beaten Davis this year.
They've got a handful of guys who could very easi
ly go to the NCAA tournament."
On Saturday, Stanford sent 25 wrestlers to the
mat at the California Open, which was also at
Fullerton, and numerous redshirts got their first
taste of collegiate action as the Cardinal looked to
rebound from the previous night's disappointing
loss.
"1 think anytime you don't wrestle up to your ex
pectations in a dual meet, it gets you more inspired
for the next competition," Buddie said. "In this case,
having the next competition be the next day, it was
good to see guys respond."

Stanford junior John Garfinkel avenged a loss to
Fullerton's Risto Martinnen the day before with a
9-4 decision over Martinnen to capture fifth place
ai 165.
Also at 165, Stanford redshirt freshman Bren
nan Corhett, who did not compete in the previous
two meets due to sickness, tallied a 3-2 overtime
decision against Garfinkel on his way to a fourth

place finish.
"For Brennan to recover from that sickness and
come back and place fourth is pretty impressive,"
Buddie said. "[Corbett and Garfinkel] really push
each other."
But Met/ler stole the show for the Cardinal, earning
