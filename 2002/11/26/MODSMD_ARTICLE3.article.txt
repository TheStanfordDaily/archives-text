# Panel addresses G-CEP issues
## Earth Sciences Dean Franklin Orr discusses the University's new energy program and denies conflict of interest 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
To further inform the Stanford community about
the University's newly announced Global Climate and
Energy Project and to allay concerns over the project's
corporate sponsorship, Project Director Franklin On ,
out-going dean of the School of Earth Sciences, held an
informal question-and-answer forum last night.
G-CEP is a $225 million research partnership be
tween Stanford and corporate sponsors, including

ExxonMobil, General Electric and Schlumberger.
The 10-year-long program will address concerns
about climate change and investigate the promise
and practicality of new environmentally friendly
technologies.
"Energy is something most in this country take
for granted," Orr said. "But somewhere between a
third and a quarter of the world population doesn't
have access to energy, and they certainly have aspi
rations to."
Orr stated that experts believe that carbon dioxide
concentration in t he atmosphere has increased approx
imately by a third since the onset of the Industrial Rev
olution and that thepH of the upper ocean has declined
by .1 of a pH point.
"There is no doubt that we humans are interacting
with planetary systems on a global scale," Orr said.
" Therefore, there is a reasonable chance that we will
have to make our way to a set of global energy systems
that have very low greenhouse gas emissions."
He explained that "this project is aimed to survey
across those possibilities to see places we can intervene
with research and have a positive impact."
G-CEP's research inquiries will focus on how ener
gy- supplies can be deployed, distributed and used,
what technologies and systems can be applied effec
tively in developing countries, what barriers to imple
mentation have to be overcome, and how the world
can deal with questions of safety, environmental im
pact, market acceptance and cost.
On emphasized that "we don't want to trade one set
of environmental problems for another."
He continued, "We will define a research agenda
that gets at specific bits of science and technology that
will help us. Research will be performed at Stanford and
at leading research institutions around the world.
"There is no silver bullet — we will have to use all the
tools we can muster because these are big problems,"
Orr said.
According to Orr, about 39 percent of current power
generation is petroleum-based, 23 percent is from nat
ural gas, 23 percent is from coal and 15 percent is pro
duced by nuclear and hydroelectric plants.
Several students at the forum raised the concern that
G-CEP's sole source of funding is its corporate sponsors,
and that this could negatively influence the project's re
search agenda.
"From the very start, the companies said that the

would influence research.
value of someone like Stanford
working on this is that it will be in
dependent," Orr said.
" This is about the technologies,"
he added. "[Stanford has] had a
long experience of working on
problems that have commercial ap
plications. We have figured out
how to work with companies so
that we preserve our indepen
dence ... I don't think this will be a
problem."
One student at the meeting ques
tioned whether providing more en
vironmentally benign energy pro
duction processes would only result
in more people feeling free to use
more energy-intensive devices,
such as SU Vs.
"I think all of us will have some
need to help educate people to try
and make them understand that en
ergy use is something that really
matters to all of us," Orr responded.
Others were alarmed that many
of the project's initial proposed re
search areas are long-term goals
that will focus on exploring new en
ergy sources rather than trying to
obtain immediate efficiency gains.
"Part of our role at universities is
more basic," Orr said. "II it is ready
to go into the market right now,
that is for commercial organiza

tions to do."
Chris Edwards, G-CEP deputy
director, agreed that "efficiency is
going to be very important."
"However, there are two time
scales that we need to think
about," he continued. "What are
we going to start doing now? We
have to be more efficient with
whatever we have now. But as we
start thinking 30, 40 years down
the road, we have to figure out
what to use in the future — where
we want to get in the end is also a
key point of this."
Edwards explained that the
long-term approach of the project is
a factor in why G-CEP will be fund
ed by corporate sponsors rather
than the federal government.
"I love the [Department of En
ergy], but they have a kind of nec
essarily short-term time frame due
to political concerns," Edwards
said. "But this project allows us to
think broadly way out in front."
Orr stated that he was encour
aged by the prospects of G-CEP.
"We now have an opportunity to
work on what surely must be one of
the grand challenges of this centu
ry: applying energy to a growing
world population and reducing
greenhouse emissions substantial
ly," Orr said. "If we can unleash the
creative talents of Stanford students
and faculty and others, we can
make progress, and if we can make
progress, the time to start is now."

progress, the time to start is now."
To further inform the Stanford community about
the University's newly announced Global Climate and
Energy Project and to allay concerns over the project's
corporate sponsorship, Project Director Franklin On ,
out-going dean of the School of Earth Sciences, held an
informal question-and-answer forum last night.
G-CEP is a $225 million research partnership be
tween Stanford and corporate sponsors, including

ExxonMobil, General Electric and Schlumberger.
The 10-year-long program will address concerns
about climate change and investigate the promise
and practicality of new environmentally friendly
technologies.
"Energy is something most in this country take
for granted," Orr said. "But somewhere between a
third and a quarter of the world population doesn't
have access to energy, and they certainly have aspi
rations to."
Orr stated that experts believe that carbon dioxide
concentration in t he atmosphere has increased approx
imately by a third since the onset of the Industrial Rev
olution and that thepH of the upper ocean has declined
by .1 of a pH point.
"There is no doubt that we humans are interacting
with planetary systems on a global scale," Orr said.
" Therefore, there is a reasonable chance that we will
have to make our way to a set of global energy systems
that have very low greenhouse gas emissions."
He explained that "this project is aimed to survey
across those possibilities to see places we can intervene
with research and have a positive impact."
G-CEP's research inquiries will focus on how ener
gy- supplies can be deployed, distributed and used,
what technologies and systems can be applied effec
tively in developing countries, what barriers to imple
mentation have to be overcome, and how the world
can deal with questions of safety, environmental im
pact, market acceptance and cost.
On emphasized that "we don't want to trade one set
of environmental problems for another."
He continued, "We will define a research agenda
that gets at specific bits of science and technology that
will help us. Research will be performed at Stanford and
at leading research institutions around the world.
"There is no silver bullet — we will have to use all the
tools we can muster because these are big problems,"
Orr said.
According to Orr, about 39 percent of current power
generation is petroleum-based, 23 percent is from nat
ural gas, 23 percent is from coal and 15 percent is pro
duced by nuclear and hydroelectric plants.
Several students at the forum raised the concern that
G-CEP's sole source of funding is its corporate sponsors,
and that this could negatively influence the project's re
search agenda.
"From the very start, the companies said that the

would influence research.
value of someone like Stanford
working on this is that it will be in
dependent," Orr said.
" This is about the technologies,"
he added. "[Stanford has] had a
long experience of working on
problems that have commercial ap
plications. We have figured out
how to work with companies so
that we preserve our indepen
dence ... I don't think this will be a
problem."
One student at the meeting ques
tioned whether providing more en
vironmentally benign energy pro
duction processes would only result
in more people feeling free to use
more energy-intensive devices,
such as SU Vs.
"I think all of us will have some
need to help educate people to try
and make them understand that en
ergy use is something that really
matters to all of us," Orr responded.
Others were alarmed that many
of the project's initial proposed re
search areas are long-term goals
that will focus on exploring new en
ergy sources rather than trying to
obtain immediate efficiency gains.
"Part of our role at universities is
more basic," Orr said. "II it is ready
to go into the market right now,
that is for commercial organiza

tions to do."
Chris Edwards, G-CEP deputy
director, agreed that "efficiency is
going to be very important."
"However, there are two time
scales that we need to think
about," he continued. "What are
we going to start doing now? We
have to be more efficient with
whatever we have now. But as we
start thinking 30, 40 years down
the road, we have to figure out
what to use in the future — where
we want to get in the end is also a
key point of this."
Edwards explained that the
long-term approach of the project is
a factor in why G-CEP will be fund
ed by corporate sponsors rather
than the federal government.
"I love the [Department of En
ergy], but they have a kind of nec
essarily short-term time frame due
to political concerns," Edwards
said. "But this project allows us to
think broadly way out in front."
Orr stated that he was encour
aged by the prospects of G-CEP.
"We now have an opportunity to
work on what surely must be one of
the grand challenges of this centu
ry: applying energy to a growing
world population and reducing
greenhouse emissions substantial
ly," Orr said. "If we can unleash the
creative talents of Stanford students
and faculty and others, we can
make progress, and if we can make
progress, the time to start is now."
