# Panel addresses G-CEP issues
## Earth Sciences Dean Franklin Orr discusses the University's new energy program and denies conflict of interest 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
To further inform the Stanford community about
the University's newly announced Global Climate and
Energy Project and to allay concerns over the project's
corporate sponsorship, Project Director Franklin On ,
out-going dean of the School of Earth Sciences, held an
informal question-and-answer forum last night.
G-CEP is a $225 million research partnership be
tween Stanford and corporate sponsors, including

ExxonMobil, General Electric and Schlumberger.
The 10-year-long program will address concerns
about climate change and investigate the promise
and practicality of new environmentally friendly
technologies.
"Energy is something most in this country take
for granted," Orr said. "But somewhere between a
third and a quarter of the world population doesn't
have access to energy, and they certainly have aspi
rations to."
Orr stated that experts believe that carbon dioxide
concentration in t he atmosphere has increased approx
imately by a third since the onset of the Industrial Rev
olution and that thepH of the upper ocean has declined
by .1 of a pH point.
"There is no doubt that we humans are interacting
with planetary systems on a global scale," Orr said.
" Therefore, there is a reasonable chance that we will
have to make our way to a set of global energy systems
that have very low greenhouse gas emissions."
He explained that "this project is aimed to survey
across those possibilities to see places we can intervene
with research and have a positive impact."
G-CEP's research inquiries will focus on how ener
gy- supplies can be deployed, distributed and used,
what technologies and systems can be applied effec
tively in developing countries, what barriers to imple
mentation have to be overcome, and how the world
can deal with questions of safety, environmental im
pact, market acceptance and cost.
On emphasized that "we don't want to trade one set
of environmental problems for another."
He continued, "We will define a research agenda
that gets at specific bits of science and technology that
will help us. Research will be performed at Stanford and
at leading research institutions around the world.
"There is no silver bullet â€” we will have to use all the
tools we can muster because these are big problems,"
Orr said.
According to Orr, about 39 percent of current power
generation is petroleum-based, 23 percent is from nat
ural gas, 23 percent is from coal and 15 percent is pro
duced by nuclear and hydroelectric plants.
Several students at the forum raised the concern that
G-CEP's sole source of funding is its corporate sponsors,
and that this could negatively influence the project's re
search agenda.
"From the very start, the companies said that the

would influence research.
