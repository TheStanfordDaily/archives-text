Sophomore Tony Azevedo had
the game-winning assist to go
along with a game-high four goals,
as the Cardinal (21-3) took a 2-1
edge in the season series with the
Golden Bears.
Cal goalkeeper Russell Bern
stein posted 12 saves in the game,
including several in the finals

minutes of the game, but he
couldn't come up with a save on
Crum's close-range, left-handed
shot with just five ticks left on the
clock. A steal by Stanford junior
Mike Derse as time ran out sealed
the victory.
Stanford took a 5-4 lead into
the half, but Cal evened the con
test at 5-5 with an early third-quar
ter goal.
Senior Peter Hudnut's second
goal of the game was quickly fol
lowed by Azevedo's fourth score to
give the Cardinal the only two-goal
lead of the match. But Cal put two
in the back of the goal early in the
fourth quarter to even things out
before Crum's game-winner.
Senior Nick Ellis finished with
five saves in the contest.
