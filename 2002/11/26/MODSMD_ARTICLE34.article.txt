# Graham drinks The Daily to boat race win
## 
### ALICE BROWN DELIVERY GIRL 
In an imbibition effort of Her
culean proportions, News Editor
Jen Graham slammed down 14
ounces of frothy Keystone Light in
6.35 seconds to lift The Stanford
Daily to an epic boat race win over
The Daily Californian following
Saturday's Ink Bowl at Willard
Park in Berkeley.

Drinking
Saturday: Stanford Daily 1:02.23,
Daily Cal 1:12.37

Breaking the previous Stanford
pre-noon female drinking
record — held by former Editor in
Chief Nadira Hira '02 — by over a
second, Graham spurred The Daily
to a five-second win over the out
classed Cal squad.
Stanford found itself trailing by
almost three seconds heading into
the final leg of the five-person boat
race. But Graham — answering all
those skeptical of The Daily's deci
sion to put a former FroSoCo-er at
the critical anchor spot — busted
out the pounding abilities that
have caused the Tuesday news sec
tion to miss deadline every week
this quarter.
"See, that's what Adams is all
about . . . Bong," said Graham,
stumbling over the keg as she was
swarmed by her teammates. "I said,
'Dude, just pass the cup, 'cause I
gotta make that thing go in, and
yeah, that's what it is.' "
Following a strong opening leg
by senior "staff member" Tim
Kane, The Daily fell woefully be
hind at the No. 2 spot when
sophomore sports editor and foot
ball writer Mark Thoma fell prey
to his SEE roots in 27.65 seconds
of agony.
"That shit tastes awful,"
Thoma said at the 16-second
mark, as he fought the urge to

vomit amid encouragement from
helpful teammates, who were per
plexed by how a fellow staff mem
ber could drink so slowly.
Thoma had narrowly earned
a spot on the roster over 5-foot
2, 75-pound News Editor Antho
ny Ha and Editor in Chief
Sameer Ahmed, who was side
lined with Islam.
The contest looked to be out of
reach when an Irish Daily Cal
news editor, drinking third, de
voured his beer in 0.43 seconds.

But Kane's friend Tom "No one
knows my last name because I
don't actually work for The
Daily" Doe and Managing News
Editor Will "Yeah, I snorted Ri
talin last night" Oremus kept
Stanford afloat heading into the
final stretch.
That's when Graham shamed
the Daily Cal's token female
drinker and claimed glory for the
Stanford paper. Graham's perfor
mance also earned her an auto
matic bid to SAE.

"I really saw something special
in Jen when I hired her," said Ore
mus, who then left for 45 minutes
to call his girlfriend in Ohio.
It was an improbable victory for
The Daily, which was without solid
drinker Mikey Lee, who "swore"
he was going to be there, but
missed out because of previous
obligations to give mono to four
different girls that morning.
Field hockey writer Spencer
Porter was also unavailable after
"getting scored on" by a certain
Cal field hockey player (in over
time), as was Managing Sports Ed
itor Ezra Callahan, who was too
embarrassed to participate. Calla
han heads the only sports depart
ment in the country that is rou
tinely outdrunk by its paper's
news department.
"I'm so embarrassed about the
loss," said a Daily Cal editor who
wished to remain anonymous. "I
guess I haven't been keeping my
staff at the office long enough
every night."
Half of the Daily Cal's editorial
staff quit after the boat race, and
the paper cut its circulation
again, down to 325 copies, which
will be rolled into (loobies and de
livered directly to Berkeley co
ops to save time.
The boat race win lifted The
Daily's spirits after a disheartening
19-8 loss in the actual Ink Bowl,
which saw the return of the hal
lowed Exacto Knife to Berkeley.
Things got off to a rocky start
when Oremus was bowled over by
a scrambling Daily Cal quarter
back on the first series of the game.
But Oremus, riding a big dose of
heart (and Vivarin), recovered to
score Stanford's only touchdown
of the game.
"We had a lot of costly
turnovers," Opinions Editor Arisha
Hatch said from the bench she re
fused to vacate, even after the game.
"I guess God wasn't with us today."

"I'm so embarrassed about the
loss," said a Daily Cal editor who
wished to remain anonymous. "I
guess I haven't been keeping my
staff at the office long enough
every night."
Half of the Daily Cal's editorial
staff quit after the boat race, and
the paper cut its circulation
again, down to 325 copies, which

The boat race win lifted The
Daily's spirits after a disheartening
19-8 loss in the actual Ink Bowl,
which saw the return of the hal
lowed Exacto Knife to Berkeley.
Things got off to a rocky start
when Oremus was bowled over by
a scrambling Daily Cal quarter
back on the first series of the game.
But Oremus, riding a big dose of
heart (and Vivarin), recovered to
score Stanford's only touchdown
of the game.
"We had a lot of costly
turnovers," Opinions Editor Arisha
Hatch said from the bench she re
fused to vacate, even after the game.
"I guess God wasn't with us today."

In an imbibition effort of Her
culean proportions, News Editor
Jen Graham slammed down 14
ounces of frothy Keystone Light in
6.35 seconds to lift The Stanford
Daily to an epic boat race win over
The Daily Californian following
Saturday's Ink Bowl at Willard
Park in Berkeley.

Drinking
Saturday: Stanford Daily 1:02.23,
Daily Cal 1:12.37

Breaking the previous Stanford
pre-noon female drinking
record — held by former Editor in
Chief Nadira Hira '02 — by over a
second, Graham spurred The Daily
to a five-second win over the out
classed Cal squad.
Stanford found itself trailing by
almost three seconds heading into
the final leg of the five-person boat
race. But Graham — answering all
those skeptical of The Daily's deci
sion to put a former FroSoCo-er at
the critical anchor spot — busted
out the pounding abilities that
have caused the Tuesday news sec
tion to miss deadline every week
this quarter.
"See, that's what Adams is all
about . . . Bong," said Graham,
stumbling over the keg as she was
swarmed by her teammates. "I said,
'Dude, just pass the cup, 'cause I
gotta make that thing go in, and
yeah, that's what it is.' "
Following a strong opening leg
by senior "staff member" Tim
Kane, The Daily fell woefully be
hind at the No. 2 spot when
sophomore sports editor and foot
ball writer Mark Thoma fell prey
to his SEE roots in 27.65 seconds
of agony.
"That shit tastes awful,"
Thoma said at the 16-second
mark, as he fought the urge to

vomit amid encouragement from
helpful teammates, who were per
plexed by how a fellow staff mem
ber could drink so slowly.
Thoma had narrowly earned
a spot on the roster over 5-foot
2, 75-pound News Editor Antho
ny Ha and Editor in Chief
Sameer Ahmed, who was side
lined with Islam.
The contest looked to be out of
reach when an Irish Daily Cal
news editor, drinking third, de
voured his beer in 0.43 seconds.

But Kane's friend Tom "No one
knows my last name because I
don't actually work for The
Daily" Doe and Managing News
Editor Will "Yeah, I snorted Ri
talin last night" Oremus kept
Stanford afloat heading into the
final stretch.
That's when Graham shamed
the Daily Cal's token female
drinker and claimed glory for the
Stanford paper. Graham's perfor
mance also earned her an auto
matic bid to SAE.

"I really saw something special
in Jen when I hired her," said Ore
mus, who then left for 45 minutes
to call his girlfriend in Ohio.
It was an improbable victory for
The Daily, which was without solid
drinker Mikey Lee, who "swore"
he was going to be there, but
missed out because of previous
obligations to give mono to four
different girls that morning.
