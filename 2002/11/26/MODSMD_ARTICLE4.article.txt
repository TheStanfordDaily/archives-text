3. Eastern Michigan 165

After four years of near misses
and disappointments, the Cardi
nal claimed the NCAA champi
onship for the first time since
1997. The squad came into the
event this year as the unanimous
No. 1 team in the country, and it
didn't disappoint.
The runners' training and
focus began in June before most
people were done recovering
from the track season. It paid off
yesterday as no team came close
to Stanford's effort.
Their showing was so dominant
that halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the course announcer
proclaimed to the crowd that Stan
ford was "putting on a clinic in
team racing" and "Stanford has
made a mockery of the team race."
"It was all about the team," said
junior Crant Robison, who
claimed third in 29 minutes, 36 sec
onds. "We had four guys together

with one kilometer to go, and we
knew it was time to bring it in."
Fans lined the course on both
sides creating walls of cheering
around the athletes as they
wound around the curvy paths.
The race went out extremely
quickly on the rolling hills of the
course. The leaders passed the

first mile at about 4:30, stringing
out the runners by the end of the
second kilometer.
A front group of four pulled
away by the middle of the third
kilometer, and a chase pack
formed, led by Stanford runners.

The Stanford men's cross country team captured the national title at the
NCAA Championships in Terra Haute, Ind., yesterday. Grant Robison
was the Cardinal's top finisher.
After the 5,000-meter point, the
front pack put even more distance
between itself and the chase
group. Colorado's Jorge Torres
and Arkansas' Alistair Cragg even
tually shook off Eastern Michi
gan's Boaz Cheboiywo, the de
fending champion, and Alabama's
David Kimani and raced each
other to the finish.
In a heated duel over the final
kilometer, Torres edged out
Cragg to claim the individual title
in 29:04. He is the first U.S.-born
runner to do so since 1997, when
Colorado's Adam Goucher won
the championship.
The chase pack quickly swal
lowed the stragglers left in Torres
and Cragg's wake and resumed
the race to the finish. With a kilo

meter to go, four Stanford runners
began to string out the chase pack.
Led by Robison, the Cardinal
placed four runners in the top 10
to completely dominate the team
competition.
Following Robison werejuniors
Louis Luchini (fifth, 29:41), Don
Sage (sixth, 29:44) and lan Dob
son, who kicked hard to a ninth
place finish in 29:47.
"Having the team right there
was awesome," Luchini said.
"Grant was talking to me even dur
ing the finish."
"Our strategy set us up to finish
higher," Robison added. "If I had
gone out with the front pack, 112
probably would have died like the
other guys. We committed to
being together through seven kilo
meters, and we worked together
after that."
Junior Adam Tenforde was
Stanford's fifth runner and final
scorer, claiming 29th in 30:25. He

was followed closely by sophomore
Rvan Hall, who finished 37th in
30:31.
"The coach yelled at me to just
hold my position and stay re
laxed," Tenforde said. "I did not
worry about trying to be heroic
and risking my position."
Freshman Peter Meindl ended
a great first season of collegiate
running with a 99th-place finish in
31:07.
Stanford tallied only 47 points
en route to its victory in Terre
Haute. Wisconsin was a distant
second with 107 points.
"We knew Wisconsin would try
to come on strong late in the race,"
said Vin Lananna, director of cross
country and track and field. "We
had to communicate and work ag
gressively as a team."
Eastern Michigan surprised
everyone with a third-place
showing, helped by Cheboiywo's
eighth-place finish, while the de

fending NCAA champions from
Colorado finished fourth behind
the strength of Torres and his
twin brother, Edwardo, who
claimed 10th.
Stanford's conference rival
Oregon rounded out the top-five
teams behind All-American Jason
Hartmann.
"I think this is a better team
effort than in 1996 [when Stan
ford won the national title],"
Lananna said. "There are 29
guys on the team, and we raced
seven. We could have run
many different combinations,
and I would have been confi
dent in them."
Now, having attained the goal
it set way back before summer
training even began, the Cardi
nal takes a couple weeks easy to
digest what it has finally accom
plished before trying to carry its
success onto the track this winter
and spring.

scorer, claiming 29th in 30:25. He

was followed closely by sophomore
Rvan Hall, who finished 37th in
30:31.
"The coach yelled at me to just
hold my position and stay re
laxed," Tenforde said. "I did not
worry about trying to be heroic
and risking my position."
Freshman Peter Meindl ended
a great first season of collegiate
running with a 99th-place finish in
31:07.
Stanford tallied only 47 points
en route to its victory in Terre
Haute. Wisconsin was a distant
second with 107 points.
"We knew Wisconsin would try
to come on strong late in the race,"
said Vin Lananna, director of cross
country and track and field. "We
had to communicate and work ag
gressively as a team."
Eastern Michigan surprised
everyone with a third-place
showing, helped by Cheboiywo's
eighth-place finish, while the de

fending NCAA champions from
Colorado finished fourth behind
the strength of Torres and his
twin brother, Edwardo, who
claimed 10th.
Stanford's conference rival
Oregon rounded out the top-five
teams behind All-American Jason
Hartmann.
"I think this is a better team
effort than in 1996 [when Stan
ford won the national title],"
Lananna said. "There are 29
guys on the team, and we raced
seven. We could have run
many different combinations,
and I would have been confi
dent in them."
Now, having attained the goal
it set way back before summer
training even began, the Cardi
nal takes a couple weeks easy to
digest what it has finally accom
plished before trying to carry its
success onto the track this winter
and spring.
Veni! Vidi! Vici!
They came. They saw. They
conquered!
Despite the blistering cold
breeze in Terre Haute, Ind.,
there was nothing but lire in the
eyes and hearts of the Stanford
men's cross country team.

After four years of near misses
and disappointments, the Cardi
nal claimed the NCAA champi
onship for the first time since
1997. The squad came into the
event this year as the unanimous
No. 1 team in the country, and it
didn't disappoint.
The runners' training and
focus began in June before most
people were done recovering
from the track season. It paid off
yesterday as no team came close
to Stanford's effort.
Their showing was so dominant
that halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the course announcer
proclaimed to the crowd that Stan
ford was "putting on a clinic in
team racing" and "Stanford has
made a mockery of the team race."
"It was all about the team," said
junior Crant Robison, who
claimed third in 29 minutes, 36 sec
onds. "We had four guys together

with one kilometer to go, and we
knew it was time to bring it in."
Fans lined the course on both
sides creating walls of cheering
around the athletes as they
wound around the curvy paths.
The race went out extremely
quickly on the rolling hills of the
course. The leaders passed the

first mile at about 4:30, stringing
out the runners by the end of the
second kilometer.
A front group of four pulled
away by the middle of the third
kilometer, and a chase pack
formed, led by Stanford runners.

The Stanford men's cross country team captured the national title at the
NCAA Championships in Terra Haute, Ind., yesterday. Grant Robison
was the Cardinal's top finisher.
After the 5,000-meter point, the
front pack put even more distance
between itself and the chase
group. Colorado's Jorge Torres
and Arkansas' Alistair Cragg even
tually shook off Eastern Michi
gan's Boaz Cheboiywo, the de
fending champion, and Alabama's
David Kimani and raced each
other to the finish.
In a heated duel over the final
kilometer, Torres edged out
Cragg to claim the individual title
in 29:04. He is the first U.S.-born
runner to do so since 1997, when
Colorado's Adam Goucher won
the championship.
The chase pack quickly swal
lowed the stragglers left in Torres
and Cragg's wake and resumed
the race to the finish. With a kilo

meter to go, four Stanford runners
began to string out the chase pack.
Led by Robison, the Cardinal
placed four runners in the top 10
to completely dominate the team
competition.
Following Robison werejuniors
Louis Luchini (fifth, 29:41), Don
Sage (sixth, 29:44) and lan Dob
son, who kicked hard to a ninth
place finish in 29:47.
"Having the team right there
was awesome," Luchini said.
"Grant was talking to me even dur
ing the finish."
"Our strategy set us up to finish
higher," Robison added. "If I had
gone out with the front pack, 112
probably would have died like the
other guys. We committed to
being together through seven kilo
meters, and we worked together
after that."
Junior Adam Tenforde was
Stanford's fifth runner and final
scorer, claiming 29th in 30:25. He
