Veni! Vidi! Vici!
They came. They saw. They
conquered!
Despite the blistering cold
breeze in Terre Haute, Ind.,
there was nothing but lire in the
eyes and hearts of the Stanford
men's cross country team.

Men's Cross Country
NCAA Championships at Indiana St.
1. Stanford 47; 2. Wisconsin 107;
3. Eastern Michigan 165

After four years of near misses
and disappointments, the Cardi
nal claimed the NCAA champi
onship for the first time since
1997. The squad came into the
event this year as the unanimous
No. 1 team in the country, and it
didn't disappoint.
The runners' training and
focus began in June before most
people were done recovering
from the track season. It paid off
yesterday as no team came close
to Stanford's effort.
Their showing was so dominant
that halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the course announcer
proclaimed to the crowd that Stan
ford was "putting on a clinic in
team racing" and "Stanford has
made a mockery of the team race."
"It was all about the team," said
junior Crant Robison, who
claimed third in 29 minutes, 36 sec
onds. "We had four guys together

with one kilometer to go, and we
knew it was time to bring it in."
Fans lined the course on both
sides creating walls of cheering
around the athletes as they
wound around the curvy paths.
The race went out extremely
quickly on the rolling hills of the
course. The leaders passed the

first mile at about 4:30, stringing
out the runners by the end of the
second kilometer.
A front group of four pulled
away by the middle of the third
kilometer, and a chase pack
formed, led by Stanford runners.
