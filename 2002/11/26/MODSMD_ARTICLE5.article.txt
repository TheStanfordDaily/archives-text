# New policies monitor international students
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editors Mole: This article is the ninth in a weekly sews
investigating the relationship between the Stanford com
munity and the potential war in Iraq.

In the aftermath of Sept. 11 and in the face of
a possible war with Iraq, the United States gov
ernment has initiated new immigration policies
to more closely monitor non-immigrant aliens
from certain Middle Eastern and North African
countries. Non-immigrant aliens are generally

college students, and over 5,000 are affiliated
with Stanford, according to the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The first of the new policies, the Student and
Exchange Visitor Information System, is a
technological program designed to "increase
efficiency and quality of information collection,
monitoring and knowledge management," ac
cording to the Department of Justice Web site.
It is a database of all current international uni
versity students, and unlike the previous
paper-based system, this electronic method is
able to track students and identify and report

trends or irregularities.
All U.S. universities will be required to report
these data by Jan. 30, 2003, and the University
has already taken the necessary steps toward ap
plying for SEVIS certification.
"Although Stanford is enforcing this policy, I
know that lots of people in [the] University ad
ministration are against it,"a student, who
wished to remain anonymous, said. "However,
the University has to comply with these unfair
and unnecessary regulations of [the Immigration


ANNA-CHRISTINA DOUGLAS/The Stanford Daily
and Naturalization Service] so that
they can continue accepting foreign
students."
"I believe, however, that the Uni
versity should be more vocally
against these policies, and that it has
the potential to offer alternate solu
tions which are more in favor of
[the] academic community while
providing security," the student
added. "Lots of Stanford graduates
are in high decision-making posi
tions of this country, and this gives
the University a unique potential to
make a difference."
SEVIS also prevents students
from using a P.O. box for their list
ed address. Instead, they must use
the address that describes their resi
dence to enable better government
monitoring. They also must main
tain a hill courseload in order to re
tain legal alien status, unless they
have special prior approval for rea
sons such as medical conditions.
'Hie second policy became effec
tive Sept. 11, 2002, and involves
special registration of non-immi
grant aliens from Iraq, Iran, Sudan,
Syria and Libya. Students from
these nations are subject to finger
printing and photographing upon
arrival, and must report to the INS
once a year for checkups.
.Although Stanford has not had
an Iraqi student since the early '90s,
according to the John Pearson, di
rector of the Bechtel International
Center, here are many Iranian stu
dents, as well as occasional citizens
from the other four nations.
"We have contacted all students
at Stanford to which this may apply,
and encouraged them to report to
the INS as soon as possible," Pear
son said.
Sina Zahedi, an Iranian gradu
ate student in electrical engineer
ing, related her experience with this
special registration.
"The process includes an inter
view under oath, fingerprinting
and picture taking," she said. "In
their questions, they ask everything
about when one came here, your
address and contact and your fami
ly contact in the U.S. and emer
gency contact, even the flight num
ber you arrived on, though there
was no problem if you didn't have
any of this info.
"They also asked everything
about my family contacts back
home. Hie officer who interviewed

me was nice and friendly.' 1 Tie other
thing was copying all my docu
ments, including my passport, 1-20,
transcript, bank statement, credit
card bill, salary payment stubs and
all the cards in my wallet, even my
Safeway club card. They finally told
me to come back next year in a win
dow of 10 days. The whole process
took about 4 hours."
The most recent policy, an
nounced on Friday, pertains to all
males born on or before Dec. 2,
1986, who are nationals or citi
zens of Afghanistan, Algeria,
Bahrain, Eritrea, Lebanon, Mo
rocco, North Korea, Oman,
Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, United
Arab Emirates or Yemen. Any
such people who were last admit
ted to the U.S. as non-immigrants
on or before Sept. 30, 2002, and
who will remain in the United
States until at least Jan. 10, 2003,
must specially register with the
INS. This affects all University
students from these countries.
These new policies, while ac
cepted by most international
students, have nonetheless
caused frustration.
Another student who wished to
remain anonymous asked, "Do you
think somebody with terrorist in
tentions will register with INS? And
also, while most of the terrorists of
[the] Sept. 11 attacks were citizens of
Saudi Arabia and Egypt, you can't
find those countries in the list of 5
countries and the extended list of 13
countries which their citizens are re
quired to register upon arrival."
Another anonymous student
noted the policy's inefficiency.
"Most of the information gath
ered by INS are the same informa
tion the State Department gathers
on visa application forms," the stu
dent said. "Why do all different or
ganizations in this country have to
have their own database? More
over, before granting a visa to a citi
zen of these countries, we have to
wait for about 2 months, or maybe
more in some situations, fora back
ground check process.
"In this lengthy process, they
check our names in the databases
of security organizations, includ
ing the FBI, CIA, INS [and] State
Department. While this process
can be done in a few seconds
using an integrated database on a
computer system, it takes more
than two months to be finished in
its current form, and some stu
dents have missed a quarter or
two because their visas were not
ready on time."
