On any given weekday, students pour
into the dining halls, rush to get their SUII)
cards swiped, grab a meal and proceed to
gulp it down before their next class. Many
students don't give a second thought about
the massive operation that organizes the
food preparation and presentation — work
that is all done behind the scenes.
The only time most students stop to
think about the dining halls is when they are
complaining that the meals just aren't as
good as mom's or when they receive the
dreaded University bill.
Incoming students are often surprised at
the cost of meal plans, and few students on
campus understand how the meal plan
costs are calculated. Students watch their
ID's being swiped and may gasp when they
realize they may be paying $7 fora lunch
where they only grabbed a bagel, or may
weigh their salads at an a la carte dining hall
and wonder how in the world lettuce and
vegetables could be worth almost $ 10.

a total of $4,251 this year. Students at Har
vard and Yale can both opt for unlimited
meal plans, which cost $3,919 and $3,950,
respectively.
How is it that Stanford students pay over
$300 more than these universities? The an
swer lies in our location — the Bay Area
currently has the highest cost of living in the
nation. Stanford Dining Services struggles
to maintain a reasonable cost for the meal
plans in this expensive area. If students at
Yale lived in an area with a cost of living as
high as the Bay Area, they would pay $5,703
for 20 meals per week, according to Dining
Services, making the cost of Stanford plans
look a little better in perspective.
Many students, especially upperclass stu

during the week, gripe about having to pur-
