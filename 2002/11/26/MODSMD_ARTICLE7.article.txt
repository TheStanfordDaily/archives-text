# Dining Services says meal plan prices are necessary to...

On any given weekday, students pour
into the dining halls, rush to get their SUII)
cards swiped, grab a meal and proceed to
gulp it down before their next class. Many
students don't give a second thought about
the massive operation that organizes the
food preparation and presentation — work
that is all done behind the scenes.
The only time most students stop to
think about the dining halls is when they are
complaining that the meals just aren't as
good as mom's or when they receive the
dreaded University bill.
Incoming students are often surprised at
the cost of meal plans, and few students on
campus understand how the meal plan
costs are calculated. Students watch their
ID's being swiped and may gasp when they
realize they may be paying $7 fora lunch
where they only grabbed a bagel, or may
weigh their salads at an a la carte dining hall
and wonder how in the world lettuce and
vegetables could be worth almost $ 10.
"It's frustrating when my card is swiped
and I see that I'm paying $9 for dinner
when I think about other meals and things

I could purchase with that money — espe
cially when I'm not too pleased with what
the dining hall has to offer that day," said
sophomore Lian Bloch.
The most expensive and most flexible
meal plan offered at Stanford, the "Pre
mier Cardinal Flex Meal Plan," which cov
ers 390 meals or 328 points, cost students
a total of $4,251 this year. Students at Har
vard and Yale can both opt for unlimited
meal plans, which cost $3,919 and $3,950,
respectively.
How is it that Stanford students pay over
$300 more than these universities? The an
swer lies in our location — the Bay Area
currently has the highest cost of living in the
nation. Stanford Dining Services struggles
to maintain a reasonable cost for the meal
plans in this expensive area. If students at
Yale lived in an area with a cost of living as
high as the Bay Area, they would pay $5,703
for 20 meals per week, according to Dining
Services, making the cost of Stanford plans
look a little better in perspective.
Many students, especially upperclass stu
dents who have cars and often go out to eat
during the week, gripe about having to pur-
chase a minimum of 12 meals a
week plus points, or a LITE a la
carte plan of 977 points per quar
ter.
"I don't like having to buy a
minimum number of points a
quarter because I really feel like I
don't use them," said sophomore
Christine Ghatan. "Because I go
out to eat and I visit people in
other houses and dorms, I always
have extra points. At the end of the
quarter, I'm always purchasing a
huge load of snacks and drinks to
try to use up all of my points."
Nadeem Siddiqui, executive di
rector of Dining Services, explains
why students living in dorm resi
dences are required to purchase a
meal plan.
"The truth is, there is no other
way you can run economically
without requiring a meal plan
based on our student needs and
expectations," he said. "We are a
non-subsidized, not-for-profit
organization and our commit
ment is totally with the students,
but we must keep a balanced fi
nancial sheet and requiring meal
plans is the only way that we can
afford to maintain the quality in
our dining halls that students are
asking for."
The reality is that fora student to
serve themselves a meal as easy as
macaroni and cheese, there are
many people who work behind the
closed doors to provide these meals.
"Many people don't realize
what's happening behind the
scenes — there are people ordering
and preparing food, cleaning dish
es and maintaining the dining hall

that many students simply don't
see," said hit Tadelis, assistant di
rector of finance at I )ining Services.
"And we serve over 11,000
meals a day," Siddiqui added. "It's
a huge organization."
According to Siddiqui, each
Dining Services employee at Stan
ford receives a well-deserved ben
efit package.
"We pay our employees very
well. Benefits are provided to
everyone, including dishwashers,"
he said.
"We're proud to say that we
take care of our employees," Sid
diqui explained. "If you go to a
place like Subway and ask their
employees if they get a retire
ment plan, they would laugh in
your face. Here at Stanford, we
try to keep costs down for stu
dents, but we must take into ac
count that our employees need to
pay the bills in this expensive
area as well."
Currently, Dining Services is
working with the ASSU to evaluate
the meal plans and dining facili
ties. A committee of eight students
is analyzing the entire system,
looking for ways to reduce costs
and food waste.
"We've really tried to help stu
dents with these costs," Tadelis
said. "For the past two years we've
kept board fees stable, even
though everything else — labor,
food costs, maintenance — has
gone up."
What if students are still unhap
py with food costs at Stanford and
find it difficult to pay the bills?
"They should come and work
for us!" Siddiqui enthusiastically
responded. "This program be
longs to them — they can get free
meals every time they work and
discounts on their meal plans."
