# 2002 coterm enrollment increases by 40
## Students cite a tough job market, financial concerns 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faced with the stress of job
searches and uncertainties about
the future, many Stanford seniors
are turning to cotenninal pro
grams, whose collective enrollment
increased by 32.5 percent this year.
Cotenninal students remain at
Stanford — generally fora fifth year
—to complete an undergraduate
degree and a graduate degree si
multaneously. They then enter the
job market with extra qualifications
and often with better base salaries.
Increasingly, students are con
sidering cotenninal programs as a
safeguard against the poor econo
my and subsequent lack of avail
able jobs.
"It's hard to find a job these days
due to the economy, so coterming
just makes sense for many," said

Emily Ma, a senior currently
coterming in mechanical engineer
ing. "Additionally, it's a real blessing,
getting to stay a fifth year at Stanford."
This sentiment seems to be
echoed by many, as enrollment
cotenninal programs have steadily
risen in recent years. The Regis
trar's Office reported that 163coter
minal students enrolled this fall, in
comparison to 123 enrolled in the
fall of2ool.
Cathy Cardoza, director of grad
uate admissions and degree
progress, said she did not believe
that this increase was due to the
economy.
Eric Hultgren, a cotenninal stu
dent working toward his bachelor's
in mechanical engineering and his
master's in aeronautics and astro
nautics, offered an alternate reason:
"The coterm is the fastest, cheapest
and easiest way to earn a master's
degree. For my field, I didn't even
have to take the GRE."
The ease of the cotenninal pro
gram's application process makes it

appealing to students who would
like a graduate degree before start
ing their careers.
" Hie master's makes good finan
cial sense, starting salary in the job
market is higher and the M.S. de
gree usually counts as two years of
experience," Hultgren said. He in
dicated that the economy was in
part responsible for his decision to
coterm, although he also said that
he has wanted to do so since he was
a freshman and planned his acade
mic career accordingly.
Coterming does not require the
foresight that Hultgren had. Ma
said that she did not decide to
coterm until halfway throughjunior
year, and she recommended that
students apply during spring quar
ter of that year.
The deadline for applications to
the cotenninal program is before
the beginning of students' 11th
quarter of undergraduate study or
before they accumulate 180 units,
so many seniors in the past few
weeks have been wrestling with the

idea of coterming.
Applying to the program is sim
ilar to applying to graduate
school. Students must include a
personal statement, two or three
letters of recommendation and a
transcript. Additionally, they must
delineate an academic plan show
ing how they will complete the two
degrees simultaneously.
"You need to be really, really
careful in planning it out," Ma said.
Ma also claimed that admissions
officers lor the program are "quite
receptive" and do not compare ap
plicants to those in the general pool
for graduate admission.
"Regardless of [grade-point av
erage], if you've taken advantage of
opportunities within the depart
ment such as [Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities] grants,
Sophomore College, or [Introduc
tory Seminars], then getting in is
smooth as butter."
A caveat to the coterminal pro
