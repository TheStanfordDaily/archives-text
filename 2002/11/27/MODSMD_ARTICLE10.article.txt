## Israel, U.N. dispute facts on worker's death 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A Unit
ed Nations worker killed in the
Jenin refugee camp during an Is
raeli-Palestinian clash phoned an
Israeli army officer minutes be
fore he was fatally shot and said
Palestinians were trying to break
into the U.N. compound, accord
ing to a tape released by the mili
tary yesterday.
lain I look, British senior
manager for UNRWA, the U.N.
body that helps Palestinian
refugees, was killed by Israeli
gunfire Friday. The circum
stances of his death are an issue
of hot dispute.
Israel says its troops were re
turning lire that came from in
side the U.N. compound. The
officer who received Hook's
phone message said the record
ing supports Israel's assertion
that there were Palestinian gun
men within the compound's 8-
loot-high wall.
The Palestinians and U.N. offi

cials, however, deny that any
armed Palestinians were in the
compound. After the release of the
tape yesterday, UNWRAsaid gun
men had tried to enter but I look
convinced them to leave.
Hook "became aware that
some armed men were attempt
ing to gain entry to the UNRWA
compound in Jenin. He ap
proached them and told them
that they were endangering his
staff and jeopardizing the neu
trality of the U.N. site. The armed
militants then left the area. At no
time did they gain access to the
compound,'' UNWRA said in a
statement out of New York.
Paul McCann, a U.N.
spokesman, called the allegations
that Palestinians were inside the
compound "incredible."
fhe Israeli military says soldiers
returning lire targeted Hook, be
lieving mistakenly that the cell
phone he was holding was a
weapon.

1 11 a voice mail received by Capt.
Peter ferner, the military's liaison
with international groups, a per
son identifying himself as "lain"
says that Palestinian youths "have
knocked a hole in the wall" and
says he is "trying to keep them
out." I he caller uses the Arabic
word "shabab," which means
young men.
ferner provided the tape of the
voice mail message to I he Assoc i

ated Press late yesterday, almost
live clays after 1 look's death.
"This does not prove that we
are innocent," ferner admitted,
but he said it lent credence to the
Israeli assertion that Palestinian
gunmen had entered the com
pound.
ferner's voice mail service auto
matically dated the call at 12:53
p.m. on Friday, less than an hour
before Hook was shot and killed.
