### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq(AP) â€”In-
ternational arms inspectors,
"fully conscious" of their re
sponsibility, are ready to lan
out over Iraq with the latest de
tection gear in search of mobile
labs, underground fac tories or
other signs the Iraqis are still
committed to the deadliest of
weapons, top inspectors said
yesterday.
Ihe U.N. team mounts its
fust field missions today in what
is expected to be months of dif
ficult, detailed inspections of
hundreds of Iraqi sites. Its first
targets will be installations in
spected and "neutralized" in
the 19905.
The future of peace in the
Middle East may hinge on the
outcome of the search. The
United States, steadily reinforc
ing its military in the region, has
warned it will disarm Iraq by

force if the inspections fail.
In Washington, White
House spokesman Ari Fleisch
er said President Bush "hopes
the inspectors will take their
responsibilities very seriously,
and he knows they will, to find
out whether Iraq has indeed
disarmed. And the president
thinks this is a healthy
process."
II Iraq does not cooperate,
Fleischer said, "the president
has said lit' has a policy of zero
tolerance, and Saddam I lussein
will have to figure out exactly
what zero tolerance means."
1 he monitors are back after a
four-year break under a new
mandate from the U.N. Security
Council to test the Baghdad
government's contention that it
has no arsenals of weapons of
mass destruction, or programs
to build them.
