KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — The World Health
Organization confirmed yesterday an outbreak of
lln in rebel-controlled northern Congo, and the
country's health minister said more than 500 people
have died.
Deaths have been recorded in a number of towns
— including Bosobolo, (ibadolite and (Jemena — in
the north of Kcjuateur province, neat the border with
Central African Republic, Health Minister Mashako
Mamba said.
He said as many as 500 people have died since the
outbreak began in October, adding the figures were

"certainly incomplete."
WHO officials in the capital, Kinshasa, could not
say how many people had been infected or killed. A
team was sent to the region last week lo investigate.
The illness was apparently spread by people flee
ing an Oct. 25 coup attempt in Central African Re
public, Mamba said.
"We don't know the number of people-infected,
but we believe it could be double the number of peo
ple who died," said Dr. Mondonge Makuma, a mem
ber of the Kinshasa-based government's national epi
demiological alert system.
