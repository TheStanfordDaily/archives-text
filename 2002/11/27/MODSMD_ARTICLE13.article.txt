## The
						Stanford Daily G-CEP should prioritize research independence 
### 
A week ago today, Stanford University
announced its plans to establish the
$225 million Global Climate and En
ergy Project (G-CEP), funded by
ExxonMobil, General Electric and Schlumberg
er. While any attempt at exploring the issues sur
rounding greenhouse gas emissions and climate
change should certainly Ix: applauded, G-CEP
presents a unique challenge to the University,
given the control of the corporate sponsors over
the research that is conducted.
Prof. Lynn Orr, director of G-CEP, and Uni
versity President John Hennessy have said that
any research conducted by Stanford will remain
independent from the corporations' interests.
But this seems unlikely given the project's cur
rent structure. /Ml funding area proposals for G
CEP must be submitted and approved by a
management committee representing the cor
porate sponsors. The committee can deny fund-

ing from any broad area of research, though it
cannot reject funding fora specific project.
Almost half of the project's funding comes
from ExxonMobil, which has expressed doubt
about the very connection between "human ac
tivities" and climate change. Why, then, is the
company fundingthe project at all? According to
Frank B. Sprow, ExxonMobil's vice president for
safety, health and environment, the investment
in G-CEP is not an admission that climate
change is due to human activities, but is instead
based on the "potential of climate change." But
in a speech on Wednesday, Orr said, "It is clear
that humans are interacting with the geochem
istry of the planet on a global scale." The con
tradiction between the fundamental beliefs of
ExxonMobil and Orr embodies the potential
threat that this corporate-sponsored research
poses to Stanford's academic integrity.
Given the positions regarding climate

change taken by of one of G-CEP's major 112 und
ing corporations, its denial of the science at the
root of the issue and its partial control over the
research that gets funded, the University will
need to do more than verbally reaffirm to the
community that its academic integrity and the
independence of researchers are not at risk. We
offer three suggestions.
Firstly, the title of this project, "Global Cli
mate and Energy Project," is broad and ex
pansive, but the research is narrowly focused.
The project deals with energy-related tech
nologies and not policy initiatives, though both
are integral to progress. Either the project
should include policy analysis and/or make
public statements regarding policy solutions,
or it should change its title so that it doesn't
give undue credit to a company like Exxon-
Mobil for dealing with issues of climate change
when the corporation still doubts the links be-

tween its actions and the problem.
Secondly, a system should be in place to en
sure that the corporate control of the manage
ment committee does not undermine the aca
demic independence of the University. An ad
visory panel of community members will be es
tablished to guide the project. The members of
this advisory panel should have real decision
making power regarding the allocation of
funding, and it should include representatives
from Stanford's student and faculty bodies se
lected through a democratic process.
Thirdly, all those proposed areas for re
search that are not selected to be funded by the
management committee should be made pub
lic, and efforts must be made to find alternate
sources of funding for this research. Without
this safeguard, the research agenda will be de
termined by the corporate sponsors, under
mining Stanford's academic integrity.
