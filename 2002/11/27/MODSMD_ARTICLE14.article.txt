# MEMORY YIELDS
## Winter wonderland 
### 
T| omorrow is Thanksgiving, the
l most American of holidays.
Around the country, people will
settle clown to turkey, gravy,
mashed potatoes and, in some very
strange households, tofu. Those turkeys
that escaped the carnage of the past few
weeks are regrouping to celebrate their
new lease on life, and to remember their
slain brothers. Similar to our leathered
brethren, Stanford students are trying to
regroup from the carnage of this past
weekend, and look forward to better times
during basketball season.
Some of us are making the trek home
to see family; others of us are staying here
to get a head start on Dead Week. All
minds have turned eagerly to that par
adise of rest and relaxation that awaits be
yond the social and intellectual desert that

is final exams: winter
break. Now, facing ilie
Twelve Tasks of Her
cules — including four
final papers, three final
exams, a take-home,
cleaning our rooms and
finding a piece of Stan
ford apparel that we
haven't given to family

members as a gift yet — we are forced to
ponder what our winter breaks will con
sist of. For every other season, Stanford
provides us with somewhere lo go, a
home away from home that has the very
advantage of not having anything to do
with raking leaves, household chores or
helping around the house.
Think about it. Our fall, winter and
spring schedules are filled with (lasses.
After the week of graduation festivities,
students can come'back to attend summer
school or partake of Summer Research
College or other URP activities. ()r, if you
can't stand 11 months of Stanford, then
we'll pay for you to go somewhere else.
Many students take advantage of URO
grants to shack up at some foreign library,
conduct interviews with Kuropean foot
ball officials or go write whale poems for
10 weeks. The Haas Center hands out
hundreds of thousands of dollars to pub
lic-service-minded folk to go work at pit
tance-paying jobs around the world. Also
impressive are the numerous opportuni
ties offered by University departments
such as archaeology or anthropology that
allow students to dig in Peru or discuss the
fishing habits of indigenous Kiwis.
Once summer has officially ended, it's
great to go home fora bit — but only a bit.
We all know how much it sucks to have
your friends depart one-by-one for their
state schools, leaving you to sit around
with the family clog. Administrators have
just recently begun to address this tenuous
summer-fall period. If you're a sopho
more, attendance at Sophomore College
is a great opportunity to drop the parents
and head back to the Farm to indulge in
interim housing and boozing with the

profs. Juniors are now encouraged to ex
tent! their time abroad with an Overseas
Seminar. And, although our enduring be
lief in "meritocracy" keeps us from sinking
to Harvard's honors standards, the num
ber of seniors attending Honors College
increases every year. Also, let's not forget
the non-academic opportunities to fill the
awkward September space, such as RA or
11 PAG training. As for spring break, even
though you have the option to stay in the
dorms and bask in NCAA Tournament
bliss, you can also spend it advancing the
extreme-liberal agenda with Alternative
Spring Break.
During winter break though, we are
relegated to our couches, catching up on
movies and hoping Duke loses so Stanford
can move up in the national rankings.
A number of options exist for the URP
to serve the Stanford community during
the three weeks in which Stanford stu
dents resemble wilting vegetation. First,
we could have a cross-cultural California
Appreciation Week. The University could
send all Stanford students from California
to the Northeast during the first week of
break so that those of us from that area
wouldn't have to listen to the incessant
whining about how cold it is when the tem
perature drops below 50. Students could
also attend ;i mugging in Central Park to
demonstrate what it is like to live in a place
that actually is unsafe at night, and would
truly merit programs such as 5-SURE.
()t, since the UR() already gives money
to undergraduates to study in libraries all
over the world, it could subsidize the Stan
ford libraries to keep them open during
this winter break. In a decision that closely
resembles the actions of countless corpora
tions during this economic downturn,
Provost John Etchemendy has chosen to
effectively close the entire University dur
ing the latter part of winter break in order
to save costs. Certainly, cuts must be made
somewhere, and the University is used less
during these three weeks, but libraries em
body the core mission of the University.
For those faculty members and graduate
students who make the Stanford area their
home, access to libraries is vital, especially if
I hey are already dosed out of their offices.
With the students at home, winter break is
the only time for them to get serious aca
demic research done and to prepare next
quarter's syllabi.
However, considering the budget
(Hindi, we are unlikely to see any winter
quarter programming soon. Perhaps the
best alternative is URO-funded Block
buster cards and trips to the local library.
Although their overall resources are less
exhaustive than Stanford's, their young
adult sec tions put (ireen 1 ibrary to shame.

Al/'x (ireninger is double majoring in biological
sciences and international relations, Urn Meyer i.s
history colcnninal student. Their favorite parts of
the turkey are the drumsticks. E-mail them at ger
