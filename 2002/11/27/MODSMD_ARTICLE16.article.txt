Journalist Fisk is a 'propagandist 7
In "Fisk decries U.S. media bias in the
Mideast" (Nov. 22), Paul George, execu
tive director of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center, is quoted bemoaning "a
constant barrage of'misinformation, disin
formation, media bias, blather and plain
sloppy journalism." I could probably sym
pathize with him a little if he hadn't of
fered up, as an alternative, the self-impor
tant bloviating of Robert Fisk, a journalist
(to use the term loosely) who performs
every one of these disservices.
Fisk supporters inevitably introduce
him as someone who dares to expose
media distortions. But the only thing Fisk
exposes, with a generous serving of hy
perbole, is his opinion. He disparages
Western journalists — particularly those
112 rom the United States — for what he per
ceives as their biased reporting on conflicts
in the Middle East, while trumpeting his
own reporting as unadulterated truth. In
fact, it's the other way around.
In any case, when Fisk maligns "West
ern media" for skewing coverage of the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict in favor of Israel, I
always wonder who, exactly, lie's referring
to. I he New York Times? A Nov. 15 dis
patch from the Gaza Strip (a news feature
by The Times' Joe! Greenberg) opens with
t his sentence: "Posters of children killed by
Israeli Army gunfire covered the walls of
the alleys among the bullet-scarred build
ing of this refugee camp today, ;i reminder
that two 2-year-olds were shot dead there
in three days this week."
American editorial pages? The Los
Angeles limes ran a Nov. 20 editorial ti
tled "Sharon's West Bank Folly" that
blasts the Israeli settlements as "an ob
stacle to peace." (In fact, I have yet to

read anything sympathetic to Israel's
settlement policy in mainstream Ameri
can press.)
What you find in America's flagship
newspapers — such as The New York
Times, The Los Angeles Times and The
Washington Post — is reporting in the
time-honored, American tradition of en
gaging several perspectives and treating
complex, morally gray issues with eager,
but dispassionate, curiosity. Perhaps
Fisk enjoys being a propagandist. Cer
tainly, he is able to attract a lot of atten
tion to himself this way; it's not an origi
nal observation to note that Fisk's fa
vorite topic is Fisk. For an exemplary
taste of his restrained and self-effacing
reportage, check out his Dec. 10 article
in The Independent — "My beating by
refugees is a symbol of the hatred and
fury of this filthy war" — in which he ap
parently aims to cast himself as a Christ
figure as lie's getting his butt kicked by
Afghans: "And even then, I understood.
I couldn't blame them for what they
were doing. In fact, if I were the Afghan
refugees of kila Abdullah, close to the
Afghan-Pakistan border, I would have
clone just the same to Robert Fisk."
Or maybe he really is a moral idiot.
"Sept. 1 1 did not change (he world," The
Daily quotes him as saying. Please.

Football coach Teevens is responsible for
team's lack of discipline
Thank you lor yesterday's editorial crit
icizing Stanford head football coach
lluddy Teevens and, appropriately, plac
ing a good ( hunk of the responsibility lor

the football team's performance squarely
on his head. You made me feel like I
wasn't on an island.
You correctly imply that what bothers
most who feel similarly is not the 2-9 record
in and of itself. Rather, it is the way in which
the games were lost. I'd like to be a bit more
explicit. I umovers, miscnesand penalties,
including more personal fouls than I can
ever remember Stanford committing —
these are the reasons not only that the loot
ball team lost, but that they were an em
barrassment to the University.
I have attended Stanford football
games for nearly 20 years. Until this sea
son I never saw a team quit in the mid
dle of games like I saw more than once
this year.
All of this points to a lack of discipline.
Discipline starts from the top, and it is a
core fundamental of any successful ath
letic program. Stanford was lucky to have
Tyrone Willingham for seven years. I le is
clearly one of the best coaches in college
football, and someone who started with
discipline. Hut seriously, given Teevens'
recent tenure at Florida under Steve
Spurrier, does it surprise anyone that dis
cipline would not be at the top of his list
of priorities?
Athletic: Director Ted Leland needs to
realize he made a mistake in hiring
I'eevens, and he needs to fix it now. If Le
land fails to take the appropriate course of
ac tion, he will face a repeat of this year's
performance, even more disgruntled stu
dent and alumni bodies and even more
empty seats next season.

'Bad years can happen
in any sport'
I was shocked to scan the Nov.
2(i Daily and find the editorial
board harshly criticized Buddy
Teevens ("Big Game proves that
Buddy hasn't been our friend").
It detracts from all the serious
editorials written about impor
tant issues of national and Uni
versity policy for the editorial
board to express so strongly an
opinion about the performance

of the school's football coach.
This is not Notre Dame — Stan
ford is not a one-dimensional
football school.
The board might be justified in
expressing an opinion on the
members of the school's coaching
staff if someone had made a racist
remark or had violated University
policies, but all Teevens did was
contribute to the team having a
bad year.
Perhaps the board has been
spoiled by seven straight Big
Game victories, but it needs to re
alize that bad years can happen in
any sport. You win some, and you
lose some. Perhaps Teevens' team
did not perform up to its expecta

tions, but such a statement should
be left to opinions writers. 1 'he ed
itorial board ought to stay above
such matters.

Researchers should set
G-CEP priorities
It's for no small reason envi
ronmentalists should be worried
about the gigantic $225 million
grant from ExxonMobil, General
Electric and Schlumberger, the oil
field services colossus. Obviously
the energy giants want to corner

the market — and what better
way than to influence the research
— be the first to know about fii
ture technologies and be the ones
to direct where the market will be
going in the future through plan
ning, lobbying and massive adver
tising? Obviously the energy com
panies are trying to look good in
the eyes of the everyday car driver
so said consumer can feel comfort
able driving into the sunset of the
deep, deep future.
These are important reasons en
vironmentalists should be con
cerned. But the biggest reason to be
concerned is that the energy com
panies are setting the agenda —
and the scientists are tagging along
like the family dog. What agenda?
The one that says we have to go on
consuming massive quantities of
energy into the indefinite future,
that our dependence upon our en
ergy pushers has to be maintained
or grow, that we will unquestion
ably continue developing the
largest things human beings build
— our cities and towns — in the
disastrous way of sprawl and auto
mobile dependence.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's the wrong agenda. We can
reshape our cities and towns to
wean ourselves from thiscrushing
ly large addiction humanity has
built itself into. It is currently the
chief cause of habitat destruction,
climate change and extinction of
species and the bottom line of wars
in the oil regions of the world —
places like Nigeria and Peru as well
as the Middle East. We don't have
to build cities for cars and massive

energy use; we can build them for
people, with very modest energy
use of the most renewable kind.
We don't even need much re
search in that regard; we could
conserve a lot with urban redesign.
Hie modestly more expensive re
newables would be cheap in the
small quantity required.
I agree with Paul Ehrlich, who
said Stanford scientists would
never do bad science just because
they are paid by ExxonMobil and
company. Bui that's hardly the
real issue. Letting those compa
nies set the agenda — that's (he
problem. Someone concerned
with the common good should
support scientists in investigating
the city and associated technolo
gies built for people, not cars. And
if the scientists can't figure that
one out, support those of us who
have. The oil companies never
will, but all sorts of concerned peo
ple and institutions can and
should support those of us who
are working on sane and ecologi
cally healthy cities.

Credit union should not endow
professorial chair
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union has launched a glit/.y, ag
gressive drive to have members
ratify a surprising action of the
board authorizing the spending
of a lull $1.5 million to endow a
professorial chair in the name of

the credit union. I encourage all
credit union members to vote
against this action. The SFCU was
founded "to serve the financial
needs of the students, faculty and
stalf of Stanford University." Does
spending more than a million dol
lars of our member-owned SFCU
funds help serve this mission? It
does not.
Endowing professorial chairs
is a meaningful endeavor, but it
is one that is best left to founda
tions and those others whose
missions and interests are
aligned with such activity. A
modest-sized credit union en
gaging in such activity, in this
case in partnership with a foun
dation, appears to be an attempt
to purchase a bit of big-time
glory. When you receive your
ballot, vote "no," and let our
money continue to work toward
supporting the Stanford com
munity in the way in which it has
been intended.
