Journalist Fisk is a 'propagandist 7
In "Fisk decries U.S. media bias in the
Mideast" (Nov. 22), Paul George, execu
tive director of the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center, is quoted bemoaning "a
constant barrage of'misinformation, disin
formation, media bias, blather and plain
sloppy journalism." I could probably sym
pathize with him a little if he hadn't of
fered up, as an alternative, the self-impor
tant bloviating of Robert Fisk, a journalist
(to use the term loosely) who performs
every one of these disservices.
Fisk supporters inevitably introduce
him as someone who dares to expose
media distortions. But the only thing Fisk
exposes, with a generous serving of hy
perbole, is his opinion. He disparages
Western journalists — particularly those
112 rom the United States — for what he per
ceives as their biased reporting on conflicts
in the Middle East, while trumpeting his
own reporting as unadulterated truth. In
fact, it's the other way around.
In any case, when Fisk maligns "West
ern media" for skewing coverage of the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict in favor of Israel, I
always wonder who, exactly, lie's referring
to. I he New York Times? A Nov. 15 dis
patch from the Gaza Strip (a news feature
by The Times' Joe! Greenberg) opens with
t his sentence: "Posters of children killed by
Israeli Army gunfire covered the walls of
the alleys among the bullet-scarred build
ing of this refugee camp today, ;i reminder
that two 2-year-olds were shot dead there
in three days this week."
American editorial pages? The Los
Angeles limes ran a Nov. 20 editorial ti
tled "Sharon's West Bank Folly" that
blasts the Israeli settlements as "an ob
stacle to peace." (In fact, I have yet to

read anything sympathetic to Israel's
settlement policy in mainstream Ameri
can press.)
What you find in America's flagship
newspapers — such as The New York
Times, The Los Angeles Times and The
Washington Post — is reporting in the
time-honored, American tradition of en
gaging several perspectives and treating
complex, morally gray issues with eager,
but dispassionate, curiosity. Perhaps
Fisk enjoys being a propagandist. Cer
tainly, he is able to attract a lot of atten
tion to himself this way; it's not an origi
nal observation to note that Fisk's fa
vorite topic is Fisk. For an exemplary
taste of his restrained and self-effacing
reportage, check out his Dec. 10 article
in The Independent — "My beating by
refugees is a symbol of the hatred and
fury of this filthy war" — in which he ap
parently aims to cast himself as a Christ
figure as lie's getting his butt kicked by
Afghans: "And even then, I understood.
I couldn't blame them for what they
were doing. In fact, if I were the Afghan
refugees of kila Abdullah, close to the
Afghan-Pakistan border, I would have
clone just the same to Robert Fisk."
Or maybe he really is a moral idiot.
"Sept. 1 1 did not change (he world," The
Daily quotes him as saying. Please.

Football coach Teevens is responsible for
team's lack of discipline
Thank you lor yesterday's editorial crit
icizing Stanford head football coach
lluddy Teevens and, appropriately, plac
ing a good ( hunk of the responsibility lor

the football team's performance squarely
on his head. You made me feel like I
wasn't on an island.
You correctly imply that what bothers
most who feel similarly is not the 2-9 record
in and of itself. Rather, it is the way in which
the games were lost. I'd like to be a bit more
explicit. I umovers, miscnesand penalties,
including more personal fouls than I can
ever remember Stanford committing —
these are the reasons not only that the loot
ball team lost, but that they were an em
barrassment to the University.
I have attended Stanford football
games for nearly 20 years. Until this sea
son I never saw a team quit in the mid
dle of games like I saw more than once
this year.
All of this points to a lack of discipline.
Discipline starts from the top, and it is a
core fundamental of any successful ath
letic program. Stanford was lucky to have
Tyrone Willingham for seven years. I le is
clearly one of the best coaches in college
football, and someone who started with
discipline. Hut seriously, given Teevens'
recent tenure at Florida under Steve
Spurrier, does it surprise anyone that dis
cipline would not be at the top of his list
of priorities?
Athletic: Director Ted Leland needs to
realize he made a mistake in hiring
I'eevens, and he needs to fix it now. If Le
land fails to take the appropriate course of
ac tion, he will face a repeat of this year's
performance, even more disgruntled stu
dent and alumni bodies and even more
empty seats next season.
