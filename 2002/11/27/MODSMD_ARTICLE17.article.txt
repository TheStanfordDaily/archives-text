# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Sustainable food consumption is in Stanford's best interest 
### AARON SHAW JONATHAN NERIL STUDENTS FOR A SUSTAINABLE STANFORD 
1 housands of pounds offood are deliv
ered every day from all over the world lo
feed the Stanford community. Where
does this food come from? How is it
grown? Who grows it? Much of the food
we eat travels from Latin America, Asia
and elsewhere after being sprayed with
synthetic chemical pesticides and ripening
preservatives. Profits often go to large dis
tributors and not directly to the farmers
who grow the food.
Yet a different food system is possible.
We hope to raise awareness of food sus
tainability issues and suggest ways to reeval
uate our current consumption. On cam
pus, University Dining Services, the Cool
Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center and Bon
Appetit are working to bring change to
food services. Seasonal cooking and pur
chasing directly from small, local and or
ganic farms are a recipe for more consci
entious and sustainable consumption.
The first significant part of more sus
tainable food purchasing is organic food.
Rather than use synthetic chemical pesti
cides, organic agriculture limits pests
through more environmentally sound al

ternatives like beneficial insects and c rop
diversification.
The organic foods industry is growing
annually by 20 percent. I Tie popularity and
profitability of organic food products re
flect the growth of sustailiability concerns
among consumers. Retailers and con
sumers recognize the potential health, en
vironmental and social just ice benefits of or
ganic foods. Plus, the recently ratified
USDA organic standards will help ensure
the consistency of organic foods and may
increase the popularity of these products.
These standards represent a vital step in the
process of regulating and promoting the
most sustainable food products.
Organic farming practices directly re
duce the negative environmental effects
of agriculture on the health of surround
ing ecosystems. The Kl'A estimates that
synthetic pesticides (some cancer-caus
ing) contaminate the groundwater in 38
states. Many conventional farming meth
ods also contribute to the erosion and
contamination of soils, as well as the
degradation of biological habitats.
Through sustainable food purchasing
and production, we c an support respon
sible management of water, soil and bio
logical resources.
Also, organic agriculture eliminates

the harmful exposure of farm workers to
hazardous concentrations of synthetic
pesticides. Nearby, in the Central Valley
of California, farm workers and their
children continue to suffer from cancers,
birth defects and lung diseases caused by
exposure to pesticides sprayed on the
food they buy.
Economically, organic purchasing dis
courages unethical farming practices that
tail to prioritize the interests of both labor
ers and consumers. Effective use of more
sustainable and conscientious consump
tion can prevent irresponsible production
methods and improve working conditions
in the agricultural industry.
A second important aspect of sustain
able food is local purchasing, which mini
mizes the distance food travels between
harvesting and production. By local, we
mean food grown within about 200 miles
of Stanford, including much of the fertile
California Central Valley. U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture figures indicate the
average distance food travels between har
vest and consumption is 1,500 miles. II we
can cut 1,300 miles from the distance the
average food item travels to Stanford, we
will be contributing less to air pollution,
global climate change and oil dependency.
Suppliers of locally grown fruits and veg

etables usually harvest produce within 24
hours of delivery. In terms of freshness,
this makes clays- or even weeks-old food
from afar pale by comparison. And food
picked and eaten at its ripest will taste hel
ler than food transported over long dis
tances and often preserved with pesti
cides. Additionally, seasonal cooking al
lows us to eat well from the food that grows
around us at all times of the year. This
means preparing food using seasonally
available ingredients, instead of relying on
those grown in distant climates.
Direct purchasing from small farmers
represents a third key factor in a more sus
tainable food system. Stanford is an ideal
customer for small farms because it pro
vides a large enough, predictable demand
to allow small organic farmers to plant di
versified crops. Such arrangements pro
mote the economic sustainability of small
forms. Price has often been a key factor
limiting organic purchasing, but Stan
lord can obtain cost-competitive organic
produce by purchasing directly from
local small farmers instead of from dis
tributors like Sysco.
In light of these broader concerns, we
believe that the expansion of sustainable
food purchasing and production merits
the support of the Stanford community.

Cooperative efforts can encourage a pro
cess of transition to more sustainable prac
tices in food services here on campus.
University Dining Services Executive Di
rector Nadeem Siddicjui and administra
tive staff deserve recognition for their ef
forts to bring more food liom local organic
small farms directly into Stanford dining
halls. University Dining Services will con
tinue working to make on-campus dining
options as fresh, environmentally sustain
able and cost-effective as possible. At the
Cantor Arts Center, The Cool Cafe contin
ues to promote the use of fresh, local ingre
dients in its exceptional dishes. Also, Bon
Appetit's recent "I fome Crown Thanksgiv
ing" lunch offered local and organic foods
at very reasonable prices.
Individual members of the Stanford
community can promote a more sustainable
food system. We can buy local, shop at farm
ers' markets and cook seasonally. We can
ask chefs in dining halls for local, seasonal,
organic food. We can support food
providers on campus who use sustainable
food products. By promoting these small
changes, we can make (he most out of our
food consumption on "the Farm."

University Dining Services Executive Di
rector Nadeem Siddicjui and administra
tive staff deserve recognition for their ef
forts to bring more food liom local organic
small farms directly into Stanford dining
halls. University Dining Services will con
tinue working to make on-campus dining
options as fresh, environmentally sustain
able and cost-effective as possible. At the
Cantor Arts Center, The Cool Cafe contin
ues to promote the use of fresh, local ingre
dients in its exceptional dishes. Also, Bon
Appetit's recent "I fome Crown Thanksgiv
ing" lunch offered local and organic foods
at very reasonable prices.
Individual members of the Stanford
community can promote a more sustainable
food system. We can buy local, shop at farm
ers' markets and cook seasonally. We can
ask chefs in dining halls for local, seasonal,
organic food. We can support food
providers on campus who use sustainable
food products. By promoting these small
changes, we can make (he most out of our
food consumption on "the Farm."

1 housands of pounds offood are deliv
ered every day from all over the world lo
feed the Stanford community. Where
does this food come from? How is it
grown? Who grows it? Much of the food
we eat travels from Latin America, Asia
and elsewhere after being sprayed with
synthetic chemical pesticides and ripening
preservatives. Profits often go to large dis
tributors and not directly to the farmers
who grow the food.
Yet a different food system is possible.
We hope to raise awareness of food sus
tainability issues and suggest ways to reeval
uate our current consumption. On cam
pus, University Dining Services, the Cool
Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center and Bon
Appetit are working to bring change to
food services. Seasonal cooking and pur
chasing directly from small, local and or
ganic farms are a recipe for more consci
entious and sustainable consumption.
The first significant part of more sus
tainable food purchasing is organic food.
Rather than use synthetic chemical pesti
cides, organic agriculture limits pests
through more environmentally sound al

ternatives like beneficial insects and c rop
diversification.
The organic foods industry is growing
annually by 20 percent. I Tie popularity and
profitability of organic food products re
flect the growth of sustailiability concerns
among consumers. Retailers and con
sumers recognize the potential health, en
vironmental and social just ice benefits of or
ganic foods. Plus, the recently ratified
USDA organic standards will help ensure
the consistency of organic foods and may
increase the popularity of these products.
These standards represent a vital step in the
process of regulating and promoting the
most sustainable food products.
Organic farming practices directly re
duce the negative environmental effects
of agriculture on the health of surround
ing ecosystems. The Kl'A estimates that
synthetic pesticides (some cancer-caus
ing) contaminate the groundwater in 38
states. Many conventional farming meth
ods also contribute to the erosion and
contamination of soils, as well as the
degradation of biological habitats.
Through sustainable food purchasing
and production, we c an support respon
sible management of water, soil and bio
logical resources.
Also, organic agriculture eliminates

the harmful exposure of farm workers to
hazardous concentrations of synthetic
pesticides. Nearby, in the Central Valley
of California, farm workers and their
children continue to suffer from cancers,
birth defects and lung diseases caused by
exposure to pesticides sprayed on the
food they buy.
Economically, organic purchasing dis
courages unethical farming practices that
tail to prioritize the interests of both labor
ers and consumers. Effective use of more
sustainable and conscientious consump
tion can prevent irresponsible production
methods and improve working conditions
in the agricultural industry.
A second important aspect of sustain
able food is local purchasing, which mini
mizes the distance food travels between
harvesting and production. By local, we
mean food grown within about 200 miles
of Stanford, including much of the fertile
California Central Valley. U.S. Depart
ment of Agriculture figures indicate the
average distance food travels between har
vest and consumption is 1,500 miles. II we
can cut 1,300 miles from the distance the
average food item travels to Stanford, we
will be contributing less to air pollution,
global climate change and oil dependency.
Suppliers of locally grown fruits and veg

etables usually harvest produce within 24
hours of delivery. In terms of freshness,
this makes clays- or even weeks-old food
from afar pale by comparison. And food
picked and eaten at its ripest will taste hel
ler than food transported over long dis
tances and often preserved with pesti
cides. Additionally, seasonal cooking al
lows us to eat well from the food that grows
around us at all times of the year. This
means preparing food using seasonally
available ingredients, instead of relying on
those grown in distant climates.
Direct purchasing from small farmers
represents a third key factor in a more sus
tainable food system. Stanford is an ideal
customer for small farms because it pro
vides a large enough, predictable demand
to allow small organic farmers to plant di
versified crops. Such arrangements pro
mote the economic sustainability of small
forms. Price has often been a key factor
limiting organic purchasing, but Stan
lord can obtain cost-competitive organic
produce by purchasing directly from
local small farmers instead of from dis
tributors like Sysco.
In light of these broader concerns, we
believe that the expansion of sustainable
food purchasing and production merits
the support of the Stanford community.

cess of transition to more sustainable prac
tices in food services here on campus.
