## Basketball travels to NYC for NIT semis 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
New York has maintained a
symbolic importance throughout
the course of American history,
and now, in a post-Sept. 11 world,
this idea resonates more than ever.

Men's Basketball

vs. No. 7 Florida at New York,
Tonight, 4:00 p.m., NIT Semifinals
vs. No. 2 Kansas or UNC at New
York, Friday

So, alter winning its first two
games of the Preseason Ni l'— a
61-57 win over Boston University
and a 63-62 win over then-No. 11-
ranked Xaiver — the Cardinal (3-
0) has now been given an opportu
nity to perform on this ultimate
centerstage in the tournament's
semifinal round.
"With all that's happened there,
it definitely means a lot to me to
play [in New York] in front of
those fans," said senior guard
Julius Barnes.
But more than a showcase for
New Yorkers, the Preseason NIT
is the first stop en route to the
"Promised Land" for an unranked
Cardinal team that is aching to re
turn to the nation's top 25.
How many times in the presea
son does an unranked team get the
opportunity to legitimize an
upset?
Not many.
Stanford will get its second op
portunity to prove its mettle today
against No. 7 Florida (3-0) at Madi
son Square Garden.
"I put in the media guide that the
one place I wanted to play before
ray career was over was Madison
Square," said junior shooting guard
Matt Lottich. "I'm really excited to
go to New York, to play on that
floor. [The trip] was definitely some
motivation for us to play well."
And for the still-unranked Car
dinal, New York, Madison Square
Garden and a matchup with the
Gators in the semifinals of the Pre
season NIT are all part of a great
opportunity that Stanford could
seize at this juncture of the season.
It won't be so simple though. If
you thought Xavier was tough,
Florida's even better.
Case in point: Thus far, the

Gators haven't been tested by the
Preseason Nil in the same way
that the Cardinal has. Florida's av
erage margin of victory was 27.5
points in its first two tournament
games, as opposed to Stanford's
meager 2.5 point margin of victo
ry. More than anything, the Gators
will provide a definite test fora
Cardinal team that has struggled
in past years to handle the lull
court press.
"Florida's more pressure-ori
ented," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They want to
run. We've seen some pressure,
but nothing like that."
Against Coastal Carolina, the
Gators' second-round opponent,
Florida forced 23 turnovers and
held the Chanticleers to 17 points
in the first half. However, the
team's definitely not one-dimen
sional, as Florida has clearly
proven that it has a number of
players who can put points up on
the board. Led offensively by two
freshmen, Anthony Roberson and
Matt Walsh, the Gators have aver
aged 88 points per game.
If there is any proof of how fick
le the national ranking system is
these days, one only needs to look
at Stanford's sudden rise in the
polls. Stanford, originally picked
to finish seventh in the Pacific-10
Conference, one week later finds
itself in the oh-so coveted No. 26
spot in this week's polls — now
ahead of Southern California, Cal
ifornia and Arizona State, all Pac
-10 schools previously picked to fin
ish ahead of Stanford in regular
season conference play.
Given this, an upset victory over
Florida (and perhaps, the opportu
nity to take on No. 2 Kansas in the
Nil final) should undoubtedly cat
apult Stanford back into the na
tion's top 25, a place quite familiar
to the Cardinal. Stanford, up until
this season, had been ranked in the
top 25 for 94 consecutive weeks, a
streak second only to No. 6 Duke.
"We feel like we're in really
good company with the teams up
[at the Preseason NIT]," said
sophomore center Rob Little.
"The competition up there is
going to really be tough. But at the
same time, you get good by play
ing good people. I think the main
thing for us is to go up there and be

competitive. We're going up there
to win."
The Jayhawks will be hanging
around the Garden as well, as the
top-ranked team left in the presti
gious 16-team tournament. De
spite losing Drew Gooden to the
Memphis Grizzlies as the fourth
pick in June's NBA Draft, Kansas
still returns a strong group this
year capable of doing the same
amount of damage — and the
team is definitely the favorite in
New York.
Stanford may get an opportuni
ty to redeem its embarrassing 8(i
-63 loss to the Jayhawks that result

Ed in the Cardinal's earty. second
round exit from the NCAA tour
nament last season (that is, if Stan
ford can manage to get past Flori
da, and Kansas can beat unranked
North Carolina in the semifinals).
fheTarheels, like the Cardinal,
have their work cut out for them in
their semifinal match.
"UNC's in the same place we
are," Little said." I hey're a team on
the rise. They have nothing to lose
in New York either."
Tip-off of the Stanford-Florida
matchup is slated for 4:00 p.m ,
and the game will be broadcast na
tionally on ESPN2.

portunity to prove its mettle today
against No. 7 Florida (3-0) at Madi
son Square Garden.
"I put in the media guide that the
one place I wanted to play before
ray career was over was Madison
Square," said junior shooting guard
Matt Lottich. "I'm really excited to
go to New York, to play on that
floor. [The trip] was definitely some
motivation for us to play well."
And for the still-unranked Car
dinal, New York, Madison Square
Garden and a matchup with the
Gators in the semifinals of the Pre
season NIT are all part of a great
opportunity that Stanford could
seize at this juncture of the season.
It won't be so simple though. If
you thought Xavier was tough,
Florida's even better.
Case in point: Thus far, the

Gators haven't been tested by the
Preseason Nil in the same way
that the Cardinal has. Florida's av
erage margin of victory was 27.5
points in its first two tournament
games, as opposed to Stanford's
meager 2.5 point margin of victo
ry. More than anything, the Gators
will provide a definite test fora
Cardinal team that has struggled
in past years to handle the lull
court press.
"Florida's more pressure-ori
ented," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They want to
run. We've seen some pressure,
but nothing like that."
Against Coastal Carolina, the
Gators' second-round opponent,
Florida forced 23 turnovers and
held the Chanticleers to 17 points
in the first half. However, the
team's definitely not one-dimen
sional, as Florida has clearly
proven that it has a number of
players who can put points up on
the board. Led offensively by two
freshmen, Anthony Roberson and
Matt Walsh, the Gators have aver
aged 88 points per game.
If there is any proof of how fick
le the national ranking system is
these days, one only needs to look
at Stanford's sudden rise in the
polls. Stanford, originally picked
to finish seventh in the Pacific-10
Conference, one week later finds
itself in the oh-so coveted No. 26
spot in this week's polls — now
ahead of Southern California, Cal
ifornia and Arizona State, all Pac
-10 schools previously picked to fin
ish ahead of Stanford in regular
season conference play.
Given this, an upset victory over
Florida (and perhaps, the opportu
nity to take on No. 2 Kansas in the
Nil final) should undoubtedly cat
apult Stanford back into the na
tion's top 25, a place quite familiar
to the Cardinal. Stanford, up until
this season, had been ranked in the
top 25 for 94 consecutive weeks, a
streak second only to No. 6 Duke.
"We feel like we're in really
good company with the teams up
[at the Preseason NIT]," said
sophomore center Rob Little.
"The competition up there is
going to really be tough. But at the
same time, you get good by play
ing good people. I think the main
thing for us is to go up there and be

competitive. We're going up there
to win."
The Jayhawks will be hanging
around the Garden as well, as the
top-ranked team left in the presti
gious 16-team tournament. De
spite losing Drew Gooden to the
Memphis Grizzlies as the fourth
pick in June's NBA Draft, Kansas
still returns a strong group this
year capable of doing the same
amount of damage — and the
team is definitely the favorite in
New York.
Stanford may get an opportuni
ty to redeem its embarrassing 8(i
-63 loss to the Jayhawks that result

Ed in the Cardinal's earty. second
round exit from the NCAA tour
nament last season (that is, if Stan
ford can manage to get past Flori
da, and Kansas can beat unranked
North Carolina in the semifinals).
fheTarheels, like the Cardinal,
have their work cut out for them in
their semifinal match.
"UNC's in the same place we
are," Little said." I hey're a team on
the rise. They have nothing to lose
in New York either."
Tip-off of the Stanford-Florida
matchup is slated for 4:00 p.m ,
and the game will be broadcast na
tionally on ESPN2.

Senior guard Julius Barnes rises over a Rice defender in Sunday's 79-62 win
over the Owls. Barnes will try to build on his career-high 28-point perfor
mance in today's game against No. 7 Florida in New York.
New York has maintained a
symbolic importance throughout
the course of American history,
and now, in a post-Sept. 11 world,
this idea resonates more than ever.

So, alter winning its first two

61-57 win over Boston University

"With all that's happened there,
