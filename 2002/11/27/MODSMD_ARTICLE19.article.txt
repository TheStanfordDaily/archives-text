### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With its injury situation sluggishly improving and
only nine players in uniform, Stanford is in survival
mode right now.
And to make matters worse, t here's a menace waiting
in the wings that looks to give the No. 7 Cardinal (2-0)
some serious fits.

vs. No. 2 Kansas St. or Temple, Saturday

No. 2 Kansas State (4-0), which captured its first
WN IT title this past Sunday, seems like a sure bet to be
playing the Cardinal in the title game of the Stanford
Tournament this Fhanksgiving weekend.
Friday night, the Wildcats will square off against
Temple (2-0) at 6:00 p.m., while Stanford plays host to
Princeton (1-1) in the late game — two matchups the
higher-ranked teams are expected to win.
But come Saturday night, the Cardinal may face ar
guably its toughest challenge of the season — next to a
December road game at No. 4 'Tennessee — consider
ing the talented nucleus that Kansas State Ixjasts.
The Wildcats return four starters from last year's
Sweet 1(5 club, and each player in that quartet presents
problems for Stanford coach I ara VanDerveer's team.
The foremost among the returnees is junior All-
American candidate Nicole C )hlde, who, at 6-foot-4, will
Ix- a rough assignment for Stanford's interior players.
During the WNI 1, the center displayed her versatility
by averaging 1 8.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists and
1.75 blocks per game.
The other three players, all sophomores, have per
formed just as impressively.
Forward Kcndra Wecker had a monster WNI 112, as
she averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists,
while shooting 52.9 percent from the field and convert
ing all 11 of her 112 ree-throw attempts. For her efforts in
the Wildcats' victorious week, she was named Big 12
Player of the Week.

Additionally, shooting guard Laurie Koehn led the
nation in 3-pointers (122) last season, and Megan Ma
houey seems to have established herself as an extreme
ly dependable point guard for the Wildcats, averaging
7.3 assists per game thus far.
So how in the world do you combat such offensive
firep< >wer?
"We are going to have to play great defense," Van-
Derveer said. "We are going to have to be a lot more ag
gressive than we have lx*en and have to rebound a lot."
