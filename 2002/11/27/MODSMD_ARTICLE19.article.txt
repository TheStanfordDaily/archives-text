# Cardinal awaits KSU showdown
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With its injury situation sluggishly improving and
only nine players in uniform, Stanford is in survival
mode right now.
And to make matters worse, t here's a menace waiting
in the wings that looks to give the No. 7 Cardinal (2-0)
some serious fits.

Women's Basketball

vs. Princeton, Friday, 8:00 p.m.
vs. No. 2 Kansas St. or Temple, Saturday

No. 2 Kansas State (4-0), which captured its first
WN IT title this past Sunday, seems like a sure bet to be
playing the Cardinal in the title game of the Stanford
Tournament this Fhanksgiving weekend.
Friday night, the Wildcats will square off against
Temple (2-0) at 6:00 p.m., while Stanford plays host to
Princeton (1-1) in the late game — two matchups the
higher-ranked teams are expected to win.
But come Saturday night, the Cardinal may face ar
guably its toughest challenge of the season — next to a
December road game at No. 4 'Tennessee — consider
ing the talented nucleus that Kansas State Ixjasts.
The Wildcats return four starters from last year's
Sweet 1(5 club, and each player in that quartet presents
problems for Stanford coach I ara VanDerveer's team.
The foremost among the returnees is junior All-
American candidate Nicole C )hlde, who, at 6-foot-4, will
Ix- a rough assignment for Stanford's interior players.
During the WNI 1, the center displayed her versatility
by averaging 1 8.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists and
1.75 blocks per game.
The other three players, all sophomores, have per
formed just as impressively.
Forward Kcndra Wecker had a monster WNI 112, as
she averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists,
while shooting 52.9 percent from the field and convert
ing all 11 of her 112 ree-throw attempts. For her efforts in
the Wildcats' victorious week, she was named Big 12
Player of the Week.

Additionally, shooting guard Laurie Koehn led the
nation in 3-pointers (122) last season, and Megan Ma
houey seems to have established herself as an extreme
ly dependable point guard for the Wildcats, averaging
7.3 assists per game thus far.
So how in the world do you combat such offensive
firep< >wer?
"We are going to have to play great defense," Van-
Derveer said. "We are going to have to be a lot more ag
gressive than we have lx*en and have to rebound a lot."

Sophomore Sebnem Kimyacioglu drives past a Rutgers
defender in Stanford's 64-60 win on Friday.
And it seems the coaching staff
plans to do something a little more
unorthodox this week in practice.
After all, it's a tall order to try to slow
down a well-oiled machine that has
been winning its games by an aver
age of 16 points thus far.
"We have a lot of guys coming in
this week hopefully trying to pre
pare us lor what [the Wildcats] are
going to show us," redshirt sopho
more point guard Susan King said.
Meanwhile, Stanford has
struggled at times with its lack of
depth in the early going. The Car
dinal eked out two wins by four or
lewer points in the team's open

ing weekend of play, and you
have to wonder what things
would have been like if everyone
were healthy.
"It's good for our team to know
that when the going gets tough, we
will be there for each other," sopho
more guard Kelley Suminski said.
"[But] we can't wait for Nicole [Pow
ell] to come back."
And though Stanford has had
eight bodies on the bench, Van-
Derveer has been essentially em
ploying a six-woman rotation.
Early indications show thai Van-
Derveer is not yet fully comfortable
playing her two healthy freshmen,
Krista Rappahahn and Clare Bo
densteiner, since they've combined
to log a total of 21 minutes in the first
two games.
As a result, some ol the Stan

ford women have been forced to
spend extended amounts of time
on the court.
Suminski had to play all 40 min
utes against Rutgers last Friday, and
King — and her twice surgically re
paired right knee — was stretched
to 37 minutes in the win over San
Francisco Sunday.
"I think tht' real challenge for us
will be playing back-to-back
games," VanDerveer said about
the weekend's tournament. "We
need to make it a seven- or eight
player rotation."
VanDerveer may have that luxu
ry this weekend, however, when ju
nior guard Katie Denny returns
from a broken right hand.
In the meantime, junior forward
Powell's status is still as murky as
ever. And in new injury news, 6-5

freshman center Shelley Nweke
suffered a stress reaction in her left
foot last week and should be out an
other week.
In reality, the top-10 Cardinal
squad is just a shadow of its former
self. It's something the national
media picked up on this past
week, as Stanford slid two spots in
both polls without even losing a
single game.
"I think we've learned we're
gonna be in tough situations and
aren't going to blow teams out,"
King said. "We're just gonna stick
together and keep fighting."
The championship game of the
Stanford Tournament is slated for
8:00 p.m. on Saturday night, and
will be broadcast locally on KRON.
The third-place game will take place
at 5:30 p.m.

Sophomore Sebnem Kimyacioglu drives past a Rutgers
defender in Stanford's 64-60 win on Friday.
And it seems the coaching staff
plans to do something a little more
unorthodox this week in practice.
After all, it's a tall order to try to slow
down a well-oiled machine that has
been winning its games by an aver
age of 16 points thus far.
"We have a lot of guys coming in
this week hopefully trying to pre
pare us lor what [the Wildcats] are
going to show us," redshirt sopho
more point guard Susan King said.
Meanwhile, Stanford has
struggled at times with its lack of
depth in the early going. The Car
dinal eked out two wins by four or
lewer points in the team's open

ing weekend of play, and you
have to wonder what things
would have been like if everyone
were healthy.
"It's good for our team to know
that when the going gets tough, we
will be there for each other," sopho
more guard Kelley Suminski said.
"[But] we can't wait for Nicole [Pow
ell] to come back."
And though Stanford has had
eight bodies on the bench, Van-
Derveer has been essentially em
ploying a six-woman rotation.
Early indications show thai Van-
Derveer is not yet fully comfortable
playing her two healthy freshmen,
Krista Rappahahn and Clare Bo
densteiner, since they've combined
to log a total of 21 minutes in the first
two games.
As a result, some ol the Stan

ford women have been forced to
spend extended amounts of time
on the court.
Suminski had to play all 40 min
utes against Rutgers last Friday, and
King — and her twice surgically re
paired right knee — was stretched
to 37 minutes in the win over San
Francisco Sunday.
"I think tht' real challenge for us
will be playing back-to-back
games," VanDerveer said about
the weekend's tournament. "We
need to make it a seven- or eight
player rotation."
VanDerveer may have that luxu
ry this weekend, however, when ju
nior guard Katie Denny returns
from a broken right hand.
In the meantime, junior forward
Powell's status is still as murky as
ever. And in new injury news, 6-5

freshman center Shelley Nweke
suffered a stress reaction in her left
foot last week and should be out an
other week.
In reality, the top-10 Cardinal
squad is just a shadow of its former
self. It's something the national
media picked up on this past
week, as Stanford slid two spots in
both polls without even losing a
single game.
"I think we've learned we're
gonna be in tough situations and
aren't going to blow teams out,"
King said. "We're just gonna stick
together and keep fighting."
The championship game of the
Stanford Tournament is slated for
8:00 p.m. on Saturday night, and
will be broadcast locally on KRON.
The third-place game will take place
at 5:30 p.m.
With its injury situation sluggishly improving and
only nine players in uniform, Stanford is in survival
mode right now.
And to make matters worse, t here's a menace waiting
in the wings that looks to give the No. 7 Cardinal (2-0)
some serious fits.

vs. Princeton, Friday, 8:00 p.m.
vs. No. 2 Kansas St. or Temple, Saturday

No. 2 Kansas State (4-0), which captured its first
WN IT title this past Sunday, seems like a sure bet to be
playing the Cardinal in the title game of the Stanford
Tournament this Fhanksgiving weekend.
Friday night, the Wildcats will square off against
Temple (2-0) at 6:00 p.m., while Stanford plays host to
Princeton (1-1) in the late game — two matchups the
higher-ranked teams are expected to win.
But come Saturday night, the Cardinal may face ar
guably its toughest challenge of the season — next to a
December road game at No. 4 'Tennessee — consider
ing the talented nucleus that Kansas State Ixjasts.
The Wildcats return four starters from last year's
Sweet 1(5 club, and each player in that quartet presents
problems for Stanford coach I ara VanDerveer's team.
The foremost among the returnees is junior All-
American candidate Nicole C )hlde, who, at 6-foot-4, will
Ix- a rough assignment for Stanford's interior players.
During the WNI 1, the center displayed her versatility
by averaging 1 8.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.8 assists and
1.75 blocks per game.
The other three players, all sophomores, have per
formed just as impressively.
Forward Kcndra Wecker had a monster WNI 112, as
she averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists,
while shooting 52.9 percent from the field and convert
ing all 11 of her 112 ree-throw attempts. For her efforts in
the Wildcats' victorious week, she was named Big 12
Player of the Week.

Additionally, shooting guard Laurie Koehn led the
nation in 3-pointers (122) last season, and Megan Ma
houey seems to have established herself as an extreme
ly dependable point guard for the Wildcats, averaging
7.3 assists per game thus far.
So how in the world do you combat such offensive
firep< >wer?
"We are going to have to play great defense," Van-
