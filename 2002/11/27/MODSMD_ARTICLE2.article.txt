## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lii the struggle over the terms fora new contract be
tween union workers and the administrations of the Stan
ford Hospital and the Luc ile Packard Children's Hospital,
talks between the two sides have been stalled since Nov. 4.
This situation may finally change, as a federal mediator
has been called in by the hospitals' managers to help work
out a new contract.
This past Monday, Commissioner Erin Spaulding of
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services arrived
to help restart the stalled talks between union SEIU local
715 negotiators and the hospitals.
A one-day union strike was held on Nov. 13 outside
of the hospitals, and, according to a statement from the
union released yesterday, it was honored by 90 percent
of the union's 1,400 members. Workers had voted to
strike at the end of October, and union contract nego
tiators gave the legally mandated notice to the hospitals'
managers on Nov. 4, the day of the previous contract's
termination.
"There have been no negotiations since Nov. 4," said
the hospitals' spokesperson, Maria La Ganga. "A meeting
has been scheduled for Monday with the mediator, who
has been in contact with both parties. She has asked both
parties back to the table."
La Ganga added, "We hope that this will end in a con
tract that everyone is happy with. We hope that the SKI U
represented employees will make their voices heard and
that they accept our generous offer of a 21 percent salary
