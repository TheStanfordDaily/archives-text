# Fed. mediator enters hospital labor struggle
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lii the struggle over the terms fora new contract be
tween union workers and the administrations of the Stan
ford Hospital and the Luc ile Packard Children's Hospital,
talks between the two sides have been stalled since Nov. 4.
This situation may finally change, as a federal mediator
has been called in by the hospitals' managers to help work
out a new contract.
This past Monday, Commissioner Erin Spaulding of
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services arrived
to help restart the stalled talks between union SEIU local
715 negotiators and the hospitals.
A one-day union strike was held on Nov. 13 outside
of the hospitals, and, according to a statement from the
union released yesterday, it was honored by 90 percent
of the union's 1,400 members. Workers had voted to
strike at the end of October, and union contract nego
tiators gave the legally mandated notice to the hospitals'
managers on Nov. 4, the day of the previous contract's
termination.
"There have been no negotiations since Nov. 4," said
the hospitals' spokesperson, Maria La Ganga. "A meeting
has been scheduled for Monday with the mediator, who
has been in contact with both parties. She has asked both
parties back to the table."
La Ganga added, "We hope that this will end in a con
tract that everyone is happy with. We hope that the SKI U
represented employees will make their voices heard and
that they accept our generous offer of a 21 percent salary

increase over three years."
Hospital administrators have
proposed a wage increase and a
management-led worker-manage
ment committee on stalling issues.
They also offered to create a pay
scale to recognize worker seniority.
"From what we hear from our
employees, they believe it is a gener
ous offer," La Ganga said.
The union, however, maintains
that workers rejected the hospi
tals' offer in a vote on Nov. 8 he
cause it fails to meet the majority
of conditions that they have been
bargaining for.
"We're close on the wage issue,
but it's the other things that re
main a problem: the lack of job se
curity, the lack of voice in staffing,"
said Isobel White, a union repre
sentative. "It's not all about wages
at this point."
"Workers have seen the in
creased use of temporaiy workers
and of outside, for-profit contrac
tors [at the hospitals and at Stan
ford], and they're worried that with
out increased job security in the
contract, the wage increase could
really mean nothing," White said.
"One worker was saying how

management just changed their
policy in the last two days, so (hat
nursing assistants now need to take
care of 10 patients each instead of
nine," she said. "(The worker] was
really upset that it was done without
any room for discussion."
1 he hospitals' administrations
maintain that no changes have been
made in staffing levels.
'There have been no changes in
our staffing policy, and our stalling
is such that we are consistently one
of the best hospitals in America for
patient ire," LaGangasaid.
Despite calls by the Coalition for
Labor Justice and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition that Uni
versity President John Hennessy
become involved in the hospital
disputes, Hennessy's office contin
ues to maintain its distance from
what it sees as the hospitals' inter
nal affairs.
To address concerns from stu
dent organizations and the ASSU
about University labor policy, the
administration plans to hold an
open meeting on its proposed liv
ing wage guidelines for workers at
Stanford.
University Vice President for
Public Relations Gordon Earle
said that the meeting will take
place from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on
Tuesday, Dec. 3, at a location soon
to be released.
