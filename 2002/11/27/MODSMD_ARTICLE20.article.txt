## Cardinal one more win from Final Four 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
The top-seeded Stanford
women's soccer team takes the
pitch at Maloney Field for the final
time this year on Saturday night to
face the Portland Pilots.
A win sends the team on to
Austin, Texas, for the College Cup
Final Four.
A loss sends the Cardinal home
to an early winter break.
Knockout soccer at its finest, as
Stanford looks fora trip to the
Final Four.
The Cardinal will face a dan
gerous opponent in the eighth
seeded Pilots, who have outscored
their opponents 10-0 in the first
three rounds of the tournament.
The Pilot attack is led by sopho
more striker Christine Sinclair,
who tied an NCAA record in the

Women's Soccer

vs. No. 8 Portland, Saturday, 7:00
p.m., NCAA Quarterfinals

Pilot's thircl-round win over Rich
mond as she netted three goals
with one assist fora seven point
game. The Canadian striker now
has goals on the season and 12
goals scored in eight c areer playoff
games — just three goals short of
Mia 1 lamm's NCAA record.
Vet, while Sinclair leads a for
midable attack, the Cardinal de
fense is not shying away from the
challenge. Stanford has a defense
that gave up one goal in confer
ence play and only four goals on
the year. So does the Cardinal see
the need for any special prepara
tion this weekend? After last
week's 1-0 win over Notre Dame
in the third round, it appears not.
"1 thought the defenders were
the players of the game this
game," said senior striker Marc ia
VVallis. "I'm positive and confident
in my defenders, and I don't think
they need to do anything different
in the next game. I leel like their

own playing mentality will take
care of itself."
The Cardinal defense can
comfort itself in the fact that, al
though it has never played
against a striker like Sinclair, the
back four do face some of the best
strikers in the country everyday
in practice.
"You know, we practice
against a Marc'ia Wallis, a Marc ie
Ward, a Jenni Farenbaugh and a
Kelsey Carlson — and there are

no other players like them," said
junior defender Natalie Spilger
after the Notre Dame game. If
there was something wrong in
our back four, they would have
exposed it."
Co-coach Stephanie Erickson
agrees that the intense practices
are "great preparation."
Even so, the matchup of an ex
plosive scorer against a stilling de
fense should be a thrilling one to
watch, especially with a trip to the
Final Four on the line.
Fhe game presents the Cardi
nal with even one more excellent
opponent in a season where the
schedule has been anything but
easy. After opening the year
against defending national c ham
pion Santa Clara, the Cardinal
played a brutal nonconference
schedule, culminating in a
matchup with then-No. 1 North
Carolina. Fhe experience that the
team has accumulated in its 22-1-
0 season will only be to its advan
tage as it takes on another chal
lenging opponent Saturday night.
"We've played a lot of great
teams this year," Erickson said. "It's
just another game against a great
team. We've got a lot of experience
playing in games like that."
Her players echo these
thoughts with their own confi
dence.
"I say it's just another game,"
said senior midfielder Callie With
ers. "If we play our game, we can
beat them."
Fhe Cardinal comes into the
contest riding the momentum of
two thrilling 1-0 victories over Cal
ifornia and Notre Dame, respec
tively. I lie Colden Bears pushed
Stanford into overtime, while the
Irish held the Cardinal attack
scoreless for 80 minutes before fi
nally yielding the only goal of the
match.
Fhe Cardinal holds the series
record against the Pilots with a 4-1-
0 record. Stanford has ended the
Pilots' season twice in the postsea
son in 1992 and 1993. However,
the teams have not met since 1994,
when Portland netted a 2-1 NCAA
quarterfinal win in overtime.
