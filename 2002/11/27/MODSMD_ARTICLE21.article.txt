"She's a great player," Vamasa

Stanford controlled the pace for
most of the contest.
I he Cardinal put on an offen
sive display in the opening game,
as Tom and Nnamani combined
lor 15 kills with just one error be
tween them. Stanford only dug
eight ball's in the game, but a .400
hitting percentage muted Potter's
10 kills and lifted the Cardinal to a
solid 'JO-20 win.
"We're passing well and Anna

set a lot of good sets," Stanford
coach John Dunning said. "She
got all the hitters going."

but it was all Stanford the rest of
the way. The Cardinal closed the
match on a 15-6 run, forcing the
Broncos to seven hitting errors
during the closing stretch of Stan
ford's 30-21 win.
The Cardinal will now take the
next four days off for the Thanks

the gym on Sunday to practice and
watch the NCAA selection show.
Stanford will be looking to get one
of the lop four seeds in the tourna

Final four in New Orleans.
"Every match has been an inte
gral part of where we stand with
regards to the NCAA tourna
ment," Yatnasaki said. "We played
the toughest schedule in tlu*conn
try. We've said a lot with our team
this year."

get a win like this," said Tom,
who was named the Pacific-10

the second straight season yester
day. Tom was joined on the All-
Pac-10 team by junior middle
blocker Sara McCee and sopho

blocks, as Stanford frustrated all of
the Broncos' hitters at the net.
All of them, that is, except for
Santa Clara outside hitter Becky
Potter. For two games Potter went
unchecked by the Stanford de
fense in tallying If) kills at a .500
( lip belbre being held to just three
kills in the final game.
"She's a great player," Vamasa

Stanford controlled the pace for
most of the contest.

sive display in the opening game,
as Tom and Nnamani combined
lor 15 kills with just one error be
tween them. Stanford only dug
eight ball's in the game, but a .400

10 kills and lifted the Cardinal to a
solid 'JO-20 win.
"We're passing well and Anna

set a lot of good sets," Stanford
coach John Dunning said. "She
got all the hitters going."
Seven different Cardinal play
ers posted blocks in the second
game, while the Stanford attackers
held themselves to just two errors.
Six kills by lorn highlighted the
Cardinal's quick 30-21 win.

but it was all Stanford the rest of
the way. The Cardinal closed the
match on a 15-6 run, forcing the
Broncos to seven hitting errors
during the closing stretch of Stan
ford's 30-21 win.
The Cardinal will now take the
next four days off for the Thanks

the gym on Sunday to practice and
watch the NCAA selection show.
Stanford will be looking to get one
of the lop four seeds in the tourna
ment, which promises home court
advantage all the way up to the
Final four in New Orleans.
"Every match has been an inte
gral part of where we stand with
regards to the NCAA tourna
ment," Yatnasaki said. "We played
the toughest schedule in tlu*conn
try. We've said a lot with our team
this year."
