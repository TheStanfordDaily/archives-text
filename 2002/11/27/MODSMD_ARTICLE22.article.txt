# Soccer battles Portland in tourney

Forty-eight teams. One champi
onship.
Tonight, the ninth-seeded Car
dinal men's soccer team (14-4-2) will
host a second-round match against
Portland (13-5-1), beginning the
quest for its elusive first NCAA
men's College Cup.
In seven previous appearances
in the tournament, Stanford lias
made four first-round exits,
reached the quarterfinals three
times, advanced to the College
Cup Final Four twice and played
in one championship match. Al
though these past performances
have vaulted the Cardinal into the
elite of collegiate men's soccer,
they still have not earned Stanford
the bragging rights as the best
team in the nation.
Coining off two confidence
building conference wins at ()regon
State and Washington two week
ends ago, this year's Cardinal squad
enters the postseason with high
hopes of bringing home its first-ever
NCAA championship.
"Right now, our spirits are real
ly high," said sophomore midfield
er James Iwellman. "Our confi
dence level is really high coming
off our last two matches. We've
had a long break since our last
game, so I think we're gonna come
out flying."
I lead coach lirel Simon believes
that his team is in good shape to
make some waves in the tourney.
"The team looks very hungry
and very confident," he said. "I'm
very pleased with the way the team
has trained. We will have to play
confidently and sharply to give

ourselves the best chance to win,
and right now all those pieces are
together."
Just a few matches ago, nobody
would have ever thought that Stan
ford would possess such an attitude
entering the postseason.
It was only two weeks ago that

Stanford came off a disappointing
1-0 home loss to UCLA for its filth
scoreless game in its last six contests.
What made that stretch even worse
was that all six games were confer
ence matches.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
that streak occurred during the reg
ular season, and although it would
have rather won those games, the

squad knows that it will start oil with
a clean slate tonight.
All season long, the team has
been forced to battle injuries to sev
eral of its key starters. Although the
bench has stepped up admirably,
not having All-Pacific- 10-Confer
ence lorward Roger Levesque and
second-team All-Pac-10 defender
lodd Dunivant fora combined
eight games was a big blow. It was
no coincidence that their absence
coincided with the Cardinal's five
match lull.
However, according to Simon,
the two are as fit as they I lave been all
season, and, overall, the team seems
to have a clean bill of health.
Stanford has had plenty of time
to return to 100 percent thanks to
the first-round bye it received for
being seeded in the top 16. The
rest the team has gotten at home

will be important since, if the Car
dinal wins tonight, the rest of its
tournament games will be played
away 112 rom the Farm.
"We don't think [the seeding isj
a major factor," Simon said. "The
most important thing is that we're
playing well and confidently going
into the tournament. We think
we'll be line as long as we're playing
our best."
Twellman echoed his coach's
thoughts about the team's position
in the tournament.
"The seedings really don't mat
ter," he said. "They can give you
an advantage, but at some point in
the tourney, you're gonna have to
beat a [higher-seeded] team.
We're not disappointed [with the
seeding] at all. If we play well, we
can beat anybody."
That theory will be severely test
ed tonight by a competitive and fa
miliar opponent in Portland.
Earlier this season at the Bay
Area Classic, the then-No. 1 Car
dinal passed a still test against

then-No. 14 Portland, beating the
Pilots 2-0.
"We'll be a lot more prepared
this time since we've already played
them," Twellman said. "We know
the way they play, and we know
their players pretty well. That'll be
to our advantage, but then again, we
shouldn't expect anything from our
last game."
The West Coast Conference
champion Pilots advanced to the
second round by beating Oregon
State 2-0 last week. They bring a
potent scoring attack, led by Nate
Jaqua, who has a team-leading 27
points. The Cardinal will counter
with its solid defense — led by se
nior defenders Dunivant and Tay
lor Graham — that has allowed
only 13goalson the season, posting
10 shutouts along the way.
However, in order for Stanford
to advance far into the tournament,
it will need more performances
from (he complete and confident
team that showed up in the last two
matches.
