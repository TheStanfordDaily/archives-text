Tonight, the ninth-seeded Car
dinal men's soccer team (14-4-2) will
host a second-round match against
Portland (13-5-1), beginning the
quest for its elusive first NCAA
men's College Cup.

very pleased with the way the team
has trained. We will have to play
confidently and sharply to give

Just a few matches ago, nobody
would have ever thought that Stan
ford would possess such an attitude
entering the postseason.
It was only two weeks ago that

Stanford came off a disappointing
1-0 home loss to UCLA for its filth
scoreless game in its last six contests.
What made that stretch even worse
was that all six games were confer

Fortunately for the Cardinal,
that streak occurred during the reg
ular season, and although it would
have rather won those games, the
