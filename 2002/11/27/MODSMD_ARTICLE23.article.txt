# Water Polo to battle Pacific
## 
### 
I he top-ranked Stanford men's
water polo team will look to defend
its Mountain Pacific Spoils Federa
tion title and earn an automatic bid
to the NCAA tournament .it this
weekend's MPSF Tournament at
the Joint Forces Training Base in
Los Alamitos, Calif.
Men's Water Polo

vs. No. 8 Pacific at Los Alamitos,
Calif., MPSF Quarterfinals

I he Cardinal (21-3) is virtually
assured of a spot in next week's
NCAA Championships already
after its 8-7 win over No. 2 Cali
lornia in Saturday's Big Splash at
Berkeley. With the nation's best
record and a 2-1 edge in its season
series with the Bears, the defend
ing national champion Cardinal is
the obvious choice lor the one at
large bid to the lour-team NCA\

tournament should it liill short of
the MPSF title this weekend.
But Stanford will look to take
any uncertainty completely out
of the equation, as it enters the
MPSF tournament as the No. 2
seed, behind sixth-ranked Pep
perdine, the MPSF regular sea
son champion.
1 lie Cardinal will take on No.
8 Pacific (10-12), the tourna
ment's No. 7 seed, in Friday's
quarterfinal round. Stanford
knocked oil the Tigers twice dur
ing the regular season, edging
Pacific 11-8 in Stockton on Oct. 2
before cruising to a 14-(i win at
home eight days later.
Stanford will again look to
sophomore Tony Azevedo, who
leads the conference with 82 goals
on the year, to carry the team of
fensively. Junior Mike Derse's 42
goals and senior Peter Hudnut's

Sf) have also helped the potent
Cardinal attack tooutscore its op
ponents by a commanding 281-
157 margin on the year.
Juniors Eddie Wisniewski and
Sasha Maese, who combined for
six of Pacific's 14 goals in the first
two Stanford matchups, lead the
Tigers' oflense.
Junior goalie Laurie Trettel
has helped keep Pacific: alloat with
one of the highest save averages in
the MPSF. His counterpart at the
otfier end, Stanford senior keeper
Nic k Ellis, boasts one of the con
ference's lowest GAA.
Should Stanford win its first
game, it will likely lace the third
seeded Golden Bears, who will
take on sixth-seeded UC-Irvine
on Friday, in Saturday's semifi
nals. The MPSF championship
match will be played on Sunday.
