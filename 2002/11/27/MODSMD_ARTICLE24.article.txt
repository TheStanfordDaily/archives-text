## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The fact that its official fall season ended last
weekend isn't keeping the Cardinal sailing
team oil t he water.
This weekend, Stanford will participate in the
Goodwill Regatta, an event that pits American
and Japanese sailors against one another in
friendly competition every lew years. Sponsored
by the Japanese company NIKKEN, the compe
tition — held every four years in Japan — will
head to Southern California, where upwards ol
16 teams from both countries will lace off.
From Friday though Sunday, senior skipper
Matt I looks will represent Stanford with junior
crew Diana Ly. Hooks and Ly have worked in
tandem all season, so the upcoming regatta will
mean different competition in a familial team
environment. Hooks said he was looking for
ward to racing Japanese sailors as well as com
peting against America's finest.
"There's going to be some of the top college
sailing teams there," 1 looks said, "so it's always
good to race against them."
He was equally excited about the interna
tional aspect of the Goodwill Games. "It will be
fun to represent the U.S. in this international
regatta, and it should be a great opportunity to
see what everyone else is up to."
Though neither Hooks nor Ly has had ex
perience racing iti this particular regatta be
fore, the duo does have some interesting Stan
ford history to contend with.

Though a new experience for some younger
Stanford sailors, the regatta is a recent memory
lot one member ol the (Cardinal coaching stall.
Assistant Coach Brent Hat rill, who graduated
from I lawaii in 2000, represented the Warriors
at (Goodwill.
Cardinal connections can be traced even
across the globe, as current Stanford graduate
student Aki Yokoyama competed on one ol'the
Japanese teams in a previous (ioodu ill Regatta.
In lint, Stanford coach Amy Kehoe taught
Yokoyama in one of her intermediate sailing
classes in the lall of 2001.
I fowever, neither Amy Kehoe nor Stanford
coach |ay Kehoe has themselves coached in this

regalia before. Jay Kelioe empfiasi/ed his en
thusiasm for competing with international par
ticipant in an event geared toward building
friendship on the water.
"It's .1 great regatta from everything I've
heard," |ay Kehoe said of the Goodwill Regatta,
which will include only one division of competi
tion rather than the two or three that most typi
cal regattas feature.
In particular, Jay Kehoe was pleased about
the Cardinal's involvement because of the posi
tive attitude associated with the (Goodwill
(iames.
"Stanford is invited every year mainly be
cause of our sportsmanship," Jay Kehoe said.
