## Viagra could save endangered species 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the French
Atomic Energy Commission an
nounced last week they had dis
covered a massive black hole rac
ing across the Milky Way about
6,000 light years away. Moving
four times faster than the stars
around it, the black hole was de
tected because ii was enveloping a
nearby companion star. This is the
fust time a black hole was found
zooming through the galactic
plane. Black holes form when a
giant star dies and huge concen
trations of mass are condensed
into a small enough area that not
even light can escape.
Scient+sts at UC-San Francisco
have identified a molecule that
acts as a mastermind over the ac
tion of hundreds of different
genes. The molecule, known as in
ositol polyphosphate, controls en
zymes that restructure chromo
somes. By exposing different
genes at different times, inositol
polyphosphate controls how
genes are repaired, copied and
translated into proteins. The re
searchers believe that this broad
level of control permits organisms
to respond quickly and globally to
stress and other changes in the en
vironment.
Viagra, the anti-impotence
drug that has been so popular in
recent years among humans, may
help endangered animal species

— but not in the way you might
think. According to conservation
ists, Viagra's success has reduced
the demand for animal parts that
have been traditionally used to
cure impotence. Researchers have
found that demand for antler vel
vet from Alaskan reindeer and sex
organs from Canadian hooded
and harp seals has declined since
Viagra was introduced in 1998.
Conservationists believe the great
est positive impact will occur in
China, where traditional recipes
for impotence often take green
turtles, geckos and sea horses.
Researchers at Washington
State have developed a method to
transform wheat straw into build
ing materials. The method uses
fungi to degrade the straw and re
move unwanted compounds. The
remains are then ground into a
powder, mixed with plastic and
heated into a doughy substance.
The final product is lightweight,
more durable than wood and can
be easily dyed. The scientists hope
their discovery will give farmers an
incentive to sell leftover straw. The
method is also cleaner and more
energy-efficient than producing
plastic.
Physicists published a study
last week on superconductivity in
plutonium at 18.5 K (almost -250°
C). Superconductivity occurs at
very low temperatures when
atoms align and conduct energy
without friction. It has applica
tions in a variety of fields from
telecommunications to magnetic
levitating trains. The study was a
joint effort among Los Alamos Na
tional Laboratory, University of
Florida and the Institute for
Transuranium Elements in Ger
many and marked the first time
superconductivity was observed in
plutonium.
