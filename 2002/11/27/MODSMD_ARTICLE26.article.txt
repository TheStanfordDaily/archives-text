# Open heart, closed chest:
## Robots make heart surgery less invasive 
### ABHI VASE 
Your next surgeon could very
well be a robot — well, not exactly.
But instead of standing over you
wielding a scalpel, your future
surgeon could sit at a console and
manipulate controls that manage
robotic arms to repair a damaged
portion of your heart.
This vision of surgery, known as
robotic microsurgery, has taken a
major leap in the past few weeks to
ward making minimally invasive
cardiac surgery even less invasive.
On Nov. 13, the FDA ap
proved Intuitive'sda Vinci Surgi
cal System™ for use in mitral
valve repair surgery. After re
viewing the clinical data from In
tuitive's endoscopic (closed chest)
mitral valve repair trial, the I DA
concluded that the system can be
used safely and effectively for
minimally invasive mitral valve
repair surgery.
At the American Heart Associa
tion Scientific Sessions meeting
last week, results from coronary
bypass trials (at Columbia-Presby
terian Medical Center) showed
that, for the first time in the Unit
ed States, open heart surgery was
performed without opening the
chest. Surgeons used this new
procedure to successfully repair
the hearts of 17 patients (ages 22
to 68) with atrial septal defect.
In traditional coronary artery
bypass, the surgeon reaches the
heart by cutting through the skin
and using a saw to cut through the
breastbone. A retractor then is
used to separate the sternum, on
two sides, allowing doctors to get

into the chest cavity and the heart.
With the da Vinci, doctors get
to the patient's heart through
three portholes in a V-shape near
the armpit. Each hole is smaller
than a quarter. A camera, called
an endoscope, is inserted into one
of the portholes; two metal tubes
go into the other two. All three in
struments are attached to the
robot's arms.
The lead surgeon sits at a con
sole, which allows him to manip
ulate the arms of the robot. The
robot mimics all of the surgeon's
movements — he moves his hand
right, and the robot's hand moves
right. The surgeon is able to di
rect the robot with help from a
television monitor showing what
is going on inside the patient.
The assisting surgeon works next
to the patient and changes the
surgical instruments on the
robot's arms.
According to Michael Argen
ziano, M.D., lead author of the
study and director of robotic car
diac surgery at Columbia-Presby
terian, the 17 patients who re
ceived successful robotic surgeries
were back to their normal activi
ties after an average of two weeks.
For patients who received tradi
tional surgery, the average recov
ery is about six to 10 weeks.
Furthermore, patients recover
ing from the traditional approach
usually have several inactive
weeks before they are able to re
sume regular activity, while pa
tients who undergo robotic
surgery only spend a couple of
days recovering from local
wounds. Argenziano recalled how

one of his patients was able to pic k
up her toddler the day after her
surgery.
Compared with other minimal
ly invasive heart surgery ap
proaches, robotic assistance elimi
nates tremor, thus allowing the
surgeons to have better control
over the surgical instruments. The
large television monitor also pro
vides them with a better view of
what they are doing.
The researchers found that
robot-assisted endoscopic heart
surgery lasted a little longer than
the traditional technique, but that
may be due to the steep learning
curve necessary to master the new
approach. In robot-assisted
surgery, the heart was stopped for
an average of M minutes com
pared to about 20 minutes for tra
ditional surgery. The time re
quired on the cardiopulmonary
bypass machine was also slightly
longer in robot-assisted surgery.
Robot-assisted surgery is very
costly — about $600 to $1,000
more per procedure, not count
ing the $1 million initial cost of
the equipment and approximate
ly $100,000 for maintenance.
However, the doctors said their
initial cost analysis shows that the
minimally invasive method costs
patients the same over the long
run because patients leave the
hospital quicker and there are
less post-operative complications.
The doctors also hinted at poten
tial benefits to society as patients

will be able to return to work
more quickly and with increased
productivity.
There are additional costs re
quired to train doctors to use the
equipment. Argenziano and his
fellow surgeons trained for more
than a year to use the robot. They
performed 50 operations on ani
mals and parts of operations on
humans to familiarize themselves
with the "3,000 to 4,000 steps to
do it."
Argenziano said that at first he
was uneasy using the computer in
stead of his own hands. But, he
added, the "surgical immersion"
training was so thorough that
when he dropped a utensil while
training on the computer, lie in
stinctively pushed his chair back as
though a real instrument might be
dropping in his lap.
Still, the new three-dimension
al surgery represents a big im
provement over the current two
dimensional surgery done by
video, lie said. He compared the
current two-dimensional surgical
method to "taking an 18-inch
long pencil, holding it by the
eraser end, and trying to write
your name."
With over 132 surgical systems
deployed worldwide and 88 with
in the United States, robots are
revolutionizing t rati it ion a I
surgery. In the words of Dr. Craig
Smith of Columbia University, "in
two years, five years or 10 years,
it's the way things will be done."
