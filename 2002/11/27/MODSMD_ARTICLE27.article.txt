# AIDS just as prevalent in women

(AP) — For the first time in the 20-year history
of the AIDS epidemic, about as many women as
men are infected with HIV, a United Nations re
port says.
The report, presented yesterday in London, paints
a very dismal picture of a disease invading regions of
the globe where it had lor many years tricked experts
into believing some populations might be less suscep
tible, or even immune, to its infection.
"It's once more a sad story — 42 million people liv
ing with HIV today, 5 million new infections in 2002
and 3. 1 million (who have) died from AIDS this year,"
said Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the U.N. aids
agency.
Hie report said 38.6 million adults and 'J.2 million
children under age 15 have 11IV. Of the adults, 19.2
million are women.
I he virus is spreading most rapidly in eastern Eu
rope, where nearly every country is experiencing a
major outbreak. It has also marched swiftly across
Central Asia and into China, where it was nearly
nonexistent a few years ago.
But there are signs of hope. The AIDS Epidemic
Update, an annual report by the World Health Or
ganization and UNAIDS, says prevention programs

appear to be working in the few areas where they
have been set up.
"There are a number of countries where we have
strong empirical evidence that rates of infection are
declining, and in each case they are declining among
young people," Piot said.
He cited South Africa, where HIV infections
among pregnant teenage girls fell 25 percent between
1998 and 2001. In Uganda, the number of new HIV
infections has been dropping every year for the last 10
years, he said.
"This positive trend is the first signal that there is
an impact of the prevention and education pro
grams," Piot said.
Overall, though, there is not only an increase in the
sheer number of people being infected, but also an in
crease in the number of countries now fitting epi
demics, according to Dr. Bernhard Sell wait lander,
director of the lIIV/AIDS division at the World
I lealtli Organization.
For example, 10 years ago HIV was confined to
small areas of Eastern Europe. Today, every country
in the region has an HIV problem.
