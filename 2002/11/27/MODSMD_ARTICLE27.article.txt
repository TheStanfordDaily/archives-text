# AIDS just as prevalent in women
## 
### 
(AP) — For the first time in the 20-year history
of the AIDS epidemic, about as many women as
men are infected with HIV, a United Nations re
port says.
The report, presented yesterday in London, paints
a very dismal picture of a disease invading regions of
the globe where it had lor many years tricked experts
into believing some populations might be less suscep
tible, or even immune, to its infection.
"It's once more a sad story — 42 million people liv
ing with HIV today, 5 million new infections in 2002
and 3. 1 million (who have) died from AIDS this year,"
said Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the U.N. aids
agency.
Hie report said 38.6 million adults and 'J.2 million
children under age 15 have 11IV. Of the adults, 19.2
million are women.
I he virus is spreading most rapidly in eastern Eu
rope, where nearly every country is experiencing a
major outbreak. It has also marched swiftly across
Central Asia and into China, where it was nearly
nonexistent a few years ago.
But there are signs of hope. The AIDS Epidemic
Update, an annual report by the World Health Or
ganization and UNAIDS, says prevention programs

appear to be working in the few areas where they
have been set up.
"There are a number of countries where we have
strong empirical evidence that rates of infection are
declining, and in each case they are declining among
young people," Piot said.
He cited South Africa, where HIV infections
among pregnant teenage girls fell 25 percent between
1998 and 2001. In Uganda, the number of new HIV
infections has been dropping every year for the last 10
years, he said.
"This positive trend is the first signal that there is
an impact of the prevention and education pro
grams," Piot said.
Overall, though, there is not only an increase in the
sheer number of people being infected, but also an in
crease in the number of countries now fitting epi
demics, according to Dr. Bernhard Sell wait lander,
director of the lIIV/AIDS division at the World
I lealtli Organization.
For example, 10 years ago HIV was confined to
small areas of Eastern Europe. Today, every country
in the region has an HIV problem.
"We have seen that no society is
immune," Schwartlander said.
"Even though HIV was quite well
established in many Asian coun
tries very early on, we had seen a
very stable low rate in a number of
countries, li was just at the point
in time where people were start
ing to think maybe these societies
are immune. We have been
shown different."

"In Indonesia, after many years
of silence, of very low rates," an
epidemic is growing, Schwart
lander said. "Of course HIV was
there, but it didn't really lead to
major epidemics. It was just over
the past couple of years that mas
sive spread of HIV has begun, ini
tially in injecting drug users."
In China, where HIV was "vir
tually nonexistent" a few years ago,
there are now 1 million people
with HIV, and the number could
well rise to 10 million
by the end of the decade* he said.
Again, drug use is a major factor.

Sub-Saharan Africa is still by far
the worst-affected region. The sit
uation there also reflects the
spread of AIDS among women,
with about twice as many young
women as men infected.
In 2001, (> percent to 11 per
cent of women between the ages of
15 and 24 years old had HIV,
compared with between 3 percent
and 6 percent of men in the same
age group.
It is particularly difficult for
women in this region to take
precautions against HIV be
cause of their subordinate posi

tion in society. Rape is common
in some countries.
The phenomenon ofintergen
erational sex is also driving much
of the epidemic in southern Africa,
where between one-quarter and
one-third of older men are HIV
positive.
A recent study found that in
Zimbabwe, for instance, many ado
lescent girls have sex with men in
return for clothes and money for
school fees.
I'iot said the shift toward
women will ultimately exacerbate
the spread of HIV, because they

can spread it not only through sex,
but also through nursing and
childbirth.
While HIV drugs can prevent
the virus from being transmitted
through nursing, few women in
Africa have access to them.
The report also found that the
HIV epidemic is aggravating the
famine in sub-Saharan Africa,
where it is women who work the
fields.
" This is the first large-scale sign
of what the impact of AIDS can
and will be for society as a whole,"
I'iot said.

Alan Whiteside, director of the
Health Economics and HIV/AIDS
Research Division at the Universi
ty of Natal in Durban, South
Africa, said it is clear that AIDS is
not just a health crisis, but also a
development crisis.
I he virus is causing an econom
ic crisis in southern Africa, he said,
and worsens political crises in
places such as Zimbabwe.
"In a situation where life ex
pectancy has plummeted it's very
hard to keep them engaged in a fu
ture when they don't believe they
have one," Whiteside said.

Africa, said it is clear that AIDS is
not just a health crisis, but also a
development crisis.
I he virus is causing an econom
ic crisis in southern Africa, he said,
and worsens political crises in
places such as Zimbabwe.
"In a situation where life ex
pectancy has plummeted it's very
hard to keep them engaged in a fu
ture when they don't believe they
have one," Whiteside said.
(AP) — For the first time in the 20-year history
of the AIDS epidemic, about as many women as
men are infected with HIV, a United Nations re
port says.
The report, presented yesterday in London, paints
a very dismal picture of a disease invading regions of
the globe where it had lor many years tricked experts
into believing some populations might be less suscep
tible, or even immune, to its infection.
"It's once more a sad story — 42 million people liv
ing with HIV today, 5 million new infections in 2002
and 3. 1 million (who have) died from AIDS this year,"
said Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the U.N. aids
agency.
Hie report said 38.6 million adults and 'J.2 million
children under age 15 have 11IV. Of the adults, 19.2
million are women.
I he virus is spreading most rapidly in eastern Eu
rope, where nearly every country is experiencing a
major outbreak. It has also marched swiftly across
Central Asia and into China, where it was nearly
nonexistent a few years ago.
But there are signs of hope. The AIDS Epidemic
Update, an annual report by the World Health Or
ganization and UNAIDS, says prevention programs

appear to be working in the few areas where they
have been set up.
"There are a number of countries where we have
strong empirical evidence that rates of infection are
declining, and in each case they are declining among
young people," Piot said.
He cited South Africa, where HIV infections
among pregnant teenage girls fell 25 percent between
1998 and 2001. In Uganda, the number of new HIV
infections has been dropping every year for the last 10
years, he said.
"This positive trend is the first signal that there is
an impact of the prevention and education pro
grams," Piot said.
Overall, though, there is not only an increase in the
sheer number of people being infected, but also an in
crease in the number of countries now fitting epi
demics, according to Dr. Bernhard Sell wait lander,
director of the lIIV/AIDS division at the World
I lealtli Organization.
For example, 10 years ago HIV was confined to
small areas of Eastern Europe. Today, every country
in the region has an HIV problem.
"We have seen that no society is
immune," Schwartlander said.
"Even though HIV was quite well
established in many Asian coun
tries very early on, we had seen a
very stable low rate in a number of
countries, li was just at the point
in time where people were start
ing to think maybe these societies
are immune. We have been
shown different."

"In Indonesia, after many years
of silence, of very low rates," an
epidemic is growing, Schwart
lander said. "Of course HIV was
there, but it didn't really lead to
major epidemics. It was just over
the past couple of years that mas
sive spread of HIV has begun, ini
tially in injecting drug users."
In China, where HIV was "vir
tually nonexistent" a few years ago,
there are now 1 million people
with HIV, and the number could
well rise to 10 million
by the end of the decade* he said.
Again, drug use is a major factor.

Sub-Saharan Africa is still by far
the worst-affected region. The sit
uation there also reflects the
spread of AIDS among women,
with about twice as many young
women as men infected.
In 2001, (> percent to 11 per
cent of women between the ages of
15 and 24 years old had HIV,
compared with between 3 percent
and 6 percent of men in the same
age group.
It is particularly difficult for
women in this region to take
precautions against HIV be
cause of their subordinate posi

tion in society. Rape is common
in some countries.
The phenomenon ofintergen
erational sex is also driving much
of the epidemic in southern Africa,
where between one-quarter and
one-third of older men are HIV
positive.
A recent study found that in
Zimbabwe, for instance, many ado
lescent girls have sex with men in
return for clothes and money for
school fees.
I'iot said the shift toward
women will ultimately exacerbate
the spread of HIV, because they

can spread it not only through sex,
but also through nursing and
childbirth.
While HIV drugs can prevent
the virus from being transmitted
through nursing, few women in
Africa have access to them.
The report also found that the
HIV epidemic is aggravating the
famine in sub-Saharan Africa,
where it is women who work the
fields.
" This is the first large-scale sign
of what the impact of AIDS can
and will be for society as a whole,"
I'iot said.

Health Economics and HIV/AIDS
