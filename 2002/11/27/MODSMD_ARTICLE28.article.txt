# Protecting your credit:
## Consumers fearful of identity theft 
### 
(AP) — Numerous con
sumers moved to try to protect
their finances and credit lines
yesterday, a day alter prosecu
tors warned that thousands of
people were vulnerable to a
high-tech assault on their iden
tities alter records were stolen
from a software company.
"It's just been a deluge,"
said Jay Foley, director of con
sumer and victims services at
the Identity Theft Resource
Center. The San Diego-based
nonprofit organization, which
helps victims of identity theft,
was among several agencies na
tionwide swamped with calls
yesterday.
Callers were worried they
might be victims of a massive

scheme to steal credit informa
tion from thousands of people.
Losses from the scam were put at
$2.7 million and could grow as
more victims are identified.
U.S. Attorney James B.
Comey said Monday that pros
ecutors were still trying to
learn how many people had
their bank accounts drained,
addresses changed, lines of
credit opened and new credit
cards opened without their ap
proval.
He said almost all the
fraudulent charges and with
drawals would he covered by
financial institutions. Prosecu
tors are sending letters to vic
tims that can be used as proof
to credit agencies and finan

cial institutions.
Claudia Farrell, a Federal
Trade Commission spokes
woman in Washington, said calls
to a hot line for people repot ting
identity fraud increased 33 per
cent Monday, while calls seeking
information about identity theft
doubled.
"I think there's another uplick
today," she said yesterday.
Authorities said the scheme
began about three years ago
when Philip Cummings, an em
ployee at a Long Island software
company, sold passwords and
codes lor downloading, con
sumer credit reports to an
unidentified person.
Cummings, 33, of Cartersville,
Ga., was released on $500,000
bond after a court appearance in
Manhattan on Monday at which
he did not speak. The FBI also
charged two other men in the case.
Officials credited the Ford Motor
Credit Co., the world's largest auto
motive finance company, witfi dis

covering the fraud last winter.
Personal information belong
ing to some 30,000 people was
stolen, authorities said. Included
were 15,000 credit reports stolen
from Experian, a credit history bu
reau, using passwords belonging
to Eord Motor Credit Corp., a fi
nance arm of Ford Motor Co. in
Dearborn, Mich., officials said. A
message left with Experian was not
immediately returned yesterday.
Melinda Wilson, a spokes
woman for the Eord credit compa-

Ny, said only a few Ford customers
were affected and the company, a
victim itself , went to authorities im
mediately.
"We didn't know what we had
at first. We just kept digging and
digging and unraveling and
pulling, trying to get to the bot
tom of it," she said. "This was a
breach that was made falsely in
our name and, as such, it was
deeply disturbing."
Libby Hutchinson, a spokes
woman for the Washington Mu

tual Finance Co., said the compa
ny, based in Crossville, Tenn.,
had sent out 6,000 letters to warn
people that its access codes had
been stolen.
"We're not aware of any amount
of money that anyone has lost.
Sadly, that might change," she said,
noting an increase in inquiries by
the public since Monday.
Some people who got letters
"were concerned, actually think
ing we were trying to scam them,"
she said.
