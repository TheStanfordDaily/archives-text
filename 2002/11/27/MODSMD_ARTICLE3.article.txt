# ASSU issues statement on living wage
## Undergraduate Senate also discusses committee on senate-campus communication 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Last night the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate held its final meeting of the quar
ter, introducing status reports on the
University's living-wage policy, the sen
ate's communications initiative and the
ASSU financial manager's report.
Senate Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior, in
troduced the Executive Committee's
statement on the living wage policy to
the floor.
Alter expressing approval of the ad

ministration's commitment to forming a
University committee to research labor
issues, the statement continued, "Admin
istrators, employees, faculty and students
should participate equally on this com
mittee, and all recommendations made
by the committee should be taken into se
rious consideration by the decision-mak
ers of the Stanford administration on
University labor policies."
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez,
ajunior, explained that the statement was
passed in concurrence with the senate
and the Graduate Student Council.
Student representatives to the com
mittee will be selected through the ASSU
Nominations Commission.
Senator Hiro Iwanaga, a senior,
brought up the preliminary findings of
the advocacy committee on communica

tion between the senate and the Stanford
community.
"We have been thinking about chang
ing a lot of things," Iwanaga said. "We
recognize the need for change, from new
programs, like having senators hold of
fice hours, to building the credibility of
the ASSU in the eyes of the students and
the administration."
Various approaches being considered
in response to this problem include hold
ing office hours, having student leader
dinners, increasing contact with adminis
trators and throwing parties.
ASSU Financial Manager David Endel
man, a senior, released his report, which
explained that the ASSU's investment di
vision is concluding its planned transfer of
all its funds into accounts with the
Vanguard brokerage.
"Previously, the ASSU held ac
counts with multiple brokerages,
making both the audit trail and
precise asset allocation more diffi
cult to manage," the report said.

The move was approved last
year, following the advice of the
ASSU financial board's represen
tative from the Stanford Manage
ment Company.
"No money has been 'found,'
and there is no money being spent,
it is simply a transfer from one ac
count to another," Endelman
added. "This applies to monies in
both the endowment and the op
erating fund."
