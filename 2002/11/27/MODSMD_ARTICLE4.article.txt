On weekdays, Main Quad is filled with
students racing by on bikes, but the week
ends bring quite a different crowd. On al
most any Saturday of the year, tuxedos
outnumber t-shirts.
For almost a hundred years, couples
have taken their wedding vows at Stanford.
Memorial Church brings Stanford fami
lies and couples from all over the country to
celebrate their weddings in one of the Uni
versity's most beautiful structures. These
days, the church holds up to five weddings
each weekend: four on Saturday and one
on Sunday. In the past, it held even more.
The Stanford Observer reported that one
chaplain held nine separate ceremonies on
one June day in 1966.
Memorial (.hut ch only c loses its doors on

church held a total of 160 weddings.

place less than a month after the church's
dedication. On Feb. 22. 1903,â€¢Ethel Rhodes
and William Armfield Holt, both members
of the Class of 1902, were the first couple to
be married in Memorial Church. In Febru

Holts'] sentimental attachment to the cam

that Mrs. Holt willed their matching gold
wedding rings to Stanford."
Over the years, the tradition has grown
more common. According to the Novem
ber 1940 edition of the Stanford Alumni
Review, the c hurch had performed an av
erage of 47 weddings per year to date.
Thirteen years later, the May edition of the
Stanford Alumni Review reported that
