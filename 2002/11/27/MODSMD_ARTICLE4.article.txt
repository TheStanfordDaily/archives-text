# Tying the knot at Memorial Church
## GET ME TO THE QUAD ON TIME 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ 
On weekdays, Main Quad is filled with
students racing by on bikes, but the week
ends bring quite a different crowd. On al
most any Saturday of the year, tuxedos
outnumber t-shirts.
For almost a hundred years, couples
have taken their wedding vows at Stanford.
Memorial Church brings Stanford fami
lies and couples from all over the country to
celebrate their weddings in one of the Uni
versity's most beautiful structures. These
days, the church holds up to five weddings
each weekend: four on Saturday and one
on Sunday. In the past, it held even more.
The Stanford Observer reported that one
chaplain held nine separate ceremonies on
one June day in 1966.
Memorial (.hut ch only c loses its doors on
four pre-determined weekends of the year:
graduation, Easter, the first weekend in De
cember, and either Big Game weekend (if
it's at Stanford) or Christmas. Last year the
church held a total of 160 weddings.
Getting married in Memorial Church is
a long-standing tradition at Stanford. The

church was in the original plan for the Uni
versity but was not completed until 1903.
Jane Stanford worked with architects,
builders, artists and sculptors to design and
create the church as a memorial to Leland
Stanford, Sr., who died in 1893.
In its opening year, the church held
three weddings, the first of which took
place less than a month after the church's
dedication. On Feb. 22. 1903,•Ethel Rhodes
and William Armfield Holt, both members
of the Class of 1902, were the first couple to
be married in Memorial Church. In Febru
ary 1967, The Observer wrote that "[the
Holts'] sentimental attachment to the cam
pus and the tradition they began was such
that Mrs. Holt willed their matching gold
wedding rings to Stanford."
Over the years, the tradition has grown
more common. According to the Novem
ber 1940 edition of the Stanford Alumni
Review, the c hurch had performed an av
erage of 47 weddings per year to date.
Thirteen years later, the May edition of the
Stanford Alumni Review reported that
weddings on campus were "in
creasing at a current rate of ap
proximately 80 each year." By
1979 the church was hosting 150
weddings a year.
Organizing the schedule of
ceremonies has become such a
large task that the church has a
full-time wedding coordinator.
Betty Koester, a Stanford alum
na, has been the wedding coordi
nator since 1984. She works close
ly with the couples from the time
they book the church to the wed
ding day. Bridget Dunnington,
married in the church in Septem
ber 1996, worked with Koester on
her wedding.
"She was very organized and
ran a tight clock . . . Everything
was right on schedule and per
fect," Dunnington said.
She still remembers the unique
and neat way that Koester
arranged the bridal party in semi
circles on each side of the altar,
rather than the traditional
straight lines."
Although Koester never imag
ined coming back to Stanford
after graduating, she certainly
does not regret her choice.
"It's a wonderful job . . . and
very satisfying," she commented.
"Almost every weekend, couples
come back to see the church and
thank me."
But this sacred structure is not
open for just anyone to enjoy.
There are strict restrictions on
who is allowed to take their vows
on campus.
In order to be married at Stan
ford, one member of the couple
must be a current student, alum
nus/ alumna, faculty member or
staff member of the University or
have a parent who is such an affil
iate. Koester estimates that
"about 50 percent of couples have
at least one graduate."
Although Bridget, daughter
of Stanford baseball coach Mark
Marquess, and Can Dunnington
met in school at Duke University,
Bridget wanted to get married in
Memorial Church because she
had spent so much time there as
a child. Because many of the
guests were from the East Coast,
Bridget thought the church was
"a great destination wedding.
My guests were blown away by
the campus and the California
landscape."
The whole scene was so beauti
ful that Bridget recalls being pho
tographed in the Quad following
her wedding by at least 50
tourists.
"I guess they just wanted a pic
ture of a wedding at this beautiful
place," she explained.
One of the most beautiful and
memorable parts of the ceremony
is the moment that the doors are
opened at the front of the church,
and the sunlight floods into the
dark structure as the bride begins

her walk down the isle.
"My husband still talks about
it," Dunnington said. In fact, the
sunlight is so bright that Koester
advises brides to wear an extra
slip under their dresses.
One bride admits, "1 didn't be
lieve her, and sure enough in the
wedding photos you can see the
outline of my legs perfectly."
After meeting at Stanford in
Britain (a former Stanford over
seas program), Mary and Phil
Bobel, both Class of '71, were
married Aug. 19, 1972. 1 heir
wedding party was composed
completely of classmates, and
they held the reception at the
Faculty Club. Although Mary
was Catholic and Phil was Epsi
copal, the commonality of the
location seemed to "minimize
the difference."
Mary described it as a "hybrid
wedding — we walked in to
organ music but also had a good
friend playing guitar and singing.
We were married by a Catholic
priest, but we wrote our own vows
and chose our own readings. We
had a Catholic and Christian mix
ture within the nondenomina
tional setting."
The. tradition of nondenomi
nationality dates back to the
founding of the church. Although
Leland and Jane Stanford put a
high value on morals and spiritu
ality, they were not committed to
any particular religion. Thus, the
church was decreed nondenomi
national and has hosted many dif
ferent religious groups including
Catholics, Christians, Sufis, Sikhs,
Mormons and Jews.
Today, the church welcomes
all religious wedding ceremonies
that are able to fit within their
hour allocation. The only restric
tion, Koester explained, is that
the couple must be "happy with
God language." The church will
not allow civil ceremonies.
Raga Ramachandran, Class of
'95 and her husband Joel Moore
held a Hindu / Protestant wed
ding ceremony.
"We selected key elements of
the Hindu ceremony, conducted
in Sanskrit, and a largely Episco
palian text for the Protestant cer
emony," Ramachandran said. "In
the end, we were very happy with
the ceremony itself and with its
significance to our families."
Although the restrictions on
who can get married in Memorial
Church are rigid, reserving the
church is not necessarily as hard
as one would guess, or as urban
myths might suggest. Koester as
sures the church's availability.
"If you are flexible, there is al
ways a date and time," she said.
Although there are rumors
about a wait list for weddings, no
such list exists. In fact, Koester
won't start booking weddings for
2004 until January of 2003.
Koester reports that the most
popular season is May through
September and that the most
popular ceremony times are 3
p.m. and 5 p.m.

and William Armfield Holt, both members
of the Class of 1902, were the first couple to
be married in Memorial Church. In Febru
ary 1967, The Observer wrote that "[the
Holts'] sentimental attachment to the cam
pus and the tradition they began was such
that Mrs. Holt willed their matching gold
wedding rings to Stanford."
Over the years, the tradition has grown
more common. According to the Novem
ber 1940 edition of the Stanford Alumni
Review, the c hurch had performed an av
erage of 47 weddings per year to date.
Thirteen years later, the May edition of the
Stanford Alumni Review reported that
weddings on campus were "in
creasing at a current rate of ap
proximately 80 each year." By
1979 the church was hosting 150
weddings a year.
Organizing the schedule of
ceremonies has become such a
large task that the church has a
full-time wedding coordinator.
Betty Koester, a Stanford alum
na, has been the wedding coordi
nator since 1984. She works close
ly with the couples from the time
they book the church to the wed
ding day. Bridget Dunnington,
married in the church in Septem
ber 1996, worked with Koester on
her wedding.
"She was very organized and
ran a tight clock . . . Everything
was right on schedule and per
fect," Dunnington said.
She still remembers the unique
and neat way that Koester
arranged the bridal party in semi
circles on each side of the altar,
rather than the traditional
straight lines."
Although Koester never imag
ined coming back to Stanford
after graduating, she certainly
does not regret her choice.
"It's a wonderful job . . . and
very satisfying," she commented.
"Almost every weekend, couples
come back to see the church and
thank me."
But this sacred structure is not
open for just anyone to enjoy.
There are strict restrictions on
who is allowed to take their vows
on campus.
In order to be married at Stan
ford, one member of the couple
must be a current student, alum
nus/ alumna, faculty member or
staff member of the University or
have a parent who is such an affil
iate. Koester estimates that
"about 50 percent of couples have
at least one graduate."
Although Bridget, daughter
of Stanford baseball coach Mark
Marquess, and Can Dunnington
met in school at Duke University,
Bridget wanted to get married in
Memorial Church because she
had spent so much time there as
a child. Because many of the
guests were from the East Coast,
Bridget thought the church was
"a great destination wedding.
My guests were blown away by
the campus and the California
landscape."
The whole scene was so beauti
ful that Bridget recalls being pho
tographed in the Quad following
her wedding by at least 50
tourists.
"I guess they just wanted a pic
ture of a wedding at this beautiful
place," she explained.
One of the most beautiful and
memorable parts of the ceremony
is the moment that the doors are
opened at the front of the church,
and the sunlight floods into the
dark structure as the bride begins

her walk down the isle.
"My husband still talks about
it," Dunnington said. In fact, the
sunlight is so bright that Koester
advises brides to wear an extra
slip under their dresses.
One bride admits, "1 didn't be
lieve her, and sure enough in the
wedding photos you can see the
outline of my legs perfectly."
After meeting at Stanford in
Britain (a former Stanford over
seas program), Mary and Phil
Bobel, both Class of '71, were
married Aug. 19, 1972. 1 heir
wedding party was composed
completely of classmates, and
they held the reception at the
Faculty Club. Although Mary
was Catholic and Phil was Epsi
copal, the commonality of the
location seemed to "minimize
the difference."
Mary described it as a "hybrid
wedding — we walked in to
organ music but also had a good
friend playing guitar and singing.
We were married by a Catholic
priest, but we wrote our own vows
and chose our own readings. We
had a Catholic and Christian mix
ture within the nondenomina
tional setting."
The. tradition of nondenomi
nationality dates back to the
founding of the church. Although
Leland and Jane Stanford put a
high value on morals and spiritu
ality, they were not committed to
any particular religion. Thus, the
church was decreed nondenomi
national and has hosted many dif
ferent religious groups including
Catholics, Christians, Sufis, Sikhs,
Mormons and Jews.
Today, the church welcomes
all religious wedding ceremonies
that are able to fit within their
hour allocation. The only restric
tion, Koester explained, is that
the couple must be "happy with
God language." The church will
not allow civil ceremonies.
Raga Ramachandran, Class of
'95 and her husband Joel Moore
held a Hindu / Protestant wed
ding ceremony.
"We selected key elements of
the Hindu ceremony, conducted
in Sanskrit, and a largely Episco
palian text for the Protestant cer
emony," Ramachandran said. "In
the end, we were very happy with
the ceremony itself and with its
significance to our families."
Although the restrictions on
who can get married in Memorial
Church are rigid, reserving the
church is not necessarily as hard
as one would guess, or as urban
myths might suggest. Koester as
sures the church's availability.
"If you are flexible, there is al
ways a date and time," she said.
Although there are rumors
about a wait list for weddings, no
such list exists. In fact, Koester
won't start booking weddings for
2004 until January of 2003.
Koester reports that the most
popular season is May through
September and that the most
popular ceremony times are 3
p.m. and 5 p.m.
On weekdays, Main Quad is filled with
students racing by on bikes, but the week
ends bring quite a different crowd. On al
most any Saturday of the year, tuxedos
outnumber t-shirts.
For almost a hundred years, couples
have taken their wedding vows at Stanford.
Memorial Church brings Stanford fami
lies and couples from all over the country to
celebrate their weddings in one of the Uni
versity's most beautiful structures. These
days, the church holds up to five weddings
each weekend: four on Saturday and one
on Sunday. In the past, it held even more.
The Stanford Observer reported that one
chaplain held nine separate ceremonies on
one June day in 1966.
Memorial (.hut ch only c loses its doors on
four pre-determined weekends of the year:
graduation, Easter, the first weekend in De
cember, and either Big Game weekend (if
it's at Stanford) or Christmas. Last year the
church held a total of 160 weddings.
Getting married in Memorial Church is
a long-standing tradition at Stanford. The

church was in the original plan for the Uni
versity but was not completed until 1903.
Jane Stanford worked with architects,
builders, artists and sculptors to design and
create the church as a memorial to Leland
Stanford, Sr., who died in 1893.
In its opening year, the church held
three weddings, the first of which took
place less than a month after the church's
dedication. On Feb. 22. 1903,•Ethel Rhodes
