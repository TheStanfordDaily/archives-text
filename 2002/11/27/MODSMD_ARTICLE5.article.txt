# University endowment shows negative return
## Administrators predict that struggling economy will have minimal effect on funding 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Amidst a flagging economy, the Stan
ford Merged Endowment Pool generated
a -2.6 percent return on investment for
tlie fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, ac
cording to a report to the Board of
Trustees. The entire endowment, of
which the MEP is a large part, is a major
source of the University's funding.
According to the report, the negative re
turn will have a minimal effect on the Uni
versity, due to a smoothing formula which
calculates endowment payout over several
years, mitigating the effects of short-term in
vestment returns.
"It has been an extremely difficult fi
nancial environment," said Michael G. Mc-
Caffery, president and CEO of the Stan
ford Management Company, the entity
that administers the University's endow
ment and investment real estate. "[lt was
the] worst period for the U.S. financial
market in 50 years."
The MEP's broad assortment of assets
ameliorated t he impact of the sluggish mar
ket on the University, placing Stanford in
the top quartile of college and university en
dowments, according to the consulting firm
Cambridge Associates.

"We have a very diversified mix of as
sets," McCafFery said. "The University's en
dowment has gone down very little relative
to the world's financial market."
Over the past 10 years, the MEP has
achieved an annual return of 14.6 percent,
glowing from $2.1 billion to $7.6 billion,
placing Stanford in the top 5 percent of all
college and university endowments over the
same period.
The MEP is Stanford's investment pool
for about 86 percent of the University's
total endowment and 50 percent of ex
pendable funds. The endowment enables
the University to pursue its teaching and
research endeavors.
The endowment includes assets that are
invested for the long term, as opposed to ex
pendable funds, which are typically used for
immediate needs. I he Founding Grant, the
University's original endowment, was estab
lished in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford.
To date, the University's endowment
includes in excess of 5,000 individual
funds, each one named and used in accor
dance with I he donor's wishes. At the end
of August 2001, the endowment value was
$8.25 billion.
Of the University's funds for the 2001 -02
fiscal year, 25 percent came from the en
dowment, 36 percent came from sponsored
research, 15 percent from student income,
8 percent from healthcare services income,
6 percent from expendable gifts and 10 per
cent from other sources.

Approximately 75 percent of
the endowment is designated and
used fora specific purpose, such as
scholarships or research. Each
year, a portion of the investment
return from the endowment is
used to support annual operating
expenses. The remainder of the re
turn is reinvested to maintain the
endowment's value over time.
"Although we are disappointed
to show negative performance
under any circumstances, we feel
our diversified portfolio structure
has demonstrated excellent rela
tive performance over the last 12
months," McCaffery said.
The projected spending from
the endowment in support of the
University's operating budget is
estimated to be $403.6 million for
the current fiscal year. This pay

out contribution represents 18.9
percent of the University's oper
ating budget.
As a result of the University's
smoothing formula, this year's
payout on individual MEP funds is
expected to increase 2.8 percent
over last year.
Speaking about the smoothing
formula, Odile Disch-Bhad
kamkar, the University's director
of finance and business develop
ment, said, "The effects of the
economy [will] hit you, but it's slow
on the pick-up and slow on the
come down."
"Other universities have a
smoothing formula like this," she
added.
In 2001, endowment values for
Harvard, Yale and Princeton were
$18.3 billion, $10.7 billion and $8.4
billion respectively. Harvard's en
dowment provides 30 percent of its
operating budget, Yale's provides
25 percent and Princeton's pro
vides 34 percent.
