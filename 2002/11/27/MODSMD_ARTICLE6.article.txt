### CORINA YEN 
Although many Stanford stu
dents will be staying on c ampus dur
ing the Thanksgiving holidays, they
need not spend their time alone.
Several clubs, organizations and
houses will be offering large
Thanksgiving dinners for the Stan
ford community.
The largest gathering on cam
pus will once again be the Thanks
giving dinner organized by the
Graduate Student Council along
with the ASSU. The dinner is now in
its fifth year. Around 1,400 mem
bers of the Stanford community are
expected to attend the dinner,
which has been popular and suc
cessful in the past.
Food will be offered buffet-style,
with a formal sit-down dinner that
will serve traditional Thanksgiving
fare — including turkey, mashed
potatoes, gravy and pumpkin
pie — as well as vegetarian options.
Bon Appetit will cater the dinner.
"We tiy to make it a really nice
and traditional I hanksgiving din
ner," said CSC member Ying
Wang, the event's coordinator.
"The real message is to enjoy the
holiday and know that Stanford is

really a community for all students.
Even if they are not home, we try to
give them some sense of belonging."
1,300 students attended the din
ner List year, growing from a few
hundred when the C iS( 1 first started
offering the dinner in 1998.
"Last year's Thanksgiving din
ner was really good; the food was
excellent," said sophomore
Jonathan Chen. "That's why I'm
going back this year."
While primarily attended by
graduate students, the event was ex
panded last year to include under
graduates, and this year is open to
all members of the Stanford com
munity, including faculty and staff.
The dinner is sponsored in part
by various schools, departments
and administrative offices, includ
ing deans from various schools,
Dining Services, and the Offices of
University President John Hen
nessy and Provost John
Etchemendy. This allows the din
ner to be open and free toeveiyone
in the Stanford community.
