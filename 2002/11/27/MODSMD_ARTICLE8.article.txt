# Student group addresses sexuality, gender issues
## 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most Stanford students probably don't
spend time thinking about what it means to be
"queer." However, an increasingly visible and
vocal queer community exists on campus, and
a new student-run group c alled Querillas seeks
to support it by increasing awareness about
gender, sexuality and racial issues through ac
tivism, discussion and bimonthly meetings.
Querillas' stated mission is "to create and
sustain queer activism and to mobilize, edu
cate and empower members of the Stanford
community. This is to effect fundamental,
long-lasting changes in ihe University's struc
ture to ensure a commitment to furthering
queer liberation."
Querillas borrowed its name from a group
of female artists called the Guerilla Girls who
protest the "maleness" and "whiteness" of the
ait world through "guerilla" tactics and art.
The group uses the word "queer" — which
has been used as a pejorative term for homo
sexuals — in an academic sense. "Queer" is an
identity category that was reclaimed partly as a
political tool, the way African-Americans re
claimed the word "black" as a political identity.
This perspective has been expressed by several
academics, including Annamarie Jagose, a fa
mous queer theorist.
"For me, 'queer' is a gender-neutral term
with which 1 identify that also includes my Na
tive American self-identification as being two
spirited in the context of a normative culture,"
said sophomore Marlon Footracer, president
of Querillas.
The group hopes to explore a wide range of

issues like queers of color, homophobia in com
munities of color at Stanford, transgender is
sues and diversity with respect to sexual orien
tation. Other interests range from domestic
partnership rights to the rape of gays in pris
ons. The group has several ideas for expanding
its collective voice, such as establishing a Queer
Studies Department at Stanford, building a
coalition among the broader community, and
connecting queer issues with other types of
campus activism.
"The purpose of our group, in my view, is to
raise the consciousness of how even the subtlest
labeling of gender as good or bad disallows for
safe and affirming spaces which should be a
priority of the University," Footracer said.
"Gender affects everone, queer or otherwise."
Querillas, now 60 students strong, started
last spring with only a handful of people and
has yet to secure school funding but is moving
forward in the application process. Coordina
tors include Footracer, senior Shin-Ming
Wong, and the group's founder, a student who
asked not to be named because it would jeop
ardize the founder's scholarship.
"Besides, I don't see myself as starting
[Querillas] as much as I was merely helping to
institutionalize a widespread and deeply felt
discontent with the state of'queer activism on
this campus," the group's founder said. "I felt
the discontent around me in my interaction
with other queer people."
In light of the recent murder of transgender
youth Gwen Araujo in Newark, the group's
founder said the group sees more significance
and urgency in its activities.
"It looks like we have a long way to go in
making people feel comfortable with others

who challenge their traditional notions of gen
der," the group's founder said.
Upcoming activities include a "guerilla" fly
eringcampaign where the group will post uni
sex flyers over the original male / female bath
room door signs on campus.
"The purpose of unisex bathrooms is to
both eliminate gender categories for people
who do not fall into the strict male-female bina
ry as well as to make the bathroom space safer
and more welcoming for genderqueer (a term
that relates to being neither 'sharply' male nor
'sharply' female) and trans folks," the group's
founder said.
Querillas is also working on a demonstra
tion next quarter against homophobic and sex
ist speech patterns that people use every clay
without considering their insensitivity towards,
queer people. Ihe group will broadcast a
string of homophobic yet commonly used
phrases in White Plaza. The voice will be me
chanical to symbolize how automatic these pat
terns are.
Some examples are "What's up? I'm
straight," "That's so gay," "Damn you faggot,"
and "What's up guys?"
Querillas organizers said that the group also
plans to hold queer sensitivity training work
shops for communities of color and is working
with the Stanford Coalition for Peace and Jus
tice to protest military recruiting on campus in
the spring because they believe the military dis
criminates on the basis of sexual orientation.
