# Genome Center seeks genetic basis of diseases
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The possibilities of determin
ing the genetic basis of Parkin
son's Disease, hypertension (high
blood pressure) or schizophrenia
could cause great changes in the
lives of many. With the efforts of
researchers at the Stanford
Human Genome Center — a 40-
person lab within the Medical
School that is involved in, among
other things, sequencing the
human genome — these changes
may soon be.forthcoming.
The major focus of the SHGC
has been on the sequencing of the
human genome — the basic
human genetic material — in col
laboration with the Joint Genome
Institute in Walnut Creek. To
gether the two labs have been
working on chromosomes five, six
and 19. The project has been
funded by the Department of En
ergy and the Stanford component
has been led by Dr. Jeremy
Schmutz, Dr. Jane Grimwood and
Dr. Mark Dickson. It is expected to
reach completion in April 2003.
According to Dr. Richard
Myers, director of the SHGC,
there are numerous motivations

behind this effort.
"The primary reason that it
pays off is [that] by finding all of
the genes and figuring out how
they ,work together, we under
stand biology a whole lot better,"
Myers said. "It also helps us un
derstand how to develop diag
noses and treatments. We're basi
cally getting the parts list. That has
not led to many drugs yet, but I
think ultimately it will."
In particular, the sequencing
project has revealed some of the
genes implicated in increasing
chances of Alzheimer's disease,
cancer and other issues, such as
longevity. However, this does not
mean that genes are solely respon
sible for those traits.
"Very few things are purely ge
netic," Myers said.
Other projects run under the
SHGC include the genetics pro
ject, led by Dr. Holly Tabor, and a
project on brain disease led by Dr.
Jim Li. The genetics project aims
to determine some of the genes in
volved in complex diseases —
those with multiple genetic and
environmental causes. Specifical
ly, the project is studying hyper
tension and insulin resistance in
Asians and Pacific Islanders, as
well as atherosclerosis and Parkin
son's disease in die general popu
lation, by searching through DNA
samples for genes that may be in
volved in such disease. Then statis
tical analysis is used to find spec ific
portions of DNA that correlate
with the appearance of the disease.
"No one gene and no one varia
tion explains all ofa disease," Tabor
said. "If that were true, we would
have found it using other clues.
What we're really hoping to do is

find more pieces of the puzzle."
Eventually these studies could
reveal more of the risk lac tors be
hind these diseases. I bis would
then allow doctors to advise people
who have those risk factors on how
to modify their health and behav
ior to counter that risk.
The brain disease project in
volves analyzing gene expression
linked to depression, bipolar disor
der and schizophrenia. The prob
lem is approached through analyz
ing the amount of mRNA — a sub
stance that assists in c reating amino
acids from the genetic instructions
of DNA — to see which genes are
more active in patients with those
psychiatric diseases.
"[Eventually] we can trace back

to the original genetic cause, it'll a
lot about what is ultimately patho
logical in this brain," Li said. "We
t an then go ahead and look at ani
mal models of neurological disor
ders and give animals psychoactive
drugs to see what can compensate
lor what is missing."
I'here are some ethical issues
raised by all of this research. While
Myers dismisses lears of genetic
engineering, he does recognize
other problems.
"I'm worried about people mis
using [genetics research] by dis
criminating on the basis of genetic
information," lie said. "Your ge
netic information is yours, and not
your insurance company's."
Another issue concerns the

question of whether a person real
ly should know il he or she has
greater chances of various dis
eases, especially il there are few ef
fective treatments.
"I could sequence my genome
right now and find out il I have a
gene that increases my chances 15-
fold of early-onset Alzheimer's dis
ease, but I don't want to know it be
cause there's nothing I can do
about it," Myers said.
Despite the concerns, the goals
of saving lives and increasing
knowledge drive research forward.
"Ultimately, 1 think everyone
who works in biological sciences
would like to see reduced dis
ease, morbidity and mortality,"
labor said.

"I'm worried about people mis

your insurance company's."
Another issue concerns the

question of whether a person real

greater chances of various dis

"I could sequence my genome
right now and find out il I have a
gene that increases my chances 15-
fold of early-onset Alzheimer's dis
ease, but I don't want to know it be
cause there's nothing I can do
about it," Myers said.

of saving lives and increasing

The possibilities of determin
ing the genetic basis of Parkin
son's Disease, hypertension (high
blood pressure) or schizophrenia
could cause great changes in the
lives of many. With the efforts of
researchers at the Stanford
Human Genome Center — a 40-
person lab within the Medical
School that is involved in, among
other things, sequencing the
human genome — these changes
may soon be.forthcoming.
The major focus of the SHGC
has been on the sequencing of the
human genome — the basic
human genetic material — in col
laboration with the Joint Genome
Institute in Walnut Creek. To
gether the two labs have been
working on chromosomes five, six
and 19. The project has been
funded by the Department of En
ergy and the Stanford component
has been led by Dr. Jeremy
Schmutz, Dr. Jane Grimwood and
Dr. Mark Dickson. It is expected to
reach completion in April 2003.
According to Dr. Richard
Myers, director of the SHGC,
there are numerous motivations

behind this effort.
"The primary reason that it
pays off is [that] by finding all of
the genes and figuring out how
they ,work together, we under
stand biology a whole lot better,"
Myers said. "It also helps us un
derstand how to develop diag
noses and treatments. We're basi
cally getting the parts list. That has
not led to many drugs yet, but I
think ultimately it will."
In particular, the sequencing
project has revealed some of the
genes implicated in increasing
chances of Alzheimer's disease,
cancer and other issues, such as
longevity. However, this does not
mean that genes are solely respon
sible for those traits.
"Very few things are purely ge
netic," Myers said.
Other projects run under the
SHGC include the genetics pro
ject, led by Dr. Holly Tabor, and a
project on brain disease led by Dr.
Jim Li. The genetics project aims
to determine some of the genes in
volved in complex diseases —
those with multiple genetic and
environmental causes. Specifical
ly, the project is studying hyper
tension and insulin resistance in
Asians and Pacific Islanders, as
well as atherosclerosis and Parkin
son's disease in die general popu
lation, by searching through DNA
samples for genes that may be in
volved in such disease. Then statis
tical analysis is used to find spec ific
portions of DNA that correlate
with the appearance of the disease.
"No one gene and no one varia
tion explains all ofa disease," Tabor
said. "If that were true, we would
have found it using other clues.
What we're really hoping to do is

find more pieces of the puzzle."
Eventually these studies could
reveal more of the risk lac tors be
hind these diseases. I bis would
then allow doctors to advise people
who have those risk factors on how
to modify their health and behav
ior to counter that risk.
The brain disease project in
volves analyzing gene expression
linked to depression, bipolar disor
der and schizophrenia. The prob
lem is approached through analyz
ing the amount of mRNA — a sub
stance that assists in c reating amino
acids from the genetic instructions
of DNA — to see which genes are
more active in patients with those
psychiatric diseases.
"[Eventually] we can trace back

to the original genetic cause, it'll a
lot about what is ultimately patho
logical in this brain," Li said. "We
t an then go ahead and look at ani
mal models of neurological disor
ders and give animals psychoactive
drugs to see what can compensate
lor what is missing."
