# Genome Center seeks genetic basis of diseases

The possibilities of determin
ing the genetic basis of Parkin
son's Disease, hypertension (high
blood pressure) or schizophrenia
could cause great changes in the
lives of many. With the efforts of
researchers at the Stanford
Human Genome Center — a 40-
person lab within the Medical
School that is involved in, among
other things, sequencing the
human genome — these changes
may soon be.forthcoming.
The major focus of the SHGC
has been on the sequencing of the
human genome — the basic
human genetic material — in col
laboration with the Joint Genome
Institute in Walnut Creek. To
gether the two labs have been
working on chromosomes five, six
and 19. The project has been
funded by the Department of En
ergy and the Stanford component
has been led by Dr. Jeremy
Schmutz, Dr. Jane Grimwood and
Dr. Mark Dickson. It is expected to
reach completion in April 2003.
According to Dr. Richard
Myers, director of the SHGC,
there are numerous motivations

behind this effort.
"The primary reason that it
pays off is [that] by finding all of
the genes and figuring out how
they ,work together, we under
stand biology a whole lot better,"
Myers said. "It also helps us un
derstand how to develop diag
noses and treatments. We're basi
cally getting the parts list. That has
not led to many drugs yet, but I
think ultimately it will."
In particular, the sequencing
project has revealed some of the
genes implicated in increasing
chances of Alzheimer's disease,
cancer and other issues, such as
longevity. However, this does not
mean that genes are solely respon
sible for those traits.
"Very few things are purely ge
netic," Myers said.
Other projects run under the
SHGC include the genetics pro
ject, led by Dr. Holly Tabor, and a
project on brain disease led by Dr.
Jim Li. The genetics project aims
to determine some of the genes in
volved in complex diseases —
those with multiple genetic and
environmental causes. Specifical
ly, the project is studying hyper
