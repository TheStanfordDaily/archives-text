WINTHROP EARLY PICK IN POLLS
•\<\ UCLA
'/w ' ''
f
Sweet Sixteen. Elite Eight. Final Four. And now the Talented
Twenty-Five. Will Kansas be at the center of this year's brack
et? Will the girl in the mail room pick the NCAA champion?
Read on for everything you ever wanted to know (but were
afraid to ask) about college basketball.
1 WINTHROP
Okay, so they went 19-12 last year. And they are from the Big South
Conference. But trust us, the Eagles can definitely hoop. Besides, these
guys are made up of 4,500 polygons, just like any other team.
2 ARIZONA
mm
0 PITTSBURGH
Look for what could be the most
exciting duo in college basket
ball to rate high in the on-screen
player ratings.
HP

What's the 411 on the 'Cats? Not
only do they have all five of their
starters returning, but they also
have what most consider to be the
best frontcourt in college basket
ball. Can you say Dynasty Mode?
7 DUKE
Add the slick job done in
recruiting to the usual Blue Devil
talent pool, and you get a team
that is bound to make some
noise. Get ready to hear Billy
Packer and Eddie Doucette say
ing, "And the Blue Devils win
again," a lot this season.
Q GEORGIA
The Dawgs' poll position could
change in October, depending
on their frontcourt production.
If they produce, prepare for this
team to move a little higher in
the polls.
Q KENTUCKY
— Jm'
3 KANSAS
Despite losing a key player to
the NBA, look for the Jayhawks
to return to the Final Four this
year. We've seen what they have
been doing in Practice Mode,
and, trust us, we are thoroughly
convinced.
/L OKLAHOMA
Another team we predict to be
returning to the Final Four in
2003. Not only do they return
with 70 new player models, they
look good doing it, too.
Should come down to the wire
between them and Georgia for
the SEC crown. Use the over 30
new dunks (including reverses,
follow-ups and 360-degree
jams) and this Wildcat team
might overtake that other
Wildcat team.
No, it's not the 1970s Bruins, but
this team ain't bad, either.
Besides, the digital cheerleaders
are really easy on the eyes.
Definitely easy on the eyes.
■iO MICHIGAN
STATE
This year their most famous
alumnus will make it into the
NBA Hall of Fame. That just
might spark the Spartans to play
at an elevated level.
13 XAVIER
"Who?" That's right, Xavier. Get
used to seeing this school in the
polls. The Musketeers are clearly
the class of the A-10. How does
a team go from unranked to
number 13? Practice Mode,
Practice Mode, Practice Mode.
14 ALABAMA
With the return of some key
players, the Tide possesses one
of the best inside-outside
combos in the league. If you are
attending a Tuscaloosa fish fry
this year, expect to see some
happy basketball fans.
15 MISS. STATE
The Bulldogs, coming off a
Southeastern Conference tour
nament championship, have a
tough schedule, playing both
Xavier and Oklahoma this year.
Said one player, "Hey, I'm all for
just selecting Tournament Mode,
and just get right to the tourney."
16 OREGON
Enjoying its first league champi
onship in 63 years and one of
the last eight teams standing in
last year's tourney, Oregon's
picked second by us in the Pac
10, behind No. 1 Arizona. Expect
a long stay in the NCAA tourna
ment this year for the Ducks.
17 VILLANOVA
19 UCONN
Expect the Huskies again to be
strong in the backcoilrt. Use the
right analog stick control to
perform spin moves and drop
steps out of the post to put the
solid backcourt to good use.
20 MARQUETTE
The Golden Eagles open against
Villanova, marking the first time
the two teams have met since the
1980 NCAA tournament. Can
this young team hold its own in
an upcoming Conference USA?
We think so.
21 INDIANA
Can they get the support they
need inside? If not, the Hoosiers
could be off-balance even with
what should be an extremely
productive perimeter.
GONZAGA
Can the Bulldogs get the
top scorer they need to emerge?
Time spent in recruiting will be
time well spent. Everything else
is in place for another banner
season on the left coast.
MARYLAND

We're considering these champs
an outside shot at defending
the tide after losing four starters.
Terps get a new arena this year.
Unfortunately, they are also
getting a mostly new team, as well.

MISSOURI
Mizzou's run to the Elite Eight
last year was the Tigers' longest
stint in the tourney in eight years.
And this should be another
promising year.

How about that SEC? Yet another
entry from a very tough confer
ence. Tough conference or not,
the Gators hold their own against
some of the NCAA's best.

Ihey say everything is bigger in
Texas, but what we notice on this
team are the little guys. The back
court is the cream of the crop.
End of discussion. Obviously,
somebody did their homework
before this year's recruiting.
