Bertrand M. Patenaude, author of
The Big Show In Bololand: The American Relief
Expedition To Soviet Russia In The Famine Of 1921
"This is a highly original and important work on a fascinating episode in American-Russian relations that has had little attention, either in America or in Russia. Patenaude
has presented it brilliantly. What impresses one most about this work is the skill and imagination with which the author has captured so many dimensions of the American
famine relief effort, and of a tragic period in Russian history. The literary style is outstanding, with vivid descriptions of events, people, and landscapes." - Herbert J. Ellison,
Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington

never to return to Munich. German col leagues persuaded her to present her research findings there. While in Munich, she was in a fog, reliving childhood and the Nazi

Taken in Faith: Poems by Helen Pinkerton
Though Helen Pinkerton's work has won the attention and praise of serious readers, who tracked her poems as they appeared in such journals as the Paris Review, the
Sewanee Review, and the Southern Review, this is the first trade edition of her collected poems. Writing on themes that have historically been the subject of poetry - the
individual's relationship to God, love and its costs, friendship, the beauty of works of art, death, and war and politics - Pinkerton brings a rare depth and seriousness to
issues of human struggle and conduct. More recent poems exhibit a stylistic as well as a thematic shift, moving away from the rhymed forms of her devotional works into
a blank verse marked by a quiet flexibility and contemplative grace.
