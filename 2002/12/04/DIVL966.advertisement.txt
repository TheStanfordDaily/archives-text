"The challenges we face over this time are commensurate with some threats that are almost
incomprehensible to the average citizen. We are faced with altering forever the fundamental
relationship between human beings and the natural world. We, as a people, are ill
prepared to even contemplate the enormity of what we are about to do." - Perschel
