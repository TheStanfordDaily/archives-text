NO WAR FOR OIL!
Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called children of CJod."(Mt 5:9)
The Catholic church, along with every
other major faith tradition and nearly
every country in the world, rejects US
military action against Iraq. Such a war
would inevitably kill, injure and trauma
tize numerous innocent men, women
and children and only destabilize the
Middle East even further. Should Ameri
can soldiers and innocent civilians die
for what many in Congress are calling a
war for oil and political expediency?
