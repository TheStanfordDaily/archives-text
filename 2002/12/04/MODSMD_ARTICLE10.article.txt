# Faculty debate Homeland Security Act
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Having cleared the U.S. Senate by a 90-to-9
margin, the Homeland Security Act became
law after President George \V. Bush signed the
bill on Nov. 25, marking the biggest reorgani
zation in the federal government since the cre
ation of the Department of Defense in 1947.
Stanford professors are divided over the
wisdom of the act. Some feel the creation of a
new Homeland Security Department will
streamline the nation's security agencies and
bolster the fight against terrorism, while others
contend that it is merely a symbolic move that
will have little impact.
"These are fairly new and difficult.. . some
times life and death circumstances," said Terry
Moe, professor of political science. "We need to
have a Homeland Security Department."
The department was proposed after the
Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks, which exposed se
curity lapses and intelligence failures and
led to calls for sweeping changes to the
U.S.'s defense, intelligence and law enforce
ment sectors.
The new cabinet-level department will ab
sorb 22 existing federal agencies with com
bined budgets of about $40 billion a year and
almost 170,000 employees.

According to UCLA Prof, of Policy Studies
Amy Zegart, the department will bring togeth
er a number of border patrol agencies. This
marks a significant achievement for the intelli
gence community, which has never functioned
effectively as a whole, she said.
"[The department] is absolutely a step in the
right direction," she said. "Homeland security
is spread across a dozen agencies."
According to Abraham D. Sofaer, professor
of law and Hoover Institution senior fellow,
"The one benefit of consolidation would be the
elimination of useless people, of which some of
the agencies have many, especially INS."
However, Sofaer added that he is unsure the
new department will solve the problems of the
status quo.
"I am not at all sure that the consolidation of
the agencies will enhance security," he said.
The Department will have several impor
tant functions. It will coordinate intelligence
gathering, research new ways to protect Amer
icans from the effects of biological and chemical
weapons, enhance border security and bolster
emergency preparedness.
"[The department] makes sharing of infor
mation easier among agencies," said Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg.
According to Sofaer, the department's effi
cacy will derive from the update of technolo

gies in use to gather information.
"The new agency may lead to new securi
ty measures, but that is because it puts much
more emphasis on improved technologies,"
he said.
Despite its strengths, other professors claim
that the new department does have its weak
nesses, among which is the fact that it does not
have control over any of the agencies' budgets.
For example, the director of the CIA does not
control the budget of other intelligence gather
ing agencies, making it difficult for agencies to
collaborate.
"The director of the CIA has two hats," Ze
gart said. "Director of the CIA and director
of central intelligence â€” he can't do [the sec
ond] because he doesn't have control over
the budget."
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has
control of 85 percent of the intelligence com
munity's budget.
Critics of the department argue that its
functioning will result in severe setbacks to in
dividual civil liberties, including First Amend
ment rights.
"This is going to give the government in
creased powers to suppress dissent within the
U. 5.," said Mandeep S. Gill, a physics doctoral
student. "Whenever our civil liber
ties are restricted, the government
generally uses them to crack down
on free speech by groups and peo
ple that don't like what the gov
ernment is doing."
Proponents of the department
suggest that the U.S. system of
checks and balances lias measures
to prevent infringements on First
Amendment rights.
"Wecan say with real confidence
that [the United States] will not turn
into a police state," Moe said.
"Most people see security and
civil liberties as a tradeoff," Zegart
said. "How can we get the maxi
mum gain in security with the
minimum loss in rights?"
She added, "A much bigger
threat is that we will not be able to
get all of the information we
need."
In its current slate, the govern
ment does not have the surveil
lance capabilities that critics be
lieve will lead to violations of free
dom of speech. According to Weis

berg, however, future congres
sional measures may augment the
de| >art rnent's capabilities.
The newly established depart
ment will be difficult to disband il
future politicians feel that it has
surpassed its usefulness.
"It is much easier to block
something in the first place," Weis
berg said. "This would be hard to
undo."
Zegart added, "Rule number
one in bureaucracy is agencies are
really hard to kill |ancl] organiza
tional change is exceptionally diffi
cult."
Of concern to faculty and ad
ministrators are the effects the new
department will have on the Uni
versity and the rest of the academ
ic community.
" The University will be impact
ed in that our foreign students will
have a lot more trouble getting
here and will have to stay in closer
contact with the INS," Sofaer said.
A large portion of the depart
ment will take shape March 1,
when the Secret Service, INS and
a few other agencies transfer their
employees and budgets to the new
entity. The final pieces will be put
in place Sept. 30, 2003.
