# Fisk criticizes U.S. media in interview
## British journalist discusses views on War on Terrorism 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Nov. 21, Robert Fisk,
Britain's most highly decorated
foreign correspondent, addressed

the Stanford community in a talk
entitled "War and Peace."
During his speech, Fisk, the
longest-serving Western journal
ist in the Middle East, drew from
his personal experiences in
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and the
Middle East to argue that West
erners get a tainted picture of cur
rent events when they receive
their news.
Currently the Middle East cor

respondent for London's Inde
pendent, Fisk has covered some of
the most significant stories in the
Middle East and South Asia for the
past 25 years, including the U.S.-
led war in Afghanistan last year.
Fisk is also one of the few Western
journalists to have interviewed
Osama bin Laden.
For about 20 minutes before
his Nov. 21 talk, Fisk sat down
with The Daily to discuss his
views on American journalists'
coverage of the Middle East, the
role of universities in changing
U.S. foreign policies, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and the War
on Terrorism.
The Daily: How do you think
your coverage of the Middle East
is different from how American
journalists cover the region?
Robert Fisk: I try to tell the real
ity of the Middle East in a wa)|
that American newspapers and
television don't. I'm even getting
to a point where I don't think
you can call American newspa
pers and television mainstream .
... I think they are becoming al
ternative in the sense that they're
not giving you a full picture.
[They are reporting the Middle
East] in a spineless, biased [and]
cowardly way.
[European journalists like my
self give] a more three-dimension
al look at the Middle East, in which
we are not afraid to criticize Israel.

We're not afraid to criticize the
Arabs, but we're certainly not
afraid to criticize Israel .... The
American press have become so
compliant in their reporting in the
Middle East and have fallen into
line with the reporting style which
avoids any serious criticism of one
side, Israel.
TD: Why do you believe
American journalists have this
bias when reporting on the
Middle East?
RF: Journalists in America like
being very close to power. They
[cozy] up to people in the admin
istration, the politicians. There is
a very unhealthy osmotic, incestu
ous relationship between journal
ists and power. You just look at a
press conference given by Con
doleezza Rice or George Bush:
"Barb, your turn to ask a ques
tion. Thank you very much, but I
dbn't want to get into that right
now. John." It's all first-name
terms, right?
American correspondents often
arrive for the first time in a foreign
country, and what do they do?
They go to the U.S. Embassy fora
briefing. There is this feeling that
[questioning] U.S. foreign policy is
somehow subversive at a time of
crisis. Where, in fact, at a time of
crisis is the one time you must
question and challenge your own

that he said many Westerners do not see. Fisk, a foreign correspondent for
the Independent, is the longest-serving Western journalist in the Middle East.
government's statements. You
have a duty to the public.
1 think also there is no doubt
that the pro-Israeli lobby in
America has a very powerful
voice. They are able to attack edi
tors and reporters in print and by
going to the editors and saying,
"Look, this is anti-Semitic." It's a
great phrase, over and over again
any criticism of Israel is accused
of being anti-Semitic. It's dis
graceful, a slanderous, disgusting
lie directed at innocent people,
and it has to be stood up to. But in
America, I fear that because jour
nalists don't want to get into con
troversies . . . they don't want to
be accused of being anti-Semitic,
they fall into the habit of writing
in such a way that they don't of
fend anybody.
So, for example, you find that
"occupied territories" is referred to
as "disputed territories," "settle
ments" are referred to as "neigh
borhoods," and slowly but surely,
the language is drained of its mean
ing, and the crisis that actually oc
curs is decontextualized; for exam
ple, if you can't call the occupied
territories "occupied," how can you
explain why Palestinians would
wish to resist an occupation?
TD: How do you think the Ameri
can media have covered the po
tential war in Iraq?
RE: The coverage of Iraq has been
supine and pathetic in the Ameri
can press and television. Basically,
Americans are not being told the
realities of the situation. For exam
ple, we're told constantly by
George Bush and Donald Rums
feld that this [potential war] is part
ly about human rights. "Saddam
has used gas against his own peo
ple. He's used gas against the Ira
nians. There are human rights
abuses. There are torture cham
bers ..."

It's all true, bin it was just as bad
in l ( .)8!i. Saddam started using gas
against the Iranian army in 1983.
When he was doing that, President
Reagan decided to reopen the
American Embassy in Baghdad.
And the man he sent to reopen the
American Embassy was Donald
Rumsfeld. So Donald Rumsfeld
was shaking hands with Saddam
when Saddam was using gas, but
now expresses his horror that Sad
dam is using gas. So why did he
shake hands with him? Why did he
reopen die American Embassy?
So what the question is, what is
all this nonsense about human
rights? We didn't care about it
then. Suddenly we're supposed to
care about it now as an excuse to go
to war.
TD: What role do you believe uni
versities like Stanford can play in
changing U.S. foreign policies?
RK: In other universities, I've no
ticed that they have these meetings
with what they call "activists and
academics." Ii often seems to me in
the United States ... instead of ac
tually talking to the people that
seem to be involved in such a war
(like ilie potential war against
Iraq), academics and students all
talk to each other.
You area very privileged group
of people at Stanford. You are not
going to go to the war. You are not
going to light in Iraq. The people
who are going to have their fami
lies go to Iraq are... truck drivers;
they are guys who work on the rail
road trains; they are people who
are bellhops in hotels. But you
don't talk to them... it seems to me
that to try and have an open dis
cussion about the [policies] of the
Middle East and Iraq, you need to
consider talking to the people who
will be most intimately involved in
such a tragedy of an Iraqi military
campaign.
TD: How do you think the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict can be
resolved?
RK: You need to get Sharon out of

the West Bank, but you also need
to slop suicide bombings ... It
needs an evenhanded United
States policy toward the Middle
East, and, at the moment, you're
not going to get that, not with the
Bush administration. America is
becoming more and more hated in
the Middle East because of its total
hi,is toward one side and one side
only, its unconditional support for
Israel. By all means support Israel,
but not unconditionally.
Let's have some support for
people's aspirations in the Arab
world and not just for tin-pot dic
tators who we employ to do our
work for us. Remember Saddam
used to be one of them. We've still
got King Abdullah of Jordan,
[Hosni] Mubarak of Egypt, so on
and so forth.
TD: What do you believe is the
best way the U.S. can achieve
security regarding its War on
Terrorism?
RF: If America's relationship with
the Middle East were based on
peace and justice for all peoples of
the Middle East, if America can act
on the interests of the people of
those regions... it could recapture
its warmth which all the people of
the region felt toward America
after the First World War and in
deed after the Second World War.
America was not always hated in
the Middle East.
It was only in the second half of
the last century, particularly, but
not only, because of its uncondi
tional support for Israel that
America's relationship with the
Arab Muslim world began to dete
riorate. And its continued actions
against countries like Iraq have
embittered many Arab Muslims. If
you can deal fairly with a group of
another people, whether it be your
next door neighbor or a country
on the other side of the world, you
will not need to feel endangered.
Your security will not be your first
concern. Your first concern will be
how you will be able to improve
your relations even more.

as "disputed territories," "settle
ments" are referred to as "neigh
borhoods," and slowly but surely,
the language is drained of its mean
ing, and the crisis that actually oc
curs is decontextualized; for exam
ple, if you can't call the occupied
territories "occupied," how can you
explain why Palestinians would
wish to resist an occupation?
TD: How do you think the Ameri
can media have covered the po
tential war in Iraq?
RE: The coverage of Iraq has been
supine and pathetic in the Ameri
can press and television. Basically,
Americans are not being told the
realities of the situation. For exam
ple, we're told constantly by
George Bush and Donald Rums
feld that this [potential war] is part
ly about human rights. "Saddam
has used gas against his own peo
ple. He's used gas against the Ira
nians. There are human rights
abuses. There are torture cham
bers ..."

It's all true, bin it was just as bad
in l ( .)8!i. Saddam started using gas
against the Iranian army in 1983.
When he was doing that, President
Reagan decided to reopen the
American Embassy in Baghdad.
And the man he sent to reopen the
American Embassy was Donald
Rumsfeld. So Donald Rumsfeld
was shaking hands with Saddam
when Saddam was using gas, but
now expresses his horror that Sad
dam is using gas. So why did he
shake hands with him? Why did he
reopen die American Embassy?
So what the question is, what is
all this nonsense about human
rights? We didn't care about it
then. Suddenly we're supposed to
care about it now as an excuse to go
to war.
TD: What role do you believe uni
versities like Stanford can play in
changing U.S. foreign policies?
RK: In other universities, I've no
ticed that they have these meetings
with what they call "activists and
academics." Ii often seems to me in
the United States ... instead of ac
tually talking to the people that
seem to be involved in such a war
(like ilie potential war against
Iraq), academics and students all
talk to each other.
You area very privileged group
of people at Stanford. You are not
going to go to the war. You are not
going to light in Iraq. The people
who are going to have their fami
lies go to Iraq are... truck drivers;
they are guys who work on the rail
road trains; they are people who
are bellhops in hotels. But you
don't talk to them... it seems to me
that to try and have an open dis
cussion about the [policies] of the
Middle East and Iraq, you need to
consider talking to the people who
will be most intimately involved in
such a tragedy of an Iraqi military
campaign.
TD: How do you think the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict can be
resolved?
RK: You need to get Sharon out of

the West Bank, but you also need
to slop suicide bombings ... It
needs an evenhanded United
States policy toward the Middle
East, and, at the moment, you're
not going to get that, not with the
Bush administration. America is
becoming more and more hated in
the Middle East because of its total
hi,is toward one side and one side
only, its unconditional support for
Israel. By all means support Israel,
but not unconditionally.
Let's have some support for
people's aspirations in the Arab
world and not just for tin-pot dic
tators who we employ to do our
work for us. Remember Saddam
used to be one of them. We've still
got King Abdullah of Jordan,
[Hosni] Mubarak of Egypt, so on
and so forth.
TD: What do you believe is the
best way the U.S. can achieve
security regarding its War on
Terrorism?
RF: If America's relationship with
the Middle East were based on
peace and justice for all peoples of
the Middle East, if America can act
on the interests of the people of
those regions... it could recapture
its warmth which all the people of
the region felt toward America
after the First World War and in
deed after the Second World War.
America was not always hated in
the Middle East.
It was only in the second half of
the last century, particularly, but
not only, because of its uncondi
tional support for Israel that
America's relationship with the
Arab Muslim world began to dete
riorate. And its continued actions
against countries like Iraq have
embittered many Arab Muslims. If
you can deal fairly with a group of
another people, whether it be your
next door neighbor or a country
on the other side of the world, you
will not need to feel endangered.
Your security will not be your first
concern. Your first concern will be
how you will be able to improve
your relations even more.
On Nov. 21, Robert Fisk,
Britain's most highly decorated
foreign correspondent, addressed

the Stanford community in a talk
entitled "War and Peace."
During his speech, Fisk, the
longest-serving Western journal
ist in the Middle East, drew from
his personal experiences in
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and the
Middle East to argue that West
erners get a tainted picture of cur
rent events when they receive
their news.
Currently the Middle East cor

respondent for London's Inde
pendent, Fisk has covered some of
the most significant stories in the
Middle East and South Asia for the
past 25 years, including the U.S.-
led war in Afghanistan last year.
Fisk is also one of the few Western
journalists to have interviewed
Osama bin Laden.
For about 20 minutes before
his Nov. 21 talk, Fisk sat down
with The Daily to discuss his
views on American journalists'
coverage of the Middle East, the
role of universities in changing
U.S. foreign policies, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and the War
on Terrorism.
The Daily: How do you think
your coverage of the Middle East
is different from how American
journalists cover the region?
Robert Fisk: I try to tell the real
ity of the Middle East in a wa)|
that American newspapers and
television don't. I'm even getting
to a point where I don't think
you can call American newspa
pers and television mainstream .
... I think they are becoming al
ternative in the sense that they're
not giving you a full picture.
[They are reporting the Middle
East] in a spineless, biased [and]
cowardly way.
[European journalists like my
self give] a more three-dimension
al look at the Middle East, in which
we are not afraid to criticize Israel.

We're not afraid to criticize the
Arabs, but we're certainly not
afraid to criticize Israel .... The
American press have become so
compliant in their reporting in the
Middle East and have fallen into
line with the reporting style which
avoids any serious criticism of one
side, Israel.
TD: Why do you believe
American journalists have this
bias when reporting on the
Middle East?
RF: Journalists in America like
being very close to power. They
[cozy] up to people in the admin
istration, the politicians. There is
a very unhealthy osmotic, incestu
ous relationship between journal
ists and power. You just look at a
press conference given by Con
doleezza Rice or George Bush:
"Barb, your turn to ask a ques
tion. Thank you very much, but I
dbn't want to get into that right
now. John." It's all first-name
terms, right?
American correspondents often
arrive for the first time in a foreign
country, and what do they do?
They go to the U.S. Embassy fora
briefing. There is this feeling that
[questioning] U.S. foreign policy is
somehow subversive at a time of
crisis. Where, in fact, at a time of
crisis is the one time you must
question and challenge your own

government's statements. You
have a duty to the public.
1 think also there is no doubt
that the pro-Israeli lobby in
America has a very powerful
voice. They are able to attack edi
tors and reporters in print and by
going to the editors and saying,
"Look, this is anti-Semitic." It's a
great phrase, over and over again
any criticism of Israel is accused
of being anti-Semitic. It's dis
graceful, a slanderous, disgusting
lie directed at innocent people,
and it has to be stood up to. But in
America, I fear that because jour
nalists don't want to get into con
troversies . . . they don't want to
be accused of being anti-Semitic,
they fall into the habit of writing
in such a way that they don't of

not only, because of its uncondi
tional support for Israel that
America's relationship with the
Arab Muslim world began to dete
riorate. And its continued actions
against countries like Iraq have
embittered many Arab Muslims. If
you can deal fairly with a group of
another people, whether it be your
next door neighbor or a country
on the other side of the world, you
will not need to feel endangered.
Your security will not be your first
concern. Your first concern will be
how you will be able to improve
your relations even more.
On Nov. 21, Robert Fisk,
Britain's most highly decorated
foreign correspondent, addressed

the Stanford community in a talk
entitled "War and Peace."
During his speech, Fisk, the
longest-serving Western journal
ist in the Middle East, drew from
his personal experiences in
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and the
Middle East to argue that West
erners get a tainted picture of cur
rent events when they receive
their news.
Currently the Middle East cor

respondent for London's Inde
pendent, Fisk has covered some of
the most significant stories in the
Middle East and South Asia for the
past 25 years, including the U.S.-
led war in Afghanistan last year.
Fisk is also one of the few Western
journalists to have interviewed
Osama bin Laden.
For about 20 minutes before
his Nov. 21 talk, Fisk sat down
with The Daily to discuss his
views on American journalists'
coverage of the Middle East, the
role of universities in changing
U.S. foreign policies, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and the War
on Terrorism.
The Daily: How do you think
your coverage of the Middle East
is different from how American
journalists cover the region?
Robert Fisk: I try to tell the real
ity of the Middle East in a wa)|
that American newspapers and
television don't. I'm even getting
to a point where I don't think
you can call American newspa
pers and television mainstream .
... I think they are becoming al
ternative in the sense that they're
not giving you a full picture.
[They are reporting the Middle
East] in a spineless, biased [and]
cowardly way.
[European journalists like my
self give] a more three-dimension
al look at the Middle East, in which
we are not afraid to criticize Israel.

We're not afraid to criticize the
Arabs, but we're certainly not
afraid to criticize Israel .... The
American press have become so
compliant in their reporting in the
Middle East and have fallen into
line with the reporting style which
avoids any serious criticism of one
side, Israel.
TD: Why do you believe
American journalists have this
bias when reporting on the
Middle East?
RF: Journalists in America like
being very close to power. They
[cozy] up to people in the admin
istration, the politicians. There is
a very unhealthy osmotic, incestu
ous relationship between journal
ists and power. You just look at a
press conference given by Con
doleezza Rice or George Bush:
"Barb, your turn to ask a ques
tion. Thank you very much, but I
dbn't want to get into that right
now. John." It's all first-name
terms, right?
American correspondents often
arrive for the first time in a foreign
country, and what do they do?
They go to the U.S. Embassy fora
briefing. There is this feeling that
[questioning] U.S. foreign policy is
somehow subversive at a time of
crisis. Where, in fact, at a time of
crisis is the one time you must
question and challenge your own


ERICA HEIMAN/The Stanford Daily
British journalist Robert Fisk spoke Nov. 21 on the reality in the Middle East
that he said many Westerners do not see. Fisk, a foreign correspondent for
the Independent, is the longest-serving Western journalist in the Middle East.
government's statements. You
have a duty to the public.
1 think also there is no doubt
that the pro-Israeli lobby in
America has a very powerful
voice. They are able to attack edi
tors and reporters in print and by
going to the editors and saying,
"Look, this is anti-Semitic." It's a
great phrase, over and over again
any criticism of Israel is accused
of being anti-Semitic. It's dis
graceful, a slanderous, disgusting
lie directed at innocent people,
and it has to be stood up to. But in
America, I fear that because jour
nalists don't want to get into con
troversies . . . they don't want to
be accused of being anti-Semitic,
they fall into the habit of writing
in such a way that they don't of
fend anybody.
So, for example, you find that
"occupied territories" is referred to
as "disputed territories," "settle
ments" are referred to as "neigh
borhoods," and slowly but surely,
the language is drained of its mean
ing, and the crisis that actually oc
curs is decontextualized; for exam
ple, if you can't call the occupied
territories "occupied," how can you
explain why Palestinians would
wish to resist an occupation?
TD: How do you think the Ameri
can media have covered the po
tential war in Iraq?
RE: The coverage of Iraq has been
supine and pathetic in the Ameri
can press and television. Basically,
Americans are not being told the
realities of the situation. For exam
ple, we're told constantly by
George Bush and Donald Rums
feld that this [potential war] is part
ly about human rights. "Saddam
has used gas against his own peo
ple. He's used gas against the Ira
nians. There are human rights
abuses. There are torture cham
bers ..."

It's all true, bin it was just as bad
in l ( .)8!i. Saddam started using gas
against the Iranian army in 1983.
When he was doing that, President
Reagan decided to reopen the
American Embassy in Baghdad.
And the man he sent to reopen the
American Embassy was Donald
Rumsfeld. So Donald Rumsfeld
was shaking hands with Saddam
when Saddam was using gas, but
now expresses his horror that Sad
dam is using gas. So why did he
shake hands with him? Why did he
reopen die American Embassy?
So what the question is, what is
all this nonsense about human
rights? We didn't care about it
then. Suddenly we're supposed to
care about it now as an excuse to go
to war.
TD: What role do you believe uni
versities like Stanford can play in
changing U.S. foreign policies?
RK: In other universities, I've no
ticed that they have these meetings
with what they call "activists and
academics." Ii often seems to me in
the United States ... instead of ac
tually talking to the people that
seem to be involved in such a war
(like ilie potential war against
Iraq), academics and students all
talk to each other.
You area very privileged group
of people at Stanford. You are not
going to go to the war. You are not
going to light in Iraq. The people
who are going to have their fami
lies go to Iraq are... truck drivers;
they are guys who work on the rail
road trains; they are people who
are bellhops in hotels. But you
don't talk to them... it seems to me
that to try and have an open dis
cussion about the [policies] of the
Middle East and Iraq, you need to
consider talking to the people who
will be most intimately involved in
such a tragedy of an Iraqi military
campaign.
TD: How do you think the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict can be
resolved?
RK: You need to get Sharon out of

the West Bank, but you also need
to slop suicide bombings ... It
needs an evenhanded United
States policy toward the Middle
East, and, at the moment, you're
not going to get that, not with the
Bush administration. America is
becoming more and more hated in
the Middle East because of its total
hi,is toward one side and one side
only, its unconditional support for
Israel. By all means support Israel,
but not unconditionally.
Let's have some support for
people's aspirations in the Arab
world and not just for tin-pot dic
tators who we employ to do our
work for us. Remember Saddam
used to be one of them. We've still
got King Abdullah of Jordan,
[Hosni] Mubarak of Egypt, so on
and so forth.
TD: What do you believe is the
best way the U.S. can achieve
security regarding its War on
Terrorism?
RF: If America's relationship with
the Middle East were based on
peace and justice for all peoples of
the Middle East, if America can act
on the interests of the people of
those regions... it could recapture
its warmth which all the people of
the region felt toward America
after the First World War and in
deed after the Second World War.
America was not always hated in
the Middle East.
It was only in the second half of
the last century, particularly, but
not only, because of its uncondi
tional support for Israel that
America's relationship with the
Arab Muslim world began to dete
riorate. And its continued actions
against countries like Iraq have
embittered many Arab Muslims. If
you can deal fairly with a group of
another people, whether it be your
next door neighbor or a country
on the other side of the world, you
will not need to feel endangered.
Your security will not be your first
concern. Your first concern will be
how you will be able to improve
your relations even more.
