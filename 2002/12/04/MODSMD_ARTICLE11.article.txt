# Fisk criticizes U.S. media in interview
## British journalist discusses views on War on Terrorism 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Nov. 21, Robert Fisk,
Britain's most highly decorated
foreign correspondent, addressed

the Stanford community in a talk
entitled "War and Peace."
During his speech, Fisk, the
longest-serving Western journal
ist in the Middle East, drew from
his personal experiences in
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and the
Middle East to argue that West
erners get a tainted picture of cur
rent events when they receive
their news.
Currently the Middle East cor

respondent for London's Inde
pendent, Fisk has covered some of
the most significant stories in the
Middle East and South Asia for the
past 25 years, including the U.S.-
led war in Afghanistan last year.
Fisk is also one of the few Western
journalists to have interviewed
Osama bin Laden.
For about 20 minutes before
his Nov. 21 talk, Fisk sat down
with The Daily to discuss his
views on American journalists'
coverage of the Middle East, the
role of universities in changing
U.S. foreign policies, the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and the War
on Terrorism.
The Daily: How do you think
your coverage of the Middle East
is different from how American
journalists cover the region?
Robert Fisk: I try to tell the real
ity of the Middle East in a wa)|
that American newspapers and
television don't. I'm even getting
to a point where I don't think
you can call American newspa
pers and television mainstream .
... I think they are becoming al
ternative in the sense that they're
not giving you a full picture.
[They are reporting the Middle
East] in a spineless, biased [and]
cowardly way.
[European journalists like my
self give] a more three-dimension
al look at the Middle East, in which
we are not afraid to criticize Israel.

We're not afraid to criticize the
Arabs, but we're certainly not
afraid to criticize Israel .... The
American press have become so
compliant in their reporting in the
Middle East and have fallen into
line with the reporting style which
avoids any serious criticism of one
side, Israel.
TD: Why do you believe
American journalists have this
bias when reporting on the
Middle East?
RF: Journalists in America like
being very close to power. They
[cozy] up to people in the admin
istration, the politicians. There is
a very unhealthy osmotic, incestu
ous relationship between journal
ists and power. You just look at a
press conference given by Con
doleezza Rice or George Bush:
"Barb, your turn to ask a ques
tion. Thank you very much, but I
dbn't want to get into that right
now. John." It's all first-name
terms, right?
American correspondents often
arrive for the first time in a foreign
country, and what do they do?
They go to the U.S. Embassy fora
briefing. There is this feeling that
[questioning] U.S. foreign policy is
somehow subversive at a time of
crisis. Where, in fact, at a time of
crisis is the one time you must
question and challenge your own
