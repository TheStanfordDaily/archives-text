### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tonight, at 5:30 and 10:30 p.m.,
the Stanford Cardinal Broadcast
ing Network will broadcast its sec
ond news segment of the year, the
culminatjon o ( ti]iuchhajd wQrk by (
several students. Newt teams, film
and editing crews, and three de
voted students — producers se
nior Andy Adler and sophomore
Lian Bloch and director junior
Kiki McGehee — organized and
produced the entire show.
After watching the once-success
ful SCBN news program slowly
sputter over the last few years,
McGehee, Bloch and Adler decid
ed to take matters into their own
hands.
"From day one of this quarter
we've been working on the show,"
Adler said. "When I was a fresh
man working on movie reviews
for SCBN, I didn't even know we
had a news program because it
was so undefined. This year, we
really wanted to make the news
program strong — we wanted to
make it as respectable as other
news sources on campus."
The news program focuses pri
marily on campus news and occa
sionally addresses larger national
or international issues with a Stan
ford focus.
"Anyone can just turn on their
computer and check the latest
news from cnn.com," Bloch said.
"What we want to provide is a
news show that is focused on is
sues directly related to Stanford
students and their lives on cam
pus."
Since the producers and direc

tor basically started from scratch,
they had to recruit reporters, a
film crew, editors and writers. The
process has taken a large amount
of time, and they have only been
able to produce two installments
this year. According to McGehee,
tfWfcPfcW to ruij weekly
next quarter, now that they have a
complete staff.
"It took a while to get things
going," she said. "I had to train stu
dents to use the camera, and we
also had an editing workshop. At
the beginning, people knew very
little about what they were doing,
but each person added a little bit of
their knowledge, and at the end we
got a very professional product. It
has really been a team effort."
Above all, Bloch emphasized,
this quarter served as a learning
experience.
"We all have different experi
ences working in journalism or
film, and this has been a great way
for all of us to bring these experi
ences together," she continued.
"It has really been a lengthy
process, combining individual in
terests with strengths to put out an
interesting show."
The news pieces are selected by
the student news teams, who pitch
ideas to the executive producers
and director and are then loaned
film and editing equipment to
produce a news piece.
"Students have a lot of creative
freedom,"McGehee said. "We
welcome all ideas from our writers
— we're not working to attract a
specific group on campus, and we
try to make the shows interesting
