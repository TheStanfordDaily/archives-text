## Saudis to cut off terror funds 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Saudi Arabia
went on the diplomatic offensive yesterday,
announcing new measures to deny funds to
terror groups and disputing allegations it
has done a poor job in keeping the money
out of terrorists' hands.
The State and Treasury departments
immediately issued statements compli
menting the Arab kingdom's efforts and
muting calls by the White House last week
for the Saudis to do more.
But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said
"the Bush administration and the Saudis
have done a masterful job of turning atten
tion away from . . . the trail that leads to the
possibility that a foreign government provid
ed support to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers."
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the
Saudis had cooperated "some, probably be
grudgingly."
Shelby, the senior Republican member of
the Senate committee, called on U.S. author
ities to find out whether the royal family fund
ed terrorism "either directly or indirectly."
The senators referred to an investigation
by the FBI into reports that contributions
by a Saudi princess who is the wife of Ban
dar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to
Washington, may have indirectly helped
two of the men who participated in the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and

Washington.
The unusual campaign by the generally
withdrawn oil-rich monarchy was waged by
Crown Prince Abdullah's foreign policy ad
viser, Adel al-Jubeir.
Speaking at the Saudi Embassy, he de
picted Saudi Arabia as a victim of an outra
geous campaign that "borders on hate."
He said Saudi Arabia was itself a target of
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi expatriate and
reputed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks,
and was the first nation to freeze al-Qaida's
assets, in 1994.
The fact that 15 of the 19 alleged hijack
ers were Saudis was an attempt by al-Qaida
to give the attacks a Saudi face to try to drive
a wedge between the United States and
Saudi Arabia, al-Jubeir said.
"We believe that people have been mis
informed about Saudi Arabia and what
Saudi Arabia has done, or frankly that peo
ple have lied about what we have done or
what we allegedly have not done," he said.
A report issued at the embassy said Saudi
Arabia had set up a commission to oversee
charitable groups and had barred transfer
of assets from one bank to anot her in cash.
"We've pursued terrorists relentlessly
and punished them harshly," al-Jubeir said.
More than 2,000 terror suspects have
been questioned and more than 100 are in
detention, the Saudi official said.
