# U.N. inspectors search Iraqi palace

### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Internation
al weapons hunters went straight to the
heart of Saddam Hussein's regime yes
terday, searchingthe rooms of an opulent
presidential palace in a show of U.N.
power, just when Washington was open
ly questioning their ability to do the job.
A senior Iraqi official, meanwhile,
said Baghdad will reaffirm in a crucial
upcoming U.N. declaration that it has
no weapons of mass destruction despite
U.S. and British claims to the contrary.
Melissa Fleming of the U.N. nuclear
control agency in Vienna, Austria, said
the Iraqis were expected to submit their
report to the U.N. office in Baghdad on

Saturday — one day before the deadline
mandated by the Security Council.
The unannounced visit to the Al-
Sajoud palace was the biggest test yet of
the arms monitors' authority under a
new U.N. resolution, which led to re
sumption of inspections here last week
after a four-year break.
Seven minutes after the inspectors
rolled up to the palace entrance, the
towering front gates swung open, allow
ing them access to the palm-lined com
pound. Inside, they found a sprawl of
ostentation and luxury, but there was
no word they found anything else.
"Our inspectors were able to inspect

every corner of the presidential palace,"
said their spokesman, Hiro Ueki. The
chief Iraqi liaison, Gen. Hossam Mo
hammed Amin, said the Iraqis were co
operative and"the inspectors were
happy."
The visit by 17 U.N. inspectors lasted
just 1 1/2 hours, hardly enough for an
exhaustive search of scores of rooms
and the vast grounds.
But it bore a symbolic message: that
this time, unlike in the 19905, the U.N.
teams have a free run of Iraq, under a
Security Council mandate requiring
Baghdad to shut down any chemical, bi
ological or nuclear weapons programs.
