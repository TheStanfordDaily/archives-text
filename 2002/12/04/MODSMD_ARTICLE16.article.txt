CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The na
tional guard broke up an opposition
protest with tear gas and rubber bullets
and chased away dissident Venezuelan
generals yesterday during an escalating
strike to oust President Hugo Chavez.
In his first public comment since the
strike began Monday, Chavez called the
action "a desperate effort" to oust him by
an opposition bent on "destabilization

and violence."
"This strike, like all the others, has a
hidden agenda: another coup attempt,"
Chavez told reporters. He vowed that
"they won't achieve their sinister goals of
destabilizing the country."
Chavez accused opposition thugs of
harassing storekeepers to close their
shops and provoking clashes with secu
rity forces. He vowed that the strike will

not "paralyze" Venezuela's key oil in
dustry, and he said he wasn't consider
ing calling a state of emergency, as strik
ers claim.
Venezuela's energy ministry said late
yesterday that all oil refineries were pro
ducing at 100 percent capacity and that
shipments were normal. Venezuela is the
world's fifth-largest oil producer and a
top U.S. supplier.
