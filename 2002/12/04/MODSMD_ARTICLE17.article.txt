## The 						Stanford Daily Dorms with ethnic themes not 'segregationist' 
### 
Published Since 1891

In September, the most ethnically di
verse class in Stanford history entered
the Farm. Many of these students were
drawn to Stanford by the University's
investment in ethnic diversity. At the same
time, the New York Civil Rights Coalition
published a study arguing against ethnic
theme houses and other Stanford pro
grains, calling them "paternalistic" and
"segregationist."
We find the study and its conclusions highly
flawed, especially given the study's unscientific
nature. The researchers — student interns
from Harvard and NYU — simply looked at
bulletins, course catalogs, publications and of
ficial Web sites of several universities including
Stanford, without studying the programs
themselves or speaking to students.

The word "paternalistic" implies that Stan
ford's ethnic theme dorms were created by an
overbearing administration hoping to impose
its version of diversity on a reluctant student
body. In fact, the movement to create the
houses was mostly student-driven. Stanford's
first ethnic theme house, U jamaa, was creat
ed in 1970 at the behest of students from the
Black Community Services Center and the
Black Student Union. The rest of the ethnic
theme houses — Okada, Casa Zapata and
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk — followed. While stu
dents, including non-minorities, can choose
to live in ethnic theme houses, they are by no
means forced to.
Perhaps the researchers believe that minor
ity students are segregating themselves? But in
fact, most ethnic theme houses cannot fulfill

housing requests from every student, even
those who "match" the theme. Therefore,
many minority students who would like to live
in theme houses must accept other housing.
And it is very rare fora student to live in the
same residence for four consecutive years — or
even two or three years — given the nature of
Stanford's spring housing draw. Most students
who have lived in an ethnic theme dorm have
also spent a considerable part of their college
lives in other housing.
Plus, 50 percent of the residents in each
house are not members of the ethnicity that the
house celebrates. Ethnic theme houses do pro
vide students with a comfortable, nurturing
living environment, but they also allow minor
ity students to share their culture with those
outside of their ethnic group.

There are other houses on campus that
have thrived under so-called "segregationist"
themes — Casa Italiana, La Maison Francaise
and Yost House, for Italian, French and Span
ish speakers, respectively; Naranja, for those
interested in social entrepreneurship; Roth,
for females; not to mention fraternity and
sorority houses, open only to those in the
Greek system.
Ethnic theme houses, like the houses men
tioned above, aren't meant to segregate. In
stead, they are meant to bring together a
group of people who have something in com
mon, to engage in dialogue, form a communi
ty and share that community with the rest of
campus. We think they add richness to the
Stanford campus by celebrating diversity in an
inclusive wav
