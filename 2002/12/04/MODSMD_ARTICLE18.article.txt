The state of popular music is abso
lutely appalling. The commodi
fication of music — the increas
ing equivalency of pop music
and Pop Tarts — is an affront to music
lovers everywhere. tifho Inn;
Consider Smashmouth. I have never
been a huge fan of the group, but their ar
rival on the popular music scene in the late
'90s was encouraging. The hoarse vocals
and infectious dirty organ riff of "Walking
on the Sun," the band's first single, seemed

to be a revival of 1960s
garage rock like the Seeds
and the Mysterians.
But all Smashmouth is
good for anymore, it
seems, is cover songs for
animated movies
("Shrek," "Ice Age") and
Jennifer Love Hewitt ve
hicles. Thankfully, now
that Hewitt has released

her own (surely virtuosic) album, these
erstwhile garage rockers might be on their
way out.
It is not only Smashmouth. It is MTV's
"total request" canon and its reluctance to
take a chance on vanguard bands. It is the
incessant news of that guy Lance from
NSYNC — and I am utterly ashamed that
the media has hammered his name into
my memory — riding into space with Rus
sian astronauts. Is this a bad episode of
Scooby Doo?
But I have hope for the future of music.
And it depends on an obscure and slightly
pretentious theory of the music market.
Some music critics have posited that the
quality and originality of mainstream music
derives to a large extent from the state of
the economy. In a thriving economy, cor
porate monoliths like EMI, Geffen and
Warner/Reprise have the confidence to
manufacture, package and promote musi
cians to a national market. This economic
theory of music further asserts that the dis
posable income engendered by fiscal pros
perity broadens the music market. People
of limited musical literacy may be more in
clined to purchase albums during these cy
cles, particularly if they are marketed well.
Consider a few examples. Prior to his
frightening metamorphosis, Michael Jack
son was an extraordinarily marketable,
commercially impeccable musician. During
the same late-'Bos period, the boy band pio
neers New Kids on the Block capitalized on
memorabilia, cartoons and other tie-ins. Of
course there were countless brilliant musi
cians recording music during this period
(indeed, many of my favorites), but they
garnered negligible mainstream appeal.
Beginning in the prosperous late '90s, a
host of crooning poster boys and cola-pitch
ing pop divas has illustrated a similar trend
of high profile if low-quality musicianship.
Dampened economies, in contrast, may
transplant the locus of sonic entrepreneur
ship to regional, independent labels and
music markets. When the American econ
omy stumbled during the early '90s, a sin
gle geographic region came to exert an
enormous influence on popular music: the

Pacific Northwest. The fiscal interpreta
tion of popular music contends that a
clour economy partially limits the pur
chase of music to people with more dis
criminating tastes. The suggestion is that
people who love music will buy music
even in a bad economy.
Of course, the economy does not
merely alTect popular music in terms of
demand. Mass discontentment can serve
as the very inspiration for the music it
self; as Camus wrote, "There's nothing
like insecurity for stimulating the brain."
The birth of punk rock gives testimo
ny. This genre — a vulgar, elemental
species of rock n' roll — sprung from the
resentment and malaise of the British
working class and poor during the mid
'7os. Bands like the Sex Pistols and the
Clash sang of anarchy, violence and rev
olution. The Pistols recorded what many
consider the first "hardcore" song, "Bod
ies," a song rife with revolting imagery
and gratuitous expletives. It is unlikely
that heavy metal and hardcore rap groups
would be enjoying such lyrical license
were it not for the precedent set by their
English forebears.
The dearth of quality, original music on
MTV — the bubble gum dispenser of cable
television — and nii metal's monopoly on
action movie soundtracks have prompted
the emergence of a new group of musical
ly literate people: the obscurati.
The obscurati revel in any opportunity
to describe obscure bands in terms of
cross-genre characterizations ("It's surf
rock meets post-grunge alt-country.") and
hybridizations of other bands. ("Imagine
that Milo from the Descendents sang for
an Abba-tinged Superdrag.") Sadly, I find
myself making these statements, as if to af
firm my own musical sensibility.
The capacity of record companies to
determine what people hear and when
and where they hear it, irrespective of mu
sical talent or originality, becomes trou
blingly clear in the case of Wilco, a coun
try-influenced Midwestern rock quartet.
Following a series of albums that garnered
critical praise and moderate commercial
success, Wilco was dropped from their
label, Warner / Reprise, when the tracks
they recorded for their new album did not
prove sufficiently "commercially viable."
Eventually the band was signed by
Nonesuch Records (ironically, a sub
sidiary of Warner / Reprise) and "Yankee
Hotel Foxtrot" was released in early 2002.
Wilco's period of contractual limbo was
documented in the film "1 am Trying to
Break Your Heart." The album and the
film both fared extremely well in, natural
ly, a foundering economy.
Nobody wants our national economy to
suffer, of course. Still, you might find con
solation in the thought that diving stocks
might just herald the end of formulaic
rap-rock, pubescent divas and, I can only
hope, Lance.
