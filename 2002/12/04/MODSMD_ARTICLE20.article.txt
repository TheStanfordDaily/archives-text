Gaieties writer defends script
As a Yell Leader, a Gaieties writer, actor
and the chock-full-of-melanin Indian in
question, 1 have been at the center of many
letters to the editor. I would like to respond
to Jerome Murphy's letter. (" 'Respect' miss
ing from Gaieties," Nov. 26).
First, I would like to exonerate the writ
ers for the placement of the "this is brown
er than me" line. It was never in the script,
and I personally added it during re
hearsals, eliciting laughs, not embarrass
ment, from the cast, Marc Wais, and on
three nights, maybe a seat or two in Mem
Aud. I was poking fun at myself and the
quirkiness surrounding Wais' race change
that accompanied his age change (I'm sur
prised the writer wasn't offended by Wais
dancing the Bhangra, or my earlier line
about Axess randomly turning him "19 ...
and Indian"). Had I sensed that the audi
ence would be wholly "embarrassed," or
that it implied "snobbery and tastelessness,"
the line would have never made it. I am still
quite confused by Murphy's indication that
Gaieties promotes Stanford's intellectual
superiority, and then goes on to state that
lie was annoyed at how much the show
makes fun of Stanford.
I apologize that the line offended some,
but Gaieties cannot cater to every person
who will take offense at any given line, or
we would stand in silence lor two and a half
hours. Gaieties is meant to be an equal-op
portunity offender; 1 sincerely hope no
one gets the impression that Gaieties is di
rected at their particular group, seeing as
we referenced female athletes, fraternities,
sororities, WASPs, Italians, French, Ger
mans, Russians, the administration, nearly
every dorm on campus, Sweet Hall, old
people, RAs, anti-nudists, the ASSU,
Tupac, pirates, borophyll and of course,
(',al. I am not trying to imply that those who
have complained are more "uptight" than
these groups, just Because they have writ
ten a letter voicing complaints and Tupac
has not, but rather, just to give credence to
the notion that Gaieties has always been,
and will always be, a lighthearted comedy

making fun of as much of Stanford and Gal
as possible. I am sorry if others find such
humor to be derogatory and offensive, and
I respect that. However, I do not share
that feeling, and I feel that Gaieties is a
forum where one checks those reserva
tions at the door and just goes in to get a
few laughs and let the rest slide.
We do try to be sensitive to people's feel
ings and have a read-through for local com
munity centers to determine if they feel the
group they represent would take offense at
any particular jokes. I agree that this does
not necessarily apply to Murphy, and he
may be underrepresented at such events,
but if he can suggest anything better, we'd
like to hear it.

Affirmative action holds 'inherently
unfair biases'
Chike-Obi's comments on Joe Fairbanks
misrepresented his comments and missed
an important issue ("Fairbanks' rhetoric is
'appalling,' " Nov. 26). I understand her
opposition to his viewpoint but think it is
highly speculative to claim that Fairbanks
assumes she is inferior because she is a black
woman attending a prestigious university.
Fairbanks did not say as much. I le only re
ferred in general terms to college educa
tions or jobs.
As Chike-Obi states, Stanford and other
prestigious universities can admit higher
percentages of minority applicant popula
tions without adversely affecting a (lass's
academic quality. Affirmative action quotas
would be unlikely to change what type of
students Stanford admits.
The more important issue is the role af
firmative action can play at mediocre insti
tutions and in our government. The insti
tution that can pick from a full rainbow of
perfectly qualified applicants is an ideal; the
reality is usually different.
As a taxpayer, it scares me to think that
I might be rejected fora job in favor of a
less qualified applicant who lit a quota re

quirement, to the eventual detriment of so
ciety as a whole. As a gay, white male who
could be rejected in some states because of
both my non-minority racial standing and
my unprotected sexual orientation, I find
it impossible to support affirmative action's
inherently unfair biases. Instead of spend
ing money giving less qualified individuals
jobs or admission to higher education
when more qualified people would be
more productive, 1 hope we can spend
money to give people of all kinds the tools
to compete on an even playing field.

Letter 'missed Robert Fisk's point 7
John Sanford's letter on Robert Fisk
("Journalist Fisk is a 'propagandist,' " Nov.
27) is lovely with an ironic twist: Me com
mits exactly the crimes that he claims does
not exist. Fisk is indeed a fortunate man: to
have one's critics substantiate one's points is
genuine good luck.
Sanford argues that American flagship
newspapers are fair on the basis of two arti
cles that he mentions. Setting aside the glar
ing "small-sample bias," Sanford's argu
ment is reminiscent of an era where racists
would say, "Of course, I'm not racist â€” I
have a cou pie of black friends." It is true that
The New York limes, The Washington
Post and the Los Angeles Times have occa
si< mally published articles 11 lat were fair and
just, fhe real question is whether they have
published enough.
What I found particularly interesting,
racist and pejorative within Sanlord's letter
is his phrase, "as [Robert Fisk is] getting his
butt kicked by Afghans" as if Afghans were
this general population, dehumanized,
that one day, instead of finding soccer balls
to kit k, chose to prey on Fisk instead. I fear
Sanford lias missed Fisk's point: Afghans
are individuals, not one generic population
that emerges from Afghanistan, Inc. on an
