Gaieties writer defends script
As a Yell Leader, a Gaieties writer, actor
and the chock-full-of-melanin Indian in
question, 1 have been at the center of many
letters to the editor. I would like to respond
to Jerome Murphy's letter. (" 'Respect' miss
ing from Gaieties," Nov. 26).
First, I would like to exonerate the writ
ers for the placement of the "this is brown
er than me" line. It was never in the script,
and I personally added it during re
hearsals, eliciting laughs, not embarrass
ment, from the cast, Marc Wais, and on
three nights, maybe a seat or two in Mem
Aud. I was poking fun at myself and the
quirkiness surrounding Wais' race change
that accompanied his age change (I'm sur
prised the writer wasn't offended by Wais
dancing the Bhangra, or my earlier line
about Axess randomly turning him "19 ...
and Indian"). Had I sensed that the audi
ence would be wholly "embarrassed," or
that it implied "snobbery and tastelessness,"
the line would have never made it. I am still
quite confused by Murphy's indication that
Gaieties promotes Stanford's intellectual
superiority, and then goes on to state that
lie was annoyed at how much the show
makes fun of Stanford.
I apologize that the line offended some,
but Gaieties cannot cater to every person
who will take offense at any given line, or
we would stand in silence lor two and a half
hours. Gaieties is meant to be an equal-op
portunity offender; 1 sincerely hope no
one gets the impression that Gaieties is di
rected at their particular group, seeing as
we referenced female athletes, fraternities,
sororities, WASPs, Italians, French, Ger
mans, Russians, the administration, nearly
every dorm on campus, Sweet Hall, old
people, RAs, anti-nudists, the ASSU,
Tupac, pirates, borophyll and of course,
(',al. I am not trying to imply that those who
have complained are more "uptight" than
these groups, just Because they have writ
ten a letter voicing complaints and Tupac
has not, but rather, just to give credence to
the notion that Gaieties has always been,
and will always be, a lighthearted comedy

making fun of as much of Stanford and Gal
as possible. I am sorry if others find such
humor to be derogatory and offensive, and
I respect that. However, I do not share
that feeling, and I feel that Gaieties is a
forum where one checks those reserva
tions at the door and just goes in to get a
few laughs and let the rest slide.
We do try to be sensitive to people's feel
ings and have a read-through for local com
munity centers to determine if they feel the
group they represent would take offense at
any particular jokes. I agree that this does
not necessarily apply to Murphy, and he
may be underrepresented at such events,
but if he can suggest anything better, we'd
like to hear it.

Affirmative action holds 'inherently
unfair biases'
Chike-Obi's comments on Joe Fairbanks
misrepresented his comments and missed
an important issue ("Fairbanks' rhetoric is
'appalling,' " Nov. 26). I understand her
opposition to his viewpoint but think it is
highly speculative to claim that Fairbanks
assumes she is inferior because she is a black
woman attending a prestigious university.
Fairbanks did not say as much. I le only re
ferred in general terms to college educa
tions or jobs.
As Chike-Obi states, Stanford and other
prestigious universities can admit higher
percentages of minority applicant popula
tions without adversely affecting a (lass's
academic quality. Affirmative action quotas
would be unlikely to change what type of
students Stanford admits.
The more important issue is the role af
firmative action can play at mediocre insti
tutions and in our government. The insti
tution that can pick from a full rainbow of
perfectly qualified applicants is an ideal; the
reality is usually different.
As a taxpayer, it scares me to think that
I might be rejected fora job in favor of a
less qualified applicant who lit a quota re

quirement, to the eventual detriment of so
ciety as a whole. As a gay, white male who
could be rejected in some states because of
both my non-minority racial standing and
my unprotected sexual orientation, I find
it impossible to support affirmative action's
inherently unfair biases. Instead of spend
ing money giving less qualified individuals
jobs or admission to higher education
when more qualified people would be
more productive, 1 hope we can spend
money to give people of all kinds the tools
to compete on an even playing field.

Letter 'missed Robert Fisk's point 7
John Sanford's letter on Robert Fisk
("Journalist Fisk is a 'propagandist,' " Nov.
27) is lovely with an ironic twist: Me com
mits exactly the crimes that he claims does
not exist. Fisk is indeed a fortunate man: to
have one's critics substantiate one's points is
genuine good luck.
Sanford argues that American flagship
newspapers are fair on the basis of two arti
cles that he mentions. Setting aside the glar
ing "small-sample bias," Sanford's argu
ment is reminiscent of an era where racists
would say, "Of course, I'm not racist — I
have a cou pie of black friends." It is true that
The New York limes, The Washington
Post and the Los Angeles Times have occa
si< mally published articles 11 lat were fair and
just, fhe real question is whether they have
published enough.
What I found particularly interesting,
racist and pejorative within Sanlord's letter
is his phrase, "as [Robert Fisk is] getting his
butt kicked by Afghans" as if Afghans were
this general population, dehumanized,
that one day, instead of finding soccer balls
to kit k, chose to prey on Fisk instead. I fear
Sanford lias missed Fisk's point: Afghans
are individuals, not one generic population
that emerges from Afghanistan, Inc. on an
assembly line. Sadly, the c rime he commits
is ( fit journalism colleague who
should speak ofthe violence of Palestinians,
but only the militant acts ol the Israeli gov
ernment or specific individuals, but not its
general people.
I was once asked years ago, in refer
ence to all Iranians, "What are they like?
Are they violent?" It is tragic that the per
son who asked that pejorative question is
a journalist and insists on dehumanizing
individuals.

New football uniforms are
disappointing as well
I agree with The Daily's comments on
the Big Game disappointment and even
more so with all games prior to Nov. 2IS.
Losing is one thing, but being embar
rassed by the Pac-10 sisters is another.
These players would have responded to
Tyrone Willingham.
My gripe, however, pertains to this year's

uniform. The one from last year's success
1< )< >ked like a direct link back t<) many seasons
and many coaches prior to 2001. Shouldn't
there be some minimal requirement that a
coach exhibit several years' worth of success
before he is allowed to put his stamp on the
team by a unilorm-color-scheme change?

Thank those behind Stanford's
Thanksgiving dinner
Last Thursday, 1,400 members of the
Stanford community gathered for the
filth annual Thanksgiving dinner, a beau
tiful gathering. There is a small story
about the person who inspired it that 1
hope you will enjoy.
A department administrator in the
Physics Department, Marcia Keating, used
to welcome Physics and Applied Physics
grad students to Stanford in a particularly
warm way. Each year, Marcia invited any
lirst-year student who had nowhere else to
go lor Thanksgiving to come to her house
lor dinner with her family. Man ia's kind
ness inspired Harris Shapiro, a fellow
Physics graduate student, and I to expand
the idea to a dinner that could include every
Stanford graduate student on Thanksgiv
ing. Our GSC-sponsored dinner also al
lowed non-graduate students because we

knew that on Thanksgiving we could not
turn anyone away.
The GSC members who have orga
nized it in subsequent years have expand
ed it greatly so that it now welcomes and
invites all members of the Stanford com
munity and is co-sponsored by (lie ASSU
and other parts of the University.—,-roi
1 hope that if you enjoyed the dinner
last week, you can take a moment to thank
the people you know who ran it this year,
particularly the deans who provided fund
ing for it and the GSC and ASSU members
and volunteers who organized it. Please, if
you know them, thank Ying Wong and
Lisa Marin lor their hard work this year,
and Jeannette Smith-Laws for her work
on all five of these dinners.
