# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## Why guys won't marry us 
### 
Recently, I've taken to perusing
those luxury homeowner maga
zine's on a regular basis again, the
kind with pages and pages of
photo spreads ol really innovative (and ex
pensive) houses. With all this extra procras
tination time I've been atlbrded by Thanks
giving break, I've had .1 lot of opportunities
to sit and ponder my future plans fora sa
vory lite. Ot course this includes the chal
lenging, world-inlluencing job that I han
dle with ease and expertise, as well as fash
ionable style; the elegant cars in which I
travel to my posh oil ice (and the sporty ones
1 take to dip oil to my stylish holiday retreat
venues); and, of course, the beautiful house
in which I reside with my supportive, secure

and ever-successful (not
to mention super-sexy)
husband.
The whole picture is
really vivid in my mind.
I can see the house; 1 can
see myself sitting in my
walk-in closet with my
morning tea picking
outfits with the help of

my computerized wardrobe. The layout is
clear, the colors and textures are all there,
but there's one part of the dream that's
real fuzzy, real blurry around the edges:
It's the husband.
Who is he? Does he even exist? And,
even scarier, are there even men who can
handle being with women of the caliber that
I intend to reach?
What really got me thinking about this
is an article 1 read in Essence magazine
about the most happening woman of the
moment: Halle Berry. You must all know
her by now as the latest Bond girl, but she's
far more than that — she is an amazing
role model and inspiration to all women of
the world.
What shocked me is that with all the suc
cess that life has brought her — she is gor
geous, she is the first black recipient of the
Oscar for Best Actress, and she does a great
job as Jinx in "Die Another Day" — there
are rumors that her husband, R&B singer
Eric Benet, has been cheating on her. I lor
ror registers in my mind as I read this, of
course. How could that possibly be true
when she's so amazing?
But then this recalls the Janet Jackson /
Rene Elizondo fiasco, which gets me
thinking: What if it is precisely because of
these women's incredible talent and suc
cess that their men can't handle the situa
tion and end up doing them wrong? 1 hat
is, just because you're a phenomenal
woman does not mean that you will have a
happy relationship life.
When 1 came to Stanford, I was
shocked to hear that a lot ol people really
expected to meet their hubbies here. 1 was
like, "What are you talking about, and why
would you even have such a thought,
when there are so many better things you
could be spending your time doing in col
lege?" (This was my 18-year-old, anti-rela
tionship persona speaking.) Why look for
a husband, of all things? A really fun
boyfriend to chill with, yes. But a husband,
no. Those connote images of suburbia and
boredom and bills and messy kids and all
types of other st nil that I was just really not
in the mood to think about.
Well, a lew years later, my mind has
changed slightly. I no longer think that hus
bands have to be a drag. I can see that for all
we know they're really cool to have around
the house. I mean, my mom held on to hers,
so they can't be all bad (Ha ha. Daddy, yon
know I love you and I'm just kidding). So
now the question is: Where and how, if at

all, am I (and the hundreds of women here
who are a lot like me) going to find one?
The whole maybe-I'll-meet-him-at-
Stanlord logic really started to take on some
validity as I thought: Well, where better? 1
mean, Stanford men are smart, they're am
bitious, they're honorable (or at least they
claim to be ai the start of every test). Really,
they're supposed to be the cream of the
crop, right?
Well, yes, t hat is right. I mean, in many
ways they are the cream of the cr< >p, and, all
my disparaging comments aside, I really
do mean ibis. 1 told you all last week about
how amazing my friends at Stanford are —
did you really think those were all girls?
They're not. I get along a thousand times
better with men than with women, which is
why you're likely to find me the only rose
among the thorns on many occasions. But
that's just (lie thing. They make amazing
friends, but they just don't cut it as rela
tionship material for one reason. They're
not ready for us.
A little e-mail war has begun on one of
(lie mailing lists about how the sexes inter
act. Apparently, according to one of our
finest and most eligible bachelors, Stanford
women think too much of themselves, and
Stanford men are responsible for feeding
and perpetuating this insanity by being too
nice and making us feel too special. The re
sult of this overflow of self-esteem is that we
are reluctant to accept the below-par, sub
standard advances of the admittedly lazy
and somewhat desperate men we find our
selves surrounded with.
Of course, 1 think this is all a little ridicu
lous in the first place, but I will comment
because that's what we do here — we
humor these men in the meanwhile, while
we wait for them to grow up. Now, in re
sponse to this, a Stanford woman discussed
how she and members of her community
have themselves been guilty of feeding this
situation by being too considerate and
going too far out of their way for men. That
means spending too much time listening to
their woes, helping with their papers and
providing style advice for their homes and
wardrobes, and I agree, but I have some
thing else to add to the debate.
And this is all I want to let men know:
You can say what you want to say, but when
you leave here, you will appreciate us. For
all the times you complained about all the
things we weren't willing to do under the
somewhat sketchy circumstances you pro
posed, you will be grateful after you gradu
ate for the way that we are.
How do 1 know this? Don't worry, I do
have proof, straight from the horse's mouth.
A friend was telling me that when he went
home for break, he was having a little to
drink with some girls. When lie tried to get
up and found, of course, that he couldn't
walk straight, he said something to the effect
of,"Ooh, I think my equilibrium is oil "And
what did his not-so-bright companions
reply with? "Why did you have to use such
a big word?"
Let's be serious: If they can't even un
derstand everything you're trying to say
— and mind you, you're not attempting to
explain nuclear physics — are they really
the types you would want to be conversing
with indefinitely? Is this really the pool
from which you would like to pick a life
partner?
So to the men: Next time it occurs to you
to complain about us, stop and be grateful
for what you have right here on the Farm.
Maybe by the time you decide to get it to
gether, we will still want you.

cess that life has brought her — she is gor
geous, she is the first black recipient of the
Oscar for Best Actress, and she does a great
job as Jinx in "Die Another Day" — there
are rumors that her husband, R&B singer
Eric Benet, has been cheating on her. I lor
ror registers in my mind as I read this, of
course. How could that possibly be true
when she's so amazing?
But then this recalls the Janet Jackson /
Rene Elizondo fiasco, which gets me
thinking: What if it is precisely because of
these women's incredible talent and suc
cess that their men can't handle the situa
tion and end up doing them wrong? 1 hat
is, just because you're a phenomenal
woman does not mean that you will have a
happy relationship life.
When 1 came to Stanford, I was
shocked to hear that a lot ol people really
expected to meet their hubbies here. 1 was
like, "What are you talking about, and why
would you even have such a thought,
when there are so many better things you
could be spending your time doing in col
lege?" (This was my 18-year-old, anti-rela
tionship persona speaking.) Why look for
a husband, of all things? A really fun
boyfriend to chill with, yes. But a husband,
no. Those connote images of suburbia and
boredom and bills and messy kids and all
types of other st nil that I was just really not
in the mood to think about.
Well, a lew years later, my mind has
changed slightly. I no longer think that hus
bands have to be a drag. I can see that for all
we know they're really cool to have around
the house. I mean, my mom held on to hers,
so they can't be all bad (Ha ha. Daddy, yon
know I love you and I'm just kidding). So
now the question is: Where and how, if at

all, am I (and the hundreds of women here
who are a lot like me) going to find one?
The whole maybe-I'll-meet-him-at-
Stanlord logic really started to take on some
validity as I thought: Well, where better? 1
mean, Stanford men are smart, they're am
bitious, they're honorable (or at least they
claim to be ai the start of every test). Really,
they're supposed to be the cream of the
crop, right?
Well, yes, t hat is right. I mean, in many
ways they are the cream of the cr< >p, and, all
my disparaging comments aside, I really
do mean ibis. 1 told you all last week about
how amazing my friends at Stanford are —
did you really think those were all girls?
They're not. I get along a thousand times
better with men than with women, which is
why you're likely to find me the only rose
among the thorns on many occasions. But
that's just (lie thing. They make amazing
friends, but they just don't cut it as rela
tionship material for one reason. They're
not ready for us.
A little e-mail war has begun on one of
(lie mailing lists about how the sexes inter
act. Apparently, according to one of our
finest and most eligible bachelors, Stanford
women think too much of themselves, and
Stanford men are responsible for feeding
and perpetuating this insanity by being too
nice and making us feel too special. The re
sult of this overflow of self-esteem is that we
are reluctant to accept the below-par, sub
standard advances of the admittedly lazy
and somewhat desperate men we find our
selves surrounded with.
Of course, 1 think this is all a little ridicu
lous in the first place, but I will comment
because that's what we do here — we
humor these men in the meanwhile, while
we wait for them to grow up. Now, in re
sponse to this, a Stanford woman discussed
how she and members of her community
have themselves been guilty of feeding this
situation by being too considerate and
going too far out of their way for men. That
means spending too much time listening to
their woes, helping with their papers and
providing style advice for their homes and
wardrobes, and I agree, but I have some
thing else to add to the debate.
And this is all I want to let men know:
You can say what you want to say, but when
you leave here, you will appreciate us. For
all the times you complained about all the
things we weren't willing to do under the
somewhat sketchy circumstances you pro
posed, you will be grateful after you gradu
ate for the way that we are.
How do 1 know this? Don't worry, I do
have proof, straight from the horse's mouth.
A friend was telling me that when he went
home for break, he was having a little to
drink with some girls. When lie tried to get
up and found, of course, that he couldn't
walk straight, he said something to the effect
of,"Ooh, I think my equilibrium is oil "And
what did his not-so-bright companions
reply with? "Why did you have to use such
a big word?"
Let's be serious: If they can't even un
derstand everything you're trying to say
— and mind you, you're not attempting to
explain nuclear physics — are they really
the types you would want to be conversing
with indefinitely? Is this really the pool
from which you would like to pick a life
partner?
So to the men: Next time it occurs to you
to complain about us, stop and be grateful
for what you have right here on the Farm.
Maybe by the time you decide to get it to
gether, we will still want you.

Recently, I've taken to perusing
those luxury homeowner maga
zine's on a regular basis again, the
kind with pages and pages of
photo spreads ol really innovative (and ex
pensive) houses. With all this extra procras
tination time I've been atlbrded by Thanks
giving break, I've had .1 lot of opportunities
to sit and ponder my future plans fora sa
vory lite. Ot course this includes the chal
lenging, world-inlluencing job that I han
dle with ease and expertise, as well as fash
ionable style; the elegant cars in which I
travel to my posh oil ice (and the sporty ones
1 take to dip oil to my stylish holiday retreat
venues); and, of course, the beautiful house
in which I reside with my supportive, secure

and ever-successful (not
to mention super-sexy)
husband.
The whole picture is
really vivid in my mind.
I can see the house; 1 can
see myself sitting in my
walk-in closet with my
morning tea picking
outfits with the help of

my computerized wardrobe. The layout is
clear, the colors and textures are all there,
but there's one part of the dream that's
real fuzzy, real blurry around the edges:
It's the husband.
Who is he? Does he even exist? And,
even scarier, are there even men who can
handle being with women of the caliber that
I intend to reach?
What really got me thinking about this
is an article 1 read in Essence magazine
about the most happening woman of the
moment: Halle Berry. You must all know
her by now as the latest Bond girl, but she's
far more than that — she is an amazing
role model and inspiration to all women of
the world.
