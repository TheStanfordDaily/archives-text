# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## G-CEP needs multidiscplinary approach 
### BEN ABADI GUEST COLUMNIST 
Last week, Stanford University an
nounced a $225 million, 10-year Global
(ilimale and Energy Project, sponsored !>y
donations from ExxonMobil, General
Electric and Schlumberger. In many re
spects, this is positive news. ()ur engineer
ing and earth sciences programs stand to
benefit substantially, as they will likely
move to the forefront of'energy-related re
search. More importantly, Stanford has an
opportunity to address climate change by
facilitating research into energy produc
tion with minimal environmental damage.
At the same time, this grant may be
problematic. The proposal appears to put
little or no emphasis on most major re
search fields necessary in addressing cli
mate change. In addition, it poses a risk to
Stanford's reputation by associating us
with some of the world's dirtiest compa
nies; we must avoid becoming their part
ner in pollution.
The G-CEP leaders' decisions in allo
cating grants will determine whether the
initiative succeeds in positively addressing
climate change. A failure to fund signifi
cant research in solar and wind power, ef
ficiency and economic modeling will un
dermine G-CEP's success and tarnish
Stanford's image. Our strong reputation
allows us to attract die most desirable stu
dents, faculty and donations. If we allow
companies such as these to buy our credi
bility, we threaten our continued success
as an elite and progressive research insti
tution. G-CEP Director Lynn Orr,
Deputy Director Christopher Edwards
and the management committee need
substantial independence from corporate
influence and collaboration with con
cerned faculty and students to maximize
the benefit of this project to the Universi
ty and climate issues.
G-CEP's corporate donors all own
brands that suffer because their profits
depend on environmentally destructive
activities. Many environmentalists see last

week's announcement as simply another
ploy to "greenwash" the donors' soiled
images and believe that the money will
not fund research with environmental
benefits.
G-CEP's supposed research freedom is
compromised by a clause that allows
donors u> withdraw after only three years.
Since development of environmentally
beneficial technologies is likely to hurt the
sponsoring companies, 1 fear that G-CEP
may have to choose between longevity
and efficacy.
The G-CEP project Web site outlines 11
research areas and indicates that environ
mentally harmful energy sources like coal
and nuclear power will each receive signif
icant funding.
More worrisome is the complete omis
sion of atmospheric science, energy de
mand management and economic aspects
of the climate problem. Demand-side en
ergy efficiency technology provides an
easy way to reduce greenhouse emissions
and should be a central component of en
ergy engineering research. Furthermore,
while research into engineering is a crucial
ingredient of addressing c limate change,
heavy emphasis must also be placed on
studying economic aspects of the problem
along with the policy challenge of adopt
ing new technologies. Engineering re
search must be accompanied by research
into a policy that encourages firms to take
on associated costs, and economic models
to find an optimal technology balance.
()nly ihis broader examination will lead to
t lie highest overall benefits to current and
future generations.
G-CEP is not the first time ExxonMobil
has sponsored climate research at Stan
lord. In 1998 Hoover Institution Fellow
Thomas Gale Moore wrote a book entitled
"Climate of Fear: Why We Shouldn't
Worry about Global Warming." The same
year ExxonMobil made a contribution to
the Hoover Institution, as well as the other
two political organizations that published
Moore's work.
ExxonMobil's environmental record is

considered among the worst in the world.
Not only is its core business environmen
tally harmful, but it has also spent millions
wholly denying climate change. Last
week's announcement signaled a major
policy c hange lor ExxonMobil, but many
believe th.it it will continue to prioritize
profits over the world environment.
ExxonMobil's annual donation will com
prise just under 0.004 percent ol its rev
enue. The key question is whether Exxon-
Mobil's donation is an earnest attempt to
mitigate climate change, or simply a pub
lic relations scheme.
Skeptics point to a New York Times ad
vertisement where ExxonMobil applauds
itself fora new commitment to "a respon
sible path forward on climate." Yet the
company maintains that "development of
technological options will almost certainly
require decades of research and many bil
lions of dollars of investment." This ad
mission that our title sponsor does not ex
pect G-CEP to make a significant impact
on climate change leads me to suspect that
ExxonMobil will not allow its donation to
be used for truly environmentally benefi
cial research. I am further afraid that the
University's reputation will be damaged to
further polluting interests.
Stanford University has earned a repu
tation as one of the world's premier re
search universities. Now, we have been
given a mandate to research solutions to
the climate change problem and enough
funding to make a tangible difference.
Fhe G-CEP leadership must commit to
addressing relevant research across disc i
plines including solar and wind technolo
gies, energy efficiency, economic models
and policy design. Despite our association
with environmentally irresponsible com
panies, careful use of this grant should en
able Stanford to meaningfully address cli
mate change.
