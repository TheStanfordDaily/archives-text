The article "Fed. mediator enters hos
pital labor struggle" on the front page of
the Nov. 27 issue ofThe Daily incorrectly
stated that only the Stanford hospitals'
managers called in a federal mediator to
help work out a new contract. Actually,
both the managers and union SEJU local
715 requested the mediator.
