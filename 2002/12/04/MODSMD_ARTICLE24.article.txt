# Lack of space worries student groups
## 
### JULIE TUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most of the community
centers on campus have given full
support to the Black Community
Services Center's ongoing efforts
to acquire more space, several, in
cluding ElCentroChicanoand the
LCBT-CRC, have been reporting
similar needs. The crunch lor stu
dent space is now affecting not
only community centers but the
entire campus, a problem which
the ASSU is working to address.
"In the last few years, commu
nity centers, already under-fund
ed and overlooked in many re
spects, have seen the problem
evolve to a point where under
funding matched with the inability
to fund raise [due to] University re
straints has caused the community
centers to not be able to adequate
ly achieve their missions," said
ASSU Senator Michael Brown 11, a
sophomore.
Lack of meeting space — which
is the most pressing problem — is
not the only difficulty facing the
community centers. According to
representatives from multiple cen
ters, storage space, social space
and especially performance space
are also lacking.
"Performance space is a critical
need that is shared by all the com
munity centers," said Frances
Morales, assistant dean and direc
tor of El Centro Chicano. "And our
storage space is continually dimin
ishing; [for example], we had to
give up space to accommodate a
summer session office being built."
For El Centro Chicano, wheel
chair accessibility is also a priority,
Morales said.
Increases in the number of stu
dent organizations and program
ming have placed a further strain
on community center resources.
"[The space problem] has
grown worse because there's much
more demand for programs," said
senior Aika Swai, a staff member at

the LGBT-CRC. "We have almost
quadrupled the things we do, and
the number of students directly or
indirectly served by the center has
grown exponentially."
However, some community
centers have not made getting ad
ditional space a top priority be
cause they see little chance for
change.
"It's one of our direst problems,
but it's probably the one thing we
do the least about because we fear
that we alone can't change it," Swai
said. "Ideally, we would like to
have social space that can be sepa
rate from academic and program
ming space; right now we have
people working on a thesis right
next to people watching a movie
because it's just one big room."
Lisa Moore, assistant director of
the Women's Community Center,

does not rile acquiring more space
as an active priority for the center
at this time. I lowever, she does ac
knowledge that the problem ex
ists, and that it is a serious one.
"We feel fortunate that we
have such a large space to work
with, and we're always open to
having people come in," Moore
said. "But our calendar is usually
hooked within the first weeks of
school, for months, and it means
that other student groups who
don't get organized right at the
beginning might not have the
space to meet in."
Despite facing their own space
problems, the community centers
are rallying behind the BCSC's
lobbying efforts.
"I think the [BCSC] is the one
that needs the most attention right
now in terms of space, but all of us

had to work a little too hard and
too loud for it to happen," Swai
said. "But the petition is definitely
huge, and (the administration hasj
no choice but to react to it."
The ASSU is also assessing
space issues on campus, but with
somewhat different aims. Two of
their primary goals are to further
the plan fora new student union
and to improve other short-term
space issues, ASSU Vice President
Nick Rodriguez said.
The student union effort is
comprised of a committee that is
currently assessing student space
needs for all of campus by gather
ing student feedback, which will be
used to develop a proposal fora
long-term plan to create more
space for general student needs.

El Centro Chicano is among the many community centers on campus that are in need of storage, meeting and per
formance space. The ASSU hopes that initiatives such as a new student union will eventually ameliorate the crunch.
"However, the space campaign
is much bigger than that; it is an
attempt to lit in all the various
community space needs under
one umbrella, so that they do not
conllict with each other," Ro
driguez said.
Along those lines, Rodriguez
emphasized that while the ASSU
is not directly involved in the
BGSC's petition, the ASSU is in
support of the BCSC's campaign
and does not wish to see its own

efforts detract from the BCSC's
cause.
"The ASSU's role is to help the
general student body to recognize
that the BCSC campaign is not just
a black student issue; it is a Stan
lord student issue," Rodriguez
said. "Therefore, all requests we
make for concessions on [our ef
forts] would come with the dis
claimer: 'but not il it means that we
have to wait longer fora bigger
BCSC.' "
Some of the smaller improve
ments the ASSU is looking at in
clude updating the current space
reservation system, which requires
students to go through a laborious

process to reserve space for pro
grams. Additionally, the ASSU
would like to lower costs to stu
dents who are reserving space. Ro
driguez is hopeful that some
progress will be made on these is
sues this year, as the ASSU lias
begun negotiations with Provost
John Ktchemendy.
"For all students, non-students
ol-color specifically, it's important
that iliey understand that student
space is an issue for all student
groups," Blown said. "Students
should be lighting for the central
ized spaces now, so that in the fu
ture the University knows how im
portant they are to us."
