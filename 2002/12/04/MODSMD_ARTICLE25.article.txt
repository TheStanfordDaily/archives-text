# Forum explores American ideals
## 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR 
Concerned that conversations and personal exchanges
have fallen by the wayside with the proliferation of informa
tion technology, the Department of Continuing Studies is set
to launch a series of informal public conversations aimed at
encouraging face-to-face discussion of issues relevant to the
American experience.
Aurora Forum: Exploring American Ideals, which begins
in January, invites students, faculty and community members
to discuss and exchange perspectives on what is and should be
classified as "American."
" 1 he main purpose of the Aurora Forum is to open and
maintain a public space where people from campus and sur
rounding communities will gather to discuss current issues
and ideas that concern us all," said Mark Gonnerman, forum
co-founder and director of special projects for Continuing
Studies. "With a spirit of open-minded adventure, we intend
to explore America's past and present in search of ideas, mod
els and stories that might help us create a better future."
Many different traditions and rituals are considered a part
of "the American way." But, widi the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks
and the political turmoil that has followed, organizers said
many citizens find themselves unsure about what American
ideals truly are. The Aurora Forum seeks to help by encour
aging and facilitating conversations aimed at pondering these
questions and learning from their answers.
"We believe it is the public responsibility of the University
to host serious conversations about issues of compelling social
and cultural concern," said Dean of Continuing Studies
Charles Junkerman. "This is supposed to be about getting
back on track, and finding hope that the future can be differ

ent from and better than t he present."
While Stanford has many resources and experts in various
fields, ii was not the goal of the creators of the forum to show
rase only University faculty. In fact, great efforts have been
made to "create a dialogue between University scholars and
practitioners out in the field," Junkerman said.
He added, "Whether they come from inside the Universi
ty or outside, we have asked them all to bring stories — stories
about where American ideals are alive and well and how they
are supporting healthy lives and communities."
The format of the events is meant to promote spontaneous,
public conversation and dialogue between presenters and
their audience, which organizers hope will result in a lively,
fun and productive experience.
All forums will take place in Kresge Auditorium at 7:00
p.m. The first, entitled "National Pride, National Shame" will
take place on Jan. 13 and will feature human rights advocate
Angela Davis and Stanford professors philosopher Richard
Rorty and historian Gordon Wood.
Creators are excited and optimistic about the forum's po
tential impact in and beyond the Stanford community.
"So far the response to what we're doing has been tremen
dous," Gonnerman said. "Many members of Stanford's facul
ty and staff have enthusiastically contributed ideas and sup
ported this effort.
"Our university and surrounding communities are full of
open-minded people who wish to be well-informed and bet
ter connected to each other while sharing in the exploration
and implementation of forward-looking ideas and ideals. Our
doors are open to everyone, and we hope that graduate and
undergraduate students will attend our events and get in
volved."
