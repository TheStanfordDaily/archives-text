# Professor plans pre-grad biology research program
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tim Stearns, associate professor of bio
logical sciences and genetics, was recently
appointed to be a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute Professor. HIIMI, a well-known
establishment for research science, award
ed Stearns and 19 other professors $1 mil
lion "to make a statement about the impor
tance of good undergraduate teaching in
the life sciences." Stearns plans to use the
money to create a pre-graduate program
for research-oriented biology students.
His program is designed to address a
problem lie observed during his nine years
of teaching ai Stanford.
"We really don't do a good job serving
the needs of students who are most inter
ested in research. It is very important to
train those people because they will be the
next generation of faculty members and re
searchers," he said.
He compared his proposed program to
(lie already-established pre-medical pro
gram. According to Stearns, biology stu
dents who plan on going to medical school
have a strong support network, but no such
network currently exists for students inter
ested in graduate research.
"I hope to use the money to change
that," Stearns said.
Plans for the pre-graduate program in
clude a lab course, a survey course to give
students a sense of career choices for biolo
gy doctoral students and a cohesive advis
ing program for graduate school and fel
lowship applications.
The lab course, which Stearns will teach
with Assoc. Prof, of Biological Sciences
Martha Cyert, will premiere in winter 2004
and will run over two quarters. In the first
quarter, students will read primary scien
tific literature, and in the second quarter
they will conduct lab experiments on ge
netics and genomics.
"These will be new experiments, mean
ing that we don't know the answer to
them . .. they are real experiments which
make use of today's technology," Stearns
said.
He 112 urther indicated that, in doing these
experiments, "Students get to integrate

knowledge from different fields like genet
ics, computer science and statistical analysis
.. .so it's a very exciting opportunity."
Additionally, any student who com
pletes tlu* course will be given the opportu
nity to attend a national scientific meeting,
like that of the American Society of CJell Bi
ology or the Genetic So< iety of America, in
order to expose students to "the social as
pect of science," Stearns said.
The lab course is geared toward sopho
more students who are either biology ma
jors or non-biology majors who have a
quantitative or interdisciplinary back
ground. Stearns' emphasis is on sopho
mores because "it is important to get stu
dents early on to see how exciting research
can be, and afterwards they can do honors
level research in any bio lab at Stanford."
The lab course illustrates the overarch
ing goal of the program, which Stearns
identified as "conveying the excitement of
doing cutting edge research to students
early in their career to help them make the
decision about whether they want to pui
sne a career in research."
Stearns said that his own decision to
pursue graduate research in biology
sprung from his experiences working in a
lab as an undergraduate at Cornell Uni
versity. "It was a young, exciting lab with
Tom Fox . . . We worked on understand
ing energy production in yeast cells," he
said.
Stearns' current research involves un
derstanding the control mechanism of cell
division using tools of genetics, biochem
istry and cell biology.
Another professor who influenced
Stearns' career is David Botstein, who was
Stearns' doctoral adviser at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology. Botstein, cur
rently a professor of genetics at the School
of Medicine, motivated Stearns to get in
volved in undergraduate teaching.
"David was a big advocate of teaching
and stressed that teaching goes hand in
hand with research — one informs the
other," Stearns said.
Stearns has demonstrated a commit
ment to both research and undergraduate
teaching since he came to Stanford
in 1993. He has taught Biology
116: "Macromolecules," which
evolved into Biology 129: "Cell
Dynamics"; Biology 10: "A Study
of Life from (-ells to Ecosystems"
for non-majors; and a freshman
seminar entitled "Unraveling (lie
Human Genome."
Stearns said he is interested in

teaching lower-level undergradu
ate courses because "students at
thai level ask the most interesting
questions; they haven't been in
doctrinated yet with textbook
knowledge and aren't afraid to ask
questions."
Stearns recommended that cur
rent sophomores who will not be
able to take full advantage of his
up-and-coming pre-graduate pro
gram should try to find a lab in
which they can start doing some
research.
"This can be difficult, be

cause some students find it in
timidating to approach a facul
ty member but they shouldn't
because most faculty members
are thrilled when a student is
interested in their research,"
he said.
Sophomore Emily Ochoa said
she had no problem finding work
in a lab, but added that a pre-grad
uate program would certainly be
helpful to students.
"(A) structured track to grad
school and the ability to interact
with people involved with things

you might like to do in the fu
ture are both important," she
said.
Faculty feedback on the pre
graduate program has been posi
tive, Stearns said.
"Every one I have talked to
about it has been very positive be
cause it is something we should be
doing but haven't because we've
lacked the resources," he said.

setts Institute of Technology. Botstein, cur
rently a professor of genetics at the School
of Medicine, motivated Stearns to get in
volved in undergraduate teaching.
"David was a big advocate of teaching
and stressed that teaching goes hand in
hand with research — one informs the
other," Stearns said.
Stearns has demonstrated a commit
ment to both research and undergraduate
teaching since he came to Stanford
in 1993. He has taught Biology
116: "Macromolecules," which
evolved into Biology 129: "Cell
Dynamics"; Biology 10: "A Study
of Life from (-ells to Ecosystems"
for non-majors; and a freshman
seminar entitled "Unraveling (lie
Human Genome."
Stearns said he is interested in

teaching lower-level undergradu
ate courses because "students at
thai level ask the most interesting
questions; they haven't been in
doctrinated yet with textbook
knowledge and aren't afraid to ask
questions."
Stearns recommended that cur
rent sophomores who will not be
able to take full advantage of his
up-and-coming pre-graduate pro
gram should try to find a lab in
which they can start doing some
research.
"This can be difficult, be

cause some students find it in
timidating to approach a facul
ty member but they shouldn't
because most faculty members
are thrilled when a student is
interested in their research,"
he said.
Sophomore Emily Ochoa said
she had no problem finding work
in a lab, but added that a pre-grad
uate program would certainly be
helpful to students.
"(A) structured track to grad
school and the ability to interact
with people involved with things

you might like to do in the fu
ture are both important," she
said.
Faculty feedback on the pre
graduate program has been posi
tive, Stearns said.
"Every one I have talked to
about it has been very positive be
cause it is something we should be
doing but haven't because we've
lacked the resources," he said.
Students who would like fur
ther information about the pre
grad program should contact
Stearns at stearns@stanford.edu.
Tim Stearns, associate professor of bio
logical sciences and genetics, was recently
appointed to be a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute Professor. HIIMI, a well-known
establishment for research science, award
ed Stearns and 19 other professors $1 mil
lion "to make a statement about the impor
tance of good undergraduate teaching in
the life sciences." Stearns plans to use the
money to create a pre-graduate program
for research-oriented biology students.
His program is designed to address a
problem lie observed during his nine years
of teaching ai Stanford.
"We really don't do a good job serving
the needs of students who are most inter
ested in research. It is very important to
train those people because they will be the
next generation of faculty members and re
searchers," he said.
He compared his proposed program to
(lie already-established pre-medical pro
gram. According to Stearns, biology stu
dents who plan on going to medical school
have a strong support network, but no such
network currently exists for students inter
ested in graduate research.
"I hope to use the money to change
that," Stearns said.
Plans for the pre-graduate program in
clude a lab course, a survey course to give
students a sense of career choices for biolo
gy doctoral students and a cohesive advis
ing program for graduate school and fel
lowship applications.
The lab course, which Stearns will teach
with Assoc. Prof, of Biological Sciences
Martha Cyert, will premiere in winter 2004
and will run over two quarters. In the first
quarter, students will read primary scien
tific literature, and in the second quarter
they will conduct lab experiments on ge
netics and genomics.
"These will be new experiments, mean
ing that we don't know the answer to
them . .. they are real experiments which
make use of today's technology," Stearns
said.
He 112 urther indicated that, in doing these
experiments, "Students get to integrate

knowledge from different fields like genet
ics, computer science and statistical analysis
.. .so it's a very exciting opportunity."
Additionally, any student who com
pletes tlu* course will be given the opportu
nity to attend a national scientific meeting,
like that of the American Society of CJell Bi
ology or the Genetic So< iety of America, in
order to expose students to "the social as
pect of science," Stearns said.
The lab course is geared toward sopho
more students who are either biology ma
jors or non-biology majors who have a
quantitative or interdisciplinary back
ground. Stearns' emphasis is on sopho
mores because "it is important to get stu
dents early on to see how exciting research
can be, and afterwards they can do honors
level research in any bio lab at Stanford."
The lab course illustrates the overarch
ing goal of the program, which Stearns
identified as "conveying the excitement of
doing cutting edge research to students
early in their career to help them make the
decision about whether they want to pui
sne a career in research."
Stearns said that his own decision to
pursue graduate research in biology
sprung from his experiences working in a
lab as an undergraduate at Cornell Uni
versity. "It was a young, exciting lab with
Tom Fox . . . We worked on understand
ing energy production in yeast cells," he
said.
Stearns' current research involves un
derstanding the control mechanism of cell
division using tools of genetics, biochem
istry and cell biology.
