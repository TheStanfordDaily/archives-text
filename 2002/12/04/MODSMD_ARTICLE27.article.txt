# Students help workers break language barrier
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each morning, several people on the Stan
ford campus arrive at work and lind it difficult
to communicate with their employers, co-work
ers and other members of the Stanford com
munity. They are perfectly intelligent people
and have no problems communicating with
family members or community members at
home. There is one simple but significant ob
stacle that they face every day: They speak little
or no English.
In order to help these employees break this
barrier, Stanford students and faculty have
founded two programs to teach English to (lin
ing hall and housing workers. Hie Workplace
English Literacy program, WEL, is slated to
teach about 35 workers job-related vocabulary
and literacy, as well as health safety.
Habla la Not he, a similar program, will pro
vide English lessons for 20 night-shift workers,
primarily janitors, who cannot attend daytime
English classes.
Christine Gabali, head of WEL, said she be
lieves the program is important because there
are a lot of workers who cannot speak English,
which interferes with their ability to do their
jobs and succeed in the workplace.
"[Some] dining hall workers have little to no
literacy in English and in their native lan
guages, mostly Spanish," Gabali said. "We have
some [employees] that don't know how to even
write and read."
Because some workers lack basic literacy
skills in addition to vocabulary, Gabali, who

has taught English as a Second Language
classes before, stressed the fact that WEL is not
an ESL class because it also contains a literacy
component.
"Literacy is understanding what you're
writing, understanding what you're read
ing, understanding how you're speaking
and what you're doing," Gabali said. "It is
very important."
As president of International Alliance in Ser
vice and Education, a larger scale version of
WEL, Gabali said she hopes to put her exper
tise to use at Stanford.
So far, WEL has received a $10,000 grant
from the Philanthropic Venture Foundation.
The money will fx* used to pay for dictionaries,
class supplies, teachers and a secretary.
Additionally, teaching assistants will be paid
$200fortheir work.
Half of the $10,000 grant funds the health
development part of WEL, headed by Dr.
Ernesto Gaona.
Gaona, who also teaches the Spanish literacy
part of WEL, provides information about sani
tation, hygiene, high blood pressure, diabetes
and nutrition. The focus is on healthy living
and preventative health. Instead of having to
be treated for illnesses, workers learn how to
avoid getting sick.
The program, which caters to Spanish- and
Mandarin-speaking workers, started C )ct. 7 and
will run through May. Workers will go to class
once a week and will have work to do outside of
class.
Gabali said that she is pushing to further di
vide the classes into two levels so she can have a

more advanced class for workers with a
stronger background in English. Currently,
WEL does not have enough resources to pro
vide extra classes.
Nonetheless, Gabali said her program has
been a success. According to a test administered
to workers who participated in the pilot pro
gram, workers showed improvement in gram
mar and reading comprehension.
Like WEL, I labia la Noche serves workers
who cannot attend other English classes. In
stead of serving day workers, I labia la Noche
c aters to night-shift workers, mostly janitors.
Habla la Noche president Kelly Wells said
there is a lot of need for this year-round pro
gram.
"Since most of the campus ESL classes for
workers are given by volunteers, many workers
simply aren't being accommodated, either be
cause the well-established programs were at
their c apacity, or because the workers' lunch
breaks when most classes take place were at a
time that was inconvenient for volunteers," said
Wells, who is also the liaison to the SEIU Local
1877, the union to which most of the tutors and
tutees belong.
In order to provide a time acceptable to both
students and workers, classes are held every
Tuesday and Thursday from 10 to 11 p.m. in
the El Centro Chicano lounge. On an average
night, there are about 20 student volunteer
teachers and 20 workers.
Most of the students are new to teaching,
although some have taught ESL classes be-
fore. Wells emphasized that stu
dents will acquire better teaching
skills from the experience. In ad
dition to teaching experience,
Wells mentioned other advan
tages to her program.
"The tutoring sessions are mu
tually beneficial," Wells said. "Be

cause we hold group tutoring ses
sions, tutors learn a lot about
teaching from each other and
from their tutees. Furthermore,
people involved in die program
tend to form strong personal
bonds, and whether they're gen
erally politically active or not —
and many of our participants
aren't — it is a solid base on which
students and workers can support
each other on both a political and
a personal level."

Gaona, who also teaches the Spanish literacy
part of WEL, provides information about sani
tation, hygiene, high blood pressure, diabetes
and nutrition. The focus is on healthy living
and preventative health. Instead of having to
be treated for illnesses, workers learn how to
avoid getting sick.
The program, which caters to Spanish- and
Mandarin-speaking workers, started C )ct. 7 and
will run through May. Workers will go to class
once a week and will have work to do outside of
class.
Gabali said that she is pushing to further di
vide the classes into two levels so she can have a

more advanced class for workers with a
stronger background in English. Currently,
WEL does not have enough resources to pro
vide extra classes.
Nonetheless, Gabali said her program has
been a success. According to a test administered
to workers who participated in the pilot pro
gram, workers showed improvement in gram
mar and reading comprehension.
Like WEL, I labia la Noche serves workers
who cannot attend other English classes. In
stead of serving day workers, I labia la Noche
c aters to night-shift workers, mostly janitors.
Habla la Noche president Kelly Wells said
there is a lot of need for this year-round pro
gram.
"Since most of the campus ESL classes for
workers are given by volunteers, many workers
simply aren't being accommodated, either be
cause the well-established programs were at
their c apacity, or because the workers' lunch
breaks when most classes take place were at a
time that was inconvenient for volunteers," said
Wells, who is also the liaison to the SEIU Local
1877, the union to which most of the tutors and
tutees belong.
In order to provide a time acceptable to both
students and workers, classes are held every
Tuesday and Thursday from 10 to 11 p.m. in
the El Centro Chicano lounge. On an average
night, there are about 20 student volunteer
teachers and 20 workers.
Most of the students are new to teaching,
although some have taught ESL classes be-
fore. Wells emphasized that stu
dents will acquire better teaching
skills from the experience. In ad
dition to teaching experience,
Wells mentioned other advan
tages to her program.
"The tutoring sessions are mu
tually beneficial," Wells said. "Be

cause we hold group tutoring ses
sions, tutors learn a lot about
teaching from each other and
from their tutees. Furthermore,
people involved in die program
tend to form strong personal
bonds, and whether they're gen
erally politically active or not —
and many of our participants
aren't — it is a solid base on which
students and workers can support
each other on both a political and
a personal level."
Each morning, several people on the Stan
ford campus arrive at work and lind it difficult
to communicate with their employers, co-work
ers and other members of the Stanford com
munity. They are perfectly intelligent people
and have no problems communicating with
family members or community members at
home. There is one simple but significant ob
stacle that they face every day: They speak little
or no English.
In order to help these employees break this
barrier, Stanford students and faculty have
founded two programs to teach English to (lin
ing hall and housing workers. Hie Workplace
English Literacy program, WEL, is slated to
teach about 35 workers job-related vocabulary
and literacy, as well as health safety.
Habla la Not he, a similar program, will pro
vide English lessons for 20 night-shift workers,
primarily janitors, who cannot attend daytime
English classes.
Christine Gabali, head of WEL, said she be
lieves the program is important because there
are a lot of workers who cannot speak English,
which interferes with their ability to do their
jobs and succeed in the workplace.
"[Some] dining hall workers have little to no
literacy in English and in their native lan
guages, mostly Spanish," Gabali said. "We have
some [employees] that don't know how to even
write and read."
Because some workers lack basic literacy
skills in addition to vocabulary, Gabali, who

has taught English as a Second Language
classes before, stressed the fact that WEL is not
an ESL class because it also contains a literacy
component.
"Literacy is understanding what you're
writing, understanding what you're read
ing, understanding how you're speaking
and what you're doing," Gabali said. "It is
very important."
As president of International Alliance in Ser
vice and Education, a larger scale version of
WEL, Gabali said she hopes to put her exper
tise to use at Stanford.
So far, WEL has received a $10,000 grant
from the Philanthropic Venture Foundation.
The money will fx* used to pay for dictionaries,
class supplies, teachers and a secretary.
Additionally, teaching assistants will be paid
$200fortheir work.
Half of the $10,000 grant funds the health
development part of WEL, headed by Dr.
Ernesto Gaona.
