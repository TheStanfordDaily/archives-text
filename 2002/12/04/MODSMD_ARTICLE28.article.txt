# Applications increase at colleges nationwide
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Universities across the nation
have witnessed an increase in the
number of undergraduate appli
cants over the past couple of
years, growth that is expected to
continue over the next 10 years.
Despite the national trend, the
number of applicants to Stanford
over the past five years has re
mained at a relatively constant
19,000.
A report issued by the Depart
ment of Education estimated that
total college enrollment will grow
from 14.8 million students in 1999
to 17.7 million in 2011, an increase
of about 20 percent.
The surge at the national level is
attributed to a boom in the high
school population, coupled with a
tendency among contemporary
students to apply to more colleges.
"It's the perfect storm of college
admissions, all these forces coming
together at the same time," Direc

tor of College Counseling at Our
Lady of Good Counsel High
School David Hamilton told the
Associated Press.
An estimated 3.1 million high
school seniors are predicted to
graduate next June, and the boom
is expected to continue through
the end of the decade.
According to Robert Franek,
editorial director of the Princeton
Review, five years ago high school
seniors applied to an average of
five or six colleges. Recent esti
mates indicate that an average high
school senior will apply to as many
as 10 schools, Franek said.
He attributed the increase in
part to improved technology in
the mid-'9os, like the introduction
of online application forms that
reduce the amount of time stu
dents spend filling out personal
information.
