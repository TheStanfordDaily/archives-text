## Men get by Portland, Furman; 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
Everything seems to point to a
second straight College Cup Final
Four berth lor the Cardinal men's
soccer team.
Both Furman and Clemson
have done Stanford huge favors
by knocking oil eighth-seeded
Virginia C bmmonwealth and top
seeded Wake Forest, respectively,
giving the (lardinal home field ad
vantage through the NCAA Quar
terfinals.
Not to mention that Stanford
has somehow managed to escape
with a penalty shootout win and a
double-overtime victory in the
past week.
After a late-season struggle full
of bad luck and nothing going its
way, things seem to be turning
around for the No. 9 Cardinal
(15-4-2) at the right time.
If Stanford can beat No. 14
Clemson (14-4-3) at Maloney
Field this Saturday, the Cardinal

Men's Soccer
vs. Clemson, Saturday, 7:00 p.m
NCAA Quarterfinals

will earn an opportunity to battle
for the NCAA championship with
three other teams in Dallas, start
ing on Dec. 13.
In the past two games, Stan
ford has shown that it not only
boasts a lineup filled with nation
ally recognized soccer talents; the
past week also displayed the im
portance of team unity and will as
the Cardinal has almost complete
ly relied on heart to advance to the
quarterfinals.
At the end of both NCAA
matches it has played so far, Stan
ford owned a lopsided advantage
in shots, but as had been the case
toward the end of the season, not
a lot of its shots translated into
goals. Despite the frustration of
not consistently finishing its scor
ing opportunities, Stanford was
still able to produce victories,
mostly on the heroics of a few

players, including Robby Fulton,
Roger Levesque, Todd Dunivant
and Chad Marshall.
Fven though fans had to en
dure some possible heart-attack
inducing moments in the past two
games, Stanford displayed its re
silience and courage in somehow
managing to get the job done.
Besides having a home crowd,
the Cardinal will head into the
Clemson match with high confi
dence and great team spirit.
Returning to the starting line
up will be sophomore midfielder
James Twellman, who was sus
pended lor the Furman match
due to a red card (language) in the
previous Portland game.
However, Stanford will lace a
still test against the Tigers, who
are coming off a stunning 2-1
upset over Wake Forest, the No.
1-ranked team in the country at
the time.
