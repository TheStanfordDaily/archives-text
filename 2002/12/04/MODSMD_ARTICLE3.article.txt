# Skeptics question G-CEP sponsorship
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
After last month's announce
ment that Stanford was embarking
upon an "unprecedented" $225
million partnership with multi-na
tional energy corporations to devel
op technologies that minimize
greenhouse gas emissions and slow
global climate change, some mem
bers of the Stanford community
have questioned how the University
can maintain its academic integrity
while working so closely with pri
vate sector interests.
Organizers of the Global Cli
mate and Energy Project, fund
ed by ExxonMobil, General
Electric, Schlumberger and
E.ON, say the program is set up
to maintain research indepen
dence while benefiting from the
feedback and real-world market
expertise of corporations.
Some students and faculty, how
ever, have questioned the role of
corporate sponsors in releasing
money for G-CEP research, the
ethics of giving sponsor companies
rights for five years on the license to
technologies and patents that grow
out of the program, and whether
the project will put sufficient re
sources into energy sources that are
not in the direct interests of the

funding corporations.
Independent research or
corporate direction?
Project organizers have empha
sized that G-CEP is designed to en
sure that Stanford researchers are
given "a great deal of latitude" in
conducting research and that its
agenda will be based upon science,
not corporate interests. Some facul
ty and students, though, have ques
tioned whether the project's struc
ture gives researchers sufficient au
tonomy to proceed with whatever
research they deem necessary using
project funds.
According to Project Director
Lynn Orr, professor of petroleum
engineering and former earth sci
ences dean, G-CEP researchers,
ranging from Stanford faculty to ex
perts from around the world, will
hold workshops to discuss what as
pects of the project's broad scope
should be tackled. After these prior
ities are set, researchers will draft
proposals to present to G-CEP
sponsors, and the sponsors will de
cide, based on the merits of the pro
posal, whether they will release
funds to support that research.
"In essence, it works like any
other science or engineering pro-

amongst the University, though organizers and faculty are generally optimistic.
posal process," Orr said.
G-CEP Deputy Director Christopher
Edwards, associate professor of mechanical
engineering, said that researchers do not
have to go to sponsors for approval of spe
cific research; they will only be called upon
to release funds when researchers are look
ing to move into a new broad research area
within G-CEP, such as advanced trans
portation systems or production, distribu
tion and use of hydrogen.
"There's a management committee
which is representatives from the sponsors,
and their job is to release money, not decide

what to fund," Edwards said. "Whenever
we're ready with a new area, we say, 'This is
the area, this is what we want to do, you can
either put your thumbs up or thumbs
down.' And we expect thumbs up."
Similar programs at other universities
generally are not set up to involve sponsors
in the direction of research, but On said that
because of the scope of G-CEP, it was neces
sary to include the sponsors in the process.
"I think [the management committee]
is more of a recognition that, because of
the breadth here, we needed a step-by
step process," Orr said. "It wasn't an item
of controversy."
Though the creation of the program was
unusual as it was handled largely through
the offices of the deans of engineering and
earth sciences, Orr said, faculty were in

volved and called for G-CEP to be created in
a way that assured research independence.
The partnership also does not prohibit
any of the parties from proceeding inde
pendently with research outside of the
terms of G-CEP that may be objectionable
to a participant.
"The agreement specifically says that
everyone is free to work on the same stuff
with other support or different support,"
()rr said, emphasizing that in the event that
G-CEP sponsors do not release money for
research on a specific area, Stanford could
pursue other sources for funding. "There is
no way that [the sponsors] can make us do
anything that we feel is inappropriate or
keep us from doing something we feel isap-
propriate."
Nonetheless, some argue that
the flexibility built into the program
is merely nominal and that witiiout
the approval ofG-CEP sponsors, it is
unlikely that other research will Ix*
carried out, preventing research
not in the interest of the corporate
sponsors from being conducted de
spite its merits.
"The control by the donating
companies is pretty explicit," said ju
nior Cody Taylor, an earth systems
major in the energy science and
technology track. "Lynn Orr claims,
'It doesn't matter; they don't have
control over research. If they don't
want it, they don't fund it,' which
says to me that they do have control
over it — if they don't fund it, it
doesn't get done."
When asked if ExxonMobil, lor
its part, would support research that
may be counter to its corporate in
terests, spokesperson Cynthia
Langlands said that "there are no
research areas oil the table," includ
ing renewable resources, one aspect
of energy research many fear may
be overlooked in G-CEP.
"No one company has veto
power over decisions," Langlands
said. . . Independence is essential
to the success of the project."
Corporate incentives,
humanitarian incentives
Orr has challenged those skepti
cal of corporate involvement in G
CEP, arguing that they hold an in
correct "underlying assumption"
that "because companies are in
volved they somehow want us to do
something inappropriate."
Many have been especially skep
tical of ExxonMobil's $100 million
pledge to a program focusing on

minimizing greenhouse gas emis
sions and their effects because the
company has not formally acknowl
edged that these gases lead to cli
mate change, instead arguing that it
has a "potential" impact and war
rants more research.
G-CEP's sponsor corporations
do stand to gain from the project,
but organizers argue that their role
will also enhance the positive hu
manitarian effects.
(i-( HEP is largely a technology de
velopment project, and the Univer
sity will hold all legal rights to infor
mation and technology produced
through it and all patents sought lor
developed technologies. However,
sponsor companies will be given a
"royalty free license" to use technol
ogy for the first live years after it is
produced. Alter that live-year peri
od, Stanford or the sponsor compa
nies can grant licenses to other bod
ies; though details have not been fi
nalized, other organizations will
probably have to pay a lee lor access
to the technology.
Orr argued that this arrange
ment would "in no way lock up
technology," and that the licensing
arrangement would be of general
advantage because it would expe
dite the introduction of new, benefi
cial energy technologies into the
marketplace.
"If[the sponsor companies] are
going to get any jump on the com
petition, they've got to get right on
it," Orr said, emphasizing that
with a project like G-CEP that will
explore technologies that will af
fect decades of change, five years
will be a relatively negligible
amount of time.
Orr added that all research re
sults will be made public immediate
ly, so other organizations can begin
working internally on the new tech
nologies until they are licensed to
produce them.
Other faculty have argued that

the restrictive licensing would in
stead prevent the new products
from permeating the marketplace.
"I think it's a burden," said David
Ritson, emeritus professor of
physics. "If you have a five-year
delay or if you have to reproduce re
sults, you're giving the sponsors a
clear edge ... and they are getting a
capability trom Stanford at a very
cheap price."
The technology that comes out of
G-CEP could also help its sponsors
prepare for stricter government en
vironmental regulations that could
be enacted in coming years.
David Victor, a senior fellow at
the Institute for International Stud
ies who does work in environmental
policy, said that the speed with
which G-CEP was formed — the
entire process took about a year and
a half— may signal a desire on the
part of corporations to "get out in
front" of policy while they are not
being significantly pushed to clean
up their acts under the current
Bush administration.
"I think you're seeing a huge
bunch of firms say, 'We're not lacing
urgent climate controls now, but we
may in lOyears,' "Victor said. "When
regulation comes, they're ready.
"If you design a terrible policy, it
can cost two, five, 10 times as much
money to deal with the problem,"
he said.
Organizers emphasize that the
partnership between industry and
academia that characterizes G-CEP
enables good science to become
marketable technology, making
corporations essential in proliferat
ing the more energy-elficient and
climate-conscious technologies the
project will create.
"I don't see how anybody can be
serious about looking into new tech
nologies without speaking closely
with people who are supposed to put
those technologies into place," Victor
said. "If you're going to do some

thing on this sc;de, you cannot avoid
11< >r si u >uld y< >u try to av< >i< 1 a cl< >sc re
lationship with exactly the people
these people are working vviih."
Stephen Schneider, professor of
biological sciences, said that the
public should congratulate Exxon-
Mobil lor "coming out ol the closet"
and addressing climate change is
sues after years of downplaying
their importance.
"You've got to have the Exxons
of the world on board if you're
going to solve the climate pr< >blem,"
he said.
For ExxonMobil, G-CEP also is
an opportunity to explore other
technologies that would be prof
itable It>r the c<>ll x>ration to invest in
as the future of energy sources shili,
such as renewable energy sources.
". . . Solar and wind will be ex
plored as part of a full portfolio of
energy options," Langlands said.
"In our experience, those tec hnolo
gies are not yet commercially viable
for widespread deployment. De
pending on the outcome ol the G
CEP research, that could change if
breakthrough technologies can be
developed. If the prospects for re
newables improve in years ahead,
we would reconsider our invest
ment in renewables."
'Short shrift' for renewable
resources?
The biggest concern among stu
dent and faculty regarding G-CEP
may be that it will not adecjuately ex
plore technology to propagate ener
gy from renewable resources, instead
focusing on cleaner ways to use lossil
fuels and other sources, which are
currently the primary business of the
sponsor corporations. While explo
ration of renewable resources is iden
tified a,s one of the broad research
areas in the G-CEP plan, there is no
guarantee that researchers will select
this area as a focus, or that sponsors
would agree to fund such research,

as companies like Exxon have seen ii
as uneconomical.
"The environmental groups
have been pushing very hard on re
newable energy, and renewable en
erg)' is certainly going to get short
shrili on this," Ritson said. "One of
the issues | will 1 G-CEP] is very sim
ple— are you distorting the re
search? II you get a university i<>
concentrate its eflbrts on energy
supply, hut not on demand and
conservation, then the research is
distorted, and you have a political
agenda."
To Taylor, using such a large
sum of money to continue research
on energy sources th.it he sees as
damaging is a misallocation of cov
eted funds.
"Asl see it now, the project is pre
pared to sort of bandage over dam
age that's being done by looking at
these technologies such as carbon
dioxide and just enables us to con
tinue unsustainable patterns of re
source use by other ideas like non
combustible engines, not changing
our approach to how we use ener
gy," he said. "The whole premise of
this project is to confuse the current
climate science."
Schneider argued that, ideally,
the program would be designed
with more balance with a carved out
place for research on renewable en
ergy sources. However, he said G
CEP must be seen as positive as long
as it makes progress on the broader
issue of climate change, regardless
of how that progress is achieved.
" 11 is nc >t Stanfc>rd'sjc>b t<) 1 lave 11 it*
correct balance we think the world
needs," he said. "As long as what
they're doing is an advance and an
improvement, that's okay with me."
Victor said, "I don't think we
should, at the beginning, stack the
deck lor or against petroleum fuels
or for or against renewable
fuels ... Folks are going to be upset
il we say the only solution there is is

large-scale renewable power."
Optimism among facultv
Despite skepticism among some,
many faculty members do not view
G-CEP's relationship with corpo
rate sponsors as a conflict of interest
and, whatever direction the projects
takes, see it as a "no lose" situation.
Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Assoc. Prof Mark Jacobson
said that any project where lorces
outside of acadcmia have control
over research can mitigate its efficacy.
"It will gain stronger credibility if
it is banc ls-011, and the projects are re
lated to addressing c limate change is
sues from a variety of perspectives,"
he said. "II it's hands-on, then it's
going to narrow the scope of the pro
ject, then it won't be too beneficial."
Jacobson did not see this as a
problem in the structure of G-CEP.
"From my understanding, the
sponsors have a limited impact on
what is researched so long as the
goal of the research is to slow global
warming," Jacobson said. "I don't
think you can look at this negative
ly— the alternative is (that the
sponsors] don't contribute, but then
nothing gets done."
While the sc ale of G-CEP is un
precedented, other universities
house similar projects and have not
found relationships with corporate
sponsors as a barrier to research. At
Princeton, the $20 million plus Car
bon Mitigation Initiative is funded
by BP and Ford.
Henry Jacoby, co-director of
MITs Joint Program of the Science
and Policy of Global Change , said
that in 11 years he has had no prob
lems with corporate sponsors in di
recting research.
"My expectation is that they will
not mess with you if Stanford makes
good technical decisions," he said.
"Let me put it this way — they know
what they're doing when they go to
a university."
