# Skeptics question G-CEP sponsorship

### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
After last month's announce
ment that Stanford was embarking
upon an "unprecedented" $225
million partnership with multi-na
tional energy corporations to devel
op technologies that minimize
greenhouse gas emissions and slow
global climate change, some mem
bers of the Stanford community
have questioned how the University
can maintain its academic integrity
while working so closely with pri
vate sector interests.
Organizers of the Global Cli
mate and Energy Project, fund
ed by ExxonMobil, General
Electric, Schlumberger and
E.ON, say the program is set up
to maintain research indepen
dence while benefiting from the
feedback and real-world market
expertise of corporations.
Some students and faculty, how
ever, have questioned the role of
corporate sponsors in releasing
money for G-CEP research, the
ethics of giving sponsor companies
rights for five years on the license to
technologies and patents that grow
out of the program, and whether
the project will put sufficient re
sources into energy sources that are
not in the direct interests of the

funding corporations.
Independent research or
corporate direction?
Project organizers have empha
sized that G-CEP is designed to en
sure that Stanford researchers are
given "a great deal of latitude" in
conducting research and that its
agenda will be based upon science,
not corporate interests. Some facul
ty and students, though, have ques
tioned whether the project's struc
ture gives researchers sufficient au
tonomy to proceed with whatever
research they deem necessary using
project funds.
According to Project Director
Lynn Orr, professor of petroleum
engineering and former earth sci
ences dean, G-CEP researchers,
ranging from Stanford faculty to ex
perts from around the world, will
hold workshops to discuss what as
pects of the project's broad scope
should be tackled. After these prior
ities are set, researchers will draft
proposals to present to G-CEP
sponsors, and the sponsors will de
cide, based on the merits of the pro
posal, whether they will release
funds to support that research.
"In essence, it works like any
other science or engineering pro-

on the $225 million initiative announced last month to research energy tech

amongst the University, though organizers and faculty are generally optimistic.
