# Volleyball earns No. 2 seed for NCAA tourney
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For most people at Stanford, the Thanksgiving
break wasn't long enough — a four-day tease of a va
cation, at best, leading to the gloom of Dead Week
and finals.
For the Cardinal women's volleyball team (27-4),
on the other hand, last week's holiday was just what
the doctor ordered ... quite literally even.

vs. Sacramento St., Friday, 7:30 p.m., NCAA First Round
Stanford/Sacramento St. winner vs. Pacific/Nevada winner,
Saturday, 7:00 p.m., NCAA Second Round

A four-day break from the hardwood last Wednes
day through Saturday has left a Cardinal squad that
was reeling from sickness, fatigue and injury — most
ly from a nine-match span against teams in or near
the top 25 to dose out the regular season — as healthy
and fresh as it has been all season.
And upon the players' return to the gym on Sun
day, there was a lovely surprise waiting for them cour
tesy of the NCAA: the No. 2 seed for the NCAA tour
nament, which kicks oil this weekend.
That seeding means the defending national cham
pions will get to play at home through the first four
rounds should it keep winning every match leading
up to the Final Four, which will take place in New Or
leans Dec. 19 to Dec. 21.
The Cardinal's quest fora sixth national title starts
on Friday against Sacramento State at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
"We're thrilled about the next six matches," said
junior setter Anna Robinson. We know we rein a
good position | in the bracket], better than at times we

had hoped. We need to do the best
we can with that and play our best
matches from here on out.
"The break has been fabulous
for all of us. All of our bodies are
really fresh light now, and we're
going really hard in practice be
cause we're physically and menial
ly able to."
A reinvigorated Cardinal spells
trouble for the teams headed to
Maples for the first two rounds this
weekend.
And with senior outside hitter
Logan Tom's thumb no longer a
concern, backup freshman setter
Katie Goldhahn's ankle ready to
go, and the rest of the players
over the various bugs that caught
the team late in the year, the Car
dinal is in perfect position to
peak at just the right time during
the tournament.
"For the first time in three
months, we looked like we had
fresh legs in practice," coach John
Dunning said. "We weren't rusty
at all. We have some good stull'be
hind us this season, but the key is
whether we keep improving. We
have some room to get better. We
talk about that at the beginning of
practice, why we have to get better
and how we're going to do it.
That's the goal for us."
That the Cardinal could get bet
ter is a scary thought to everyone
in the field. Stanford is already one
of the most overpowering teams in
the country, leading the Pacific-10
Conference — which, along with
the Big Ten, led all conferences

with eight teams placed in the
NCAA field — in hitting percent
age and blocking.
Four Stanford players ranked
in the top 10 in hitting percentage
in the Pac-10, led by junior mid
dle blocker Sara McGee, who
topped the conference with a .428
average. McGee and junior mid
dle blocker Jenn Harvey led the
conference in blocks. And Tom,
the Pac-10 Player of the Year for
the second straight season, and
sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani combined for
nearly nine kills per game as one
of the strongest tandems of hitters
in the NCAA.
All that makes Stanford's lirst
round match against Sacramento
State (24-10) look pretty lopsided,
but the Cardinal isn't looking past
the Hornets just yet.
"Anybody that's made the
NCAA tournament has proved
themselves throughout the year,"

Nnamani said. "Everybody is play
ing every game like it's their last,
and every play is at the highest
level. You can't look forward to the
next match. You play each team
each night and give it all you have
every night."
The Hornets were a bit of a sur
prise entry in the field, earning
their way in by knocking oil 17th
ranked Eastern Washington in the
finals of the Big Sky Conference
tournament, which shockingly left
the 29-2 Eagles out of the NCAA
tournament.
Sacramento State triumphed in
the Big Sky tourney thanks to
huge performances from junior
setter Lisa Beauchene, who was
named tournament MVP after
posting a pair of rare triple-dou
bles.
Outside hitters Jayme Wright
and Sandra Bandmire also added
some double-doubles in the Hor
nets' two matches, though they will

face their toughest test of the year
going up against the Cardinal's
block.
However, Stanford will have to
find a way to slow Beauchene,
who isn't afraid to attack, posting
a team-high .373 hitting percent
age during the season. The Car
dinal has not defended quick at
tacks especially well this year, and
its ability to cover the area
around the three-meter line
could be key.
"Sacramento State has always
been well-coached," Dunning said.
"They are always fighters. They al
ways win matches that leave peo
ple surprised."
In Saturday's second round at
7:00 p.m., the Stanford-Sacramen
to State winner will take on the
winner of Friday's early match be
tween Pacific and Nevada, who will
face oil at Maples at 5:30 p.m.
The Cardinal knocked off Pacif
ic 3-0 in Stockton in October. Dun

ning coached at Pacific for 16 years
and won two national titles before
coming to Stanford last year. Stan
ford last saw the Wolf Pack in the
first round ol last year's NCAA tour

nament at Stanford, with the Cardi
nal easily winning in three games.
Both Nevada and Pacific are
coached by former players of Dun
ning, when he was at Pacific.
