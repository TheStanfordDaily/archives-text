Wednesday: Stanford 0, Portland 0

Sunday: Stanford 1, Furman 0, 20T,
NCAA Third Round

And ( .)1 corner kicks into the
season, Marshall still had not col
lected his first career goal.
But in the No. 9 Cardinal's (15-
4-2) third-round NCAA match
against No. 8 Furman (19-3-1) at
Maloney Field on Sunday, Mar
shall's persistence finally paid off.
1 lis first goal as a Cardinal will
forever be etched in Stanford lore
as the game winner in its 2-1 dou
ble-overtime victory over Furman.
In the seventh minute of the
second overtime, defender
Todd Dunivant sent a corner
kick over the penalty box, and
the cross found Marshall's head
at the far post.
Marshall made solid contact
and sent the hall off the leg of a
Furman defender into the goal,
keeping Stanford's hope for its
first-ever men's soccer champi
onship alive.
The win gives the Cardinal an
opportunity to earn a second
straight trip to the College Cup
Final Four in Dallas when it faces
Clemson in a quarterfinal match
this Saturday at 7:00 p.m. at Mal
oney Field.
Stanford won 10-9 on penalty
kicks against Portland earlier in
the week to reach Sunday's
match.
"We've had a number of diffi
cult games and a lot of tight cir
cumstances in games," Simon
said. "A lot oftimes we could have
folded. To the players' credit,
they have risen above it continu
ally, and it's just a tremendous
group of guys. I'm very excited

that 1 have another week with
them, and hopefully longer."
In the second half of the Fur
man match, the home crowd of
1,138 saw exactly what Simon
meant.
Even without the services of
James Twellman (red card) and
with senior All-Pat-10 forward
Roger Levesque playing through
a stomach ailment, the Cardinal
came out with intense offensive
pressure in the first half.
Unfortunately, ii was playing
against a Furman defense that
had recorded a NCAA-record 11
straight shutouts entering Sun
day's game.
Despite outshooting its oppo
nent 9-4 in the first half, the Car

dinal could not beat Furman
keeper Alex Maslow, who was
playing at the lop of his game with
12 saves.
Even more demoralizing, Fur
man took a 1-0 lead into halftime
when Clint Dempsey headed a
ball past Stanford keeper Robby
Fulton in the 35th minute.
However, the Cardinal
charged back onto the field with
rekindled offensive fury in the
second half. In the 76th minute,
Dunivant, after almost losing the
ball over the touch line, found an
open Mike Wilson making a run
to the top of the box.
The junior midfielder was

able to muscle a left-footed shot
into the right side of the net for
the equalizer.
Stanford continued to wear
down the Furman defense, as it
recorded a ridiculous 23-9 shot
advantage in the match.
Fora while, it seemed as if Sun
day's match would be determined
in the same way as Stanford's sec
ond-round game last Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Stanford was
able to squeeze out a nerve-rack
ing win against No. 16 Portland
(13-6-1) by eking out a 10-9 ad
vantage in the most epic penalty
ki< k shootouts in recent memory.
Alter a relatively unspectacular
99 minutes of scoreless play, things
started to get interesting.
With 16 seconds left in the first
overtime, Levesque frantically
chased down a lob and collided
with the Pilots keeper. Alter a con
troversial no-call, Twellman's
mouth got him into trouble as lie
was immediately issued a red card.
Despite playing a man down for
the second overtime, Stanford was
able to push the match to penalty
kicks.
After the reliable Dunivant
missed the first shot in the
shootout, the Pilots found them
selves in control.

But Fulton had other ideas.
After making a diving save on
Pilots' leading scorer Nate Jaqua's
shot, the shootout was again dead
locked.
With the score reaching 8-8, the
Cardinal's own leading scorer
Levesque missed, leaving Fulton
with the unenviable task of saving
Stanford's season.
But with nerves of steel, Fulton
made another miraculous save,
and Stanford was still in the tour
nament.
After Dunivant and Mali/a took
care of business on the shootout's
second cycle, Fulton made his
third save of the shootout for the
Cardinal win.
"They kept on shooting right
down the middle," Fulton said. "I
wasn't very successful for the first

All of these heroics might not
have been possible without the
support of a home crowd. The
Cardinal was actually slated to host
only its second-round match, but
with a few upsets around the
NCAA bracket, Stanford has the
opportunity to earn a semifinal

But in the No. 9 Cardinal's (15-
4-2) third-round NCAA match
against No. 8 Furman (19-3-1) at
Maloney Field on Sunday, Mar
shall's persistence finally paid off.
1 lis first goal as a Cardinal will
forever be etched in Stanford lore
as the game winner in its 2-1 dou
ble-overtime victory over Furman.
In the seventh minute of the
second overtime, defender
Todd Dunivant sent a corner
kick over the penalty box, and
the cross found Marshall's head
at the far post.
Marshall made solid contact
and sent the hall off the leg of a
Furman defender into the goal,
keeping Stanford's hope for its
first-ever men's soccer champi
onship alive.
The win gives the Cardinal an
opportunity to earn a second
straight trip to the College Cup
Final Four in Dallas when it faces
Clemson in a quarterfinal match
this Saturday at 7:00 p.m. at Mal
oney Field.
Stanford won 10-9 on penalty
kicks against Portland earlier in
the week to reach Sunday's
match.
"We've had a number of diffi
cult games and a lot of tight cir
cumstances in games," Simon
said. "A lot oftimes we could have
folded. To the players' credit,
they have risen above it continu
ally, and it's just a tremendous
group of guys. I'm very excited

that 1 have another week with
them, and hopefully longer."
In the second half of the Fur
man match, the home crowd of
1,138 saw exactly what Simon
meant.
Even without the services of
James Twellman (red card) and
with senior All-Pat-10 forward
Roger Levesque playing through
a stomach ailment, the Cardinal
came out with intense offensive
pressure in the first half.
Unfortunately, ii was playing
against a Furman defense that
had recorded a NCAA-record 11
straight shutouts entering Sun
day's game.
Despite outshooting its oppo
nent 9-4 in the first half, the Car

dinal could not beat Furman
keeper Alex Maslow, who was
playing at the lop of his game with
12 saves.
Even more demoralizing, Fur
man took a 1-0 lead into halftime
when Clint Dempsey headed a
ball past Stanford keeper Robby
Fulton in the 35th minute.
However, the Cardinal
charged back onto the field with
rekindled offensive fury in the
second half. In the 76th minute,
Dunivant, after almost losing the
ball over the touch line, found an
open Mike Wilson making a run
to the top of the box.
The junior midfielder was

able to muscle a left-footed shot
into the right side of the net for
the equalizer.
Stanford continued to wear
down the Furman defense, as it
recorded a ridiculous 23-9 shot
advantage in the match.
Fora while, it seemed as if Sun
day's match would be determined
in the same way as Stanford's sec
ond-round game last Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Stanford was
able to squeeze out a nerve-rack
ing win against No. 16 Portland
(13-6-1) by eking out a 10-9 ad
vantage in the most epic penalty
ki< k shootouts in recent memory.
Alter a relatively unspectacular
99 minutes of scoreless play, things
started to get interesting.
With 16 seconds left in the first
overtime, Levesque frantically
chased down a lob and collided
with the Pilots keeper. Alter a con
troversial no-call, Twellman's
mouth got him into trouble as lie
was immediately issued a red card.
Despite playing a man down for
the second overtime, Stanford was
able to push the match to penalty
kicks.
After the reliable Dunivant
missed the first shot in the
shootout, the Pilots found them
selves in control.

But Fulton had other ideas.
After making a diving save on
Pilots' leading scorer Nate Jaqua's
shot, the shootout was again dead
locked.
With the score reaching 8-8, the
Cardinal's own leading scorer
Levesque missed, leaving Fulton
with the unenviable task of saving
Stanford's season.
But with nerves of steel, Fulton
made another miraculous save,
and Stanford was still in the tour
nament.
After Dunivant and Mali/a took
care of business on the shootout's
second cycle, Fulton made his
third save of the shootout for the
Cardinal win.
"They kept on shooting right
down the middle," Fulton said. "I
wasn't very successful for the first
11.1 kept on saying to myself, 'I 've
got to stop one of these.' 1 stayed
on it and I reacted. I was fortunate
it was right down the middle."
All of these heroics might not
have been possible without the
support of a home crowd. The
Cardinal was actually slated to host
only its second-round match, but
with a few upsets around the
NCAA bracket, Stanford has the
opportunity to earn a semifinal
berth at home.
Come this Saturday, the home
crowd will certainly be more than
happy to once again urge its "all
heart, no-quit" squad to another
College Cup appearance.
Charged with the duty of
clearing balls away from 11is
goal, Stanford's 6-loot-3 fresh
man defender Chad Marshall
does not get too many scoring
opportunities.
However, with Marshall's size,
Stanford head coach Bret Simon
utilizes his leaping ability on Car
dinal corner kit ks.
