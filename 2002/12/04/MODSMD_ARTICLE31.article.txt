Charged with the duty of
clearing balls away from 11is
goal, Stanford's 6-loot-3 fresh
man defender Chad Marshall
does not get too many scoring
opportunities.
However, with Marshall's size,
Stanford head coach Bret Simon
utilizes his leaping ability on Car

And ( .)1 corner kicks into the
season, Marshall still had not col
lected his first career goal.
But in the No. 9 Cardinal's (15-
4-2) third-round NCAA match
against No. 8 Furman (19-3-1) at
Maloney Field on Sunday, Mar
shall's persistence finally paid off.
1 lis first goal as a Cardinal will
forever be etched in Stanford lore
as the game winner in its 2-1 dou
ble-overtime victory over Furman.
In the seventh minute of the
second overtime, defender
Todd Dunivant sent a corner
kick over the penalty box, and
the cross found Marshall's head
at the far post.
Marshall made solid contact
and sent the hall off the leg of a
Furman defender into the goal,
keeping Stanford's hope for its
first-ever men's soccer champi
onship alive.
The win gives the Cardinal an
opportunity to earn a second
straight trip to the College Cup
Final Four in Dallas when it faces
Clemson in a quarterfinal match
this Saturday at 7:00 p.m. at Mal
oney Field.
Stanford won 10-9 on penalty
kicks against Portland earlier in
the week to reach Sunday's
match.
"We've had a number of diffi
cult games and a lot of tight cir
cumstances in games," Simon
said. "A lot oftimes we could have
folded. To the players' credit,
they have risen above it continu
ally, and it's just a tremendous
group of guys. I'm very excited

that 1 have another week with
them, and hopefully longer."
In the second half of the Fur
man match, the home crowd of
1,138 saw exactly what Simon
meant.
Even without the services of
James Twellman (red card) and
with senior All-Pat-10 forward
Roger Levesque playing through
a stomach ailment, the Cardinal
came out with intense offensive
pressure in the first half.
Unfortunately, ii was playing
against a Furman defense that
had recorded a NCAA-record 11
straight shutouts entering Sun
day's game.
Despite outshooting its oppo
nent 9-4 in the first half, the Car

dinal could not beat Furman
keeper Alex Maslow, who was
playing at the lop of his game with
12 saves.
Even more demoralizing, Fur
man took a 1-0 lead into halftime
when Clint Dempsey headed a
ball past Stanford keeper Robby
Fulton in the 35th minute.
However, the Cardinal
charged back onto the field with
rekindled offensive fury in the
second half. In the 76th minute,
Dunivant, after almost losing the
ball over the touch line, found an
open Mike Wilson making a run
to the top of the box.
