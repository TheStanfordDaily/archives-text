The dream tame to an abrupt cud Satur
day night for the Stanford women's soccer
team. Alter 22 games in the season and 1 10
minutes of scoreless play in the top-seeded
Cardinal's NCAA quarterfinal match against
eighth-seeded Portland, a trip to the College
Cup Final Four came down to penalty kicks.

Women's Soccer
Saturday: No. 8 Portland 0, No. I Stanford 0 (Port
wins on PK, 4-2), NCAA Quarterfinals

Over 3,000 fans stood and watched as the
Pilots netted four kicks to the Cardinal's two,
bringing an amazing season for Stanford to a
startling finish.
It was a tremendous soccer game, as the
two squads truly battled for each minute of
regulation and overtime. The matchup of the

Cardinal back four against Portland forward
Christine Sinclair was everything it was hyped
up to be. The Portland midfield was as quick
and accurate as had been promised, and the
speed of play was extremely fast.
Hy all accounts, it was the kind of game that
no one wanted to go into a shootout.
"It's a crapshoot," Portland coach Clive
Charles said. "You never know."
Stanford junior striker Man ie Ward was a
little more explicit.
"If tliey had scored [in regulation], it
means we made a mistake and they capital
ized on it," Ward said. "But we didn't make
any mistakes."
Vet the season ends fora Stanford squad
that made very lew mistakes all year, allowing
just four goals during the regular season —
only one iti nine conference games — and
none in the College Cup.
"I leel sorry lor our kids," Stan
lord co-coach Stephanie Krickson
said. " I hey pul up a great fight. I
think they played an amazing
game. VVe hadn't laced a team that
challenged us like Portland did,
and I thought we handled it great."
Part of the challenge that Port
land presented was the team's
dominance in the midlield. The
combination of its speed, agility
and accuracy in field passes negat
ed the usual advantage the Cardi
nal has with the experience and
skill ol senior Callie Withers in the
midlield.
"I felt like at times they were
running circles around me in the
middle," Withers said. "They had
such a mobile midlield. [My]
strength is to be dominant and to
win balls. I'hey played around that
strength of mine I think, because
every time 1 would go up to get the
ball, they would just play it right
around me."
The Cardinal did its work
negating the advantage the Pilots
can usually count on from their
star striker Sinclair. The Cardinal
back four, considered by many to
be the best in the country, kept in
tense pressure on the forward and
gave her little time on the ball.
"They swarmed me every time I
got near the ball," Sinclair said.
"Not only myself, but our other
forwards. It was hard to create stuff
up front."
The result was that both squads

were held scoreless for 110 min
utes. Both teams were held to just
four shots in the first half, and each
side went over 30 minutes into the
second half before recording an
other.
Even when the teams did break
through the defensive pressure on
an offensive run or off a through
ball, both keepers were there with
the saves when called upon. And so
the trip to the College Cup came
down to penalty kicks.
Stanford sent senior Becky
Myers, who had not played all
game, to the line first. While her
shot beat the keeper, it was put just
a bit too far wide, as it ricocheted
off the post. Sinclair converted
Portland's first opportunity for an
early Pilot lead.
While junior Natalie Spilger
netted the second Stanford at
tempt, a miss in the third round by
sophomore Natalie Sanderson
gave the Pilots all the cushion they
needed. Though junior Marcie
Ward succeeded on her attempt, a
goal by Portland's Colleen Salis
bury in the fourth round of the
shootout gave the Pilots an insur
mountable 4-2 lead, and a trip to
the College Cup.
There were no regrets from the
Stanford coaches after the game.
"Those are kids who we believe
in [for penalties], and they know
that," Erickson said.
"They were ready," Sapsford
added.
There was, however, respect for
the Portland squad and its chances
in Austin.
"They were the best team we
faced all year," Erickson said.
