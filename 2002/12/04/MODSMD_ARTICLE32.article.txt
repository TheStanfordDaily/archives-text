Women's Soccer
Saturday: No. 8 Portland 0, No. I Stanford 0 (Port
wins on PK, 4-2), NCAA Quarterfinals

Over 3,000 fans stood and watched as the
Pilots netted four kicks to the Cardinal's two,
bringing an amazing season for Stanford to a
startling finish.
It was a tremendous soccer game, as the
two squads truly battled for each minute of
regulation and overtime. The matchup of the

Cardinal back four against Portland forward
Christine Sinclair was everything it was hyped
up to be. The Portland midfield was as quick
and accurate as had been promised, and the
speed of play was extremely fast.
Hy all accounts, it was the kind of game that
no one wanted to go into a shootout.
"It's a crapshoot," Portland coach Clive
Charles said. "You never know."
Stanford junior striker Man ie Ward was a
little more explicit.
"If tliey had scored [in regulation], it
means we made a mistake and they capital
ized on it," Ward said. "But we didn't make
any mistakes."
Vet the season ends fora Stanford squad
that made very lew mistakes all year, allowing
just four goals during the regular season —
only one iti nine conference games — and
none in the College Cup.
