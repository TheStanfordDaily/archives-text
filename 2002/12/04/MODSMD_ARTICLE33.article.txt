# Card finishes amazing run
## Women's soccer posts best season in school history, despite disappointing tourney loss 
### MATT BABIN STAFF WRITER 
It was a season that began with drama —
the resignation of a head coach just days be
fore a match with the defending national
champions. At that point, expectations were
varied — perhaps the team would crumble
into chaos, perhaps its skill would carry the
squad through. It was a mystery.
Yet from those humble beginnings, the
2002 Stanford women's soccer team, led by
co-coaches Paul Sapsford and Stephanie

Erickson, ran to a record of 21-2-0, posted
19 shutouts, won the Pacific-10 Confer
ence outright and advanced to the quar
terfinals of the NCAA College Cup. In
short, it was arguably the best season in the
program's history.
Vet even still, the season was bittersweet.
As the squad knocked oft'ranked opponents
early in the year, it became clear that the
team had a national title as a goal.
The Cardinal knocked off then-top
ranked Santa Clara 3-0 in the season opener,
the first regular-season win by Stanford in
the series since 1994. The Cardinal then
came home and posted wins over ranked op
ponents Texas and Texas A&M.
By early October, the squad had run its
record to 8-0-0, with a goals
for/against ratio of 26-2, which was
enough to earn the team the top
ranking in the nation for the first
time in program history.
The Cardinal's ensuing
matchup with then-No. 2 North
Carolina was seen by many as a
possible preview of the national
championship game.
Stanford wouldn't keep the top
ranking long, as a physical 1-0 de
feat to the Tar Heels took the team
back to the No. 2 spot, though the
Cardinal returned to the top a
short time later after a UNC loss.
Stanford took no time to get
back on the winning track, posting
a 3-0 victory over Tulane just two
days later to regain some momen
tum heading into conference play.
It was in conference play that
the Cardinal squad truly proved it
sell to soccer fans, both in and out
of the Pac-10. The team started the
conference season with a difficult
series of away games in Southern
California.
Riding the spectacular play of
redshirt keeper Nicole Barnhart,
the Cardinal came back up to the
Bay Area with two shutout wins,
and a lead in the conference stand
ings it would never give up.
The team ran through its Pac
-10 schedule with a 9-0 record,
holding every opponent except
California scoreless. The team's
amazing regular-season finish was
enough for the NCAA to make the
Cardinal the top seed in the Col
lege Cup.
Stanford entered the tourna
ment with an easy 4-0 opening
round victory over Cal Poly before
being escaping with a 1 -0 overtime
win over California in the second
round. The third round matched
the team against Notre Dame, and
the Cardinal again found itself a 1-
0 victor. The goal of a trip to the
Final Four was as close as it had
ever been.
But that goal was put out of

reach by Saturday night's defeat at
(he hands of Portland, which will
take the Cardinal's place in Austin
on account of its 4-2 win on penal
ties following 110 minutes of
scoreless play.
And so the season ends with
questions of who will coach the
team next season, how the team
will cope with losing live seniors —

including Pac-10 Player of the
Year Marcia VVallis—and, of
course, what might have been.
But before answers are sought
for all of them, fans of the program
should celebrate the season for its
positives: the most wins ever by a
Stanford women's soccer team, a
conference title and an incredible
postseason run.
