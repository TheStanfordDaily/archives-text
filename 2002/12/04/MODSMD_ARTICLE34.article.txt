The defending national cham
pion Stanford men's water polo
team received ihe No. 1 seed for
this weekend's NCAA Champi
onships, hosted by Loyola Mary
mount in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal (22-5) received
the one at-large bid to the four
team tournament, despite a
fourth-place showing at last week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament in Los
Alamitos, Calif. Even with its un
expectedly poor result over the

weekend, Stanford still boasted
the nation's best regular-season
record and closed out the regular
season with the No. 1 ranking it
held for most of the year.
The Cardinal slipped by Pacif
ic 12-9 in the first round of the
MPSF Tournament before falling

to eventual tournament champi
on California in the semifinals, 8-
7. By winning the conference
tournament, the Bears gained the
MPSF's automatic bid to the
NCAA Championships.
Stanford closed out the week
end with a disappointing 8-0 loss
to UCLA in Sunday's MPSF third
place game.
Stanford will play fourth
seeded UC-San Diego, winners
of the Western Water Polo Asso
ciation, in Saturday's first semi
final at LMU. Second-seeded
Cal will play third-seeded
Queens, the College Water Polo
Association champion, immedi
ately afterward.
The Cardinal boasts a fierce of
fensive attack, including six of the
top 30 scorers in the nation. This
weekend, sophomore Tony
Azevedo increased his scoring
tally to 90, breaking the Stanford
single-season scoring record pre
viously held by Craig Klass (87
goals in 1980). That helped earn
Azevedo MPSF Player of the Year
honors on Tuesday.
Stanford has now netted 300
goals this season. First-year coach
John Vargas said that he is very
confident in the ability of his of
fense. Vargas encourages creativ
ity in his players, while emphasiz
ing good fundamentals and intel
ligent play.
"We have such an intelligent
team, and we need to use that to
our advantage," he said. "Control
the ball and use your head, but
don't be afraid to break a tactical
rule to score a goal."
Stanford's diverse attack has
helped it outscore its opponents
300-148 on the season, a statistic
which is revealing not only of its
dominating offense, but also of
the Cardinal's relentless defense.
"The guys really stepped up
and made some solid defensive
plays," Vargas said. "I was happy
