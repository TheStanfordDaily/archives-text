Men's Basketball
Wednesday: Stanford 69, No. 7 Florida
65, NIT Semifinals
Friday: UNC 74, Stanford 57, NIT Finals

Despite a disappointing per
formance in the Preseason NIT
championship game, it's not too
late to jump on the Stanford
men's basketball bandwagon.
Stanford (4-1), which got off to
a surprising 4-0 start with victo
ries over then-No. 1 1 Xavier and
then-No. 7 Florida, dropped its
first game of the season totheTar
I leels (5-0) 74-57 last Friday at
Madison Square Garden.
UNC extended its dominance
over the Cardinal, which has
failed to notch a victory over the
Tar 1 leels in 10 attempts, includ
ing a Preseason NIT champi
onship-game loss in 1998.
Sophomore swingman Josh
Childress turned in a spectacular
performance last Friday, scoring
17 points and shooting 4-of-6
from the free-throw line, but Stan
lord could not overcome UNC's
pressure defense and hot 3-point
shooting. The'far 1 leels shot 5-of
-13 from behind the arc and led by
as much as 20 in the first half.
Stanford junior guard Matt
Lottie h, who has recently proven
himself to be a very dependable
scoring threat, struggled from
the field. He finished the night 1-
of-8 shooting with only three
points. Senior point guard Julius
Barnes finished with 17 points
and got hot late in the first half to

bring the Cardinal to within eight
at the break.
"North Carolina is a very, very
good basketball team. They were
really ready to play and took us
out of our stuff," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Their speed, their quickness
and athleticism really hurt us."
The Tar Heels were also bol
stered by outstanding perfor
mances from their three starting
freshmen. Rashad McCants was
7-of-ll with 18 points, Raymond
Felton had 1G points and seven
assists, and Sean May added 12
points and seven rebounds.
"We probably should have got
ten out of the zone quicker. They
obviously solved that," Mont
gomery said. "Raymond Felton
surprised us with his ability to
shoot it from outside. The prob
lem with the man-to-man would
have been Sean May, because he's
so big in there, and we would
have really had a hard time with
him inside."
North Carolina and Stanford
came into the game in similar sit
uations. Both teams were rela
tively inexperienced (UNC has
only one upperclassman on its
roster) and both previously un
ranked teams were predicted to
finish toward the bottom of their
respective conferences.
But the Cardinal, now ranked
No. 17, and the No. 12 Tar Heels
will command increased respect
after convincing victories over
powerhouses on a national stage.
After Stanford beat Florida (3-
1) 69-65 during the semifinals on
Wednesday night, Gators coach
Billy Donovan said, "1 liken them
to last year's Arizona team, which
lost a couple of guys to the NBA
and who people thought
wouldn't beany good."
The Cardinal relied on good
free-throw shooting as well as a
couple of clutch 3-pointers by

Lottich to clinch the 69-65 win.
Playing under experimental
rules, Lottich was undaunted by
the lengthened 3-point line. Fir
ing from 20 feet, 6 inches, the ju
nior shooting guard knocked
down two key 3-pointers to keep
the Cardinal in the game. I le fin

Sophomore center Rob Little
led Stanford with a career-high

18 points and nine rebounds,
while also going 4-lor- l from the
free-throw line. Junior forward

double-double on the season with
14 points and 10 rebounds.

Stanford's strong zone de
fense only allowed the Gators to
make 39.3 percent of their shots

from the field. Strong perfor
mances from Malt Bonner and
Matt Walsh, who scored 19 and
17 points, respectively, made
up for the Gator's weak, back
court shooting.
The Cardinal fell behind early,
but never trailed by more than
seven points during the physical
match. With 18 seconds left, Lit
tle's putback gave Stanford a two

point edge. A quirk foul on Davis
allowed the junior to put the
game away for Stanford with a
pair of free throws.
"I'm sure we've surprised peo

Wednesday: Stanford 69, No. 7 Florida
65, NIT Semifinals
Friday: UNC 74, Stanford 57, NIT Finals

Despite a disappointing per
formance in the Preseason NIT
championship game, it's not too
late to jump on the Stanford
men's basketball bandwagon.
Stanford (4-1), which got off to
a surprising 4-0 start with victo
ries over then-No. 1 1 Xavier and
then-No. 7 Florida, dropped its
first game of the season totheTar
I leels (5-0) 74-57 last Friday at
Madison Square Garden.
UNC extended its dominance
over the Cardinal, which has
failed to notch a victory over the
Tar 1 leels in 10 attempts, includ
ing a Preseason NIT champi
onship-game loss in 1998.
Sophomore swingman Josh
Childress turned in a spectacular
performance last Friday, scoring
17 points and shooting 4-of-6
from the free-throw line, but Stan
lord could not overcome UNC's
pressure defense and hot 3-point
shooting. The'far 1 leels shot 5-of
-13 from behind the arc and led by
as much as 20 in the first half.
Stanford junior guard Matt
Lottie h, who has recently proven
himself to be a very dependable
scoring threat, struggled from
the field. He finished the night 1-
of-8 shooting with only three
points. Senior point guard Julius
Barnes finished with 17 points
and got hot late in the first half to

bring the Cardinal to within eight
at the break.
"North Carolina is a very, very
good basketball team. They were
really ready to play and took us
out of our stuff," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Their speed, their quickness
and athleticism really hurt us."
The Tar Heels were also bol
stered by outstanding perfor
mances from their three starting
freshmen. Rashad McCants was
7-of-ll with 18 points, Raymond
Felton had 1G points and seven
assists, and Sean May added 12
points and seven rebounds.
"We probably should have got
ten out of the zone quicker. They
obviously solved that," Mont
gomery said. "Raymond Felton
surprised us with his ability to
shoot it from outside. The prob
lem with the man-to-man would
have been Sean May, because he's
so big in there, and we would
have really had a hard time with
him inside."
