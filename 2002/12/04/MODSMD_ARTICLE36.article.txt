Even after two big wins over
nationally ranked opponents,
No. 17 Stanford (4-1) still has
much to prove. The Cardinal fin
ished the Thanksgiving weekend
one win short of assuming the po
sition it really wanted on the na
tional stage.

Despite Stanford's successful
Preseason NIT run, everyone is
talking about North Carolina
now.
Before leaving for New York,
sophomore center Rob Little had
said, "1 think the main thing for
us is to go up there and be com
petitive. Winning isn't every
thing, but we've got to go up
there and compete. We have
something to gain from a win and
a loss."
Turns out, he was right.
The Cardinal did have
everything to gain from partic
ipation in the Preseason NIT.
And the championship-game
loss to the Tar Heels only
means that Stanford is still a
few big wins away from garner
ing the respect it desires.
So what's the good news?
If anything, the loss to North
Carolina proves that this Cardi
nal team has not quite reached its
potential just yet. What's impor
tant to remember is that early
season victories don't necessarily
translate into postseason bliss.
The bad news?
For the Stanford men's basket
ball team, tests don't end with fi
nals week. The Preseason NI'F
was just a sample midterm in the

first quarter of their basketball
term. In the next six weeks, the
Cardinal will endure a challeng
ing schedule in preparation for
the upcoming Pacific-10 Confer
ence season, although, for the
moment, its largest tests are now
over.
Based on the early success
that the Cardinal has enjoyed,
head coach Mike Montgomery
said, "Obviously we're pleased,
and we probably surprised some
people."
But unfortunately for Stan
ford, the road doesn't get any eas
ier from here on out. The biggest
tests will come against unranked
UNLV on Dec. 21 and No. 25
Conzaga in the Pete Newell Chal
lenge on Dec. 28.
Stanford will travel to the Las
Vegas Shootout to play against
the Runnin' Rebels. Among
other things, UNLV will present
a tough road venue for the Car
dinal to contend with, something
that Stanford has yet to face this
season. The Runnin' Rebels have
been contenders on the national
stage for many years, and Gonza
ga in recent years has earned its
title as a prominent basketball
powerhouse.
There are a couple teams on
the winter break schedule that
are looking to upset Stanford.
First on the schedule is un
ranked Saint Mary's (2-2) on
Dec. 14, and on Dec. 19, the Car
dinal will be tested by unranked
UC-lrvine (1-2). The Anteaters
won the Big West Champi
onship last season and are look
ing to repeat.
But before the fun and games
can begin, the Cardinal will en
dure an extended practice sched
ule.
"We always take two weeks oil
[from games] for dead week and
finals week," senior guard Julius
Barnes said. "Those two weeks of
practice can be really tough."
