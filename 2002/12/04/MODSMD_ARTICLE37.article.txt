The Cardinal (4-0) gutted out a
63-57 upset win over the then-No.
2 Wildcats (5-1) to capture the
Stanford Invitational title at
Maples Pavilion. Stanford moved
up two spots in this week's poll to
No. 5 with the win, while Kansas
State fell to No. 7.
"They're showing me gut," Stan
ford coach Tara Van Dei veer said
after earning her 400 th career vic
tory on the Farm. "Maybe this team
is consistent, consistent in failing to
give in. I would see us bend and
then people would just dig in."
Stanford's gritty performance
pushed its win streak at Maples to
15 games dating back to last year.
T he Cardinal attempted a
school-record 37 3-pointers in the
game, but made nearly every one
of the 12 they sank count.
Stanford made three 3-pointers
in a row at one point in the second
half to offset a 6-0 Kansas State run
to start the period. The Cardinal
later pulled away for good when
sophomore guard Sebnem Kimy
acioglu nailed a 3-pointer from the
wing with 1:48 remaining.
However, the game wasn't in
hand for Stanford until freshman
guard Krista Rappahahn, playing
in place of the injured Susan King,
converted two pairs of free throws
in the final minute.
"We knew [Rappahahn] was
making them," VanDerveer said.
"We have confidence in her."
Stanford hadn't beaten an op
ponent ranked as high as the sec
ond-ranked Wildcats since upend
ing then-No. 1 Purdue on Nov. 22,
19981.
Before the game, VanDerveer

had said she was concerned about
controlling the superb talent
Kansas State possesses in its start
ing five. And although the Wild
cats' Megan Mahoney and Kendra
Wecker scored 19 and 18 points,
respectively, the Cardinal was able
to stille both All-America candi
date Nicole Ohlde (13 points) and
sophomore Laurie Koehn (five
points), holding each below their
season scoring averages.
"1 think we took away some of

their weapons, their [team's]
strengths," Kimyacioglu said.
Another key coming into the
game lor the Cardinal was its abili
ty to rebound with the Wildcats.
One of the big reasons Kansas
State has ascended in the rankings
early in the year is its plus-11.8 av
erage per game rebound margin.
But the Cardinal, despite play
ing with three guards and an un
dersized center most of the game
(6-foot-3 true center Chelsea Trot

ter only played five minutes), out
rebounded Kansas State 39-34.
Sophomore guard Kelley Suni
inski, who was named co-tourna
ment MVP with Ohlde, led Stan
lord with 18 points and chipped in
six rebounds and four assists.
Stanford's Kimyacioglu and
sophomore forward Azella Perry
man, Temple's Stacey Smalls and
Kansas State's Wecker and Ma
honey rounded out the all-tourna
ment team.
The much-heralded match up
between the top-10 teams nearly
didn't materialize, as the Wildcats
only pulled away late in their 72-05
victory over Temple on Friday
night.
Conversely, the Cardinal sped
out of the gate and never looked
back against Princeton in its 95-39
win on Friday. Stanford rushed
out to a 35-3 lead in the first 10
minutes, getting contributions
from just about everyone on the
bench.
More importantly, VanDerveer
and company were able to wel
come back junior guard Katie
Denny from a broken right hand.
And the scrappy Denny, with a
soft cast still on her right hand,
made an immediate impact. She
set a career high in points with 10
in the first hall alone, eventually
finishing with 18 to give the Cardi
nal a huge boost oil the bench.
"I was really happy with our
bench play," VanDerveer said.
"Katie getting healthy for us was
huge, and 1 think she really took
advantage of her opportunity."
Stanford also set a few school
records against the Tigers.
The Cardinal's 56-point margin
of victory tied for the filth highest
in school history. It was the biggest
disparity since a 109-53 win over
Southern California in 1995.
Stanford also matches its high
est ever rebounding margin with a
plus-35, stemming from the sec
ond-highest rebound total in pro
gram history (62). Perryman set a
career high in rebounds with 18,
the seventh-highest single-game
total in Cardinal history, and set a
personal best with 17 points in just
28 minutes.
live 39 points allowed by Van-
Derveer's squad tied for the ninth
lowest total in school history.
