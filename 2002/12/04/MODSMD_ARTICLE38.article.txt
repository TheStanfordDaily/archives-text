# No easy answers for football's failed year
## 
### MATT LONG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When a team experiences a bad
year, people immediately judge
the squad, looking for someone to
tag as the guilty party. In the case of
Stanford football, the defendant is
Buddy Teevens, its first-year head
coach.
Exhibit A is the worst turn
around in school history. Teevens
inherited a 9-3 team that ended
12001 smack in the middle of the
top 25. While key personnel grad
uated on both sides of the ball, and
2002 was widely regarded as a re
building year from the start, no one
expected the debacle that was (his
season. Stanford had just two wins,
and neither the San Jose Suite nor
Arizona wins were considered
quality wins by many people.
I hat leads to Exhibit B, which
bodes even worse for Teevens. This
year he was consistently compared
to two men: Tyrone Willingham,
his Stanford predecessor, and Jell
Tedlord, his rookie coaching coun
terpart at California. Willingham
has led his new team, Notre Dame,
to a 10-2 record and has become
college football's biggest celebrity.
Meanwhile, Tedlord orchestrated
the biggest turnaround in Cal histo
ry and took the Bears from 1-10 to
7-5. That makes it one tough year to
be compared to two tough coaches.
Still, before reaching a verdict,
the Cardinal faithful must realize
that Teevens does have a defense
— unlike his team.
Inexperience plagued Stanford
all season long. Not only did the
(Cardinal begin spring practice with
a depleted defense after graduat
ing key seniors at almost every po
sition, but it seemed that every
week one of the team's few veterans
fell to injury.
It began with three starters —
junior tight end Brett Pierce, se
nior nose tackle Craig Albrecht and

senior lineman Paul Weinacht —
who all suffered season-ending in
juries in the first few games.
In addition, key offensive play
makers, including senior fullback
Casey Moore and junior flanker
Luke Powell, fought through ail
ments that drastically affected
their performances. Junior quar
terback Chris Lewis was available
only sparingly this season also, sit
ting out the first game of the year
due to NCAA suspension before
being forced to watch the team's
final live games because of a shoul
der injury.
Though Lewis' performance
was subpar in his scant minutes, his
absence made Teevens hand the
reins of his fun 'n' gun offense to
redshirt freshman Kyle Matter.
Matter, thrust into the unenviable
position of a freshman starting
quarterback in the pass-heavy Pa
cific-10 Conference, did little to
prevent his team's last-place finish.
"It's hard," Teevens said of Mat -
ter. "We forget that he's a redshirt
freshman and doesn't have any
thing to draw from. He'll be far bet
ter the more he plays."
Still, Matter is far from being
guaranteed future playing time, as
Teevens' offense relies on the pass
ing at tack, and the coacli is t >pening
up competition for next year's
starting job. Matter, Lewis and
freshman Trent Edwards are the
leading candidates for the position.
"The biggest [goal for improve
ment] is quarterback develop
ment," Teevens said. "We need to
be able to throw the ball downfield
to have success."
Teevens' much maligned de
fense is-another story. It loses just
two starters in defensive tackles Matt
Leonard and Trey Freeman, but
leaves the season with little confi
dence. The coach talked up the
progress and talent of his defense all
season, but the on-field results gave
little support to his reassurances.

Defensive inadequacies can
hardly be attributed solely to
coaching, but the unit played just
as poorly in its final loss to Cal than
ii did all season long. Still, Teevens
cannot make cornerback Stanley
Wilson get faster and cover the
deep ball or linebacker Jon Alston
wrap up on his tackles. These im
provements depend upon the
players' individual ability and de
sire, two qualities that the depart
ing seniors believe their team
mates have.
"Even in my five years, twice we
rebounded from losing seasons,"
senior guard Greg Schindler said.

"I've been involved with some
great turnarounds in this program.
The reason I think that's possible is
not only because of the young tal
ent, but because of the general
character we have on the team."
Next year Teevens will attempt
to do what he never could during
his coaching tenure at Tulane: fin
ish with a winning record. That's
the most important thing he says
he learned this season: "I don't
ever want to go through that
again."
It's safe to say that no one else in
the Stanford football family wants
to either.
