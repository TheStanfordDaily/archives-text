# Fates aligned against Card in poor season

It was long.
It was painful.
Hut, more than anything, it was
inexplicable.
The Stanford football team put
together its worst season in 19
years, stumbling to a 2-9 finish (1-
7 Pacilic-10 Conference). Yet, de
spite its apparent futility, Stan
lord's season wasn't just another
lost cause.
Despite its record, the Cardinal
was competitive in the majority of
its games; it would hang around
fora while, or even hold an early
lead, before bogging down in the
second half and watching its oppo
nent kick into high gear.
"We've had an upsetting sea
son," senior wide receiver Ryan
Wells said. "Once we have our
chance, for some reason we stop
executing."
The story all season long for the
Cardinal was that failure to exe
cute. Every week, head coach
Buddy Teevens and his players re
iterated that same theme.
"The plays were there, but we
didn't make them," senior defen
sive tackle Matt Leonard said
after Stanford's 65-24 loss to Ari
zona State.
"It's definitely not supposed to
be this way," junior quarterback
Chris Lewis said after the Cardi
nal's 36-11 loss to Washington
State. "We have to go back and fig
ure it out if it takes us all year."
"They made plays, and we
didn't," Teevens said after Stan
ford's season-ending Big Game
loss to California. "We just didn't
do what we needed to do."
The effort and emotion were
there leading up to each game,
and the pain and disappointment
were there after each excruciat
ing loss.
Unfortunately, no one ever fig
ured out how to right the ship.

"It's been tough," said redshirt
freshman quarterback Kyle Mat
ter, whose struggles intensified as
the season went on, despite hav
ing the nation's fifth-highest pass
er rating through the team s first
two games.
"1 thought, especially early in
the season, I was making a lot of
progress, and then I had a lew set
backs and wasn't able to overcome
them," Matter said.
Teevens hopes that this sea
son's absolute chaos at quarter
back was at the heart of the of
lense's utter lack of productivity.
"The quarterback situation
needs to be settled," Teevens
said. "We need to be more effec
tive offensively."
Lewis' repeated injuries and
Matter's rookie struggles made
the QB position a weekly question
mark for the Cardinal. The of
fense never looked comfortable or
in sync with either quarterback,
and the unit that was expected to
be one of the highest-scoring in
the nation produced more than
three touchdowns in only one
game all season.
The receiving corps struggled
with dropped passes, and the
highly touted offensive line had its
fair share of struggles, both of
which were unexpected develop
ments that the players couldn't re
ally explain.
On defense, at least, the an
swers seem clearer. The fright
eningly young but talented unit
just made a lot of mistakes. I he
defense fared decently against
the run, aside from its tendency
to give up big perimeter rushes.
Both the pass defense and the
pass rush were often ineffec
tive, but both were able to come
up with impressive plays now
and then.
"It'll be a lot different next year
than it was this year in terms of
guys with experience," Teevens
said.
