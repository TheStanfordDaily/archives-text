### ERIC ELDON ANTHONY HA 
On Monday, a federal mediator attempted to
bring together union workers and managers
from the Stanford and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospitals to work out a hew contract.
After a few short hours, talks once again broke
off with neither new agreements nor future
dates arranged continued bargaining be
tween the two sides. The discussions marked the
first time administrators and union representa
tives had met since talks first stalled on Nov. 4.
Union members held a one-day strike on
Nov. 13 outside the hospitals in support of their
demands, which include a moratorium on the
subcontracting of union jobs and a new worker
manager patient care committee answerable to
an independent third party. The committee
would be endowed with decision-making pow

ers on issues such as ward-staffing levels.
The federal mediator, Commissioner Erin
Spaulding of the Federal Mediation and Con

ker a deal.
The hospital has offered a pay raise, the cre
ation of a worker pay scale recognizing seniori
ty, and a manager-led patient care committee.
Hospital spokesperson Maria La Ganga
emphasized the economic side of the dis
agreement.
"The mediator called us together and after
about three-and-a-half to four hours ended the
session," she said. "The key issue seems to be
the union leadership's rejection of the 21 per
cent on-average pay increase over three years
that would make our employees among the
highest paid in the region, at a time when em
ployers in the Silicon Valley are stilling making

round after round of layoffs."
Lourdes Arafiles, a unit secretary in the
cardiovascular unit at the hospital and a
member of the union negotiating committee,
said that the union has made efforts to reach
a compromise.
"We tried to move a lot to reach an agree
ment yesterday, but unfortunately the man
agement did not make an attempt to move to
reach an agreement," she said. "We even com
promised on the pay scale system. We moved
from asking fora five-year scale to 10-year one
[in which to reach full seniority], but [the hos
pitals] have stayed at 15 years like they asked
for before.
"What's holding us back is that there is no
guarantee that they won't increase the work-
