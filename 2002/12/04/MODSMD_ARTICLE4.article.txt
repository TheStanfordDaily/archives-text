# Hospital negotiations break down
## 
### ERIC ELDON ANTHONY HA 
On Monday, a federal mediator attempted to
bring together union workers and managers
from the Stanford and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospitals to work out a hew contract.
After a few short hours, talks once again broke
off with neither new agreements nor future
dates arranged continued bargaining be
tween the two sides. The discussions marked the
first time administrators and union representa
tives had met since talks first stalled on Nov. 4.
Union members held a one-day strike on
Nov. 13 outside the hospitals in support of their
demands, which include a moratorium on the
subcontracting of union jobs and a new worker
manager patient care committee answerable to
an independent third party. The committee
would be endowed with decision-making pow

ers on issues such as ward-staffing levels.
The federal mediator, Commissioner Erin
Spaulding of the Federal Mediation and Con
ciliation Services, arrived last week to try to bro
ker a deal.
The hospital has offered a pay raise, the cre
ation of a worker pay scale recognizing seniori
ty, and a manager-led patient care committee.
Hospital spokesperson Maria La Ganga
emphasized the economic side of the dis
agreement.
"The mediator called us together and after
about three-and-a-half to four hours ended the
session," she said. "The key issue seems to be
the union leadership's rejection of the 21 per
cent on-average pay increase over three years
that would make our employees among the
highest paid in the region, at a time when em
ployers in the Silicon Valley are stilling making

round after round of layoffs."
Lourdes Arafiles, a unit secretary in the
cardiovascular unit at the hospital and a
member of the union negotiating committee,
said that the union has made efforts to reach
a compromise.
"We tried to move a lot to reach an agree
ment yesterday, but unfortunately the man
agement did not make an attempt to move to
reach an agreement," she said. "We even com
promised on the pay scale system. We moved
from asking fora five-year scale to 10-year one
[in which to reach full seniority], but [the hos
pitals] have stayed at 15 years like they asked
for before.
"What's holding us back is that there is no
guarantee that they won't increase the work-
load of people, and there is no
guarantee that there will be no lay
oils after we accept what they're of
fering."
Living-wage forum flops
Student groups such as the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
have been active in supporting the
hospital workers in their battle
with the hospitals' administration.
Gordon Earle, Stanford vice
president of public affairs, and
Gene Awakuni, vice provost ofstu

dent affairs, hosted an open forum
last night to discuss campus living
wage issues. However, due to a
lack of publicity and the fact that
the forum was scheduled during
Dead Week, the only students in
attendance were from the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition and
the Coalition for Labor Justice.
Claiming that the administra
tion was not adequately address
ing their concerns — either in
having a real open forum attended
by representatives from diverse
campus groups or in allowing stu
dent and worker input into the
formulation of University labor
policy — the students walked out
after half an hour of discussion.

"It's unacceptable," said SI AC
member Anna Sale, a senior. "An
unptiblicized meeting that we
weren't given any information
about until one day beforehand just
doesn't suffice. We're frustrated."
Earle said the low attendance was
due to a genuine misunderstand
ing, because he had assumed that
SLAC would publicize the forum.
"We, too, were disappointed by
turnout last night," he said. "Be
cause turnout was so light, we in
tend to hold another open forum
in the second week of January We
will encourage and actively seek
the participation of all interested
parties — students, faculty and
workers — in the discussion."
