Although current college ath
letics tend to center on winnings
and rankings above all else, the
Cardinal sailing team had the
opportunity this weekend to ex
hibit its proficiency in another
area of competition: sportsman
ship.
Instead of only focusing on
winning, the primary goal of the
United States / Japan Goodwill
Regatta — hosted every two to
three years in the U.S. and every
six years in Japan — is friendly
competition between interna
tional competitors. And though
Stanford coach Jay Kehoe large
ly credits Stanford's sportsman
like tendencies for the school's
consistent invitation to the re
gatta, the Cardinal also main
tained its reputation for being as
competitive in the boats as il is
friendly on land.
Stanford, represented by se
nior skipper Matt Hooks and
junior crew Diana Ly, placed
seventh out of over 30 teams
present at the regatta, which
was hosted by Southern Cali
fornia.
Ly was generally pleased with
the duo's performance, though
she had hoped to place in the
toj) live at the event.
"1 think we were a little bit
disappointed because we were
sixth at the beginning of the
third day . . . and thought we
might move up," Ly said.
The duo competed against
several Japanese schools along
with teams not part of the Pacif
ic Coast division, such as Old
Dominion and Wisconsin.
Harvard took first place,
earning first in nearly half of
its races to finish a convincing
20 points ahead of its nearest

competition, Ritsumeikan.
Tufts, USC and Brown round
ed out the geographically di
verse top live.
Hut die emphasis was less on
scoring this time, a fact rein
forced by the very structure of
the regatta. Schools were invited
to send only one skipper and
crew to compose a single divi
sion of doublehanded sailing to
participate in an impressive 16
races each. Members of various
teams mingled in the evenings
at dinners and activities spon
sored by the regatta.
"It was a very social regatta
because we were meeting all the
Japanese students," Ly said.
1 lowever, the friendliness oil
the water in no way compro
mised the competitive spirit
once in the boats.
"It was very different oil the
course, but there was still very
competitive and serious sailing,"
Ly said.
As a regatta that has the pri
mary goal of promoting
friendship between the two
countries, cultural exchange
was not limited to events off
the water. In fact, Ly noted
several differences in sailing
strategies undertaken by the
Japanese competitors during
the races.
"Their boathandling tech
niques are very different," Ly
said, explaining that it was par
ticularly interesting to watch her
foreign competitors tack.
Interaction between boats
was an equally new experience,
as 32 teams competed for space
on the water.
"There were a lot of issues
with rules and right of way," Ly
said about the more technical as
pects of her sport. "It's hard to
communicate with people who
speak a different language."
