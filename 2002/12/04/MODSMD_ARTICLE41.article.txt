# Card women face tough tests after finals

This past weekend, when red
shirt sophomore guard Susan King
collided with a Kansas State player
— and subsequently laid fiat on her
stomach fora minute or so before
rising slowly with the aid of the
training stall — a collective sigh of
relief resonated through Maples
Pavilion.

Thanksgiving may have passed,
but everyone in Cardinal country is
still thankful that the end-of-the
quarter break has started.
With final exams coming up,
No. 5 Stanford will have a full two
weeks to recuperate anil reload be
fore its next game, a Dec. 14 contest
at Pacific.
"It's good for the people who are
injured to get rest and for people
who are healthy to improve upon
their game," sophomore guard
Sebnem Kimyacioglu said.
There was no immediate word
on King's status (it appeared as if
she sustained a minor concussion),
but everyone, including coach Tara
VanDerveer, seemed to think she'd
be OK after the long layoff.
And the Cardinal faithful will be
crossing their fingers over the next
fortnight, hoping and praying that
star junior forward Nicole Powell
will suddenly wake up one day and
have that twinge in her back sub
side just enough.
Just enough so that she can suit
up, and give the Cardinal that
number 14 presence in its lineup.
Considering how well the Cardi
nal has been playing without its in
jured Ail-American, it's hard to
imagine what the return of Powell
will do to the Stanford squad.
Kansas State's Deb Patterson has
one opinion.
"When Powell comes back, I

would think this Stanford team be
comes one of the teams most people
in America would pick to be in At
lanta [for the Women's Final
Four]," she said.
But given the fickle nature of
some back injuries, speculation on
Powell's return remains just that.
So what exactly have Powell's
teammates been doing in the mean
time without her?
"They are maximizing the talent
that they have," Patterson said.
"They are playing with their
strengths. They are an extremely
effective team oil the dribble and
from the 3-point line.
"The balance that they bring is
very impressive. But at the same
time, you aren't looking at one of
the most athletic teams in the coun
try, but at an intelligent, tough
minded, compel it i ve gr<) u p.'"
While the rest of the Stanford
campus will remain a virtual ghost
town over winter break, the
women's team will play a meaty
seven games between Dec. 14 and
Jan. 5.
The most important of those
matchups is surely the Dec. IS
game in Knoxville, Tenn., where
the Cardinal will be lighting a little
history against No. 4 Tennessee.
Stanford has lost to the lately
Vols three consecutive years, in
cluding a 68-62 decision at a sold
out Maples Pavilion last year.
But this isn't exactly the same
vaunted Tennessee of old, as evi
denced by their 76-55 thrashing at
the hands of top-ranked Duke. Pat
Summit's team isn't at the top this
year, a year that many think has
more parity than most with both
the Volunteers and perennial jug
gernaut Connecticut struggling.
"There isn't anyone way far
above everyone else," Kimyacioglu
said. "It's a little clump this year."
For King, the game in Knoxville
could take on some extra weight.
Flash back to Dec. 17, 2000. In
side Thompson Boling Area was a
party. A big party.
It was freshman King's coming
out party to the NCAA world. She

led all scorers with 21 points and
added live rebounds and three as
sists to boot. If Powell still isn't back
by then, the Cardinal may need an
other such performance from its
ultra-quick point guard to leave
Knoxville with a win.
Stanford's game against No. 18
Oklahoma on Jan. 3 was supposed
to be another great challenge for
VanDerveer's club, but fate has
thrown a wrench in those plans.
Oklahoma senior All-America

candidate Caton Hill and freshman
Erin 1 liggins both went down with
season-ending knee injuries — on
the same day no less. Higgins tore
her light ACL in a pregame
shootaround, and Hill tore her left
ACL driving to the bucket on the
second play of the game against
Sam I louston.
To some who have followed the
VanDerveer era for years, it was

shades of 1998, when Vanessa Ny
gaard and Kristin Folkl decimated
their ACLs within three days of
each other.
"It's scary," Kimyacioglu said.
"Just imagine if that would happen
to you—you lose two people in one
day."
The game still should be a chal

power to upset then-No. 11 North
Carolina in the Rainbow Wahine

I Stanford will also host a scrappy
Pepperdine team on Jan. 5. The
Waves return three key starters
from a club that went 23-8 a year
ago, won the West Coast Confer
ence regular season title and
reached the NCAA tournament for

only the second time in school his

And there's a sort of schedule
quirk this year as well. Stanford
opens its Pacific-10 Conference sea
son the weekend of Dec. 27 to Dec.
29 against the Arizona schools — in
the midst of the Cardinal's final
non-conference sprint.
Stanford plays a road game Dec.
21 at Boston University. In Boston,
the Cardinal will face an old team
mate, forward Becky Bonner, who
transferred from Stanford during
the summer after receiving too lim
ited playing time.
If nothing else, the confidence
gained this past weekend will un
doubtedly come in handy for the
Cardinal in those tough non-league
road games.
"Our preparation really
helped," Kimyacioglu said. "When
you know what the other team is
running, it really helps with your
confidence."
