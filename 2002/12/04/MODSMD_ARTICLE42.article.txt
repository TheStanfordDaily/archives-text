# Teamwork, running as a pack keys to success

### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is one word lo describe
the success of the Stanford men's
crosscountry this fall: teamwork.
"It was all about the team,"
said junior Grant Robison after
the Cardinal's victory at the
NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Intl., last Monday
Stanford claimed its third
NCAA title in seven years to cap
a dream season during which
the squad was ranked first in
every poll after the opening pre
season rankings were released.
It was a common sight to see
the Stanford pack leading a race
and setting the pace. Even at the
NCAA Western Regionals held
on the Stanford Golf Course on
Nov. 10, the Cardinal put six
runners in the front and ran as a
team to dominate No. 5 Oregon.
But this team effort hardly
diminished the individual ac
complishments of the Stanford
runners.
A Cardinal athlete won all
but two races the squad entered
this year, including individual
victories by Robison and junior
Don Sage at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships on
Nov. 2 and at the Western Re
gionals, respectively.
"We run as a pack," said ju

nior lan Dobson. "But we aren't
going to sacrifice places to stay as
a pack the whole race."
In the Pac-10 race, a group of
10 Stanford runners led
through 3,000 meters before
stringing out the race. Although
three of the athletes broke late to
take the top three spots, the team
effort placed seven Cardinal
runners in the top nine to de
molish a very talented field.
"Every race, our goal is to put
a group of guys near the front of
the race," said Vin Lananna, di
rector of cross country and track
and field. "We want to be in po
sition lo win as a team, and the
guys will race how they need to
accomplish this goal."
Overall this year, the Cardi
nal posted eight team victories
and one third-place showing as a
"IV' team in the long course race
of the Stanford Invitational on
Sept. 28.
But the most impressive vic
tory for the Cardinal was its
NCAA title.
Even in a field that con
tained the most talented dis
tance runners in the nation,
Stanford wasted no time mov
ing to the front.
Halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the announcer said,
