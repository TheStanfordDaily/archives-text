# Teamwork, running as a pack keys to success
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is one word lo describe
the success of the Stanford men's
crosscountry this fall: teamwork.
"It was all about the team,"
said junior Grant Robison after
the Cardinal's victory at the
NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Intl., last Monday
Stanford claimed its third
NCAA title in seven years to cap
a dream season during which
the squad was ranked first in
every poll after the opening pre
season rankings were released.
It was a common sight to see
the Stanford pack leading a race
and setting the pace. Even at the
NCAA Western Regionals held
on the Stanford Golf Course on
Nov. 10, the Cardinal put six
runners in the front and ran as a
team to dominate No. 5 Oregon.
But this team effort hardly
diminished the individual ac
complishments of the Stanford
runners.
A Cardinal athlete won all
but two races the squad entered
this year, including individual
victories by Robison and junior
Don Sage at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships on
Nov. 2 and at the Western Re
gionals, respectively.
"We run as a pack," said ju

nior lan Dobson. "But we aren't
going to sacrifice places to stay as
a pack the whole race."
In the Pac-10 race, a group of
10 Stanford runners led
through 3,000 meters before
stringing out the race. Although
three of the athletes broke late to
take the top three spots, the team
effort placed seven Cardinal
runners in the top nine to de
molish a very talented field.
"Every race, our goal is to put
a group of guys near the front of
the race," said Vin Lananna, di
rector of cross country and track
and field. "We want to be in po
sition lo win as a team, and the
guys will race how they need to
accomplish this goal."
Overall this year, the Cardi
nal posted eight team victories
and one third-place showing as a
"IV' team in the long course race
of the Stanford Invitational on
Sept. 28.
But the most impressive vic
tory for the Cardinal was its
NCAA title.
Even in a field that con
tained the most talented dis
tance runners in the nation,
Stanford wasted no time mov
ing to the front.
Halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the announcer said,
"Stanford is making a mockery of
(lie team race with four guys right
near the top 10."
The Stanford pack slowly
picked oil runners as they faded
during the race, and, at the finish,
Robison lead four Stanford run
ners into the top 10 with his own
third-place finish.
Juniors Sage, Louis Luchini
and lan Dobson claimed fifth,
sixth and ninth, respectively, giv
ing one of the most dominating
team performances at the NCAA
Championships in the last 10
years.
In all, six Stanford runners
claimed All-America titles as the
Cardinal scored just 47 points, fin
ishing well ahead of runner-up
Wisconsin's 107.
"I think this is a better com
bined team effort than in 1996
[when Stanford claimed both the
men's and women's titles],"
Lananna said.
Individual successes this year
were not limited to just the big
race winners like Robison and
Sage. Redshirt freshman Neil
Davis surprised the nation by run
ning on Stanford's varsity unit
most of the season and running as
its fifth man at Pac-lOs.
Junior Adam Tenforde
reemerged as an elite distance
runner by claiming All-America
honors after redshirting the last
cross country season.
Freshman Peter Meindl was the
only true freshman to run on Stan
ford's varsity squad this year, while
junior Andrew Hill claimed his first
ever collegiate victory at the Ari

zona State Invitational on Oct. 11
Sophomore Ryan Hall posted
two commanding victories this
season and claimed All-Ameri<s
honors at NCAAs to finish a solid
season for the Cardinal.
However, Stanford's top lour
put on a show at the NCAA Cham
pionships that will be hard to re
peat. /Ml four are much
over last year, building anticipzf
tion and excitement for the upC
coming track season.
But most importantly, the guys
on the squad and the coaches will
say that it is the effort of every single
runner that makes this team great.
"Twenty-eight runners ran for
28 minutes at 10:15 a.m. Pacific
time [on the day of the NCAA
Championships] and finished with
a hard 000 meters on the track,"
Lananna said, referring to mem
bers of the cross country team that
did not make the trip to the NCAAs.
"They know they're a part of this."
"Because of the depth of the*
team, not everyone is able to run*
every race," Hill said. "But every
one contributes in some fashion to
our success."
Stanford finally got it right**
After being so close for four years"
the Cardinal pulled it together
and showed how to be a team.
Next year holds as much, if not
more, promise than this year as all*
the runners from the national*
squad will be back, a horde of red
shirts will return, and one of the
best recruiting classes in the nation,
is already being assembled.
The distance squad now moves
on to indoor and outdoor track,
which are more individually ori
ented, but the memories of this
season and the teamwork that
brought the Cardinal to success
will not quickly diminish.

its fifth man at Pac-lOs.
Junior Adam Tenforde
reemerged as an elite distance
runner by claiming All-America
honors after redshirting the last
cross country season.
Freshman Peter Meindl was the
only true freshman to run on Stan
ford's varsity squad this year, while
junior Andrew Hill claimed his first
ever collegiate victory at the Ari

zona State Invitational on Oct. 11
Sophomore Ryan Hall posted
two commanding victories this
season and claimed All-Ameri<s
honors at NCAAs to finish a solid
season for the Cardinal.
However, Stanford's top lour
put on a show at the NCAA Cham
pionships that will be hard to re
peat. /Ml four are much
over last year, building anticipzf
tion and excitement for the upC
coming track season.
But most importantly, the guys
on the squad and the coaches will
say that it is the effort of every single
runner that makes this team great.
"Twenty-eight runners ran for
28 minutes at 10:15 a.m. Pacific
time [on the day of the NCAA
Championships] and finished with
a hard 000 meters on the track,"
Lananna said, referring to mem
bers of the cross country team that
did not make the trip to the NCAAs.
"They know they're a part of this."
"Because of the depth of the*
team, not everyone is able to run*
every race," Hill said. "But every
one contributes in some fashion to
our success."
Stanford finally got it right**
After being so close for four years"
the Cardinal pulled it together
and showed how to be a team.
Next year holds as much, if not
more, promise than this year as all*
the runners from the national*
squad will be back, a horde of red
shirts will return, and one of the
best recruiting classes in the nation,
is already being assembled.
The distance squad now moves
on to indoor and outdoor track,
which are more individually ori
ented, but the memories of this
season and the teamwork that
brought the Cardinal to success
will not quickly diminish.
There is one word lo describe
the success of the Stanford men's
crosscountry this fall: teamwork.
"It was all about the team,"
said junior Grant Robison after
the Cardinal's victory at the
NCAA Championships in Terre
Haute, Intl., last Monday
Stanford claimed its third
NCAA title in seven years to cap
a dream season during which
the squad was ranked first in
every poll after the opening pre
season rankings were released.
It was a common sight to see
the Stanford pack leading a race
and setting the pace. Even at the
NCAA Western Regionals held
on the Stanford Golf Course on
Nov. 10, the Cardinal put six
runners in the front and ran as a
team to dominate No. 5 Oregon.
But this team effort hardly
diminished the individual ac
complishments of the Stanford
runners.
A Cardinal athlete won all
but two races the squad entered
this year, including individual
victories by Robison and junior
Don Sage at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships on
Nov. 2 and at the Western Re
gionals, respectively.
"We run as a pack," said ju

nior lan Dobson. "But we aren't
going to sacrifice places to stay as
a pack the whole race."
In the Pac-10 race, a group of
10 Stanford runners led
through 3,000 meters before
stringing out the race. Although
three of the athletes broke late to
take the top three spots, the team
effort placed seven Cardinal
runners in the top nine to de
molish a very talented field.
"Every race, our goal is to put
a group of guys near the front of
the race," said Vin Lananna, di
rector of cross country and track
and field. "We want to be in po
sition lo win as a team, and the
guys will race how they need to
accomplish this goal."
Overall this year, the Cardi
nal posted eight team victories
and one third-place showing as a
"IV' team in the long course race
of the Stanford Invitational on
Sept. 28.
But the most impressive vic
tory for the Cardinal was its
NCAA title.
Even in a field that con
tained the most talented dis
tance runners in the nation,
Stanford wasted no time mov
ing to the front.
Halfway through the 10,000-
meter race, the announcer said,
"Stanford is making a mockery of
(lie team race with four guys right
near the top 10."
The Stanford pack slowly
picked oil runners as they faded
during the race, and, at the finish,
Robison lead four Stanford run
ners into the top 10 with his own
third-place finish.
Juniors Sage, Louis Luchini
and lan Dobson claimed fifth,
sixth and ninth, respectively, giv
ing one of the most dominating
team performances at the NCAA
Championships in the last 10
years.
In all, six Stanford runners
claimed All-America titles as the
Cardinal scored just 47 points, fin
ishing well ahead of runner-up
Wisconsin's 107.
"I think this is a better com
bined team effort than in 1996
[when Stanford claimed both the
men's and women's titles],"
Lananna said.
Individual successes this year
were not limited to just the big
race winners like Robison and
Sage. Redshirt freshman Neil
Davis surprised the nation by run
ning on Stanford's varsity unit
most of the season and running as
its fifth man at Pac-lOs.
Junior Adam Tenforde
reemerged as an elite distance
runner by claiming All-America
