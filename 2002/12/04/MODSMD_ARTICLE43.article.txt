# No. 2 finish caps strong season for Card women
## 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
The 2002 season was by far the
most successful season for the
Stanford women's cross country
team since it won the national
championships in 1996. The
team was undefeated in every
race until the NGAA Champi
onships last week, where the Car
dinal pulled out a second-place
finish behind defending national
champion Brigham Young.
Three different team mem
bers — senior Lauren Fleshman
and sophomores Sara Bei and
Alicia Craig — led the team at
points throughout the season,
demonstrating the tremendous
depth of the Stanford program.
1 lowever, as opposed to some
of the overly serious attitudes that
characterized some of the teams
lining up across from the Cardi
nal at nationals, the Stanford
team members managed to keep
a balanced perspective through
out the season.
"Right until the gun went off
[at nationals], we were still smiling
and happy," senior Malindi El
more said. "We know you don't
have to be super serious to run
fast."
This attitude was clearly visible
at the finish line at NCAAs last
Monday, where team members

were hugging each other and
congratulating their teammates
on an excellent race.
"Everyone was smiling after
the race," Fleshman said. "Our
No. 1 goal was for all of us to
find each other at the finish and
be happy."
This attitude, combined with
one of the hardest workout pro
grams in the country, set up the
Cardinal for success through
out the year. In almost every
race, Bei, Craig and Fleshman
would be inseparable at the
front of the field, setting a vi
cious pace that simply wore
down their competitors.
The trio would finish within
seconds of each other, pushing
their teammates all the way to the
line. The winner of the race was
the Stanford runner with the best
legs that day.
Bei and Craig opened the
season with a warning shot to
their competitors at the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational,
crossing the finish line so close to
each other that the judges could
not determine an individual
winner. The next racer was their
teammate Elmore 29 seconds
back, while the first non-Stan
ford runner finished with a 36-
second deficit.
While the Stanford runner on
the top step of the podium changed
race to race, almost invariably Bei,
Craig and Flesh man were at the
front of affairs. Bei and Craig
placed first and second, respective
ly, at the Stanford Invitational
6,000-meter race on Sept. 28, and it
was 1-2-3 respectively for Bei,
Fleshman and Craig at the presti
gious Notre Dame Invitational a
week later.
Behind these three, runners
such as Elmore, seniors Erin Sulli
van and Katie Hotchkiss and

sophomores Jeane Goff'and Anita
Siraki were used to fill out the
seven-women varsity squad.
At nationals, these runners were
crucial in helping Stanford secure
its second-place position. Elmore
and Sullivan were the fourth and
fifth scoring runners for the Cardi
nal, while Goff and Siraki ran
strong races, pushing up the point
totals of other teams.
While coverage of the team usu
ally focused on Bei, Craig and
Fleshman, many spectators and
running fans at nationals were sur
prised when Elmore posted an
1 lth-place finish at NCAAs, firmly
establishing herself as one of the
best in the country.
Elmore had been 20 to 30 sec

onds behind her three teammates
throughout the season, but her ex
perience allowed her to under
stand her body and bring it to a
peak at nationals. The gap be
tween her and Craig on the big day
was a mere 13 seconds.
Before nationals, Elmore said,
"I am really confident about my
ability to have a strong and fast last
kilometer. I feel like my best cross
country race is yet to come — by
being patient through the begin
ning, tough through the middle,
and racing the last part to my
fullest ability."
In the final cross country race
of her collegiate career, she did
just that, sitting behind the lead
pack in the opening segment and

then passing those who had start
ed too fast.
"I love going into the last kilo
meter and knowing I have some
thing left to give," she said. "And
as people start to fade, I'm ready
to go."
Although Stanford will miss El
more, Fleshman, Sullivan and
Hotchkiss next year, the team will
benefit from a strong recruiting
class and the new leadership
regime of Craig, Bei and Goff.
With now two-time defending
champion BYU returning three
of its top four runners, Stan
ford's leaders will have their
work cut out for them to get the
2003 squad to the top step of the
NCAA podium.
