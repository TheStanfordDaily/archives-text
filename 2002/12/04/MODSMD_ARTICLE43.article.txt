# No. 2 finish caps strong season for Card women
## 
### ERIK SPERLING STAFF WRITER 
The 2002 season was by far the
most successful season for the
Stanford women's cross country
team since it won the national
championships in 1996. The
team was undefeated in every
race until the NGAA Champi
onships last week, where the Car
dinal pulled out a second-place
finish behind defending national
champion Brigham Young.
Three different team mem
bers — senior Lauren Fleshman
and sophomores Sara Bei and
Alicia Craig — led the team at
points throughout the season,
demonstrating the tremendous
depth of the Stanford program.
1 lowever, as opposed to some
of the overly serious attitudes that
characterized some of the teams
lining up across from the Cardi
nal at nationals, the Stanford
team members managed to keep
a balanced perspective through
out the season.
"Right until the gun went off
[at nationals], we were still smiling
and happy," senior Malindi El
more said. "We know you don't
have to be super serious to run
fast."
This attitude was clearly visible
at the finish line at NCAAs last
Monday, where team members

were hugging each other and
congratulating their teammates
on an excellent race.
"Everyone was smiling after
the race," Fleshman said. "Our
No. 1 goal was for all of us to
find each other at the finish and
be happy."
This attitude, combined with
one of the hardest workout pro
grams in the country, set up the
Cardinal for success through
out the year. In almost every
race, Bei, Craig and Fleshman
would be inseparable at the
front of the field, setting a vi
cious pace that simply wore
down their competitors.
The trio would finish within
seconds of each other, pushing
their teammates all the way to the
line. The winner of the race was
the Stanford runner with the best
legs that day.
Bei and Craig opened the
season with a warning shot to
their competitors at the Cal
State-Fullerton Invitational,
crossing the finish line so close to
each other that the judges could
not determine an individual
winner. The next racer was their
teammate Elmore 29 seconds
back, while the first non-Stan
ford runner finished with a 36-
second deficit.
