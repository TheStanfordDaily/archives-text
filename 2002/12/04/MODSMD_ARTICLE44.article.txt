at Lone Star Duals, Jan. 4

The Cardinal earned wins over Menlo College
and San Francisco State in early-season dual
meet action, while dropping a pair of matches to
Navy and Cal State-Fullerton.
In its most recent action last Saturday, the Car
dinal placed eight wrestlers at the California
Open. Stanford hopes the tournament was both
something to build on and learn from.
"More than anything this early in the year I'm
happy that we have something to look at to de
cide what needs to worked on," Stanford head
coach Steve Buddie said.
A trio of redshirt sophomores has led the Car
dinal in the early going.
Brad Metzler, who captured first place at tfie
California Open, leads the team with an 8-0
record and 34.5 team points at 133. Metzler is
well on his way to surpassing his win total of 16
last season and recorded the first technical fall of
his collegiate career earlier this year.
At 149, Scott Polley has also tallied eight wins,
including a pin, to go along with just one loss.

Despite missing the first two dual meets due to
a sickness, Matt Gentry is showing no ill effects of
bumping up to 157 from 149 over the summer,
posting a 7-2 record with one pin.
Stanford's two seniors, Justin Walker and
Harold Penson, have won six and four bouts, re
spectively, thus far.
Meanwhile, Stanford's redshirt freshmen
have pulled their weight as well.
Ryan 112 lagen has six wins, Brennan Corbett
boasts four and heavyweight Shawn Ritzenthaler
has picked up three, including a meet-deciding
pin against San Francisco State.
Unlike last year, healing injuries is not a
major concern for the (Cardinal heading into the
break. However, there are still areas for the
squad to address.
" This break is a mixed bag," Buddie said. "Es
pecially after finals, I think it's very important lor
these guys to go home, see family and rest. But
one month is too long. We really have to trust
that these guys have reasonable workout situa
tions at home."
About hall the team will return to action at the
Midlands Tournament in Evanston, 111., to be
held in Welsh-Ryan arena on the campus of
Northwestern from Dec. 29 to Dec. 30. The two
day competition includes entrants from some of
the most traditionally strong wrestling programs
in the country, such as lowa and lowa State.
The Cardinal sent six wrestlers to the compe
tition last year, including junior Nathan Peter
son, Penson, Metzler, Gentry, Polleyand Walker.
The entire team will make its return to the mat
after New Year's, as Stanford makes its second

consecutive appearance at the Lone Star Duals in
Arlington, Texas, on Jan. 4. The Cardinal will
square off against Virginia, Wyoming and Ne
braska in the span of one day.
The Cornhuskers are ranked No. 13 and
opened die season with a 20-19 win over Pacific
-10 Conference power No. 12 Arizona State.
Nebraska's roster includes three wrestlers
ranked fifth or higher in the nation in their re
spective weight classes, including Justin Ruiz who
is ranked second at 197.
"It'll be a good test," Buddie said. "Getting ex
perience against nationally recognized programs
is invaluable."
Although less nationally recognized, Virginia
has a respectable program, sending three
wrestlers to the NCAA Championships last year.
One of those three, Tim Foley at 157, leads the
Cavaliers this year, along with Brian Muir at 174
and senior heavyweight Josh Etu. Etu recently fin
ished second at Cornell's Body Bar Invitational.
Wyoming is 1-1 this year, losing to Boise State
20-12 and knocking offUC-l)avis 19-18.
"I'd like to say I'd like to win them all, but the
most important thing to me is that we are
wrestling with excitement, getting better every
day and correcting and doing the things that we
teach in our room," Buddie said. "Exciting
wrestling is what we're looking for and we're get
ting there, but we're not there yet."
The Cardinal went 2-1 at the Lone Star tour
nament last season, defeating Princeton and
Northwestern before falling to Brown.
Stanford's next home meet will be Jan. 9 against
Pennsylvania.
