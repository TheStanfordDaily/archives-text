# ASSU-sponsored forum will-focus on issues raised in survey
## Hennessy, students to meet 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow at 8 p.m., University Presi
dent John Hennessy will hold a town hall
meeting at Tresidder Oak West to address
the student concerns identified as the most
pressing in a recent survey.
ASSU President Monica Henestroza, a
senior, and Vice President Nick Rodriguez,
a junior, made arrangements for the event
earlier in the quarter.
"We asked President Hennessy to make
himself available to students for open dia
logue and feedback on various student is
sues," Rodriguez said.
"We have always been concerned
with the low level of access to Universi
ty decision-makers that students have,"
he added.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
has also been conducting research to
identify the areas of student interest on
campus.
• Executive Communication Director and
Chair of the Undergraduate Senate Life
Committee Joey Natoli, a sophomore, ex
plained the results of this inquiry.
"Earlier this year, the ASSU conduct
ed a survey called Survey of the Farm and
that indicated that the three most salient
issues at Stanford are cost of living, stu
dent space and transportation," Natoli
said.
Natoli said he hopes the issues of cost
of living and student space will be ad
dressed tomorrow.
Rodriguez pointed out that he consid
ers these issues some of the most important
on campus.
"Better transportation options for stu

dents, better and cheaper student space, a
lower cost of living on campus, a safe and
supportive campus, and accountability of
University decision-makers to stu
dents ... are the issues we campaigned on,
and [we] will attempt to follow through on
them through the end of our term," Ro
driguez said.
Rodriguez emphasized the impor
tance of tomorrow night's event for the
student body.
"This forum is a necessary first step to
wards holding the University's leaders ac
countable to the concerns of students, who,
lacking the money or clout that alumni and
faculty have, are traditionally overlooked
in the great game of interest-group politics
that is a part of any university," Rodriguez
said.
"Making the president accessible to
students in a setting like a Town Hall
meeting is a great idea," said junior Matt
Bricker. "I think that Stanford students
have a reasonable level of access to pro
fessors, but establishing real communica
tion with prominent members of the ad
ministration is fairly difficult. 1 just wish
they wouldn't have scheduled it during
Dead Week."
Speculating on the reasons why Presi
dent Hennessy agreed to the forum, Ro
driguez said, "President Hennessy recog
nizes that it is important to promote civil
dialogue between students and Universi
ty leaders."
"Student grievances have led t« major
conflicts in the past, and I think that both
the ASSU and the University President's
Office agree that there are better ways to re
solve disputes. Such a civil dialogue is one of
them," Rodriguez added.
