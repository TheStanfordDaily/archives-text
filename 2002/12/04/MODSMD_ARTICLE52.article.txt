# Bond gets tortured, lots of play in spy latest flick

### PHIL FLORES 
Whenever some guy utters the semi
nal phrase "Bond. James Bond," you
first check to see if the dude looks the
part (fancy tuxedo, suave smile, et al). If

he does, you think to yourself,
"Cool." Thankfully, Pierce
Brosnan returns to the role

that he has personified for
the past seven years and four
Bond flicks. Brosnan is one
smooth operator whose
charm and looks have pro
pelled the Bond franchise
from those Timothy Dalton

also-rans of the late '80s and early '90s to
definite must-see blockbusters. Unfortu
nately for this latest Bond movie, "Die
Another Day," Brosnan cannot sustain
what is ultimately a pretty bad movie.
Directed by Lee Tamahori, "Die An
other Day" stars Halle Berry as U.S. NSA
agent Jinx whose ability to strut around
in cute bikinis and low-cut dresses some
how helps her to do her job. What a re
cent Oscar winner is doing in a Bond
movie baffles me. Don't tell that to fellow
Oscar winner Dame Judi Dench, who
reprises her role as M, Bond's steel-eyed
boss. Toby Stephens also stars as Bond's
latest and most original nemesis, Gustav
Graves, a rich megalomaniac bent on

world conquest. It's amazing that those
writers haven't come up with that one
before!
The script, written by Neal Purvis and
Robert Wade (whose previous Bond

tlick "The World Is Not
Enough" made some mad

loot for MGM), is simply terri-

ble. They fill the movie
with an almost endless
amount of double enten
dres and blatant sexual in
nuendo that makes "Die
Another Day"a lame paro
dy of the Bond series itself.
Bond's exchanges with

the sexy Jinx amount to such cheesy
one-liners that it's simply incredible that
Bond could get anyone, let alone Halle
Berry, to sleep with him. Even when
Dench's M shows up, the lack of intensi
ty and bad blood between Bond and M
that usually characterize their dialogue
makes a bad script worse.
However, a few things do redeem this
movie to some extent. First, the film fea
tures some pretty nifty action sequences
that include hydroplanes, exploding
landmines, lasers and a makeshift snow
board, just to name a few. The action is
first-rate. Tamahori utilizes intense shots
and Michael Bay-esque (fast) cutting that
make the usual Bond thrills somewhat

new and fresh. Also, John Cleese enters
his role as the new Q, Bond's irascible
gadgeteer. The scene between Bond and
Q features good one-liners and just
enough Cleese witticisms that it is easily
the movie's best moment.
"Die Another Day" is a passable at
tempt at a Bond movie. It serves up all
the usual big action, fast women and cool
gadgets that any Bond fan could want.

Sometimes, we give Bond flicks some
leeway and forgive their no-IQ plots and
cheeky dialogue. Here, however, these
relatively key components that make up
a quality movie are severely lacking.
Maybe when Brosnan suits up as Bond
the next time, we'll leave the movie the
ater with some semblance of hope that
human beings still possess that little
thing known as creativity.
