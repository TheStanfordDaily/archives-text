# Contemplation, Clooney's bare ass inhabit world of ‘Solaris’
## 
### ERICK FLORES 
The third time's the creative charm for
dynamic duo Steven Soderbergh and
George Clooney in the big-screen adapta
tion of Stanislaw Lem's novel "Solaris." Re
ceivingboth critical and audience praise for
their previous works "Out of Sight" and
"Ocean's Eleven," the director-actor team
returns, leaving popcorn flicks and block
buster-hood behind for more challenging
and stimulating brain fodder.
Wasting no time and ditching the open
ing credits, the filmmaker dives right into

the story, but not before grabbing the

viewer's hand. The first
shots of the movie are in
triguing. They're incoher-

ent, inter-spliced like pieces
of an unsolved puzzle that
say nothing. And I mean
nothing, because they are
absolutely silent. But even
in their silence, the scenes
are by no means quiet.

The speechless introduction hones the
audience's focus toward deciphering the
messages presented and also sets the

somber, sullen tone for the rest of
the movie. "Solaris" never comes

across, however, as depressing or

mopey; rather, it has an aura of
peaceful pensiveness that
plagues its characters, but pleas
es its audience.
Clooney plays Dr. Calvin,
who in a not-too-distant-future is
sent out to rescue a NASA mis
sion gone wrong on the planet

Solaris. When lie arrives at the space sta
tion, he finds only two semi-delirious astro
nauts; the rest of the crew is either missing

or dead after committing suicide. Even
more mysterious, Calvin awakens in the
middle of the night to discover his wife,
whose death he had been mourning, in bed
next to him. Apparently, Solaris manufac
tures mirages, identical replicas of lost
loved ones for its visitors.
A genre menage a trois, the film is part
drama, part romance and part science fic
tion, but weeds out the unwanted overact
ing, sappy love cliches and Star Trek-esque
geekdom. "Solaris" is eerie, but not because
of aliens, explosive action sequences or in
tense chase scenes. It almost feels like a
brainchild of the late Stanley Kubrick — a
concoction of mind-jumbling events and
images that weird you out, because, in the
midst of putting the pieces together, your
subconscious fears the final picture.
Notions and distortions of reality are ad
dressed, without going all "Vanilla Sty" on
us. Clooney, in trademark character as the
dark, retreated man's man, must decide
how far he will go to change his past. In the
end, "Solaris" asks what is more important:
reality or happiness.

The flick's few missteps are minor.
Clooney hardly gives his best performance,
at times feeling a bit forced in his role.
Maybe he thought that bearing his ass on
screen for the first time could allow fora
half-assed acting job. And the recurring
shots of the actual planet — which are in no
way amazing — become a bit tedious and
overdone, often seeming out of place and
unnecessary.
Undoubtedly "Solaris" will be a love-it
or-hate-it type of movie. I, for one, walked
out scratching my head at what first
seemed like very abstract, nonsensical bull
shit. It wasn't until I was driving home that
the collage of disorderly film clips turned
into a more complete, holistic big picture.
When interviewing a surviving
crewmember, Clooney is told, "I could tell
you what's happening, but that wouldn't
really tell you what's happening." Nothing
could be truer for this film, which gets
bonus points for doing a movie the right
way and showing the story, rather than
telling it.


Hunk ... FROM OUTER SPACE!
