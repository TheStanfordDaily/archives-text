# What's the deal with this pop life and when's it gonna fade out?
## 
### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
II" tiie name Duncan Sheik does not ring a
bell, surely the song "Barely Breathing" will
take you back to the middle school days of Sony
Walkmen and neon scrunchies. Sheik, who, in
the early '90s, paved the way for today's male
solo pop artists such as John Mayer, h;is re
cently released his fourth album, Daylight. Al
though constantly labeled a one-track pop mu
sician, the Brown University graduate has a di
verse musical resume. In 2001, Sheik released
the album "Phantom Moon," which was writ
ten in collaboration with playwright Steven
Sater. Music critics praised "Phantom Moon"
as being on both the intellectual and conceptu
;d level of musician Nick Drake. This summer,
Sheik composed original music for die Public
Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival's
presentation of Twelfth Night. I had a chance
to sit down with the soft-spoken intellectual and
talk to him about the release of his new album,
and his feelings on the pop stigma that has ulti
mately been both a blessing and a curse for his
music oireer.
INTERMISSION: Today, you are consid
ered a pop musician. Pop though, encom
passes many artists that span from NSYNC to
Avril Lavigne to the Goo Goo Dolls. What do
you think of the pop music and pop musicians
that are in the same category as yourself?

SHEIK: I know... I got pushed into this pop
category. I had a song on the radio a million
years ago ("Barely Breathing") and people
perceived me as a pop artist having not lis
tened to the whole album. But in all due re
spect to all the people you mentioned, their
musical goals are about as far apart from mine
as anything.
INTERMISSION: What are your musical
goals?
SHEIK: 1 have a wide range. I think that the
music that moves me tends to be music that
don't have a lot to do with convention and
normal kind of pop music formulas. 1 like
things that are sonically and harmonically un
predictable. Eccentric, unique things that are
moving in a very kind of profound way. Pop
music today is made out to be "fun," but that
does not make it the most interesting music. I
believe that great music is music that mani
fests itself into almost intense sadness.
INTERMISSION: But your new single "On
A High" seems to be so poppy, not sad.
SHEIK: Look closely at the lyrics. That is
where I had some fun — tricking the audi
ence into thinking it's a happy song. It's actu
ally one of the darker lyrics on the record. Ba
sically meaning that everyone tries anything
they can to prop up their mood in order to
make themselves happy, when in reality, it's
all just a delusion.

INTERMISSION: How is "Daylight" differ
ent from your previous three albums?
SHEIK: Personally, I think "Daylight" is
more well made; a better group of songs. And
stylistically it's not very far from "Humming"
(Sheik's second album). I see it as the other
side of the coin of "Phantom Moon." "Phan
tom Moon" was something that was meant to
be very somber, anti-pop record. "Daylight"
takes the idea of pop music and its framework,
and bends it into something interesting.
INTERMISSION: There are a lot of love
songs or songs directed toward some kind of
lover on this album. Did you have a muse dur
ing your lyric writing process?
SHEIK: Oooo. I don't want to get into trou
ble for this . . . Well, let's just say that there
were many different experiences over the
past three to four years, while I was writing
these songs, so there have been many differ
ent people in my life. It would not be fair to
single any one person out.
INTERMISSION: C ritics say that this album
has a lot more rock style in it than the other
three. Did you purposefully sit down and say,
"This is going to divert from pop and be more
of a rock composition?'
SHEIK: I think that if you take specific songs
like "Genius" or "Magazines" or "Good
Morning," those songs are definitely coming
from a tradition of classic rock such as the

more mellower mo
ments of Led Zeppelin
or Pink Floyd. They al
most have, like an early
'90s alternative rock
album feel with a quiet
verse and loud chorus.
Very self-deprecating
lyrics that are supposed
to be funny. There are
a few more electric gui
tar moments that lead
people to believe the
album was more rock.
What's interesting to
me, is that today, in
order to be considered
a rock band, you have
to be Martial Stacks on
10 all the time, and
your audience needs to
be Satan worshippers.
But you know, bands
from the '60s and '70s
weren't always heavy all
the time. I'd like to
think of myself as also
having that singer /
songwriter tradition
like Elton John.
INTERMISSION:
Many pop musicians
stay away from writing
political songs because
they believe it is not
their place. You reside
in NYC; have you felt
the need to use your
music as an outlet to ex
press the events and po
litical crisis surrounding
the world right now?

SHEIK: Well, 1 think it's appropriate for
someone like Bruce Springsteen who is
probably much wiser and has more years on
me to tackle those kind of things. Bono, for
example, has a right to speak politically be
cause, in a way, that's his mission. He grew
up in a very war-torn environment, and it
makes sense for him to do that. I went to
boarding school, and 1 had a very cushy life.
I don't have anything to complain about.
Meanwhile, there is enormous room for im
provement politically, economically and so
cially. I'm more interested in writing songs
more personally cathartic and cathartic with
in the individual who listens. That's more my
domain. It will still ultimately have a positive
elfect. If people have beautiful things inside
of them, they can do no harm. So in my own
small way, I try to promote ideals of nonvio
lence and compassion through my music.
INTERMISSION: How has Buddhism in
spired you as an artist?
SHEIK: Many of the things I just said come
from my Buddhist practice and the many
levels that it operates on. When you chant,
you plug into this huge, incredible source of
creative energy. Whatever inspiration musi
cally or otherwise is generated from my Bud
dhist practice. On the more important level
of being a good person and creating value in
a positive way — that comes from studying
wisdom.
INTERMISSION: Who are you listening to
right now?
SHEIK: Beth Orton. Beck's new record. I'm
definitely getting a great education from
Ben Folds being on tour with him.
INTERMISSION: Lyrically you've collabo
rated with some pretty amazing people (leg
endary Foreigner guitarist / songwriter
Mick Jones and Steven Sater) and have been
compared to the extraordinary Nick Drake.
When writing your lyrics, what message or
internal meaning do you wish to convey
through your music?
SHEIK: It really depends on the song.
There are a host of things one tries to convey.
The lyric-writing process was different when
writing "Daylight." I wrote down experi
ences I had in a very kind of almost non
judgmental way. I tried to make it as poetic
and instrumental as possible without posing
a theme on any of the lyrics. Afterward some
times a very interesting theme would
emerge from that process. I like writing a
lyric and not over-determining what its mes
sage is, and the message will make itself.
INTERMISSION: Most people believe that
college and rock stars don't fall hand-in
hand. Do you think that if you had gone into
the music industry straight out of high
school, you would have had the same success
today after graduating from Brown?
SHEIK: Surely things would be different.
But I think had I not gone to school, I
would still be making music anyway. My ca
reer may be much more advanced, and I
would have had more time to play live if I
had gone straight from high school. But I
really can't dwell on those kinds of things. I
had a great time at Brown, so it's all kind of
worked itself out.

you plug into this huge, incredible source of
creative energy. Whatever inspiration musi
cally or otherwise is generated from my Bud
dhist practice. On the more important level
of being a good person and creating value in
a positive way — that comes from studying
wisdom.
INTERMISSION: Who are you listening to
right now?
SHEIK: Beth Orton. Beck's new record. I'm
definitely getting a great education from
Ben Folds being on tour with him.
INTERMISSION: Lyrically you've collabo
rated with some pretty amazing people (leg
endary Foreigner guitarist / songwriter
Mick Jones and Steven Sater) and have been
compared to the extraordinary Nick Drake.
When writing your lyrics, what message or
internal meaning do you wish to convey
through your music?
SHEIK: It really depends on the song.
There are a host of things one tries to convey.
The lyric-writing process was different when
writing "Daylight." I wrote down experi
ences I had in a very kind of almost non
judgmental way. I tried to make it as poetic
and instrumental as possible without posing
a theme on any of the lyrics. Afterward some
times a very interesting theme would
emerge from that process. I like writing a
lyric and not over-determining what its mes
sage is, and the message will make itself.
INTERMISSION: Most people believe that
college and rock stars don't fall hand-in
hand. Do you think that if you had gone into
the music industry straight out of high
school, you would have had the same success
today after graduating from Brown?
SHEIK: Surely things would be different.
But I think had I not gone to school, I
would still be making music anyway. My ca
reer may be much more advanced, and I
would have had more time to play live if I
had gone straight from high school. But I
really can't dwell on those kinds of things. I
had a great time at Brown, so it's all kind of
worked itself out.


Duncan Sheik — Bumpkin Freak.
II" tiie name Duncan Sheik does not ring a
bell, surely the song "Barely Breathing" will
take you back to the middle school days of Sony
Walkmen and neon scrunchies. Sheik, who, in
the early '90s, paved the way for today's male
solo pop artists such as John Mayer, h;is re
cently released his fourth album, Daylight. Al
though constantly labeled a one-track pop mu
sician, the Brown University graduate has a di
verse musical resume. In 2001, Sheik released
the album "Phantom Moon," which was writ
ten in collaboration with playwright Steven
Sater. Music critics praised "Phantom Moon"
as being on both the intellectual and conceptu
;d level of musician Nick Drake. This summer,
Sheik composed original music for die Public
Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival's
presentation of Twelfth Night. I had a chance
to sit down with the soft-spoken intellectual and
talk to him about the release of his new album,
and his feelings on the pop stigma that has ulti
mately been both a blessing and a curse for his
music oireer.
INTERMISSION: Today, you are consid
ered a pop musician. Pop though, encom
passes many artists that span from NSYNC to
Avril Lavigne to the Goo Goo Dolls. What do
you think of the pop music and pop musicians
that are in the same category as yourself?

SHEIK: I know... I got pushed into this pop
category. I had a song on the radio a million
years ago ("Barely Breathing") and people
perceived me as a pop artist having not lis
tened to the whole album. But in all due re
spect to all the people you mentioned, their
musical goals are about as far apart from mine
as anything.
INTERMISSION: What are your musical
goals?
SHEIK: 1 have a wide range. I think that the
music that moves me tends to be music that
don't have a lot to do with convention and
normal kind of pop music formulas. 1 like
things that are sonically and harmonically un
predictable. Eccentric, unique things that are
moving in a very kind of profound way. Pop
music today is made out to be "fun," but that
does not make it the most interesting music. I
believe that great music is music that mani
fests itself into almost intense sadness.
INTERMISSION: But your new single "On
A High" seems to be so poppy, not sad.
SHEIK: Look closely at the lyrics. That is
where I had some fun — tricking the audi
ence into thinking it's a happy song. It's actu
ally one of the darker lyrics on the record. Ba
sically meaning that everyone tries anything
they can to prop up their mood in order to
make themselves happy, when in reality, it's
all just a delusion.

INTERMISSION: How is "Daylight" differ
ent from your previous three albums?
SHEIK: Personally, I think "Daylight" is
more well made; a better group of songs. And
stylistically it's not very far from "Humming"
(Sheik's second album). I see it as the other
side of the coin of "Phantom Moon." "Phan
tom Moon" was something that was meant to
be very somber, anti-pop record. "Daylight"
takes the idea of pop music and its framework,
and bends it into something interesting.
INTERMISSION: There are a lot of love
songs or songs directed toward some kind of
lover on this album. Did you have a muse dur
ing your lyric writing process?
SHEIK: Oooo. I don't want to get into trou
ble for this . . . Well, let's just say that there
were many different experiences over the
past three to four years, while I was writing
these songs, so there have been many differ
ent people in my life. It would not be fair to
single any one person out.
INTERMISSION: C ritics say that this album
has a lot more rock style in it than the other
three. Did you purposefully sit down and say,
"This is going to divert from pop and be more
of a rock composition?'
SHEIK: I think that if you take specific songs
like "Genius" or "Magazines" or "Good
Morning," those songs are definitely coming
from a tradition of classic rock such as the

more mellower mo
ments of Led Zeppelin
or Pink Floyd. They al
most have, like an early
'90s alternative rock
album feel with a quiet
verse and loud chorus.
Very self-deprecating
lyrics that are supposed
to be funny. There are
a few more electric gui
tar moments that lead
people to believe the
album was more rock.
What's interesting to
me, is that today, in
order to be considered
a rock band, you have
to be Martial Stacks on
10 all the time, and
your audience needs to
be Satan worshippers.
But you know, bands
from the '60s and '70s
weren't always heavy all
the time. I'd like to
think of myself as also
having that singer /
songwriter tradition
like Elton John.
INTERMISSION:
Many pop musicians
stay away from writing
political songs because
they believe it is not
their place. You reside
in NYC; have you felt
the need to use your
music as an outlet to ex
press the events and po
litical crisis surrounding
the world right now?

SHEIK: Well, 1 think it's appropriate for
someone like Bruce Springsteen who is
probably much wiser and has more years on
me to tackle those kind of things. Bono, for
example, has a right to speak politically be
cause, in a way, that's his mission. He grew
up in a very war-torn environment, and it
makes sense for him to do that. I went to
boarding school, and 1 had a very cushy life.
I don't have anything to complain about.
Meanwhile, there is enormous room for im
provement politically, economically and so
cially. I'm more interested in writing songs
more personally cathartic and cathartic with
in the individual who listens. That's more my
domain. It will still ultimately have a positive
elfect. If people have beautiful things inside
of them, they can do no harm. So in my own
small way, I try to promote ideals of nonvio
lence and compassion through my music.
INTERMISSION: How has Buddhism in
spired you as an artist?
SHEIK: Many of the things I just said come
from my Buddhist practice and the many
levels that it operates on. When you chant,
you plug into this huge, incredible source of
creative energy. Whatever inspiration musi
cally or otherwise is generated from my Bud
dhist practice. On the more important level
of being a good person and creating value in
a positive way — that comes from studying
wisdom.
INTERMISSION: Who are you listening to

What's interesting to
me, is that today, in
order to be considered
a rock band, you have
to be Martial Stacks on
10 all the time, and
your audience needs to
be Satan worshippers.
But you know, bands
from the '60s and '70s
weren't always heavy all
the time. I'd like to
think of myself as also
having that singer /
songwriter tradition
like Elton John.
INTERMISSION:
Many pop musicians
stay away from writing
political songs because
they believe it is not
their place. You reside
in NYC; have you felt
the need to use your
music as an outlet to ex
press the events and po
litical crisis surrounding
the world right now?

SHEIK: Well, 1 think it's appropriate for
someone like Bruce Springsteen who is
probably much wiser and has more years on
me to tackle those kind of things. Bono, for
example, has a right to speak politically be
cause, in a way, that's his mission. He grew
up in a very war-torn environment, and it
makes sense for him to do that. I went to
boarding school, and 1 had a very cushy life.
I don't have anything to complain about.
Meanwhile, there is enormous room for im
provement politically, economically and so
cially. I'm more interested in writing songs
more personally cathartic and cathartic with
in the individual who listens. That's more my
domain. It will still ultimately have a positive
elfect. If people have beautiful things inside
of them, they can do no harm. So in my own
small way, I try to promote ideals of nonvio
lence and compassion through my music.
INTERMISSION: How has Buddhism in
spired you as an artist?
SHEIK: Many of the things I just said come
from my Buddhist practice and the many
levels that it operates on. When you chant,
you plug into this huge, incredible source of
creative energy. Whatever inspiration musi
cally or otherwise is generated from my Bud
dhist practice. On the more important level
of being a good person and creating value in
a positive way — that comes from studying
wisdom.
INTERMISSION: Who are you listening to
right now?
SHEIK: Beth Orton. Beck's new record. I'm
definitely getting a great education from
Ben Folds being on tour with him.
INTERMISSION: Lyrically you've collabo
rated with some pretty amazing people (leg
endary Foreigner guitarist / songwriter
Mick Jones and Steven Sater) and have been
compared to the extraordinary Nick Drake.
When writing your lyrics, what message or
internal meaning do you wish to convey
through your music?
SHEIK: It really depends on the song.
There are a host of things one tries to convey.
The lyric-writing process was different when
writing "Daylight." I wrote down experi
ences I had in a very kind of almost non
judgmental way. I tried to make it as poetic
and instrumental as possible without posing
a theme on any of the lyrics. Afterward some
times a very interesting theme would
emerge from that process. I like writing a
lyric and not over-determining what its mes
sage is, and the message will make itself.
INTERMISSION: Most people believe that
college and rock stars don't fall hand-in
hand. Do you think that if you had gone into
the music industry straight out of high
school, you would have had the same success
today after graduating from Brown?
SHEIK: Surely things would be different.
But I think had I not gone to school, I
would still be making music anyway. My ca
reer may be much more advanced, and I
would have had more time to play live if I
had gone straight from high school. But I
really can't dwell on those kinds of things. I
had a great time at Brown, so it's all kind of
worked itself out.
