# Just in time for the holidays: A wish list for the geeks in your life
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Let's start with a confession: I'm
a complete science fiction geek. Per
haps not your standard, stereotypi
cal sci-fi geek — "Star Wars" and
"Star Trek" bore me — but a geek
nonetheless. I don't drool over
gadet stories or tales of mankind's
glorious conquest of space, and I de
mand some literary sophistication,
but still, there have been times when
I feel as if reading my favorites
books is a guilty pleasure, when I
glance around furtively to make
sure that no one sees me reading a
novel with giant spaceships and
bug-eyed aliens on its cover.
When caught, 1 usually stammer
something about how science fiction
and fantasy provide the most potent
metaphors and ideas with which to
deal with our rapidly changing, ever
more complex and absurd world.

And on some level, I do believe that speculative fiction can be a
valid, important form of literature.
It's also true that I just like really big spaceships and bug-eyed
aliens.
Sneer all you want, but in my geeky mind Philip K. Dick and
Ursula Le Guin are the most important and perceptive writers of
the 20th century, and "Rutty the Vampire Slayer" is the defining
post-millennial work of art.
Of course, ray-guns-with-literary-quality type stories are often
hard to find, especially since many of the innovative, offbeat titles
from the '50s, '60s and '70s had neither the big sales nor the crit
ical respect to remain in print. Far too often, I'd hear about some
cool book, only to find that it had been out of print for 10 years.
Thankfully, that situation has changed in recent years, with
various publishers bringing classics of speculative fiction back
from the grave. Here are four of my favorite reprints from the

past year: great reads over winter break, great gift ideas and most importantly, an op
portunity for me to gush geekily about books that I love.

"Dangerous Visions 35th Anniversary Edition " edited by Harlan Ellison, I Books
Perhaps the best embodiment of "my" science fiction is Harlan Ellison's 1967 antholo
gy "Dangerous Visions." As the title indicates, the book is a very self-conscious attempt to
rebel against the taboos and constraints on traditional S.F., and to embody the concerns
and attitudes of the so-called the "New Wave" (title pilfered from an earlier trend in
French film) movement of the late '60s.
The stories attempt to seriously explore politics, sex, drugs and other topics that had
previously been off-limits. The writing itself generally isn't that innovative, but it does
demonstrate the joy of writers finally free to fully explore and utilize the English lan
guage, rather than dumb it down or sanitize it.
"The Prowler on the City at the Edge of the World," Ellison's contribution, is a great
example of a writer practicing what he preaches. The gory, disturbing story of Jack the
Ripper unleashed in a sterile future city is a vicious condemnation on our society's love /
hate relationship with violence; it's told in a intense, stream-of-consciousness style that de
livers a sharp visceral kick.

Other highlights from an anthology that literally doesn't
have a single bad story among its 37 selections include
Samuel R. Delany's "Aye, and Gomorrah ..." a quietly
melancholy account of a few frantic nights of revelry as
neutered "spacemen" travel across the world in search of
sex and love, and Philip K. Dick's "Faith of Our Fathers," a
terrifying LSD-inspired dose of undiluted paranoia in
which everything you feared about the malevolence of the
government and the universe at large turns otu to be true.
"Nova" by Samuelß. Delany, Vintage Books
Delany, who, as a black, a bisexual and a professor of lit
erature, still remains something of an anomaly in a field
dominated by scientifically oriented, white, heterosexual
males. His finest novel, "Nova" (1968), was recently re-

stored to print by Vintage Books.
It tells the story of Lorq Von Ray and his quest to retrieve the precious substance Illyri
on from the center of an exploding star. Previous attempts have ended in disaster, and bis
current ragtag crew includes a gypsy musician named Mouse and Katin, an aspiring nov
elist who is making notes for the book that will, the reader realizes, eventually become
"Nova." Delany's novel is written in concise, evocative prose and it overflows with ideas,
from his vivid descriptions of otherwordly societies to his meditations on the nature of sto
rytelling. The book's unforgettably apocalyptic climax achieves an almost operatic intensi
ty-
"Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick " by Philip K. Dick, Pantheon Books
While "Nova's" author has, sadly, spent much of the last two decades watching his sales
dwindle and his books disappear from the shelves, the late, brilliant Philip K. Dick has ac-

tually become something of a cult figure due largely to the release of
several (mediocre) films based on his work and the publication of shiny
Vintage trade editions of many of his novels. Pantheon Books' "Select
ed Stories of Philip K. Dick" is probably an attempt to cash in on the re
cent release of Steven Spielberg's big-budget adventure "Minority Re
port" (based on a Dick short story), but it's still appreciated for bring
ing the best of Dick's short work together between two covers.
Dick was in many ways the ultimate sci-fi geek's writer, cheerful
ly throwing all sorts of absurd pulp cliches together with wild inven-

tiveness, intense paranoia and an unmatched empathy for his charac
ters. The new collection provides a glimpse at the breadth of his con
cerns and styles, from brilliantly gripping adventures ("Second Vari
ety") to dark, paranoid investigations into the nature of reality ("Faith
of Our Fathers").
"Dr. Bloodmoney" by Philip K. Dick, Vintage Books
Still, "Selected Stories" doesn't offer anything to rival Dick's best
novels. That list definitely includes the recently reprinted "Dr. Blood-

money"(l96s), a funny, harrowing, humane
masterpiece that depicts the struggles of the
survivors of a nuclear holocaust to rebuild
their lives and communities.
For all the bleakness of its story and set
ting, "Dr. Bloodmoney" also demonstrates
Dick's profound faith in humanity's ability to
persevere, an optimism that is both moving
and deeply, touchingly geeky.
Top to bottom: "Dangerous Visions 35th
Anniversary Edition," "Nova," "Dr. Blood
money," and "Selected Stories of Philip K.
Dick."






Merry Geeksmas, assclowns. Ha! Ha!
