# Posey remains talented and obscure

### JESSICA JOFFE 
Parker Posey bites her finger nails. She's spend
ing the day at yet another posh chain hotel an
swering— in 45 minute segments — the same
questions she's no doubt been asked at least a hun
dred times before. "So what's it like being the
Queen oflndie," the unsavory journalist fellow to
my right barks before he's even sat down. Posey,
folded up in her armchair, turns and smiling po
litely, coos, "Aren't we all adults here? Are you re
ally asking me what it feels like to be an 'indie
queen'? Give me a break ..." He tries hopelessly
to redeem himself. "Well, y'know, one article tags
you with the label," Posey interrupts. "And you
don't get hired ..

Posey has been in
more than 40 films and
one soap opera since
she graduated from
the acting conservato
ry at Purchase, NY in
the early '90s. It just so
happens that most of
these films debuted at
Sundance (or similar
strongholds of inde
pendent film-making),
and somewhere along
the way, some journal-

ist had the brilliant idea of dubbing her "the
Queen of Indie." Years later, the title has stuck, a
little too well for her taste. She's thinking about
taking Stephen Soderbergh's advice and demand
that the press ask only questions she'd like to re
spond to.
Parker Posey is good. She's been called a latter
day Katherine Hepburn and may be one of the
best actresses of her generation. She's beautiful,
wry and adequately aloof. But in a world where
you are what you've been typecast as, it's been a
trial getting the big Hollywood boys to notice her
and put her in a movie that will do her talent jus
tice and fill up her bank account in the process.
Posey admits that there has not been a little self
sabotage involved in the process. She just can't
help seeing the humor in things. In an audition
for the film "Speed," she was asked to mime a bus
sequence. She picked up a paper plate and, using
it as a steering wheel, swerved animatedly around
the audition room. Needless to say, they weren't
impressed. And yet, she'd quite fancy making a
big, dumb Hollywood movie: "Totally," she says.
"They'll pay me money. I'll get some freedom. I'll
have some Hollywcxxi buuuzz," she drawls.
Even though she's lived in the same East

Village flat since graduating from uni
versity, her Mississippi roots still poke
through occasionally.

"You see," she continues,
"Movies aren't made like they
used to be. Even in the '80s there
was still more risk involved.
Nowadays, if you get enough ex
posure, and if your film makes
lots of money, you'll get whichev
er part you want. The notion off
just working on the projects yauj
believe in is a fallacy. It's aMi
about numbers. And even
though I've made a lot
films, my numbers are p
still pretty low." *

While 1 understand her frustration, I wonder
what Posey is really complaining about. She claims
that she sits around waiting for the phone to ring,
but she's worked consistently with some of the
most remarkable directors around. Christopher
Guest, who immortalized her as the "Teacher's
Pet" singing dairy queen in his film, "Waidng for
Guffman," and then again as the train-tracked
Meg in "Best in Show," casts her in yet another
starring role in his upcoming film, "A Mighty
Wind."
Working with Guest is a rare pleasure, Posey
admits, and her involvement goes beyond what
most actors might consider standard. "After the
first day of sh(X)ting '[Waiung for] Guffman,' I

curled up in a ball on
the floor of my trailer
because my back was
aching so much. I had
no idea what it could be
until Eugene [Levy]
told me it was from
holding in all my laugh
ter. There were defi
nitely moments when I
thought, 'What kind of
a crazy ride is this?'"
More crazy rides en
sued when she had
braces applied for her

role as Meg. "I totally regressed back to being a
teenager. I giggled, I blushed, I got embarrassed.
I even had some rocker dude kiss me in a bar, who
totally thought he was getting with some fourteen
year old girl." For"A Mighty Wind," Guest con
vinced her to master the mandolin.
Cult director Hal Hartley, also an alumnus of
Purchase, put her in three of his films, as did Nora
Ephron and Richard Linklater, whose 1993 gem
"Dazed and Confused" had every teenage boy se
cretly wishing they could, when her "senior" bitch
shouted, "Lick me, all of you!" The power of
choice that a successful Hollywood role might
convey is alluring, but when you've had the
chance to work with creative forces like these, it
seems that Posey's decision never to do the "big
crocodile movie" required of every young starlet
wasn't such a big mistake after all.
But Posey is here to talk about her newest film
"Personal Velocity," directed by renaissance
woman (and daughter of Arthur Miller) Rebec
ca Miller, arriving in our parochial cinemas on
Dec. 6. It is a beautiful, terse film — shot entire
ly on D V — that tells the stories of three women
at a crossroads in their lives and forced to
make important decisions and re-

arrange their priorities. Beware to
those who tiiink this sounds like

the tried and tested
premise ofanoth-

er "moving" chick-flick, because it's not.
The characters are sparsely written, and
yet more accurate and complex than we
have grown to accept over the years.
And Posey's attachment to this film is
more literal than one might imagine.
" 'Personal Velocity,' whose budget
was well under a million dollars, wasn't
made like any of these other independent
films," she explains. "We all invested
three hill weeks of work into this, and now
each one of us owns a part of the film. The
production company Indigent Films,
headed by Garry Winnick, (director of
this summer's " Tadpole") is based on a
principle of dividing the points for their
films' profit equally among cast and crew,
which helps costs stay low, but keeps the
whole thing really fair. This way everyone
has a personal investment in it."
Like Hollywood movies, independent
films are no longer being made in the
same way they were during the early
'90s. When the studios finally cottoned to

the pool of fresh talent running rampant
in small towns known previously only for
their skiing facilities, they plucked the
unsuspecting writers and directors from
oblivion, promising them immediate
success. Parker describes the process this
way, "They'd get the script and say,
'Great! We want John Cusack and Meg
Ryan to look at it.' three months go by,
and they haven't looked at it. 'So, we'll go
with Sandra Bullock and Ed Norton,'
they say and another three months go by.
By the time they're thinking Reese With
erspoon and Drew Barrymore, they've
decided they're going to shoot the film in
Miami instead of France, even though
die story is set in Paris... and then the
whole thing's gone to shit..."
Reflecting on her career, Posey says,
almost to herself, "You know what? I've
actually been really, really lucky. I've
had the opportunity to work with some
really amazing people, and I wouldn't
want to change that for anything.''
