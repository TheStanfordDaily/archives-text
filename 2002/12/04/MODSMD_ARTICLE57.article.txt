# Jonze and Kaufman deliver sublimely messed-up film, cookies
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
I walked into the screening of "Adaptation," the latest film
from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze
(the team behind "Being John Malkovich"), thinking that I
J knew what to expect. After all, I d seen the trailer, so 1 knew that
H the movie fell into the honorable tradition of art about the
Partist's dilemma — in other words, books about writers who
pMve writer's block, films about filmmakers who can't make
films, etc.
I already knew that "Adaptation" told the story of twin
brothers Charlie and Donald Kaufman (both played by
Nicholas Cage). Charlie is insecure and neurotic despite the
recent success of "Being John Malkovich," while his unem
ployed brother Donald remains reckless and carefree.
Lfchariie lands the plum assignment of adapting "The
Orchid Thief," an acclaimed piece of book-

fcngth journalism by Susan Orlean (Meryl
Streep), but soon finds himself paralyzed
by his reverence for Orlean's writing.
With deadlines rushing past and ideas in
short supply, he decides to write himself
into his script, and it becomes clear that
his screenplay is quickly becoming the
screenplay for "Adaptation."
So I approached the film as a meta-autobiog-

raphy in the tradition of "8 1/2." And I suppose that
my description might still hold true on some level,
but I should have known better than to expect any
thing that predictable from the writer and director
behind a film as strange and original as "Being John
Malkovich."
To begin with, there is no Donald Kaufman.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg as far as differ
ences between reality and a film that spirals increas
ingly into the weird and unbelievable. Kaufman (by
whom I mean Charlie) and Jonze perform a master
ful mindfuck, pulling the rug out from under any
easy interpretation. At the most, I'll venture to guess
that "Adaptation" isn't just about the writer's dilem
ma, but also the inevitable shortcomings of any
adaptation, be it from life to art, or from one medi
um to another.
It was in this state of confusion that I joined
several other college reporters in San Francisco for
an interview with Kaufman and Jonze. I still hadn't
figured out what I had seen; all I knew was that I
wanted to see the hilarious and unexpectedly mov
ing film — which features two brave performances
from Nicholas Cage — again.
In person, the outgoing and talkative Kauf
man bore little resemblance to the fat, balding neu
rotic of the film. Jonze was actually the quieter of the
pair. His extreme politeness (and oddball sense of
humor) led him to begin the interview by asking us,
"Do you need anything to eat or drink?" and to con
clude by wrapping the cookies offered by the hotel
into napkins and giving them to us. The two, who
first became friends after Jonze read the screenplay
for "Malkovich," quickly illustrated Jonze's claim
that they "share a similar sensibility," answering
questions with the same mix of thought and dead
pan sarcasm and often asking each other, "What do
you think?"
Despite the two men's friendliness, no simple
interpretations were forthcoming.
"There's a couple of things that we don't
want to try and explain," Jonze said. "We don't
want to explain where the line between what's real
in the movie and what's not real in the movie [falls].
And then also, we don't want to try and explain
what the movie means, because hopefully it means
more than one thing ... and different things to
different people."
Nonetheless, they did acknowledge that the
film's initial premise mirrored real life — Kaufman
was hired to adapt "The Orchid Thief' and wrote

himself into the screenplay as a way to deal with the impossibili
ty of adapting Orlean's book.
"There's definitely me in [the film's depiction of Charlie
Kaufman]," Kaufman said. "I borrowed from myself liberally.
It's not all me, a lot of it is more of an idea of me, or a depiction
of a particular aspect of me. The situation that he's in is the sit-

uation I was in and I was re
acting to it somewhat simi
larly."
When he decided to put
himself, or some version of
himself, into the screenplay,
Kaufman knew that he was
entering territory that had
been covered by filmmakers
before, but he said that he
was eager to add his own
take on the subject.
When I first raised the
question of how the film
makers approached a topic
that could quickly descend
into indulgent cliche, Jonze
said, "That's why I like Char
lie, the cliches."
"[I write the cliches] in a
complicated way, though, so
people don't recognize
they're cliches until much,
much later," Kaufman of
fered. "I think the truth is, I
was having this problem and
it seemed to me an interest
ing direction and I hopefully
wasn't going to leave it at
that, you know? I don't think
anything, any topic can be
cliched. It's what you do with
it or don't do with it. 1 was
hopefully trying to take it

into some other realm, have it be about something else in addi
tion to that."
Jonze added, "I guess one of the things that we realized was
that it wasn't as much about the writing process as it was about
the thought process — not that it's not about the writing
process, but we tried to make specifically those scenes [depicting
Kaufman struggling to write] be more about the way your brain
works, in the creative process as well as just in life."

Jonze noted that while this approach to the topic was already
present in the screenplay, it became fleshed out during the film
ing and editing process. Editing actually stretched out over 13
months, with Kaufman and Jonze constantly revising the story
and voiceover narration.
"Because the story is told in this very modular way [shifting be-

tween Kaufman's struggle to write
his screenplay, Orlean's struggle to
write her book, and Kaufman's actu
al adaptation of'The Orchid Thief],
we knew that we would have the op
portunity to move things around as
much as we wanted to," Kaufman
said. "Which made the possibility of
an eternal editing process likely."
Jonze said that the long editing
process, which he compared to writ
ing several drafts of a novel, was
caused in part by the difficulty of an
additional adaptation, the adapta
tion of Kaufman's complex screen
play into an accessible film.
"Hie script was this incredible ex
perience to read because of how
dense it was and how it intertwined
all these different ideas and charac
ters," he said. "But you could stop
and think about it and you could
have an eight-page scene that could
really be impactful, because you
could read it and then think about,
'Well, why is this here?' and then flip
back and read it like a book. And so
we knew that [the film] was a separate
thing that was going to evolve a lot as
we brought it to the next place."
Jonze also noted that during this
process, "Adaptation" became au
tobiographical not just for its writer,
but for its director as well.

"Much more than in the last movie, I felt like I became the
main character, lost and consumed and anxious," he said,
"fl'here were a] number of times during the process I was ut
terly convinced that it was a failure and that it wasn't working
and [I felt] that sort of depression of all your energy going into
something, every waking moment going into something that
you didn't think was working... but then, the next day, [I would
think,] This is great! It's amazing!' "
