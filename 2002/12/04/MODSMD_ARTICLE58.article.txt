# S. F. Opera's production of 'Alcina': too hot to handle
## 
### HART GILULA 
San Francisco Opera has been a flaming hotbed of con
troversy this year, and its new production of Handel's "Al
cina" is no exception. This brazenly sexual, postmodern
production has only further stoked the coals of partisan
passion amongst audiences:

I 0 ~
Most either love it 01
loathe it. As far as "Al
cina" goes, I unfortu-1
nately feel some
where in the middle.

CI ★★★★☆

I hough it begins very
promisingly, the production later overwhelms the opera.
"Alcina" is one of Handel's "magic" operas which, as is
often the case with Handel operas, has an absurdly com
plex plot rife with inconsistencies. Based on passages from
Ludovico Ariosto's sexy "Orlando Furioso," the opera fo
cuses on the eponymous title character, a witch who has
lost her power because she's fallen deeply in love with a
human named Ruggiero. (Previously, Alcina had simply
turned her discarded lovers into animals.)
Like many European concept productions, this one os
cillates between the brilliant and the banal. Oftentimes you
find yourself caught up in the beauty of an image, only to
have it disrupted by someone carelessly tossing set pieces
or drawing a gun.
Anna Viebrock designed a set characterized by the jux
taposition of beauty and ugliness, of magnificence and
decay. It is supposed to reflect the disrepair of Alcina's
kingdom. A decaying room is dominated by a huge frame
which functions as a subjective, psychological mirror,
while action takes place "inside" of it.
Much of the concept functions quite well. The licen
tious nature of Jossi Wieler's direction appropriately ac
centuates the sexuality intrinsic in the score. Alcina almost
always dons a see-through dress. However, oftentimes you
find yourself so caught up in analyzing the production on
a cerebral level that it loses its musical power. The music,

the drama and the concept often compete for the attention
of the audience, sometimes at the expense of operatic bal
ance.
Fortunately for us, though, any inconsistencies in the
production are more than made up for by a lineup of for
midably talented singers. Catherine Naglestad makes her
S.F. Opera debut as Alcina, and it comes as no surprise that
General Director Pamela Rosenberg has touted this singer
as the real deal.
Naglestad's voice is sumptuous yet multifacted; she
possesses a full palette of tonal color that she makes full use

of in Alcina's six virtuosic
arias. She achieves a bril
liant squillo in the upper
reaches of her range
without producing an af
fected, covered tone.
Her complete inhabi
tance of this role is no
small feat; a couple of Al
cina's tour-de-force arias
run over eight minutes
long. Her second act
aria, "Ah! Mio Cor!"
runs over 12 minutes,
and Naglestad was there
for every voluptuous
second of it.
Naglestad isn't the
only vocal force in this
production. Nearly
everyone in the cast
makes a mark in this em
barrassment of vocal
riches. Most notable are
Alice Coote as a suitably
enraptured Ruggerio
and Helene Schneider
man as a fantastically

acted Bradamante. Schneiderman's performance reveals
her character's affliction without succumbing to a mawk
ish portrayal.
Conductor Roy Goodman, who usually works with pe
riod instrument orchestras, brought an ebullient energy
to the pit. The San Francisco Opera Orchestra sounded as
crisp as a modern instrument orchestra can sound in this
gloriously baroque repertoire.
Time is one performance left in the mn on Saturday, Dec. 7 at
8:00 p.m. in San Francisco.


Shocking, decadent, gender-bending: Opera like your mama never saw.
