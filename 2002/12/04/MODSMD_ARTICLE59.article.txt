# Cirque du Soleil’s ‘Varekai’ astonishing and very French

### TIFFANY LEE 
From the moment you enter the blue and gold tent i
you realize that this isn't just any circus. Golden bam- fj
boo shoots fill the back part of the stage, and a dis- Iv
turbingly windy sound fills the tent, a bit too reminis-
cent of the opening performance a few weeks ago

where extreme wind and rain prevented the show from happening at all. But once the
music starts and the characters come on stage, all fear is quickly replaced by awe and
amazement. If you have seen any Cirque du Soleil shows in the past, "Varekai" may not

impress you as much as if it were your first
time, but overall it is a solidly created produc
tion full of amazing human acrobatics and
hauntingly beautiful music.
Set in the bowels of a forest, the opening
scene is filled with strangely costumed per
formers dressed in bright colors and covered
with an assortment of spikes, eyes and fluff.
They crawl, ooze and bop onto the stage, tan
talizing your senses and completely absorbing
your attention. Suddenly a man dressed all in
white with feathery white wings falls graceful
ly from the tent roof. It is Icarus, a Greek fig
ure whose overzealousness takes him too close
to the sun and consequently to his death.
"Varekai," however, does not celebrate this
fall but his rebirth.
There were several amazing acrobatic acts
throughout this production, but I found that
although many of the aerial acts were incredi
bly difficult, they were still relatively trite.

There was one act, however, that stood above the rest called "The Fires of the Volcano."
The last big number in the production, it involved two seesaw swings and acrobats
dressed in volcanic red. They were launched from the seesaw swings and flipped, spun
and turned through the air, landing on the hands of other acrobats.
I also really enjoyed "The Masters of the Volcano," composed of dancing and floor ac
robatics. One of the acrobats actually walked on the backs of his toes — not the tips, but

the backs! They did a variety of
Russian-looking dance moves,
spinning at remarkable speeds
an uncountable number of times.
Not only did "Varekai" have the
acrobatics that Cirque du Soleil
productions are known for, but
also a sense of grace in dance.
But what may have been my
favorite act of the whole show
was performed by The Icarian
Brothers, who took barrel
rolling to the next level. The
basic idea behind barrel rolling
is that a guy lies on his back
while using his feet to roll, flip
and do tricks with a huge barrel.
What made this particular act so
special was the fact that instead
of a barrel, the barrel rollers did
tricks with other human being.
The human barrel did flips,
turns and landed on his feet.
The speed at which these "bar
rels" were spinning, the num
ber of revolutions they made
and the fact that they were still
capable of landing feet up after
spinning an insane number of
times made this by far my fa-

vorite performance.
Overall, "Varekai" was a great production. If you have never seen a Cirque du Soleil
show, or even ifyou have, I would encourage you to catch "Varekai" — you'll have a truly
magical experience.
Varekai is playing in San Francisco through Dec. 29 and in San Jose from Jan. 16 to Feb. 9. Check
