# Overseas Seminars expand
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a recently announced ros
ter of 10 locations for 2003, the
Overseas Studies Program is ex
panding its offerings of Overseas
Seminars to span four continents
with new programs in Asia, Eu
rope, North America and, for the
first time, Africa.
The seminar programs, of
fered for the first time to students
this past September, are essential
ly short, intensely focused classes
of 12 students working closely
with one or two faculty members
to explore a topic. For September
2002, five three-week long, two
unit seminars were offered in
China, Korea, Belgium and Rus
sia. The locations list has been ex
panded and altered this year to in
clude Oxford, South Africa, Mexi
co, Northern India, the Alps and a
class that will spend time in both
Kyoto and Tokyo, as well as the
previous classes in Belgium,

Korea and China. No seminar will
be offered in Moscow.
Another change is that the cost
of the seminars lias risen from
$500 to $600, not including air
fare. Students can apply for finan
cial aid.
The topics vary widely, from a
workshop on Shakespeare at Ox
ford to a study of the European
Union in Belgium and an archae
ological dig in the Alps.
"[The seminars provide] expo
sure to and involvement in learn
ing on-site that cannot be achieved
here on campus, but does not re
quire an entire quarter or more
abroad," said Amos Nur, academ
ic director of the OSP.
I-ast spring, the OSP solicited
proposals from faculty for seminar
topics, which were submitted in
October of this year. Then, a re
view hoard selected the current of
ferings from the proposed topics.
In particular, the East Asian semi
nars arose from a collaboration
with the East Asian Studies De
partment, while India, South
Africa and Mexico were chosen as
exploratory locations — in part to
determine whether a full center
with quarter-long programs
should be established in those
countries.
Last year's programs were ex
tremely successful, providing part
of the motivation to expand next
fall's offerings.
"The rating of all seminars last
year was uniformly and without
exceptions very high," Nur said.
The timing of the seminars also
makes studying overseas more
practical for many students.

"For science and engineering
majors, it is a challenge for them
to take an entire quarter to go
overseas, so although we didn't
design courses specifically for
them, we certainly hope this cre
ates an opportunity for students
who couldn't take [an entire]
quarter [abroad]," said Irene
Kennedy, associate director of
the OSP.
While the topics vary widely,
there are none that reflect a strong
technical or scientific basis.
"No science seminars were pro
posed," Nur said. "We may be
more proactive next year and try
to solicit a couple ol science-orient
ed seminars.
Student reaction to the semi
nars was generally positive.
"I think it is important for
everyone to learn about the world
outside the 'Stanford Bubble' and
gain experience with other cul
tures," said freshman Maneesh
Singh.
Freshman Nancy Gong sug
gested a few changes for the pro
gram, though.
"The topics seem pretty nar
row," she continued. "They
could improve it if they let stu
dents pick the location but sug
gest specific topics. For instance,
for the workshop on Shake
speare it might be better if the
students could pick the play
wright to be studied."
However, she remained enthu
siastic about the program.
"I think it'd be great because
you can immerse yourself into
something you're passionate
about," she said.
Kennedy echoed the positive
sentiment.
"[The overseas seminars are] a
win-win for us, the students and
the faculty," she said.
