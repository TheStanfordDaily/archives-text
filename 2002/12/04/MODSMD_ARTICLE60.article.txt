# George Harrison's final work
## 'Brainwashed' just wonderful 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
As George Harrison began work on his
final album, "Brainwashed," he knew he
might not be around to finish it. Wanting to
know the project would be in good hands if he
were to pass on, Harrison enlisted both his old
friend and Traveling Wilburies bandmate Jeff
Lynne, as well as his son Dhani Harrison, to
co-produce the album with him. With their

help, the record Harrison created
the subtle final masterpiece of a true
master, possibly the best work of i
his solo career. H
Harrison did indeed pass away *
before "Brainwashed" was fully com-

pleted. All of the songs had been record
ed in some form, but work was still left to be
done, mainly with arrangements. Both Lynne
and Dhani Harrison are to be commended for
their jobs in fleshing these songs out into the
more lush versions we now hear on the album.
But the lion's share of the credit for this
beautiful piece of work has to go to Ceorge
himself. Harrison's singing, guitar playing and
songwriting are all magical in their subtlety
and maturity. None of the songs confront
death directly, but "Brainwashed" is clearly the
work of a man who knew he was dying soon,
and wasn't necessarily afraid of it. Instead he

had some questions, which he explores in this
material with depth, easy going humor, seri
ousness, melancholy and joy. A number of the
songs on "Brainwashed" follow this theme of
searching and discovery: In "Pisces Fish" he
says, "I'm a Pisces Fish and the river runs
through my soul/ And I'll be swimming until I
can find those waters." He cheerfully remarks
in "Any Road" that, "If you don't know where

you're going / Any
road will take you
there." His slide gui
tar on the instru
mental "Marwa
Blues" is melancholic
and stunningly beau-

tiful ; n its simplicity. Breathtaking might be
the correct word — this album brought tears
to my eyes more than once.
I'm not sure if "Brainwashed" would have
moved me quite so much if I didn't know that
it was the last work George Harrison would
ever give us. But that doesn't really matter to
me, because art doesn't exist in a vacuum —
the truth is, "Brainwashed" is the last work of
Harrison's illustrious and important career,
and it is all the more wonderful that he left us
with something this full of integrity and beau
ty. This album is a treasure.
