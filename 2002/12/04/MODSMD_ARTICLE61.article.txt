# Pearl Jam drops another tired batch of crap songs
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
Pearl Jam was arguably the
biggest rock band of the '90s. The
so-called "alternative revolution"
the band helped to propel wiped
much of the then-tired '80s music
off the charts and airwaves. But
there seems to be little room on
the charts and airwaves for many
"alternative" artists today. The al
ternative revolution came with a
bang and then faded away even
more quickly than the British in
vasion before it.
Of course, part of this is be
cause these bands started putting
out tired music themselves. Many
of the biggest and greatest artists
of the late '80s and early '90s are
still surviving. These include
R.E.M., U2, Nine Inch Nails and
Sting, all of whom recently put
out albums that are a strange
combination of experimentalism
and derivativeness, both in words
and music. This satisfies neither
those listeners who want more of
the same sound nor those who
want progress. After all, an elec
tronic flourish here and an East
ern riff there do not make great
music.
More evidence for this is pro
vided by Pearl Jam's latest outing,
"Riot Act." As with most previous
Pearl Jam albums, it is a little
worse than the one that precedes
it. It is not a bad album by any

means; it makes quite sufficient
background music. These guys
are, after all, professionals. How
ever, it lacks not only a "single,"
but also a single original thought.
I felt that 1 had heard all these

Riot Act

songs before, some by Pearl Jam,
some by others, but always in bet
ter versions.
I wonder how much the mem
bers of Pearl Jam are aware of
their descent into self-parody.
Then again, it's hard to miss when
one of the better songs on the
album has the title "Love Boat
Captain" and the refrain "I know
it's already been sung/ But it can't
be said enough / All you need is
love." And the unfocused, redun
dant and pointless anti-Bush rant
"Bushleager" is quite ill advised,
albeit strangely memorable. It's
hard to know what the band
members were thinking by
putting the semi-elliptical spoken
words on the album, "Swinging
for the fence / Got lucky with a
strike / Drilling for fear / Makes
the job simple." Not very illumi
nating with respect to interna
tional politics.
Even this "song," however, has
its stronger points, making me

think that perhaps the band could
have salvaged a small part of it in
an effort to make something bet
ter. In fact, many of these songs
might be tolerated were they
weaker tracks on an album from a
new band. The problem is that
these are the stronger songs from
a band that should know better.
Of course, when previously
creativity was in abundance, it's
likely difficult to realize one has

lost one's touch. Pearl Jam mem
bers likely think their meager
sales are due to the changing
tastes of the music-listening pub
lic. Although this is part of it, it's
not just other people's tastes that
have changed, but also the band's
own talent, at least if "Riot Act" is
the best indicator of said talent.
The lyrics are weak. The in
strumentation is passionless. And
the Eddie Vedder murmur has

descended into Dylan-esque sell
parody. Of course, Dylan had his
low periods, too. Maybe, like
Dylan, we'd best wait for the best
of album for the better of these
tracks and hope that the next
album is Pearl Jam's "Blood on
the Tracks." For now, though,
someone ought to read Pearl Jam
the riot act — if the band expects
to remain relevant, the quality of
its albums has got to improve.
