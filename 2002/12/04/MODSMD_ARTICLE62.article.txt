Face it: Rock 'n' roll is well-brewed pla
giarism served in plastic beer cups. Once
you accept that, you realize that everything
you've heard — every piece of "art" — is
just a jarring impulse in that perpetual

swagger toward the big urinal in the
sky. Following in that great historical i
tradition, Audioslave — a collabora- |j
tion between ex-Rage Against The i
Machine (RATM) members and

Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cor
nell — is a bountifully derivative record
that is fabulously pissed-off and pissed-on
at the same time.
Pissed-on because there isn't anything
ostensibly new or earth-shattering in the
sound; pissed-off because that's all these
folks have ever known. Friends, I invite
you back to the summer of 1994: RATM
are mighty mainstream anarchists, and
Soundgarden is on its way to becoming an
other grunge granddaddy. Both bands re
lease their respective seminal albums, funk
out and break up.
Now, this super-combo revisits the
funkiness that made both bands special in
the first place; it also does away with the
smarting intelligence of RATM, instead
perpetrating a big middle-finger response
to the sludge-rock of Creed, Staind and
Limp Bizkit. The song structures are
patently Soundgarden circa "Superunk

makes you
forget that

Cornell is mouthing adolescent plati
tudes like "1 saw him in the mirror ... and
when he turned away I shot him in the head
/Then I came to realize I had killed myself."
It almost makes you feel... angry!
After I sifted through the album half-a
dozen times, the battered "What You Are"
emerges as my favorite song — its ballad
beginning is blown away by Morello's fine
ly manicured guitar fury, and Cornell en
gages in a high-pitched battle with the
RATM sensibilities.
In fact, this battle of sensibilities is what
lends the album its energy, and that per
ilous swing of the grunge-funk seesaw is ex
actly what the listener desires. This energy
saves songs like the opening "Chochise"
and the mono-chordal thrasher "Like A
Stone"; in comparison, the greasy '90s alt
rock ballad "I Am The Highway" feels in
sipid and forced. There are also some true
gems here — in particular, the techno

rock of "Hypnotize." Be sure to beg for
more of that, and while you're at it, praise
them for making this collaboration work.
They're the closest we've gotten to Led
Zeppelin in a while.
But don't ignore the really low points ei
ther. Don't forgive the monotony and the
forced angst. Don't let this album sell 10
million copies. Lament the lyrics, the
noose-tightening verse structures and the
predictable vocal delivery. Push Morello
against his Berlin-esque wall of sound and
ask him why the hell he's trying to pump

you with the same goddamn riffs. Tell the
waiter it's too well (lone.
Talk to your Rock 101 professor about
it. About how it's a fundamental paradox
that we criticize plagiarists but we can for
give Audioslave because they're ripping off
the selves they once were, about how it's ac
tually healthy to consume recycled rebel
lion. Sure, if your professor has a mullet,
and you can live with it: Go ahead, love Au
dioslave.
Otherwise, stop reading this article right
now, and go to the toilet to relieve yourself .
