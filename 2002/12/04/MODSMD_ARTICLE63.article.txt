# She gave up her nipples for fame
## Aguilera's latest shows great potential, thong 
### CHRIS LEE 
There's something more than a little sad about the
state of pop music these days. In this culture of public
ity pixies who run press circuits and stand on million
dollar marketing campaigns, it's easy to be repulsed by
how overproduced

these acts seem.
They're as slick andy
immaterial as the (
plastic shrink-wrap \
that every new CD

® Stripped
Christina Aguilera

comes in. Teen pop in
particular has been the whipping boy in recent years,
the symbol of everything that's evil in the music indus
try, and it's the stars of the Britney generation that have
found themselves struggling to make the leap from pop
pandering to genuine artistry.
The irony is that for the modern pop star, "artistic
control" on an album means little more than choosing
who you want to produce your next track. Who's hot
now? Alicia Keys? Get her on the phone. Can Glen
Ballard produce a hit for me? Great! And for added
street cred, let's feature guest rappers on a few cuts —
Li'l Kim and Redman sound good. Throw in some sec
ond-rate poetry for lyrics ("it's very personal"), and
you've got "Stripped," the new album from Christina
Aguilera: just another artist desperate to prove her in
dependence and distance herself from the pop pack
aging that made her famous.
Except that this artist actually has potential. Much
has been made of Aguilera's transformation from
"Genie in a Bottle" ingenue to "Dirrty" body-piercing
ho, and hopefully someday she'll realize that her new
makeover is doing a world of hurt to her artistic aspira
tions. Why anyone with such talent would feel the need
to sell her image as a whore is inexplicable. Take a clos
er listen to "Stripped" and you'll see what I mean. Sure,

there are the rebellious, blatantly
raw tracks "Stripped" wants to mar
ket — don't expect any song with

the title "Get Mine, Get Yours" to
be too subtle — but there are also
quite a diverse range of materi-

al, from Latin rhythms ("In
fatuation") to seventies funk

("Underappreciated") to
even your standard
Mariah ballads ("The
ir_' • >»\

Voice Within ).
The album is all over
the place, a sonic sam
pler of all the different

paths Aguilera might take >
with her career. This is
both a flaw and the album's

saving grace — the various
styles make the album seem dis
jointed, but it's this very diversity
_ll 4 1 *. I

that allows us to see what she s real
ly capable of. Eventually, Aguilera
will have to pick one of these styles

and run with it.
Personally, I vote for the songbird

diva that shows up in graceful num
bers like Linda Perry's "Beautiful."
It's in tracks like this and Ballard's

"The Voice Within" that Christi
na finally relaxes, stops

fronting and allows her voice,
the real star of the show, to
shine. More importantly,

these songs convey class
— not at all what you'd

expect from the naked
girl that was recently

curled up on the cover of Rolling Stone.
It's all right if she can't write her own
songs; listen to those lithe pipes floor

you with their sheer range and power,
and all doubts are dispelled.
"Stripped" clocks in at over an hour

and 15 minutes, but much of it feels
like filler. The "girl power" tracks,
like "Fighter" and Li'l Kim's

"Can't Hold Us Down" sound
tired and uninspired, while

forays into personal history
("I'm OK") may be revealing
but just aren't musically inter-

esting. Even the guest song
writing of Alicia Keys sounds
like a cheap rip-off of her own

"Falling," and the debut
single, "Dirrty," is a stri
j i 11 : „r

dent, hollering mess of
a song that should
t be buried immedi
ately.

However,
strip away all the sex, and

you'll find the real mes
sage hidden in the innova
tive grooves and soft ballads

at the album's center: Christina
Aguilera has a Voice, one of the few
that actually deserves to be heard in
pop music nowadays. Given the
right musical focus and a more so
phisticated profile, she might go
places. The only question is
whether she'll save her career be
fore she pierces herself into
oblivion.

® Stripped
Christina Aguilera

comes in. Teen pop in
particular has been the whipping boy in recent years,
the symbol of everything that's evil in the music indus
try, and it's the stars of the Britney generation that have
found themselves struggling to make the leap from pop
pandering to genuine artistry.
The irony is that for the modern pop star, "artistic
control" on an album means little more than choosing
who you want to produce your next track. Who's hot
now? Alicia Keys? Get her on the phone. Can Glen
Ballard produce a hit for me? Great! And for added
street cred, let's feature guest rappers on a few cuts —
Li'l Kim and Redman sound good. Throw in some sec
ond-rate poetry for lyrics ("it's very personal"), and
you've got "Stripped," the new album from Christina
Aguilera: just another artist desperate to prove her in
dependence and distance herself from the pop pack
aging that made her famous.
Except that this artist actually has potential. Much
has been made of Aguilera's transformation from
"Genie in a Bottle" ingenue to "Dirrty" body-piercing
ho, and hopefully someday she'll realize that her new
makeover is doing a world of hurt to her artistic aspira
tions. Why anyone with such talent would feel the need
to sell her image as a whore is inexplicable. Take a clos
er listen to "Stripped" and you'll see what I mean. Sure,

there are the rebellious, blatantly
raw tracks "Stripped" wants to mar
ket — don't expect any song with

the title "Get Mine, Get Yours" to
be too subtle — but there are also
quite a diverse range of materi-

al, from Latin rhythms ("In
fatuation") to seventies funk

("Underappreciated") to
even your standard
Mariah ballads ("The
ir_' • >»\

Voice Within ).
The album is all over
the place, a sonic sam
pler of all the different

paths Aguilera might take >
with her career. This is
both a flaw and the album's

saving grace — the various
styles make the album seem dis
jointed, but it's this very diversity
_ll 4 1 *. I

that allows us to see what she s real
ly capable of. Eventually, Aguilera
will have to pick one of these styles

and run with it.
Personally, I vote for the songbird

diva that shows up in graceful num
bers like Linda Perry's "Beautiful."
It's in tracks like this and Ballard's

"The Voice Within" that Christi
na finally relaxes, stops

fronting and allows her voice,
the real star of the show, to
shine. More importantly,

these songs convey class
— not at all what you'd

expect from the naked
girl that was recently

curled up on the cover of Rolling Stone.
It's all right if she can't write her own
songs; listen to those lithe pipes floor

you with their sheer range and power,
and all doubts are dispelled.
"Stripped" clocks in at over an hour

and 15 minutes, but much of it feels
like filler. The "girl power" tracks,
like "Fighter" and Li'l Kim's

"Can't Hold Us Down" sound
tired and uninspired, while

forays into personal history
("I'm OK") may be revealing
but just aren't musically inter-

esting. Even the guest song
writing of Alicia Keys sounds
like a cheap rip-off of her own

"Falling," and the debut
single, "Dirrty," is a stri
j i 11 : „r

dent, hollering mess of
a song that should
t be buried immedi
ately.

However,
strip away all the sex, and

you'll find the real mes
sage hidden in the innova
tive grooves and soft ballads

at the album's center: Christina
Aguilera has a Voice, one of the few
that actually deserves to be heard in
pop music nowadays. Given the
right musical focus and a more so
phisticated profile, she might go
places. The only question is
whether she'll save her career be
fore she pierces herself into
oblivion.
