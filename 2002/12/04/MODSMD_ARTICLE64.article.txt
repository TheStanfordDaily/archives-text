# Caught with your Pants Down? Roxy tells you how to cope
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
It's embarrassing, it's mortifying, and, unless you
happen to be one of the lucky bastards with a single,
it's inevitable. There you are, on the verge of consum
mating your love / like / mutual horniness in the pri
vacy of your one-room triple, a writhing mass of tan
gled limbs, sweaty, hot and, suddenly, interrupted.
You are given a split-second to respond. A split-sec

ond to pretend his face wasn't buried in your crotch,
maybe to continue as if you hadn't see your intruder
enter at all, or to emit primitive, guttural noises while
fumbling spastically for the covers. The question isn't
what method is best, but what method is best for you
and will minimize (if not altogether eliminate) any po
tential awkwardness.
My roommate from freshman year favored the T-
Rex approach. This involves halting all activity, which
includes breathing, upon intrusion with the secure
knowledge that T-Rex's have notoriously poor eye
sight and can detect only movement. Unfortunately
for her, she was a dumbass who failed Anthro 3, and
this particular piece of paleo-ontological knowledge
wasn't really relevant in my case. I tried to be a good
sport however, and would occasionally rampage
through the dining hall, roaring with animalistic rage
and gnawing on the limbs of certain food service work
ers (you know who you are) so she wouldn't feel bad.
Although this worked for us, I realize that most room
mate relationships aren't as dysfunctional, so I'll move
on to some alternate methods of saving face.
Trying to maintain the professionalism and objectiv
ity I am so admired for, I took to the masses in search
of answers. After intensive field research (a.k.a. asking
the one person I happened to bump into while writing
this) I concluded that the sources of so many of our
problems are also, ironically, the chosen solutions to
them. Namely, DENIAL REPRESSION. And, yes,

EMAIL.
Caught in the act? Just whip out that IR course read
er and highlight away, ignoring the fact that you're
pitching a tent large enough to accommodate 50 law
school alums. Do the deed on your hum bio notes,
knowing that you are prepared at moment's notice to
recite the chemical properties of lactase, thereby free
ing you from the condemnation of your nosy hallmates.
Better yet, stay hilly clothed and take off just enough
to get the thing into the hole. After all, that's basically all
sex is, right? That way, when interrupted you can leap
to your computer and check your email (Sophomore
Formal?! Awwww yeah!) in one graceful motion. You
could even bypass the whole embarrassment thing and
make like Roxy Sass by getting off from the unexpect
ed attention, using it to fuel your pornstar fantasies.
Of course, you could always leave the old sock on the
door. But when that deliciously shaggy-haired soccer
player is running his fingers along the elastic of your
panties, these things tend to slip your mind.
Whatever happens, just remember that almost
everyone gets walked in on. It's a little like masturbat
ing or getting caught shoveling animal lard into the
back of a Ford. Even if it does happen, remind yourself
that you're getting some sweet, sweet ass. Sometimes in
this stressful college life, that's all that really matters.
Got any pornstar fantasies of your own? Roxy Sass wants to
hear them. Email her to roxysass@daily.stanford.edu.
