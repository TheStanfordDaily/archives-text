# Get your experimentin’ on

This is tenth in a series of articles called
"The Record Bin " exploring classic albums
from the past.
Quite often, the world of techno can
be faceless and cold. Rock has it easy:
Pretty much everyone wants to be a rock
star, and there are lots of faces that can be
identified with rock. Very few techno
groups or DJs can be singled out in die
same way as, for example, Rivers Cuomo
or Thom Yorke, thick-rimmed glasses or
lazy eyes acting as instantly recognizable
traits, ff a guy has big headphones or a set
of turntables in his picture, then he might
get identified as a techno DJ. Maybe.
However, Moby is different. He brings a
big bald head and a big goofy grin to the
entire genre.
So what was everyone's favorite vegan
DJ doing before everyone fell in love with
his album "Play" and saw the silly picture
of him in the astronaut suit? He was get
ting his experiment on!
"Everything Is Wrong" was Moby's
first album released in America. In it,
Moby gives us a good variety of songs
ranging from chill, piano-driven melodies
to upbeat, thumping techno. This album
is one of his more experimental, so there's
something for everyone.

Everything is Wrong
1996

For two of the tracks, ethereal singer
Mimi Goese provided the vocals. While
singing over new-age-sounding music
can come dangerously close to Enya,
diese tracks are some of the best on the
album. Her voice combines with the chill
tempo fora haunting effect, creating
songs that stick out from any other in
"Everything is Wrong."
Two songs are metal rcxk-style songs
that are probably the experiments that
led to his subsequent album of punk
songs. Fortunately, Moby only uses die
style for these two tracks. For the rest of
the album, he gets his shit together and
provides solid "electronica," as the hip
sters of yesteryear would say.
The rest of the album was one of the
things that got me into techno in the
first place. The first time I heard "God
Moving Over the Face of the Waters," I
was breathless. It is an epic seven
minute piece that picks up your soul
and dances around the room with it.
Contrasted with that song is my other
favorite on the album, "Anthem." This
is more traditional techno; "frenetic" is

a good word for it.
Moby deserves a great
deal of credit for pro
viding kids with a
good introduction to
quality techno music.
Some purists may
decry this saying he's
too pop, but whatever.
Moby has churned
out lots of wonderful,
fun techno for people
who might never have
listened to that genre
of music otherwise.
After I discovered
Moby, I got into tech
no in a big way, but
moved on to bigger
and better things.
Why is it that after I've
moved out of my tech
no fan phase, I still lis
ten to the Moby al
bums? He provides
something different
from the usual techno.
Instead of just turnta-

bles and samples, he gives us some soul
and feeling: He may be pop, but he's
damn fine pop.
That's probably why he's so cool.
Moby has personality. He can be put

into different sections in music stores,
because he leaps over genre barriers in a
single bound. Give this album a listen
and take a dip into some techno with
personality.
