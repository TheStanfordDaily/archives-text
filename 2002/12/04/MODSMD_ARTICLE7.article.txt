# Libraries to close during winter break
## 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
Many Stanford students, faculty and staff will
need to find a new place to study and do research
over winter break, because of the University's esti
mated 8 percent budget cuts that Provost John
Etchemendy informed the Faculty Senate about on
Oct. 24, Stanford is closing its libraries, "adminis
trative buildings" and "office spaces" from Dec. 21
to Dec. 29, Etchemendy told a group of GSC offi
cers yesterday morning.
According to GSC Chair Grace Chang,
Etchemendy said that the administrative buildings
and office spaces that would be closed include all
non-laboratory buildings, which she interpreted as
the entire Main Quad and other University build
ings that only contain offices.
All University libraries will be closed from Dec.
21 to 29, Jan. 1, 4 and 5. Some libraries, including
Green and Meyer, will have limited services on Dec.
30 and 31 and Jan. 2 and 3.
Etchemendy told the GSC officers that these clo
sures are necessary to save on heating and staffing
expenses over the break given the budget cuts.
The meeting took place this morning so the GSC
officers could inform the Stanford community
about the closings.
"The GSC members who went to talk with
Provost Etchemendy understand the budget crisis
the University is entering," Chang said. "However,
we have heard through the libraries that upwards
of 500 graduate students per day
use Green over the holiday break,
so it will definitely be affecting a sig
nificant proportion of students.
"Since faculty and post-docs also

use the libraries over break, it will af
fect them as well. We were con
cerned that the University wasn't
distributing tiiis information to the
community, and so we are helping
to get it out."
