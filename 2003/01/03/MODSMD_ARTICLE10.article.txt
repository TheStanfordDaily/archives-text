### 
LONDON (AP) — Partners of seven men ar
rested in connection with the discovery of the
deadly toxin ricin in a London apartment may
still be at large with more poison, police said
yesterday.
London's Metropolitan Police announced
they had apprehended a seventh suspect in the
case Tuesday and added that their inquiry was
still active, with more arrests possible.
Police believe the suspects had intended to use
the poison — one of the world's most potent tox
ins — to kill a small number of people in hope of
terrifying Britons.
"We don't think that the intention was to do a
mass attack, but we thought it would be more lor
smaller targets, one or two people, just to cause
fear and panic," he said, speaking on condit ion of
anonymity.
Police did not identify the seventh suspect,
saying only that he was years old and was
being held at a London police station. They said
the first six suspects were in their late teens, 2()s
and 30s and were of North African origin, but
would not specify what country or countries they
come from, declining to confirm media reports
that the men are Algerian.
Six of the men were arrested Sunday in north
and east London. Police said Tuesday that ma
terial seized from a Hat in the Wood Green
neighborhood tested positive for traces of ricin,
which can kill within days. There is no antidote
or treatment.
A spokesman for the local council in the Is
lington section of north London said it had paid
to house two of the suspects in the flat where the
poison was found. He said they were seeking
political asylum and were between Hi and IS
years old.
Ricin (pronounced RIGL-in) is derived from
the castor bean plant, which is grown around the
world, and is relatively easy to produce.
