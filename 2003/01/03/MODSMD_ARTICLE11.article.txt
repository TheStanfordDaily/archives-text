## The 						Stanford Daily ISIS calendar project could unify Stanford campus 
### 
Last quarter, members of the Stan
ford community devised a project
called Innovative Student Informa
tion Services (ISIS), the latest of
many attempts to centralize information about
events on campus. In the following months, the
organizers will introduce a pilot program to de
termine how ISIS should be implemented. We
recognize the potential of this collaboration and
look forward to the upcoming pilot project.
Under the ISIS vision, student organiza
tions will submit commercials and advertise
ments to announce upcoming speakers, per
formances, sports and other events. Rather
than relying on countless iliers and e-mails,
members of the Stanford community will learn
about these activities from giant, colorful video
screens placed throughout campus. Addition
ally, an online version of the event calendar will
allow students to access these campus activities
and announcements.
ISIS organizers represent a wide range of

campus involvement and interests; the group
includes an alum now working as a software de
veloper, an undergraduate comparative litera
ture major and a doctoral candidate in aero
nautics, among others. This group of students
embodies an admirable vision to meet the di
verse needs of the Stanford student body. In ad
dition, most major University offices are sup
porting the project.
With more than 500 student groups and
countless clusters of interest, our campus ben
efits from diverse communities, which all con
tribute to the university experience. As a re
sult, e-mail inboxes and blank walls are flood
ed with event advertisements as each group
uses common space to publicize events. A stu
dent biking through White Plaza is more likely
to witness a blur of banners and posters than to
take note of individual advertisements for spe
cific events. A centralized source of informa
tion will better connect students to Stanford's
diverse offerings.

In the past, student and administrative ef
forts have experimented with ways to central
ize information. While some of these attempts
have produced partial solutions, none have ef
fectively instituted a one-stop shopping source
for student activity. Building on the successes
and failures of these efforts, ISIS has devel
oped a tech-savvy approach to campus events
and announcements.
In February, students will experience the on
line version of the pilot. By the beginning of
next quarter, events will be publicized on cen
trally located video screens. During spring
quarter, the campus will hopefully reap the ben
efits of a fully functional information base. In
conjunction with its University partners, ISIS
will adapt the pilot to the needs of students.
As the diversity of Stanford interests are
consolidated into one video screen, students
will be presented with opportunities to step
outside their comfort zones. Organizations will
be able to publicize with easier access to a larg-

er base of students. The ISIS project promises
to connect individuals with similar interests to
ultimately strengthen academic and social
communities. Despite such benefits, ISIS must
resolve a few challenges before launching its
information services.
First, since advertisements will be broadcasted
across campus, a screening process should as
sure that announcements represent credible
events. Also, ISIS should take measures to guar
antee that groups have equal access to advertis
ing resources. Finally, ISIS must work to shift
the campus inclination toward this new technol
ogy. Fhe wide base of campus backing should
help ISIS leap these hurdles.
As winter quarter progresses, we will either
benefit from the centralized information sys
tem or bear the burden of its un-maximized
potential. Either way, the organizers of ISIS
are to be commended for bridging the gap
between diverse communities on a campus
wide scale.
