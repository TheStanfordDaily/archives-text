One of the most trying experiences
of being a libertarian conservative
is the realization that virtually all
the "cool" people — movie stars, rock mu
sicians and comedians — are, overwhelm
ingly, liberal.
Witness the scores of celebrities (many
of whom, albeit, were recruited from the B
list or lower) who have issued a statement
of protest against a potential war in Iraq.
Anyone who has watched the popular
political drama "The West Wing" lias like
ly learned the program's invaluable les
son: Republicans are stodgy, myopic, self
interested morons whose behavior must

be reformed by Martin
Sheen's coterie of heart
wrenchingly idealistic
Democrats.
Some of the most in
nocuous programs, too,
can carry an implicitly
progressive message. Re
cently, VIII aired a spe
cial on the year 1972

/
which — despite the ostensibly aesthetic
focus on popular music — repeatedly
snuck anti-Nixon evaluations into the nar
rative. VHl's hero of 1972, fittingly, was
George McGovern, the Democratic presi
dential candidate who won only one state
in the election; radical figures of the late
1960s lamented that McGovern's defeat
trumpeted the end of so much social
progress and "enlightenment."
The preponderance of liberalism in
popular culture is nowhere more disheart
ening for me than in music, particularly in
hard rock and punk. The Clash, arguably
the finest punk band in history, were mili
tant radicals. The lead singer of the Dead
Kennedys, Jello Biafra, ran against Ralph
Nader in the Green Party primary in 2000;
his platform included a maximum wage
and the total abolishment of the military.
So when I listen to punk music, my favorite
type of music, I must interpret the lyrics
ironically, lest I feel that my favorite musi
cians hate me.
Since I first began to identify myself po
litically with the GOP (with libertarian
reservations), 1 have been frustrated by
the paucity of cool or funny conservatives.
Recently, however, I have discovered an
encouraging voice from the most unlikely
of sources: the impossibly vulgar and
transgressive cartoon "South Park."
"South Park," for the uninitiated, is an
animated comedy series about a group of
foul-mouthed fourth-graders in small
town Colorado. The creators of "South
Park," Trey Parker and Matt Stone, de
scribe themselves as "small I" libertarians.
The show itself betrays a more assertive
political orientation.
It may seem a little absurd to engage
the "South Park" movie in a critical analy
sis, but the overarching theme of the film
is that parents bear the ultimate responsi
bility for their children's language, ethics

and behavior. 1 cannot think of a position
more consonant with core Republican
values.
In a recent episode, the children of
"South Park" are subjected to a draconian
"tolerance camp" (with perhaps distaste
ful allusions to Nazi concentration camps)
in a parody of hyper-sensitivity. The im
petus for the children's re-education is the
flamboyant homosexual exhibitionism of
their teacher Mr. Garrison (who is trying
to contrive a lucrative anti-discrimination
law suit). The parents of South Park,
meanwhile, applaud his "courage" even
when he rides his S & M-clad sexual ser-

any type.
vant "Mr. Slave" onto the stage to receive
a civic award. Ultimately, Mr. Garrison de
livers the episode's message: Tolerance is
good; wanton permissiveness is not.
Certainly a repellent chain of events
— to both the Dr. Lauras and the Tip
per Gores of the world — but undeni
ably hilarious.
Parker and Stone have ridiculed sex
education in school, anti-tobacco adver
tisements, class struggle, race relations
and (their perennial target) censorship
and the MPAA. They have also explored
— and managed to make funny — the
ethical miasma which necessarily sur
rounds cloning and abortion. The writers
of "South Park" quite clearly have no
qualms about marijuana, either.
Of course, much of their anti-liberalism
is incidental to Stone and Parker's largely
undiscriminating satirical assault on
hypocrisy; hypocritical conservatives are
not exempt from cartoon lampooning ei
ther. Consider the shows which mock in
sincere patriotism, trigger-happy red
necks and corporate leviathans.
Unlike the paleoconservatives iti the
party who may tend toward the same
high-minded interventionism they claim
to oppose, the next generation of Repub
licans don't particularly care what you clo
in private.
South Park Republicans may repre
sent the rebirth of classical liberalism,
unadulterated by paternalistic govern
ment of any type. Now, while this ideo
logical shift may break with tradition, it
does mean that South Park Republicans
can laugh a little less guiltily.
