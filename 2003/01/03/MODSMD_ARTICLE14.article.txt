Claims of Israel's lawlessness 'unfounded'
I implore the Stanford community to
disregard Prof. Joel Beinin's alarmist
letter to The Stanford Daily ("Professors
call for Americans to speak out," Jan. 8).
[Editor's note: Beinin is one of 800 Amer
ican professors who co-signed the let
ter.] Beinin is a longtime critic of Israel
and frequently abuses his academic po
sition to bash the Middle East's sole
democracy. Beinin's recent letter is only
his latest attempt to advance his anti-Is
rael agenda.
While I am sure Beinin is delighted at
the prospect that Israel may finally live up
to the lawless image he has long attributed
to her, I assure readers that there is little
danger of "ethnic cleansing" of the Pales
tinians by Israel.
Despite the uncompromising tenden
cies of certain factions within Sharon's
government, Israel is and will continue to
be a country where rule of law prevails.
The principles of moderation and decen
cy that guide the Israeli government's ac
tions are safeguarded by a completely in
dependent High Court of Justice, a free
and outspoken press and all the other in
stitutions that keep power in check in
healt by democracies. As a result, Israel has
consistently strived to act within the
bounds of international law despite the
most adverse security challenges.
Certain parties to the Arab-Israel con
flict have tried time and again to smear Is
rael's name over the last two years of vio
lence, resorting to the basest and most un
founded ( barges of untoward behavior by

the Israeli military. It should be noted that
time and again such charges have proven
to be little more than propaganda for con
sumption by an overly willing internation
al press.

Israel does not practice ethnic cleansing
Prof. Joel Beinin's letter is truly difficult
to understand.
Israel's democratic government has
10 Arab-Israeli members of parliament.
Nineteen percent of Israel's citizen
population is Arab. Arab-Israelis (and
especially Arab-Israeli women) enjoy
more democratic freedom and econom
ic opportunities than do Arabs in any
Arab country.
Israel's body politic and its govern
ment have, over and over during the
past 65 years, demonstrated their will
ingness to live iu peace alongside any
Arab neighboring state, including a
Palestinian state, as long as that state
commits to peace with Israel. So far, only
two Arab states have subscribed to this
concept: Kgypt and Jordan.
It was the Arab states that practiced
ethnic cleansing when they forcibly drove
out 900,000 of their own Jewish citizenry
in the years following the creation of the
State of Israel.
There are indeed "expulsionists" in the
I.ikucl government coalition. They are a
small and almost powerless minority. Most
Israelis consider them a lunatic fringe.

Historically, the Arab leadership has prac
ticed ethnic cleansing against Jews. But Is
rael does not, nor has it ever, done so
against Arabs.
So what is Prof. Beinin talking about?

Law forbidding women to go into
combat should be changed
Assuming all information given in
David Behrens' letter to (he editor is cor
rect, it is evident that the main problem
is that Congress forbids women to go
into combat. ("Gender discrimination
prevalent in Selective Service guide
lines," Jan. 7) That is true gender dis
crimination. I think the most effective
way to change the situation is to chal
lenge the constitutionality of this law in
court. I would like to call attention to the
struggle of the feminist organizations in
Israel for equal participation of women
in the Israeli Defense Forces. The strug
gle is far from over, and lately, it has suf
fered some setbacks. 1 hat said, many
achievements were reached by appeals
to the Israeli Supreme Court. In a
known 1994 case, Alice Miller vs. the De
fense Minister, the Israeli Supreme
Court declared gender discrimination in
the Pilot Course illegal and reopened it
for women for the first time since the
19505.
