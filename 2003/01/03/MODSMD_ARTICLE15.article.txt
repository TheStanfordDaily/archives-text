# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Faculty Senate should take a stand against USA Patriot Act 
### JOHN HAMILTON GUEST COLUMNIST 
112 he Stanford community has been
abuzz as of late regarding how the USA
Patriot Act will affect life at our research
university. This Monday, for instance,
I he Daily covered two stories on its front
page about the Justice Department track
ing information on students and re
searchers on campus.
The Patriot Act, hastily passed after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, requires docu
mentation on a poorly defined set of sub
stances used for scientific research, and
limits who may use these materials based
on nationality. This essentially assumes
certain researchers to be guilty of terrorist
affiliations on arrival and promotes intol

erance and hatred. Further, the Patriot
Act eliminates the need for investigators to
gather a warrant, a fair and reasonable
way of proving relevance to a case, in
order to collect information previously
protected by the Family Education Rights
and Privacy Act. Additionally, everyone's
library records and Internet search re
quests can be legally compiled and scruti
nized by the Justice Department.
These matters, which directly infringe
upon research and academic inquiry in a
university, do not begin to describe the lull
reach of this act. The Patriot Act also allows
the indefinite detention of non-citizens
without judicial review, single-jurisdiction
search warrants and wiretaps, and the fed
eral monitoring of groups that could po
tentially be unfavorable to those in power.

Consider the case of Mustapha Ghezali, a
student at San |ose State University of Alge
rian origin, but with dual French and Amer
ican citizenship. After the 181 interrogated
him — solely because of his nationality, he
believes — he became ostracized on cam
pus. One day aftet an exam, a fellow student
accused him of making a terrorist threat.
Ghezali was then arrested at gunpoint and
detained for two nights in the county jail. No
charges were brought. Ghezali was banned
from campus, and, as he puts it, now lives in
a state of "complete fear."
Faculty members have expressed their
concerns about how this legislation removes
the judicial oversight necessary to prevent
gross infringements on liberties. In the last
two Faculty Senate meetings, faculty mem
bers have tilled over the implications of the

legislation on University activities and have
pondered how to accurately convey their
feelings regarding the Patriot Act.
The city councils of several cities have
already come out opposing how the Patri
ot Act cracks down on basic civil liberties.
More than 50 other resolutions are pend
ing in 25 different stales.
Flit* Stanford faculty should take part
in this national movement by expressing
their displeasure and disapproval of this
dangerous federal overstep. While 1 rec -
ognize University President John Hen
nessy's concerns about the resolution's
"credibility," the Senate must recognize
the act as another chapter in the American
history of excessively invasive wartime leg
islation. Yes, it is important to keep one
eye on how such a -resolution will be

viewed by others, Inn at the same time fac
ulty members must slay aware of their
obligation as leaders of academic: and in
tellectual freedom.
I lie Daily has lived up to its duty by en
couraging a faculty resolution true |o
these Stanford principles. Now it is the
Faculty Senate's turn. When they convene
this afternoon, their integrity and the in
tegrity of this prestigious institution will be
tested. Only the passage of a strong reso
lution reaffirming the University's sup
port for Constitutional rights and univer
sal civil liberties will send an appropriate
message to our national leaders.
