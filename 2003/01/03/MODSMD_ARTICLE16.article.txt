# Princeton community debates campus intellectualism

### ANDREW BOSSE ABBY WILLIAMS THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. — A
silent precept. Tales of weekend debauch
ery over Sunday brunch. A professor sit
ting alone during office hours. Do these sit
uations occur too often at one of the top
universities in the country?
That question is at the center of a debate
over campus intellectualism.
The specter of anti-intellectualism at
Princeton University has haunted the uni
versity since the turn of the century, when
the school was seen as a veritable country
club for the sons of the well-to-do.
Woodrow Wilson in 1879 first suggested
four-year colleges and introduced the
precept system to reform a student body
he saw as under-stimulated and even out
right resistant to the university's academ
ic mission.
The U-Council's letter to the student
body published in The Daily Princetonian
on Sept. 30 marks the first time students
have publicly raised the issue. The letter
encouraged the university community to
examine the intellectual vibrancy of cam
pus life.
In classrooms, dormitories, dining halls
and eating clubs students and faculty have
been discussing "intellectualism" — which
is a difficult concept to define. Those inter
viewed tended to define it as an enthusiasm

lor and engagement with one's studies in
side and out of the classroom.
Some have pointed to precept structure,
composition of the student body and social
life at the 'Street' as possible roots of the
problem — arguing that there is not
enough overlap between students' acade
mic and social life. But others believe that
no problem exists, and any ostensible intel
lectual shortcomings reflect national
trends not endemic to the university.
History Prof. Anthony Grafton, who
participated in the initial intellectualism
forum in the Frist Campus Center with
professors John Fleming GS '63 and
Patrick Deneen, is among the many who
believe the academic climate on campus
needs improvement.
"Princeton is a less intellectual place
than it ought to be," he said.
Fleming agreed, summarizing his view
of the problem: "A lot of. . . students [are]
living intellectual lives that are unadven
turous and confined and constrained."
Some blame admission policies for the
dearth of intellectual excitement. Philoso
phy Prof . Henry Frankfurt said he worries
that the school accepts too many students
for nonacademic reasons — such as athlet
ics and legacy ties.
Admission Dean Fred Hargadon did
not return telephone calls and e-mails for
this story.
"[They are] not the strongest students in
the University," Frankfurt said.

He said Princeton has a more promi
nent "jock culture." At Yale University —
where he taught before coming to Prince
ton 12 years ago — academically minded
students set the tone of the student body,
he said.
Jason Navarino '04, who just returned
from a semester abroad at Oxford Univer
sity, also noticed differences between the
two student bodies. Oxford students are ad
mitted on a strictly academic basis of high
grades and near perfect scores on A-level
exams, with few concessions made for stu
dents stronger in areas outside academics.
Navarino said conversations during the
day at Oxford were more focused on work
and what people were studying than at
Princeton, attributing the difference to the
daily "9-5" work schedule, which allows
meals to be taken when academics are on
the forefront of students' minds.
There are also significant differences be
tween the predominant social outlets at
Princeton and at Yale, where students gen
erally favor intimate room parties to the
anonymity of the 'Street' scene.
Yali Lewis '05, who transferred to Yale
from Princeton last year, said Yale's calmer
and more personal social scene fosters ca
sual conversations that are generally more
"intellectual" in nature.
Harvard University has also been
wrestling with the balance between the so
cial and academic realms. Local bars and its
exclusive Finals Clubs have received criti

cism — similar to that aimed at the 'Street'
— for (heir negative influence on students.
Under the guidance of a new dean of arts
and sciences, I larvard is also undergoing a
complete reevaluation of its curriculum.
Using the input of faculty and students, the
administration is seeking to define more
concretely what it means to receive a Har
vard education, according to Sujean Song
Lee, president of Harvard's Undergradu
ate Council.
"The bottom line is that 1 don't feel like
there's a general excitement about acade
mics," Lee said.
At Princeton, the precept system has
borne the brunt of recent criticisms. Almost
everyone has encountered a classroom
filled with "bright" students who remain
silent, reluctant to participate in class dis
cussion. Deneen said lie had observed an
"absence of a robust willingness to talk dur
ing preceptorials."
Many students and faculty have also
questioned the effectiveness of graduate
student preceptors, frustrated that some
do not speak English well enough to com
municate their subject matter clearly.
Grafton also questioned their "moral au
thority" to command undergraduate re
spect, recalling the original system of pro
fessor-run precepts.
Although some problems with the intel
lectual environment may be structural in
origin, national trends also influence the
student body.

been discussing "intellectualism" — which
is a difficult concept to define. Those inter
viewed tended to define it as an enthusiasm

lor and engagement with one's studies in
side and out of the classroom.
Some have pointed to precept structure,
composition of the student body and social
life at the 'Street' as possible roots of the
problem — arguing that there is not
enough overlap between students' acade
mic and social life. But others believe that
no problem exists, and any ostensible intel
lectual shortcomings reflect national
trends not endemic to the university.
History Prof. Anthony Grafton, who
participated in the initial intellectualism
forum in the Frist Campus Center with
professors John Fleming GS '63 and
Patrick Deneen, is among the many who
believe the academic climate on campus
needs improvement.
"Princeton is a less intellectual place
than it ought to be," he said.
Fleming agreed, summarizing his view
of the problem: "A lot of. . . students [are]
living intellectual lives that are unadven
turous and confined and constrained."
Some blame admission policies for the
dearth of intellectual excitement. Philoso
phy Prof . Henry Frankfurt said he worries
that the school accepts too many students
for nonacademic reasons — such as athlet
ics and legacy ties.
Admission Dean Fred Hargadon did
not return telephone calls and e-mails for
this story.
"[They are] not the strongest students in
the University," Frankfurt said.

He said Princeton has a more promi
nent "jock culture." At Yale University —
where he taught before coming to Prince
ton 12 years ago — academically minded
students set the tone of the student body,
he said.
Jason Navarino '04, who just returned
from a semester abroad at Oxford Univer
sity, also noticed differences between the
two student bodies. Oxford students are ad
mitted on a strictly academic basis of high
grades and near perfect scores on A-level
exams, with few concessions made for stu
dents stronger in areas outside academics.
Navarino said conversations during the
day at Oxford were more focused on work
and what people were studying than at
Princeton, attributing the difference to the
daily "9-5" work schedule, which allows
meals to be taken when academics are on
the forefront of students' minds.
There are also significant differences be
tween the predominant social outlets at
Princeton and at Yale, where students gen
erally favor intimate room parties to the
anonymity of the 'Street' scene.
Yali Lewis '05, who transferred to Yale
from Princeton last year, said Yale's calmer
and more personal social scene fosters ca
sual conversations that are generally more
"intellectual" in nature.
Harvard University has also been
wrestling with the balance between the so
cial and academic realms. Local bars and its
exclusive Finals Clubs have received criti

cism — similar to that aimed at the 'Street'
— for (heir negative influence on students.
Under the guidance of a new dean of arts
and sciences, I larvard is also undergoing a
complete reevaluation of its curriculum.
Using the input of faculty and students, the
administration is seeking to define more
concretely what it means to receive a Har
vard education, according to Sujean Song
Lee, president of Harvard's Undergradu
ate Council.
"The bottom line is that 1 don't feel like
there's a general excitement about acade
mics," Lee said.
At Princeton, the precept system has
borne the brunt of recent criticisms. Almost
everyone has encountered a classroom
filled with "bright" students who remain
silent, reluctant to participate in class dis
cussion. Deneen said lie had observed an
"absence of a robust willingness to talk dur
ing preceptorials."
Many students and faculty have also
questioned the effectiveness of graduate
student preceptors, frustrated that some
do not speak English well enough to com
municate their subject matter clearly.
Grafton also questioned their "moral au
thority" to command undergraduate re
spect, recalling the original system of pro
fessor-run precepts.
Although some problems with the intel
lectual environment may be structural in
origin, national trends also influence the
student body.
