## Small gym squad has high hopes 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though small in number, the Stan
ford men's gymnastics team is a veteran
squad. With two NCAA event champi
ons and a run to the NCAA finals last
year, the team wants its experience to
carry the squad throughout the season.
The team roster lists 10 gymnasts.
One of those gymnasts, sophomore
Bryan McColgan, won't compete this
year because of recent wrist surgery.
But the small numbers won't lower
the team's expectations.
First-year head coach Thorn Gliel
mi admits his team isn't the deepest in
the country, but the Cardinal is still
set on at least matching last year's
solid showing.
"We decided as a team that our goal
is to make NCAA team finals," said ju
nior Dan Gill. "Not a lot of teams are ex
pecting much from us because we grad
uated such a strong group of guys.
That's motivating us to prove that we're
still one of the best teams in the country."
"We have a lot to live up to, especial
ly with making team finals last year,"
said sophomore Daniel Torres-Rangel.
"We at least have to repeat."
Is this a realistic goal for such a small
squad?
"Thorn sets his goals from what he
sees, not from what he wants," Torres-
Rangel said. "This is what he sees for
our team, and it is up to us to make it

happen."
Glielmi said the Cardinal does not
have a dominating event this year, al
though the team has at least one rou
tine with lull 10.0 difficulty on most
events.
"Anyone with a 10.0 start value is a
serious contender lor a national title,"
Glielmi said. "We'd like to come home
with an All-American on every event."
According to Glielmi, the team's
strongest event is the pommel horse,
where it can post at least six solid scores.
Seniors Matt McLean, Marshall Erwin
and (lade Raggio will compete 10.0
routines this year.
Senior Marshall Erwin will try to de
fend his NCAA title on the rings. But
despite having the defending NCAA
champion on that event, rings is the
team's weakest event, though Torres-
Rangel should boost the ring lineup
when he returns to competition from
back injury.
On the floor exercise, Gill and senior
Paul O'Leary will start the season with
10.0 value routines. Freshman Sean
Doolan is also expected to contribute
on the event.
Gill will try to defend his NCAA vault
title, and McLean added a half-twist to
his vault .
"Vault will come down to O'Leary
and Doolan's progress throughout the
season," Glielmi said.
On the parallel bars, "O'Leary and
[sophomore] Kelly Lang are doing very

original work and should have solid
scores," Glielmi said. "[Freshman] Nate
Downs will also contribute."
Stanford will look to continue its tra
dition of throwing the biggest release
moves in the country on the high bars
this season.
"Gill and maybe O'Leary will be con
tenders fora national title," Glielmi
said. "McLean has also stepped up his
routine in practice."
Glielmi said that McColgan's injury
will hurt the Cardinal because he is one
of the team's top performers on floor,
vault and rings.
For the rest of the Stanford lineup,
the team's strategy is for most guys to
start with easier routines and continu
ously upgrade them throughout the
season.
"It is important that they are com
fortable with their routine and that
they learn to compete with confi
dence," Glielmi said. "If the routine is
minimal without much difficulty, that's
OK. There's no timeline to upgrade
the routines."
"I'm more excited about this com
petition season than any other season,"
said McLean, one of four seniors on
the Stanford roster. "Maybe it has
something to do with the fact that I'm
a senior."
Glielmi, who takes over the helm of
the Cardinal from 30-year head coach
Sadao Hamada, said he was unsure at
first as to how the seniors would react to
his new training program. But once
training began, all doubts disappeared.
"It was good to see the returning
guys motivated to do better," Glielmi
said. "They've really taken to the new
training and continue to progress. Es
pecially McLean â€” he's learned new
skills on every event and really sets an
example for the rest of the guys.
"As the season progresses and the in
tensity of practices increase, I feel very
comfortable that the guys will start to
see t he benefits of this training regime."
Ranked ninth in the preseason poll,
the Cardinal will kick oil the season
with Stanford's first annual Alumni
Meet this Saturday at 7:00 p.m. in
Burn ha m Pavilion.
Though intended to be a fun exhibi
tion, Glielmi expects the team to per
form with the intensity of a regular
competition.
"Every competition is an opportuni
ty," Glielmi said. "The guys' job is to
perform incredibly difficult routines
and make them look easy."
The alumni team will feature sever
al distinguished Stanford gymnasts.
All-American David Durante, who con
tinues to train with Stanford Club Gym
nastics, plans to use this meet to pre
pare for national team qualifying meets
later this year.
But not all the alumni have lofty
goals for this competition.
"I just want to make it through four
events without getting injured," said
38-year-old Jon Louis, the 1986
NCAA all-around champion. "I
should get double the score since I'm
twice their age."
Glielmi said that unlike the varsity
team, the alumni will be judged le
niently.
"If the alumni don't set a new NCAA
scoring record," Glielmi said, "then I'll
question if they actually graduated
from Stanford."

Though the Stanford men have lost several elite gymnasts, the remaining athletes com
prise a veteran squad that will perform routines of the highest difficulty in a bid to make
the NCAA team finals for the second straight year.
