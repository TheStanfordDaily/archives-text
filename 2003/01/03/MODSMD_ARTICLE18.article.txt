### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Following a tough trip to Texas, the Stanford
wrestling team will look to right the ship tonight
in its first home meet of the new year against
Pennsylvania.

Wrestling
vs. Pennsylvania, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.

Stanford's (2-5, 0-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
2003 got oil to a rocky start with losses to
Wyoming, Nebraska and Virginia at the Lone
Star Duals in Texas on Saturday.
Tonight's action, starting at 7:00 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion, will be Penn's first since the
Midlands Championships, which were held
Dec. 28 and Dec. 29.
At Midlands, the Quakers finished 23rd out
of 40 teams with 19 team points and no place
winners. Stanford also competed at that tourna
ment and placed 28th, but the two schools did
not square oil in any individual bouts.
"1 didn't expect to come away from the Lone
Star Duals with no wins," Stanford head coach
Steve Buddie said. "With all the excuses I could
come up with, the reality is our team still did not
have fight. It's good to know that now. I feel
good about the fact that the team seems ready to
do something about that."
Redshirt sophomores Brad Metzlerand Matt
Gentry have led the Cardinal in the first part of
the season. Both have tallied 1 I wins and a pair
of falls. The duo has also combined fora perfect
9-0 record in dual meets.
The Cardinal could be without one of the
two's services tonight, however.
"Over the holidays we took a couple hits,"
Buddie said.
The Cardinal forfeited at 133 pounds at the
Lone Star Duals because Metzlerwas injured the
night before the team left for Texas, and Stan
ford has no backup at that weight.
After the break, the Cardinal also learned
that one of its two seniors, Justin Walker, left the
team for personal reasons.
"Luckily we have someone in Brendon Fox
who is ready to step in and contribute," Buddie
said.
Fox, a 141-pound junior, posted a technical

fall against Virginia at the Lone Star Duals.
Metzler, who suffered a sprained knee, is
questionable for tonight's meet against Penn. If
healthy, he would match up with true freshman
Matt Eveleth at 133. Eveleth is 10-7 with two
major decisions.
Eveleth is just one member of Penn's talented
freshman class, which was ranked the best in the
country by several publications.
Under the leadership of head coach Roger
Reina, who is in his 17th season at the helm of
the Quakers, Penn's program has achieved
great success.
Over the past 10 years in particular, Penn
wrestling has established itself as a national
power. In that time, the Quakers have captured
seven consecutive Ivy League titles and have fin
ished in the top 20 the past five years.
The Quakers return six starters from last
year's squad, which finished 11th at the NCAA
Championships.
Sophomore heavyweight Matt Feast and
sophomore 141-pounder Jody Guiricich, both
NC lA\ qualifiers, lead the Quakers.
Feast, currently ranked by live publications,
has compiled a 12-4 record including four pins
and one major decision.
Guiricich is ranked 17th at 141 by W.I.N.
Magazine and is 17-4 this season with live pins.
At 184, junior Marcus Schontube carries an
8-2 record into tonight's meet. I le will match up
with Stanford redshirt freshman Larry
Ozowara. Ozowara has filled the 184 slot since
senior Harold Penson dropped down to 174 in
late November.
Stanford junior Nathan Peterson will face a
stiff test at 125, matching up with another true
freshman starter in Matt Valenti, who is 16-6
with six pins. The New jersey native Valenti won
six consecutive bouts to capture top honors at
the Nittany Lion Open in early December.
Peterson, an NCAA qualifier last year, is 6-7
this season, including a 2-3 mark in dual meets.
At 149, Stanford redshirt sophomore Scott
Polley, who went 1 -2 at the Lone Star Duals, has
compiled a 9-3 record, including a 5-2 mark in
dual-meet competition.
Freshman lan Bork will start at 197 in his first
home meet for the Cardinal.
Stanford's last dual-meet win came at home
to San Francisco State on Nov. 20.
