# No limp for boozehound Griese, and no playoffs for Denver
## 
### 
So it's clear that this is the time of
year that football dominates the
sport scene. Hockey fan that 1 am,
we're still in the first half of a
seven-month season, so nothing really
matters yet. Basketball . . . eh. And with
college football all wrapped up, it's all
about the pro scene for the next month
until the big showdown in San Diego.
With that in mind, and with the Bron
cos' glaring absence from the postseason
landscape, I have a lew thoughts regard
ing my hometown team.
The Broncos went into the last two
weeks Of the season knowing that if they
won out, they would win the division title
in the hotly contested AFC West. I hey
might have even snaked a home-field
game, though that was up in the air. And
what did they do?
Week 16: They get undressed by the
Raiders.
Week 17: They stomp the Arizona
Cardinals, which is like saying they ran
up the score on the local community
college.

Week 16 was the
killer. In a game that
our quarterback, the re
covering alcoholic
Brian Griese, described
before the contest as
"the defining moment
of my career," he didn't
really show up. When
he was "knocked out" of

the game with a knee injury, he was
something like 3-for-8 for 16 yards with
two picks.
11 seemed at that point that something
had certainly been defined.
Still, 1 was ready to give our wino quar
terback a break, assume that maybe he re
ally was injured and unable to play well —
until the next night when I ran into him
at a local Denver restaurant. t
I was enjoying a meal with my parents
at a small Italian restaurant when Griese
and his girlfriend walked in. I've never
seen a room in Denver turn so cold with
out some little kid in ski boots holding the
door open.

Now, I've been in a room when the
legendary John Flway would walk in, and
even after a loss the weekend before,
there would be a slow parade of people
pass his table on the way out, offering a
handshake, a smile, a chance to say hey.
But with Griese, who claimed he hurt his
ankle earlier this season tripping over his
dog, there was nothing.
And by nothing I don't just mean the
reaction of the diners in the room. I mean
there was nothing in Griese, either— no
limp as he walked in, no wince as he sat
down, nothing wrong with the knee
whatsoever. All of which made it painful
ly obvious that after Griese had been de
fined by the moment, he may have
feigned injury to escape further humilia
tion. It was utterly disappointing.
The next week, the Broncos could
have still snuck into the playoll with a win
by the Falcons over the Browns, and the
same result (either wins or losses) by both
the Jets (playing at Green Bay) and the
Patriots (playing Miami at home).
It was a tough scenario, since the odds

dictated a Jets loss to a tough Green Bay
squad at Lambeau and a Pats win in the
cold against the Fish. It never really
crossed my mind that everything could
be rendered moot with a win by the hap
less Browns over Vick 8c Co.
But that's exactly what happened. Fol
lowing a game that went both ways early
with lackluster play and turnovers galore,
the Browns took a late lead with two long
runs logo up by eight points. The Falcons
drove to get the ball inside the Browns' 5-
yard line with a first down. I lere it looked
good — four chances to score, then a 2-
point conversion for the tie and overtime.
But it just wasn't in the cards. Four
runs, four stuffs by the Browns defense. It
was ugly. And fora Broncos fan, it was a sit
uation ripe with ghosts of the playoffs past.
There were the Falcons, the oppo
nents in the last Broncos Super Bowl ap
pearance four years ago. There were the
Browns, the classic opponents from ages
ago, from the days of "The Drive" when
John Flway broke Marty Schotten
heimer's heart for the first time with a 98-

yard drive in the last five minutes of the
fourth quarter for an incredible run to
the Super Bowl. There was Wade
Phillips, the aging defensive coordinator
and former Broncos'coach, now working
for Dan Reeves, the first Broncos coach of
my era.
All of which made at least a few people
in Denver wonder, did Reeves tank the
end of the game to keep the Broncos out
of the playoffs? The Falcons knew that
the Saints had already lost, guaranteeing
them a spot.
1 actually don't think that he threw the
end of the game. I think Dunn just got
stopped by an intense defense that was it
self fighting fora playoff spot. And that's
the beauty of elimination football. It's just
a little less beautiful without the Broncos
in it, 1 saw

Matt liabin is a senior majoring in economics
who is convinced the Broncos would return to
llie playoffs if they brought Ixiclt the old-school
orange uniforms. You can reach him at
