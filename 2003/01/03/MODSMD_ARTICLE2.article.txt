# 596 admitted early to Class of 2007
## Three percent increase in applicants is lower than Harvard and Yale 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In December, Stanford admit
ted 59(j high school seniors for the
Class 0f2007 through its Early De
cision program. While early appli
cations increased greatly com
pared to last year at other top col
leges such as 1 larva I'd and Yale,
Stanford's numbers represented
only a 3 percent gain over 2001.
Because of Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Robin Mam let's
announcement in November that
Stanford will switch to a single
choice Early Action program next
year, this is the University's final
year of Early Decision.
Students admitted to Stanford
on Dec. 17,2002 represent slightly
over 24 percent of the 2,4(38 early
applications received. Last year,
556 students out of 2,390 early ap
plicants were admitted.
All students admitted early are
expected to enroll, per an agree
ment that early applicants sign,
and Mamlet reported that all early
admits typically matriculate.
These students will make up
about three-eighths of the final

i'reshman c lass size, which should
be slightly over 1,600. Approxi
mately 2,300 students will be ad
mitted by April, though around
700 of those accepted will likely
choose not to enroll.
Harvard, which follows a non
binding Early Action policy that al
lows students to apply to multiple
schools early, experienced an
enormous increase of 24.3 per
cent, from 6,125 to 7,615. Vale,
which plans to adopt the same
non-binding single-choice Early
Action policy as Stanford, also wit
nessed a large increase in early ap
plications, from approximately
2,100 to 2,600 this year.
Princeton, Columbia and the
University of Pennsylvania all saw
1 1 to 12 percent increases from last
year. Dartmouth experienced an 8
percent increase, and Cornell, like
Stanford, had a 3 percent increase
in applications.
Brown, which switched last year
from a non-binding Early Action
program similar to I larvard's to a
binding Early Decision policy,
showed a 3 percent decrease iu its
early applicants. Duke, another in
stitution that employs a traditional
Early Decision program, experi
enced an approximate 10 percent
decline in the number of early ap
plications received.
ED pool 'the most diverse we
have ever seen'

Tllis year's early admits for
Stanford represent 41 states, the
District of Columbia and 22 for
eign countries, compared to last
year's early admits of 43 states and
14 countries.
"1 his year's Early Decision pool
was the most diverse we have ever
seen," Manilet said, although she
declined to share specific applicant
data regarding race, home state, etc.
I he current nearly perfect en
rollment of early admits will
change next year, however, when
Stanford switches to its non-bind
ing single-choice Early Action pro
gram. While this new plan will still
require early applicants to apply
only to Stanford, no binding corn

mitment is asked ol'them, in an at
tempt to relieve the pressure of
making a final decision so early in
their senior year of high school.
An added benefit of the future
early application program is that
early applicants will be able to
compare financial aid packages
from various schools. A common
complaint against Early Decision
lias been that it hurts students who
need the flexibility to evaluate aid.
"Stanford is committed to meet
ing the full demonstrated financial
need of all Early Decision and Reg
ular Review admits," Manilet said.
"Still, we recognize that some stu
