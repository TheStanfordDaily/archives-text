## Justin Davis Standing Tall 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
This was supposed to be a
stoiy about how things had final
ly come together for junior for
ward Justin Davis.
A story about finally moving
beyond the frustrations and in
juries of years past.
Last Saturday, however, in the
midst of his most dominating
season to date, during a routine
offensive play against California,
Davis came up limping and was
sidelined for the rest of the game
with a sprained MCL, perhaps
altering the story just a bit.
You could see it in his face as
he slouched at the end of the
bench with a pack, of ice wrapped
tightly around his knee. You
could see it in the eyes of head
coach Mike Montgomery during
the postgame press conference.
Why him? Why now?
But as stated earlier, this was
supposed to be a story about per
severance, about a turning point
in Davis' career, about how hard
work in the offseason can really
pay dividends — and it still is,
sort of.
Needless to say, it's been a
long road to the place he's at now
— team captain, starting for
ward, vocal leader and, perhaps
most importantly, a consistent of
fensive threat.
"He's the truth," said fresh
man guard Carlton Weatherby.
"He's bringing a whole new di
mension to the team. In every as
pect of offense and defense, he's
a presence 112 ull of energy."
I his time last year was a peri
od of great 112 rustration for the 6-
foot-9 forward from across the

Bay. Montgomery was not
happy with his production and
began shifting the starting line
up in order to "change the
scenery for Justin."
What probably has hindered
Davis the most is his overwhelm
ing potential — the high expecta
tions, the star appeal, the above
the-rim game that, along with the
addition of players like Julius
Barnes and Josh Childress,
would arguably revolutionize
Stanford basketball.
And then there were the in
juries that slowed his progress:
the chipped hone in his ankle
and strained abdominal muscle
his redshirt freshman year, the
bruised ribs his sophomore
year and now the untimely
knee injury that he'll he forced
to endure.
Not to mention the growing
pains associated with adapting
to a system that isn't all that cut
out for alley-oops and one-on
one play, a mode that would be
more suited to Davis' size and
athleticism.
And although there were
times when his explosive style of
play seemed contrary to the pre
ferred methodical approach of
Montgomery, Davis has found
his way.
It may have taken a year or
two, but he's finally figured out
his place in the offensive scheme,
and has since become a much
more confident and productive
player for the Cardinal.
"He's growing up — he's ma
turing as a person," Mont
gomery said. "He's much more
comfortable with this group and
