# Oregon schools pay Cardinal a visit

### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford men's basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery said at
the beginning of the season that
his young Cardinal team would
most likely experience some
"growing pains."

Men's Basketball
vs. Oregon St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. No. 12 Oregon, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.

And sure enough, as unranked
Stanford (9-4, 0-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) moves into its first full
week of Pac-10 competition
against the Oregon schools, the
Cardinal is definitely experiencing
some pain, although not of the
maturation variety.
Suddenly, questions concern
ing which Cardinal team will show
up on a given night — whether it
be the squad that upset both No.
21 Xavier and No. 11 Florida in
November or the team that
dropped successive games to Mon
tana and Richmond — are now
overshadowed by the question .re
garding which Stanford players
will actually be available to play in
the game.
Add senior guard Julius Barnes
to the ever-growing list of Stan
ford players with ailments. Barnes
sprained his right ankle during
Tuesday's practice and is ques
tionable for tonight's game
against Oregon State. The Cardi
nal will start freshman point
guard Jason Haas if Barnes is not
available for play.
Junior forward Justin Davis'
status still remains uncertain for
tonight's game after he sprained
his left knee during Saturday's
loss to California. He is expected
to play limited minutes depend
ing upon how much pain he can

play with.
Sophomore swingman Nick
Robinson will most likely start in
Davis' place.
The departure of would-be ju
nior forward Teyo Johnson for the
NFL Draft and the season-ending
foot injury to sophomore Chris
Hernandez leaves Stanford with a
very short bench.
"For us to have a chance to win,
the guys that are left have to per
form," Montgomery said.
The injuries to Barnes and
Davis come at a very bad time for
this Stanford team, which starts off
the conference season 0-1 for the
first time in 10 years.
Stanford's most difficult test will
be Saturday's visit from No. 12
()regon (10-2, 1 -1). The Ducks are
coming off of a tough week of Pac
-10 play, in which their 23-game
home winning streak, dating back
to Feb. 24, 2001, was ended by a
No. 2 Arizona team that was with
out senior forward Luke Walton.
"These are big games for us,"
said junior shooting guard Matt
Lottich. "Dropping the first [con
ference game] to Cal, we dtig our
selves a little hole. We're going to
try hard to get two [wins] this
weekend because home games are
so precious in the Pac-10. We
know that Maples is a tough place
for teams to play, and we're look
ing forward to the challenge."
"[Luke] Jackson and [Luke]
Ridnour will be tough matchups
for us," Davis added. "It's going to
be one of those games where we're
going to have to focus, and do the
things that we know we can do well
and not try to come out and do
things that we're not capable of
doing. We have to play within our
offense in order to be successful."
Despite the recent loss to Cal,
the Cardinal players are optimistic
about their ability to compete with

the nation's elite teams.
And they should be. Stanford is
2-0 against ranked opponents this
season.
The Cardinal, however, can't
afford to look past tonight's game
against Oregon State, especially in
light of the growing importance of
home games.
"I think [the Beavers] look pret
ty good even though they lost

those two games [Arizona and Ari
zona State] at home," Mont
gomery said. "[Brian] Jackson and
[Philip] Ricci are two of the better
post players in the league."
Jackson and Ricci could present
a serious problem if Davis is un
available for action.
"I think the game against Ore

With senior guard Julius Barnes suffering from a sprained ankle, the Cardi
nal will look to freshman Jason Haas to lead them against Oregon St.
gon State is going to be another
hard-nosed battle in the Pac-10,"
said Stanford sophomore center
Rob Little. "We don't have the lux
ury to take anybody tor granted. I
think in our home opener that
we're going to have to prove to
ourselves and our fans that we're
really serious about this thing ..
Tipoff for tonight's game
against Oregon State is at 7:00
p.m. and Saturday's game against
Oregon will start at 2:00 p.m.
