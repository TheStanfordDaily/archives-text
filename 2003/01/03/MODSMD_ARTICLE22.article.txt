Boasting a 10-1 record and the recent re
turn of All America candidate junior Nicole
Powell, the Stanford women's basketball
team's toughest opponent in the Pacific-10
Conference these days is itself.

With Stanford competing against the
Oregon schools this weekend, the biggest
challenge for the surging Cardinal will be
getting up for two games against struggling
Pac-10 teams. No. 6 Stanford is already in
the lofty position of knowing that its "A"
game will beat any team in the Pac-10.
"We focus more on the things that we
need to be doing, [rather than on the other
team]," said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Her versatile and poised group seems
able to succeed at anything it puts its mind
to — a remarkable quality for team that
started the season with no healthy upper
classmen.
"\fh atever areas we really focus on we see
definite improvement in," VanDerveer said.
Against Oregon State in Corvallis tonight
and Oregon in Eugene on Saturday, Van-
Derveer would like her team to concentrate
on pushing the ball up the floor harder and
reducing turnovers — a strategy that will
turn up the pressure on overmatched, weak
er Pac-10 teams and force them to make
spectacular plays.
The Beavers (7-6, 1-3 Pac-10) and the
Ducks (5-8, 1-3) have been far from spectac
ular this season. Both teams are struggling
but for different reasons: Oregon State can't

score, and Oregon can't defend.
The Ducks are capable of putting up big
numbers offensively, but they also give up
big numbers defensively (75.1 ppg, 18$
more than Oregon State).
After winning the WNIT last year, Ore
gon has been plagued by injuries and off
court distractions this season.
On Dee. 9, head coach Bev Smith indef
initely suspended 2000 Pac-10 Player of
the Year Shaquala Williams for discipli
nary reasons. Williams had been named
one of the top five point guards in the
country by ESPN.
Three weeks later the Ducks lost sopho
more forward Amy Parrish, who quit the
team due to injuries, and All-America candi
date 6-foot-4 forward Catherine Kraayeveld.
who is out for five weeks with a staph infec
tion in her knee.
Before her injury, Kraayeveld lead Ore
gon in both scoring (17 ppg) and rebound
ing (12 rpg) and gave the Ducks an inside
outside threat. Kraayeveld hit seven of 10 3-
pointers in a game earlier this season.
Without Kraayeveld, Oregon relies on
three underclassmen to put points on the
board: 6-0 sophomore guard Brandi Davis,
who's averaging 10.5 points per game after
sitting out last season for academic reasons,
6-3 sophomore center Andrea Bills (9.5
ppg) and 6-3 freshman center Carolyn
Ganes (9.4 ppg).
Davis is an explosive but inconsistent
player who is capable of scoring in bunches,
but she sometimes forces shots. The Stan
ford guards will likely be told to give her
some room on the outside and focus on con
tainment.
The Cardinal will need to box out Bills,

The Cardinal women's basketball squad welcomes the re
turn of junior Nicole Powell. Stanford is the dominant
team in the Pac-10, but cannot afford to take its upcom
ing games with Oregon and Oregon St. lightly.
