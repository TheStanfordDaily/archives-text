Azella Perryman doesn't seem to know
how to lake w compliment. Maybe she's
just a little shy, but compliment her play,
and you'll most likely gel a curious look,
full-blown blushing cheeks and a laugh

that would make the Joker proud.
Let's do a little case study. After a recent
loss to the Stan lord women's basketball
team in which Perryman scored a career
higli 23 points and grabbed nine re
bounds, Arizona State coach Charli 1 inn
er- Phot ne revealed a bit of frustration.
"When you have a post player shooting
fade-away 18-footers, we aren't even dy
ing to take away that shot," she vented, re
ferring to Perryman's ruthless tendency to
pull the trigger on mid-range jump shots.
"If she's shooting that shot, good luck to
people playing Stanford.''

True to form, Perryman chuckled
when she heard the comment, and diplo
matically noted that it bore a little extra
importance since Turner-Thorne was
one of the coaches recruiting her out of
high school.
The 6-foot-1 sophomore better get
used to flattery with the way she's been
playing.
The Cardinal forward is nearly averag
ing a double-double (13.4 ppg, 9.9 rpg)
and is shooting 55.4 percent from the
field, fourth iu the Pacific-10 Conference.
And unbeknownst tothestal junkies, Per

ryman has provided the inside presence
Stanford didn't think it was going to have
this year.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer con
fessed at the beginning of the season that
her team was going to have to block out ex
ceptionally well since it was lacking in size.
After all, the Cardinal lost the Two Towers
— Betharfy Donaphin andCori Enghusen
— to graduation.
To be fair, there was no way Van-
Derveer could have expected such a meta
morphosis in Perryman's game.
Stuck on the bench behind the deep

Cardinal front line last winter, Ferryman
only put up 3.8 points and 3.6 rebounds
per game while averaging 8.9 minutes of
playing time.
Suddenly, this year she's a starter, aver
aging 26.1 minutes per game, and has al
ready collected four double-doubles, in
cluding an 18-rebound night against
Princeton on Nov. 29 that marked thesev
enth-best rebounding performance in
school history.
VanDerveer has even on occasion
