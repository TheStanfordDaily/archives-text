# A 						modest Azella Perryman is the Cardinal women's newest star
## The 						sophomore has added pinpoint shooting and inside presence for the Card 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Azella Perryman doesn't seem to know
how to lake w compliment. Maybe she's
just a little shy, but compliment her play,
and you'll most likely gel a curious look,
full-blown blushing cheeks and a laugh

that would make the Joker proud.
Let's do a little case study. After a recent
loss to the Stan lord women's basketball
team in which Perryman scored a career
higli 23 points and grabbed nine re
bounds, Arizona State coach Charli 1 inn
er- Phot ne revealed a bit of frustration.
"When you have a post player shooting
fade-away 18-footers, we aren't even dy
ing to take away that shot," she vented, re
ferring to Perryman's ruthless tendency to
pull the trigger on mid-range jump shots.
"If she's shooting that shot, good luck to
people playing Stanford.''

True to form, Perryman chuckled
when she heard the comment, and diplo
matically noted that it bore a little extra
importance since Turner-Thorne was
one of the coaches recruiting her out of
high school.
The 6-foot-1 sophomore better get
used to flattery with the way she's been
playing.
The Cardinal forward is nearly averag
ing a double-double (13.4 ppg, 9.9 rpg)
and is shooting 55.4 percent from the
field, fourth iu the Pacific-10 Conference.
And unbeknownst tothestal junkies, Per

ryman has provided the inside presence
Stanford didn't think it was going to have
this year.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer con
fessed at the beginning of the season that
her team was going to have to block out ex
ceptionally well since it was lacking in size.
After all, the Cardinal lost the Two Towers
— Betharfy Donaphin andCori Enghusen
— to graduation.
To be fair, there was no way Van-
Derveer could have expected such a meta
morphosis in Perryman's game.
Stuck on the bench behind the deep

Cardinal front line last winter, Ferryman
only put up 3.8 points and 3.6 rebounds
per game while averaging 8.9 minutes of
playing time.
Suddenly, this year she's a starter, aver
aging 26.1 minutes per game, and has al
ready collected four double-doubles, in
cluding an 18-rebound night against
Princeton on Nov. 29 that marked thesev
enth-best rebounding performance in
school history.
VanDerveer has even on occasion
called llic one-time reserve a "big
time" and "go-to" player.
What in the name of Anchorage
has ( hanged lor the Alaska native?
For starters, she got hull over the
summer, spending live days a week
in the weight room while attending
summer school on the Farm.
"1 can't tell, hut people that
watch me tell me that I look
stronger," said a modest Ferry
man. (Trust me, she's really pretty
chiseled now.)
Teammate Chelsea Trotter of
fered another equally good expla
nation.
"I think mentally Azella has got
ten a lot stronger," Trotter said.
"ISlie's learned ili.it | mentally you
are playing at a different level, and
it's not just a physical game."
Thai newfound mental steadi
ness didn't just appear out of the
dark. Ferryman had to work at it.
"It's different going from play
ing three or lour minutes a game
to starting," Ferryman conceded.
"The coaches had to get on me
about not getting down on myself
and being mentally tough."
Using her head is nothing new
for Ferryman, who is a scll-pro
lessed, bona fide bookworm
known for her speed-reading
ability.
"There's so many times on the
bus where everyone is kind of jok
ing around and Azella lias her
head in a book," 1 rotter joked.
Obviously, it wasn't the acade
mic side of things that hindered
Ferryman's route to Stanford.
Her locale presented the most
challenges.
Ferryman explained that play
ing hoops in Alaska wasn't any dil
lerent than lacing it up in "any
other small town, except you play
the same teams a lot since there
were only six in the conference."
That recruiters didn't want to
brave the wind-chilled environ

ment to watch mediocre prep bas
ketball was Ferryman's biggest
problem.
To compensate for the lack of
attention, Ferryman traveled up
and down the West Coast for three
or lour weeks at a time during the
summer to play basketball and get
national consideration. That's how
Stanford noticed her.
And by now at least, everybody

in the Pac-10 is more than aware of
Perryman's tenacity inside.
"She's so aggressive; she has a
very good head for the ball," Trot
ter said.
()h right, i hat's another compli
ment, isn't it?
For good reason, they're just in
abundance these days when it
comes to Ferryman's breakout
year.
