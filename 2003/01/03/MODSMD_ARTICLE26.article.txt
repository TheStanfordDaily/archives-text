# Ridnour a test for Card 'D'
## 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
For the Stanford men's basket
ball team, the point guard position
is currently in llux.
With sophomore Chris Her
nandez out for the year with a bro
ken foot, the Cardinal will rely on
senior Julius Barnes and fresh
man Jason Haas to run the team
on the court. With I lernandex out
of the rotation, junior Matt Lot
tic h should get more playing time
as well.
"Julius is going to have to play
the point — there is just no way
around it," coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "We got to use
Jason to give him some rest. Dan
[Grunfeld | and Lottich are going
to have to handle (he two-guard
situation."
On Saturday, the Cardinal (9-4,
0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) will face
No. 12 Oregon (10-2, 1-1). The
Ducks are strong at the point, led
by All-American candidate junior
Luke Ridnour. Last year, Ridnour
was second in the Pac-10 in assists
as he led the Ducks to the Elite
Eight. He was named first-team
All-Pac-10 and an honorable men
tion All-American.
During the postseason, Rid
nour was dominant as the high
flying Ducks won the regular-sea
son Pac-10 title. Oregon finished
14-4 in the conference as the
Ducks continued to improve
throughout the season.
"If I had to say the one person
who had changed our program, it
would be Ridnour and his work
ethic," Oregon coach Ernie Kent
said. "It has been contagious."
That improvement continued
this season as the Ducks began the
year on a tear. They won their first
six games, including a dominant
performance against then-No. 13
Kansas.
Ridnour has been crucial in the
team's success, averaging 19.3
points and (5.75 assists per game,
second and first in the Pac-10, re
spectively.
In particular, Ridnour has
teamed up with junior Luke Jack
son to be one of the most dominant
one-two punches in the nation.
Jackson is averaging 17.5 points

per game, playing strong from the
wing, [ackson has been a potent
outside threat, shooting 45.5 per
cent from the 3-point line.
"Ridnour and Jackson have
taken control of this team," Kent
said.
In the end, Ridnour seems to
be the heart of the Ducks squad.
This was evident last Saturday
against Arizona State. Oregon
trailed 39-33 at halliime before
coming out on lire in the second
half. I he I)uc ks shot <H I percent in
final 20 minutes to pull out to a 94-
73 victory.
Ridnour exploded during the
Ducks' 25-2 run, scoring 10 points.
He scored 21 of his team-high 24
points in the second half.
"Ridnour just took over the
game," Oregon's Jay Anderson
said. "He hit three or four straight

shots. When he drove the lane, no
body could stop him."
For the Cardinal to stop the
Ducks, it is going to have to stop
Rid nou r.
Tomorrow night, the Oregon
State Beavers (7-4,0-2) will come to
Maples Pavilion. The Beavers play
a three-guard offense, allowing
everyone to handle the hall. Fresh
man Lamar Hurd is sixth in the
l'ac-10 in assists with 4.27 per
game. 1 lowever, he is not much of
a scoring threat, averaging less
than six points a game. Witha pow
erful inside presence, ()regon Slate
will look to crash inside.
Regardless, il the Cardinal
wants to escape the weekend with
two conference wins, il is going to
