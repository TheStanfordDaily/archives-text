# Weekend bus route planned for S.F.

### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Responding to complaints from stu
dents that the combination of Stan
ford's isolation and the suspended
weekend CalTrain service have made
leaving campus nearly impossible, the
Office of Student Activities, the Depart
ment of Parking and Transportation
and the ASSU have developed several
new transportation initiatives to ease
access to San Francisco, local airports
and other destinations off campus.
The most ambitious of these initia
tives is a project to provide a bus ser
vice that will pick students up in San
Francisco after midnight on Satur
day nights.
"Students have always inquired
about a service that would do this, but
with the closure of the CalTrain ser
vice, it was moved to the top of the pri
ority list," said Judith Biller, the assis
tant director of Student Activities.
CalTrain, students' most conve
nient mode of transportation to and
from the c ity, was shut down for week
end service last July. The closure

prompted the ASSU to propose a
broad program to provide express
Marguerite buses between San Fran
cisco and the Stanford campus on
weekend nights.
"[The closure] makes it difficult for
students without cars to have fun in
the city on Saturday nights because
the bus that CalTrain runs in lieu of
the train has its last pickup in San
Francisco at 8:30 p.m.," said Nick Ro
driguez, vice president of the ASSU.
"Who wants to leave the c ity at 8:30 on
a Saturday night?"
To get to the city initially, students
will have to take one of the Call rain
RRX buses from the local station to San
Francisco, which run from 0:37 a.m. to
8:37 p.m. on Saturdays.
The Marguerite will make two
stops in the city: on Stockton and
Columbus Streets at 1:30 a.m. and at
4th and Mission Streets at 1:45 a.m.
When the bus returns to campus, it
will stop at all the points on the Mar
guerite B line: Escondido, Tresidder,
Terman and Governor's Corner. The
bus will even return to the CalTrain
station to allow students to retrieve

their bikes if necessary.
"There is no fee for this service," Ro
driguez emphasized. "There is also no
pre-registration. It is available on a
first-come, first-served basis."
The San Francisco bus service is
scheduled to start on Jan. 18. The fu
ture of the project rests on student de
mand. The ASSU encourages students
who think the program is a good idea
to try the service in the first weeks it is
offered to ensure its survival.
"If it is successful, it could open up
the way for funding fora more com
prehensive program of weekend bus
service to San Francisco and the near
est BART stations — potentially pro
viding mobility all over the Bay Area on
weekends," Rodriguez said. Currently,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni is providing funding for the
pilot project during winter quarter.
Although the bus service is the
most notable of the recent initiatives,
several others are also in the works
to ease other transportation woes.
One such plan includes the senior

class presidents and the Depart
ment of Parking and Trans
portation working together to
reduce the cost of buses for Se
nior Pub Nights.
"We have been working to offer
reduced charter bus rates to stu
dent groups for their events,"
Biller said.
In addition, the Office of Stu
dent Affairs and the Department
of Transportation and Parking
have contracted Supershuttle to
olfer lower rates to students, fac
ulty and staff during holidays and
vacations on trips to local airports.
"These programs will hopeful
ly make getting around a bit easier
for students," Biller said. "Our of
fices understand that transporta
tion is a huge issue for students, so
we are trying to tackle different
parts of it as we can."

effort between the three campus
organizations. Along with Biller

end service last July. The closure

prompted the ASSU to propose a
broad program to provide express
Marguerite buses between San Fran
cisco and the Stanford campus on
weekend nights.
"[The closure] makes it difficult for
students without cars to have fun in
the city on Saturday nights because
the bus that CalTrain runs in lieu of
the train has its last pickup in San
Francisco at 8:30 p.m.," said Nick Ro
driguez, vice president of the ASSU.
"Who wants to leave the c ity at 8:30 on
a Saturday night?"
To get to the city initially, students
will have to take one of the Call rain
RRX buses from the local station to San
Francisco, which run from 0:37 a.m. to
8:37 p.m. on Saturdays.
The Marguerite will make two
stops in the city: on Stockton and
Columbus Streets at 1:30 a.m. and at
4th and Mission Streets at 1:45 a.m.
When the bus returns to campus, it
will stop at all the points on the Mar
guerite B line: Escondido, Tresidder,
Terman and Governor's Corner. The
bus will even return to the CalTrain
station to allow students to retrieve

their bikes if necessary.
"There is no fee for this service," Ro
driguez emphasized. "There is also no
pre-registration. It is available on a
first-come, first-served basis."
The San Francisco bus service is
scheduled to start on Jan. 18. The fu
ture of the project rests on student de
mand. The ASSU encourages students
who think the program is a good idea
to try the service in the first weeks it is
offered to ensure its survival.
"If it is successful, it could open up
the way for funding fora more com
prehensive program of weekend bus
service to San Francisco and the near
est BART stations — potentially pro
viding mobility all over the Bay Area on
weekends," Rodriguez said. Currently,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni is providing funding for the
pilot project during winter quarter.
Although the bus service is the
most notable of the recent initiatives,
several others are also in the works
to ease other transportation woes.
One such plan includes the senior

"We have been working to offer

vacations on trips to local airports.
"These programs will hopeful

for students," Biller said. "Our of

tion is a huge issue for students, so
we are trying to tackle different
parts of it as we can."

Kevin Mathy played major roles in
rallying support and funding for
the various new programs.
The initiatives have not yet con
fronted any opposition. Garnering
unanimous support from mem

room for expansion in the future.
"In order to make the Stanford
experience complete, we feel it is
important to offer students the op
portunity to experience San Fran
cisco and the Bay Area in general
as a major cultural center," Ro
driguez said.
