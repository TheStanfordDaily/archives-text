# Pilot program brings wireless access
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of a one-year pilot program
to determine whether Stanford will in
vest in a full campus wireless network,
wireless Internet access points were re
cently installed in Wilbur Hall, Stern
Hall and the Cowell Cluster in a pro
gram sponsored by ResComp and Aca
demic Computing. 3Com and Cisco
have donated wireless cards to lend to
students for one year in those areas as
part of the test program.
The access points allow students
with laptops to connect to the Internet
remotely from neighboring court
yards, dining halls and common
rooms.
As part of Stanford's expanding web
of wireless availability, the new access
points join existing ones at Tresidder
Union, the Main Quad, Meyer Library,

the Law School, Terman and many
other locations.
3Com provided the equipment for
Wilbur Hall, and Cisco and Informa
tion Technology Systems and Services
funded the access points in Stern I fall.
T he pilot project will determine
whether it is worth investing in access
points for other dorms as well as which
company's equipment works better.
"Wireless is a rapidly growing tech
nology sector, although the interest is
less than what is typically found in a
commercial setting, probably because
Stanford is so widely wired already,"
said Phil Reese, director of networking
systems in ITSS. "In any case, there is a
lot of interest and ResComp wanted to
see if there would he value in deploying
a few residences."
About 1,600 students, a quarter of
the undergraduate student body, are
in the range of one of the University's

provided wireless Internet access
points, and t lie success or failure of the
pilot project will help determine the fu
ture of wireless at Stanford. ITSS will
get feedback from resident fellows, res
ident assistants and individual students
from Wilbur and Stern I lalls.
ResComp and Academic Comput
ing chose Stern and Wilbur for the
pilot program because these halls pre
sent a wide variety of difficulties as well
as opportunities for wireless Internet.
A high number of students, especial
ly freshmen, stand to gain from the
newfound accessibility. In addition,
numerous obstructions will test the
wireless signal's strength.
"As for extending the pilots campus
wide, at least insofar as the residences
are concerned, this is a matter of inter
est," said Richard Holeton, head of
