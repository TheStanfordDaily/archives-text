# Pilot program brings wireless access
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of a one-year pilot program
to determine whether Stanford will in
vest in a full campus wireless network,
wireless Internet access points were re
cently installed in Wilbur Hall, Stern
Hall and the Cowell Cluster in a pro
gram sponsored by ResComp and Aca
demic Computing. 3Com and Cisco
have donated wireless cards to lend to
students for one year in those areas as
part of the test program.
The access points allow students
with laptops to connect to the Internet
remotely from neighboring court
yards, dining halls and common
rooms.
As part of Stanford's expanding web
of wireless availability, the new access
points join existing ones at Tresidder
Union, the Main Quad, Meyer Library,

the Law School, Terman and many
other locations.
3Com provided the equipment for
Wilbur Hall, and Cisco and Informa
tion Technology Systems and Services
funded the access points in Stern I fall.
T he pilot project will determine
whether it is worth investing in access
points for other dorms as well as which
company's equipment works better.
"Wireless is a rapidly growing tech
nology sector, although the interest is
less than what is typically found in a
commercial setting, probably because
Stanford is so widely wired already,"
said Phil Reese, director of networking
systems in ITSS. "In any case, there is a
lot of interest and ResComp wanted to
see if there would he value in deploying
a few residences."
About 1,600 students, a quarter of
the undergraduate student body, are
in the range of one of the University's

provided wireless Internet access
points, and t lie success or failure of the
pilot project will help determine the fu
ture of wireless at Stanford. ITSS will
get feedback from resident fellows, res
ident assistants and individual students
from Wilbur and Stern I lalls.
ResComp and Academic Comput
ing chose Stern and Wilbur for the
pilot program because these halls pre
sent a wide variety of difficulties as well
as opportunities for wireless Internet.
A high number of students, especial
ly freshmen, stand to gain from the
newfound accessibility. In addition,
numerous obstructions will test the
wireless signal's strength.
"As for extending the pilots campus
wide, at least insofar as the residences
are concerned, this is a matter of inter
est," said Richard Holeton, head of
ResComp. "Do students want it?
We in Residential Computing
think they do and will.
"And money? We do not have
funding to pursue this, and cur
rently most departments are
being asked to cut their budgets.
The costs include the wireless ac
cess points themselves, wiring to
hook them into the existing net
work, installation and enclosures,
and maintenance, replacement
and upgrade. A very rough guess
for extending wireless throughout
the residences is $750,000."
In order for there to be cam
pus-wide wireless access, individ
ual departments and graduate
schools are going to have to fund
them, because ITSS does not have
the money to foot the bill.
Aside from the cost, the growth
of wireless access is limited by the
sheer size of Stanford's campus.
Access points have a radius of 200
to 500 feet, and in areas with lots of
obstructions such as concrete
walls, the range can be smaller.
Also, the success of Stanford's
wired Internet access makes wire
less less necessary.
"Most other universities have a
wireless deployment in place or
rolling out this school year," Reese
said. "Stanford is far from the lore
front in the roll out, probably be
cause the wireline network has
been so prevalent for some time.
Other schools are using wireless to
provide this network connectivity,
avoiding the large infrastructure
costs that a wireline network re
quires."
To take advantage of wireless
Web access, students have to reg
ister their laptop by adding the
hardware Ethernet address of
their wireless cards into the
"Comments to your RCC" field
on the In-Room Connection
Form accessible on the Internet.
Students need to already have an
in-room network connection,
which costs $10 a month, but
there is no additional charge for
wireless.
Students in Stern and Wilbur
can buy a wireless card or borrow
one fora year from their RCC.
Students with desktops can use
wireless if they have a wireless
card; however, ITSS recommends
that students do not because the
wired Internet connection is
faster, more reliable and more se
cure.
Wireless access, however, does
allow students to use the Internet
remotely for study groups, tutor
ing sessions and office hours.
