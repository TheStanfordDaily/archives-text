Fraternity wins Blood Center's Crimson
Competition
With over 95 percent of residents participating, fraternity Phi Kappa
Psi won the Stanford Blood Center's first annual Crimson Donor Com
petition held during autumn quarter.
Phi Kappa Psi held its blood drive Nov. 18 at its new house on the
Row. Thirty-six out of 37 residents donated blood.
Joel Gedalius, who coordinated the event, said half of the donations
given at the house were from first-time donors.
The new program, created by the Stanford Blood Center, challenges
Stanford students to recruit as many blood donors as possible. Phi
Kappa Psi received the grand prize of a new foosball table, which will re
main at the house unless it is challenged by another campus residence in
ibis quarter's competition.
Gedalius said Phi Kappa Psi fraternity members were not planning
on giving up the foosball table, noting that next time they might achieve
100 percent.
Jennifer Reczkowski, the coordinator of the competition, said that
residences should try for at least 20 percent participation.
"We have some highly competitive students involved, so to really win,
dorms should aim high," Reczkowski said.
Dorms exceeding the 20-percent mark were Ujamaawith 37 percent,
Lai kin with 36 percent, Paloma with 31 percent, Otero with 25 percent,
Zapata with 23 percent and Naranja with 22 percent.
Stanford-supported cave survey uncovers artifacts
A recent discovery of ancient papyrus scrolls, coins and artifacts found
in Israel's J udean Desert may be the first step in finding greater treasures
related to the Dead Sea Scrolls.
In 1998, Stanford's Geophysics Department, the Israel Cave Re
search Center at Hebrew University and the Land of Israel Studies at
Bar-Ilan University began a collaborative cave survey to take aerial shots
of the region.
According to Earth Sciences Prof. Amos Nur, the bulk of the project's
financial base was provided by Stanford's support.
These discoveries mark the first finds of the survey.
"About 200 caves have been identified — most are tiny — but 15 to 30
caves look promising," Nur said in a press release.
Me said that this project marks an unusual scientific collaboration be
tween geophysics and archaeology and that the search for scrolls has ini
tiated a new understanding of what earthquakes do.
Statue presented for the Center for Buddhist
Studies
Last month, following a ceremony outside Building 70, the Center for
Buddhist Studies received a Thai Buddha statue.
The ceremony was performed by Thai monks of Wat Bud
dhapradeep in San Bruno. Vudhi Chuchom, a retired Thai Ambas
sador, first suggested the idea of presenting the center with a Buddhist
statue a few years ago.
According to Carl Bielefeldt, a professor of religious studies, Chu
chom has been a good friend of the center and has previously donated
Thai Buddhist books to the center's library.
"We were honored to receive the statue and touched by Mr. Clui
chom's thoughtfulness in donating it," Bielefeldt said. "[ The center] is,
of course, an academic center for the study of Buddhism, not a religious
organization; so the statue may feel a little neglected without anyone
doing rituals for it."
In Brief
—Stanford University and a Santa Clara manufacturer of DNA chips,
Affymetrix, have settled a long-standing patent dispute, the parties an
nounced last month. Details were not released, though Affymetrix said
that as part of the settlement, it will fund two sciences fellowships at Stan
ford.
—A memorial fund in the Mechanical Engineering Department is cur
rently being set up for Prof. Lung-Wen 1 sai, who passed away last No
vember. Tsai was a Stanford Ph.l) student in mechanic al engineering, a
UC-Riverside professor in robotics and machine kinematics, and an in
ventor with eight patents in automotive and machine-mechanism de
sign.
—A new lecture series established by the Division of Literature, Cultures
and Languages will begin next week with a talk and seminar by Fran
coise Melt/er of the University of Chicago. The lecture, "Thinking Rup
