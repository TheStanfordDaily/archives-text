ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — A
Turkish Airlines flight split apart in
flames as it crashed short of a log
shrouded runway in southeastern
Turkey yesterday. The Transport Min
istry said 75 people were killed and live
injured.
The plane came down in the mili
tary section of the airport in the over
whelmingly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir,

leaving a pile of twisted metal and scat
tered luggage across 800 yards.
Prime Minister Abdullah (Jul said the
military dismissed sabotage as a cause.
Heavy log has been a problem in the
area in recent days and flights from Di
yarbakir were canceled earlier this week.
" The reason for the crash is being
investigated," (Jul said. "Most probably
it was bad weather conditions."

Three small children died in the
crash, the Anatolia news agency re
ported. A two-year-old boy who sur
vived the crash and was rushed to a
hospital later died, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
Turkish Airlines said there were
foreigners aboard the plane, but had
no immediate information on their
nationalities. At around midnight, the

400 soldiers who had been searching
for survivors called off their rescue
operation.
A survivor told of tailing from the
plane after it split apart on impact and
landing in a pile of hay.
"The plane split in two and was
burning. Then there was an explosion
. . . The whole plane was burning,"
Aliye II told Anatolia.
