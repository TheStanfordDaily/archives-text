Course Announcement:
Human Biology 10—Human Sexuality
Why? Sexuality lies at the core of our identities as human beings, yet education and research in
sexuality still lag behind other fields. As a result, many men and women are ignorant about their sex
ual bodies, have difficulty communicating on sexual matters, make unwise choices in their own sex
lives, or hold prejudicial opinions concerning the sex lives of others. The objectives of this course
are to help you (1) make more informed decisions about your own sex lives, (2) evaluate the many
statements, moral arguments, and research findings concerning sexuality that you are exposed to on
a daily basis, and (3) deal with sexual issues that may arise in your future careers.
Wh(Xt? This 3-credit lecture course replaces a course taught at Stanford for over 30 years by Prof.
Herant Katchadourian. It emphasizes diversity—both in sexual feelings and expression and in the
variety of academic approaches to the subject. Topics covered include the evolutionary context of
human sexuality, sexual biology, sexual behavior, attraction and arousal, relationships, sexual minori
ties, atypical sexual expression, pregnancy and childbirth, contraception and abortion, sexual dys
functions, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual development and aging, coercive sex, prostitution,
and pornography.
WhO? The instructor, Simon LeVay, is a neuroscientist who is particularly well known fora 1991
study on the brain basis of sexual orientation. He is the author or co-author of 8 books including the
course textbook, Human Sexuality (Sinauer Associates, 2002).
Whetl? Winter quarter, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:45 to 2:05 PM.
To facilitate student participation, enrollment will be limited to 250 students
