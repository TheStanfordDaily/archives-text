Men's Water Polo
NCAA Final

History may have offered little indi
cation as to who would win this year's
NCAA title game between Cal and
Stanford on Dec. 8 at Loyola Mary
mount.
So the Cardinal took it on itself to
make it clear who the nation's best team
was this year.
Stanford (24-5) claimed its second
straight NCAA championship by hold
ing off Cal (20-7) 7-6 in front of a sell
out crowd of 2,600.
The title, the 10th for the Cardinal
program, marked an optimistic start to
the John Vargas coaching era at Stan
ford. Vargas took over for former head
coach Dante Diamante who retired last
season after claiming his eighth title in
25 years on the Farm.
"It was another close game with
Cal," Vargas said. "They did a great job
and I give them credit for fighting.
They just never quit."
Stanford showed from the game's

start that it wanted the season edge
over its Bay Area rival.
Senior Peter Hudnut launched two
powerful shots out of set early within
45 seconds of each other in the first
quarter, pushing his team out to a
two-goal lead.
Will Quist got the Bears on the
board with 3:11 to go in the first, and
Cal eventually evened the game at 3-3
in the second quarter.

But sophomore Tony Azevedo
matched Cal's three second-quarter
goals on his own, and freshman stand
out Thomas Hopkins stepped up big
and netted one more to give the Cardi
nal a 6-4 lead at the half.
"What really sparked me was Peter
scoring the first two goals,"said Azeve
do, who broke Stanford's single-season
scoring record. "Playing with Peter and
[senior] Jeff Nesmith all my life, I want-

Ed nothing more than to send these
guys out with a win."
The third quarter was a defensive
struggle. The teams battled to a stale
mate as neither team was able to score,
and Stanford nursed its two-goal lead
into the final period.
