## 
### 
On Dec. 12 Voulfi-Be junior
forward / sophomore wide re
ceiver Teyo Johnson announced
his decision to forgo his remain
ing years of NCAA eligibility in
both basketball and football and
declared himself eligible for the
2003 NFL Draft.
"The past three years at Stan
ford have prepared me for the
NFL and the real world," John
son said. "1 feel that 1 am ready
to test my skills and the chal
lenges of the National Football
League."
Johnson, who told the San
Jose Mercury News that he orig
inally came into Stanford "with a
three-year plan," finishes 10th
on Stanford's all-time career
touchdown receiving chart after
only two years of play.
Johnson was originally re
cruited as a quarterback from
high school but was moved to
wide receiver because of an
overload of quarterbacks two
years ago.
Because of his size—(j-foot-7,
240 pounds —Johnson proved
to be a difficult offensive option
to cover. Me caught 38 passes for

565* va?cls* Tnclurlfng *
touchdowns. As a redshirt fresh
man in 2001, he was named Pa
cific-10 Conference Co-Fresh
man of the Year.
Although he was forced to
redshirt his true freshman year
under ex-Cardinal head coach
Tyrone YVillingham, Johnson
made an immediate impact as a
member of the Stanford basket
ball team. In two years of play,
Johnson started 11 games and
averaged five points and three
rebounds.
His early departure is em
blematic of an increasing trend
for the Stanford men's basket
ball program. In the last three
years, the program has lost four
marquee players early to the
professional ranks.
"Teyo is a very gifted athlete,"
said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He has everything
they look for in the NFL. He's
been a great addition to our pro
gram, and we will miss his pres
ence on our club. We wish him
all the best."
