# Powell's return strengthens women's basketball team
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
They displayed a preference for
the comeback win. They show
cased a balanced offense and a
steadily-improving defense. They
brandished a grit and tenacity to
help they grind at times — a trait
they will surely draw upon come
March.
But put in more simple terms,
the women of the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team (10-1,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) just kept
piling up the wins over the last
month. The Cardinal won six of
seven games, with only a 71-56
loss in a hostile environment at
No. 5 Tennessee ruining a per
fect record. Yesterday, Stanford
completed its non-conference tilt
with a commanding 91 -58 victory
over Pepperdine.
That kind of success represents
why many on the Farm believe this
could turn out to be one memo
rable year for the Cardinal.
"I know it's really early, but I
think this team is a really special
one," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 feel like we are
just scratching the surface [in
terms of] people clicking and
playing together."
Of course, this tempered enthu
siasm will become inflated since Ms.
Universe herself (a.k.a. Nicole Pow
ell) made her much-anticipated re
turn in Stanford's 58-38 win over
No. 19 Oklahoma on Friday.
The Kodak first-team Ail-Amer
ican had been sidelined with a
bulging disc in her back since mid-
October. VanDerveer had equivo
cated regarding Powell's condition
since the preseason, and the first
unambiguous statement to date
came when Powell was cleared to
play just before Friday night's game
against the Sooners.
She had a modest perfor
mance in her comeback game (13
points, five rebounds in 24 min
utes) but seemed to find her
rhythm again against the Waves.
Powell poured in 19 points and
pulled down 16 rebounds as the
Cardinal finished up its non-con
ference schedule with a win.
Hut the victory over Pepperdine
wasn't nearly as important as the
Cardinal's triumph over Okla
homa, the national runner-up last
season.
The much-anticipated match
up between two of the premier pro
grams in women's college basket
ball proved to be nothing less than a
defensive clinic on Stanford's part.
VanDerveer has harped on the
fact that Stanford's defense must
improve if it is to make some serious
noise in the NCAA tournament, so
she must have been happy with her

team's effort against one of the top
teams in the rough-'n'-tough Big 12
Conference.
Oklahoma shot only 28.1 per
cent from the field and missed all of
its 11 3-point attempts. Its point
total matched not only a season low
for the Sooners, but also an all-time
low for the club during Sherri
Coale's seven-year reign as head
coach.
"No one let us down on the de
fensive end of the floor," Van-
Derveer said.
In reality, everyone might not be
ballyhooing the prospects of this
Cardinal squad — now bolstered
with the return of a preseason play
er of the year candidate — had
Powell's supporting cast of charac
ters not played unbelievably well in
her absence.
The theme thus far has been bal

ance. Stanford has had six players
lead the team in scoring in its first 10
games, and that makes the (Cardinal
a tough team to prepare for.
"We knew that individually we
had to guard them," said Arizona
coach Denise Dove lanello after her
team's 82-74 loss to the Cardinal on
Dec. 29. "We weren't going to dou
ble their posts or their perimeter
players. It was live-on-live and fwe
couldn't use any] gimmick defenses
or traps."
Despite this ultra-balanced at
tack, two girls have stood out from
the rest in their own ways.
Sophomore guard Kelley Sum
inski, who has finally been allowed
to spend time at the shooting
guard position with redshirt
sophomore point guard Susan
King in the lineup, has developed
into Stanford's leading scorer with

14.3 points per game. She earned
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors
for the week of Dec. 23 with two
stellar performances against the
Arizona schools.
First, she notched a career-high
25 points in Stanford's 80-63 win
over Arizona Stale to open its Pac
-10 season. Then, she dished out
eight assists as the Cardinal
scratched out its biggest comeback
victory of the season. Stanford was
down 13 early in the second half,
before rallying fora 82-74 win over
then-No. 21 Arizona.
And true to VanDerveer's
prophecy before the season, Seb
nem Kimyacioglu, another sopho
more guard, has blossomed into a
consistent outside threat. She
scored a career-high 18 points, in
cluding four 3-pointers in Stan
ford's loss at Tennessee and then
one-upped herself, draining five 3-
pointers to notch 19 points against
Arizona.
With that kind of shooting,
Kimyacioglu has got everyone rav
ing.
"She just knocks [threes] down,
period," King said. "I think when
the shot clock is running down
everyone always has in their mind
where Sebnem is on the perimeter
because she always gives you that
presence."
VanDerveer pointed out that
Kimyacioglu has extended herself
from 21.6 minutes per game last
year to 35.7 this season.
"She really worked on her con
ditioning in (lie off-season," Van-
Derveer said. "She never asks fora
sub and she goes hard the whole
game."
In hindsight, the Tennessee
game may have been where this
Stanford team first found its identi
ty without Powell.
The Cardinal marched into
Knoxville with fashions of beating
the Volunteers for the first time
since 1996. (Incidentally, that was
the last year Stanford reached the
Final Four.)
But it got a serious reality check
from Pat Summitt's seasoned
group, as Stanford fell behind from
the get-go, trailed by as many as 22
points and lost by 15 on Dec. 18.
"We got a taste at playing at a dif
ferent pace," VanDerveer said. "1
think it will only help us.
"You want something like this to
bother people. You want them to
say, This is what we need to be
doing.'"
Ever since that defeat, the Cardi
nal started "doing" and reeled off
five straight victories.
The streak started with a spirited
69-55 victory at Boston University's
Case Gymnasium. Chelsea Trotter
had a career-high 18 points in only
16 minutes of action as the Cardinal

won in VanDerveer's childhood
haunts.
The first game of the winter
break stretch came early in Decem
ber, when the Cardinal traveled to
Stockton for its first road game of
the season against a pesky Pacific
squad. Stanford looked rusty in its
first game since 112 inals week, and was
out of sync for much of the game,

missing eight of its first 10 shots.
The Cardinal trailed by nine with
11:11 remaining in the game.
In fact, it wasn't until the last
eight minutes that the Cardinal fi
nally woke up. Led by Suminski
and her 17 second-half points,
Stanford went on a 26-7 blitz to con
clude the game and blow past the
Tigers 67-56.

first game since 112 inals week, and was
out of sync for much of the game,

missing eight of its first 10 shots.
The Cardinal trailed by nine with
11:11 remaining in the game.
In fact, it wasn't until the last
eight minutes that the Cardinal fi
nally woke up. Led by Suminski
and her 17 second-half points,
Stanford went on a 26-7 blitz to con
clude the game and blow past the
Tigers 67-56.

Redshirt sophomore center Chelsea Trotter goes up between two Rutgers de
fenders earlier this season. The women's basketball team posted big wins
over No. 19 Oklahoma and catapulted itself to a No. 6 ranking.
They displayed a preference for
the comeback win. They show
cased a balanced offense and a
steadily-improving defense. They
brandished a grit and tenacity to
help they grind at times — a trait
they will surely draw upon come
March.
But put in more simple terms,
the women of the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team (10-1,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) just kept
piling up the wins over the last
month. The Cardinal won six of
seven games, with only a 71-56
loss in a hostile environment at
No. 5 Tennessee ruining a per
fect record. Yesterday, Stanford
completed its non-conference tilt
with a commanding 91 -58 victory
over Pepperdine.
That kind of success represents
why many on the Farm believe this
could turn out to be one memo
rable year for the Cardinal.
"I know it's really early, but I
think this team is a really special
one," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 feel like we are
just scratching the surface [in
terms of] people clicking and
playing together."
Of course, this tempered enthu
siasm will become inflated since Ms.
Universe herself (a.k.a. Nicole Pow
ell) made her much-anticipated re
turn in Stanford's 58-38 win over
No. 19 Oklahoma on Friday.
The Kodak first-team Ail-Amer
ican had been sidelined with a
bulging disc in her back since mid-
October. VanDerveer had equivo
cated regarding Powell's condition
since the preseason, and the first
unambiguous statement to date
came when Powell was cleared to
play just before Friday night's game
against the Sooners.
She had a modest perfor
mance in her comeback game (13
points, five rebounds in 24 min
utes) but seemed to find her
rhythm again against the Waves.
Powell poured in 19 points and
pulled down 16 rebounds as the
Cardinal finished up its non-con
ference schedule with a win.
Hut the victory over Pepperdine
wasn't nearly as important as the
Cardinal's triumph over Okla
homa, the national runner-up last
season.
The much-anticipated match
up between two of the premier pro
grams in women's college basket
ball proved to be nothing less than a
defensive clinic on Stanford's part.
VanDerveer has harped on the
fact that Stanford's defense must
improve if it is to make some serious
noise in the NCAA tournament, so
she must have been happy with her

team's effort against one of the top
teams in the rough-'n'-tough Big 12
Conference.
Oklahoma shot only 28.1 per
cent from the field and missed all of
its 11 3-point attempts. Its point
total matched not only a season low
for the Sooners, but also an all-time
low for the club during Sherri
Coale's seven-year reign as head
coach.
"No one let us down on the de
fensive end of the floor," Van-
Derveer said.
In reality, everyone might not be
ballyhooing the prospects of this
Cardinal squad — now bolstered
with the return of a preseason play
er of the year candidate — had
Powell's supporting cast of charac
ters not played unbelievably well in
her absence.
The theme thus far has been bal

ance. Stanford has had six players
lead the team in scoring in its first 10
games, and that makes the (Cardinal
a tough team to prepare for.
"We knew that individually we
had to guard them," said Arizona
coach Denise Dove lanello after her
team's 82-74 loss to the Cardinal on
Dec. 29. "We weren't going to dou
ble their posts or their perimeter
players. It was live-on-live and fwe
couldn't use any] gimmick defenses
or traps."
Despite this ultra-balanced at
tack, two girls have stood out from
the rest in their own ways.
Sophomore guard Kelley Sum
inski, who has finally been allowed
to spend time at the shooting
guard position with redshirt
sophomore point guard Susan
King in the lineup, has developed
into Stanford's leading scorer with

14.3 points per game. She earned
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors
for the week of Dec. 23 with two
stellar performances against the
Arizona schools.
First, she notched a career-high
25 points in Stanford's 80-63 win
over Arizona Stale to open its Pac
-10 season. Then, she dished out
eight assists as the Cardinal
scratched out its biggest comeback
victory of the season. Stanford was
down 13 early in the second half,
before rallying fora 82-74 win over
then-No. 21 Arizona.
And true to VanDerveer's
prophecy before the season, Seb
nem Kimyacioglu, another sopho
more guard, has blossomed into a
consistent outside threat. She
scored a career-high 18 points, in
cluding four 3-pointers in Stan
ford's loss at Tennessee and then
one-upped herself, draining five 3-
pointers to notch 19 points against
Arizona.
With that kind of shooting,
Kimyacioglu has got everyone rav
ing.
"She just knocks [threes] down,
period," King said. "I think when
the shot clock is running down
everyone always has in their mind
where Sebnem is on the perimeter
because she always gives you that
presence."
VanDerveer pointed out that
Kimyacioglu has extended herself
from 21.6 minutes per game last
year to 35.7 this season.
"She really worked on her con
ditioning in (lie off-season," Van-
Derveer said. "She never asks fora
sub and she goes hard the whole
game."
In hindsight, the Tennessee
game may have been where this
Stanford team first found its identi
ty without Powell.
The Cardinal marched into
Knoxville with fashions of beating
the Volunteers for the first time
since 1996. (Incidentally, that was
the last year Stanford reached the
Final Four.)
But it got a serious reality check
from Pat Summitt's seasoned
group, as Stanford fell behind from
the get-go, trailed by as many as 22
points and lost by 15 on Dec. 18.
"We got a taste at playing at a dif
ferent pace," VanDerveer said. "1
think it will only help us.
"You want something like this to
bother people. You want them to
say, This is what we need to be
doing.'"
Ever since that defeat, the Cardi
nal started "doing" and reeled off
five straight victories.
The streak started with a spirited
69-55 victory at Boston University's
Case Gymnasium. Chelsea Trotter
had a career-high 18 points in only
16 minutes of action as the Cardinal

won in VanDerveer's childhood
haunts.
The first game of the winter
break stretch came early in Decem
ber, when the Cardinal traveled to
Stockton for its first road game of
the season against a pesky Pacific
squad. Stanford looked rusty in its
first game since 112 inals week, and was
out of sync for much of the game,

missing eight of its first 10 shots.
The Cardinal trailed by nine with
11:11 remaining in the game.
