# Volleyball's McGee joins basketball team
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer proba
bly realized early in the season
that she wasn't blessed with the
deepest of teams, especially on

the interior.
So, some
time in the last
month, she ap
proa c h e d
Chelsea Trotter
and asked her
to coax her
roommate into
playing for the
Cardinal.

"I was kind of thinking she
must be joking, but then she
said something else about it a
few days later, so I thought that
would be really fun," Trotter
said about her roommate suit
ing up.
Eventually, Trotter's room
mate accepted the offer and has
been practicing with the Cardi
nal since Dec. 26. But this isn't
some sort of crazy experiment by
the Stanford coach.
Trotter's roommate, after all,
isn't just any average Jane.
She's 6-foot-3 Sara McGee,
better known as the 2002 first
team Ail-American middle block
er for the NCAA runner-up
Stanford women's volleyball
team.
What many may not realize is
that McGee played high school
basketball in Davis and excelled.
During her junior year of
high school, she won MVP hon
ors in her prep league. In fact,
McGee was such a stalwart on the
basketball court that she was ac
tually courted by the Stanford
women's basketball team. How
ever, during her senior year of
high school, McGee decided to
concentrate on volleyball, and

hadn't played hoops for four
years.
But now she's turned her at
tention back to grinding in the
paint as part of the Cardinal
frontline.
"It's a good challenge for me
and will help me get in shape for
volleyball next season," McGee
said. "Rebounding and playing
defense, that's my role, so I'm
happy with that."
VanDerveer expects McGee
will need a month or so before
she can be readily inserted into
the regular rotation, mostly be
cause the junior needs to get
up to speed on the Cardinal
philosophy.
"There are a lot of plays to
learn, a little more than just the
pick-and-roll," McGee joked.
If nothing else, the junior will
serve as another body with five
fouls to give— a luxury Van-
Derveer will surely relish since
only five players average more
than 14 minutes a game.
Technically, McGee (a red
shirt sophomore in the athletic
realm) has two more years of
eligibility remaining after this
season.
In her first game against Ari
zona State on Dec. 27, McGee
pulled down three boards in
seven minutes.
Incidentally, McGee isn't the
only woman to double in both
volleyball and basketball at Stan
ford. The just-graduated Lincl
sey Yamasaki pulled that trick,
but Stanford legend Kristin Folkl
was probably the most accom
plished Cardinal to don each
uniform.
Folkl, an Ail-American in both
volleyball and basketball, played
three years under VanDerveer,
including a stellar 1997-98 cam
paign when she averaged 18.9
points and 9.2 rebounds per
game.
