# Bowl season: Lazy man's dream
## 
### 
Ahh , college bowl season. It used to be the
perfect sports season. Completely encap
sulated in the academic winter break, you
could watch as much sports as you want
ed and didn't have to worry about the test you
should be studying for, the meeting you were going
to be late to or the group project you should be
working on.
(Some of us, of course, still don't worry about

that stufl).
Anyway, things are completely
different now. It seems bowl sea
son begins just after Thanksgiv
ing. You can watch the Artificial
Bowl, brought to you by Tampico
Juice, before the grocery store
even puts out holiday candy. You
can listen to the True-Lawn
WeedWacker Bowl while your
neighbors put up their Christmas
lights.

But there is still one day in the midst of this 35-
game glut that is sacred for the bowl season: New
Year's Day. The Holy Grail of college pigskin.
Granted, it's lost some of its allure since the nation
al championship game has been kicked back a few
days. Gone are the days when every game on Jan. 1
had potential championship implications â€” the
BCS has taken care of that.
Nevertheless, no other single day of the bowl
season comes close to the magic of New Year's Day.
Rivalry weekend has its moments in the regular
season, but come the postseason, I'm all about New
Year's Day.
Let's take this hypothetical situation.
You were out late the night before, celebrating
the advent of the new year at an Irish Pub. After
more Car Bombs than you care to remember, you
finish a bottle of champagne with your friends in
the street watching fireworks. But it's cold in the
street (in fact it's snowing), so you head back to the
pub, where it's warm. Eventually, after a "few"
more pints, they kick you out.
You wake up the next morning with your shirt,
one sock and a party hat on. You have a pounding
headache. You reach for the nightstand, find a
glass of water and the television remote. You drain
the glass of water and turn on the television. Your
eyes begin to decipher familiar images; your ears
hear familiar sounds. It's the Capital One Bowl,
beamed live to you from someplace warm: Florida,
in fact, the happiest place on earth. You begin to

led better already as you sit up in bed.
The talking head on the screen describes the
clay's programming. "Full. Packed." He ran off the
list of games, some of which you have already slept
through. "You've got Texas defending their home
turf against LSU in the Cotton Bowl, what should
be a tight match between the Gators and the
Wolverines in the Outback Bowl. This afternoon
you'll gel the Gator Bowl and the Capitol One
Bowl, ending up with the Sugar Bowl and the Rose
Bowl tonight. In fact, if you can get someone to
bring you food and drinks, there is really no reason
for you to move today."
Nojoke. That's what he said.
So when 1 (let's just drop the hypothetical, shall
we?) got back home that day, I dropped right down
on the couch and tuned in to the Gator Bowl to
watch Tyrone try to lead his boys against the Wolf
pack. My mom came down to see what I was up to.
I asked her to get me some food. She asked why I
didn't get it myself. 1 told her the television told me
I didn't have to move.
Bad thing to say when you're living at home for
the break.
Needless to say, 1 missed most of the next game
cleaning my room, the kitchen and the garage. Yet
1 finished just in time for the "Mother of all Bowls,"
as one dictator might be prone to say, the Rose
Bowl.
Look, I'm not going to talk about the memories
of freshman year when Stanford played in the Rose
Bowl. I'm not going to talk about how we held Ron
Dayne to one first down in the first half and took the
early lead.
And I'm not going to talk about how the Pac-10
went down in flames again in this game, as the
Cougars got royally whooped by Oklahoma. Nope,
nothing to talk about there.
What I noticed, what I was reminded of again,
was the beauty of watching a football game in sunny
California in January. I sat back down on the
couch, my back to the window and the snowstorm
outside. I put my feet up, and cracked a Gordon
Biersch Blonde Bock; the hangover finally cured.
And as 1 watched the two teams go at it underneath
the sinking California sun, I couldn't wait to get
back.

make it warmer, though. You can reach him at
