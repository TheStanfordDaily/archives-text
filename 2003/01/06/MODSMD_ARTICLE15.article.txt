# Stanford leads after fall season
## 
### 
Even a change in the scoring system designed to
keep Stanford from running away with its ninth straight
NACDA Directors' Cup wasn't enough to keep the Car
dinal athletic program out of first after the fall season.
Stanford scored points with five teams to jump out
to a 124-point lead over second-place Penn State.
The Cardinal has 443 points thanks to a national
championship in men's cross country, second-place
finishes in women's volleyball, men's soccer and
women's cross country and a fifth-place showing in
women's soccer.
Penn State scored 319 points, finishing second in
field hockey, third in women's soccer, fifth in men's
soccer, 17th in volleyball and 25th in women's cross
country.
Notre Dame (279), Wake Forest (277) and Michi-

gan State (240) round out the top five in the stand
ings. The current scores do not yet include teams' fin
ishes in football.
A new rule was instituted this year for the Direc
tors' Cup — formerly the Sears Cup — that does not
allow sports with NCAA championships involving
fewer than 12 teams to count in the standings.
That move means that women's ice hockey, men's
and women's water polo and men's volleyball — each
of which has a four-team NCAA tournament — and
rifle will no longer contribute to a team's overall score.
The change has already affected Stanford, with
holding the 100 points it would have received for its
national championship in men's water polo.
Stanford has won every Directors' Cup since the
inaugural one went to North Carolina in 1994.
