# Fencing readies for new season
## Little-known varsity team shines on national stage 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford students are not even aware that
the University has a fencing team, let alone that the
varsity team qualifies each year for the NCAA
championships and has an Olympian on it.
Stanford fencing is a national powerhouse and a
perennial contender for the Western Regional
championship.
Stanford has both a men's and a women's team,
with the two teams' scores pooled in order to de
termine overall team placement. Fencing has a

combined championship, meaning that both teams
depend on each other. To foster the necessary
unity, Stanford's teams practice together and trav
el together, although the competitions themselves
are separated by gender.
The team is led by head coach Lisa Milgram, as
sistant coaches George Pogosov and Alex Kuznetsov
and team captain junior Mark Mulholland.
Milgram is currently the only female in the
country coaching a men's fencing program. She led
Penn State to the NCAA championship in 1990
while an undergrad competing in foil. Pogosov was
a silver medalist in die 1988 Olympic Games and a
gold medalist in the 1992 Games, while Kuznetsov
was a five-time Ukranian national champion.
This year should prove promis
ing, because, in addition to this
knowledgeable coaching staff, the
team will welcome highly-touted
freshman Aileen Maloney as well
as transfer student Eva
Petschnigg, who was a 2000 NCAA
individual champion while repre
senting Princeton.
"We have some outstanding
fencers," Milgram said. "We also
have a nice recruit [Maloney] who
we are hoping to get some great
results out of."

Additionally, junior Iris Zim
merman fenced for the United
States in the 2000 Summer
Olympics, and is one of the pre
mier amateur fencers in the coun
try. She captured the gold medal
in the women's foil competition at
the 2001 NCAA Championships,
and was the highest-placing Stan
ford woman in the 2002 NCAA
championships with a seventh
place finish in foil.
Zimmerman was named a sec
ond team Ail-American along with
teammates Mulholland and junior
Meghan Everett, while sopho
more Steve Gerberman earned
first team All-America recognition.
However, despite these impres

sive accolades for Stanford team
members, their success this year is
not guaranteed.
"We have a very fresh team this
year," Milgram said, indicating that
at the start of the school year, Stan
lord lacked a 112 ull women's team. Stu
dents tried out, though, and a lew
women were selected to be trained
as future fencers for the team.
Fencers may compete with one
of three different weapons: foil,
epee and saber, although until
1989, women could only compete
with foil. Women's sabre has been
permitted in the NCAA for only
three years. Team members gen
erally choose to specialize in the
use of one particular weapon.
