# Fencing readies for new season
## Little-known varsity team shines on national stage 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford students are not even aware that
the University has a fencing team, let alone that the
varsity team qualifies each year for the NCAA
championships and has an Olympian on it.
Stanford fencing is a national powerhouse and a
perennial contender for the Western Regional
championship.
Stanford has both a men's and a women's team,
with the two teams' scores pooled in order to de
termine overall team placement. Fencing has a

combined championship, meaning that both teams
depend on each other. To foster the necessary
unity, Stanford's teams practice together and trav
el together, although the competitions themselves
are separated by gender.
The team is led by head coach Lisa Milgram, as
sistant coaches George Pogosov and Alex Kuznetsov
and team captain junior Mark Mulholland.
Milgram is currently the only female in the
country coaching a men's fencing program. She led
Penn State to the NCAA championship in 1990
while an undergrad competing in foil. Pogosov was
a silver medalist in die 1988 Olympic Games and a
gold medalist in the 1992 Games, while Kuznetsov
was a five-time Ukranian national champion.
