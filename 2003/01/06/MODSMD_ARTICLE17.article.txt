# NFL last week good; school bad
## 
### 
Every year right around
this time, I sit back and
gather myself into my
pseudo-relaxed yet still
uptight sitting position that I re
serve exclusively for moments of
self-reflection, and I look back on
the grotesquely obscene amount
of money I have poured into my
Stanford education. And every
year I am horrified by one
thought: despite three and a half
years of top-notch education, over
$ 100,000 in fees and countless late
nights, the fact still remains that
the only thing I really want to do
in life is sit on my ever-expanding
ass and watch football all day.
I can say with minimal
shame that I tuned in for al
most every single minute of
every single NFL football game
broadcast in my area. Even
Cowboys-Redskins, you ask?
Yes, even that sinkhole of ath
letic competition, although I
did have to have vomit bag and
eye gouger in hand. The only
thing that saved it was the fact
that I could flip back and forth
between that game and the Pa
triots-Dolphins game, which if
you missed it was without ques
tion the greatest come-from-be
hind-after-being-bullwhipped-
for-50-minutes-to-win-the-
ga me-in-overt i me-victory-to
keep-your-playoff-hopes-alive-
while-severely-damaging-the-
hopes-of-the-other-team-only-
to-end-up-missing-the-play-
offs-anyway-because-the-Jets-
pounded-the-Packers game of
all time.
So why is it that I feel justified
spending my precious free time
holed up in front of a television
set with nachos and beer all day?
Well, first and foremost, that
would be a pretty sweet life if you
could make a living out of it
(Roger Ebert, I'm looking in
your direction). But alcohol and
junk food aside, the great thing
about the NFL is that every single
regular-season game counts.
(Here is where I would normally
insert a Bengals joke, but even
they count for something. If you

don't believe me, just ask the
Saints). Every snap of the football
can carry the fortunes of an en
tire season, with glory, honor
and assloads of cash hanging in
the balance. Thirty-two teams
vying for 12 playoff spots.
While I thoroughly enjoy
watching NBA games, I'm not
the slightest bit upset if I happen

to miss a game
here and there
because any de
cent team is
going to make
the playoffs any
way. The NBA
hands out play
off spots like R.
Kelly hands out

lollipops to little girls. Any team
even remotely talented gets in
(which makes it all the more hi
larious that the Lakers might be
on the outside looking in come
crunch time). And once the play
offs begin, there is minimal
chance for an upset because each
round consists of five- or seven
game series, and few lower-seed
ed teams can pull off wins against
superior teams that many times.
As for the baseball season, let's
just be honest. I can't even bring
myself to watch programs that
are actually entertaining 162
times a year, let alone slow, bor
ing baseball games. I'm all for
going to the stadium, grabbing a
dog and chilling at the ballpark,
but someone please shoot me if I
tune in for more than two in
nings of a regular-season baseball
game. (The movie "BASEket
ball"does a great spoof on the
length of the baseball season, and
it was about 300 times more en
tertaining than any regular-sea
son baseball game. One of the
greatest sports movies of all time,
I highly recommend seeing it. It
had my favorite Bob Costas
quote ever, said to colleague A1
Michaels, no less: "You're excit
ed?! Feel these nipples!!")
As for hockey . . . nah, let's
move on. This isn't Canada,
though in all fairness to hockey,
I would much rather watch a

regular-season hockey game
than the great American pas
time. I can't truly hate any sport
in which people get bludgeoned
repeatedly with sticks and flying
rubber objects.
For all of the hard work 1 put
in this winter break in front of my
television set, I'm proud to say
that it all paid off in the end, in
the form of an extremely exciting
playoff race. There were so many
possible playoff combinations
through the very last week that
Rain Man would have had a
heart attack trying to figure it
out. But when all was said and
done, there was no shortage of
big surprises.
Last year's Super Bowl com
batants, the Rams and the Patri
ots, will be watching from home.
The Chargers fell off the face of
the Earth, while the Jets and Gi
ants rose from the ashes and will
be playing in January. The Dol
phins pulled one of the greatest
chokes of all time, only to be out
done by the Saints. New Orleans
needed only one win in three
weeks against one of three teams
with a combined record of 10
wins and holy-crap-we-suck loss
es and still couldn't get it done.
And the Browns still haven't got
ten rid of those mind-bogglingly
awful uniforms, but they made
the playoffs too.
Coming off of a year domi
nated by criminal stories — cor
porate scandals, priesthood
scandals, acts of terror — it's
only fitting that this year's Lom
bardi Trophy will come to rest
with a team that has a built-in
courthouse in it's stadium for
quick processing and trial of
rowdy fans. The Philadelphia
Eagles will defeat the Oakland
Raiders 27-24 in this year's
Super Bowl.

nights, the fact still remains that
the only thing I really want to do
in life is sit on my ever-expanding
ass and watch football all day.
I can say with minimal
shame that I tuned in for al
most every single minute of
every single NFL football game
broadcast in my area. Even
Cowboys-Redskins, you ask?
Yes, even that sinkhole of ath
letic competition, although I
did have to have vomit bag and
eye gouger in hand. The only
thing that saved it was the fact
that I could flip back and forth
between that game and the Pa
triots-Dolphins game, which if
you missed it was without ques
tion the greatest come-from-be
hind-after-being-bullwhipped-
for-50-minutes-to-win-the-
ga me-in-overt i me-victory-to
keep-your-playoff-hopes-alive-
while-severely-damaging-the-
hopes-of-the-other-team-only-
to-end-up-missing-the-play-
offs-anyway-because-the-Jets-
pounded-the-Packers game of
all time.
So why is it that I feel justified
spending my precious free time
holed up in front of a television
set with nachos and beer all day?
Well, first and foremost, that
would be a pretty sweet life if you
could make a living out of it
(Roger Ebert, I'm looking in
your direction). But alcohol and
junk food aside, the great thing
about the NFL is that every single
regular-season game counts.
(Here is where I would normally
insert a Bengals joke, but even
they count for something. If you

don't believe me, just ask the
Saints). Every snap of the football
can carry the fortunes of an en
tire season, with glory, honor
and assloads of cash hanging in
the balance. Thirty-two teams
vying for 12 playoff spots.
While I thoroughly enjoy
watching NBA games, I'm not
the slightest bit upset if I happen

to miss a game
here and there
because any de
cent team is
going to make
the playoffs any
way. The NBA
hands out play
off spots like R.
Kelly hands out

lollipops to little girls. Any team
even remotely talented gets in
(which makes it all the more hi
larious that the Lakers might be
on the outside looking in come
crunch time). And once the play
offs begin, there is minimal
chance for an upset because each
round consists of five- or seven
game series, and few lower-seed
ed teams can pull off wins against
superior teams that many times.
As for the baseball season, let's
just be honest. I can't even bring
myself to watch programs that
are actually entertaining 162
times a year, let alone slow, bor
ing baseball games. I'm all for
going to the stadium, grabbing a
dog and chilling at the ballpark,
but someone please shoot me if I
tune in for more than two in
nings of a regular-season baseball
game. (The movie "BASEket
ball"does a great spoof on the
length of the baseball season, and
it was about 300 times more en
tertaining than any regular-sea
son baseball game. One of the
greatest sports movies of all time,
I highly recommend seeing it. It
had my favorite Bob Costas
quote ever, said to colleague A1
Michaels, no less: "You're excit
ed?! Feel these nipples!!")
As for hockey . . . nah, let's
move on. This isn't Canada,
though in all fairness to hockey,
I would much rather watch a

regular-season hockey game
than the great American pas
time. I can't truly hate any sport
in which people get bludgeoned
repeatedly with sticks and flying
rubber objects.
For all of the hard work 1 put
in this winter break in front of my
television set, I'm proud to say
that it all paid off in the end, in
the form of an extremely exciting
playoff race. There were so many
possible playoff combinations
through the very last week that
Rain Man would have had a
heart attack trying to figure it
out. But when all was said and
done, there was no shortage of
big surprises.
Last year's Super Bowl com
batants, the Rams and the Patri
ots, will be watching from home.
The Chargers fell off the face of
the Earth, while the Jets and Gi
ants rose from the ashes and will
be playing in January. The Dol
phins pulled one of the greatest
chokes of all time, only to be out
done by the Saints. New Orleans
needed only one win in three
weeks against one of three teams
with a combined record of 10
wins and holy-crap-we-suck loss
es and still couldn't get it done.
And the Browns still haven't got
ten rid of those mind-bogglingly
awful uniforms, but they made
the playoffs too.
Coming off of a year domi
nated by criminal stories — cor
porate scandals, priesthood
scandals, acts of terror — it's
only fitting that this year's Lom
bardi Trophy will come to rest
with a team that has a built-in
courthouse in it's stadium for
quick processing and trial of
rowdy fans. The Philadelphia
Eagles will defeat the Oakland
Raiders 27-24 in this year's
Super Bowl.

Every year right around
this time, I sit back and
gather myself into my
pseudo-relaxed yet still
uptight sitting position that I re
serve exclusively for moments of
self-reflection, and I look back on
the grotesquely obscene amount
of money I have poured into my
Stanford education. And every
year I am horrified by one
thought: despite three and a half
years of top-notch education, over
$ 100,000 in fees and countless late
nights, the fact still remains that
the only thing I really want to do
in life is sit on my ever-expanding
ass and watch football all day.
