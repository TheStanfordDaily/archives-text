# Glielmi takes helm of men's gymnastics
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite having the smallest gymnastics
team in the country, Thom Glielmi sees his
program growing in the next few years.
In his first season as head coach for the
Stanford men's gymnastics team, Glielmi
replaces long-time coach Sadao Hamada,
who led Stanford for 30 seasons. Hamada
is now Glielmi's assistant coach.
Glielmi came to Stanford last year after
helping bring Minnesota gymnastics back
to national prominence and coaching
John Roethlisberger at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. In his first season as assistant
coach, the Cardinal came surprisingly
close to a national title.
"I was glad to have the opportunity to
work under Sadao. His track record
speaks for itself, and he's still one of the
best technical coaches in the country,"
Glielmi said. "It was good to see what he
does and use his methods that fit with the
training regime I have in mind."
Losing five seniors from last year's al
ready small squad, this year's team is com
posed of 10 gymnasts, including defend
ing NCAA champions senior Marshall
Erwin on rings and junior Dan Gill on
vault. The Cardinal gained two freshmen,
but also lost sophomores Daniel Torres-
Rangel to back injury and Bryan McCol
gan to wrist surgery in the preseason.

"Most traveling teams have 13 or 14
guys. The rules allow up to 12 gymnasts
in competition," Glielmi said. "The loss
of Bryan McColgan will affect us â€” he's
one of the top performers on floor, vault

and rings."
He added that a small
team does not change the
training program.
"Our goal is to win the
NCAA Championships,
but it is hard to gauge
where we stand until
after a few meets," he
said. "We have the de
fending ring and vault

champions and the goal is for them to re
peat. Anyone who has a routine with a 10.0
start value is a serious contender for an in
dividual title."
Though Stanford boasts several 10.0
difficulty routines, Glielmi said most guys
will start with easier routines and upgrade
them throughout the season.
"It is important that they are comfort
able with their routine and that they learn
to compete with confidence," Glielmi said.
"If the routine is minimal without much
difficulty, that's OK. There's no timeline to
upgrade the routines."
There are minor rule changes that af
fected several gymnasts, but Glielmi noted
that every team is equally affected. For ex
ample, the emphasis of NCAA champion

Erwin's ring routine changed from a
never-ending display of strength to per
fect execution.
"So he'll still be scoring 9.8 and above,"
Glielmi said.
With only 20 varsity gymnastics teams
left in the country, Glielmi finds himself
immersed in a national debate about op
portunity in college sports.
"As far as men's gymnastics programs
dropped, it comes down to opportunities
for our kids," he said. "I think it is impor
tant to have student-athletes in more than
just one or two sports."
Unlike many of his coaching counter
parts, Glielmi thinks the situation isn't
hopeless.
"If any university in Texas or Florida
started a men's gymnastics program,
they'd have a national championship in
two years, because they are such hotbeds
of recruiting," Glielmi said.
Is the problem out of his hands?
"The responsibility of the program
being well-received by the university, ath
letic department and community lies on
the coach and athletes," Glielmi ex
plained. "For example, our program has
one of the highest GPAs in the Athletic De
partment, and I know this is usually the
case for men's gymnastics programs at
their respective universities."
Ranked ninth in the preseason poll,
the Cardinal will kick off the season with

Stanford's first annual Alumni Meet this
Saturday.
"It is actually an exhibition for the var
sity and a time for the alumni to come
back and relive their glory days," Glielmi
explained. "It should be a lot of fun and
we expect it to grown in the next few
years."
The alumni team will feature distin
guished Stanford gymnasts, including the

1986 N(L\A Ail-Around Champion Jon
Louis and All-Americans Scott Finkelstein
and David Durante.
"I'm looking forward to an exciting
year and we hope that we get a lot of peo
ple to come check us out," Glielmi said.
"These are some of the top athletes in the
world who make skills that require an in
credible amount strength, flexibility and
kinesthetic awareness look simple."
