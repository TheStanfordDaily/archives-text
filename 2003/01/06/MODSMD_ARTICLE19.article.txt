Seven All-American awards. Nine se
lections to the Pacific-10 All-Conference
team. Five Academic Ail-Americans. One
former Olympian. Two Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year winners. One Pac-10 team
championship. Stanford's first trip in pro
gram history to the NCAA Super Six.
This is a tall list of accomplishments for
a group of 12 women whose average
height is 5-foot-3.
Meet the 2003 Stanford women's gym
nastics team.

Smyth said.
After last year's breakthrough season
during Smyth's first year at the helm, the
Cardinal's last day in 2003 may well be
capped with its first national title.
The road to an NCAA, championship
isn't without obstacles. Hy virtue of being
a member of the Pac-10, Stanford will be
tested with a demanding schedule.
But the Cardinal is ready to square off
with any squad in the country.
"Our home schedule is really excit

ing," senior Kelsey Stillinger said. "Every
meet will feature a team ranked in the top
15 nationally. Our away meets should be
great preparation for the postseason."
The team has been gearing up for this
year's schedule since last season ended.
"I was amazed with how last year's
Super Six berth lit a fire underneath our
returning athletes," Smyth said. " They
trained relentlessly this summer so we
could upgrade our gymnastics and skill
selection in the preseason.
The Cardinal returns nine to the 2003
squad, and signed on freshmen Natalie
Foley, Jessica Louie and Glyn Sweets â€”
