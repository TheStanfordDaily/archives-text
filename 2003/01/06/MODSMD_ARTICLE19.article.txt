Seven All-American awards. Nine se
lections to the Pacific-10 All-Conference
team. Five Academic Ail-Americans. One
former Olympian. Two Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year winners. One Pac-10 team
championship. Stanford's first trip in pro
gram history to the NCAA Super Six.
This is a tall list of accomplishments for
a group of 12 women whose average
height is 5-foot-3.
Meet the 2003 Stanford women's gym
nastics team.

Smyth said.
After last year's breakthrough season
during Smyth's first year at the helm, the
Cardinal's last day in 2003 may well be
capped with its first national title.
The road to an NCAA, championship
isn't without obstacles. Hy virtue of being
a member of the Pac-10, Stanford will be
tested with a demanding schedule.
But the Cardinal is ready to square off
with any squad in the country.
"Our home schedule is really excit

ing," senior Kelsey Stillinger said. "Every
meet will feature a team ranked in the top
15 nationally. Our away meets should be
great preparation for the postseason."
The team has been gearing up for this
year's schedule since last season ended.
"I was amazed with how last year's
Super Six berth lit a fire underneath our
returning athletes," Smyth said. " They
trained relentlessly this summer so we
could upgrade our gymnastics and skill
selection in the preseason.
The Cardinal returns nine to the 2003
squad, and signed on freshmen Natalie

arguably the nation's top recruit
ing class last year.
"Our freshmen each have a
unique style and entertaining per
sonality, junior Caroline Fluhrer
said. ' They're great competitors
and add a lot to our team."
The freshman class brings both
solid technique and top-notch
artistry to the Farm.
"Natalie's bar routine is one of
the toughest in the country,"
Smyth said. "Combined with
Glyn's beautiful lines and Jessica's
vaulting and tumbling, they help
us fill in the places where we need
ed help last year."
I he perpetual challenge for
Stanford will be staying healthy as
i he season's tempo increases, espe
cially during the back-to-back
nights of the NCAA Champi
onships.
"Competing every week and
then wanting to showcase your
best performances two nights in a
row at NCAAsisa huge challenge,"
Smyth said.
This year's team has achieved

great depth in lineups on each
event, which will be a source of
jealousy lor competitors as the sea
son progresses.
"We want to keep everyone
healthy so we can all compete on
the last day of the season," said ju
nior Use Leveille.
On vault, junior Kendall Beck is
expected to build on her explosive
sophomore campaign, during
which she was Stanford's most con
sistent van Iter and garnered first
team All-America honors in the
process.
Sophomore Mandy Delgado,
Leveille and Fluhrer will reinforce
Beck's efforts. Delgado, the 2002
Co-Pac-10 Freshman of Year, will
be executing one of the most im
pressive vaults in the country. De
spite suffering a midseason injury
in 2002, Fluhrer delivered an
ama/ing vault the first night of
NCAAs to propel Stanford to the
Super Six.
Leveille has been specifically
working to improve her vaulting
ability and will add invaluable
depth to the lineup.
Vault will be a particularly in
teresting event to watch, due to the
introduction of a new vaulting
horse at the collegiate level, llav

ingalready competed with the new
version of the apparatus in club
competition, the three freshmen
will make an immediate impact 011
the event.
Fluhrer, 2002 Regional bars
champion, and Foley, a 2001
World Championship team
member, will anchor Stanford on
uneven bars. After losing four of
the bar workers from last year's
team, the Cardinal has been able
to pull together a dangerous line
up with excellent technique and
big dismounts. Senior Alissa
Cooper — Stanford's most con
sistent gymnast 011 bars as a fresh
man along with then-senior and
current assistant coach Larissa
Fontaine — is expected to step up
in this event as well.
Fhe Cardinal may very well be
unparalleled on the balance beam,
boasting 2002 Pac-10 Co-Champi
ons, 2002 Regional Co-Champi
ons and three first team All-Amer
ica honors between beam phe
noms Leveille and junior Lindsay
Wing.
Wing snagged All-America sta
tus during both her freshman and
sophomore campaigns, placing
second on beam at the NCAA
Championships in her outstand

ing rookie season.
Taking into account Heck,
Flubier, sophomore Maria
Ranieri and Stillinger — a former
Junior Olympic National Beam
Champion — Stanford's consis
tency and expertise on beam is the
envy of many rivals.
Tumbling at Stanford has also
reached a new level, resulting in a
show-stopping set of routines on
the floor exercise. Leveille, a mem
ber of the 2000 Canadian Olympic
team before her arrival on the
Farm, hopes to add to her multiple
All-America honors in this event,
and will be aided by many team
mates, including junior Shelly
Goldberg, a fixture on vault and
floor for the Cardinal.
Foley, Fluhrer, Leveille and
Wing will pack a powerful punch
in the all-around competition as
well, drawing on their superlative
technique and consistency on each
event to squelch the competition.
But other team members are also
training for the all-around, and
fans can expect lineups to vary.

this year that we haven't had be

noms Leveille and junior Lindsay
Wing.
Wing snagged All-America sta
tus during both her freshman and
sophomore campaigns, placing
second on beam at the NCAA
Championships in her outstand

ing rookie season.
Taking into account Heck,
Flubier, sophomore Maria
Ranieri and Stillinger — a former
Junior Olympic National Beam
Champion — Stanford's consis
tency and expertise on beam is the
envy of many rivals.
Tumbling at Stanford has also
reached a new level, resulting in a
show-stopping set of routines on
the floor exercise. Leveille, a mem
ber of the 2000 Canadian Olympic
team before her arrival on the
Farm, hopes to add to her multiple
All-America honors in this event,
and will be aided by many team
mates, including junior Shelly
Goldberg, a fixture on vault and
floor for the Cardinal.
Foley, Fluhrer, Leveille and
Wing will pack a powerful punch
in the all-around competition as
well, drawing on their superlative
technique and consistency on each
event to squelch the competition.
But other team members are also
training for the all-around, and
fans can expect lineups to vary.

Smyth said.
After last year's breakthrough season
during Smyth's first year at the helm, the
Cardinal's last day in 2003 may well be
capped with its first national title.
The road to an NCAA, championship
isn't without obstacles. Hy virtue of being
a member of the Pac-10, Stanford will be
tested with a demanding schedule.
But the Cardinal is ready to square off
with any squad in the country.
"Our home schedule is really excit

ing," senior Kelsey Stillinger said. "Every
meet will feature a team ranked in the top
15 nationally. Our away meets should be
great preparation for the postseason."
The team has been gearing up for this
year's schedule since last season ended.
"I was amazed with how last year's
Super Six berth lit a fire underneath our
returning athletes," Smyth said. " They
trained relentlessly this summer so we
could upgrade our gymnastics and skill
selection in the preseason.
The Cardinal returns nine to the 2003
squad, and signed on freshmen Natalie
Foley, Jessica Louie and Glyn Sweets —

arguably the nation's top recruit
ing class last year.
"Our freshmen each have a
unique style and entertaining per
sonality, junior Caroline Fluhrer
said. ' They're great competitors
and add a lot to our team."
The freshman class brings both
solid technique and top-notch
artistry to the Farm.
"Natalie's bar routine is one of
the toughest in the country,"
Smyth said. "Combined with
Glyn's beautiful lines and Jessica's
vaulting and tumbling, they help
us fill in the places where we need
ed help last year."
I he perpetual challenge for
Stanford will be staying healthy as
i he season's tempo increases, espe
cially during the back-to-back
nights of the NCAA Champi
onships.
"Competing every week and
then wanting to showcase your
best performances two nights in a
row at NCAAsisa huge challenge,"
Smyth said.
This year's team has achieved

great depth in lineups on each
event, which will be a source of
jealousy lor competitors as the sea
son progresses.
"We want to keep everyone
healthy so we can all compete on
the last day of the season," said ju
nior Use Leveille.
On vault, junior Kendall Beck is
expected to build on her explosive
sophomore campaign, during
which she was Stanford's most con
sistent van Iter and garnered first
team All-America honors in the
process.
Sophomore Mandy Delgado,
Leveille and Fluhrer will reinforce
Beck's efforts. Delgado, the 2002
Co-Pac-10 Freshman of Year, will
be executing one of the most im
pressive vaults in the country. De
spite suffering a midseason injury
in 2002, Fluhrer delivered an
ama/ing vault the first night of
NCAAs to propel Stanford to the
Super Six.
Leveille has been specifically
working to improve her vaulting
ability and will add invaluable
depth to the lineup.
Vault will be a particularly in
teresting event to watch, due to the
introduction of a new vaulting
horse at the collegiate level, llav

ingalready competed with the new
version of the apparatus in club
competition, the three freshmen
will make an immediate impact 011
the event.
Fluhrer, 2002 Regional bars
champion, and Foley, a 2001
World Championship team
member, will anchor Stanford on
uneven bars. After losing four of
the bar workers from last year's
team, the Cardinal has been able
to pull together a dangerous line
up with excellent technique and
big dismounts. Senior Alissa
Cooper — Stanford's most con
sistent gymnast 011 bars as a fresh
man along with then-senior and
current assistant coach Larissa
Fontaine — is expected to step up
in this event as well.
Fhe Cardinal may very well be
unparalleled on the balance beam,
