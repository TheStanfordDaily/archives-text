# Buckeyes party after Fiesta win

### 
TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Two
nerve-racking overtimes and a de
layed officials' call were hardly too
long to endure fora team waiting
34 years for another national title.
Showing patience and poise of
a champion, Ohio State outlasted
Miami in one college football's
greatest games, beating the Hur
ricanes 31-24 Friday night in the
Fiesta Bowl.
"There were a lot of great
plays," Ohio State coach Jim Tres
sel said Saturday. "We'll all be able
to sit and talk about which one
turned the tide."
On Friday, the Buckeyes need
ed many plays to derail the Hurri
canes' run for back-to-back nation
al titles and snap their 34-game
winning streak.
Craig Krenzel engineered two
touchdown drives in overtime —
with help from a delayed penalty
— and the relentless Ohio State
defense came up with a goal-line
stand in this shocking, thrilling
season-ender.
The confident 'Canes rushed
onto the field atone point thinking
they had won, only to learn that a
pass-interference call game the
Buckeyes another chance in the
first overtime.
Krenzel tied the game with his
second touchdown and freshman
Maurice Clarett scored on a 5-yard
run in the second overtime to give
the second-ranked Buckeyes (14-
0) the win over No. 1 Miami (12-1).
Ohio State was an 11 1/2 -point un
derdog.
"It's no different than what
we've done all year," Krenzel said.
"We make plays in the big
games when we have to."
Ohio State's All-American safe
ty Mike Doss said, "At least once a
week we have one play where it's
the last play in the world and it

means everything. We stepped up
to the challenge."
Miami's Todd Sievers sent the
game into overtime with his 40-
yard field goal on the final play of
the fourth quarter.
The Buckeyes' punishing de
fense rattled and pounded Miami
quarterback Ken Dorsey all night.
And on the last play of the game,
on fourth-and-goal at the 1, Cie
Grant blitzed and forced Dorsey to
heave a desperation pass that line
backer Matt Wilhelm batted to the
ground.
"It hurts. Losing hurts," Dorsey
said. "For me, it hurts even more.
Thinking back to what this team
has done. I should have made
some of those throws, and I take
responsibility for that."
While Miami coach Larry
Coker lost for the first time in 25
games, Tressel has a major college
title to add to the four he won in
Division I-AA at Youngstown
State.
Nine times since Woody Hayes
coached the Buckeyes to the 1968
title, Ohio State lost a late-season
game that cost it a possible cham
pionship. But the Buckeyes finally
brought the title back to Columbus
with a conservative offense and
fierce defense that Hayes would
have loved.
The fantastic finish was nothing
new for Ohio State this season.
The Buckeyes won six games by
seven points or fewer.
After Kellen Winslow Jr.'s 7-
yard TD catch gave Miami a 24-17
lead in the first overtime, Krenzel
converted a fourth-and-14 pass.
The Buckeyes then faced a
fourth-and-3 at the 5 when Kren
zel threw to the right corner of the
end zone for Chris Gamble, who
