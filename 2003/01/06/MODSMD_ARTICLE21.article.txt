# Buckeyes party after Fiesta win
## 
### 
TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Two
nerve-racking overtimes and a de
layed officials' call were hardly too
long to endure fora team waiting
34 years for another national title.
Showing patience and poise of
a champion, Ohio State outlasted
Miami in one college football's
greatest games, beating the Hur
ricanes 31-24 Friday night in the
Fiesta Bowl.
"There were a lot of great
plays," Ohio State coach Jim Tres
sel said Saturday. "We'll all be able
to sit and talk about which one
turned the tide."
On Friday, the Buckeyes need
ed many plays to derail the Hurri
canes' run for back-to-back nation
al titles and snap their 34-game
winning streak.
Craig Krenzel engineered two
touchdown drives in overtime —
with help from a delayed penalty
— and the relentless Ohio State
defense came up with a goal-line
stand in this shocking, thrilling
season-ender.
The confident 'Canes rushed
onto the field atone point thinking
they had won, only to learn that a
pass-interference call game the
Buckeyes another chance in the
first overtime.
Krenzel tied the game with his
second touchdown and freshman
Maurice Clarett scored on a 5-yard
run in the second overtime to give
the second-ranked Buckeyes (14-
0) the win over No. 1 Miami (12-1).
Ohio State was an 11 1/2 -point un
derdog.
"It's no different than what
we've done all year," Krenzel said.
"We make plays in the big
games when we have to."
Ohio State's All-American safe
ty Mike Doss said, "At least once a
week we have one play where it's
the last play in the world and it

means everything. We stepped up
to the challenge."
Miami's Todd Sievers sent the
game into overtime with his 40-
yard field goal on the final play of
the fourth quarter.
The Buckeyes' punishing de
fense rattled and pounded Miami
quarterback Ken Dorsey all night.
And on the last play of the game,
on fourth-and-goal at the 1, Cie
Grant blitzed and forced Dorsey to
heave a desperation pass that line
backer Matt Wilhelm batted to the
ground.
"It hurts. Losing hurts," Dorsey
said. "For me, it hurts even more.
Thinking back to what this team
has done. I should have made
some of those throws, and I take
responsibility for that."
While Miami coach Larry
Coker lost for the first time in 25
games, Tressel has a major college
title to add to the four he won in
Division I-AA at Youngstown
State.
Nine times since Woody Hayes
coached the Buckeyes to the 1968
title, Ohio State lost a late-season
game that cost it a possible cham
pionship. But the Buckeyes finally
brought the title back to Columbus
with a conservative offense and
fierce defense that Hayes would
have loved.
The fantastic finish was nothing
new for Ohio State this season.
The Buckeyes won six games by
seven points or fewer.
After Kellen Winslow Jr.'s 7-
yard TD catch gave Miami a 24-17
lead in the first overtime, Krenzel
converted a fourth-and-14 pass.
The Buckeyes then faced a
fourth-and-3 at the 5 when Kren
zel threw to the right corner of the
end zone for Chris Gamble, who
was being covered Glenn Sharpe.
As Gamble reached back for the
ball, he got his hands on it but
couldn't hold on. Seconds later,
field judge Terry Porter threw a
llag from the back of the end /one
indicating pass interference even
as Miami players and fans spilled
onto the field.
"He was holding me. He was in
my facemask and my shoulder
pads," Gamble said. "I was waiting
for the flag, but he kind of hesitat
ed. I didn't see him going for the
flag and I thought, 'He ain't going
to throw it.' Luckily, he did, and
I'm like, 'Whew.'"
Porter said: "I saw the guy
holding the guy prior to the ball
being in the air. 1 le was still hold
ing him, pulling him down while
the ball was in the air."
Order was restored quickly,
and three plays later Krenzel
scored from the 1 to send the
game to a second OT.
Dorsey, a Heisman Trophy fi
nalist, finished off his career with
just his second loss in 40 starts.
Willis McGahee, the Hurricanes'
other
Heisman finalist, left early in
the fourth quarter with an injured
left knee.
The Associated Press poll of
writers and broadcasters was re

leased early Saturday with the
Buckeyes No. 1. They also were
the champions of the USA
Today/ESPN coaches' poll,
which automatically goes to the
Fiesta winner, this season's desig
nated Bowl Championship Se
ries title game.
Ohio State led 14-7 at the half,
and extended the margin to 10
points on Mike Nugent's 44-yard
field goal. The 'Canes closed to
17-14 on McGahee's 9-yard scor
ing run with 2:11 left in the third
quarter. And that set the stage for
Sievers' kick, leaving the Sun
Devil Stadium crowd of 77,502
breathless.
The Buckeyes' ferocious de
fense had Dorsey in trouble from
the opening series with two sacks.
Although Ohio State fell be
hind 7-0 on Dorsey's 25-yard pass
to Roscoe Parrish, the constant
pressure paid huge dividends in
the second quarter as the Buck
eyes took a 14-7 halftime lead,
turning two turnovers into touch
downs in a 78-second span.
After an interception by Doss,
Krenzel tied it with a fourth
down run from the 1 with 2:28
left in the half.
On the next play from scrim
mage, Dorsey dropped back to
pass, but defensive tackle Kenny
Peterson came around from the
right side and spun him to the
ground as the ball came loose.
Darrion Scott recovered at the
Miami 14.
