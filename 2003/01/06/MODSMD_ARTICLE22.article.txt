# Sinclair brings home first title for Portland
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” Christine Sinclair
looked at the rain and soggy field and liked
Portland's chances of winning its first national
championship.
Put shots on goal, she said, and something's
bound to go in. Sinclair scored twice on Dec. 8,
sending the Pilots to a 2-1 victory over Santa
(Mara with a goal in sudden-death overtime in
the NCAA Women's College Cup final.
"As an attacker, you like it," Sinclair said of
the slick field. "Anything on net, keep it low and
it could have a chance."
A Canadian national team player, Sinclair
tied the game at 1-1 with a goal in the 61st
minute of regulation. The game winner came
when she put back a rebound of her own shot
in the second overtime period.
It was Sinclair's 26th goal of the season and
her l()th of the NCAA tournament. She was
named the tournament's most valuable offen
sive player.
Devvyn Hawkins scored for Santa Clara,
which won the 2001 national title.
It was just the third final to go to overtime.
Portland lost to Notre Dame 1-0 in triple over
time in 1995.
"I was breathless," said Portland coach Clive
Charles, who lost the 1995 final and hadn't
made it there again until this year.
The Pilots (20-4-2) won their first national

title and are the lowest seed (No. 8) to win a
championship.
"It was a 10-ton weight off our shoulders,"
Charles said of the winning goal. "1 was dread
ing penalty kicks."
That's because senior goalkeeper Lauren
Arase left the game after getting kneed in the
head with four minutes left in the first over
time.
Santa Clara had forced Arase to make
three difficult saves and appeared to have the
momentum when Arase went out. Portland
put in freshman Kim Head, who had played
just 25 minutes and faced just one shot all
season.
But Sinclair ended any drama with the
game-winning goal.
Defender Kristin Moore started a run up the
left side and sent a low cross into the box where
Sinclair who was able to flick it on goal. Santa
Clara goalkeeper Alyssa Sobolik stayed on her
line and made the block. Hut the ball bounced
off her chest, hit the right post and bounced
back to Sinclair, who calmly put it into the net.
"It was a perfect cross," Sinclair said.
"We had the right person on the end of it,"
Charles said.
Santa Clara missed its chance to be the only
team other than North Carolina to win back-to
back titles.

"A game this tight, it's a matter of inches,"
Santa Clara coach Jerry Smith said. "The beau
ty of a player like Sinclair, she disappears from
a game fora while and then finds a way to get
her one or two goals."
Santa Clara (20-5-1) and Portland are
West Coast Conference rivals. The Broncos
beat Portland 1-0 in their only other meeting
this season. Sinclair missed that game be
cause she was playing with the Canadian na
tional team.
The first half was scoreless as both teams
worked to find their touch under a steady
drizzle.
Portland's defense, which hadn't given up a
goal in six games, finally cracked in the 53rd
minute when Hawkins finished a corner kick
with a volley past Arase.
Portland tied the game eight minutes later
when Sinclair scored on an unlikely shot aided
by the slick conditions.
Sinclair broke free down the left side and re
versed field before sending a low cross into the
box. The ball skipped on the wet grass and
curled around Sobolik, sliding just inside the
right post.
Sinclair set an NCAA tournament record
with 21 points on 10 goals and one assist. North
Carolina's Mia Hamm set the previous mark of
1(5 in 1993.
