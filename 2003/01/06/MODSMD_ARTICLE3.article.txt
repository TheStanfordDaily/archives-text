# Late goal lifts Bruins to NCAA soccer title
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
UCLA 1, Stanford 0.
This score has become so ago
nizingly routine that it might merit
some consideration as a new regu
lation to the NCAA men's soccer
rule book.
Two 1-0 losses to the Bruins
during the regular season took
much of the wind out of the Cardi
nal men's soccer team's sails. But
Stanford recovered with a magical
late-season run, winning six
straight to earn its second NCAA
championship game appearance
in five years.

season.
Adding to the heartbreak was
the fact that the game-winning
goal came only one minute before
the match was to enter overtime.
The contest was a defensive
struggle as both teams managed a
total of 10 shots between them. It
was scoreless until the 89th minute
when Bruin midfielder Ryan Futa
gaki served a restart cross into the
box where midfielder Aaron Lopez
was able to volley the ball past Stan
ford sophomore keeper Robby
Fulton, making UCIA this year's
NCAA men's soccer champions.
"Not the prettiest game these
guys have played or Fve coached,"
said UCIA coach Tom Fitzgerald.
"1 told them if it was ugly, we need
ed to win it."
During the season, the usually
potent Stanford offense hit a
nasty scoreless slump, but during
its run in the College Cup, the
Cardinal seemed to have redis
covered its scoring touch and,
more importantly, its will to win.
However, the ghosts of the past
made an uninvited visit at the
wrong time, as Stanford, despite
several solid chances, was once
again unable to convert when it
counted.
In the first half, the Cardinal
came close to scoring when senior
defender Taylor Graham used his
superior leaping ability to get a
head on a corner kick in the 7th
minute that easily beat UCIA
keeper Zach Wells. Rut Bruins
midfielder Jimmy Frazelle saved
the day with a goal-line clearance
to keep the game scoreless.
Adding to the frustration in the
first half was a Johanes Maliza goal
called off by a Roger Levesque
hand-ball in the box.
UCIA nearly took a 1-0 edge
heading into the half when Futa
gaki, the Bruins big playmaker in
the midfield, rifled a shot from 25
yards out just moments after en
tering the game for the first time.
Fulton didn't move an inch as the
ball whizzed past him and hit the
left post and bounced out to the
relief of the Cardinal fans in at
tendance.
Levesque struggled all day as
several other opportunities fell
by the wayside, and the senior
forward displayed some unchar
acteristic indecisiveness with the
ball deep in the UCLA end.
Levesque rarely had much help
up front, as Stanford coach Bret
Simon chose to keep most of his
team in the backfield on Cardinal
offensive drives.
The UCLA defenders swarmed
on Levesque on nearly every
touch, and the Bruin backline was
able to clear more than a few Stan
ford opportunities inside its box.

Simon was disappointed with
the squandered chances, but was
proud of the way his team played
overall.
"We had chances to win that
disappeared iti the blink of an
eye," Simon said. "I'm really
proud of the team. We gave it our
best effort against UCLA. I
thought both teams played great
on defense. UCLA bent but never
broke."
Despite a second-straight heart
breaking exit in the College Cup
(Stanford fell in four overtimes to
North Carolina in last year's na
tional semifinals), not many ex
pected the Cardinal to find itself to
contend for the NCAA title.
Stanford barely got by Portland
in penalty kicks in the second
round of the College Cup and
needed two overtimes to advance
past Furman in the round of 16.
With those wins — and early
round losses by two higher-seeded
teams — the ninth-seeded Cardi
nal found itself playing fora trip to
Dallas in front of a home crowd at
Maloney Field against Clemson.
The tension of the previous
matches was totally absent as Stan
ford was dominant and put the
game away with two goals in the
first half fora 2-0 victory. The Car
dinal's first goal was Levesque's
first score in a month and a half.
With its three hard-fought
home victories, Stanford flew to
Dallas for the College Cup brim
ming with confidence.
"This team has had more
hardship during the year than
last year's team," Simon said after
the Clemson match. "Last year's
team, we were right there from
the beginning, and we stayed
near the top of the heap for most
of the year. This year, even
though we started out with a high
ranking, we've been a work in
progress."
Stanford's semifinal matchup
was against Simon's previous
team, Creighton. Simon coached
for six years there before arriving
on the Farm, and he faced a roster
that included players he had re
cruited before leaving.
Again, Stanford was taken into
overtime, and the game seemed
destined for penalties as the sec
ond extra period winded down.
But with just over two minutes
to play, freshman defender Chad
Marshall headed a perfect cross
from junior midfielder Mike Wil
son into the back of the net to seal
a 2-1 Stanford win.
Marshall also had an assist on
Stanford's equalizing goal in the
50th minute. Marshall crossed a
ball that was tipped by senior
defender Todd Dunivant to
Levesque, who volleyed a shot
past Creighton goalie Mike
Gabb.
Creighton had taken an early 1-
0 lead on a penalty kick in the 15th
minute.

matches was totally absent as Stan
ford was dominant and put the
game away with two goals in the
first half fora 2-0 victory. The Car
dinal's first goal was Levesque's
first score in a month and a half.
With its three hard-fought
home victories, Stanford flew to
Dallas for the College Cup brim
ming with confidence.
"This team has had more
hardship during the year than
last year's team," Simon said after
the Clemson match. "Last year's
team, we were right there from
the beginning, and we stayed
near the top of the heap for most
of the year. This year, even
though we started out with a high
ranking, we've been a work in
progress."
Stanford's semifinal matchup
was against Simon's previous
team, Creighton. Simon coached
for six years there before arriving
on the Farm, and he faced a roster
that included players he had re
cruited before leaving.
Again, Stanford was taken into
overtime, and the game seemed
destined for penalties as the sec
ond extra period winded down.
But with just over two minutes
to play, freshman defender Chad
Marshall headed a perfect cross
from junior midfielder Mike Wil
son into the back of the net to seal
a 2-1 Stanford win.
Marshall also had an assist on
Stanford's equalizing goal in the
50th minute. Marshall crossed a
ball that was tipped by senior
defender Todd Dunivant to
Levesque, who volleyed a shot
past Creighton goalie Mike
Gabb.
Creighton had taken an early 1-
0 lead on a penalty kick in the 15th
minute.
UCLA 1, Stanford 0.

season.
Adding to the heartbreak was
the fact that the game-winning
goal came only one minute before
the match was to enter overtime.
The contest was a defensive
struggle as both teams managed a
total of 10 shots between them. It
was scoreless until the 89th minute
when Bruin midfielder Ryan Futa
gaki served a restart cross into the
box where midfielder Aaron Lopez
was able to volley the ball past Stan
ford sophomore keeper Robby
Fulton, making UCIA this year's
NCAA men's soccer champions.
"Not the prettiest game these
guys have played or Fve coached,"
said UCIA coach Tom Fitzgerald.
"1 told them if it was ugly, we need
ed to win it."
During the season, the usually
potent Stanford offense hit a
nasty scoreless slump, but during
its run in the College Cup, the
Cardinal seemed to have redis
covered its scoring touch and,
more importantly, its will to win.
However, the ghosts of the past
made an uninvited visit at the
wrong time, as Stanford, despite
several solid chances, was once
again unable to convert when it
counted.
In the first half, the Cardinal
came close to scoring when senior
defender Taylor Graham used his
superior leaping ability to get a
head on a corner kick in the 7th
minute that easily beat UCIA
keeper Zach Wells. Rut Bruins
midfielder Jimmy Frazelle saved
the day with a goal-line clearance
to keep the game scoreless.
Adding to the frustration in the
first half was a Johanes Maliza goal
called off by a Roger Levesque
hand-ball in the box.
UCIA nearly took a 1-0 edge
heading into the half when Futa
gaki, the Bruins big playmaker in
the midfield, rifled a shot from 25
yards out just moments after en
tering the game for the first time.
Fulton didn't move an inch as the
ball whizzed past him and hit the
left post and bounced out to the
relief of the Cardinal fans in at
tendance.
Levesque struggled all day as
several other opportunities fell
by the wayside, and the senior
forward displayed some unchar
acteristic indecisiveness with the
ball deep in the UCLA end.
Levesque rarely had much help
up front, as Stanford coach Bret
Simon chose to keep most of his
team in the backfield on Cardinal
offensive drives.
The UCLA defenders swarmed
on Levesque on nearly every
touch, and the Bruin backline was
able to clear more than a few Stan
ford opportunities inside its box.

Simon was disappointed with
the squandered chances, but was
proud of the way his team played
overall.
"We had chances to win that
disappeared iti the blink of an
eye," Simon said. "I'm really
proud of the team. We gave it our
best effort against UCLA. I
thought both teams played great
on defense. UCLA bent but never
broke."
Despite a second-straight heart
breaking exit in the College Cup
(Stanford fell in four overtimes to
North Carolina in last year's na
tional semifinals), not many ex
pected the Cardinal to find itself to
contend for the NCAA title.
Stanford barely got by Portland
in penalty kicks in the second
round of the College Cup and
needed two overtimes to advance
past Furman in the round of 16.
With those wins — and early
round losses by two higher-seeded
teams — the ninth-seeded Cardi
nal found itself playing fora trip to
Dallas in front of a home crowd at
Maloney Field against Clemson.
