# Volleyball falls to 'SC in final
## 
### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
NEW ORLEANS — Long before Stan
ford and Southern California reached the
NCAA tournament final on Dec. 21, there
was a general consensus in the collegiate vol
leyball community that the two were the na
tion's best teams in 2002.

Women's Volleyball
Dec. 21: No. 1 USC def. No. 2 Stanford 30-27,
23-30, 30-24, 30-26, NCAA Final

The NCAA coaches had either the
Women of Troy or the Cardinal at the top
spot in their rankings every week but one
during the season, and the NCAA selection
committee made the squads the top two
seeds for the championship tournament.
It was never certain, though, which of the
two Pacific-10 Conference powerhouses was
better. The two regular-season meetings be
tween them only suggested that if they
played 100 times, each squad would almost
certainly win 50 of the contests.
But on the one day that mattered most, in
the one match that decided it all, USC was
clearly better.
Behind a ferocious attack and a strong
service game, the Trojans (31-1) won their
first national title since 1981 by upending
the defending national champion Cardinal
(33-5) 3-1 in front of 6,451 at the New Or
leans Arena.
USC took full advantage of inconsistent

passing by the Cardinal, attacking from all
sides of the court to beat Stanford's usually
dominating blocking game.
Four Trojans finished with double-digit
kill totals. But it was Final Four MVP Keao
Burdine and Katie Olsovky's surge of attacks
out of the middle in the second half of the
match that did Stanford in. The two com
bined for 31 kills in the match, including 11
in the final game.
"They played with a lot of heart tonight,"
said Stanford coach John Dunning. "They
had a lot of weapons. It was impressive to
watch.
"I'm proud of our team. We had a great
year. We have to feel good about how we
hung in tough when things weren't going
well for us."
USC was able to slow senior outside hitter
Logan Tom for long stretches of the match,
holding her to just one kill in games one and
three and a .217 hitting percentage for the
match.
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani had a big afternoon for the Cardinal,
leading all hitters with 19 kills and a .545 hit
ting percentage. But her effort went for
naught as USC, outkilled Stanford 78-58
with six Trojans picking up at least eight
kills.
All six of those players will be back for
USC next year.
"This is just the start. There is more to
come, let me tell you," said USC coach Mick

Haley. "These kids are wonderful.
What a great match."
Stanford looked tentative in
game one, as Stanford's offense
sputtered with poor passing from
its back row.
Tom looked out of sorts with
her passing and attacking early on,
and nerves seemed to get the bet
ter of freshman libero Courtney
Sch ultz, the target of almost every
USC serve. Burdine aced Schultz
to cap an 8-2 run that put the Tro
jans up 19-16.
Back-to-back blocks by Tom
and junior middle Jenn Harvey
kept Stanford in the game. But the
Cardinal's offensive woes — Stan
ford hit just .094 with only eight
kills in the game to USC's 22 —
were too much for Stanford to
keep up with USC. The Trojans
escaped with a 30-27 win.
"It's ridiculous that we only had
eight kills but could've won the
game," Dunning said. "We
weren't very good offensively, but
there were a lot of other things
going on. They were getting a lot
of kills, but they were also making
a lot of errors."
The Trojans continued to
rack up the errors in game two,
but this time the Cardinal's pass
ing was solid and Stanford had
all of the offense it needed to take
full advantage.
Nnamani had three kills in the
first four rallies to push Stanford to
a 5-1 lead that it would never re
linquish. Tom added seven kills to
Nnamani's nine, and strong Stan
ford serving helped the Cardinal
outhit the Trojans .600 to .167 in
the dominating 30-23 win.
"We knew it was the last match,
so after the first game we had to get
it together and fight more," said
McGee, who finished the match
with 11 kills.
Stanford's passing problems re
turned with a vengeance in game
three, peaking when, with Stan
ford up 11-9, USC embarked on a

seven-point run that swung the
match to the Trojans for good.
The Cardinal didn't have a single
clean play during the stretch,
which saw Stanford get aced by
Burdine twice and the Cardinal
use both of its timeouts.
Dunning pulled starting ju
nior setter Anna Robinson at the
end of the run, putting the of
fense in the hands of freshman
Katie Goldhahn.
Goldhahn responded, bringing
the Cardinal attack back online
and even picking up a kill and an
ace during a four-point Stanford
run that closed the gap to three at
24-21.
But that's as close as the Cardi
nal would get, as USC sealed the
30-24 win with back-to-back kills.
"Our passing just got bad [in
game three]," Tom said. We

weren't moving our feet and we
were letting easy balls drop."
The Cardinal appeared to be
dead in the water early in game
four, quickly falling behind 6-1.
Tom turned up her effort with
the Cardinal's back against the
wall, picking up five kills and an
ace in the second half of the game
as Stanford appeared to be on the
verge of a huge comeback.
But USC's (5-2 systems worked
to perfection in the match's wan
ing moments, keeping the Trojan
hitters a step ahead of the Stanford
blockers on almost every swing.
The Cardinal, which dominated
the Pac-10 in blocking this season,
rarely had two blockers up on any
attack, and several USC hits went
unchallenged at the net.
Olsovsky had a clear look out of
the middle on championship

point, putting down a kill to seal
the Trojans' 30-26 win.
Stanford, which averaged 3.6
blocks per game during the sea
son, had only 11 blocks in the
match, and only four in the last two
games.
Tom finished with four of Stan
ford's nine aces, but she and junior
middle blocker Jenn Harvey each
had four service errors as USC]
clearly won the all-important serv
ing battle. Burdine finished with
four aces for the Trojans.
Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
finished with seven kills and seven
digs in her final match for Stan
ford. Senior outside hitter Lindsey
Yamasaki, who returned to volley
ball after playing in the YVNBA this
summer, had two aces and 11 digs
in her last performance for the
Cardinal.

It was never certain, though, which of the
two Pacific-10 Conference powerhouses was
better. The two regular-season meetings be
tween them only suggested that if they
played 100 times, each squad would almost
certainly win 50 of the contests.
But on the one day that mattered most, in
the one match that decided it all, USC was
clearly better.
Behind a ferocious attack and a strong
service game, the Trojans (31-1) won their
first national title since 1981 by upending
the defending national champion Cardinal
(33-5) 3-1 in front of 6,451 at the New Or
leans Arena.
USC took full advantage of inconsistent

passing by the Cardinal, attacking from all
sides of the court to beat Stanford's usually
dominating blocking game.
Four Trojans finished with double-digit
kill totals. But it was Final Four MVP Keao
Burdine and Katie Olsovky's surge of attacks
out of the middle in the second half of the
match that did Stanford in. The two com
bined for 31 kills in the match, including 11
in the final game.
"They played with a lot of heart tonight,"
said Stanford coach John Dunning. "They
had a lot of weapons. It was impressive to
watch.
"I'm proud of our team. We had a great
year. We have to feel good about how we
hung in tough when things weren't going
well for us."
USC was able to slow senior outside hitter
Logan Tom for long stretches of the match,
holding her to just one kill in games one and
three and a .217 hitting percentage for the
match.
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani had a big afternoon for the Cardinal,
leading all hitters with 19 kills and a .545 hit
ting percentage. But her effort went for
naught as USC, outkilled Stanford 78-58
with six Trojans picking up at least eight
kills.
All six of those players will be back for
USC next year.
"This is just the start. There is more to
come, let me tell you," said USC coach Mick

Haley. "These kids are wonderful.
What a great match."
Stanford looked tentative in
game one, as Stanford's offense
sputtered with poor passing from
its back row.
Tom looked out of sorts with
her passing and attacking early on,
and nerves seemed to get the bet
ter of freshman libero Courtney
Sch ultz, the target of almost every
USC serve. Burdine aced Schultz
to cap an 8-2 run that put the Tro
jans up 19-16.
Back-to-back blocks by Tom
and junior middle Jenn Harvey
kept Stanford in the game. But the
Cardinal's offensive woes — Stan
ford hit just .094 with only eight
kills in the game to USC's 22 —
were too much for Stanford to
keep up with USC. The Trojans
escaped with a 30-27 win.
"It's ridiculous that we only had
eight kills but could've won the
game," Dunning said. "We
weren't very good offensively, but
there were a lot of other things
going on. They were getting a lot
of kills, but they were also making
a lot of errors."
The Trojans continued to
rack up the errors in game two,
but this time the Cardinal's pass
ing was solid and Stanford had
all of the offense it needed to take
full advantage.
Nnamani had three kills in the
first four rallies to push Stanford to
a 5-1 lead that it would never re
linquish. Tom added seven kills to
Nnamani's nine, and strong Stan
ford serving helped the Cardinal
outhit the Trojans .600 to .167 in
the dominating 30-23 win.
"We knew it was the last match,
so after the first game we had to get
it together and fight more," said
McGee, who finished the match
with 11 kills.
Stanford's passing problems re
turned with a vengeance in game
three, peaking when, with Stan
ford up 11-9, USC embarked on a

seven-point run that swung the
match to the Trojans for good.
The Cardinal didn't have a single
clean play during the stretch,
which saw Stanford get aced by
Burdine twice and the Cardinal
use both of its timeouts.
Dunning pulled starting ju
nior setter Anna Robinson at the
end of the run, putting the of
fense in the hands of freshman
Katie Goldhahn.
Goldhahn responded, bringing
the Cardinal attack back online
and even picking up a kill and an
ace during a four-point Stanford
run that closed the gap to three at
24-21.
But that's as close as the Cardi
nal would get, as USC sealed the
30-24 win with back-to-back kills.
"Our passing just got bad [in
game three]," Tom said. We

weren't moving our feet and we
were letting easy balls drop."
The Cardinal appeared to be
dead in the water early in game
four, quickly falling behind 6-1.
Tom turned up her effort with
the Cardinal's back against the
wall, picking up five kills and an
ace in the second half of the game
as Stanford appeared to be on the
verge of a huge comeback.
But USC's (5-2 systems worked
to perfection in the match's wan
ing moments, keeping the Trojan
hitters a step ahead of the Stanford
blockers on almost every swing.
The Cardinal, which dominated
the Pac-10 in blocking this season,
rarely had two blockers up on any
attack, and several USC hits went
unchallenged at the net.
Olsovsky had a clear look out of
the middle on championship

point, putting down a kill to seal
the Trojans' 30-26 win.
Stanford, which averaged 3.6
blocks per game during the sea
son, had only 11 blocks in the
match, and only four in the last two
games.
Tom finished with four of Stan
ford's nine aces, but she and junior
middle blocker Jenn Harvey each
had four service errors as USC]
clearly won the all-important serv
ing battle. Burdine finished with

Senior outside hitter Ashley Ivy
finished with seven kills and seven
digs in her final match for Stan
ford. Senior outside hitter Lindsey
Yamasaki, who returned to volley
ball after playing in the YVNBA this
summer, had two aces and 11 digs
in her last performance for the
Cardinal.
