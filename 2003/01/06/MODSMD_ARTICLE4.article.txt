### EZRA CALLAHAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
NEW ORLEANS â€” Long before Stan
ford and Southern California reached the
NCAA tournament final on Dec. 21, there
was a general consensus in the collegiate vol
leyball community that the two were the na
tion's best teams in 2002.

Women's Volleyball
Dec. 21: No. 1 USC def. No. 2 Stanford 30-27,
23-30, 30-24, 30-26, NCAA Final

The NCAA coaches had either the
Women of Troy or the Cardinal at the top
spot in their rankings every week but one
during the season, and the NCAA selection
committee made the squads the top two
seeds for the championship tournament.
It was never certain, though, which of the
two Pacific-10 Conference powerhouses was
better. The two regular-season meetings be
tween them only suggested that if they
played 100 times, each squad would almost
certainly win 50 of the contests.
But on the one day that mattered most, in
the one match that decided it all, USC was
clearly better.
Behind a ferocious attack and a strong
service game, the Trojans (31-1) won their
first national title since 1981 by upending
the defending national champion Cardinal
(33-5) 3-1 in front of 6,451 at the New Or
leans Arena.
USC took full advantage of inconsistent

passing by the Cardinal, attacking from all
sides of the court to beat Stanford's usually
dominating blocking game.
Four Trojans finished with double-digit
kill totals. But it was Final Four MVP Keao
Burdine and Katie Olsovky's surge of attacks
out of the middle in the second half of the
match that did Stanford in. The two com
bined for 31 kills in the match, including 11
in the final game.
"They played with a lot of heart tonight,"
said Stanford coach John Dunning. "They
had a lot of weapons. It was impressive to
watch.
"I'm proud of our team. We had a great
year. We have to feel good about how we
hung in tough when things weren't going
well for us."
USC was able to slow senior outside hitter
Logan Tom for long stretches of the match,
holding her to just one kill in games one and
three and a .217 hitting percentage for the
match.
Sophomore outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani had a big afternoon for the Cardinal,
leading all hitters with 19 kills and a .545 hit
ting percentage. But her effort went for
naught as USC, outkilled Stanford 78-58
with six Trojans picking up at least eight
kills.
All six of those players will be back for
USC next year.
"This is just the start. There is more to
come, let me tell you," said USC coach Mick
