FINAL FOUR NOTES

team Ail-American all four years.
Tom became Stanford's all-time kill leader
with kill number 1,910 against Arizona in the
NCAA regional finals on Dec. 13, passing Kristin
Klein's record set in 1991. Tom finished herca-
reer with 1,939 kills, placing her
third all time in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
Her career totals are even more
impressive given that she missed
22 matches during her career
while playing with the U.S. nation
al team.
Tom missed 15 matches in
2000 while leading the U.S. to an
unexpected fourth-place finish at
the Sydney Olympics, and she
missed seven matches this year
while guiding the Americans to a
silver medal at the World Cham
pionships. Tom has been the only
collegiate player on the U.S. roster
for the last three years.
Last year, Tom set the single
season record for kills with (521.
She led Stanford in kills all four
seasons on the Farm, pushing the
Cardinal to three NCAA champi
onship game appearances and
Stanford's fifth national crown
last year.
Tom also leaves Stanford sec
ond on the all-time ace list with 169
and fifth all time in digs with 1,231.
Tom has said that she expects to
play professional volleyball in ei
ther Brazil or Italy this winter be
fore returning to Stanford next fall
to finish her degree.

tion, her first national honor, after
hitting a Stanford-record .426
during the regular season.
McGee also led Stanford's dom
inating blocking game with 179
blocks during the season, the
fourth-highest single-season mark
in Cardinal history. She finished
second in the Pac-10 with 1.39
blocks per game, just behind team
mate Jenn Harvey.

the team in kills this season, is now
playing her first season with the
Stanford women's basketball
team.
Nnamani earned her second
straight second-team selection
after leading Stanford with 529

• Southern California's Mick
1 laley became just the second
coach to win NCAA titles at two dif
ferent schools. Haley also won a
title with Texas in 1988.
I laley guided USC to a champi
onship in just his second year with
the Trojans, and with seven of
USC's nine regular rotation play
ers returning next year, another
title could be in store during his
third season at the helm.

came the first coach to win titles at

multiple schools last year. Dun

overall.
The Pac-10 and the Big Ten
each had eight teams in the 64-team
NCAA field to lead all conferences.
All eight Pac-10 teams won their
first-round matches, and four
reached the Elite Eight (Stanford,
USC, Washington State and Ari
zona).
Only three Big Ten teams
made the Sweet 16, and none of
those squads reached the next
rou nd.
• Despite its ongoing alcohol pro
bation, the Stanford Band still
made a solid showing in the Big
Easy.
The Band rallied through the
French Quarter between the
NCAA semifinals and finals on
Dec. 20, drawing a surprisingly
large group of spectators in tow.
The Band also played at the
Cardinal squad's hotel on the edge
of the French Quarter as the team
