NEW ORLEANS — Before falling to
Southern California in the title game, Stan
ford swept Hawaii (34-2) for the second
time this season in the first NCAA semifinal
match on Dec. 18 at the New Orleans Arena.

ROAD TO THE NCAA FINAL

A huge crowd turned out to see Hawaii
Ail-American outside hitter Kim
Willoughby, a Louisiana native and one
of the nation's most explosive players with
an average output of over six kills per
game.
Willoughby did her usual damage, run
ning off 22 kills, but Stanford's blockers
forced the Wahine's big weapon to a num
ber of errors. And by the end of the match,
senior outside hitter Logan Tom was sonic
how getting under almost every one of
Willoughby's explosive hits.
Willoughby finished with 13 errors and a
measly .136 hitting percentage.

Hawaii stayed close in all three games,
but collapsed in the waning moments of all
three sets.
Stanford closed the first game on a four
point run, with the last three rallies ending
on Hawaii errors.
Hawaii led 26-24 in the second game,
but a disputed touch call on an attack by
Stanford sophomore outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani on the ne xt point took
all of the wind out of the Wahine's sails.
Nnamani followed that kill up with three
blocks and another kill to lift the Cardinal
to a 30-27 win.
The Wahine also led 23-22 late in game
three before loni went on a four-kill tear
duringa 8-1 Cardinal run toencl the match.
Nnamani finished with a team-high 15
kills, followed closely by Tom, who had 13
along with a match-high 21 digs.
Stanford was the only team to beat
1 lawaii this year, doing so twice Ihe Cardi
nal swept the Wahine in from over 10,000
fans in Honolulu on Nov. 10.
Regional Final: No. 10 Arizona,
30-14,30-17,30-25
Stanford got some big payback
on the Wildcats (20-11), who had
overcome a 2-0 deficit to upset the
Cardinal in Tucson on Oct. 11.
The Cardinal ripped apart its
Pac-10 rival on Dec. 13 behind 15
kills from Tom, who broke
Kristin Klein's Stanford career
kill record on the last play of the
match, picking up her 1,910 th
kill as a Cardinal.
Tom and senior outside hitters
Ashley Ivy and Lindsey Yamasaki
combined for 32 of Stanford's 41
digs in the match in their final ap
pearances at Maples Pavilion.
Those defensive performances
helped the Cardinal limit Ari
zona's freshman All-American
Kim Glass to just 10 kills and a .029
hitting percentage.
Regional Semifinal: No. 13 Ohio
State, 30-24,30-25, 30-27
Things seemed dire for the
Buckeyes (21-11) when setter
Katie Virtue tore her ACL the day
before this Dec. 12 match. But a
19-kill performance by All-Ameri
can outside hitter Stacey Gordon
kept Ohio State in the match.
Gordon consistently beat Stan
ford's blockers, especially from the
back row. Her teammates couldn't
follow suit, however, and a 17-3
blocking margin in favor of the
Cardinal — along with a 16-kill

showing by Nnamani — were too
much for (lie Buckeyes.
Junior middle blocker Sara
McGee had eight blocks to lead
Stanford's dominating perfor
mance at the net.
Second Round: Pacific, 30-26,
29-31, 30-14, 30-21
Tom and Nnamani combined
for 45 kills while McGee added an
other 17 to lilt Stanford past Pacif
ic (19-13) on Dec. 7 at Maples for
the second time this season.
All-American middle blocker
Jennifer Joines had 18 kills to lead
the Tigers against their former
coach of 16 years, John Dunning,
who left for the Farm last year, but
a complete defensive collapse in
game three thwarted Pacific's
upset bid.
After only siding out Stanford
twice in the third game, Pacific
watched the final game slip away
during a 1(5-5 Cardinal run that
ended the match.
First Round: Sacramento State,
30-22,30-8,30-17
A2O-point run in game two, the
longest in Stanford history, high
lighted Stanford's easy first-round
victory over the Hornets on Dec. 6
at Maples.
Yamasaki served 19 straight
points during the second-game
run. Stanford closed the second
game on a 23-3 run.
Tom led all players with 14 kills
and 14 digs, while Ivy served up
six aces in (he match to go along
with three from Yamasaki. It was
the third time this season Ivy tal
lied six aces in a match.
