of the nation's most explosive players with
an average output of over six kills per

ning off 22 kills, but Stanford's blockers
forced the Wahine's big weapon to a num
ber of errors. And by the end of the match,
senior outside hitter Logan Tom was sonic
how getting under almost every one of
Willoughby's explosive hits.
Willoughby finished with 13 errors and a
measly .136 hitting percentage.

but collapsed in the waning moments of all
three sets.

blocks and another kill to lift the Cardinal
to a 30-27 win.
