# Improbable NCAA run caps bumpy season
## 
### JIMMY WU STAFF WRITER 
After a heartbreaking 1 -0 loss to
third-seeded UCLA (18-3-3) in the
NCAA title game, the Stanford
men's soccer team (18-5-2) un
doubtedly came home from Dallas
tired and very disappointed with
the way things finished.
But after a far-less-than-perfect
season, few thought that the ninth
seeded Cardinal would even have
the opportunity to bring home its
first-ever soccer championship?
A tumultuous 3-3-2 second half
to the season, which saw Stanford
get shut out five times in six games
at one point, and a third-place fin
ish in the Pacific-10 Conference cre
ated more than a few naysayers.
To most, Stanford looked to be
just another pretender in the
NCAA field of 48.
Compared to last year's national
semifinal squad, this year's Cardi
nal had to deal with many more
question marks.
All-American Roger Levesque,
Stanford's biggest scoring threat,
had a huge drop-off in production,
made worse by a knee injury that
forced him to miss several matches.
Stanford also lost one of the na
tion's premier defenders, senior
All-American Todd Dunivant, fora
few games.
The list continues. At the begin
ning of the year, Stanford had to
cope with the loss of defenders Lee
Morrison and Aaron Biddle to the
MLS. Head coach Bret Simon in
stalled inexperienced freshman
Chad Marshall and first-time
starter sophomore Aaron Maines in
their place.
In another defensive shakeup,
sophomore Robby Fulton was in
stalled as goalie rnidseason, in place
of last year's full-time starter senior
Andrew Ferris.
Combine these factors, and it
looked like the Cardinal was head
ed to a disappointing postseason.
As seen in the results, Simon and
his 22 players obviously had other
ideas.
"This year was much more diffi
cult [than last season]," Simon said.
"We had much more to deal with
on and off the field. The guys
worked incredibly hard through
out the offseason, and it looked like
we were lined up to have another

steamroller type of year.
"But we never had a full week of
good health and never created the
kind of springboard that most
teams use to make playoff runs. I in
stead the players just gritted their
teeth and kept working harder.
They didn't give up on themselves
or their teammates, even when bad
fortune seemed to be following
them."
Senior defender Taylor Graham
believed that the team's tight bond
gave it the strength to overcome
this season's many hurdles.
"The closeness of our team was
certainly a factor that helped our
success," he said. "We fought for
each other every day in practice, so
it came naturally in games."
At the beginning of the year, the
polls recognized Stanford's poten
tial, bestowing the Cardinal with
the No. 2 ranking. Stanford quickly
moved up to No. 1, and the Cardi
nal looked to be cruising to another
fine season with an undefeated 7-0
record.
The offense was scoring at will,
Levesque looked to be fully recov
ered from a previous injury, and
the defense performed adequately
to win, even with the adjustments it
had to make.
But suddenly, an unranked
Tulsa team exposed the Stanford
defense with a 3-1 walloping at Mal
oney Field.
Problem No. 1.
Solution: Veteran defenders
Taylor Graham and Dunivant
stayed patient, continued to play
high level soccer, and Maines and
Marshall eventually developed into
extremely dependable players. Ful
ton solidified his status as starting
keeper, and the defense went on to
allow only nine goals in its last 13
games, including eight shutouts,
despite losing Dunivant for part of
that stretch.
With the defense playing well, it
was the offense's turn to hit a snag.
After scoring 22 points in the first
10 games, Levesque suffered a
knee injury and was never the same
since. Sidelined for four games, he
was only able to score another five
points for the rest of the season.
The team followed suit, getting
held scoreless in five out of six con
ference games and earning a dis
mal 1-3-1 record during this streak.
Big problems No. 2 and 3.

Solutions: the team refused to let
injuries become an excuse, and it
continued to fight through
makeshift lineups. It continued to
believe that it was only a matter of
time before the offense corrected it
self and that it was a much better
team than the results showed.
Although the offense did not ex
actly kick into high gear at the end
of the season, the team rediscov
ered how to win. Despite having
four of its last six games decided by
overtimes or penalty kicks, the Car
dinal was resilient and always
pulled through at the end.
Stanford still fell short of its first
men's soccer championship, but
with everything that the team had
to encounter, the Cardinal was
proud of its accomplishments.
"I'm very proud of this team
and also saddened that we didn't
win the championship," Simon
said. "Most teams don't have the
resiliency to give their heart and
soul to achieve their goals despite
repeated shortcomings. Yet, the
players remained steadfast and op
timistic and trained and played
with great concentration and confi
dence every day. That was really
amazing."

The Stanford-UCLA final
was not only the first ever be
tween two Pac-10 teams, it was
the first between two teams
from the West Coast.
Stanford was making just
its second championship
game appearance. The Car
dinal lost to Indiana 3-1 in
the 1998 title game.
The Bruins were making
their seventh appearance in an
NCAA final. After losing in the
finals in 1970, 1972 and 1973,
UCLA has now won the last
four championship matches it
has played.
• Seniors Roger Levesque
and Todd Dunivant and fresh
man Chad Marshall were
named to the All-Tournament
Team. Marshall and Levesque
scored Stanford's goals in its 2-1
double-overtime win over
Creighton in the semifinals.
UCLA landed five on the All-
Tournament Team, including
the offensive MVP, Aaron Lopez,
and the defensive MVP, goal
keeper Zach Wells.

UCLA has now won the last
four championship matches it
has played.

After a heartbreaking 1 -0 loss to
third-seeded UCLA (18-3-3) in the
NCAA title game, the Stanford
men's soccer team (18-5-2) un
doubtedly came home from Dallas
tired and very disappointed with
the way things finished.
But after a far-less-than-perfect
season, few thought that the ninth
seeded Cardinal would even have
the opportunity to bring home its
first-ever soccer championship?
A tumultuous 3-3-2 second half
to the season, which saw Stanford
get shut out five times in six games
at one point, and a third-place fin
ish in the Pacific-10 Conference cre
ated more than a few naysayers.
To most, Stanford looked to be
just another pretender in the
NCAA field of 48.
Compared to last year's national
semifinal squad, this year's Cardi
nal had to deal with many more
question marks.
All-American Roger Levesque,
Stanford's biggest scoring threat,
had a huge drop-off in production,
made worse by a knee injury that
forced him to miss several matches.
Stanford also lost one of the na
tion's premier defenders, senior
All-American Todd Dunivant, fora
few games.
The list continues. At the begin
ning of the year, Stanford had to
cope with the loss of defenders Lee
Morrison and Aaron Biddle to the
MLS. Head coach Bret Simon in
stalled inexperienced freshman
Chad Marshall and first-time
starter sophomore Aaron Maines in
their place.
In another defensive shakeup,
sophomore Robby Fulton was in
stalled as goalie rnidseason, in place
of last year's full-time starter senior
Andrew Ferris.
Combine these factors, and it
looked like the Cardinal was head
ed to a disappointing postseason.
As seen in the results, Simon and
his 22 players obviously had other
ideas.
"This year was much more diffi
cult [than last season]," Simon said.
"We had much more to deal with
on and off the field. The guys
worked incredibly hard through
out the offseason, and it looked like
we were lined up to have another

steamroller type of year.
"But we never had a full week of
good health and never created the
kind of springboard that most
teams use to make playoff runs. I in
stead the players just gritted their
teeth and kept working harder.
They didn't give up on themselves
or their teammates, even when bad
fortune seemed to be following
them."
Senior defender Taylor Graham
believed that the team's tight bond
gave it the strength to overcome
this season's many hurdles.
"The closeness of our team was
certainly a factor that helped our
success," he said. "We fought for
each other every day in practice, so
it came naturally in games."
At the beginning of the year, the
polls recognized Stanford's poten
tial, bestowing the Cardinal with
the No. 2 ranking. Stanford quickly
moved up to No. 1, and the Cardi
nal looked to be cruising to another
fine season with an undefeated 7-0
record.
The offense was scoring at will,
Levesque looked to be fully recov
ered from a previous injury, and
the defense performed adequately
to win, even with the adjustments it
had to make.
But suddenly, an unranked
Tulsa team exposed the Stanford
defense with a 3-1 walloping at Mal
oney Field.
Problem No. 1.
Solution: Veteran defenders
Taylor Graham and Dunivant
stayed patient, continued to play
high level soccer, and Maines and
Marshall eventually developed into
extremely dependable players. Ful
ton solidified his status as starting
keeper, and the defense went on to
allow only nine goals in its last 13
games, including eight shutouts,
despite losing Dunivant for part of
that stretch.
With the defense playing well, it
was the offense's turn to hit a snag.
After scoring 22 points in the first
10 games, Levesque suffered a
knee injury and was never the same
since. Sidelined for four games, he
was only able to score another five
points for the rest of the season.
The team followed suit, getting
held scoreless in five out of six con
ference games and earning a dis
mal 1-3-1 record during this streak.
Big problems No. 2 and 3.

Solutions: the team refused to let
injuries become an excuse, and it
continued to fight through
makeshift lineups. It continued to
believe that it was only a matter of
time before the offense corrected it
self and that it was a much better
team than the results showed.
Although the offense did not ex
actly kick into high gear at the end
of the season, the team rediscov
ered how to win. Despite having
four of its last six games decided by
overtimes or penalty kicks, the Car
dinal was resilient and always
pulled through at the end.
Stanford still fell short of its first
men's soccer championship, but
with everything that the team had
to encounter, the Cardinal was
proud of its accomplishments.
"I'm very proud of this team
and also saddened that we didn't
win the championship," Simon
said. "Most teams don't have the
resiliency to give their heart and
soul to achieve their goals despite
repeated shortcomings. Yet, the
players remained steadfast and op
timistic and trained and played
with great concentration and confi
dence every day. That was really
amazing."

The Stanford-UCLA final
was not only the first ever be
tween two Pac-10 teams, it was
the first between two teams
from the West Coast.
Stanford was making just
its second championship
game appearance. The Car
dinal lost to Indiana 3-1 in
the 1998 title game.
The Bruins were making
their seventh appearance in an
NCAA final. After losing in the
finals in 1970, 1972 and 1973,
