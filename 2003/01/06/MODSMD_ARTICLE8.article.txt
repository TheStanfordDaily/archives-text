### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
BERKELEY —At California, the crowd was
exactly what you'd expect — extremely vocal,
hungry for Cardinal blood, unrelentless and
unforgiving of Stanford's errors.

Men's Basketball
Saturday: Cal 72, Stanford 59

Prior to the game, Stanford men's basketball
head coach Mike Montgomery said that Haas Pavil
ion would be "as hostile as it's going to get for us."
And hostile it was.
Shoot an air ball, and they wouldn't let you
forget about it.
Foul out of the game, and 12,000 fans shout
"you suck" in unison.
Dare to wear a red shirt at Haas, and the
ridicule, along with chants of "take that red
shirt off," never ceased.
"We looked young and uncertain [during
Stanford's game against Cal on Saturday],"
Montgomery said. "A little bit of that may have
had to do with the environment."
However, Haas Pavilion can't receive all of
the blame for the Cardinal's 72-59 loss to Cal.
Stanford failed to keep Cal off of the offensive
glass and shot a meager 12.5 percent from be
hind the arc in the second half.
"We did not compete at the level we needed
to," Montgomery said. "We didn't have guys
perform."
The Bears grabbed 10 offensive boards and
scored 20 second-chance points (16 of which
came in the second half). Stanford only scored
eight second-chance points and was outre
bouncled for only the second time this season.
(The first was against then-No. 7 Florida, which
outrebounded Stanford 40-39 in its four-point
loss to the Cardinal).
"Rebounding is an effort stat," said Cal
head coach Ben Braun. "Stanford [has been]
outrebounding teams by 10 a game, and we
outrebounded them by nine. That's phe
nomenal."
Stanford led only twice in the first half. Sopho
more center Rob Little scored off an assist from
junior Matt Lottich in the first minute of play. Cal
then went on a 12-3 run to open up the game.
The Cardinal headed into the locker room
down by Only six points after shooting 50 per
cent from the free-throw line and 41 percent
from the Held.
"[ln the first half,] we didn't do anything
well, and we were right there ," Montgomery
said.
Stanford opened the second half on a 6-0
run but couldn't manage to take the lead.

"We know that [Stanford is] a team that can
stay in the game," said Cal senior swingman
Brian Wethers. "We knew that they were going
to make a run."
But just as Stanford began to make its run,
forward Justin Davis went out with an injury to
his knee, and a few minutes later Little fouled
out. Davis, despite playing only 28 minutes,
scored 10 points and grabbed eight rebounds
while Little added 12 points and seven re
bounds in only 25 minutes of play.
"Justin probably could have scored any
time he got the ball and Rob could have too,
but we couldn't keep them in the game,"
Montgomery said.
After that, the game which was slowed sig
nificantly by fouls, just began to get away from
the Cardinal. The teams were Whistled a com
bined 45 times. Cal entered the bonus with live
minutes left to play and shot 22 free throws in
t he second half alone.
The Bears closed the game on a 10-2 run,
and there was nothing more Stanford could do.
Onlv the Cal security team could stop fans

from rushing the court this year.
And they did. Security was successful this
time, which proves, if anything, that practice
does make some things better. Cal fans were
forced to celebrate in the stands by hoisting up
and paying homage to their newly reclaimed
Axe for all to see.
"It's a rival game. It's our home opener. We
like to defend our home court, especially
against Stanford." Wethers said. "We finally
stepped up to the challenge. For awhile it was a
rather one-sided rivalry."
"Tliey were tougher than we were tonight,"
Montgomerv said. "Thev were more physical
[and | appeared to play much harder. We did
not compete at the level we needed to. [We
can't | allow ourselves to get manhandled like
we were'toYught.'"
filings don't get any easier for Stanford this
coming week as the Oregon schools will pay a
visit to Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal will face
off against unranked Oregon State on Thurs
day at 7:00 p.m. and No. 7 Oregon on Saturday
at 2:00 p.m.
