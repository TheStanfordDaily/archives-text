Jlist when it started to look like
nothing could go wrong . ..
Just when you thought that all
was well for the Stanford men's
basketball team .. .
Winter break happened.
If you didn't follow the Cardi
nal (9-4, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) the last few weeks, you
missed six major losses (and we're
not just talking games in the loss
column here).
Loss No. 1 — One not-so
sunny Thursday during finals
week would-be junior forward
Teyo Johnson announced ever
so quietly that he would forgo his
remaining years of NCAA eligi
bility in both basketball and foot
ball to enter the upcoming NTT
Draft.
Loss No. 2 — Montana.
In the first round of the Stan
ford Invitational, the then-No. 17
Cardinal was upset at home 70-68
off of 3-point shot made with 4.3
seconds left by Grizzlie guard
David Bell, a Northern California
local.
"We got what we deserved,"
said head coach Mike Mont
gomery after the game. "Montana
came in here and played much
better than I or the rest of the
coaching staff thought they
would."
And just when you thought it
couldn't get worse than an open
ing-round loss to Montana ...
Loss No. 3 — Sophomore
point guard Chris Hernandez re
turned on Dec. 14 against St.
Mary's after missing the first four
weeks of play with a broken foot.
He played shakily (as one would
expect) for six minutes and tal

lied 3 assists.
I lowever, I lernandez's much
anticipated return, which would
have most likely moved senior
guard Julius Barnes to the 2-spot
and junior Matt Lottich to the
bench, was cut short with news two
days later that Hernandez had re
broken his foot and would be
forced to sit out the remainder of
the season.
"We were all just sick when we
found out," head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "The news
sucked the air out of us, but the
team we have is what we have."
Hernandez will receive a med
ical redshirt because he will have
appeared in less than 20 percent of
the Cardinal's games and will get
the chance to repeat his sopho
more year next season.
Loss No. 4 came on the heels
of the Hernandez loss. One day
after the startling loss to un
ranked Montana, Stanford
dropped another game to un
ranked Richmond 83-69 to finish
last in its own tournament lor the
first time ever.
The winter season wasn't all
bad, however. There were a few
big wins as well.
After the losses to Montana and
Richmond, the Cardinal bounced
back and defeated unranked UC-
Irvine 84-57 at Maples.
Barnes scored 24 points and
sophomores Josh Childress and
Rob Little both added 11 points en
route to Stanford's biggest win
margin of the season.
Two days later, the Cardinal
used that 27-point victory over the
Anteaters to fuel a 77-66 win over
UNLV in Las Vegas. And one
week later, Stanford handilv de
feated Yale 79-56 at Maples.
However, the most recent —
and, for the time being, the
most crucial — losses came on
Saturday night in front of a
near-capacity crowd at Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley.
Loss No. 5 — Stanford fell to 0-
lin Pacific-10 Conference play
after losing to California 72-59 Sat
urday evening.
And because we're still talking

about losses, tack on loss No. 6.
Junior forward Justin Davis
hobbled off the court early in the
second half with what has been
called a sprained MCL in his left
knee. Stanford is awaiting the re
sults of an MRI taken last night.
"He'll be out for awhile," said a
stoic Montgomery after the game.
The loss of Davis could prove
to be the most devastating tints
far. Despite Stanford's other
woes, Davis was having an amaz
ing winter break, which included
four double-doubles and two
back-to-back personal high-point
games. He scored 21 and 24

points to lead the Cardinal to vic
tory against Irvine and UNLV,
respectively.
Unfortunately, the injury
comes at Davis' personal peak as a
member of the Stanford basket
ball team and seems to put the
icing on the cake for what was a
not-so relaxing vacation for this
Cardinal team.
Loss No. 1 above may not have
seemed too bad before, but John
son's departure could sting 10
times as much if Davis is out for an
extended length of time.
But where are my manners?

more year next season.
Loss No. 4 came on the heels
of the Hernandez loss. One day
after the startling loss to un
ranked Montana, Stanford
dropped another game to un
ranked Richmond 83-69 to finish
last in its own tournament lor the
first time ever.
The winter season wasn't all
bad, however. There were a few
big wins as well.
After the losses to Montana and
Richmond, the Cardinal bounced
back and defeated unranked UC-
Irvine 84-57 at Maples.
Barnes scored 24 points and
sophomores Josh Childress and
Rob Little both added 11 points en
route to Stanford's biggest win
margin of the season.
Two days later, the Cardinal
used that 27-point victory over the
Anteaters to fuel a 77-66 win over
UNLV in Las Vegas. And one
week later, Stanford handilv de
feated Yale 79-56 at Maples.
However, the most recent —
and, for the time being, the
most crucial — losses came on
Saturday night in front of a
near-capacity crowd at Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley.
Loss No. 5 — Stanford fell to 0-
lin Pacific-10 Conference play
after losing to California 72-59 Sat
urday evening.
And because we're still talking

about losses, tack on loss No. 6.
Junior forward Justin Davis
hobbled off the court early in the
second half with what has been
called a sprained MCL in his left
knee. Stanford is awaiting the re
sults of an MRI taken last night.
"He'll be out for awhile," said a
stoic Montgomery after the game.
The loss of Davis could prove
to be the most devastating tints
far. Despite Stanford's other
woes, Davis was having an amaz
ing winter break, which included
four double-doubles and two
back-to-back personal high-point
games. He scored 21 and 24

points to lead the Cardinal to vic
tory against Irvine and UNLV,
respectively.
Unfortunately, the injury
comes at Davis' personal peak as a
member of the Stanford basket
ball team and seems to put the
icing on the cake for what was a
not-so relaxing vacation for this
Cardinal team.
Loss No. 1 above may not have
seemed too bad before, but John
son's departure could sting 10
times as much if Davis is out for an
extended length of time.
But where are my manners?
How was vour winter break?
