Art History
108A/308A. Masters of 16th-century Northern Renaissance Painting
This course looks at works by major artists of Germany and the Netherlands such as Albrecht Diirer,
Hieronymous Bosch, Mattias Griinewald, Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, Hans Holbein, Lucas
Cranach, and Pieter Brueghel. Emphasis is on altarpieces and their iconographical and liturgical func
tions; the development of portraiture; representations of class and gender in pilgrimages and other
moralizing subjects; devotional images including the Virgin and saints; the impact of north-south
exchanges upon painting practices and the selection of subjects; the role of patronage and art col
lecting; and the evolving role of the artist's profession in Northern contexts.
Professor Linda Phipps
152A/352A. El Camino Real: The Architecture of California's Great Highway
This course looks at the architecture along El Camino Real, the historic highway that stretches from
San Diego to Sonoma County. The class will look at a wide range of buildings on the highway, from
Native American structures and Spanish missions to motels and suburban houses. Students will
explore how the highway disseminated ideas about religion, business, and leisure throughout the state
and helped create the farms, universities, and cities that comprise El Camino Real today.
Professor William Littmann
192A/392A. The Arts of Africa
The arts of black sub-Saharan African cultures such as ancient Nigeria, and coastal and Sudanic Africa
including the Yoruba, Igbo, Dogon, and Senufo. Artistic traditions in their social context and as myth,
ritual, music, dance, and world view.
Professor Roberta Reid
241 A/541 A. The Aesthetic of the Grotesque in the 20th Century
Dadaists and Surrealists, including Hannah Hoch, Hans Bellmer, Cindy Sherman, Matthew Barney, and
John Miller, created bodies of work based on the monstrous, abject, and formless. This seminar
explores the central role of the grotesque in the history, practice, and theories of art in the 20th cen
tury.
Professor Maria Makela
2838. Issues in Contemporary Chinese Art
During the last decade, Chinese artists have developed one of the world's most active and inventive art
scenes. Course examines how artists have combined their rigorous, government controlled art train -
ing with a no-holds barred attitude toward artistic creation, resulting in works that alternately beguile
and shock the international art world. Class will focus on how art reflects social and political changes.
This course should be relevant to anyone with an interest in contemporary art, contemporary China,
or the phenomenon of globalization.
