The Bingham Fund
for Student Innovation in
Human Biology
The Bingham Foundation has generously provided funds that will support innova
tive student projects proposed by Human Biology majors intended to benefit under
graduate education. Proposed projects should be innovations that will have a posi
tive impact on the community at Stanford University, or outside of Stanford.
Possibilities include planning and implementing a new course on a topic of particu
lar interest to you; designing one or more field trips for an existing course; starting a
collaborative research project involving a group of students; organizing a lecture
series of outside speakers for Human Biology or for Storey, the Human Biology
theme house; establishing a new internship in some government agency or commu
nity organization; starting a new student publication.
Human Biology majors are encouraged to apply for these funds at any time during
the year. Applications will be reviewed at regular intervals.
To apply for funds from the Bingham Fund, you should:
1) Be a declared Human Biology major;
2) Arrange fora faculty member who will sponsor your initiative;
3) Submit a proposal identifying the need for your initiative; describe how the work
will be carried out; and discuss where and how the project would benefit the
community;
4) Arrange fora letter of reference to be sent to the Director from someone familiar
with the proposed project who can comment on its novelty, feasibility and prob
able success.
Please contact Russell Fernald, the Director of the Program in Human Biology if
you wish to discuss an idea fora project.
The proposal and letters of reference should be sent to the attention of the Director
of the Human Biology Program, Building 80, MC 2160.
