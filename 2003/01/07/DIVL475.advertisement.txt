The Adventures of Sander Lamori and His Wonder Dog Bentham
Episode XI Dara Weinberg
, -v THE DATE:
jc&l&bk IMy bed- Don't you recognize it yet?
MgV Jf I THE TIME:
I ForSiuider to tliesinack.
jf In all seriousness, peeps and creepers,
rhe time is ilial timeless moment well
known to all those who know how to get down, turn around, step 111 time,
Ijoot scoot boogie - it is exactly seven thirty five ay cm 011 the morning after
some serious consumption of rhymes with sticker. And the Sanderial
fprehead is splitting like a tectonic plate.
Five dill pickles later (authentic Estonian hangover cure) 1 am my usual
liright and breezy sell. With a particularly light step on the floorboards so as
t|) not awaken the A.P. (Aged Parent totheunCharlestonians), I am heading
l|>r the door like a moth 10 a wool sweater when I hear the dreaded word:
1 "Sander?"
That mellifluous voice could only belong to the French philosopher and
liiusician Jean-Michel Ventadour with whom I take lodgings.
! "The unmelodious screeching of your dubiously maintained vehicle
awoke me at a grievously late hour bier soil ."
| The man, who is no biological relative of your red-cheeked hero but
whom I refer to as the A.P. from pure affection, was pleasingly clad in a
range paisley bathrobe. In one hand be held a pipe - in the other
arsakofsky's Etudes for Bassoon. On his face, however, was a much
isgruntled expression - like J.O. Bach when he found out everyone was
going to be comparing him unfavorably to his pop for the rest of musical
history.
"My most sincere apologies to you and Karsakofsky, J-M. I assure you it
won't happen again."
"Mr. Lamori, it happens with unerring regularity three nights out of
four. I have counted."
I regard the pattern of dust on the brown fluffy rug with an expression
of consummate interest.
"Mr. Lamori, you will please recall that 1 have but three rules for the
individuals who reside in my house. They must not consume products
derived from the strawberry. They must not listen to the music of Aaron
Copland. And they must not disturb my slumbers apres minuit."
"J-M, I'm terribly sorry. I'll make it up to you."
"Nothing, dear boy, could make up for the loss ofan hour of sleep at my
age. Nothing at all."
And with those deathless words be shuttles, buffalolike, into his study.
I le's got a point - Zeta, like any good woman, squeals like an elephant stuck
in a dishwasher when she's braking for the home stretch. Unfortunately the
work I'd have to do to her brakes to eliminate those cries of pleasure would
require more capital than I currently possess. And so it goes.
I reach for the doorknob, when my discerning vision observes a certain
white envelope, tastefully slid through the mail slot, lying at my feet. The
rude note scribbled 011 the back flap confirms my worst suspicions.
YOU'RE GOING TO HELL. LAMORI.
How true. I low very true.
To be continued...
