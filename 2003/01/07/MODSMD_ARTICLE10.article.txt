### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — President Hugo
C Jiavez's government said yesterday ii was steadily re
viving the world's filth-largest oil exporting industry
a month into a strike led by Venezuela's opposition.
The standoffhas helped send international oil prices
to two-year highs.
Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said production was
about 800,000 barrels a day and would reach more
than 1 million barrels a day by the end of the week.
Venezuela normally produces 3 million barrels a day.
The stakes are crucial in Venezuela, a top supplier
to the United States, and a member of the Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
About 35,000 workers at the state owned oil mo
nopoly Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. joined a general
strike called Dec. 2 to demand that Chavez hold a
nonbinding referendum on his rule Feb. 2.
But Chavez has refused and invited his opponents
to call a binding referendum as allowed by
Venezuela's constitution in August, or halfway into
Chavez's six-year term.
Chavez on Sunday branded the PDVSA strikers as
"traitors" and said they should be tried lor jeopardiz
ing the nation's security. Oil accounts for almost half
of government revenue.
Chavez vowed to use the strike to tighten govern
ment control over PDVSA and make it a trimmer,
more profitable corporation. He has appointed loyal
board members at the semiautonomous company
and fired almost 300 executives.
Chavez said exports have reached 1.5 million bar
rels a day, compared to 2.5 million before the strike.
Analysts said the figure was unlikely.
But local industry sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the government was making
progress. They estimated exports at about 500,000
barrels a day and production at about 400,000 barrels
a day — double the lowest levels during the strike.
Government sympathizers demanded that Attor
ney General Isaias Rodriguez prosecute strike lead
ers, including the heads of Venezuela's largest busi
ness and 1 aft or cffli federations. The strike has crist
the economy billions of dollars and caused food
shortages.
