## TALES FROM UNDERCLASS Why it's so great to be back 
### 
The first thing I did to celebrate returning
home to New York was to get really sick.
No, wait, the first thing I did was eat a
turkey on rye sandwich, the second thing
1 did was eat a brisket on rye, and the third thing I
did was get sick. Then, just to make everything cir
cular, I celebrated leaving New York by getting
deathly ill. I'm still sick, and sure enough, every-

one who told me that flying while
sick is the worst was right. This va
cation wasn't exactly what I want
ed, but it was exactly what my par
ents predicted.
As much as I try to pretend it's not
true, my mom and I are almost iden
tical people. We have this terrible
habit of working ourselves to death,
living lite to the point of exhaustion,

and then refusing to come home because we know
that when we hit home we'll crash and burn. Even
Cali couldn't get rid of this neurotic tendency; it's in
the blood. So it's not like 1 was expecting to go back to
iNew York and be perfectly healthy for the month
home. I expected a payment to be due after not sleep
ing for two months. But this sick? This is just univer
sal karma getting me back for some kid I made fun of
in grade school or something. You know it's bad
when you're standing over the toilet with a fever in
the low hundreds and a thought occurs to you:
"Wouldn't it be nice to just collapse here in the bath
room and wait for my parents to find me." Yeah, that
sick.
It made fora plane ride from hell. It was even
more painful than 1 could have imagined. See for
yourself; I'm silting next to a woman I've nicknamed
Jabba [the Hut] who bears more of a resemblance to
my dead grandmother [nickname: Twineball] than
I'd like to admit. She's rapidly becoming concerned
about my health, because periodically I slump over in
pain with my nose almost touching the gelatinous
neon yellow substance in the hot portion of my in
flight meal that may or may not be eggs. I'm too
scared to find out. In her sleep she rubs her belly and
looks in my direction in a way that makes me leery of

submitting to the charms of the sandman.
To my left is a man who has just proved his physi
cal prowess to his wife by crushing a Sprite can in his
bare hands. Good job. He is seemingly concerned
about my health as well, hut for entirely different rea
sons. He's been watching me rock out to my music,
c lutching a pillow and a book of Phillip K Dick short
stories to my chest and rocking back and forth. 1 must
be autistic, or on the verge of a psychotic episode. I
don't think he wants to find out. The Stanford Uni
versity t-shirt I'm wearing must be purely for show.
And sure enough, I found myself in the little air
port bathroom with the strangely colored blue toilet
water. When I couldn't get the door unlocked and the
room started spinning, I wondered if I was going to
need to hit the little orange button to call fora flight
attendant to rescue me. I wanted to die. When 1 got
hack to my seat and the woman in front of me had put
her seat far enough back that her head was in my lap,
I wanted to kill someone.
Of course I'm bitter and belligerent and conde
scending, that's what New York does to me, and that's
why I left. The martian death flu I've contracted just
makes it worse. All this compounded by the teeny tiny
seats on the 757 I'm strapped into, the people walk
ing in the aisle who keep bumping into me, Jabba who
is clearly taking up more than one seat, and this sear
ing headache that makes smashing my head into a
wall repeatedly sound pleasant.
There was one thing that made it all bearable, one
thing that prevented me from doing anything that vi
olated FAA regulations. It was the beautiful girl I had
waiting for me in California. I can't imagine anything
more wonderful than having someone you love wait
ing for you by baggage claim who's ready to brush
away all the troubles and aches of a long crossconti
nental flight and make you realize why you get up in
the mornings.
It's good to be back. I mean sure, there's the lush
campus whose clean air I can feel cleansing my body
with each lungfull, washing out the dingy New York
air which accounted for my newly discovered "New


David Blackmail
York Allergy." And there's the classes to
look forward to, professors who are
ready to mold my mind around discrete
math and German mythology. And
there's a few more weeks of this column
which 1 resolved for New Years to start
completing in advance. But in spite of all
that, the only thing I care about right
now is the radiant face of one special girl
who did even more to mellow me out

than the Stanford atmosphere and the
California weather has.
I can already feel Cali retaking hold of
my personality. Of course I still feel like
crap, and of course none of my computers
work, and my guitar is totally out of tune,
and my luggage has exploded all over my
floor. I'm not yet carrying enough units to
qualify as a fulltime student, I have no idea
what other courses I'm taking, and classes
start today.
But I'm not worried? Why? I don't
know. Blame it on the California sun.

But I'm not worried? Why? I don't
know. Blame it on the California sun.

The first thing I did to celebrate returning
home to New York was to get really sick.
No, wait, the first thing I did was eat a
turkey on rye sandwich, the second thing
1 did was eat a brisket on rye, and the third thing I
did was get sick. Then, just to make everything cir
cular, I celebrated leaving New York by getting
deathly ill. I'm still sick, and sure enough, every-

one who told me that flying while
sick is the worst was right. This va
cation wasn't exactly what I want
ed, but it was exactly what my par
ents predicted.
As much as I try to pretend it's not
true, my mom and I are almost iden
tical people. We have this terrible
habit of working ourselves to death,
living lite to the point of exhaustion,

and then refusing to come home because we know
that when we hit home we'll crash and burn. Even
Cali couldn't get rid of this neurotic tendency; it's in
the blood. So it's not like 1 was expecting to go back to
iNew York and be perfectly healthy for the month
home. I expected a payment to be due after not sleep
ing for two months. But this sick? This is just univer
sal karma getting me back for some kid I made fun of
in grade school or something. You know it's bad
when you're standing over the toilet with a fever in
the low hundreds and a thought occurs to you:
"Wouldn't it be nice to just collapse here in the bath
room and wait for my parents to find me." Yeah, that
sick.
It made fora plane ride from hell. It was even
more painful than 1 could have imagined. See for
yourself; I'm silting next to a woman I've nicknamed
Jabba [the Hut] who bears more of a resemblance to
my dead grandmother [nickname: Twineball] than
I'd like to admit. She's rapidly becoming concerned
about my health, because periodically I slump over in
pain with my nose almost touching the gelatinous
neon yellow substance in the hot portion of my in
flight meal that may or may not be eggs. I'm too
scared to find out. In her sleep she rubs her belly and
looks in my direction in a way that makes me leery of

submitting to the charms of the sandman.
To my left is a man who has just proved his physi
cal prowess to his wife by crushing a Sprite can in his
bare hands. Good job. He is seemingly concerned
about my health as well, hut for entirely different rea
sons. He's been watching me rock out to my music,
c lutching a pillow and a book of Phillip K Dick short
stories to my chest and rocking back and forth. 1 must
be autistic, or on the verge of a psychotic episode. I
don't think he wants to find out. The Stanford Uni
versity t-shirt I'm wearing must be purely for show.
And sure enough, I found myself in the little air
port bathroom with the strangely colored blue toilet
water. When I couldn't get the door unlocked and the
room started spinning, I wondered if I was going to
need to hit the little orange button to call fora flight
attendant to rescue me. I wanted to die. When 1 got
hack to my seat and the woman in front of me had put
her seat far enough back that her head was in my lap,
I wanted to kill someone.
Of course I'm bitter and belligerent and conde
scending, that's what New York does to me, and that's
why I left. The martian death flu I've contracted just
makes it worse. All this compounded by the teeny tiny
seats on the 757 I'm strapped into, the people walk
ing in the aisle who keep bumping into me, Jabba who
is clearly taking up more than one seat, and this sear
ing headache that makes smashing my head into a
wall repeatedly sound pleasant.
There was one thing that made it all bearable, one
thing that prevented me from doing anything that vi
olated FAA regulations. It was the beautiful girl I had
waiting for me in California. I can't imagine anything
more wonderful than having someone you love wait
ing for you by baggage claim who's ready to brush
away all the troubles and aches of a long crossconti
nental flight and make you realize why you get up in
the mornings.
It's good to be back. I mean sure, there's the lush
campus whose clean air I can feel cleansing my body
with each lungfull, washing out the dingy New York
air which accounted for my newly discovered "New
