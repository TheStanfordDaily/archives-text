# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Fiction, fairytales and philosophy 
### 
If you're lazy like me, your winter break was a se
ries of family obligations punctuated by extend
ed periods of watching a lot of TV — true bliss
for the Stanford student who regularly worships
at the altar of productivity. So I watched quite a few
movies while I was at home. After a particularly glut
tonous binge — a three-hour, two-DVD "Buffy" sea-

son marathon — 1 got all philosoph
ical. That tends to happen to me
when my brain has turned to mush.
I thought to myself, this is the
wasteland that is our bourgeois
American society. (Bear in mind, this
is the brain-mush talking.) Is this
what happens in homes across the
country? People come home from
work and they watch television. Or

they read books, which in some cases is nominally bet
ter, I guess.
But the point is that we spend a lot of our free time
not-being. We spend a lot of time in worlds not of our
own, but of somebody else's invention. And in my
mushified state, it made me sad that I had wasted
three hours living in another world — and even
worse, I liked that world better than my own, vam
pires and all. Being inside the stories gives me a thrill
that real life doesn't. And that's so ridiculous. What's
so bad about this world that we have to make up sto
ries to escape it?
I could take this opportunity to ramble about how
America is such a soulless evil empire with no sense of
community and all of your close friends leave you so
all that's left is your nuclear family unit and even
that's so soulless that the whole family just sits around
watching TV together, and that's what's wrong with
society today and that's why we make up stories, be
cause life sucks and then you die.
But that would be boring and pretentious, not to
mention untrue. People made up stories long be
fore the Industrial Revolution, long before capital
ism, long before commerce, so there's gotta be
more to it than that. There's more to the stories
than pure escapism.
There's a wealth of stories out there, more than

enough to fill a thousand libraries, and on top of the
stories there's criticism, and criticism of the criticism.
And the stories are all connected, because maybe one
writer read an older story and that story made her
want to write her own story, and that connects those
two. And maybe another writer read the same story as
a kid and writes his own story, so all three stories are
connected.
And on a bigger scale, all the stories are connected
because they all draw upon the tiling we call human
experience, and whether or not we can say that any
thing is universal, we can say that things relate to each
other in the real world, just as they do in the story
world.
Anyone who's ever considered creative writing as a
professional pursuit has come up against the wall of
utility. How could this thing I made up and wrote
down possibly be useful to anybody, and if it c an't be
useful then how ridiculous is it that 1 should get paid
for this? Fairytales, movies, television — none of that
seems all that useful on the surface. Somehow it seems
low. Uneducated.
Books have somehow escaped that stigma, except
for romance novels and science fiction and fantasy.
But anyway, we sit down to read a trashy summer
novel and afterward we feel like there are more use
ful things that could have been done in that time.
But then, every once in a while, you read a book
or you watch a movie that really touches you, and
you walk away not feeling empty inside, but full of
excitement and warmth. Or maybe not warmth, be
cause it was a sad story, but a sense of connection
with some fundamental human truth. Something in
the story struck a note that resonated in your body,
right from the top of your head to the tips of your
toes.
You feel smarter, and at the same time, dumb
struck by how amazing the world is and how it all con
nects together, and wow, that was such a good story,
and it was so well written that it made you feel like it
was the greatest story ever told, instead of some little
thing about a boy and a girl or whatever. That great-

est story is told again and again, every day
of our lives. It's the story of human exis
tence, and we can't get enough of it. We
eat it up like candy.
Or a better analogy would be that we
eat it up like complex carbohydrates. It
sustains us, and just as surely as we need
bread to eat or water to drink, we need the
stories to tell us who we are and where to
stand.

I can't be the first person to have ever
thought these thoughts and written them
clown. But let me tell you, it's so easy while
we're here or even out in the real world to
forget why the stories are there in the first
place. We read something for class, we get
bogged down in having to analyze it and
criticize it, and we fall out of love with the
stories.
We put this academic distance between
ourselves and what we're reading or
watching, and that may be more useful
when it comes to writing papers, but it's
also a little bit tragic.
I think it's important to remember that,
once upon a time, we did love the stories.

We loved them so much that we would
want to hear them again and again, and
they only got better each time. Maybe I'm
kidding myself here, that there's no way I
could ever possibly love a book I'm read
ing for class the way I love "Harry Potter"
or " The Lord of the Rings." But ill have
to choose between living an illusion and
loving it, or living in a soulless reality, well,
you know what my choice is. What's
yours?
