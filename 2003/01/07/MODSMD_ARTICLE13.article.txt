Gender discrimination prevalent in
Selective Service guidelines
Every man in the United States 18 to 25
years of age is required to register for the
Selective Service, and thereby subject him
self to the possibility of involuntary mili
tary service. Yet, on the eve of war with
Iraq, the prosecution of which may re
quire millions of U.S. military personnel,
no woman in the U.S. is required to regis
ter. This clear fact of gender discrimina
tion has not been focused upon in public
discussions, 1 believe, because an active
draft has not been in effect since 1973.
The United States Selective Service Sys
tem offers on its Web site a short history of
the draft with respect to women. The pri
mary reason given for non-registration of
women is a 20-year-old Supreme Court de
cision, Rostker v. Goldberg. Simply stated,
this decision says that since all men regis
tered with the Selective Service are consid
ered combat replacements, and since
Congress forbids women to go into combat,
women should not be registered. Of
course, this reasoning is absolutely absurd,
since it presupposes that every man called
for involuntary military service will be used
for combat, and that no man called will be
used for the approximately 90 percent of
militaryjobs which are non-combat related.
Some questions arise as a result of this
blatant fact of gender discrimination:
1. While U.S. women enjoy exactly the
same civil rights as U.S. men, why is the
pretext of a ridiculous Supreme Court de
cision used to exempt the majority of the
population, i.e. females, from even the
possibility of involuntary military service
in any capacity?
2. Should women be permitted to vote
in elections for candidates who may have
to decide on war for our country, when
women will never serve involuntarily in
any military conflict?
3. Title IX demands that proportion
ately equal funds be used for school-based
athletics for males and females. Many
schools have had to abandon male team
sports that earn revenue in excess of their
costs and which aid in the preparation of
males for the teamwork and organization
of military service, in order to provide
gender-equal funding for female sports
which perennially lose revenue. Yet there
is no requirement for females to utilize the
skills and strengths learned on the athletic
field in the military defense of their coun
try. Should Title IX continue?
4. Do equal civil rights for women obli
gate women to equal civil responsibilities?

Ethnic theme houses 'perpetuate fears
and biases'
As a former resident of an ethnic
theme house, I disagree with the Dec. 4
editorial ("Dorms with ethnic themes
not 'segregationist' "). Diversity comes
from the natural melting pot selection of
Stanford's student body, and the hous
ing system's segregation of races perpet
uates fears and biases. Perhaps Stanford
was not a melting pot 30 years ago when
these houses started; one would be hard
pressed to make the same argument
today.
The editorial mentions that there
are language-based houses. The differ
ence is that all of those students choose
to live in the language houses (and are
bound by their choice of second lan
guage rather than the color of their
skin), while half of the students in the
ethnic houses by and large do not
choose to live there. We preach that we
should all live and work together in
harmony in the real world, but in prac
tice the housing system seems to pro
mote the opposite.
The editorial also states, "Ethnic
theme houses [. . .] aren't meant to seg
regate." The road to mediocrity is paved
with good intentions.

Fisk displays typical liberal biases
In his interview with The Daily ("Fisk
criticizes U.S. media in interview," Dec. 4),
Robert Fisk displays the arrogance and bi
ases that are typical of the liberal cultural
elite. On the issue of Iraq,Fisk encourages
"activists and academics" (translation:
campus liberals) to reach out to the gener
al U.S. population and start a "discussion"
on Iraq.
Nevermind the fact that the latest
polls indicate that 67 percent of Ameri
cans support a ground war in Iraq. See,
in the eyes of Robert Fisk and his high
brow liberal pals, common Americans
are ignorant buffoons who cannot rea
son without proper guidance from the
liberal academics. And, of course, any
opinion that ordinary Americans form
cannot be considered valid unless it cor
responds to Robert Fisk's distorted no
tion of reality.
How pathetic that this is the view of a
man who claims to be the voice of objectiv
ity in journalism, the man whom The
Daily unflinchingly adulates in every sin
gle article about him! But at least now we

know the truth about Robert Fi.sk.

'Research endeavors in climate change
are essential'
In response to the Dec. 4 article on cor
porate funding for the G-CEP project
("Skeptics question G-CEP sponsorship"),
the shift away from non-renewable energy
sources such as fossil fuels is an inevitable
change that the oil industry would be
naive to neglect. With this in mind, the
support of environmental and energy re
search by these companies should be seen
as a step in the right direction.
On a political level, the environmental
impact of fossil fuel consumption is too
large to ignore and a viable plan for re
placing deleterious energy production
technologies wit h clean, renewable energy
sources should be an international priori
ty. To this end, research endeavors in
global climate change and energy produc
tion are essential. If we are to wean our
selves off this nasty oil addiction, we must

have reasonable alternatives. The future
of the existing technologies (such as solar,
wind and hydrogen) and those that will
arise from future research is dependent
on adequate funding, regardless of the
source. And whether we like it or not, the
sector with the greatest vested interest in
energy production technologies is the oil
industry. As such, instead of attacking cor
porate sponsorship of the G-CEP as a po
tential conflict of interest (which it certain
ly appears to be), we should take advan
tage of this opportunity to do environ
mentally conscious research that will have
the potential to address climate change in
the context of energy production.
Indeed, companies like ExxonMobil
are well aware that fossil fuels are a non-re
newable resource, and would be not only
short sighted but ultimately suicidal to ne
glect more sustainable alternatives. We
can thus be encouraged that at least some
portion of the funding will go toward this
goal. Furthermore, as David Victor points
out, the energy companies are also very
aware that the Bush administration's apa
thy toward environmental damage is by
no means an indication of future govern
ment policy, and these companies are

therefore seeking to "get out in front" of
future environmental regulations. While
we may not agree with these political mo
tivations, a hint of reform is there.
All this, combined with the freedom the
sponsoring companies claim they will
allow researchers, indicates that research
under the G-CEP will have a progressive
tone and will undoubtedly yield profound
results in the area of renewable resources.
Nevertheless, we also have reason to be
hopeful for research in the area of mini
mizing the environmental impact of cur
rent production methods as well.
Whether corporate sponsorship of G
CEP is a genuine attempt to solve envi
ronmental problems, or simply a public
relations ploy, the funding is there and
should be taken advantage of. By all
means, we should be wary of the corpora
tions' control over the flow of resources
and rights to information and technology.
In addition, the clause that allows the
sponsors to withdraw funding after three
years is disconcerting. However, I am
hopeful that researchers will use G-CEP
funding toward developing environmen
