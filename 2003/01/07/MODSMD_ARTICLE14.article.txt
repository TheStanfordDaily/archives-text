## Getting ahead of the biowarfare threat 
### BRUCE BERKOWITZ GUEST COLUMNIST 
President Bush has approved a plan to
inoculate 500,000 U.S. military personnel
against smallpox. The president, as com
mander in chief, will be vaccinated along
with the troops. He also plans to make the
vaccine available to up to 10 million public
safety workers.
The White House fears terrorists or
rogue states may resort to biowarfare. De
veloping the policy took months of delib
eration. When you consider the issues in
volved, you can see why.
The smallpox vaccine (like many
drugs) has side effects. Historically, the
current vaccine has caused about one to
two deaths per million recipients. Simple
math suggests that this would total be
tween 300 and 600 deaths if the entire
American population were vaccinated.
Thus ordering a mass vaccination pro
gram is not a trivial decision. But Iraq,
North Korea and several terrorist groups
are known to be exploring biological
weapons. The United States needs a cadre
of people who can respond to an attack.
Smallpox could be an especially grue
some weapon. It is highly contagious and

kills about a third of those infected. Those
who survive are usually scarred, and
many are crippled or blinded. Before a
vaccine was invented in 1796, smallpox
often killed hundreds of thousands of
people each year.
The disease was considered eradicated
almost a quarter century ago. Today the
only specimens of smallpox virus exist in
labs in the United States and Russia, at
least, the only known specimens.
And that's the problem. We must be
prepared for the chance that somehow
Iraq, North Korea or al-Qaida has been
able either to steal a sample of the virus or
found some specimen that managed to es
cape eradication.
U.S. leaders today must deal with
threats that are ambiguous, debatable,
hard to verify but that could amass huge
costs. Many other biological agents such as
anthrax, Ebola and plague could also be
turned into weapons. Furthermore, many
chemical, radiological and nuclear
weapons can be developed covertly.
The smallpox decision is the kind of
complex national security calculation we
can expect more of. Such decisions re
quire public education, consensus build
ing and innovative thinking so as to limit

risks without undo costs to the economy or
burdens on the public. The most impor
tant ingredient, however, is leadership.
For years officials have expected the in
telligence community to provide "action
able intelligence" data so specific and un
ambiguous that the U.S. response would
be obvious and unarguable. With today's
threats, that is hard to provide and we
should not expect it.
The best we can hope for is "inferential
intelligence," whereby intelligence orga
nizations indicate where the hard evi
dence leads and describe the possible
threats that could result. Then officials
must fill in the gray areas and decide how
to respond.
September 11 showed what happens
when you ignore an enemy abroad who
threatens America. Taking action before
an attack occurs may be the biggest and
most important challenge of all.
