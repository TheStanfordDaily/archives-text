## Wildcats, Ducks shoot for title 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As freshmen and sophomores around the country
light up the scoreboards, dish out the assists and quick
ly fill the star-studded spots left by older teammates
who opt out for the NBA Draft, the Pacific-10 Confer
ence is beginning to look like the NCAA equivalent of a
pot-belly league.
A host of seniors and a handful of juniors — many
of whom have spent three, four, even five years playing
college ball — are t he focal point of nearly every Pac-10
team's program.
The undeniable conference favorite is an experi
enced Arizona squad. The Jason Gardner-Luke Wal
ton duo is perhaps the most heralded veteran pairing
in the nation.
Gardner, an impeccable ball-handler, can score
from almost anywhere on the court as well as provide
immeasurable value as point guard.
Walton is renowned for his versatility, shooting, re
bounding and passing, with the fundamental edge that
comes with being the son of one of the NBA's greats.
However, the early season has seen Walton on the side
lines with an injured right ankle. He played a pair of
games in late December, but reinjured the ankle and is

out indefinitely.

Even without Walton, Arizona is a force to con-

tend with, as senior Rick Anderson and sopho-

mores Salim Stoudamire, Isaiah Fox and Chan-

ning Frye are all capable of making an impact.
Add freshman guard Hassan Adams and
freshman forward Andre Iguodala to the mix
and you have two newcomers putting up

major numbers for one of the best teams in the J

nation.
But despite standing at No. 1 in the pre- j

season rankings, the Wildcats proved their I
vulnerability with an early loss to unranked

Louisiana State late last month.
The Wildcats still needed just one confer- 1
ence game to establish themselves as the Pac- 1
10's top dog. For the first time in four years, '
the team beat Oregon on the Ducks' infamous

Mac Arthur Court, demolishing Oregon's 23-

game home winning streak and beating ar-

guably their most talented conference rival.

Despite the huge conference opening, Arizona

head coach Lute Olson realizes that there are a lot
of games to be played.

of games to be played.

"I think too much can be made out of just one
game," Olson said before his Wildcats beat Oregon 81-
72 in the Pac-10 opener for both schools last Thursday.
"It might be different if it was 14 games ... We've had

tough opening games before and there are obvious
ramifications, but it's not like we're going to make this
a do-or-die situation."
And despite their home loss, the Ducks aren't any
thing to take lightly. Playing one of the toughest early
season schedules in the nation, Oregon currently sits at
No. 12 in the nation.
The Ducks are led by a backcourt pair that rivals the
Gardner-Walton duo in juniors Luke Ridnour and
Luke Jackson. The two average 19.2 and 17.5 points
per game, respectively, while dealing out their fair
share of assists.
If Oregon can find a consistent big man, it will be
hard to deny it a spot at the top of the conference, if not
the top of the nation.
While there is a general consensus that Oregon and
Arizona have a lock on the top two spots, the third
through seventh spots in the conference are where
things begin to get tricky.
As the Pac-10 suffers its lowest conference ranking in
years, California, Arizona State, Southern California,

Stanford and UCLA are all eager to distinguish them
selves and assure themselves a place in the NCAA tour
nament.
Despite entering conference play with a dreadful 2-
5 record, Steve Lavin's Bruins emerged from the first
weekend of Pac-10 action 2-0, with victories over Wash
ington and Washington State.
Senior forward Jason Kapono is back, as evidenced
in his 44-point performance over the Cougars, but the
majority of the other cast members from last year's
squad are not available to draw defenders away from
the sharp-shooter.
"I still like the prospects and balance of our team,"

Lavin said. "But we have struggled.

We knew that losing Dan

Gadzuric, and Matt

Barnes, and Billy

Knight and

Rico Hines

wou 1 d

make

things

difficult.

But it's a chal-

lenge and that is

why you coach. You

have to rebuild and reload

and find that chemistry that is so

allusive."

UCLA suffered an early blow when heralded recruit
Evan Burns was forced to enroll at San Diego State
after UCLA denied him admission in September due
to his failure to meet initial eligibility requirements.
The Bruins' Los Angeles counterpart, USC, didn't
fair so well in the northwest, suffering a loss to Wash
ington in opening the season at 1-1. The Trojans
haven't lived up to early-season expectations after
being picked by many to finish third in the conference.
