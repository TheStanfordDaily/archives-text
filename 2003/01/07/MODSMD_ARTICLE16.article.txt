# Women aim for head of Pac

### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, the Stanford women's basketball team fin
ished 20-1 against Pacific-10 Conference teams — its
only loss a 70-63 decision to Arizona State in the finals
of the Pac-10 tournament.
According to Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Pac-10 was more challenging than Stan
ford's impressive record suggested. She points out that
at least five of Stanford's victories were by a small mar
gin and could have gone either way.
Still, the Pac-10 was only the ninth-ranked confer-

ence in the nation last year. Stanford

and Arizona State were the

only teams from the Pac-

10 to have a RIM in

the top 50 and

also the only

t wo

teams

to make

the NCAA

tournament.

W ashington

was left out of the big

dance despite tying Arizona

State with a 12-6 conference

record, while Georgia made it in with a 6-8

record from the SEC.
Because the NCAA selection committee puts a lot of
weight on the strength of schedule variable in handing
out bids to the tournament, Pac-10 teams have made a
concerted effort to schedule tougher non-conference
opponents this year.
Already this season, No. (5 Stanford has competed
against four top-25 opponents — in all of last season,
the Cardinal played only three.
For the Pac-10, tougher competition will mean a
better national reputation and improved overall play.

Currently, the Pac-10 is the sixth-ranked conference
nationally.
I laving already dispatched two tough Pac-10 teams,
Arizona and Arizona State, Stanford (2-0 Pac-10) is
once again heavily favored to win the conference.
"We are used to being a target. Every team is
going to come out and play us hard," said junior for
ward Nicole Powell, a national player of the year can
didate. "If a team beats Stanford, it is going to make
their season."
Despite its solid start, Stanford is still two games back
of UCLA, which is already off to a 4-0 sun t in confer
ence play. .After a dismal 9-20 finish last year, UCLA (9-
4 overall) is currently the only undefeated team in the
Pac-10 besides Stanford.
Boosted by 5-foot-9 senior guard Michelle Creco,
who sat out most of last season with recurring concus
sions, and 5-8 freshman guard Nikki Blue, UCLA has
already shellacked Oregon, Washington and Washing-

ton State and narrowly edged Oregon State.
Greco is averaging a conference-leading 19.1 points
per game while Blue is contributing 15.6 points per
game. UCLA is at the top of the Pac-10 in scoring of
fense.
Here is a look at the rest of the Pac-10 teams, listed
in order of the current conference standings:

Arizona (3-1 Pac-10)

No. 20 Arizona (9-3), whom the Cardinal faces

again on Feb. 27, is expected to provide the great-

est challenge to Stanford's repeat bid.

Led by 6-5 freshman center Shawntinice
Polk's 18.8 points and 12.2 rebounds per game,
the Wildcats have already defeated 24th-ranked
Georgia and lost in overtime to No. 2 Louisiana
State. Folk has already been selected Pac-10
Player of the Week twice, making her the first
freshman to be awarded this honor since Stan
ford's Powell two seasons ago.
Arizona also returns last year's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, 5-6 sophomore guard
Dee-Dee Wheeler (15.4 ppg), and 6-2 senior
Krista Warren (13.5 ppg and 6.8 rpg).

Washington (2-1)

Washington's recent 46-72 drubbing at the

hands of UCLA marked its first loss since Nov. 24,

when the Huskies dropped a 67-99 decision to No.

8 Texas Tec h.

However, the Huskies' 9-2 overall record reflects
a relatively easy non-conference schedule, and Wash
ington can't boast any victories over a current top-25
team.
Senior guard Loree Payne leads an offensively
loaded Huskies team in scoring with 16 points per
game (fourth in the Pac-10).
Washington also returns first-team All-Pac 10 selec
tion 5-11 junior guard Giuliana Mendiola from a team
that made it to the third round of the WNIT last year
before losing to eventual winner Oregon 73-77.
Arizona State (2-2)
At 10-3 overall, Arizona State has spent the season
on the brink of a top-25 ranking. But despite an im
pressive win-loss record, the Sun Devils have only the
92nd-best RPI ranking in the country.
Having graduated its two leading scorers from last
year, Arizona State is relying on three 112 reshmen to pick
up the slack: 5-10 guard Jill Noe, 6-1 forward Amy
Denson and 6-3 center Kristen Kovesdy, who average
15.3,12.3 and 11.3 points per game, respectively. Noe
has already received a Pac-10 Player of the Week
award.
California (1-1)
With seven sophomores return
ing from last year's young Cal
squad, Vanl)eiveer predicted that
the Golden Bears would be on the
rise this season.
"Cal has an excellent coach, and
they had seven freshmen last year
who now have a year of experience
under their belts," a diplomatic
VanDerveer said.
With a 5-6 overall record and
No. 116 RIM ranking (second worst
in the Pac-10), Cal has not lived up
to expectations so far.
Sophomore forward Leigh Gre
gory leads a sparse Cal offense with
10.1 points per game.
The Golden Bears rank eighth
in the Pac-10 in scoring offense
ahead of only Oregon State and
Washington Suite.
Cal's one bright spot so far this
season was a 72-07 victory over Ari
zona State.
Oregon State (1-3)
Despite leading the Pac-10 in
scoring defense, Oregon State has
given up conference losses to Ari
zona (44-72), Arizona State (58-70)
and UCLA (54-58) already this sea
son. The Beavers' only Pac-10 vic
tory so far came in a close 63-61 de
cision against USC.
Oregon State has been more
successful outside the Pac-10 and
currently holds a 7-0 overall
record.
The Beavers are lead by three
juniors: 6-0 forward Hollye Chap
man (10.2 ppg), 5-7 guard Lielani
Estavan (10.1 ppg) and 6-5 center
Brina Chaney (9.8 ppg).
Southern California (1-3)
Having assembled one of the
toughest non-conference schedules
in the nation, USC has had an up
and-down season thus far.
The Women of Troy have beat
en two tough teams, New Mexico

and Pepperdine, but also lost con
vincingly to four top-10 teams: Con
necticut, Tennessee, Kansas State
and Notre Dame.
L'he USC lineup features All-
America candidate Ebony Hoff
man (14.8 ppg and 9.6 rpg) and
has been bolstered recently by the
addition of Duke transfer Rometra
Craig (16.7 ppg since joining the
team midseason).
Oregon (1-3)
After winning last year's
WNIT tournament, Oregon
opened this season with a disap
pointing 5-8 record overall, fea
turing Pac-10 losses to UCLA (68-
93), Arizona (65-96) and Arizona
state (63-78).
The Ducks are led by explosive

6-0 sophomore guard Brandi Davis
(10.5 ppg) and 6-3 freshman center
Carolyn Ganes (9.4 ppg).
The Ducks have been sitting on a
72.9 average points allowed, sec
ond-worst in the Pac-10.
Adding injury to insult, ()regon's
leading scorer (>athrine Kraayeveld
(16.7 ppg) will be out for five weeks
with a spleen infection.
Washington State (0-3)
Washington State is at the bot
tom of the Pac-10 in both scoring
offense and scoring defense, has
not won a game all season and is
riding a 35-game losing streak.
Twenty-three more games
like this and the Cougars will
have the Division I record for
consecutive losses.

they had seven freshmen last year
who now have a year of experience
under their belts," a diplomatic
VanDerveer said.
With a 5-6 overall record and
No. 116 RIM ranking (second worst
in the Pac-10), Cal has not lived up
to expectations so far.
Sophomore forward Leigh Gre

10.1 points per game.
The Golden Bears rank eighth

Despite leading the Pac-10 in
scoring defense, Oregon State has
given up conference losses to Ari
zona (44-72), Arizona State (58-70)
and UCLA (54-58) already this sea

Oregon State has been more
successful outside the Pac-10 and
currently holds a 7-0 overall
record.
The Beavers are lead by three
juniors: 6-0 forward Hollye Chap

Estavan (10.1 ppg) and 6-5 center
Brina Chaney (9.8 ppg).
Southern California (1-3)
Having assembled one of the
toughest non-conference schedules
in the nation, USC has had an up
and-down season thus far.
The Women of Troy have beat
en two tough teams, New Mexico

and Pepperdine, but also lost con
vincingly to four top-10 teams: Con
necticut, Tennessee, Kansas State
and Notre Dame.
L'he USC lineup features All-
America candidate Ebony Hoff
man (14.8 ppg and 9.6 rpg) and
has been bolstered recently by the
addition of Duke transfer Rometra
Craig (16.7 ppg since joining the
team midseason).
Oregon (1-3)
After winning last year's
WNIT tournament, Oregon
opened this season with a disap
pointing 5-8 record overall, fea
turing Pac-10 losses to UCLA (68-
93), Arizona (65-96) and Arizona
state (63-78).
The Ducks are led by explosive

6-0 sophomore guard Brandi Davis

Twenty-three more games
like this and the Cougars will
have the Division I record for
consecutive losses.

Sophomore guard Sebnem Kimyacioglu dribbles past a Rutgers defender.
Kim/acioglu and the rest of the Cardinal look to defend their Pac-10 regular
season title and win the conference tournament.
Last year, the Stanford women's basketball team fin
ished 20-1 against Pacific-10 Conference teams — its
only loss a 70-63 decision to Arizona State in the finals
of the Pac-10 tournament.
According to Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Pac-10 was more challenging than Stan
ford's impressive record suggested. She points out that
at least five of Stanford's victories were by a small mar
gin and could have gone either way.
Still, the Pac-10 was only the ninth-ranked confer-

ence in the nation last year. Stanford

and Arizona State were the

only teams from the Pac-

10 to have a RIM in

the top 50 and

also the only

t wo

teams

to make

the NCAA

tournament.

W ashington

was left out of the big

dance despite tying Arizona

State with a 12-6 conference

record, while Georgia made it in with a 6-8

record from the SEC.
Because the NCAA selection committee puts a lot of
weight on the strength of schedule variable in handing
out bids to the tournament, Pac-10 teams have made a
concerted effort to schedule tougher non-conference
opponents this year.
Already this season, No. (5 Stanford has competed
against four top-25 opponents — in all of last season,
the Cardinal played only three.
For the Pac-10, tougher competition will mean a
better national reputation and improved overall play.

Currently, the Pac-10 is the sixth-ranked conference
nationally.
I laving already dispatched two tough Pac-10 teams,
Arizona and Arizona State, Stanford (2-0 Pac-10) is
once again heavily favored to win the conference.
"We are used to being a target. Every team is
going to come out and play us hard," said junior for
ward Nicole Powell, a national player of the year can
didate. "If a team beats Stanford, it is going to make
their season."
Despite its solid start, Stanford is still two games back
of UCLA, which is already off to a 4-0 sun t in confer
ence play. .After a dismal 9-20 finish last year, UCLA (9-
4 overall) is currently the only undefeated team in the
Pac-10 besides Stanford.
Boosted by 5-foot-9 senior guard Michelle Creco,
who sat out most of last season with recurring concus
sions, and 5-8 freshman guard Nikki Blue, UCLA has
already shellacked Oregon, Washington and Washing-

ton State and narrowly edged Oregon State.
Greco is averaging a conference-leading 19.1 points
per game while Blue is contributing 15.6 points per
game. UCLA is at the top of the Pac-10 in scoring of
fense.
Here is a look at the rest of the Pac-10 teams, listed
in order of the current conference standings:

Arizona (3-1 Pac-10)

No. 20 Arizona (9-3), whom the Cardinal faces

again on Feb. 27, is expected to provide the great-

est challenge to Stanford's repeat bid.

Led by 6-5 freshman center Shawntinice
Polk's 18.8 points and 12.2 rebounds per game,
the Wildcats have already defeated 24th-ranked
Georgia and lost in overtime to No. 2 Louisiana
State. Folk has already been selected Pac-10
Player of the Week twice, making her the first
freshman to be awarded this honor since Stan
ford's Powell two seasons ago.
Arizona also returns last year's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, 5-6 sophomore guard
Dee-Dee Wheeler (15.4 ppg), and 6-2 senior
Krista Warren (13.5 ppg and 6.8 rpg).

Washington (2-1)

Washington's recent 46-72 drubbing at the

hands of UCLA marked its first loss since Nov. 24,

when the Huskies dropped a 67-99 decision to No.

8 Texas Tec h.

However, the Huskies' 9-2 overall record reflects
a relatively easy non-conference schedule, and Wash
ington can't boast any victories over a current top-25
team.
Senior guard Loree Payne leads an offensively
loaded Huskies team in scoring with 16 points per
game (fourth in the Pac-10).
Washington also returns first-team All-Pac 10 selec
tion 5-11 junior guard Giuliana Mendiola from a team
that made it to the third round of the WNIT last year
before losing to eventual winner Oregon 73-77.
Arizona State (2-2)
At 10-3 overall, Arizona State has spent the season
on the brink of a top-25 ranking. But despite an im
pressive win-loss record, the Sun Devils have only the
92nd-best RPI ranking in the country.
Having graduated its two leading scorers from last
year, Arizona State is relying on three 112 reshmen to pick
up the slack: 5-10 guard Jill Noe, 6-1 forward Amy
