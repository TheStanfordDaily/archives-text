# Women aim for head of Pac
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, the Stanford women's basketball team fin
ished 20-1 against Pacific-10 Conference teams — its
only loss a 70-63 decision to Arizona State in the finals
of the Pac-10 tournament.
According to Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the Pac-10 was more challenging than Stan
ford's impressive record suggested. She points out that
at least five of Stanford's victories were by a small mar
gin and could have gone either way.
Still, the Pac-10 was only the ninth-ranked confer-

ence in the nation last year. Stanford

and Arizona State were the

only teams from the Pac-

10 to have a RIM in

the top 50 and

also the only

t wo

teams

to make

the NCAA

tournament.

W ashington

was left out of the big

dance despite tying Arizona

State with a 12-6 conference

record, while Georgia made it in with a 6-8

record from the SEC.
Because the NCAA selection committee puts a lot of
weight on the strength of schedule variable in handing
out bids to the tournament, Pac-10 teams have made a
concerted effort to schedule tougher non-conference
opponents this year.
Already this season, No. (5 Stanford has competed
against four top-25 opponents — in all of last season,
the Cardinal played only three.
For the Pac-10, tougher competition will mean a
better national reputation and improved overall play.

Currently, the Pac-10 is the sixth-ranked conference
nationally.
I laving already dispatched two tough Pac-10 teams,
Arizona and Arizona State, Stanford (2-0 Pac-10) is
once again heavily favored to win the conference.
"We are used to being a target. Every team is
going to come out and play us hard," said junior for
ward Nicole Powell, a national player of the year can
didate. "If a team beats Stanford, it is going to make
their season."
Despite its solid start, Stanford is still two games back
of UCLA, which is already off to a 4-0 sun t in confer
ence play. .After a dismal 9-20 finish last year, UCLA (9-
4 overall) is currently the only undefeated team in the
Pac-10 besides Stanford.
Boosted by 5-foot-9 senior guard Michelle Creco,
who sat out most of last season with recurring concus
sions, and 5-8 freshman guard Nikki Blue, UCLA has
already shellacked Oregon, Washington and Washing-

ton State and narrowly edged Oregon State.
Greco is averaging a conference-leading 19.1 points
per game while Blue is contributing 15.6 points per
game. UCLA is at the top of the Pac-10 in scoring of
fense.
Here is a look at the rest of the Pac-10 teams, listed
in order of the current conference standings:

Arizona (3-1 Pac-10)

No. 20 Arizona (9-3), whom the Cardinal faces

again on Feb. 27, is expected to provide the great-

est challenge to Stanford's repeat bid.

Led by 6-5 freshman center Shawntinice
Polk's 18.8 points and 12.2 rebounds per game,
the Wildcats have already defeated 24th-ranked
Georgia and lost in overtime to No. 2 Louisiana
State. Folk has already been selected Pac-10
Player of the Week twice, making her the first
freshman to be awarded this honor since Stan
ford's Powell two seasons ago.
Arizona also returns last year's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, 5-6 sophomore guard
Dee-Dee Wheeler (15.4 ppg), and 6-2 senior
Krista Warren (13.5 ppg and 6.8 rpg).

Washington (2-1)

Washington's recent 46-72 drubbing at the

hands of UCLA marked its first loss since Nov. 24,

when the Huskies dropped a 67-99 decision to No.

8 Texas Tec h.

However, the Huskies' 9-2 overall record reflects
a relatively easy non-conference schedule, and Wash
ington can't boast any victories over a current top-25
team.
Senior guard Loree Payne leads an offensively
loaded Huskies team in scoring with 16 points per
game (fourth in the Pac-10).
Washington also returns first-team All-Pac 10 selec
tion 5-11 junior guard Giuliana Mendiola from a team
that made it to the third round of the WNIT last year
before losing to eventual winner Oregon 73-77.
Arizona State (2-2)
At 10-3 overall, Arizona State has spent the season
on the brink of a top-25 ranking. But despite an im
pressive win-loss record, the Sun Devils have only the
92nd-best RPI ranking in the country.
Having graduated its two leading scorers from last
year, Arizona State is relying on three 112 reshmen to pick
up the slack: 5-10 guard Jill Noe, 6-1 forward Amy
Denson and 6-3 center Kristen Kovesdy, who average
15.3,12.3 and 11.3 points per game, respectively. Noe
has already received a Pac-10 Player of the Week
award.
