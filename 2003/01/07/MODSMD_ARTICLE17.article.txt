# Please Tiger, take social responsibility
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Tiger Woods:
I am writing this letter as a follow
up to recent columns that have
appeared in The New York
Times asking for you to skip the
Masters until the Augusta National
Country Club begins admitting female
members. I urge you, Mr. Woods, if
there be any decency in your bones,
that you honor the request of The New
York Times and excuse yourself from
your sport's most prestigious event. I
feel that such an appeal is not an exces
sive demand, but rather merely a start
ing point from which your social con
science must undergo the awakening it
needs to be commensurate with your
standing in society.
You see Mr. Woods, being the
world's No. 1 golfer does not come
without its responsibilities. The mere
fact that you can hit a small, white,
spherical object into a small metallic
cylinder with more power and accura
cy than anyone else on the planet right
fully makes you a champion of the so
cial causes of this nation, whether you
like it or not. We didn't fight a revolu
tion, create a new form of government
and undergo massive social reforms
over a period of several centuries just
so that our nation's top ball-striker
would shirk his responsibilities and
leave them to elected officials and civic
leaders.

Everyday in this
world, millions face
discrimination in some
form or another,
whether it be women
trying to get into Au
gusta National or
obese people trying to
get into those impossi
bly small seats at movie

/
theaters or on airplanes. Yet you idly
sit by and watch as those of us less for
tunate than you are made to suffer at
the hands of cruel oppressors.
Well, Mr. Woods, I say it is time you
ascended to your rightful place as pro
tector of social justice that we reserve
for all of our top I'CA tour pros, like
we did with Jack Nicklaus before you,
and Arnold Palmer before him. And
Fuzzy Zoeller.
So I will now urge you to not only
boycott the Masters, but to take on
other responsibilities as well. First and
foremost, I think you should boycott
Nike. That name has become synony
mous with child labor and unfair trade
practices, and your association with
this organization is absolutely inappro
priate. What decent human being
would put $100 million endorsement
contracts over the well-being of kids in
Third World countries? Certainly
none of the rest of your fellow country
men would stoop so low as to obtain
wealth beyond their wildest dreams

without first taking into account the
welfare of a bunch of people that they
have never met.
In addition, 1 implore you to termi
nate your affiliation with Buick based
on that company's blatant discrimina
tion against poor people. Are you
aware of how many poor people can af
ford Buicks, Mr. Woods? Zero. Why, I
heard a story just the other day of a
poor person walking into a Buick deal
ership and demanding that he be al
lowed to exercise that basic human
right of obtaining a brand new Regal
with leather interior, wood paneling
and six-disc CI) changer, and the sales
man refused to grant him one just be
cause he didn't have any money. By
promoting their products, you are per
petuating this outright discrimination
against our nation's poor, and setting
back the dream of Buick ownership for
thousands of indigent drivers.
I am also disturbed by your associa
tion with Stanford University, as it is a
well-known fact that Stanford
unashamedly discriminates against stu
pid people. I've heard tales that only the
best of the best can go to Stanford, and
that stupid people have little chance of
being admitted. I experienced personal
hardship in this issue, when one of my
friend's kids, who happens to be dumb
as a rock, applied to Stanford and was
