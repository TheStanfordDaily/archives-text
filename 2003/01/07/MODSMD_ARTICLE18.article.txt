# Cardinal squash club finds success at the national level
## 
### CHRIS FESENMAIER SPECIAL TO THE DAILY 
While Stanford likes to maintain its West
Coast identity as separate from its eastern Ivy
League counterparts, the University doesn't
really mind trying out some of their sports.
The Stanford squash program is consistent
with that trend, virtually introducing the
West Coast to the fast-paced game and, in
Cardinal athletics style, ascending to nation
al status.
The team, which started in 1998, is
coached by Richard Elliot, the top-ranked
over-35 player in the country who brings
years of professional experience to the Farm.
Under the leadership of junior captains
Rich Sherwood, Sam Gellman and Paul
Valiant, the men's team has already broken
into the nation's top 20 and is eyeing the
Summers Division trophy.
In addition to the captains, who occupy
the No. 1 through No. 3 positions on the
team, respectively, the team is also led by the
recent addition of freshman Aaron Lingon at
the No. 4 spot and a much-improved Tim
I lolme, who plays at No. 5
Rounding out the Cardinal ranks are ju
nior Justin Durack in the sixth position, No.
7 Chris Fesenmaier, No. 8 Alex Marshall and
No. 9 Mike Asmar.
Starting the season ranked No. 22 in the
nation, Stanford has moved up to No. 19
after a c lose vic tory over No. 21 fufts at the

Dartmouth Invitational in November.
Initially trailing Tufts 4-3, Lingon won 3-
1 at the fourth position to tie the match at 4-
4.
Sherwood closed out the match with an
impressive 3-0 victory, sealing the 5-4 upset
for Stanford.
The weekend at Dartmouth also included
wins over No. 30 Colgate and Middlebury,
and tough losses to No. 13 Bowdoin and No.
15 Bates.
Sherwood had the best weekend in the
short history of the sport fora Stanford No.
1 player, going 5-0 and defeating players
from top collegiate teams. All that fora play
er who first picked up a squash racket upon
arriving at the Farm two years ago.
In addition to it's trips back east, the team
has also proven its West Coast dominance.
The Cardinal opened its season with a 7-
2 win over No. 33 California on the rival
Golden Bears' home courts.
Stanford also hosted matches at the
DeGuerre Courts in November, shutting out
a new Utah squad and losing to a tough No.
12 Navy team. In the match against the Mid
shipmen, Sherwood, playing in the No. 1 po
sition, lost an epic five-game battle to Navy's
David I laile.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal men's team will

p.m. in Stanford's last home match of the
season.
