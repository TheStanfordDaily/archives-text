# Duke men, women share No. 1
## 
### 
(AP) — Duke jumped to No. lin the APTop 25 on
Monday, joining the Blue Devils' women atop the
rankings. Connecticut is the only other school to have
held the top spots simultaneously.
Another milestone for Duke's men: This is the sixth
consecutive season they have reached No. 1. Only
UCLA's dynasty of the 1960s and 1970s had a longer
run of seasons; the Bruins had at least one appearance
atop the men's poll 12 straight years.
"We don't really pay attention to our No. 1 rank
ing," Duke forward Dalmtay Jones said. "We just
make sure we get better on a weekly basis, and what
ever you rank us is whatever you rank us."
I he Blue Devils moved up from No. 3, taking ad
vantage of losses last week by the teams ahead of them,
Alabama and Pittsburgh.
Duke (9-0), which beat Fairfield and Clemson, re
ceived 54 first-place votes and 1,778 points from the
national media panel.
Arizona (9-1), No. 1 in the preseason poll and for
the first five weeks of the regular season, moved from
fourth to second. The Wildcats, who won at Oregon
and Oregon State, were No. I on 15 ballots and had
1,714 points.
Connecticut (9-0) climbed two spots to No. 3 — the
same spot its women's team holds — and received one
first-place vote.
Alabama (10-1), No. 1 the last two weeks, dropped
to fourth after a 51-49 loss at Utah. Notre Dame went
from sixth to fifth, while Pittsburgh dropped from sec
ond to sixth because of a 79-67 loss at Georgia.
Mississippi State (10-1) had the two other first-place
votes and was No. 7 in the poll. Texas, Oklahoma and
Illinois rounded out the top 10.
While Duke's women never had been No. 1 before
this season — they have been atop the AP poll since the
preseason — the men's team now has 91 weeks in the
top spot, second only to UCLA's 128.
That Duke is No. 1 is even more impressive consid
ering underclassmen Jason Williams, Mike Dunleavy
and Carlos Boozer all left for the NBA. This year's
team has four freshmen in key roles.
"I know what the rankings are, but in some respects
for us it's a little bit of a popularity contest," Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "We just can't get con
cerned with that, we just have to keep getting better.
Our schedule w ill put us in that situation."
Duke and Kansas (from the 1992-93 season to
1996-97) were tied for second-most consecutive sea
sons reaching No. 1. UCLA's record ran from 1963-64
through 1974-75, during which the Bruins won 10 na
tional championships.
UConn's men's and women's teams were both No.
1 for one week in February 1995, six weeks early in the
