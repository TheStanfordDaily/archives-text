# Hospitals finalize contract
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ending months of wrangling between
workers and administrators at the Stan
ford and Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pitals, employees ratified a new contract
on Dec. 19 with increased wages, work
place benefits and job security. The pro
posal had been agreed upon by union ne
gotiators and the hospital managers two
days earlier.
The new contract will provide an aver
age pay increase of 21 percent over three
years and a new pay scale recognizing se
niority among the 1,400 SEIU Local 715
workers at the hospitals.
"This is a fair agreement that will make our
SEIU-represented employees among the
highest-paid in the area for their job cate
gories while ensuring the continued stability
of our hospitals," said Stanford Hospital CEO
Martha Marsh and Children's Hospital CEO
Christopher Dawes in a joint press release.
The hospitals had been offering the
wage increase for months, but concerns
over workplace representation and job se
curity had prompted workers to hold a one
day strike in November after voting down a
proposal from the hospitals that did not
meet these demands. A federal mediator
was called in the next week and worked
with the two sides to help them reach an
agreement.
"It was a long struggle, and we didn't
expect to resolve it so quickly," said Eliza
beth Bount. a clinical lab assistant and

union steward at Stanford Hospital and a
member of the union negotiating team.
"But it's the results that were really impor
tant to all the members. As a whole, every
body is satisfied because we did get ;t voice
in staffing."
The new contract provides for the for
mation of a worker-manager committee on
patient care and staffing-level issues that
will answer to an outside mediator instead
of hospital executives, as the hospitals had
originally proposed. While the hospitals
have been consistently ranked as some of
the nation's best, workers had complained
that they often worked short-handed when
caring for patients.
The contract will also seek to regulate
the layoff process.
"We did not get any new language about
ending subcontracting out of [union jobs],"
Bount said. "But concerning layoffs, the
hospital will ask for volunteers first, and
then they'll go by reverse seniority. And
they'll try to place people in other jobs be
fore they lay them off ."
The three-year contract was voted in by
a 99 percent majority of the union, which
represents hospital support employees, in
cluding lab technicians, housekeepers, food
service workers and nursing assistants.
"We are very pleased to have reached an
equitable agreement with our SKIU-repre
sented employees. They are an integral
part of our team," Marsh and Dawes said in
the press release.


Students rallied last fall in support of hospital workers. After a series of negotiations and a one
day strike, the hospitals agreed on a new contract with union workers.
While labor issues die down at
the hospitals, contract expira
tion dates are approaching for
workers in other parts of the

Stanford community.
"In the coming months we will
begin to set the stage fora suc
cessful contract campaign for
workers on campus and at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, whose contracts expire at the
end of August," said Roxana
Rivera, a union spokeswoman.
