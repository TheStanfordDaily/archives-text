TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) â€”
Sophomore Will Bynum has left
the Arizona basketball team.
Bynum was disgruntled because
of dwindling playing time for the
No. 2 Wildcats. He requested
and received a release from his
scholarship obligations today.
By pulling out early, the 5-
foot-11 point guard left him
self room to transfer and be
come eligible for part of next
season.
Bynum reportedly is inter
ested in Cincinnati and De-
Paul, near his native Chicago,
as well as Mississippi State
and Oklahoma State. His de
cision was expected after he
refused to accompany Ari
zona on a Pac-10 road trip to
Oregon state last week.
Bynum started nine of Ari
zona's 31 games last season,
averaging about 19 minutes
per game. But the emergence
of freshman point guard
Chris Rodgers cut into
Bynum's playing time.
