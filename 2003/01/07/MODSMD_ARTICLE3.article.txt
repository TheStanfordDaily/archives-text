# Stanford to launch stem-cell center
## Bush administration criticizes controversial first-of-its-kind institute 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last month, after receiving $12 mil
lion from an anonymous donor, Stan
ford announced its intention to establish
the Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biol
ogy and Medicine —the first major in
stitute to use stem-cell technology that
the Bush administration opposes and is
denounced by critics as "cloning."
Part of the institute's research, ac
cording to its director, Irving Weissman,
would be to create human stem cell lines
and experiment with techniques in nu
clear transfer.
Almost immediately, Stanford's an
nouncement began stirring up contro
versy over the definition of cloning.
The University released a statement
that day saying that the research "... is
not cloning human embryos." In the
days that followed, Leon Kass, chairman
of President Bush's Council on
Bioethics, criticized the University for its
decision to begin cloning research "with
out public scrutiny or deliberation."
The institute's research on stem
cells revolves around nuclear trans
fer, a process where genetic material
from an adult cell is removed and
placed into an egg cell. The product is
then stimulated to replicate, techni
cally creating an embryo, from which
human embryonic cells will be taken

and used for research. The process of
creating this product — as Prof. Paul
Berg, a Nobel laureate, acknowl
edged at a press conference — is de
fined as cloning.
"We use the word 'cloning' in science
as a term to describe the production of
many copies of a starting material,"
Berg said.
I he process of this nuclear transfer
"is the same first step as in reproductive
cloning," the University said in a state
ment. "However, in creating a stem cell
line, cells are removed from the devel
oping cluster. These cells can go on to
form many types of tissue but cannot on
their own develop into a human."
Controversy on this issue has arisen
because in order to harvest the stem
cells, embryos must be destroyed. In Au
gust 2001, President Bush limited feeler

al 112 unding for stem cell research, includ
ing the type of research the institute
plans to conduct.
The Stanford Medical School re
leased an information statement saying
that nuclear transfer, which scientists
also refer to as "therapeutic" or "bio
medical" cloning, may cause "confu
sion, especially among the lay pub
lic . . . when [it | is referred to as 'human
embryonic cloning.' In fact, several dif
ferent national science and medical in
stitutions . . . have determined that
[the term] is an inaccurate and mislead
ing term for this research. The ap
proved term is 'nuclear transplantation
(or transferal) to produce human
pluripotent stem cell lines.' This re
search is endorsed by these organiza-


ANNA-CHRISTINA DOUGIAS/The Stanford Daily
tions as a necessary step in the de
velopment of novel new therapies
for cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's
disease and others."
Kass wrote a letter to the Uni
versity after Stanford posted a
statement on its Web site that
the Council on Bioethics sup
ported its view and research.
The University removed the
sentence that referred to the
council immediately after re
ceiving the letter. Kass, howev
er, was not satisfied.
"Stanford has decided to pro
ceed with cloning research with
out public scrutiny and delibera
tion, and has hurt the cause of
public understanding of this sub
ject by its confusion of the issue,"
he said.
In a discussion over semantics,
Philip Pi/.zo, dean of the School of
Medicine, replied with the Uni
versity's position that it does not
see its research as harmful, but
only helpful in the advancement
of science.
"Although 1 certainly respect

the views Dr. Kass expresses as
an honest scientific interpreta
tion, I disagree with his charac
terization of what the institute
proposes to do and the process
by which we will do it," Pizzo
said. "Our research will continue
to be guided by a team of scien
tists, working with legal experts
and ethicists . . .
"... [The] word 'cloning' has
very different meanings to scien
tists and the public, which has led
to confusion over the moral and
ethical underpinnings of stem cell
research," he said in an opinion
letter. "To the scientist, 'cloning'
in this context simply means cre
ating an identical copy of a cell.
To the public, the word often
means the creation of new human
life, to which the scientists at the
institute and Stanford are unani
mously opposed."
Weissman agreed with Pizzo.
"Our avowed goal is to advance
science," he said. "For any group
to stay out of the action and wait
for someone else to do it because of
political reasons is wrong."
Fhe $12 million donation will
go toward a fund raising campaign
for the center's eventual $120 mil
lion cost, Pizzo said.
