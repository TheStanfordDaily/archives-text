# FBI requests data on foreign students
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
In an application of the USA Patriot
Act that has drawn criticism from educa
tional groups and university students for
violating privacy laws and abridging civil
liberties, the Federal Bureau of Investi
gation has requested that colleges and
universities provide it with personal and
background information on foreign stu
dents and faculty.
In the past, universities have been re
quired to provide such background in
formation only to the INS. The FBl's
new request is voluntary, but the FBI
and Department of Justice argue that
they need background information on
foreign students to investigate links to

suspected terrorists and that the Patriot
Act would allow universities to release
such information without asking or noti
fying foreign students.
However, several U.S. senators and
educational groups have claimed that it
would be illegal for universities to pro
vide such data without a specific court
order or subpoena demonstrating that
the information is a necessary part of a
terrorism investigation, the Washington
Post reported last month.
According to John Pearson, director
of the Bechtel International Center,
Stanford has not received any FBI re
quests for information, which could in
clude names, addresses, telephone num
bers, citizenship information, places of
birth, dates of birth and foreign contact

information.
University Council Lauren Schoen
thaler said that, since Stanford has not
received any requests for information, it
has not specifically considered the impli
cations of the FBl's new request. Howev
er. the University's current policy is only
to release background information
when ordered by subpoena.
"Our policy is to require a court order
or subpoena before we release private
information about our students or staff
to ensure our compliance with FERPA
(Federal Education Rights and Privacy
Act) and state privacy laws." Schoen
thaler wrote in an e-mail. "We will com
ply with lawfully issued subpoenas
under the Patriot Act.
"If however, the FBI were to
issue a subpoena for information
that in our view is particularly
egregious or goes beyond the
bounds of the Patriot Act, we could
go to court to make sure that a
court felt the requested informa
tion was necessary."
For international students, par
ticularly those from the Middle
East who have come under the
most intense scrutiny since the
Sept. 1 1 terrorist attacks, this FBI

request is another example of U.S.
government actions that have
jeopardized the civil liberties of
such students.
"Do you think this is constitu
tional?" asked sophomore
Mabrookah Heneidi, vice presi
dent of the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University, explaining that
even foreign students with noth
ing to hide are uncomfortable with
the FBI being given the power to
track their personal information.
"The power that the Patriot Act
has given the government right
now only needs to be challenged,
and I am sure it will be deemed
contrary to the spirit of American
civil liberty."
