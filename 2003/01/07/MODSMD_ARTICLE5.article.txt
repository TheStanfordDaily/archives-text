# Justice Dept to track researchers
## Act restricts certain researchers' use of select biological agents 
### MEGAN CLARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The U.S. Department of Justice
intends to conduct background
checks on all Stanford researchers
with access to certain biological
agents classified as "non-exempt
select agents" by the Center for
Disease Control.
According to Ellyn Segal,
biosafety manager for Stanford's
Department of Environmental
1 lealth and Safety, there are fewer
i han 50 people in a handful of labs
at Stanford who are currently
using these agents.
So far, the CDC and the United
States Department of Agriculture
have only required research insti
tutions, including Stanford, to
register their select agents to each
agency and have not yet requested
names.
"Currently the federal govern
ment has not set up the mecha

nism to do the checks," Segal said.
"They state that they are 'in the
process of setting it up.' "
The Department of Justice
checks are mandated by the Public
Health Safety and Bioterrorism
Preparedness and Response Act
of 2002. The act was signed into
law in June 2002 to establish mea
sures by which to enforce the USA
Patriot Act of October 2001.
The Patriot Act designated
groups of "restricted persons"
who are no longer allowed access
to non-exempt select agents, a list
which includes the Ebola virus,
the smallpox virus and the bacte
ria anthrax.
The background checks are in
tended to determine whether
those with access to non-exempt
select agents fall into the category
of restricted persons and should
therefore be denied access to
them under the Patriot Act.
Restricted persons may still
work on versions of select agents
which have been exempted by the
(IDC, a list which includes certain
vaccine strains of viruses as well as
toxin amounts less than 50 times
the standard lethal dose to a

human.
Restricted persons include
those who are on non-immigrant
visas from seven nations that the
U.S. has deemed to be "state spon
sors of terrorism": Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
and Syria.
It also includes those who have
been committed to a mental insti
tution, unlawful drug users, and
those who have been discharged
from the armed services under
dishonorable conditions.
"It's wrong to only focus on in
ternational students in this de
bate," said Ann Arvin, associate
dean of research at Stanford.
" I he restricted persons part in
cludes people that had a dishon
orable discharge from the mili
tary, which might simply be be
cause they're gay. And what if you
were busted in college for selling
dope? I hese are our restricted
persons."
Steven Block, professor of bio
logical sciences and applied
physics, questioned the ability of
the Department of Justice to even

check such facts on international
students.
"They didn't think it through
completely for what happens if
you're a foreigner," Block said.
"Our U.S. databases don't specify
whether Canadians have been in a
mental institution, for example."
On Mar. 15, 2002, Charles
Kruger, dean of research and
graduate policy, sent letters to
over 1,100 Stanford researchers
with access to select agents, notify
ing them of the "restricted per
sons" section of the Patriot Act and
requesting them to self-report.
"The letter said that if you had
a conflict [with the legislation], the
University would take all appro
priate steps to get you on another
project," said Lauren Schoen
thaler, an attorney in Stanford's
Office of the General Counsel.
But according to Segal, no one
working on a non-exempt select

agent at Stanford has reported to
Dean Kruger that he or she lalls
into the category of "restricted
persons."
One of Segal's main concerns is
the fact that the CDC is making a
unilateral decision about the con
tents of the select agent list.
"They're not communicating,"
she said. "They're taking input,
but there's not a dialogue. In fact,
Congress mandated that there be
no dialogue."
According to a CDC press re
lease, the CDC is currently accept
ing public comments on new,
tighter restrictions on select
agents that were issued on Dec.
13, and those comments could re
sult in regulatory changes in the
future.
Stanford previously submitted
its input on Sept. 1 1, 2002, when
Segal and Assoc. Vice Provost
Larry Cibbs sent a formal state
ment to the CDC.
"We don't know whether
they're going to pay attention to
our comments or not," Arvin said.
According to Schoenthaler, the

Patriot and Bioterrorism Re
sponse Acts designated two new
major restrictions in addition to
limiting access to restricted per
sons.
First, the Patriot Act makes it il
legal for anyone to possess a bio
logical agent or toxin that is not
"reasonably justified," a condition
which includes "bona fide re
search."
Second, the Bioterrorism Re
sponse Act requires all research
institutions to register the posses
sion of select agents as well as the
names of those who have access to
them. Previous regulations only
required institutions to register
the transfer of select agents.
The Patriot Act carries a fine
and up to 10 years in jail while the
Bioterrorism Response Act carries
a fine and up to five years in
prison.
FBI has threatened a researcher
with Patriot prosecution already
This July, Tomas Foral, a grad
uate student at the University of
Connecticut, became the first per

son charged under the USA Patri
ot Act for possession of a biological
agent with no "reasonably justi
fied" purpose, the first major re
striction identified by Schoen
thaler.
In October 2001, a freezer
broke in Tomas Foral's lab,
prompting him and a fellow re
searcher to clean it out and trans
fer the vials inside to a different
freezer. The two reportedly found
five to seven vials containing
frozen tissue samples from a cow
that died of anthrax in 1968.
According to the university,
Foral was told to destroy the sam
ples. However, he kept two vials in
liis own freezer, "thinking they
may be needed for future re
search."
In response to an anonymous
tip by someone who saw the sam
ples in Foral's freezer space, the
FBI entered the lab in full biohaz
ard suits on November 27, 2001
and confiscated the two tubes. The
FBI subsequently brought
charges against Foral in July of
this year.

Foral, who is a second lieu
tenant in the ROTC, those a pre
trial diversion program to avoid
prosecution. The program will in
volve two years of community ser
vice.
"I have no choice," Foral said.
"It would be very expensive to go
to trial. It would be unaffordable
to me."
Undercurrent law, it is legal for
Foral to possess anthrax as long as
he is not a restricted person, and
he is using it for "bona fide re
search."
Block said that this case exem
plifies the problems with the acts'
wording.
"Is it sufficient just to possess a
select agent in a strain collection,
or do I have to be conducting an
experiment on it?" he said. "Do 1
need to have a grant to work on it?
" They're going after someone
who clearly doesn't fall under the
heading ofbioterrorist."
Arvin has similar concerns
about the effectiveness of the acts.
"It's like checking the grand
mas at the airport," she said.
