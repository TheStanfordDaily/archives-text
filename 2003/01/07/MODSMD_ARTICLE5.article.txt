# Justice Dept to track researchers
## Act restricts certain researchers' use of select biological agents 
### MEGAN CLARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The U.S. Department of Justice
intends to conduct background
checks on all Stanford researchers
with access to certain biological
agents classified as "non-exempt
select agents" by the Center for
Disease Control.
According to Ellyn Segal,
biosafety manager for Stanford's
Department of Environmental
1 lealth and Safety, there are fewer
i han 50 people in a handful of labs
at Stanford who are currently
using these agents.
So far, the CDC and the United
States Department of Agriculture
have only required research insti
tutions, including Stanford, to
register their select agents to each
agency and have not yet requested
names.
"Currently the federal govern
ment has not set up the mecha

nism to do the checks," Segal said.
"They state that they are 'in the
process of setting it up.' "
The Department of Justice
checks are mandated by the Public
Health Safety and Bioterrorism
Preparedness and Response Act
of 2002. The act was signed into
law in June 2002 to establish mea
sures by which to enforce the USA
Patriot Act of October 2001.
The Patriot Act designated
groups of "restricted persons"
who are no longer allowed access
to non-exempt select agents, a list
which includes the Ebola virus,
the smallpox virus and the bacte
ria anthrax.
The background checks are in
tended to determine whether
those with access to non-exempt
select agents fall into the category
of restricted persons and should
therefore be denied access to
them under the Patriot Act.
Restricted persons may still
work on versions of select agents
which have been exempted by the
(IDC, a list which includes certain
vaccine strains of viruses as well as
toxin amounts less than 50 times
the standard lethal dose to a

human.
Restricted persons include
those who are on non-immigrant
visas from seven nations that the
U.S. has deemed to be "state spon
sors of terrorism": Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
and Syria.
It also includes those who have
been committed to a mental insti
tution, unlawful drug users, and
those who have been discharged
from the armed services under
dishonorable conditions.
"It's wrong to only focus on in
ternational students in this de
bate," said Ann Arvin, associate
dean of research at Stanford.
" I he restricted persons part in
cludes people that had a dishon
orable discharge from the mili
tary, which might simply be be
cause they're gay. And what if you
were busted in college for selling
dope? I hese are our restricted
persons."
Steven Block, professor of bio
logical sciences and applied
physics, questioned the ability of
the Department of Justice to even
