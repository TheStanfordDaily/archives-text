# Van Valkenburgh wins Marshall scholarship

### RAVI GARG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With his ticket to Cambridge University in
hand, senior Parker Van Valkenburgh, Stan
ford's only Marshall scholarship winner this
year, hopes to use his experience overseas to re
form and advance the field of archaeology.
"Graduate study across the Atlantic will be an
opportunity to gain critical perspective on what
I've studied in archaeology so far," Van Valken
burgh said.
Marshall scholarships are awarded to Ameri
can students to fund their education and pursuit
of a degree in the United Kingdom. Van Valken
burgh said he now has the resources to go beyond
a one-year program at (lambridge and pursue ei
ther a second degree or year of independent re
search anywhere in the United Kingdom.
"Having gone through the scholarship
process now, 1 realize that the benefits of the
Marshall go well beyond the funding," he said.
"The intention of the award, as designed, is to
foster greater leaders in Britain and America."
The scholarship was actually created as a
token of thanks by the British government for
American support under the Marshall plan.

This makes the award especially prestigious,
and it reflects well on both students and educa
tional institutions, said John Pearson, director of
the Bechtel International Center. Pearson is one
of two staff members at Bechtel who advise stu
dents on the award and assist with the applica
tion process.
Aside from Van Valkenburgh, there were no
other Marshall winners and no Rhodes scholars
this year from Stanford.
Thirty-two Stanford students applied for one
or both of the scholarships, Pearson said.
The last time Stanford did not have a Rhodes
scholar was three years ago.
"I wish I knew why we didn't receive a Rhodes
this year," Pearson said. "We had four candi
dates interviewed at the state level and the cam
pus endorsement panel felt very positive about
all four candidates," Pearson said.
According to Pearson, these applicants were
as qualified for the scholarship as past winners,
but more schools are encouraging their students
to apply, and the competition among applicants
is increasing.
Van Valkenburgh said that he was eager to
use his Marshall scholarship to strengthen the in
ternational role of the study of archaeology.

"So there's this history to the [scholarship] that
is much larger than me, and that gives me a sense
of purpose going into graduate study in Britain â€”
a responsibility to go beyond constructing a spe
cialty within my discipline, to assume a kind of in
ternational social responsibility that 1 think is lac k
ing in much of academia, particularly in archaeol
ogy," Van Valkenburgh said.
Studying in Britain also will give him the op
portunity to bridge American and British acade
mic approaches to archaeology. Me said that the
field operates differently in Britain because the
basic premises that British archaeologists build
upon are subtly different from those of Ameri
can archaeologists. As a result, communication
between the two groups can sometimes be diffi
cult.
"1 feel like real experience with a tradition of
archaeological scholarship that is widely sepa
rate from our own will help me clarify and mod
ify the assumptions I've built in these last few
years of study," he said. "I'm also hoping that the
experience will give me a basis to help bridge t he
gap between American and British archaeolo
gists."
