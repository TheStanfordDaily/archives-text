## Three Palestinian colleges to close 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel barred a Palestinian
delegation from attending a Mideast conference in
London and decided to close three Palestinian uni
versities yesterday in response to Sunday's suicide
bombings.
Bombings on the scale of the twin blasts in Tel Aviv
— 22 killed and more than 100 wounded — in the
past triggered major Israeli military offensives.
The two bombers, residents of the West Bank city
of Nablus aged 19 and 20, blew themselves up in an
old area of Tel Aviv crowded with foreign workers.
The explosions ripped through a Chinese takeout
restaurant, a pub and several shops.
But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's options lor re
taliation are increasingly limited, with Israel s gener
al election only three weeks away and the United
States eager to keep a lid on Mideast violence ahead
of a possible strike against Iraq.
In Gaza early today, A Palestinian civilian in a car
was shot and killed by Israeli forces operating near
the Mugha/i refugee camp, and soldiers tore down
two empty buildings at the edge of Khan Younis,
Palestinians said. The Israeli military had no imme
diate comment.
Sharon adviser Raanan Gissin, meanwhile, said
the security Cabinet decided in principle to shut
down three Palestinian universities.
