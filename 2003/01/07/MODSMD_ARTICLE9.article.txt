### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein ac
cused U.N. arms inspectors yesterday of conducting
"intelligence work" instead of searching for evidence
of banned weapons and blamed the United States for
pushing the U.N. teams to overstep their legitimate
mandate.
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency
also said yesterday that it was too early to say whether
Iraq was working on nuclear weapons, despite near
ly two months of searches by his inspectors.
"We are not certain of Iraq's [nuclear] capability,"
Mohamed Elßaradei told reporters, at the end of a
top-level meeting of his International Atomic Energy
Agency.
Saddam said in a taped speech that U.N. inspec
tors are collecting names of Iraqi scientists, putting
questions to them that mask "hidden agendas" and
gathering information about conventional arms not
restricted by U.N. resolutions. "All or most" of these
activities "constitute purely intelligence work," Sad

clam said.
Saddam did not otter any specific evidence of
spying, and his accusation was denied by Melissa
Fleming, spokeswoman for the U.N. International
Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear arm of inspec
tion program.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Saddam's accusations were
"baseless and false" and making such charges was tan
tamount to not complying with U.N. Security Coun
cil-imposed obligations concerning disarmament.
"It is not the way to solve this situation," Boucher
said. "I lis accusations are untrue and may indicate an
intention not to comply."
Under a Security Council resolution passed in No
vember, U.N. inspectors are in Iraq to establish
whether it still has chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons or the means to deliver them. Iraq has de
nied having such weapons, but America and Britain
have accused it of hiding banned arms.
