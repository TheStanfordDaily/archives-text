We're good at fitting people to jobs
And jobs to people.
It wouldn't be clear to every firm that a man with an M.F. A.in
poetry was the right choice to head an automated block trad
ing unit. Or that a designer of solar-powered race cars was the
right woman to help launch a new venture in computational
chemistry. But after we talked to them, it was clear to us.
The D. E. Shaw group is an investment and technology devel
opment firm. Since 1988 we've grown into a number of closely
related entities with more than US $4 billion in aggregate capi
tal by hiring smart people from a wide range of backgrounds
and letting them implement—and manage—what they invent.
A robotics guru. A nationally ranked blackjack player.
A demolitions expert. An operatic mezzo-soprano. And
a lot of people who are just exceptionally strong in CS, EE,
math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, soft
ware development, trading, business development, account
ing, finance, and investor relations. We're looking for creative
but pragmatic people, articulate, curious, and driven. Our
working environment is intense but surprisingly casual. We
provide unusual opportunities for growth. And we compensate
extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will interview on-campus on
Thursday, January 30. To apply for an interview, log on
to www.stanford.edu/dept/CDC/students/register.html by
January 9 or send a resume and a cover letter stating
your GPA and standardized test scores to
oncampus@desluiw.com by January 16.
The IX li. Shaw group does not discriminate, in employment matters, on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexaal orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class.
