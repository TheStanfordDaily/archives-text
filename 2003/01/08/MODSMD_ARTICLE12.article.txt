LONDON (AP) — Prime Minister
Tony Blair's government said yester
day it seeks to repeal a law that bars
t he use of public funds to promote ho
mosexuality, saying it served no pur
pose and offended gays.
The measure also bars schools
from teaching the "acceptability of ho
mosexuality as a pretended family re
lationship."
Local Government Minister Nick

Raynsford said the measure served no
purpose and "gives considerable of
fense to many people whose lifestyle is
stigmatized by this provision."
R ay n s fo r d' s an no un c e me nt
came during debate in the 1 louse of
Commons over a bill on new powers
for local government. The govern
ment did not offer legislation to re
peal the provision, but Raynsford
said it would support an appropri

ate amendment.
The law dates to 1988 when the
Conservatives were in power and Mar
garet Thatcher was prime minister.
Conservative Party spokesman
Eric Pickles said the lories would re
serve judgment for now.
But John Bercow, a Conservative
lawmaker who distanced himself 112 rom
the party over its opposition to letting
gay couples adopt children, said he

would back the repeal.
"1 believe (the 1988 provision) is
gratuitously offensive, causes justified
resentment and should, in the inter
ests of fairness and decency, be ur
gently repealed," he said.
Labor legislator David Lepper, who
also favors the measure's repeal, said it
has functioned mainly as a "powerful
symbol of prejudice and discrimination
against gay and lesbian peo pie."
