# Republicans lead new Congress

WASHINGTON (AF) â€” Pausing barely long
enough to take the oath of office, the new Republi
can-controlled Congress hastened toward passage
of unemployment assistance for victims of the sag
ging economy on yesterday, working with unusual
speed on a day customarily set aside for ceremony
and socializing.
"First bill, passed it," said Sen. Bill Frist of Ten
nessee, the newly minted majority leader, shortly
after the Senate approved the bill to restore lapsed
benefits despite complaints 112 rom Democrats it didn't
go far enough. Across the Capitol, Speaker Dennis
1 lastert said the House would clear the measure for
President Bush's signature in a day or two, ensuring
no disruption of benefits for those currently receiv
ing them.
The legislation, estimated to cost $7.2 billion,
would renew a program of 13 weeks of federal
benefits for jobless workers who have exhausted
their 20 weeks of state benefits. The 13-week pro
gram expired on Dec. 2N, but administration offi
cials say the benefits can continue uninterrupted
as long as Bush signs legislation to renew them by
Thursday. Officials said an estimated 750,000
people are affected, plus an additional 1.6 million
who are expected to become eligible for the feder
al assistance before the program extension expires
on June 1.
The Senate acted on Congress' first day in session
since the November elections in which Bush led fel
low Republicans to control of both houses. For his
part, the president was in Chicago during the day,
outlining a $674 billion economic package he hopes
lawmakers will enact later in the year.
With the Senate in Republican hands, Bush also
resubmitted 31 judicial nominations, including two
that were at the center of pitched political battles in
2002. U.S. District Judge Charles Pickering of Missis
sippi and Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla
Owen were blocked from confirmation to the appeals
court by votes of the Democratic-controlled Senate
Judiciary Committee a year ago.
