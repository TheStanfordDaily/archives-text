## MEMORY YIELDS We've got the registrar blues 
### 
When Stanford students look
back at what the dot-bomb
hath wrought, they might
recall actually having to
speak to government recruiters at this
year's c areer fair to evoke any interest in
hiring, the banal pets.com sock puppet or
llennessian rants on F*trade's advice
that you learn stock-ticker instead of
French — we're sure French acumen is
what got him to where lie is today.
However, overlooked and forgotten

in dot-bomb lore is the
day you realized that our
old friend Axess, roman
tically always decades be
hind the times, had
given way to a version
one-year antiquated in
name only.
Those of us who were
overseas at the various
Stanford campuses will

never forget the mass
mailings we received from the Regis
trar's Office, some exhorting us to regis
ter for classes and others threatening us
with $50 fines and permanent banish
ment to Stanford's new overseas campus
in Crawford, Texas — all heedless of the
fact the new Axess did not even have list
ings for those classes being taught
abroad. Faculty and staff complained
about the rigidity and self-righteousness
of the new Axess; professors found
themselves unable to e-mail their own
class lists; the skies rained fire and brim
stone; and a Stanford alum was passed
over fora job in favor of a Cal grad.
Students to this day are plagued with
such inane processes as a "Four Step"
class registration process, in which Step 2
involves clicking a button that says, "Pro
ceed to Step 3," and Step 4 is clicking a
similarly entitled button regarding the
completion of aforementioned Step 3.
The pains associated with Axess' Byzan
tine rules governing coterm transcripts
and requirements will only increase as

the economy sours. One is inclined to be
lieve that simply making the design of a
new Axess the final project for CS 105
would have turned out better — not to
mention the excuse it would have given
Stanford men to demonstrate the depths
of our gratitude to the many comely co
eds enrolled in the spring section of said
C IS class.
Additionally, a word of advice for you
underclassmen, especially you sopho
mores who, although we're sure that you
haven't thought about it yet, are, in the
opinion of the university registrar, get
ting close to graduation. Order tran
scripts now for the winter of 2005, when
you are looking for jobs and applying to
graduate school. The Registrar's Office
moves at glacial speed.
In the halcyon days of impeachment
hearings and signing bonuses for history
majors, one could merely click a button
on our dearly departed friend (God rest
his soul) and pick your transcripts up two
business clays later. However, in an at
tempt to save money, the registrar, Roger
Printup (ha, you thought someone in the
registrar's Office made that cute name
up, didn't you?) cut a staff position, ap
parently the one that was in charge of
handing us our transcripts.
Of course, they did not cut the position
in charge of handing us our certificates of
enrollment. However, in the registrar's
opinion, it seems to be far too much work
for the person responsible for c ertificates
of enrollment to also handle transcripts.
On a side note, we suspect that the Stan
lord Labor Action Coalition may have
been somehow involved, claiming that
the unskilled act of handing out tran
scripts was not in keeping with the living
wage policy. They're also probably the
computer progressives that fought for
the extra two-hour break Axess enjoys on
the weekend to spend with its network
r *1 m
family.
In any event, transcripts, as we all
know, are now delivered to your p.o. box.

That is roughly 100 yards from the Reg
istrar's Of lice. That is, 100 yards if you or
I walked it. Instead the Registrar's Office
sends our transcripts through the mail.
Rather than give them to the guy al
ready sitting at the window with all the
other paperwork to be picked up, they
mail it. To the Stanford post office. It
was bad enough when our "Sports Illus
trated" and SAE's "Playboy" were com
ing weeks late and dog-eared, but to
have the people behind the counter at
the Stanford post office ask us about our
fall quarter 1-Huni grades is unbearable.
Not to mention costly, which was nomi
nally the reason that you could not pic k
up your transcripts anymore. Although
we're not math majors, we guarantee
that it costs more to pay the ever-escalat
ing cost of first-class postage, now 37
cents, than it does to simply have the
people already sitting at those dreadful
windows in Old Union just hand us our
damn transcripts.
Admittedly, there appears to be
some initial, nominal registrar returns
to the money we hand over to Old
Union each and every quarter. Al
though it is perplexing why the time
schedule has to now he hidden behind
the firewall that is Axess' surly punch
clock, both winter and spring appear on
the current online edition. Of course,
that doesn't mean that your spring
quarter professor really has a due about
her class in January, but at least it allows
a modicum of non-ad hoc academic
planning for students. Also, it's mildly
convenient to see a real-time, itemized
breakdown of your Stanford account
online. Now if only we could actually do
something about the numbers.
