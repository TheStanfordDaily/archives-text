# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## An argument for the death penalty 
### JAMIE CUNDIFF GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ever since Sept. 11, 2001, Americans
have all been wondering one thing:
Where is Osama bin Laden? The where
abouts of the leader of the al-Qaida ter
rorist network have been unknown ever
since the Sept. 1 1 attacks.
I he media has been preoccupied with
this issue, over-emphasizing "new devel
opments" and "false alarms." I feel that a
shift in focus is in order. The more rele
vant issue concerns what we do once we
find him. The most appropriate response
to the finding of C)sama bin Laden (or any
known terrorist for that matter) would be
to kill him on site, to serve justice by ad
ministering the death penalty.
Such swift and decisive action by the
U.S. would be an incredibly efficient
means of dealing with the problem; we
wouldn't even have to deal with the hassle
of transporting the perpetrators back to
the U.S. No expensive, drawn-out trial;
just a push of a button, and it would be
over. It would be quick and painless on
our side and send a message to al-Qaida
that we don't mess around.
If the crime warrants it, punishment by
means of death is the only way that justice
can be served.
fhe heinous acts of the al-Qaida terror
ist network have been responsible for the
deaths of thousands of civilians, including
the over 2,800 Americans killed in the Sept.
1 I attacks. These were innocent, hard
working people who were just going about
a normal day.
It is a common belief that criminals of
this sort not only should die, but they de
serve to die. Murderers have violated
their victims' right to live, and those who
commit such a violation must expect to
suffer the consequences.
Putting extreme criminals to death is the
only surefire way to prevent ruthless mur
derers such as those mentioned above from
killing again, which they undoubtedly

would have if'they ever made their way back
into society.
Therein is a flaw in the option ol impris
onment; escapes and releases due to legal
loopholes are always a possibility. I lie
death penalty also provides closure for vic
tims and those close to them; psychological
tumult, caused by the fear that the perpe
trator may escape and come after them, is
completely removed from their minds.
Fear of being put to death can also act as a
deterrent for those who may be contem
plating committing a major crime.
Besides, the option of life imprison
ment is thoroughly offensive when con
sidered from a financial standpoint. Al
though there are arguments over which
costs more, life imprisonment or the
death penalty, it is the allocation of tax
payer 112 unds that defines the issue.
The money is used for legal and inves
tigative purposes in the case of the death
penally, for condemning a person to death
is an extremely serious decision and must
be examined with strict scrutiny. In the case
of life imprisonment, the funds go toward
keeping the criminal well fed, comfortable,
and entertained. The idea that those close
to the victims have financial obligation to
such responsibilities is disturbing.
The United States needs to toughen up
and be more liberal in administering the
death penalty. I, for one, know 1 would
sleep more comfortably knowing that the
worst criminals have been stripped of their
most precious gift: life.
Anyone who supports the unwarranted
killing ol innocent people does not deserve
a chance at life.
I he physic al elimination of Osama bin
Laden and the rest of the al-Qaida terror
ist network would further demonstrate
that administration of the death penalty is
the only way to satisfy man's natural de
sire for justice.
