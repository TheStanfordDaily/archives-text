Professors call for Americans to speak out
(800 American professors have signed
t lie following letter.)
We, American academics and intellec
tuals, applaud our courageous Israeli
colleagues for their recent letter warn
ing of the possibility of ethnic cleansing
in Israel and the Occupied Territories.
The 187 Israeli signatories express con
cern that the "log of war" (against Iraq)
"could be exploited by the Israeli gov
ernment to commit further crimes
against the Palestinian people, up to full-
Hedged ethnic cleansing."
The Israeli professors point out that:
" The Israeli ruling coalition includes par
ties that promote 'transfer' of the Pales
tinian population as a solution to what
they call 'the demographic problem.'
Politicians are regularly quoted in the
media as suggesting forcible expulsion,
most recently MKs [members of the Is
raeli parliament] Michael Kleiner and
Benny Klon, as reported on Yediot
Ahronot Web site on Sept. 19, 2002. In a
recent interview in Israeli daily, Ha'aretz,
Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon described
the Palestinians as a 'cancerous manifesta
tion' and equated the military actions in
the Occupied Territories with
'chemotherapy,' suggesting that more
radical 'treatment' may be necessary.
Prime Minister Sharon has backed this'as
sessment of reality.' Escalating racist dem
agoguery concerning the Palestinian < iti
zens of Israel may indicate the scope of the
crimes that are possibly being contemplat
ed." Benjamin Netanyahu, the newly ap

pointed Israeli foreign minister, previ
ously advocated expelling Palestinians
while the world was distracted with
events at Tiananmen Square.
We join with our Israeli colleagues in
calling for vigilance as events unfold in Is
rael and the Occupied Territories. With
an average of more than $10 million dol
lars per day of American tax dollars going
to Israel, we believe Americans cannot re
main silent while crimes as abhorrent as
ethnic cleansing are being openly advo
cated.
We urge our government to commu
nicate clearly to the government of Israel
that the expulsion of people according to
race, religion or nationality would con
stitute crimes against humanity and will
not be tolerated.
