# Mac hit with Giant heartache
## 
### 
On Sunday, I was humiliated,
knocked to the ground and beat
en. Then, on Monday, as I stag
gered to my feet, still licking my
fresh wounds, 1 was kicked in the balls for
good measure.
Let me explain.
Sunday afternoon, my beloved New
York Giants completed the biggest col
lapse in NFC 1 playoff history, blowing a 38-
14 lead over the 49ers in the game's last 18
minutes to eventually lose 39-38. Anyone
who watched the game can attest to the fact
that for the first 42 minutes, the Giants
were flat-out amazing — truly Super Bowl
caliber.
Quarterback Kerry Collins was throw
ing laserbeams across the field — more evi-

dence that he's back on
the wagon, which is good
news for Giants fans who
have been waiting for him
to regain the swagger that
only a good Jack-and-
Coke can provide. Wide
receiver Amani loonier
did his best Jerry Rice im
pression with three first-

half touchdowns, making San Fran's top
corner Ahined I'lummerlook more clueless
ih,m Dubya on a bad day. Tiki Barber was
running ihc ball well and tight end Jeremy
Shoe'key continued his amazing assault on
defenders, punishing would-be tacklers
more than any offensive player I've ever
seen.
All looked good as I sat and watched the
game with my father in my Manhattan
apartment, reveling in the apparent
blowout, since my flight was scheduled to
leave al 9:30 p.m.ES I' — a time chosen
specifically because it would allow me to
watch my Giants advance to the second
round.
However, as everyone knows by now,
the 'Niners began to close the gap at the
end of the third quarter and just steam
rolled through the fourth. I'm not goingto
go into the play-by-play details for reasons
absolutely necessary for my current fragile
state, but 1 can honestly say that I have
never seen an all-around collapse like that.
So many ridiculous mistakes, with the ab

sence of any one of them guaranteeing vic
tory for the Giants.
Midway through the third, Shockey let
an easy touchdown slip right through his
hands. After a couple one-handed grabs
across the middle, the standout rookie
couldn't make the easiest catch of the day,
which meant that the Giants had to settle
fora field goal — a four-point swing that
eventually made the difference.
But still, all the offense had to do
throughout the fourth quarter was just
hold onto the ball and a pick up a couple
first downs. Instead, it sputtered to two
straight three-and-outs after registering
none in the game's first 45 minutes. And
the defense, which had shut down the
Colts and Eagles in consecutive weeks and
had given up only one touchdown since
the game's early minutes, couldn't do a
thing. Honestly, the Giants 1) looked easi
er to score on than Brittany Murphy's
character in "8 Mile."
And what about the personal foul calls
that cost the Giants 15 yards on the team's
potential game-winning drive? Honestly,
how dumb and unprofessional can a team
be? Baiting Terrell Owens into a late hit
was a shrewd move, but then the team just
handed back the present with an ab
solutely retarded retaliation. Sorry, but
that goes straight to the coaching staff,
which has to rein in its players and control
their emotions.
Now onto the kicking game. This may
sound ignorant but how hard is it to snap
the ball? Trey Junkins, your one job in life
is to throw a ball through your legs, and
you failed miserably. Like Ray I*inkle's
mom says about holder Dan Marino in
"Ace Ventura" after the whole Laces-Out
episode, "I hope you die of gonorrhea and
rot in hell."
()kay, so kicker Matt Bryant botches the
first attempt to ice the game with three
minutes left after a low snap. And then he
never gets a second chance in the game's
final moments as holder/ punter Malt
Allen took the horrible snap, scrambled
and then heaved the ball down field, al
most in the grasp of a Giants lineman who


Mat Levine
was blatantly pulled down l>\ a
49cr.
So as I sat on the plane, stewing
about the game lor the entire five
hour flight, in earshot of three cry
ing babies while sitting next to an
obese man that sinelled like two
week-old Jack in the Box, 1
thought that nothing could make
this loss worse.
Oh, how I was wrong.
On Monday the NFL released
an official statement admitting that
the referees basically made the

biggest f&sk-up in NFL history —
given the context of the game — by
not calling defensive pass-interfer
ence on Allen's heave downfield,
since the potential receiver, line
man Kick Seubert, had, in fact, re
ported as an "eligible receiver." If
the correct call had been made,
theie would have been offsetting
penalties on the play, since a difler
ent Giants lineman, Tam I lopkins,
was correctly called illegally down
lield. In the words of NFL Director
of Officiating Mike Pereira, the
"game would have been extended
by one untimed down." Never be
fore has the NFL ever made such
an admission of guilt in a playoff
game, which shows how badly the

league knows it messed up.
So the Giants and their admit
tedly rag-tag kic king unit should
have had another shot at a very
tnakeable 41-yard field goal to ad
vance, even with their complete and
utter collapse down the stretch.
Would Junkins have actually
snapped the ball to Allen? Would
Allen have actually gotten the snap
down? Would Bryant have been
able to knock it through? Who real
ly knows. Like Michael Strahan said
yesterday, 1 wish the teams could
lace'em up and go back out to see —
but that's obviously not happening.
What do I think would happen?
Well, I saw Bryant kick a 37-yard
field goal to beat the Eagles a week

earlier to get the Giants into the
playoffs, and I am a die-hard Gi
ants fan, so I see no reason why he
couldn't do it twice in a row.
What do I know? 1 know that it
snc ks the Giants collapsed, the rels
had their heads up their asses and
that we'll never know for suit*. One
thing is dear and that is that games
should be decided on the field by
the players involved, and not by the
rels. And that's why I'm still recov
ering from a solid kit kin the crotch.
