## 
### 
NORMAN, Okla. (AP)— Hollis Price was the
clear winner in this matchup of premier guards. As a
result, Connecticut isn't unbeaten anymore.
Price, Oklahoma's senior leader, had a career
high 33 points, including 10 free throws in the
game's final minutes, helping the ninth-ranked
Sooners to a 73-63 victory last night.
Third-ranked Connecticut came in averaging
90.1 points per game, thanks in part to the play of
sophomore guard Ben Gordon. But Gordon went
just 5-of-18 from the field and scored 12 points, 10
below his average.
"Our goal with Gordon tonight was to make him
drive," Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. "That
was the key, making Gordon drive the ball, not giv
ing him the 3-point shot."
Gordon, shooting 50 percent from 3-point range,
was 2-of-7 from behind the arc. He got several good
looks in close in the first half but missed most of them
and Connecticut (9-1) fell into a 20-7 hole-.
Price had 14 first-half points as the Sooners (8-2)
took a 13-point half time lead. He carried the Sooners
after point guard Quannas White left with a sprained
knee midway through t he first half. The other part of
Oklahoma's three-guard backcourt, Ebi Ere, scored
13 points but was just 4-of-10 from the field.
"It was one of those nights where everything that's
happening for you is light on time," Price said. "All
the guys just did a great job of getting me the ball."
The Sooners won their 30th straight home game,
the second-longest streak in the nation behind
Brigham Young's 42. The loss by Connecticut leaves
No. 1 Duke and No. 17 Wake Forest as the only un
beaten teams in Division I.
Tony Robertson had 16 points and EmekaOkafor
had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Huskies.
Coach Jim Calhoun praised the play of those two,
but said he was disappointed in Gordon and point
guard Taliek Brown. Brown had just two assists and
missed all four of his shots.
"Ben's a wonderful player. He's a large reason why
we're 9-1, but he had a very, very poor game," Cal
houn said. "Tonight was certainly not his shining
hour."
After his big first half, Price made three more bas
kets in the first 4:13 of the second half, including a 3-
pointer that gave the Sooners t heir biggest lead, 51-31.
His short jumper off a UConn turnover made it
53-35 with 13:33 left. The Sooners then went 11
straight possessions without a basket and Connecti
cut took advantage, scoring 11 points to get within
53-46 before Johnnie Gilbert ended the spurt with a
tip-in of a miss by Price with 5:52 to play.
Okafor and Rashad Anderson
scored consecutive baskets to cut
the margin to 55-50 with 5:05 left,
but the Huskies got no closer. Ok
lahoma was IS-of-19 112 rom the foul
line over the final 4:4 — Price was
10-for-10.
"What 1 really liked about Price
is early, he didn't look for his shot,
lie looked for his teammates,
which I reminded some of our
kids of," Galhoun said.
"When we did a better job on
Ere, he took over. He certainly

looked like a first-team All-Aineri
t an tonight."
Connecticut was trying for its
second big comeback win of the'
year. I lie Huskies trailed Massa
chusetts 34-9 early in the second
half on Dec. 10, and rallied fora
59-48 victory.
White left at the 11:22 mark of
the first half alter banging his left]
knee. He didn't return until 3:41
left in the game, and promptly hit,
two free throws to give Oklahoma
a 59-52 lead.
"I knew he was a tough guy wlioi
was going to try to come back,"
Price said of White. "That's what he
did. He knocked down those two
free throws, which we needed."
