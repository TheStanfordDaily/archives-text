I was itching to play last weekend. I think
Ill be strong enough by Thursday."

jured, but we can't eliminate everybody
else from the floor," Olson said yester
day. " The last (time) he was fully ready to
go, and he was playing well. But how are
you going to predict turning to
start running down the court, and
he steps on somebody's foot? You
can't protect against that."

Walton averaged 15.7 points,
7.3 rebounds and a Pac-1() high
6.26 assists — the most of any
frontcourt player in the nation
— last season. So far in this in

bers are 7.0 points, 4.2 rebounds
and 3.7 assists.
He said it was difficult to sit on

the bench.
"You have 14,000 people
cheering for you," Walton said. "I
am not where I need to be, but 1
will be ready. 1 will gradually work
my way into it."
The Wildcats have beaten
Washington State (5-6, 0-2) 34
consecutive times.
