# Dorm custodians to work weekends
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a schedule adjustment
aimed at addressing student com
plaints about weekend waste ac
cumulation in dorms across cam
pus, Student Housing Services
announced yesterday that it will
now offer dorm cleaning six days
per week. Previously, residences
were only cleaned Monday
through Friday.
Imogen Church, the manager
of undergraduate housing opera
tions for Student Housing Ser
vices, said that the University had
explored implementing the
change for several years.
"We have seen [this issue] on
the annual surveys consistently,"
Church said. "We had been get
ting additional comments from
residents saying that over the
weekends there would be trash
buildup because there were no
custodians available."
She also noted that there have
been pest control issues due to the
lack of weekend cleaning in cam
pus residences.
Roxana Rivera, a union repre
sentative for SL\IU Local 715, said
that, in accord with its contractual
obligations, the University gave
workers a month's notice before
officially implementing the
change.
According to Church, the cus
todial employees will be divided
into two groups in order to ac
commodate the extra day of ser
vice. Some workers will work
shifts from Monday to Friday,
while others will work from Tues

day until Saturday.
Rivera said that there will be no
differences in pay or hours
worked for the two shift groups.
"It will be the exact same [total]
budget," Church said. "We have
not added staff or changed any
thing; the old number workers is
still the same."
Rivera said that the custodial
workers have accepted the new
plan, although not without initial
reservations.
"We know it is going to be
somewhat inconvenient for those
who will have to work the Tues
day to Saturday schedule,"
Rivera said. "But we understand
the management's overall goal in
providing better service to the
students, and we want to be part
ners in that."
Since most workers are expect
ed to prefer not to work on Satur
day, Church explained that those
employees assigned on the week
end have either volunteered or
were fully informed before being
hired that they might have to work
on weekends.
"About a year ago we looked at
the job description that the staff
were being hired under," Church
said. "We made it clear that week
end work could be part of their
role if they were on the second
shift."
Rivera said that the Saturday
service will be oriented toward
general cleaning and waste dispos
al issues, while more intricate or
less pressing tasks will be saved for
the more heavily staffed weekday

Tuesday to Saturday, allowing dorms to be cleaned six days a week.
(leaning rounds.
"As we are starting out, two
teams of five custodians and one
lead custodian, 12 total will work
on the weekends," Church said.
During the weekdays, she said
the count of janitors servicing
campus dorms can be as many as
55.
The custodial staff will also
cope with the staff adjustment by
adopting a team-based strategy
toward cleaning the dorms on
days when stall has lower num

bers.
"1 lopeliilly we will be more ef
ficient and be able to have the
same service level," Church said.
"I think it is great that they will
be adding Saturday service," said
sophomore Tininit Cebru. "It can
be very annoying when the bath
rooms and other areas of the
dorms are not serviced for extend
ed periods of time. I lopeliilly this
new plan will help alleviate the
messes that occur on weekends."
Church concluded, "I want to
get input from residents if they see
any changes in the services. We
will probably be reaching out to
and surveying students to adjust
things if needed."
