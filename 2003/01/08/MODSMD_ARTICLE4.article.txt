# On-campus construction progresses

Even as students went home for the holidays, con
struction continued on campus at various locations.
Renovations on existing facilities, new building con
struction and other upgrades around campus have
been progressing for the last tew months and even
years.
While other University programs have suffered
from budget cuts, all the construction projects remain
unaffected, staying on schedule and within budget.
"Projects that are currently in construction have al
ready been funded from previous budgets and will,
therefore, not be impacted by recent or future budget
cuts," said Jack Cleary, the director of the department
of project management. "All capital projects are pro
ceeding on time and within their Board of Trustees
approved budgets."
He added, "1 lowever, the current planning efforts
for future building projects are cognizant of the con

straints on funding and the current fiscal environ
ment."
In fact, bad weather seems to be the main problem
that campus projects are facing.
"Although a typical project experiences many dif
ferent obstacles throughout design and construction,
the recent storms have been challenging for complet
ing exterior and landscaping work on certain pro
jects," Cleary said. "However, each project schedule
includes a contingency for typical rain and weather
delays, so we do not anticipate that these recent
storms will have an impact on the final completion
dates for any project."
Construction is currently underway at Brainier
Hall, where changes will include a seismic renovation
as well as improvements to the electrical transformers
and kitchen.
Susan Rozakis, project manager for Pl anner's seis
mic renovation, echoed Cllearly's comments.
" The storms were tough, but we
plan lor inclement weather during
the project, and a couple weeks of
clear skies is great," she said.
"I'The Branner I fall project] isa
historic seismic renovation pro
ject," she added. "[lt] is on sched
ule and within budget and is pro
gressing smoothly."
()ther changes to Branner have
also been implemented without
major problems.
"The project is on budget and
still scheduled for opening in June
2003," said Mark Bonino, project
manager for the Branner kitchen,
lie reported that inclement
weather has been a c hallenge, but
noted that the project is generally
progressing well with additional
construction starting.
Other aspects of the project,
including the improvement to

the transformers, have been
completed.
"To put it in the simplest
terms, prior to the upgrade, we
had a transformer in the base
ment of Branner," said Dan Lo,
the project manger for the high
volt upgrade. "We removed the
existing indoor transformer and
moved it to the outside, near the
basement, on a concrete pad.
There's definitely a safety im
provement with this change, be
cause the transformer no longer
is inside the building. For my
part, I think it went well, and it
was finished on time."
Other on-campus projects in
clude the construction of the
Lokey Chem-Bio building and
James H. Clark Center for Bio
medical Engineering and Sci
ences, which will serve as the hub
of the Bio-X program. Both are
scheduled for completion later this
year, with the Clark Center slated
for May 30 and the Chem-Bio
building targeted for Sept. 1.

renovation, improvements to the kitchen and to the electrical transformers.
Despite University budget cuts, the entire renovation is on schedule to finish
in June 2003.
