Even as students went home for the holidays, con
struction continued on campus at various locations.
Renovations on existing facilities, new building con
struction and other upgrades around campus have
been progressing for the last tew months and even
years.
While other University programs have suffered
from budget cuts, all the construction projects remain
unaffected, staying on schedule and within budget.
"Projects that are currently in construction have al
ready been funded from previous budgets and will,
therefore, not be impacted by recent or future budget
cuts," said Jack Cleary, the director of the department
of project management. "All capital projects are pro
ceeding on time and within their Board of Trustees
approved budgets."
He added, "1 lowever, the current planning efforts
for future building projects are cognizant of the con

straints on funding and the current fiscal environ
ment."
In fact, bad weather seems to be the main problem
that campus projects are facing.
"Although a typical project experiences many dif
ferent obstacles throughout design and construction,
the recent storms have been challenging for complet
ing exterior and landscaping work on certain pro
jects," Cleary said. "However, each project schedule
includes a contingency for typical rain and weather
delays, so we do not anticipate that these recent
storms will have an impact on the final completion
dates for any project."
Construction is currently underway at Brainier
Hall, where changes will include a seismic renovation
as well as improvements to the electrical transformers
and kitchen.
Susan Rozakis, project manager for Pl anner's seis
mic renovation, echoed Cllearly's comments.
