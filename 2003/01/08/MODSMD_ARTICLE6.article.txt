### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faced with rapidly increasing
amounts of'unsolicited elect ronic: ad
vertising, the University's Informa
tion and lechnology Systems and
Services department recently imple
mented a filtering system for all Stan
ford e-mail ac counts. The software is
designed to detect "spam," unsolicit
ed e-mail that urges users to invest in
various items such as rape repellents
and Viagra.
The anti-spam filter was imple
mented on Dec. 19. It scans all of'the
approximately 35,000 Stanford e
mail accounts but does not look at
messages forwarded to non-Stan
ford accounts such as Yahoo or I lot

mail, which make up about one
third of the e-mail passing through
the University's server.
Ihe software — called I'lire Mes
sage and produced by the vendor
ActiveState — scans all incoming
messages and compares their con
tents with common words and
phrases used by spammers. If a
match is made, the mail is delivered
with a |SPAM:#I tag added to its
subject line. The number of"#"
signs indicate how certain the sys
tem is that your email qualifies as
spam, lb get one "#" the system
must bess percent <ertain that it has
found spam. Kacli "#" after that is
another 5 to 10 percent of certainty.
