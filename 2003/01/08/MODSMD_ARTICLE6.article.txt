# New software counters growing campus spam
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Faced with rapidly increasing
amounts of'unsolicited elect ronic: ad
vertising, the University's Informa
tion and lechnology Systems and
Services department recently imple
mented a filtering system for all Stan
ford e-mail ac counts. The software is
designed to detect "spam," unsolicit
ed e-mail that urges users to invest in
various items such as rape repellents
and Viagra.
The anti-spam filter was imple
mented on Dec. 19. It scans all of'the
approximately 35,000 Stanford e
mail accounts but does not look at
messages forwarded to non-Stan
ford accounts such as Yahoo or I lot

mail, which make up about one
third of the e-mail passing through
the University's server.
Ihe software — called I'lire Mes
sage and produced by the vendor
ActiveState — scans all incoming
messages and compares their con
tents with common words and
phrases used by spammers. If a
match is made, the mail is delivered
with a |SPAM:#I tag added to its
subject line. The number of"#"
signs indicate how certain the sys
tem is that your email qualifies as
spam, lb get one "#" the system
must bess percent <ertain that it has
found spam. Kacli "#" after that is
another 5 to 10 percent of certainty.


GINA HSIEH/The Stanford Daily
Staff members at 1 I SS reported
that the program has been successful
both in its pilot stage and in its cur
rent, fully implemented incarnation.
Roughly half a million e-mails were
tagged as spam between Dec. l'> 1 and
Jan. 6. From these e-mails, I FSS re
ceived only 500 reports of false posi
tives — incorrectly tagged spam.
"It seems like a worthwhile in
vestment," said freshman Chris
Couvelier. "Anything that saves me
from silting through useless spam
seems like a positive thing."
Other students expressed sur
prise at the need for the software.
"1 never really noticed that many
weird e-mails — only one or two,"
said freshman Elizabeth Gibbons. "1
never knew that there was any need
lot* a filter."
ITSS staff said that the program
has received a great deal of positive
feedback, including a message from
a doctoral student claiming, "It
makes me feel that even though 1 get

a lot of junk mail, I'm not going to
end up drowning in it. Keep up the
good work!"
There have also been some com
plaints, most of them fcxusingon im
portant e-mails that the program la
beled as spam.
Until Feb. 2002, spam was dealt
with on an e-mail-by-e-mail basis:
users could forward spam to a spe
cial campus "junk mail" address,
where ITSS would attempt to stop
spam by contacting the Internet ser
vice providers who transmitted the
messages to Stanford servers.
According to Xueshan Feng,
technical manager for ITSS, some
ISPs paid little attention to the Uni
versity's concerns.
"The spam was becoming un
manageable," Feng said. "There
were over 800 complaints per day."
ITSS decided that a filtration soft
ware was worth the cost because, ac
cording to Feng, the substantial
amount of spam created "a loss of
productivity, wasting computing re
sources and time, and also a loss in
reputation:'('.an't a reputable univer
sity like Stanford do something?' "
She noted that percent of e

mail passing through the Universi
ty's servei between Dec . .'*l and Jan.
(> of this year was labeled spam and
that the amount of "junk mail" sent
to Stanford accounts has doubled in
the last 12 months.
Many have asked why the server
doesn't just block out spam automat
ically, but dec I lie Bennett, II SS di
rector of information security ser
vices, told the Stanford Report that
blocking spam might infringe 011
users' academic freedom or privacy.
"What's spam to me might not be
spam to everybody else," Bennett
said.
Other universities face similar
spam problems. Using an approach
similar to Stanford's, universities like
Princeton, Purdue and the Universi
ty of lowa have been blocking
known and rampant spammers and
warning users about activities that
increase spam, such as giving away
personal information on insecure
Web sites.
"I heard more and more people
[say] they love the system," Feng
said. "It saves people a lot of time. It's
obviously a win implementation, ac -
cording to most users' feedback."

ically, but dec I lie Bennett, II SS di
rector of information security ser
vices, told the Stanford Report that
blocking spam might infringe 011
users' academic freedom or privacy.
"What's spam to me might not be
spam to everybody else," Bennett
said.
Other universities face similar
spam problems. Using an approach
similar to Stanford's, universities like
Princeton, Purdue and the Universi
ty of lowa have been blocking
known and rampant spammers and
warning users about activities that
increase spam, such as giving away
personal information on insecure
Web sites.
"I heard more and more people
[say] they love the system," Feng
said. "It saves people a lot of time. It's
obviously a win implementation, ac -
cording to most users' feedback."
