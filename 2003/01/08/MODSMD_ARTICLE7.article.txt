### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
After locking horns with University administrators for
months over the alignment of two trails on the Stanford cam
pus, a coalition of environmental advocates was dealt a major
blow by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors over
the winter break. Of the five trail alignments previously
under consideration, the board decided not to call for fur
ther study of the two most favored by activists from the Stan
lord Open Space Alliance and other local groups.
fhe three remaining trail alignments are preferred by the
University because they skirt the campus's borders rather
than cutting through the interior of Stanford lands, fhe Uni
versity is required to dedicate two permanent trails as a part
of the general use permit signed by Stanford and the county
in December 2000.
Prompted by advice from County Counsel Ann Miller
Ravel, the board backed away from earlier demands that the
University fund supplemental environmental impact re
ports of all five alignments, a procedure that would have cost
$ 172,555, according to the San Jose Mercury News.
Representatives from SOSA and the Committee for
Green Foothills have characterized the board's decision as a
sign that the county is cowed by Stanford's legal clout.
"Ihe county is so scared of a lawsuit, all Stanford has to do
is threaten one and they cave in," S( )SA director Peter Drek
meier told the Palo Alto Weekly.
A statement on the Committee for Green Foothills' Web
site decried the board's acquiescence to the University's "bul
lying tactics," arguing that (lie remaining alignments are un
safe, unsightly and environmentally unsound due to their
proximity to roadways and sensitive creek areas.
(lounty Supervisor I jz Kniss has also expressed disappoint
ment at the results, but said the board lacked legal ground for
forcing (he University to finance impact reports on alignments
it considered infeasible. She told the Mercury News that, on the
upside, the three remaining proposals have been significantly
improved from their original form over tin- past year.
"It's a compromise solution, as are many political solu
tions," she said.
Stanford officials have said they are pleased with the
board's decision.
