# State schools face $10.2 billion cut
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Faced with a soaring $34.8 billion budget deficit,
California Gov. Gray Davis has proposed a $10.2 bil
lion reduction in the education budget for the current
and following fiscal years. The plan will cut $350 mil
lion from public colleges and universities this year.
While discussing the cuts, Stanford Prof, of Edu
cation Michael Kirst, a leading expert in the field of
state education policy, said that they would harm the
state's educational system but were nonetheless un
avoidable.
"Even bigger cuts must come for the next two years
to balance the budget," Kirst said. "California educa
tion will incrementally erode."
1 he proposed reductions include cuts instate allo
cations for administration, student services and re
search, and $19 million in unallocated reductions.
Overall, the system's budget is 5.2 percent smaller
than last year's.
According to Kirst, Stanford will not be significant
ly impacted by the proposed budget cuts and stands to
lose less than other schools in California.
"[Stanford doesn't] get a lot of money from the
state,"he said. "We just use the state to float tax-ex
empt bonds."
The University of California system, having seen its
state funds cut by $184 million during the 2002-03 fis
cal year, now faces an additional $74 million in reduc
tions under the governor's proposal.
"[The proposed budget cuts] are particularly diffi
cult because we have already taken significant cuts,"
Brad Hay ward, a spokesman for the UC system, told
the Chronicle for I iigher Education. "The good news
is that we had hoped the governor would protect in
structional programs, and he has done that."
1 n the 2002-03 fiscal year, education comprised ap
proximately 43 percent of California's budget. As
such, it stood out as one of the leading candidates for
the governor's budget cuts.
"I don't know that |I)avis] had many options,"
Kirst said. "IP" "nd $35 billion to cut,
it's hard to exempt 50 percent of
the budget."
This year California's school
systems received varied appropri
ations for higher education. The
UC system has seen a 3.2 percent
decrease in 112 unding, the California
State University school system has
seen a 1.0 percent decrease, and
community colleges have seen a
5.3 percent increase.
"Davis's cut is just the beginning
of a several-year decline in re
sources for California education,"
Kirst said. "It addresses only a por
tion of the cuts that will
come . .. more will be announced
in his Friday budget."
In order to mitigate the effects
of the governor's proposal, the UC
system has asked its Board of Re
gents to approve a $135 per-stu

dent increase in mandatory sys
tem-wide student fees for the
spring of 2003. Student fees for
professional school programs
would increase by $150 to $400
per quarter in addition to the $ 135
system-wide increase.
Community colleges will feel
the biggest impact from the pro

posed budget decrease, because
their tuition increases cannot off
set cuts. The least impacted sys
tems will be elementary and sec
ondary schools.
"Elementary and secondary
[schools] will increase class sizes
and cut high school electives in the
first round of cuts," Kirst said.

I listorically, appropriations for
education have outpaced (he rate
of inflation.
"Between 1995 and 2000, Cal
ifornia schools were booming by
[staying ahead of] inflation,"
Kirst said.
According to a survey conduct
ed by the Center for the Study of
Education Policy at Illinois State
University on spending plans that
states adopted for the current
2002-03 fiscal year, aggregate ap
propriations for higher education
increased by 1.2 percent, failing to
keep pace with the 2 percent infla
tion rate. This figure is slightly
higher than one-fourth of last
year's 4.6 percent increase and t he
smallest such rise since the 1992-
93 fiscal year, which saw a 0.9 per
cent decrease.
California's appropriations for
higher education saw a 1.2 per
cent increase from the previous
fiscal year, which is the national
average.
