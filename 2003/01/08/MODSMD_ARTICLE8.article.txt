Faced with a soaring $34.8 billion budget deficit,
California Gov. Gray Davis has proposed a $10.2 bil
lion reduction in the education budget for the current
and following fiscal years. The plan will cut $350 mil
lion from public colleges and universities this year.
While discussing the cuts, Stanford Prof, of Edu

state education policy, said that they would harm the
state's educational system but were nonetheless un

"[Stanford doesn't] get a lot of money from the
state,"he said. "We just use the state to float tax-ex

The University of California system, having seen its
state funds cut by $184 million during the 2002-03 fis
cal year, now faces an additional $74 million in reduc
tions under the governor's proposal.
"[The proposed budget cuts] are particularly diffi
cult because we have already taken significant cuts,"
Brad Hay ward, a spokesman for the UC system, told
the Chronicle for I iigher Education. "The good news
is that we had hoped the governor would protect in
structional programs, and he has done that."
1 n the 2002-03 fiscal year, education comprised ap
proximately 43 percent of California's budget. As
such, it stood out as one of the leading candidates for
the governor's budget cuts.
"I don't know that |I)avis] had many options,"
Kirst said. "IP" "nd $35 billion to cut,
