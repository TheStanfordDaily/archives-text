ODC/San Francisco
January 11, 8:00 pm / Memorial Auditorium
When ODC/San Francisco finally
runs out of energy, the world as we
know it will undoubtedly have long
turned into dust.
—Contra Costa Times
Squonk Opera's Inferno
January 17, 8:00 pm / Memorial Auditorium
A blazingly unique spectacle! A food
of contraptions, visual jokes, and
gloriously eccentric music...
—Time Out New York
