Eleanor Holmes Norton & Joan Steinau Lester
with
Fire In My Soul
by Joan Steinau Lester, Maya Angelou,
and Eleanor Holmes Norton
Friday, January 10,2003
12:00 noon • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
U.S. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton is
an impassioned civil rights activist, hard-driving
legislator, and one of the most powerful women
in American history. They call her
the "Warrior on the Hill," acknowledging the
battles she's waged as a political pioneer across
more than four decades of American history.
Perhaps more than anyone else, she has taken
to heart Eleanor Roosevelt's famous
pronouncement that "every political woman
needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros
hide." Joan Steinau Lester shared much of the
last forty years with Eleanor Holmes Norton.
They met in 1958 when they were both students
at Antioch College. Now an acclaimed author,
Lester shares her friendship with the
congresswoman and tells the story of one
woman's rise to leadership. Charting forty years
of political and personal challenge, Fire in My
Soul shows Norton marching on the Capitol to
demand a Senate hearing for Anita Hill; grilling
Army generals about sex abuse; arguing before
the Supreme Court to uphold first amendment
rights, even fora segregationist; and much more.
Norton's story is organically linked to
Washington, D.C., home to her family for four
generations, and reveals why she is now the
voice of the city. This fascinating
biography, told largely in Norton's words, show
cases as never before the many facets of a
woman who remains an iconic torch-bearer for
the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Scores
of conversations with Norton and nearly a hun
dred interviews with colleagues, family, and
friends have made Fire in My Soul a remarkable
document of how one extraordinary woman
helped to effect lasting change in the ways we
interact across racial and gender lines.
