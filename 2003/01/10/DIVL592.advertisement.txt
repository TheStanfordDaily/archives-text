This course looks at works by major artists of Germany and the Netherlands such as Albrecht Diirer,
Hieronymous Bosch, Mattias Grtinewald, Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, Hans Holbein, Lucas
Cranach, and Pieter Brueghel. Emphasis is on altarpieces and their iconographical and liturgical func
tions; the development of portraiture; representations of class and gender in pilgrimages and other mor
alizing subjects; devotional images including the Virgin and saints; the impact of north-south exchanges
upon painting practices and the selection of subjects; the role of patronage and art collecting; and the

152A/352A. El Camino Real: The Architecture of California's Great Highway
This course looks at the architecture along El Camino Real, the historic highway that stretches from San
Diego to Sonoma County. The class will look at a wide range of buildings on the highway, from Native
American structures and Spanish missions to motels and suburban houses. Students will explore how
the highway disseminated ideas about religion, business, and leisure throughout the state and helped cre
ate the farms, universities, and cities that comprise El Camino Real today.
Professor William Littmann MWF 11:00-12:15
192A/392A. The Arts of Africa
The arts of black sub-Saharan African cultures such as ancient Nigeria, and coastal and Sudanic Africa
including the Yoruba, Igbo, Dogon, and Senufo. Artistic traditions in their social context and as myth, rit
ual, music, dance, and world view.
Professor Roberta Reid TTH 2:15-3:30
241 A/ 541 A. The Aesthetic of the Grotesque in the 20th Century
Dadaists and Surrealists, including Hannah Hoch, Hans Bellmer, Cindy Sherman, Matthew Barney, and
John Miller, created bodies of work based on the monstrous, abject, and formless. This seminar explores
the central role of the grotesque in the history, practice, and theories of art in the 20th century.
Professor Maria Makela T 1:15-3:05
2838. Issues in Contemporary Chinese Art
During the last decade, Chinese artists have developed one of the world's most active and inventive art
scenes. In this course we will see how artists have combined their rigorous, government controlled art
training with a no-holds barred attitude toward artistic creation, resulting in works that alternately
beguile and shock the international art world. Among other things, we shall focus on how art reflects
social and political changes. This course should be relevant to anyone with an interest in contemporary
art, contemporary China, or the phenomenon of globalization.
