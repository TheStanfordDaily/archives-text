## Investigators search for cause of crash 
### 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) â€” In
vestigators seeking the cause of a
commuter plane crash said yester
day the aircraft was near its maxi
mum weight and a recently adjust
ed tail assembly controlling the
plane's lift was moving unusually
during the 37 seconds the doomed
flight was in the air.
The up-and-down motion
began after the plane underwent
routine maintenance Monday
night and showed up during all
eight flights before Wednesday's
crash, said John Goglia, a Nation
al Transportation Safety Board
member.
The flight data recorder pulled
out of the smoldering wreckage

confirmed the unusual movement
was also present just before the
crash that killed 21 people.
A team of NTSB investigators
was sent to the Raytheon Aero
space facility in Ceredo, W.Va.,
where the maintenance was done.
"We need to know which proce
dures were followed," Goglia said.
Goglia said the plane was about
100 pounds below its maximum
weight at takeoff. He said pilots,
mechanics, gate agents and bag
gage handlers interviewed by in
vestigators said they thought the
plane "looked heavy."
"We have enough concern that
we're going to follow that to its con
clusion," Goglia said.
