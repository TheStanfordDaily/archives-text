WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush has no timetable for determining
whether to forcibly disarm Iraq, the
White House said yesterday after hint
ing for weeks that a decision would
quickly follow a U.N. report at the end
of the month.
A report from the U.N. weapons in
spectors, now two months into their
search for nuclear, chemical and biolog
ical weapons in Iraq, is due Jan. 27. U.S.
officials had indicated Bush would de
cide shortly thereafter whether a mili
tary confrontation was necessary to rid
Saddam Hussein of the weapons of
mass destruction the United States be

lieves he has.
Yesterday, Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer termed the deadline merely
"an important reporting date."
Fleischer also suggested that the
United States' military buildup could be
useful as a tactic to prod the Iraqi leader
to comply with U.N. requirements.
"The military has effective influence
on diplomacy and making sure that
Saddam Hussein understands that he
needs to comply," Fleischer said. "Be
cause if he doesn't, the United States
has the means and the ability to make
him comply."
Underscoring war preparations, the

Marine Corps said it had taken the un
usual step of stopping all Mannes, ac
tive-duty as well as reserve, from leaving
the service for the coming 12 months.
The last time the Marines took this ac
tion, known as "stop-loss," was during
the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War, said
Capt. Gabrielle Chapin, a spokes
woman at the Combat Development
Command at Quantico, Va.
At the White House, the administra
tion cast the inspectors' assessment yes
terday of Iraq's 12,000-page weapons
declaration as supporting the U.S. posi
tion that Iraq has so far failed to prove it
does not possess banned weapons.
