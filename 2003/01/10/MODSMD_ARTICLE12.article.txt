# North Korea out of NPT

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” North
Korea said today that it was withdrawing
from the global nuclear arms control treaty
and denounced what it called U.S. aggres
sion, but said it had no plans to develop nu
clear weapons.
The North Korean action was likely to
heighten tension over North Korea's nu
clear development as the United States and
its allies seek a diplomatic solution to the
problem.
"We can no longer remain bound to the
NPT, allowing the country's security and
the dignity of our nation to be infringed
upon," the North Korean government said
in a statement carried on KCNA, its official
news agency.
In 1993, North Korea also announced

that it was withdrawing from the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
but later suspended the decision and en
tered talks with the United States.
The announcement came as New Mexi
co Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.N. am
bassador, acted as a surprise intermediary
between the United States and North
Korea. He met yesterday night in his state
with two envoys from the communist coun
try in what observers hoped could augur an
easing of tension.
The withdrawal from the NPT could sig
nal that North Korea plans to push ahead
with its nuclear weapons programs, or that
it is trying to pressure the United States into
concessions with a tactic known as
brinkmanship.
