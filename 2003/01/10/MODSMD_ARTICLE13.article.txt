## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford should protect privacy of int'l students 
### 
The FBI recently sent letters to
many universities and colleges
around the U.S. asking them to
provide the government with
personal information about their foreign
students and faculty — without notifying the
students or faculty members. This informa
tion could include names, addresses, tele
phone numbers, citizenship information
and any foreign address information.
The FBl's request infringes upon the pri
vacy of foreign students and faculty in the
U.S. If Stanford receives any such inquiries,
we urge the University administration not to
release any private information without a
subpoena or court order.
Many government officials and higher
education groups also believe that if univer-

sities provide the information voluntarily,
they would be violating federal law, even
under the USA Patriot Act, which has al
ready proven itself an infringement upon
civil liberties.
In a recent letter to Attorney General
John Ashcroft, U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-
Vt.) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) wrote,
"ffhe Patriot Act] requires both a court
order and a showing that the request is
specifically tailored to a terrorism investiga
tion. The FBI request does not appear to ful
fill either of these requirements."
According to University officials, Stan
ford has not received any FBI requests for
information. But if it does, University Coun
cil Lauren Schoenthaler has assured the
Stanford community that, under its current

policy, the University will not release any
private information without a court order
or subpoena.
We applaud Stanford for continuing to
protect the privacy of its students and staff,
especially at a time when the Bush adminis
tration is trying to make it more and more
difficult to do so. But if the University
changes its current policy, for whatever rea
son, the Stanford community should be no
tified, and the rights of foreign students and
faculty should be respected.
The FBI request is the latest attempt by
the Bush administration to scapegoat the en
tire foreign student community for the
heinous crimes of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers.
For example, in December, six Middle
Eastern college students in Colorado were

arrested for not taking enough courses to
satisfy their visa requirements.
Instead of making the U.S. more secure,
these policies will increase resentment of the
U.S. from people throughout the world —
the last thing the country needs if it wants a
truly successful war on terrorism.
Stanford prides itself on having a vibrant
international undergraduate and graduate
community; just recently the University ad
mitted students early from 23 different
countries to its undergraduate Class of
2007. If Stanford wants to uphold its repu
tation as one of the best institutions for
higher learning for students all around the
world, it should oppose any U.S. policy that
would harm the privacy and rights of its for
eign students.
