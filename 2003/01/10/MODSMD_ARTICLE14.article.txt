# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford's new stem cell research merits scrutiny 
### ILIAS CHRISSOCHOIDIS GUEST COLUMNIST 
When big business meets academia,
only one gets infected. We had a foretaste
of this outcome in Stanford's publicity
gaffe over the new center on stem cell re
search.
First, the announcement came at the
end of the quarter, which is telling. Con
troversial decisions (say, the renewal of
Stanford's contract with >Nike) become
public when there is hardly any public
around to question them. Second, the
publicity was disingenuous, implying ap
proval from federal authorities, when in
fact the opposite was true. And following
strong protests from the latter, officials be
came frivolous by playing with term defi
nitions. ("It depends on how you define
sex," said a former president). Finally and
most crucial, the whole setting exudes the
kind of mysticism so prevalent in corpo
rate management. Who is the anonymous
donor of the center's $12 million endow
ment? Why would Stanford deceive the
public for his sake? What's going on here?
Filings become more intelligible if we
place this embarrassing incident in the con
text of the "Clark Affair." Three years ago,
a legendary Silicon Valley entrepreneur,
Jim Clark, donated $150 million for Stan
ford's Bio-X program. At the time, no one
bothered to mention his financial involve
ment with the genetics company DNA Sci
ences. For Stanford, the timing was perfect:
The University was welcoming a new
provost (a good friend of Clark, by the way)
and musing about its next president.
But then, Ceorge W. Bush came to the
White House and decided to enforce his
moral imperatives: To the extent that stem
cell research necessitates the destruction of
human embryos, it should be highly re
stricted. Although we are told the Bio-X
program has little to do with this type of re
search, Clark decided to gamble with it for
the sake of I )N A Sciences, which would cer
tainly be affected by the new policies. In a
New York Times op-ed piece, he an
nounced the suspension of $(50 million of
his donation.
Many understood the move as nasty
blackmail: If Stanford people, including a
former provost, have the president's ear
on a daily basis, they had better help him
change tune, or else the Bio-X program
would sink for lack of funds.
Certain questions begin to pop up:
Who benefits so much from Stanford's
stem cell research center that he would
easily have donated $12 million? Why
would Stanford engage in terminological
duels and risk appearing ridiculous to the
world unless something big was at stake, as
big as $60 million? Is the inauguration of
the new center a condition for the release
of the remaining part of Clark's donation?

Can the University management assure us
that Jim Clark as a financial force, en
trepreneurial fire or inhibiting factor, has
nothing to do whatsoever with Stanford's
stem cell research center?
We are all looking forward to the day
when cancer and disease in all its ugly
forms will once and for all be banished in
the history books. Rut nothing will land us
on that shore except social consensus.
Corrupt and poorly maintained as it may
be, the federal government and its agen
cies do stand as a guarantor of such con
sensus in American society. Biotechnology
is too vital for the national interest to be left
in the hands of unpredictable en
trepreneurs who can easily sacrifice re
search programs and moral obligations
for the benefit of their business strategy.
Only idealists accept the big business
academia marriage as one governed by
mutual respect. Certainly, entrepreneurs
are delighted to work with universities â€”
it's far cheaper for them to import high
quality research from Stanford than to set
up their own laboratories. And with busi
ness-oriented officials at universities, life
becomes so easy. Occult transactions and
public fooling make the billionaire in
vestor shine as the new Carnegie.
But in the end, universities will be left
abused wives. There are university bureau
crats sabotaging federal research funding
to force their scientists go corporate. In a re
cent article, Christos Papadimitriou of UC-
Berkeley bemoaned the corporate ex
ploitation of patents, which has stifled tech
nological research and prevented millions
of computer users from getting improved
products. Academic researchers in corpo
rate contracts are often forbidden to discuss
their research even with their graduate stu
dents, let alone with colleagues.
The least we can do here at Stanford is
to refuse to close our eyes before reality. A
broad alliance of professors, researchers
and students is needed to keep in check
some of the most glaring consequences of
corporate infiltration. It is no coincidence
that Stanford management's solution to
cost-cutting this winter was to shut down
the whole library system fora third of a
month and leave open scientific laborato
ries. Stanford University cannot survive
for long with one part of its campus
drenched in millions and crowded with
Egyptian temples of technology and the
othef part suffering 8 percent cuts each
year. Replicating national levels of in
equality on campus is disastrous for all of
us. It's time to resist the division that com
mercial interests import to this communi
ty. It's time to become a real ford and
stand for Stanford's academic integrity.
