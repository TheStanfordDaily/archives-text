Monitoring inf I students is necessary
to prevent terrorism
John Hamilton's column about the
USA Patriot Act is misleading, sometimes
factually incorrect and totally ignorant of
some of the hard necessities of life in the
post-Sept. 11 world ("Faculty Senate
should take a stand against USA Patriot
Act," Jan. 9).
The Daily ran two articles on separate
but related security issues on Monday: the
FBl's request for foreign students' infor
mation and access to controlled biological
agents. Hard-won experience has shown
that these are both necessary and basic el
ements and tools of an effective program
for homeland security.
To understand the need for both of
these practices, one must examine the
events surrounding Sept. 11. Mohammed
Atta, identified as the ringleader of the
men who flew the hijacked planes into the
World Trade Center, and several of the
other 9/11 conspirators entered the Unit
ed States on visitor visas, applied to have
them changed into student visas, enrolled
and finished their course of study at flight
school, notified of the acceptance of the
change in status, exited and reentered the
United States before their student visas
were officially approved, and then, after
the heinous attacks of Sept. 11, received
their student visa approvals in the mail.
Obviously, there is a need for verification
procedures for students to prove that they
are actually enrolled in universities. The
only other viable alternative is even more
unpalatable â€” closing our universities to
international students entirely.
Registration of those who deal with bi
ological agents is also a necessary prac
tice. There is still a governmental investi
gation into the anthrax attacks on the
House and Senate office buildings. Un

documented and free access to biological
agents that are easily weaponized is invit
ing further proliferation of biological
weapons and more horrifying attacks
with biological weapons.
It is important to note that the Patriot
Act passed out of the House Judiciary
Committee with a 36-0 vote. Conserva
tives, such as Bob Barr, who now works for
the ACLU as a consultant, and liberals,
such as John Conyers and Maxine Waters,
all agreed on the merits of the bill; they
could have easily voted against it. Further
more, the final provisions within the Patri
ot Act do not have any provisions for the
indefinite detention of non-citizens.
Rather, the federal government has seven
days to detain a person, after which they
must be charged with a crime or set free,
so the government has time to request and
receive foreign intelligence data in com
piling a case.
Simply looking at the history of the ter
rorist attacks on our nation, the provisions
in the Patriot Act are necessary. Instead of
simply criticizing the legislation, Stanford
should offer its services and ideas to the
government on how to best prevent future
terrorist attacks, for this would be the best
way to maintain freedom. Those who are
interested in destroying the United States
care nothing for intellectual freedom or
dissent of any sort.

Supporters of Palestinian expulsion are
'far from powerless'
Two letters in Thursday's Daily at
tempted to defend Israel from the charge
by 800 professors that Israel is seriously
considering expelling Palestinians from
their land. "Expulsionists," writes David

Meir-Levi, "are a small and almost power
less minority." And Benjamin Klafter as
sures us "there is little danger of 'ethnic
cleansing' of the Palestinians by Israel." In
fact, those who favor expulsion are far
from powerless. Former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, a leading advocate
of expulsion, is certain to hold a high post
in the next Israeli government. If Ariel
Sharon, who is under investigation for
bribery and fraud, is found guilty, Ne
tanyahu is likely to become the next prime
minister. Therefore it is noteworthy that
in November 1989, Netanyahu was quot
ed in an Israeli newspaper as saying, "Is
rael should have taken advantage of the
suppression of demonstrations in China,
while the world's attention was focused on
these events, and should have carried out
mass deportations of Arabs from the terri
tories. Unfortunately this plan I proposed
did not gain support, yet I still suggest to
put it into action." Another former prime
minister, Yitzhak Shamir, was quoted in
the San Francisco Chronicle as calling
Palestinians "brutal, wild, alien invaders in
the land of Israel that belongs to the peo
ple of Israel and only to them."
The recently elected leader of the Na
tional Religious Party, retired general Efli
Eitan, has called Palestinians "a cancer in
the body of the nation," and is an ardent
advocate of forcible expulsion.
As for Klafter's claim that charges of
brutality against the Israeli military are "lit
tle more than propaganda," consider a
statement released last August by the Is
raeli peace group Gush Shalom. The
group accuses IDF officers of such illegal
actions as "execution without trial; pre
venting medical help from reaching the in
jured; shooting at ambulances and medical
teams; allowing populations to starve;
