Monitoring inf I students is necessary
to prevent terrorism
John Hamilton's column about the
USA Patriot Act is misleading, sometimes
factually incorrect and totally ignorant of
some of the hard necessities of life in the
post-Sept. 11 world ("Faculty Senate
should take a stand against USA Patriot
Act," Jan. 9).
The Daily ran two articles on separate
but related security issues on Monday: the
FBl's request for foreign students' infor
mation and access to controlled biological
agents. Hard-won experience has shown
that these are both necessary and basic el
ements and tools of an effective program
for homeland security.
To understand the need for both of
these practices, one must examine the
events surrounding Sept. 11. Mohammed
Atta, identified as the ringleader of the
men who flew the hijacked planes into the
World Trade Center, and several of the
other 9/11 conspirators entered the Unit
ed States on visitor visas, applied to have
them changed into student visas, enrolled
and finished their course of study at flight
school, notified of the acceptance of the
change in status, exited and reentered the
United States before their student visas
were officially approved, and then, after
the heinous attacks of Sept. 11, received
their student visa approvals in the mail.
Obviously, there is a need for verification
procedures for students to prove that they
are actually enrolled in universities. The
only other viable alternative is even more
unpalatable — closing our universities to
international students entirely.
Registration of those who deal with bi
ological agents is also a necessary prac
tice. There is still a governmental investi
gation into the anthrax attacks on the
House and Senate office buildings. Un

documented and free access to biological
agents that are easily weaponized is invit
ing further proliferation of biological
weapons and more horrifying attacks
with biological weapons.
It is important to note that the Patriot
Act passed out of the House Judiciary
Committee with a 36-0 vote. Conserva
tives, such as Bob Barr, who now works for
the ACLU as a consultant, and liberals,
such as John Conyers and Maxine Waters,
all agreed on the merits of the bill; they
could have easily voted against it. Further
more, the final provisions within the Patri
ot Act do not have any provisions for the
indefinite detention of non-citizens.
Rather, the federal government has seven
days to detain a person, after which they
must be charged with a crime or set free,
so the government has time to request and
receive foreign intelligence data in com
piling a case.
Simply looking at the history of the ter
rorist attacks on our nation, the provisions
in the Patriot Act are necessary. Instead of
simply criticizing the legislation, Stanford
should offer its services and ideas to the
government on how to best prevent future
terrorist attacks, for this would be the best
way to maintain freedom. Those who are
interested in destroying the United States
care nothing for intellectual freedom or
dissent of any sort.

Supporters of Palestinian expulsion are
'far from powerless'
Two letters in Thursday's Daily at
tempted to defend Israel from the charge
by 800 professors that Israel is seriously
considering expelling Palestinians from
their land. "Expulsionists," writes David

Meir-Levi, "are a small and almost power
less minority." And Benjamin Klafter as
sures us "there is little danger of 'ethnic
cleansing' of the Palestinians by Israel." In
fact, those who favor expulsion are far
from powerless. Former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, a leading advocate
of expulsion, is certain to hold a high post
in the next Israeli government. If Ariel
Sharon, who is under investigation for
bribery and fraud, is found guilty, Ne
tanyahu is likely to become the next prime
minister. Therefore it is noteworthy that
in November 1989, Netanyahu was quot
ed in an Israeli newspaper as saying, "Is
rael should have taken advantage of the
suppression of demonstrations in China,
while the world's attention was focused on
these events, and should have carried out
mass deportations of Arabs from the terri
tories. Unfortunately this plan I proposed
did not gain support, yet I still suggest to
put it into action." Another former prime
minister, Yitzhak Shamir, was quoted in
the San Francisco Chronicle as calling
Palestinians "brutal, wild, alien invaders in
the land of Israel that belongs to the peo
ple of Israel and only to them."
The recently elected leader of the Na
tional Religious Party, retired general Efli
Eitan, has called Palestinians "a cancer in
the body of the nation," and is an ardent
advocate of forcible expulsion.
As for Klafter's claim that charges of
brutality against the Israeli military are "lit
tle more than propaganda," consider a
statement released last August by the Is
raeli peace group Gush Shalom. The
group accuses IDF officers of such illegal
actions as "execution without trial; pre
venting medical help from reaching the in
jured; shooting at ambulances and medical
teams; allowing populations to starve;
dropping bombs on residential areas;
wholesale destruction of houses." Amnesty
International has repeatedly accused Is
rael of torturing prisoners, and last month
62 United Nations staff members sent a let
ter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
complaining that U.N. relief workers were
being "verbally abused, stripped, beaten,
shot at and killed by Israeli soldiers."
There is no possible excuse for the sui
cide bombings by Palestinians that have
taken the lives of hundreds of Israelis, but
it seems evideut that the only way to stop
such violence is for Israel to stop punish
ing beyond endurance the entire Pales
tinian population and to agree to a just
peace.

Israel has not practiced ethnic cleansing
Prof. Joel Beinin's letter tells us that
ethnic cleansing is a crime against human
ity, which is true. ("Professors call for
Americans to speak out," Jan. 8). [Editor's
note: Beinin is one of 800 American pro
fessors who co-signed the letter.] But then
he goes on to accuse Israel because its lead
ership "might" expel Palestinian-Arabs liv
ing on the West Bank and Gaza. The last I
heard, you cannot prosecute a crime be
fore it is committed. Israel is a multi-cul
tural, multi-religious, pluralistic nation
that is suffering nearly daily attacks from
its Palestinian neighbors. It has not prac
ticed ethnic cleansing against the Palestini
ans, though there is ample reason that
they might be tempted to do so.
Let us imagine that a huge, undocu
mented population of Mexicans,
Nicaraguans and Guatemalans enter the
United States without obtaining legal
visas. Let us imagine they settle in Fresno
County, increasing that population by mil

lions. Let us imagine they regularly send
bands of their own out to firebomb, snipe,
kidnap and murder, or blow up hundreds
of Californians in nearby communities.
What if they decided to expel any non-
Latino living in Fresno County? What if
they demanded that non-Latino Californi
ans could not build any more houses in
Fresno County? Then imagine that they
decide they want Fresno County as their
own independent nation.
But they lived there first, you say? Well,
it is true that Mexico used to own Califor
nia. In fact, many Mexican descendants
are U.S. citizens who can own property,
vote and have full legal rights. But do the
ones who came after the U.S. became the
sovereign power in California suddenly
have the right to expel, forbid, kill and
maim, and demand "independence" sim
ply because they now live there?
Israel is struggling to find a way to end
the conflict with little help from the Pales
tinian Authority or even from the Palestini
an people. I don't know how diis is going to
end, but I am sure that Prof. Beinin's wolf
cries are without merit and that he is trying
to pull the wool over all of our eyes with this
unjustified attack on the integrity of Israel.

Stanford's bullying over trails has
serious long-term implications
At a meeting over winter break, the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors caved in
to the bullying from Stanford on the issue of
community trails. The board discreedy
voted to remove from further study the two
trails recommended by their County Parks
and Recreation staff, including the "Cherry
Stem" route, which was only minimally in
trusive into Stanford land.
The trails left for consideration consti
tute inferior roadside pathways that do
not even start to approach the good and
safe connectivity to the Arastradero pre
serve that is an implicit requirement in the
Stanford Ceneral Use Permit (GUP). So

much for any real mitigation for Sum
ford's massive development proposals!
This latest phase started with the intim
idation described by the local news in Palo
Alto as a "full court press" by Stanford
management. An editorial noted that "no
one can recall any precedent for such
high-level lobbying behind closed doors."
That was followed by a barrage of litiga
tion threats from Stanford management's
army of lawyers.
Because there was minimal notice relat
ed to this vote, it took place with no debate
in an eerily deserted auditorium — a
marked contrast with the previous crowd
ed meetings on the issue.
What is of particular concern is that a
new precedent is now becoming estab
lished where on an issue of primary con
cern to a given district, the board no longer
defers broadly to the supervisor for that
district. Thus the concerns of the Palo Alto
and Stanford communities with Stanford
foothills issues are likely to be effectively ig
nored, as they were in this case. That has
very serious implications for the longer
term, particularly when we have Stanford
managements whose values appear to mir
ror closely the current corporate ethic.

A personal encounter with smallpox
I am writing about Bruce Berkowitz's
article, "Getting ahead of the biowarfare
threat" (Jan. 7). I thought perhaps you
might like to hear from one of the vaccine
injured by the Dryvax smallpox vaccine.
My decision to bring forth my story of
having been injured by the smallpox vac
cine as a child was not made lightly. I share
my store because of a sense of duty, for his
torical perspective, and because, as a for
mer journalist, I know the importance of
presenting both sides of the story, given
the increasingly raucous national debate
about smallpox inoculations.
It is as critical that I talk about my ex
perience with contact eczema vaccinatum

as it is that critical that Dr. Vincent Fulgini
ti, as a young pediatrician at Colorado
General Hospital in Denver, give the de
tails of his work during the 1960s treating
the worst cases, worldwide, of those in
jured by the smallpox vaccine.
My path crossed Fulginti's path on
June 11, when I was the last speaker in San
Antonio at the last of four nationwide Ad
visory Committee on Immunization Prac
tices forums. I was never inoculated
against smallpox. The serum from some
one else's smallpox shot entered the active
eczema outbreak on my left arm when I
wasjust beginning fourth grade at William
Penn Elementary School. An horrific in
fection erupted, with more than 80 pus
tules breaking out on my left arm. Who
passed the vaccinia virus to me will always
remain a mystery.
The infection almost cost me my left
arm. My life would have been wholly dif
ferent if my left arm had been surgically
amputated. I would never have played the
violin nor taught swimming during my
summers home from Humboldt State.
Working as a writer would have been far
more challenging.
Which brings us to the current national
debate. My sentiments, like those of the old
smallpox war veterans, physicians all, who
have been quoted in newspapers through
out the country during the last several
months, is to withhold the smallpox vaccine
from as many as possible unless there is a
terrorist-induced smallpox outbreak. Then
the argument about inoculation would be
come moot. As Fulginiti recendy comment
ed, a statement with which I completely
concur, "This is not the measles vaccine."

More construction does
not mean 'progress'
The Stanford Daily printed a front-page
article with the headline, "On-campus con
struction progresses" (Jan. 8). Perhaps it
should have read "continues" rather than

"progresses." It has been my good fortune
to have lived in beautiful places. In Eng
land, I lived in Torquay, where I was born,
Southampton and Winchester, where 1
lived, and Oxford, where I studied. I also
spent time in sundry European cities, and
finally at Stanford. From the chair where I
now sit looking out at the foothills, I say,
"Thank God!"
Yesterday, my granddaughter arrived
by plane, landing at the Oakland airport. I
took time out to drive there, and we made a
loop via San Francisco to return to Stan
ford. The trip gave progress a bad name.
During part of the trip, we took Highway
280, which goes along the crest of the
foothills. The traffic-crowded freeways
were lined with ugly box-like concrete
buildings. Oakland, now notorious for its
crime, seems to have lost an opportunity to
build a beautiful airport. I certainly would
not want to leave my heart in San Francis
co. There, too, tall ugly concrete boxes have
been strewn around with no pattern, as
though thrown down by an unruly child.
When we arrived back at Stanford, our
route took us through the crowded area of
the medical center, where "construction
progresses." Heaven knows we all wish the
medical center well. It heals the sick and
conducts important research that benefits
mankind. Yet the buildings resemble
those of large urban factories. Before
reaching this construction zone, we had
just come through the new, crowded fac
ulty housing development that is in such
sharp contrast with beautiful San Juan
Hill, where I live. The decline in standards
of beauty is painfully evident.
While I would still welcome attractive
buildings nestling in vegetation, and while
I still have little regafd for those whose
lives revolve around their pooches and
who show scant interest in Stanford as an
educational institution, I want the Stan
ford administration to give a firm commit
ment not to "develop" the foothills by des
ecrating them with the ugly buildings that
are the subject of this lamentation.
