Men's Basketball
Last Night: Stanford 57, Oregon St. 54
vs. No. 12 Oregon, Saturday, 2:00 p.m.

nal men's basketball team (10-4, 1-
1 Pacific-10 Conference) overcame
a 15-point second-half deficit to
defeat Oregon State 57-54 at
Maples Pavilion last night.
Minus the victory and Lottich's
career-high 23-point perfor
mance, though, nothing went
right for Stanford.
"Well, obviously, we were fortu
nate tonight," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Oregon State did everything that
they would want to do against us."
For 32 minutes the Beavers (7-
5, 0-3) had their way with a Cardi
nal team that struggled to produce
offensively and turned the ball
over 20 times.
"We're getting out-physicalled
by everybody," Montgomery said.

"The thing is people look at us,
and we're Stanford, but we've got
sophomores [out there on the
court] and we've lost so many peo
ple. We just have to learn how
hard we have to play.
"We can't let missed shots affect
our effort. It's not going to come
over night. It's going to be a long,
painful process."
Stanford started out the first
half extremely shaky. The Cardi
nal committed five turnovers be
fore Lottich hit a long 3-pointer to
score Stanford's first basket of the
night.
The Beavers sucked the life out
of the Maples crowd early after
they went on a 7-0 run to open the
game.
It was an extremely long first
half for Stanford, which shot 39
percent from the field and only
managed to get to the charity
stripe once.
The combination of 45-percent
shooting from a hungry Oregon
State squad and 12 costly Stanford
turnovers made fora 10-point
deficit heading into the locker
room.
Moreover, the Beavers' first
half scoring came from an unex
pected source, 6-foot-l guard J.S.
Nash. Nash, who's averaging just
4.7 points per game â€” came off
