nal men's basketball team (10-4, 1-
1 Pacific-10 Conference) overcame
a 15-point second-half deficit to
defeat Oregon State 57-54 at
Maples Pavilion last night.
Minus the victory and Lottich's
career-high 23-point perfor
mance, though, nothing went
right for Stanford.
"Well, obviously, we were fortu
nate tonight," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Oregon State did everything that
they would want to do against us."
For 32 minutes the Beavers (7-
5, 0-3) had their way with a Cardi
nal team that struggled to produce
offensively and turned the ball
over 20 times.
"We're getting out-physicalled
by everybody," Montgomery said.

"The thing is people look at us,
and we're Stanford, but we've got
sophomores [out there on the
court] and we've lost so many peo
ple. We just have to learn how
hard we have to play.
"We can't let missed shots affect
our effort. It's not going to come
over night. It's going to be a long,
painful process."
Stanford started out the first
half extremely shaky. The Cardi
nal committed five turnovers be
fore Lottich hit a long 3-pointer to
score Stanford's first basket of the
night.
The Beavers sucked the life out
of the Maples crowd early after
they went on a 7-0 run to open the
game.
It was an extremely long first
half for Stanford, which shot 39
percent from the field and only
managed to get to the charity
stripe once.
The combination of 45-percent
shooting from a hungry Oregon
State squad and 12 costly Stanford
turnovers made fora 10-point
deficit heading into the locker
room.
Moreover, the Beavers' first
half scoring came from an unex
pected source, 6-foot-l guard J.S.
Nash. Nash, who's averaging just
4.7 points per game — came off

Junior guard Matt Lottich drives past Oregon State's Lamar Hurd in Stanford's
57-54 come-from-behind win at Maples Pavilion last night. Lottich scored 18
of his career-high 23 points in the final 7:12 to lift the Cardinal to the win.
the bench and scored nine. The
Cardinal held the Oregon State
big-man scoring duo of Brian
Jackson and Philip Ricci to a mea
ger eight points and seven com
bined attempts from the field.
Nash finished the game with 13
points to lead the Beavers in scor
ing while Ricci fouled out with two
minutes left to play in the midst of
Stanford's inspired comeback. He
finished with 10 points and seven
boards.
"I thought our big guys defen
sively did a good job on Jackson
and Ricci," Montgomery said.
Due the knee injury of junior
starting forward Justin Davis,
Montgomery was forced to utilize a
host of combinations in the front
court, even opt ing at times to go big
with both 6-10 sophomore Rob Lit
tle and 6-9 junior Joe Kirchofer on
the lloor at the four and five spots.
Both freshman forward Matt
Haryasz and sophomore forward
Nick Robinson saw increased play
ing time as well due to Davis' injury.
To make matters worse for the
Cardinal, sophomore swingman
Josh Childress picked up his sec
ond foul with 11:28 left to play in
the first period and was forced to
sit out the remainder of the half.
For Stanford, the opening eight
minutes of the second half looked
similar to the first 20 minutes of
play.
Childress was whistled for his
fourth foul with nearly 16 minutes
left to play, but Montgomery, in
desperate need of an offensive
spark, gambled and left the 6-8
sophomore on the court.
Two minutes later, Childress
scored on a baseline slam to bring
the Cardinal within 11 points and
revived a quiet Sixth Man Club five
minutes away from leaving to get
an early start on their problem sets.
Those who did leave, however,
missed Stanford's 20-5 run to end

the game. Lottich at one point
scored eight points in a row.
With 26 seconds left on the
clock and the game tied, Little
knocked down two critical free
throws to extend the Cardinal's
lead to two points. He finished the
game with 12 points and 11 re
bounds for his first career double
double.
After a timeout, Oregon State
guard Jimmy Haywood had the
opportunity to tie it up. He
bricked a mid-range jumper, and
the Beavers were forced to foul
again to stop the clock.
Senior guard Julius Barnes hit
one of two free throws to extend
Stanford's lead to three, and Ore
gon State ended the game by miss
ing two 3-pointers.
"Coach Montgomery told me
after the game that we deserved to
win," Oregon State head coach Jay
John said. "But they found a way
to win — that's the difference."
"We needed [the win] badly,"
Montgomery said. "Hopefully we
can build from this."
Stanford will get that opportu
nity tomorrow against No. 12 Ore
gon. The Ducks arrive at Maples
after an 88-72 loss to California last
night in Berkeley.

nal men's basketball team (10-4, 1-
1 Pacific-10 Conference) overcame
a 15-point second-half deficit to
defeat Oregon State 57-54 at
Maples Pavilion last night.
Minus the victory and Lottich's
career-high 23-point perfor
mance, though, nothing went
right for Stanford.
"Well, obviously, we were fortu
nate tonight," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Oregon State did everything that
they would want to do against us."
For 32 minutes the Beavers (7-
5, 0-3) had their way with a Cardi
nal team that struggled to produce
offensively and turned the ball
over 20 times.
"We're getting out-physicalled
by everybody," Montgomery said.

"The thing is people look at us,
and we're Stanford, but we've got
sophomores [out there on the
court] and we've lost so many peo
ple. We just have to learn how
hard we have to play.
"We can't let missed shots affect
our effort. It's not going to come
over night. It's going to be a long,
painful process."
Stanford started out the first
half extremely shaky. The Cardi
nal committed five turnovers be
fore Lottich hit a long 3-pointer to
score Stanford's first basket of the
night.
The Beavers sucked the life out
of the Maples crowd early after
they went on a 7-0 run to open the
game.
It was an extremely long first
half for Stanford, which shot 39
percent from the field and only
managed to get to the charity
stripe once.
The combination of 45-percent
shooting from a hungry Oregon
State squad and 12 costly Stanford
turnovers made fora 10-point
deficit heading into the locker
room.
Moreover, the Beavers' first
half scoring came from an unex
pected source, 6-foot-l guard J.S.
Nash. Nash, who's averaging just
4.7 points per game — came off

Junior guard Matt Lottich drives past Oregon State's Lamar Hurd in Stanford's
57-54 come-from-behind win at Maples Pavilion last night. Lottich scored 18
of his career-high 23 points in the final 7:12 to lift the Cardinal to the win.
the bench and scored nine. The
Cardinal held the Oregon State
big-man scoring duo of Brian
Jackson and Philip Ricci to a mea
ger eight points and seven com
bined attempts from the field.
Nash finished the game with 13
points to lead the Beavers in scor
ing while Ricci fouled out with two
minutes left to play in the midst of
Stanford's inspired comeback. He
finished with 10 points and seven
boards.
"I thought our big guys defen
sively did a good job on Jackson
and Ricci," Montgomery said.
Due the knee injury of junior
starting forward Justin Davis,
Montgomery was forced to utilize a
host of combinations in the front
court, even opt ing at times to go big
with both 6-10 sophomore Rob Lit
tle and 6-9 junior Joe Kirchofer on
the lloor at the four and five spots.
Both freshman forward Matt
Haryasz and sophomore forward
Nick Robinson saw increased play
ing time as well due to Davis' injury.
To make matters worse for the
Cardinal, sophomore swingman
Josh Childress picked up his sec
ond foul with 11:28 left to play in
the first period and was forced to
sit out the remainder of the half.
For Stanford, the opening eight
minutes of the second half looked
similar to the first 20 minutes of
play.
Childress was whistled for his
fourth foul with nearly 16 minutes
left to play, but Montgomery, in
desperate need of an offensive
spark, gambled and left the 6-8
sophomore on the court.
Two minutes later, Childress
scored on a baseline slam to bring
the Cardinal within 11 points and
revived a quiet Sixth Man Club five
minutes away from leaving to get
an early start on their problem sets.
Those who did leave, however,
missed Stanford's 20-5 run to end

the game. Lottich at one point
scored eight points in a row.
With 26 seconds left on the
clock and the game tied, Little
knocked down two critical free
throws to extend the Cardinal's
lead to two points. He finished the
game with 12 points and 11 re
bounds for his first career double
double.
After a timeout, Oregon State
guard Jimmy Haywood had the
opportunity to tie it up. He
bricked a mid-range jumper, and
the Beavers were forced to foul
again to stop the clock.
Senior guard Julius Barnes hit
one of two free throws to extend
Stanford's lead to three, and Ore
gon State ended the game by miss
ing two 3-pointers.
"Coach Montgomery told me
after the game that we deserved to
win," Oregon State head coach Jay
John said. "But they found a way
to win — that's the difference."
"We needed [the win] badly,"
Montgomery said. "Hopefully we
can build from this."
Stanford will get that opportu
nity tomorrow against No. 12 Ore
gon. The Ducks arrive at Maples
after an 88-72 loss to California last
night in Berkeley.
