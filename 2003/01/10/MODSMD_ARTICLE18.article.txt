# Trotter's 17 lifts women to OSU win

### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — The Stanford
women's basketball team needed some
one to step up. It was locked in a dead
heat at Oregon State, leading by only two
with less than nine minutes to go in a
game that could have swung either way.
The Cardinal's 23-game Pacific-10 Con
ference winning streak was in jeopardy.
Enter spark-plug Chelsea Trotter,

Trotter, who has become the staunch
sixth (wo)man for the No. 6 Cardinal
(11-1,3-0 Pac-10), scored seven of her ca-

reer-high 17 points down the stretch as
Stanford scratched out a 62-51 win in
Corvallis.
The Beavers (7-7, 1-4) closed the gap
to two when junior forward Hollye
Chapman hit from inside with 8:48 re
maining. That's when Trotter went to
work.
First, as the shot clock was winding
down, and the OSU crowd was getting as
rowdy as it had been all night, Trotter si

lenced the building and the momentum
with an off-balance jumper from the top
of the key.
Then, she was the beneficiary of a
nifty left-handed, wrap-around pass by-
Susan King, which Trotter turned into a
three-point play.
Finally, Trotter gave the Cardinal
some breathing room with a nimble
lay-up after escaping some chaos in
the paint.
Seven straight Stanford points.
Game over.
Get the bus warmed up.
"She knows where the basket is,"
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said of
her 6-foot-3 center. "She's got so many
moves — she can go left, she can go
right, she can face up and hit free throws.
"This is someone who didn't play last
year and hasn't been practicing a lot, but
she comes off the bench and gives us a
huge boost."
Thanks to the redshirt sophomore's
efforts, Stanford extended its winning
streak to six games and continued its
dominance of the Beavers, winning its
fifth straight game against them.
Three other Cardinal players scored
in double figures, marking the seventh
time in 12 games at least four players
have scored in double digits. King, Seb
nem Kimyacioglu and Nicole Powell all
scored 10 points apiece.
And as it's been talked about all sea
son, Stanford's balance has been tough
to prepare for — and to combat in game
situations.
"You have to guard every person on
their team," Beavers guard Juleen Smith
said. "You can't sag off of anyone."
Statistically speaking, the discrepancy
from the free-throw line proved to be the
difference.
The Cardinal hit 18 of its 21 shots
from the charity stripe (including a 5-5
effort by Trotter), while Oregon State
only attempted three free throws all
night long, making one.
"The best thing for us was that we got
to the line," VanDerveer said. "We took
the ball to the basket well."
VanDerveer knew heading into last
night's match up that Oregon State
could defend. After all, the Beavers
lead the conference in scoring defense
(56.8 ppg).
But what she could not foresee was
that the Beavers' killer attitude — awak
ened by the challenge of hosting a top-10
opponent — would give it the energy to
shoot 46 percent from field and knock
down four 3-pointers. (Oregon State
came into the game shooting a woeful
37.4 percent from the field and a horrid
21.2 percent from beyond the arc, both
easily last in the Pac-10.)

the Year Felicia Ragland and her
19.9 points per game to gradua
tion, the Beavers have struggled
to find a go-to player offensively.
(They haven't forgotten about
Ragland, either. The Beavers will
honor her by retiring her number
34 before tomorrow's game
against Cal.)
Last night, the 6-2 Chapman
did her best Ragland impression.
She scored a season-high 22 points
and knocked down 10 of the 13
shots she took — giving Oregon
State the needed offensive lift it
hasn't had all season to accompany
its stingy defense.
B-arly on, Stanford wasn't its
usual dominant self. Oregon
State's trapping press bewildered
the Cardinal at times, resulting in
several discombobulated posses
sions and offensive fouls.
On one occasion, King found
herself trapped in the backcourt,
struggled to get free and eventual
ly lost the ball to Smith — who
made an easy lay-up and got the
crowd going.
"It was hard for us to bring up
the ball," Kimyacioglu said. "We
weren't in a flow or running our
transition game."
However, after Beaver guard

Leilani Estavan tied the game for
the last time with a three as the
shot clock ran down, the Cardinal
went on an 8-4 run to close the
half.
As if this wasn't enough of a
road test, the Cardinal will play at
the always-boisterous McArthur
Court in Eugene tomorrow night
at 7 p.m.
"We know Oregon will be ready
for us," VanDerveer said.
"They're a different team than last
year but they have an inside-out
side game.
"We have a target on our back
and we've got to be ready for it."
