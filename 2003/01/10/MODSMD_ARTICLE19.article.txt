# Lottich steps up on Maples' tough night

### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Until there were about seven
minutes remaining in the Stanford
men's basketball team's game
against Oregon State last night, one
couldn't help but think maybe
Maples had lost its magic.
As fans filtered to their seats be
fore the game, they were met by die
high-pitched echoing of the sound
system, which seemed like it just
couldn't adjust to the evening.
The arena's troubles continued
into the contest as the shot clock
kept spontaneously shutting off,
and several times the buzzer failed
to sound.
That mechanical failure said
nothing of the nearly constant dou

the conference-opener against Cali
fornia last week — the junior had
critics questioning whether he real
ly was deserving of a starting spot.
Last night's game left few
doubters, as Lottich established
himself as a confident player who
could be counted on in die clutch.
Getting hot just after a media
timeout with eight minutes remain
ing, Lottich hit his first shot of the
second half with the Cardinal down
49-35. Hitting back-to-back 3-point
ers and a pair of free-throws, he
pulled the Cardinal within six with
5:33 to go.
Two quick misses by Lottich and
senior Julius Barnes the next time
down the floor left people wonder
