# Lottich steps up on Maples' tough night
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Until there were about seven
minutes remaining in the Stanford
men's basketball team's game
against Oregon State last night, one
couldn't help but think maybe
Maples had lost its magic.
As fans filtered to their seats be
fore the game, they were met by die
high-pitched echoing of the sound
system, which seemed like it just
couldn't adjust to the evening.
The arena's troubles continued
into the contest as the shot clock
kept spontaneously shutting off,
and several times the buzzer failed
to sound.
That mechanical failure said
nothing of the nearly constant dou
ble-figure Oregon State lead that
left fans despondently resting in
their seats, and Sixth Man members
wondering if they would be better
off getting an early start on their
homework.
It took just a single man to re
store everyone's faith in Maples'
wizardry.
Widi 18 points in the final 7:15,
junior guard Matt Lottich got the
fans jumping, the floors bouncing
and even the alumni standing on
their feet.
But even more importandy, Lot
tich sent a strong, almost single
headed message to every team in

the Pacific-10 Conference: Even
when things don't look so good,
Maples is still Cardinal turf.
While the message was strong
and emphatic, the most important
person to receive the memo was
Lottich himself.
"Lottich really saved our bacon,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"There is no question about that."
Coming off a five-game scoring
drought in which Lottich failed to
see double figures — including a
scoreless 20-minute performance in
the conference-opener against Cali
fornia last week — the junior had
critics questioning whether he real
ly was deserving of a starting spot.
Last night's game left few
doubters, as Lottich established
himself as a confident player who
could be counted on in die clutch.
Getting hot just after a media
timeout with eight minutes remain
ing, Lottich hit his first shot of the
second half with the Cardinal down
49-35. Hitting back-to-back 3-point
ers and a pair of free-throws, he
pulled the Cardinal within six with
5:33 to go.
Two quick misses by Lottich and
senior Julius Barnes the next time
down the floor left people wonder
ing whether the magic was over. But
after two Cardinal offensive re
bounds, Lottich sunk another 3-
pointer to narrow the margin to
three to 51-48.
"It wasn't really until we got to
being three down that I though we
were really in the thing," Mont
gomery said.
With just over two minutes re
maining, Oregon State's leading
scorer Philip Ricci fouled out on a
what looked like a block on Lottich,
but the refs instead sent sophomore
center Rob Little to the line. Mont
gomery was furious, but Lottich em
phatically calmed his coach, nod
ding furiously as if to assure him
that the game would be secure.
Sure enough, just 23 seconds
later, Lottich hit another three to
cut the Cardinal deficit to one at 53-
52.
And with 1:22 left in the game,
he hit a pair of free throws that put
Stanford permanently ahead and
sealed his career-high 23-point, 15-
rebound performance.
"I just got hot. It happens so sel
dom in my career," Lottich said.
"We were playing so passively, with
out confidence or energy."
With just under 16 minutes re
maining in the second half, Lottich
pulled up on defense, grabbing his
calf and limping before taking the
bench, sending a nervous chill
through the Maples crowd. Every

one feared yet another Cardinal
could join the injured roster tliat al
ready includes junior forward
Justin Davis and sophomore guard
Chris Hernandez.
Maybe it was this realization of
near injury, or maybe only the sim
ple recognition that something
needed to be done and nobody else
seemed up to do it, but re
entered the game a different player.
"Matt is a guy I just wish would
hit his first shot," Montgomery said.
"But that goes fora lot of people."
Playing behind Casey Jacobsen
in his first two seasons on the Farm,
Lottich was notoriously known for
his cold feet. While Montgomery
and the rest of the Cardinal contin
ually spoke of the guard's sharp
shooting capabilities, the spotlight
seemed to get the better of Lottich
when he took the floor.
The injury to Hernandez during
the preseason moved Lottich into
the starting lineup this year.
But despite a 22-point perfor
mance in Stanford's season-open
ing win over Rice and a critical 13
points in die Cardinal's defeat over
then-No. 7 Florida on Nov. 27, it
wasn't until last night that he truly
made his debut.
"We needed it badly. Hopefully
we can build on that," Montgomery
said.
"I am glad the game ended when
it did," Montgomery added with a
chuckle. "Otherwise the lights
might have gone out."
