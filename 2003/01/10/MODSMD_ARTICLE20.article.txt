### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
For the Stanford wrestling team, last

"We didn't match up well with them,"
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie said.
"Their better guys were against some of our
younger guys. But, still, you have to be able
to adjust to that."
Redshirt sophomore Garrett Johnston
got Stanford (2-6) of! to an impressive start
with a hard-fought 6-4 decision over Penn
sophomore Richard Ferguson at 165
pounds.
And in the final bout of the night, Stan
ford redshirt sophomore Matt Gentry, who
went 3-0 at the Lone Star Duals last Saturday
and is ranked 17th in the nation, tallied a 6-
0 decision over Quaker senior Brett Van
derveer.
But those were the lone bright spots on a
dreary night inside and outside Burnham
Pavilion.
"Brad [Metzler] and I are captains, so it's
our job to step up and help the team
through, especially the young guys," Gentry
said. "We try to do well and lead by example,
but the hardest thing to work on is your
mental approach to wrestling, and that has

to come from them individually."
One of Stanford's younger wrestlers, red
shirt freshman Ryan Hagen, took on highly
touted Penn freshman Matt Herrington at
174. Herrington, ranked No. 20, scored a
quick takedown en route to a 6-2 early lead
and an eventual 15-5 major decision victory.
With Penn holding a 4-3 edge, inexperi
ence met experience at 184, where Stan
ford's Larry Ozowara, a redshirt freshman
making his first home appearance, squared
off against Penn senior Ethan Bullock.
Bullock's experience showed in the early
stages, as he jumped out to a 3-1 lead, but
Ozowara matched him maneuver for ma
neuver throughout the second period. With
50 seconds remaining in the bout, however,
Bullock tallied a pin to increase Penn's lead
to 10-3.
Lan Bork, another Cardinal freshman,
made his home debut in the next bout
against sophomore Paul Velekei. For the
second consecutive bout, Penn spoiled a
Stanford debut with a pin, this time at 5:57
with Velekei leading 9-3.

Shawn Ritzenthaler faced a tough foe in
Penn sophomore Matt Feast, an NCAA qual
ifier a year ago. Feast backed up his No. 12
ranking with the third and final pin of the
night at 3:16 to increase the Quaker lead to
21-3.
"Our young guys are making young mis
takes, but at the same time everyone's been
wrestling long enough to know to stay out of
certain situations," Buddie said. "There's
just no excuse for getting pinned three
matches in a row."

Gentry scored his 15th win or the season, but the Cardinal was crushed by the Quakers, 38-6.
Junior Nathan Peterson looked
to get Stanford back into the meet
at 125 against Penn's Matt Valenti,
but he could not hold on to a 2-1
lead in the final period as Valenti
rallied fora 5-2 decision.
With redshirt sophomore and
team leader Brad Metzler side

lined with a knee injury he suf

out a backup to replace him — at
133, Stanford was forced to forfeit
the next bout.
Redshirt junior Brendon Fox
then dropped a 12-3 decision to
Penn junior Doug McGraw at 141.
The bout at 149 featured a pair
of wrestlers off to strong starts this
season in Stanford redshirt sopho
more Scott Polley and Penn senior
Jody Guiricich. Guiricich, current

ly ranked No. 16 nationally, tallied
a 5-0 decision to bring the team
score to 38-3, before Gentry closed
out the scoring.
Tomorrow, Stanford travels to
UC-Davis for the Aggie Open, an

ors, respectively.
In addition to the many Califor
nia schools that will be competing
tomorrow, Penn, Air Force,
Princeton and Colorado will also
be represented.
"C)ur schedule has been very
tough for several weeks now,"
Buddie said. "There will be some
good teams there, but the Aggie
Open will be a confidence builder,
I think."

Pavilion.
"Brad [Metzler] and I are captains, so it's
our job to step up and help the team
through, especially the young guys," Gentry
said. "We try to do well and lead by example,
but the hardest thing to work on is your
mental approach to wrestling, and that has

to come from them individually."
One of Stanford's younger wrestlers, red
shirt freshman Ryan Hagen, took on highly
touted Penn freshman Matt Herrington at
174. Herrington, ranked No. 20, scored a
quick takedown en route to a 6-2 early lead
and an eventual 15-5 major decision victory.
With Penn holding a 4-3 edge, inexperi
ence met experience at 184, where Stan
ford's Larry Ozowara, a redshirt freshman
making his first home appearance, squared
off against Penn senior Ethan Bullock.
Bullock's experience showed in the early
stages, as he jumped out to a 3-1 lead, but
Ozowara matched him maneuver for ma
neuver throughout the second period. With
50 seconds remaining in the bout, however,
Bullock tallied a pin to increase Penn's lead
to 10-3.
Lan Bork, another Cardinal freshman,
made his home debut in the next bout
against sophomore Paul Velekei. For the
second consecutive bout, Penn spoiled a
Stanford debut with a pin, this time at 5:57
with Velekei leading 9-3.
Stanford heavyweight true freshman
Shawn Ritzenthaler faced a tough foe in
Penn sophomore Matt Feast, an NCAA qual
ifier a year ago. Feast backed up his No. 12
ranking with the third and final pin of the
night at 3:16 to increase the Quaker lead to
21-3.
"Our young guys are making young mis
takes, but at the same time everyone's been
wrestling long enough to know to stay out of
certain situations," Buddie said. "There's
just no excuse for getting pinned three
matches in a row."

Sophomore Matt Gentry grapples with Penn's Brett Vanderveer last night in Burnham Pavilion.
Gentry scored his 15th win or the season, but the Cardinal was crushed by the Quakers, 38-6.
Junior Nathan Peterson looked
to get Stanford back into the meet
at 125 against Penn's Matt Valenti,
but he could not hold on to a 2-1
lead in the final period as Valenti
rallied fora 5-2 decision.
With redshirt sophomore and
team leader Brad Metzler side

lined with a knee injury he suf
fered over the break — and with
out a backup to replace him — at
133, Stanford was forced to forfeit
the next bout.
Redshirt junior Brendon Fox
then dropped a 12-3 decision to
Penn junior Doug McGraw at 141.
The bout at 149 featured a pair
of wrestlers off to strong starts this
season in Stanford redshirt sopho
more Scott Polley and Penn senior
Jody Guiricich. Guiricich, current

ly ranked No. 16 nationally, tallied
a 5-0 decision to bring the team
score to 38-3, before Gentry closed
out the scoring.
Tomorrow, Stanford travels to
UC-Davis for the Aggie Open, an
all-day tournament in which red
shirts can compete.
Last year, Gentry earned sec
ond-place honors at 149 and Met
zler went 5-1 to take third place at
141. Redshirt freshmen Brennan
Corbett and Mark Egesdal took

home fourth- and sixth-place hon
ors, respectively.
In addition to the many Califor
nia schools that will be competing
tomorrow, Penn, Air Force,
Princeton and Colorado will also
be represented.
"C)ur schedule has been very
tough for several weeks now,"
Buddie said. "There will be some
good teams there, but the Aggie
Open will be a confidence builder,
I think."
