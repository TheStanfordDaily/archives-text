### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
For the Stanford wrestling team, last
night's home dual meet against Pennsylva
nia started and ended well.
But everything that happened in be
tween, including three straight Penn pins,
added up to a 38-6 loss, the Cardinal's fifth
straight.

"We didn't match up well with them,"
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie said.
"Their better guys were against some of our
younger guys. But, still, you have to be able
to adjust to that."
Redshirt sophomore Garrett Johnston
got Stanford (2-6) of! to an impressive start
with a hard-fought 6-4 decision over Penn
sophomore Richard Ferguson at 165
pounds.
And in the final bout of the night, Stan
ford redshirt sophomore Matt Gentry, who
went 3-0 at the Lone Star Duals last Saturday
and is ranked 17th in the nation, tallied a 6-
0 decision over Quaker senior Brett Van
derveer.
But those were the lone bright spots on a
dreary night inside and outside Burnham
Pavilion.
"Brad [Metzler] and I are captains, so it's
our job to step up and help the team
through, especially the young guys," Gentry
said. "We try to do well and lead by example,
but the hardest thing to work on is your
mental approach to wrestling, and that has

to come from them individually."
One of Stanford's younger wrestlers, red
shirt freshman Ryan Hagen, took on highly
touted Penn freshman Matt Herrington at
174. Herrington, ranked No. 20, scored a
quick takedown en route to a 6-2 early lead
and an eventual 15-5 major decision victory.
With Penn holding a 4-3 edge, inexperi
ence met experience at 184, where Stan
ford's Larry Ozowara, a redshirt freshman
making his first home appearance, squared
off against Penn senior Ethan Bullock.
Bullock's experience showed in the early
stages, as he jumped out to a 3-1 lead, but
Ozowara matched him maneuver for ma
neuver throughout the second period. With
50 seconds remaining in the bout, however,
Bullock tallied a pin to increase Penn's lead
to 10-3.
Lan Bork, another Cardinal freshman,
made his home debut in the next bout
against sophomore Paul Velekei. For the
second consecutive bout, Penn spoiled a
Stanford debut with a pin, this time at 5:57
with Velekei leading 9-3.

Shawn Ritzenthaler faced a tough foe in
Penn sophomore Matt Feast, an NCAA qual
ifier a year ago. Feast backed up his No. 12
ranking with the third and final pin of the
night at 3:16 to increase the Quaker lead to
21-3.
"Our young guys are making young mis
takes, but at the same time everyone's been
wrestling long enough to know to stay out of
certain situations," Buddie said. "There's
just no excuse for getting pinned three
matches in a row."
