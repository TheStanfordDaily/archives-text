Tuesday's season-opener against
UC-Santa Cruz really wasn't much
more than a warm up for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team.
It was all the warrnup the Cardi-

at UCSB / Elephant Bar Invite, Today-
Saturday

nal is going to get this season.
Stanford (1-0) already embarks
on its first serious challenge of the
season tonight at the UCSB / Ele
phant Bar Invitational in Santa
Barbara.
Eight teams from the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation, which
perennially dominates NCAA
men's volleyball, will gather at
UCSB, with most teams seeing their
first stiff action of the year.
Stanford, the No. 2 seed in die
tournament, will take on seventh
seeded UC-Irvine in tonight's first
round at 7:00 p.m.
Win or lose, the Cardinal will
have two matches tomorrow, play
ing in the semifinals of either the
winners or losers bracket at 10:00
a.m. and hitting the courts again in
a place match in the afternoon or
evening.
The Anteaters (2-0) got their
season off on the right foot earli
er this week, picking up wins over
La Verne and Pepperdine to win
the Waves' Millie & Severson
Tournament.

Outside hitter Monte Tucker
led Irvine with 21 kills between
the two sweeps, followed closely
by outside hitter Jimmy Pelzel,
who had 20. Tucker and Pelzel
are picking up the offensive slack
left by the graduation of middle
blocker Erick Helenihi, the
Anteaters' top attacker the last
two seasons.
Irvine again looks to be one of
the stronger serving teams in the
country. The Anteaters, second in
the MPSF in aces last year, served
up 16 in their first two matches.
Irvine also put up a strong block
in those contests, something it will
have to do against a Stanford attack
that hit .494 with 50 kills in the Car
dinal's three-game sweep over the
Banana Slugs on Tuesday. Eight
Cardinal players hit over .500 in the
match.
Ail-American outside hitter Curt
Toppel will lead the Cardinal arse
nal against Irvine. Toppel, Stan
lord's kill leader tire last three sea
sons, had nine kills against UCSC to
start his senior campaign.
But it was sophomore middle
blocker Chris Sandman who did the
most damage to die Banana Slugs,
recording 11 kills with no errors at a
.786 clip.
Sophomore setter Kevin
Hansen is in his second year of
running the Cardinal offense,
which topped the MPSF last sea
son with 16.65 kills per game.
The Cardinal will take on either
third-seeded Pacific (1-0) or the
sixth-seeded host UCSB in its first

match on Saturday.
Stanford split a pair of matches
with Pacific in October at the
Husky Dino Cup in Calgary. After
falling to the Tigers in pool play,
the Cardinal defeated Pacific in
five games in the championship
match of the tournament.
The Tigers also defeated UCSC
in their season-opener on

Wednesday.
UCSB, which finished ranked
No. 5 last year, will be playing its first
match of the year tonight.
UCLA is the top seed for the
tournament. Fourth-seeded Long
Beach State, fifth-seeded Cal
State-Northridge and eighth
seeded Southern California
round out the field.
