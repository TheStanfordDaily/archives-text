### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Don't tell Ore
gon coach Ernie Kent that the Pac-10 is a two
team conference.
After the No. 12 Ducks lost 88-72 to Califor
nia, Kent was ready to include the Golden
Bears right up there with his team and Arizona.
"Everybody has said it's a two-team conference
race, and it's not," Kent said. "They're a player."
Amit Tamir scored 25 points and Joe Shipp
added 22 points and eight rebounds to lead Cal

to its third straight victory last night.
Brian Wethers added 16 points for the Gold
en Bears (9-2, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference), who
won at home for the 12th straight time.
Luke Jackson had 17 points, eight assists and
five rebounds for Oregon. The Pac-10's top
scoring team had only 38 points with 15 min
utes left in the game.
But the Ducks never got in sync against the
aggressive and up-tempo Bears, who seeming

ly couldn't miss when it mattered most.
"They did a great job defensively knocking
us out of sync for this game," Kent said. "We
never had an opportunity to gain momentum."
Cal built on its 10-point halftime lead with an
impressive start to the second half. The Bears
started the half with an 8-3 run and had an an
swer whenever the Ducks made a threat.
The Ducks will try to right themselves to
morrow at Stanford.
