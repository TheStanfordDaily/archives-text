vs. Pacific, Saturday, 10:00 a.m

Noting that the Hawaii practices marked
the end of the team's most intense training,
sophomore Lacey Boutwell said that the trip
did a lot to prepare the team for the upcom
ing meets.
"The idea is to go to a great atmosphere,"
Boutwell said. "By doing that, you have a
much better attitude, and you're just going
to train harder."
Which is exactly what happened. The
coaching staff was very pleased with the
progress the team made in practice races at
the high school in Hawaii where they
trained. With Stanford having secured the
full use of a 50-meter pool and a weight
room, the swimmers' schedule was grueling.
"They really worked their guts out,"
coach Richard Quick said. "Practices went
very well for us."
To test the skills of the Cardinal, Quick

had the team face off'in a mock meet against
the Wisconsin swim squad, which was also
there for training. Though the teams did not
officially keep score, Quick said that the
Stanford team performed "extremely well."
Now that the Cardinal is back at home, it
has one last competition before the Pac-10
season: tomorrow's meet against Pacific at
10:00 a.m. at the Avery Aquatic Center.
This will be the second time this season that
Stanford and Pacific meet in competition;
their meeting in November ended in a massive
201-121 victory for the Cardinal women.
The meet will give the Stanford squad a
chance to assess its weaker strokes, including
the persistently problematic distance
freestyle races.
Quick said that all of his swimmers will
swim the event that they are best in, and one
or two others to which they aren't as accus
tomed. These "off-stroke" races will comple
ment each swimmer's best event and is, in a
sense, part of their training.
Boutwell is very confident in the team's
ability to tackle off-stroke racing.
"We've had a lot of people step up where
they need to," Boutwell said. "We have a lot
of girls who can just swim everything."
The Pacific meet is expected to be a defi
nite Stanford victory.
"Pacific has a very good team," Quick
said. "They have a couple All-Aniericans.
But they just don't really have the talent to
beat our team."
