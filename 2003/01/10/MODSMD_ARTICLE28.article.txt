Winter break: a time when most stu
dents spend their days sleeping and re
laxing, free from the worries of their
busy lives at Stanford.

vs. No. 1 Michigan, Today, 1:00 p.m.
vs. Cal State-Bakersfield and Pacific, Saturday,
1:00 p.m.

For the No. 3 Cardinal men's swim
ming and diving team (1-0), though, this
period of relative tranquility lasted just a
brief time, as the squad went to the pool
on Dec. 27 to prepare for the upcoming
dual-meet season.
The swimmers practiced twice a day
until the start of winter classes, painful
ly executing the highest yardage of the
season. Assistant coach Tec! Knapp
thinks that the men completed what he
calls "the best Christmas training season
ever."
"All the guys stayed healthy during
the training," Knapp said. "They had 10
great, undistracted days of practice . . .
They took care of themselves, ate well
and got a lot of sleep."
The holiday training was the team's
last big push to get in high yardage be
fore the kickoff of its busy dual-meet sea
son, which necessitates shorter practices.
That season begins today at Avery
Aquatic Center. The Cardinal faces
Michigan, the top-ranked team in
dual-meet standings this season, at
1:00 p.m.
An early-season win over then-No. 1
Texas has propelled the Wolverines (4-0)
to the top spot of the national rankings.
"Michigan beat Texas, and Texas
barely beat us last year at the NCAA
Championship," junior Nick Bott said.
"This is our first meet this year against a
top-ranked school. We haven't had too
many opportunities so far to get up and
race against a fast team, so it should be a

good meet."
In addition to its win over Texas,
Michigan also powered past No. 6 Flori
da in November.
But, while Michigan has proved it
self a strong competitor in the dual
meet scene, Knapp feels that the
Wolverines have yet to establish them
selves as a major threat in champi
onship competition.
"Michigan has a good chance of being
one of the top four or five teams at the
NCAA meet in March, but I don't think
that they can win at that level," Knapp
said. "This dual meet, though, will give
us a good opportunity to showcase our
guys. All of the other top teams had big
meets in December, but we did not
schedule one. This is our team's big
chance to really s;ep it up and compete."
According to Knapp, the Cardinal
looks strong in the 200-yard backstroke,
butterfly, breaststroke and individual
medley events. In addition, the relays
shoulcl give Stanford an advantage over
the Wolverines.
"We would like to see our guys go 1-2
in the 400 medley relay. I think that we
can accomplish this without using all of
our best athletes," Knapp said.

Michigan brings a strong freestyle
core, especially in the 200-, 500- and
1,000-yard events.
Given the strength of each squad's
swimmers, the diving portion of the
competition should be pivotal.
The Cardinal diving team feels pre
pared, though, as it too returned to the
pool early to train. T he trio of divers, se
nior Gavin Olmstead and sophomores
Adam Peterson and Jeff Durbin, com
pleted two practices a day in addition to
their normal weight training routine.
"We are feeling good and really look
ing forward to diving well this weekend,"
Peterson said.
This afternoon's meet will be the first
opportunity of the season for the swim
mers and divers to compete together.
The swimmers swam early-season meets
against California and San Francisco
State without the divers, while the divers
attended the Trojan Invite in Los Ange
les by themselves.
In addition to today's meet against
Michigan, the team will also face off
against Cal State-Bakersfield and Pacific
tomorrow at Avery in what figures to be
a less heated match than this afternoon's.
Tomorrow's race begins at 1:00 p.m.
