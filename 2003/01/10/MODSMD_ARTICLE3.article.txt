# Trail debate rages as GUP issues loom
## 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the controversy that accompanied
a decision over the alignment of one
recreational trail on the Stanford cam
pus is any indication, the path toward
full compliance with the General Use
Permit promises to be fraught with con
tention.
On Dec. 17, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors removed from
consideration two proposed trail routes
from a list of five possibilities fora trail
called SI on the west side of campus,
eliciting outcry from the environmen
tal groups that had pushed for them.
As mitigation for future develop
ment on campus lands, Stanford
pledged in December 2000 to build two
recreational trails according to its GUP
and expansion plan. The development
of CI, the other trail, has been post
poned because of the Sand Hill Road
expansion.
"This issue is more than just about
trails," said Peter Drekmeier, a mem
ber of the Stanford Open Space Al
liance. "It is about compliance and the
spirit of the General Use Permit and
the community plan."
Drekmeier is worried. This was one
of the first significant skirmishes be
tween Stanford and opposition groups
over GUP implementation, and the fact
that the county was "willing to buckle at
the first threat of a lawsuit by Stanford"
doesn't leave much hope for foothills
protection, Drekmeier said, referring
to the two trails removed from the list.

"Unless the county is willing to stand
up to Stanford, we're screwed," Drek
meier said.
Stanford spokesman Larry Horton
said that Drekmeier's claims have no
substance and that Stanford remains
fully committed to what the University
agreed to in the GUP. Horton said that
the two removed trails, Sib and Sle,
which cut through the interior of cam
pus lands in places, were never on the
table to begin with.
"We did not threaten a lawsuit,"
Horton said. "We did say that we were
not going to pay for the environmental
study [of the trails], because it included
routes that couldn't be legally required
because they were not the routes we

had agreed to."
He said that Stanford made it very
clear why it would not accept routes
that went inside or across campus. Be
cause the routes are permanent, Stan
ford would essentially be giving the
land away forever, which would con
strain the use of Stanford's land in the
future. Horton also said there were en
vironmental issues and problems with
unauthorized access.
"We made a solemn commitment
and we are going to meet that," he said.
"But people are trying to change the
plan."
Horton said that the University is
supporting the county to make a satis
factory route and link to the

Arastradero preserve through the "cow
tunnel," owned by Caltrans, a state
agency. He said Stanford has an excel
lent environmental record and wants to
compromise with the county to make
the best route possible without restrict
ing Stanford's future development.
"We don't know what the next cen
tury of Stanford will need," Horton
said.

In mid-December, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors decided to eliminate two proposed trail routes from a list of five trail
options. The decision sparked a significant conflict between Stanford and opposing environmental groups. Above, the foothills can
be seen from Junipero Serra Blvd. near the intersection of Stanford Ave., close to the location of one of the removed trails.
