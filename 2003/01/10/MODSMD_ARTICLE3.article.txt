# Trail debate rages as GUP issues loom
## 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the controversy that accompanied
a decision over the alignment of one
recreational trail on the Stanford cam
pus is any indication, the path toward
full compliance with the General Use
Permit promises to be fraught with con
tention.
On Dec. 17, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors removed from
consideration two proposed trail routes
from a list of five possibilities fora trail
called SI on the west side of campus,
eliciting outcry from the environmen
tal groups that had pushed for them.
As mitigation for future develop
ment on campus lands, Stanford
pledged in December 2000 to build two
recreational trails according to its GUP
and expansion plan. The development
of CI, the other trail, has been post
poned because of the Sand Hill Road
expansion.
"This issue is more than just about
trails," said Peter Drekmeier, a mem
ber of the Stanford Open Space Al
liance. "It is about compliance and the
spirit of the General Use Permit and
the community plan."
Drekmeier is worried. This was one
of the first significant skirmishes be
tween Stanford and opposition groups
over GUP implementation, and the fact
that the county was "willing to buckle at
the first threat of a lawsuit by Stanford"
doesn't leave much hope for foothills
protection, Drekmeier said, referring
to the two trails removed from the list.

"Unless the county is willing to stand
up to Stanford, we're screwed," Drek
meier said.
Stanford spokesman Larry Horton
said that Drekmeier's claims have no
substance and that Stanford remains
fully committed to what the University
agreed to in the GUP. Horton said that
the two removed trails, Sib and Sle,
which cut through the interior of cam
pus lands in places, were never on the
table to begin with.
"We did not threaten a lawsuit,"
Horton said. "We did say that we were
not going to pay for the environmental
study [of the trails], because it included
routes that couldn't be legally required
because they were not the routes we

had agreed to."
He said that Stanford made it very
clear why it would not accept routes
that went inside or across campus. Be
cause the routes are permanent, Stan
ford would essentially be giving the
land away forever, which would con
strain the use of Stanford's land in the
future. Horton also said there were en
vironmental issues and problems with
unauthorized access.
"We made a solemn commitment
and we are going to meet that," he said.
"But people are trying to change the
plan."
Horton said that the University is
supporting the county to make a satis
factory route and link to the

Arastradero preserve through the "cow
tunnel," owned by Caltrans, a state
agency. He said Stanford has an excel
lent environmental record and wants to
compromise with the county to make
the best route possible without restrict
ing Stanford's future development.
"We don't know what the next cen
tury of Stanford will need," Horton
said.

In mid-December, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors decided to eliminate two proposed trail routes from a list of five trail
options. The decision sparked a significant conflict between Stanford and opposing environmental groups. Above, the foothills can

been evaluating a wide range of
possible alternative routes. The
board's action to remove two of
the trail options in December was
a result of a recommendation
from the county counsel, accord
ing to Kniss.
"It was a tough decision," Kniss
said. "But I felt that a lawsuit at
this time of such critically limited
resources would not be fiscally
prudent."
Now there are three possible
routes left on the table: SI a, Sic
and Sid. Drekmeier said that his
group and other supporters were
surprised that Sle was taken off
the list. They thought that Sle was
the least controversial and would
hold up in court because it didn't
go far into Stanford land.
"I think the county made a mis
take," said Jeff Segall, a member of
the Stanford Open Space Alliance
and the Committee for Green
Foothills. "I'm very disappointed.
I think it was partly miscommuni
cation and partly the implication
of a lawsuit [that resulted in the de
cision]," Segall said.
Segall said that the goal is to

have a fun, recreational trail that is
an asset to the community. He ar
gued that the trail option most
likely to be approved, Sid, has the
most problems because it crosses
under the Caltrans tunnel. If Cal
trans enters the debate, it will most
likely cause further delay in com
pleting the trail.
The GUP came about in 2000
when Stanford proposed to devel
op 5 million square feet of proper
ty, or as Drekmeier puts it, the
equivalent of three Stanford Shop
ping Centers.
"We didn't oppose that, but
Stanford needed to give some
thing back," he said. "Protect the
foothills."
Drekmeier said that, during the
2000 negotiations, Stanford
agreed to a proposal presented by
then-County Supervisor Joe
Simitian for an academic growth
boundary and other mitigations
like a special habitat conservation
plan, the trails, a sustainable devel
opment study and others. Drek
meier's concern is that, as each of
these battles come up, his group is
back to square one.
The C 1 trail will be equally con
troversial because Stanford's
lawyers are making all of the deci
sions, Drekmeier said.
Jim Sweeney, president of the

Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders Association, said
that the majority of Stanford
homeowners are happy with the
decision.
"First, I think it was a sense of
what is good for Stanford in the
long run and second, partly a
sense of loyalty to Stanford,"
Sweeney said.
He said that most homeowners
feel that trails that go inside Stan
ford land would tie the Universi
ty's hands because the trails would
be permanent. He also said that
they favored the decision for per
sonal reasons â€” they dislike the
parking, people, noise, garbage

and dangerous U-turns that al
ready occur at the end of Stanford
Avenue.
"We didn't want anything to in
crease the use of that as a parking
lot," Sweeney said.
According to Sweeney, home
owners sent 50 to 60 letters to the
county supervisors last year ex
pressing their concerns over
building trails that would cut into
campus land.
"The real reason is that they
want to protect their development
interests," Drekmeier contended.
"I've heard every single excuse
from Stanford, and they're all red
herring."

Now there are three possible
routes left on the table: SI a, Sic
and Sid. Drekmeier said that his
group and other supporters were
surprised that Sle was taken off
the list. They thought that Sle was
the least controversial and would
hold up in court because it didn't
go far into Stanford land.
"I think the county made a mis
take," said Jeff Segall, a member of
the Stanford Open Space Alliance
and the Committee for Green
Foothills. "I'm very disappointed.
I think it was partly miscommuni
cation and partly the implication
of a lawsuit [that resulted in the de
cision]," Segall said.
Segall said that the goal is to

have a fun, recreational trail that is
an asset to the community. He ar
gued that the trail option most
likely to be approved, Sid, has the
most problems because it crosses
under the Caltrans tunnel. If Cal
trans enters the debate, it will most
likely cause further delay in com
pleting the trail.
The GUP came about in 2000
when Stanford proposed to devel
op 5 million square feet of proper
ty, or as Drekmeier puts it, the
equivalent of three Stanford Shop
ping Centers.
"We didn't oppose that, but
Stanford needed to give some
thing back," he said. "Protect the
foothills."
Drekmeier said that, during the
2000 negotiations, Stanford
agreed to a proposal presented by
then-County Supervisor Joe
Simitian for an academic growth
boundary and other mitigations
like a special habitat conservation
plan, the trails, a sustainable devel
opment study and others. Drek
meier's concern is that, as each of
these battles come up, his group is
back to square one.
The C 1 trail will be equally con
troversial because Stanford's
lawyers are making all of the deci
sions, Drekmeier said.
Jim Sweeney, president of the

Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders Association, said
that the majority of Stanford
homeowners are happy with the
decision.
"First, I think it was a sense of
what is good for Stanford in the
long run and second, partly a
sense of loyalty to Stanford,"
Sweeney said.
He said that most homeowners
feel that trails that go inside Stan
ford land would tie the Universi
ty's hands because the trails would
be permanent. He also said that
they favored the decision for per
sonal reasons â€” they dislike the
parking, people, noise, garbage

and dangerous U-turns that al
ready occur at the end of Stanford
Avenue.
"We didn't want anything to in
crease the use of that as a parking
lot," Sweeney said.
According to Sweeney, home
owners sent 50 to 60 letters to the
county supervisors last year ex
pressing their concerns over
building trails that would cut into
campus land.
"The real reason is that they
want to protect their development
interests," Drekmeier contended.
"I've heard every single excuse
from Stanford, and they're all red
herring."
If the controversy that accompanied
a decision over the alignment of one
recreational trail on the Stanford cam
pus is any indication, the path toward
full compliance with the General Use
Permit promises to be fraught with con
tention.
On Dec. 17, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors removed from
consideration two proposed trail routes
from a list of five possibilities fora trail
called SI on the west side of campus,
eliciting outcry from the environmen
tal groups that had pushed for them.
As mitigation for future develop
ment on campus lands, Stanford
pledged in December 2000 to build two
recreational trails according to its GUP
and expansion plan. The development
of CI, the other trail, has been post
poned because of the Sand Hill Road
expansion.
"This issue is more than just about
trails," said Peter Drekmeier, a mem
ber of the Stanford Open Space Al
liance. "It is about compliance and the
spirit of the General Use Permit and
the community plan."
Drekmeier is worried. This was one
of the first significant skirmishes be
tween Stanford and opposition groups
over GUP implementation, and the fact
that the county was "willing to buckle at
the first threat of a lawsuit by Stanford"
doesn't leave much hope for foothills
protection, Drekmeier said, referring
to the two trails removed from the list.

"Unless the county is willing to stand
up to Stanford, we're screwed," Drek
meier said.
Stanford spokesman Larry Horton
said that Drekmeier's claims have no
substance and that Stanford remains
fully committed to what the University
agreed to in the GUP. Horton said that
the two removed trails, Sib and Sle,
which cut through the interior of cam
pus lands in places, were never on the
table to begin with.
"We did not threaten a lawsuit,"
Horton said. "We did say that we were
not going to pay for the environmental
study [of the trails], because it included
routes that couldn't be legally required
because they were not the routes we

had agreed to."
He said that Stanford made it very
clear why it would not accept routes
that went inside or across campus. Be
cause the routes are permanent, Stan
ford would essentially be giving the
land away forever, which would con
strain the use of Stanford's land in the
future. Horton also said there were en
vironmental issues and problems with
unauthorized access.
"We made a solemn commitment
and we are going to meet that," he said.
"But people are trying to change the
plan."
Horton said that the University is
supporting the county to make a satis
factory route and link to the

Arastradero preserve through the "cow
tunnel," owned by Caltrans, a state
agency. He said Stanford has an excel
lent environmental record and wants to
compromise with the county to make
the best route possible without restrict
ing Stanford's future development.
"We don't know what the next cen
tury of Stanford will need," Horton
said.
