# Spielberg restrains himself, delivers fun movie
## 
### PHIL FLORES 
"Catch Me If You Can" appears to be a simple movie.
A vigilant FBI agent chases a white-collar criminal
across America. The agent, always on the verge of catch-

ing the criminal, is foiled time and time again.

You would think that a film like this would r
be boring, but director Steven Spielberg \
and his two stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and
Tom Hanks, reinvigorate the "cat-and
mouse suspense" genre and produce a fun,

crowd-pleasing film.
Set in the early 19605, the film recounts
the infamous exploits of young con artist
Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) who over the
course of several years cashed phony checks

worth millions of dollars. By assuming numerous iden
tities, Abangale was able to pose as a Pan-Am airline
pilot, doctor and lawyer. Hot on Abagnale's heels is FBI
agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), a composite character
based on several real-life agents.
Both DiCaprio and Hanks are excellent in this
movie. Shedding some weight after filming Martin
Scorsese's epic "Gangs of New York," DiCaprio epito
mizes the boyish charm of Abangale and effectively con
veys the heavy burden of living one lie after another. Al
though the role is immensely unglamorous, Hanks
seemingly delights in Hanratty's simplicity, portraying
him as an extremely lonely and uncharismatic man who
derives pleasure from catching crooks and cheats.
For much of the film, Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff
Nathanson ("Rush Hour 2") focus on the similarities be

tween Abagnale and Hanratty, both solitary figures that
thrive on the "chase." What results is a finely paced plot
that resembles diat of the fun caper movies of the '50s and
'60s. The filmmakers understand the sheer absurdity of

Abagnale's exploits and correctly concen
{ trate on how cool it is to swindle stuffy bank
presidents and inept medical residents.
Where the film doesn't succeed is

pinpointing the reasons behind Aban
gale's decisions to commit all these
crimes. Both Nathanson and Spielberg
suggest that Abagnale's broken family
motivated him to steal millions of dollars.
Although the film establishes Abagnale's
relationship with his father, played per
fectly by Christopher Walken, the moti-

vation seems heavy-handed and forced. During these
moments the lilm unfortunately slows down, convinc
ing itself that spending more time on this character
point will persuade the audience. It doesn't work.
Despite this, "Catch Me If You Can" is quite well done.
Working with longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamin
ski and production designer Jeannine Ope wall, Spiel
l)erg captures the bright look and carefree tone of pre-
Vietnam America. With this movie, Spielberg successful
ly returns to his pre-"Schindler's List" days of pure pop
corn entertainment, a move perhaps foreshadowed by
his dark, yet more mainstream hit "Minority Report."
