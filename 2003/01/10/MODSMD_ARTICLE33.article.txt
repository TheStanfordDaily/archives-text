# Scorsese's 'Gangs': magnum opus of crap & violence
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
In Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New
York," one character asks another if he's
familiar with Shakespeare, and we realize
here that this is an attempt from the direc-

tor who made "Taxi Dri
ver" and "Raging Bull"
to create his magnum

opus — his "Hamlet."
The history of

the film is certainly epic.
"Gangs of New York"
was stuck, in either pre
production or postpro
duction, for 25 years.
First, because Scorsese
needed time for the pro-

ject to hard boil while he filmed other pic
tures. When the wheel finally started
rolling, the movie was slated fora Christ
mas release. That was two Christmases
ago.
It subsequently moved to spring 2002,
then the summer (on the same weekend as
"Road to Perdition") and later, on Christ
mas Day with "Catch Me With You Can"
before it found a free weekend after the
"Lord of the Rings" sequel.
Enough already! The movie has been
released. I'd like to tell you that it's riveting
— a work of genius from one of the great
est American directors alive. But it's not.
It's a fucking train wreck.
"Gangs of New York" is set before the
Civil War, in the streets of New York — a
world run by bare-knuckled gangsters
with axes and knives. In the opening se
quence, an army of Irish-Americans are
led to war by their leader, Priest Vallon
(Liarn Neeson), against the American
born group headed by Bill the Butcher

(Daniel Day Lewis).
Blood gushes. Carcasses flop to the
ground. And when smoke from the toma
hawks clear, we see Bill kill Vallon in front
of his son, Amsterdam. The young boy is
sent to an orphanage. Time passes. And
later, Amsterdam (played by Leonardo Di-
Caprio as an adult) returns — not unlike
Hamlet — to avenge his father's death.
The seeds of great drama could have
been planted in the screenplay by Jay
Cocks and Steven Zaillian (with rewrites
from Kenneth Lonergan), but Scorsese
fumbles with the material like an old foot
ball player. Or maybe Miramax executive
Harvey Weinstein should share his ele
phant's weight of the blame: Numerous

reports from the set indicated that he or
dered a trimmed-down version of the
original cut.
Scorsese says that the version in the
aters is his cut. But that's a cut from an
other cut — and somewhere, between all
this snipping and clipping, I'm willing to
bet my movie critic medallion that the
film's original intentions were left on the
studio floor.
The first "hour" — that is, 90 minutes
— of the film are fine, as the plot builds
and characters develop around the edges.
Bill the Butcher, played by Day Lewis, is
vicious and uncompromising. He's a man
who could gut a boy or a chicken with
equal dexterity, and, like modern-day

mob bosses, surrounds himself with pow
erful henchmen, including Boss Tweed
(Jim Broadbent) and Happy Jack (John C.
Reilly).
DiCaprio, cast as the outcast, plays
against stereotype and doesn't always
carry the dramatic burden of the role.
He's also off-centered in a romance with
the town pickpocket, Jenny Everdeane
(Cameron Diaz). They partially disrobe
and make love, in a scene that's as hot as
winter in Manhattan, and she reveals her
scars from an abortion. It's intended to
demonstrate that in their world, wounds
go deep.
The wounds of the movie also go deep,
to the point where they can't be remedied.
The second half of "Gangs of New
York" is all about revenge and "Rocky" (as
in the Sylvester Stallone movie) and it's all
too rocky. After a premature fight, Ams
terdam is nursed back to health fora re
match. Cinematic tension isn't main
tained. The final scene is sloppy and chop
py, and the end, without surprise.
These shortcomings we could under
stand from a new director, or even and old
one like Roman Polanski, but not Scors
ese, who has handled spatial depths before
in movies like "The Age of Innocence."
His "Gangs of New York" may have read
like a great masterpiece in his mind, but
on the screen, it plays like the worst mag
num opus a great director ever made.
