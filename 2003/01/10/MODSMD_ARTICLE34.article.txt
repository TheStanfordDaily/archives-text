## 2002 THE BEST IN ENTERTAINMENT 
### ANTHONY HA CHRIS LEE HART GILULA JENNIE KIM TOP 5 FASHION TRENDS 
1. Punch-Drunk Love
P.T. Anderson's delirious follow-up to "Magnolia" is the
strangest and most moving romantic comedy I've seen in a long
time. Anderson helps Adam Sandler reveal both the vulnera
bility and genuine rage hidden beneath his past performances,
and the carefully constructed film manages to find true love
and radiant hope amidst the grimness of modern suburbia.
2. Y tu mama tambien
A teen sex comedy, a coming of age story and a meditation on
life and deatii all packed into cinematic tour of a changing Mex
ico. Alfonso Cuaron's film is thought provoking, funny and
above all vibrantly alive.
3. Spirited Away
It may not pack the emotional punch of Japanese master an
imator Hayao Miyazaki's previous masterpiece "Princess
Mononoke," but this girl's journey through the realm of gods
and spirits bursts at the seams with unforgettable visual won
ders, including a gigantic baby, bouncing heads and a dream
like train ride across the sea.
4. Bowling for Columbine
In the end, provocateur documentarian Michael Moore
bites off more than he can chew in his examination of violence
in America. But although he fails to pull together all his dis
parate ideas, along the way he raises important questions, pro
vides a few answers and strikes some satisfying points against
The Man.
5. All or Nothing
Small moments of touching and surprising humanity make
this more than just an above-average melodrama about the dif
ficulties of working-class life in London. The climactic scene be
tween the couple played by Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville
is a dazzling, tear-drenched revelation, in which two decades of
resentment and regret come pouring out.
BY RAMIN SETOODEH
1. My Big Fat Greek Wedding
Occasionally, this critic and the crowds agree. Out of the
64 films I viewed last year, none spoke to me louder — or
with more chutzpah — than this independent-turned
mainstream romantic comedy that not only redefined the
chick flick, but gave us Nia Vardalos, the most promising
chick newcomer since Renee Zellweger in "Jerry Maguire."
2. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing
Less is more in director Jill Sprecher's understated drama
about faulty coincidences, the quest for happiness and, well,
the meaning of life.
3. Insomnia
Chrisopher Nolan's second film is even more accom
plished than his first. A1 Pacino stars as a detective sent to
Alaska to solve a grizzly murder. Sounds familiar? Not here.
Hillary Swank and Robin Williams add dramatic weight to
the thriller.
4. The Quiet American
Michael Caine gives the best performance of his career as
a conflicted foreign correspondent at the time of the Viet
nam War. Brendan Fraser co-stars as the title character, a
man who is quiet not by nature, as we first assume, but be
cause he has something to hide.
5. Road to Perdition
The best gangster movie of the year wasn't directed by
Martin Scorsese. Instead, it was this summer release —
beautifully shot and directed — from Sam Mendes that may
get snubbed by the Oscars only because it was released five
months too early.

1. Road to Perdition
Those who thumbed their noses at Sam Mendes'
sophomore effort missed this compelling tale of fa
thers and sons featuring nuanced performances by
Paul Newman and Tom Hanks and the last gorgeous
images from late cinematographer Conrad Hall.
2. Far From Heaven
This return to '50s nostalgia is striking for two rea
sons: die meticulous attention to detail afforded to
Todd Haynes' production, and the chutzpah with
which Haynes subjugates our pristine picture of the
past to deal with issues never directly addressed in
that society. Julianne Moore's performance as a per
fect TV housewife cements her reputation as an ac
tress, and Dennis Quaid manages to surprise as well.
3. About a Boy
The feel-good flick of the year was another in a re
cent string of British / Hollywood productions, again

1. Ataranjuat (The Fast Runner)
The first Inuit-language film (and not a docu
mentary) runs a captivating three hours long. Com
posed mainly of white tundra shots, the film is gor
geous to look at, something which cannot be said of
most films shot on digital video.
2. Tuvalu
This beautiful film was shot in black and white
with each scene tinted a different color. There's no
dialogue, which reinforces the film's ineffable sense
of whimsy.
3. Ma femme est une actrice (My Wife is an Ac
tress)
The year's best romantic comedy didn't star Julia
Roberts or John Cusack! (As if they ever do.)
4. The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys
Despite the unintentionally suggestive title, this
film is actually a truthful portrayal of adolescents.
Kieran Culkin gives an admirable performance as
one of the disaffected youth. Check out Jodie Foster
as a peg-legged nun!
5. Otesanek (Little Otik)
Jan Svankmajer's latest brilliant creation: Sterile
parents hope for child. Mother gives splintery birth
to bloodthirsty wooden log. (Ouch!) See the movie
now, ask questions later.

1) Dressed-up sweats
Remember how George Costanza said
he'd drape himself head-to-toe in velvet if it
were socially acceptable? Now it is! Well,
velour is anyway, which is close enough. So
drape away!
2) Preppy menswear
Anything that compels a guy to wear ar
gyle (socks don't count) is fine with me: I
heart dorks 4-ever. Mmm„.sweater vests...
3) Nike Air Force Ones
I said give me two pair! Nelly likes "the all
white high top strap with the gum bottom."
I prefer mine accented in pink rhinestones,

starring a revamped Hugh Grant and backed by Nick
Hornby's genius source material. The unsung he
roes: the Weitz brothers' unobtrusive direction and a
wonderfully evocative soundtrack by Badly Drawn
Boy.
4. Catch Me if You Can
Slick direction and a trio of performances from ac
tors at the top of their game (Leonardo DiCaprio,
Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken) make fora
movie that's just sheer fun to watch, proving that
Spielberg is at his best when he isn't cramming mes
sages down your throat.
5. Punch-Drunk Love
Auteur Paul Thomas Anderson comes back in rare
form, wisely deciding to eschew the sprawling mess of
"Magnolia" in favor of a smaller, heart-felt paean to
the whims of emotion that manages to make even
Adam Sandler into an artist.

while Josh Childress sports the classic low
white with baby blue. Amazing how a single
type of shoe can bring happiness to so many.
Unless, of course, you have no feet. Then
you're just plumb outta luck, my friend.
4) '80s revival
I remember the 80's the first time, a time
when leg warmers, laceless Keds and torn
sweatshirts were in, and mom wrote me a
note on a napkin in my Smurfs lunchbox.
Those were good times.
5) Multi-stripes
I really hated those annoying singing
Gap ads. Other than that though, the more
colors the better! That's what I always say.
I've actually never said that before in my life,
but you get the sentiment.

sophomore effort missed this compelling tale of fa
thers and sons featuring nuanced performances by
Paul Newman and Tom Hanks and the last gorgeous
images from late cinematographer Conrad Hall.
2. Far From Heaven
This return to '50s nostalgia is striking for two rea
sons: die meticulous attention to detail afforded to
Todd Haynes' production, and the chutzpah with
which Haynes subjugates our pristine picture of the
past to deal with issues never directly addressed in
that society. Julianne Moore's performance as a per
fect TV housewife cements her reputation as an ac
tress, and Dennis Quaid manages to surprise as well.
3. About a Boy
The feel-good flick of the year was another in a re
cent string of British / Hollywood productions, again

1. Ataranjuat (The Fast Runner)
The first Inuit-language film (and not a docu
mentary) runs a captivating three hours long. Com
posed mainly of white tundra shots, the film is gor
geous to look at, something which cannot be said of
most films shot on digital video.
2. Tuvalu
This beautiful film was shot in black and white
with each scene tinted a different color. There's no
dialogue, which reinforces the film's ineffable sense
of whimsy.
3. Ma femme est une actrice (My Wife is an Ac
tress)
The year's best romantic comedy didn't star Julia
Roberts or John Cusack! (As if they ever do.)
4. The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys
Despite the unintentionally suggestive title, this
film is actually a truthful portrayal of adolescents.
Kieran Culkin gives an admirable performance as
one of the disaffected youth. Check out Jodie Foster
as a peg-legged nun!
5. Otesanek (Little Otik)
Jan Svankmajer's latest brilliant creation: Sterile
parents hope for child. Mother gives splintery birth
to bloodthirsty wooden log. (Ouch!) See the movie
now, ask questions later.

1) Dressed-up sweats
Remember how George Costanza said
he'd drape himself head-to-toe in velvet if it
were socially acceptable? Now it is! Well,
velour is anyway, which is close enough. So
drape away!
2) Preppy menswear
Anything that compels a guy to wear ar
gyle (socks don't count) is fine with me: I
heart dorks 4-ever. Mmm„.sweater vests...
3) Nike Air Force Ones
I said give me two pair! Nelly likes "the all
white high top strap with the gum bottom."
I prefer mine accented in pink rhinestones,

starring a revamped Hugh Grant and backed by Nick
Hornby's genius source material. The unsung he
roes: the Weitz brothers' unobtrusive direction and a
wonderfully evocative soundtrack by Badly Drawn
Boy.
4. Catch Me if You Can
Slick direction and a trio of performances from ac
tors at the top of their game (Leonardo DiCaprio,
Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken) make fora
movie that's just sheer fun to watch, proving that
Spielberg is at his best when he isn't cramming mes
sages down your throat.
5. Punch-Drunk Love
Auteur Paul Thomas Anderson comes back in rare
form, wisely deciding to eschew the sprawling mess of
"Magnolia" in favor of a smaller, heart-felt paean to
the whims of emotion that manages to make even
Adam Sandler into an artist.

while Josh Childress sports the classic low
white with baby blue. Amazing how a single
type of shoe can bring happiness to so many.
Unless, of course, you have no feet. Then
you're just plumb outta luck, my friend.
4) '80s revival
I remember the 80's the first time, a time
when leg warmers, laceless Keds and torn
sweatshirts were in, and mom wrote me a
note on a napkin in my Smurfs lunchbox.
Those were good times.
5) Multi-stripes
I really hated those annoying singing
Gap ads. Other than that though, the more
colors the better! That's what I always say.
I've actually never said that before in my life,
but you get the sentiment.
1. Punch-Drunk Love
P.T. Anderson's delirious follow-up to "Magnolia" is the
strangest and most moving romantic comedy I've seen in a long
time. Anderson helps Adam Sandler reveal both the vulnera
bility and genuine rage hidden beneath his past performances,
and the carefully constructed film manages to find true love
and radiant hope amidst the grimness of modern suburbia.
2. Y tu mama tambien
A teen sex comedy, a coming of age story and a meditation on
life and deatii all packed into cinematic tour of a changing Mex
ico. Alfonso Cuaron's film is thought provoking, funny and
above all vibrantly alive.
3. Spirited Away
It may not pack the emotional punch of Japanese master an
imator Hayao Miyazaki's previous masterpiece "Princess
Mononoke," but this girl's journey through the realm of gods
and spirits bursts at the seams with unforgettable visual won
ders, including a gigantic baby, bouncing heads and a dream
like train ride across the sea.
4. Bowling for Columbine
In the end, provocateur documentarian Michael Moore
bites off more than he can chew in his examination of violence
in America. But although he fails to pull together all his dis
parate ideas, along the way he raises important questions, pro
vides a few answers and strikes some satisfying points against
The Man.
5. All or Nothing
Small moments of touching and surprising humanity make
this more than just an above-average melodrama about the dif
ficulties of working-class life in London. The climactic scene be
tween the couple played by Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville
is a dazzling, tear-drenched revelation, in which two decades of
resentment and regret come pouring out.
BY RAMIN SETOODEH
1. My Big Fat Greek Wedding
Occasionally, this critic and the crowds agree. Out of the
64 films I viewed last year, none spoke to me louder — or
with more chutzpah — than this independent-turned
mainstream romantic comedy that not only redefined the
chick flick, but gave us Nia Vardalos, the most promising
chick newcomer since Renee Zellweger in "Jerry Maguire."
2. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing
Less is more in director Jill Sprecher's understated drama
about faulty coincidences, the quest for happiness and, well,
the meaning of life.
3. Insomnia
Chrisopher Nolan's second film is even more accom
plished than his first. A1 Pacino stars as a detective sent to
Alaska to solve a grizzly murder. Sounds familiar? Not here.
Hillary Swank and Robin Williams add dramatic weight to
the thriller.
4. The Quiet American
Michael Caine gives the best performance of his career as
a conflicted foreign correspondent at the time of the Viet
nam War. Brendan Fraser co-stars as the title character, a
man who is quiet not by nature, as we first assume, but be
cause he has something to hide.
5. Road to Perdition
The best gangster movie of the year wasn't directed by
Martin Scorsese. Instead, it was this summer release —
beautifully shot and directed — from Sam Mendes that may
get snubbed by the Oscars only because it was released five
months too early.
