### KAREEM GHANEM JONATHAN BEARD KIM SAMEK 
1. Various Artists — "Peanut Butter Wolf s Juke
box 455"
Assembled by legendary indie hip hop produc
er/1) J Peanut Butter Wolf, this features incredible
cuts by crucial underground artists including
Madlib, Charizma, Yesterday's New Quintet and
Lootpack. Covering funk, electro, hip hop and t he
eccentricities in between, "Jukebox 455" shows
precisely why hip hop is still exciting.
2. Sleater-Kinney — "One Beat"
Andiony Ha wasn't the only one to fall in love
once again with Sleater-Kinney this year. With a fe
rocious rock 'n' roll attack, "One Beat" is just one
more piece of evidence to show that Corin Tucker,
Janet Weiss and Carrie Brownstein are one of the
finest fucking bands ever.
3. Blackalicious — "Blazing Arrow"

Showing off the group's dexterity, intelligence
and ability to have a great time, "Blazing Arrow" is
Bay Area hip hop duo Blackalicious' major label
debut. The album is a celebration of creativity and
artistic ambition, which isn't surprising coming from
the capable hands of Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel.
4. Crack City Rockers — "Joyce Hotel"
The Crack City Rockers are not your old man's
CCR. "Joyce Hotel" mixes one part Iggy with two
parts Lou Reed resulting in the perfect feeling of
freedom that comes with great rock 'n' roll music.
Nothing this cool has come out of Portland, OR,
since, well, the new Sleater-Kinney album!
5. Imperial Teen — "On"
The San Francisco quartet's newest album plays
a deceptive trick by mixing friendly, danceable
pop hooks and melodies with intentionally vague
lyrics about an array of subjects. "On" is one of the
most overlooked records of the year.

1. N.E.R.D. — "In Search 0f..."
This time, super-producers The Nep
tunes take the name N*E*R*D and do it
for themselves — in a revolutionary way.
It's hip-hop! — wait, it's rock! — wait, it's .
. . it's unlike anything you've ever heard
before.
2. George Harrison — "Brainwashed"
The final, introspective, subtle master
piece from at rue master. George Harrison
will be sorely missed.
3. Beck — "Sea Change"

1. Azure Ray — "Burn and Shiv
er"
Some of the most beautiful
music I have ever heard, a strong
follow-up to their self-titled debut
album. You may have seen them
on the road with frequent tour
mates Bright Eyes. The harmonic
voices of Maria Taylor and Oren
da Fink are set to soft electronic
pop sounds.
2. The Raveonettes — "Whip It
On"
One of the best live shows I
have seen hands down. A female
and male harmony, this rockin'
garage-ish baud is the White
Stripes turned up and blown
away. They are certain to become
staples of both the indie scene and
the alternative radio format in the
coming future.
3. Bright Eyes —"Lifted"

Stunning in its melancholy, "Sea
Change" might well be the most sensitive
and inspired work of Beck's career.
4. Eminem — "The Eminem Show"
Yes, it was by far the most popular
album of 2002, but it also happened to be
one of the best. His daughter's cameo on
"My Dad's Gone Crazy" is the guilty plea
sure of the year.
5. Tom Waits — "Alice"
Most critics liked its also stellar compan
ion "Blood Money" more, but I prefer
"Alice" for its mixture of bar room-piano
beauty and trademark Tom Waits craziness.

Conor Oberst, a.k.a Bright
Eyes, is the Avril Lavigne of indie
rock. You may have noticed him
on the cover of several magazines
in the past month or so. This new
album features fuller string
arrangements and instruments
you can't pronounce-definitely a
more mature sound for the 22-
year-old Saddle Creek veteran.
4. Her Space Holiday — "Manic
Expressive"
This indie electronic pop duo
make the kind of music you're
sure you've heard somewhere be
fore because the songs instantly
become favorites. They are from
San Mateo, so look for local dates.
5. Tori Amos — "Scarlet's Walk"
Tori's latest is breathtaking
and lyrically rich. One of her best
albums to date, "Scarlet's Walk,"
follows Tori in her journey across
America..
