### ANTHONY HA TOP 5 PROCRASTINATION AIDS ALICE KIM TOP FIVE NON-POLITICAL CRAZY ASSES 
1. Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Long after the novelty of its initial
concept ("high school is like a horror
movie!") has worn off, the show contin
ues to be an always-unpredictable para
ble about growing up. If, as rumor has it,
the current seventh season will be the
show's last, "Buffy" will go out still on
top, providing more laughs, tears and
interesting characters and ideas than
anything else on the tube.
2. Firefly
Like "Buffy," this existential science
fiction western from "Bufly" creator Joss
Whedon handles its depth and ambiguity
with deceptive ease, and finds plenty of

time for character exploration in its fast
paced, action-packed storylines. 800 to
Fox for mishandling and canceling the
show; here's hoping that someone else
will have the brains and the courage to
pick it up.
3. Vintage Books
Continues to earn my undying love
for bringing classic science fiction novels
back into print as shiny trade paper
backs (as well as publishing the usual
"mainstream" stuff). Its lineup this year
included novels by the dazzlingly ambi
tious Samuel R. Delany and Philip K.
Dick, the master of finding truth and
poetry in pulp.
4. Kill Rock Stars
This Olympia, WA-based record

label kept the faith in 2002, putting out
excellent releases such as Bangs' "Call
and Response," Comet Gain's "Real
istes" and Sleater-Kinney's newest mas
terpiece (its fourth, by my count) "One
Beat."
5. Science Fiction Weekly
(www.scifi.com/sfw)
Far from just being a shill lor the often
godawful Sci Fi Channel, this Web site is
actually one of the best places to get your
geek on, with reviews of movies, TV
shows, books, video games and more, as
well as plenty of gossip. Plus, a monthly
column from erudite critic John Clute
makes a visit less guilt-inducing than the
more fannish aintitcool or zap2it. (And if
you have no idea what I'm talking about,
more power to you.)

1. Clonaid
These French alien-wor
shipper fake-baby-making
crazy asses were in the news
at the tail end of 2002, just in
time to make it on this list.
And how. The Raelians, a re
ligious sect that believes alien
created life on earth, an
nounced that their company
Clonaid had succeeded in
cloning a human. They SO
didn't.
2. Michael Jackson
2002 was the year of
Michael Jackson, humanitar
ian. In November, he immu
nized his baby against any ir
rational fear of heights, by ex

posing said baby to these ele
ments. Go, super father!
Fight the power! From him
we also learn the dangers of
plastic surgery, and that God
don't make no mistakes and
mm HMM we should love
our bodies just the way they
are. God bless you, Michael
Jackson. You still crazy
though.
3. Frodo Bagpns
1 ain't read "Return of the
King" or nothing, but I can
tell from the movies that
Frodo's totally going to DIE.
4. The Economy
Unrelated to politics.
5. You
Dang. In 2003, you should
tone it down.
