# Ballet and bullfighting's simple beauty
## 
### RANDY MANO 
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about "Talk to Her"
is the largely down-to-earth nature of the latest production
by wacky Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar. This guy
is well known for his wild early works, like "Tie Me Up! Tie
Me Down!" and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown." However it was his previous work, "All About
My Mother," that earned him the most accolades interna
tionally and, at least to me, remains superior to all other

films he has made thus far.
That said, there is a lot to enjoy in the taut "Talk to Her,"
with really only four characters to concentrate upon. A
clever little plot device involves large lettering shooting out
from the screen. Sometimes it's used to project a significant
change in the time schematic. Other times, it introduces
the beginning of a relationship. There is one particular
moment, toward the end, where this lettering truly works
well and captures the movie's essence. You will know what
I'm talking about when you see it.

The first couple featured
centers on ballet. 1 don't know
about you, but I don't care
much for ballet. I hope I never
get "Nutcracker" tickets as a
Christmas present. Somehow,
though, Almodovar makes you

take interest in ballet by incorporating strange elements
like a Purcell opera or a modernist interpretation involv
ing flying chairs or male bodies undulating as ocean waves.
Alicia (Leonor Wading) is the ballerina who suffers a rain
related accident and falls into a deep coma. Benigno
(Javier Camara), as her admirer-stalker, becomes her main
nurse at a hospital clinic.
Bullfighting is the focus for the other pair. Once again,
I have no desire to watch bullfighting or learn about it.
Cleverly enough, Almodovar turns bullfighting into a type
of ballet through the use of orchestral chords, the graceful
circular waving of the red flag around the bull and the
quick footwork needed to avoid getting gored. Unfortu
nately, Lydia (Rosario Flores) also becomes comatose, as
she gets mangled by the raging beast. Marco (Dario
Grandinetti), a journalist, is her admirer-lover who watch
es over her at the same clinic.
"Talk to Her" looks deceptively simple. However, I read
that, for example, all four actors had to endure a number
of coursework to make it all look real. Camara took em
broidery and hairdressing classes for his nursing moments
with Alicia. Flores listened to bullfighting experts and
adorned pricey Dolce and Gabbana suits. Watling got an
intro into ballet. The comatose women utilized yoga to
practice lying still while being scrubbed for baths or given
hair makeovers.
Pedro and his brother, Agustin (who produced), have
crafted a mostly successful feature about relationships with
and without interaction. "Talk to Her" bogs down a bit in
the middle act as the two major relationships become a bit
tiresome and an additional relationship feels a bit rushed
to accommodate a great finale. Nonetheless, the fact that
entertainers, such as ballerinas, bullfighters and actors,
thrive on sharing their talents and words with silent audi
ences is brilliantly compared to doting men who care for
their comatose beauties. Appreciate those entertainers
and loved ones for what they are worth â€” I couldn't think
of a simpler message to impart.
