# The 						Roots: Hip hop's Brits?
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
In the notes to their 1999 release
"Things Fall Apart," the Roots' MC, Black
Thought, expresses a central but unspo
ken concern for the hip-hop community:
"All too often black people approach us
after the shows to apologize for the over-

abundance of.. . white
people . . . But with all
music [created] by
African people there's a
dangerous pattern. We
create it; we nurture it,

The Roots
Phrenology

elevate it, and then abandon it." In global
terms, one might categorize the Roots are
hip hop's Brits. They are its true eccentrics
— yellow socks poking out from an other
wise decorous get-up. Their oddness is
studied and earnest, unlike the meaning
less bubblegum variety favored by their
Southern counterparts, Outkast. And
while Black Thought's sentiments ring
true on more general lines than specifical
ly racial — hip hop does appear to have
been disowned by those who feel no re
sponsibility toward the musical tradition
they are part of — the Roots themselves
have no plans to abandon it anytime soon,
even if it veers into the pretentious every
now and then.
Hip hop is literally the love of their lives.
The fundamental notion of the Roots'
work is that hip hop is really at the heart of
it all: Ifyou honor it with due respect, it will
provide the answer to most of life's prob-

lems. On the
track "Water,"
Black Thought
suggests one

way of dealing with a junkie: "Hey you bet
ter be a true friend to 'em, before the shit
put an end to 'em, or give a pen to 'em, or
lock 'em up in a studio with a mic, cos on

the real it might save his life ..
. " With "Phrenology," their
fifth album, the Roots follow a
decade-long trajectory of cru
sading against the growing
stagnation of hip hop. And

while they branch out into a number of un
chartered territories like rock 'n' roll,
(Beastie Boys "Cookie Puss" era) punk and
a surprisingly dulcet singing effort on the
part of Black Thought, it is somehow
rather predictable. The beats have become
increasingly esoteric, the rhymes more
cynical, the collaborations more varied but
event-less.
Fellow Philadelphia Child Ursula Ruck
er, whose deliciously filthy murmur capped
off every album previously, has been kept
to a bare minimum, while Nelly Furtado,
whose wispily unspectacular voice sugar
coats a forgettable track tritely entitled "Sac
rifice," is featured with blinking neon lights.
Rent-a-rappers Talib Kweli and Mos Def
are also on the album ranting about some
thing, and so are crooners Jill Scott and
Musiq Soulchild. The track usually re
served for Rucker has this time been passed
on to Amiri Baraka — a contentious poet

who holds the dubious tide of poet laureate
of New Jersey. His staccato growl does not
compensate for any of Rucker's siren-song
but it was no doubt a coup for the Roots to
get him on board.
The extended Okay Player / ll
ladelph family is massive and very tal
ented, and the Roots albums have a pe
culiar way of making it seem like the
only thing these people do is sit around
and make good music with each other.
Of course this is not the case, as the notes
to the album's single "Break You Off' let
us know. The ordeals involved with this
song are epic, and it cost the band a for
tune equivalent to three times the pro
duction costs of their first album. The
final result is something not unlike "You

Got Me": A radio-friendly jingle with ;
familiar BET r& b top-10 face. Musiq

Soulchild is sufficiently talented but
supremely derivative of the original
Roots collaborator: D'Angelo.
The polished aggression of "Illadelph
Halflife," the 1997 album that proved a
real transition from their earlier, unbri
dled and mischievously jazzy material,
has been lost on the past two albums. But
"Halflife" also gave us "What They Do,"
which finally made the Roots MTV
friendly, somehow sending them into a
state of self-congratulatory complacency
they would frown upon in others. For
my part, I'll put "Phrenology" back on
the shelf and go back to the classic "Do
You Want More?" Beautiful, simple
beats, Black Thought's impossible flow

and a healthy
dose of irrev
erence.
