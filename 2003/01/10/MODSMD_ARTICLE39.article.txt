# Weed-free Snoop exudes confidence, lack of self-control
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
Ahh, the joy I feel every time Snoop Dogg newly
graces us with his laid back drawl, laid back rhymes,
and laid back confidence. Oh yes, confidence. By
now, Snoop really is a "Boss," with his own record
label, his burgeoning career as a porn director and
of course his own "Girls Gone YVild" video ("Girls

Gone Wild — it
ain't just a video,
it's a way of life!").
But just as there
is confidence,
there is overcon
fidence, and

Snoop Dogg
Paid Tha Cost To
Be Da Boss

Snoop's new album, "Paid Tha Cost To Be Da
Boss," is loaded with both.
First for the good points. There are a bunch of
great songs here, with great ingredients. For in
stance, we get not one, but two samples of Parlia
ment's "Flashlight," and it's ALWAYS fun to hear
Nate Dogg sing a hook or two. Snoop is also finally
confident enough so that some of his paranoia has
slipped by the wayside, and he allows new sides of
himself to show. Both "I Believe in You" and "Beau
tiful" are two unexpectedly sweet love songs (the
first to his wife, the second to ???) The latter, one of
two cuts produced by The Neptunes, also happens
to seriously rock / bounce / jam. Evocative of previ
ous Neptunes-produced hits "Give It To Me" and
"Hot In Herre," "Beautiful" might be the big hit-in
waiting from "Boss." Snoop also offers a straight tip
delightful hate song in "Pimp Slapp'd," directed at
his former label's owner, Suge Knight.
Now for the bad points. I find myself wishing
more and more for the days when the 80-minute
Cl) did not exist, because nowadays artists some
times get the urge to deplete perfectly good 55-
minute albums with 25 minutes of piece-of-shit
filler— just listen to Michael Jackson's "Invincible."

One of the ways this often happens is
when, like Jackson, the artist has
FULL CONTROL over the project —
sometimes you really need that outside
hand to help you make decisions about
what to leave in or cut. Unfortunately,
Snoop Dogg has full executive control
over Boss — Dr. Ore, hell, even Master
P, are nowhere to be found. Thus, some
absolutely terrible crap ends up on the
record. Even the album's structure itself is
flawed. In what seems purely to be cocky
overconfidence, he includes two intros
("Don Doggy" and "Da Boss Would Like

To See You"), and a number of tracks that re
semble the musical equivalent of a run-on sen
tence ("Boss I'laya," and the worst of the worst,
"Batman and Robin"). Damn Snoop, EDIT!
The bottom line is that three quarters

of Boss is right up there in quality
with "Tha Last Meal," and his

classic debut "Dog
gystyle." But while the
rest of the shit doesn't

ruin the album, it se
verely taxes it. So Snoop
fans, if you're like me,
you're going to dig a
bunch of this stuff —
just keep your remote
handy to skip when nec
essary.




Look at that beautiful
bone structure! Those
cheekbones! Those
clavicles!
