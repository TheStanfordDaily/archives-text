# Republicans push for ROTC return
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The College Republicans, a campus group that
formed this September, is currently organizing a cam
paign to bring the military's Reserve Officer Training
Corps back to the Stanford campus.
Currently, Stanford does not offer ROTC classes on
campus. Stanford students involved in the Army, Navy
and Air Force must travel to Santa Clara University,
San Jose State University and UC-Berkeley, respec
tively, to take their ROTC courses.
For those like freshman Daniel Foley, who is in the
Naval ROTC, that means spending 10 to 15 hours a
week at Berkeley, five of which are spent commuting.
Foley and fellow Stanford ROTC students do not
receive any academic credit for ROTC courses. If
Foley wanted to receive transfer credit, he would have
to pay for admission at Berkeley — a cost that his
ROTC scholarship money would not cover. Even if
Foley were to enroll at Berkeley, the Registrar's Office
at Stanford would accept transfer credit in only two of
the ROTC courses.
The College Republicans, led by co-presidents
sophomore Joe Fairbanks and senior Travis Menk,
want to change that situation.
"Our position is that the ROTC is a fundamental
part of a college education for those students willing to
help their university and the United States and at the
same time get paid so that they can attend college,"
Fairbanks said.
"It's not really right... Stanford pushes diversity,
and yet they don't want to have kids who want a mili
tary education on campus," Menk said. "I feel that
[ROTC] is discriminated against. [ROTC students are]
trying to pay for their education, and Stanford is mak
ing their lives difficult... they travel for hours, and
they don't receive any credits," he said.
The College Republicans will have to tackle a series
of challenges during their campaign to bring ROTC
back to the Stanford campus. Not only will they have to
convince the University to bring the program back, but
they will also need the armed forces to agree that an on
campus program is a worthwhile investment.
The more difficult challenge, said Fairbanks, will be
convincing the University to invite ROTC back on
campus. The University would have
to overturn a series of decisions
made by the Faculty Senate in 1969
and 1970, which denied course
credit for ROTC' classes, removed
the tide of faculty from ROTC in
structors and strongly encouraged
the ROTC to leave campus.
Histoi-y Prof. Barton Bernstein
was active in opposing the ROTC's
presence on campus. He says today
that he argued against the ROTC
because it was not an academic en
terprise, textbooks were "atro
cious," grading methods were
"bizarre," professors were not cho
sen by the University, and the pro
gram was "antithetical to the Uni
versity's purpose."
The College Republicans have
suggested that the decision to re
move ROTC from campus was a re
sult of die time's strong anti-war sen
timents concerning the Vietnam
War. In fact, students burned down
the ROTC building on campus.
A brief look into University
archives detailing die meetings of
the Faculty Senate in the late 1960s
shows diat recommendations for
the decision were not formally
based on "personal feeling about
die war in Vietnam ... [nor on] po
litical or normative evalua
tions ... about the objectives of die
Department of Defense or their re
lation to the social interests of the na
tion," according to the February
1969 Final Report of the Majority
Ad Hoc Senate Committee on
ROTC.

Rattier, one of the primary griev
ances of the 1969 Report concerned
academic objections to the ROTC
program. Today, College Republi
cans and other students like Demo
crat sophomore Trevor Austin
argue that the academic rigor of
some ROTC courses — as com
pared to other courses like yoga or
posture — should deem them wor
thy of University credit.
The 1969 Report, however, does
not contest the caliber of ROTC
courses but rather finds fault in that
"the ultimate goals of these pro
grams are fixed by the Department
of Defense" and that military faculty
are appointed in an irregular fash
ion that is incompatible witii Uni
versity policy.
Current University Registrar
Roger Printup indicated that acad
emic transfer credits were not
given for ROTC programs be
cause "the coursesjust don't fit into
a degree program here at Stan
ford." Two years ago, academic
departments reviewed courses in
each of the three branches of
ROTC, and engineering was the
only department willing to give
credit in any courses.
"This is not a reflection on
ROTC or quality of instruct ion in
the classroom," Printup said.
"But, for example, if a student at
tended a nursing school prior to
coming to Stanford, we wouldn't
accept transfer credits from a
nursing program ... it is a very
specialized field."
In addition to academic con
cerns about the return of ROTC to
campus, the military's "don't ask,
don't tell" policy concerning homo
sexuals might also hinder the Col

lege Republicans' attempt to bring
ROTC back to campus, according
to Fairbanks.
Bernstein suggested that the
ROTC's return to campus would
also raise questions about students'
political freedom on campus. "[I
have] ever)' reason to believe, with
out any additional proof, that stu
dents in ROTC are not politically
free to criticize their program or
U.S. policy," he said.
Lt. David Parker of the Navy
ROTC at Berkeley explained that
ROTC students "can hold their
opinion and that is something
that the military values, but they
are not to partake in public
protest as they are members of (he
armed forces."
Senior Rory Berry, Battalion
Commanding Officer for the Navy
ROTC, said, "I don't really feel
constrained at a11... [The ROTC
is] not saying you must hold certain
beliefs about the state of the world
or politics."
If Stanford were to accept
ROTC back on campus, the Uni
versity's proposal would have to be
approved and acted upon by offi
cials in each branch of the ROTC.
For example, according to Chief of
Naval Education and Training
spokesperson Joy White, if Naval
ROTC were allowed back on cam
pus, Stanford would fill out an ap
plication from CNET and that ap
plication would stay on file until the
Secretary of the Navy decided to
establish new units.
According to Parker, a number
of factors would be considered lor
the ROTC to re-establish its pro
grain at Stanford, including the
number of participants. Currently,

only 29 Stanford students are in
volved in ROTC, as reported in the
Stanford Magazine.
A number of conservative stu
dents, however, indicated that they
would be involved in ROTC if the
program were on campus.
For example, one of the reasons
that sophomore Silvia Cruz, a mem
ber of the College Republicans,
withdrew from ROTC was the large
amount of time she spent commut
ing to Berkeley.
Sophomore Brian Head said, "I
tried to take ROTC and was unable
to because of the time required to
travel to other locations to take class.
My only concern is that the liberal
majority at Stanford is preventing

students from accessing possible
scholarship opportunities as well as
life experiences."
1 n its effort to bring ROTC back
to campus, the College Republicans
are in the process of conducting re
search on the ROTC programs by
collecting course syllabi, assign
ments and textbooks as well as sur
veying ROTC students and con
tacting commanders in the ROTC.
The group is also networking with
supportive alumni, sympathetic
faculty and national media organi
zations like the New York limes,
the Washington Times and the
O'Reilly Factor.
The College Republicans plan to
meet with the University adminis

tration in die near future to get an
initial response about its efforts.
"If the response is negative or if
the administration appears unwill
ing to work with us, then we'll start
lobbying in a blitz of action — we
plan to appeal to alumni, and lobby
the Board of Trustees, the State As
sembly, National Congress and the
Department of Defense," Fair
banks said.
Both Menks and Fairbanks
maintain that their effort is different
from previously unsuccessful and
sporadic attempts to bring back
ROTC on campus "because we're
not going to quit," Menks said.
"We're not going to give up; we're
going to keep going."
