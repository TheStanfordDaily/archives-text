# Republicans push for ROTC return
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The College Republicans, a campus group that
formed this September, is currently organizing a cam
paign to bring the military's Reserve Officer Training
Corps back to the Stanford campus.
Currently, Stanford does not offer ROTC classes on
campus. Stanford students involved in the Army, Navy
and Air Force must travel to Santa Clara University,
San Jose State University and UC-Berkeley, respec
tively, to take their ROTC courses.
For those like freshman Daniel Foley, who is in the
Naval ROTC, that means spending 10 to 15 hours a
week at Berkeley, five of which are spent commuting.
Foley and fellow Stanford ROTC students do not
receive any academic credit for ROTC courses. If
Foley wanted to receive transfer credit, he would have
to pay for admission at Berkeley â€” a cost that his
ROTC scholarship money would not cover. Even if
Foley were to enroll at Berkeley, the Registrar's Office
at Stanford would accept transfer credit in only two of
the ROTC courses.
The College Republicans, led by co-presidents
sophomore Joe Fairbanks and senior Travis Menk,
want to change that situation.
"Our position is that the ROTC is a fundamental
part of a college education for those students willing to
help their university and the United States and at the
same time get paid so that they can attend college,"
Fairbanks said.
"It's not really right... Stanford pushes diversity,
and yet they don't want to have kids who want a mili
tary education on campus," Menk said. "I feel that
[ROTC] is discriminated against. [ROTC students are]
trying to pay for their education, and Stanford is mak
ing their lives difficult... they travel for hours, and
they don't receive any credits," he said.
The College Republicans will have to tackle a series
of challenges during their campaign to bring ROTC
back to the Stanford campus. Not only will they have to
convince the University to bring the program back, but
they will also need the armed forces to agree that an on
campus program is a worthwhile investment.
The more difficult challenge, said Fairbanks, will be
convincing the University to invite ROTC back on
