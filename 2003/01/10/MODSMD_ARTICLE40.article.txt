# Roxy's best fan mail of 2002:
## The 						good, the bad and the outright perverted 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Happy New Year, my darlings. Roxy is
still a bit disheveled from holiday traveling
and furious bouts of hometown hook-ups.
This week, like Eminem, I'm "Cleaning out
my Clawwset" and addressing some of the
fan mail I've received over the past few
months. These are real, honest-to-god
emails that have graced my inbox. No
names have been changed to protect the
horny and creepy.
Subject: Re: Roxy Sass wants you to dip in
the melting pot
...just thought you should know that your columns
fill me with delight.
I'm certain I will never forget this line:
"Every night on this campus, lonely individuals
shiver with delight as they fantasize about pound
ing the innocence end of some sweetly naive, hair
less, Asian pussy."
You make me smile and think. Thanks.
-Brad
Holy shit! A girl lets one painfully pic
turesque metaphor slip, and the whole
campus gets its collective panties in a twist.
While I may have offended some of the
ladies out there, it seems I've delighted

this boy with new inasturbatory fodder.
Hairless sweethearts of Stanford, I shud
der with you.
Subject: Hi Roxy
Dear Roxy Sass,
Although Ifound your "Pants Down" article
pretty interesting, most of your columns this year
have struck me as boring. I'm not sure if you are
the same Roxy as last year, or a new one, but you
just don't seem as sassy. For instance, I haven't
read anything this year that even approaches the
magnificence of "A good date is someone who pays
for dinner and doesn't spooge in your hair," and
other lines like that from previous years. Are you
saving some raunch for later issues ? I miss the
spice.
The ordy suggestum I have fora column wendd
be a detailed How-To regarding blowjobs. Yes, it's
been done before, but it's guaranteed to stir the stu
dent body, and, especially for some underclassmen
girls who come in less-than-experienced, could
prove to be really valuable. Topics covered should
include enthusiasm, depth, ai>oidance of teething,
inclusion ofhand(s) and the classic spit vs. swallow
discussion. Also, you should suggest that practice
makes perfect, and they should all just lose their in
hibitums'jind a boy (or boys) and gel on their knees.
I don't really expect anything to come of this e
mail, and I fully admit that my suggestioti is less
than novel. Bui I just felt moved to say something.

Jeff wins the award for shrewdest "Get a
Free Blowjob" scheme. I'm sure that once
this sees print, girls will come crawling on
their knees, with mouths agape looking to
please our little man here. In his message Jeff
has both touched on many key points of giv
ing good head and illustrated a creepiness
that will surely negate any possibility of these
lips wrapped around that thang. And enthu
siasm? I couldn't get enthused about blowing
this writer unless he came diamonds and
$ 1000 bills! I will, however, go for the gold in
the next few weeks per Jeff s complaint about
my lack of spice. I've got spice, all right!

HI,

Roxy,
Compliment! I enjoy reading your articles and
they always make me smile and think back to my
fun days in college (even, though at a very different
place than Stanford). Things were very different
there, but I can relate to a lot of things in your arti
cles; things that we "grotim up" still face in this

world of rules, no rules or whatever. Keep it up!
Romeo
Frenchy and Romeo. Sound like a dream
come true, right ladies? Frenchy, scary as I
find your sweaty and panting emails, I
think you may actually be man enough to
handle the wilds of Roxy's Sassiness. You
get to be on bottom, monsieur! And
Romeo's comments about "the fun days in
college" was in response to the before men
tioned, "Melting Pot" article and hearkens
back to his good ol' "pounding the inno
cence out of Asian pussy" days. The nostal
gia is beautiful, isn't it?
Subject: new to your stuff
Dear Roxy,
lam intrigued by your work and can't wait for
your next article. When I get enough nerve J will
ask you my question seeking your adince. Until
then, keep on keeping on
-Confused and Fearful
Finally, a boy who knows his place! Con
fused and Fearful —just how I love all my
conquests. Hon, feel free drop me a line
sometime, and get the balls to ask your little
question. Don't worry — I won't leave any
marks. Give it your best shot:

just don't seem as sassy. For instance, I haven't
read anything this year that even approaches the
magnificence of "A good date is someone who pays
for dinner and doesn't spooge in your hair," and
other lines like that from previous years. Are you
saving some raunch for later issues ? I miss the
spice.
The ordy suggestum I have fora column wendd
be a detailed How-To regarding blowjobs. Yes, it's
been done before, but it's guaranteed to stir the stu
dent body, and, especially for some underclassmen
girls who come in less-than-experienced, could
prove to be really valuable. Topics covered should
include enthusiasm, depth, ai>oidance of teething,
inclusion ofhand(s) and the classic spit vs. swallow
discussion. Also, you should suggest that practice
makes perfect, and they should all just lose their in
hibitums'jind a boy (or boys) and gel on their knees.
I don't really expect anything to come of this e
mail, and I fully admit that my suggestioti is less
than novel. Bui I just felt moved to say something.

Jeff wins the award for shrewdest "Get a
Free Blowjob" scheme. I'm sure that once
this sees print, girls will come crawling on
their knees, with mouths agape looking to
please our little man here. In his message Jeff
has both touched on many key points of giv
ing good head and illustrated a creepiness
that will surely negate any possibility of these
lips wrapped around that thang. And enthu
siasm? I couldn't get enthused about blowing
this writer unless he came diamonds and
$ 1000 bills! I will, however, go for the gold in
the next few weeks per Jeff s complaint about
my lack of spice. I've got spice, all right!

Roxy,
Compliment! I enjoy reading your articles and
they always make me smile and think back to my
fun days in college (even, though at a very different
place than Stanford). Things were very different
there, but I can relate to a lot of things in your arti
cles; things that we "grotim up" still face in this

world of rules, no rules or whatever. Keep it up!
Romeo
Frenchy and Romeo. Sound like a dream
come true, right ladies? Frenchy, scary as I
find your sweaty and panting emails, I
think you may actually be man enough to
handle the wilds of Roxy's Sassiness. You
get to be on bottom, monsieur! And
Romeo's comments about "the fun days in
college" was in response to the before men
tioned, "Melting Pot" article and hearkens
back to his good ol' "pounding the inno
cence out of Asian pussy" days. The nostal
gia is beautiful, isn't it?
Subject: new to your stuff

-Confused and Fearful
Finally, a boy who knows his place! Con
fused and Fearful —just how I love all my
conquests. Hon, feel free drop me a line
sometime, and get the balls to ask your little
question. Don't worry — I won't leave any
marks. Give it your best shot:
