# 'London Calling' lives on as punk masterpiece
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
When Spin maga/ine ran an issue a few
years ago about punk music, Joe Strummer
of the Clash was quoted as saying, in effect,
that his band had "never really been punk"
or "never really saw ourselves as punk."
Maybe he was right: Even on the Clash's raw,
undeniably "punk" self-titled debut, the lis
tener can detect an ambition that would soon
expand beyond the quickly ossifying bound
aries of punk rock, that would never be satis
fied by playing one three-chord song after
another.
But to accept Strummer's statement is to
accept a narrow, insular conception of punk
rock, one that limits itself to instant-gratifica
tion music played with minimal technique to
a moshing audience of teens in torn clothes
and colored hair. And while that is how most
people see "punk," it ignores what was truly
revolutionary about the Ramones, the Sex
Pistols and their satanic offspring — the atti
tude and the spirit. For me, more than this
one particular sound, punk was and is about
clearing away the bullshit and naming
names; fuck the consequences. It's music that
seethes rebellion and a frantic, desperate de
sire for change.
Call it what you will — punk, "rebel
music" (a term that Strummer used) or just
plain rock 'n' roll — the Clash embodied the
spirit of the thing, and when understood in
this light the band's third album "London
Calling" can be seen as the great punk album,
even though its tracks incorporate ska, reg

gae, rockabilly and Gcxl knows what else.
The album refuses to follow any rules, espe
cially the ones that the Clash and fellow punk
rockers had established a few years earlier.
More than 20 years after its initial release,
"London Calling" has lost little of its power;
it's still a joyous celebration of fighting the
good fight and resisting the greedy, corrupt
masters of society.
The album embodies the wide-ranging in
terests and ambitions of the band's members,
particularly the band's de facto leaders
Strummer and Mick Jones. In its startling
mishmash of styles, backing intelligent, wide
ranging lyrics, "London Calling" looks both
forward toward a new, more international
music, and backward to the roots and myths
of rock 'n' roll.
Those rock myths inform many of the
album's best tracks, such as "Four Horse
men" and "I'm Not Down," optimistic tall
tales for those increasingly disillusioned by
the failures and betrayals of those in
power, songs depicting outlaw heroes who
come oft as crosses between Elvis and
Robin Hood.
There are also moving social and political
commentaries-such as "Spanish Bombs,"
which finds tragic shades of the Spanish Civil
War in the political struggles of the Clash's
time, and "Lost in the Supermarket," about
alienation from the modern, consumer-dri
ven society.
"London Calling's" two best tracks are
even more powerful. "Death or Glory" turns
a critical eve on the naive idealism that fuels

much of the Clash's work, sneering," 'Death
or glory' becomes just another story." But
while the band knows that most revolution
ary dreams come to nothing, its inspiring
(and not even slightly cheesy) power chords
and irrepressible spirit cannot be kept down:
"We're gonna raise trouble / we're gonna
raise hell!"
And the band's cover of "Revolution
Rock" points the way to the future, both of
the Clash and where they hoped rock and
roll would follow. Strummer sings, "Revolu
tion rock, it is a brand new rock!" and the
music backs his claim, dazzlingly fusing punk
lyrics and guitars with a reggae beat and in
strumentation. "Revolution Rock" shows
how bringing together two spiritually
aligned forms of "rebel music" can create
something that is more powerful than either
of them alone.
Looking back now, a few weeks after Joe
Strummer's death due to a heart attack, it's
easy to feel disappointed in the last 20 years
of music, with an increasingly insular and ir
relevant punk scene and with the perfor
mance of the Clash itself, who, despite sol
diering on in various incarnations for three
more albums, never again approached the
heights of "London Calling."
But instead of bitching and moaning, we
can find hope in the numerous bands and
music that the Clash did inspire and in the
still-adventurous, still broad-minded music
that Strummer was producing at the end of
his career with his band the Mescaleros. Most
importantly, we can listen again to "London

Calling" itself, which remains a masterpiece
that rocks harder, more inspiringly and in
more ways than any album before or since.
