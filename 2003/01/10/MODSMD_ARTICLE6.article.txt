# Cuts to target staff hiring, part-time tuition
## Provost presents midterm budget report at Faculty Senate meeting 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Don't panic," University Provost John
Etchemendy advised the Faculty Senate at the con
clusion of his budget report yesterday afternoon.
After presenting the senate with grim news about the
budget in its October meeting, Etchemendy clarified
why budget cuts are necessary and where the most
pressing financial problems lie.
Etchemendy's report was based on numbers that
are all merely estimates at this point, as the official
budget report does not come out until May. The pur
pose of this midterm report was to address some of
the concerns of the senate about an issue that has re
cently received national attention.
"The forecast for '04 is a document that is ever
changing," Etchemendy said, adding that figures may
change as often as every couple of weeks.
Stanford's budget is broken into two categories:
the consolidated budget and the general funds bud
get. The consolidated budget is the budget for the en
tire University and includes auxiliaries (operations
that cover their own expenses such as athletics),
grants and contracts, restricted funds and designated
funds. What remains is the general funds budget.
"This year we have the first consolidated deficit
since 1992," Etchemendy said. One of the biggest rea
sons for this deficit is the fact that the number of staff
has grown by 20 percent over the last four years. In
the same time period, neither the undergraduate stu
dent population nor the graduate student population
has increased.
