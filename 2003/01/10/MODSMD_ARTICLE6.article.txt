# Cuts to target staff hiring, part-time tuition
## Provost presents midterm budget report at Faculty Senate meeting 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Don't panic," University Provost John
Etchemendy advised the Faculty Senate at the con
clusion of his budget report yesterday afternoon.
After presenting the senate with grim news about the
budget in its October meeting, Etchemendy clarified
why budget cuts are necessary and where the most
pressing financial problems lie.
Etchemendy's report was based on numbers that
are all merely estimates at this point, as the official
budget report does not come out until May. The pur
pose of this midterm report was to address some of
the concerns of the senate about an issue that has re
cently received national attention.
"The forecast for '04 is a document that is ever
changing," Etchemendy said, adding that figures may
change as often as every couple of weeks.
Stanford's budget is broken into two categories:
the consolidated budget and the general funds bud
get. The consolidated budget is the budget for the en
tire University and includes auxiliaries (operations
that cover their own expenses such as athletics),
grants and contracts, restricted funds and designated
funds. What remains is the general funds budget.
"This year we have the first consolidated deficit
since 1992," Etchemendy said. One of the biggest rea
sons for this deficit is the fact that the number of staff
has grown by 20 percent over the last four years. In
the same time period, neither the undergraduate stu
dent population nor the graduate student population
has increased.
" These growth rates are obvi
ously unsustainable," he added.
Etchemendy also pointed to the
problem of discounted part-time
graduate tuition. It turns out that
it is actually cheaper in the long
run for graduate students to enroll
part-time, which has been costing
the University for several years.
"This part-time enrollment dis
count is just a mistake,"
Etchemendy said. "We should not
be discounting tuition for those
[students] who go part-time.
There should be a premium."
Tuition is the single largest
source of income in the general
budget, but Etchemendy assured
the senate that large tuition hikes
are not imminent.
"Our goal really is to keep the
tuition increase at 5 percent or
less," he said.
With a slowed increase in in
come, the University's expenses
have exceeded its spending capaci
ty. Spending on salaries, new build
ings, utilities and financial aid out
weighs income from endowments,
gifts, tuition and other sources.
Etchemendy alluded to salary
program reductions for both fac

ulty and start but made it clear
that the University will maintain
competitive salaries and avoid
layoffs as long as possible. In ad
dition, Etchemendy recommend
ed slowing down the rate of con
struction on campus.
Etchemendy said he remains
confident despite the adversity.
"It is a serious problem, but we
shall solve it,"he asserted. "We
will get through this — it will not
have the effect of weakening the
University."
He concluded his report with a
statement that met with roars of
laughter from the senate: "I'd
much rather be Stanford than
UC," alluding to the impending
budget cuts to California's public
higher education system.
Fac Sen considers grad
student issues
The Faculty Senate also heard
from Dr. Grace Chang, chair of the
Graduate Student Council. She
presented three of the most press
ing problems for graduate stu
dents at Stanford: poor student
adviser relationships, inconsistent
teaching methods and the absence
of interdisciplinary graduate pro
grams.
Chang emphasized the impor
tance of advisers in graduate stu

dents' lives.
"[Advisers] can range from
wonderful to abusive," she said.
She reported that a document
exists that establishes guidelines
for student-adviser interactions,
but few realize it exists, let alone
follow its stipulations.
When advising relationships
turn sour, there is often nothing
that a student can do to remedy
the situation, Chang said. To re
port something unfavorable about
an adviser could mean "the end of
[one's] career."
Several senate members
likened this situation to sexual ha
rassment. According to Prof, of
Education Eamonn Callan, this is
"something we need to come to
grips with in a very serious way."
"Abusive advising is more
prevalent than one might ex
pect," said Prof, of Medicine
Phyllis Gardner, agreeing that
action should be taken swiftly
and forcefully. "Students need a
safe harbor."
Chang told the senate that she
hopes to get a policy written soon.
"Once a policy is in place, we
can make revisions as the years go
by," she said.
Senate Chair Hank Greely told
Chang that the Senate Steering
Committee will discuss the issue.
Chang also raised the issues of

the varying teaching experiences
across graduate departments and
the difficulties of creating interdis
ciplinary programs.
In response to inconsistent
teaching methods among faculty,
she suggested that a uniform
evaluation procedure be instat
ed. To ensure consistent training
for graduate students, she sug
gested that the Center for Teach
ing and Learning be an integral
part of graduate students' teach
ing training.
"Some students may be only
grading problem sets," Chang
said. "Students want to teach."
Interdisciplinary graduate pro
grams do not exist at Stanford be
cause of a lack of incentive for pro
fessors, she contended.
"Stanford has top programs in
every school, and there is tremen
dous, but often untapped, potential
for academic achievement," she said.
Chang suggested implementing
a financial incentive for professors
to teach courses in other schools.
Graduate students' concerns
are many and varied, and the
three issues broached in yester
day's meeting merely scratched
the surface, according to Chang.
She will continue to work with the
Faculty Senate and the relevant
subcommittees to make sure that
their needs are addressed.

Etchemendy said he remains
confident despite the adversity.
"It is a serious problem, but we
shall solve it,"he asserted. "We
will get through this — it will not
have the effect of weakening the
University."
He concluded his report with a
statement that met with roars of
laughter from the senate: "I'd
much rather be Stanford than
UC," alluding to the impending
budget cuts to California's public
higher education system.
Fac Sen considers grad
student issues
The Faculty Senate also heard
from Dr. Grace Chang, chair of the
Graduate Student Council. She
presented three of the most press
ing problems for graduate stu
dents at Stanford: poor student
adviser relationships, inconsistent
teaching methods and the absence
of interdisciplinary graduate pro
grams.
Chang emphasized the impor
tance of advisers in graduate stu

dents' lives.
"[Advisers] can range from
wonderful to abusive," she said.
She reported that a document
exists that establishes guidelines
for student-adviser interactions,
but few realize it exists, let alone
follow its stipulations.
When advising relationships
turn sour, there is often nothing
that a student can do to remedy
the situation, Chang said. To re
port something unfavorable about
an adviser could mean "the end of
[one's] career."
Several senate members
likened this situation to sexual ha
rassment. According to Prof, of
Education Eamonn Callan, this is
"something we need to come to
grips with in a very serious way."
"Abusive advising is more
prevalent than one might ex
pect," said Prof, of Medicine
Phyllis Gardner, agreeing that
action should be taken swiftly
and forcefully. "Students need a
safe harbor."
Chang told the senate that she
hopes to get a policy written soon.
"Once a policy is in place, we
can make revisions as the years go
by," she said.
Senate Chair Hank Greely told
Chang that the Senate Steering
Committee will discuss the issue.
Chang also raised the issues of

the varying teaching experiences
across graduate departments and
the difficulties of creating interdis
ciplinary programs.
In response to inconsistent
teaching methods among faculty,
she suggested that a uniform
evaluation procedure be instat
ed. To ensure consistent training
for graduate students, she sug
gested that the Center for Teach
ing and Learning be an integral
part of graduate students' teach
ing training.
"Some students may be only
grading problem sets," Chang
said. "Students want to teach."
Interdisciplinary graduate pro
grams do not exist at Stanford be
cause of a lack of incentive for pro
fessors, she contended.
"Stanford has top programs in
every school, and there is tremen
dous, but often untapped, potential
for academic achievement," she said.
Chang suggested implementing
a financial incentive for professors
to teach courses in other schools.
Graduate students' concerns
are many and varied, and the
three issues broached in yester
day's meeting merely scratched
the surface, according to Chang.
She will continue to work with the
Faculty Senate and the relevant
subcommittees to make sure that
their needs are addressed.
"Don't panic," University Provost John
Etchemendy advised the Faculty Senate at the con
clusion of his budget report yesterday afternoon.
After presenting the senate with grim news about the
budget in its October meeting, Etchemendy clarified
why budget cuts are necessary and where the most
pressing financial problems lie.
Etchemendy's report was based on numbers that
are all merely estimates at this point, as the official
budget report does not come out until May. The pur
pose of this midterm report was to address some of
the concerns of the senate about an issue that has re
cently received national attention.
"The forecast for '04 is a document that is ever
changing," Etchemendy said, adding that figures may
change as often as every couple of weeks.
Stanford's budget is broken into two categories:
the consolidated budget and the general funds bud
get. The consolidated budget is the budget for the en
tire University and includes auxiliaries (operations
that cover their own expenses such as athletics),
grants and contracts, restricted funds and designated
funds. What remains is the general funds budget.
"This year we have the first consolidated deficit
since 1992," Etchemendy said. One of the biggest rea
sons for this deficit is the fact that the number of staff
has grown by 20 percent over the last four years. In
the same time period, neither the undergraduate stu
dent population nor the graduate student population
has increased.
" These growth rates are obvi
ously unsustainable," he added.
Etchemendy also pointed to the
problem of discounted part-time
graduate tuition. It turns out that
it is actually cheaper in the long
run for graduate students to enroll
part-time, which has been costing
the University for several years.
"This part-time enrollment dis
count is just a mistake,"
Etchemendy said. "We should not
be discounting tuition for those
[students] who go part-time.
There should be a premium."
Tuition is the single largest
source of income in the general
budget, but Etchemendy assured
the senate that large tuition hikes
are not imminent.
"Our goal really is to keep the
tuition increase at 5 percent or
less," he said.
With a slowed increase in in
come, the University's expenses
have exceeded its spending capaci
ty. Spending on salaries, new build
ings, utilities and financial aid out
weighs income from endowments,
gifts, tuition and other sources.
Etchemendy alluded to salary
program reductions for both fac

ulty and start but made it clear
that the University will maintain
competitive salaries and avoid
layoffs as long as possible. In ad
dition, Etchemendy recommend
ed slowing down the rate of con
struction on campus.
Etchemendy said he remains
confident despite the adversity.
"It is a serious problem, but we
shall solve it,"he asserted. "We
will get through this — it will not
have the effect of weakening the
University."
He concluded his report with a
