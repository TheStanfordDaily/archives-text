The Green Party of California
will hold a Slate Planning Confer
ence at Stanford this weekend.
Sponsored by The Stanford Green
Party, a student / faculty organiza
t ion, the plenary will feature music,
ceremonies and various speakers,
including recent gubernatorial can
didate Peter Camejo.
"These meetings are used to
bring the state party together to dis
cuss everything from nuts-and
bolts business issues to fundraising

to Green positions on current polit
ical issues," said Mitchell Smith,
Stanford Green Party adviser. He
also stressed that party affiliation is
not required for attendance, and
that "anyone interested in progres
sive issues is invited to come and
learn about the new emerging po
litical movement that the Green
Party represents."
The Green Party in the United
States emerged as a largely local po
litical phenomenon in the mid
1980s and had its first candidate on
a ballot in 1986. Alaska and Califor

n ia were the first two states in which
Green candidates received ballot
status in statewide elections, and the
2000 Presidential Campaign of
Ralph Nader brought increased
publicity and national attention to
the left-wing group.
In California, the Green Part) is
the fastest-growing part}- and has
over 155,000 registered voters and
59 elected officeholders.
On Wednesday, Green Party
member Matt Gonzalez was elect
