Green candidates received ballot

PATRICK WOOD/The Stanford Daily
ed president of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors, the second
most powerful position in city
government after the mayor. San
Francisco is now tfie largest U.S.
city or county to have its legisla
tive body headed by a Green Party
member.
Gonzalez, who will attend the con
ference, said that "the conference

serves for die Greens around the
state to reflect on what we need to do
to further our progressive efforts."
According to its Web site, die
Green Party differs in several ways
from more mainstream political
groups. It stresses grassroots partic
ipation and does not accept contri
butions from corporadons.
The party's "Ten Key Values"
emphasize equality and respect for
human diversity, cooperation, non
violence, grassroots participation,
community-based economics, de
centralized democracy, ecological

wisdom and global responsibility
and sustainability.
The Planning Conference
hopes to draw participants from
throughout the state and expects
an attendance of around 150 peo
ple. Local chapters of the party
have recently chosen several dele
gates to represent this area during
the conference. These delegates
include Judy Baker and Erik
Kiehle of Los Altos, Michael Fis
chetti of Mountain View and Jodi
Embry of San Jose.
Baker said she became interest

ed in the party during Nader's can
didacy.
"I felt then and now that this
country needs someone of Ralph's
integrity, honesty and experience
who will work for the needs of the
average citizens of this country,"
Baker said.
"Now that we see the dishon
esty that has surfaced in the cor
porate world, more than ever, we
need politicians that aren't depen
dent on and overly inlluenced by
corporate donations. The Green
Party does not accept corporate

donations and stands for every
thing I believe in, including nonvi
olent solutions to world problems
and environmental sustainability.
I think it is the party of the future,"
she said.
Smith insisted that the Green
Party is "the only choice left."
"It is the only national party I
have found, at a point where I had
despaired of ever finding such a
party, that supports all my beliefs in
peace, economic and social justice,
ecological wisdom and grassroots
democracy. We are in danger of los

ing our democracy to a corporate
minority, and the Green Party is the
only group organizing to take this
on," he said. »
