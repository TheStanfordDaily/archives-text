On Tuesday, the University's
Board of Trustees announced the
election of four new members: Jon
Blum, Class of '84, Young Boozer
111, Class of '71, Michael Choo,
Class of' 96, and Dr. Joy Simmons,

sent out 30,000 e-mails to Stanford
alumni who had graduated be

The association also advertised in
the online alumni newsletter and
contacted recent alumni from the
various graduate departments on
campus. Volunteers for the Cam
paign for Undergraduate Educa
tion's "Think Tour" were also
asked to nominate candidates.
The 420 applications that the
Alumni Association received were
double the largest number of ap
plicants in previous years. The ap
plicants were reviewed by the
Alumni Association Board Nomi
nating Committee and a smaller
group of semifinalists were giant-
