On Tuesday, the University's
Board of Trustees announced the
election of four new members: Jon
Blum, Class of '84, Young Boozer
111, Class of '71, Michael Choo,
Class of' 96, and Dr. Joy Simmons,
Class of '74. Elected from a pool of
420 applicants, each of the new
trustees endured an exacting selec
tion process.
"The new trustees selected by
the Board of Trustees were based
upon the joint recommendation of
the Alumni Association Board
Nominating Committee and the
Board of Trustees Nominating
Committee," said Isaac Stein, the
board's chair. "The nomination fol
lowed an extensive solicitation of
nominations which resulted in
more than twice as many applicants
as had ever applied in the past."
This year was the first in which
the Alumni Association's nominat
ing committee instituted an online

application procedure in hopes
that the ease of an online applica
tion would encourage a greater
number of alumni to apply.
The process began early last
year when the Alumni Association
sent out 30,000 e-mails to Stanford
alumni who had graduated be
tween the years 1991 and 1998.
The association also advertised in
the online alumni newsletter and
contacted recent alumni from the
various graduate departments on
campus. Volunteers for the Cam
paign for Undergraduate Educa
tion's "Think Tour" were also
asked to nominate candidates.
The 420 applications that the
Alumni Association received were
double the largest number of ap
plicants in previous years. The ap
plicants were reviewed by the
Alumni Association Board Nomi
nating Committee and a smaller
group of semifinalists were giant-

After narrowing the group
down to several finalists, the Alum
ni Association passed the list of po
tential members on to the Board of
Trustees Nominating Committee,
which selected four candidates.
These four were then elected by the
Board of' Trustees.
"11 was a very well-done and thor
ough process," Stein said. '"Hie new
trustees all have substantial records
as committed volunteers for Stan
ford. This experience gives them a
deep familiarity with the long-term
issues facing the University."
The Board of Trustees, which
has a maximum of 35 members,
manages the University's endow
ment and property, including the
hospitals. The board's other duties
include developing an annual bud
get as well as new policies for the
University. Stanford's founding
grant also provides the Board of
Trustees with the authority to ap
point the University's president.
.Although the new members of
the board do not currently have
any specific priorities or projects,
they have high ambitions to make a
distinct contribution to the board as
a whole.
"Their diverse backgrounds will
make an important contribution to

the board," Stein said.
Blum, Boozer, Choo and Sim
mons all have continued to partici
pate in the Stanford community
after graduation. While they work
in different fields and have become
involved in a multitude of academ
ically oriented projects, the four
are linked by their positive Stan
ford experience.
"As a student from New Jersey,
Stanford gave me the opportunity
to make lasting friendships with
people all over the nation and
opened doors for my career," said
Choo, who now serves as an associ
ate at the private equity firm WL
Ross & Co.
"1 had a great time at Stanford as
an undergrad and want to do all
that 1 can as an alumnus to protect
and enhance its standing through
out the nation," he said.
The new trustees have adopted
the broad goal of helping to grow
the University's endowment in
order to support financial aid pro
grams and other projects that sup
port undergraduate education.
"For Stanford to maintain an ex
ceptional student body and a
world-class faculty, we need to
build our endowment in order to
preserve our commitment to need
based financial aid for students and
competitive salary programs for
our faculty," concluded Choo.
"Students, faculty and alumni all
have made Stanford one of the
world's greatest universities."
