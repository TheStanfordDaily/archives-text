## OPEC to boost oil production 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) —
OPEC members agreed yesterday
to boost the cartel's oil production
target by 6.5 percent to stabilize a
world market jittery over a crisis in
Venezuela and the possibility of
war in Iraq. The news comes
amidst the increased deployment
of U.S forces, which will double the
presence of American military in
the region.
The increase of 1.5 million bar
rels a day — to 24.5 million bar
rels — would take effect Feb. 1,
OPEC President Abdullah bin
Hamad A1 Attiyah told a news
conference at the group's head
quarters in Vienna.
A1 Attiyah confirmed that the
Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries wants to keep
prices of its benchmark blend of
crudes at $22-$2B per barrel. Fri
day prices hovered around $30.
Earlier in the day, Saudi Arabi
an Oil Minister Ali Naimi said the

ceiling should remain at 23 million
barrels. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's
most influential member and has
the bulk of the cartel's spare pro
duction capacity.
OPEC said it wanted to calm
fears of a supply crunch caused
by an ongoing strike in
Venezuela. The agreed output
hike was near the upper end of
what analysts expected.
The Venezuelan strike,
launched Dec. 2 by political oppo
nents seeking to oust President
Hugo Chavez, has slashed the
country's exports by about 2 mil
lion barrels a day. Venezuela nor
mally is OPEC's third-largest pro
ducer and a major oil supplier to
the United States.
However, A1 Attiyah said the
arrangement would be only tempo
rary. When Venezuela resumes its
normal level of exports, the group's
members will meet again to reassess
its production target, he said.

The suddenness of OPEC's de
cision to call the meeting reflects its
surprise at the deterioration in
market conditions. Oil ministers
for four of the group's 11 mem
bers could not make it because of
prior commitments.
Crude prices surged in recent
weeks but then fell sharply in an
ticipation of OPEC's boosting pro
duction. Fears about a possible
U.S.-led war against Iraq have put
upward pressure on world prices.
A1 Attiyah insisted that OPEC
had not been pressured by the U.S.
or other importers to approve a
large increase in production.
OPEC's new production ceiling
will be shared among 10 members,
but not Iraq. Although it is the
11th member, Iraq does not par
ticipate in the group's production
agreements because the United
Nations oversees its exports under
sanctions dating to the 1991 Per
sian Gulf War.

Troops around the country are headed for the Persian Gulf where the U.S. is doubling its current troop size in ad
vance of a possible confrontation with Iraq. Fears about an Iraqi war and widespread strikes in Venezuela prompt
ed OPEC to boost oil production yesterday.
