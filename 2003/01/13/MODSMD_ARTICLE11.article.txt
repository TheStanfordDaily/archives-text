SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —The Unit
ed States is willing to consider energy aid
for North Korea if it ends nuclear weapons
development, a U.S. envoy said today.
The comments by Assistant U.S. Secre
tary of State James Kelly raised the possi
bility that the United States was willing to
make a deal with North Korea to resolve
concerns over its nuclear activities.
"Once we get beyond nuclear
weapons, there may be opportunities
with the U.S., with private investors, with
other countries to help North Korea in
the energy area," Kelly said at a news con
ference in Seoul.

U.S. officials previously said they
would not reward North Korea for aban
doning its nuclear programs, saying dis
cussions of aid and better ties must follow
steps to dismantle those programs.
But Kelly appeared to be offering a
"carrot" to North Korea, which insisted
yesterday that it never admitted having a
secret nuclear program, sending another
conflicting signal in the escalating crisis
over its alleged plans to build nuclear
weapons.
"We are willing to talk to North Korea
about their response to the international
community," on the nuclear issue, Kelly

said, echoing recent comments by other
U.S. officials.
In October, the United States said
North Korea admitted having a weapons
program. That announcement touched
off the latest standoff, which has led to
North Korea's decision last week to with
draw from the landmark Nuclear Non
proliferation Treaty.
"The claim that we admitted develop
ing nuclear weapons is an invention fab
ricated by the U.S. with sinister inten
tions," South Korea's Yonhap news
agency quoted the official Rodong Sin
mun newspaper as saying.
