### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
After the Stanford men's bas
ketball team's come-from-behind
victory over Oregon State on
Thursday night, sophomore
swingman Josh Childress closed
down Maples Pavilion.

After the fans were gone.
After the Band and the Dollies
had finished their cooldowns.
And after most of his coaches
and teammates had already left for
the night, Childress, along with
freshman point guard Jason Haas,
stayed behind to shoot.
Although Stanford had some
how survived the test set forth by
an upset-hungry Beaver squad,
there was still a bigger game left on
the horizon for the Cardinal and
Childress. Stanford's second-lead
ing scorer knew that a repeat of his
four-point, four-foul performance
on Thursday just wouldn't suffice
against No. 12 Oregon.
The late night shootaround
paid quick dividends as Childress
bounced back to score 14 points,
grab eight rebounds, dish out five
assists and tally two blocks in Stan
ford's 81-57 dismantling of the de
fending regular-season Pacific-10
Conference champion Ducks.
"I think it was a good win for us,"
Childress said. "The difference
today was that we came out and
played aggressive from the start
and that was the key to our success."
The Cardinal wasted no time

getting on the scoreboard Satur
day afternoon as junior shooting
guard Matt Lottich, still sizzling
from Thursday evening's heroic
23-point performance, opened the
game with a 3-pointer. He finished
the game with 15 points on 5-of-7
shooting from 3-point land.
After trading baskets for the
first four minutes of play, Stanford
went on a 14-4 run to extend its
lead to 12 points.
Oregon went on a run of its own
led by junior point guard Luke
Ridnour but never got closer than
four points. The Ducks went into
the locker room at halftime down
by 12 to a Cardinal team that shot
54 percent from the field and 56
percent from behind the arc in the
first period.
"The way they shot the ball
tonight shows me that they had
their mental up," Oregon head
coach Ernie Kent said. "Stanford

just went to another level. They
were all-world tonight."
The shooting clinic that Stan
ford put on in the first half was
complemented well by the Cardi
nal's ability to defensively domi
nate the entire Oregon squad, es
pecially junior swingman Luke
Jackson (guarded by Childress
and Robinson), who only man
aged seven points in 29 minutes
of play.
In fact, Ridnour was the only
Duck to score in double figures
(Childress, Robinson, Barnes and
Lottich, on the other hand, all
reached double digits for Stan
ford). Ridnour finished the game
with a quiet 19 points, to lead all
scorers, but only tallied two assists.
"I couldn't say enough about
Luke Ridnour and how he battled
in this game considering he had a
boot on his foot yesterday [due to a
sprained ankle that occurred in

Thursday's game against Califor
nia]," Kent said. "Not taking any
thing away from Stanford [defen
sively], but I think it's more of
Luke Jackson shutting down Luke
Jackson."
The highly touted Luke tan
dem, which usually averages 36.3
points per game combined, shot a
lowly 9-for-28 from the field in the
game.
The second half saw more of the
same.
Stanford went on an 11 -0 run to
extend its lead to 23 points in the
opening three minutes, and Ore
gon never made any significant
run to challenge the Cardinal's
dominating performance.
Even when the Duck's imple
mented a desperate fullcourt press
in the second half, the Cardinal
looked unfazed â€” a definite im
