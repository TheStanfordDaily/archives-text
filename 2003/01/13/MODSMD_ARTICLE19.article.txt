# Card only rises for stiff competition
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It is becoming the all-too-often-told tale of
Mike Montgomery and his squad.
On Thursday against a struggling Oregon
State squad picked to finish in the bottom of the
Pacific-10 Conference, the Cardinal men came
out flat and uninspired. They gave up loose balls
and easy layups, struggling for most of the game
with around a 10-point deficit that they just
couldn't seem to overcome.
Luckily for Stanford, the team was able to ride
the coattails of a streak of hot shooting from ju
nior Matt Lottich, and managed to pull out the

victory over the Beavers.
But the win didn't come without questions of
how the under-manned Cardinal would fair
against a much more talented Oregon squad two
days later.
However, Stanford has given "rising to the
competition" new meaning, as this overused
cliche has become more than a catchphrase, but a
way of life for the Cardinal.
With wins over then-No. 7 Florida and then-
No. 11 Xavier early in the season, and now the 81-
57 win over No. 12 Oregon at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday, Stanford has put up a 3-0 mark against
top-15 competition.
"We picked a good time to
have our best performance of the
year," Montgomery said after the
Cardinal's latest big win. "That
certainly wasn't the team you saw
Thursday night."
From the tip off, the Cardinal
established that it had come to
play. The team nailed shots,

grabbed rebounds, scrambled
for loose balls and maintained
defensive presence on a quick
Duck squad.
"They were just on fire
tonight, not just in their shooting
but in their fire, their intensity,"
said Oregon coach Ernie Kent.
"They were all over the floor.
They were just sensational."
Most people wouldn't consid
er putting up one's best perfor
mances against the toughest
teams to be that much of a prob
lem, but the Cardinal recognizes

that it has to put up these types of
performances every game if it ex
pects to be competitive.
"This is not one of the old
Stanford teams that can not be at
their best and still have a shot,"
Montgomery said. "We have a
tendency to get ourselves ready
for teams that have reputations.
We are trying to explain to [the
players] in this league everyone
has a reputation."
"We have to come out and play
like this every night," added
sophomore forward Nick Robin
son.
The question everyone is ask
ing is what is the link that pulls
the Stanford puzzle together and
allows the team to find success
and synchrony — and why does
it only come out against big-name
opponents.
With any young team, confi
dence seems to be a major factor.
Players like Lottich and Robinson
are much more effective when
they hit early shots, and good
shooting translates into good de
fense and hustle.
In addition, in all three wins
over ranked opponents, Stanford
has shot well from behind the 3-
point line, getting buckets from a
wide variety of players. Satur
day's mark of 57.9 percent from
behind the arc saw four players
hitting outside buckets.
As the sixth-man-turned
starter, Robinson also received
credit from Montgomery for
being a key factor in Saturday's
win.
"We had people step up when
things turned on us a bit, and at
least a couple of times that person
was Nick Robinson," Mont
gomery said. "There is no reason
for Nick not to be able to play that
well. If you recall against Xavier
he made some big threes and that
made the difference. It would be
a nice addition if Nick could be
that consistent and be that good
the rest of the year."
If Robinson can keep up his
game, especially after the return
of junior forward Justin Davis to
the lineup, the Cardinal will be in
good shape, with six players it can
consistently turn to fora basket
or a rebound.
But regardless of personnel,
experience seems to be the key to
maintaining this type of success.

Many of the Stanford players are
being depended on for the first
time in a leadership role.
Senior guard Julius Barnes
has calmed down and become
more of a floor leader. As the Pac
-10 continues, he should become
even more adept at getting his
teammates involved.
Sophomore center Rob Little
has mastered some nice moves in
the paint, and hopefully with
some more time on the court, he
will learn to avoid picking up
careless fouls.

Sophomore forward Josh
Childress and Lottich are begin
ning to recognize they don't have
the cushion of a Casey Jacobsen
to bail them out of a tough game
and that they will be relied on to
generate offense from the
perimeter.
When the pieces fall into place,
everyone has seen what the Car
dinal is capable of.
"If Stanford plays like that
every night, they could contend
fora Pac-10 championship,"
Kent said.

It is becoming the all-too-often-told tale of
Mike Montgomery and his squad.
On Thursday against a struggling Oregon
State squad picked to finish in the bottom of the
Pacific-10 Conference, the Cardinal men came
out flat and uninspired. They gave up loose balls
and easy layups, struggling for most of the game
with around a 10-point deficit that they just
couldn't seem to overcome.
Luckily for Stanford, the team was able to ride
the coattails of a streak of hot shooting from ju
nior Matt Lottich, and managed to pull out the

victory over the Beavers.
But the win didn't come without questions of
how the under-manned Cardinal would fair
against a much more talented Oregon squad two
days later.
However, Stanford has given "rising to the
competition" new meaning, as this overused
cliche has become more than a catchphrase, but a
way of life for the Cardinal.
With wins over then-No. 7 Florida and then-
No. 11 Xavier early in the season, and now the 81-
57 win over No. 12 Oregon at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday, Stanford has put up a 3-0 mark against
top-15 competition.
"We picked a good time to
have our best performance of the
year," Montgomery said after the
Cardinal's latest big win. "That
certainly wasn't the team you saw
Thursday night."
From the tip off, the Cardinal
established that it had come to
play. The team nailed shots,

grabbed rebounds, scrambled
for loose balls and maintained
defensive presence on a quick
Duck squad.
"They were just on fire
tonight, not just in their shooting
but in their fire, their intensity,"
said Oregon coach Ernie Kent.
"They were all over the floor.
They were just sensational."
Most people wouldn't consid
er putting up one's best perfor
mances against the toughest
teams to be that much of a prob
lem, but the Cardinal recognizes

that it has to put up these types of
performances every game if it ex
pects to be competitive.
"This is not one of the old
Stanford teams that can not be at
their best and still have a shot,"
Montgomery said. "We have a
tendency to get ourselves ready
for teams that have reputations.
We are trying to explain to [the
players] in this league everyone
has a reputation."
"We have to come out and play
like this every night," added
sophomore forward Nick Robin
son.
The question everyone is ask
ing is what is the link that pulls
the Stanford puzzle together and
allows the team to find success
and synchrony — and why does
it only come out against big-name
opponents.
With any young team, confi
dence seems to be a major factor.
Players like Lottich and Robinson
are much more effective when
they hit early shots, and good
shooting translates into good de
fense and hustle.
In addition, in all three wins
over ranked opponents, Stanford
has shot well from behind the 3-
point line, getting buckets from a
wide variety of players. Satur
day's mark of 57.9 percent from
behind the arc saw four players
hitting outside buckets.
As the sixth-man-turned
starter, Robinson also received
credit from Montgomery for
being a key factor in Saturday's
win.
"We had people step up when
things turned on us a bit, and at
least a couple of times that person
was Nick Robinson," Mont
gomery said. "There is no reason
for Nick not to be able to play that
well. If you recall against Xavier
he made some big threes and that
made the difference. It would be
a nice addition if Nick could be
that consistent and be that good
the rest of the year."
If Robinson can keep up his
game, especially after the return
of junior forward Justin Davis to
the lineup, the Cardinal will be in
good shape, with six players it can
consistently turn to fora basket
or a rebound.
But regardless of personnel,
experience seems to be the key to
maintaining this type of success.

Many of the Stanford players are
being depended on for the first
time in a leadership role.
Senior guard Julius Barnes
has calmed down and become
more of a floor leader. As the Pac
-10 continues, he should become
even more adept at getting his
teammates involved.
Sophomore center Rob Little
has mastered some nice moves in
the paint, and hopefully with
some more time on the court, he
will learn to avoid picking up
careless fouls.

Sophomore forward Josh
Childress and Lottich are begin
ning to recognize they don't have
the cushion of a Casey Jacobsen
to bail them out of a tough game
and that they will be relied on to
generate offense from the
perimeter.

everyone has seen what the Car
dinal is capable of.

every night, they could contend
fora Pac-10 championship,"
Kent said.
