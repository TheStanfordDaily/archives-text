EUGENE, Ore. — McArthur
Court has been a house of horrors
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team over the years; most re
cently, the Cardinal had dropped
three out of its past four at Oregon.

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 75, Oregon 74

And fora while Saturday night,
it seemed like old times in that
aged Eugene building. The deci
bel level got so ridiculously high
that the arena shook (literally, the
backboards trembled in fear), and
players couldn't even hear the sets
called from the bench.
But junior forward Nicole Pow
ell came through in the game's
waning moments to make sure all
that craziness was for naught.
After a crazy sequence of
events, Powell nailed two free
throws with 1.3 seconds left as No.
6 Stanford (12-1, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) eked out a thrilling
75-74 victory over the Ducks (6-9,
2-4) and extended its Pac-10 win

3.3 seconds remaining, appeared
doomed to yet another faltering at
Mac Court.
But after a timeout, and a dia
grammed play by head coach Tara

basketball's version of the Hail Mary.

elbow and drew a foul.
Boos immediately rained out
from Ducks supporters, who
thought the foul was called on
what appeared to be a clean block
by the trailing Brandi Davis.
But the officials ruled the foul
occurred on the floor — where
Gunderson visibly tackled Powell
from behind — so the junior
stepped to the line facing a one
and-one situation.
As an angry crowd tried to up
root Mac Court from its founda
tions, Powell made both shots at the
stripe (letting out a primal scream
to the rafters after making the front
end), and Stanford escaped the
Pac-10's toughest road venue by
erasing a second-half deficit for the
