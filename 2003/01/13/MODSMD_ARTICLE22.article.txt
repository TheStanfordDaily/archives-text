# Gentry takes 157 title at Davis' Aggie Open
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Only two days removed from a
lopsided 38-6 loss at home to
Pennsylvania, the Stanford
wrestling team demonstrated that,
while down, it is certainly not out
this season with a strong showing
on Saturday at the Aggie Open at
UC-Davis.
Fourteen wrestlers competed
for Stanford (2-6), which was look
ing to get back on track after its dis
mal performance against the
Quakers, its fifth straight dual
meet loss.
With several redshirts — who
cannot compete in dual meets —

getting a chance to suit up with
other team members at Davis,
Stanford took full advantage of the
opportunity to snap out of its re
cent struggles.
The Cardinal's success was
highlighted by redshirt sopho
more Matt Gentry's title at 157
pounds and a pair of place-win
ners at 174, redshirt freshman
Ryan Hagen and senior Harold
Penson, who finished in third and
fifth, respectively.
Hagen's 5-1 record included a
tight 3-1 decision over Minnesota's
Casey Flaherty and a 7-2 downing
of Menlo's Will Falvey. The only
blemish in Hagen's record came in
a 1-0 loss to Penn's Greg Hallahan

in his second bout of the day.
Three wins later, however,
Hagen would have the last word,
earning a 5-2 decision over Halla
han in the third-place bout.
"This really helped my confi
dence because I'm finally doing
what I should be doing," Hagen
said.
After not starting on Thursday
against Penn, Penson was equally
impressive at 174, needing just five
total minutes to pin his first two op
ponents. In his next bout, he lost to
Penn's Matt Herrington, the even
tual champion at 174, in a close 8-
6 decision before tallying yet an
other pin against Fullerton's Jon
Brandon.

Penson, who came into the
tournament with just four wins
and one pin this season, would add
two more wins on the day, includ
ing a 13-0 major decision over Co
lumbia's Nick Carrier, and fin
ished with a 5-3 record.
"I felt like the team had a lot of
setbacks over winter break and so
did I," Penson said. "Today, I
stopped caring about winning and
started caring about performing,
and it made a difference."
But the most impressive perfor
mance belonged to Gentry, who
increased his team-leading victory
total to 19 with a 4-0 record on Sat

urday.
Gentry tallied major decisions
in his first two bouts, outscoring
the two opponents by a combined
20-2.
His final two bouts, however,
were not quite as easy.
Against Columbia's Dustin Till
man, it took a takedown in over
time for Gentry to emerge with a
9-7 victory. One tight bout fol
lowed another, as four points in
the final period rallied the Stan
ford captain to a 7-5 decision over
Pima College's Josh Medina to se
cure the title.
"It was a tough day," said Gen
try, who placed second at the Davis
Open at 147 last year. "It's all men
tal and I just had to keep after it,
and then things happened. I know
I'm in shape and I can wrestle the
best. I've seen improvement and
potential to do even better."
Junior Nathan Peterson put to
gether a 3-2 performance at 125,
including a 9-0 major decision
over Cal Poly's Juan Ramerez. Pe
terson lost 6-3 to Columbia's
Daniel Green in his final bout,
denying him a top finish.
True freshmen Josh Brown,
Brian Perry and Nico Beck also
competed in the tournament.
Brown lost his first bout and for
feited his second due to injury,
while Perry scored a couple of wins
to finish 2-2.

At 197, Beck had a tough day
and finished 1-3. Freshman lan
Bork, Stanford's starter at 197,
recorded his only win of the day
with a pin of Beck, dropping an
other bout in overtime to Prince
ton's lan Roncoroni.
Stanford freshman heavy
weight Shawn Ritzenthaler defeat
ed Menlo's Ben Flores 11-7 and
added a technical fall against San
Francisco State's Chris Bostick in

finishing 2-2 on the day.
The Cardinal had a tough day
at 184, as redshirt freshman Larry
Ozowara and freshman Mark
Egesdal combined for an 0-4
record.
"Overall it was nice to see some
guys who have been struggling get
wins, and it's always nice to have a
champion," Stanford head coach
Steve Buddie said. "It's a step in
the right direction for us."

Stanford's dual-meet schedule
resumes on Friday when the Car
dinal travels north to Eugene and
Corvallis fora pair of dual meets
against the Oregon schools. The
Cardinal will take on Oregon in
the afternoon before traveling up
1-5 to take on Oregon State in the
evening.
On Saturday, Stanford will
complete its busy weekend with a
meet at Portland State.
