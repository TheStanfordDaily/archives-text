# International freshmen arrive on campus after visa delays
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
After missing Stanford's fall
quarter enrollment deadline be
cause of delays in receiving their
student visas, three new interna
tional students arrived on campus
early this month to begin their
freshman years — freshman
years that only three months ago
they weren't sure they would ever
have because of the U.S. govern
ment crackdown on student visa
applications.
Like hundreds of other interna
tional students who had planned to
enroll in American universities last
fall but were not issued student
visas on time, Shameel Ahmad of
Pakistan and Zi Shen Lim and Hau
Jia Chew of Malaysia were forced to
defer enrollment fora quarter,
until their visa applications were
approved.
Post-Sept. 11 U.S. government
efforts to more thoroughly screen
student visa applicants — especial
ly males from predominantly Mus
lim countries — have caused de
lays in issuing visas. A process that
used to take only a matter of days
often now takes between six weeks
and as much as three months.
"I applied for my visa in mid-
July — I was told by the consular
officer interviewing me that new
background checks would take
longer to complete but that I

would definitely have my visa by
the end of August, 45 days from
the date of application," Ahmad
said. "1 finally got a phone call in
late November from them [saying
they had approved my applica
tion]. If I hadn't been approved by
that point in time, I probably
would have been forced to defer
another year, or drop out of Stan
ford altogether."
While most visas are being de
layed and not denied, some foreign
governments and foreign-student
sponsors are encouraging students
to consider studying in other coun
tries to avoid the hassle and frus
tration that students like Ahmad,
Chew and Lim have
experienced — a trend that could
make it difficult for American uni
versities to sustain their interna
tional enrollment in coming years.
"We almost went to Australia or
France," Lim said, explaining that
he and other students who were
part of the American Degree
Foundation Program were en
couraged by the Malaysian gov
ernment to look into other univer
sities when the United States de
layed their visas.
"We really don't know if
[Malaysia] will cut down the num
ber of students they will send to the
United States," he added, noting
that many sponsors have been an
gered by the delays.
For all three freshmen, the last

several months were characterized
by uncertainty — none of the three
was given any reason for why his
visa was delayed, and in all three
cases the American embassies were
unable to speed up the process or
give any indication of when the
visas finally would be issued.
"They wouldn't tell when you
would get your visa; they just told
you to wait," Chew said.
Ahmad said he found his delay
surprising since he had spent the
last year only 25 minutes from
Stanford at Saratoga High School.
"The strange thing ... is that I
spent my senior year of high
school here, after coming from
Singapore," said Ahmad, whose
father is a diplomat. "I left in
June, expecting to be back in Sep
tember in time to join the rest of
the Class of 2006, but the visa
never materialized."
Ahmad, who is Muslim, said he
was not contacted for any extra in
terviews while he was waiting to re
ceive his visa.
Chew and Lim, who both spent
a year after completing their regu
lar studies in the ADFP with 300
other students preparing to enter
U.S. colleges, were among about
150 of those students who had
their visas delayed. According to
Lim, most of the 150 women in the
program were granted their visas
in a matter of days, whereas almost
all of the men experienced delays
of several months.
"I think every country has its
own rights to visa issues ... based
on the security in their own coun
try," Chew said. But, he added, it is
inappropriate fora country to take
extreme measures that have a
detrimental effect on students'
studies.
Lim said that despite seemingly
amicable relations between
Malaysia and the United States, his
country is still one that is being es
pecially affected by new visa is
suance procedures.
"Malaysia is cooperating with
the U.S.; the leaders have met
many times," Lim said. "[The U.S.
government] has given lots of
promises, but in the end, the delays
keep dragging on longer and
longer."
Chew applied for his visa in
early summer and received it in
October; Lim did not receive his
until December.
All three said that they stayed in
contact with the University while
they were waiting on their visas,
and Lim said that administrators
from the Admissions Office and
the Bechtel International Center

made calls to Washington, D.C.
and the American embassy in
Kuala Lumpur.
Since finally arriving on cam
pus, the three freshmen have had
an accelerated orientation process
and are trying to catch up, acade
mically and socially, with the rest of
their class.
All three said they were warmly
welcomed by students who had
been anticipating their arrival for
months.
"People have been making jokes
about 'liberating Shameel from
Pakistan,'" Ahmad said.
Ahmad, who used his new
found time at the end of 2002 to
complete two internships in Pak
istan, has moved into Cardenal
and joined Structured Liberal Ed
ucation — the first time the Uni
versity has allowed a student to
start the program late. He plans to
take either the first quarter of SLE
or an Introduction to the Human
ities course next fall.
Chew and Lim both said they
hope to graduate on time with
the rest of the Class of 2006. De
spite their difficulties, they ex
pect that students from Malaysia
will continue to matriculate at
colleges in the United States like
Stanford.
"There are juniors who are back
home and are applying to Ameri
can universities and will be coming
next fall. . . hopefully," Chew said.

another year, or drop out of Stan
ford altogether."
While most visas are being de
layed and not denied, some foreign
governments and foreign-student
sponsors are encouraging students
to consider studying in other coun
tries to avoid the hassle and frus
tration that students like Ahmad,
Chew and Lim have
experienced — a trend that could
make it difficult for American uni
versities to sustain their interna
tional enrollment in coming years.
"We almost went to Australia or
France," Lim said, explaining that
he and other students who were
part of the American Degree
Foundation Program were en
couraged by the Malaysian gov
ernment to look into other univer
sities when the United States de
layed their visas.
"We really don't know if
[Malaysia] will cut down the num
ber of students they will send to the
United States," he added, noting
that many sponsors have been an
gered by the delays.
For all three freshmen, the last

several months were characterized
by uncertainty — none of the three
was given any reason for why his
visa was delayed, and in all three
cases the American embassies were
unable to speed up the process or
give any indication of when the
visas finally would be issued.
"They wouldn't tell when you
would get your visa; they just told
you to wait," Chew said.
Ahmad said he found his delay
surprising since he had spent the
last year only 25 minutes from
Stanford at Saratoga High School.
"The strange thing ... is that I
spent my senior year of high
school here, after coming from
Singapore," said Ahmad, whose
father is a diplomat. "I left in
June, expecting to be back in Sep
tember in time to join the rest of
the Class of 2006, but the visa
never materialized."
Ahmad, who is Muslim, said he
was not contacted for any extra in
terviews while he was waiting to re
ceive his visa.
Chew and Lim, who both spent
a year after completing their regu
lar studies in the ADFP with 300
other students preparing to enter
U.S. colleges, were among about
150 of those students who had
their visas delayed. According to
Lim, most of the 150 women in the
program were granted their visas
in a matter of days, whereas almost
all of the men experienced delays
of several months.
"I think every country has its
own rights to visa issues ... based
on the security in their own coun
try," Chew said. But, he added, it is
inappropriate fora country to take
extreme measures that have a
detrimental effect on students'
studies.
Lim said that despite seemingly
amicable relations between
Malaysia and the United States, his
country is still one that is being es
pecially affected by new visa is
suance procedures.
"Malaysia is cooperating with
the U.S.; the leaders have met
many times," Lim said. "[The U.S.
government] has given lots of
promises, but in the end, the delays
keep dragging on longer and
longer."
Chew applied for his visa in
early summer and received it in
October; Lim did not receive his
until December.
All three said that they stayed in
contact with the University while
they were waiting on their visas,
and Lim said that administrators
from the Admissions Office and
the Bechtel International Center

made calls to Washington, D.C.
and the American embassy in
Kuala Lumpur.
Since finally arriving on cam
pus, the three freshmen have had
an accelerated orientation process
and are trying to catch up, acade
mically and socially, with the rest of
their class.
All three said they were warmly
welcomed by students who had
been anticipating their arrival for
months.
"People have been making jokes
about 'liberating Shameel from
Pakistan,'" Ahmad said.
Ahmad, who used his new
found time at the end of 2002 to
complete two internships in Pak
istan, has moved into Cardenal
and joined Structured Liberal Ed
ucation — the first time the Uni
versity has allowed a student to
start the program late. He plans to
take either the first quarter of SLE
or an Introduction to the Human
ities course next fall.
Chew and Lim both said they
hope to graduate on time with
the rest of the Class of 2006. De
spite their difficulties, they ex
pect that students from Malaysia
will continue to matriculate at
colleges in the United States like
Stanford.
"There are juniors who are back
home and are applying to Ameri
can universities and will be coming
next fall. . . hopefully," Chew said.
After missing Stanford's fall
quarter enrollment deadline be
cause of delays in receiving their
student visas, three new interna
tional students arrived on campus
early this month to begin their
freshman years — freshman
years that only three months ago
they weren't sure they would ever
have because of the U.S. govern
ment crackdown on student visa
applications.
Like hundreds of other interna
tional students who had planned to
enroll in American universities last
fall but were not issued student
visas on time, Shameel Ahmad of
Pakistan and Zi Shen Lim and Hau
Jia Chew of Malaysia were forced to
defer enrollment fora quarter,
until their visa applications were
approved.
Post-Sept. 11 U.S. government
efforts to more thoroughly screen
student visa applicants — especial
ly males from predominantly Mus
lim countries — have caused de
lays in issuing visas. A process that
used to take only a matter of days
often now takes between six weeks
and as much as three months.
"I applied for my visa in mid-
July — I was told by the consular
officer interviewing me that new
background checks would take
longer to complete but that I

would definitely have my visa by
the end of August, 45 days from
the date of application," Ahmad
said. "1 finally got a phone call in
late November from them [saying
they had approved my applica
tion]. If I hadn't been approved by
that point in time, I probably
would have been forced to defer
another year, or drop out of Stan
ford altogether."
