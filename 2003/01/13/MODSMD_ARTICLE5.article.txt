# California Greens meet at Stanford
## Law School grad discusses his election to S. F.'s Board of Supervisors 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The California Green Party held its
quarterly plenary meeting this Satur
day and Sunday on the Stanford cam
pus. The 11-year-old party — which
continues to be dogged by perceptions
that Greens such as 2000 presidential
candidate Ralph Nader only take votes
from Democrats and are thus "spoil

year to comment on recent successes

Among the speakers at the meeting
was Matt Gonzales, a Stanford Law
School alumnus and Green Party
member who was elected president of
San Francisco's Board of Supervisors

Green Party," he said.
Gonzales also spoke favorably about
his time at the Law School.

Francisco's mayor, Gonzales comment

his presentation.

think that post-Nader, there was this
idea that the Greens were going to dis
appear."
During his speech, Gonzales also ex
pressed support for alternative energy
sources, which he identified as a Green
issue.
"I think the Greens have always
been seen to some extent as an envi
ronmental party," he said. "I don't
think [alternative energy technolo

essarily credited to the Greens, but
there is obvious kinship there, which
