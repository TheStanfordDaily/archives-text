# Prof offers final year of 'Sleep & Dreams'
## 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences Prof. William Dement will
teach his legendary Sleep and
Dreams class for the last time this
winter. In the 33 years he has of
fered the class, Dement has
taught over 10,000 students
about what he thinks may be the
No. 1 medical problem facing so
ciety today: sleep deprivation.
"The negative consequences
of pervasive sleep deprivation
and undiagnosed sleep disorders
are arguably the nation's largest,
deadliest and most costly health
problem, and at the same time,
the least viable," Dement wrote in
his "Requiem for Sleep and
Dreams."
He wrote the article after decid

ing eight months ago that this
would be his final year teaching
the class.
Dement is widely considered
to be one of the world's foremost
experts on sleep research. He has
devoted over half a century to re
searching, treating and educat
ing people about sleep and sleep
disorders. He founded and co
founded several organizations
such as the Sleep Research Soci
ety and American Academy of
Sleep Medicine, and opened
treatment clinics, including die
very first one, the Stanford Sleep
Clinic.
"Dr. Dement is a sleep crusad
er and is passionate about his
topic and his students," com
mented Michael Kives, a senior
who will serve as the head teaching
assistant for the course this quarter.
"He wants nothing more than for
every person in America, if not the
world, to appreciate the impor
tance of sleep in our daily lives."
Dement has been at Stanford
since 1963, when he came as an as
sociate professor of psychiatry. De
ment was very active in the civil
rights movement, and, after a
group of African-American stu
dents had persuaded Stanford to
allow a black theme house, Dement
was the only faculty member they
would accept as the resident fellow.
In 1970, Dement and his wife
moved into Cedro House with 45
black and 45 non-black freshmen.
"There was a lot of violence on
campus at the time," Dement ex
plained. "And I wanted to do all I
could to keep the freshmen in my
house safe."
It was with these intentions that
Dement began doing sleep experi
ments in the basement of Wilbur
Hall, where he set up a genuine
sleep laboratory with the students.
Dement taught the first Sleep and
Dreams class to the freshmen in his
dorm in the Cedro lounge several
times a week during fall quarter in
1970. As the quarter went on, stu
dents from other dorms started
corning, and the lounge began to
fill up.
Because of its rapidly growing
popularity, Dement announced
that he would teach an official Sleep
and Dreams class the following year
open to all undergraduates. To his
surprise, over 600 students en
rolled in the first class. Because the
popularity was so unexpected, De
ment had not reserved a large
enough lecture hall to accommo
date the crowd.
"The only place left was Memor
ial Church," Dement explained.
"Luckily, the dean of the chapel at
the time was nice enough to give me
permission to use the space."

And so Dement set out on his
Stanford Sleep crusade from the
pulpit.
"I only lectured from the pulpit
once ... It felt a little blasphemous,
and it was just as effective to talk
from the steps in front of the altar,"
he wrote in "Requiem for Sleep and
Dreams."
Through the 19705, Dement
kept a large following in the course,
enrolling 800 or 900 students every
year. However, as curriculum de
mands have increased over the
years, class size has diminished. In
recent years, enrollment has been
around 400. This year enrollment is
currently at 760, but Dement hopes
for even more to sign up.
The course has retained a large
following due to Dement's passion
ate and fun teaching style and
course structure. Dement uses
videos, slides, pictures, music and
guest lectures to keep his students
interested and entertained.
"This class was a party," said
sophomore Chelsea Maughan, who
took the class last year.
Sophomore Adam Ballew, who
also took the class last year, added,
"Dr. Dement is a complete nut.
.. but in a good way."
Ballew noted that one of the
class's attractions was its lack of aca
demic rigor.
"I would recommend this class
fora low-stress A'," he said.
Sophomore Sophie Larroque
cited Dement's expertise as another
major draw.
"You were being lectured about
material that Dement had re
searched and discovered himself,
and that made it all the more inter
esting," she noted.
Assignments and requirements
for the course include a sleep out
reach project in which students use
their knowledge about sleep disor
ders and deprivation to spread the
word through a variety of media.
The students also keep a sleep jour
nal and track their own progress on
reducing sleep debt.
In the past there have been
midterms and finals, but this year
students will be evaluated through

a series of online quizzes. Dement
holds hour-long lectures twice a
week and evaluates students with
the help of undergraduate TAs "in
an effort to incorporate former stu
dents into the administration of the
course," Kives explained.
One of the highlights of the class
is a visit from narcoleptic dogs,
which will be coming to class today.
Dement said it is not his inten
tion to overwhelm his students with
facts about sleep, but to make sure
that they retain the important
knowledge for the rest of their lives.
He thus works on emphasizing sev
eral concepts over and over again,
especially his slogan, "Drowsiness is
Red Alert!"
"There is an essential knowledge
base that should be delivered effec
tively to all human beings... What
is still completely overlooked and
neglected in our society is the essen
tial knowledge related to sleep," De
ment asserts in "Requiem for Sleep
and Dreams."

Sleep and Dreams is unique to
Stanford. While sleep disorders
may be briefly touched upon in
many psychology classes, an entire
class devoted to sleep and dreams is
a rarity. Dement reports that, while
classes may exist at other universi
ties, they are much smaller.
"1 doubt you'd find 50 [other
schools that offer classes devoted
exclusively to sleep]," Dement com
mented.
Explaining his decision to make
this his last quarter of teaching, De
ment said, "You've gotta quit some
time, don't you? I love the students,
and it was a very difficult decision
that I've been thinking about for
several years."
He explained that this year
seems a symbolic year for the end
of the class as 2003 marks the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of
rapid eye movement (REM) in
sleep, which he was involved in
while a student at the University of
Chicago.

Dement will continue to work in
the Stanford Medical School and
will continue traveling and lectur
ing.
"We are on to some very excit
ing things," Dement said. "No one
has ever done studies documenting
the effects of lowering your sleep
debt."
Although Dement would love to
have a replacement professor con
tinue to teach the course, he has dif
ficulty doing so.
"Stanford is so much a research
university that each professor has
an identity, and no one is eager to
carry on someone else's work."
Although Dement will not con
tinue to teach formally, he consid
ers himself a sleep educator wher
ever he goes and will work with peo
ple in a variety of fields.
"I am trying to do work with
truck drivers, pilots, lawyers and
other universities. ... I educate
whoever I can about sleep. Every lit
tle bit counts."
