On the Bth of March, 1421, the largest fleet the world had ever seen sailed from its base in
China. The ships, huge junks nearly five hundred feet long and built from the finest teak,
were under the command of Emperor Zhu Di's loyal eunuch admirals. Their mission was 'to
proceed all the way to the end of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond
the seas' and unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. The journey would last over
two years and circle the globe.
When they returned Zhu Di lost control and China was beginning its long, self-imposed
isolation from the world it had so recently embraced. The great ships rotted at their moor
ings and the records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost was the knowledge that Chinese
ships had reached America seventy years before Columbus and circumnavigated the globe
a century before Magellan. They had also discovered Antarctica, reached Australia three
hundred and fifty years before Cook and solved the problem of longitude three hundred
years before the Europeans.
Menzies, a former Royal Navy officer, traces the astonishing voyages of four fleets of junks
led by China's Emperor Zhu Di's admirals in 1421 to circle the entire globe. In this histor
ical detective story, Menzie presents his evidence that the Chinese were the first to discover
America, reach Australia 350 years before Cook, and chart the whole world by 1428.
