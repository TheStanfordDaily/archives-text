## Inspectors will need months in Iraq 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
Top weapons inspectors said yes
terday they need months to
search for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, but getting that time
may depend on whether Iraq
provides new evidence about its
nuclear, chemical and biological
programs.
Chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix
said Iraq must answer outstand
ing questions about its weapons
programs or may face the possibil
ity of war.
Blix said he and Mohamed El-
Baredi, director-general of the In
ternational Atomic Energy Agency,
will deliver this message to the Iraqi
government when they visit Bagh
dad on Sunday and yesterday.
"I think they only need look
around their borders and they
should realize the seriousness,"
Blix said in an interview with Asso
ciated Press Television News, al
luding to the huge U.S. military
buildup in the Persian Gulf and
neighboring Kuwait.
"We would hope fora peaceful
solution to this, and that inspection
can provide that," he said. "I think
also what the show of force demon
strates to Iraq is that here is the

other alternative."
Blix stressed the peaceful alter
native is a lot cheaper than war.
"We are perhaps 250 or 300
people on the inspection side. We

cost about $80 million a year. If
you take the armed path, you are
talking about $100 billion, you're
talking about 250,000 men, you're
talking about a lot of people killed

and injured, a lot of damage. So I
think the whole world prefers a
peaceful solution if you can have
one that is credible," Blix said.
He said those seeking peace in
clude President Bush and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Blix and Elßaradei said al
though Iraq has cooperated in
providing access to sites, it hasn't
provided the information inspec
tors need to verify its claim that it
has no banned weapons and long
range missiles to deliver them.
They reiterated that Iraq's 12,000-
page weapons declaration didn't
contain new evidence.
"There are a great many open
questions as to their possession of
weapons of mass destruction and
the Security Council and the
world would like to be assured
that these questions be sorted
out," Blix said.
Elßaradei said his inspectors
"still need a few months to achieve
our mission" but the time frame
will depend on Baghdad's willing
ness to supply documents, allow
U.N. inspectors to interview Iraqi
scientists and show physical evi
dence of what facilities and
weapons have been destroyed.

of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."
