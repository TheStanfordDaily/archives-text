# British PM Blair: Iraq must be disarmed

LONDON (AP) â€” Prime Minis
ter Tony Blair said yesterday Iraq
must be disarmed by force if it
doesn't rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction, declining to promise
he would resort to military means
only with U.N. approval.
Blair, President Bush's
staunchest ally on Iraq, is under
domestic pressure not to use force
unless U.N. arms inspectors find
evidence of Iraqi banned weapons
and the United Nations supports
an attack.

"Whatever happens, Saddam
will be disarmed," the prime min
ister said at a news conference.
"VVe have complete and total de
termination to do this. It's not con
flict that is inevitable, but disarma
ment is inevitable."
Blair said he believed the Unit
ed Nations would approve military
action if the inspectors found Sad
dam had violated a Security Coun
cil resolution, adopted Nov. 8,
which gave the Iraqi leader a last
chance to disarm.

But he suggested Britain and
America would not be stopped
from taking military action by any
member of the Security Council
putting an "unreasonable or uni
lateral block down on action."
"We can't be in a position where
we are confined in that way," he
said. "However, my own judgment
is that if there is a breach, then action
(by the council) will be authorized."
Blair said he was confident
U.N. weapons inspectors would
do a thorough job in Iraq, saying

the world must wait to see what
they find.
Opinion polls show the British
public is roughly equally divided
for and against war against Iraq.
International Development
Secretary Clare Short, one of the
most dovish Cabinet members,
said Sunday that Britain should
not join a military attack on Iraq
without U.N. authorization. She
said Britain had a duty to keep
America working within the
world body.
