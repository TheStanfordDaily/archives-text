# Bush likely against UMichigan policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
Bush administration is likely to
oppose a University of Michigan
program that gives preference
to minority students, officials
said yesterday night.
Such a step would inject Pres
ident Bush into the politically
explosive affirmative action de
bate at a time when the Republi
can Party is seeking support
from minorities.
White House and Justice De
partment lawyers, acting on
guidance from the president
himself, are drafting a proposed
Supreme Court brief arguing
against programs that gave
black and Hispanic students an
edge when applying to the Uni
versity of Michigan and its law
school, three senior administra
tion officials said.
Bush is awaiting those briefs
before deciding his course of ac
tion, the officials said, adding
that all signs point toward the
White House intervening in the
biggest affirmative action case in
a generation.
The lawyers intend to argue
that diversity can be achieved
through ways other than racial
preferences and quotas, draw
ing from Bush's record as Texas
governor and affirmative action
opinions drafted by the Clinton
White House, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
At the president's behest, de
liberations have been limited to
an unusually small circle of aides
at the White House and the of
fices of attorney general and so
licitor general.

Legal briefs opposing affir
mative action are due to the
court Thursday, and briefs sup
porting the Michigan admis
sions plans are due in February.
White House press secretary
Ari Fleischer said earlier yester
day that Bush was still reviewing
the matter.
"It can be one of any number
of decisions or no decision,"
Fleischer said.
The issue is a lightning rod
both for conservative voters,
who already back Bush, and for
minority voters, whom Republi
cans are courting.
Further complicating the
White House's decision is the fall
out for the GOP from the racially
provocative comments that cost
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., his job
as Senate majority leader. Bush
denounced Lott's remarks,
which were widely interpreted as
nostalgia for segregation.
Siding with white students so
soon after the Lott controversy
could be seen as an affront to
blacks.
"He is very sensitive to issues
involving race and giving op
portunities to people from a va
riety of backgrounds while also
giving opportunities in a man
ner for one and for all in our
country," Fleischer said.
The administration is not a
party to the Michigan fight and
does not have to take a position.
Traditionally, however, the
White House weighs in on po
tential landmark cases.
Aides said last week that
Bush was unlikely to sit on the
sidelines.
