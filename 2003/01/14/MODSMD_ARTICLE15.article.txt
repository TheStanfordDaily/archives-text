## The
						Stanford Daily County decision on trail debate a fair solution 
### 
Published Since 1891

When Stanford and the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors
agreed to the General Use Permit
two years ago, Stanford promised to build
two permanent, recreational trails. While
the Board of Supervisors' recent decision to
remove two trail routes (out of a possible
five) from a proposed list resulted in outcry
from local environmental groups, we feel
that the county made the right decision. De
spite the tension surrounding this issue, the
University should strengthen its efforts to
build a friendly and equitable relationship
with its surrounding county.
The county's decision is a wise one, be
cause the suggestion that Stanford should
spend $172,555 on supplemental environ
mental impact reports for the two rejected

trails is ridiculous, especially considering
the current economic downturn the Uni
versity is experiencing. All costs associated
with this project should not be excessive,
particularly in the wake of all the budget
cuts that Stanford will be forced to endure
in the near future.
Furthermore, the two trails in question
would have cut through the campus, and as
a consequence, Stanford would never be al
lowed to develop anything in those spots in
the future. Stanford should have some flexi
bility in order to address its expanding needs
as a research institution. While we agree with
the county's decision, we have some reserva
tions about the future of the relationship be
tween Stanford and the outside community.
This specific disagreement over the trails

could illuminate the need for more concilia
tion on both sides, and now is the time for in
creased communication and openness. The
University's new vice president of communi
ty relations, Gordon Earle, has already
begun work in this vein.
The Stanford Open Space Alliance and
other community activists' argument that the
University employed "bullying tactics" by
threatening to sue the county points to a
more subtle misunderstanding. (Stanford
spokesman Larry Horton later refuted
SOSA's assertion that the University ever
threatened the county with a lawsuit.) More
than anything, the dispute seems to present
itself as a power struggle that needs to be
watched in the future.
Stanford is in a very unique position in

that it exists as a private institution that also
makes up an integral part of the Peninsula.
Consequently, the University must make
decisions keeping in mind its responsibili
ties to both parties. While compromise is in
evitable in dealings of these sorts and not all
sides will be happy with the final outcome, it
is important that Stanford not alienate itself
from the surrounding communities. The
ability to maintain a working relationship
with the outside community should always
remain a high priority for Stanford officials.
With that said, Stanford's ultimate alle
giance should be to Stanford's best inter
ests. The University should be allowed the
final say in decisions being made concern
ing its land and its ability to develop that
land responsibly.
