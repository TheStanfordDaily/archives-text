# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Angsty in Palo Alto 
### 
I'm naturally a neurotic person, I
need the illusion of control in my life.
So when I feel the events surround
ing me spinning out of my control, I
really start to freak out.
I've only been back from vacation fora
week and already I feel like I need to hit the
pause button, take a break, step out of the
dorm fora week, get my head back togeth
er, and return with everything just as I left
it. I know I can't really stop everything right
now, and that just makes it worse.
My classes are already overwhelming,
even though I've only been to most of
them twice. I feel like I'm a week behind in
my work and two behind in my under
standing of the material. The teachers
seem less forgiving in spite of the fact that
I feel more like a freshman than I ever
have — lost, alone, adrift.
I tried to take this weekend off. I stayed
home from my dorm ski trip so I could be

alone — slept late (and in
my own bed) to finish re
covering from the martian
death flu (which turned
out to be strep), licked my
wounds from the past
week, and listened to real
ly loud music. Unfortu
nately none of that I
worked, because I felt all

my work and all my problems and every
thing looming over me, so I just wanted to
get it all done with so I could take a break,
but I'm so downcast that the work just isn't
getting done, and it's just getting to be a
more and more insurmountable obstacle,
and ifyou haven't figured out by the tension
being built up by this run-on sentence, I
can't decide ifl want to scream or cry.
I wonder if this is the "real" me. Angsty.
Depressed. Antisocial. Melodramatic and
conscious of it. That's the worst part. I
watch myself being a jerk, and I do noth
ing about it because it's easy. This all feels
comfortable — I've slipped into a pattern
from high school, and even if it's the
wrong thing to be doing right now, I just
don't have the physical and emotional
strength to do anything else.
I don't like this person. But it's been me
for so long; do I really have the power to
change it? I thought I did, but I'm not so
confident anymore.
It's easy like this. I don't need to deal
with the complexities of social interaction,
and I don't need to filter myself. I get all
the attention lavished on me because I'm
sitting alone in the dark in my room lis
tening to depressing music, and people
are worried about me. It's nice to know.
It's nice to feel. But I'm walking a danger
ous line, because, if I'm not careful, I'll
push all my friends away, and really con
vince them that I do want to sit alone and
mope. And it's not like I'm trying to feel
better. You never want to feel better when
you're depressed.
Why are we like this? Why do we like to
feel like this?

I'm trying to channel it into anger in
stead, but anger's bad too. It all comes
from fear, fear of being alone — it takes a
special kind of person to worry about
being alone at age 18.
As master Yoda says, "Fear is the path
to the dark side. Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffer
ing." As a result of all this fear and anger
and hate, I've realized a lifelong dream
of mine — a desire to hurt myself very
very badly.
No, actually, the hurt is just the conse
quence; the desire is to be an extreme
skater. Not necessarily a good one. I just
want to be able to grind a rail here and
there and jump a few steps. It's a wonder
ful channel for my aggression, jumping off
curbs, taking my anger out on the asphalt
as I land and feel my blades crunch be
neath me. Not the healthiest thing in the
world, I know, but fun.
I was so depressed this week that I
needed to watch "High Fidelity." No other
movie convinces me that my neurotic ten
dencies are more forgivable and that neu
rotic geeks can get the girl in the end. The
hero of the film, Rob Gordon, opens with
the best quote ever regarding music:
"What came first: the music or the mis
ery? [...] Did I listen to pop music because
I was miserable, or was I miserable be
cause I listened to pop music?"
That's the question I've been asking
myself all week. The music never makes us
feel better, so why listen to it?
At least the music lets us know that we're
not alone. Our problems aren't unique;
they're collective. We're not the first to ever
experience loss or longing or heartbreak,
and, at the same time, someone else, some
one famous and popular validates our pain.
I had my suffering personally validated this
week by Radiohead, raging and crying and
losing myself in the music.
This isn't healthy. I should be listening
to upbeat stuff. Not that I have any upbeat
music. As Rob so astutely observed, pop
music is never happy.
So much of my life is narrated by the
music in my head, because we all want our
lives to be more like a movie — to have a
plot, to make logical sense, to get to give
the big romantic speech and win the girl
— and a step in the right direction is to
give your life a soundtrack. But real life is
unscripted, and it just doesn't work out
like the movies.
I should be trying to get out of this funk
so I don't put myself in danger of screwing
up this quarter, but I'd rather crawl under
my covers and hope I don't follow in Rob's
footsteps, finding myself flunked out of
school and working in a record shop in
two months. Thanks for listening. 1 feel
better now. I hope anyone who's having a
crappy quarter feels better about it too.
