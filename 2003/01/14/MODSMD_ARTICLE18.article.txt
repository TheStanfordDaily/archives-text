It's time to reevaluate affirmative action
"University admissions offices are not
set up to sit in judgment on what injus
tices society should compensate for and
who should pay the price . . .We must
not admit some and thereby exclude
others because we arrogate to ourselves
the power to sort out who owes what to
whom" (Gerhard Casper, President of
Stanford University, Statement on Affir
mative Action, Oct. 4, 1995).
The factoring of race and ethnicity into
merit-based decisions on student admis
sions has been a staple of academic con
troversy for three decades. Students at
Stanford — no less than students at USC,
Harvard or the University of Michigan —
at some point ponder what it was that
uniquely qualified them for admission,
and inevitably they come across the ques
tion: Did my skin color give me a boost?
Likewise, rejected students wonder if their
same academic credentials would have
been enough given the added element of
a skin color more appealing to the admis
sions office.
The Supreme Court's recent decision
to reopen the affirmative action debate
by agreeing to rule on a challenge to the
University of Michigan's undergraduate
and law programs provides an oppor
tune time to look at the successes and
failures of the policy.
Stanford, long committed to "leveling
the playing field" (to quote again Gerhard
Casper's 1995 speech), maintains a Diver
sity and Access Office to oversee race
based policies.
The ASSU Senate in Nov. 2001 voted
13-0-2 to pass a resolution of support for
Stanford's affirmative action policies.
Thus, it is intriguing to review campus lit
erature on the matter.
The opening quote to this letter, sur

prisingly, draws from a pro-affirmative
action speech given by then-President
Casper.
Casper conceded that affirmative ac
tion introduces arbitrary decision-making
by admissions officers who believe them
selves imbued with the moral legitimacy to
legislate societal change in redressing his
torical oppression of certain groups.
Casper too, however, continues to
believe in the moral-legislative capacity
of academic bureaucrats, a belief that
led him to embrace affirmative action
to facilitate "diversity" among students
and faculty.
Preferential treatment is on face, how
ever, as racist as many historical wrongs
themselves. Talk of "leveling the playing
field" assumes the ability and intent of a
handful of bureaucrats to engage in a feat
of societal engineering.
However, as David Sacks and Peter
Thier pointed out in a 1996 Stanford
Magazine article entitled "The Case
Against Affirmative Action," empirical
studies demonstrate that, rather than
benefiting "disadvantaged students," af
firmative action simply helps minorities
from middle- and upper-class back
grounds. Thus, minority students un
derperforming because of deficient sec
ondary schools receive no solace, and
numerous qualified students are reject
ed on arbitrary terms.
I write this letter as an appeal not to
pathos but to data. If Stanford, like other
schools, has not managed in three
decades to "level the playing field," how
can we assume it will ever succeed in
doing so? Moreover, even assuming the
best intentions on the part of admissions
officers, how can we rationally expect
fairness to result from an admissions pol
icy that begs bureaucrats to employ their
own biases with not only impunity but

sacrosanct legitimacy?

Stanford is 'not a country dub'
In reading about the new "schedule ad
justment aimed at addressing student com
plaints about weekend waste accumulation
in dorms across campus," I was appalled
("Dorm custodians to work weekends," Jan.
8). Stanford students are upset about the ac
cumulation of garbage in their residences,
and therefore the University has decided
that the custodial staff will work extra days.
Let's keep it real. There are way too
many spoiled Stanford students whose
parents did not teach them proper
manners, and therefore, we will get the
custodians (who are almost always peo
ple of color) to clean up after these
privileged brats.
Because some Stanford students be
lieve they are too busy "working hard" on
their academics or they think they are
above taking their own trash out and
picking up a few pieces of paper and a few
beer cans off the ground, the University
has asked that the underpaid manual la
borers of our school take the little time
they have to spend with their families to
come clean up after us.
I thought Stanford was a university for
the most talented students in the world,
not a country club in which class (and
racial) stereotypes and ideologies become
reified and ultimately institutionalized.
Stanford would be better off investing its
money in educating its student body about
some basic manners and respect.
