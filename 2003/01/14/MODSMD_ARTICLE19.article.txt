# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Why there is no justice in capital punishment 
### EVA ST. CLAIR GUEST COLUMNIST 
It is unfortunate that Jaime Cundiff
wrote her guest column ("An argu
ment for the death penalty," Jan. 8)
without bothering to research her
topic. If she had, she might not have relied
so heavily on arguments that refute,
rather than support, her claim that the
United States should use capital punish
ment as a just deterrent to crime.
Furthermore, by using a sensationalist
figure such as Osama bin Laden as her
main example of someone who warrants
the death penalty, Cundiff draws conclu
sions with frightening implications for the
average world citizen.
But rather than focus on her article's
obvious shortcomings, it is more impor
tant to examine the philosophical ques
tions surrounding the death penalty. After

all, none of us at Stanford really need to be
reminded what would become of society
should the United States suddenly revoke
its citizens' right to a jury trial, or shift the
burden of proof to the defendant. Nor
does it take much imagination to surmise
what would happen internationally if all
countries followed CundifFs suggestion to
execute foreign citizens on their most
wanted list "on site."
It is not even particularly relevant to
address the pragmatic aspects of the
death penalty, which Cundiff uses as her
main support for the practice. A look at
capital punishment statistics in the United
States easily refutes those arguments —
crime rates are higher in states with capi
tal punishment, there is significant racial
bias in prosecuting and sentencing crimi
nals (79 percent of federal death row in
mates are African Americans), and the
higher cost of execution ($3 million) ver
sus cost of life imprisonment ($600,000)

are all on the con-side of death penalty ar
guments. And if Cundiff were to visit a
maximum-security prison, it would
quickly become obvious to her that the
prisoners kept there are not going to "es
cape and come after" her anytime soon.
Finally, I hope she is as appalled as I am
by the number of innocent people (at least
400) who have been executed by the Unit
ed States in the last 200 years.
What is truly disturbing about Cun
difFs article is her notion that the death
penalty is a positive good for society by
providing closure to the victims and sat
isfying "man's natural desire for justice."
If these are the only criteria necessary to
call for the death penalty, then we are all
in big trouble.
From a modern, cultural-relativist
view, laws only reflect what the majori
ty of a group of people find socially re
pugnant. This means that pretty soon,
"man" might desire justice for any be

havior offensive to the majority (or
even just a few particularly powerful
people) of a particular group. You
could be executed for just about any
thing — even something as seemingly
innocuous as chewing gum or reading a
newspaper. (Note: This has happened
in the past! Please take a history class to
learn more).
In the grand scheme of things, all
governments have only one main pur
pose: to protect the lives of their citizens.
As soon as the government has the
power to take away life, it has voided the
purpose of its existence. If you have
nothing else, at least you can rest as
sured that no one, especially not the
state, can kill you with impunity.
The right to life is the only right that
we should never, never compromise —
not for the sake of medicine, not for the
sake of population control, not for the
sake of anyone else's personal living

choices, and absolutely not for the sake
of safety. The death penalty falls into the
latter category — you think you are safer
with offenders being put to death? Stop
kidding yourself. Each execution stops a
small-time murderer, but a much
stronger, much more powerful, and vir
tually immortal serial killer has simply
struck again. Anyone living under a gov
ernment should be constantly vigilant to
eradicate activities that allow either the
government or private citizens to decide
when life should end.
Rather than prove itself to be the
world-wide bully Cundiff envisions, the
United States should meekly and
humbly follow the majority of other civi
lized nations and curse capital punish
ment for the crime it is.
