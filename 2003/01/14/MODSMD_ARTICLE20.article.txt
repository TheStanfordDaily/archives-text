# Budget cuts claim Freshman Book; directors hope to bring it back in future
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a result of recent budget cuts,
this year's freshman class won't re
ceive a gift from the Introduction to
the Humanities Program as part of
the Freshman Book Program.
I-Hum instituted the program
in 1998 as a two-part gift to all mem
bers of the incoming class. In the
fall, freshmen received a book or
film by an author who comes to
Stanford to address the class in the
winter quarter.
Past texts have been Middle Pas
sage, by Charles Johnson; Arcadia,
by Tom Stoppard; The Woman
Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood
Among Ghosts, by Maxine Hong
Kingston; and a collection of four
films by Errol Morris.
"I'm really disappointed we
couldn't do it this year," said Rob
Robinson, the program's director.
"We hope it will come back when fi
nancial times get better."
Associate Director Cheri Ross
stressed that the program isn't can

celed — it has just been "placed on
the back burner."
The program's goal, as she ex
plained it, was to "bring students
into contact with a living artistic per
son."
She emphasized the program's
role as an extracurricular activity.
"While it's great if a couple of
classes are studying the book the au
thor has come to discuss, our aim
isn't to integrate the books or videos
into every I-Hum curriculum," Ross
said. "We want the program to be
something separate. And the book
we choose has to be engaging —
something die students will pick up
again."
Director Rob Robinson said he
viewed the program as a potentially
unifying experience for freshmen.
"It would be great if it turns into
something they can share with each
other years from now, something
that helps create a class identity,"
Robinson said.
While some students griped
about the program's lack of rele
vance, most enjoyed their gifts and

the chance to meet a famous author.
"It's a really worth while program
— a neat way to get people think
ing," sophomore Ross Perlin siiid.
"It's worth keeping anything that
encourages intellectual exploration
outside of class without giving a
grade," Perlin continued. "That's
what college is all about."
Junior Nick Chan agreed that
the program served an important
purpose.
"It's a unifying thing. It gives
people something to talk about as a
whole class," Chan said. "And if it
does nothing else, it encourages
people to read another book."
Ross and Robinson are eager to
receive feedback from students
about the program. There's a
place on the I-Hum Web site
where they can nominate books:
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/
undergrad/areaone/freshman
book.html.
"We're still looking for sugges
tions even though the program's
not on right now," Robinson said.
"Please don't lose hope!"
