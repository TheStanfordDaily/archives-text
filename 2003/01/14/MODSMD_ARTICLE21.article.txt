## Arizona, Cal remain at the top of Pac-10 
### JACOB SAPERSTEIN STAFF WRITER 
Two weeks into the Pacific-10 Conference season,
and the conference already has manifested itself into
two separate groups.
The top five teams — Arizona, Arizona State, Ore
gon, California and Stanford — all have double-digit
win totals. All five schools are in strong contention for
the Pac-10 title, as well as a high seed in the NCAA
tournament.

PAC-10 NOTEBOOK

After these five, the teams in the bottom half of the
conference appear to be merely competing for upsets
or NIT bids. UCLA, Southern California, Washing
ton, Washington State and Oregon State have all had
problems so far this season.
When the Pac-10 season started last week, Oregon
(10-4, 1 -3 Pac-10) was expected to be the primary chal
lenger to front-runner Arizona (11-1, 4-0) for the Pac
-10 title. However, after the Ducks came to the Bay Area
and were crushed by both the Bears and the Cardinal
this past weekend, Oregon is going to have to play per
fect basketball to push the Wildcats. The Ducks were
outplayed by both schools, illustrating their lack of in
side presence. Suddenly, one of the best teams in the
conference is going to have to fight for its life.
The Wildcats also learned that you can't take any
one for granted. Illustrating the strength of the worst
conference teams, Arizona was pushed by the Wash
ington schools.
The Wildcats were able to escape undefeated in
early conference play, defeating the Cougars 82-69
and the Huskies 79-61. Ail-American forward Luke
Walton returned to the court after being sidelined
with a high ankle sprain, giving Arizona another of
fensive weapon. This weekend, the Wildcats travel
south to Los Angeles to play the struggling Southern
California schools.
Both USC and UCLA had a very difficult week
end. On Wednesday, UCLA (4-7,2-1) lost to the Tro
jans at Pauley Pavilion for the first time in 10 years.
The Bruins lost at home again on Saturday, drop
ping to St. Johns 80-65. UCLA has been disappoint
ing all season, losing to both San Diego and Northern
Arizona early in the year.
Head coach Steve Lavin is now on the hot seat, as
reports of his firing have been spreading throughout
Westwood. It's imminent for the Bruins, as confer
ence heavyweights Arizona and Arizona State come
to Pauley this weekend.
Across town the Trojans are in the midst of a re
building year. Even though they defeated the Bru
ins, USC (6-5, 2-1) has had its share of bad losses,
falling to Santa Barbara and Washington.
This weekend, the Trojans were embarrassed at
home by Ivy League power Pennsylvania, 99-61. The
Trojans' defense was destroyed as the Quakers shot
87 percent in the first half.
While USC and UCLA have been experiencing

down years, Arizona State (11-4, 3-1) is having one of
its best seasons in recent memory. The Sun Devils are
led by true freshman Ike Diogu, who tops the team in
both points and rebounds. Behind his strong post
play, Arizona State crushed Washington and Wash
ington State, 89-57 and 96-55, respectively. Now,
after years of sitting near the bottom of the confer
ence rankings, the Sun Devils have risen to the top

and are competing for the Pac-10 title.
California (10-2, 3-0) has also used strong post
play to push toward the top heap of the Pac-10. De
spite losing key players in the offseason, the Golden
Bears are playing great team basketball.

Senior guard Julius Barnes pushes past an Oregon State defender in Thursday's game. The Cardinal and California
each swept the Oregon schools this weekend.
Tamir, the Bears have crushed
teams inside. This weekend, the
pair combined for 27 points as the
Bears upset Oregon, 88-72.
Cal also beat Oregon State (7-6,
0-4) 78-73 to remain undefeated
in Pac-10 play. Cal's two losses
have both come against strong op
ponents — a five-point game to
Georgia and a 13-point defeat at
the hands of then-No. 19 Kansas.
