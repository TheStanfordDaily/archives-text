If the Cardinal's results from
the tournament are any indica
tion, this could be a long MPSF
season.
Stanford (2-2) went 1-2 at
UCSB, finishing sixth in the field
after losing to Long Beach State (2-
1)3-1 in the consolation final on
Saturday.
The Cardinal landed in the
loser's bracket after an opening
round loss to eventual champion
UC-Irvine (5-0) on Friday, but re
bounded with a four-game win
over Pacific early Saturday.
Senior outside hitter Curt Top
pel, a three-time Ail-American, led

the team in kills in all three match
es en route to a position on the All-
Tournament Team.
The Cardinal, which entered as
the invitational's second seed,
started the weekend well, pulling
out a 30-28 win over Irvine in the
opening game of Friday's match.
But despite 18 kills from Top
pel, Stanford gave up the next
three games to the Anteaters,
who improved to a school-record
5-0 start after their champi
onship this weekend. Irvine
cruised through the last three
sets 30-27, 30-24, 30-24.
Moving into the consolation
bracket, the Cardinal was pitted
against familiar rival Pacific in its
first match Saturday morning.
Stanford met the Tigers twice in
preseason competition at the
Husky Dino Cup in Calgary in Oc
tober, splitting the matches.
Two months later, and just a
week before the advent of the
MPSF season, Stanford took the
edge in the series, defeating Pacif
ic 30-32, 30-22, 30-22, 30-27.
"We had a chance to take a look
at some of the other teams in the
conference this weekend," said
Stanford coach Don Shaw. "This
was a strong tournament and
every team put their best lineup on

the floor. After we started out slow
against UC-lrvine, we came back
and played pretty well against Pa
cific."
In addition to 16 kills by Top
pel, senior middle blocker Paul
Bocage and sophomore middle
blocker Craig Buell each picked
up 13 kills.
The win over the Tigers put
Stanford in the fifth-place game
against Long Beach State on Sat
urday afternoon.
The Cardinal battled the 49ers
tightly throughout the first game,
finally falling by a narrow 33-31
margin.
Stanford came back to take the

second game, 30-25, and led early
in the third before falling 30-27.
That took the wind out of the
Cardinal's sails, as Long Beach
pulled out the eventual match win,
recording a 30-24 victory in the
fourth game.
" This match was a real battle,"
Shaw said. "We made some mis
takes at key times, especially when
we had a chance to win in the third
game. The match could have gone
either way."
Toppel completed his superb
weekend with 19 kills in the match,
with senior outside hitter William
Strickland and Bocage chipping in
12 and 11 kills, respectively.
The Cardinal opens up confer
ence action this weekend at Burn
ham Pavilion with matches against
Brigham Young on Friday and
Saturday.
