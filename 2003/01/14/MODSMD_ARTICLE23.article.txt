### MAISY SAMULESON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Free throws were all that separated No. 5 Stanford
and No. 18 Arizona from two other top teams in the Pa
cific-10 Conference this week.
On Saturday, Nicole Powell drained two free throws
with 1.3 second remaining to propel the Cardinal (12-
1,4-0 Pac-10) to a 75-74 win over Oregon (6-9, 2-4).

PAC-10 NOTEBOOK

Meanwhile Arizona's Aimee Gryzb and Dee Dee
Wheeler each missed free throws down the stretch as the
Wildcats (10-4,4-2) fell 60-59 to Washington (12-2,4-1).
Against Stanford, Oregon — playing without lead
ing scorer Cathrine Kraayeveld, who is out for five
weeks with a staph infection in her knee — came back
from a 15-point second-half deficit to take a 74-73 lead
with 1.3 seconds left.
Stanford sophomore T'Nae Thiel launched a per
fect full-court pass over the defense to junior Nicole
Powell, who was intentionally tackled by Kedzie Gun
derson to prevent an easy layup. Powell sank both free
throws in front of a raucous crowd at McArthur Court
to preserve the victory. Thiel hit a crucial 3-pointer
down the stretch and finished with 18 points.
On Thursday, Stanford had less trouble dispatching
Oregon State 51-62 behind Chelsea Trotter's career
high 17 points. Sophomore Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
sophomore Susan King and Powell rounded out Stan
ford's balanced scoring attack with 10 points each.
Before its heart-breaking loss to the Cardinal, Ore
gon ended a two-game losing streak with a tight 70-67
victory over California on Thursday. Neither team led
by more than six points, and there were nine lead
changes in the second half alone.
Again, free throws were the difference as Ducks ju
nior Kyla Steen went 5-for-6 from the line in the final
30 seconds to preserve die win for Oregon.
The Golden Bears had a chance to take the lead with
40 seconds left, but Nihan Anaz, who scored a game
high 22 points, missed a wide-open 3-pointer. For the
first time in six games, Oregon was not outrebounded
by its opponent.
Oregon State also ended a four-game losing streak
with a 68-37 defeat of Cal on Saturday.
The Beavers ran off 16 straight points to start the
second half until the Golden Bears finally scored a free
throw with 11:49 remaining to pull within 20 points.
Cal missed its first 12 field-goal attempts and recorded
only four baskets during the entire second half.
Behind Brina Chaney's 13 points and 13 rebounds,
and 12 points a piece from Hollye Chapman and
Leilani Estavan, die Beavers shot a season-best 52 per
cent from the floor while holding Bears to 22-percent
shooting for the game.
Emotional Huskies extend Pac-10 streak
It has been an emotional start to 2003 for Washington.
On New Year's Eve sophomore
guard Kayla Burt suffered a near
death episode before being revived
by quick-thinking teammates who
performed CPR.
Buit was diagnosed with Long
Q-T Syndrome, a rare genetic elec
trical disorder that causes heartbeat
irregularities. She underwent
surgery to have an automatic defib
rillator implanted in the right side
of her chest that will allow her to live
a normal life, but her basketball ca
reer is over.
Before falling ill, Burt averaged
eight points and 3.7 rebounds and
led the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting
percentage (.538) and assist-to
turnover ratio (3.42).
An emotionally charged Huskies
team has won its last three games,
including a stunning 60-59 upset
over Arizona on Saturday night to
remain a perfect 7-0 at home.
"You saw the kids surrounding
Kayla. They're playing for her, and
it's an awesome thing," Washington
head coach June Daugherty told re
porters.
Washington trailed by as many
as 11 points in the second half
against the Wildcats, but rallied
with tough denial defense against
two-time Pac-10 Player of the
Week Shawntinice Polk in the
post.
"Defense, defense, defense. I
mean we got the stops we needed
to get back in the second half.
With what energy we had left out
there the kids definitely put it to
the defensive end," Daugherty
said.
Kristen O'Neill, who had a ca

reer-high 17 points and nine re
bounds, put back a missed shot
with two seconds remaining to give
Washington a one-point victory.
Arizona's Grzyb and Wheeler
both clanked foul shots in the final
30 seconds that would have sealed
the win for the Wildcats.
Wildcats exploit Washington State
Arizona's bountiful offense had
an easier time against lowly Wash
ington State on Thursday. With
four starters reaching double fig
ures (Wheeler 20, Grzyb 18, Polk
16, Krista Warren 12), the Wildcats
extended the Cougars' losing
streak to 36.
Despite a slew of turnovers in the
first half, Arizona held a 39-25 lead
at the break and never looked back,
extending its lead to 31 points with
4:16 left.
Head coach Joan Bonvicini
spread around the minutes gener
ously and had at least four fresh
men on the floor at any time during
the final five minutes.
UCLA rallies behind Greco
With a 64-72 victory over cross
town rival USC (6-10, 1-4), UCLA
(10-4, 5-0) won its sixth consecutive
game and remained undefeated in
the Pac-10.
Pac-10 Player of the Week
Michelle Greco scored 28 points
and pulled in seven rebounds in the
victory.
After trailing by 13 points with
7:24 remaining in the second half,
the Women of Troy pulled within
one point at 65-64 with 1:14 to go
before Greco put the game away
with a driving 3-point play.
Greco's 12-for-12 performance
from the line, including four free
throws in the final minute, tied a
school record.
