Free throws were all that separated No. 5 Stanford
and No. 18 Arizona from two other top teams in the Pa
cific-10 Conference this week.
On Saturday, Nicole Powell drained two free throws
with 1.3 second remaining to propel the Cardinal (12-
1,4-0 Pac-10) to a 75-74 win over Oregon (6-9, 2-4).

PAC-10 NOTEBOOK

Meanwhile Arizona's Aimee Gryzb and Dee Dee
Wheeler each missed free throws down the stretch as the
Wildcats (10-4,4-2) fell 60-59 to Washington (12-2,4-1).
Against Stanford, Oregon — playing without lead
ing scorer Cathrine Kraayeveld, who is out for five
weeks with a staph infection in her knee — came back
from a 15-point second-half deficit to take a 74-73 lead
with 1.3 seconds left.
Stanford sophomore T'Nae Thiel launched a per
fect full-court pass over the defense to junior Nicole
Powell, who was intentionally tackled by Kedzie Gun
derson to prevent an easy layup. Powell sank both free
throws in front of a raucous crowd at McArthur Court
to preserve the victory. Thiel hit a crucial 3-pointer
down the stretch and finished with 18 points.
On Thursday, Stanford had less trouble dispatching
Oregon State 51-62 behind Chelsea Trotter's career
high 17 points. Sophomore Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
sophomore Susan King and Powell rounded out Stan
ford's balanced scoring attack with 10 points each.
Before its heart-breaking loss to the Cardinal, Ore
gon ended a two-game losing streak with a tight 70-67
victory over California on Thursday. Neither team led
by more than six points, and there were nine lead
changes in the second half alone.
Again, free throws were the difference as Ducks ju
nior Kyla Steen went 5-for-6 from the line in the final
30 seconds to preserve die win for Oregon.
The Golden Bears had a chance to take the lead with
40 seconds left, but Nihan Anaz, who scored a game
high 22 points, missed a wide-open 3-pointer. For the
first time in six games, Oregon was not outrebounded
by its opponent.
Oregon State also ended a four-game losing streak
with a 68-37 defeat of Cal on Saturday.
The Beavers ran off 16 straight points to start the
second half until the Golden Bears finally scored a free
throw with 11:49 remaining to pull within 20 points.
Cal missed its first 12 field-goal attempts and recorded
only four baskets during the entire second half.
Behind Brina Chaney's 13 points and 13 rebounds,
and 12 points a piece from Hollye Chapman and
Leilani Estavan, die Beavers shot a season-best 52 per
cent from the floor while holding Bears to 22-percent
shooting for the game.
