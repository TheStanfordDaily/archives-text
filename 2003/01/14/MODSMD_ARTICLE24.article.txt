## 
### JESSICA PETERS 
Any Stanford women's swim
meet that includes a triumph for
junior Tara Kirk in the 100-yard
breaststroke, a pair of wins for
freshman Kristen Caverly, and a
team victory for the Cardinal can
be summed up in two words: no
surprise.

Women's Swimming
m
Saturday: No. 4 Stanford 139,
Pacific 123

Pacific did everything it could
to overtake the No. 4 Stanford
squad, but as predicted by head
coach Richard Quick, his team had
a bit too much talent to be defeat
ed this weekend. ITie Cardinal (4-
1) claimed victory in eight of 14
events to sweep past the Tigers (9-
5) 139-123.
Along the way, Tara Kirk
picked up her 20th collegiate win
the in 100 breaststroke, continu
ing her impressive unbeaten
streak.
Tara Kirk kicked off the meet
by teaming up with junior Megan
Baumgartner, sophomore Tami
Ransom, and her sister freshman
Dana Kirk to win the 200-yard
medley relay. Tara Kirk also fin
ished second in the 100-yard but
terfly to round out the day.

Freshman Kristen Caverly con
tinued her excellent season, clock
ing in at 1 minute, 55.44 seconds
to win the 200-yard freestyle. She
also claimed victory in the 200
breaststroke with a time of 2:17.27.
Caverly joined Baumgartner
and sophomores Lacey Boutwell
and Evins Cameron to finish sec

2:04.38 to gain a win in the 200-
yard individual medley, and also
placed second in the 200 free, be

The distance freestyle events
are a notorious weak spot for the
Cardinal, and despite a Tiger
sweep of the 500 free, Cameron
pulled out a win in the 1,000-yard
free with a time of 10:09.42. Stan
ford also took third in the event
with freshman Anna Strohl's per
formance.
Strohl recorded her first win in
NCAA competition in the 200-
yard butterfly, with a time of
2:05.10. She was followed in third
place by freshman teammate
Laura Davis.
Baumgartner and Boutwell
also placed in the sprint freestyle
events for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal team took the top
two spots in the 100 back, as
Boutwell and sophomore Amy
Wagner recorded times of 56.88
and 57.76, respectively. In addi
tion, with her third-place time of
2:06.40, Wagner was the only
Stanford swimmer to place in the
200 back.

elude a set of wins for Lyndsay Mc-
Namee in the 50 and 100 free, a
victory in the 200-freestyle relay
and three other individual first
place finishes.
