# Even the most manly men are humbled on the slopes
## 
### 
There are few experiences more
humbling than stepping onto
the ski slope as a novice in either
skiing or snowboarding. I had
the unique opportunity of experiencing
this firsthand this weekend as 1 accompa
nied (ok, crashed) one of the Stanford
dorm's trips to Tahoe this weekend.
Given that it is only my second time
snowboarding in my life, I realize the limi
tations in my true snowboarding ability.
However, once I get on the mountain and
my testosterone starts flowing, the fine line
between realization of my limitations and
acceptance of them becomes more blurry
than White House foreign policy. Without
fail, the second I am confronted with even
the possibility of an attractive fellow snow
bunny, I immediately assume that the la
tent Alberto Tomba in me will shine
through, and I will dazzle her with a feat of
gravity-defying majesty.
However, it is also without fail that my
giant slalom tendencies always result in
some sort of bodily harm to me or to those
with the unfortunate circumstance to be
within a 20-foot radius of me when I hap
pen upon an attractive skier.
I have hit trees, rocks and small chil-

dren, all without doing
any serious injury to my
self or being brought up
on charges that could be
proved beyond reasonable
doubt. But even this week
end, I still find myself re
sorting to divers acts of
machismo and daring-do
whenever 1 feel the situa-

tion calls for it — and to me, the situation
calls for it whenever women are present,
someone double-dog dares me to do it, or
when someone direcdy in front of me does
it and makes it look easy.
To a man, especially a man who consid
ers himself to be a fairly good athlete in his
own right, watching four-year-old kids
and sixty-year-old women fly by you on
the mountain, ask you if you need help
after you've just face-planted yet again, or
offer to keep you conscious until ski patrol
arrives is too much of an affront to one's
manliness to allow the situation to go un
challenged.
So, with litde regard to my personal
safety, I accept the challenges set forth by
random strangers, I defy the meager ex
pectations of passers-by, and I throw cau

tion to the wind. I can, and I will, own this
mountain.
It's funny how the best of intentions
never quite turn out how you expect them
to. I have yet to land an aerial jump that in
turn has landed me the girl, but I do have
several million dead brain cells who wish I
would havejust stayed home and hit myself
over the head with a baseball bat rather
than murder them by slamming them into
the ice. I have yet to prove to anyone that I
am more of a man by going down a double
black diamond run, but I have two
sprained wrists and countless bruises that
have almost assuredly challenged reduced
my manly stature. And I have yet to prove
to a small child that "anything you can do I
can do better," but I'm taller than at least a
good two-thirds of those ungrateful bas
tards, and I'll always have that.
I think snow sports are a good metaphor
for life being fair. In snow sports, the meek
— little kids, old women and even the oc
casional dorky guy with one of those Dumb
and Dumber style singlet ski uniforms —
inherit the mountain, while the big guys
who spent way too much time on football
and weightlifting fall on their faces repeat
edly. In snow sports, small Finnish chil

dren can be faster than Americans, and
Norwegians can get higher than Ja
maicans.
But whatever they are, snow sports are a
source of endless hours of entertainment
for those who are actually good enough to
enjoy them without fear of imminent
death. And if nothing else, they provide
countless numbers of Stanford students
with excused absences from abhorred
classes.
And let's not forget the debauchery of
the dorm ski trip, which is a column in itself
(well, it would be if I went to any college ex
cept Stanford. But since I do, debauchery
is usually limited to some drunk guy hitting
on some girl in his dorm, and that girl call
ing him "sketchy" for daring to talk to her).
But most importantly, snow sports pro
vide a valuable bonding experience for
many diverse groups of people, as long as
you have little to no expectation that diver
sity will comprise more than affluent white
families with little kids and lots of SUVs.
