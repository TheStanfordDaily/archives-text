# Students turn to private loans
## 
### VINAY JAIN 
As federal loan programs fail to
keep pace with the soaring cost of
higher education, many American
families are turning to private loans
to pay for college. But not all private
loans are created equal, and the
reputation of Stanford students as
low-risk borrowers may be helping
them get favorable terms.
The Stanford Financial Aid Of
fice offers a private loan called
Guaranteed Access to Education
(GATE), run joindy by the Massa
chusetts-based First Marblehead
Corporation and the Bank of
America.
According to Director of Student
Awards Ron Diaz, Stanford was
able to obtain special terms for the
GATE based on the borrowing
record of its students. The loan has
no processing or "origination" fee,
unlike some private loans.

"Other schools may have origi
nation fees, but we were able to ne
gotiate having no fee on it, because
the default rate on other student
loans at Stanford has been quite
low," Diaz said. "The students who
take loans here generally pay them
back, which means Stanford is a low
credit risk."
John Brady, a vice president at
First Marblehead Corporation, said
that although low default rates are
one factor in determining a univer
sity's private loan terms, there are
many others. These include how
much students borrow, whether a
university backs its students' loans,
and a university's bond rating.
Brady said it's difficult to assess
the loan risk a university's students
represent based on any one factor
alone.
"It's sort of like asking which is a
better pizza, thin crust or deep
dish," Brady said. "Well, it de

pends. Who made it? Where did it
come from? What are the ingredi
ents?"
According to the College Board,
which administers the SAT, the av
erage tuition and fees for four-year
private universities has increased
by 38 percent over the past 10
years, rising to $18,273. But the
government's main loan program,
the Stafford loan, has continued
since 1992 to offer undergraduates
no more than a total of $23,000 â€”
causing more families to turn to
private borrowing.
Although private loans often
allow students to borrow more,
they carry greater risk. Unlike most
federal loans, their interest rates are
variable and uncapped.
The current interest rate on the
GATE loan is 4.76 percent, and
there is no cap. The rate is subject to
change every six months, and stu
dents have up to 13 years to pay it
back. Stanford places a $5,000 bor
rowing limit for undergraduates
using the GATE. Because interest
rates are at historically low levels,
some students may overlook the
importance of interest rate caps, ac
cording to Diaz. He said the Finan
cial Aid Office is sensitive to this pos
sibility and cautions students not to
take out any more private loans
than they need.
"That's the first thing we bring
up," Diaz said. "You have to be
careful about it. With the GA TE, we
tell students that if they don't have
to take all 13 years to pay, they can
pay earlier. I don't have my crystal
ball to tell me what's going to hap

pen in the future."
Diaz noted that most Stanford
students don't need private loans,
since the University offers grants
and subsidized loans to students
with a demonstrated financial
need. In 2001-02, $78 million was
given out in grants and $ 11 million
in loans.
Sophomore Lauren Casey said
she is happy with her financial aid
award and has not needed to take
out private loans.
"My package was great. It took
care of almost all my family's bur
den. I'm taking out loans, but
they're all subsidized, so my debt
won't be too much of a burden
when I graduate," she said.
In 2001-02, only 350 Stanford
undergraduates used GATE loans.
Forty-one percent received need
based scholarships.
Stanford undergraduates have
also benefited from a decrease in

the amount of self-help required in
the past five years.
In 1998-99, Stanford required
students to pay back up to $6600 of
their financial aid award through
jobs and student loans. Today, that
amount is $5250, widi the differ
ence awarded in gi ants.
Outside awards below $5250 do
not reduce a student's financial aid.
Stanford allows students to use out
side awards to pay down their self
help quota. However, any award
above that amount is deducted
from a student's grants.
Junior Nathalie Cassidy said
that while she considers her award
to be fair, she thinks Stanford's fi
nancial aid system could be made
simpler.
"I don't really have to worry
about money thanks to my package,
but I really think the system is too
complicated," she said. "It's some
tiling that's too easy to mess up."
