# Students turn to private loans

### VINAY JAIN 
As federal loan programs fail to
keep pace with the soaring cost of
higher education, many American
families are turning to private loans
to pay for college. But not all private
loans are created equal, and the
reputation of Stanford students as
low-risk borrowers may be helping
them get favorable terms.
The Stanford Financial Aid Of
fice offers a private loan called
Guaranteed Access to Education
(GATE), run joindy by the Massa
chusetts-based First Marblehead
Corporation and the Bank of
America.
According to Director of Student
Awards Ron Diaz, Stanford was
able to obtain special terms for the
GATE based on the borrowing
record of its students. The loan has
no processing or "origination" fee,
unlike some private loans.

"Other schools may have origi
nation fees, but we were able to ne
gotiate having no fee on it, because
the default rate on other student
loans at Stanford has been quite
low," Diaz said. "The students who
take loans here generally pay them
back, which means Stanford is a low
credit risk."
John Brady, a vice president at
First Marblehead Corporation, said
that although low default rates are
one factor in determining a univer
sity's private loan terms, there are
many others. These include how
much students borrow, whether a
university backs its students' loans,
and a university's bond rating.
Brady said it's difficult to assess
the loan risk a university's students
represent based on any one factor
alone.
"It's sort of like asking which is a
better pizza, thin crust or deep
dish," Brady said. "Well, it de

pends. Who made it? Where did it
come from? What are the ingredi
ents?"
According to the College Board,
which administers the SAT, the av
erage tuition and fees for four-year
private universities has increased
by 38 percent over the past 10
years, rising to $18,273. But the
government's main loan program,
the Stafford loan, has continued
since 1992 to offer undergraduates
no more than a total of $23,000 â€”
causing more families to turn to
private borrowing.
Although private loans often
allow students to borrow more,
they carry greater risk. Unlike most
federal loans, their interest rates are
variable and uncapped.
The current interest rate on the
GATE loan is 4.76 percent, and
there is no cap. The rate is subject to
