# Plan would downplay LSATs
## Law School Admissions Council considers changing rules to stem rankings-conscious policies 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Law School Admissions Council is con
sidering a policy to lessen the emphasis that law
schools place on LSAT scores when admitting
candidates. The idea, which has not yet been
put in the form of a proposal, would be to re
port LSAT scores only as percentiles within
school's applicant pool, so that ranking services
such as the U.S. News 8c World Report's cannot
compare scores between institutions.
Faye Deal, associate dean for admissions and
financial aid at the Stanford Law School, em
phasized that the idea had not yet progressed to
the comment stage, where input would be so
licited from the deans of the 180 law schools
that make up the Law School Admissions
Council.
Deal acknowledged that the emphasis
schools place on their rankings in U.S. News &
World Report might represent a legitimate
problem.
"LSAT scores are emphasized with the rank
ings the way they are," Deal said.
She pointed out that schools interested in
moving up in the rankings are more likely to
admit students with good LSAT scores and
mediocre overall records.
"That's an easy fix for [the schools]," she
noted.

The law school council has had a working
group for many years examining the perceived
problem of overemphasis on LSAT scores. Ac
cording to the Chronicle of Higher Education,
in 2001 the council allocated $10 million to de
crease the emphasis on LSAT scores in admis
sions.
The idea being advanced would change re
porting of LSAT scores so that students would
only find out where they ranked within the ap
plicant pools of various law schools, and the
schools would only know how each applicant
scored in relationship to the other applicants.
Law schools would thus not have applicant
scores, currently reported on a scale between
120 and 180, to hand over to U.S. News.
Deal expressed a few reservations about the
idea of systematically reducing the emphasis of
just one piece of the rankings puzzle.
"There's a bigger problem there than just re
porting [LSAT scores] to schools," she said.
The Law School Admissions Council Web
site features a prominent letter signed by 170
deans, including Kathleen Sullivan, dean of
Stanford Law School, noting that rankings are
"inherently Hawed" because they do not take
into consideration important but less tangible
factors such as quality of instruction and
breadth of curriculum.
Deal said she did not yet know how the plan
would affect Stanford, whose law school is cur
rently second to Yale in the U.S. News rank
ings.
Deal noted that, if LSATs were not counted
in the U.S. News rankings, the other factors
that replaced them in the equation could be
things over which Stanford has little control.

"Everyone knows California has a harder
bar exam, and U.S. News does not factor the
difficulty into the rankings," she said.
She also pointed out Stanford's small size
and therefore slightly higher student-to-faculty
ratio as something that the rankings consider
that does not benefit Stanford.
Still, Deal said that Stanford does not pay
much attention to rankings.
"It's a secondary concern," she said. "If you
look at the point differential between the top
schools, it is extremely small. Top students al
ready know to consider Stanford."
"As we're reading files, we don't worry that a
2.8 GPA will bringdown our ranking," she said.
"Stanford has always looked at the whole appli
cation."
