# Islamic law class draws crowd
## Lecture series opens doors to general public 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 100 people packed
into Encina Hall's Oksenberg
Room and many more were
turned away from last night's in
augural public lecture in a course
on Islam and the rule of law. A
joint offering of the Law School's
Rule of Law Program and the In
stitute for International Studies,
the course is unique in that it
brings experts in Islamic law from
around the country to speak to
audiences comprised of both stu
dents and the general public.
"Tons more people came than we
expected," said Shirin Sinnar, refer
ring to last night's lecture by Assoc.
Prof, of History Ahmad Dallal.
The course is meant to focus at
tention on different aspects of
Islam and how Islamic law works

both in practice and in theory.
"The class is about law in rela
tionship to gender and women,
law in relationship to violence, law
in relationship to interpretation of
the text, law in relationship to
democracy, and placing all of these
in history and context," said Law
School Lecturer Erik Jensen, who
organized the course.
The course is just one part of a
multifaceted effort to increase
understanding of Islam and ex
pand the study of the religion at
Stanford.
"Post 9/11 there is a general
movement in the University to in
crease awareness of Islamic issues,"
Jensen noted. "The course is 15
years too late, but I see the course
and others like it as a platform for
accelerated focus on Islam."
The course's aims are broad.
Public lectures are held on Mon
days, and on Tuesdays there are
more in-depth seminars for the 15
students taking the course for
credit. Jensen said he hopes to

combine the expertise of law stu
dents with the broader focus of so
cial science students.
Jensen put together a roster of
Islamic legal scholars, experts in
the field, to come and address the
class.
"In many ways there is no bona
fide center of Islamic legal studies
in the United States," Jensen said.
So Jensen, with the help of Dal
lal and Jensen's teaching assistant
Sinnar, recruited 13 scholars from
around the country to speak with
the unify ing theme of the rule of
law in Islamic society.
Sinnar pointed out that one no
table aspect of this group of ex
perts is that many are engaged in
Islam both through scholarship
and religious commitment.
"Many of them are rethinking
the traditions from within," she
said. "They're not just going to
present dry commentary; instead
they are engaged in the faith and
double as scholars and internal
critics."
Donors for the course were es
pecially interested in the public
lecture aspect, and because an an
nouncement for the class was
prominently placed in the San
Jose Mercury News, the students
in the course had trouble finding
space to stand in the filled room
last night. Those in attendance
heard a detailed speech on the his
tory of Islamic law.
Jensen hopes that the course
sparks greater interest in Islam
throughout the University.
"I see the course as part of a
growing movement to raise funds
and hire more faculty [in Islamic
Studies]," Jensen said.
Last night, Dallal emphasized
the historical fragmentation of cer
tain aspects of Islamic law, noting
that while the law originates with
the Koran, many laws are based on
traditions and sayings of Muham
mad, which are not as indis
putable. Still, he said, the study of
law is absolutely essential in under
standing Islamic society.
"The legal legacy is the most im
portant central tradition in the
Muslim world," he said. "The
scholar was the jurist."
