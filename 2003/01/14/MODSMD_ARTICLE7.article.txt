# A 						Pakistani Perspective
## Worlds apart 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editors Note: This is the third in a week
ly series of interviews with international
students at Stanford meant to heighten
awareness of issues of social and political
importance around the world.

Jazib Zahir is an undeclared
sophomore from Lahore, Pak
istan, in the Punjab region near the
Indian border. The Daily sat down
with Zahir to get his perspective on
the problems facing his country
and the issues he deals with as a
Pakistani student at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily: Did you go
back to Pakistan over the holiday
break?
Jazib Zahir: Not dining the current
winter break, but I did go back to
Pakistan in the summer before
sophomore year for about two
months. For the current winter
break I stayed witJi relatives on the
East Coast.
TSD: What are some of the big so
cial and political issues in Pakistan
right now?
JZ: I think there are a lot of political

issues concerning people in Pak
istan right now. We're trying to set
up a democratic system in the coun
try because there's a lot of pressure
on us to have a democratic system
from the West.
We're a country where no demo
cratically elected government has
ever completed its term in office; it's
always been overthrown by a mili
tary ruler some way through its of
fice. We're really trying to get stabil
ity. We're trying to improve our
country's reputation because every
one just sees it as something that's in
the hands of the military, but that
would be dangerous because we are
a nuclear power.
So we want to show the world
that it's not a country run by the mil
itary. So our main political issue is to
establish a stable democratic gov
ernment that does not share power
with the military, rather is above the
military.
I think people are also very con
cerned about die rampant corrup
tion in the system. We're regarded
as one of the most corrupt nations in
the world, and that's a major factor
driving people out of the country
because they feel that you do not get
jobs in our country through your
merit; it's all about connections and
how much you're willing to lie. They
feel that that's an environment in
which diey're not comfortable, and
they would rather move here.
TSD: How much support is there
for the current leadership in Pak
istan?
J Z: There's definitely a split. I'd
say among the more educated
classes, there's the feeling that
[President Pervez] Musharraf is
the best available option among
the current options. They don't
necessarily regard him very high
ly, but they feel that he is the least
of the evils.
But as far as the conservative
elements are concerned — who
have always been a major factor in
our country's politics — I think
the fact that he allies himself with
the United States. . . has drawn
much fire, and he's lost his sup
port among that element of the
country.
TSD: Is there religious division
within the country?
JZ: The country is officially called
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It's
not secular, as some other predomi
nandy Muslim countries are. The
laws are all based on Islam, and a
very high proportion of people are
Muslim.
It's difficult to get recognition in
the country as a non-Muslim. I can't
diink of any dominant non-Muslims
in the country, which is very differ
ent from say, India, where many of
their greatest actors and sportsmen
are Muslim. Of course, there is also
a much smaller proportion of non-
Muslims here.
Even within the Muslim religion
there is a split which many people
are aware of between the Sunnis
and the Shi'ites, and Pakistan is
predominandy Sunni. I'm in an in
teresting position because the part
of the city where I live is actually
Shi'ite, so I see both sects of Islam.
A couple of years back it was pretty
bad, and there was a lot of ethnic vi
olence. .. but I think today it's no
longer a major issue.

TSD: How have these issues affect
ed you personally?
JZ: Actually, I was surprised when
I went back home in the summer:
Although my city is right on the
border with India, and it was a
time when people were fearful that
there would be a war between
India and Pakistan, I did not real
ly notice any significant change. If
you hadn't told me there was
something wrong, it didn't look
like there was something wrong.

I've lived all these years in Pakistan being told, "Hey,
you're going to be at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow."
I live right on the border; and it hasn't been a problem.

Ore slight change is that a lot of
my friends have moved away from
the city because of the happenings
in Pakistan. But I don't think that
my family situation is really bad. I
think our standard of living has
been pretty much the same.
TSD: What is it like being Pakistani
at Stanford?
JZ: I really like telling people about
home, about what kind of system
I've been through. Telling people
about what's important to me, how I
celebrate my customs, what my tra
ditional dress is like....
It hasn't really been hard for me
at all. I don't feel that people really
look at me differently in any mean
ingful way.
Sometimes when I'm in a group
of people and I see an Indian and
I introduce myself to him or her,
everyone else will look at me
strangely, like, "You two are sup
posed to fight now." I'm like, "Oh,
no, not at all." I'm just really sur
prised by that.
There are some mispercep
tions, but I'd like to add that the
very fact that people ask me ques
tions about Islam like, "Why does
the status of women seem to be de
grading?" makes me stop and
think myself and question myself
about why that is. Their interest in
my religion can enhance my own
understanding.
TSD: Have you encountered diffi
culties with the INS?

JZ: Actually, I have not registered
with the INS yet. The due date is
between Jan. 21 and Feb. 13. I
would have had to register [earli
er] if 1 had left the country and
come back. But I was within the
country during winter break, so I
have not registered yet.
TSD: So you don't have any fears of
problems?
JZ: I don't think so, because I first
came to this country six days after

9/11, and I went to the airports and
through die procedure of entering
the country. I didn't have any prob
lems then, so I don't think I should
have any now.
TSD: What are the most common
misconceptions about Pakistan on
the part of Americans?
JZ: I think a lot of people would be
lieve that there's uniformity in the
lifestyle, while the truth is that rural
and urban life are worlds apart.
I feel like die picture you get is
that this is an economically failed
country and people have a very low
standard of living. On average that is
true, and anyone you meet at Stan
ford would be in a much better situ
ation than die average person diere.
But I think diat there are definitely a
significant number of people widi a
pretty high standard of living.
I think one of the main miscon
ceptions is that people in Pakistan
don't have much exposure to the
West at all. I remember that I was
watching TV with some people
here, and something from the Back
street Boys came on, and I started
singing along. They were like, "Hey,
how do you know that?" I told them,
"We have MTV, too."
TSD: When you're in Pakistan, how
do people feel about America and
about your coming here for your
education?
JZ: Once again, there's a split.
There are definitely people who

know more about America than
others. There are people who have
family in America, and there are
others who have no family in Amer
ica and know nothing about it.
1 think the older generation
does not think very highly of the
American lifestyle. They think,
"I'm sending my kids there to ben
efit from the high quality of edu
cation'" Then they look at their
friends' kids, how they're living
alone alter graduating rather than
living with their families, and
they're going to want to break up
the joint-family system at home.
They're going to want to go and
learn all types of religion, which is
something they don't want.
They're telling younger gener
ations that the American lifestyle
is incompatible with our lifestyle,
and we should try not to be influ
enced by it. We should go there
for the high standard of educa
tion, or we should go there to
work there, but we should try to
stay in the same lifestyle that we
have back at home.
But among the younger gener
ation, I think they hold a very
high opinion of the American
lifestyle. They see it as something
that you can have a lot of oppor
tunities, you can have a lot of free
dom, and you can't experience
that at home.
When they have to pick a system
out of die Far East, the United States
and Europe, they pick the United
States, thinking that it is such a mul
ticultural place and a place where
you can do whatever you want.
TSD: Is there anything else you
would like to add?
JZ: I think a lot of people's fears
about Pakistan are unfounded. I've
lived all these years in Pakistan
being told, "Hey, you're going to be
at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow; you have to go
underground."
I live right on the border, and
after the first few years of the coun
try being made, it hasn't been a
problem. Every time there's a slight
fear, all the trips to South Asia get
canceled.
I think the truth is a lot of these
problems are overhyped, and noth
ing really ever happens. I think that
to regard it as a big hot zone for ter
rorism and activity in a lot of ways is
unfounded.

Jazib Zahir is an undeclared
sophomore from Lahore, Pak
istan, in the Punjab region near the
Indian border. The Daily sat down
with Zahir to get his perspective on
the problems facing his country
and the issues he deals with as a
Pakistani student at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily: Did you go
back to Pakistan over the holiday
break?
Jazib Zahir: Not dining the current
winter break, but I did go back to
Pakistan in the summer before
sophomore year for about two
months. For the current winter
break I stayed witJi relatives on the
East Coast.
TSD: What are some of the big so
cial and political issues in Pakistan
right now?
JZ: I think there are a lot of political

issues concerning people in Pak
istan right now. We're trying to set
up a democratic system in the coun
try because there's a lot of pressure
on us to have a democratic system
from the West.
We're a country where no demo
cratically elected government has
ever completed its term in office; it's
always been overthrown by a mili
tary ruler some way through its of
fice. We're really trying to get stabil
ity. We're trying to improve our
country's reputation because every
one just sees it as something that's in
the hands of the military, but that
would be dangerous because we are
a nuclear power.
So we want to show the world
that it's not a country run by the mil
itary. So our main political issue is to
establish a stable democratic gov
ernment that does not share power
with the military, rather is above the
military.
I think people are also very con
cerned about die rampant corrup
tion in the system. We're regarded
as one of the most corrupt nations in
the world, and that's a major factor
driving people out of the country
because they feel that you do not get
jobs in our country through your
merit; it's all about connections and
how much you're willing to lie. They
feel that that's an environment in
which diey're not comfortable, and
they would rather move here.
TSD: How much support is there
for the current leadership in Pak
istan?
J Z: There's definitely a split. I'd
say among the more educated
classes, there's the feeling that
[President Pervez] Musharraf is
the best available option among
the current options. They don't
necessarily regard him very high
ly, but they feel that he is the least
of the evils.
But as far as the conservative
elements are concerned — who
have always been a major factor in
our country's politics — I think
the fact that he allies himself with
the United States. . . has drawn
much fire, and he's lost his sup
port among that element of the
country.
TSD: Is there religious division
within the country?
JZ: The country is officially called
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It's
not secular, as some other predomi
nandy Muslim countries are. The
laws are all based on Islam, and a
very high proportion of people are
Muslim.
It's difficult to get recognition in
the country as a non-Muslim. I can't
diink of any dominant non-Muslims
in the country, which is very differ
ent from say, India, where many of
their greatest actors and sportsmen
are Muslim. Of course, there is also
a much smaller proportion of non-
Muslims here.
Even within the Muslim religion
there is a split which many people
are aware of between the Sunnis
and the Shi'ites, and Pakistan is
predominandy Sunni. I'm in an in
teresting position because the part
of the city where I live is actually
Shi'ite, so I see both sects of Islam.
A couple of years back it was pretty
bad, and there was a lot of ethnic vi
olence. .. but I think today it's no
longer a major issue.

TSD: How have these issues affect
ed you personally?
JZ: Actually, I was surprised when
I went back home in the summer:
Although my city is right on the
border with India, and it was a
time when people were fearful that
there would be a war between
India and Pakistan, I did not real
ly notice any significant change. If
you hadn't told me there was
something wrong, it didn't look
like there was something wrong.

I've lived all these years in Pakistan being told, "Hey,
you're going to be at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow."
I live right on the border; and it hasn't been a problem.

Ore slight change is that a lot of
my friends have moved away from
the city because of the happenings
in Pakistan. But I don't think that
my family situation is really bad. I
think our standard of living has
been pretty much the same.
TSD: What is it like being Pakistani
at Stanford?
JZ: I really like telling people about
home, about what kind of system
I've been through. Telling people
about what's important to me, how I
celebrate my customs, what my tra
ditional dress is like....
It hasn't really been hard for me
at all. I don't feel that people really
look at me differently in any mean
ingful way.
Sometimes when I'm in a group
of people and I see an Indian and
I introduce myself to him or her,
everyone else will look at me
strangely, like, "You two are sup
posed to fight now." I'm like, "Oh,
no, not at all." I'm just really sur
prised by that.
There are some mispercep
tions, but I'd like to add that the
very fact that people ask me ques
tions about Islam like, "Why does
the status of women seem to be de
grading?" makes me stop and
think myself and question myself
about why that is. Their interest in
my religion can enhance my own
understanding.
TSD: Have you encountered diffi
culties with the INS?

JZ: Actually, I have not registered
with the INS yet. The due date is
between Jan. 21 and Feb. 13. I
would have had to register [earli
er] if 1 had left the country and
come back. But I was within the
country during winter break, so I
have not registered yet.
TSD: So you don't have any fears of
problems?
JZ: I don't think so, because I first
came to this country six days after

9/11, and I went to the airports and
through die procedure of entering
the country. I didn't have any prob
lems then, so I don't think I should
have any now.
TSD: What are the most common
misconceptions about Pakistan on
the part of Americans?
JZ: I think a lot of people would be
lieve that there's uniformity in the
lifestyle, while the truth is that rural
and urban life are worlds apart.
I feel like die picture you get is
that this is an economically failed
country and people have a very low
standard of living. On average that is
true, and anyone you meet at Stan
ford would be in a much better situ
ation than die average person diere.
But I think diat there are definitely a
significant number of people widi a
pretty high standard of living.
I think one of the main miscon
ceptions is that people in Pakistan
don't have much exposure to the
West at all. I remember that I was
watching TV with some people
here, and something from the Back
street Boys came on, and I started
singing along. They were like, "Hey,
how do you know that?" I told them,
"We have MTV, too."
TSD: When you're in Pakistan, how
do people feel about America and
about your coming here for your
education?
JZ: Once again, there's a split.
There are definitely people who

know more about America than
others. There are people who have
family in America, and there are
others who have no family in Amer
ica and know nothing about it.
1 think the older generation
does not think very highly of the
American lifestyle. They think,
"I'm sending my kids there to ben
efit from the high quality of edu
cation'" Then they look at their
friends' kids, how they're living
alone alter graduating rather than
living with their families, and
they're going to want to break up
the joint-family system at home.
They're going to want to go and
learn all types of religion, which is
something they don't want.
They're telling younger gener
ations that the American lifestyle
is incompatible with our lifestyle,
and we should try not to be influ
enced by it. We should go there
for the high standard of educa
tion, or we should go there to
work there, but we should try to
stay in the same lifestyle that we
have back at home.
But among the younger gener
ation, I think they hold a very
high opinion of the American
lifestyle. They see it as something
that you can have a lot of oppor
tunities, you can have a lot of free
dom, and you can't experience
that at home.
When they have to pick a system
out of die Far East, the United States
and Europe, they pick the United
States, thinking that it is such a mul
ticultural place and a place where
you can do whatever you want.
TSD: Is there anything else you
would like to add?
JZ: I think a lot of people's fears
about Pakistan are unfounded. I've
lived all these years in Pakistan
being told, "Hey, you're going to be
at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow; you have to go
underground."
I live right on the border, and
after the first few years of the coun
try being made, it hasn't been a
problem. Every time there's a slight
fear, all the trips to South Asia get
canceled.
I think the truth is a lot of these
problems are overhyped, and noth
ing really ever happens. I think that
to regard it as a big hot zone for ter
rorism and activity in a lot of ways is
unfounded.

and the issues he deals with as a
Pakistani student at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily: Did you go
back to Pakistan over the holiday
break?
Jazib Zahir: Not dining the current
winter break, but I did go back to
Pakistan in the summer before
sophomore year for about two
months. For the current winter
break I stayed witJi relatives on the
East Coast.
TSD: What are some of the big so
cial and political issues in Pakistan
right now?
JZ: I think there are a lot of political

issues concerning people in Pak
istan right now. We're trying to set
up a democratic system in the coun
try because there's a lot of pressure
on us to have a democratic system
from the West.
We're a country where no demo
cratically elected government has
ever completed its term in office; it's
always been overthrown by a mili
tary ruler some way through its of
fice. We're really trying to get stabil
ity. We're trying to improve our
country's reputation because every
one just sees it as something that's in
the hands of the military, but that
would be dangerous because we are
a nuclear power.
So we want to show the world
that it's not a country run by the mil
itary. So our main political issue is to
establish a stable democratic gov
ernment that does not share power
with the military, rather is above the
military.
I think people are also very con
cerned about die rampant corrup
tion in the system. We're regarded
as one of the most corrupt nations in
the world, and that's a major factor
driving people out of the country
because they feel that you do not get
jobs in our country through your
merit; it's all about connections and
how much you're willing to lie. They
feel that that's an environment in
which diey're not comfortable, and
they would rather move here.
TSD: How much support is there
for the current leadership in Pak
istan?
J Z: There's definitely a split. I'd
say among the more educated
classes, there's the feeling that
[President Pervez] Musharraf is
the best available option among
the current options. They don't
necessarily regard him very high
ly, but they feel that he is the least
of the evils.
But as far as the conservative
elements are concerned — who
have always been a major factor in
our country's politics — I think
the fact that he allies himself with
the United States. . . has drawn
much fire, and he's lost his sup
port among that element of the
country.
TSD: Is there religious division
within the country?
JZ: The country is officially called
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It's
not secular, as some other predomi
nandy Muslim countries are. The
laws are all based on Islam, and a
very high proportion of people are
Muslim.
It's difficult to get recognition in
the country as a non-Muslim. I can't
diink of any dominant non-Muslims
in the country, which is very differ
ent from say, India, where many of
their greatest actors and sportsmen
are Muslim. Of course, there is also
a much smaller proportion of non-
Muslims here.
Even within the Muslim religion
there is a split which many people
are aware of between the Sunnis
and the Shi'ites, and Pakistan is
predominandy Sunni. I'm in an in
teresting position because the part
of the city where I live is actually
Shi'ite, so I see both sects of Islam.
A couple of years back it was pretty
bad, and there was a lot of ethnic vi
olence. .. but I think today it's no
longer a major issue.

TSD: How have these issues affect
ed you personally?
JZ: Actually, I was surprised when
I went back home in the summer:
Although my city is right on the
border with India, and it was a
time when people were fearful that
there would be a war between
India and Pakistan, I did not real
ly notice any significant change. If
you hadn't told me there was
something wrong, it didn't look
like there was something wrong.

I've lived all these years in Pakistan being told, "Hey,
you're going to be at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow."
I live right on the border; and it hasn't been a problem.

Ore slight change is that a lot of
my friends have moved away from
the city because of the happenings
in Pakistan. But I don't think that
my family situation is really bad. I
think our standard of living has
been pretty much the same.
TSD: What is it like being Pakistani
at Stanford?
JZ: I really like telling people about
home, about what kind of system
I've been through. Telling people
about what's important to me, how I
celebrate my customs, what my tra
ditional dress is like....
It hasn't really been hard for me
at all. I don't feel that people really
look at me differently in any mean
ingful way.
Sometimes when I'm in a group
of people and I see an Indian and
I introduce myself to him or her,
everyone else will look at me
strangely, like, "You two are sup
posed to fight now." I'm like, "Oh,
no, not at all." I'm just really sur
prised by that.
There are some mispercep
tions, but I'd like to add that the
very fact that people ask me ques
tions about Islam like, "Why does
the status of women seem to be de
grading?" makes me stop and
think myself and question myself
about why that is. Their interest in
my religion can enhance my own
understanding.
TSD: Have you encountered diffi
culties with the INS?

JZ: Actually, I have not registered
with the INS yet. The due date is
between Jan. 21 and Feb. 13. I
would have had to register [earli
er] if 1 had left the country and
come back. But I was within the
country during winter break, so I
have not registered yet.
TSD: So you don't have any fears of
problems?
JZ: I don't think so, because I first
came to this country six days after

9/11, and I went to the airports and
through die procedure of entering
the country. I didn't have any prob
lems then, so I don't think I should
have any now.
TSD: What are the most common
misconceptions about Pakistan on
the part of Americans?
JZ: I think a lot of people would be
lieve that there's uniformity in the
lifestyle, while the truth is that rural
and urban life are worlds apart.
I feel like die picture you get is
that this is an economically failed
country and people have a very low
standard of living. On average that is
true, and anyone you meet at Stan
ford would be in a much better situ
ation than die average person diere.
But I think diat there are definitely a
significant number of people widi a
pretty high standard of living.
I think one of the main miscon
ceptions is that people in Pakistan
don't have much exposure to the
West at all. I remember that I was
watching TV with some people
here, and something from the Back
street Boys came on, and I started
singing along. They were like, "Hey,
how do you know that?" I told them,
"We have MTV, too."
TSD: When you're in Pakistan, how
do people feel about America and
about your coming here for your
education?
JZ: Once again, there's a split.
There are definitely people who

know more about America than
others. There are people who have
family in America, and there are
others who have no family in Amer
ica and know nothing about it.
1 think the older generation
does not think very highly of the
American lifestyle. They think,
"I'm sending my kids there to ben
efit from the high quality of edu
cation'" Then they look at their
friends' kids, how they're living
alone alter graduating rather than
living with their families, and
they're going to want to break up
the joint-family system at home.
They're going to want to go and
learn all types of religion, which is
something they don't want.
They're telling younger gener
ations that the American lifestyle
is incompatible with our lifestyle,
and we should try not to be influ
enced by it. We should go there
for the high standard of educa
tion, or we should go there to
work there, but we should try to
stay in the same lifestyle that we
have back at home.
But among the younger gener
ation, I think they hold a very
high opinion of the American
lifestyle. They see it as something
that you can have a lot of oppor
tunities, you can have a lot of free
dom, and you can't experience
that at home.
When they have to pick a system
out of die Far East, the United States
and Europe, they pick the United
States, thinking that it is such a mul
ticultural place and a place where
you can do whatever you want.
TSD: Is there anything else you
would like to add?
JZ: I think a lot of people's fears
about Pakistan are unfounded. I've
lived all these years in Pakistan
being told, "Hey, you're going to be
at war tomorrow; you're going to be
bombed tomorrow; you have to go
underground."
I live right on the border, and
after the first few years of the coun
try being made, it hasn't been a
problem. Every time there's a slight
fear, all the trips to South Asia get
canceled.
I think the truth is a lot of these
problems are overhyped, and noth
ing really ever happens. I think that
to regard it as a big hot zone for ter
rorism and activity in a lot of ways is
unfounded.
