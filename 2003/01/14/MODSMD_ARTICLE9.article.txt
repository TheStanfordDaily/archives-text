### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates has
decided to plead guilty for the theft
and subsequent disposal of 1,000
copies of the Nov. 4 issue of the
Daily Californian, which contained
an endorsement of his opponent,
Shirley Dean. A month after the in
cident, Bates is developing legisla
tion to prevent this type of theft
from reoccuiring.
"There is no question that toss
ing newspapers is absolutely inap
propriate and unacceptable," said
Bates, who had earlier denied his
involvement in the theft. "I apolo
gize on behalf of myself and my
supporters for our involvement in
this activity."
After an investigation by the
University of California police de
partment, the Alameda County
District Attorney charged Bates
with petty theft. In a public state
ment, Bates announced that he
would plead guilty and pay the
$250 fine. Bates also said that he will

compensate the Daily Californian
for the copies that were stolen.
"In addition to paying the fine, I
have reached an agreement with
the Daily Cal to pay restitution of
$500 and propose a city ordinance
to make theft of free newspapers il
legal," Bates said. "I will work with
the California legislature to develop
a state law to do the same."
Bates has also decided to speak
to students at UC-Berkeley about
the dangers of irresponsible deci
sion-making.
"I want to help students under
stand the importance of their deci
sions, and that they are responsible
for their actions," Bates said. "I will
tell students that impulsive actions
have lasting consequences that can
profoundly affect the rest of their
lives."
Bates' actions have indeed had
unforeseen consequences. While
he was being sworn in at his first city
council meeting on Dec. 10, nearly
two-dozen protesters swarmed the
council chambers, waving signs de
manding his resignation. On Dec.

6, the Daily Californian ran air un
signed editorial calling for Bates'
resignation and denouncing him as
"capable of selfishly immoral and
politically petty acts."
"I think we all agree that cam
paigns must be about furthering
the free exchange of ideas," Bates
said. "Any effort to impede this free
exchange is a great disserv ice to die
Daily Californian and the people of
Berkeley."
The Daily Californian reported
that Rong-Gong Lin, 11, the news
paper's editor in chief, continues to
criticize the mayor for the theft.
"It's especially ironic he would
have thrown these Daily Cals away
just a few feet away from the birth
place of the free-speech move
ment," Lin said.
Lin expressed disappointment at
the leniency of the charge, adding
that he would have liked to see Bates
convicted of a misdemeanor. How
ever, Lin said he was still pleased
with the outcome of the proceed
ings since past Daily Californian
thefts have not been prosecuted.

Lin criticized current laws pro
hibiting the theft of free newspa
pers as too vague. Authorities in
some jurisdictions do not even con
sider it a crime. Echoing Lin's con
cerns, Bates agreed that laws per
taining to such thefts need to be
clarified and is planning to intro
duce related legislation later in his
term.
While Lin maintained that Bates
has lost much of his credibility, es
pecially among the student popula
tion at UC-Berkeley, he admitted
that the free-newspaper laws Bates
hopes to pass at both the local and
state levels are a "step in the right
direction."
Despite the community's nega
tive reaction, Bates said he will still
be able to implement his ambitious
plans for the city of Berkeley and at
tributed the incident to the exhaus
tion and stress he endured during
his campaign.
"He was very exhausted from the
election, getting very little sleep, and
