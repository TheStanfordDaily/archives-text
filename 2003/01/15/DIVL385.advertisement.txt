Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director of Undergraduate
Research Programs for Honors Writing, in discovering the
techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers.
How I Write"
Conversations
"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts and bolts,
pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the conversation will primarily
focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idio
syncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer generates
ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition, overcomes various impediments and
blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that all
writers can learn and grow and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.

Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric
Prof. Lunsford is a scholar of rhetoric and composition studies, so this will be a particularly interesting conversation
because Prof. Lunsford actually writes about writing from college writing handbooks to scholarly analyses of women's
rhetoric, collaborative writing, and other topics. Consequently, her reflections on her own writing process will provide
unique insights. Her books include The St. Martin's Handbook, Everything's an Argument, The Everyday Writer,
Reclaiming Rhetorica: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition, The Presence of Others, and Singular Texts/Plural
Authors: Perspectives on Collaborative Writing.

John Bravman, Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education and Professor of
Materials Science and Engineering
In addition to his dissertation, "Morphological Aspects of Silicon," Prof. Bravman has published numerous technical
papers, often in collaboration with other scientists and engineers. He has also reviewed the dissertations and research
essays of numerous graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to scientific writing, Prof. Bravman, in his admin
istrative capacities, produces much day-to-day wriUng, such as reports and memos, the equivalent of "business writing"
in the corporate world, so we will be able to explore this often overlooked area of composition.

Scotty McLennan, Dean of Religious Life
Rev. Scotty McLennan is the author of Finding Your Religion: When tlye Faith You Grew Up with Has Lost Its Meaning
and, with Laura Nash, Church on Sunday, Work on Monday: A Guide to Reflection, and writing about religious faith
and ethics presents many questions of thought, approach and tone. As Dean of Religious Life, Rev. McLennan will also
offer insights into the very particular genres of the sermon and other forms of oratory, in addition to the rhetoric
involved in ceremonial and spiritual occasions. Plus, as Doonsebury's "Dude of God," he has the unique experience of
living a parallel life as a fictional character himself.
All events are held in the Stanford Writing Center in the basement of Margaret Jacks Hall (Bldg 460).
