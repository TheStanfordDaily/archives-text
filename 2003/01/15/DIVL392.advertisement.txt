Cesare Pavese

,W/y fe
Cesare Pavese was one of Italy's
great post-war writers. His
poetry was revolutionary-both
artistically and politically
rejecting the verbal and
philosophical constraints of
tradition and utilizing direct,
colloquial language. His subjects
were peasants, hobos, and
prostitutes, and this bilingual vol
ume includes all the poetry
Pavese ever published, including
work originally deleted by
Fascist censors. A landmark
volume. Cesare Pavese (1908-
50) was a novelist, poet, and
translator and a major literary
figure in post-war Italy. Pavese's
flight from the Fascists and
subsequent confinement were
reflected in his writings, which
dealt with social struggle and
revealed his sympathy for the
oppressed. He committed suicide
at the height of his literary
powers.
