## Kmart will close 326 more stores 
### 
DETROIT (AP) — Kmart Corp. an
nounced its biggest round of cutbacks
yet yesterday, saying it will close 326
more stores and eliminate 37,000 more
jobs in hopes of getting out of bank
ruptcy by the end of April.
The discount chain that pioneered
the blue-light special and introduced
Martha Stewan styles to the masses will
still have some 1,500 stores and
168,000 employees if the cutbacks are
approved by a federal bankruptcy
judge. But it will emerge from bank
ruptcy one-third smaller than it was
when it went in.
Kmart filed for Chapter 11 protec
tion from its creditors a year ago after
failing to compete with Wal-Mart's low
prices and Target's hipper merchan
dise. In its first round of cutbacks, it
closed 283 stores and cut 22,000j0bs last
year but still lost more than $2 billion.
This second round of closings affects
stores in 44 states and Puerto Rico.
Texas will lose 54 stores and a distribu
tion center. Florida will lose 24 stores,
California 19, North Carolina 18 and
Georgia 16.
Experts said the latest cutbacks may
not be enough.
"I think they've got to get beyond
lean and mean. They've got to get
small, real small," said Anthony Sabino,
associate professor of business at St.
John's University.
Arun Jain, a marketing professor at
the University at Buffalo School of
Management, suggested Kmart needs
to find some way of distinguishing itself
from the competition.

"Wal-Mart and Target are going to
rip them up," Jain said.
Since filing for bankruptcy, Kmart
has seen declines in sales at stores
open at least a year. Sales in Novem
ber were down 17.2 percent from a
year earlier, and December sales were
off 5.7 percent.

Kmart is closing underperforming
stores and those facing tough competi
tion, and is also looking to shed unprof
itable leases.
Kmart stock lost 9 cents, closing at 17
cents a share Tuesday.
Kmart has troubles beyond its busi
ness plan.

Just before its bankruptcy filing,
Kmart began receiving letters, pur
porting to be from employees, that sug
gested wrongdoing at the company.
The letters led to an investigation by the
FBI and the Securities and Exchange
Commission into the way Kmart was
run under its former management.
