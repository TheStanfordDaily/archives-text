# Report: Calif, energy crisis cost state $45 billion

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) â€” California's energy
crisis cost the state as much as $45 billion over two
years in higher electricity costs, lost business due to
blackouts and a slowdown in economic growth, ac
cording to a study released yesterday.
The report, from the Public Policy Institute of Cal
ifornia, concluded there was no one cause for the en
ergy crisis, which peaked in the winter of2ooo-01 and
led to six days of rolling blackouts.
A shortage of electricity generating capacity, a
Hawed market design from the state's attempt at
deregulation, the grip energy companies had over

wholesale electricity prices and regulatory missteps
all contributed to the energy crisis that spread to
other Western states.
But the state was also hit by circumstances it
couldn't control. In 2000, the cost of natural gas
and air quality credits rose, making electricity pro
duction more costly, and a drought in the North
west limited the supply of electricity from hydro
electric sources.
"Even if the electricity sector had remained regu
lated, prices would have increased, and some black
outs would have possibly occurred between May 2000

and June 2001 said the report, which was written by
Christopher Weare, a research fellow at the institute.
Though no "smoking gun" has been revealed, the
report's author said, the newly deregulated market
was "ripe for the exercise of market power," in which
energy companies acquire enough market share to be
able to drive wholesale electricity prices.
Utilities also relied too heavily on the volatile spot
market, rather than buying long-term contracts with
steady prices.
This led to a "full-blown financial fiasco," the re
port said.
