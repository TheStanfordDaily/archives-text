# U.S. considering to offer deal to North Korea

WASHINGTON (AP) — Adopting a more concil
iatory stance, President Bush said yesterday he may
revive a proposal for substantial economic benefits for
North Korea if it agrees to dismantle its nuclear
weapons facilities.
Also yesterday, China offered to host talks between
the United States and North Korea in a bid to end
their standoff, and the North warned it.was running
out of patience with Washington, threatening to ex
ercise undefined "options."
The administration had been prepared to make
such an offer last year but withdrew it after learning
that the North Koreans had initiated a uranium
based nuclear weapons program.
"We expect them not to develop nuclear
weapons," Bush said. "And if they so choose to do so
— their choice — then I will reconsider whether or
not we'll start the bold initiative" that he said he dis
cussed with Secretary of State Colin Powell last year.
Bush said the initiative included food, leaving the
impression that he was departing from long-standing
policy of not linking assistance in that area to political
developments.
Later, White House officials said Bush was refer
ring to an agriculture reform program for North
Korea, which faces yet another year of severe food
shortages.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
reaffirmed that food deliveries will continue irrespec
tive of political factors. Last year, the U.S. food contri
bution was 155,000 metric tons.
On Monday, Assistant Secretary of State James
Kelly said in South Korea that North Korea could
get energy aid if it dismantled its nuclear weapons
programs.
The administration has consistently opposed
opening negotiations with North Korea but Bush's
remarks offered the clear possibility of a deal: U.S. as
sistance in exchange for denuclearization.
The more benign posture should be well received
in South Korea, where both the outgoing president
and the president-elect believe that a policy of bel
ligerence toward the North doesn't work.
Speaking to reporters during a photo session with
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, Bush said
he is convinced the conflict will be resolved peacefully.
The basis of his optimism was not clear. Pyongyang
has given no indication of a willingness to back away
from its nuclear programs. Indeed, since the uranium
program was disclosed last October, it has threatened
to revive a separate weapons program that is plutoni
um-based. According to administration estimates,
North Korea could have up to six nuclear weapons in
a few months.
North Korea withdrew from the landmark Nu
clear Nonproliferation Treaty last week. It also has
threatened to resume long-range missile tests.
