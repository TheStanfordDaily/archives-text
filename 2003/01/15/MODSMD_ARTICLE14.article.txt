## The
						Stanford Daily Graduate-student advising in need of reform 
### 
Published Since 1891

Few things influence both the short- and
long-term success of a graduate student
more than the student-adviser relation
ship. Ideally a partnership whereby a
graduate student is apprenticed into the academ
ic profession, the student-adviser relationship af
fects directly both the immediate quality of a grad
uate student's life, and the course of his or her ca
reer. A providential few have a conscientious, caring
adviser, one who anticipates students' needs
throughout the phases of graduate study. Yet an
alarming number are much less fortunate, having
experiences that have driven graduate students at
some universities to unionize: irrelevant training,
cultures of miscommunication, oppressive work
loads, irregular funding, misappropriation of stu
dent intellectual property, academic fraud, verbal
abuse, threats and intimidation, slander and even
sexual harassment.
Graduate students suffering any abuse have little or
no recourse. A strict power differential between gradu
ate students and faculty, and the potential of being

blackballed keeps all but the grossest behavior from
ever being addressed. Advising systems at most uni
versities are unsavory confections of folkways, unwrit
ten rules, organizational conflicts and broken inter
faces, punctuated by a dismal lack of direction. Regret
tably, Stanford is no exception.
We believe Stanford must take greater responsibili
ty for creating and implementing a graduate advising
system whose explicit task is to shape leaders in
academia and industry.
We also believe Stanford is in a unique position
to distinguish itself from peer institutions, by al
ready having a culture favorable to an advising sys
tem capable of maximizing chances for student suc
cess. Stanford faculty are unusually well-clisposed
to meet with students and help them in any way
they can. Deans and other influential administra
tors have responded positively to GSC Chair Grace
Chang's concerns addressed recently before the
Faculty Senate, and have pledged their support to
investigate solutions. We exhort graduate students
and administrators to not neglect this opportunity

to create the sort of academic community that both
desire profoundly.
An effective advising system cannot be built without
support from the highest institutional levels. Although
a document exists about graduate-student advising
(Section 3 of "The Stanford Graduate Student Hand
book,") it fails to establish a protocol for conduct, and is
confined to numbly suggesting goals toward which
Stanford might aspire.
We suggest the establishment of a University level
committee charged with setting policy and overseeing
policy matters, setting a binding standard of conduct,
codifying prcx:edures for communication, and suiting
explicitly the expectations of both parties. Such a com
mittee must also create a procedure for handling stu
dent complaints, one which ensures no retaliation
against students, and yet which does not embarrass ei
ther the student or the faculty.
We agree that the schools within Stanford should
have sufficient autonomy to set additional academic
and policy standards, as befits their respective academ
ic communities. Deans and assistant deans of schools

must better supervise student-adviser relations and as
sume the task of assuring that University and school
standards do not conflict .
More immediately, the University ought toconduct
workshops and retreats aimed at sensitizing faculty and
administrators to the interpersonal and organizational
challenges of an effective advising system. These sorts
of experiences give all parties a common vocabulary,
help minimize miscommunication, and allow for par
ticipants to create their own unified purpose. Similar
initiatives have been useful recently in dealing with sex
ual harassment issues on campus.
Graduate students come to Stanford from around
the world to study with the most talented and distin
guished leaders in academia, business and govern
ment. An integral part of the education graduate stu
dents seek is training in the sort of leadership that it
takes to rise to the top of one's field. An advising system
that neglects this duty in favor of pedantry wastes in
calculable talent, profanes the academic mission, and
compromises our reputation in an area where we
should be the acknowledged leader.
