Winter quarter is well under
way, and although the unex
pected success of the Stanford
men's basketball team and the
mountains of fresh powder in Tahoe are re
minding you why you chose Stanford, the
fact that so many classes are offered only in
winter quarter is driving your unit total up
and calling you back to your computer. For
some students, the unique opportunity af
forded by the unusually thick Winter Quar
ter Time Schedule beckons them to the
point that they consider extending them
selves beyond the typical 20-unit fare. But,
ever the Cal to your Big Game, the Regis
trar's Office is there to quickly snuff out any
ideas of dissent — after all, this is an aca
demic institution.
The issue of the 20-unit cap received a
bit of attention on these pages last au-

tumn. In typical Daily
debate style, an article
on Oct. 30, entitled "The
20-unit cap explained"
was published, a letter to
the editor was fired back
the next day, and finally
an editorial sought to
find the middle ground.
However, they pretty
much left the issue unre-

solved. In defending its position, the
Registrar's Office ottered up a series of
thin, easily refuted arguments as to why
the 20-unit cap was necessary.
These ranged from the fact that students
taking 25 units could not enjoy all that Stan
ford has to offer, to an economic argument
that the cost of unlimited enrollment and
early graduation would be unfeasible from
the University's perspective, with a claim
that students could not possibly study more
than 20 units in depth thrown into the mid
dle. In one of the finer letters to ever grace
the pages of The Daily, Joshua Kramer
punched holes in (he arguments of the
Registrar's Office as if he were Muhammad
Ali grimacing over the fallen Sonny Liston.
Kramer found it difficult to believe that a
university would have trouble with stu
dents maximizing the value of their tuition,
and pointed out the absurdity of Dandre
DeSandies' claim that there was not pres
sure on students to graduate early because
of Stanford's generous financial aid.
Stanford may have generous financial
aid, but that doesn't mean that every student
has an extra $20,000 or $30,000 lying
around for another year's tuition. In a post-
Enron world, students should be applauded
for their fiscal responsibility, and DeSandies
should think twice before suggesting that a
policy that may cost students tens of thou
sands of dollars makes sense because some
students will qualify for varying amounts of
financial aid. As we see it, there are two fun
damental issues at stake in the University's
decision to limit the number of units that stu
dents take. The first is whether or not Stan
ford students possess the ability to self-regu
late. It is ridiculous to think that students at

Stanford do not have the wherewithal to de
cide whether they should take another class
or watch "The Bachelorette." No doubt the
registrar will not produce any numbers of
this sort, but it would be interesting to know
how many undergraduates, as a percentage
of the student body, take 18,19 or 20 units in
any given quarter. In odier words, how
many students are essentially at die cap? We
imagine diat the number is relatively small,
and that the number of intrepid students
who would want to exceed the cap is even
smaller. Thus, in the name of protecting a
few students who might try to hide from so
cial interaction, the registrar denies the legit
imate academic interests of a larger number
of socially well-adjusted students. Mr. Print
up, this is a university, which traditionally
means a place of study.
That said, we admit that freshmen are a
special case. They have not had the op
portunity to gauge the academic demands
of Stanford coursework. Likewise, the so
cializing aspect of freshman year is clearly
more significant than in later years, when
social circles are much less fluid. Thus, we
would keep the unit cap for freshmen.
The second reason given for the cap is eco
nomic. Perhaps the best argument for the
cap is the associated loss of revenue from
students who finish their degrees earlier.
In an era of budget cuts and surly student
groups, it is important to not lose any
more revenue streams than the economy
hath already wrought. Nonetheless, tu
ition only accounts for about 16 percent of
the total university budget.
Printup has highballed the number of
students who would exceed the cap at
1,000, presumably per quarter. Even if one
assumes that these are the same 1,000 stu
dents each quarter, and thus that these stu
dents graduate on average a quarter earli
er than they would with the cap, the rev
enue lost by abolishing the cap is still in
finitesimal relative to the University bud
get. However, relative to even an upper
middle class student, the savings in tuition
is substantial. The registrar might argue
that there are additional costs outside of lost
tuition. However, the marginal cost of the
extra units to the University is small. In
other words, the 21st unit does not tax Uni
versity resources nearly as much as the first.
What is another student in a lecture hall, or
one extra paper in a stack of 10 or 20? Even
if the University is sometimes compelled to
add an additional TA here and t here, we all
know fiow well TA's are compensated.
In essence, we are just trying to make
sense of this policy. The arguments ad
vanced to this point in favor of the policy
seem to lack substance. If there are real
economic concerns, we petition the regis
trar to produce data to substantiate this
claim. If not, change the damn policy.

aid, but that doesn't mean that every student
has an extra $20,000 or $30,000 lying
around for another year's tuition. In a post-
Enron world, students should be applauded
for their fiscal responsibility, and DeSandies
should think twice before suggesting that a
policy that may cost students tens of thou
sands of dollars makes sense because some
students will qualify for varying amounts of
financial aid. As we see it, there are two fun
damental issues at stake in the University's
decision to limit the number of units that stu
dents take. The first is whether or not Stan
ford students possess the ability to self-regu
late. It is ridiculous to think that students at

Stanford do not have the wherewithal to de
cide whether they should take another class
or watch "The Bachelorette." No doubt the
registrar will not produce any numbers of
this sort, but it would be interesting to know
how many undergraduates, as a percentage
of the student body, take 18,19 or 20 units in
any given quarter. In odier words, how
many students are essentially at die cap? We
imagine diat the number is relatively small,
and that the number of intrepid students
who would want to exceed the cap is even
smaller. Thus, in the name of protecting a
few students who might try to hide from so
cial interaction, the registrar denies the legit
imate academic interests of a larger number
of socially well-adjusted students. Mr. Print
up, this is a university, which traditionally
means a place of study.
That said, we admit that freshmen are a
special case. They have not had the op
portunity to gauge the academic demands
of Stanford coursework. Likewise, the so
cializing aspect of freshman year is clearly
more significant than in later years, when
social circles are much less fluid. Thus, we
would keep the unit cap for freshmen.
The second reason given for the cap is eco
nomic. Perhaps the best argument for the
cap is the associated loss of revenue from
students who finish their degrees earlier.
In an era of budget cuts and surly student
groups, it is important to not lose any
more revenue streams than the economy
hath already wrought. Nonetheless, tu
ition only accounts for about 16 percent of
the total university budget.
Printup has highballed the number of
students who would exceed the cap at
1,000, presumably per quarter. Even if one
assumes that these are the same 1,000 stu
dents each quarter, and thus that these stu
dents graduate on average a quarter earli
er than they would with the cap, the rev
enue lost by abolishing the cap is still in
finitesimal relative to the University bud
get. However, relative to even an upper
middle class student, the savings in tuition
is substantial. The registrar might argue
that there are additional costs outside of lost
tuition. However, the marginal cost of the
extra units to the University is small. In
other words, the 21st unit does not tax Uni
versity resources nearly as much as the first.
What is another student in a lecture hall, or
one extra paper in a stack of 10 or 20? Even
if the University is sometimes compelled to
add an additional TA here and t here, we all
know fiow well TA's are compensated.
In essence, we are just trying to make
sense of this policy. The arguments ad
vanced to this point in favor of the policy
seem to lack substance. If there are real
economic concerns, we petition the regis
trar to produce data to substantiate this
claim. If not, change the damn policy.

Winter quarter is well under
way, and although the unex
pected success of the Stanford
men's basketball team and the
mountains of fresh powder in Tahoe are re
minding you why you chose Stanford, the
fact that so many classes are offered only in
winter quarter is driving your unit total up
and calling you back to your computer. For
some students, the unique opportunity af
forded by the unusually thick Winter Quar
ter Time Schedule beckons them to the
point that they consider extending them
selves beyond the typical 20-unit fare. But,
ever the Cal to your Big Game, the Regis
trar's Office is there to quickly snuff out any
ideas of dissent — after all, this is an aca
demic institution.
The issue of the 20-unit cap received a
bit of attention on these pages last au-

tumn. In typical Daily
debate style, an article
on Oct. 30, entitled "The
20-unit cap explained"
was published, a letter to
the editor was fired back
the next day, and finally
an editorial sought to
find the middle ground.
However, they pretty
much left the issue unre-

solved. In defending its position, the
Registrar's Office ottered up a series of
thin, easily refuted arguments as to why
the 20-unit cap was necessary.
These ranged from the fact that students
taking 25 units could not enjoy all that Stan
ford has to offer, to an economic argument
that the cost of unlimited enrollment and
early graduation would be unfeasible from
the University's perspective, with a claim
that students could not possibly study more
than 20 units in depth thrown into the mid
dle. In one of the finer letters to ever grace
the pages of The Daily, Joshua Kramer
punched holes in (he arguments of the
Registrar's Office as if he were Muhammad
Ali grimacing over the fallen Sonny Liston.
Kramer found it difficult to believe that a
university would have trouble with stu
dents maximizing the value of their tuition,
and pointed out the absurdity of Dandre
DeSandies' claim that there was not pres
sure on students to graduate early because
of Stanford's generous financial aid.
Stanford may have generous financial
aid, but that doesn't mean that every student
has an extra $20,000 or $30,000 lying
around for another year's tuition. In a post-
Enron world, students should be applauded

sands of dollars makes sense because some
