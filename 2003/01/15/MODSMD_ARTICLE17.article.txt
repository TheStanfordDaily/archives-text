Absence of 'disadvantaged students
reflects a much larger problem'
I am writing in response to the letter re
garding affirmative action in college ad
missions ("It's time to reevaluate affirma
tive action," Jan. 14, 2003).
I take issue with several points made,
but none more than the statement that,
"rather than benefiting 'disadvantaged
students,' affirmative action simply helps
minorities from middle- and upper-class
backgrounds. Thus, minority students
underperforming because of deficient sec
ondary schools receive no solace, and nu
merous qualified students are rejected on
arbitrary terms."
After reading this letter, I am left feel
ing extremely unsettled by it's implica
tions. First and foremost, it is crucial to
clarify that affirmative action is not a poli
cy that caters to under-qualified candidates
and rejects qualified applicants in order to
rectify past wrongs. Affirmative action
merely makes it possible to bring into con
sideration the racial background of a qual
ified applicant.
I find it curious that the use of race
through affirmative action comes under
heavy attack, while the long-practiced
policy of legacy admissions remains un
mentioned.
Race-conscious and legacy admissions
are similar in regard to the emphasis
placed on a non-academic aspect of a par
ticular applicant, yet the public does not
decry the process of considering the fam
ily background of legacy applicants, and
it does not call into question the qualifica
tions of the admitted legacy student.
While I am not criticizing legacy admis
sions, I wonder how the critics of affirma
tive action consistently fail to make the
same argument against legacies that they
are so willing to throw at race-conscious

admissions?
Furthermore, the absence of "disad
vantaged students" from campuses like
Stanford is a reflection of the much larg
er problems of educational inequity, lack
of access to resources and social capital in
"disadvantaged" communities.
This harsh reality should serve as a
wake-up call to those of us in the elite
academic bubble that the "playing
field" cannot be level when a significant
portion of students of color attend
schools that don't even have the fund
ing to be on the field. It should not,
however, be used as an excuse to end
race-conscious admissions at selective
institutions.
Lastly, to "expect fairness to result from
an admissions policy," goes against the re
ality of the college admissions process.
Who determines what qualifies as fair
ness? No admissions policy which admits
less than 15 percent of applicants will be
deemed "fair" by everyone.
It is the job of admissions officers to
select the incoming class out of countless
qualified applicants of every race, and
build a freshman class that reflects the
goals of the institution. As educators
William Bowen and Derek Bok state in
their 1998 study of race-based admis
sions titled "The Shape of the River,"
"other circumstances besides race can
cause disadvantages."
It would seem to us to be ironic indeed
— and wrong — if admissions officers
were permitted to consider all other fac
tors that help them identify individuals of
high potential who have had to overcome
obstacles, but were precluded from look
ing at an applicant's race.

'Affirmative action programs should
be preserved'
As a Stanford student, I have been for
tunate enough to experience the benefits
of diversity firsthand. Unfortunately, di
versity in higher education as a whole is
being threatened by the University of
Michigan affirmative action lawsuits that
are soon to be argued before the Supreme
Court. As reported in The Daily ("Bush
likely against UMichigan policy," Jan. 14,
2003), President Bush will likely oppose
Michigan's use of race preferences in ad
missions, despite former Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott's recent revelation of
his deeply principled support for affirma
tive action policies. These circumstances
underscore the peril that affirmative ac
tion is now facing.
Affirmative action programs should
be preserved for their educational value,
as a remedy for past discrimination, and
due to their benefits to society. Al
though Piotr Kosicki ("It's time to
reevaluate affirmative action," Jan. 14,
2003) cited research denying the effec
tiveness of race-based affirmative action
in his letter to the editor, many studies
performed by respected scholars paint a
different picture.
" I he Shape of the River," written by
two former Ivy League presidents, and ex
pert reports filed supporting Michigan's
claims in the lawsuits, some authored by
Profs. Claude Steele and A1 Camarillo of
Stanford, respectively testify to the benefi
cial educational outcomes enabled by af
firmative action, the racial disparities pre
sent in standardized testing, and the per
sistent legacies of racism in America.
These convincing empirical studies that
show that affirmative action can enhance
