# HIGH WATER RISING
## United States should revisit the death penalty 
### 
This past weekend, George Ryan,
the outgoing Republican gover
nor of Illinois — whose adminis
tration was previously distin
guished only by the scandals that pervaded
it — decided to commute the sentences of
167 inmates condemned to death. He is
sued outright pardons to four more.
In doing so, Ryan indefinitely extend
ed Illinois' three-year moratorium on
executions (unless incoming Democratic
governor Rod Blagojevich works to re
vive it, which is unlikely) effectively re
ducing the number of death penalty
states from 38 to 37.
Four days before, I sat down to take my
criminal law exam. Alter having endured
a week of three-page long fact patterns,
bleary-eyed and zonked on caffeine and
Advil, I somehow blundered my way
through essays about robbery and RICO.
You can imagine my relief when I arrived
at the last question, only one sentence
long: "If you could change anything about
the criminal law, what would it be?"
I guess Governor Ryan and I had simi
lar issues on our minds. The night before
my test, while trying to wind down, I read
an article in the New Yorker by Scott
Turow, the popular legal author; Turow
was appointed to Ryan's commission on
the death penalty, and ultimately reached
the conclusion that it should be abolished.
For most of my life, I would have dis
agreed. When I was 16, I addressed my

high school rhetoric class
(in Illinois, incidentally)
on the subject. In my
speech, I lauded the bene
fits of deterrent effects,
noted the agony suffered
by families of victims who
have to live with the reality
that someone who raped
their sister or murdered

their son is allowed to remain alive, and as
saulted the drain on taxpayer dollars.
But 1 have since learned that it's just not
that simple, or at least not across the
board. Studies have shown that victims'
families are not as comforted by execution
as one might think, that it costs more to
have the death penalty than abolish it, and
that it's not much of a deterrent.
More disturbingly, reputable research
has pointed out discriminatory practices
in death penalty cases. For example, a
study conducted by the New jersey
Supreme Court found that "there is unset
tling statistical evidence that cases involv
ing killers of white victims are more likely
to progress to a penalty phase than cases
involving the killers of African-American
victims." In the federal system, 80 percent
of death penalty cases between 1988 and
2000 involved racial minorities as defen
dants.
I am by no means convinced that every
one of these studies should be taken at face
value; but I am concerned that courts are

barred from considering them at all. In
the landmark case of McCleskey v. Kemp
(1987), the Supreme Court (whose deci
sions are binding in all other courts) opted
against construing death penalty laws —
including those which may promote or
allow discrimination — as unconstitution
al or in violation of due process. The court
declared that mere "results" of studies,
without evidence as to discriminatory in
tent, is insufficient to merit such a finding.
But the thing is, you can't really ever
discern a jury's intent in any way besides
analyzing their verdicts. Juries, unless ex
plicitly directed by a judge to do so, don't
have to explain themselves or how they
got to their ruling. In death penalty cases,
they have to consider aggravating and
mitigating factors in determining the de
fendant's fate; but we can never know iffor
a racist juror, an aggravating factor may
have simply been that the defendant killed
a white person or was himself a minority.
Even more disturbing than the poten
tial for discrimination is the possibility of
innocent killing. 1 have faith in the justice
system for the same reason I have faith in
our government as a whole.
The government has innumerable ve
hicles to check and balance the potential
misdeeds of other elements — not, to be
sure, because these systems are error-free.
In the justice system, there are appeals, re
versals, motions for dismissal, motions for
new trials, habeas petitions and the list

goes on. But in a death sentence, there's
no going back. Killing one innocent Amer
ican is too egregious to justify the execu
tions of 1000 rabid murderers.
Some states allow the death penalty
under the felony murder rule. Basically,
the felony murder rule states that indi
viduals who are involved in committing
crimes in which no murder was planned
but a death was precipitated, are liable
for the murder of the person. In many
states, the felony murder rule is punish
able by death.
For example, say two men commit a
robbery, and the police try to stop them.
Robber #1 shoots at cop #1, and cop #1
shoots back at bank robber #1, but acci
dentally kills his partner, cop #2. On
these facts, bank robber #2 — who never
fired a single shot — can be put to death
for an act that he never even contemplat
ed committing.
Finally, there's the notion of rehabilita
tion: Is it really fair, even from a retribu
tive perspective, to kill people because
they have killed others, even if those peo
ple stop being killers?
But then again, what about the snipers
and the terrorists? Who didn't breathe a
sigh of relief the day Tim McVeigh was
given a lethal injection? What about a man
Turow discusses, I lenry Brisbon, who
fired a shotgun into the vagina of an inno
cent woman and then killed a fellow pris
oner while in jail? Ifyou think like I do, not

killing these people bothers you enough to
shy away from eliminating the death
penalty altogether.
Here's what I suggest: Restrict the op
tion of execution to those who have com
mitted repeat capital offenses, using a
framework similar to California's three
strikes policy. If someone has killed three
times before initial arrest or kills after or
during a sentence fora previous capital
offense, they should be eligible for the
death penalty. Such people are unlikely
to be rehabilitated, and are certainly un
likely to be innocent.
For unlawful enemy combatants who
commit crimes against the United
States, the death penalty should stand
inviolate; but the threshold of guilt
should remain "beyond a reasonable
doubt," adjudicated in a "forum that en
sures fairness to the accused.
But for first-time offenders, some of
whom may never have even thought
about killing, the death penalty must go.
Hopefully, the recent decision in Illinois
will inspire more Americans — legislators
and citizens alike — to revisit their own
feelings.
