## LeBron James is on his way to Stanford 
### 
As I surfed through the
channels in the Twi
light Zone last night,
jumping back and
forth between Late Night with
Carrot Top and The Real
World Bakersfield, all stations

switched to a r
press confer
ence for high
school phenom
Leßron James.
I'm sure every
one reading
this already
knows what Le-
Bron said, es-

pecially since
KZSU was broadcasting it live,
but just in case, I've dedicated
an entire column to Leßron's
official statement:
"I have gathered all of you
thousands of national reporters
here today to announce that I
have decided not to enter the
NBA Draft. I know full well that
I am the undisputed No. 1 pick
for June's draft, but I am going
to put off the NBA for now and
follow my true dreams: I'm
going to Stanford University in
the fall.
America doesn't know much
about me at all— I really haven't
gotten much attention outside
my little town of Akron, Ohio.
But, as all my boys know, the
bling-bling of the NBA has
never been my No. 1 goal. I
want to be like Shane Battier
and Bill Bradley — real student
athletes.
Sure, the guaranteed mil
lions from the No. I pick's con
tract would be nice and the 20-
plus-million-dollar shoe deal
would be all good too. But none
of that compares to the thrill of
attending Stanford and step
ping out on that bouncy Maples
floor every night. Ever since I
saw "Blue Chips," I knew I
wanted to be like Neon Bodeaux
and go to a college with a crazy
20,000-seat arena just like
Maples. Madison Square Gar
den and Arco Arena don't have
nothing on Maples — that place
is just nuts.
The Yell Leaders get those
chants going, and there's just no
stopping them — those kooky
guys are really something else.

And, those Dollies. I see you
Dollies, shaking that ass, shaking
that ass. Those kinky white
gloves really do it for me too.
You can dismiss it as some weird
fetish, but whatever, it may have
been the x-factor — the Laker
Girls don't wear gloves, and
their outfits can't touch those lit
tle red dresses.
So I'm turning down a little
money. Everyone around me
has been making mad dough off
me since I turned 12, so what's
the problem with waiting four
more years to cash in myself.
Plus, I've gotten used to being
exploited for my game, and I
kind of like it. So what if I enjoy
acting like a whore whose pimp
keeps all of the money for him
self. Different strokes for differ
ent folks, I guess. Hopefully,
Stanford will sell boat loads of my
jersey without giving me a cent
and CBS' ratings of the Final
Four will go through the roof
with me as the star, giving the
NCAA billions of dollars that I'll
never see.
Now that I'm going to Stan
ford and not the NBA, obvious
ly I've got to return that $60,000
Hummer that my mom bought
me for my 18th birthday be
cause of those pesky NCAA
rules. But hopefully I'll be able
to score a job on campus at this
place called the CoHo and make
enough money to buy a '93
Camry by my sophomore year.
It won't have PS2, three televi
sion screens and 22-inch dubs,
but I don't really care about
being on MTV Cribs or any
thing like that. Honestly, what
18-year-old wants to roll like
Master P anyway? Plus, the
CoHo's actually the place to be.
Those open mic nights are
crazy, and there are fly CoHoes
everywhere.
Like most guys my age, three
somes with runway models and
NBA groupie chicks isn't my
thing anyway. At this point in my
life, I'm looking fora fly girl
that's smart and can dissect the
"Feminist Mystique" in a hot sec
ond. Just likeja Rule, I'm really
on the lookout fora "Down-Ass
Bitch," and from what I hear,


Ma< Levine
Stanford's just lull of them.
Some people have said that my
ego's too big now for me to lit in at
the college level, pointing at my
mouthguard that says King
James' on it. Well, let me say that
Leßron James is not egotistical,
and Leßron James is a team play
er. That whole King James thing
has nothing to do with me or any
kind of ego problem. Really it's
about my love for 17th century
British history and the whole
study of constitutional monarchy
in general. Also, there won't beany
ego-type problem fitting into
Coach Montgomery's system. We
should get along great anyway,
since lie's always loved the type of

llashy Showtime ball that I bring to
the table.
Not that I would mind being
king though. I hear that a couple
presidents and judges went to
Stanford, so 1 can probably be
king ill work hard enough. How
ever, I'll probably have to go to
the NBA for some royal training
after I win a couple champi
onships at Stanford. But while
I'm at Stanford, with me and
Casey Jacobsen in the backcourt,
and Mark Madsen, Curtis Bor
chardt and one of those Collins
guys up front, we should be un
stoppable. College is really going
to be a blast. I can't wait."
