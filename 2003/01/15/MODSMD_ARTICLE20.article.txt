# Card goes for three in a row

Stanford women's tennis head coach
Lele Forood has been involved with the
program long enough to grow accustomed
to seeing the Cardinal at the top of the na
tional rankings.
So it probably wasn't too much of a sur
prise to her and her players on Monday
when Stanford was sitting atop the ITA
preseason poll for the fourth straight year
— especially after the Cardinal landed its
second straight NCAA title, its 12th overall,
last season.
Stanford received 20 out of 33 first
place votes fora total of 1,715 points, just
edging No. 2 Florida, which received six
first-place votes and 1,702 overall points.
But despite starting the year with the
nation's top ranking, the team is by no
means celebrating. Besides the normal rig
ors and uncertainties of a long season,
Forood's squad knows it will face stiff com
petition in its own league in its quest to win
its third straight national championship.
The always talented Pacific-10 Confer
ence is as formidable as ever, with seven
teams in the top 25, including Arizona
State at No. 0 and archrival California at
No. 10. Pac-10 teams actually comprise half
of the top 10 slots in the ITA poll.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal possesses
enough talent to counter any opponent,
with two returning All-Americans at the
helm, junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Frin Burdette. A strong freshman
class, which includes fall-season sensations
Amber Liu and Alice Barnes, will also bol
ster Stanford's chance of winning its 13th
NCAA title.
In the individual polls, which were also
released on Monday, four Stanford women

placed in the top 30: Barnes at No. 13, Liu
at No. 17, Barnikow at No. 25 and Bur
dette at No. 30.
In doubles, the team of Barnikow and
Burdette is ranked No. 8.
As is evident in the rankings, Forood's
second year at the helm of the team has the
potential to be as successful as her first.
Forood was the team's assistant coach
for 10 years under former head coach
Frank Brennan before becoming associ
ate head coach in the spring of 2000. She
took over control from Brennan the fol
lowing year.
Since Brennan was both her junior
coach and her mentor as a head coach,
Forood admits that there are some similar
ities in t heir styles of coaching.
"Since he was my junior coach, a lot of
our thinking on style and teaching is cer
tainly similar," Forood said. "Certainly as
sistant coaching under him for so many
years, a lot of what we do has been retained,
format-wise. We've made some changes to
practice, especially this year, but a lot of it is
a carryover because he was hugely success
ful for all those years — so we haven't made
a lot of radical changes to that."
Even so, Forood is following her own
path to success and certainly has emerged
out of Brennan's shadow.
Forood is quick to acknowledge her pre
decessor, however.
"The school and the program have a
reputation," she said, "because some peo
ple want to go to a school this difficult and
play on a championship team. So I think it
successfully builds upon itself."
One aspect that contributes to Forood's
coaching knowledge and success is her his
tory. She played tennis for Stanford in the
