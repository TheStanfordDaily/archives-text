# Card goes for three in a row
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's tennis head coach
Lele Forood has been involved with the
program long enough to grow accustomed
to seeing the Cardinal at the top of the na
tional rankings.
So it probably wasn't too much of a sur
prise to her and her players on Monday
when Stanford was sitting atop the ITA
preseason poll for the fourth straight year
— especially after the Cardinal landed its
second straight NCAA title, its 12th overall,
last season.
Stanford received 20 out of 33 first
place votes fora total of 1,715 points, just
edging No. 2 Florida, which received six
first-place votes and 1,702 overall points.
But despite starting the year with the
nation's top ranking, the team is by no
means celebrating. Besides the normal rig
ors and uncertainties of a long season,
Forood's squad knows it will face stiff com
petition in its own league in its quest to win
its third straight national championship.
The always talented Pacific-10 Confer
ence is as formidable as ever, with seven
teams in the top 25, including Arizona
State at No. 0 and archrival California at
No. 10. Pac-10 teams actually comprise half
of the top 10 slots in the ITA poll.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal possesses
enough talent to counter any opponent,
with two returning All-Americans at the
helm, junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Frin Burdette. A strong freshman
class, which includes fall-season sensations
Amber Liu and Alice Barnes, will also bol
ster Stanford's chance of winning its 13th
NCAA title.
In the individual polls, which were also
released on Monday, four Stanford women

placed in the top 30: Barnes at No. 13, Liu
at No. 17, Barnikow at No. 25 and Bur
dette at No. 30.
In doubles, the team of Barnikow and
Burdette is ranked No. 8.
As is evident in the rankings, Forood's
second year at the helm of the team has the
potential to be as successful as her first.
Forood was the team's assistant coach
for 10 years under former head coach
Frank Brennan before becoming associ
ate head coach in the spring of 2000. She
took over control from Brennan the fol
lowing year.
Since Brennan was both her junior
coach and her mentor as a head coach,
Forood admits that there are some similar
ities in t heir styles of coaching.
"Since he was my junior coach, a lot of
our thinking on style and teaching is cer
tainly similar," Forood said. "Certainly as
sistant coaching under him for so many
years, a lot of what we do has been retained,
format-wise. We've made some changes to
practice, especially this year, but a lot of it is
a carryover because he was hugely success
ful for all those years — so we haven't made
a lot of radical changes to that."
Even so, Forood is following her own
path to success and certainly has emerged
out of Brennan's shadow.
Forood is quick to acknowledge her pre
decessor, however.
"The school and the program have a
reputation," she said, "because some peo
ple want to go to a school this difficult and
play on a championship team. So I think it
successfully builds upon itself."
One aspect that contributes to Forood's
coaching knowledge and success is her his
tory. She played tennis for Stanford in the

No. 1 ranking after winning two straight NCAA team titles.
19705, attaining All-America sta
tus in 1976. That past allows her
to relate to her players on a very
credible level.
"It makes me aware of the re
alities of going to school here
and playing tennis," Forood
said. "I know exactly what peo
ple are going through when they
come to me and say, '1 have a
midterm and two papers due the
next day, and I can't concentrate
at practice.' So 1 tell them to hit
for an hour and then get work
done."
Although she does allow some
leeway, Forood will not permit a
dropoff in effort from her players.
"I also know that you can suc
ceed at both, so I know [a balance]
can be done," she said.
Additionally, Forood has par
ticipated in many WTA events,
helping to organize and promote
certain pro tournaments.
"Not only have I been on the
circuit, but I also know the ins and
outs of running a professional
tournament. To our recruits, the
knowledge is good," she said.
Her knowledge has been in
valuable in both attracting top

players and instructing them on
what to expect once they make it
to the pro tour. As a result, there
are currently four Stanford grad
uates ranked among the top 100
players in the world.
Statistics like that — rather
than numbers like winning per
centage (she is 57-1 as a head
coach) — are what really make
Forood's job fulfilling.
"I have to gauge when some
body leaves whether they are a
better player than when they
came," Forood said. "And that is
really important to me because
we're in the business of trying to
win championships, but we also
have to develop players just be
cause we're coaches."
Although winning champi
onships is very exciting and satis
lying, it would be misguided to ig
nore the needs of the individual
players, according to Forood.
"So I really try to take a look at
whether were helpful in the de
velopment of our players, espe
cially those that want to play pro
fessionally," Forood said.
Forood will continue her mis
sion of player development this
year as Stanford pursues its 13th
national title. With Barnikow and
Burdette leading the way, and a
fresh crop of new talent on board,
it's more than a possibility.

its third straight national championship.
The always talented Pacific-10 Confer
ence is as formidable as ever, with seven
teams in the top 25, including Arizona
State at No. 0 and archrival California at
No. 10. Pac-10 teams actually comprise half
of the top 10 slots in the ITA poll.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal possesses
enough talent to counter any opponent,
with two returning All-Americans at the
helm, junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Frin Burdette. A strong freshman
class, which includes fall-season sensations
Amber Liu and Alice Barnes, will also bol
ster Stanford's chance of winning its 13th
NCAA title.
In the individual polls, which were also
released on Monday, four Stanford women

placed in the top 30: Barnes at No. 13, Liu
at No. 17, Barnikow at No. 25 and Bur
dette at No. 30.
In doubles, the team of Barnikow and
Burdette is ranked No. 8.
As is evident in the rankings, Forood's
second year at the helm of the team has the
potential to be as successful as her first.
Forood was the team's assistant coach
for 10 years under former head coach
Frank Brennan before becoming associ
ate head coach in the spring of 2000. She
took over control from Brennan the fol
lowing year.
Since Brennan was both her junior
coach and her mentor as a head coach,
Forood admits that there are some similar
ities in t heir styles of coaching.
"Since he was my junior coach, a lot of
our thinking on style and teaching is cer
tainly similar," Forood said. "Certainly as
sistant coaching under him for so many
years, a lot of what we do has been retained,
format-wise. We've made some changes to
practice, especially this year, but a lot of it is
a carryover because he was hugely success
ful for all those years — so we haven't made
a lot of radical changes to that."
Even so, Forood is following her own
path to success and certainly has emerged
out of Brennan's shadow.
Forood is quick to acknowledge her pre
decessor, however.
"The school and the program have a
reputation," she said, "because some peo
ple want to go to a school this difficult and
play on a championship team. So I think it
successfully builds upon itself."
One aspect that contributes to Forood's
coaching knowledge and success is her his
tory. She played tennis for Stanford in the

No. 1 ranking after winning two straight NCAA team titles.
19705, attaining All-America sta
tus in 1976. That past allows her
to relate to her players on a very
credible level.
"It makes me aware of the re
alities of going to school here
and playing tennis," Forood
said. "I know exactly what peo
ple are going through when they
come to me and say, '1 have a
midterm and two papers due the
next day, and I can't concentrate
at practice.' So 1 tell them to hit
for an hour and then get work
done."
Although she does allow some
leeway, Forood will not permit a
dropoff in effort from her players.
"I also know that you can suc
ceed at both, so I know [a balance]
can be done," she said.
Additionally, Forood has par
ticipated in many WTA events,
helping to organize and promote
certain pro tournaments.
"Not only have I been on the
circuit, but I also know the ins and
outs of running a professional
tournament. To our recruits, the
knowledge is good," she said.
Her knowledge has been in
valuable in both attracting top

players and instructing them on
what to expect once they make it
to the pro tour. As a result, there
are currently four Stanford grad
uates ranked among the top 100
players in the world.
Statistics like that — rather
than numbers like winning per
centage (she is 57-1 as a head
coach) — are what really make
Forood's job fulfilling.
"I have to gauge when some
body leaves whether they are a
better player than when they
came," Forood said. "And that is
really important to me because
we're in the business of trying to
win championships, but we also
have to develop players just be
cause we're coaches."
Although winning champi
onships is very exciting and satis
lying, it would be misguided to ig
nore the needs of the individual
players, according to Forood.
"So I really try to take a look at
whether were helpful in the de
velopment of our players, espe
cially those that want to play pro
fessionally," Forood said.
Forood will continue her mis
sion of player development this
year as Stanford pursues its 13th
national title. With Barnikow and
Burdette leading the way, and a
fresh crop of new talent on board,
it's more than a possibility.
Stanford women's tennis head coach
Lele Forood has been involved with the
program long enough to grow accustomed
to seeing the Cardinal at the top of the na
tional rankings.
So it probably wasn't too much of a sur
prise to her and her players on Monday
when Stanford was sitting atop the ITA
preseason poll for the fourth straight year
— especially after the Cardinal landed its
second straight NCAA title, its 12th overall,
last season.
Stanford received 20 out of 33 first
place votes fora total of 1,715 points, just
edging No. 2 Florida, which received six
first-place votes and 1,702 overall points.
But despite starting the year with the
nation's top ranking, the team is by no
means celebrating. Besides the normal rig
ors and uncertainties of a long season,
Forood's squad knows it will face stiff com
petition in its own league in its quest to win
its third straight national championship.
