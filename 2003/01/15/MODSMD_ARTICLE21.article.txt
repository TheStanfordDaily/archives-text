# Cardinal tennis looks to regain title
## 
### CHRIS MEYER 
Since Dick Gould became the
head coach of the Stanford men's
tennis team 37 years ago, he's cre
ated a dynasty that has lasted
longer than any other in the history
of collegiate athletics.
Gould's teams have won 17
NCAA team championships while
producing 13 NCAA singles cham
pions and 13 NCAA doubles cham
pions.
But the Cardinal has failed to
win an NCAA team championship
the past two years. And while the
Stanford squad has a rich legacy
behind it, its history would be of lit
tle solace should a third title-less
year ensue.
So can this year's edition of the
nation's greatest tennis program
end the drought and win national
championship No. 18?
History says it can. The last three
times Stanford failed to win NCAA
championships in consecutive
years, the Cardinal came back to
win the title in the third year (1977,
1986, 1995).
"Yes, I do think we can win [the
NCAA team championship]. We're
definitely a top-five team," Gould
said. "We're in the hunt. We cer
tainly hope to prove that we're one
of the favorites, but we still have to
prove that. But I have every confi
dence in this team. I like everything
about us so far."
"I expect us to have a really, re
ally good season," saicl senior Scott
Lipsky, ranked 47th in the presea
son singles poll. "I'm very excited
about the year. Practices have
been going really well, and we've
got a lot of really talented people.
We have the potential to do as
much as we want."
A trio of All-American seniors
coming off strong 2001-2002 sea

sons leads this year's squad.
Both David Martin and Ryan
Haviland reached the singles semi
finals at the NCAA Championships
last May in Athens, Ga., while Mar
tin and Lipsky were (lie NCAA
doubles runners-up.
The three seniors should find
themselves at the top of the lineup
this year, although their exact
order remains uncertain. All will be
in contention to replace All-Ameri
can K.J. Hippensteel, the team's
most significant loss from last year,
at the No. 1 spot.
"While we don't have a domi
nant No. 1 player, we have several
players who have proven they can
do the job," Gould said. "Whomev
er finally settles into this position
will have to be consistently ready to
play at the highest level. I honestly
believe we will end the year as
strong at the No. 1 position as we
are at all the other lineup slots."
The rest of the lineup looks to
provide as solid a supporting cast as
any team in the country can boast.
Junior Carter Morris returns to
the team after missing last year's en

Sophomore Sam Warburg is
coming off an outstanding fresh
man year in which he became one
of only a handful of players in Stan
ford history to record a 20-win sea
son in dual matches.
Sophomore Phil Sheng was a
solid starter last season, and junior
Joe Kao, who filled in when the
team was beset with injuries, also
accumulated a winning record.
Two talented freshmen have
also been added to the mix.

rived on the Farm this year after
achieving a ranking among the top
500 players in the world.
James Pade will also be making
his debut at Stanford this year, and
he too boasts an impressive re
sume on his arrival. Last year, he
won the 18rand-under national
clay-court championships in sin
gles and doubles.
With all the talent Could has
on his roster, the order of the line
up for the dual-match season is,
not surprisingly, far from being
decided.
The Cardinal's first dual match
takes place at California on Feb. I.
The lineup for that match will be
decided based on the results of the
National Collegiate Classic this
weekend and intrasquad challenge
matches in the upcoming weeks.
"With this team, it's really im
portant that we move guys
around and give everyone a
chance to play," Gould said.
"We're very deep. I believe we

have six players capable of win
ning an NCAA singles 01 doubles
championship at some point din -
ing their Stanford careers."
The Cardinal landed at No. 4 in
the preseason rankings released on
Monday, coming in behind UCI A,
Illinois and Baylor.
Those rankings were based in
part on how teams fared during the
fall tournament season.
The Cardinal's best fall results
were in doubles. Martin and Lip
sky, currently ranked third in the
country, proved last year's NCAA
finals appearance was no lluke.
They reached the semifinals of the
two "major" fall college tourna
ments, the ICY HOT/ITA All-
American Championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn., and the Omni Na
tional Indoors in Dallas, Texas.
Corkery and Pade notched
their first tournament win when
they defeated teammates Warburg
and Morris to win the Omni re
gional doubles championships to
earn a berth to the national tour
nament in Dallas. The freshman
duo was rewarded with a No. 9 na
tional ranking.
In singles competition, Martin,

ranked 15th in the preseason poll,
notched the most victories during
the fall campaign with 10. He lost in
the first round at the Ail-Americans,
but rebounded to win the consola
tion draw.
No. 50 Corkery and No. 52
Warburg followed close behind
Martin, with each winning seven
singles matches during the fall.
Corkery went through qualifying
to reach the main draw of the All-
American Championships, while
Warburg won the Racquet Club
Collegiate Invitational in Midland,
Texas, in October.
Haviland took fall quarter oil to
compete professionally, which
bodes well fora strong senior cam
paign out of him.
This year's squad obviously has
talent and depth, but what will it
take for them to bring a record 18th
NCAA trophy back to the Farm
four months from now?
"If we're going to win N(L<\As as
a team this year, we need to put all
individual goals aside and work off
each other as much as possible,"
Lipsky said. "The individual stuff
will come by itself. It's going to take
a lot of hard work and sacrifice."

Morris echoed Lipsky's
thoughts, "We need to be able to
compete against each other without
it leading to conflict. If we can do
(hat, everybody should improve as
the season goes along. We need to
light pretty hard against each other
but still stay together."
One of the keys to any successful
year is avoiding the injuries that
plagued the squad last year, even
tually resulting in one of Stanford's
eai liest-ever exits from the NCAA
tournament.
The Cardinal has avoided major
injury thus far, though Haviland
has a sore knee, and Warburg is re
covering from an ankle injury he
sustained during practice in late
November.
According to Gould, the Cardi
nal's strongest rivals for the NCAA
team title are Cal, UCLA, Baylor
and Illinois.
First, the Cardinal must get
through a treacherous Pacific-10
Conference, which will be especial
ly formidable this year with Wash
ington and defending NCAA
champion Southern California also
fielding strong teams in addition to
the Bruins and Bears.

Since Dick Gould became the
head coach of the Stanford men's
tennis team 37 years ago, he's cre
ated a dynasty that has lasted
longer than any other in the history
of collegiate athletics.
Gould's teams have won 17
NCAA team championships while
producing 13 NCAA singles cham
pions and 13 NCAA doubles cham
pions.
But the Cardinal has failed to
win an NCAA team championship
the past two years. And while the
Stanford squad has a rich legacy
behind it, its history would be of lit
tle solace should a third title-less
year ensue.
So can this year's edition of the
nation's greatest tennis program
end the drought and win national
championship No. 18?
History says it can. The last three
times Stanford failed to win NCAA
championships in consecutive
years, the Cardinal came back to
win the title in the third year (1977,
1986, 1995).
"Yes, I do think we can win [the
NCAA team championship]. We're
definitely a top-five team," Gould
said. "We're in the hunt. We cer
tainly hope to prove that we're one
of the favorites, but we still have to
prove that. But I have every confi
dence in this team. I like everything
about us so far."
"I expect us to have a really, re
ally good season," saicl senior Scott
Lipsky, ranked 47th in the presea
son singles poll. "I'm very excited
about the year. Practices have
been going really well, and we've
got a lot of really talented people.
We have the potential to do as
much as we want."
A trio of All-American seniors
coming off strong 2001-2002 sea

sons leads this year's squad.
Both David Martin and Ryan
Haviland reached the singles semi
finals at the NCAA Championships
last May in Athens, Ga., while Mar
tin and Lipsky were (lie NCAA
doubles runners-up.
The three seniors should find
themselves at the top of the lineup
this year, although their exact
order remains uncertain. All will be
in contention to replace All-Ameri
can K.J. Hippensteel, the team's
most significant loss from last year,
at the No. 1 spot.
"While we don't have a domi
nant No. 1 player, we have several
players who have proven they can
do the job," Gould said. "Whomev
er finally settles into this position
will have to be consistently ready to
play at the highest level. I honestly
believe we will end the year as
strong at the No. 1 position as we
are at all the other lineup slots."
The rest of the lineup looks to
provide as solid a supporting cast as
any team in the country can boast.
Junior Carter Morris returns to

Sophomore Sam Warburg is

Sophomore Phil Sheng was a

team was beset with injuries, also
accumulated a winning record.

rived on the Farm this year after
achieving a ranking among the top
500 players in the world.
James Pade will also be making
his debut at Stanford this year, and
he too boasts an impressive re
sume on his arrival. Last year, he
won the 18rand-under national
clay-court championships in sin
gles and doubles.
With all the talent Could has
on his roster, the order of the line
up for the dual-match season is,
not surprisingly, far from being
decided.
The Cardinal's first dual match
takes place at California on Feb. I.
The lineup for that match will be
decided based on the results of the
National Collegiate Classic this
weekend and intrasquad challenge
matches in the upcoming weeks.
"With this team, it's really im
portant that we move guys
around and give everyone a
chance to play," Gould said.
"We're very deep. I believe we

have six players capable of win
ning an NCAA singles 01 doubles
championship at some point din -
ing their Stanford careers."
The Cardinal landed at No. 4 in
the preseason rankings released on
Monday, coming in behind UCI A,
Illinois and Baylor.
Those rankings were based in
part on how teams fared during the
fall tournament season.
The Cardinal's best fall results
were in doubles. Martin and Lip
sky, currently ranked third in the
country, proved last year's NCAA
finals appearance was no lluke.
They reached the semifinals of the
two "major" fall college tourna
ments, the ICY HOT/ITA All-
American Championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn., and the Omni Na
tional Indoors in Dallas, Texas.
Corkery and Pade notched
their first tournament win when
they defeated teammates Warburg
and Morris to win the Omni re
gional doubles championships to
earn a berth to the national tour
nament in Dallas. The freshman
duo was rewarded with a No. 9 na
tional ranking.
In singles competition, Martin,

ranked 15th in the preseason poll,
notched the most victories during
the fall campaign with 10. He lost in
the first round at the Ail-Americans,
but rebounded to win the consola
tion draw.
No. 50 Corkery and No. 52
Warburg followed close behind
Martin, with each winning seven
singles matches during the fall.
Corkery went through qualifying
to reach the main draw of the All-
American Championships, while
Warburg won the Racquet Club
Collegiate Invitational in Midland,
Texas, in October.
Haviland took fall quarter oil to
compete professionally, which
bodes well fora strong senior cam
paign out of him.
This year's squad obviously has
talent and depth, but what will it
take for them to bring a record 18th
NCAA trophy back to the Farm
four months from now?
"If we're going to win N(L<\As as
a team this year, we need to put all
individual goals aside and work off
each other as much as possible,"
Lipsky said. "The individual stuff
will come by itself. It's going to take
a lot of hard work and sacrifice."

Morris echoed Lipsky's
thoughts, "We need to be able to
compete against each other without
it leading to conflict. If we can do
(hat, everybody should improve as
the season goes along. We need to
light pretty hard against each other
but still stay together."
One of the keys to any successful
year is avoiding the injuries that
plagued the squad last year, even
tually resulting in one of Stanford's
eai liest-ever exits from the NCAA
tournament.
The Cardinal has avoided major
injury thus far, though Haviland
has a sore knee, and Warburg is re
covering from an ankle injury he
sustained during practice in late
November.
