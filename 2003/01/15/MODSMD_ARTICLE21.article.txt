# Cardinal tennis looks to regain title
## 
### CHRIS MEYER 
Since Dick Gould became the
head coach of the Stanford men's
tennis team 37 years ago, he's cre
ated a dynasty that has lasted
longer than any other in the history
of collegiate athletics.
Gould's teams have won 17
NCAA team championships while
producing 13 NCAA singles cham
pions and 13 NCAA doubles cham
pions.
But the Cardinal has failed to
win an NCAA team championship
the past two years. And while the
Stanford squad has a rich legacy
behind it, its history would be of lit
tle solace should a third title-less
year ensue.
So can this year's edition of the
nation's greatest tennis program
end the drought and win national
championship No. 18?
History says it can. The last three
times Stanford failed to win NCAA
championships in consecutive
years, the Cardinal came back to
win the title in the third year (1977,
1986, 1995).
"Yes, I do think we can win [the
NCAA team championship]. We're
definitely a top-five team," Gould
said. "We're in the hunt. We cer
tainly hope to prove that we're one
of the favorites, but we still have to
prove that. But I have every confi
dence in this team. I like everything
about us so far."
"I expect us to have a really, re
ally good season," saicl senior Scott
Lipsky, ranked 47th in the presea
son singles poll. "I'm very excited
about the year. Practices have
been going really well, and we've
got a lot of really talented people.
We have the potential to do as
much as we want."
A trio of All-American seniors
coming off strong 2001-2002 sea

sons leads this year's squad.
Both David Martin and Ryan
Haviland reached the singles semi
finals at the NCAA Championships
last May in Athens, Ga., while Mar
tin and Lipsky were (lie NCAA
doubles runners-up.
The three seniors should find
themselves at the top of the lineup
this year, although their exact
order remains uncertain. All will be
in contention to replace All-Ameri
can K.J. Hippensteel, the team's
most significant loss from last year,
at the No. 1 spot.
"While we don't have a domi
nant No. 1 player, we have several
players who have proven they can
do the job," Gould said. "Whomev
er finally settles into this position
will have to be consistently ready to
play at the highest level. I honestly
believe we will end the year as
strong at the No. 1 position as we
are at all the other lineup slots."
The rest of the lineup looks to
provide as solid a supporting cast as
any team in the country can boast.
Junior Carter Morris returns to
the team after missing last year's en
tire dual-match season due to a se
vere case of mononucleosis.
Sophomore Sam Warburg is
coming off an outstanding fresh
man year in which he became one
of only a handful of players in Stan
ford history to record a 20-win sea
son in dual matches.
Sophomore Phil Sheng was a
solid starter last season, and junior
Joe Kao, who filled in when the
team was beset with injuries, also
accumulated a winning record.
Two talented freshmen have
also been added to the mix.

to play professionally on the ATP
tour as an amateur. He finally ar
