# Harris leaves Farm early for NFL Draft
## Offensive lineman departs after award-winning junior season 
### MAC LEVINE EDITORIAL STAFF 
Junior offensive lineman Kwame Harris an
nounced yesterday that he will forgo his senior
season and enter April's NFL Draft.
Harris, a 6-foot-7, 308-pound right tackle, is
coming off an outstanding junior year in which
he was a first-team Pacific-10 Conference selec
tion and winner of the 2002 Morris Trophy as the

top lineman in the conference.
"I have spent many sleepless
nights wondering if my decision
to leave Stanford is the right
one," Harris said, "and al
though there is no clear-cut
method of coming to an answer,
my heart yearns for the chal
lenges of the NFL."
Harris, 20, is regarded by

many experts as one of the top offensive linemen
in the draft, after starting each of the Cardinal's
23 games during the 2001 and 2002 campaigns.
Harris arrived on the Farm in the fall of

2000 from Newark, Del., as one of the top re
cruits in the nation, and lie did not disap
point at all.
Since moving into the starting lineup at the
start of 2001, Harris has been a fixture at right
tackle for Stanford — and one of the few bright
spots in this year's otherwise dreary 2-9 season.
Harris is now the second Cardinal under
classman to declare for the draft, as redshirt
sophomore wide receiver Teyo Johnson an
nounced his decision to leave earlier this month.
Before this season, only one Stanford un
derclassman had ever left school early for the
draft, Bob Whitfield in 1991.
