# Social dance, X-Games and the Great Outdoors
## 
### 
I've been blessed this quarter
with a weekly schedule the likes
of which I had heard rumors
about, but had never experi
enced myself: the four-day weekend.
That's right. Freshmen, take
notes. I have classes Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays. But
from 6:00 p.m. Thursday until 9:00
a.m. Tuesday, I'm on my own time.

So, like any good Daily sports columnist, I'm
thinking that I can spend my newfound free time re
searching possible topics, fact checking, interviewing
and editing. I could come up with great storylines; I
could create a running theme for this space like Brian
Murphy's "Monday Water Cooler" on ESPN Page 2
(At the very least, I could come up with a name for
this column — everybody else has one). I could tack
le the hard stories, the ones all the other writers shy
away from, the ones that require real investigative
journalism, where you have to ask the hard questions
and be ready for any kind of answer.
Or I can just swoop on one of those $219 student
passes and ski four days a week at Kirkwood.
You make the call.
Fora while I thought about filling out my sched
ule with those alternative athletic classes that seem to
be all the rage now. Yes, I already get a unit for play
ing with the men's ultimate frisbee team, but I
thought maybe I should pick up another one doing
something in Roble Gym. I remember when I was a
freshman, there was yoga, social dance — and that
was about it. Now I could get units for yoga, pilates,
kickboxing, cardio kickboxing, ballet, social dance,

break dance, swing dance, salsa
dance, capoiera, tai chi, tae bo, tai
my shu, whatever. 1 think those
classes get more money than half
of the language departments on
campus.
Now before everybody gets up
in arms, this is not a knock on those
classes at all. 1 think they're great.
My high school friends are incred
ibly jealous that I can take athletics
outdoors, in January, for credit.
And if I had ever gotten into a golf
class, I certainly would have taken
one. Probably tennis too, if I had
ever had room in my schedule.
And if the lake litis up erynigh this
spring (it's looking good so far) I'm
going to be all over windsurfing
classes like an EE grad student at a
bike helmet sale.
Hut until that day, I'm going to
have to find other alternative ath
letic activities to occupy my free
time. I tried to pick up a lew ideas
from watching television this
week, having the good fortune to
catch late night X-Games, World's
Strongest Man and Great Out
door Games marathons on
ESPN2. So right now my options
include snowmobile racing, tire

Hipping, keg tossing and teaching
a black lab bow to jump 38 feet
alter a fake Hying cluck.
Snowmobile racing was elimi
nated alter 1 witnessed one horrif
ic crash on the last jump of the
course. I don't want to be racing
along only to look up at the tread
of an Arctic Cat descending on me
from above, preparing to re
arrange my face.
World's Strongest Man is cer
tainly eliminated, too. While 1
used to flip tires fora job, I'm not
going to spend my days training
by pulling semi-trucks and air
planes. Not to mention the fact
that I weigh as much as one of
Magnus ver Magnusson's legs.
So it looks like the Great Out
door Games is the only one I can
train for. Yeah, it'll take some time
and practice — but hey, that's
what I have.
I remember seeing golden re
triever puppies on su.market just
a few weeks ago. Maybe there's
one left. If I get started now, by the
spring, I'm sure I can teach him to
jump off of my windsurf board.
