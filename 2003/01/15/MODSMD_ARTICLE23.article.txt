# Social dance, X-Games and the Great Outdoors
## 
### 
I've been blessed this quarter
with a weekly schedule the likes
of which I had heard rumors
about, but had never experi
enced myself: the four-day weekend.
That's right. Freshmen, take
notes. I have classes Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays. But
from 6:00 p.m. Thursday until 9:00
a.m. Tuesday, I'm on my own time.

So, like any good Daily sports columnist, I'm
thinking that I can spend my newfound free time re
searching possible topics, fact checking, interviewing
and editing. I could come up with great storylines; I
could create a running theme for this space like Brian
Murphy's "Monday Water Cooler" on ESPN Page 2
(At the very least, I could come up with a name for
this column — everybody else has one). I could tack
le the hard stories, the ones all the other writers shy
away from, the ones that require real investigative
journalism, where you have to ask the hard questions
and be ready for any kind of answer.
Or I can just swoop on one of those $219 student
passes and ski four days a week at Kirkwood.
You make the call.
Fora while I thought about filling out my sched
ule with those alternative athletic classes that seem to
be all the rage now. Yes, I already get a unit for play
ing with the men's ultimate frisbee team, but I
thought maybe I should pick up another one doing
something in Roble Gym. I remember when I was a
freshman, there was yoga, social dance — and that
was about it. Now I could get units for yoga, pilates,
kickboxing, cardio kickboxing, ballet, social dance,
