## Scientists say life began in space 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
A few astronomers have proposed that life on
earth did not originate from a primordial soup, but
rather from particles from space. The theory is called
panspermia, and in recent months, scientists have
found more evidence in support of it. A NASA study
published last November suggested that bacterial
particles could survive entry into the atmosphere. In
addition, data from past Leonid meteor showers show
that comet dust can harbor the seeds of life. The 1999
Leonids possessed traces of organic matter that en
dured 55 kilometers above the earth's surface.
Two English scientists have demonstrated that
the feeling of disgust is generated in its own location
of the brain, separate from the locales for fear or

anger. A psychiatrist and a neurophysiologist showed
their subjects various scenes to elicit different emo
tions and then used magnetic resonance imaging to
observe their brain activity. The discovery opens
many doors for future study as disgust is one of the
least understood emotions. Scientists have argued
that it has evolutionary benefits — those who dis
played disgust at dirty water were more likely not to
drink it and survive, thus enabling them to pass on
their genes to their descendants.
The oil tanker Prestige sank off the coast of Spain
Nov. 15, taking most of its 20 million gallons of oil to
the ocean floor. Conservationists fear the oil spill may
cause several endangered bird species to go extinct.
Oil destroys the waterproofing in birds' plumage and
also leaves them with no protection against cold
weather. Within a week of the spill, more than 250 oil
soaked birds were collected and treated.
For the first time ever, researchers at University
College London have developed three-dimensional
images of the brains of newborns. The scientists use
a technique that integrates light signals over a period
of many seconds to attain images with greater depth.
