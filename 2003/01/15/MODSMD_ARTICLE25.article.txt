# Cloned pig could aid transplants

WELLINGTON, New Zealand
(AP) — An American gene re
searcher said he has cloned a
miniature pig in a development he
called a major step toward trans
planting pig organs into humans.
Randall Prather, a professor at
the University of Missouri-Colum
bia, announced Monday that he
has cloned a miniature pig —
without the gene that has kept
doctors from successfully trans
planting pig organs into humans.
Pigs are potential human life
savers because they are physiolog
ically similar to people and more
plentiful than nonhuman pri
mates, such as baboons.
However, pigs are born with a
gene that coats their organs with a
sugar molecule, called a-1,3-galac
tosyltransferase or GGTAI, which
triggers organ rejection when

transplanted into humans.
Prather told the International
Embryo Transfer Society in Auck
land that the cloning process for
his female pig, "Goldie," born
Nov. 18 in Columbia, Missouri,
blocked both copies of the gene.
"We have only one (pig) living
which has both gene copies modi
fied so they're nonfunctional,"
Prather, a professor of reproduc
tive biotechnology, told The Asso
ciated Press by telephone.
He said checks of the pig's cells
confirmed that both copies of the
gene producing GGTAI "have
been knocked out."
Prather said the work still must
be reviewed by independent sci
entists. He is writing up the results
for publication in a science jour
nal. But he called Goldie's birth
"the first step through the brick

wall" separating scientists and
doctors from transplanting pig or
gans into humans, known as xeno
transplantation.
Dr. David Cooper, professor of
surgery at Harvard Medical
School and a former president of
the International Xenotransplan
tation Association, called the de
velopment "a very important step
forward." Goldie's birth means
"we're well on the way to consid
ering a clinical trial of xenotrans
plantation of pig organs into hu
mans" within three years or so, he
said Tuesday from Massachusetts.
Overcoming the body's massive
immune response after it per
ceives a foreign organ is one of the
greatest hurdles to animal-to
human organ transplants.
Without the sugar, the antibod
ies can't attach, and therefore the
rejection process can't begin,
Prather said.
He anticipated other rejection
problems to emerge as the work
develops. Cooper noted that
miniature pigs have been studied
intensively for 25 years.
"We know a lot about their tis
sue typing and because of that, I
think it puts us in a much stronger
position to deal with any problems
that will come in the future," he
said by telephone.
Julia Greenstein, chief execu
tive of Immerge Bio Therapeutics
Inc., a Massachusetts firm that
sponsored Prather's project, called
Goldie a "biological break
through." Cooper also has worked
with Immerge as a consultant.
Prather and Immerge an

nounced a year ago in the journal
Science that they had successfully
cloned the world's first single
knock-out miniature swine. The
genetic material from these swine
was then re-engineered to knock
out the second copy of the
GGTAI gene.
Prather said he had used Yu
catan miniature swine as they
have better potential as organ
sources for human transplants be
cause of their size. A typical ma
ture miniature pig weighs be
tween 70-114 kilograms (150 to
250 pounds).
Another U.S. research group,
PPL Therapeutics, has created a
pig that lacks one of the two usual
copies of the sugar-making gene.
Prather and Immerge plan to test
organs from their pigs in baboons
with a goal of long-term survival
and a herd of miniature pigs for
use in transplant surgery.
Human trials could start in
three to five years, Greenstein
said.
