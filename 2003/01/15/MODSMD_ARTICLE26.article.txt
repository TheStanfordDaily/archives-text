						post-holiday guide to tech:
## Personal tech consumers may get more bang for the buck

If the holiday season didn't satisfy your need for cool
technical gear, the following devices will.
In the last few years, digital photography has rapid
ly moved from something only a professional would
consider to a necessity for the average enthusiast. Digi
tal photos offer incredible convenience — there are no
wasted prints, film developing costs or an aptitude for
night vision to work in a dark room. Due to vast im
provements in image resolution and quality, finding
digital cameras that rival the resolution of 35mm film is
no longer a challenge.
The cameras below fit into two categories: the Toshi
ba PDR-3310 is a point-and-shoot model, and the
Nikon 5700 is a professional model. Both cameras also
have movie mode, which allows you to record short dig
ital video files. While professional models are still ex
pensive, point-and-shoot cameras have become very af
fordable.

Sporting a 5.0 megapixel resolution (2,560 x 1,920),
the Nikon 5700 is compact, yet fully featured. Every
thing from exposure time to flash level to aperture is
easily adjustable with an easy-to-navigate combination
of menus and selector buttons.
For those who choose to let the camera do the work,
several different automatic settings are provided which
take care of virtually any lighting condition. The LCD
screen provides a sharp through-the-lens picture, giv
ing an accurate representation of what will end up in
your files. Overall, the 5700 combines the power of ad
justable options and the ease of automatic modes.
Though expensive, it is a value compared to other cam
eras in its class and will take care of all your digital needs.
The Nikon 5700 retails for $1199.95.
The Toshiba PDR-3310 was the smallest camera I
looked at and packs a great variety of features into a very
portable case. With a 3.22 megapixel resolution, the
camera is well-suited to printing medium-sized prints. A
built-in flash allows photography even in low light con
ditions, something many other compact cameras fail to
handle.
The menu system provides quick access to many
commonly needed settings and even allows manual
tweaking of certain options. Another great feature is a
rechargeable battery that is included with the camera.
This circumvents the need for wasting batteries. The
Toshiba PDR-3310 retails at $399.
Recently, laptop computers have been released with
configurations paralleling powerful desktop systems.
Built as a desktop replacement, the Compaq Presario
3005 us offers a Pentium 4 desktop processor at 2.0
GHz, with 512M8 RAM and a 40 GB hard drive. This
computer can tackle any application with ease.
There are four USB 2.0 ports and an lEEE 1394
port, which allow you to connect digital cameras, digital
video systems and external drives with ease. An inte
grated Ethernet port makes network connections a
breeze — simply plug in the cable, and you're set to go.
Weighing in at a little over eight pounds, you won't take
this laptop on a business meeting, but it is very conve
nient to move from location to location. The size of the
laptop is constrained by a 16-inch LCD screen, the

largest currently available on PC laptops.
Finding a case for such a large laptop can prove to be
a challenge, but US Luggage, Briggs & Riley and Zero
Halliburton offer models to protect your laptop during
travel. The US Luggage SGB3OO features a retracting
shoulder strap, making it easy to walk into a meeting
without struggling with straps and cords. The Zero Hal
liburton DZIO offers a rugged shell and wheels to make
transportation easy. Briggs & Riley's BRW2O Upright
Business Travel is a carry-on size bag with a removable
computer case.
Compared to other MP3 players, the Archos Juke
box FM Recorder 20 offers unprecedented tools. Not
only does it have a 20 GB hard drive that can store over
300 hours of CD-quality music, but it will record direct
ly into MP3 format from any input source. Do you have
aCD you want to be able to listen to on the go? Just plug
in your home stereo system in the input on thejukebox,
and you're soon ready to go.
By interfacing with the computer through a USB 2.0
connection, I could send just under a gigabyte of music
in about 10 minutes. In addition, the built-in FM tuner
allows music to be recorded directly off the radio. Even
