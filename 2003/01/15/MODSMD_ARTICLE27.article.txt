# Study shows more children, teens are taking psychiatric drugs

### 
CHICAGO (AP) â€” The number of
U.S. children and adolescents on Rital
in, antidepressants or other psychiatric
drugs surged between 1987 and 1996, a
trend some experts say is continuing.
The study did not determine
whether the youngsters were properly
diagnosed and treated. Some experts
have warned that American children
are being overmedicated. But others say
not all youngsters who really need treat
ment are getting it.
The study expands on previously

published data on preschoolers and in
cludes findings on young people
through age 20. University of Maryland
researcher Julie Magno Zito and col
leagues reviewed data on nearly
900,000 patients enrolled in Medicaid
programs in two states and a health
maintenance organization in the North
west.
By 1996, about 6 percent of all par
ticipants had prescriptions for psychi
atric drugs. Psychiatric drug use tripled
in the HMO patients and in those in a

Medicaid program in the Midwest. It
doubled in the second Medicaid pro
gram, in a mid-Atlantic state. The states
were not identified.
Stimulants such as Ritalin for treat
ing attention deficit disorders were the
most commonly prescribed psychiatric
drugs for children in 1996, followed by
antidepressants and mood-stabilizing
drugs for "acting out."
The findings probably reflect nation
wide practice, and other figures suggest
i he trend has continued since 1996, Zito

said. i
"Increased usage of these medica
tions demands a better understanding
of why they are being used and how ef
fective the medications are proving to
be," she said. "Safety for young children
must also be assessed because children
are not 'little adults' when it comes to
drug safety."
The study appears in January's
Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
Medicine. An accompanying editorial
said that viewed optimistically, the find

ings may reflect a broader awareness of
mental problems in youngsters. But the
editorial author, Dr. Michael Jellinek of
Massachusetts General Hospital, said
the study reveals some disturbing
trends, including increases in drug use
iu children at a time when research sup
porting such use was scant.
He also said the figures do not indi
cate whether the diagnoses of condi
tions such as attention deficit disorders,
