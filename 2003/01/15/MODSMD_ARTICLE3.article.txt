# Azar recounts horror of Beirut bombings
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
As photojournalist George Azar
flashed striking images of war-torn Beirut
on the screen in the basement of Building
420 last night, a hush fell over the audi
ence. The photography slide show, orga
nized by the student group "Bursting the
Bubble," presented Azar's experiences
covering important political events in the
Middle East over the past two decades

and featured his photographs from
Lebanon.
Azar began his career as a photojour
nalist when he resolved to take a trip to
Lebanon after learning about Israeli
bombings in 1982 that killed hundreds of
civilians and were covered only marginal
ly in the media.
"I felt that there was a great discon
nect between the academic world, the
book knowledge, and what was really
going on in the world. The daily bomb

ings of Palestinians were simply not part
of the cost-benefit analyses we had
learned about in class," he said. "There
was a real lack of genuine human discus
sion about this war."
"I remember sitting with my friends in
cafes and discussing current events, and
when the conversation turned to the
events in the Middle East and the bomb
ings of two apartment buildings where

over 4(H) civilians were killed, my
friends were strangely silent. The
events in the Arab world held little
resonance for them."
Alter backpacking through sev
eral countries and living on a mea
ger amount of money, Azar and a
friend stumbled upon a group of
Palestinian militia who allowed
them to take photographs of a pa
trol mission. They sold their pho
tographs to the Associated Press,
and Azar began his prominent ca
reer in photography.
Azar took the audience on a vi
sual tour of his career, setting a
somber tone in the room as he
clicked through slides of decimated
buildings and fearful civilians in
war zones. *
"You can see the buildings rid
dled with machine gun holes in this
once beautiful and sophisticated
cosmopolitan city," he said of a pho
tograph of Beirut.
Although a few of his pho
tographs depicted the devastated
city, Azar was largely concerned
with portraying the human side of
the war. Disgusted by photojour
nalists' stereotypical depiction of
the Palestinians and Israelis as gun
toting killing machines, Azar decid
ed to take a different approach to
his work.
"When I first started working in
the business, they told me that a
great photograph had to have a
gun in it,"he said. "Better yet, it
should have a man holding a gun.
And the so-called best photographs
— the ones that would make it on
the front pages of American news
papers — would be those that cap
tured women or children shooting
or holding guns."
"The reduction of an entire
country to guns and fires resulted
in the American public seeing a
very skewed perspective of
Lebanon. I wasn't informing the
American public, 1 was disinform

ing them."
So Azar began to shoot pho
tographs of people that had been
emotionally, physically and mental
ly damaged by the war.
One photograph fixused on a
woman in a bomb shelter in Beirut
with a look of pure hen or on her lace.
"One of the most important
things to do is to keep your emo
tions inside in this type of sit nation,"
lie explained. "This woman was try
ing so hard to do that, because once
a person cracks, it shatters the
nerves of everyone in the room."
On many occasions, Azar ex
plained, he had to leave the area be
cause he was well-informed of
where the Israelis were going to
b< >mb and knew he was in danger of
being killed.
"Not being a lighter, but a jour
nalist, I had the luxury of leaving,"
he said. "Many times I said good
bye, and as I drove away, 1 could
hear the planes dropping
bombs... 1 knew that when I re
turned, many people would no
longer be alive."
"By the time I left West Beirut,
there was no more room in the
graveyards," he added. "Bodies were
just stacked on top of each other."
One student asked how Azar
dealt with the ghastly scenes of war
throughout the years and managed
to stay intact psychologically.
"In war correspondence, you
have to keep a mental and emotion
al distance," he responded. "It helps
that you have an eyepiece and that
you see the world through a lens. It
wasn't until I left those places that I
felt emotionally saddened ... I had
to come up with defense mecha
nisms like black humor to keep
from letting it really get to me."
Azar was invited to speak at Stan
lord by a close friend, Comparative
Literature Lecturer Carolyn Dulley,
who contacted "Bursting the Bub
ble" and arranged for Azar to speak.
Sophomore Elaine Theios, a
member of the group, personally
interviewed Azar to discuss the
premise behind the series and
asked him to present an interesting

and informative discussion about
his work.
"He seemed like lie would be a
really great speaker, especially since
he has an outsider's persective, and
he's not from Stanford. He has so
much real-world experience that
we knew he would provide a very
important point of view to our au
dience," Theios said.
The "Bursting the Hubble" series
was designed by a group of under
graduates after a Sophomore Col
lege disc ussion led them to the con
clusion that many students at Stan
ford knew little about political events.
The group was founded to provide
"a non-threatening environment
where students can admit and over
come their unawareness about im
portant current issues."
Alter the discussion, a buzz of
voices arose in the hallway outside
the lecture room as students ex
pressed their reactions.
"I found the talk to be really in
teresting, and I liked that it provid
ed me with a much more realistic
and real-world viewpoint of the sit
uation in the Middle East than any
thing 1 had ever experienced in
class," said sophomore Carol Yu.
"It makes such a difference
when you see the photographs and
you know that he has been in places
we can't even imagine," she added.
Azar has covered the Middle
East for over 16 years and is the au
thor of the book "Palestine, A Pho
tographic: Journey." He has ap
peared in numerous publications,
including the New York Times,
Newsweek and The Economist.
He said he was pleased to come
to Stanford and take part in the
"Bursting the Bubble" series.
"We're a very inward-looking
country — very little time is spent
looking at ongoing international
discussions," he said.
"Americans are despised all over
the world for being so indifferent. It
is essential that we start an ongoing
discussion about these important
global events, and I think that this
series is a great way to start this
process."

Lebanon. I wasn't informing the
American public, 1 was disinform

ing them."
So Azar began to shoot pho
tographs of people that had been
emotionally, physically and mental
ly damaged by the war.
One photograph fixused on a
woman in a bomb shelter in Beirut
with a look of pure hen or on her lace.
"One of the most important
things to do is to keep your emo
tions inside in this type of sit nation,"
lie explained. "This woman was try
ing so hard to do that, because once
a person cracks, it shatters the
nerves of everyone in the room."
On many occasions, Azar ex
plained, he had to leave the area be
cause he was well-informed of
where the Israelis were going to
b< >mb and knew he was in danger of
being killed.
"Not being a lighter, but a jour
nalist, I had the luxury of leaving,"
he said. "Many times I said good
bye, and as I drove away, 1 could
hear the planes dropping
bombs... 1 knew that when I re
turned, many people would no
longer be alive."
"By the time I left West Beirut,
there was no more room in the
graveyards," he added. "Bodies were
just stacked on top of each other."
One student asked how Azar
dealt with the ghastly scenes of war
throughout the years and managed
to stay intact psychologically.
"In war correspondence, you
have to keep a mental and emotion
al distance," he responded. "It helps
that you have an eyepiece and that
you see the world through a lens. It
wasn't until I left those places that I
felt emotionally saddened ... I had
to come up with defense mecha
nisms like black humor to keep
from letting it really get to me."
Azar was invited to speak at Stan
lord by a close friend, Comparative
Literature Lecturer Carolyn Dulley,
who contacted "Bursting the Bub
ble" and arranged for Azar to speak.
Sophomore Elaine Theios, a
member of the group, personally
interviewed Azar to discuss the
premise behind the series and
asked him to present an interesting

and informative discussion about
his work.
"He seemed like lie would be a
really great speaker, especially since
he has an outsider's persective, and
he's not from Stanford. He has so
much real-world experience that
we knew he would provide a very
important point of view to our au
dience," Theios said.
The "Bursting the Hubble" series
was designed by a group of under
graduates after a Sophomore Col
lege disc ussion led them to the con
clusion that many students at Stan
ford knew little about political events.
The group was founded to provide
"a non-threatening environment
where students can admit and over
come their unawareness about im
portant current issues."
Alter the discussion, a buzz of
voices arose in the hallway outside
the lecture room as students ex
pressed their reactions.
"I found the talk to be really in
teresting, and I liked that it provid
ed me with a much more realistic
and real-world viewpoint of the sit
uation in the Middle East than any
thing 1 had ever experienced in
class," said sophomore Carol Yu.
"It makes such a difference
when you see the photographs and
you know that he has been in places
we can't even imagine," she added.
Azar has covered the Middle
East for over 16 years and is the au
thor of the book "Palestine, A Pho
tographic: Journey." He has ap
peared in numerous publications,
including the New York Times,
Newsweek and The Economist.
He said he was pleased to come
to Stanford and take part in the
"Bursting the Bubble" series.
"We're a very inward-looking
country — very little time is spent
looking at ongoing international
discussions," he said.
"Americans are despised all over
the world for being so indifferent. It
is essential that we start an ongoing
discussion about these important
global events, and I think that this
series is a great way to start this
process."
As photojournalist George Azar
flashed striking images of war-torn Beirut
on the screen in the basement of Building
420 last night, a hush fell over the audi
ence. The photography slide show, orga
nized by the student group "Bursting the
Bubble," presented Azar's experiences
covering important political events in the
Middle East over the past two decades

and featured his photographs from
Lebanon.
Azar began his career as a photojour
nalist when he resolved to take a trip to
Lebanon after learning about Israeli
bombings in 1982 that killed hundreds of
civilians and were covered only marginal
ly in the media.
"I felt that there was a great discon
nect between the academic world, the
book knowledge, and what was really
going on in the world. The daily bomb

ings of Palestinians were simply not part
of the cost-benefit analyses we had
learned about in class," he said. "There
was a real lack of genuine human discus
sion about this war."
"I remember sitting with my friends in
cafes and discussing current events, and
when the conversation turned to the
events in the Middle East and the bomb
ings of two apartment buildings where

over 4(H) civilians were killed, my
friends were strangely silent. The
events in the Arab world held little
resonance for them."
Alter backpacking through sev
eral countries and living on a mea
ger amount of money, Azar and a
friend stumbled upon a group of
Palestinian militia who allowed
them to take photographs of a pa
trol mission. They sold their pho
tographs to the Associated Press,
and Azar began his prominent ca
reer in photography.
Azar took the audience on a vi
sual tour of his career, setting a
somber tone in the room as he
clicked through slides of decimated
buildings and fearful civilians in
war zones. *
"You can see the buildings rid
dled with machine gun holes in this
once beautiful and sophisticated
cosmopolitan city," he said of a pho
tograph of Beirut.
Although a few of his pho
tographs depicted the devastated
city, Azar was largely concerned
with portraying the human side of
the war. Disgusted by photojour
nalists' stereotypical depiction of
the Palestinians and Israelis as gun
toting killing machines, Azar decid
ed to take a different approach to
his work.
"When I first started working in
the business, they told me that a
great photograph had to have a
gun in it,"he said. "Better yet, it
should have a man holding a gun.
And the so-called best photographs
— the ones that would make it on
the front pages of American news
papers — would be those that cap
tured women or children shooting
or holding guns."
"The reduction of an entire
country to guns and fires resulted
in the American public seeing a
very skewed perspective of
Lebanon. I wasn't informing the
American public, 1 was disinform

ing them."
