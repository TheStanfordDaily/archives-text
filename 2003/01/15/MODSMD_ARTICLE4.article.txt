# Campaign highlights honor code
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
A recent increase in reported
cases of cheating across campuses
nationwide has prompted Stan
ford's Office of Judicial Affairs to
embark on a campaign to raise
awareness of the Honor Code
among faculty, staff and students.
In the past couple of months,
the office has expanded its re
sources by opening an additional
position fora program coordina
tor. It has also revamped its Web
site, making it more informative
and accessible.
"We are trying to go forward on
several fronts," said George Wilson,
program coordinator for the Office
of J iidicial Affairs, noting that efforts
to raise awareness are being target
ed especially at incoming freshman
and transfer students.
The message the Office of Judi
cial Affairs is trying to convey to
students is straight and to the
point.
"If you [cheat] and get caught,
there will be some repercussions,
but not as severe as other schools,"
Wilson said. "You should think
twice before you resort to an easier
route."
At the University ofVirginia, all
violations of the honor code are
brought before a panel of stu
dents. If there is sufficient proof,
the incident will result in immedi
ate expulsion.
"I would much rather prevent
violations," said Laurette Beeson,
Stanford's judicial adviser. "If you
see cheating, why don't you re
port it?"
The office has made an effort to
be present and participate in all
orientation activities "where it's

appropriate for us to do so," Wil
son said. "We were definitely there
for New Student Orientation back
in September."
Beeson added, "Overall, the of
fice is very interested in trying to
bring things to people's attention.
Students need to think about and
take responsibility for their own
actions."
Judicial Affairs took part in a
number of training sessions across
campus last quarter dedicated to
increasing awareness of honor
code violations among teaching as
sistants and other academic staff.
The office held orientations at the
Medical Center, the Law School,
the School of Engineering and
Bechtel International Center.

"We talked about preventative
measures," said Mike Filler, a doc
toral student in chemical engi
neering who attended a training
session for TAs. "We offered
ideas... A lot of people thought
that TAs can't walk into the room
during an exam, but they can."
Wilson said, "Sometimes a stu
dent would go to a TA [to report a
violation] and the TA would claim
to be unable to do anything, possi
bly due to a misunderstanding of
the situation."
Judicial Affairs will also be ac
tively involved in making faculty
more aware of the changing times.
A number of departments have
appointed liaisons to Judicial Af
fairs, the majority of whom are fac
ulty members or department
chairs. The liaisons then pass mes
sages from the Oifice of Judicial
Affairs on to their colleagues.
"We know that we have a larger
number [of faculty] who are prob
ably not aware of what's going on
in terms of cheating," Wilson said.
"We're hoping to focus this winter
on faculty and staff. . . then focus
on students."
The office wants to make stu
dents feel more comfortable about
reporting cases of cheating to fac
ulty and teaching assistants.
"Students will be more willing to
come forward when they know [that |
their faculty care," Beeson said.
Wilson said the efficacy of the
honor code is dependent on the
culture within which it is enforced.
"People have to take individual
responsibility for changing and
making a difference," Beeson
agreed. "Some classes have a cul
ture where students tap their pen

cilson the desk if they see cheating."
According to Wilson, it is im
perative that the faculty clearly
convey their expectations regard
ing assignments and exams to the
class.

"If you give a take-home final
and you don't make your expecta
tions clear, the student may be
tempted to cheat," Wilson said.
Beeson said she believes that
efforts made by Judicial Affairs in
the recent past are showing posi
tive effects.
"We're seeing an increase of
cases where students are reporting
other students," she said.
