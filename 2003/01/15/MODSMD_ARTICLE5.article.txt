# Bio prof's report may lead to protection of marine regions

### FRANCES LEWIS 
Warning that continued neglect of aquatic
habitats could have devastating effects on
ocean ecosystems, Biology Prof. Stephen
Palumbi called yesterday for the "immediate
creation" of a network of marine reserves after
conducting a major study on the state of the
world's oceans.
Palumbi was asked by the Pew Oceans
Commission to research the current situa
tion of U.S. coastal waters and suggest a pos
sible solution to the problems facing marine
ecosystems. The commission was created as
an independent group to address the con
cerns of both the commercial fishing indus
try and environmental groups. Palumbi re
leased his findings in his seventh and final re
port on the topic at a press conference yes
terday afternoon.
The Commission will make a report pre
senting its recommendations to Congress in
April 2003.
The marine reserves called tor by Palumbi
would resemble national forests for the ocean.
The report defines them as a "marine protect
ed area in which no extractive use of any re
source — living, fossil or mineral — nor any
habitat destruction is allowed."
While currently there are areas of the ocean
under regulation, called marine protected
areas, they often only limit specific actions or
protect individual species. While more abun
dant in other regions of the world, there are
very few fully-protected reserves in the United
States— 12 to be exact — in only California,
Florida, Washington and Hawaii.
Pew Oceans Commission Chair Leon
Panetta, former congressman and White
1 louse chief of stafi under the Clinton admin
istration, emphasized the need for coordina
tion among government organizations at the
local, state and national levels.
Despite the hundreds of laws regarding the
ocean and its use, Panetta noted the need to
"relate land and sea together," rather than as

separate entities.
Panetta drew attention to the fact that small
scale pollution, which often is overlooked, has
an aggregate effect that can be just as devastat
ing as major catastrophes.
"Over 10.8 million gallons of oil go into the
coastal waters every eight months [due to pol
lution]," Panetta said. "That's the equivalent of
the Exxon-Valdez spill."
An increase in migration to coastal commu
nities contributes to the detriment of the
oceans by rapidly eliminating wetlands. The
problem of overfishing has also become more
abundant due to poor trolling practices and
"bvcatch" — the unintentional catch of fish
