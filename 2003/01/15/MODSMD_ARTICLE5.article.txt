# Bio prof's report may lead to protection of marine regions

### FRANCES LEWIS 
Warning that continued neglect of aquatic
habitats could have devastating effects on
ocean ecosystems, Biology Prof. Stephen
Palumbi called yesterday for the "immediate
creation" of a network of marine reserves after
conducting a major study on the state of the
world's oceans.
Palumbi was asked by the Pew Oceans
Commission to research the current situa
tion of U.S. coastal waters and suggest a pos
sible solution to the problems facing marine
ecosystems. The commission was created as
an independent group to address the con
cerns of both the commercial fishing indus
try and environmental groups. Palumbi re
leased his findings in his seventh and final re
port on the topic at a press conference yes
terday afternoon.
The Commission will make a report pre
senting its recommendations to Congress in
April 2003.
The marine reserves called tor by Palumbi
would resemble national forests for the ocean.
The report defines them as a "marine protect
ed area in which no extractive use of any re
source — living, fossil or mineral — nor any
habitat destruction is allowed."
While currently there are areas of the ocean
under regulation, called marine protected
areas, they often only limit specific actions or
protect individual species. While more abun
dant in other regions of the world, there are
very few fully-protected reserves in the United
States— 12 to be exact — in only California,
Florida, Washington and Hawaii.
Pew Oceans Commission Chair Leon
Panetta, former congressman and White
1 louse chief of stafi under the Clinton admin
istration, emphasized the need for coordina
tion among government organizations at the
local, state and national levels.
Despite the hundreds of laws regarding the
ocean and its use, Panetta noted the need to
"relate land and sea together," rather than as

separate entities.
Panetta drew attention to the fact that small
scale pollution, which often is overlooked, has
an aggregate effect that can be just as devastat
ing as major catastrophes.
"Over 10.8 million gallons of oil go into the
coastal waters every eight months [due to pol
lution]," Panetta said. "That's the equivalent of
the Exxon-Valdez spill."
An increase in migration to coastal commu
nities contributes to the detriment of the
oceans by rapidly eliminating wetlands. The
problem of overfishing has also become more
abundant due to poor trolling practices and
"bvcatch" — the unintentional catch of fish

Prof, of Biology Stephen Palumbi announced at
a press conference yesterday the findings of a
report for the Pew Oceans Commission calling
for protected areas in U.S. seas.
other than the one being sought.
"There is a lot of water out
there, and we assume it can take
care of itself," Panetta said. "We
need to treat our oceans as a na
tional trust. . . We have the re
sponsibility as leaders to make sure
the right things happen to our
oceans."
Palumbi then presented his re
search findings and discussed how
marine resenes could help save the
environment as well as the commer
cial fishing industry.
"All threats — pollution, over
fishing— all affect marine ecosys
tems because they endanger the life
of the sea," he said.

Palumbi has researched the cur
rent effectiveness of fully protected
marine reserves from all over the
world and has found that the ob
served lienefits are dramatic.
"Species that are heavily fished
occur much more commonly and at
a much larger size inside a marine
reserve," said Palumbi. "The size
and density of species that live inside
[a marine reserve] and are exj doited
outside goes up noticeably."
In his report, Palumbi stressed,
however, that marine reserves
aren't the final solution to the prob
lem facing the oceans today.
"The reserves should be imple
mented immediately in all major
marine habitats in U.S. coastal wa
ters," the report said.
"By themselves, reserves will
not solve the problems of terres
trial run-off, the ecological effects

of aquaculture or of invasive
species," the report said. "Yet
they can stem habitat destruc
tion, alleviate the local effects ol
overfishing, protect areas from
mining, simplify the simultane
ous management of multiple
species and restore biodiversity
within their borders."
The commission was created
with the purpose of sparking dia
logue among elected officials, scien
tists and environmentalists to ob
serve the current relationship be
tween man and the sea.
Other members include New
York Governor George Pataki,
Alaska Governor Tony Knowles,
Executive Director of the Monterey
Bay Aquarium Julie Packard and
President of the Pacific ('.oast Feder
ation of Fisherman's Associations
Pietro Parravano.
