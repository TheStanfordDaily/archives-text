## A 						BID FOR CHARITY 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
After raising $1,800 fora charity group, the or
ganizers of the second annual Stanford Undergrad
uate Psychology Association's silent auction could
only deem u a smashing success. The auction ran
online from Dec. 2 to Dec. 9 and raised a total of
$1,442 from bidders and received $358 from other
donations.
All of the profits from the auction went to benefit
the Center for Domestic Violence Prevention, a na
tional charity organization with an agency in nearby

San Mateo.
SUPA auctioned off gift certificates, books signed
by esteemed faculty members of the Psychology
Dept. and other gilt items through an interactive
YVel) service that allowed bidders to place their bids
online instantly.
"One of our goals was to run the auction in such
a way that people outside of the Psych Department
could participate, and the Web site ended up work
ing out very well," said Danya Pastuszek, president
of SUPA.
"We had donations from psy
chology professors, such as a
signed book by Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky, which was great
because they were able to get in
volved in the event by both donat
ing and bidding," she continued.
After the conclusion of the bid
ding period, bidders collected
their items during fall quarter fi
nals week at Jordan Hall, which al
lowed SUPA members to meet
many of the people who participat
ed in and donated to the auction.
The auction was planned and
coordinated by a special commit
tee consisting of several SUPA of
ficers as well as other members.
Becky Deßoer, community ser
vice coordinator for SUPA, said
she was pleased with the auction's
overall success.

"The bidding itself was pretty
exciting... It got a little intense
at the end; there were a few price
races there," she said. "We re
ceived many donations from
Stanford faculty, athletic teams
and local businesses."
Although the event ran pretty
smoothly, some people had prob
lems with the Web site, and SUPA
officers are hoping to clear up the
kinks by next year. Pastuszek also
hopes to increase publicity about
the event to get more people in
volved in both the planning and
the actual bidding.
According to Pastuszek, the
auction committee decided not to
advertise outside of the Stanford
community for security reasons
this year, but is hoping to eventu
ally extend the auction's range to
include more of the Bay Area.
SUPA officers, led by Deßoer,
decided to donate their proceeds
to the Center for Domestic Pre
vention after investigating chari

ties around the area.
"Last year we donated our pro
ceeds to Freedom Fighters because
we thought it would be appropri
ate to donate to an organization re
lated to the Sept. 11 events," Pas
tuszek explained. "This year, how
ever, we thought it would be better
to donate to a charity that was clos
er to our community."
Alter scanning through a long
list of psychology-related chari
ties, Deßoer came to a decision.
"In high school I volunteered
at a crisis center in a neighboring
community every week or so for

over three years, and so I knew
that I wanted to donate to a simi
lar kind of place; it was somewhat
of a personal decision," she ex
plained. "1 chose the Center for
Domestic Violence Prevention,
the only agency in San Mateo
County that offers a network of
in-house counseling and support
services to women in their shelter
program."
Although the silent auction is the
organization's main community ser
vice event for the year, SUPA offi
cers are busy planning other activi
ties, including a booth for Stanford's
Community Day this spring. For

"SUPA's events are a great way
to give back to the community,"
Pastuszek added. "Our goal is to
provide a service both for the un
dergraduates as well as to the
greater area, and these events
allow us to do just that."
