(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. â€”
Red tape, endless paperwork
and an increasing cost of educa
tion are just some of the factors
that the federal Committee on
Education and Workforce took
into consideration when drafting
the FED UP legislation, which
aims to make financial aid more
readily available and easier for
college students to obtain.
The bill is the result of re
search conducted by the Upping
the Effectiveness of Our Federal
Student Aid Program, which
evaluated responses submitted
by over 3,000 college officials
and administrators. Participants
recommended modifications
and reforms to streamline the fi
nancial aid process.
If enacted, the legislation will
expedite the time between a stu
dent's financial aid application
and when they receive actual
funds. It would also expand the
Higher Education Act to make
scholarships more readily avail

"This is a noncontroversial,
bipartisan bill that will allow

thousands of students the chance
to attend college," stated 21st

press release. McKeon intro
duced the bill to Congress.
Additionally, the bill will help
students avoid defaulting on ed

creased flexibility on payment
plans and renegotiations with
lenders.

Davis has a 2.3 percent student
loan default rate, which is con

government. The rate is impor

offer loans because a high default
rate can jeopardize the loans
available to that school's stu
dents.
"It speaks to the integrity of
the students taking out the
loans," said Laura Bossio, direc
tor of Financial Aid at UCI).
"The lower the default rate, it al
lows for some administrative re
leases to make aid easier."
President George W. Bush
has also pledged to increase the
availability of higher education
to 8.4 million students through
