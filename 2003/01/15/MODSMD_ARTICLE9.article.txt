(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. —
Red tape, endless paperwork
and an increasing cost of educa
tion are just some of the factors
that the federal Committee on
Education and Workforce took
into consideration when drafting
the FED UP legislation, which
aims to make financial aid more
readily available and easier for
college students to obtain.
The bill is the result of re
search conducted by the Upping
the Effectiveness of Our Federal
Student Aid Program, which
evaluated responses submitted
by over 3,000 college officials
and administrators. Participants
recommended modifications
and reforms to streamline the fi
nancial aid process.
If enacted, the legislation will
expedite the time between a stu
dent's financial aid application
and when they receive actual
funds. It would also expand the
Higher Education Act to make
scholarships more readily avail
able for low-income and minori
ty students to attend law school.
"This is a noncontroversial,
bipartisan bill that will allow

thousands of students the chance
to attend college," stated 21st
Century Competitiveness sub
committee chairman Howard
McKeon (D-San Fernando) in a
press release. McKeon intro
duced the bill to Congress.
Additionally, the bill will help
students avoid defaulting on ed
ucational loans by allowing in
creased flexibility on payment
plans and renegotiations with
lenders.
The University of California-
Davis has a 2.3 percent student
loan default rate, which is con
sidered very low by the federal
government. The rate is impor
tant in a university's ability to
offer loans because a high default
rate can jeopardize the loans
available to that school's stu
dents.
"It speaks to the integrity of
the students taking out the
loans," said Laura Bossio, direc
tor of Financial Aid at UCI).
"The lower the default rate, it al
lows for some administrative re
leases to make aid easier."
President George W. Bush
has also pledged to increase the
availability of higher education
to 8.4 million students through
$55 billion in new grants, loans
and work-study programs..
Currently 13,000 UCD stu
dents — 62 percent of the un
dergraduate population — re
ceive some form of financial aid,
according to Bossio. Even if a
student does not meet require
ments for need-based subsidized
loans or grants, nonsubsidized
loans are still available.
Student fees will be increased
$135 for spring quarter, and
Gov. Gray Davis' 2003-2004
state budget proposes a 35 per
cent increase in fees at the Uni
versity of California. The Finan
cial Aid Office stated that stu
dent fee increases will most like
ly lead to an increase in the
amount students receive in their
aid packages.
"Every year, we look at the
complete cost of attendance
when looking at funding stu
dents," Bossio said.
