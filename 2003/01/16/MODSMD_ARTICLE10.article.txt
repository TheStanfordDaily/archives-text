## Bush opposes Michigan affirmative action policy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush, stepping into the most politically
charged affirmative action case in a gener
ation, asserted yesterday that a program
of racial preferences for minority appli
cants at the University of Michigan was
"divisive, unfair and impossible to square
with the Constitution."
Democrats and civil rights leaders swiftly
attacked Bush's position in a Supreme
Court case that could overturn a 1978 affir
mative action ruling and jeopardize 25 years
of race-based programs.
The White House said a brief being filed
today on Bush's behalf is narrowly tailored
to oppose the Michigan program and does
not address a critical question: whether race
can play a role at all in selecting a student
body. Bush chose to let the Supreme Court
settle an issue that could reshape affirmative
action programs nationwide.
The court hears the case in March.
Some conservatives, including senior
members of Bush's own Justice Depart
ment, had urged Bush to take a tougher
stand against ever using race.
The Michigan program "amounts to a
quota system that unfairly rewards or penal
izes prospective students solely on their
race," Bush said.
He said the undergraduate admissions
program awards black, Hispanic and Na

tive American students 20 points, one-fifth
of the total normally needed for admission.
At the law school, some minority students
are admitted to meet percentage targets
while others with higher grades are passed
over, Bush said.
The last Supreme Court case that ad
dressed affirmative action in college admis
sions banned the outright use of racial quo
tas but still allowed university admissions of
ficers to use race as a factor. The case, the
1978 Bakke ruling, involved a white appli
cant rejected from a public medical school
in California.
Bush said that "racial prejudice is a reali
ty in our country" and Americans should not
be satisfied with the current numbers of mi
norities on college campus. But in trying to
fix the problem, Bush said, "we must not use
means that create another wrong."
As an option to quotas and preferences,
Bush pointed to admissions programs in
other states — including his home state of
Texas — that promote diversity without
giving students an edge based solely on
their race.
The volatile issue forced the president to
balance the desires of his conservative back
ers, who staunchly oppose affirmative ac
tion, against the potential reaction from the
broader electorate if he is viewed as being
racially insensitive.
