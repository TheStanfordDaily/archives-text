SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North
Korea rejected as "pie in the sky" U.S.
offers of talks and possible aid in ex
change for abandoning its nuclear am
bitions, accusing Washington on yes
terday of staging a "deceptive drama"
to mislead world opinion.
Keeping up a stream of anti-Ameri
can invective — even as it agreed to
more high-level meetings with South
Korea next week — Pyongyang de
clared it would accept no U.S. offer of
dialogue with conditions attached.
White House spokesman Ari Fleis
cher said Wednesday the United States
had not heard any official word from
Pyongyang.
After assuring South Korean offi

cials in Seoul that Washington will stick
to diplomacy to resolve the North's nu
clear dispute, U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State James Kelly met Chinese offi
cials in Beijing to seek their help.
As North Korea's only remaining
major ally, China is in a strong position
to influence its communist neighbor.
China traditionally supports a nuclear
free Korean Peninsula.
South Korea pushed forward its
own efforts to defuse the tension by set
ting up Cabinet-level talks with North
Korea in Seoul. The talks, Jan. 21-24,
are the first opportunity for South
Korea to directly raise its concerns over
the nuclear issue.
U.S., British and French officials

meeting Wednesday in London decid
ed that the International Atomic Ener
gy Agency's 35-nation board of gover
nors should convene as a next step in
the dispute with North Korea, a U.S.
official said.
North Korea's rejection of U.S. di
alogue offers was among the daily di
atribes it issues through the state-run
media.
"It is clear that the U.S. talk about di
alogue is nothing but a deceptive
drama to mislead the world public
opinion," the KCNA agency quoted
said yesterday.
Reports from the agency also reject
ed international concern over its nu
clear programs.
