# Sniper suspect can be tried as an adult
## 
### 
FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — Citing what he
called strong circumstantial evidence, a
judge said yesterday that 17-year-old
sniper suspect John Lee Malvo can be
tried as an adult, making him eligible for
the death penalty.
Juvenile Court Judge Charles Max
field ruled after a hearing in which pros
ecutors said Malvo tauntingly tried to ex
tort $10 million from authorities during
the killing spree and that fingerprints on
the murder weapon and other evidence

tied the teenager to four attacks — three
of them fatal.
Malvo and John Allen Muhammad,
42, are accused of killing 13 people and
wounding five others in Alabama,
Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Vir
ginia and Washington, D.C., last year.
They are being tried first in Virginia in
separate trials.
The extortion allegation is a key ele
ment of a Virginia anti-terrorism law
that allows the death penalty for killers
convicted of trying to intimidate the pub

lie or coerce the government. Malvo is
also charged under a statute that allows a
death sentence for multiple murders.
"They wanted to negotiate for
money," prosecutor Robert F. Horan
said. "They said 'If you want us to stop
killing people give us the money.' If that
is not intent to intimidate government, I
don't know what is."
Defense lawyers argued the evi
dence was insufficient because no eye
witnesses placed Malvo at any of the
crime scenes.
