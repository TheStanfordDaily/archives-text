## The 						Stanford Daily Students should still clean up after themselves 
### 
Published Since 1891

On any given weekend, plastic cups,
kitchen utensils, meal leftovers and
cracked beer bottles litter dorm
common spaces such as bathrooms
and lounges. When Saturday night hangovers
lead to vomit-stained bathroom sinks, students
often endure unsanitary conditions until Mon
day when custodians assume cleaning respon
sibility. To address student concern over un
clean living conditions, Student Housing Ser
vices announced that dorm custodians will
now work on Saturdays. We commend Stu
dent Housing Services for addressing com
plaints, but we believe students should hold
more accountability for their messes despite
this new service.
Many students believe that weekend filth in
dorms is a result of custodian absence. Howev
er, the need for custodians stems from the re
ality that students are messier than usual on
the weekends. A bathroom floor that is not

mopped for two days will not jeopardize the
health or cleanliness of students. However
when vomit stains and toilet-side periodicals
accumulate on the bathroom floor, we may
have more to worry about. During the week
end, students are more likely to cook, play
games, drink alcohol and engage in other
forms of recreation that may require clean-up.
Academic coursework successfully pre
pares students for intellectual challenges out
side the borders of Stanford. Student life ef
fectively equips students with social skills for
the real world. In the same ways, the dorm liv
ing experience seeks to prepare students with
the respect and courtesy necessary to work
and live with others. To some extent, this
preparation must be failing when students are
both creating messes and failing to clean up
after themselves. Such inconsideration creates
a burden for other members of the dorm. Fur
ther, custodians must often stretch their work

beyond their job descriptions in order to re
store dorm conditions to a sanitary state.
Rather than remedying this problem by offer
ing more cleaning days for custodians, we
should question the source of the problem:
the collective attitude of students.
The new cleaning schedule adjustment
places unnecessary burden on workers. As im
portant members of the Stanford community,
workers should have the same opportunity as
students to enjoy free time away from their oc
cupation. During weekend hours, workers
may sacrifice their own leisure time to clean up
the remnants of students' leisure time. Ulti
mately, workers are bearing the consequence
for student carelessness.
Now that weekend janitors will be cleaning
around dorms, perhaps we can realize the con
sequences of our actions radier than becoming
more comfortable with our bad habits. If stu
dents see a custodian hand-picking used paper

towels from the bathroom floor, maybe they
will change their habits. In the future, perhaps
students will carefully place their towels in
garbage cans, instead of using their trash for
three-point jump shots, which have a lower
field-goal percentage.
In an ideal world, students would clean up
after themselves, and we would not need
dorm custodians to devote their weekends to
cleaning. Students would be responsible and
not take for granted the vacuuming of dorm
lounges and scrubbing of bathroom floors.
While vomit might still find its way onto floors
and into carpets, students would feel a sense of
duty toward restoring conditions to the quali
ty their dormmates and custodians deserve.
Dorm custodians would enjoy their weekends
by spending time with their families or pursu
ing personal interests. Until we reach this
ideal world, we must work toward changing
the attitude of students.
