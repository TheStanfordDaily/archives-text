# THE 						MINISTRY OF TRUTH
## Life in virtual reality 
### 
Late last year Maxis released The
Sims Online, its follow-up to The
Sims, the highest-selling PC
game in history. In both games,
players endeavor to maximize their Sims'
(simulated persons) happiness while gain
ing skill points and making friends. A sim
ple, even quotidian, premise, but the
games have had no trouble commanding
legions of gamers.
With The Sims Online, Maxis is likely
seeking to carve out a niche in a gaming
genre known as Massively Multiplayer On
line Role-Flaying Games, or simply,
MMORPGs. In just a few years, players
have logged hundreds of hours each on
games such as Ever Quest and Dark Age of
Camelot.
In traditional MMORPGs, players cus-

tomize and develop their
own virtual characters in
an enormous online com
munity. They choose
their physical appear
ance, their trade and
often their membership
in a particular guild, clan
or association. By van
quishing foes and com-

pleting quests, players acquire special skills,
strengths and spells.
What is new about MMORPGs is the
fusion of video gaming with certain
"parasocial" features. The games rely
heavily on chat. Many games acquire
their own peculiar jargon. Novices ("new
bies") can be confused by the profligacy of
acronyms: "WYPKTW!" ("Will you
please kill the wizard!")
The visual splendor of these online rea
lms, the promise of perfecting one's char
acter (high-level players are often the object
of reverent awe) and the possibility of meet
ing people — in whichever perverse sense
you can meet someone online —combine
to create a very engaging game.
Indeed, the games can even become ad
dictive. Ever Quest has earned the moniker
"Ever Crack." Comedian Ben Stein has
publicly censured MMORPGs for the social
and psychological pathologies they have in
duced in his son.
I have experienced firsthand the social
ly debilitating effect of video games. In the
days of Nintendo, my parents often wor
ried that the hermitic lifestyle engendered
by ceaseless gaming might impair my so
cial development, frhe jury's still out on
that one.)
Years later, when I began playing
marathon sessions of The Sims (to the de
cided detriment of my non-virtual pur
suits), I used to joke that I was spending
more time improving the lives of my Sims
than my own life. In online games like Dark
Age of Camelot, a sense of duty to my guild
mates kept me playing long after the fun
had ceased.
I have always assumed that, like myself,
the scores of online gamers lead busy, pro
ductive lives outside the virtual domain.

Sure, there are the occasional Level 50
Necromancers who have clearly squan
dered weeks or months in the compulsive
pursuit of digital prestige and glory. But
the vast majority, I have reasoned, have no
trouble reconciling their MMORPG "life"
with their real life.
Lately, though, I have begun to think
that assumption may be wrong. Consider
that an estimated 500,000 people signed
online as Sims on New Year's Eve to ex
change a virtual kiss with another user.
New Year's Eve — the epitome of party
going, social revelry and celebration —
and half a million people are sitting at their
computers watching litde pixelated charac
ters make out.
A few weeks later, I encountered my first
married Sims couple. A woman was com-

New Year's Eve — the epitome
of party-going, social revelry
and celebration — and half a
million people are sitting at
their computers watching little
pixelated characters make out.

plaining about such burdensome matrimo
nial obligations as buying virtual furniture,
occupying the home during certain hours
and generating income. The woman
scarcely knew anything about her pseudo
spouse. Creepy.
If this is not evidence enough that the
MMORPG can represent much, much
more than a recreational pastime for
gamers, I recommend that you go to eßay
and perform a search for Dark Age of
Camelot. You will see characters as well as
weapons and magic items auctioned for
sums in excess of $400 (the game retails for
around $40). I have even seen virtual cur
rency auctioned on eßay for hundreds of
dollars; the exchange rate of mithrils (Dark
Age's highest denomination) to the U.S.
dollar seems solid.
The mixed-up sociology of MMORPGs
mirrors a similar trend in recent years in
Internet chat rooms and instant messaging.
The impersonality of these media, coupled
with the potential for misrepresentation, al
lows users to "be" whomever they want.
But the peculiar features of the online
games — developing an actual on-screen
likeness, participating in virtual raids and
missions and being part of a team — ex
ceed the faculties of chat and I Ms.
The bevy of MMORPGs will only grow.
Planet Side, a joint venture by Sony and the
developers of Ever Quest, has been in pro
duction fora couple of years. The mere
scope of the project is supposed to be awe
striking. Meanwhile, video gamers and sci
fi aficionados are already clamoring for
Star Wars Galaxies, the next installment of
the popular Lucas Arts series.

From the beginning, the Internet has
been a conduit for people to "connect."
Champions of globalization have em
braced the possibility of uniting people
across space and time. But what happens
when online services replace, or co-opt,
activities whose province has been (and

perhaps should remain) the real world?
What happens when half a million people
don't bother going out because they
would rather watch their digitized alter
ego have a good time?

marathon sessions of The Sims (to the de
cided detriment of my non-virtual pur
suits), I used to joke that I was spending
more time improving the lives of my Sims
than my own life. In online games like Dark
Age of Camelot, a sense of duty to my guild
mates kept me playing long after the fun
had ceased.
I have always assumed that, like myself,
the scores of online gamers lead busy, pro
ductive lives outside the virtual domain.

Sure, there are the occasional Level 50
Necromancers who have clearly squan
dered weeks or months in the compulsive
pursuit of digital prestige and glory. But
the vast majority, I have reasoned, have no
trouble reconciling their MMORPG "life"
with their real life.
Lately, though, I have begun to think
that assumption may be wrong. Consider
that an estimated 500,000 people signed
online as Sims on New Year's Eve to ex
change a virtual kiss with another user.
New Year's Eve — the epitome of party
going, social revelry and celebration —

married Sims couple. A woman was com-

If this is not evidence enough that the
MMORPG can represent much, much
more than a recreational pastime for
gamers, I recommend that you go to eßay
and perform a search for Dark Age of
Camelot. You will see characters as well as
weapons and magic items auctioned for
sums in excess of $400 (the game retails for
around $40). I have even seen virtual cur

dollars; the exchange rate of mithrils (Dark
Age's highest denomination) to the U.S.
dollar seems solid.

when online services replace, or co-opt,

Late last year Maxis released The
Sims Online, its follow-up to The
Sims, the highest-selling PC
game in history. In both games,
players endeavor to maximize their Sims'
(simulated persons) happiness while gain
ing skill points and making friends. A sim
ple, even quotidian, premise, but the
games have had no trouble commanding
legions of gamers.
With The Sims Online, Maxis is likely
seeking to carve out a niche in a gaming
genre known as Massively Multiplayer On
line Role-Flaying Games, or simply,
MMORPGs. In just a few years, players
have logged hundreds of hours each on
games such as Ever Quest and Dark Age of
Camelot.
In traditional MMORPGs, players cus-

tomize and develop their
own virtual characters in
an enormous online com
munity. They choose
their physical appear
ance, their trade and
often their membership
in a particular guild, clan
or association. By van
quishing foes and com-

pleting quests, players acquire special skills,
strengths and spells.
What is new about MMORPGs is the
fusion of video gaming with certain
"parasocial" features. The games rely
heavily on chat. Many games acquire
their own peculiar jargon. Novices ("new
bies") can be confused by the profligacy of
acronyms: "WYPKTW!" ("Will you
please kill the wizard!")
The visual splendor of these online rea
lms, the promise of perfecting one's char
acter (high-level players are often the object
of reverent awe) and the possibility of meet
ing people — in whichever perverse sense
you can meet someone online —combine
to create a very engaging game.
Indeed, the games can even become ad
dictive. Ever Quest has earned the moniker
"Ever Crack." Comedian Ben Stein has
publicly censured MMORPGs for the social
and psychological pathologies they have in
duced in his son.
I have experienced firsthand the social
ly debilitating effect of video games. In the
days of Nintendo, my parents often wor
ried that the hermitic lifestyle engendered
by ceaseless gaming might impair my so
cial development, frhe jury's still out on
that one.)

suits), I used to joke that I was spending
