ROTC at Stanford could disadvantage
student cadets
Joe Fairbanks and Travis Menk's at
tempts to have ROTC reinstated at Stan
ford are appreciated, but I feel they re
quire slightly more reflection ("Republi
cans push for ROTC return," Jan. 10).
The primary purpose of ROTC, be
yond political and ethical debate, is to de
velop leaders (albeit military ones). One
way the program achieves this is by allow
ing the Midshipmen / Cadets to directly
coordinate and execute part of their train
ing, usually while simultaneously leading
their peers in a structure similar to the one
they will encounter upon graduation,
when they are commissioned as officers.
Currently, removing Stanford students
from, say, the Navy ROTC Unit at UC-
Berkeley, would mean taking the senior
ranking Midshipman out of a position
commanding nearly 70 peers and instead
placing him / her in charge of barely over
a dozen. In terms of preparation and chal
lenge, there is quite a difference between
the two situations. A similar depreciation
would follow in all such relationships and
positions; as a junior I direct almost two
times more people than a possible Stan
ford Navy ROTC could offer me.
The argument that relocating ROTC to
Stanford would substantially increase en
rollment in the program seems to me a tad
too optimistic. Certainly the hours lost to
commuting and spent in class and the
other aspects of an ROTC education are
not a small burden. Rut in exchange fora
full tuition scholarship, a modest amount
for books and a slight living stipend, these
obligations almost seem trivial if not sim
ply light. Totaling the benefits, one would
be hard-pressed to spend the same hours
dedicated to ROTC elsewhere and come
up with the same benefits. Simply remov

ing the travel time and offering credit for
ROTC courses would certainly facilitate
college life, but I do not see such slight al
terations convincing ambivalent students
to dive into the program. Nor do I see
such inconveniences being the sole or
even primary reason why people choose
not to participate in or to leave the pro
gram. After all, there is still the time com
mitment of training, the workload and na
ture of required classes and, of course, an
obligation to serve in the military.

Affirmative action is a matter of race,
not socioeconomic class
Piotr Kosicki's letter regarding affirma
tive action policies at Stanford in Tues
day's Daily was informative and thought
provoking, though it contained a couple
of points worth discussing further ("It's
time to reevaluate affirmative action," Jan.
14). In citing a Stanford Magazine article
from 1996, Kosicki wrote, "[E]mpirical
studies demonstrate that, rather than ben
efiting 'disadvantaged students,' affirma
tive action simply helps minorities from
middle- and upper-class backgrounds."
But to eliminate financially well-off mi
norities from the ranks of "disadvantaged
students" is to misunderstand the com
plexity of how race influences one's
growth environments, including school
ing and related factors that would eventu
ally be borne out on one's application to
Stanford. In his book "Racist America,"
Joe Feagin argues, with comprehensive
research and documentation, that in
many subtle and often unintended ways,
"most whites in all income groups have the

ability to put black Americans 'in their
place,' " including in secondary-school en
vironments. We could debate the extent to
which racism exists between whites and
minorities in middle-class settings, but it is
nonetheless misguided to believe that eco
nomic parity alone puts racial groups at
the same level of "advantage," and there
fore undermines the legitimacy of affirma
tive action in college admissions.
Furthermore, Stanford may not reach
out to lower-class minorities, but much
progress in racial standing can be made
through the higher classes. The civil rights
movement in the 1960s relied heavily
upon small victories of enfranchisement
and inclusion fought for and gained by
middle-class blacks. As Sharon Collins
writes in Black Corporate Executives, "If
federal policies assisted in the creation of
jobs for middle-class blacks, then a retreat
from racial policies may undermine
blacks' gains in the labor market." In re
gard to Stanford, I share Kosicki's concern
that "minority students underperforming
because of deficient secondary schools re
ceive no solace" from the Admissions Of
fice. Indeed, I would like to see more soci
etal racial reform directed to those most in
need of it. But in the meantime, middle
class minorities can play a crucial role in
racial reform, and their presence at insti
tutions such as Stanford ought not to be
underestimated.
True enough, Stanford "has not man
aged in three decades to 'level the play
ing field.' " But that is not cause for the
University to abandon its affirmative ac
tion policies and the gains that these
policies have won. A front-page article in
Monday's Daily noted a Black Enterprise
Magazine study that ranked Stanford
among the 10 best colleges for African
Americans. That status no doubt came
about in part through the University's
commitment to affirmative action in ad
missions. African Americans represent 9
percent of the Stanford undergraduate
student body, versus 13 percent of the
U.S. population. Only when those num

bers converge — only when minorities
are proportionately represented in stu
dent bodies and later in professional
fields — can we begin to speak of a level
playing field. Here's hoping that until
that day, the range of ways in which af
firmative action measures influence a
university's and a society's race relations
will not be forgotten, even as these poli
cies are constantly reevaluated.

But to eliminate financially well-off mi
norities from the ranks of "disadvantaged
students" is to misunderstand the com
plexity of how race influences one's
growth environments, including school
ing and related factors that would eventu

Stanford. In his book "Racist America,"
Joe Feagin argues, with comprehensive
research and documentation, that in
many subtle and often unintended ways,
"most whites in all income groups have the

which racism exists between whites and
minorities in middle-class settings, but it is
nonetheless misguided to believe that eco

the same level of "advantage," and there

Furthermore, Stanford may not reach
out to lower-class minorities, but much
progress in racial standing can be made
through the higher classes. The civil rights
movement in the 1960s relied heavily
upon small victories of enfranchisement
and inclusion fought for and gained by
middle-class blacks. As Sharon Collins
writes in Black Corporate Executives, "If
federal policies assisted in the creation of
jobs for middle-class blacks, then a retreat
from racial policies may undermine
blacks' gains in the labor market." In re
gard to Stanford, I share Kosicki's concern
that "minority students underperforming
because of deficient secondary schools re
ceive no solace" from the Admissions Of
fice. Indeed, I would like to see more soci

need of it. But in the meantime, middle
class minorities can play a crucial role in
racial reform, and their presence at insti
tutions such as Stanford ought not to be
underestimated.
True enough, Stanford "has not man
aged in three decades to 'level the play
ing field.' " But that is not cause for the
University to abandon its affirmative ac
tion policies and the gains that these
policies have won. A front-page article in
Monday's Daily noted a Black Enterprise
Magazine study that ranked Stanford
among the 10 best colleges for African
Americans. That status no doubt came
about in part through the University's
commitment to affirmative action in ad
missions. African Americans represent 9
percent of the Stanford undergraduate
student body, versus 13 percent of the
U.S. population. Only when those num

bers converge — only when minorities
are proportionately represented in stu
dent bodies and later in professional
fields — can we begin to speak of a level
playing field. Here's hoping that until
that day, the range of ways in which af
firmative action measures influence a
university's and a society's race relations
will not be forgotten, even as these poli
cies are constantly reevaluated.

ROTC at Stanford could disadvantage
student cadets
Joe Fairbanks and Travis Menk's at
tempts to have ROTC reinstated at Stan
ford are appreciated, but I feel they re
quire slightly more reflection ("Republi
cans push for ROTC return," Jan. 10).
The primary purpose of ROTC, be
yond political and ethical debate, is to de
velop leaders (albeit military ones). One
way the program achieves this is by allow
ing the Midshipmen / Cadets to directly
coordinate and execute part of their train
ing, usually while simultaneously leading
their peers in a structure similar to the one
they will encounter upon graduation,
when they are commissioned as officers.
Currently, removing Stanford students
from, say, the Navy ROTC Unit at UC-
Berkeley, would mean taking the senior
ranking Midshipman out of a position
commanding nearly 70 peers and instead
placing him / her in charge of barely over
a dozen. In terms of preparation and chal
lenge, there is quite a difference between
the two situations. A similar depreciation
would follow in all such relationships and
positions; as a junior I direct almost two
times more people than a possible Stan
ford Navy ROTC could offer me.
The argument that relocating ROTC to
Stanford would substantially increase en
rollment in the program seems to me a tad
too optimistic. Certainly the hours lost to
commuting and spent in class and the
other aspects of an ROTC education are
not a small burden. Rut in exchange fora
full tuition scholarship, a modest amount
for books and a slight living stipend, these
obligations almost seem trivial if not sim
ply light. Totaling the benefits, one would
be hard-pressed to spend the same hours
dedicated to ROTC elsewhere and come
up with the same benefits. Simply remov

ing the travel time and offering credit for
ROTC courses would certainly facilitate
college life, but I do not see such slight al
terations convincing ambivalent students
to dive into the program. Nor do I see
such inconveniences being the sole or
even primary reason why people choose
not to participate in or to leave the pro
gram. After all, there is still the time com
mitment of training, the workload and na
ture of required classes and, of course, an
obligation to serve in the military.

Affirmative action is a matter of race,
not socioeconomic class
Piotr Kosicki's letter regarding affirma
tive action policies at Stanford in Tues
day's Daily was informative and thought
provoking, though it contained a couple
of points worth discussing further ("It's
time to reevaluate affirmative action," Jan.
14). In citing a Stanford Magazine article
from 1996, Kosicki wrote, "[E]mpirical
studies demonstrate that, rather than ben
efiting 'disadvantaged students,' affirma
tive action simply helps minorities from
middle- and upper-class backgrounds."
But to eliminate financially well-off mi
norities from the ranks of "disadvantaged
students" is to misunderstand the com
plexity of how race influences one's
growth environments, including school
ing and related factors that would eventu
ally be borne out on one's application to
