# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Is the Hoover Institution compatible with Stanford's goals? 
### STANFORD COMMUNITY FOR PEACE JUSTICE 
While many students know that former
provost Condoleezza Rice is President
Bush's national security adviser, many
may not realize that the connection be
tween Stanford and the Bush administra
tion runs much deeper.
According to an Oct. 8 Stanford Daily
article, seven fellows at the Hoover Insti
tution, located on campus and a part of the
University, are members of the 31-mem
ber Defense Policy Board that is advising
the Pentagon on its strategy for dealing
with Iraq. This connection has once again
raised the question of the Hoover Institu
tion's relationship to conservative politics.
While there is nothing wrong with a
Hoover fellow, or any scholar, advising
government official — indeed, we wish to
distinguish between the institution and
the projects of its individual fellows — we

raise the issue of Hoover fellows' involve
ment in U.S. foreign policy because we feel
it reflects the nature of the institution: The
fellows on the Defense Policy Board —
Newt Gingrich, Martin Anderson, George
Schultz and Pete Wilson among them —
have all been deeply involved in conserva
tive politics.
Hoover is the only facility associated
with the University that maintains an
overt political bias. While the institution is
not directly tied to any particular party, its
political ideology has been explicitly stated
and implicitly confirmed by the institu
tion's activities since it expanded from an
archive to a research and policy institution
in 1959. The institution describes Herbert
Hoover's 1959 proclamation that "the
Federal Government should undertake
no governmental, social or economic ac
tion, except where local government, or
the people, cannot undertake it for them
selves," as continuing to "guide and define

[the Hoover Institution's] mission in the
twenty-first century."
While Hoover's scholars have every right
to hold conservative polidcal views, the in
stitudon itself merits a different considera
tion. The Hoover Institution's mission
seems to encourage the selection of fellows
of a particular political mold. Indeed, the
political persuasion of the institution's staff
can be seen from its several prominent Re
publican fellows, including Newt Gingrich,
George Shultz and Pete Wilson — probably
chosen for their "distinguished public ser
vice," Martin Anderson might say — and
the number of fellows who have serv ed the
current presidential administration or pre
vious Republican administrations.
Regardless of whether one supports
Hoover's political leanings, it is clear that
the type of bias made explicit in the Insti
tution's mission impinges on the Univer
sity's policy of academic freedom and ob
jectivity. Section 2.3 of Stanford's Re-

search Policy Handbook states, "Deci
sions concerning . . . the search for, and
appointment of, faculty . . . [and] the sup
port and sponsorship of scholarly re
search . . . shall be made without regard
to a person's political, social or other
views." This policy is designed to ensure
that academic merit is the only basis for
selecting faculty and to provide fora di
versity of opinion and political ideology
plays no role whatsoever.
While the rest of the University follows
this position, the Hoover Institution's mis
sion influences the hiring of fellows, fac
toring in potential fellows' support of the
institution's mission of limited govern
ment. In addition to contradicting Stan
ford policy, this support affects the diver
sity of research, and perhaps more impor
tantly, the diversity of teaching.
The relationship between Hoover fel
lows and Stanford can be seen in many
places. Many Hoover fellows also serve as

professors. Moreover, departments are
able to retain many high-profile professors
through joint appointments with Hoover,
where the two parties split the cost. Because
Hoover is unlikely to pursue a joint ap
pointment with a faculty member who op
poses its mission statement, Hoover's bias
could be a factor in shaping Stanford facul
ty in departments with many joint appoint
ments like economics and political science.
Stanford's administrators need to ad
dress the fact that the Hoover Institution's
mission undermines the University's com
mitment to academic freedom and objec
tivity in the eyes of students, faculty and
the public. Unless Hoover is held to the
same standards that academic depart
ments are held to, Stanford should sever
ties with the Hoover Institution in the
name of academic freedom.

The Stanford Community for Peace and Justice
