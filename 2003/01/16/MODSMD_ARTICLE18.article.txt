# Blood shortages are reported after holiday season
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD STAFF WRITER 
With a decrease in donations since
Christmas and the new year, the Stanford
Blood Center is facing a critical shortage of
blood types O-positive, O-negative and A
positive.
Types AB-positive and AB-negative are
also in demand.
"Blood donors are needed year-round
because red blood cells have a shelf life of
only 42 days," said Michelle Gassaway,
spokesperson for the center. "Typically, we
see shortages the most in winter and sum
mer months. People go on vacation or are
unable to donate because of the flu season."
Blood types A and O are the most com
monly used and needed.
"We always need type O blood donors,"
she said. "O is the universal donor and can
be used by any patient."

The center is holding six campus blood
drives between January and March. It's also
continuing a program called the Crimson
Competition, which began at the beginning
of the academic year. The contest awards a
T-shirt to people affiliated with Stanford
when they donate three times within a 12-
month period, and a prize to the dorm with
the highest percentage of donors each
quarter.
Jennifer Reczkowski, a center consul
tant, oversees the program.
"The idea to hold a campus-wide com
petition has been floating around the Blood
Center fora long time," Reczkowsi said.
"Staff members knew it would be a festive
way to encourage students to donate
blood."
A new winner is chosen each quarter,
and in order to keep the prize, the dorm
must continue to have the highest percent
age of blood donors.

"Whichever residence gets the biggest
percentage of its residents to donate wins a
foosball table. The table will belong to the
winning dorm each quarter, and they'll
have to donate and recruit to keep it," Gas
saway continued.
Competitors can donate at any location,
and should sign in with the name of their
specific dorm — e.g., Otero instead of
Wilbur — since housing groups may want
to hold their own individual competitions.
"Whatever gets people interested in do
nating is a good thing," Reczkowski said.
The winning residence for fall quarter
was Phi Kappa Psi. Sophomore Joel Gedal
ius, the house's blood drive coordinator,
also volunteers at the center's canteen.
"Having a coordinator to get everyone
riled up about the competition is a sure way
to win," Reczkowski said.
While the normal donation goal is 20
percent of dorm residents, the Phi Psis set a

higher goal.
"We declared our goal at 100 percent
participation of our residents, so no res
ident could shy away from the goal and
let the others pick up the slack," said
Gedalius. "In the end, we had 97 percent
[36 of 37] participation. Including other
community members who came to our
house for the blood drive, there were 40
pints of blood drawn, and 20 first time
donors."
Gedalius said he thinks the Crimson
Competition is a good way of encouraging
students to donate.
He also pointed out that the blood do
nated at the center is used primarily within
the Stanford and neighboring communi
ties.
"So donating is saving the lives of your
neighbors," he said.
