# Cardinal Today
## With or Without Nicole Powell 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
won't say it, but the Cardinal has the tal
ent and team chemistry to go deep into
the NCAA tournament.
Quite a change from November when
most figured Stanford would struggle
without All-America candidate junior
Nicole Powell, and that the real season
wouldn't start until she came back.
After all, the Cardinal's starting lineup
consisted of two redshirt sophomores
who hadn't played for at least a year
(Susan King and Chelsea Trotter), and
three sophomores who combined to score
only 20 points a game last year. Gone
were Lindsey Yamaski's 17.2 points per
game and the inside presence of Bethany
Donophin.
Without Powell, the Cardinal looked
like a border-line top-25 team at best.
But head coach Tara VanDerveer kept
reminding everyone not to forget her tal
ented group of sophomores.
"People know about T'Nae [Thiel]
and Kelley [Suminski], but the person
who has improved the most is Sebnem
[Kimyacioglu], She is in great shape and
looks very confident," VanDerveer said
in November.
This season, Kimyacioglu is averaging
10.6 points per game — up almost five
points from last year. Sophomore Azella
Perryman is also having a breakout sea
son, averaging 12.5 points per game, nine
points ahead of her pace last season.
Together the six sophomores are aver
aging an incredible 58.6 points per game
— more than the entire offense of Wash
ington and Oregon State.
Without Powell, everyone else stepped
up together, making the Cardinal's bal
anced offense difficult to defend.
So far this season, seven different play
ers have led the Cardinal in scoring, and
four starters are averaging double fig
ures.
In November, VanDerveer also point
ed out that her team's cohesiveness and
chemistry boded well for its performance
this year.
"People are very dedicated and every

one is staying together," she s»*d. "They
haye worked exceptionally hard and are
playing exceptionally well."
VanDerveer echoed her previous sen
timents this week. "Our team has estab
lished a culture of how we play. They are
incredibly mature and unselfish. This
particular team really has been great to
work with."
In the last few years, VanDerveer has

been brilliant in recruiting team-orient
ed, highly skilled players who comple
ment each other.
At the beginning of the season, Van-
Derveer knew that without Powell her
squad would have to pay attention to de
tail to be successful against top teams.

The Cardinal women's basketball team has played with tremendous teamwork and skill this
season, and the return of Nicole Powell will only increase its momentum.
thing," VanDerveer said. "We are
not a big team so we need to box
out. If we don't do the little, fun
damental things we will be in
trouble."
The Cardinal has done "the lit
tle things" exceptionally well.
Thiel and Perryman relentlessly
crash the boards, but can also
shoot 3-pointers. Thiel hit a
clutch three against Oregon
down the stretch in Stanford's win
over the Ducks on Saturday.
Trotter is surprisingly agile for
someone who is 6-4, and has de
veloped an unstoppable turn
around jumper.
The torrid outside shooting of
Kimyacioglu, Suminski and King
(.414, .366, .367 from behind the
arc, respectively) opens up the
offense for post players. The
Cardinal also shoots a league
leading 78.2 percent from the
free-throw line.
What the team may lack in
sheer athleticism it makes up for
in balance, teamwork and skill.

Without Powell, the No. 6 Car
dinal earned its elite ranking by
winning 10 out of its first 11
games, including an upset victory
over then-No. 2 Kansas State and
a come-from-behind win over
then-No. 21 Arizona.
Opposing coaches often use
phrases like "savvy," "well
coached" and "great execution"
to describe the Cardinal's play.
"Stanford executes so well and
they're so skilled, especially in
side," Pepperdine coach Mark
Trakh told the Mercury News
after his team was thrashed by the
Cardinal 91-58.
Add Powell to a group that
learned how to win without her
and you have a frighteningly
good team.
"Nicole gives us a different di
mension," VanDerveer told the
San Francisco Examiner last
week. "How many 6-2 kids drib
ble like that, rebound like that
and play that unselfishly? That
gets people open. We run better.
There's no doubt we're a better
team in a lot of ways, but we were
8-1 without her and people did
learn things: Do not depend on
one person to have confidence."

"We're going to be good in a
month and even better in two
months," VanDerveer added.
"With the adversity we've faced
this year, it has toughened this
team in a way no other preseason
has. This past week is the first
time we've had 10 players at
practice. This team is just start
ing to gel."
The timing couldn't be better.
In two months the Cardinal will
be gearing up for the NCAA tour
nament.
Still, havingjust barely escaped
with a win against a hungry Ore
gon team last week, the Cardinal
refuses to get ahead of itself.
"Different programs have dif
ferent goals and expectations,"
Powell said. "Our expectation is
definitely to get to the Final Four
and win a national championship,
but right now we are just focused
on the next game — Washington
State."
"I think the NCAA tourna
ment is always a goal in the back
of our minds," added King. "But
I don't think the team is focusing
on that because there is so much
stuff we have to accomplish first
to get there."
