# Cardinal Today
## With or Without Nicole Powell 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
won't say it, but the Cardinal has the tal
ent and team chemistry to go deep into
the NCAA tournament.
Quite a change from November when
most figured Stanford would struggle
without All-America candidate junior
Nicole Powell, and that the real season
wouldn't start until she came back.
After all, the Cardinal's starting lineup
consisted of two redshirt sophomores
who hadn't played for at least a year
(Susan King and Chelsea Trotter), and
three sophomores who combined to score
only 20 points a game last year. Gone
were Lindsey Yamaski's 17.2 points per
game and the inside presence of Bethany
Donophin.
Without Powell, the Cardinal looked
like a border-line top-25 team at best.
But head coach Tara VanDerveer kept
reminding everyone not to forget her tal
ented group of sophomores.
"People know about T'Nae [Thiel]
and Kelley [Suminski], but the person
who has improved the most is Sebnem
[Kimyacioglu], She is in great shape and
looks very confident," VanDerveer said
in November.
This season, Kimyacioglu is averaging
10.6 points per game — up almost five
points from last year. Sophomore Azella
Perryman is also having a breakout sea
son, averaging 12.5 points per game, nine
points ahead of her pace last season.
Together the six sophomores are aver
aging an incredible 58.6 points per game
— more than the entire offense of Wash
ington and Oregon State.
Without Powell, everyone else stepped
up together, making the Cardinal's bal
anced offense difficult to defend.
So far this season, seven different play
ers have led the Cardinal in scoring, and
four starters are averaging double fig
ures.
In November, VanDerveer also point
ed out that her team's cohesiveness and
chemistry boded well for its performance
this year.
"People are very dedicated and every

one is staying together," she s»*d. "They
haye worked exceptionally hard and are
playing exceptionally well."
VanDerveer echoed her previous sen
timents this week. "Our team has estab
lished a culture of how we play. They are
incredibly mature and unselfish. This
particular team really has been great to
work with."
In the last few years, VanDerveer has

been brilliant in recruiting team-orient
ed, highly skilled players who comple
ment each other.
At the beginning of the season, Van-
Derveer knew that without Powell her
squad would have to pay attention to de
tail to be successful against top teams.
"We are focusing on doing the correct
