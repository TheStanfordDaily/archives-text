# Cardinal set for Cougars
## 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the past decade or so, the Stan
ford men's basketball team has clearly
dominated both Washington State and
Washington.
So from a historical perspective, the
Cardinal (11-4, 2-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) should have no problem with an
early-season trip to Washington.

at Washington, Saturday, 4:00 p.m.

But anyone who's watched this up
and-down Stanford team over the past
few months would tell you that both
the Huskies and Cougars are cause for
concern.
Even head coach Mike Montgomery
sounded a litde worried.
"We have had a tendency to get our
selves ready to play against teams that
have reputations," Montgomery said
after the Cardinal's 81-57 upset over
then-No. 12 Oregon. "Obviously Ore
gon comes in ranked, Oregon comes in
defending Pac-10 champions, and [the
team] treated it as if it were something
very serious, and we got after it.
"We've just got to find a way to do
that more often. We have had a tenden
cy to get ourselves ready to play teams
that have reputations, and we've tried to
explain to them that in this league,
everybody's good, everybody's got a
reputation."
Even the Washington schools?
You might argue that these games
are even bigger than the ones that came
before for the Cardinal. Tonight's
matchup against Washington State (5-8,
0-4) and Saturday afternoon's game ver
sus Washington (6-7, 1-3) might very
well present themselves as more of a
Cardinal vs. self batde.
"We have to concentrate on prepar
ing for every team," said freshman point
guard Jason Haas. "If we want to be suc
cessful in Washington, we have to pre
pare the same way mentally [as we did

for Oregon]."
Against the Cougars, Stanford's
biggest test will be guarding junior
swingman Marcus Moore. He's leading
the conference in scoring with 21 points
per game, and he put up 42 points
against Gonzaga in December.
Further, his 6-foot-6, 200-pound
frame could create matchup problems
for Stanford at the guard spot.
"Marcus Moore has been outstand
ing this year, and we have to come out
and play them very tough because we
know that they aren't going to back
down from us," sophomore forward
Josh Childress said.
For Washington, junior Doug Wren
is the Huskies' most notable player. The
6-6 forward leads the team in rebounds
and blocks and is second in scoring.
"Washington is one of the most ath
letic teams in the Pac-10," Childress
said. "Both of these teams from a
record standpoint aren't the greatest
teams, but we still have to come out,
play hard, be aggressive and play great
defense, and we'll hopefully come back
with two wins."
Stanford has already established itself
as a strong defensive unit. The Cardinal
has held its opponents to 65 points per
game, which is second in the conference.
On the other hand, Stanford is not a
team that has consistently put a lot of
points on the board. The Cardinal is av
eraging 70 points per game, meaning
that its average margin of victory is only
five points.
Questions as to whether or not Stan
ford can really dominate a team have
been quiedy answered with its disman
ding of Oregon, but whether or not the
Cardinal can beat an unranked team in
the same manner still remains unclear.
Stanford hopes to translate some of
the energy still remaining from the
comeback victory over Oregon State
and the upset over Oregon last week to
fuel strong offensive performances in
Washington. Because regardless of who
you play, two road victories in the Pac
-10 are precious, and in order for Stan
ford to keep pace with Arizona and Cal

ifornia, who remain undefeated head
ing into the weekend, two Washington
wins are a must.
"They're Pac-10 games; ever)' game
is a big game, and we have to come ready
to play," said freshman shooting guard
Dan Grunfeld.
Tipoff against Washington State is
tonight at 7:00 p.m. Saturday's matchup
against Washington will begin at 4:00

p.m. and can be viewed on Fox Sports
Net.
Junior forward Justin Davis still re
mains questionable after spraining his
left knee two weeks ago against Califor
nia. He will be available for action, but
whether or not Montgomery will look to
him remains to be seen. Sophomore
Nick Robinson will most likely start in
his place.

frame could create matchup problems
for Stanford at the guard spot.
"Marcus Moore has been outstand
ing this year, and we have to come out
and play them very tough because we
know that they aren't going to back
down from us," sophomore forward
Josh Childress said.
For Washington, junior Doug Wren
is the Huskies' most notable player. The
6-6 forward leads the team in rebounds
and blocks and is second in scoring.
"Washington is one of the most ath
letic teams in the Pac-10," Childress
said. "Both of these teams from a
record standpoint aren't the greatest
teams, but we still have to come out,
play hard, be aggressive and play great
defense, and we'll hopefully come back
with two wins."
Stanford has already established itself
as a strong defensive unit. The Cardinal
has held its opponents to 65 points per
game, which is second in the conference.
On the other hand, Stanford is not a
team that has consistently put a lot of
points on the board. The Cardinal is av
eraging 70 points per game, meaning
that its average margin of victory is only
five points.
Questions as to whether or not Stan
ford can really dominate a team have
been quiedy answered with its disman
ding of Oregon, but whether or not the
Cardinal can beat an unranked team in
the same manner still remains unclear.
Stanford hopes to translate some of
the energy still remaining from the
comeback victory over Oregon State
and the upset over Oregon last week to
fuel strong offensive performances in
Washington. Because regardless of who
you play, two road victories in the Pac
-10 are precious, and in order for Stan
ford to keep pace with Arizona and Cal

ifornia, who remain undefeated head
ing into the weekend, two Washington
wins are a must.
"They're Pac-10 games; ever)' game
is a big game, and we have to come ready
to play," said freshman shooting guard
Dan Grunfeld.
Tipoff against Washington State is
tonight at 7:00 p.m. Saturday's matchup
against Washington will begin at 4:00

p.m. and can be viewed on Fox Sports
Net.
Junior forward Justin Davis still re
mains questionable after spraining his
left knee two weeks ago against Califor
nia. He will be available for action, but
whether or not Montgomery will look to
him remains to be seen. Sophomore
Nick Robinson will most likely start in
his place.

An Oregon St. defender gets a little too much elevation last weekend as Julius Barnes and
the Cardinal squeaked by the Beavers before obliterating Oregon. The Washington
schools are next on Stanford's agenda.
