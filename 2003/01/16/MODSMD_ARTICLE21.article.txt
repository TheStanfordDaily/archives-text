# Women host Wash. St.
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After twice hanging on to the
proverbial cliff this past weekend at
Oregon and Oregon State — really by
just a fingernail in Eugene — the Stan
ford women's basketball team can look
forward to more secure footing at
home this weekend against the Wash
ington schools.

Women's Basketball
vs. Washington St., Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. Washington, Saturday, Noon

In the next few days, the No. 6 Car
dinal (12-1, 4-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
will encounter both ends of the confer
ence spectrum.
First, it gets the pleasure of feasting
on a downtrodden Washington State
squad (0-13, 0-5) in the midst of a 37-
game losing streak tonight at 7:00 p.m.
Then Saturday at noon, Stanford faces
a sterner test against a senior-laden
Washington team (12-2, 4-1) off to its
best start since the 1989-90 season.
The Cardinal-Husky matchup is
intriguing for several reasons, most
ly because it pairs the two most pro
lific 3-point-shooting teams in the
conference.
Washington (8.29 3-pointers per
game) and Stanford (6.92) both rely
heavily on the outside shot — and
when either gets on a roll, watch out.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer is
definitely cognizant of the Huskies'
long-range prowess.
"They shoot the ball very well," she
said. "If we learned anything from
Oregon, it was about playing perime
ter defense."
The Huskies' main offensive threats
lie in the backcourt, where they boast a
pair of All-American caliber guards: ju
nior Giuliana Mendiola and senior
Loree Payne.
Mendiola is third in the Pac-10 in
scoring (15.5 ppg), shoots 46.8 per
cent from 3-point land and leads her
team in rebounding (6.2 rpg) and as
sists (4.6 apg).
Payne, meanwhile, averages 14.3
points per game and has been the
Huskies' more visible 3-point threat
over the years. She is only one trey
away from tying the school record of

210 career 3-pointers.
But it's not like Washington lacks in
side presence, either.
Six-foot-four junior center Andrea
Lalum and 6-0 senior forward Emily
Autrey combine to generate 21.5 points
and 9.8 rebounds per game. The duo
will provide the Cardinal interior de
fense with something to think about
should VanDerveer employ defenses
focused on stopping the Huskies'
perimeter game.
And as if these dangers weren't
enough for the Cardinal to combat,
there's yet another element at play;
Washington has been playing emotion
ally charged basketball ever since find
ing out that Kayla Burt could no longer
continue playing on the hardwood due
to a rare heart condition.
Burt has weighed heavily on the
hearts of the players, and the effects of
those circumstances were manifested in
a 60-59 upset win over No. 18 Arizona.
"It's hard to be on an emotional
rollercoaster all the time," VanDerveer
cautioned. "But they've come back and
have been riding a lot of emotion."
Although the Huskies are off to their
best start in coach June Daugherty's six
years in Seattle, Washington hasn't ex
actly played the toughest of schedules.
The Huskies have wins over only
two teams from major conferences —
Kentucky and lowa State — and has
played such softies as Houston and
Saint Bonaventure.
And when the going has gotten
rough, the Huskies have been out
toughed.
Washington was blown out in its
only two games against premier teams
prior to the Arizona win. The Huskies
lost to No. 13 Texas Tech 99-57 in Lub
bock and later to Pac-10-leading UCLA
72-46.
As a result, Washington's strength of
schedule sits currently at 188, a figure
which will probably hurt it come tour
nament time.
Clearly, that possibly inflated record
will come under fire on Saturday
against a top-ranked opponent.
Meanwhile, things are dreary in
Pullman as Washington State's
women's team hasn't won a game
since beating Gonzaga in November
