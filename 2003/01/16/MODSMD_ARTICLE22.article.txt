For most Division I men's college basketball play
ers, the first minutes on the collegiate courts are pre
ceded by at least a dozen basketball camps, hundreds
of AAU games and thousands of hours in the gym.
Seldom are they required to style each of their
teammates hair.
But fifth-year senior Olatunde Sobemehin is hard
ly your average Division I player, and the path that
led to his minute-long debut in the final moments of
Stanford's win over Oregon on Saturday was filled

first Greek letter African-American fraternity;
founded a program entitled Step-Up aimed at rec

nology; received a Lion's Award for the Alternative
Spring Break trip he led to Oregon; served as a res
