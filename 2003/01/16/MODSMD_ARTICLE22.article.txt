# Sobemehin is making his mark
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
For most Division I men's college basketball play
ers, the first minutes on the collegiate courts are pre
ceded by at least a dozen basketball camps, hundreds
of AAU games and thousands of hours in the gym.
Seldom are they required to style each of their
teammates hair.
But fifth-year senior Olatunde Sobemehin is hard
ly your average Division I player, and the path that
led to his minute-long debut in the final moments of
Stanford's win over Oregon on Saturday was filled
with a lot more than simply opening a barber shop.
Sobemehin first approached men's assistant coach
Eric Reveno when he appeared on the Farm as a
freshman. A three-sport athlete at Benson High
School in Portland, Ore., Sobemehin was voted
"Most Athletic" in his senior class after receiving all
league recognition in soccer, captaining the league
champion basketball team and competing at the state
championships in track.
In high school Sobemehin distinguished himself
far beyond his success in the athletic arena, demon
strating that it was possible to be intelligent and a re
spected athlete.
"I wanted to serve as a role model fora whole lot
of African-American males especially," he said. "I
wanted to show that one could be popular, smart and
spiritual, and it brought me here."
While Sobemehin was told that there were no
spots on the basketball team, he was offered the posi
tion of team manager. He began traveling with the
team sophomore year, and was head manager his ju
nior year, picking up the opportunity to get some
practice time in with the team.
Despite spending nearly 20 to 30 hours a week on
his managerial duties, Sobemehin found time to
make an indelible mark on the Stanford communi
ty. He serves as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the
first Greek letter African-American fraternity;
founded a program entitled Step-Up aimed at rec
tifying many of the social issues associated with tech
nology; received a Lion's Award for the Alternative
Spring Break trip he led to Oregon; served as a res
ident assistant in Paloma and as vice president of the
NAACP on campus; and has been honored with two
Dean's awards for community in
volvement.
This long list of achievements
should not overshadow the barber
shop Esfac'e Designer Cuts Un
limited that Sobermehin started.
The barber shop cuts all of the
Stanford basketball team's hair.
In the spring of his junior year,
Sobemehin decided that basket
ball was a commitment he really
wanted to make and began doing
all that he could to assure himself
a spot on the roster. In addition to
the individual workouts, practices
and weight sessions that the team
participated in, Sobemehin often
stayed longer and did more, not
only attending his own individu
als, but those of his teammates.
Throughout his conditioning
he continued to serve as manager,
forcing him to show up at 6:30
a.m. fora 7:15 workout, making
power shakes for the players be
fore joining them in the gym.
Given the opportunity to warm
up with the team when they trav
eled to Australia in the summer of
2001, Sobemehin was unable to
play due to NCAA eligibility rules.
He kept practicing but failed to
make the team last year. Between
his workouts and extensive ex
tracurriculars, Sobemehin fell on
some rough time academically
and was forced to stop out winter
quarter.
Continuing with his condition
ing, and returning as an academic
student, Sobemehin finally got the
nod from head coach Mike Mont
gomery and his staff to suit up for
the Oregon State game on Thurs
day. He received his first playing
time on Saturday when the Cardi
nal unexpectedly blew Oregon
out of the water.
"It's a blessing," Sobemehin
said of his first minutes on the
Maples Pavilion court as a mem
ber of the team. "It was a long
road. I had to go through so many

Ups and downs."
"So many people helped me
out; so many people supported
me," he Stressed. "It wasn't just a
victory for myself; it was a victory
fora lot of people."
With one dream realized, a
simple glance through Sobeme
hin's accomplishments allows one
to recognize the 5-foot-11 guard
isn't going to stop at the basketball
court. Typical of the leadership he
has demonstrated, he hopes to use
his newly found hoops prestige for
goals that differ from the custom
ary Sports Center highlight reel.
"I don't care about playing
time. I don't care about my own

personal game," he said. "I want
to work hard and make those 1
play against in practice better.
"One of the reasons why I love
basketball is that I want to be a
leader in the black community
and other underserved communi
ties — whether that means I will
hold political office, whether I
have my own nonprofit, whether I
serve as a teacher or administrator
in the school system. Sometimes
you have automatic credibility if
you play basketball."
And if any of those ideas don't
pan out, hopefully he'll at least
find a few more clients for his bar
ber shop.

find a few more clients for his bar

For most Division I men's college basketball play
ers, the first minutes on the collegiate courts are pre
ceded by at least a dozen basketball camps, hundreds
of AAU games and thousands of hours in the gym.
Seldom are they required to style each of their
teammates hair.
But fifth-year senior Olatunde Sobemehin is hard
ly your average Division I player, and the path that
led to his minute-long debut in the final moments of
Stanford's win over Oregon on Saturday was filled
with a lot more than simply opening a barber shop.
Sobemehin first approached men's assistant coach
Eric Reveno when he appeared on the Farm as a
freshman. A three-sport athlete at Benson High
School in Portland, Ore., Sobemehin was voted
"Most Athletic" in his senior class after receiving all
league recognition in soccer, captaining the league
champion basketball team and competing at the state
championships in track.
In high school Sobemehin distinguished himself
far beyond his success in the athletic arena, demon
strating that it was possible to be intelligent and a re
spected athlete.
"I wanted to serve as a role model fora whole lot
of African-American males especially," he said. "I
wanted to show that one could be popular, smart and
spiritual, and it brought me here."
While Sobemehin was told that there were no
spots on the basketball team, he was offered the posi
tion of team manager. He began traveling with the
team sophomore year, and was head manager his ju
nior year, picking up the opportunity to get some
practice time in with the team.
Despite spending nearly 20 to 30 hours a week on
his managerial duties, Sobemehin found time to
make an indelible mark on the Stanford communi
ty. He serves as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the
first Greek letter African-American fraternity;
founded a program entitled Step-Up aimed at rec
tifying many of the social issues associated with tech
nology; received a Lion's Award for the Alternative
Spring Break trip he led to Oregon; served as a res
ident assistant in Paloma and as vice president of the
NAACP on campus; and has been honored with two
Dean's awards for community in
volvement.
This long list of achievements
should not overshadow the barber
shop Esfac'e Designer Cuts Un
limited that Sobermehin started.
The barber shop cuts all of the
Stanford basketball team's hair.
In the spring of his junior year,
Sobemehin decided that basket
ball was a commitment he really
wanted to make and began doing
all that he could to assure himself
a spot on the roster. In addition to
the individual workouts, practices
and weight sessions that the team
participated in, Sobemehin often
stayed longer and did more, not
only attending his own individu
als, but those of his teammates.
Throughout his conditioning
he continued to serve as manager,
forcing him to show up at 6:30
a.m. fora 7:15 workout, making
power shakes for the players be
fore joining them in the gym.
Given the opportunity to warm
up with the team when they trav
eled to Australia in the summer of
2001, Sobemehin was unable to
play due to NCAA eligibility rules.
He kept practicing but failed to
make the team last year. Between
his workouts and extensive ex
tracurriculars, Sobemehin fell on
some rough time academically
and was forced to stop out winter
quarter.
Continuing with his condition
ing, and returning as an academic
student, Sobemehin finally got the
nod from head coach Mike Mont
gomery and his staff to suit up for
the Oregon State game on Thurs
day. He received his first playing
time on Saturday when the Cardi
nal unexpectedly blew Oregon
out of the water.
"It's a blessing," Sobemehin
said of his first minutes on the
Maples Pavilion court as a mem
ber of the team. "It was a long
road. I had to go through so many

Ups and downs."
"So many people helped me
out; so many people supported
me," he Stressed. "It wasn't just a
victory for myself; it was a victory
fora lot of people."
With one dream realized, a
simple glance through Sobeme
hin's accomplishments allows one
to recognize the 5-foot-11 guard
isn't going to stop at the basketball
court. Typical of the leadership he
has demonstrated, he hopes to use
his newly found hoops prestige for
goals that differ from the custom
ary Sports Center highlight reel.
"I don't care about playing
time. I don't care about my own

personal game," he said. "I want
to work hard and make those 1
play against in practice better.
"One of the reasons why I love
basketball is that I want to be a
leader in the black community
and other underserved communi
ties — whether that means I will
hold political office, whether I
have my own nonprofit, whether I
serve as a teacher or administrator
in the school system. Sometimes
you have automatic credibility if
you play basketball."
And if any of those ideas don't
pan out, hopefully he'll at least
find a few more clients for his bar
ber shop.
