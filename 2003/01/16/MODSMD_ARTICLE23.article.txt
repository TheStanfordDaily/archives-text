## Cardinal men dive south for Bruin Invite 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Heading into the Bruin Diving Invitational this
weekend in Pasadena, Cardinal diving coach Rick
Schavone has one goal in mind for his divers, and sur
prisingly, it's not necessarily winning. Instead, he would
like to see them go head-to-head against every com
petitor they face.

"I want these guys to be competitive against the
other national-level divers in the league," Schavone
said. "If they lose, I won't be upset, as long as they can
stay competitive with the other athletes who have a
chance of diving at the national competition in
March."
So far the three divers, senior Gavin Olmstead and
sophomores Jeff Durbin and Adam Peterson, have
proven that they can be competitive on the boards.
Olmstead and Peterson each won an event at the re
cent dual meet against No. 1 ranked Michigan last
weekend, and Peterson snagged a pair of second-place
finishes on the 1 -meter and 3-meter boards at Southern
California's Trojan Invite earlier this season.
The Bruin Invite, in which the Cardinal and the
Trojans are the only confirmed entries, will give the
divers the opportunity to practice their skills and to gain
confidence on the boards. After testing the waters in the
first dual meet against Michigan on Friday, each diver
hopes to work on certain aspects of his dives that he feels
need improvement.
"At the Michigan meet, I had a lot more adrenaline
than I am used to having," Olmstead said. "This week
end I want to focus on staying calm while I execute my
dives. Though the meet probably will not have as many
competitors as we would like because UCLA does not
have a men's diving team, I think that the practice in
competition will be very valuable."
According to Schavone, USC diver Ray Vincent
should challenge the Cardinal team this weekend, as

he beat Peterson in the 3-meter
competition at the Trojan Invite.
Vincent, a sophomore from Lake
Forest, Calif., is back in good form
this year after sitting out last sea
son due to shoulder injuries.
Though the divers are looking
forward to testing their skills in
Pasadena, they are devoting most
of their attention to the upcoming

dual meets against Arizona and
Arizona Stateâ€”two diving power
houses.
"Arizona State has a Finnish
Olympian ori the team, and I would
like to upset him on at least one of
the boards," Olmstead said. "He is
favored to win NCAAs, so the div
ing should be very competitive in
Arizona."
Peterson, Durbin and Olm
stead all have their sights set on the
NCAA Championships later this
season. However, whether or not
the divers will compete at the na

tional competition depends entire
ly on their performances at the
zone qualifying meet in Oklahoma
City.
"Basically, you first have to
qualify for the zone meet, and then
your performance at that meet de
cides if you will compete at the
NCAA Championship," Durbin
said. "You cannot qualify for the
championships in Texas at a nor
mal dual meet."
Peterson and Olmstead have al
ready posted scores this season that
qualify them for the zone meet.
