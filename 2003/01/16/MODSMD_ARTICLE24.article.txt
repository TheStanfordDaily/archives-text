# SoCal schools offer test for Cardinal

Stanford diver Ashlee Rosen
thal is an athlete that has consider
able pressure on her to perform
well, but her smile lets the world
know that she doesn't really mind
the challenge.
Though she is only a sopho
more, Rosenthal has managed
to distinguish herself as a tough
competitor in NCAA contests.
She placed second and third in
the 3-meter and 1-meter compe
titions, respectively, in last
year's NCAA Zone meet, and
followed with 14th, 22nd and

Women's Diving
at Bruin Invite in Pasadena, Friday-
Saturday

25th place finishes in the 3-
meter, platform, and 1-meter
dives, respectively, at the NCAA
Championships.
Now that the 2002-03 season is
well underway, Rosenthal aims to
prove herself an even more formi
dable contender in her two
springboard events. She has al
ready posted impressive finishes
in winter competition.
"I feel like I'm where I should
be at this point in the season,"
Rosenthal said. "I'm just focusing

on working hard in training and
[on] attitude for competition."
Coach Rick Schavone agrees,
noting that his entire team has
been performing well in practice.
"They're diving the best they
have all year," Schavone said,
"They've had good training since
Christmas."
That training, as well as Rosen
thal's ability and confidence, will
be tried this weekend against No.
6 Southern California and No. 13
UCLA at the Bruin Diving Invite
in Pasadena.
USC boasts two of the top
divers in the nation, junior Nicci
Fusaro and last year's NCAA and

Pac-10 Diver of the Year, sopho
more Blythe Hartley. While
Fusaro's and Hartley's scores may
be out of reach, Schavone hopes to
keep the gap between them and
his squad small.
"The only one that can really go
head-on — who can even come
close to them —is Rosenthal,"
Schavone said. "[Hartley and
Fusaro] are in striking distance."
Rosenthal welcomes this evalu
ation of the matchup, as she is able
to say with unwavering eyes that
she is entirely capable of defeating
USC's stars.
Rosenthal will be joined this
weekend in Southern California by
the two other divers who have been
competing this entire season — se
nior McKenze Murphy and fresh
man Michaela Skloven — and by a
fourth Cardinal diver, sophomore
Lauren Donovan.
Like Rosenthal, Murphy has
posted solid scores in competition
this season, and Skloven is also
developing her talents.
According to Schavone,
Donovan dove very well in the
recent American Cup, despite
her absence from the first part of
the season.
Though all four are training
well, Schavone says that he won't
truly know where they stand until
he sees them in this weekend's
competition.
"We're going up against
UCLA and USC, and it's how we
compete and setde against those
girls which will be our best test,"
Schavone said. "We have to beat
the girls from UCLA. We can't let
any of them get ahead of Rosen
thal, Donovan [or] Murphy. If we
do, there's some distance we're
going to have to close between
now and February."
