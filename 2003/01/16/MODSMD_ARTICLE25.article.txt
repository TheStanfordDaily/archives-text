# Wrestling the right move for Ryan Hagen
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
In addition to capturing three
wrestling state titles, placing
fourth in the mile at the state tour
nament and being named an all
state free safety at Sidney High
School in Montana, Ryan Hagen
had his sights set on another sport.

"I actually wanted to play base
ball in college," Hagen said.
But as wrestling recruiting let
ters began pouring in from
schools like Princeton, Harvard,
Pennsylvania, Cornell and Stan
ford heading into his senior year
— and the baseball letters from
Division I schools were few —
Hagen made a visit to the Farm

that sealed his commitment to
wrestling and to Stanford.
Hanging up the cleats — and
the shoulder pads and the run
ning shoes — turned out to be a
pretty good decision for the über
athlete, who will head to Oregon
with the Cardinal (2-6) this week
end for matches against Oregon
and Oregon State tomorrow and
Portland State on Saturday.
After redshirting his freshman
season last year, Hagen has
reaped the rewards of his time in
the weight room and wrestling for
the Montana national team over
the summer, to the tune of 12
wins for Stanford this season, sec
ond most on the team.
A year's worth of waiting led
up to his collegiate debut in No
vember in Stanford's season
opening triangular against Menlo
College and Navy.

Redshirt freshman Ryari Hagen's first love in high school may have been
baseball, but his decision to wrestle collegiately has paid off, as his 12 wins
are the second most on the Cardinal squad.
And if Stanford coaches and
fans weren't expecting much
from the 174-pound Montanan
before that first bout, they were
certainly expecting a little more
2:11 later, when Hagen pinned
Menlo's David de la Fuente.
"From the start I just went out
there and wrestled hard because I
didn't have anything to lose,"
Hagen said. "I was just a redshirt
freshman so I don't think many
people expected much of me."
Hagen's impressive debut car
ried over to his next bout against
Navy, a 6-4 overtime thriller that
brought the Burnham Pavilion
crowd to its feet and to its loudest
level of the night.
That's a sound Hagen could
get used to hearing over the next
three or four years.
"Ryan has one of the best
work ethics in the room," Stan
ford coach Steve Buddie said.
"Everything he's accomplished
he deserves."
As one would expect from any
freshman, Hagen suffered some
minor setbacks in the following
weeks, dropping his first collegiate

dual against Cal State-Fullerton
and then wrestling below his po
tential at the California Open.
"I started getting a little ner
vous and had a couple of bad
matches," Hagen said. "I was ten
tative, and I was straying away
from the style I'm used to
wrestling."
Hagen summed up his familiar
style quite simply: "It's more ag
gressive. I think the California
style is more about finesse and
scrambling a lot, while I grew up
on with a more in-your-face beat
the-guy-to-death style."
Coming off a loss to nationally
ranked Matt Herrington of Penn
in the Cardinal's first home meet
of 2003 last week, Hagen demon
strated he had returned to his old
style of wrestling as he posted a 5-
1 record and a third-place finish at
the Aggie Open.
"I think my biggest improve
ment was on my feet," Hagen
said. "I don't think I got taken
down that whole tournament."
Meanwhile, Hagen has em
braced the presence of senior
teammate Harold Penson, who
dropped down to 174 over the
break, in his weight class.
"It was more pressure at first but
now it's more motivating, and it's
good to have someone to actually

push me and help me in the future,"
Hagen said. "He's a great working
partner and a talented wrestler. It's
really nice to have someone like that
in the wrestling room."
Penson's strong fifth-place fin
ish on Saturday, including five wins
and three pins, creates a tough sit
uation for the time being. Two of
the Cardinal's hottest wrestlers are
vying for only one spot, as Stanford
prepares for its three Oregon
meets this weekend.
"It doesn't make my job any
easier," Buddie said. "If their
competing fora starting spot
makes them perform better, then
it's a great problem to have. Yet,
at the same time they're both
wrestling so well that ideally I'd
like them both in the lineup."
With the heart of the Pacific-10
Conference season on the horizon
and visions of an NCAA bid float
ing around the Cardinal, Hagen
has taken a lot away from his first
few months as a regular contribu
tor to the team.
"I feel like I'm at a lot higher
level than when I started," Hagen
said. "I've gotten a lot more confi
dence, and even in practice my in
tensity has gone up."
That's bad news for future op
ponents — enough to make them
wish Hagen had chosen baseball.

uation for the time being. Two of
the Cardinal's hottest wrestlers are
vying for only one spot, as Stanford
prepares for its three Oregon
meets this weekend.
"It doesn't make my job any
easier," Buddie said. "If their
competing fora starting spot
makes them perform better, then
it's a great problem to have. Yet,
at the same time they're both
wrestling so well that ideally I'd
like them both in the lineup."
With the heart of the Pacific-10
Conference season on the horizon
and visions of an NCAA bid float
ing around the Cardinal, Hagen
has taken a lot away from his first
few months as a regular contribu
tor to the team.
"I feel like I'm at a lot higher
level than when I started," Hagen
said. "I've gotten a lot more confi
dence, and even in practice my in
tensity has gone up."
That's bad news for future op
ponents — enough to make them
wish Hagen had chosen baseball.
In addition to capturing three
wrestling state titles, placing
fourth in the mile at the state tour
nament and being named an all
state free safety at Sidney High
School in Montana, Ryan Hagen
had his sights set on another sport.

"I actually wanted to play base
ball in college," Hagen said.
But as wrestling recruiting let
ters began pouring in from
schools like Princeton, Harvard,
Pennsylvania, Cornell and Stan
ford heading into his senior year
— and the baseball letters from
Division I schools were few —
Hagen made a visit to the Farm

that sealed his commitment to
wrestling and to Stanford.
Hanging up the cleats — and
the shoulder pads and the run
ning shoes — turned out to be a
pretty good decision for the über
athlete, who will head to Oregon
with the Cardinal (2-6) this week
end for matches against Oregon
and Oregon State tomorrow and
Portland State on Saturday.
After redshirting his freshman
season last year, Hagen has
reaped the rewards of his time in
the weight room and wrestling for
the Montana national team over
the summer, to the tune of 12
wins for Stanford this season, sec
ond most on the team.
A year's worth of waiting led
up to his collegiate debut in No
vember in Stanford's season
opening triangular against Menlo
College and Navy.

Redshirt freshman Ryari Hagen's first love in high school may have been
baseball, but his decision to wrestle collegiately has paid off, as his 12 wins
are the second most on the Cardinal squad.
And if Stanford coaches and
fans weren't expecting much
from the 174-pound Montanan
before that first bout, they were
certainly expecting a little more
2:11 later, when Hagen pinned
Menlo's David de la Fuente.
"From the start I just went out
there and wrestled hard because I
didn't have anything to lose,"
Hagen said. "I was just a redshirt
freshman so I don't think many
people expected much of me."
Hagen's impressive debut car
ried over to his next bout against
Navy, a 6-4 overtime thriller that
brought the Burnham Pavilion
crowd to its feet and to its loudest
level of the night.
That's a sound Hagen could
get used to hearing over the next
three or four years.
"Ryan has one of the best
work ethics in the room," Stan
ford coach Steve Buddie said.
"Everything he's accomplished
he deserves."
As one would expect from any
freshman, Hagen suffered some
minor setbacks in the following
weeks, dropping his first collegiate

dual against Cal State-Fullerton
and then wrestling below his po
tential at the California Open.
"I started getting a little ner
vous and had a couple of bad
matches," Hagen said. "I was ten
tative, and I was straying away
from the style I'm used to
wrestling."
Hagen summed up his familiar
style quite simply: "It's more ag
gressive. I think the California
style is more about finesse and
scrambling a lot, while I grew up
on with a more in-your-face beat
the-guy-to-death style."
Coming off a loss to nationally
ranked Matt Herrington of Penn
in the Cardinal's first home meet
of 2003 last week, Hagen demon
strated he had returned to his old
style of wrestling as he posted a 5-
1 record and a third-place finish at
the Aggie Open.
"I think my biggest improve
ment was on my feet," Hagen
said. "I don't think I got taken
down that whole tournament."
Meanwhile, Hagen has em
braced the presence of senior
teammate Harold Penson, who
dropped down to 174 over the
break, in his weight class.
"It was more pressure at first but
now it's more motivating, and it's
good to have someone to actually

push me and help me in the future,"
Hagen said. "He's a great working
partner and a talented wrestler. It's
really nice to have someone like that
in the wrestling room."
Penson's strong fifth-place fin
ish on Saturday, including five wins
and three pins, creates a tough sit
uation for the time being. Two of
the Cardinal's hottest wrestlers are
vying for only one spot, as Stanford
prepares for its three Oregon
meets this weekend.
"It doesn't make my job any
easier," Buddie said. "If their
