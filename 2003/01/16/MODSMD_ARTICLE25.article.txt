# Wrestling the right move for Ryan Hagen
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
In addition to capturing three
wrestling state titles, placing
fourth in the mile at the state tour
nament and being named an all
state free safety at Sidney High
School in Montana, Ryan Hagen
had his sights set on another sport.

Wrestling
at Oregon, Friday, 3:00 p.m.
at Oregon St., Friday, 7:00 p.m.
at Portland St., Saturday, 1:00 p.m.

"I actually wanted to play base
ball in college," Hagen said.
But as wrestling recruiting let
ters began pouring in from
schools like Princeton, Harvard,
Pennsylvania, Cornell and Stan
ford heading into his senior year
— and the baseball letters from
Division I schools were few —
Hagen made a visit to the Farm

that sealed his commitment to
wrestling and to Stanford.
Hanging up the cleats — and
the shoulder pads and the run
ning shoes — turned out to be a
pretty good decision for the über
athlete, who will head to Oregon
with the Cardinal (2-6) this week
end for matches against Oregon
and Oregon State tomorrow and
Portland State on Saturday.
After redshirting his freshman
season last year, Hagen has
reaped the rewards of his time in
the weight room and wrestling for
the Montana national team over
the summer, to the tune of 12
wins for Stanford this season, sec
ond most on the team.
A year's worth of waiting led
up to his collegiate debut in No
vember in Stanford's season
opening triangular against Menlo
College and Navy.

Redshirt freshman Ryari Hagen's first love in high school may have been
baseball, but his decision to wrestle collegiately has paid off, as his 12 wins
are the second most on the Cardinal squad.
