Since his arrival on the Farm, Vin
Lananna has built Stanford into a peren
nial powerhouse in collegiate distance
running. The success of his distance run
ners has helped carry the Cardinal to the
top of the national scene of track and
field.

Indoor Track and Field
at National Pole Vault Summit in Reno,
Friday-Saturday

Although indoor track and field com
petitions consist of events from 60 to
5,000 meters and include field events
like long jump, pole vault and weight
toss, strength in one core area can usual
ly provide most of the points needed to
win a championship.
And in the last few years, the success
of the distance squad has largely deter
mined the success of the whole team.
But this year will be different.
After their accomplishments in cross
country, there is no doubt the men's and
women's distance squads are once again
a force to be reckoned with on the track.
But the Cardinal has quietly been build
ing a stable of capable sprint and field
athletes who are ready to compete with
the best in the nation.
"Things are looking real good on the

sprinters and jumpers' side," said se
nior longjumper Milton Little. "We are
just hoping it carries over into the in
door season. I feel that every year the
team is getting a little larger, and we are
trying to keep up with the distance and
middle-distance runners."
Little is one of the experienced field
athletes that the squads will be relying on
for points in conference and national
competition. And in those competitions,
every point counts. If the men's squad
had scored just four more points at last
year's indoor national championships, it
would have been 15th instead of 35th.
Once again, the Cardinal is already a
contender for an indoor national title as
both the men's and women's squads are
ranked fifth in the preseason poll.
Louisiana State leads the rankings on
both the men's and women's sides, while
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rival
UCLA is tied for third in the women's
poll.
Despite the growing strengdi of the
sprint and field programs, distance run
ners still headline the Cardinal lineup
this year.
Junior Don Sage is currently the top
ranked individual in the men's mile
while senior Lauren Fleshman is No. 1
in the women's 3,000 meters. Both are
expected to help the Cardinal in the dis
tance medley, where the Stanford
women and men are ranked third and

fourdi, respectively.
"Everyone is excited to define and
evaluate our goals for this track season,"
Fleshman said. "We are preparing for
our best season yet."
In the men's field events, senior Nick
Welihozkiy is recognized in the weight
toss while senior Omer I nan earned All-
American accolades last season and
holds the school record in the javelin.
For the women, junior Jillian Ca
marena has been one of the top colle
giate throwers in the nation since com
ing to Stanford. She claimed fourth
place last year in the shot put at the in
door national championships.
The Cardinal also looks very promis
ing in the men's longjump and women's
pole vault.
Little hit a provisional distance in the
long jump last year, but failed to make
the final cut for the national champi
onships. He has begun training with one
of the last year's best prep triple jumpers
â€” freshman Solomon Welch.
"I think last year was kinda frustrat
ing in the jumps," Litde said. "But I've
been making a lot of adjustments, and I
feel like I am a lot further mentally than
I was last year."
In the women's pole vault, senior Ail-
American Kathleen Donoghue looks to
contend fora national tide this year.
"Our new coach, Miche, has been
working us really hard and developing a

powerful run," Donoghue said. "I am
confident that my training will take me
to new heights this season."
Freshman pole vaulter Samantha
Shepard comes to the Farm as one of the
most accomplished prep pole vau Iters
ever. She and Donoghue will make up
one of the most deadly pairs in collegiate
pole vault.
The sprints at Stanford are the
strongest they have been in years. On
the women's side, with great returning
talent in sophomore Ail-American
Christine Moschella and strong new re
cruits like freshmen Jakki Bailey and
Chauntae Bayne, the sprints are looking
to be competitive on the national level
for the first time since Olympian Ghryste
Gaines left the Farm.
"The sprints squad is the best we've
ever had," Donoghue said. "It's exciting
to think about how well we'll all come to
gether.
On the men's side, sophomores Ail-
American Curtis Goehring and Nick
Sebes lead a talented young squad that
include great recruits like T.J. Rushing
and Chris Ryan.
"I feel that the new athletes are already
contributing a lot," little said. "The more
competitive practices become, the more
competitive we are in meets."
Finally, behind Sage and Fleshman,

Senior pole-vaulter Kathleen Donoghue will help lead a
growing contingent of jumpers, throwers and sprinters
that look to contribute a larger share of the team's point
total than in years past.
