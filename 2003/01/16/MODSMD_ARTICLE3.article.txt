# Meeting held on minority admissions
## Support for affirmative action voiced at town hall meeting last night 
### STEPHANIE CONDON 
Last night, approximately 50 students attend
ed a town hall meeting on minority admissions at
Stanford sponsored by the Students of Color
Coalition. Many voiced concerns that the Univer
sity should play a larger role in the ongoing na
tional debate over affirmative action.
"The strongest issue right now should be the
national assault on affirmative action," said ju
nior Leigh Torrence, referring to the University
of Michigan's admissions policy currently debat
ed by the Supreme Court. "We need to take a
stance for other schools being attacked. We have
a responsibility to more than just our Stanford
bubble."
The purpose of last night's meeting, held at
El Centro Chicano at 7 p.m., was to devise a plan
of action that members of the coalition, and the
student body in general, could partake in to
bring about change on campus â€” such as
greater socioeconomic diversity and increased
queer sensitivity.
Members plan to take their newly formed
agenda and a list of demands for improving the
diversity of the student body to a meeting that will
be held with Provost John Etchemendy on Jan.
27. Lolita Roibal, a senior involved with the coali
tion, stressed to those present that their goals are
not exclusive to any particular race or ethnicity.
"Everyone in this room is part of our con
stituency," she said. "We want to know what your
biggest priorities are."
One priority that was firmly expressed at the

meeting was the action Stanford students should
take in response to the recent national scrutiny of
affirmative action.
Sophomore Khalilah Karim discussed actions
being taken by the national group By Any Means
Necessary, which identifies itself an "anti-racist,
anti-sexist student activist organization."
