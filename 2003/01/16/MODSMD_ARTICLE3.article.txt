# Meeting held on minority admissions
## Support for affirmative action voiced at town hall meeting last night 
### STEPHANIE CONDON 
Last night, approximately 50 students attend
ed a town hall meeting on minority admissions at
Stanford sponsored by the Students of Color
Coalition. Many voiced concerns that the Univer
sity should play a larger role in the ongoing na
tional debate over affirmative action.
"The strongest issue right now should be the
national assault on affirmative action," said ju
nior Leigh Torrence, referring to the University
of Michigan's admissions policy currently debat
ed by the Supreme Court. "We need to take a
stance for other schools being attacked. We have
a responsibility to more than just our Stanford
bubble."
The purpose of last night's meeting, held at
El Centro Chicano at 7 p.m., was to devise a plan
of action that members of the coalition, and the
student body in general, could partake in to
bring about change on campus — such as
greater socioeconomic diversity and increased
queer sensitivity.
Members plan to take their newly formed
agenda and a list of demands for improving the
diversity of the student body to a meeting that will
be held with Provost John Etchemendy on Jan.
27. Lolita Roibal, a senior involved with the coali
tion, stressed to those present that their goals are
not exclusive to any particular race or ethnicity.
"Everyone in this room is part of our con
stituency," she said. "We want to know what your
biggest priorities are."
One priority that was firmly expressed at the

meeting was the action Stanford students should
take in response to the recent national scrutiny of
affirmative action.
Sophomore Khalilah Karim discussed actions
being taken by the national group By Any Means
Necessary, which identifies itself an "anti-racist,
anti-sexist student activist organization."

campus of the University of
Michigan, as well as a march in
Washington, D.C., on the day the
Supreme Court will hear the two
University of Michigan affirma
tive action cases, Gratz vs.
Bollinger and Grutter vs.
Bollinger.
Khalilah noted that while the
outcome of these cases would not
directly affect private universities
such as Stanford, a decision
against affirmative action could
still affect Stanford's admissions
process. Khalilah explained that if
a national standard were set,
"Stanford might feel compelled to
go with the flow."
Students expressed interest in
the march in Washington and
suggested creating an organized
trip for Stanford students to the
march.
There seemed to be a general

consensus that the University it
self should take an active role in
the affirmative action dispute.
"Stanford has a lot of clout on the
international stage; we should try
to get [University] President
[John] Hennessy to make a state
ment supporting affirmative ac
tion on a national level," said se
nior Sonrisa Lucero.
While it was acknowledged
among the students that such an
action could be a risky move for
Stanford, students considered it
worth pursuing.
They believe Stanford has an
obligation to take a stance on this
issue because of its great diversity
on campus.
Senior Kuusela Hilo noted that
51 percent of this year's freshman
class are students of color. But she
added that necessary improve
ments must be made.
As an example, Hilo cited the
fact that though Chinese Ameri
cans and Filipino Americans
make up similar percentages of
the Asian-American population in

California, Chinese Americans
outnumber Filipino Americans at
Stanford by 20 to 1.
The coalition also brought up
the lack of socioeconomic diversi
ty at Stanford. After much discus
sion, attendants of the meeting
decided that the best affirmative
action policy fora University such
as Stanford to adopt would in
clude both considering race and
socioeconomic background.
"Affirmative action is like a vac
cine: It's a small injustice taken to
cure a large one," said Adam
Schwartz, a freshman.
Representatives of the coali
tion emphasized that any changes
that should take place on campus
need to be initiated by students.
"The push will begin with stu
dents," Karim said. "Changes can
be made."
The coalition is encouraging
students to attend an educational
forum on National Take Affirma
tive Action Day, which is Jan. 21.
It will be held at noon in White
