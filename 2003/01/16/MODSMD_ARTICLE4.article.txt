## NEW RESOLUTIONS 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The new year didn't send thou
sands of Stanford students flock
ing to their journals, diaries and
post-it pads to jot down a list of
goals for the months to come.
Many students confessed that
while they've made New Year's
resolutions in the past, this Janu
ary they didn't feel inspired. "I just
don't see the point," and "It's not
worth it" were among the explana
tions students offered for their ap
athy.
Making resolutions hasn't been
part of freshman Mark Lieber's
agenda this month.
"A few years ago I told myself
I'd swim or go to the gym three
times a week, and I was pretty
good about following up on my
plans," he said. "This year, I didn't
really think about making resolu
tions."
Law school student Bobby
Elant expressed a similar senti
ment.
"I've kind of stopped making
resolutions," Elam said. "I guess
cutting down my caffeine intake
could be considered my resolution
this year."
An ABCNews.com article on
New Year's resolutions noted that
"failing to keep resolutions keeps
many people from making them."
The article highlighted that peo
ple often don't follow through
with their plans — surveys show
that only one in three people who
resolve to exercise are still visiting

the gym six months later.
Many Stanford students are
making lighthearted, humorous
resolutions, if they bother to set
goals at all. In fact, a common am
bition this year is the resolution
not to have a resolution.
Freshman Mark Berghausen
has made the same joint agree
ment with his sister every Jan. 1 for
the past five years.
"We try to become as fat as we
can," he said. "It's an ironic twist
on everyone else's New Year's res
olutions to 'lose some weight.' It
has yet to succeed, but it gives us a
reason to laugh and eat up the rest
of the Christmas cookies."
Senior Zach Burgess annually
resolves to give up celibacy and to
stop letting other people tell him
what to do.
Sophomore Dan Van Fleet
promised himself he wouldn't
have any nine or ten o'clock class
es.
"I've failed," Van Fleet said,
laughing.
A few students are still making
the more traditional resolutions:
exercising, calling home more
often, losing weight and putting
an end to procrastination are at
the top of the list. But they don't
usually write down what they hope
to accomplish. Most are pessimistic
about actually following through
with their plans; they doubt they'll
be able to stick to them for more
than a couple of weeks.
Freshman Alice Chow likes to
keep what she calls "a mental pic
ture of [her] goals" rather than
writing them out.
Chow isn't very optimistic
about her plan to work more effi
ciently, keep in better contact with
friends and family, and eat health
ier foods.
"I don't think I'm going to be
able to achieve everything I set out
to do," Chow said. "I'll probably
lose track of my goals in a few
months — it's so easy to lapse

into old habits."
Not everyone treats New Year's
resolutions so lightly. A small
group of students still uses the
start of January to regroup and
come up with serious projects they
intend to pursue.
Sophomore Louisa Chang uses
the start of the new year as a time
to gather her thoughts. She ar
rived at her resolutions by taking a
walk around Lake Lagunita alone.
"My New Year's resolution is to
learn to love myself and to take
care of myself," Chang said. "Self
love is loving myself for who I am,
not for my accomplishments or in
terms of other people."
