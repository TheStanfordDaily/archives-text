# GSB keeps ethics curriculum
## Meanwhile, association proposes more emphasis on ethics 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is sticking with its inte
grated curriculum on ethics for
now, despite a proposal last week
from an accreditation association
that stated the value of ethics in
business school should be re-em
phasized.
The Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business en
couraged schools to develop
codes of ethical conduct for stu
dents, among other steps that
would would promote ethical
learning. Despite such sugges
tions, the association has stopped
short of requiring students to take
specific courses.
As a result, the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business has
made no plans to changes its cur
rent curriculum, used for over 30
years, with a pre-term course on
ethics to provide a framework
and subsequent mentions of
ethics frequently within day-to
day courses.
Robert Joss, dean of the GSB,
released a detailed letter earlier
this month reminding students,
faculty and alumni why the school
needs to place ethics in a central
role in all courses.
"For the general manager,
questions of ethics and ethical be
havior are everyday concerns,"
Joss said. He added that ethics
should be taught in every course,
not just a specific one.
"Ethical questions can and
should be subjected to disciplined
thought," Joss said. "The frame
works [we teach] give students the

tools to do this."
While the GSB has ethical re
quirements that exceed those set
by any accreditation board, Stan
ford has not stopped re-valuating
its ethical curriculum.
"The role of a business school
in general is to give people frame
works, ways to think about ethical
questions and ways to talk about
ethical questions," said David
Kreps, associate dean for acade
mics at the GSB. "[Our courses]
promote reasoned approaches
about these things and demon
strate how many different points
of view there are."
David Baron, one of three pro
fessors who annually teaches the
pre-term course in ethics, pointed
out that an ethical focus is nothing
new for the school.

"We've been teaching the pre
term course for well over 30
years," he said.
He went on to point out exact
ly how other courses integrate
ethics, citing a course that he
teaches on business and the public
as an example. In the course, the
students examine the ethical is
sues surrounding Internet priva
cy, dealing both with privacy itself
and the differences in privacy reg
ulations between the European
Union and the United States.
These situations are dealt with not
as profit and loss columns but as
ethical decisions that require just
as much consideration as share
holder value.

croeconomics class of price dis
crimination and implicit collu
sion, noting that ethics comes up
in about a quarter of his classes.
"[The importance of ethics] is
highly variable depending on the
course," he said. In a course on
human resource management,
about half the sessions may have
an ethics component, and in a pri
vate equity investment class, three
quarters of the time ethics may
appear.
Business School students have
mixed reviews about how often
ethics come up in the curriculum.
Ann Skeeters-Behrens, a sec
ond-year student at the school,
said that while she knew there was
more emphasis being placed on
ethics, she hasn't seen it in her
courses.
"I can't say that I have noticed
it," she said.
"Students extremely interest
ed can take courses [in ethics],"
said second-year student Lin
Chang. But she could not recall

ethics being integrated into the
curriculum she took.
Other students saw ethics
more prominently placed. Eric
Liu, another student at the
school, said ethics were a frequent
topic in his classes.
"Ethics is always a pretty big
issue," he said. "There is always
someone who brings it up in
class."
Liu cited a recent example
where students debated whether
it is ethical to market brand-name
prescription drugs, such as Paxil,
on television, possibly making
people think they have conditions
they don't have.
"The [pre-term] ethics course
sets a framework," he said, em
phasizing that both students and
faculty on use the introductory
course to guide business decisions
throughout the two years of
school and beyond.
Students agreed with Kreps
and Baron that Stanford's cur
rent system is better than having a
required course in ethics. Kreps
pointed out that if students were
forced to balance an ethics course
with a course in accounting and fi
nance, where the money is, they

would probably pay more atten
tion to a financially lucrative
topic.
"I'm not sure I would support
a required ethics course,"
Skeeters-Behrens said.
"It doesn't help if you make it a
course; ethics must be internal
ized," Chang added.
The association of business
schools also added a new aspect to
the accreditation standards, re
quiring all schools to have an eth
ical code of conduct for students,
faculty and administrators.
Ethical behavior at the school is
an important part of teaching
ethics, the association said.
"[Proper conduct is] a more
potent form of teaching than
what goes on in the classroom,"
Blood said.
The University has well-docu
mented policies that extend be
yond the range of the GSB. Kreps
cited the Honor Code and Fun
damental Standard as the key as
pects of the school's implied ethi
cal code of conduct. He also em
phasized the code of conduct that
students are expected to follow.
In his letter, Joss noted many
distinct ways the school is working

to improve the teaching of ethics
in the classroom. This fall, a facul
ty retreat was held where at least
half the time was spent address
ing ethical issues, focusing on how
the faculty could learn from and
help each other teach better
courses.
A group of professors is de
signing a leadership program fo
cusing on experiential learning
where ethics will be a "substantial
chunk" of the course, according
to Kreps.
"Good leadership almost has to
be ethical leadership," Kreps said.
GSB Prof. Maureen McNichols
has developed an executive edu
cation course on corporate gover
nance that will include teaching
current business figures about
certain ethical frames of refer
ence.
Joss said he plans to bring
speakers to campus who can
speak specifically on ethical is
sues.
In regard to the overall conflu
ence of ethics education at the
GSB, Kreps concluded, "There's
surely more we could do, but we
think we've got the right machin
ery and structures in place."

Liu cited a recent example
where students debated whether
it is ethical to market brand-name
prescription drugs, such as Paxil,
on television, possibly making
people think they have conditions
they don't have.
"The [pre-term] ethics course
sets a framework," he said, em
phasizing that both students and
faculty on use the introductory
course to guide business decisions
throughout the two years of
school and beyond.
Students agreed with Kreps
and Baron that Stanford's cur
rent system is better than having a
required course in ethics. Kreps
pointed out that if students were
forced to balance an ethics course
with a course in accounting and fi
nance, where the money is, they

would probably pay more atten
tion to a financially lucrative
topic.
"I'm not sure I would support
a required ethics course,"
Skeeters-Behrens said.
"It doesn't help if you make it a
course; ethics must be internal
ized," Chang added.
The association of business
schools also added a new aspect to
the accreditation standards, re
quiring all schools to have an eth
ical code of conduct for students,
faculty and administrators.
Ethical behavior at the school is
an important part of teaching
ethics, the association said.
"[Proper conduct is] a more
potent form of teaching than
what goes on in the classroom,"
Blood said.
The University has well-docu
mented policies that extend be
yond the range of the GSB. Kreps
cited the Honor Code and Fun
damental Standard as the key as
pects of the school's implied ethi
cal code of conduct. He also em
phasized the code of conduct that
students are expected to follow.
In his letter, Joss noted many
distinct ways the school is working

to improve the teaching of ethics
in the classroom. This fall, a facul
ty retreat was held where at least
half the time was spent address
ing ethical issues, focusing on how
the faculty could learn from and
help each other teach better
courses.
A group of professors is de
signing a leadership program fo
cusing on experiential learning
where ethics will be a "substantial
chunk" of the course, according
to Kreps.
"Good leadership almost has to
be ethical leadership," Kreps said.
GSB Prof. Maureen McNichols
has developed an executive edu
cation course on corporate gover
nance that will include teaching
current business figures about
certain ethical frames of refer
ence.
Joss said he plans to bring
speakers to campus who can
speak specifically on ethical is
sues.
In regard to the overall conflu
ence of ethics education at the
GSB, Kreps concluded, "There's
surely more we could do, but we
think we've got the right machin
ery and structures in place."
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is sticking with its inte
grated curriculum on ethics for
now, despite a proposal last week
from an accreditation association
that stated the value of ethics in
business school should be re-em
phasized.
The Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business en
couraged schools to develop
codes of ethical conduct for stu
dents, among other steps that
would would promote ethical
learning. Despite such sugges
tions, the association has stopped
short of requiring students to take
specific courses.
As a result, the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business has
made no plans to changes its cur
rent curriculum, used for over 30
years, with a pre-term course on
ethics to provide a framework
and subsequent mentions of
ethics frequently within day-to
day courses.
Robert Joss, dean of the GSB,
released a detailed letter earlier
this month reminding students,
faculty and alumni why the school
needs to place ethics in a central
role in all courses.
"For the general manager,
questions of ethics and ethical be
havior are everyday concerns,"
Joss said. He added that ethics
should be taught in every course,
not just a specific one.
"Ethical questions can and
should be subjected to disciplined
thought," Joss said. "The frame
works [we teach] give students the

tools to do this."
While the GSB has ethical re
quirements that exceed those set
by any accreditation board, Stan
ford has not stopped re-valuating
its ethical curriculum.
"The role of a business school
in general is to give people frame
works, ways to think about ethical
questions and ways to talk about
ethical questions," said David
Kreps, associate dean for acade
mics at the GSB. "[Our courses]
promote reasoned approaches
about these things and demon
strate how many different points
of view there are."
David Baron, one of three pro
fessors who annually teaches the
pre-term course in ethics, pointed
out that an ethical focus is nothing
new for the school.

"We've been teaching the pre
term course for well over 30
years," he said.
He went on to point out exact
ly how other courses integrate
ethics, citing a course that he
teaches on business and the public
as an example. In the course, the
students examine the ethical is
sues surrounding Internet priva
cy, dealing both with privacy itself
and the differences in privacy reg
ulations between the European
Union and the United States.
These situations are dealt with not
as profit and loss columns but as
ethical decisions that require just
as much consideration as share
holder value.

in about a quarter of his classes.
"[The importance of ethics] is
highly variable depending on the
course," he said. In a course on
human resource management,
about half the sessions may have
an ethics component, and in a pri
vate equity investment class, three
quarters of the time ethics may
appear.
Business School students have
mixed reviews about how often
ethics come up in the curriculum.
Ann Skeeters-Behrens, a sec
ond-year student at the school,
said that while she knew there was
more emphasis being placed on
ethics, she hasn't seen it in her
courses.
"I can't say that I have noticed
it," she said.
"Students extremely interest
ed can take courses [in ethics],"
said second-year student Lin
Chang. But she could not recall

ethics being integrated into the
curriculum she took.
Other students saw ethics
more prominently placed. Eric
Liu, another student at the
school, said ethics were a frequent
topic in his classes.
"Ethics is always a pretty big
issue," he said. "There is always
someone who brings it up in
class."
