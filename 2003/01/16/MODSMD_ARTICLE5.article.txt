# GSB keeps ethics curriculum
## Meanwhile, association proposes more emphasis on ethics 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business is sticking with its inte
grated curriculum on ethics for
now, despite a proposal last week
from an accreditation association
that stated the value of ethics in
business school should be re-em
phasized.
The Association to Advance
Collegiate Schools of Business en
couraged schools to develop
codes of ethical conduct for stu
dents, among other steps that
would would promote ethical
learning. Despite such sugges
tions, the association has stopped
short of requiring students to take
specific courses.
As a result, the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business has
made no plans to changes its cur
rent curriculum, used for over 30
years, with a pre-term course on
ethics to provide a framework
and subsequent mentions of
ethics frequently within day-to
day courses.
Robert Joss, dean of the GSB,
released a detailed letter earlier
this month reminding students,
faculty and alumni why the school
needs to place ethics in a central
role in all courses.
"For the general manager,
questions of ethics and ethical be
havior are everyday concerns,"
Joss said. He added that ethics
should be taught in every course,
not just a specific one.
"Ethical questions can and
should be subjected to disciplined
thought," Joss said. "The frame
works [we teach] give students the

tools to do this."
While the GSB has ethical re
quirements that exceed those set
by any accreditation board, Stan
ford has not stopped re-valuating
its ethical curriculum.
"The role of a business school
in general is to give people frame
works, ways to think about ethical
questions and ways to talk about
ethical questions," said David
Kreps, associate dean for acade
mics at the GSB. "[Our courses]
promote reasoned approaches
about these things and demon
strate how many different points
of view there are."
David Baron, one of three pro
fessors who annually teaches the
pre-term course in ethics, pointed
out that an ethical focus is nothing
new for the school.

"We've been teaching the pre
term course for well over 30
years," he said.
He went on to point out exact
ly how other courses integrate
ethics, citing a course that he
teaches on business and the public
as an example. In the course, the
students examine the ethical is
sues surrounding Internet priva
cy, dealing both with privacy itself
and the differences in privacy reg
ulations between the European
Union and the United States.
These situations are dealt with not
as profit and loss columns but as
ethical decisions that require just
as much consideration as share
holder value.

The Stanford Graduate School of Business offers a pre-term course on ethics
to provide framework for subsequent study. No changes will be made to the
curriculum, despite a new proposal from an accreditation association.
