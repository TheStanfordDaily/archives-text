# Student-led courses offer diverse choices

### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As classes begin this quarter, some students are pur
suing their education at Stanford beyond the pages of
the Bulletin — through a few Student Initiated Cours
es offered this winter.
Students will be teaching classes on the language and
culture of the Luo people of Kenya and Uganda, U.S.-
Mexico border issues and related topics, and an intro
duction to sexual health.
SIC allows students with unique skills, like Luo lan
guage, to share those skills with other students," said se
nior Britt Ehrhardt, course co-leader for "African and
Middle Eastern Languages 192A: Luo Language and
Culture."
"The program benefits everyone involved: Course
leaders practice teaching and their students have the
opportunity to explore new academic areas," Ehrhardt
said.
Some classes are intrinsic to other organizations on
campus. The "Comprehensive Sexual Health" class this
quarter, for example, is led by students from the Sexu
al Health Peer Resource Center, and is required in
order to become a counselor at the center.
Other classes seek links with existing organizations,
and start new, longer-term projects. As part of "Seeing
Imaginary Lines: the U.S.-Mexico Border," students
will be active in meeting Stanford workers' needs on
campus through English and computer-literacy classes,
as well as developing a forum for worker expression.
Since its inception two years ago, SIC has been well
supported by students, winning special-fees approval
last spring by 76 percent of all voting ASSU members.
Past classes have ranged in subject from sustainable
agriculture to Objectivism; students have been general
ly very positive about their experiences in them.
"I took a class on the prison-in
dustrial complex last year," said se
nior Trey Freeman. "We looked at
both sides of the issues: from pris
oners' rights to victim's rights —
and why this country has two mil
lion people in jail right now. It's
the only course that I've taken
here that's really hands on, that
was so involved with issues that we
were studying.
"We got to take a trip to a prison
and meet the people who lived or
worked there, and so we learned a
lot about both sides. The field trips
we went on and the people that we
met helped put a human face on
some very complex issues. The
course was one of the best that I've
taken at Stanford, and it was stu
dent-initiated."
Some faculty members and stu
dents in the program have ex
pressed concern that it offers elec
tive credit to students while being
unclear about guidelines for class
organization and faculty involve
ment.
In response, the program is
adopting newer, stricter guide
lines for courses.
"We have created two contracts
which the student and faculty
sponsor have to sign, which clearly
delineate their respective respon
sibilities," said senior Molly Cline
hens, co-director of SIC. "Other
improvements we're making in
clude a newly erected Web site
[assu.stanford.edu/sic] and an ad
visory committee composed of fac
ulty, staff and students, which will
help oversee SlC's development."
Student leaders are also re
quired to attend four training ses
sions prior to the quarter in which
the class will be held.
Ehrhardt reinforced the prima
ry mission of SIC.
"The University is simply not
able to offer everything that every
one wants to learn," she said. "SIC
helps to fill the gap."
