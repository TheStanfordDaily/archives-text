# Student-led courses offer diverse choices

As classes begin this quarter, some students are pur
suing their education at Stanford beyond the pages of
the Bulletin â€” through a few Student Initiated Cours
es offered this winter.
Students will be teaching classes on the language and
culture of the Luo people of Kenya and Uganda, U.S.-
Mexico border issues and related topics, and an intro
duction to sexual health.
SIC allows students with unique skills, like Luo lan
guage, to share those skills with other students," said se
nior Britt Ehrhardt, course co-leader for "African and
Middle Eastern Languages 192A: Luo Language and
Culture."
"The program benefits everyone involved: Course
leaders practice teaching and their students have the
opportunity to explore new academic areas," Ehrhardt
said.
Some classes are intrinsic to other organizations on
campus. The "Comprehensive Sexual Health" class this
quarter, for example, is led by students from the Sexu
al Health Peer Resource Center, and is required in
order to become a counselor at the center.
Other classes seek links with existing organizations,
and start new, longer-term projects. As part of "Seeing
Imaginary Lines: the U.S.-Mexico Border," students
will be active in meeting Stanford workers' needs on
campus through English and computer-literacy classes,
as well as developing a forum for worker expression.
Since its inception two years ago, SIC has been well
supported by students, winning special-fees approval
last spring by 76 percent of all voting ASSU members.
Past classes have ranged in subject from sustainable
agriculture to Objectivism; students have been general
ly very positive about their experiences in them.
