One Scientist's Search
for Genes That Prolong Youth
Ageless Quest is a personal,
sometimes controversial,
account of the pursuit of a
genetic "cure" for aging by
an expert in the field. The
author is the Novartis
Professor of Biology at the
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Aging
has always been regarded
as a highly complex process
with many degenerative
changes leading to the
cessation of life. But recent
research has identified a
relatively simple mechanism
that governs the pace of
aging. Lenny Guarente's
Ageless Quest is a scientific
detective story for the baby
boom generation. It offers an
insider's view of an area of
potentially astonishing high
reward-and equally high
risk.
