Need Funding?
The Stanford Film Society (SFS) is proud to announce the return of our
annual film grant program. SFS wants to help you make a film. We will
be giving away several film grants of up to $500. Because our funding
comes from ASSU special fee, only Stanford students are eligible for the
grants. We will accept submissions from any student regardless of year,
major or experience. Proposals can be made by individuals or by small
groups who intend to work as a team. The project must be completed
within the 2002-2003 academic year and a final, screenable version
must be delivered to the Film Society by May 8, 2003 in time to be
shown at the film society's film festival May 15-17. (Note, projects being
done for classes will not be considered.) Information about the
application process as well as an application form can be found at
http://ww.stanford.edu/group/sfs
Applications are due on January 22, 2003 by 5:00 PM outside
Room 319 of Slavianskii Dom.
