# Knize shoots to win Daily EIC contest
## 
### PENGUIN 
In a surprising victory, senior
Megan Knize, managing editor for
special sections, defeated a stuffed
penguin doll to become The Stan
ford Daily's next editor in chief.
Knize will take control of The
Daily on Feb. 1.
In lieu of an election, The Daily
decided to choose its next leader in
a contest inspired by FOX's new
show "Man versus Beast." Knize
had to play a winner-take-all game
ofH-O-R-S-E against the penguin.
Although she had never picked
up a basketball in her life, Knize
flourished under the tutelage of
Daily 11-O-R-S-F specialists sopho
more Jen Graham, a news editor,
and senior Ezra Callahan, manag
ing editor for sports. It also helped
that the penguin is six inches tall

and is missing one eye.
"I knew it was going to be tough
when I found out that we had to
play basketball," Knize said. "But
nothing was going to keep me
from bringing female dominance
back to The Daily."
As soon as she was declared the
winner, Knize announced The
Daily's new production schedule:
"Joe Millionaire" on Mondays,
"The Real World" on Tuesdays,
"The Bachelorette" on Wednes
days and "Friends" on Thursdays.
"I'm out," said Managing Edi
tor for News Will Oremus, a male.
"I heard a rumor that instead of
watching the Super Bowl, Megan
wants to show 'Amelie.' "
As a part of her anti-male agen
da, Knize plans to discontinue The
Daily's sports section and replace it
with an "accountability" section. If
you're pissed off at The Daily, for
whatever reason, just e-mail Knize,
and you'll be in the newspaper.
Upon hearing of Knize's victo
ry, the sports department re
signed in protest and vowed to
start its own newspaper, in which
editors promise to misidentify
every Stanford athlete in their
photo captions.
Knize also plans to put the pic
tures and bios of Daily staff mem
bers on The Daily's Web site. In
order to boost the newspaper's
revenues, The Daily's Web site will
now double as an online dating
auction service. Former staff pimp
Mikey Lee is already going for
more than $1 million.
"I'd pay $2 million fora shot at
Mikey Lee," on-leave News Editor
Mark Dominik wired from Flo

rente. "I'd like to sink my teeth
into him one more time."
"I'm hotter than Mikey," mut
tered a disgruntled (read: plas
tered) John Huetter, while shov
ing his rack in Graham's direction.
"Oooooh, I'm Mikey Lee. I'm
Asian, and I get white girls."
Some staff members celebrated
the coming of the long-awaited
Knize tenure by reflecting on the
Boucher regime.
"He castrated the mother
f#s%ing sex issue!" shrieked
News Editor Anthony Ha, who
once presided over The Daily's In
termission section.
Knize has been extensively re
searching the intricacies of the col
lege newspaper trade to avoid
such intra-staff squabbles in the fu
ture. She is writing an honors the
sis called "The Daily" and pursu
ing an individually designed
major: "The Daily."
"Megan's going to kick major
ass as EIC," said outgoing Editor
in Chief Sameer Ahmed. "She re
ally kicks ass."
