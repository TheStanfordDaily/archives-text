## Reaction to warheads cautious 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Bush administration responded
cautiously yesterday to the discov
ery of chemical warheads in Iraq.
But it insisted that Saddam Hus
sein is in violation of U.N. resolu
tions irrespective of whether the
warheads turn out to be the
"smoking gun" that has eluded
U.N. inspectors thus far.
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said the administration
was assessing the discovery and
would be deliberate about reacting
to it. Another spokesman, Scott
McClellan, said, "We look forward
to receiving information from the
inspectors."
The disclosure could change
the dynamic of the debate over
Iraq at the United Nations if the
discovery represents clear evi
dence of an Iraqi violation.
Such a conclusion could
strengthen the administration's
stand as it seeks support from
countries inflexibly opposed to
military action against Iraq, an ad

ministration official said.
The administration has insisted
for weeks that Iraq conduct has
been unlawful.
State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said the inspec
tors themselves have indicated that
Irac| has failed in a number of
areas to cooperate fully with IJ.N.
Security Council requirements.
"There's no point in continuing
forever, going on, if Iraq is not co
operating," Boucher said.
The comments came against a
background of strong sentiment in
Europe that a military attack
against Iraq should not take place
without the specific endorsement
of the Security Council.
The administration believes
that a U.N. blessing is not neces
sary and is prepared to take action
without it, in concert with like
minded countries.
The Pentagon, meanwhile, con
tinued its war preparations, saying
it might dispatch three more air
craft carriers to the region.

fty stationing carriers in the
Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean Sea, Navy fight
er-bombers would be in position
to attack from three directions,
complicating Iraq's effort to de
fend its airspace.
European Union foreign policy
c hief Javier Solana has said he can
not see how a war against Iraq can
start without clear evidence that
Iraq pursues biological, chemical
and nuclear arms — all forbidden
by the U.N.
He has not said what his posi
tion would be if such evidence
were uncovered.
But he has said it is the general
view of EU members that a mili
tary strike against Iraq should
have the prior endorsement of the
Security Council. That also is the
view of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
A senior administration official,
said c c Hint lies t hat support that view
only encourage Saddam Hussein
not to cooperate with the inspectors.
