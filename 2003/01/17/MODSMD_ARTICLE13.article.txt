# GOP unites to defeat spending bills

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Senate Re
publicans thwarted Democratic efforts
yesterday to pump extra homeland secu
rity funds into a vast $390 billion spend
ing bill as GOP lawmakers backed Presi
dent Bush's call to restrain the price tag.
In a pair of 51-45 votes, the Senate
rejected Democratic amendments to
add first $5 billion, then $3 billion, for
state and local emergency responders
and the FBI, as well as security at air
ports, energy plants and elsewhere.
Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., was the only one
to cross party lines.
Republicans also united to block a De
mocratic bid to add another $6 billion to
a measure for school districts serving

poor communities and loans for low-in
come college students.
GOP lawmakers shielded themselves
from accusations of not making schools
a top priority, by voting to shift $5 bil
lion to education from other programs
in the bill.
The votes came amid a debate on
spending that had as a subtext whether
Democrats could target Bush at a time
when his popularity, though still high,
has begun to settle.
"He turned his back on his own coun
try when he tin ned down" extra domes
tic security spending last year, said Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who led the fight
for extra funds. "Let something happen,

and then see what the polls show, then let
the questions be asked."
Republicans said the bill already had
adequate funds for the remaining eight
months of the budget year, including
$24.7 billion for domestic security and
about $50 billion for education. They
echoed Bush's argument that with re
born deficits, a faltering economy and the
global fight against terrorism, it is time to
limit other programs.
"They don't want any budget disci
pline," said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.,
sponsor of the successful GOP education
amendment "Well, we feel there should
be budget discipline. We feel our job as
legislators is to prioritize."
