# Poll: Americans not convinced about war
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush has yet to convince Americans that
war with Iraq is justified, according to a
poll that suggests the White House has
much work to do to win public support
for military force.
"I think a little more diplomacy would
be in order," said Creig Crippen, an 84-
year-old retired Air Force veteran from
Deland, Fla.
There is widespread support for re
moving Iraqi President Saddam Hus
sein, but that support is conditional on
proof of a threat from Iraq and on the
support of allies, said the poll by [lie
Pew Research Center for the People &
the Press. The poll was released yester
day as the United Nations said it had
discovered empty chemical warheads
south of Baghdad.
Two-thirds or more in the Pew poll
and other recent polls say they favor mil
itary action against Iraq — but only
under certain circumstances.
For example, the Pew poll suggested
that support for war is strong, 76 percent,

if United Nations inspectors find nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons. The sup
port is evenly split if they find no weapons
but determine Iraq has the ability to
make these weapons.
The public does not buy the adminis
tration's argument that Iraq must prove
it does not have these weapons. Almost
two-thirds, 63 percent, believed that
Iraq's failure to show such proof would
be insufficient reason fora war.
More than half, 53 percent, say the
president has not yet explained clearly
what's at stake to justify the United States
using military force to end Saddam's
rule, according to the poll. Some 42 per
cent say he has.
The number who say Bush has clearly
explained what's at stake has eroded
since his September address to the Unit
ed Nations, when it was 52-37 saying he
had given a clear explanation.
At the White House, spokesman
Scott McClellan said Bush continues to
work with other countries on a peaceful
solution.
