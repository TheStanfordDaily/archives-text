## The
						Stanford Daily ROTC does not live up to University's standards 
### 
Published Since 1891

Earlier this year, the Stanford College
Republicans announced a campaign to
bring the Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) back to the Stanford
campus. Student efforts to organize around
causes that they care about should always be ap
plauded, as they force the Stanford community
to re-evaluate its dedication to its core values.
Unfortunately, the ROTC in its current form
does not live up to Stanford's respect for diver
sity or its current academic standards, and the
University should not permit these programs to
return to campus until it does.
As with all other transfer credits, individual
departments review whether ROTC courses fit
into a degree program at Stanford. Currently,
only the Department of Engineering offers
course credit to any of the ROTC programs. The
29 Stanford students involved in the ROTC pro
gram must travel to other Bay Area universities
to take their required classes. But despite the in-

convenience to these students, there are impor
tant reasons that the ROTC in its current form
should not be allowed on campus.
Stanford set up its Office of Diversity and Ac
cess to ensure that the University remains a re
spectful and diverse campus. Each year, the
University president reiterates the dedication to
its core mission and principles, which include
that employees and prospective employees face
no discrimination on the basis of their sexual
orientation.
ROTC, instructors, as armed forces employ
ees, are subject to Department of Defense guide
lines that clearly do not meet Stanford's dedica
tion to respect and promote diversity on cam
pus. The Defense Department deals with sexu
al orientation issues through a "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell, Don't Harass, Don't Pursue" policy, which
amounts to Supreme Court-sanctioned dis
crimination of gay, lesbian and bisexual men
and women in the military.

According to a report of the Service Members
Legal Defense Network, 1,250 gay, lesbian and
bisexual servicemen and women were dis
charged from the armed forces in 2002 as a result
of this discriminatory policy. IfROTC instructors
are to offer courses through Stanford, even if
they are not technically Stanford employees, they
must be held to the same standards of respect for
diversity, and their selection must adhere to the
University's policies against discrimination.
The Defense Department's current policy
clearly discriminates on the basis of sexual ori
entation and is therefore incompatible with
Stanford's commitment to diversity. The Uni
versity must not modify or try to reinterpret its
own policy of nondiscrimination as an attempt
to accommodate the ROTC, because Stanford's
policies on discrimination reflect the values of
the University.
There is another reason that the ROTC should
not return to campus: Stanford is primarily are-

search institution, and in order to maintain this
value, it is important to maintain the highest aca
demic standards for its degrees. Stanford does not
offer or accept transfer credit from most voca
tional training courses for undergraduates in ad
herence to its core academic values. The ROTC is
one such training program, and therefore, those
courses within the program that amount to pre
professional training should not receive Universi
ty credit. Many of Stanford's peer institutions, in
cluding most of the Ivy League, don't have the
ROTC on campus for similar reasons.
If the College Republicans would really like
to see the ROTC on campus one day, they
should start by lobbying the Bush administra
tion to change the military's policy on sexual
orientation and end discrimination. Once this
change is made, they can begin discussions with
the faculty and administration as to whether
enough of the courses offered by the ROTC
meet Stanford's academic standards.
