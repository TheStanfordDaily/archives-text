# THE
						WAY I SEE IT
## What white people think 
### 
So last week I'm in one of my cours
es in the Psychology Department's
Mind, Culture and Society track,
and we're talking about racial iden
tity and how we define ourselves — basi
cally what box(es) we choose to check,
what terms we will and will not allow our
selves to be identified under and so on.
* Many groups are represented in the
class, but most interesting of all were the
responses of the white students. This is be
cause they made me realize something: As
much as we are indoctrinated with West
ern culture, values and ideals (and we are),
I<lon't think we "non-whites" have an ac
curate concept of how white people feel.
Hty this, I mean that I don't really find my
self talking with white people about their
perception of people of color, their privi-

lege in the U.S., their role
in forming and perpetu
ating the current world
and other very top
ical issues.
i The funny thing about
in the past, as I see it,
is that all of us who were
npt white were defined as
sHch and discriminated
* ...

against accordingly as a part of Western
imperialism, so it was hard to find non
white perspectives in literature, philoso
phy, drama, psychology and other
spheres, especially if you lived in the West.
* Now, of course, we have entire univer
sity departments devoted specifically to
the study of the experience of people of
celor, which is fantastic, because we have
been able to give validity to the fact that
oiir values, belief systems, social structures
afid aspirations are different — and that
tf)is difference is okay.
; In the last few years, great steps have
been taken to help people of color claim
sense of who they are, not only in
terms of what they are not — white —
but in terms of who they have always
been, and how they have influenced and
been influenced by their interactions
v/jth other races. As a result, people of
have been able to articulate more
strongly their standpoint on a multitude
of different issues, like culture, identity
and so on.
; However, we don't have many con
structive conversations that discuss the
white experience. I will even go out on a
limb and hypothesize that white people
probably don't even have these conversa
tions among themselves. In just the last
f<sw days, I have heard Caucasians dis
agree among themselves about so many
different aspects of their identity. In one
class, a white girl took offense at being re
ferred to by a white classmate as "not of
c610r." She claimed that she has a color,
wWh she described as something like "a
pteasant, rosy pink." Another interesting
debate was about whether white people
have a culture that they can claim as their
ojirn One girl was saying that she felt that

when people who are not white check a
box, they get to claim a culture, whereas
she lost that by checking white. Another
disagreed by saying that white culture is
everything that is not "ethnic," that it is the
mainstream, the dominant order under
which we all live but under which she, as a
Caucasian, is privileged.
I love this, because my own thinking
has evolved in recent times as my experi
ences have taken their course. I feel like I
have crossed the full spectrum from
"whites are the evil devil" to "maybe some
of them are nice" to "they're really just
people caught up in history and politics,
just like everybody else." And I'm actually
very happy with that analysis, because it al
lows me to assess white people as individ
uals. Now, don't take offense at the fact

that I was not always willing or able to do
this. Instead, realize that there is a legacy
of dominance, oppression, discrimination
and injustice that makes it very difficult for
those of us from different races to relate —
especially since people have suffered and
been brutalized just on the basis of race,
and that continues to this day.
We at Stanford find ourselves in a very
privileged position, in that just about all
of us know that we are talented, brilliant
and special in our own ways. The whole
"you must be better or worse than me on
the basis of your skin color" complex that
exists in the real world is probably more
than slightly diluted here, so we have a
greater chance of being able to relate on
equal terms. This is what integration is
really supposed to be about. I have
learned through personal experiences
and by looking at historical events like
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission that there is a lot to gain
from the process of talking through dif
ferences and ideas. However, this must
be done constructively and respectfully,
without malicious intent, which I think
we are mature and secure enough to ac
complish. Basically, I want to know how
white people feel, and I want them to
know how I feel as well, and I don't think
we need to be scared of that process any
more. So can we talk?
