'Proud liberal' alum appreciates
diversity Hoover brings to campus
Hard as I try, I can't think of any way to
sugar-coat the ignorance of the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice's op-ed
("Is the Hoover Institution compatible
with Stanford's goals?" Jan. 16).
Believe me, as a proud liberal, I can
empathize with much of the criticism lev
eled by the more thoughtful members of
our student body against the Hoover In
stitution's ideology. I share an order of
magnitude more in common with SCPJ's
politics than with Hoover's. But to ques
tion the institution's very existence and
relationship with Stanford? Please. Exil
ing Hoover would be an atrocious
wound to Stanford's mission of fostering
intellectual vigor. Let's ignore for now
that Hoover's archive is arguably the
world's preeminent library on war and
peace in the 20th century. Let's even for
get fora moment the ideas, prestige and
influence of the scholars that the Hoover
Institution literally brings to our front
lawn. Expel Hoover, and what piddling
ideological diversity that now exists
amongst the student body and faculty
would wither away with it. Stanford
would suddenly resemble Berkeley, an
environment so homogeneous in left
leaning thought as to stifle academic dis
cussion, promote apathy, dull the quali
ty of education and ultimately do more
harm than good to the very liberalism
that some students would sacrifice Stan
ford's principles to protect.
Few words elicit a more passionate re
sponse from Stanford students than "di
versity." This characteristic is to their cred
it. Diversity after all is a most laudable goal.
Maybe the problem is that in a national po
litical culture dominated by cheap pundit
ry and name-calling, it is easier to become

entrenched in a reflexive war of ideological
insults than to offer an olive branch, hop
ing fora peaceful, productive and mutual
disagreement. Whatever the case, if you
ever want to put your principle where your
mouth is and shout diversity's praises from
on high, I know just the tower to do it from.

Stanford's 'liberal leanings' shouldn't
deprive University of important resources
Today's Campus Viewpoint column on
the future of the Hoover Institution is a
flawed piece of thinking. The small num
ber of Hoover fellows that teach on cam
pus are hardly threatening to stifle the
open ideological climate on campus.
Granted, many Hoover fellows hold con
servative political views. This, however, is
no reason to sever the institution's con
nection with Stanford. In fact, the real
complaint behind the column is likely not
the fact that Hoover is politically biased
but that it is conservatively biased. If a left
wing think tank with the prominence of
the Hoover Institution were associated
with Stanford, the campus community
would probably not raise such a fuss.
Many people associated with Stanford
take pride in the fact that the political en
vironment on campus is decidedly liberal,
even more so than at many other colleges.
That's fine, but Stanford's liberal leanings
should not go so far as to deprive the Uni
versity of valuable resources like the
Hoover Institution. Aside from lending
prestige to Stanford, the Hoover Archives
are an invaluable source for students and
researchers. If the institution were to be
come disaffiliated from Stanford, the en
tire Stanford community would lose out.
In the 1980s, when the Reagan Presi

dential Library team was looking fora spot
to build Reagan's library, Stanford was the
preferred choice. So why don't we have
the Reagan Library? Because people on
campus were afraid that the presence of a
Republican president's library on campus
would poison the atmosphere with con
servatism. The result: Reagan went else
where, and Stanford is short one amazing
ly valuable research and academic tool. It's
exactly this type of thinking that has to be
avoided. There's nothing wrong with hav
ing a liberal campus, but liberal attitudes
should not prevent Stanford from getting
and retaining necessary organizations like
the Hoover Institution.

'Students should be grateful' for Hoover
It is difficult to understand why the
Stanford Community for Peace and Jus
tice would criticize one of the finest assets
the University has to offer its students.
Ihe Hoover Institution brings the na
tion's premier faculty and scholars to cam
pus, offering students an unparalleled op
portunity to learn from the best.
While it is true that Hoover is known
for its support of the principle of limited
government, this does not impugn the
benefits a student can gain from the insti
tution's presence on campus. During my
four years at Stanford, I was fortunate to
take classes taught by Hoover fellows, as
sist on a research project at the institution
and sit in on lunch seminars lectured by
the most distinguished and timely scholars
of the day. Not once did a professor's po
litical views overwhelm my ability to learn
from their great intellect. I consider my
