# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Those who seek egg donations don't deserve bad reputation 
### JENNIFER COOLIDGE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Ask an infertile couple to explain
what they have gone through to
have a baby. If they are anything
like my aunt and uncle, they won't
hesitate to enlighten you with their agoniz
ing efforts and heartbreaking disappoint
ments. I've seen firsthand the excruciating
pain in my aunt's eyes when she tells me, "I
want a baby. I want to have a family of my
own." It's easy for people to criticize egg do
nation when they have had no trouble start
ing a family. For an infertile couple, howev
er, egg donation is a blessing that deserves
appreciation more than words can say.
Egg donation normally comes at a time
when hope for pregnancy is running low.
Couples typically are running out of alterna
tives. For an infertile couple, it is usually a last
reson after a series of rigorous and tiresome
fertility options have failed to work.
Why are people so fast to attack these poor
couples who want to have a baby? Egg dona
tion has become a controversy, primarily on
the basis of the so-called "debatable" adver

tisements seeking donors. Opponents criti
cize women being compensated on (lie basis
of their genetic characteristics. Rivals see
choosing donors as a way of" designing" what
yon want and what you don't want in your
child. Ultimately, they accuse infertile cou
ples of "buying" their babies.
Well, these challengers obviously don't
know the facts behind the issue. The truth is,
most people have no due what is involved in
this intricate and exhausting procedure.
()pponents tend to classify egg-seekers as
maniacs with devious desires. Fortunately,
the people placing these ads are not random
psychos with evil plans to create the perfect
human race. In reality, most recipients of
egg donations are women who are no longer
able to produce enough eggs to fertilize into
embryos. These women may carry genetic
diseases, have damaged ovaries due to radi
ation therapy for cancer or have reached
menopause prematurely. These sad situa
tions arise, and as a result couples seek, often
times desperately, outside sources for help.
When couples put ads in local newspa
pers seeking donors with precise character
istics, they are in no way promoting an

"ideal" race. They simply want their child to
feel comfortable in their family. When an ad
asks fora tall donor with blonde hair and
blue eyes, some people read this and get of
fended. Why? For some reason, they take
this to mean tall people with blonde hair and
blue eyes are "better" people and are worth
more. It's not about racism, discrimination
or anything along those lines. Egg-seekers,
like any parent, want their child to grow up
in the least awkward situation possible.
When parents choose donors who look like
themselves with similar qualities, the future
child faces less strife later on in life. The ad
provides a way for the couple to find donors
that resemble them. They are not "engi
neering" the perfect child. Instead, they are
providing their unborn baby a more natural
and comfortable life — one in which the
child won't always see himself as "different"
from Mommy and Daddy.
Those who oppose selection insinuate
that donors should be random. Random
ness makes no sense. There must be a selec
tion process to insure the health, security
and protection for all participants involved
in the donation process.

Fuithermore, when an ad publicizes a
compensation fora donor that matches a
particular description, people automatically
assume this to be unethical. "How can you
assign a monetary value to a human life?"
they ask.
The money is not a reward for fitting a
particular profile. Instead, the money serves
as a payment for the countless hours re
quired in the dangerous and drawn-out
procedure. Serious donors are those who
are aware of the complex procedure and the
time commitment involved. Those who are
drawn only by the money are typically
turned away after they realize what is in
volved in the course of action.
Besides, the money may seem like a lot at
first, but consider this: According to recent
studies, if the donor's average payment is di
vided by the average number ofhours a donor
commits to die program, she receives around
$ 1.50 an hour. That is hardly an incentive if a
donor only cares about money. Additionally,
the procedure isn't simple in any way. For that
$ 1.50 an hour, the donor endures nearly three
weeks of hormone injections, plus blood tests
and numerous ultrasounds.

During the final half hour, the surgical re
trieval of the eggs takes plate. The patient is ei
ther sedated or under general jinesdiesia
Guided by ultrasound, the doctor inserts a long
needle into her vaginal canal, pierces the vagi
nal wall and withdraws one egg at a time from
fluid-filled follicles on her ovaries. Also, the
surgery puis the donor at risk for infertility.
And people think donors don't deserve
money after undergoing a procedure like
this?
The motives that lead a couple to place
an ad are logical if you put yourself in tiieir
shoes. Opponents present these people in
the wrong light. Instead of a couple simply
aspiring to have a family of their own, ad
versaries describe these people as promot
ers of some "ideal" race through monetary
temptations. challengers stir up a con
troversy. Human nature will not falter. It is
within each one of us to provide protection,
comfort, compassion and generosity — all
of which are the true motives behind those
seeking donors and the donors themselves.

Ask an infertile couple to explain
what they have gone through to
have a baby. If they are anything
like my aunt and uncle, they won't
hesitate to enlighten you with their agoniz
ing efforts and heartbreaking disappoint
ments. I've seen firsthand the excruciating
pain in my aunt's eyes when she tells me, "I
want a baby. I want to have a family of my
own." It's easy for people to criticize egg do
nation when they have had no trouble start
ing a family. For an infertile couple, howev
er, egg donation is a blessing that deserves
appreciation more than words can say.
Egg donation normally comes at a time
when hope for pregnancy is running low.
Couples typically are running out of alterna
tives. For an infertile couple, it is usually a last
reson after a series of rigorous and tiresome
fertility options have failed to work.
Why are people so fast to attack these poor
couples who want to have a baby? Egg dona
tion has become a controversy, primarily on
the basis of the so-called "debatable" adver

tisements seeking donors. Opponents criti
cize women being compensated on (lie basis
of their genetic characteristics. Rivals see
choosing donors as a way of" designing" what
yon want and what you don't want in your
child. Ultimately, they accuse infertile cou
ples of "buying" their babies.
Well, these challengers obviously don't
know the facts behind the issue. The truth is,
most people have no due what is involved in
this intricate and exhausting procedure.
()pponents tend to classify egg-seekers as
maniacs with devious desires. Fortunately,
the people placing these ads are not random
psychos with evil plans to create the perfect
human race. In reality, most recipients of
egg donations are women who are no longer
able to produce enough eggs to fertilize into
embryos. These women may carry genetic
diseases, have damaged ovaries due to radi
ation therapy for cancer or have reached
menopause prematurely. These sad situa
tions arise, and as a result couples seek, often
times desperately, outside sources for help.
When couples put ads in local newspa
pers seeking donors with precise character
istics, they are in no way promoting an

"ideal" race. They simply want their child to
feel comfortable in their family. When an ad
asks fora tall donor with blonde hair and
blue eyes, some people read this and get of
fended. Why? For some reason, they take
this to mean tall people with blonde hair and
blue eyes are "better" people and are worth
more. It's not about racism, discrimination
or anything along those lines. Egg-seekers,
like any parent, want their child to grow up
in the least awkward situation possible.
When parents choose donors who look like
themselves with similar qualities, the future
child faces less strife later on in life. The ad
provides a way for the couple to find donors
that resemble them. They are not "engi
neering" the perfect child. Instead, they are
providing their unborn baby a more natural
and comfortable life — one in which the
child won't always see himself as "different"
from Mommy and Daddy.
Those who oppose selection insinuate
that donors should be random. Random
ness makes no sense. There must be a selec
tion process to insure the health, security
and protection for all participants involved
in the donation process.

Fuithermore, when an ad publicizes a
compensation fora donor that matches a
particular description, people automatically
assume this to be unethical. "How can you
assign a monetary value to a human life?"
they ask.
The money is not a reward for fitting a
particular profile. Instead, the money serves
as a payment for the countless hours re
quired in the dangerous and drawn-out
procedure. Serious donors are those who
are aware of the complex procedure and the
time commitment involved. Those who are
drawn only by the money are typically
turned away after they realize what is in
volved in the course of action.
Besides, the money may seem like a lot at
first, but consider this: According to recent
studies, if the donor's average payment is di
vided by the average number ofhours a donor
commits to die program, she receives around
$ 1.50 an hour. That is hardly an incentive if a
donor only cares about money. Additionally,
the procedure isn't simple in any way. For that
$ 1.50 an hour, the donor endures nearly three
weeks of hormone injections, plus blood tests
and numerous ultrasounds.

During the final half hour, the surgical re
trieval of the eggs takes plate. The patient is ei
ther sedated or under general jinesdiesia
