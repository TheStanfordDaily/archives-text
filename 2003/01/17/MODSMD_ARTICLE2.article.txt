# Students, I-Center staff wade through INS red tape

### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
With the heightened border security
measures implemented in recent months
due to fears arising from the Sept. 11 at
tacks, Stanford international students
and faculty have had difficulty complet
ing the new procedures required to re
ceive and maintain legal residency. Amid
controversial Immigration and Natural
ization Services detainments and requests
for background information on foreign
students, a number of Stanford commu
nity members have stepped forth to ques
tion the government's tactics.
According to John Pearson, director of
the Bechtel International Center, the com
plicated INS procedures that many foreign
students must go through have significant
ly changed in shape and form. The process
has become particularly burdensome for
those filing for special registration, a re
quirement for foreigners from nations
deemed suspect by the U.S. government.
"The final federal regulations [for spe
cial registration] were not issued until De
cember," Pearson said. "And some of them
are still very unclear."
Rolando Villalobos, foreign student ad
viser at the I-Center, concurred with Pear
son that "a lot of this stuff is new."
Some students have had more difficulty
than others completing their registration
with the INS.
Imran Moinuddin, a junior interna
tional student from Pakistan, said he re
cently spent over six hours at the INS of
fice in San Jose when he filed for special
registration, in addition to a number of
hours at an airport in Atlanta when he ini
tially entered the country in September to
come to Stanford.
"I really thought about what the sense
was in holding these interviews," Moinud
din said. "I understand they are trying to
isolate people who are in violation of their
visas and using this as a means to restrict
terrorist activities, but I don't think char

acters of that sort would ever step forth
and stand in long lines to submit them
selves in that fashion."
"When you have these procedures dis
turbing the main purpose of our being
here, [to be educated], it really pains me,"
he continued. "And I have this constant
feeling that the minute I finish my educa
tion, I will have the INS breathing down
on my neck to leave."
Ahmad Dallal, an associate professor of
history, said that he disagrees with the way
that the government is currently handling
the situation.
"It is creating an atmosphere of fear
and suspicion â€” it divides society," Dallal
said. "Academia is having a problem as
well: There are many people who are in
vited to come lecture and participate who
now have to be cleared. It is very long, and
quite often these people end up not com
ing, and there are students who don't get
the clearance for visas even though they
are admitted for universities."
In a letter to Attorney General John
Ashcroft, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo
expressed discontent with how the INS
detained a number of individuals during
the first round of special registration in
December.
"Muslim-Americans in my congres
sional district have brothers, sons and hus
bands who have been detained by the
INS, and they are being detained without
explanation for more than 72 hours,"
Eshoo wrote. "I urge you to immediately
halt these practices of the INS and engage
in a fair process to individuals."
ASSU President and senior Monica Hen
estroza explained that the ASSU, while not
taking an official position on the matter, of
fers resources such as free legal advice to stu
dents through its Legal Counseling Office.
Graduate student Dara Ghahremani, a
member of the Persian Student Associa
tion, said that he has been working with
several others to alleviate the problems
