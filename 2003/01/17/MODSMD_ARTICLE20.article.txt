In their guest column, "Is the Hoover
Institution compatible with Stanford's
goals?" on page 5 of yesterday's Daily,

the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice submitted a version of the op-ed
that was not the final edit. The last two
sentences of the second paragraph
should have read: "The fellows on the
Defense Policy Board — Newt Gingrich,
Martin Anderson, George Schultz and
Pete Wilson among them — have all
been deeply involved in conservative
politics. While there is nothing wrong
with a Hoover fellow, or any scholar, ad
vising government officials — indeed,
we wish to distinguish between the insti
tution and the projects of its individual
fellows — we raise the issue of Hoover
fellows' involvement in U.S. foreign pol
icy because we feel it reflects the nature
of the institution."
In the sports section of yesterday's Daily,
the women's diving and women's basket
ball photos should have been credited to
Dave Gonzales, courtesy of the
Department.
