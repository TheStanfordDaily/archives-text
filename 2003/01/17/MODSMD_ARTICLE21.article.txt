## Card rallies, beats Wazzou in overtime 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
PULLMAN, Wash. — From the
onset, you could tell that the Stan
ford men's basketball team's game
against Washington State was
going to be a psychological test for
Stanford.

Last Night: Stanford 73, Washington
St. 68 JOT)
The Cardinal, which lias strug
gled this season against less presti
gious opponents, once again
stepped onto the court mentally un
prepared to play and was over
whelmed early by an injury-riddled
Cougars squad.
Stanford (12-4, 3-1 Pacific-10
Conference), playing without ju
nior forward Justin Davis for the
third straight game, narrowly es
caped Pullman with a 73-68
overtime victory over the
Cougars (5-9, 0-5).
But the game was basically a re
hashing of last week's Oregon
State fiasco — when the Cardinal
barely escaped with a three-point
win over the lowly Beavers at
home — souring the victory with
lingering questions of Stanford's
overall strength.
"Well, once again we were very
fortunate," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. " Phis is
the second time in the last three

games that we came out flat."
The Cougars opened the game
on a 14-2 run, bringing a sparse,
nowhere-near-capacity Friel Court
crowd 0f2,395 to its feet.
Senior guard Julius Barnes and
freshman reserve Jason Haas both
drew a tough defensive assignment
in guarding Washington State ju
nior Marcus Moore.
Moore, who grimaced in pain
because of a sore right ankle
throughout the game, is live inches
taller than Barnes and outweighs
the Cardinal senior by almost 30
pounds.
Moore provided the Cougars
initial offensive spark. He
opened the game with a deep 3-
point shot and then followed up
with a 15-foot jump shot to push
Washington State ahead. His
ability to penetrate and score
early opened up wide open looks
from beyond the 3-point arch for
his teammates.
However, Moore couldn't
carry that offensive fire into the
second half. 1 le didn't score a sin
gle point in the final 20:00and fin
ished the game with seven points.
Washington State finished 7-
for-13 from behind the arc in the
first half and shot 46 percent from
the field, going into the locker
room ahead 40-26.
Stanford, on the other hand,
shot a meager 27 percent from 3-
