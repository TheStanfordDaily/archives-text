## Card rallies, beats Wazzou in overtime 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
PULLMAN, Wash. — From the
onset, you could tell that the Stan
ford men's basketball team's game
against Washington State was
going to be a psychological test for
Stanford.
Men's Basketball
Last Night: Stanford 73, Washington
St. 68 JOT)
The Cardinal, which lias strug
gled this season against less presti
gious opponents, once again
stepped onto the court mentally un
prepared to play and was over
whelmed early by an injury-riddled
Cougars squad.
Stanford (12-4, 3-1 Pacific-10
Conference), playing without ju
nior forward Justin Davis for the
third straight game, narrowly es
caped Pullman with a 73-68
overtime victory over the
Cougars (5-9, 0-5).
But the game was basically a re
hashing of last week's Oregon
State fiasco — when the Cardinal
barely escaped with a three-point
win over the lowly Beavers at
home — souring the victory with
lingering questions of Stanford's
overall strength.
"Well, once again we were very
fortunate," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. " Phis is
the second time in the last three

games that we came out flat."
The Cougars opened the game
on a 14-2 run, bringing a sparse,
nowhere-near-capacity Friel Court
crowd 0f2,395 to its feet.
Senior guard Julius Barnes and
freshman reserve Jason Haas both
drew a tough defensive assignment
in guarding Washington State ju
nior Marcus Moore.
Moore, who grimaced in pain
because of a sore right ankle
throughout the game, is live inches
taller than Barnes and outweighs
the Cardinal senior by almost 30
pounds.
Moore provided the Cougars
initial offensive spark. He
opened the game with a deep 3-
point shot and then followed up
with a 15-foot jump shot to push
Washington State ahead. His
ability to penetrate and score
early opened up wide open looks
from beyond the 3-point arch for
his teammates.
However, Moore couldn't
carry that offensive fire into the
second half. 1 le didn't score a sin
gle point in the final 20:00and fin
ished the game with seven points.
Washington State finished 7-
for-13 from behind the arc in the
first half and shot 46 percent from
the field, going into the locker
room ahead 40-26.
Stanford, on the other hand,
shot a meager 27 percent from 3-

point land and went 36 percent
from the field in the first 20 min
utes of play. The 14-point deficit at
the half was Stanford's largest of
the season.
I tithe first half, the Cougars
did what other teams have failed
to do this season: rattle Stanford
offensively with full-court pres
sure and* aggressive man-to
rnan defense. With near-con
stant double teams, Washington
State caused 10 first-half
turnovers by Stanford.
"We talked about it at halftime,"
Montgomery said. "We changed
defenses, and (the zone] seemed to
slow them down a bit. We got a little
momentum and at least gave our
selves the chance to win."
The second half saw a much
more defensively aggressive Stan
lord team.
Once again, the Cardinal's
amoeba-like 1-3 zone caused con
fusion for its opponent, effectively

taking Moore out of the game —
and many times leading him to
costly turnovers.
Barnes opened the hall by strip
ping Moore in the open court,
which led to an easy layup. Stanford
continued on a 26-7 run to overtake
the Cougars.
Washington State wouldn't go
away easily though.
The Cougars answered Stan
ford's offensive outburst with a 5-
0 run to tie the game again at 52-
52, and then proceeded to retake
the lead.
With Stanford down by four with
1:25 left to play, Barnes finally re
gained his offensive stroke and hit
an ofl-the-dribble 12-footer to bring
the Cardinal within two.
After a Washington State time
out, Stanford forced Moore to miss
a desperation shot to beat the shot
clock, and Barnes quickly answered
with a long 3-pointer to put the Car
dinal up by one with 23.8 seconds
left to play.
Back on the defensive end,
Barnes fouled sophomore shoot
ing guard Chris Schlatter with 3.1
left on the clock. Schlatter, who

provided the Cougars with a
strong shooting up until that point
(17 points, off of 6-for-l 1 shooting
from the field), clanked the first
free throw but made the second,
sending the game into overtime.
Stanford opened the five-minute
overtime on a 6-1 run to put a feisty
Washington State squad away.
"That's a hard one to lose,"
Moore said. "It's a pretty tough
one to swallow, especially con
sidering how much we were win
ning by. We didn't come out
with the same intensity in the
second half."
Despite an all-around slow offen
sive beginning, all five of Stanford's
starters finished in double figures.
Sophomore Rob Little provid
ed a strong offensive presence in
side. The Stanford center fin
ished with 14 points, six re
bounds and went 6-for-8 from
the charity stripe.
And junior guard Matt Lottich
was his "new" usual self, leading
the team in scoring with 17 points
off of 4-for-7 shooting from behind
the arc.
"You gotta be able to play every

night, and I don't think the kids un
derstand that," Montgomery said.
"We're going to have to learn. We're
going to have to play better."
The Cardinal will face off against
Washington tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
The game will be televised on Fox
Sports Net.
