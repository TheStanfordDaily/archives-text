# A 						TALE OF TWO TEAMS
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Make it 38. That's how many games
Washington State has dropped in row.
On the plus side, that's still 20 away
from the NCAA record for consecutive
losses.
Across the country, the Connecticut
women are making a different kind of
history. With a win this Saturday against
Georgetown, the Huskies would record
their 55th straight victory and set a new
NCAA record. UConn ran the table last
year with a perfect 39-0 record en route
to the program's third NCAA champi
onship and has won its first 14 games of
this season — despite losing All Ameri
cans Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones

and Tamika Williams, seniors who went
1-2-4-6 in the WNBA draft.
Despite lots of talk about increasing
parity in women's basketball recently,
these two opposing streaks demonstrate
the remaining discrepancy in talent be
tween the top and bottom programs.
And the sad truth is that you need tal
ent to win basketball games.
If Washington's recent upset of then
No. 18 Arizona and Oregon's one-point
loss to Stanford demonstrates growing
equality in the Pacific-10 Conference,
Washington State has not benefited
from this trend. It is impossible to suc
ceed in a conference when you score the
least points offensively and give up the
most points defensively.
Still one would think that random

chance, home-court advantage and a lit
tle luck would align to allow a team with
even marginal talent to win at least one
game in 38 tries. Sadly though, due to in
jury and lack of talent, the Cougars have
only had a legitimate chance to win two
of these games, both recent losses to
Washington and Arizona State.
Against Washington, the Cougars
climbed back from a 19-point deficit to
pull within two points with 2:05 left in
the game, only to lose 77-69.
Against the Sun Devils, the Cougars
never trailed in the first half and led by
as many as 10 points until Arizona State
went on a 16-5 run. Still, Washington
State pulled within two points with
1:50 remaining before eventually
falling 57-53.
When a team hasn't won all sea
son, the coach has to look hard fora
silver lining.
"I told the kids to feel the pain of the
loss but feel the glory that got you there
— to be able to possibly win it," Cougars
head coach Sherri Murrell told re
porters after the Washington game. "I
was real proud of them. They were play
ing the type of defense that I've always
wanted them to play."
Granted injuries haven't helped
Washington State's talent situation. In
all, the Cougars are missing five players,
including two of their top three scorers.
The return of second-leading scorer
Candace Fields in two to five weeks will
provide a boast, but three others will be
out for the season.
"I am telling everyone that we are
getting better," Murrell said. "It's un
fortunate that once they have started to
grasp the system, we have been hit with
injuries. On top of that we are in the
Pac-10."
Some might wonder why the strug
gling Cougars didn't schedule some re
ally bad nonconference teams in an ef
fort to end the drought.
The fact is that there aren't too many
Division I teams in the country that the
WSU would be certain of beating. The
Cougars rank 198 th in the RFI ratings
— even taking their high strength of
schedule into account.
No. 6 Stanford is certainly not the
team you want to play when trying to
break a losing streak — Washington
State has never beaten the Cardinal in
34 tries.
Make that 35 after Stanford's 85-56
victory last night at Maples Pavilion.
Against a bigger, faster, stronger and
more skilled Cardinal squad, the
Cougars looked more like a hesitant


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
A killer conference schedule that includes matchups with Stanford and Ail-American
Nicole Powell (14) has contributed to Washington State's haplessness. Stanford blew
out the Cougars last night, 85-56, handing them their 38th straight loss.
high school team than a Division I
college program. But it wasn't for
lack of effort.
Washington State kept its dig
nity intact by playing desperate,
overcommitting defense and ag
gressive offense. The Cougars
bench and few dedicated fans
erupted with fist pumps as often
as there was something to cheer
about on the floor.
But high-school-level talent, no
matter how inspired, doesn't cut it
against one of the best teams in
the country.
Stanford tried to help out the
Cougars with 28 turnovers, but no
matter how sloppy the Cardinal
played, it could not make the
game close. With little effort, Stan
ford was able to pick apart the
Cougars' scrambling defense with
back-door passes and aggressive
drives to the basket.
The Cardinal post players had
their way inside, converting

layups over Cougars' heads and
ripping rebounds away from
weaker opponents.
The Stanford Band's normally
humorous "left, right, left, right"
taunt in rhythm with an opposing
player's steps seemed downright
cruel given the circumstances.
Still, there is hope for the
Cougars and their young enthusi
astic coach, who enjoyed four con
secutive winning seasons at Pacific
before taking over in Pullman.
When Geno Auriemma arrived
at UConn before the 1985-86 sea
son, the Huskies shared a leaky
communal locker room with other
teams, played in the campus field
house and drew around 50 fans a
night, most ofwhom were relatives
and friends.
Now the Huskies travel by char
ter airplane and always sell out
home games at on-campus Gampel
Pavilion (10,027 capacity) and the
Hartford Civic (-enter (16,294).
UConn's public television ratings
spike as high as 17 points with
10,000 household for every point.
The best in times in Pullman
could just soon be on their way.
