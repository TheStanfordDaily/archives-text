It really wasn't much of a shock
er, but the No. 6 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to an easy
85-56 victory over Washington
State last night at Maples Pavilion.

Last Night: No. 6 Stanford 85, Wash
ington St. 56
It wasn't a surprise because the
Cougars (0-14, 0-6 Pacific-10 Con
ference) had never beaten Stan
ford in the 20-year history of the ri
valry and hadn't won a game peri
od since Nov. 29, 2001, against
Gonzaga, a stretch of what is now
38 games.
Meanwhile, Stanford (13-1, 5-
0) saw a few more positive streaks
continue.
The Cardinal won its 26th
straight Pac-10 contest and ex
tended its home winning streak to
19 games — marking the second
longest such streak in the nation
behind Connecticut's 55.
In her fifth game since return
ing from a bulging disc injury, ju
nior All-American Nicole Powell
showed she's beginning to regain
her Ms. Triple-Double form again.
She led the way for Stanford with a
season-high 24 points and added
14 rebounds and six assists.
"I think after having another
week of practice, I felt more corn

fortable having the ball," Powell
said.
Sophomore forwards T'Nae
Thiel (11 points) and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu (10) both scored in
double figures as well.
This meeting between the Car
dinal and the Cougars was no dif
ferent than what transpired last
year, when Stanford won both
games against Washington State
by an average of 36.5 points.
The closest the Cougars have
ever come to beating the Cardinal
was on Jan. 10, 1987, when they
lost 71-67.
Since Stanford was able to turn
on cruise control about three min
utes into the game — the Cardinal
went on a 22-3 run to turn the
game into a mellow affair — none
of the starters played more than 23
minutes.
That means all three freshmen
— Krista Rappahahn, Clare Bo
densteiner and Shelley Nweke —
plus converted post player Katie
Denny got some valuable experi
ence in case either the injury / foul
bug decides to sneak up on the
Cardinal at some point this year.
Just about the only thing Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer had
to worry about after the game was
her team's inability to take care of
the basketball.
The Cardinal had a season
high 28 turnovers —17 in the first
