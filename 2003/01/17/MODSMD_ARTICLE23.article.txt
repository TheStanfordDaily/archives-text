# Women prove too tough for Cougars
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It really wasn't much of a shock
er, but the No. 6 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to an easy
85-56 victory over Washington
State last night at Maples Pavilion.
Women's Basketball
Last Night: No. 6 Stanford 85, Wash
ington St. 56
It wasn't a surprise because the
Cougars (0-14, 0-6 Pacific-10 Con
ference) had never beaten Stan
ford in the 20-year history of the ri
valry and hadn't won a game peri
od since Nov. 29, 2001, against
Gonzaga, a stretch of what is now
38 games.
Meanwhile, Stanford (13-1, 5-
0) saw a few more positive streaks
continue.
The Cardinal won its 26th
straight Pac-10 contest and ex
tended its home winning streak to
19 games — marking the second
longest such streak in the nation
behind Connecticut's 55.
In her fifth game since return
ing from a bulging disc injury, ju
nior All-American Nicole Powell
showed she's beginning to regain
her Ms. Triple-Double form again.
She led the way for Stanford with a
season-high 24 points and added
14 rebounds and six assists.
"I think after having another
week of practice, I felt more corn

fortable having the ball," Powell
said.
Sophomore forwards T'Nae
Thiel (11 points) and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu (10) both scored in
double figures as well.
This meeting between the Car
dinal and the Cougars was no dif
ferent than what transpired last
year, when Stanford won both
games against Washington State
by an average of 36.5 points.
The closest the Cougars have
ever come to beating the Cardinal
was on Jan. 10, 1987, when they
lost 71-67.
Since Stanford was able to turn
on cruise control about three min
utes into the game — the Cardinal
went on a 22-3 run to turn the
game into a mellow affair — none
of the starters played more than 23
minutes.
That means all three freshmen
— Krista Rappahahn, Clare Bo
densteiner and Shelley Nweke —
plus converted post player Katie
Denny got some valuable experi
ence in case either the injury / foul
bug decides to sneak up on the
Cardinal at some point this year.
Just about the only thing Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer had
to worry about after the game was
her team's inability to take care of
the basketball.
The Cardinal had a season
high 28 turnovers —17 in the first
half alone — suggesting Stanford
possibly sunk down to its oppo
nent's poor level of play.
- "A lot of the turnovers had to
with people who hadn't got
ten a lot of game time being anx
ious to play and force things,"
vanDerveer said. "Things can
get contagious.
"It's been a focal point for us. But
our team focuses well on things."
The lone bright spot for Wash
ington State was the play of 5-
foot-6 sophomore guard Jessica
Perry, who notched a career-high
25 points and showcased her
quickness with five steals. (Maybe
Perry picked up a few pointers
playing against Powell in high
school. The two played against
each other in Phoenix prep
leagues.)
' The Cougars had a difficult
time with their shot selection
against a much taller Stanford
frontline. Washington State's lead
ing scorer coming into the game,
Biana McCall, was essentially ren
dered ineffective.
"It was tough to get a shot off,"
Cougars coach Sherri Murrell
said. "We tried to concentrate on
moving the ball around and at
tacking."
This kind of frustration is new
(<Jr Murrell, who led Pacific to four
consecutive winning seasons be
fore taking the head gig in Pull
man.
Washington State's rough sea
son can be attributed in part to a
plague of injuries.
The Cougars lost three play
ers to season-ending injuries: se
nior Jessica Ottmar (right knee),
junior Kim Dugan (scaphoid

fracture of her left wrist) and
freshman Lindsay Bogachus
(lower back disc). Plus, Washing
ton State's biggest post threat, ju
nior center Candace Fields, is out
two to five weeks with a stress

fracture in her left foot.
"It makes a big difference,"
Powell said of the injuries.
If nothing else, Murrell has
tried to make her team battle-test
ed, which is more than some

other Pac-10 teams tan say for
themselves.
Washington State has played
several tournament-quality teams,
including No. 3 Louisiana State
and No. 18 Arizona, so it boasts the
second-best strength of schedule
in the country right now.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford
will get a severe test against ar
guably the second-best team in the
conference in Washington (13-2,
5-1), which beat California 76-59
last night in Berkeley after strug
gling in the first half.
fhe key for the Cardinal will
be stilling the Huskies' potent
perimeter shooters — a group
that has combined to knock
down the most treys in the Pac
-10 this season.
"They're kind of like us —
they are all good perimeter
shooters," Kimyacioglu said. "I
think it's going to be a really
good matchup."

Kelley Suminski distributes the ball in Stanford's win over Washington State
last night. Suminski scored nine points in 22 minutes, as the Cardinal emp
tied its bench in the second half of its 85-56 blowout victory.
It really wasn't much of a shock
er, but the No. 6 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to an easy
85-56 victory over Washington
State last night at Maples Pavilion.
Women's Basketball
Last Night: No. 6 Stanford 85, Wash
ington St. 56
It wasn't a surprise because the
Cougars (0-14, 0-6 Pacific-10 Con
ference) had never beaten Stan
ford in the 20-year history of the ri
valry and hadn't won a game peri
od since Nov. 29, 2001, against
Gonzaga, a stretch of what is now
38 games.
Meanwhile, Stanford (13-1, 5-
0) saw a few more positive streaks
continue.
The Cardinal won its 26th
straight Pac-10 contest and ex
tended its home winning streak to
19 games — marking the second
longest such streak in the nation
behind Connecticut's 55.
In her fifth game since return
ing from a bulging disc injury, ju
nior All-American Nicole Powell
showed she's beginning to regain
her Ms. Triple-Double form again.
She led the way for Stanford with a
season-high 24 points and added
14 rebounds and six assists.
"I think after having another
week of practice, I felt more corn

fortable having the ball," Powell
said.
Sophomore forwards T'Nae
Thiel (11 points) and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu (10) both scored in
double figures as well.
This meeting between the Car
dinal and the Cougars was no dif
ferent than what transpired last
year, when Stanford won both
games against Washington State
by an average of 36.5 points.
The closest the Cougars have
ever come to beating the Cardinal
was on Jan. 10, 1987, when they
lost 71-67.
Since Stanford was able to turn
on cruise control about three min
utes into the game — the Cardinal
went on a 22-3 run to turn the
game into a mellow affair — none
of the starters played more than 23
minutes.
That means all three freshmen
— Krista Rappahahn, Clare Bo
densteiner and Shelley Nweke —
plus converted post player Katie
Denny got some valuable experi
ence in case either the injury / foul
bug decides to sneak up on the
Cardinal at some point this year.
Just about the only thing Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer had
to worry about after the game was
her team's inability to take care of
the basketball.
The Cardinal had a season
high 28 turnovers —17 in the first
half alone — suggesting Stanford
possibly sunk down to its oppo
nent's poor level of play.
- "A lot of the turnovers had to
with people who hadn't got
ten a lot of game time being anx
ious to play and force things,"
vanDerveer said. "Things can
get contagious.
"It's been a focal point for us. But
our team focuses well on things."
The lone bright spot for Wash
ington State was the play of 5-
foot-6 sophomore guard Jessica
Perry, who notched a career-high
25 points and showcased her
quickness with five steals. (Maybe
Perry picked up a few pointers
playing against Powell in high
school. The two played against
each other in Phoenix prep
leagues.)
' The Cougars had a difficult
time with their shot selection
against a much taller Stanford
frontline. Washington State's lead
ing scorer coming into the game,
Biana McCall, was essentially ren
dered ineffective.
"It was tough to get a shot off,"
Cougars coach Sherri Murrell
said. "We tried to concentrate on
moving the ball around and at
tacking."
This kind of frustration is new
(<Jr Murrell, who led Pacific to four
consecutive winning seasons be
fore taking the head gig in Pull
man.
Washington State's rough sea
son can be attributed in part to a
plague of injuries.
The Cougars lost three play
ers to season-ending injuries: se
nior Jessica Ottmar (right knee),
junior Kim Dugan (scaphoid

fracture of her left wrist) and
freshman Lindsay Bogachus
(lower back disc). Plus, Washing
ton State's biggest post threat, ju
nior center Candace Fields, is out
two to five weeks with a stress

fracture in her left foot.
"It makes a big difference,"
Powell said of the injuries.
If nothing else, Murrell has
tried to make her team battle-test
ed, which is more than some

other Pac-10 teams tan say for
themselves.
Washington State has played
several tournament-quality teams,
including No. 3 Louisiana State
and No. 18 Arizona, so it boasts the
second-best strength of schedule
in the country right now.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford
will get a severe test against ar
guably the second-best team in the
conference in Washington (13-2,
5-1), which beat California 76-59
last night in Berkeley after strug
gling in the first half.
fhe key for the Cardinal will
be stilling the Huskies' potent
perimeter shooters — a group
that has combined to knock
down the most treys in the Pac
-10 this season.
"They're kind of like us —
they are all good perimeter
shooters," Kimyacioglu said. "I
think it's going to be a really
good matchup."
