# Gymnastics solid all around

### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN STAFF WRITER 
Ask a Cardinal athlete what his or her fa
vorite thing about Stanford athletics is and
one will likely hear the following: The chance
to receive a great education and be a part of
an exciting community while competing lor
a nationally renowned athletic program.
Few teams take as much advantage of
what Stanford has to offer off the field as
the No. 7 Cardinal women's gymnastics
team (3-0).
"I'm continually impressed with the
team's ability to balance gymnastics, acad
emics, community outreach and their so
cial life at Stanford," head coach Kristen
Smith said.
Last year, the Cardinal roster featured
eight Academic All-Americans, with Stan
ford ranking eighth nationally according to
team CPA.

to our focus than just that," senior Alissa
Cooper said. "Our teammates from the past
few years set a really high academic standard.
"We try to follow their example and,
along with our athletic goals, we have a goal

just as committed to reaching."
Women's gymnastics also earned the

"We feel good about helping
each other reach our goals in the
gym," senior Kelsey Stillinger said.
"Working together to help others is
a different kind of bonding. It
builds a special kind of team unity."
The team wants to be perceived
by the community as more than
just stellar in competition.
"We don't want to be known
strictly for gymnastics or acade
mics or service," Smyth said. "We
want people to know these young
women are able to do it all."
With unfailing focus in both
the classroom and the gym, the
future has never looked brighter
for the Cardinal.
Coming off of last year's break
through season — highlighted by
the Cardinal's first-ever NCAA
Super Six appearance — Stanford
opened its 2003 season with a
bang, crushing No. 16 Arizona
State, No. 18 New Hampshire and
San Jose State en route to taking
the Maui Invitational on Jan. 4.
" 1 feel really good about the way
our team performs as a whole,"
freshman Natalie Foley said. "We
all step it up in competition and
perform well under pressure."
Junior Use Leveille led the at
tack, capturing titles on balance
beam and in the all-around com
petition. Her teammates provided
superb support, as the Cardinal se
cured all four event titles.
Foley and freshman Glyn
Sweets won the floor exercise and
vault, respectively, in their first col
legiate competition, and junior
Caroline Fluhrer took first on the

uneven bars.
"Maui was a great way to start
off the season," Smyth said. "To
perform as well as we did was real
ly exciting this early on."
This Saturday, Stanford pre
pares to take on No. 6 Denver,
which is enjoying its highest ever
Division 1 ranking following a win
over Arkansas and former head
coach of Stanford women's gym
nastics Mark Cook.
"Denver's going to be great for
us," Cooper said. "Being in these
pressure situations early on and
competing on the road is good
preparation for the postseason."
But Denver will not be easily
squelched. The Pioneers are still
licking their wounds from losing to
the Cardinal twice last season. The
second loss was handed to them at
home, where Stanford ended
Denver's season by winning the
NCAA North Central Region
Championships last April.
"We're looking forward to the
Stanford meet," Denver head
coach Melissa Kutcher-Rinehart
said. "I think this is a meet our ath
letes will be highly motivated for
because of last season's disappoint
ment, and we're excited to have
another chance with them."
Since last year's regionals, Den
ver gymnasts have been carrying
engraved keychains reading
"0.125" — the point differential
between Stanford and the Pioneers
at the regional competition — and
are waiting to avenge their loss.
The Cardinal still remains
unfazed.
"Denver will be a solid competi
tor for us, but we are focusing on
the things we can control: our gym
nastics and hitting our routines,"
Smyth said. "When we do that, we
are a phenomenal team and can
compete against anybody."

the classroom and the gym, the
future has never looked brighter
for the Cardinal.
Coming off of last year's break
through season — highlighted by
the Cardinal's first-ever NCAA
Super Six appearance — Stanford
opened its 2003 season with a
bang, crushing No. 16 Arizona
State, No. 18 New Hampshire and
San Jose State en route to taking
the Maui Invitational on Jan. 4.
" 1 feel really good about the way
our team performs as a whole,"
freshman Natalie Foley said. "We
all step it up in competition and
perform well under pressure."
Junior Use Leveille led the at
tack, capturing titles on balance
beam and in the all-around com
petition. Her teammates provided
superb support, as the Cardinal se
cured all four event titles.
Foley and freshman Glyn
Sweets won the floor exercise and
vault, respectively, in their first col
legiate competition, and junior
Caroline Fluhrer took first on the

uneven bars.
"Maui was a great way to start
off the season," Smyth said. "To
perform as well as we did was real
ly exciting this early on."
This Saturday, Stanford pre
pares to take on No. 6 Denver,
which is enjoying its highest ever
Division 1 ranking following a win
over Arkansas and former head
coach of Stanford women's gym
nastics Mark Cook.
"Denver's going to be great for
us," Cooper said. "Being in these
pressure situations early on and
competing on the road is good
preparation for the postseason."
But Denver will not be easily
squelched. The Pioneers are still
licking their wounds from losing to
the Cardinal twice last season. The
second loss was handed to them at
home, where Stanford ended
Denver's season by winning the
NCAA North Central Region
Championships last April.
"We're looking forward to the
Stanford meet," Denver head
coach Melissa Kutcher-Rinehart
said. "I think this is a meet our ath
letes will be highly motivated for
because of last season's disappoint
ment, and we're excited to have
another chance with them."
Since last year's regionals, Den
ver gymnasts have been carrying
engraved keychains reading
"0.125" — the point differential
between Stanford and the Pioneers
at the regional competition — and
are waiting to avenge their loss.
The Cardinal still remains
unfazed.
"Denver will be a solid competi
tor for us, but we are focusing on
the things we can control: our gym
nastics and hitting our routines,"
Smyth said. "When we do that, we
are a phenomenal team and can
compete against anybody."
