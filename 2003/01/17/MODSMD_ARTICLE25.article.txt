Less than one week after being
ranked No. 1 in the ITA preseason
poll, the Stanford women's tennis
team will face an immediate chal
lenge from two tournaments
boasting strong fields â€” one on
the conference level and one on
the national.

Seattle, Today-Sunday
at NCTC in Las Vegas, Today-Sunday
The Cardinal squad will be split,
with one group traveling to the
National Collegiate Women's Te
nnis Classic in Las Vegas and the
other heading to the Pacific-10
Conference Indoor Champi
onships in Seattle.
Representing Stanford at the
NCTC, a tournament featuring
many of the country's top players,
will be top freshmen No. 13 Alice
Barnes and No. 17 Amber Liu,
2002 All-American sophomore
Erin Burdetteand freshman Joan
na Kao.
Facing this strong field, in
which many top programs will be
represented, will be one of the first
national tests fora young Stanford
team without any seniors.
" There will be players from
[No. 2] Florida, [No. 3] Georgia,
[No. 11 ) Tennessee and [No. 22]
Notre Dame," said Stanford coach

Lele Forood.
"Both Florida and Georgia are
bringing players to this tourna
ment, and so any wins the team can
score over their players will cement
our place at the top," Barnes said.
Both tournaments will pose stiff
competition for the squad this
weekend, with the Pac-10 Indoors
providing an equal level of talent
ed opponents.
The Pac-10 Indoor Champi
onships are equally important for
the Cardinal, as Stanford must es
tablish itself in its own conference
and display its depth.
2002 Ail-American Lauren
Barnikow, a junior ranked No. 25
in the country in singles, will be ac
companied by fellow junior Emilia
Anderson, sophomores Story
Tweedie-Yates and Kara Guzman
and freshman Jessica Leek.
"The Pac-10 season is only
about a month away, so this tour
nament has the potential to set the
tone for the rest of the season,"
Guzman said. "It's an opportunity
to see our competition and assess
how we're doing."
And with seven Pac-10 teams
ranked in the top 25, conference
play could prove to be a greater
test than national competition.
"I think this year the [Pac-10]
teams are better than in previous
years," Forood said. "We tend to
think it's the best conference in
the country."
The Cardinal realizes the im
portance of this weekend's play.

"Every match counts but this
tournament is especially important
because if we all do well and gain
some good wins, we'll solidify our
position as No. 1, and we'll gain
some confidence going into the dual
matches later this season," Liu said.
The three freshmen playing
in the NCTC acknowledge the
support they will gain from the
presence of" the one upperclass
man, Burdette, who is traveling
with them.
"I think it's great to have an
upperclassman, especially one as
distinguished as Erin, because
she provides us with a good ex
ample to follow while on the
road," Liu said.
Barnes added: "Although the
freshmen have played many tour
naments before, we are new to the
workings of the college system,
and the upperclassmen are always
giving us much needed advice."
With four freshmen and four
sophomores, the team may not be
as experienced as some of its com
petition. Even without a single se
nior on the squad, however, the
Cardinal does not suffer from any
lack of leadership.
"The team operates pretty effi
ciently anyway without named
leaders at this point," Forood said.
"The upperclassmen pretty much
guide everybody, and with only
nine people it's not that hard."
The players know that their top
spot in the rankings is not the
defining statistic of their season

and will not let it affect their play.
"A ranking is a ranking, and it's
not final until the end of the year,"
Liu said.
Nonetheless, many of the.play
ers are energized about the top
ranking and don't feel much
added pressure.
"I don't feel any extra pressure
or expectations, because the rank

ing reflects our team and coaching
program as a whole, not so much
individually," Liu said.
"We are all really excited to have
the top team ranking," Barnes said.
"It does add a little pressure but as
Stanford players we are all used to
dealing with that, and it won't affect
our performances."
Regardless, the players are

eager to begin competitive play. "
"At about this point in the sea
son, coming back from a long win
ter break, we're going to be more
geared up for competition rather
than just drilling and working on
our shots," Guzman said. "We're
all excited for the season to start."
