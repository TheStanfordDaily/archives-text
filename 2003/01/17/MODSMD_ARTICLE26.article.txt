# Volleyball still searching for answers
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER 
It's safe to say that the Stanford
men's volleyball team still has a lot
of questions it needs to answer
heading into its Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation opener tonight.
With 10 of the conference's 12
teams taking spots in this week's
first top-15 poll, finding some quick
answers is almost a must.

vs. No. 5 BYU, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.
vs. BYU, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.
The upshot is that the Stanford's
first opponent, Brigham Young,
has plenty of early-season issues still
to deal with as well.
The No. 12 Cardinal (2-2) and
No. 5 Cougars (0-0) will be looking
to get a much-needed running start
in MPSF play when they batde at
Burnham Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 7:00 p.m.
For Stanford, the primary goal
for the weekend will be to deter
mine a solid starting seven that can
help the team overcome its disap
pointing showing at last week's
UCSB / Elephant Bar Invite in
Santa Barbara.
There the Cardinal took sixth in
the field of eight MPSF teams,
dropping matches to No. 3 UC-
Irvine and No. 9 Long Beach State,
while picking up its only win
against No. 15 Pacific.
Sophomore setter Kevin
Hansen, senior outside hitter Billy
Strickland and senior middle
blocker Paul Bocage more or less
have their spots in the starting rota
tion sealed.
The rest of the lineup, though,
remains in flux.
Sophomore middle blocker

Chris Sandman has turned in a
couple of impressive early-season
performances, making head coach
Don Shaw choose between him and
sophomore Craig Buell to fill the
second middle blocker spot. BueJll
and Sandman are each averaging
over 3.5 kills per game.
Sophomore libero David Vogel
has played in all but one game this
season, leading the team in digs in
the process. And senior All-Ameri
can outside hitter CurtToppel is oil
to a fast start, recording 65 kills in
Stanford's first four matches.
But Shaw is not yet satisfied with
what he's seen on the court so far
this season.
"We're still looking for lineups
that work and lineups that we're
comfortable with," Shaw said.
"We'll adjust to BYU is doing dur
ing the match."
BYU knew it was going to face a
lot of questions this year with coach
Tom Peterson taking over for long
time coach Carl McGown. Peterson
has some pretty big shoes to fill —
McGown guided the Cougars to
two national titles over the last four
years (1999, 2001).
filings got off to a somewhat
rocky start for BYU in the Peterson
era when the Cougars dropped an
exhibition match to Red Deer Col
lege in front of a sellout crowd at
home on Saturday.
BYU, still seething from being
left out of last year's NCAA tourna
ment, is looking to re-establish itself
as a national power following the
graduation of Ail-Americans Mike
Wall and Joaquin Acosta.
Outside hitter Paul Rafael and
setter Carlos Moreno hope to fill
the offensive void left by Wall and

Acosta, but the Cougars will more
likely rely on a more balanced at
tacking scheme this season.
"They've got a balanced attack,
so there isn't anyone we can key in
on," Shaw said. "If we handle the
ball well and don't make careless
mistakes, we have a good chance."
This will be the first meeting be
tween these teams since last year's
MPSF Tournament, when the
fourth-seeded Cougars narrowly
edged the lilth-seeded Cardinal in

five games in ProvO to end Stan
ford's season.
That loss was Stanford' second
straight five-game 4oss in the first
round of the conference tourna
ment — UCLA outlasted the Car
dinal in similar fashion in 2001.
Stanford hasn't won a postseason
match since winning the NCAA
championship in 1997.
The two matches this weekend
will be a good indication of how
the Cardinal will match up with
defending national champion and
preseason favorite Hawaii. Stan
ford faces a pair of contests against
the Warriors in Honolulu next
week.
