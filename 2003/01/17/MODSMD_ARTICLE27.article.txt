# Cal's Tamir too much for Huskies to handle
## 
### 
(AP) â€” Amit Tamir was oil bal
ance, moving to his left and trying
to shake a defender's hand from
his face.
Swish!
It was that kind of night for Cal
ifornia's sharp-shooting big man.
Tamir scored 18 of his 26
points in the second half as Cali
fornia beat Washington 73-66
Thursday night, giving the Cold
en Bears a 4-0 conference start for
the first time since 1957.
"It was a tough win on the
road," said Tamir, a 6-foot-11 for
ward from Jerusalem. "We talked
about being 4-0. We're feeling
pretty comfortable with ourselves
right now, and we just have to
build on it."
Tamir shot 6-of-7 from the field
in the last 20 minutes, hitting all
four of his second-half 3-pointers
as California (11-2, 4-0 Pac-10)

pulled away from a 29-29 halftime
tie to win its fifth straight.
It wasn't pretty, though.
The scrappy Huskies (6-8, 1-4)
made Cal earn this one. Washing
ton had a 40-31 rebounding edge
and forced 18 turnovers.
Still, California is unbeaten in
four league games for the first
time since Pete Newell worked
the sidelines.
Nate Robinson led Washington
with 15 points while Doug Wrenn
had 13 points and 10 rebounds,
but the Huskies squandered 23 of
fensive rebounds and lost for the
fourth time in live games.
"We had great opportunities
we didn't take advantage of,"
Washington coach Lorenzo
Romar said.
In other Pac-10 play, No. 2 Ari
zona beat USC, 81-72, and Ari
zona State defeated UCLA, 75-64.
