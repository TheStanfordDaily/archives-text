### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what appears to have been one of
the largest protests in recent years on
the Stanford campus, approximately
400 anti-war demonstrators — coun
tered by a small pro-war contingent —
gathered in White Plaza at noon yes
terday to oppose President George VV.
Bush's plans fora war on Iraq.
After listening to anti-war speeches
from faculty, student and community
representatives, the majority of the
crowd marched to Hoover Tower to
protest the Hoover Institution's role in

the war-making process.
"I think the rally was a demonstra
tion of the broad opposition to the cur
rent belligerence of the Bush adminis
tration," said senior Calvin Miaw, a
member of the Stanford Community
for Peace and Justice, which organized
the event.
"Students from a wide range of cam
pus communities came together to take
a political stand on these issues, and
they were supported by Stanford facul
ty and people from around the Bay
Area. Our goal as organizers was to
bring together diverse critical perspec
tives on U.S. foreign policy," he added.

Around 30 students and community
members took part in a simultaneous
pro-war counter-demonstration orga
nized by the Stanford College Republi
cans. After picketing at the fringes of
the main protest in White Plaza, they
formed a defensive line on the steps of
Hoover Tower in front of the anti-war
crowd, waving American flags and
chanting pro-Bush slogans.
In White Plaza, speakers presented
on subjects ranging from U.S. involve
ment with Saddam Hussein in the
1980s under the Reagan administra
