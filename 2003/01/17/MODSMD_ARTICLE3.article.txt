# Hundreds gather for anti-war protest
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what appears to have been one of
the largest protests in recent years on
the Stanford campus, approximately
400 anti-war demonstrators — coun
tered by a small pro-war contingent —
gathered in White Plaza at noon yes
terday to oppose President George VV.
Bush's plans fora war on Iraq.
After listening to anti-war speeches
from faculty, student and community
representatives, the majority of the
crowd marched to Hoover Tower to
protest the Hoover Institution's role in

the war-making process.
"I think the rally was a demonstra
tion of the broad opposition to the cur
rent belligerence of the Bush adminis
tration," said senior Calvin Miaw, a
member of the Stanford Community
for Peace and Justice, which organized
the event.
"Students from a wide range of cam
pus communities came together to take
a political stand on these issues, and
they were supported by Stanford facul
ty and people from around the Bay
Area. Our goal as organizers was to
bring together diverse critical perspec
tives on U.S. foreign policy," he added.

Around 30 students and community
members took part in a simultaneous
pro-war counter-demonstration orga
nized by the Stanford College Republi
cans. After picketing at the fringes of
the main protest in White Plaza, they
formed a defensive line on the steps of
Hoover Tower in front of the anti-war
crowd, waving American flags and
chanting pro-Bush slogans.
In White Plaza, speakers presented
on subjects ranging from U.S. involve
ment with Saddam Hussein in the
1980s under the Reagan administra

administration's plans fora war on Iraq. Approximately 30 pro-war demonstrators were also present.
tion to probable economic motivations for
war within current the Bush administra
tion to possible environmental-justice
repercussions of an invasion.
Yesterday, amongst the standard
protest fare — banners, flags, posters,
chants, bongo drums and the occasional
sharp exchange between persons of dif
fering opinions — some participants
used unconventional methods to express
themselves.
During the speeches, senior Wes Her
mann, covered in red paint to symbolize
"smart bomb juice," protested a possible
invasion by laying on the ground as "a ca
sualty of war" in the middle of the crowd,
next to a highway sign that read: "Your
tax dollars at work."
"A considerable amount of my tax dol
lars are being used towards the death of
human beings instead of valuable social
programs — which is especially ridicu
lous given that there is no credible threat

from Saddam Hussein and that our own
CIA says that the risk of terrorist attacks
is greater if we invade Iraq," Hermann
said.
Along with the Stanford Community
for Peace and Justice, representatives
from a wide range of groups — including
the Asian American Students Association,
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan, Resistance Art and Social
Protest, the Peninsula Peace and Justice
Center, Stanford Labor Action Coalition,
the Young Communist League and the
Pilipino American Students Union —
spoke out against a possible war.
History Prof. Joel Beinin and Religious
Studies Prof. Thomas Sheehan spoke at
the protest.
"Key policy advisers around Bush —
[Dick] Cheney, [Donald] Rumsfeld, [Paul]
Wolfowitz . . . and others — have been
plotting to remove Saddam Hussein from
power since 1996," Beinin said. "They be
lieved that 9/11 gave them the opportuni
ty to convince the U.S. people that the war
was necessary. They have no credible evi
dence to go to war, and they certainly
have no credible evidence that Iraq had

played a role in 9/11. But they're dema
gogically playing on the fear of the U.S.
people to go to war.
"Why are they doing this? They're
making a statement [that] we're the em
pire, [and] if you don't go along with us,
you're dead. There is no real military
challenge to invading Iraq and occupying
the country," Beinin continued.
"To the best of my knowledge, a large
number of the members of the Defense
Policy Board — the advisory board to the
Defense Department — are members of
the Hoover Institute. The Board, after
9/11, met on Sept. 19-20 and decided to
make plans for attacking Iraq," he
added.
Pro-war demonstrators stressed the
moral imperative of the Bush administra
tion's foreign policies.
"The rally was a show of support for
America, because we believe that good
ness and liberty are greater virtues than
peace," said senior Joe Lonsdale. "The
weak will appease evil, and the strong will
stand up to evil."
Stanford College Republican Commu

nications Director Bob Sensenbrenner,
who helped organize the pro-war rally,
agreed.
"We support the liberation of Iraq be
cause we want freedom throughout the
world," he said. "Unlike many un-democ
ratic states, Israel is a free nation. Fur
thermore, Prof. Beinin has been known
to say many anti-Israeli. . . remarks. And
we don't want this forum to turn into an
anti-Israeli rally.
"I support freedom throughout the
world," he concluded while holding an Is
raeli Hag.
While these students support Bush's
policies, others are continuing to speak
out against them.
"Hopefully more people in the com
munity will realize how important it is to
show their discontent with some of this
country's policies," said junior Leigh Tor
rence. "There is going to be a pro-affir
mative action rally next Wednesday, at
the same time and place as today's
protest, because there has also been a
backlash against minorities [from the
Bush administration]."
