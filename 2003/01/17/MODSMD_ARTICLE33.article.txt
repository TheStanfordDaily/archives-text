# Cuban-born José Bedia’s...
## Art Comes to Life 
### SARAH PAPÉ EDITORIAL STAFF 
A class of elementary school students
watched in awe Wednesday morning as they
saw art come to life on a field trip to the Can
tor Center for Visual Arts. Cuban-born artist
Jose Bedia painted a 25-foot-long mural in
the Halperin Gallery at the museum, which
was open to the public on the opening day of
his exhibit.
The mural, which also includes a sculptur
al element, is the centerpiece of the exhibition
entitled "Nsila-El Camino:Jose Bedia and the
Spirit's Path in Congo Art." The exhibit in
cludes three African sculptures from the mu
seum's collection and an additional nine
works created by Bedia in his Miami studio in
response to the African pieces.
As part of the opening of the new exhibit,
Bedia will also speak with the public tomor
row. At 1 p.m., the Spanish-speaking commu
nity is invited to the exhibition to talk with
Bedia in his native tongue about his art. The
English-speaking public is invited to join him
in the gallery at 3 p.m.
"Bedia's art will be, in part, an interpreta
tion of the figures' journey from Africa to this
museum gallery in America," explained
Manuel Jordan Perez, curator of Arts of
Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
"Crucial to this exercise is how the artist
communicates the apparently missing spiritu
al essence that was once fully active and em
bodied in each African sculpture in the show,"
Perez said. "Bedia's project will allow the ex
traordinary paths of the African ancestral
spirits to merge with his own and, by exten
sion, ours."
The title of the exhibition, "Nsila," ex

pounds on the theme of a journey. A Cuban
term derived from the central African "nzila"
(also' jila"), nsila may be literally translated as
a path, a road or a journey.
Bedia, who now lives in Miami, grew up
and was formally trained as a visual artist in
Cuba. In 1990 he immigrated to Mexico, and
he immigrated to the United States in 1993.
In 1985, Bedia was sent to Angola as part of
Cuba's African military campaign. Though he
considers the reason for his stay disgraceful,
he connected with the Angolan people and
left with a better understanding of his own be
liefs.
He was initiated into the African Regla de
Congo religion, and his art reflects his interest
in ancient belief systems, concepts of sacred
ness, spirituality and the art created by in
digenous people.
Bedia is known for his symbolically com
plex art, which often makes reference to
African cosmological principles, which were
brought over to America with the slave trade.

"I put myself inside the tradition," Bedia
said. "It is important for people to understand
the paintings. Sometimes they only look for the
formal structure. But I look for more layers."
Bedia enjoys working with large-scale pro
jects, like the 25-foot mural he painted. He
used his hands and a bucket of black paint to
create the mural. Beforehand, he sketched
what he wanted to paint, but he described the
finished mural as "more free" than the sketch.
In only 40 minutes, the painting was com
plete.
"The material dries quickly," Bedia said.
"And I wanted to use my fingers to create de
tail, so I had to work fast."
After the paint dried, Bedia added the
sculptural element. The whole piece will re
main at the museum until the exhibition clos
es, and then be returned to Bedia in Miami.
The exhibition, which is sponsored by the
Halperin Endowment for Programs at the
Cantor Arts Center, is open free to the public
through April 20, 2003.
