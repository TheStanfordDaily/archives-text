# Despite rough spots, 'Two Towers' pulls it off
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
The first thought that crossed my mind after I saw di
rector Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fel
lowship of the Ring" — the first of three films adapting J.
R. R. Tolkien's famed fantasy trilogy —a year ago was,
"Oh my God, the motherfucker pulled it off!" Holly
wood's few forays into sword-and-sorcery have been no
toriously awful, so it seemed unlikely

that any filmmaker would be able to
believably translate Tolkien's words
into cinema.
But somehow, Jackson did it. Not
only did he make the audience ac
cept a world of hobbits, elves and
dwarves, but, as in the novels, the
Middle Earth of the film felt like a
truly separate universe — real, com
plex and unspeakably old. "Fellow
ship" even managed to give off the
same sense of autumnal melancholy
permeating Tolkien's novels.
So before we go any further, I will

note that "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Tow ers" also
succeeds in "pulling it off': It believably and seriously con
tinues the story and stays true to the spirit of the books.
There are no radical changes, no sudden drops in the
quality of the direction, acting, writing or special effects.
Once again, I was able to look on the screen and BE
LIEVE.

The current film picks up right where "Fellowship" left
off: The hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean
Astin) have left the fellowship to journey alone to Mordor,
the land of the dark lord Sauron, and destroy the Ring of
Power by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom. They are
followed by Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), a strange,
pitiful creature who has been corrupted by the ring.
Meanwhile, the human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the
elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John
Rhys-Davies) race to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan)
and Pippin (Billy Boyd), also hobbits, from the minions of
the evil wizard Saruman.
Even reading this synopsis, one can get a sense of the

delicate line that "The Lord of the Rings" has to walk,
treating the melodramatic and sometimes downright silly
story with just the right mix of somberness and humor.
Hut where "Fellowship" manages this task almost flaw
lessly, pulling the viewer into its compelling plot and re
vealing one dazzling wonder after another, "The Two
Towers" stumbles.
Part of the problem, of course, is that "Fellowship" set
the bar that much

boast spec
tacular spe
cial effects
and would be
at least pretty
good, so
what I want
ed was
MORE, not
just more of
the same.
But even if

prised the first
time around that
"Fellowship"
wasn't laughably
bad — the film's
imaginative
power was just
icing on the cake.
This time, I knew
that "The Two
Towers" would

Towers" hadn't lost that element of surprise, it would still
be a lesser film than "Fellowship." For one thing, the dia
logue has a tendency to slip into unconvincing sentimen
tality. For another, the film's fragmented structure lessens
the plot's momentum, and can make most of the goings
on feel like little more than a build-up for the massive bat
tle at Helm's Deep at the movie's end.

And with the storytelling on
a far less secure footing, I found
it harder to simply get swept
away and ignore my misgivings
with Tolkien's work. The writ
ing and dialogue can be laugh
ably overblown, and I have a
deep ambivalence toward
Tolkien's fear of change, his
love of hierarchy and aristocra-

cy, and ESPECIALLY his sort of fantasy racism that
tells us that all elves, all dwarves and all ores act the
same. Things that I found objectionable about
Tolkien's ideas and stories made it into both films, but
it's in"The Two Towers" that I become far, far more
aware of them.
But again, despite all my reservations, "The Two Tow
ers" pulls off its basic task effectively, telling a good story
and conveying the sense that Middle Earth is a real world.
Every cast member does a great job, most notably Mi
randa Otto, who brings determination and longing to her

role as Eowyn, a princess of Rohan;
Viggo Mortensen, whose Aragorn is the
perfect brooding hero; and all the hob
bits, each showing the growing maturity
and complexity of their characters.
Even if it lags at points, the film manages
to deliver some absolutely stunning, un
forgettable imagery. There's Gollum,
the computer-generated character who
gives off a real sense of pathos. There are
the ents: giant, animate trees who, when
angered, become a startling vision of na
ture fighting back against industrializa
tion and technology. And there's the
spectacular Battle of Helm's Deep, in

which an unending sea of über-orcs lay siege to Rohan's
last stronghold. It's a wonderfully shot set piece with plen
ty of opportunities for pulse-pounding, swashbuckling
heroism. «
Reservations or not, these scenes and images still retain
a powerful hold on my imagination. At its best, "The Two
Towers" must be seen to be believed. See it.

The first thought that crossed my mind after I saw di
rector Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fel
lowship of the Ring" — the first of three films adapting J.
R. R. Tolkien's famed fantasy trilogy —a year ago was,
"Oh my God, the motherfucker pulled it off!" Holly
wood's few forays into sword-and-sorcery have been no
toriously awful, so it seemed unlikely

that any filmmaker would be able to
believably translate Tolkien's words
into cinema.
But somehow, Jackson did it. Not
only did he make the audience ac
cept a world of hobbits, elves and
dwarves, but, as in the novels, the
Middle Earth of the film felt like a
truly separate universe — real, com
plex and unspeakably old. "Fellow
ship" even managed to give off the
same sense of autumnal melancholy
permeating Tolkien's novels.
So before we go any further, I will

note that "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Tow ers" also
succeeds in "pulling it off': It believably and seriously con
tinues the story and stays true to the spirit of the books.
There are no radical changes, no sudden drops in the
quality of the direction, acting, writing or special effects.
Once again, I was able to look on the screen and BE
LIEVE.

The current film picks up right where "Fellowship" left
off: The hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean
Astin) have left the fellowship to journey alone to Mordor,
the land of the dark lord Sauron, and destroy the Ring of
Power by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom. They are
followed by Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), a strange,
pitiful creature who has been corrupted by the ring.
Meanwhile, the human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the
elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John
Rhys-Davies) race to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan)
and Pippin (Billy Boyd), also hobbits, from the minions of
the evil wizard Saruman.
Even reading this synopsis, one can get a sense of the

delicate line that "The Lord of the Rings" has to walk,
treating the melodramatic and sometimes downright silly
story with just the right mix of somberness and humor.
Hut where "Fellowship" manages this task almost flaw
lessly, pulling the viewer into its compelling plot and re
vealing one dazzling wonder after another, "The Two
Towers" stumbles.
Part of the problem, of course, is that "Fellowship" set
the bar that much

good, so
what I want
ed was
MORE, not

But even if

higher. I was sur
prised the first
time around that
"Fellowship"
wasn't laughably
bad — the film's
imaginative
power was just
icing on the cake.
This time, I knew
that "The Two
Towers" would

Towers" hadn't lost that element of surprise, it would still
be a lesser film than "Fellowship." For one thing, the dia
logue has a tendency to slip into unconvincing sentimen
tality. For another, the film's fragmented structure lessens
the plot's momentum, and can make most of the goings
on feel like little more than a build-up for the massive bat
tle at Helm's Deep at the movie's end.

And with the storytelling on
a far less secure footing, I found
it harder to simply get swept
away and ignore my misgivings
with Tolkien's work. The writ
ing and dialogue can be laugh
ably overblown, and I have a
deep ambivalence toward
Tolkien's fear of change, his
love of hierarchy and aristocra-

cy, and ESPECIALLY his sort of fantasy racism that
tells us that all elves, all dwarves and all ores act the
same. Things that I found objectionable about
Tolkien's ideas and stories made it into both films, but
it's in"The Two Towers" that I become far, far more
aware of them.
But again, despite all my reservations, "The Two Tow
ers" pulls off its basic task effectively, telling a good story
and conveying the sense that Middle Earth is a real world.
Every cast member does a great job, most notably Mi
randa Otto, who brings determination and longing to her

role as Eowyn, a princess of Rohan;
Viggo Mortensen, whose Aragorn is the
perfect brooding hero; and all the hob
bits, each showing the growing maturity
and complexity of their characters.
Even if it lags at points, the film manages
to deliver some absolutely stunning, un
forgettable imagery. There's Gollum,
the computer-generated character who
gives off a real sense of pathos. There are
the ents: giant, animate trees who, when
angered, become a startling vision of na
ture fighting back against industrializa
tion and technology. And there's the
spectacular Battle of Helm's Deep, in

which an unending sea of über-orcs lay siege to Rohan's
last stronghold. It's a wonderfully shot set piece with plen
ty of opportunities for pulse-pounding, swashbuckling
heroism. «
Reservations or not, these scenes and images still retain
a powerful hold on my imagination. At its best, "The Two
Towers" must be seen to be believed. See it.
