# 'Schmidt' paints depressing portrait of retirement
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
"About Schmidt" is one of those
movies put out near the end of the
year for critics to fawn over. "Oh,
look at the daring performances!"
"An amazing story of a man coming
to grips with his empty life!"
However, the important ques-

tion is, whether this is just so
much showboating for critics,
or whether the film truly does
come together in a satisfying,
meaningful and entertaining
whole. The answer to this may
depend on personal prefer
ence, but it seems to me that
"About Schmidt," while large
ly successful, comes up a bit
short where it counts.
"Schmidt" is the story of
a man who finds the life he
knows coming to an abrupt
end. His goals after retire
ment seem nonexistent, so he
allows his wife — who re
mains more strange and
opaque than ever, even after
years of marriage — to plan
their future. When she dies
unexpectedly, Warren
Schmidt is suddenly in charge

of his destiny, and he doesn't
like the direction in which it's head
ing. This includes his daughter's
impending marriage to a dolt
whose most redeeming feature is a
sensitivity that, at times, borders on
emasculated cluelessness. With little
else to do, Schmidt is moved to
sponsor an impoverished child in
Tanzania, and aside from checks

and all-too-personal le
sent to the child, saving
his daughter from
life she's chosen seems
to be his only means of
salvation.
This movie — save a
few outlandish charac
ters and sly humor —
tries to be realistic, so
Schmidt's progress is

limited. He seems to have little de
sire to connect to most other major
characters, so the audience is left re
moved from them as well. The
movie wants to be a reverse "It's a
Wonderful Life," showing its lead
character that his life didn't really
make much of a difference and that
it's too late to change all but the
smallest things now. Such a lesson
inevitably creates an unsatisfying
plot arc. And the humor in
"Schmidt" is so understated that it's
hard to see the movie as a comedy.
Some jokes are easy to miss, while
others seem to arise from anger,
desperation or decadence.
This leaves the audience to won
der what the point is — is it saying,
"Don't try to be like this person"?
Or, "some people never change no
matter how desperate life gets"? Or

is the movie just serving
the same goals as Greek
tragedy and American
reality television, in
which the audience
feels relieved that at
least their lives aren't as
bad as those they're
watching?
"Schmidt" is slow-

paced, which at first
works in its favor, but is just de
pressing toward the end. The end
ing is a false note, a touching mo
ment at odds with the rest of the
film before it. It is as though the
filmmakers realize that the movie is
too negative, but fail to think, "Wait,
what about every day for Schmidt
after this sole meaningful mo
ment?"
That said, the movie has a lot
going for it. There are eccentric
characters and smart observations
on closeness in relationships and
the hidden anger of those whose
lives seem otherwise ordinary. In
spite of all this, however, this movie
is ultimately more notable for being
Jack Nicholson's first time playing
an elderly man than for the state
ment it wishes to make about life
lived without purpose.


Nicholson's portrayal of
a middle-aged widow:
earnest or pandering to
critics?
