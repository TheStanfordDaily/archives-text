## 
### 
On Jan 9., Stanford's Faculty Senate unani
mously passed a resolution warning against the
potentially harmful effects of the USA Patriot
Act and other anti-terrorism legislation passed
by Congress after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
While acknowledging that the U.S. gov
ernment needs to effectively respond to ter
rorism, the resolution states: "Some of the ac
tions taken, or contemplated, by the federal
government . . . may harm the fundamental
educational and research missions of colleges
and universities.
"These include some aspects of restrictions

on who may use certain biological materials,
some limitations on visas for foreign students,
the discussed possibility of going beyond the
existing security classifications to restrict
broad set of vaguely defined 'sensitive' infor
mation, and the broadened range of monitor
ing of public and private communications."
Even though the resolution has no legal
power, it calls on "the Administration of the
University, on leaders of other colleges and
universities throughout the United States,
and on executive and legislative leaders of the
government of the United States to work to

gether to ensure that governmental actions
against terrorism do not compromise re
search and education."
According to Senate (.hair Hank Greely,
the resolution will be distributed to govern
ment officials and leaders in higher education
throughout the country.
Over 50 communities around the nation —
including San Francisco, Berkeley and Santa
Cruz — have passed or are considering reso
lutions protesting the Patriot Act.
