# Sugarman 3: The future of sweet, hot funk
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
The golden age of funk ended about 30
years ago, but that doesn't mean the music
is any less important today than back then.
At the very least, we can hear it as a crucial
ingredient in hip hop. Take, for example,
NWA's sampling of "Express Yourself,"
by Charles Wright and the Watts 103 rd
Street Rhythm Band, on their hit of the
same title or the sampling of Gamble and
Huff records by dozens of current acts.
However, as the Sugarman 3 demon
strate, funk is still exciting in its own right
and on its own terms.
Lead by saxophonist Neal Sugarman,
the Brooklyn-based band is at the fore
front of today's internationally budding
funk scene. Sugarman and bandmates
Adam Scone (B-3 Hammond organ),
Rudy Albin (drums) and Al Street (guitar)
play their music the way the masters once
did. If you didn't know better, you might
mistake these young guys for Booker T
and the MGs, the Mar-Keys, the Meters or
James Brown's backing band, theJßs.
The group's newest release, "Pure
Cane Sugar," preserves the sound and feel
of classic funk and has been receiving
radio airplay at Stanford's K.ZSU and UC-
Berkeley's KALX.
After the band's show at the San Fran
cisco Funk Festival this past November,
Neal Sugarman and 1 talked about funk
music today and the future of the nascent
funk scene.
Intermission: So are you guys on tour
right now or are you just doing the
Festival?
Neal Sugarman: We just played L A. last
night, and then we're in San Francisco for
two nights. Last week we were in England.
Intermission: How are you guys received
over there compared to the States?
NS: Pretty gcxxl. There's a really big record
buying audience over there, and the DJs

over there are really supportive of what
we're doing. I think they're a little more into
the kind of funk that we're into. They really
know what we're about, and if we end up
doing a cover of some Eddie Bo song,
they're really down and know the song.
Intermission: Well, what do you and the
band think of as "funk"? The average per
son probably associates it with names like
George Clinton, maybe James Brown. But
your band is definitely not like Parliament
or anything.
NS: That's a tough question. To me, it's
really about rhythm. I guess you could de
fine it technically, but I think of it as a cer
tain groove that's going to make people
move. The kind of funk that I like is so
called "rare groove" in the UK, or what
they call "deep funk" here. It's got a cer
tain soulful, raw energy that we're really
inspired by. Sometimes that comes from
the vinyl, you know, and gives you a cer
tain feeling.
Intermission: Your record label [Daptone
Records] puts out a lot of stuff on vinyl. Is
there something that you feel is really spe
cial about how music sounds on vinyl?
Given that most people these days buy
music on CD, are you guys just trying to
respect the way funk music was tradition
ally heard?
NS: Yeah, I guess we might be considered
romantics in a way. The whole thing start
ed with Desco Records, of course. On that
label, we were putting out these records,
and people didn't know if they were new
or old. Time and time again we'd get re
view that said, "yet another reissue from
Desco," and that was cool for us to see.
Intermission: Even the packaging for
most of the records makes them seem like
the old stuff from the late '60s. Was that
something you did on purpose or did it
just turn out that way?
NS: We're just trying to make records like
the ones we like. We're not really trying to
please anyone. In the early days, Desco
wasn't even releasing CDs, and it was a big
move to start doing that. A big part of it is
that I just love the vinyl format. It used to
be that you put on one side ofan album on
your turntable, come home, play one side,
go around your house, do your thing and
play the same side again. Then a few days
later, flip it over and start digesting the
other side. Physically, vinyl just makes
more sense to me.
Intermission: What led you guys to start
the label after Desco?
NS: Desco split up because Phil [Lehman]
and Gabe [Roth], who founded the label,
had their differences. Phil started a label
called Soulfire and the Sugarman 3 cut a
few records for that label. But, we really
started working on the new album unsure
of who was going to put it out. Gabe and I
were talking and just thought, "Maybe we
can try this." So far, it's going well. We're
earning a name for ourselves with [Dap

tone]. It's hard because we're both artists,
and running a label is a fulltime job. But,
it's interesting and when I'm not touring,
I'll have this to fall back on, and I want to
do different things with the label.
Intermission: Where do you see it going
in the future?
NS: Well, right now we're going to put out
a new record by the Mighty Imperials.
We're really into Afrobeat music and funk,
and I definitely think we're going to keep
it stylistically in the same genre. Obviously
I want to sell records and appeal to a lot of
people.
Intermission: Is that your goal, to go fora
wider audience?
NS: I think so, but it's hard to gauge our
demographic. I mean, you have kids that
are coming from hip hop and getting
into break beats. Then you have the
older people that have been listening to
soul and funk music for years and years.
There are kids that are into indie rock
that are fed up with the industry and how
everything in that genre is sort of mor
phing into itself. So, we try to keep it
open and put out records that are raw
and have a certain amount of energy. For
example, one project for the near future
is a gospel record, which should be an in
teresting experience.
Intermission: The funk scene is small
right now. Are you afraid that people will
look at as a fad, kind of the way people see
the ska scene of the late '90s?
NS: I've listened to a lot of ska and I love
Rocksteady [early Jamaican ska from the
'60s]. That early stuff had soul and is total
ly different from the later music you're
talking about. I feel that a lot of that was
bunch of rock 'n' roll musicians trying to
play swing. So, I think we're tapping into
a very different genre; we're concentrat
ing on keeping it pure.
Intermission: What do you think is differ
ent about the work you're doing com
pared to the stuff in the early '70s.
NS: I don't know, man. That was a golden
age. But if you think about it, the greatest
funk records came out between 1967 and
1972. It's a short amount of time for the
amount of records that came out.
Intermission: When you look back, why
do you think people stopped making funk
music?
NS: It just evolved. Some of it turned into
disco, and there were great disco records.
I think that, like anything, a lot of these
artists were getting sucked into the in
dustry. You know, "Everyone is trying to
keep up with the Jones'." But at the same
time, I don't think you should take the
music too seriously. Ultimately, this
[funk music] is just barbeque music. I
don't want to seem too serious about jt.
That would just be the worst thing that
could happen to it.

[funk music] is just barbeque music. I
don't want to seem too serious about jt.
That would just be the worst thing that
could happen to it.

The golden age of funk ended about 30
years ago, but that doesn't mean the music
is any less important today than back then.
At the very least, we can hear it as a crucial
ingredient in hip hop. Take, for example,
NWA's sampling of "Express Yourself,"
by Charles Wright and the Watts 103 rd
Street Rhythm Band, on their hit of the
same title or the sampling of Gamble and
Huff records by dozens of current acts.
However, as the Sugarman 3 demon
strate, funk is still exciting in its own right
and on its own terms.
Lead by saxophonist Neal Sugarman,
the Brooklyn-based band is at the fore
front of today's internationally budding
funk scene. Sugarman and bandmates
Adam Scone (B-3 Hammond organ),
Rudy Albin (drums) and Al Street (guitar)
play their music the way the masters once
did. If you didn't know better, you might
mistake these young guys for Booker T
and the MGs, the Mar-Keys, the Meters or
James Brown's backing band, theJßs.
The group's newest release, "Pure
Cane Sugar," preserves the sound and feel
of classic funk and has been receiving
radio airplay at Stanford's K.ZSU and UC-
Berkeley's KALX.
After the band's show at the San Fran
cisco Funk Festival this past November,
Neal Sugarman and 1 talked about funk
music today and the future of the nascent
funk scene.
Intermission: So are you guys on tour
right now or are you just doing the
Festival?
Neal Sugarman: We just played L A. last
night, and then we're in San Francisco for
two nights. Last week we were in England.
Intermission: How are you guys received
over there compared to the States?
NS: Pretty gcxxl. There's a really big record
buying audience over there, and the DJs

over there are really supportive of what
we're doing. I think they're a little more into
the kind of funk that we're into. They really
know what we're about, and if we end up
doing a cover of some Eddie Bo song,
they're really down and know the song.
Intermission: Well, what do you and the
band think of as "funk"? The average per
son probably associates it with names like
George Clinton, maybe James Brown. But
your band is definitely not like Parliament
or anything.
NS: That's a tough question. To me, it's
really about rhythm. I guess you could de
fine it technically, but I think of it as a cer
tain groove that's going to make people
move. The kind of funk that I like is so
called "rare groove" in the UK, or what
they call "deep funk" here. It's got a cer
tain soulful, raw energy that we're really
inspired by. Sometimes that comes from
the vinyl, you know, and gives you a cer
tain feeling.
Intermission: Your record label [Daptone
Records] puts out a lot of stuff on vinyl. Is
there something that you feel is really spe
cial about how music sounds on vinyl?
Given that most people these days buy
music on CD, are you guys just trying to
respect the way funk music was tradition
ally heard?
NS: Yeah, I guess we might be considered
romantics in a way. The whole thing start
ed with Desco Records, of course. On that
label, we were putting out these records,
and people didn't know if they were new
or old. Time and time again we'd get re
view that said, "yet another reissue from
Desco," and that was cool for us to see.
Intermission: Even the packaging for
most of the records makes them seem like
the old stuff from the late '60s. Was that
something you did on purpose or did it
just turn out that way?
NS: We're just trying to make records like
the ones we like. We're not really trying to
please anyone. In the early days, Desco
wasn't even releasing CDs, and it was a big
move to start doing that. A big part of it is
that I just love the vinyl format. It used to
be that you put on one side ofan album on
your turntable, come home, play one side,
go around your house, do your thing and
play the same side again. Then a few days
later, flip it over and start digesting the
other side. Physically, vinyl just makes
more sense to me.
Intermission: What led you guys to start
the label after Desco?
NS: Desco split up because Phil [Lehman]
and Gabe [Roth], who founded the label,
had their differences. Phil started a label
called Soulfire and the Sugarman 3 cut a
few records for that label. But, we really
started working on the new album unsure
of who was going to put it out. Gabe and I
were talking and just thought, "Maybe we
can try this." So far, it's going well. We're
earning a name for ourselves with [Dap

tone]. It's hard because we're both artists,
and running a label is a fulltime job. But,
it's interesting and when I'm not touring,
I'll have this to fall back on, and I want to
do different things with the label.
Intermission: Where do you see it going
in the future?
NS: Well, right now we're going to put out
a new record by the Mighty Imperials.
We're really into Afrobeat music and funk,
and I definitely think we're going to keep
it stylistically in the same genre. Obviously
I want to sell records and appeal to a lot of
people.
Intermission: Is that your goal, to go fora
wider audience?
NS: I think so, but it's hard to gauge our
demographic. I mean, you have kids that
are coming from hip hop and getting
into break beats. Then you have the
older people that have been listening to
soul and funk music for years and years.
There are kids that are into indie rock
that are fed up with the industry and how
everything in that genre is sort of mor
phing into itself. So, we try to keep it
open and put out records that are raw
and have a certain amount of energy. For
example, one project for the near future
is a gospel record, which should be an in
teresting experience.
Intermission: The funk scene is small
right now. Are you afraid that people will
look at as a fad, kind of the way people see
the ska scene of the late '90s?
NS: I've listened to a lot of ska and I love
Rocksteady [early Jamaican ska from the
'60s]. That early stuff had soul and is total
ly different from the later music you're
talking about. I feel that a lot of that was
bunch of rock 'n' roll musicians trying to
play swing. So, I think we're tapping into
a very different genre; we're concentrat
ing on keeping it pure.
Intermission: What do you think is differ
ent about the work you're doing com
pared to the stuff in the early '70s.
NS: I don't know, man. That was a golden
age. But if you think about it, the greatest
funk records came out between 1967 and
1972. It's a short amount of time for the
amount of records that came out.
Intermission: When you look back, why
do you think people stopped making funk
music?
NS: It just evolved. Some of it turned into
disco, and there were great disco records.
I think that, like anything, a lot of these
artists were getting sucked into the in
dustry. You know, "Everyone is trying to
keep up with the Jones'." But at the same
time, I don't think you should take the
music too seriously. Ultimately, this
[funk music] is just barbeque music. I
don't want to seem too serious about jt.
