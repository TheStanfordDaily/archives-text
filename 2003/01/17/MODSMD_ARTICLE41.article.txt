# Zombies, aliens and one messed-up party

### RYAN SANDS 
The last video game system I ever owned was the Sega Genesis, a 16-bit gem
of a machine that was host to a handful of brilliant "Sonic the Hedgehog"
games and not much else. Before that, I had been ushered into the home gam
ing world like every other '80s child with the arrival of an 8-bit Nintendo En
tertainment System on a middle school Christmas morning. I know my old
school games; I can get all the way to Mike Tyson in "Punchout" with being
knocked down once, have spent countless hours searching dungeons of
"Zelda" for pieces of the Triforce and have the Konami code that gives you 30
lives in "Contra" forever etched on my brain.
When it comes to the video games systems that followed the Sega Genesis, I
must admit to my painful ignorance. After "Mortal Kombat" (which featured
characters pulling each other's spines out) and "Night Trap" (which featured
scenes of nightgown-clad Dana Plato being stalked by vampires) came out back
in the early '90s, my mom bought Sen. Joe Lieberman and Tipper Gore's rants
in the news reports that games were too violent and would warp her son's
mind. Abrupdy, the money that had been tunneled into dozens of NES games
started going toward comic books and CDs, marking the beginning of my
home's ten-year closed door policy toward video games.
Since coming to college (and rooming two years with a kid who owns a
Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Xbox AND Gamecube) I've seen my share of new
video games. And sure, I've gunned down my fair share of policeman, roam
ing the streets of Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto 3. But since the Genesis hey
day back in fifth grade, I've NEVER really gotten to play video games-(and yes,
I am bitter about it!). During all the hours I've spent watching kids run around

stalking each other with automatic

weapons in Counter
strike (or Halo or Quake
[ or whatever you CS boys
are always yelling
about), I've always want

tiny 15-inch TV clenching a sweaty con
troller, here is my take on three of Nin
tendo's biggest new games for the Game
cube.

Mario Fartv 4
*
"Mario Party 4" comes from a healthy tradition of games that were conceived
of and designed entirely by guys on LSD. I played this game for about two
hours in one sitting and completely lost touch with reality, falling into a world
of giant mushrooms, ghosts with teeth and flashing lights. It's basically irrele
vant once you get into the gameplay itself, but the setup for this whole crazy or
deal is that Toad and Koopa and some other bad guys come flying in on a
huge-ass "Party Cube" and crash Mario's birthday party. In a moment of "Ju
manji' -esque lunacy, you and all the other staple "Mario Bros" characters like
Princess, Yoshi and Donkey Kong are sucked into the cube and must compete
for... BIRTHDAY PRESENTS! The game itself is basically a glorified board
game with several mini-games that include tapping buttons and running
through mazes.
"Mario Party 4" seems like the perfect game for kids who don't have the atten
tion span necessary to sit through a game of Monopoly and aren't able to un
derstand the complexities of Trouble or Sorry. The only use I can see a Stan
ford student getting out of "Mario Party 4" would be to use as a babysitting de
vice on their younger siblings; in any other situation (other than being stoned
out of your mind) this game's painful snail pace of gameplay and overwhelm
ing, but completely meaningless, visual charms will annoy the crap out of you.

Metroid Prime ★★★★&

The newest update of the classic "Metroid" game series
was the most eagerly awaited game of 2002 for many

Gamecube owners. The original game, "Metroid,"
(known by many of our generation as the best Nintendo
game ever) follows the space hunter Samus Aran as she

battles alien lifeforms (coincidentally called "Metroids")

on the planet Zebes. The "Metroid" series has been revived
on many different gaming platforms over the years, includ-

ing the Super Nintendo and the Game Boy, but "Metroid 41
Prime" marks the first "Metroid" incarnation on one of the "next

generation" systems such as the Gamecube; needless to say, \
geeky fanboys everywhere were anxious to see how the pixilated

8-bit Samus would translate to the cinematic and atmospheric
graphics capable in today's games.

Let me just say right out that I was supremely disappointed when I heard
that "Metroid Prime" was going to be a first-person shooter, rather than a side
scrolling game. Basically this means that rather than seeing your character
from a side view and moving them horizontally through the caves of Zebes, you
see what your character sees, which usually involves the smoking barrel of a
gun, but in "Metroid Prime's" case involves space-age wave beams and plasma
weapons. For me, first-person shooters just don't cut it — granted, watching
the game unfold through your character's own eyes has its own appeal, but my

favorite parts of the side-scrolling original game, like nav
igating Samus over walls and through tiny passages

and dodging attacks from Space
Pirates, take on a distinctly dif-

ferent feel in first person.
Aside from my origi-

nal disappointment at
the format of i

"Metroid Prime," the
game is truly breath-

taking. The game

Prime" as much as 1 watched my

roommate Pat Wood become engrossed in it. I mean ENGROSSED — like,
skipping-classes-and-staying-up-until-4-a.m.-fighting-his-way-through-space
ship-reactor-cores engrossed.
Rather than try to describe the gameplay myself, I'll let Pat say a few words
about his gaming experience: "Since I don't suffer from Nintendo fan-boy syn
drome, I was free to experience the sheer awesomeness of this game. The two
most important elements for me — graphics and gameplay design —are there
in spades. The graphics give real life a run for its money, and the design is
super-tight, in both senses of the word."
Resident Evil Zero ★★★★★
Far and above, my favorite game on the Gamecube is "Resident Evil Zero."
This game is fucking intense. "Resident Evil Zero" is a prequel to the wildly
popular "Resident Evil" game for Playstation, which sparked three sequels and
a big blockbuster film adaptation. In these games you control a member of the
S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit assigned to investigate
grotesque happenings in and around Raccoon City. "Resident Evil" pioneered
the Survival-Horror genre in which your characters must fight off onslaughts
of bad guys, with only your limited weapons, failing health and MacGuyver
like puzzle solving skills to help you.

In "Resident Evil," the bad guys are zombies. Hordes and hordes of dis
gusting, brain-eating zombies lurk and creep through the mansions, un-

derground laboratories and abandoned warehouses of Raccoon City.

Now, like most gamers, I can handle undead corpses clawing at
me as I fire my handgun wildly, but "Resident Evil Zero" takes it

to the next level, bringing in undead, brain-eating animals of
all shapes: relentless zombie dogs, giant mutated scorpions
and termites. The game even throws in some zombie chim
panzees, which struck me as a stroke of genius.
"Resident Evil Zero," whose storyline takes place before the
events of the original game, starts you out on an abandoned
train full of slaughtered passengers (who, of course, try to de
vour you when you turn your back on them) and then moves

you to the training headquarters of the evil Umbrella Corpora
tion, the assholes responsible for creating the virus that turned

everybody into zombies in the first place. Using the incredible
graphic capabilities of the Gamecube, the atmosphere in "RE:0" is

claustrophobic and startling to the extreme. Every shadow flickering
from a candle makes you jump and the detail of the zombies' decay and pu
trescence made my stomach turn. As you can tell, I LOVED this game.
The game has a few great new features, including the partner system which
allows you to control both Billy, an escaped convict with some wicked arm tat
toos, and Rebecca, a mostly useless novice of the S.T.A.R.S. team who gets
killed a lot easier than Billy does. The game forces you to use the partner sys-

tem to solve puzzles, often controlling the characters in two
separate areas of the game. It's sometimes frustrating, but

it adds another level of complexity to an already engag-

ing game.
This game has everything 1 like about video games
— crazy zombie attacks, napalm grenade launchers

and killer undead sharks.

It's the stuff night
mares are made of,
and I loved every
second of it.

derstand the complexities of Trouble or Sorry. The only use I can see a Stan
ford student getting out of "Mario Party 4" would be to use as a babysitting de
vice on their younger siblings; in any other situation (other than being stoned
out of your mind) this game's painful snail pace of gameplay and overwhelm
ing, but completely meaningless, visual charms will annoy the crap out of you.

Metroid Prime ★★★★&

The newest update of the classic "Metroid" game series
was the most eagerly awaited game of 2002 for many

Gamecube owners. The original game, "Metroid,"
(known by many of our generation as the best Nintendo
game ever) follows the space hunter Samus Aran as she

battles alien lifeforms (coincidentally called "Metroids")

on the planet Zebes. The "Metroid" series has been revived
on many different gaming platforms over the years, includ-

ing the Super Nintendo and the Game Boy, but "Metroid 41
Prime" marks the first "Metroid" incarnation on one of the "next

generation" systems such as the Gamecube; needless to say, \
geeky fanboys everywhere were anxious to see how the pixilated

8-bit Samus would translate to the cinematic and atmospheric
graphics capable in today's games.

Let me just say right out that I was supremely disappointed when I heard
that "Metroid Prime" was going to be a first-person shooter, rather than a side
scrolling game. Basically this means that rather than seeing your character
from a side view and moving them horizontally through the caves of Zebes, you
see what your character sees, which usually involves the smoking barrel of a
gun, but in "Metroid Prime's" case involves space-age wave beams and plasma
weapons. For me, first-person shooters just don't cut it — granted, watching
the game unfold through your character's own eyes has its own appeal, but my

favorite parts of the side-scrolling original game, like nav
igating Samus over walls and through tiny passages

and dodging attacks from Space
Pirates, take on a distinctly dif-

ferent feel in first person.
Aside from my origi-

nal disappointment at
the format of i

"Metroid Prime," the

roommate Pat Wood become engrossed in it. I mean ENGROSSED — like,
skipping-classes-and-staying-up-until-4-a.m.-fighting-his-way-through-space
ship-reactor-cores engrossed.
Rather than try to describe the gameplay myself, I'll let Pat say a few words
about his gaming experience: "Since I don't suffer from Nintendo fan-boy syn
drome, I was free to experience the sheer awesomeness of this game. The two
most important elements for me — graphics and gameplay design —are there
in spades. The graphics give real life a run for its money, and the design is
super-tight, in both senses of the word."
Resident Evil Zero ★★★★★
Far and above, my favorite game on the Gamecube is "Resident Evil Zero."
This game is fucking intense. "Resident Evil Zero" is a prequel to the wildly
popular "Resident Evil" game for Playstation, which sparked three sequels and
a big blockbuster film adaptation. In these games you control a member of the
S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit assigned to investigate
grotesque happenings in and around Raccoon City. "Resident Evil" pioneered
the Survival-Horror genre in which your characters must fight off onslaughts
of bad guys, with only your limited weapons, failing health and MacGuyver
like puzzle solving skills to help you.

In "Resident Evil," the bad guys are zombies. Hordes and hordes of dis
gusting, brain-eating zombies lurk and creep through the mansions, un-

derground laboratories and abandoned warehouses of Raccoon City.

Now, like most gamers, I can handle undead corpses clawing at
me as I fire my handgun wildly, but "Resident Evil Zero" takes it

to the next level, bringing in undead, brain-eating animals of
all shapes: relentless zombie dogs, giant mutated scorpions
and termites. The game even throws in some zombie chim
panzees, which struck me as a stroke of genius.
"Resident Evil Zero," whose storyline takes place before the
events of the original game, starts you out on an abandoned
train full of slaughtered passengers (who, of course, try to de
vour you when you turn your back on them) and then moves

you to the training headquarters of the evil Umbrella Corpora
tion, the assholes responsible for creating the virus that turned

everybody into zombies in the first place. Using the incredible
graphic capabilities of the Gamecube, the atmosphere in "RE:0" is

claustrophobic and startling to the extreme. Every shadow flickering
from a candle makes you jump and the detail of the zombies' decay and pu
trescence made my stomach turn. As you can tell, I LOVED this game.
The game has a few great new features, including the partner system which
allows you to control both Billy, an escaped convict with some wicked arm tat
toos, and Rebecca, a mostly useless novice of the S.T.A.R.S. team who gets
killed a lot easier than Billy does. The game forces you to use the partner sys-

tem to solve puzzles, often controlling the characters in two
separate areas of the game. It's sometimes frustrating, but

it adds another level of complexity to an already engag-

ing game.
This game has everything 1 like about video games
— crazy zombie attacks, napalm grenade launchers

and killer undead sharks.

It's the stuff night
mares are made of,
and I loved every
second of it.





The last video game system I ever owned was the Sega Genesis, a 16-bit gem
of a machine that was host to a handful of brilliant "Sonic the Hedgehog"
games and not much else. Before that, I had been ushered into the home gam
ing world like every other '80s child with the arrival of an 8-bit Nintendo En
tertainment System on a middle school Christmas morning. I know my old
school games; I can get all the way to Mike Tyson in "Punchout" with being
knocked down once, have spent countless hours searching dungeons of
"Zelda" for pieces of the Triforce and have the Konami code that gives you 30
lives in "Contra" forever etched on my brain.
When it comes to the video games systems that followed the Sega Genesis, I
must admit to my painful ignorance. After "Mortal Kombat" (which featured
characters pulling each other's spines out) and "Night Trap" (which featured
scenes of nightgown-clad Dana Plato being stalked by vampires) came out back
in the early '90s, my mom bought Sen. Joe Lieberman and Tipper Gore's rants
in the news reports that games were too violent and would warp her son's
mind. Abrupdy, the money that had been tunneled into dozens of NES games
started going toward comic books and CDs, marking the beginning of my
home's ten-year closed door policy toward video games.
Since coming to college (and rooming two years with a kid who owns a
Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Xbox AND Gamecube) I've seen my share of new
video games. And sure, I've gunned down my fair share of policeman, roam
ing the streets of Liberty City in Grand Theft Auto 3. But since the Genesis hey
day back in fifth grade, I've NEVER really gotten to play video games-(and yes,
I am bitter about it!). During all the hours I've spent watching kids run around

stalking each other with automatic

weapons in Counter
strike (or Halo or Quake
[ or whatever you CS boys
are always yelling
about), I've always want
ed a chance to just sit and

tiny 15-inch TV clenching a sweaty con
troller, here is my take on three of Nin
tendo's biggest new games for the Game
cube.

Mario Fartv 4
*
"Mario Party 4" comes from a healthy tradition of games that were conceived
of and designed entirely by guys on LSD. I played this game for about two
hours in one sitting and completely lost touch with reality, falling into a world
of giant mushrooms, ghosts with teeth and flashing lights. It's basically irrele
vant once you get into the gameplay itself, but the setup for this whole crazy or
deal is that Toad and Koopa and some other bad guys come flying in on a
huge-ass "Party Cube" and crash Mario's birthday party. In a moment of "Ju
manji' -esque lunacy, you and all the other staple "Mario Bros" characters like
Princess, Yoshi and Donkey Kong are sucked into the cube and must compete
for... BIRTHDAY PRESENTS! The game itself is basically a glorified board
game with several mini-games that include tapping buttons and running
through mazes.
"Mario Party 4" seems like the perfect game for kids who don't have the atten
tion span necessary to sit through a game of Monopoly and aren't able to un
derstand the complexities of Trouble or Sorry. The only use I can see a Stan
ford student getting out of "Mario Party 4" would be to use as a babysitting de

grotesque happenings in and around Raccoon City. "Resident Evil" pioneered
the Survival-Horror genre in which your characters must fight off onslaughts
of bad guys, with only your limited weapons, failing health and MacGuyver
like puzzle solving skills to help you.

In "Resident Evil," the bad guys are zombies. Hordes and hordes of dis
gusting, brain-eating zombies lurk and creep through the mansions, un-

derground laboratories and abandoned warehouses of Raccoon City.

Now, like most gamers, I can handle undead corpses clawing at
me as I fire my handgun wildly, but "Resident Evil Zero" takes it

to the next level, bringing in undead, brain-eating animals of
all shapes: relentless zombie dogs, giant mutated scorpions
and termites. The game even throws in some zombie chim
panzees, which struck me as a stroke of genius.
"Resident Evil Zero," whose storyline takes place before the
events of the original game, starts you out on an abandoned
train full of slaughtered passengers (who, of course, try to de
vour you when you turn your back on them) and then moves

you to the training headquarters of the evil Umbrella Corpora
tion, the assholes responsible for creating the virus that turned

everybody into zombies in the first place. Using the incredible
graphic capabilities of the Gamecube, the atmosphere in "RE:0" is

claustrophobic and startling to the extreme. Every shadow flickering
from a candle makes you jump and the detail of the zombies' decay and pu
trescence made my stomach turn. As you can tell, I LOVED this game.
The game has a few great new features, including the partner system which
allows you to control both Billy, an escaped convict with some wicked arm tat
toos, and Rebecca, a mostly useless novice of the S.T.A.R.S. team who gets
killed a lot easier than Billy does. The game forces you to use the partner sys-

tem to solve puzzles, often controlling the characters in two
separate areas of the game. It's sometimes frustrating, but

it adds another level of complexity to an already engag-

ing game.
This game has everything 1 like about video games
— crazy zombie attacks, napalm grenade launchers

and killer undead sharks.

It's the stuff night
mares are made of,
and I loved every
second of it.
