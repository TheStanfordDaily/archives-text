# Adaptation follows exploits of Dicken's Nickleby
## 
### TRACEY NYBERG 
Adaptation, as Charlie Kaufman
would certainly agree, is a difficult
thing to attempt. One must remain
faithful to the original work while
creating a script that will lend itself
well to film. In the case of Douglas
McGrath, Charles Dickens is not
alive and able to judge with what
relative faithfulness this screen
adaptation of his 1838 novel is ren
dered. Yet I venture to say that
Dickens would commend McGrath,
who has done a fabulous job of writ
ing and directing this film while
maintaining the important themes
of "Nicholas Nickleby" the novel.
Not a simple task, considering the
expansive nature of Dickens' prose.
The story opens with the birth of
Nicholas Nickleby, and quickly treats
the loss of the family fortune and
death of his father, leaving Nicholas
(Charlie Hunnam), his sister Kate
and his mother to seek out help from
their wealthy relative in London,
Ralph Nickleby (Christopher Plum
mer). Feel free to boo and hiss at
Ralph, as Plummer delivers a deli
ciously evil performance as the
greedy uncle. Nicholas is sent by
Ralph to be the assistant headmaster
at a Yorkshire School, run by the
Squeers family. Mr. Squeers (Jim
Broadbent) is a one-eyed torturer of
boys, surpassed only in cruelty by his
wife. Nicholas takes pity on one of
the most pitiful characters ever creat-

Ed, a crippled boy named Smike

(Jamie Bell). The horrors per-

petuated at this school
are beyond cruel, andy
the cinematography is
at its darkest. The
countryside is barren,
in sharp contrast to the
opening scenes at the
Nickleby cottage where
green is the rule.
Smike and Nicholas

escape the school, and Nicholas is
called to London to help his family.
While in London, he meets
Madeleine Bray (Anne Hathaway)
and promptly falls in love. Natural
ly the course of true love does not
run smoothly, and things only get
worse before they get better. There
are so many characters that they
seem to flash on the screen, but it is
a testament to how well the script is
written that you get a full sense of
the characters, despite their brief
appearances.
This movie captures the human
condition to perfection. Nicholas
and Smike are devoted friends, and
Smike is such a pathetic figure that
it is only natural to feel the deepest
pity for the tragic creature. The ro
mance in the film is sweeping, and
the chemistry between Nicholas
and Madeleine is electric. While the
language is more eloquent than,
anyone would find in normal con
versation, the actors deliver their
lines with such ease and the ideas

are so universally true that many
quotes remain lodged in one's
mind well after the credits have
rolled. What Nicholas must face in
the world is not much different
than what awaits the college stu
dent upon graduation â€” decep
tion, greed and ill-will, in addition
to generosity, kindness and love.

In a conversation with one of his
employers, Nicholas states, "I feel
more like a child now than ever
when my father was alive." As the
responsibility of adulthood presses
more and more forcefully, it is a
natural reaction for any person.
Yet Nicholas responds by creating
a new family around him, "person

by person," in such a fashion that
you can only leave the theater be
lieving the best in humanity. This
film also reminds you why you sit
through so many crappy movies:
because inevitably one comes
along that is so fantastic you feel
that you are a better person for
having seen the film.
