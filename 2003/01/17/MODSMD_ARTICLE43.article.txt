# Nas stays true to his roots: Mamma's boy, God's son

It's touching how much gangstas
truly love their mommas. Nas, for ex
ample, disses Jay-Z ("Jay tried a sneak
attack / assassinate my character, de
grade my hood / because in order for
him to be the Don, I had to go") in"The
Last Real N**** Alive" for rekindling

their famous duel while Nas was

at home tending to his sick >
mother, who succumbed to fl
cancer last spring. His mom is V
mentioned in several tracks; *

she is the subject of "Dance," a slower
rap with a great beat but overly affected
lyrics ("If I could have one more dance
with you mommaaaahh," he croons).
Nas' verbal feud with Jay-Z is notice
ably less apparent in his seventh disc,
"God's Son," than his previous records,
perhaps because Nas has since collabo
rated with Murder Inc., the label that

supports Jigga's
Rocafella Records.
Or maybe he just
really misses his
momma. Whatev
er the reason,
• II ' .

"God's Son" is a highly introspective
album, and the best tracks are those
that put Nas' skills and social conscious
ness on display.
"I Can" is directed to the "ghetto
children" and samples Beethoven's
"Moonlight Sonata," a surprising, yet
effective choice. Nas tells them: "If the
truth is told / the youth can grow /
they'll learn to survive until they gain
control / Nobody says you have to be
gangstas' hos / Read more, learn more,
change the globe."
Of course, there are guest stars
aplenty in this disc: City High, Alicia
Keys and Tupac Shakur (his voice from
his LP "Better Days" is recycled in
"Thugz Mansion") all make appear
ances. Their collaborations are slight
since Nas is his confident best solo.
Unfortunately, there are not
enough tracks that demonstrate his
mastery to its full eflect. The first single,

"Made You Look," is a delight, full of
clever self-promotion and with a real
old school feel, but the rest of the CD
doesn't live up to the hype.
If you recall, during a radio inter
view last June, Nas blasted mainstream
rappers for selling out, reusing rhymes
and beats and impeding innovation,
but retracted his barbs and publicly
apologized a few weeks before this CD
was released. Whether or not he was
truly repentant, his latest effort is a de
parture from the radio-friendly but
creatively tired tracks that Nelly and
Cam'ron, two artists he specifically tar
geted, pump out.
He slyly tells such hip-hop stars,
"Y'all can keep your weak beats / from
your corny producers" on "The Cross,"
a strong track rife with religious im
agery that cements his status as "a rap
per's rapper" who is looking to rein
vent himself.
It seems that the reinvention is still
in progress, but Nas gets points for at
least trying to break out of the mold
that rap has gelled into these past few
years. The golden age of hip hop may
surely be over, but if Nas has his way, a
resurrection is on the horizon.
