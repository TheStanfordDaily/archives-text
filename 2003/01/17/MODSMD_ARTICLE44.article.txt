# Robbie Williams: He can rhyme 'Connery’ with 'sodomy’

### KARAN MAHAJAN 
You wake up in 2003 and find yourself on the
wrong side of the U.S. pop-schism. Britney Spears has
mastered the mechanics of the middle finger. Christi
na Aguilera chews off her own clothes in an attempt to
be risque but ends up as an anorexic Xena, Warrior
Princess. Justin Timberlake goes so-damn-10. Michael

Jackson dangles babies
It is in times such a<
this that we must turn .
to the ripples of the/
Union Jack, to the\
rigorous wit of the

cross-Atlantic geezers, to
the shit-spewing, chain-thumping prisoners of her
majesty. To Robbie Williams, the crown prince of wails,
who comes with enough talent to out-fizz a bottle of
whiskey and enough gel in his hair to grease hell over
three times.
Okay, let me amend that. He's not that great, but he
does have the biggest recording deal and fan base in
UK music history, and he has picked a fight with the
Gallagher brothers. Also, I'm no anglophile, but Rob
bie William's Elton John meets Oasis pop is such a wel
come reprieve from the bloating-at-the-hips-stubbed
at-the-tips world of American radio, that I'm ready to
pass up my passive resistance to this genre fora bit of
catharsis. This, people, is pop for majors. Naughty, not
dirty (attention: Aguilera).
"Escapology," while not nearly as hit-laden as "I've
Been Expecting You" or as goofy as "Sing When
You're Winning," is as smooth as the belly of a Bond

girl. The songs swell with strings and Williams' voice is
finely sandpapered, hitting the high notes well. The
album clearly comprises part of his continuous cam
paign to he Pierce Brosnan's successor, but movie am
bitions and Sinatra impressions aside, the album is par
ticularly notable for its smugness and tabloid-teasing.
Be clear about it, Robbie Williams is no Eminem — in
stead, he's here to tell you, "You can't argue with pop
ularity / Well you could, but you'd be wrong," and to
belt out all the hooks he can.
Beginning with the first single (the power-poppish

"Feel"), Robbie Williams delivers a shiny
catalogue of hits that atone for some of
his self-indulgence. For instance, you
might wince at the line "Don't wanna
piss on your parade / I'm here to make
money and get laid" in "Monsoon," but
you're bound to be washed away by the
superlative crescendo.
And though you'll be disappointed
that successors to such pop revelations
such as "No Regrets" and "Millennium"
find no place here, the meandering "Me
and My Monkey" will cause all your la
tent Beatle-passions to well up. This
song is a hilarious referential diatribe
that recalls "Rocky Raccoon" and steals
its title from John Lennon's "Every
body's Got Something to Hide Except
for Me and My Monkey." But at seven
minutes, Williams has nothing to hide
and everything to tell.
That's also this wonderful album's

greatest vice. The same ideas are recycled until even
this witty bow-tie wielding star comes across as a pur
veyor of platitudes. But I'll excuse him for that be
cause he does such a good job ripping off Elton on
"Love Somebody" and because he's an earnest punk
rocker on "Song 3." He combines the swagger and
devilish charm that made us love pop music in the
first place. I, for one, will be keeping my fingers
crossed, hoping that Robbie Williams is able to un
dertake the great transatlantic boogie walk before
falling off the dance floor.
