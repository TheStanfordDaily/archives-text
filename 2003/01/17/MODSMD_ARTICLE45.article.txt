# Technical virgins unite — De-virginize Stanford!
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Head, fellatio, face, cunnilingus; call it what you
will, but oral sex has become a hook up staple at our
semi-sexual campus. Yet there are also "virgins"
aplenty! The seeming abundance of oral sex and rela
tive dearth of intercourse befuddles Roxy, who won
ders if virginity has gone the way of the eight-track and
the rotary phone. Is virginity obsolete?
Let's consider your friend, the "everything but"
girl; hell, odds are you're one yourself. She is the girl
who will give blow jobs, loves to be eaten out, but will
not engage in sexual intercourse and calls herself a vir
gin. To a lesser degree, "everything but" guys exist at
Stanford as well.
Are these individuals delusional or what? How can
virginity mean so much when head is no big deal? Ms.

Sass contends that head
is a Big Fucking Deal. In
the olden days, oral sex
was more taboo than tra
ditional sex. It wasn't
practiced unless a cou
ple was married, and it
was certainly never
widely discussed. Thank
God those days are over!
But don't be foolish
enough to think that the
social acceptability of head
makes it less intimate
or personal. '

Ladies, just think: When
you are being eaten out, his
tongue is physically inside
your body, only a few inches
away from your small intes
tine. And fellows, when a girl
goes down on you her teeth
are precariously close to
your manhood, requiring a
considerable amount of

trust.
Suction is involved, cum
will likely end up lining youi

stomach, a dubious stickiness
tangles your disheveled hair, wet
naps are passed around — this is

no minor affair.
Don't misinterpret the moral of

this story: It's not that the role of oral sex
in a hook up should be diminished, but
rather that intercourse ought to be

knocked off its high horse. Being a vir
gin is a fine choice if that's what you

believe is best for you, but don't
dupe yourself into thinking sex

is a sacred act
while pulling

Lewinskys

left and
right is nothing special.

Technicalities do

not define vir
ginity. Losing

your virginity means you are allowing your sexual in
nocence to be taken; it's a willing violation of the
body; it's succumbing to the desires of the flesh.

The significance of virginity has been under
mined by the prevalence of oral sex, blurring
the boundaries that once firmly established
its classification. If you need evidence of

this phenomenon, think back to
1998 when the muddled defini
tion of sex sent President Clinton
to trial.

Don't let your sex life be
bogged down by rhetoric! If
you are giving or receiving
head, you have a sex life
whether or not you'd like to
admit it. For most people, in
tercourse is even more plea
surable than oral sex and is

often safer since many
more people tend to use
protection.
So this weekend,
give your hook up buddy
a call, show him or her
this article, and get off
third base already. It's
time to de-virginize this
campus once and for all!
