Now that some time has passed in the
new quarter, and yon realized that you
didn't really want to come back to school
as much as you imagined, and your
dreams of being the most talented com
puter science student in the department
have faded into dust, you need some es
capist entertainment.
You need some fucked-up, surrealistic
theatre written by the people you saw at a

Original Winter One Acts.
The Ram's Head Theatrical Society
started accepting student-written scripts
for consideration early last quarter. Out of
the many submissions they received, they
chose "Enron Mad Libs" by Ginger Turn
er, "Moriah" by Tim Youker and"The
Cause Demands It" by Brian Larson to be
performed. Student directors and actors
were chosen and work on the one acts
began soon after.
"Enron Mad Libs," directed by Jamie
Poskin, is an absurdist comedy about gen

play, as expected.
"Moriah," directed by Meghan Dunn,
is a drama about a priest implicated in the
murder of a young boy. Much of play is in
fluenced by recent events involving the
Catholic Church, but also by writer Tim
Youker's roots in Protestantism.
"The Cause Demands It," directed by
Ajani Husbands, is a play about Amiri
Baraka, the controversial poet. It explores
the fragmented selves of Amiri Baraka (as,
alternately, "Leroi Jones," "Black Man"
and "Amiri Baraka"), and Baraka's strug

gle to understand and establish himself as
a black man totally separate from white so
ciety. The play is inspired by the works of
Baraka, as well as Adrienne Kennedy's
"Funnyhouse of a Negro."
