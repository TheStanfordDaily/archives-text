Today kicks off the University's
annual King Week, a celebration in
memory of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. The Black Community
Sei-vices Center, led by Director Jan
Barker-Alexander, and the King
Papers Project have teamed up to
present a series of educational and
entertaining events to commemo
rate die principles King represent
ed during his lifetime.
The festivities will begin today at
2 p.m. with the King Papers Project
Open House. The project offers ex
hibits on King chronology, tran
scripts of his correspondences, and
notable speeches and sermons.
This year, the open house exhibits
will also include childhood pho
tographs of King, a 1957 Valen
tine's Day card King sent to his fu

ture wife, Coretta Scott King, and a
letter addressed to King from fel
low civil rights leader Malcolm X.
"The Papers Project hosts an
open house to give the Stanford
community and others the oppor
tunity to learn more about Martin
Luther King, the man and the
leader, and the work that we are

doing to preserve his legacy," said
Tenisha Armstrong, assistant editor
at the Papers Project.
"The papers allow ordinary peo
ple to read the stuff that history is
written from, and to make their
own judgments about history," said
Susan Englander, also an assistant
editor at the Papers Project.

The weekend celebration will
continue on Sunday at Memorial
Church, where a special service will
be held in tribute to King's life. The
service will be led by Dean for Reli
gious Life Scotty McLennan and
the Stanford Gospel Choir.
Monday will mark the 17th an
niversary of the Bay Area's annual
Freedom Train Teach-in. The
Freedom Train will make its way
from San Jose to San Francisco.
During the ride, Stanford stu
dents and faculty will present infor
mation sessions about King's life
and cause. The Freedom Train
Teach-in is a joint effort between
CalTrain and the Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. Association of
Santa Clara Valley.
"This event will hopefully make
people aware of what Dr. King

stood for, the dream," said Elbert
Reed, chairman of the board of the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Associa
tion. "It is a day of celebration."
"We realized it's 51 miles from
the San Jose train station to the San
Francisco station, the same distance
as the Selma-Montgomery march,"
Reed said, referring to the famous
march in 1965 during which King
led 25,000 people in peaceful
protest.
Other events taking place
throughout the week include a
birthday party held in honor of
King and a lecture addressing the
development of the country since
the Civil Rights Movement in light
of the recent creation of the De
partment of Homeland Security.
In addition, there will be a screen
ing of "Brother Outsider: The
Life of Bayard Rustin," a docu
mentary film evaluating the early
civil rights leaders and the origin
of nonviolent direct action, the
method King adopted as his lead
ing strategy.
Although King Week has at
tracted many participants in previ
ous years, the coordinators would
like to see greater turnouts at
lower-profile events.
"While I would like to see more

students and people from the com
munity attend these events, [I
hope] those that do [attend] are
truly touched and changed by the
programs," Armstrong said. "If we
can't have a big turnout, I would
settle fora few individuals that
walked away with a renewed sense
of life and a greater appreciation of
history."
Armstrong and her colleagues
view King Week as an opportunity
for people to become acquainted
not only with King as a historical
leader and activist, but also as a
normal person, living life day to
day.
"Many of his friends and associ
ates say that King was funny and
had a contagious laugh. These are
but a few things that we don't get
from seeing King give the 'I Have A
Dream' speech," Armstrong said.
Still others at the BCSC and the
Papers Project see the commemo
ration as an opportunity to educate
students and other members of the
community about the principles
and values that King stood for, es
pecially in comparison with con
temporary ideals.
"This country today is needing a
leader committed to nonviolence,"
said Stewart Walker, a research as
sistant at the Papers Project.
"Hopefully this project will help
guide future leaders in the right di
rection of love and nonviolent di
rect action."
