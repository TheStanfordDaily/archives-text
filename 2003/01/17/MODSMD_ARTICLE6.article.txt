# Film studies among new H & S initiatives
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a flurry of new programs
ranging from film studies to Islam
ic studies and the expansion of the
Stanford Institute for Theoretical
Physics, the School of Humanities
and Sciences is undergoing a peri
od of rapid growth.
Currently, Stanford offers an
undergraduate minor in film stud
ies through the Art Department.
By the end of the academic year,
the school plans to have outlined
an authentic film program, includ
ing graduate studies.
"Film is the novel of the fu
ture, and we want people who
can think about it and teach
about it," said Assoc. Dean of De
velopment Rob Franklin, who is
directly involved in the continual
search for funding for this pro

grams and others.
"The study of film works very
well on an undergraduate level
because it synthesizes so much
from other arts and other forms
of expression, including litera
ture and narrative," said Scott
Bukatman, who was hired by
Stanford in 1997 to help develop
a film studies program. Bukat
man earned a doctorate in cine
ma studies from New York Uni
versity in 1992.
"The principal focus will be on
the history of film, film criticism
and the understanding of film as a
medium of cultural expression,"
Franklin said.
"The plans include more cours
es on the history of film, different
national film traditions, film analy
sis and some courses on filmmak

ing," Franklin added. The budget
also includes money for screening
rooms, new classrooms, some film
equipment and a modest film
archive.
Gregg spearheads Islamic
studies effort
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
Gregg is heading the drive to es
tablish an Islamic studies program
within the school.
"We have gathered support for
a program in Islamic studies which

will pull together and coordinate
the effort of the several faculty at
Stanford whose research and
teaching involve aspects of Islamic
history, culture, literature, etc.,"
Gregg said.
Stanford currently has no pro
fessor teaching Islam in the Reli
gious Studies Department. The
establishment of the new Islamic
studies program includes funds
to hire two new faculty members,
including an Islamic scholar in
the Religious Studies Depart
ment.
Gregg envisions a program
which will include "graduate and
undergraduate courses and re
search programs, conferences and

public lectures and colloquia," and
projects in conjunction with other
entities such as the Law School or
the Institute for International
Studies.
Physics institute expanding
The school has also made
progress with the expansion of the
Stanford Institute for Theoretical
Physics. Involved in the study of
high-energy and condensed-mat
ter theoretical physics, SITP re
cently began to invite a large num
ber of visitors and to hire postdoc
toral fellows.
"This dramatic increase in ac
tivity has resulted in a qualitative
change in the intensity of intellec

tual life here," said Physics Prof.
Stephen Shenker, a string theory
expert, who runs SITP.
Funded in part by a $7.5 million
grant from the Kavli Foundation,
the school has also announced the
development of the Kavli Institute
for Particle Astrophysics and Cos
mology. The new institute, in con
junction with SITP, will expand
studies "into the overlap between
cosmology — the history of the
universe — and quantum gravity,
which must become crucially im
portant during the very earliest
times," Shenker said. "Taken to
gether, these resources will make
Stanford a world leader at this in
tellectual frontier."
