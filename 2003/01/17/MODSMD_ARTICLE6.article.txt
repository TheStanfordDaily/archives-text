## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a flurry of new programs
ranging from film studies to Islam
ic studies and the expansion of the
Stanford Institute for Theoretical
Physics, the School of Humanities
and Sciences is undergoing a peri
od of rapid growth.
Currently, Stanford offers an
undergraduate minor in film stud
ies through the Art Department.
By the end of the academic year,
the school plans to have outlined
an authentic film program, includ
ing graduate studies.
"Film is the novel of the fu
ture, and we want people who
can think about it and teach
about it," said Assoc. Dean of De
velopment Rob Franklin, who is
directly involved in the continual
search for funding for this pro

grams and others.
"The study of film works very
well on an undergraduate level
because it synthesizes so much
from other arts and other forms
of expression, including litera
ture and narrative," said Scott
Bukatman, who was hired by
Stanford in 1997 to help develop
a film studies program. Bukat
man earned a doctorate in cine
ma studies from New York Uni
versity in 1992.
"The principal focus will be on
the history of film, film criticism
and the understanding of film as a
medium of cultural expression,"
Franklin said.
"The plans include more cours
es on the history of film, different
national film traditions, film analy
sis and some courses on filmmak
