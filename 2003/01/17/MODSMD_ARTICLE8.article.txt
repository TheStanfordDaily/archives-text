Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, but
according to Gavin Menzies, author of "1421:
The Year China Discovered America,"the Chi
nese had preceded the Europeans in discover
ing the Americas by 70 years.
During a lecture last night in Cubberley Au
ditorium, Menzies, a retired Royal Navy Com
manding Officer, asserted that the Chinese
were the first to circumnavigate the world, set
tling in India, Africa, Australia, Malaysia and
the Americas in the years 1421-23.
Menzies was invited to speak by the Stanford
Center for East Asian Studies and the nonprof
it Silkroad Foundation. The co-sponsors invit
ed Menzies not to promote his book or advo
cate his belief, but to offer an opportunity for
the audience to listen to and question his hy
pothesis that the Chinese navigated the world
in 1421.
Menzies joined the navy at 15 and did not
become interested in writing and research until
after he retired from the fleet. He first became
fascinated in Chinese maritime activity during
the years 1421-23 while researching the events
around the world during this eventful time pe
riod, when he came across various charts that
suggested that the Chinese had explored the
world before the first Europeans.
China had an enormous fleet of ships of
great size and technological development dur
ing the 15th century. The fleet made various
voyages, including one in the year 1421, and is
known to have reached the coast of Africa and
Ceylon. Menzies has posed the possibility that
Chinese ships continued and made settlements
in the Americas.
Based on charts of the world drawn up prior
to Christopher Columbus' voyage and accounts
of later explorers, Menzies claims to have 35
strands of evidence that support the claim that
the Chinese reached the Americas first.

For example, Menzies noted that when Eu
ropeans did arrive in the Americas, they re
counted seeing chickens that bore distinctive
qualities of Chinese ones, rice that at (he time
was indigenous to China, and paintings of Chi
nese on cavalry. Descriptions of people that the
explorers found in various locations in North
America indicate that they encountered Chi
nese people already living on the land.
"The evidence, in my opinion, makes it inar
guable that Chinese were in the Americas be
fore Europeans," Menzies said.

However, according to Emeritus Prof. Al
Dien, who is affiliated with both the Center for
East Asian Studies and the Silkroad Founda
tion, "None of this has been proven, but should
be taken in a spirit of adventure and 'what if.' "
Dien lamented that Menzies did not distin
guish enough between what is indisputable and
what is hypothetical. Dien is worried that if peo
ple are skeptical about the argument that the
Chinese continued past Ceylon and on to the
Americas, they will also reject the established ev
idence of Chinese maritime size and greatness.
