# University's alcohol abuse policy explained

"/ first got drunk at a party in
boarding school," one Stanford stu
dent said. "Several years later, I dis
covered that I was addicted to alco
hol. "
At Stanford, once it is deter
mined that a student is suffering
from alcoholism, the student is
suspended from the University
by the judicial panel and is al
lowed to return only after hav
ing received professional treat
ment.
Policies regarding alcohol
and substance abuse are derived
from the Fundamental Stan
dard. The misuse of alcohol and
controlled substances is subject
to disciplinary action.
According to the Stanford
Bulletin, "It is the policy of the
University to maintain a drug
free workplace and campus."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "We have had cases in
which the University has placed
a student on an Administrative
Hold. This means they are sepa
rated from the University —
losing all the rights and privi
leges afforded a Stanford stu
dent as a result of behavior on
their part which has compro
mised their health and safety, as
well as possibly others in the
Stanford community. Such a
case can involve a student abus
ing alcohol."
The lead alcohol and drug

educator at Stanford, Ralph J.
Castro, said, "The number one
problem I see at Stanford in re
gard to alcohol and drugs is the
excessive misuse of alcohol, in
particular hard liquor."
"One reason, 1 believe, is that
students treat hard liquor the
same as beer and wine and con
sume at the same rate and quan
tity. The übiquitous red cup full
of beer has about 0.63 ounces of
pure alcohol. That same red cup
filled with half hard alcohol and
half mixer has about 3.2 ounces
of pure alcohol — nearly five
times more," Castro added.
"As I continued drinking, my tol
erance to alcohol began to grow.
Eventwjlly, I started binge drinking.
I knew that I was an alcoholic when
I continued to seriously drink for
days at a time," said the student who
admitted to having suffered from al
coholism.
"I was being moody, irritable and
unable to get good grades. Ultimate
ly, I had to go to detox more than once
because my life was in danger. ALso,
it got to the point where a judicial
panel suspended me from the Uni
versity, " the student added.
Once a student is placed on
an Administrative Hold, he or
she would have to petition the
dean of students to be allowed to
come back to Stanford, accord
ing to Wais.
"As a part of the process, they
would have to demonstrate they
have received professional treat
ment," Wais said. "If the student
demonstrated their preparedness
to return to Stanford in part by at
tending Alcoholics Anonymous, the
University, as part of its agreement
to let a student come back, may di
rect him or her to continue in AA to
support his / her successful return."
"/ guess that the best thing tluit AA
does is to confirm that your worst fears
about what alcohol can do is true. I
luwe heard all kinds of stories and do
not wish to be one of them," the student
said.
"Many alcoholics have benefit
ed from AA, and I believe that it is
a valid and effective intervention
strategy for some," Castro said.
At Stanford, several initiatives
are being taken to address alcohol
and substance abuse.
"Educational interventions and
education are on-going. For in
stance, in the past few years we
have done much work on educat
ing students on alcohol poison
ing," Castro said.
"Also, we initiated an Alcohol
Education Seminar for students
who have had an alcohol-related
problem on campus. Other steps
we have taken include subsidizing
fruit smoothies at parties to en
hance the use and availability of
EANABs, equally attractive non-al
coholic beverages," Castro added.
Counseling and Psychological
Services offers workshops and
support groups such as "My
Friend Drinks Too Much," and
"Staying Sober: A Support Group
for Students in Recovery." AA
meetings are held twice weekly at
many locations near campus. For
