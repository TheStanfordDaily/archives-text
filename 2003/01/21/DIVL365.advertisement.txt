Patricia Stephens Due fought for justice during the height of the Civil Rights era, surrendering her very freedom to ensure that the
rights of others might someday be protected. Her daughter, Tananarive, grew up deeply enmeshed in the values of a family
committed to making right whatever they saw as wrong.Together, they have written a paean to the movement-its struggles, its name
less foot-soldiers, and its achievements-and an incisive examination of the future of justice in this country. Their mother-daughter
journey spanning the struggles of two generations is an unforgettable story. Patricia and her husband, civil rights lawyer John Due,
worked tirelessly with many of the movement's greatest figures throughout the sixties to bring about change, particularly in the Deep
Southern state of Florida. Freedom in the Family chronicles these years with fascinating, raw power. Featuring interviews with civil
rights leaders like Black Panther Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Hire) and ordinary citizens whose heroism has been
largely unknown, this is a sweeping, multivoiced account of the battle for civil rights in America. A mother writes so that the civil
liberties she struggled for arc not eroded, so that others will take up the mantle and continue to fight against injustice and discrimi
nation. Her daughter, as part of the integration generation, writes to say thank you, to show the previous generation how very much
they've done and how much better off she is for their effort-despite all the work that remains. Their combined message is remark
able, moving, and important.
