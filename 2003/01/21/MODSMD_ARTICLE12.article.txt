## U.S. fears N. Korea nuke ability 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — North
Korea is capable of expanding its nu
clear arsenal to a half-dozen weapons
within a few years, U.S. intelligence says.
In the longer term, U.S. officials fear a
full-blown nuclear weapon production
line run by the communist country, with
the product available to any govern
ment willing to pay the price.
Central to the issue is how quickly
the North Koreans can produce pluto
nium or enriched uranium, one or the
other of which is necessary to make a
nuclear weapon. North Korea has de
veloped programs on both fronts, ac
cording to the CIA.
The Bush administration's plans to
pursue diplomatic solutions may yet
prevent the North from pursuing its
nuclear ambitions further. Some U.S.
officials have suggested that North
Korea's moves are a bluff, intended not
to make more weapons but to wrest new
economic aid from wealthier nations.
But others say North Korea's covert
nuclear weapons program, discovered
last summer by U.S. intelligence, shows
that the Pyongyang government will try
to expand its nuclear arsenal despite
any agreements not to do so.
North Korea says it does not want to
make new weapons, and U.S. officials
acknowledge that it has yet to take some
key steps necessary to renew produc
tion that was supposed to have been
suspended under a 1994 agreement.
U.S. intelligence estimates that North
Korea can make a nuclear weapon with

between 8.8 pounds and 11 pounds of
plutonium, according to American de
fense officials, speaking on the condition
of anonymity. Such a bomb would have
a yield of around 10 kilotons, meaning
the blast would be equivalent to that
from 10,000 tons of TNT.
The CIA believes North Korea prob
ably already has one or two nuclear
weapons of this class, built with plutoni
um manufactured at a small reactor at
Yongbyon in the late 1980s. North
Korea also has at least four years' accu

mulation of spent fuel that, once
processed, could probably be used to
make four or five more weapons within
a few years, experts say.
The figures suggest the North Kore
ans' bomb designs are slightly more ad
vanced than the bomb the United
States dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, in
1945. That bomb used 13 pounds of
plutonium to produce a roughly 20-
kiloton explosion that killed 70,000
people, said Princeton University pro
fessor Frank von Hippel.
