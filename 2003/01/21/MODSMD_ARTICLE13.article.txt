# Abortion rights case turns 30
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme
Court ruling allowing legal abortions turns 30
years this week, an anniversary heavily shad
owed by speculation that a high court retire
ment could shift the balance of power in abor
tion politics.
For abortion rights supporters, the depar
ture of justice Sandra Day O'Connor would be
most troublesome. For anti-abortion forces,
the wild card could be the exit of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist.
The court is split 5-4 in favor of abortion
rights. O'Connor is considered a cautious sup
porter and the swing vote to uphold Roe v.
Wade, the landmark 1973 case providing for
legal abortions.
Should she retire, President Bush's more
conservative supporters will certainly press
for him to pick a strong anti-abortion nom
inee.
"It's in the greatest danger it's ever been
in," Feminist Majority President Eleanor
Smeal said of the Roe decision. "You're one
vote away."
Smeal cited what she called a White
House track record of picking only pre

sumed abortion foes for federal appeals
courts slots and Bush's campaign pledge to
choose Supreme Court nominees in the
mold of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas. Both have voted to place restric
tions on abortion.
Rehnquist is considered a vote to overturn
Roe, or at least to allow its continued erosion.
A like-minded conservative in his place
would preserve the status quo, but anti-abor
tion activists fear the consequences if Bush
picked a more moderate replacement.
In particular, those opposed to abortion
worry Bush may name a close ally, White
House Counsel Alberto Gonzales.
"For all the pro-life groups Judge Gonzales
is probably a nonstarter as a nominee," said
Richard Lessner, spokesman for the Family
Research Council. He pointed to Gonzales'
vote while a Texas Supreme Court justice to
allow a teenager to get an abortion without
parental consent.
American Life League President Judie
Brown went further.
"It would be absolutely a tragedy if he were
nominated," she said.
