ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — An un
manned U.S. spy plane crashed during a rou
tine surveillance mission near a facility being
used by U.S. troops in southern Pakistan,
Pakistan's Interior Ministry said today.
The small spy plane crashed yesterday
evening near the Jacobabad air base, about
180 miles east of the Afghan border, Iftikhar
Ahmad, spokesman for Pakistan's Interior
Ministry, told The Associated Press.
U.S. experts were investigating to deter
mine the cause of the crash. Spy planes,

called drones, are remote-controlled by sol

"Apparently, the drone crashed because
of a technical fault," Ahmad said.

It is the second time in the last month that
a U.S. spy plane has crashed in Jacobabad.

neighboring .Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001.
