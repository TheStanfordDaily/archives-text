## The 						Stanford Daily University should oppose INS registration process 
### 
Published Since 1891

This month, international students from
several countries began registering at
local Immigration and Naturalization
Service offices, in compliance with a new pro
gram that aims to better track visitors from 25
primarily Arab and Muslim countries. During
this time, the Bechtel International Center has
kept students informed about the registration
process, and the University has supported the
rights of Stanford's international population.
However, while many faculty members have de
nounced the INS registraUon process, the Uni
versity has not yet taken an official stance. We
urge Stanford to speak up against the INS poli
cy and support the privacy of its international
students.
International students make up a third of

Stanford's graduate population, and more
than half of its postdoctoral students come
from foreign countries. In addition, about 5
percent of Stanford undergraduates are not
from the U.S. These students add diversity to
academic discourse, engage in important re
search and earn a valuable education that they
will use to improve the world. Clearly, the in
ternauonal population at Stanford is a sub
stantial part of our community — in sheer size
and in their contributions to the University
and to society. To require these students to un
dergo a special registration process implies
that they are a burden, or even a threat, to the
U.S., which in the vast majority of cases could
not be further from the truth.
Most recendy, hundreds of protesters rallied

against the government mandate at the San
Francisco INS office. Many dissenters, includ
ing San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi,
have likened the process to the internment of
Japanese-Americans after World War 11. Con
gresswoman Anna Eshoo wrote a letter to Attor
ney General John Ashcroft, expressing her con
cern over the detainment of several people last
month and imploring him to "immediately halt
these practices of the INS and engage in a fair
process to individuals." Meanwhile, Stanford of
ficials have remained silent.
At worst, the INS special registraUon require
ment is discriminatory — it singles out students
simply for being from certain countries. At best,
the process is a hassle and an invasion of priva
cy. One student, a junior from Pakistan, report-

Ed spending six hours at the San Jose INS office
— on top of several hours spent at an Atlanta
airport when he first arrived in the U.S. in
September. In an extreme case, six Colorado
students were arrested last month for not taking
enough courses. Stanford is a well-respected in
stitution; it should use its clout to ensure that the
INS treats its students with fairness and respect.
University officials recognize the important role
of internauonal students on campus and have
taken certain steps to protect them. For exam
ple, Stanford has said that it will not release pri
vate student information to the FBI without a
subpoena or court order. We encourage the
University to redouble its efforts to help inter
national students by issuing a statement against
the INS's special registraUon requirement.
