# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## How to get letters of rec without really trying to 
### 
Why am I afraid of my profes
sors? It's infuriating, really.
I've been here for four years
now, and still, the thought of
actually talking to a prof one-on-one and
having to think up smart things to say to
them makes me go all ishy.
It's hard to see profs as human beings,
you know? I live on the Row, so I'll be sit
ting on the porch having a smoke, and

these old people will bike
by to the Faculty Ghetto.
And for two seconds, I'll
be like, "Damn, who let
the old people in?" Then
two seconds later, I'll be
like,.. Oh."
That old dude with the
helmet and the wacky flu
orescent velcro leg band is

probably one of the finest minds in the
country on, I dunno, quantum mechanics
or something.
The worst part of it is that 99 percent of
professors are actually incredibly nice peo
ple who are totally interested in your aca
demic development and excited about their
field and stuff. So I'll go into office hours,

and they'll be all warm and welcoming, and
I'll make a couple of vowel sounds and then
try to crawl under the table.
Last week, I went into office hours basi
cally for the purpose of trying to weasel a let
ter of recommendation. So I had this prof
read some of my stuff, and we had this nice
conversation, and she was really helpful.
Then came the moment for me to "pop the
question," as it were.
"So, are you applying this year?" she said
brighdy.
"Um, next year actually."
"But you probably want to have all your
application materials ready before you leave
Stanford, right? Get your ducks all lined up
in a row."
"Oh yeah, what you said." Awkward
pause. I play this scene like a movie in my
head, over and over, and in hindsight I re
alize that this would have been the appro
priate moment for me to do some groveling.
Instead, this is what happened:
"So, do you know who your recom
menders are?" she asked helpfully. Of
course at this moment I'm like, "Crap.


Lillian Ho
Crappity crap crap crap. Do I ask now? Is
this the big moment?" And of course, I fold
ed like a deck of cards.
"Urn. Um. Um. Ah, yes, in fact I do! Yes,
yes, I have recommenders all lined up like
dominoes, or rather, um, you know, ducks,
um..." Crap. Crap, crap, crap!
Luckily, she took pity on me. She gave
me this cute, confused look and said, "Well,
did you show this to me fora reason?" re
ferring to the papers I gave her to read. "I
mean, did you just want my input 0r...?"
So she's going to write me a recommen
dation. Thank God.
Whenever I was younger and I pictured
myself at college, I always had this romanti
cized image of me at a cafe with a bunch of

cool, intellectual people talking about phi
losophy, maybe with one of our professors
presiding over the conversation like Bill
Malier on "Politically Incorrect." Only not
as sarcastic.
But I go into section or some kind of So
cratic discussion, and I spend the whole
time tiying to make myself invisible. Like if
I keep my mouth shut, then I don't have to
reveal what a huge idiot I am.
It's like when you go back home for
Thanksgiving one year and all of a sudden,
you're at the grown-up's table. So you sit
there with your back straight in the dress
your mother picked out for you, a pretty
plastic smile plastered on your face, and ev
eryone's talking about grown-up things.
Like world politics, or local gossip, or how
the economy's going to affect the store. And
you just sit there, thinking to yourself, "I
don't belong here."
I'm guessing that's the "why." That's why
I'm afraid of my profs, because I secredy

don't think I'm smart enough to be here, in
their distinguished company. I've been here
going on four years, and still I have these
doubts.
But then, every once in a while, I come
out of class or section or office hours, and
I just feel warm inside. Maybe it'll be be
cause I felt like I really, really learned
something that day, or a prof will have
given me the proverbial pat on the back
fora particularly insightful comment,
and I'll be like, "She likes me! She really
likes me!"
Maybe I don't belong here. I realized
quite early on that I'm not an academic; I'm
not a true scholar; if anything, I'm only
somewhat bright. But it's moments like
these that make it worthwhile.
