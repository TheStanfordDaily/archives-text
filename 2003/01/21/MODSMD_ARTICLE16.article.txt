# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## How to get letters of rec without really trying to 
### 
Why am I afraid of my profes
sors? It's infuriating, really.
I've been here for four years
now, and still, the thought of
actually talking to a prof one-on-one and
having to think up smart things to say to
them makes me go all ishy.
It's hard to see profs as human beings,
you know? I live on the Row, so I'll be sit
ting on the porch having a smoke, and

these old people will bike
by to the Faculty Ghetto.
And for two seconds, I'll
be like, "Damn, who let
the old people in?" Then
two seconds later, I'll be
like,.. Oh."
That old dude with the
helmet and the wacky flu
orescent velcro leg band is

probably one of the finest minds in the
country on, I dunno, quantum mechanics
or something.
The worst part of it is that 99 percent of
professors are actually incredibly nice peo
ple who are totally interested in your aca
demic development and excited about their
field and stuff. So I'll go into office hours,

and they'll be all warm and welcoming, and
I'll make a couple of vowel sounds and then
try to crawl under the table.
Last week, I went into office hours basi
cally for the purpose of trying to weasel a let
ter of recommendation. So I had this prof
read some of my stuff, and we had this nice
conversation, and she was really helpful.
Then came the moment for me to "pop the
question," as it were.
"So, are you applying this year?" she said
brighdy.
"Um, next year actually."
"But you probably want to have all your
application materials ready before you leave
Stanford, right? Get your ducks all lined up
in a row."
"Oh yeah, what you said." Awkward
pause. I play this scene like a movie in my
head, over and over, and in hindsight I re
alize that this would have been the appro
priate moment for me to do some groveling.
Instead, this is what happened:
"So, do you know who your recom
menders are?" she asked helpfully. Of
course at this moment I'm like, "Crap.
