# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Sunday morning 
### 
What's there to do on a Satur
day night? That's the ques
tion my dorm's asking itself
a day after my next door
neighbor was sent to the hospital. I think
it's started to sink in that maybe drinking
ourselves into a fog of amnesia every
weekend isn't the best idea.
Once again I'm forced to wonder, why
do we drink? My whole dorm has now
seen, repeatedly, how destructive it is.
This isn't the first time we've seen the
paramedics in our midst, and it probably

won't be the last. It's not
such a great high.
It was also male stu
pidity. Two guys started
boasting, and then they
had to prove themselves,
with lots and lots of alco
hol. So much so, my
friend doesn't remem
ber the cupful that

knocked him down for the count, and that
everyone told him not to drink.
So it seems that there were no parties
Saturday night. I don't know if that's true
or not — I've never kept up with the party
scene — maybe it's a collective hallucina
tion on the part of my dorm, because we're
trying to remind ourselves that there are
other things to do. If we don't see the par

ties, we can't drink at the parties.
But what else is there to do on a Satur
day night? This is the fundamental ques
tion of every Stanford student's existence,
and we need to confront it, because the
drinking thing just isn't working any
more. People are watching movies and
playing card games and starting up ping
pong tournaments, but still asking, "Is this
all there is to do?"
Is there?
There's a question underneath all this
that we're not asking: What do we want
out of college? We want to feel grown up,
but protected. That's why parties are per
fect; we're drinking like grown ups, and
hooking up like grown ups, but know that
our dorm is within walking distance, and
our friends and RAs are nearby.
All of the drama in my dorm happened
while I was away in Palo Alto, finding
something to do on a Friday night — I
went and saw "Casablanca." I'd seen it be
fore, but for six bucks it was a bargain, and
a good way to kill the night. Should I real
ly need to concern myself with killing
every night? I'd like to say I want to make
the most of it — read a book, learn a lan
guage, make some money — but that's not
true. I want to have fun, I want to spend
