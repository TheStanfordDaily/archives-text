# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Sunday morning 
### 
What's there to do on a Satur
day night? That's the ques
tion my dorm's asking itself
a day after my next door
neighbor was sent to the hospital. I think
it's started to sink in that maybe drinking
ourselves into a fog of amnesia every
weekend isn't the best idea.
Once again I'm forced to wonder, why
do we drink? My whole dorm has now
seen, repeatedly, how destructive it is.
This isn't the first time we've seen the
paramedics in our midst, and it probably

won't be the last. It's not
such a great high.
It was also male stu
pidity. Two guys started
boasting, and then they
had to prove themselves,
with lots and lots of alco
hol. So much so, my
friend doesn't remem
ber the cupful that

knocked him down for the count, and that
everyone told him not to drink.
So it seems that there were no parties
Saturday night. I don't know if that's true
or not — I've never kept up with the party
scene — maybe it's a collective hallucina
tion on the part of my dorm, because we're
trying to remind ourselves that there are
other things to do. If we don't see the par

ties, we can't drink at the parties.
But what else is there to do on a Satur
day night? This is the fundamental ques
tion of every Stanford student's existence,
and we need to confront it, because the
drinking thing just isn't working any
more. People are watching movies and
playing card games and starting up ping
pong tournaments, but still asking, "Is this
all there is to do?"
Is there?
There's a question underneath all this
that we're not asking: What do we want
out of college? We want to feel grown up,
but protected. That's why parties are per
fect; we're drinking like grown ups, and
hooking up like grown ups, but know that
our dorm is within walking distance, and
our friends and RAs are nearby.
All of the drama in my dorm happened
while I was away in Palo Alto, finding
something to do on a Friday night — I
went and saw "Casablanca." I'd seen it be
fore, but for six bucks it was a bargain, and
a good way to kill the night. Should I real
ly need to concern myself with killing
every night? I'd like to say I want to make
the most of it — read a book, learn a lan
guage, make some money — but that's not
true. I want to have fun, I want to spend


David Blacfcman
quality time with people whose company I
enjoy. It shouldn't be such a chore and
such a bore to not party.
"Casablanca" and the rest of the past
hundred years of pop culture has taught
us that when there's no one else to turn to,
there's alcohol. Rick spends the entire
movie drowning his sorrows in gin and
scotch and looking cool doing it (and on a
sidenote, dangling a cigarette in such a
way that I want to run out and pick up a 2-
pack-a-day habit immediately, but I'm not
preaching against that vice, so I'll let it
slide). In real life, booze isn't such a great
companion.
At least my very drunken friend had
good friends around him, who didn't leave
him on the porch of a frat house. He's
thankful to have learned who he can trust;
it's the only positive thing he could draw
from the whole experience, but for every
one else, the question is: When do I find
my friends? Where do I find my friends?
Where are the people like me, who I ex
pected to meet by going to Stanford?
Why are we all having such a crisis of
confidence?
I think the problem is winter break.
I'm calling for it to be abolished. We all go
home, and see our old friends and our old
school, even if we now hate them, and re
member how nice it was to have history —
they're still friends with whom you don't
need to fill in the backstory because they
were there for it, or heard it before, and

the school didn't surprise you with classes
in the geology library that required the
aid of a 4-color map. We remember how
comfortable our old bed is (even if it's got
a 14- year-old mattress with busted
springs that your parents have been of
fering to replace for years and years), and
how nice it is to shower without wearing
flip-flops or worrying about meningitis.
And then we come back here, to unfor
giving I-Hum choices and friends who
we've only known fora few months, and
there isn't the first-quarter optimism and
newness to make us gloss over our fears of
being alone.
The desperation of winter quarter is
making people do stupid things like hook
up w.ch sketchy stalkers and ex-girlfriends
(and boyfriends), going so far as to bus and
plane them in from hundreds of miles
away. Maybe everyone has it in the back of
their minds that Valentine's Day is only a
few weeks away. I'm calling for the abol
ishment of that too. Pretty soon we're
gonna need to enter into the drama of the
dreaded Draw. It's time to play all my
cards and see who my real friends are, and
who wants to volunteer to spend a year liv
ing with my neurosis.
This is the fun of winter quarter.
As for the guy who went to the hospital,
he's fine, and so is the guy who he beat in
the drinking contest, who puked first. The
one who spent the night with an IV in his
arm claims he's never going to drink again;
his competitor went out partying tonight.

while I was away in Palo Alto, finding
something to do on a Friday night — I
went and saw "Casablanca." I'd seen it be
fore, but for six bucks it was a bargain, and
a good way to kill the night. Should I real
ly need to concern myself with killing
every night? I'd like to say I want to make
the most of it — read a book, learn a lan
guage, make some money — but that's not
true. I want to have fun, I want to spend

quality time with people whose company I
enjoy. It shouldn't be such a chore and
such a bore to not party.
"Casablanca" and the rest of the past
hundred years of pop culture has taught
us that when there's no one else to turn to,
there's alcohol. Rick spends the entire
movie drowning his sorrows in gin and
scotch and looking cool doing it (and on a
sidenote, dangling a cigarette in such a
way that I want to run out and pick up a 2-
pack-a-day habit immediately, but I'm not
preaching against that vice, so I'll let it
slide). In real life, booze isn't such a great
companion.
At least my very drunken friend had
good friends around him, who didn't leave
him on the porch of a frat house. He's
thankful to have learned who he can trust;
it's the only positive thing he could draw
from the whole experience, but for every
one else, the question is: When do I find
my friends? Where do I find my friends?
Where are the people like me, who I ex
pected to meet by going to Stanford?
Why are we all having such a crisis of
confidence?
I think the problem is winter break.
I'm calling for it to be abolished. We all go
home, and see our old friends and our old
school, even if we now hate them, and re
member how nice it was to have history —
they're still friends with whom you don't
need to fill in the backstory because they
were there for it, or heard it before, and

the school didn't surprise you with classes
in the geology library that required the
aid of a 4-color map. We remember how
comfortable our old bed is (even if it's got
a 14- year-old mattress with busted
springs that your parents have been of
fering to replace for years and years), and
how nice it is to shower without wearing
flip-flops or worrying about meningitis.
And then we come back here, to unfor
giving I-Hum choices and friends who
we've only known fora few months, and
there isn't the first-quarter optimism and
newness to make us gloss over our fears of
being alone.
The desperation of winter quarter is
making people do stupid things like hook
up w.ch sketchy stalkers and ex-girlfriends
(and boyfriends), going so far as to bus and
plane them in from hundreds of miles
away. Maybe everyone has it in the back of
their minds that Valentine's Day is only a
few weeks away. I'm calling for the abol
ishment of that too. Pretty soon we're
gonna need to enter into the drama of the
dreaded Draw. It's time to play all my
cards and see who my real friends are, and
who wants to volunteer to spend a year liv
ing with my neurosis.
This is the fun of winter quarter.
As for the guy who went to the hospital,
he's fine, and so is the guy who he beat in
the drinking contest, who puked first. The
one who spent the night with an IV in his
arm claims he's never going to drink again;
his competitor went out partying tonight.

What's there to do on a Satur
day night? That's the ques
tion my dorm's asking itself
a day after my next door
neighbor was sent to the hospital. I think
it's started to sink in that maybe drinking
ourselves into a fog of amnesia every
weekend isn't the best idea.
Once again I'm forced to wonder, why
do we drink? My whole dorm has now
seen, repeatedly, how destructive it is.
This isn't the first time we've seen the
paramedics in our midst, and it probably

won't be the last. It's not
such a great high.
It was also male stu
pidity. Two guys started
boasting, and then they
had to prove themselves,
with lots and lots of alco
hol. So much so, my
friend doesn't remem
ber the cupful that

knocked him down for the count, and that
everyone told him not to drink.
So it seems that there were no parties
Saturday night. I don't know if that's true
or not — I've never kept up with the party
scene — maybe it's a collective hallucina
tion on the part of my dorm, because we're
trying to remind ourselves that there are
other things to do. If we don't see the par

ties, we can't drink at the parties.
But what else is there to do on a Satur
day night? This is the fundamental ques
tion of every Stanford student's existence,
and we need to confront it, because the
drinking thing just isn't working any
more. People are watching movies and
playing card games and starting up ping
pong tournaments, but still asking, "Is this
all there is to do?"
Is there?
There's a question underneath all this
that we're not asking: What do we want
out of college? We want to feel grown up,
but protected. That's why parties are per
fect; we're drinking like grown ups, and
hooking up like grown ups, but know that
our dorm is within walking distance, and
our friends and RAs are nearby.
