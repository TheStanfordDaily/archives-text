Factual errors pervade alcohol
abuse article
The "University's alcohol abuse policy
explained" article that ran on Jan. 17 is
factually incorrect and borders on the out
rageous in its reporting that "once it is de
termined that a student is suffering from
alcoholism, the student is suspended from
the University by the judicial panel and is
only allowed to return after having re
ceived professional treatment."
First, to my knowledge, no judicial
panel has ever suspended a student for al
coholism. Second, to my knowledge, no
judicial panel has ever required a student
to attend AA, and I explicitly informed the
reporter of this fact. Third, my comments
in the story were taken out of context. I in
formed the reporter of how Stanford
treats very isolated cases in which it has to
take administrative action when a stu
dent's behavior (caused by alcoholism or
any other type of medical or psychological
condition) compromises their health and
safety, as well as others in the Stanford
community.
Stanford has a strong record of focus
ing its attention on education and preven
tion of alcohol abuse.

Editor's Note: The Daily would like to apol
ogize for incorrectly reporting on the University
response to alcohol abuse. We umdd like to
thank Dean Marc W'ais for clarifying the errors
in the article.

Infertile couples should look
towara adoption
Rich couples shopping for egg donors
by characteristics is absolutely repug
nant. Rather than provide a loving home

and alternative to life in an orphanage for
one of the countless children waiting to
be adopted, they would prefer to cata
logue shop fora designer baby. The
columnist of Friday's article ("Those who
seek egg donations don't deserve bad
reputation," Jan. 17) claims that selecting
characteristics like tall, blonde and blue
eyed has nothing to do with promoting
an "ideal" race, and that the parents
merely want their child to feel comfort
able by looking like them. Any multiracial
family will tell you this premise is ridicu
lous â€” a child's love is colorblind.
It's the parents who have a problem,
and if they imagine that they won't be able
to attach to a less than "ideal" child, that's
superficial at best and racist at worse. De
ciding to raise a child is not supposed to be
like buying a new SUV. You can't throw
money at it in order to get all the features
you desire. Parenting is a lot more selfless
than that.
It's not about getting; it's about giving
your commitment and unconditional love
to a needy new human being. In my opin
ion, infertile couples should not be think
ing about what kind of baby they want,
they should be thinking, "Where can I
find a baby who needs me?"

ROTC editorial reflects a
'general ignorance'
As the son of a Marine Corps Officer
now deployed to the Middle East, I feel
that the stigma attached to the military is
undeserved and that The Daily's por
trayal of the military is at conuict with
reality.
The disturbing backdrop to the editori
al ("ROTC does not live up to University's
standards," Jan. 17) is the general igno

ranee of current military culture among
the College Republicans, The Daily edito
rial staff and the campus in general. Few
members of the Stanford community are
aware that the military is an institution
genuinely committed to racial diversity
and equal opportunity.
College Republicans would also be sur
prised to learn that although military offi
cers generally vote Republican (when al
lowed to vote at all), many servicemen pri
vately question the moral authority of
non-veterans like President Bush and Sec
retary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to
send them into battle.
\ agree that currently the military is
not as progressive as Stanford is with re
gard to gay members of our community.
However, to criticize the military on such
grounds is counterproductive to reform,
and reflects an ignorance of the past 30
years. Stanford certainly did not even
approach the military's racial diversity
until the last decade. In many respects,
the military remains more racially di
verse than Stanford, and its housing sys
tem is arguably less racially segregated
than any city in the United States, in
cluding the current Stanford campus. All
branches of the service practice affirma
tive action policies that promote minori
ty officers and enlisted men over other
equally qualified candidates. Despite its
conservative nature, I have found the
military community to be more accept
ing of diversity than any of the 12 civilian
communities I inhabited before coming
to Stanford.
I feel that The Daily's editorial was
more of an attempt at scapegoating insti
tutions traditionally viewed as conserva
tive and not an effort to affect positive
change. Furthermore, by trying to ensure
that Stanford students will never have the
opportunity to interact with a member of
the military, it encourages a dangerous
and counterproductive trend. The fact is
that the military has become increasingly
more conservative. In a survey conducted
in the 19705, approximately 80 percent of
military officers identified themselves as
conservative. Now around 96 percent of
military officers identify with conservative
values. The military is no longer a reflec
tion of the American citizenry and will re

main so until the longstanding anti-mili
tary prejudice permeating academia can
be overcome.
Stanford and the ASSU Speaker's Bu
reau could show their commitment to di
versity and invite retired senior military
officers to speak on campus. It is impor
tant that Stanford students learn more
about their military, especially consider
ing the fact that many students wield sig
nificant political and economic power
after leaving the Farm.
