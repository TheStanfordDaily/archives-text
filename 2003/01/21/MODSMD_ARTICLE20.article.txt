# Commemorating a historic Supreme Court case
## Zurcher v. Stanford Daily 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Twenty-five years ago last Friday, the na
tion's eye turned to Stanford as the case Zurcher
v. Stanford Daily was argued in the Supreme
Court.
The decision, which The Daily lost, estab
lished a precedent that allowed police to search
newspapers and other innocent third parties in
order to obtain evidence about a crime.
The case arose following the dismissal of an
African-American janitor and a Chicano neuro
surgeon, which sparked a violent protest at the
Stanford Hospital on April 9,1971. A Daily pho
tographer took photographs at the protest that
were subsequently published in the paper.
On April 12, police chief James Zurcher ob
tained a search warrant and raided The Daily's
offices, looking for unpublished pictures and
negatives that the police believed Daily photog
raphers had taken at the protest.
During the search, the police looked through
the trash can, paper files, negative files, financial
records, reporters' notes, phone lists, calendars
and other personal belongings. The Daily's
managing editor at that time, Ed Kohn, who
later became a plaintiff for the case as well as a
lawyer, said that the police glanced at his feder
al income tax returns.

Kohn instructed photographers to take pic
tures of the raid, pictures that have since been
widely distributed.
Felicity Barringer, editor in chief at the
time of the raid, made the ultimate decision
to file the suit on First, Fourth and 14th
Amendment grounds.
"The argument was that a search of a non
suspect third party in a criminal investigation
should be undertaken only as a last resort,"
Barringer said. "The argument adds that this
is especially true when that third party is a
news-gathering organization whose work is
protected by the First Amendment, and whose
work and sources could be compromised in
such a search."
Newspapers across the country donated
money to The Daily to pay for legal fees. They
also filed friend-of-the-court briefs, making ar
guments on The Daily's behalf.
The district court upheld ITie Daily's position,
and Appellate Judge Shirley Hufsteler strongly
affirmed it. However, the Supreme Court, in an
opinion delivered by Byron White, overturned
the lower courts on May 31,1978.
Two years later, Congress passed the Privacy
Protection Act of 1980, which limited some of
the power granted to the police and govern
ment by the Zurcher decision.
Aside from attracting a blitz of attention to

the University, newspapers across the nation,
including The Daily, adopted an editorial poli
cy of destroying photographic evidence after a
story has been published in order to prevent
such searches.
According to Margie Freivogel, who later be
came an editor in chief ofThe Daily, the raid was
of importance because the paper was afraid pro
testers would use violence against their re
porters and photographers.
"Demonstrations at the time had become
somewhat violent," Freivogel said. "Rocks
were frequently thrown and so forth. Daily
staffers had found themselves in the middle of
this already, and our photographers regularly
had to wear helmets to protect against injury.
"We feared our photographers would be
come targets if demonstrators thought their
photos would be used by the police to identify
demonstrators."
In spite of potential danger to reporters
and photographers, Freivogel said The Daily
felt a responsiblity to continue covering such
controversial stories.
"We were committed to printing newswor
thy pictures in the paper regardless of whether
they helped police identify- demonstrators or
not, but we didn't want to have to turn over
negatives of pictures that hadn't been used,"
she said.
