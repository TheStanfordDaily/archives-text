## Powell leads Cardinal women to win over Washington Daugherty; VanDerveer enjoy heralded history, similar success 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As dictated by the unwritten
rules of the coaching sorority,
Tara VanDerveer and June
Daugherty exchanged the usual
pleasantries before the Stanford /
Washington women's basketball
game at Maples Pavilion on Satur
day night.
But. such exchanges between
the current Stanford coach Van-
Derveer and the ex-Stanford assis
tant Daugherty, the current
Washington coach, aren't all that
humdrum.
Every time Stanford and Wash
ington meet, it isn't just a game be
tween two teams. It's a renewal of
a friendship between the two
coaches that dates back all the way
to their playing days.
The year was 1976, and Van-
Derveer was then a savvy senior
guard at Indiana. Meanwhile,
Daugherty — all 6-foot-2-plus of
her — was a green freshman cen
ter starting her career at Ohio
State.
That year, Daugherty got the
first laugh in their long history, as
her Buckeyes ended Van-

Nicole Powell is starting to get that killer look
again.
On a Saturday when Stanford struggled to make
shots from the perimeter, Powell made all of the little
— and big — plays to lead the No. 6 Cardinal (14-1,
6-0 Pacific-10 Conference) to an inspired 77-63 victo
ry over Washington.

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 77, Washington 63

The junior Ail-American had 19 points and 12 re
bounds, a much-needed double-double when the
Cardinal seemed passive and timid in the face of an
experienced Huskies squad (13-3, 5-2).
"Great players are players that can make others
around them better," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "When people are out there, they look
to Nicole and think 'We're not going to lose.' "
Stanford looked to Powell after Washington's Loree
Payne tied the game with a 3-pointer with 13:05 re
maining. From that point, the Cardinal, led by Powell's
nine points, went on a 22-9 run to close the game.
The Huskies got as close as 60-57 with 8:06 re
maining, but a minute later, Powell knocked down
her first trey of the season to give Stanford a 66-57
lead — and enough manageable breathing room to
seal Stanford's ninth-straight victory.
Chelsea Trotter (13 points, 11 rebounds) and T'Nae
Thiel (10, 10) also posted double-doubles for the Car
dinal, which won its 27th straight Pac-10 game.
Stanford almost had four players accomplish the
double-double feat, as sophomore Azella Perryman
finished one rebound short of the mark with 12 points
apd nine boards.
But it was Powell, playing in only her sixth game
since returning from a bulging disc injury, who was
clearly the headliner in this toe-to-toe affair.

The savvy junior held Washington's best player,
Giuliana Mendiola, to only 14 points on 5-of-14
shooting. She utilized her versatility — rebounding
on one end, leading the fast break to the other — to
help quarterback Stanford's effective transition game.
"Nicole just makes them all the better," Washing
ton coach June Daugherty said. "She adds a whole
different dimension."
Despite this, Powell knows she isn't yet at the top of
her game. She had five turnovers and shot only 7-of
-16 from the field, which had the Player of the Year
candidate lamenting that her shot was too "flat."
But just the threat of her going off— as she did at
times Saturday — has been enough to make Stanford
an even stronger team since her return.
"My attitude is to try and pay attention to all the lit
tle things and do everything right out on the floor . .
. because I don't get to practice as much as I'd like,"
Powell said.
The Cardinal, however, had enough trouble with
the Huskies, even with Powell in the lineup.
Showing the poise that can be found on a team with
five seniors, Washington opened the second half with
an 11-0 run to turn an eight-point halftime deficit into
its first lead of the game. The Huskies stuck around for
a few more minutes and forced several lead changes be
fore going ice-cold in the last portion of the game.
"You can't relax against good teams," Powell said.
"When you play them, they play hard all 40 minutes."
Heading into the contest, it seemed everyone had
been talking about the great outside shooting of both
teams, and how Saturday's matchup would really re
semble an old, high-noon Western shootout of sorts.
But all the talk turned out to be just that; neither
team could convert open looks — or any looks, for
that matter — as the two most prolific 3-point-shoot
ing teams combined to go 13-for-53 from beyond the
arc. Each club shot only a miserable 37.9 percent from
the field, adding to the offensive woes.

Junior Nicole Powell attempts to fake out a Washington defender. Powell
recorded a double-double, including a team-leading 19 points, in Stanford's
win over the Huskies.
Derveer's career as a Hoosier with
a 74-57 win in the ALAW Region
al. (The NCAA women's basket
ball tournament wasn't adopted
until 1982).
"I like to remind Tara about
that," Daugherty joked.
But that was just the beginning.
VanDerveer joined the Buck
eyes' staff three years later as an as
sistant coach, and saw the senior
Daugherty firsthand.
"At that time she was a big play
er [in terms of size]," VanDerveer
said. "She scored well, and played
hard and was very unselfish."
Daugherty, in turn, got a
glimpse of the up-and-coming
Coach VanDerveer starting in
1980, when VanDerveer took
over the head position at Ohio
State and Daugherty served as a
graduate assistant. VanDerveer
left the Buckeyes in 1985 for Stan
ford, and brought Daugherty
along with her as an assistant
coach.
Daugherty served on the Farm
from 1985 to 1989, and was instru
mental in helping VanDerveer

create the Stanford juggernaut.
She was a recruiter for Van-
Derveer, and played a big part in
bringing such program corner
stones like Jennifer Azzi to Palo
Alto.
"We had a great opportunity to
bring special players in there that
really believed in Stanford being
able to get it done," Daugherty
said.
Considering her tempera
ment, it's not that surprising she
was so successful bringing kids to
Stanford.
"She's really outgoing and likes
people," VanDerveer explained.
"She works very hard to recruit
and genuinely cares about the
kids."
Stanford went 13-15 and 14-14
during VanDerveer's first two
years on the Farm.
But the Cardinal had its first
breakthrough season in 1988,
when it went 27-5 and reached the
NCAA Sweet 16. The next year,
which would be Daugherty's last as
an assistant, Stanford reached the
Elite Eight with a 28-3 record.
The makings of a basketball
powerhouse were obviously in
place.
"Tara built this program from
the grassroots," Daugherty said.

"People always want to win and
want the quick fix, but Tara did it
the right way.
"It's a great example for any
body in coaching right now."
But Daugherty had ambitions
of her own after learning so much
from the legendary VanDerveer
— she wanted to be a head coach,
too.
And so it was a testament to
VanDerveer's character that she
fully supported her assistant mov
ing on to Boise State in 1989. (Of
course, any diehard Stanford fan
will remember that was the same
year the Cardinal won its first na
tional championship.)
"Tara works hard to make sure
that you are challenged," Daugh
erty said. "It's fortunate I had a
coach who let me work hard to
ward my personal goals."
Ultimately, Daugherty landed
in Seatde in 1996, inheriting a
team feeling burnt after its popu
lar coach Chris Gobrecht (243-89
in 11 years at Washington) jumped
ship for Florida State.
But Daugherty has had similar
success, leading the Huskies to five
NCAA tournament appearances
in six years, including an Elite
Eight appearance in 2001.
It's even more impressive that

she's been able to create her own
identity in Seattle, a city that had
been so enamored with Gobrecht,
who is now the head coach at
Southern California.
"I'm so proud of her," Van-
Derveer said. "She came in after
someone who had been very suc
cessful and has done a really great
job."
Undeniably, Daugherty has
mixed emotions every time she
steps inside Maples Pavilion, the
place where her coaching talents
were cultivated.
"It's always fun to come back
and see a lot of people because
there are great memories," she
said. "But it's always tough because
Stanford is always so good."
Daugherty's Huskies have been
playing the Cardinal tough recent
ly, however.
After losing in her first five tries
against Stanford, Daugherty has
beaten VanDerveer three out of
the last seven times. That's the best
such mark over that span of all the
Pac-10 teams outside of Eugene
(Oregon beat Stanford three times
at McArthur Court in the past four
years).
Daugherty will have her
chance to make it four on Feb. 13
in Seattle.
"We had to win with a bit of a
handicap," VanDerveer said. "We
made up for it by getting on the of
fensive boards."
Make it more like hoarding the
boards.
Stanford grabbed 23 offensive
rebounds and turned them into 16
crucial second-chance points.
Washington, which sorely missed
the injured Kellie Dalan, was out
rebounded 53-26 overall, offset
ting a lot of the stingy defense it
played at times.
"We didn't rebound well, and
it cost us dearly," Daugherty said.
"We need to put a body on a body
and not let them get the easy put
back."
On the flip side, the game was
Stanford's most bruising to date,
and the way VanDerveer's team re
sponded was a welcomed sign in
light of a rugged Southern Califor

nia team looming next weekend in
Los Angeles.
Washington's Payne set a school
record with the 212 th 3-pointer of
her career early in the second halt,
breaking Megan Franza's previous
mark set in 2001.
