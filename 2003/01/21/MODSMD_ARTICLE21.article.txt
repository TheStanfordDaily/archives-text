## Powell leads Cardinal women to win over Washington Daugherty; VanDerveer enjoy heralded history, similar success 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As dictated by the unwritten
rules of the coaching sorority,
Tara VanDerveer and June
Daugherty exchanged the usual
pleasantries before the Stanford /
Washington women's basketball
game at Maples Pavilion on Satur
day night.
But. such exchanges between
the current Stanford coach Van-
Derveer and the ex-Stanford assis
tant Daugherty, the current
Washington coach, aren't all that
humdrum.
Every time Stanford and Wash
ington meet, it isn't just a game be
tween two teams. It's a renewal of
a friendship between the two
coaches that dates back all the way
to their playing days.
The year was 1976, and Van-
Derveer was then a savvy senior
guard at Indiana. Meanwhile,
Daugherty — all 6-foot-2-plus of
her — was a green freshman cen
ter starting her career at Ohio
State.
That year, Daugherty got the
first laugh in their long history, as
her Buckeyes ended Van-

Nicole Powell is starting to get that killer look
again.
On a Saturday when Stanford struggled to make
shots from the perimeter, Powell made all of the little
— and big — plays to lead the No. 6 Cardinal (14-1,
6-0 Pacific-10 Conference) to an inspired 77-63 victo
ry over Washington.

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 77, Washington 63

The junior Ail-American had 19 points and 12 re
bounds, a much-needed double-double when the
Cardinal seemed passive and timid in the face of an
experienced Huskies squad (13-3, 5-2).
"Great players are players that can make others
around them better," Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "When people are out there, they look
to Nicole and think 'We're not going to lose.' "
Stanford looked to Powell after Washington's Loree
Payne tied the game with a 3-pointer with 13:05 re
maining. From that point, the Cardinal, led by Powell's
nine points, went on a 22-9 run to close the game.
The Huskies got as close as 60-57 with 8:06 re
maining, but a minute later, Powell knocked down
her first trey of the season to give Stanford a 66-57
lead — and enough manageable breathing room to
seal Stanford's ninth-straight victory.
Chelsea Trotter (13 points, 11 rebounds) and T'Nae
Thiel (10, 10) also posted double-doubles for the Car
dinal, which won its 27th straight Pac-10 game.
Stanford almost had four players accomplish the
double-double feat, as sophomore Azella Perryman
finished one rebound short of the mark with 12 points
apd nine boards.
But it was Powell, playing in only her sixth game
since returning from a bulging disc injury, who was
clearly the headliner in this toe-to-toe affair.

The savvy junior held Washington's best player,
Giuliana Mendiola, to only 14 points on 5-of-14
shooting. She utilized her versatility — rebounding
on one end, leading the fast break to the other — to
help quarterback Stanford's effective transition game.
"Nicole just makes them all the better," Washing
ton coach June Daugherty said. "She adds a whole
different dimension."
Despite this, Powell knows she isn't yet at the top of
her game. She had five turnovers and shot only 7-of
-16 from the field, which had the Player of the Year
candidate lamenting that her shot was too "flat."
But just the threat of her going off— as she did at
times Saturday — has been enough to make Stanford
an even stronger team since her return.
"My attitude is to try and pay attention to all the lit
tle things and do everything right out on the floor . .
. because I don't get to practice as much as I'd like,"
Powell said.
The Cardinal, however, had enough trouble with
the Huskies, even with Powell in the lineup.
Showing the poise that can be found on a team with
five seniors, Washington opened the second half with
an 11-0 run to turn an eight-point halftime deficit into
its first lead of the game. The Huskies stuck around for
a few more minutes and forced several lead changes be
fore going ice-cold in the last portion of the game.
"You can't relax against good teams," Powell said.
"When you play them, they play hard all 40 minutes."
Heading into the contest, it seemed everyone had
been talking about the great outside shooting of both
teams, and how Saturday's matchup would really re
semble an old, high-noon Western shootout of sorts.
But all the talk turned out to be just that; neither
team could convert open looks — or any looks, for
that matter — as the two most prolific 3-point-shoot
ing teams combined to go 13-for-53 from beyond the
arc. Each club shot only a miserable 37.9 percent from
the field, adding to the offensive woes.
