# Stanford comes up short in Husky territory

### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
SEATTLE — The only prob
lem with living on the edge is the
devastating impact when you finally
fall. Everyone knows that the balanc
ing act can't go on forever, that stum
bles are inevitable.
And sure enough, on Saturday
afternoon, in front of a near-capacity
crowd at Bank of America Arena, the
Stanford men's basketball team
tempted fate one too many times as
it fell 73-68 to unranked Washing-

Men's Basketball
Saturday: Washington 73, Stanford 68

ton (7-8, 2-4 Pacific-10 Conference).
Looking at the stats sheet, howev
er, it's difficult to say why Stanford
didn't pull this one out. The Cardi
nal (12-5, 3-2), despite shooting 5-
for-10 from behind the arc in the
first half and 44 percent from the
field, went into the locker room at
halfiime only up by one point.
And while Stanford committed
11 first-half turnovers, Washington
only managed to capitalize twice,

scoring four points; meanwhile, the
Cardinal translated 12 Husky
turnovers into 13 first-half points.
"[Washington was] quick, but
part of that was our lack of execu
tion," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "A lot of those were
unforced turnovers."
The loss certainly wasn't from
lack of effort or husde. 'Hie Cardinal
consistendy dove for loose balls and
seemed to understand the relative
importance of each rebound, each
possession and getting out of the
state of Washington with two wins.
"[Considering all of the bad
things] I thought our effort was
good," Montgomery said. "We
didn't cave in at all."
Fatigue and mental eirors down
die stretch cost Stanford the game.
Junior shooting guard Matt Lot
tich picked up four fouls early (in
cluding a technical foul in the first
half), which forced him to miss sig
nificant minutes in the second half.
He finished die game with 15 points,
13 of which came in the first half.
Senior point guard Julius Barnes
was whisded for his third foul early in
the second half, leaving sophomore
swingman Josh Childress on the
floor as the Cardinal's main scoring
threat. Childress, who struggled
from the field on 4-of-18 shooting,
ultimately finished with 18 points,
and scored 16 of Stanford's 36 sec
ond-half points.
Considering the overtime
matchup two days earlier against
Washington State — and the short
bench die Cardinal has been forced
to endure because of the injuries to
Chris Hernandez and Justin Davis
and the early departure of Teyo
Johnson — weary legs down the
stretch were not surprising.
Like Thursday's games against
the Cougars, Saturday's outcome

was defined in the game's final min
utes.
With 6:33 left on the clock, Stan
ford tied the game for the 10th time
when Childress scored off of an alley
oop backdoor pass from Barnes to
quiet the crowd.
The Huskies then countered by
going on a 11-4 run to bring their
lead to seven, but Stanford had plen
ty of opportunities to capitalize.
With the Cardinal down by four
with 55 seconds left to play in regu
lation, Childress managed his sec
ond steal of the game, but junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich
couldn't convert on the fast break
opportunity.
Eleven seconds later, out of a
Stanford timeout, Barnes was fouled
by freshman forward Mike Jenson
but only converted one of the two
free throws to cut the Cardinal
deficit to three. On the next trip
down, Childress put 5-foot-9 fresh
man point guard Nate Robinson on
die line, and Robinson extended the
Husky lead to four, making it a two
possession game for Stanford.
Childress and Lottich both
missed 3-pointers before sopho
more forward Nick Robinson hit a
10-footer to bring the Cardinal with
in two with 20.5 seconds left to play.
Stanford then called a timeout to set
up in a full-court press.
Childress immediately fouled
guard Will Conroy once the ball was
inbounded, sending him to the line
to shoot two with Washington in the
double-bonus. Conroy missed the
second free throw, keeping the Car
dinal within three points and allow
ing Stanford 19 seconds to tie the
game.
But Barnes missed a 15-foot fade
away that would have brought the

Men's Basketball
Saturday: Washington 73, Stanford 68

ton (7-8, 2-4 Pacific-10 Conference).
Looking at the stats sheet, howev
er, it's difficult to say why Stanford
didn't pull this one out. The Cardi
nal (12-5, 3-2), despite shooting 5-
for-10 from behind the arc in the
first half and 44 percent from the
field, went into the locker room at
halfiime only up by one point.
And while Stanford committed
11 first-half turnovers, Washington
only managed to capitalize twice,

scoring four points; meanwhile, the
Cardinal translated 12 Husky
turnovers into 13 first-half points.
"[Washington was] quick, but
part of that was our lack of execu
tion," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "A lot of those were
unforced turnovers."
The loss certainly wasn't from
lack of effort or husde. 'Hie Cardinal
consistendy dove for loose balls and
seemed to understand the relative
importance of each rebound, each
possession and getting out of the
state of Washington with two wins.
"[Considering all of the bad
things] I thought our effort was
good," Montgomery said. "We
didn't cave in at all."
Fatigue and mental eirors down
die stretch cost Stanford the game.
Junior shooting guard Matt Lot
tich picked up four fouls early (in
cluding a technical foul in the first
half), which forced him to miss sig
nificant minutes in the second half.
He finished die game with 15 points,
13 of which came in the first half.
Senior point guard Julius Barnes
was whisded for his third foul early in
the second half, leaving sophomore
swingman Josh Childress on the
floor as the Cardinal's main scoring
threat. Childress, who struggled
from the field on 4-of-18 shooting,
ultimately finished with 18 points,
and scored 16 of Stanford's 36 sec
ond-half points.
Considering the overtime
matchup two days earlier against
Washington State — and the short
bench die Cardinal has been forced
to endure because of the injuries to
Chris Hernandez and Justin Davis
and the early departure of Teyo
Johnson — weary legs down the
stretch were not surprising.
Like Thursday's games against
the Cougars, Saturday's outcome

was defined in the game's final min
utes.
With 6:33 left on the clock, Stan
ford tied the game for the 10th time
when Childress scored off of an alley
oop backdoor pass from Barnes to
quiet the crowd.
The Huskies then countered by
going on a 11-4 run to bring their
lead to seven, but Stanford had plen
ty of opportunities to capitalize.
With the Cardinal down by four
with 55 seconds left to play in regu
lation, Childress managed his sec
ond steal of the game, but junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich
couldn't convert on the fast break
opportunity.
Eleven seconds later, out of a
Stanford timeout, Barnes was fouled
by freshman forward Mike Jenson
but only converted one of the two
free throws to cut the Cardinal
deficit to three. On the next trip
down, Childress put 5-foot-9 fresh
man point guard Nate Robinson on
die line, and Robinson extended the
Husky lead to four, making it a two
possession game for Stanford.
Childress and Lottich both
missed 3-pointers before sopho
more forward Nick Robinson hit a
10-footer to bring the Cardinal with
in two with 20.5 seconds left to play.
Stanford then called a timeout to set
up in a full-court press.
Childress immediately fouled
guard Will Conroy once the ball was
inbounded, sending him to the line
to shoot two with Washington in the
double-bonus. Conroy missed the
second free throw, keeping the Car
dinal within three points and allow
ing Stanford 19 seconds to tie the
game.
But Barnes missed a 15-foot fade
away that would have brought the

"I'm very proud of our guys
today — the way they competed,
the way they played, die way they
kept themselves composed
throughout," said Washington head
coach Lorenzo Romar.
"This was a game that we
could've won," said a disappointed
Montgomery. "We've just got to
play better."
Stanford will get the opportunity

to redeem itself this week at home
against die Los Angeles schools.
