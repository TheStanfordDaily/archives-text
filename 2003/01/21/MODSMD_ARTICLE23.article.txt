# Stanford divers find success in Southern Cal
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Led by sophomore Adam Pe
terson, the Cardinal men's diving
team slashed through the compe
tition this weekend at the Bruin
Invitational in Pasadena, placing
all three divers in the top five of
both the 1-meter and 3-meter div
ing events.
The two-day invite featured
divers from Southern California,
UC-Irvine and Stanford.
In the first day of competition
on Friday, Peterson edged USC
diver Ray Vincent to win the 1-

meter event, outscoring his Tro
jan competitor 587.95 to 566.15.
Cardinal senior Gavin Olmstead
took third with 536.10 points,
and sophomore Jeff Durbin
placed fifth for Stanford with
463.05.
"I felt I had a really good meet,"
Peterson said. "I did some new
dives in competition, and they
were feeling pretty good."
On the second day of competi
tion, the Cardinal could not stand
up to IJSC's Vincent. In the 3-
meter event, Vincent finished first
with 516.45 points, followed by
Peterson with 503.85. Olmstead

and Durbin finished fourth and
fifth in the event with 419.15 and
407.40 points, respectively.
With his win, Vincent repeated
an early-season victory over Peter
son. Vincent beat the Cardinal
leader on the 3-meter board in
November at the Trojan Invite.
"Adam had a few small mis
takes on the 3-meter, and he
didn't lose to Vincent by a lot,"
said Stanford head coacfr Rick
Schavone. "Maybe after the Tro
jan Invite I would have said that
Vincent was the better diver, but
Adam proved this weekend that
his dives are dynamic and easy for

him, and Adam truly is the better
diver. If Adam dives as well as
Adam can dive and Vincent dives
as well as Vincent can dive, Adam
can beat him — there's no doubt
about it."
Schavone also added that Pe
terson executed two "huge
twisters," dives that only a few oth
ers in the United States can do.
These dives — a reverse one and a
half flip with three and a half
twists, and a front two and a half
flip with two twists — should make
him a major competitor at the
NCAA Championships in March.
All three Stanford divers left
the invite with certain aspects of
their dives to work on as they head
into upcoming meets against Ari
zona and Arizona State.
While Olmstead needs to im
prove his execution, Durbin plans
to focus on increasing the consis
tency and difficulty of his dives.
"I was a little disappointed with
my performance over the week
end because my mechanics broke

down," Olmstead said. "It defi
nitely gives me something to think
about as we move into the rest of
the season."
Despite the minor mistakes,
though, Schavone feels optimistic
about the remainder of the year.
"Adam was great, Gavin is right
where he needs to be after taking
a year off from the sport, and Jeff
was just outstanding," Schavone
said. "Every time Jeff dives, I am
amazed. He is so competitive even
though he has very little experi
ence in him.
"Our chances of making it to the
NCAA competition are looking
better and better with every meet."
