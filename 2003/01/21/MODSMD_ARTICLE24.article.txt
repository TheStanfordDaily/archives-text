# Wrestling falls twice, wins at Portland St.

### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
A rough weekend in Oregon at
least ended on a high note for the
Stanford wrestling team. The
Cardinal (3-8, 0-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped a pair of dual
meets at Oregon and Oregon
State on Friday before fighting its
way to a 24-20 victory at Portland
State the following day.

"Overall, I'm still disappointed
in the way we're wrestling," Stan
ford head coach Steve Buddie
said. "We faced Oregon teams
that were hungrier and more ag
gressive than we were. We have
wrestlers who continue to make
the same mistakes over and over,
even though we're going over the
techniques in practice.
"Against Portland State, we
looked better, but we still have
many things to change before the
Pac-10 Tournament."
The bright spots for Stanford

were clear, but few. Redshirt
sophomore Matt Gentry and ju
nior Nathan Peterson won three
bouts apiece, and redshirt sopho
more Brad Metzler returned to
the lineup on Saturday to post a
pin in his first action since injuring
his knee in late December.
The weekend was a homecom
ing of sorts for Gentry, a Grants
Pass, Ore., native. Coming off of a
perfect 4-0 showing at the Aggie
Open last Saturday, he outscored
his opponents 24-7 and recorded
nine takedowns in his three victo
ries, bringing his team-leading
win total to 22.
The Cardinal put together its
most complete performance of
the weekend against Portland
State, as five wrestlers earned de
cisions in the come-from-behind
victory.
With Stanford down five points
with two bouts to go, Cardinal
freshman Shawn Ritzenthaler
worked to an 8-0 lead before pin
ning Portland State's Antonio Cri
ado at 4:34. The pin put Stanford
ahead by one point heading into
the final matchup at 125.

ford wrestling team is currently preparing for the upcoming Pacific-10 Con
ference tournament.
Peterson jumped out to a 2-0
lead in the first period of the de
ciding bout, a lead he would not
relinquish in a strong 9-6 decision
to close out the scoring and secure
the Stanford win.
' This weekend, Nathan turned
a very important corner," Buddie
said. "His conditioning and confi
dence resurfaced at a very crucial
time."
The meet started at 133, with
Metzler quickly erasing any no
tion that he would be rusty after
not competing for nearly three
weeks. Metzler opened the scor
ing with a pin against Portland
State's Zac Enoch just 35 seconds
into the bout.
"Having Brad back is also a

blessing," Buddie said. "He really
had a lot of pent-up frustration
from being unable to wrestle for
three weeks. He pinned a very re
spectable wrestler, and he's ready
to continue his season the way he
left off."
Stanford dropped the next two
bouts, one by forfeit, before Gen
try defeated Ryan Thomas at 157
to knot the team score at 9-9.
The Vikings answered with two
more victories by Eric Arbogast
and Quinn Collett to take a 16-9
lead.
A Portland State forfeit at 184
gave Stanford redshirt freshman
Ryan Hagen a win and pulled the
Cardinal to within one at 16-15.
But redshirt freshman Larry
Ozowara then dropped a major
decision at 197, setting the stage
Tor Stanford's dramatic finish.
The Cardinal had less success
earning decisions a day earlier, as

Peterson and Gentry accounted
for all of the Cardinal's scoring in
a 32-6 loss at Oregon and a 35-7
defeat at Oregon State.
Gentry knocked off Oregon's
Branson Phillips 10-4 and scored
a 11-4 decision later that night
against Oregon State's Brian
Duhrkoop.
Peterson needed overtime to
knock off Oregon's Martin
Mitchell 10-5. His win in Stan
ford's loss to the Beavers was also
close. After spotting Michael De
laney a 2-0 lead in the first period,
Peterson battled back and scored a
takedown with 30 seconds re
maining in the bout fora 4-2 vic
tory.
Peterson's 12 wins are tied for
thir3-most on the team.
Oregon, which had three
major decisions and a fall against
Stanford, improved to 4-4 overall
and a perfect 3-0 in the Pac-10,

while Oregon State moved to 6-5
overall and 4-1 in conference.
Although Stanford's struggles
stemmed beyond one weight class,
an injury to lan Bork at 197 before
the weekend forced some last
minute changes to the starting
lineup.
Senior Harold Penson re
turned to the starting spot at 174,
with Hagen bumping up one
weight class to 184. Ozowara, who
previously occupied the 184 spot,
made his first appearance at 197
in place of Bork.
"Two of the best wrestlers at
174 in the Pac-10 are at Oregon
and Oregon State," Hagen said.
Oregon's 174-pounder Shane
Webster is ranked eighth in the
nation and earned a 20-8 decision.

Metzler quickly erasing any no
tion that he would be rusty after
not competing for nearly three
weeks. Metzler opened the scor
ing with a pin against Portland
State's Zac Enoch just 35 seconds
into the bout.
"Having Brad back is also a

blessing," Buddie said. "He really
had a lot of pent-up frustration
from being unable to wrestle for
three weeks. He pinned a very re
spectable wrestler, and he's ready
to continue his season the way he
left off."
Stanford dropped the next two
bouts, one by forfeit, before Gen
try defeated Ryan Thomas at 157
to knot the team score at 9-9.
The Vikings answered with two
more victories by Eric Arbogast
and Quinn Collett to take a 16-9
lead.
A Portland State forfeit at 184
gave Stanford redshirt freshman
Ryan Hagen a win and pulled the
Cardinal to within one at 16-15.
But redshirt freshman Larry
Ozowara then dropped a major
decision at 197, setting the stage
Tor Stanford's dramatic finish.
The Cardinal had less success
earning decisions a day earlier, as

Peterson and Gentry accounted
for all of the Cardinal's scoring in
a 32-6 loss at Oregon and a 35-7
defeat at Oregon State.
Gentry knocked off Oregon's
Branson Phillips 10-4 and scored
a 11-4 decision later that night
against Oregon State's Brian
Duhrkoop.
Peterson needed overtime to
knock off Oregon's Martin
Mitchell 10-5. His win in Stan
ford's loss to the Beavers was also
close. After spotting Michael De
laney a 2-0 lead in the first period,
Peterson battled back and scored a
takedown with 30 seconds re
maining in the bout fora 4-2 vic
tory.
Peterson's 12 wins are tied for
thir3-most on the team.
Oregon, which had three
major decisions and a fall against
Stanford, improved to 4-4 overall
and a perfect 3-0 in the Pac-10,

while Oregon State moved to 6-5
overall and 4-1 in conference.
Although Stanford's struggles
stemmed beyond one weight class,
an injury to lan Bork at 197 before
the weekend forced some last
minute changes to the starting
lineup.
Senior Harold Penson re
turned to the starting spot at 174,
with Hagen bumping up one
weight class to 184. Ozowara, who
previously occupied the 184 spot,
made his first appearance at 197
in place of Bork.
"Two of the best wrestlers at
174 in the Pac-10 are at Oregon
and Oregon State," Hagen said.
Oregon's 174-pounder Shane
Webster is ranked eighth in the
nation and earned a 20-8 decision.
Stanford returns to action on
Sunday at Cal State-Bakersfield
before returning home to battle
Cal Poly on Jan. 31.
A rough weekend in Oregon at
least ended on a high note for the
Stanford wrestling team. The
Cardinal (3-8, 0-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped a pair of dual
meets at Oregon and Oregon
State on Friday before fighting its
way to a 24-20 victory at Portland
State the following day.

"Overall, I'm still disappointed
in the way we're wrestling," Stan
ford head coach Steve Buddie
said. "We faced Oregon teams
that were hungrier and more ag
gressive than we were. We have
wrestlers who continue to make
the same mistakes over and over,
even though we're going over the
techniques in practice.
"Against Portland State, we
looked better, but we still have
many things to change before the
Pac-10 Tournament."
The bright spots for Stanford

were clear, but few. Redshirt
sophomore Matt Gentry and ju
nior Nathan Peterson won three
bouts apiece, and redshirt sopho
more Brad Metzler returned to
the lineup on Saturday to post a
pin in his first action since injuring
his knee in late December.
The weekend was a homecom
ing of sorts for Gentry, a Grants
Pass, Ore., native. Coming off of a
perfect 4-0 showing at the Aggie
Open last Saturday, he outscored
his opponents 24-7 and recorded
nine takedowns in his three victo
ries, bringing his team-leading
win total to 22.
The Cardinal put together its
most complete performance of
the weekend against Portland
State, as five wrestlers earned de
cisions in the come-from-behind
victory.
With Stanford down five points
with two bouts to go, Cardinal
freshman Shawn Ritzenthaler
worked to an 8-0 lead before pin
ning Portland State's Antonio Cri
ado at 4:34. The pin put Stanford
ahead by one point heading into
the final matchup at 125.

ford wrestling team is currently preparing for the upcoming Pacific-10 Con

Peterson jumped out to a 2-0
lead in the first period of the de
ciding bout, a lead he would not
relinquish in a strong 9-6 decision
to close out the scoring and secure
the Stanford win.
' This weekend, Nathan turned
a very important corner," Buddie
