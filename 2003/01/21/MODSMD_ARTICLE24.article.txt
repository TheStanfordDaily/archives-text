### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
A rough weekend in Oregon at
least ended on a high note for the
Stanford wrestling team. The
Cardinal (3-8, 0-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped a pair of dual
meets at Oregon and Oregon
State on Friday before fighting its
way to a 24-20 victory at Portland
State the following day.

"Overall, I'm still disappointed
in the way we're wrestling," Stan
ford head coach Steve Buddie
said. "We faced Oregon teams
that were hungrier and more ag
gressive than we were. We have
wrestlers who continue to make
the same mistakes over and over,
even though we're going over the
techniques in practice.
"Against Portland State, we
looked better, but we still have
many things to change before the
Pac-10 Tournament."
The bright spots for Stanford

were clear, but few. Redshirt
sophomore Matt Gentry and ju
nior Nathan Peterson won three
bouts apiece, and redshirt sopho
more Brad Metzler returned to
the lineup on Saturday to post a
pin in his first action since injuring
his knee in late December.
The weekend was a homecom
ing of sorts for Gentry, a Grants
Pass, Ore., native. Coming off of a
perfect 4-0 showing at the Aggie
Open last Saturday, he outscored
his opponents 24-7 and recorded
nine takedowns in his three victo
ries, bringing his team-leading
win total to 22.
The Cardinal put together its
most complete performance of
the weekend against Portland
State, as five wrestlers earned de
cisions in the come-from-behind
victory.
With Stanford down five points
with two bouts to go, Cardinal
freshman Shawn Ritzenthaler
worked to an 8-0 lead before pin
ning Portland State's Antonio Cri
ado at 4:34. The pin put Stanford
ahead by one point heading into
the final matchup at 125.
