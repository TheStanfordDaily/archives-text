# Sophomore Rosenthal wins 1-meter at invite
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford sophomore diver Ash
lee Rosenthal said that she had the
talent to overtake the top athletes
from Southern California. She
proved it this weekend at the Bruin
Invite in Pasadena, as she cruised
past Trojan star Nicci Fusaro to
claim third place in 3-meter diving,
and captured a win in the 1-meter
competition.
Rosenthal was the only Cardinal
diver to make the finals in Friday's
3-meter competition. Her team
mates, sophomore Lauren Dono
van and freshman Michaela
Skloven, placed 13th and 14th, re
spectively, just missing the final
round.
Rosenthal racked up 466.25
points in the 3-meter competition,
good enough fora third-place finish
behind USC's Blythe Hardey and
UCLA's Regan Gosnell.
Saturday's 1-meter competition
brought Rosenthal her first victory
of the season, as she scored 504.50
combined points.
Despite her placement, Stanford
coach Rick Schavone showed con

cerned about the "relative perfor
mance" of his clivers.
"USC and UCLA didn't dive
their top athletes in the 1-meter,
since they were resting for plat
form," Schavone said.
Skloven also dove well in the 3-
meter competition, picking up
416.15 points and ninth place after
the final round. Skloven closed the
day with a seventh-place finish in
platform diving.
The final results of the meet were
fairly impressive, considering the
opponents that the Cardinal faced.
"I was very impressed with both
USC and UCLA UCLA showed ex
cellent depth by taking all five of
their divers to the final rounds,"
Schavone said.
Schavone believes that the Bruin
Invite was a useful indication of his
team's ability to compete against the
two teams. The strength of the Tro
jans and Bruins will be a challenge
that the Cardinal will meet again in
the Pacific-10 Conference and
NCAA Zone competitions.
"Without a doubt we need to
make some major steps to compete
at Pac-lOs and zones against these
schools," Schavone said.
