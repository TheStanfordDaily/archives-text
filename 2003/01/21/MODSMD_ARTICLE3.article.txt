# Group tactics shift as war approaches
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This article is the next in a series examining
the relationship between Stanford and the potential war in
Iraq.

While the Stanford community awaits the highly
anticipated United Nations report on Iraq and
President Bush's State of the Union address — both
expected to have significant influence on the future
policy of the United States and other nations toward
Iraq — on-campus groups are resorting to increas
ingly innovative strategies to promote their respec
tive points of view.
Stanford Community for Peace and Justice Co-
Coordinator Calvin Miaw, a senior, said his group
has been trying to raise questions about the recent
developments in U.S. foreign policy.
"It is important to adapt what we are saying
when something like this happens," Miaw said.
"We haven't done as much as we could have,
though. For instance, we really should have been
out there raising criticism and questions about
[U.N.] Resolution 1441 and really trying to do
some analysis of that, which I am not sure many
students were exposed to."
Resolution 1441, passed by the United Nations
last November, specifies that Iraq must fully dis
close all of its past programs producing weapons of
mass destruction and must comply with U.N. in
spections efforts.
While Miaw stated that his group has stepped up
its efforts to increase student awareness, he ex
plained that this awareness will still be achieved
largely through conventional means.
"[The U.N. report and the State of the Union ad
dress] will be real potential turning points in U.S.
policy," he said. "But in terms of
our strategies, we haven't really
been able to think of new ways
other than rallies or bringing new
speakers.
"However, we are going to try
and go door to door and canvas
campus and talk to people to find
out where people are in terms of
the war. That is definitely going
to be something new."
Sophomore Caroline Picker, a
member of SEAS — a student
group opposed to the war — ex
plained that "we are trying to es
calate student interest and politi
cize the campus to make everyone
aware of what is going on, because
this is the moment that things
could change for the worse."
She noted that recent protest
efforts at Stanford and in San
Francisco were stronger than past
rallies she had witnessed.
"The energy was there [at the
Stanford rally]," Picker said. "The
march over to Hoover [Tower]
was full of chanting — people
were really excited and passion
ate about what they were doing
there. The rally in San Francisco
was also a good show of support
against the war."
According to Picker, there was
a pro-war presence at the rally at
Stanford, which she said was
"great, since it sparked some de
bate over the issues."
However, Picker said there
were only about 30 pro-war sup
porters present to counter the
anti-war effort, which had a
turnout of approximately 400.
Junior Alex Robbins, a pro
war sympathizer, explained that
students supporting the war have
been less visible and fewer in
number since "who in her right
mind would, without knowing
the international situation, with
out having access to classified in
formation, vehemently or loudly
proclaim the goodness of a war, of
all things?"

"War is always a terrible
thing," Robbins continued. "The
only thing that ever justifies it is a
more terrible alternative. Its in
credibly easy to argue against a
war and much more difficult to
argue for one."
Sophomore Piotr Kosicki, a
member of the Stanford College
Republicans and opinion editor
for the Stanford Review, discussed
what his organizations have been
doing to increase student aware
ness of pro-war arguments.
"What we have been trying to
do is to increase the number of
editorials written," he said.
"[Stanford College Republicans']
treasurer Will Hudson and co
president Joe Fairbanks [submit
ted] editorials to The Daily."
Fairbanks, a sophomore, also
emphasized a more active role for
pro-war groups.
"We have shifted our strategy
only in a way that asserts our po
sition for the liberation of Iraq in
a much more aggressive way," he
said. "We will let our presence be
known in every possible way we
can to let those on this campus
who support the president
[know] that they are not alone
and should not be afraid to voice
their opposition to the radical
left's scare tactics and baseless
rhetoric."
Kosicki explained that "the
idea [behind having a pro-war
counter protest last Thursday]
was to remind the Stanford com
munity that there is a clear pro
war presence among the anti-war
presence on campus."
He clarified that by taking a
pro-war position, he is not neces
sarily opposed to a diplomatic so
lution if Iraq could somehow be
disarmed peacefully.
"If a conflict arises, at the point
it begins we will probably hold
some sort of a rally and try to mo
bilize the public's sentiments,"
Kosicki continued. "We may get
an armed forces representative
on campus. It is less of a partisan
thing than a reminder that we
support our men and women in
uniform."
