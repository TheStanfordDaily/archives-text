# Card drops a pair to BYU
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER 
As predicted, the Stanford men's volleyball
team had two very close matches against
Brigham Young this weekend. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, despite taking each match to
five games, Stanford came out of the weekend
with two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
losses.

Men's Voiieyball
Friday: No. 5 BYU def. No. 12 Stanford 33-31, 23-30,
30-26, 29-31, 15-11
Saturday: BYU def. Stanford 30-22, 23-30, 30-28, 28-
30,21-19

Since BYU was a no-show for the preseason
UCSB / Elephant Invitational, Stanford was
unable to prepare for the Cougars' strengths
and take advantage of their weaknesses at the
outset of the match.
Despite many chances, Stanford was unable
to close out each match. On Friday the score
was extremely tight: 33-31,23-30,30-26,29-31,
15-11. Saturday, the match was even closer: 30-
22,23-30,30-28,28-30,21-19, ending in a hard
fought fifth game in which Stanford failed to
convert four match points.
"We had our chances, but let it slip away,"
head coach Don Shaw said. "[BYU] rose to the
occasion and made big plays, while we didn't."
After the loss of the Cougars' two top hitters
from last year's squad, the Cardinal was uncer
tain of who would fill the void in BYU's lineup.
"Someone had to step forward for them,"
said Shaw. "I don't think they even knew who
it is going to be."
Jonathan Alleman ended up being the
Cougars' strongest weapon.
"One of our biggest problems was slowing
[Alleman] down," said sophomore Kevin
Hansen.
Alleman finished Friday's match with 30
kills, and added another 30 on Saturday.
Between the two matches, Stanford was able
to adjust its play to better compete with BYU.

"We were able to find out who their biggest
hitters were, so we could adjust our block and
defense," said Hansen.
Although Stanford was disappointed with the
end result, it did not leave completely disap
pointed. The team saw many improvements in
the second match as compared to the first.
"We showed that we can fight," said senior
Curt Toppel. "We are definitely coming to
gether as a team."
Toppel showed his fight by playing through
an injured thumb, luckily on his non-hitting
hand. Despite playing with a brace on his
thumb, Toppel recorded 22 kills on Friday and
25 kills Saturday. Toppel had not practiced
with the team in the fall due to his injury, but
Shaw was impressed with what he saw.
" [Toppel was] working his way back into the
game," said Shaw. "Hallway through the second
match we started to see the real Curt Toppel."
Individually, in addition to Toppel, Shaw
was particularly impressed with the play of
freshmen Chris Sandman, Chris Ahlfeldt and
Hansen.
"The first night Sandman came in off the

bench and gave us a boost," Shaw said. "The
second night Ahlfeldt did the same thing."
Ahlfeldt finished with six kills and four digs
on Saturday, while Sandman had eight kills on
Friday.
"Hansen did a good job all around," Shaw
said. Hansen led the team in assists with 58 on
Friday and 63 on Saturday.
Both matches provided the Cardinal with
clues as to what it needs to improve if it hopes
to be successful in the MPSF.
"We need to work on receiving serve,"
Hansen said. "BYU was giving us a hard time
passing, which hurt our offense."
"We're a new team working together, so its
hard for guys to play new positions, but in the sec
ond match, we started to do that," Toppel said.
Both Toppel and Hansen agreed they al
ready saw marked improvement in the block
ing defense over the course of the weekend.
While the weekend losses were disappoint
ing, the team is confident that their consistent
improvement will challenge top-ranked
Hawaii during its matches in Honolulu on
Wednesday and Friday.
