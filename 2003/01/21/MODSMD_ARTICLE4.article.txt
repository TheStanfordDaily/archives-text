# ASSU advocates new union
## Officers push to move student center higher on priority list 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While a new student union has been an
ASSU campaign promise for many years and
by many Senate candidates, little progress has
been made on the issue. This year, however,
the ASSU hopes to set the process in motion
by generating student interest and support
and by getting the administration to make the
project a priority.
"There has never been a substantial effort
to write a substantial proposal to make a com
pelling case fora new student union," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez, a ju
nior. "We hope tojumpstart the effort."

This quarter, Rodriguez said the ASSU
plans to conduct a student survey and draft a
proposal for expanded student space to iden
tify what is needed. Rodriguez will work with
a group of students outside of the ASSU to or
ganize the survey. He said the survey will help
quantify what needs a new student union
should serve and what its benefits would be.
The results of the survey will contribute to
the ASSU proposal — currently being writ
ten — about increasing student space and
building a new student union. The proposal,
started last year, has been built upon and de
veloped by the Student Life Committee,
chaired by Senator Joey Natoli, a sopho
more. Rodriguez said the proposal has ex
panded from an individual project to an in
clusive effort.
