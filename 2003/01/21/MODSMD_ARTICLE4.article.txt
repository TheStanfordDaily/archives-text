# ASSU advocates new union
## Officers push to move student center higher on priority list 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While a new student union has been an
ASSU campaign promise for many years and
by many Senate candidates, little progress has
been made on the issue. This year, however,
the ASSU hopes to set the process in motion
by generating student interest and support
and by getting the administration to make the
project a priority.
"There has never been a substantial effort
to write a substantial proposal to make a com
pelling case fora new student union," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez, a ju
nior. "We hope tojumpstart the effort."

This quarter, Rodriguez said the ASSU
plans to conduct a student survey and draft a
proposal for expanded student space to iden
tify what is needed. Rodriguez will work with
a group of students outside of the ASSU to or
ganize the survey. He said the survey will help
quantify what needs a new student union
should serve and what its benefits would be.
The results of the survey will contribute to
the ASSU proposal — currently being writ
ten — about increasing student space and
building a new student union. The proposal,
started last year, has been built upon and de
veloped by the Student Life Committee,
chaired by Senator Joey Natoli, a sopho
more. Rodriguez said the proposal has ex
panded from an individual project to an in
clusive effort.
The committee has been inter
viewing different student groups to
qualitatively assess their needs.
This, along with the survey, will
contribute student opinions to the
recommendation, which will be
sent to the administration.
Rodriguez hopes the proposal,
by articulating the need for more
centralized student space, will
prompt the administration to give
high priority to funding the project.
According to Natoli, the commit
tee's current goals are to inform the
student body and key decision
makers about the different needs

for student space on campus, to
complete the recommendation so it
will affect the way administrators
look at space allocation and con
struction issues in the future, and to
increase the amount of student
voice on the issue.
One of the obstacles identified by
Rodriguez is the long-term nature
of the issue. He estimated that two
generations of students (eight years)
will pass through Stanford before
the project reaches fruition. As a re
sult, it has been hard to raise student
excitement over the issue. Natoli
hopes to make the process of space
allocation more open and inclusive
of student voice as well.
The main difficulties in building
a new student union, according to
Natoli, are limitations on space and

money, the restrictions imposed by
the General Use Permit and the dif
ferent ideologies within the admin
istration concerning what should be
built and when.
The administration is currently
trying to deal with the issue by allo
cating short-term space, taking
space away from other uses tem
porarily. Rodriguez said it is neces
sary to make die University pay at
tention to long-term space needs.
"Short-term space is a stop-gap
fora solution that must be a long
time in coming and must be ad
dressed," Rodriguez said.
He added that students need a
space diey could own or partially
own and access all the time. He
thinks it is necessary for centralizing
campus life and access to resources

for students and student groups.
"I got motivated about the issue
last summer when 112 realized how a
new student union is so closely con
nected to other student issues," Ro
driguez said, "ft is important to do
something for the generations of
students that will come after us."
Natoli described the issue of
student space as very important
because it affects the extracurricu
lar activities, student groups and
community centers that make
Stanford what it is. Natoli said
more space is needed to facilitate
greater programming and the sta
bility of groups.
"What is important is what you
do with what you learn at Stanford,
and if there isn't space for students
to meet, this is stifled," Natoli said.
