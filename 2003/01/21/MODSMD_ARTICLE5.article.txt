# Affirmative action forum held today
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At noon in White Plaza today,
members of the Students of Color
Coalition will hold an educational
forum on affirmative action as
part of today's National Take Af
firmadve Action Day led by the
NAACP and the United States
Student Association.
At the forum, speakers will dis
cuss the impact that affirmative ac
tion policies have on students and
faculty at Stanford and at other col
leges across the country.
Forum organizers stress the
event's importance as the Supreme
Court continues to deliberate two
court cases brought against the
University of Michigan's existing
affirmative action policies.
SOCC members will continue
their efforts when they meet with
Provost John Etchemendy on Jan.
27 to discuss a list of demands that
the organization has drawn up
aimed at improving the diversity of
the student body and faculty at
Stanford.
