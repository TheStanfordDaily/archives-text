# International Spotlight
## Ethiopia 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is the fourth in a weekly series of inter
views with international students at Stanford meant to
heighten awareness of issues of social and political impor
tance around the world.

Meklit Workneh is a sophomore studying human
biology from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a country
roughly twice the size of Texas in the horn of East
Africa. One of the only countries in Africa to resist
European colonization, Ethiopia has been under
both a monarchical and communist government in
the 20th century and transitioned to a federal demo
cratic government in the early '90s. Having just
emerged from a border war with Eritrea, its north
ern neighbor, this country of roughly 70 million peo
ple now serves as the home to the African Union but
continues to battle a rising HIV epidemic and food
shortages.
The Daily sat down with Workneh, who is one
of approximately 15 Ethiopian students at Stan
ford, to discuss the political and social issues fac
ing her country.
The Daily: "Hie population of Ethiopia is pretty
much half-Muslim and half-Christian. Have stu-
dents from Ethiopia been scruti
nized by the U.S. government like
students from some other African
and Asian countries have?
Meklit Workneh: I think when
Sept. 11 happened, Ethiopians felt
that we wouldn't be affected by
that â€” Muslims and Christians
combined... A lot of people are
being denied visas, and we're get
ting a lot more scrutiny. Not just to
get American visas but also for Eu
ropean countries. People are being
affected by that, and I think they
kind of feel like, "Why us?" We're
not really involved; we don't have a
lot of terrorist activity in the country.
There is some, but it's very small
and remote.
TD: Ethiopia is unique in that it is
one of the only African countries
that has essentially always been in
dependent. How do you gauge the
political situation of your country
right now?
MW: The present government is
now in the tenth year, the tenth or
eleventh year, that it's been in
power, so on the outside it might ap
pear stable. About five years back,
Ethiopia and Eritrea were being
held up as these countries are doing
so well in the horn and could be ex
amples for the rest of Africa ... For
the people within the country it's
very different, because we see a lot of
the problems that exist within the
government. For one, the parties
are kind of divided along tribal/
ethnic lines, and I personally dis
agree with that. I feel that fosters ha
tred or distances between the differ
ent ethnic / tribal parties. In terms

of economics, right now with the
famine and the HIV epidemic,
things aren't looking so good.
TD: The Bush administration has
halted U.S. funding for condom dis
tribution in Africa. How do people
in Ethiopia feel about this?
MW: To an extent, I think people
see this as a problem that we have to
fix ourselves. At the same time, they
do look to Western countries for
support and funding. But, I think a
lot of people right now are looking
for solutions that are Ethiopian, that
aren't coming in from a Western
model, and I see that sort of thinking
becoming more prevalent now, like
we need solutions to our own prob
lems; we need to identify the cultur
al values we have and apply that to
these problems. And that's really
good, I think, because a lot of the
Western ideas and Western models
that come in haven't been working.
TD: What is the atmosphere for
women like in Ethiopia? Is your
situation unique for an Ethiopi
an woman?
MW: In many ways, my situation is
unique. I don't feel it's because I'm
a woman, though. I think it's be
cause of the academic opportuni
ties that have been presented to me.
I think there are a lot of steps and
people are making a lot of effort to
integrate women effectively into
government, into education, into
health sectors... I feel as though
there's a lot of improvement that
could be made in terms of integrat
ing women into different fields, and
the efforts being made are really
good. A lot of our ministers are
women; our minister of education
is a woman, and I think even histor
ically, women have not been op
pressed as much in Ethiopia. We've

had empresses that were women,
very powerful women.
TD: Are there a lot of Ethiopians
who try to study abroad, and do
most plan to return to Ethiopia to
assist the country?
MW: Yes, there are a lot of people
who want to study abroad ... What
usually happens when people come
out here to get their education is
they end up staying, so there is a
huge Ethiopian diaspora in the
States and a lot of European coun
tries ... I read something saying
that the Ethiopian diaspora is one of
the biggest donors to Ethiopia right
now. So obviously they're sending
money back to relatives, but they're
also investing in the country's pri
vate investments and donating
money to the government. But
there is a very small group that also
tries to go back and create a differ
ence back there, and I hope to be
among that group.
TD: During your life, you've experi
enced a change in governments and
a war with Eritrea. What was the cli
mate in Ethiopia like during this
time? Did these events affect you, or
did they seem remote?
MW: When I was younger, with the
Communist Party in place then, it
was an interesting time ... My par
ents ended up moving us, my two
brothers and my dad, to Nairobi be
cause things were just getting really
crazy in the country and a lot of
times young boys would be round
ed up to go serve in the military. So
we moved, and that was a direct re
sult of the conditions of the country.
And then, three years later we
moved back, and things were a lot
more stable then, after the govern
ment changed. You could see the
country going through transition ..

. At first, 1 feel like a lot of people
were like, "Great, now we get to vote
,and we get to do this." But I feel that
as the years have gone on, people
have become less and less support
ive of the government, just because
there hasn't been a significant
amount of growth.
TD: How do people relate the cur
rent state of the country with the
new government?
MW: Opinions differ. There are
some people who say the old gov
ernment was better, there are some
people who go all the way back and
say that the monarchy was better,
times were so much easier then. In
terms of the whole AIDS epidemic,
it's difficult to blame it entirely on
this government because the whole
explosion happened in the '90s, but
there are some people who do that
and associate it with this new gov
ernment coming in. In terms of the
famine, the government back home
actually took some responsibility for
that.
TD: Is there anything you want to
add?
MW: I would say to people that
there are a lot of these problems
going on in Ethiopia and a lot of
African nations, and we forget to
look beyond all these problems
people are having. Yes, we are hav
ing a famine right now, and it's
horrible, and yes, there is a huge
HIV epidemic, but I feel that peo
ple forget that there are people out
there that think like them, that do
the same things. Yes, we're differ
ent, culturally and everything, but
there's a lot of similarities that peo
ple forget, that there are people
out there, that there are all these
beautiful cultures, that there are
positive things too.
