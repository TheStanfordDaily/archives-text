# Stanford students join diverse S.F. protest crowd

### VINAY JAIN 
Several dozen Stanford students stood
shoulder-to-shoulder Saturday with an im
probable mix of leftist radicals, middle-class
soccer moms and many others in San Francis
co's march against a possible U.S. war with
Iraq.
The protest began in front of the Ferry
Building at 11 a.m. and proceeded down Mar
ket Street to City Hall. At one point, the line of
marchers stretched nearly two miles, from the
Ferry Building to the Civic Center.
Anti-war chants surged up the crowd from
the rear, led by people with loud voices and
the occasional megaphone. Some of the pro
testors thrust up signs in support of specific
causes like Palestinian statehood, worker soli
darity and freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal.
But many participants were middle-aged
and quieter, voicing no agenda other than
their opposition to war. There were mothers
and fathers strolling hand-in-hand with their
children, and white-haired men and women
humming John Lennon's "Give Peace a
Chance" as younger marchers shouted slo
gans behind them.
Noting the makeup of the crowds, Jillian
Gerner, who received her master's in psychol
ogy from Stanford in 2002, said, "The diversi
ty of the anti-war movement is increasing, es
pecially if you compare this to the last march."
She said she believed the movement will
continue to attract an even broader spectrum
of support as the potential for war grows.
Police estimated the protest — perhaps the
largest in the region since the Vietnam era —
drew 55,000 people. Organizers said the

crowds were much larger, totaling as many as
200,000.
"I was impressed with the number of peo
ple— it really surprised me," said senior
Nathan Matthews, adding that he believed the
march easily eclipsed a similar Oct. 26 protest
in size.
Mandeep Gill, a member of the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice, compiled a
list of 90 Stanford student participants and
said it was likely that many more went un
counted.
Participants gave many reasons for their
anti-war stance, including the likelihood of
Iraqi civilian deaths, environmental damage,
harm to the U.S. economy and a suspicion of
American motives.
Junior Zoe Friedman-Cohen said there is
"no legitimate reason" for the U.S. to attack
Iraq.
"By invading, we'd be hurting Saddam
Hussein's people just as much as he is," she
said. "We've already seen in the Middle East
that it doesn't work to wield a big stick."
Stephen Hunt, a third-year medical and
doctoral student in neuroscience, marched
wearing a white labcoat with a stethoscope. A
member of Physicians for Social Responsibili
ty, he said America should address domestic
problems like lack of adequate healthcare "be
fore spending money on a war primarily mo
tivated by the desire for cheaper oil.
"As doctors, we oppose war for obvious rea
sons," Hunt added.
Other Stanford students also found cre
ative ways to express their opposition to the
