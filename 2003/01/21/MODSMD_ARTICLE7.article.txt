# Stanford students join diverse S.F. protest crowd
## 
### VINAY JAIN 
Several dozen Stanford students stood
shoulder-to-shoulder Saturday with an im
probable mix of leftist radicals, middle-class
soccer moms and many others in San Francis
co's march against a possible U.S. war with
Iraq.
The protest began in front of the Ferry
Building at 11 a.m. and proceeded down Mar
ket Street to City Hall. At one point, the line of
marchers stretched nearly two miles, from the
Ferry Building to the Civic Center.
Anti-war chants surged up the crowd from
the rear, led by people with loud voices and
the occasional megaphone. Some of the pro
testors thrust up signs in support of specific
causes like Palestinian statehood, worker soli
darity and freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal.
But many participants were middle-aged
and quieter, voicing no agenda other than
their opposition to war. There were mothers
and fathers strolling hand-in-hand with their
children, and white-haired men and women
humming John Lennon's "Give Peace a
Chance" as younger marchers shouted slo
gans behind them.
Noting the makeup of the crowds, Jillian
Gerner, who received her master's in psychol
ogy from Stanford in 2002, said, "The diversi
ty of the anti-war movement is increasing, es
pecially if you compare this to the last march."
She said she believed the movement will
continue to attract an even broader spectrum
of support as the potential for war grows.
Police estimated the protest — perhaps the
largest in the region since the Vietnam era —
drew 55,000 people. Organizers said the

crowds were much larger, totaling as many as
200,000.
"I was impressed with the number of peo
ple— it really surprised me," said senior
Nathan Matthews, adding that he believed the
march easily eclipsed a similar Oct. 26 protest
in size.
Mandeep Gill, a member of the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice, compiled a
list of 90 Stanford student participants and
said it was likely that many more went un
counted.
Participants gave many reasons for their
anti-war stance, including the likelihood of
Iraqi civilian deaths, environmental damage,
harm to the U.S. economy and a suspicion of
American motives.
Junior Zoe Friedman-Cohen said there is
"no legitimate reason" for the U.S. to attack
Iraq.
"By invading, we'd be hurting Saddam
Hussein's people just as much as he is," she
said. "We've already seen in the Middle East
that it doesn't work to wield a big stick."
Stephen Hunt, a third-year medical and
doctoral student in neuroscience, marched
wearing a white labcoat with a stethoscope. A
member of Physicians for Social Responsibili
ty, he said America should address domestic
problems like lack of adequate healthcare "be
fore spending money on a war primarily mo
tivated by the desire for cheaper oil.
"As doctors, we oppose war for obvious rea
sons," Hunt added.
Other Stanford students also found cre
ative ways to express their opposition to the

potential war. While most arrived at
the protest by car, bus or train,
about a half-dozen biked from Palo
Alto.
"We're certainly not willing to
use oil to go to a protest, and cer
tainly even less willing to use it as an
excuse for war," explained Jennifer

Burney, one of the cyclists and a
third-year graduate student in
physics. She taped a sign to her bike
reading, "My vehicle of choice for
regime change."
After the march down Market
Str eet, protesters crowded into the
Civic Center, where a stage had
been set up in front of City Hall.
Some perched themselves atop the
plaza's knobby, leafless trees to get a
better view of the host of speakers,
which included the singer Joan

Baez and actor Martin Sheen.
Sheen, voice booming, exhorted
the crowd to persist in its opposition
to the potential war.
"From this time forth, may all
our thoughts, words and deeds be a
nonviolent resistance to all vio
lence," he shouted. "Let my country
awake."
The rally's keynote speaker was
Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, the
only member of Congress to vote
against a resolution gr anting Presi

dent George W. Bush broad powers
to combat terrorism after the Sept.
11 attacks.
Lee used the timing of the
protest — the Martin Luther King,
Jr. holiday weekend — to invoke
the memory of the slain civil rights
leader. To loud cheers, Lee said
King had fought against the "real
axis of evil" — poverty, racism and
war.
The march was one of several
that took place around the world

on Saturday, in cities such as Wash
ington, D.C., Paris, Tokyo and
Cairo. The U.S. protests were orga
nized by International
A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop
War & End Racism), a coalition of a
dozen organizations.
Washington's rally was even larg
er than the one in San Francisco,
drawing a crowd of 100,000 accord
ing to police, and 500,000 according
to organizers.
Tahnee Nye, a spokeswoman for

International A.N.S.W.E.R.'s San
Francisco branch, said that Satur
day's protests "really showed there
is a large segment of the U.S. popu
lation that is against this war."
The weekend rally was the sec

about 400 students gathered in

the support of Bush's policies by

potential war. While most arrived at
the protest by car, bus or train,
about a half-dozen biked from Palo
Alto.
"We're certainly not willing to
use oil to go to a protest, and cer
tainly even less willing to use it as an
excuse for war," explained Jennifer

Burney, one of the cyclists and a
third-year graduate student in
physics. She taped a sign to her bike
reading, "My vehicle of choice for
regime change."
After the march down Market
Str eet, protesters crowded into the
Civic Center, where a stage had
been set up in front of City Hall.
Some perched themselves atop the
plaza's knobby, leafless trees to get a
better view of the host of speakers,
which included the singer Joan

Baez and actor Martin Sheen.
Sheen, voice booming, exhorted
the crowd to persist in its opposition
to the potential war.
"From this time forth, may all
our thoughts, words and deeds be a
nonviolent resistance to all vio
lence," he shouted. "Let my country
awake."
The rally's keynote speaker was
Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, the
only member of Congress to vote
against a resolution gr anting Presi

dent George W. Bush broad powers
to combat terrorism after the Sept.
11 attacks.
Lee used the timing of the
protest — the Martin Luther King,
Jr. holiday weekend — to invoke
the memory of the slain civil rights
leader. To loud cheers, Lee said
King had fought against the "real
axis of evil" — poverty, racism and
war.
The march was one of several
that took place around the world

on Saturday, in cities such as Wash
ington, D.C., Paris, Tokyo and
Cairo. The U.S. protests were orga
nized by International
A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop
War & End Racism), a coalition of a
dozen organizations.
Washington's rally was even larg
er than the one in San Francisco,
drawing a crowd of 100,000 accord
ing to police, and 500,000 according
to organizers.
Tahnee Nye, a spokeswoman for

International A.N.S.W.E.R.'s San
Francisco branch, said that Satur
day's protests "really showed there
is a large segment of the U.S. popu
lation that is against this war."
The weekend rally was the sec
ond protest in a week for some
Stanford students. Last Thursday,
about 400 students gathered in
front of Hoover Tower to oppose
the support of Bush's policies by
certain members of the Hoover In
stitution.
Several dozen Stanford students stood
shoulder-to-shoulder Saturday with an im
probable mix of leftist radicals, middle-class
soccer moms and many others in San Francis
co's march against a possible U.S. war with
Iraq.
The protest began in front of the Ferry
Building at 11 a.m. and proceeded down Mar
ket Street to City Hall. At one point, the line of
marchers stretched nearly two miles, from the
Ferry Building to the Civic Center.
Anti-war chants surged up the crowd from
the rear, led by people with loud voices and
the occasional megaphone. Some of the pro
testors thrust up signs in support of specific
causes like Palestinian statehood, worker soli
darity and freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal.
But many participants were middle-aged
and quieter, voicing no agenda other than
their opposition to war. There were mothers
and fathers strolling hand-in-hand with their
children, and white-haired men and women
humming John Lennon's "Give Peace a
Chance" as younger marchers shouted slo
gans behind them.
Noting the makeup of the crowds, Jillian
Gerner, who received her master's in psychol
ogy from Stanford in 2002, said, "The diversi
ty of the anti-war movement is increasing, es
pecially if you compare this to the last march."
She said she believed the movement will
continue to attract an even broader spectrum
of support as the potential for war grows.
Police estimated the protest — perhaps the
largest in the region since the Vietnam era —
drew 55,000 people. Organizers said the

crowds were much larger, totaling as many as
200,000.
"I was impressed with the number of peo
ple— it really surprised me," said senior
Nathan Matthews, adding that he believed the
march easily eclipsed a similar Oct. 26 protest
in size.
Mandeep Gill, a member of the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice, compiled a
list of 90 Stanford student participants and
said it was likely that many more went un
counted.
Participants gave many reasons for their
anti-war stance, including the likelihood of
Iraqi civilian deaths, environmental damage,
harm to the U.S. economy and a suspicion of
American motives.

"no legitimate reason" for the U.S. to attack
