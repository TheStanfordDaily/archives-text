# Alt-rock bands coming to Kresge
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alternative rock bands Something Corporate and
The Juliana Theory will be performing tonight at 9
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium in a special Stanford-only
concert. This follows a sold-out show at The Fillmore
in San Francisco, a popular Bay Area venue that is
four times the size of Kresge.
The Stanford Concert Network has decided to
book the bands in a concert exclusively for Stanford
community members in order to create a small, inti
mate atmosphere for the performance. The two
groups' tour dates have been almost completely sold
out elsewhere.
"We've been wanting to do a campus rock show of
this type fora while, and when we heard they were
coming to the area, we jumped at the chance," said
SCN Publicity Manager Traci Tsai, a senior.
The concert has created considerable excitement
on campus, particularly among those who follow non
mainstream music.
"I think one of the coolest things about them is that
their music crosses many genres and appeals to
everyone from fans of punk rock to fans of Ben Folds
and slow acoustic rock," said SCN Assistant Director
Niki Carelli, a junior. "Both bands put on amazing
live acts â€” I saw them both last summer and was in
stantly hooked."
Tsai said, "These are big names for those who lis
ten to this type of music. Had we opened the concert
to public sale, it would have been sold out in seconds."

Due to the sold-out concert at
The Fillmore and impressive
word-of-mouth reviews, SCN di
rectors expect a long line for
tonight's concert and a packed
house.
"I believe this is the smallest
venue on their tour, and I'm will
ing to wager that this will be the
last opportunity to see them in a
place as small as Kresge," Carelli
said.
Something Corporate is a quin
tet of men in their early 20s from
Southern California. Its major
radio hit is "If YoU C Jordan," and
its sound has often been compared
to that of Ben Folds Five. The
band has opened for Better Than
Ezra, Sugar Ray and New Found
Glory and spent this summer
headlining the Warped Tour.
"People who listen to radio
songs tend to like our band be
cause we write choruses with a
hook," said Andrew McMahon,
lead singer and piano player.
The Juliana Theory, who just
signed with Epic Records, is also
a band of five young men. The
group is about to release its third
album, "Love," and has built up
a strong fan base around the
country.

"Going the indie route was very
important to us," said Brett Detar,
the group's singer. "There were
drawbacks, like distribution and
radio play, but it afforded us the
ability to take the time to learn how
to make records, build a loyal fan
base and become a really strong
live band. If I could do it all over
again, I'd do it the exact same
way."
Following the concert tonight,
the Juliana Theory will hold an au
tograph session.
This dual concert is arguably
the highlight in a very busy week
full of popular music shows. Im
mediately preceding the concert at
Kresge, the rock group Vendetta
Red will present a free show in the
Coffee House, in a special pre
album release showcase. Stanford
is the only college campus that
Vendetta Red will include in its
preview tour.
Also, Mia Doi Todd and Jen
Wood will perform in the Coffee
House on Thursday at 10 p.m. as
part of the Stanford Concert Net
work's weekly series.
"This is going to be awesome,"
said Kim Samek, a senior. "Music
is becoming a bigger presence at
Stanford."
Tickets to the Something Cor
porate/Juliana Theory concert
tonight in Kresge Auditorium
are $13. They can be purchased
at the door.
