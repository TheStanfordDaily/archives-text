# Alt-rock bands coming to Kresge
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alternative rock bands Something Corporate and
The Juliana Theory will be performing tonight at 9
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium in a special Stanford-only
concert. This follows a sold-out show at The Fillmore
in San Francisco, a popular Bay Area venue that is
four times the size of Kresge.
The Stanford Concert Network has decided to
book the bands in a concert exclusively for Stanford
community members in order to create a small, inti
mate atmosphere for the performance. The two
groups' tour dates have been almost completely sold
out elsewhere.
"We've been wanting to do a campus rock show of
this type fora while, and when we heard they were
coming to the area, we jumped at the chance," said
SCN Publicity Manager Traci Tsai, a senior.
The concert has created considerable excitement
on campus, particularly among those who follow non
mainstream music.
"I think one of the coolest things about them is that
their music crosses many genres and appeals to
everyone from fans of punk rock to fans of Ben Folds
and slow acoustic rock," said SCN Assistant Director
Niki Carelli, a junior. "Both bands put on amazing
live acts â€” I saw them both last summer and was in
stantly hooked."
Tsai said, "These are big names for those who lis
ten to this type of music. Had we opened the concert
to public sale, it would have been sold out in seconds."
