# NASA extends lease to Carnegie Mellon
## Agreement enables university to keep its Silicon Valley campus 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Silicon Valley has traditionally
attracted companies and universi
ties looking to establish a foothold
in the technology capital of the
world. Hoping to solidify its posi
tion on the cutting edge of com
puter science research, Carnegie
Mellon University signed a long
term lease agreement with NASA
early this month to extend its use
ofMoffett Field in Mountain View
for another 15 years.
Carnegie Mellon is regarded
as one of the top universities in
the country in computer science
and other engineering fields,
and may provide new local com
petition for Stanford in informa
tion technology.

Since 1999, Carnegie Mellon
has been working to develop its
presence in the Valley for purpos
es ranging from research to vari
ous educational programs. Under
tlie new agreement, Carnegie
Mellon will renovate 19,000
square feet of its leased space for
its growing West Coast campus,
which is based on (he historic
Shenandoah Plaza at Moffett
Field.
"We are delighted to sign this
lease agreement with Carnegie
Mellon University, one of the
world's premier institutions of
higher education, especially in
the area of computer science,"
said NASA Ames Center Director
G. Scott Hubbard in a Carnegie
Mellon University press release.
"The combination of Carnegie
Mellon University's High-De
pendability Computing research
focus and its new information
technology graduate program
will serve to advance NASA's mis
sion as well as set the stage for

broader collaboration with Silicon
Valley's high tech community."
Stanford School of Engineer
ing Dean Jim Plummer said that it
is natural fora university like
Carnegie Mellon to look to have a
presence in California because of
its excellence in computer and
technology fields.
"There is a large demand for
professional education in Silicon
Valley, especially in areas like
[electrical engineering] and [com
puter science]," Plummer said.
"Most major universities also have
many graduates working in Sili
con Valley and have an interest in
maintaining contact with them."
According to Plummer,
Carnegie Mellon will not be
alone.
"Other institutions, including
Stanford, have or will have a pres
ence [on Moffett Field]," Plum
mer said. "The School of Engi
neering at Stanford is currently
negotiating for some space
there."

He added, "While CMU and
Stanford will certainly compete at
some level, 1 think there will also
be many opportunities for collab
oration."
Carnegie Mellon's West Coast
campus opened for classes in Sep
tember 2002, enabling its 56 stu
dents to obtain a master's degree
in information technology. The
program takes a unique hands-on
approach, with projects and indi
vidually mentored activities that
emphasize teamwork and collabo
ration.
"The current CMU course of
ferings at their Moffett field site
complement what Stanford of
fers," Plummer said. "1 would ex
pect lots of innovation in this gen
eral field over the next few years."
The plaza is adjacent to
NASA's Ames Research Center
and is part of a 213-acre research
park the agency is developing. Ac
cording to the agreement,
