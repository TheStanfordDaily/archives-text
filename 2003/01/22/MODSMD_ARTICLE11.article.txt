# Berkeley reverses decision to censor funding letter

Alter being criticized for en
dangering academic freedom,
UC-Berkeley officials last Thurs
day reversed a controversial deci
sion to censor a fundraising ap
peal they deemed politically sub
versive.
"In protecting the university,
they forgot to protect free ex
pression," said Candace Falk, di
rector of the Emma Goldman Pa
pers Project, who was forced by
UC-Berkeley administrators to
withhold a mailing request for
private contributions for the pro
ject.
The Emma Goldman Papers
Project comprises a collection of

over 20,000 documents by and
about the influential Russian
born anarchist. Goldman criti
cized the military conscription of
young men during World War I
and was sentenced to two years
imprisonment and afterward de
ported from the United States to
Russia in 1919.
Based at UC-Berkeley, the
Emma Goldman Papers Project
is funded principally by the Na
tional Historical Publications and
Records Commission of the Na
tional Archives in Washington,
D.C., as well as other federal and
private sources. Despite the need
for more funding to maintain the

project, UC-Berkeley officials
disallowed the original version of
the mailing because it contained
quotes from Goldman advocating
resistance to war â€” quotes that
the university felt could be seen
as a statement opposing the Bush
administrations plans fora po
tential war in Iraq.
Robert M. Price, associate vice
chancellor for research at UC-
Berkeley, believed the quotations
presented a political stance that
the university would not neces
sarily wish to endorse given the
current national climate.
The letter quoted Goldman's
call to "men and women not yet
overcome by war madness to
raise their voice of protest."
Price removed two quotations
from the mailings and several
hundred copies of the revised let
ter were sent. Falk disagreed with
the alterations and subsequently
had an alternative mailing print
ed at her own expense.
Falk was approached shortly
after by The New York Times,
which ran the story on Jan. 13, ig
niting a wave of support. Accord
ing to Falk, she received over 300
letters and e-mails protesting
Berkeley's decision, which in her
view amounted to censorship.
By Jan. 16, Berkeley had over
turned the decision, and Falk was
informed that the mailing could
go ahead.
A statement issued by UC-
Berkeley Chancellor Robert M.
Berdahl said that, "in retrospect,
had we to do it over, we would
have done it differently."
Falk acknowledged that, as a
public institution, officials were
simply trying to protect the uni
versity, yet in so doing, jeopar

dized Berkeley's reputation as a
bastion of academic freedom.
"It just shows you that if you go
too far to suppress freedoms,
there will be an outcry," said Falk,
who was surprised by the volume
of public support she received.
She added, "The openness of
the university is the very reason
that the Emma Goldman Papers
exist in the first place."
Clayborne Carson, professor
of history and director of the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers
Project at Stanford, expressed
surprise at Berkeley's actions.
"I would hope that it was a bad
decision by one administration
and not an indication that Berke
ley wants to suppress free
speech," Carson said.
"People like Martin Luther
King, Jr. and Emma Goldman,
by their nature, made controver
sial statements, and if you say
that you can't use their quotes,
then that should be a compli
ment to their ideas," said Carson,
who said he supports Falk in her
decision to include the quota
tions in the fundraising appeal.
Religious Studies Prof. Tom
Sheehan looks upon the episode
as "a small glitch in a long tradi
tion of free speech at Berkeley."
Berkeley's history of political
activity and protest stretches as
far back as the 19305, when large
numbers of students rallied
against fascism.
During the '50s, Berkeley
students openly criticized the
McCarthy proceedings, in
which hundreds of Americans
were accused publicly of com
munism. But it was during the
1960s that Berkeley forged an
international reputation as a
home to activists protesting
civil rights issues and the Viet
nam War. In 1964, the Free
Speech Movement was estab
lished at Berkeley.

Many Stanford faculty said
they were surprised by UC-
Berkeley's initial decision and
had not felt any pressure on aca
demic freedom from University
administrators here.
"I do not think anything like
this could happen here," com
mented Sheehan. "The faculty is
too smart to sully such a glorious
reputation as Stanford has for
academic freedom."
However, Sheehan acknowl
edged that, as in the days of Mc-
Carthyism and Cold War para
noia, academic freedom often
comes under threat when nation
al security is at stake.
Eamonn Callan, professor of
education and senior associate
dean for academic affairs, said
Berkeley's actions "could have set
a very dangerous precedent."
"It would be a profound mis
take for universities to control
controversial statements made by
individuals in the name of keep
ing a neutral stance," Callan said.
"Even if you are pro-peace in the
contemporary situation, there is
no real reason why particular in
dividuals have to be muzzled and
controlled."
According to Tom Wasow,
professor of linguistics and phi
losophy, the academic environ
ment is one that naturally lends
itself to freedom of speech.
"Tenure means that faculty do
not have to worry about express
ing their opinion," said Wasow,
though he added that the Uni
versity has the right to interfere if
the opinions are expressed as
those of the institution.
Many considered UC-Berke
ley an unlikely candidate for aca
demic censorship. According to
Falk, the episode should be taken
as a warning to other universities.
"If it can happen at Berkeley,
then it can happen anywhere,"
he said.
