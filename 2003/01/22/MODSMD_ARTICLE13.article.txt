## Bush urges action vs. Iraq 
### 
WASHING lON (AP) — President Bush yesterday
scolded world leaders who are demanding more time
to search Iraq for illegal arms, and a top U.S. diplomat
warned i hat war is fast approaching as America's only
option.
"This business about more time — how much time
do we need to see clearly that he's not disarming?"
Bush said, acknowledging frustration with both Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and reluctant U.S. allies
like France and Germany.
"Surely our friends have learned lessons from the
past. Surely, we have learned how this man deceives
and delays," Bush said. "This looks like a rerun of a
bad movie, and I'm not interested in watching it."
The chiding was part of an administration-wide ef
fort to counter rising opposition to war that could
jeopardize Bush's fragile anti-Saddam coalition. With
tens of thousands of U.S. troops massed neaiTraq, the
president is expected to decide in a matter of weeks
whether to end diplomatic efforts and wage war.
"Our other options are just about exhausted at this
point," said Deputy Secretary of State Richard Ar
mitage in a Washington speech cleared by the White
House. "This regime has very little time left to undo
the legacy of 12 years. There is no sign, there is not
one sign that the regime has any intent to comply
fully" with the United Nations.
France complicated Bush's task by telling the Unit
ed Nations Security Council there is no reason yet for
military action, hinting it may veto any resolution au
thorizing an attack. Other nations — including Rus
sia, Germany, China and Chile — have backed the
French contention that U.N. inspections are starting
to work and Iraq can be disarmed peacefully.
Britain, America's closest ally, is the only major
military power committed to joining the United
States. Other countries with smaller armies, such as
Australia, Canada and Bulgaria, could play sup
porting roles in a "coalition of the willing" that
Bush has pledged to lead if the United Nations
won't join him.
