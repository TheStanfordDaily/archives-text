Americans driving near a U.S. military base yesterday
in Kuwait, killing one and wounding another in what
U.S. officials branded a terror attack.
The shooting was the first assault on U.S. civil
ians in Kuwait and the third on Americans since
October in the oil-rich emirate, where pro-Ameri
can sentiment is usually strong and where thou
sands of U.S. troops are assembling fora possible
war on Iraq.
The victims — civilian contractors working for
the U.S. military — were traveling in a four
wheel-drive Toyota when they came under a hail
of bullets.

The U.S. Embassy identified the man killed as
Michael Rene Pouliot, 46, of San Diego, an em
ployee of a software development company, Tapes
try Solutions.
Tapestry identified the injured man as another
employee, David Caraway, a senior software engi
neer. He was in stable condition in a Kuwait hospital
after surgery to remove bullets, including two from
his chest. He also had arm and thigh wounds, a hos
pital official said.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
U.S. and Kuwaiti officials said they believed a single
