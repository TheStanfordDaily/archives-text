# Census estimates 37 million Latinos
## Latinos become largest minority 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hispanics have surged
past blacks and now constitute the largest minority
group in the United States, a status Latino leaders
are sure to use to push for political and economic
advances.
The Census Bureau released estimates yesterday
showing the Hispanic population rose 4.7 percent be
tween April 2000 and July 2001, from 35.3 million to
37 million. During the same period, the non-Hispan
ic black population rose about 2 percent, from 35.5
million to 36.1 million.
"This is the first time that Hispanic number sur
passed the black number," Census Bureau analyst
Roberto Ramirez said yesterday.
The data are part of the bureau's first statistics on
race and ethnicity since results from the 2000 census
were released nearly two years ago.
Due to high birth and immigration rates, the His
panic population more than doubled during the
19905, the 2000 census found. Many new arrivals
were drawn by the booming U.S. economy and settled
in areas in the South and Midwest that previously at
tracted few Latinos.
Whites remain the largest single population group,
numbering 199.3 million in July 2001, or nearly 70
percent of all U.S. residents, according to the Census
Bureau.
Hispanics comprise 13 percent of the U.S. popula
tion, which grew to 284.8 million in July 2001. That's
up from 35.3 million, or 12.5 percent of the country's
281.4 million residents in April 2000.
Blacks make up 12.7 percent of the population, up
from 12.6 percent in April 2000. Asians are the next
largest minority group, at about 12.1 million, or 4 per
cent of U.S. residents.
Also yesterday, the bureau released population es
timates broken down by age. It found that the medi
an age of the U.S. population — the point at which
half the population is younger and the other half
older — rose from 35.3 to 35.6.
