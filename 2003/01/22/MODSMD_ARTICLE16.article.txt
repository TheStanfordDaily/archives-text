## The
						Stanford Daily Decision to leave for NFL shouldn't be condemned 
### 
Published Since 1891

Last week, standout Cardinal offensive
tackle and Morris Trophy winner
Kwame Harris announced he would
forego his senior year at Stanford to
enter the NFL Draft. A likely first or second
round draft pick, Harris should be a particular
ly appealing choice to many teams, owing to rel
ative lack of similarly talented offensive linemen
in this year's draft pool.
Teyo Johnson's decision to enter the NFL
Draft a few weeks earlier; the last Stanford
football player to enter the NFL early did so
over a decade ago. As might be expected, cov
erage of Harris' and Johnson's decisions have
been scrutinized and deconstructed, revitaliz
ing debates about whether certain athletes
should leave Stanford early to pursue a pro
fessional sports career.
We believe that the attention given to Har
ris' and Johnson's decisions evokes a latent yet
prevailing double standard, one which ought
to be re-examined by everyone in the Stanford

community. We also believe that Harris and
Johnson, like any other Stanford students,
should be free to pursue careers in whatever
fields they choose, without any suggestion that
their uncoerced choices compromise the qual
ity or integrity of Stanford or any department
within the University.
The Stanford Athletics Department receives
no shortage of accolades, either from within its
ranks or outside the University. In the same
breath as naming its Olympic gold medallist
alumni, Athletics Department apologists men
tion that Janet Evans and Eric Heiden were
held to the same high academic standards as all
other Stanford graduates. Such litanies are
often followed by figures citing the high gradu
ation rate of the majority of Stanford athletic
programs. However, some of Stanford's most
eminent athletes left before completing their
degrees, most notably Tiger Woods and John
McEnroe. A fairly frequent event in the base
ball, tennis and golf programs, athletes in these

and other non-revenue producing collegiate
sports leaving Stanford early are judged to be
making rational and tenable decisions.
There can be no doubt that Stanford's high
aggregate graduation rates contribute to its re
maining at the top of various rankings
schemes, which in turn have an immediate
economic effect on the University. Yet over the
years talented students have left Stanford pre
maturely to start up companies, take employ
ment in lucrative industries, or gain a timely
entry in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Their decisions have never been thought to
jeopardize the reputation of the Computer
Science, Electrical Engineering or Biochem
istry Departments. It is equally unlikely that
the premature departure of two talented ath
letes from the football program will result in
lost Director's Cups or Stanford tumbling
from the rare air in US News' top colleges.
Anyone who has left Stanford early to pur
sue a unique opportunity doubtless did so only

after profound reflection and soul-searching.
Should one assume that Harris and Johnson
are any less equanimous? Like most Stanford
students, their years spent on the Farm have
given them unique experiences that will be
come precious over time. Regrettably, Harris'
and Johnson's last days in a Stanford uniform
have been characterized by an unfairness in
judgment that is not laid upon Stanford ath
letes in other programs.
Perhaps Harris' and Johnson's Stanford edu
cation gave them a keen sense that they would ul
timately be judged by a different standard than
all other athletes. And perhaps knowing this they
determined it was time to leave, to seek a place
where they hope to be judged by their true tal
ents and not uncritical prepossessions.
We look forward to continue seeing Kwame
and Teyo in uniform, though not in Cardinal
red, and on Sundays instead of Saturdays. We
wish our fellow Stanford alumni only the best as
they pursue their dreams.
