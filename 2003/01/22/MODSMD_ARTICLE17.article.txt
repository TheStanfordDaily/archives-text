# MEMORY YIELDS
## Diverse alternatives 
### 
This past weekend thousands of
people took to the streets in
many major metropolitan cities
across the U.S. and world to
protest against what many see as an up
coming war in Iraq. Many Stanford stu
dents made the trip up to San Francisco to
cap a worldwide protest parade of posters
emblazoned with two-bit slogans such as
"No Blood for Oil," or "Stop United States
of Aggression." However, ask many of the
protesters what alternatives they would
put forward for the U.S. response to
North Korea and Iraq, the best response
you're likely to get is "not Bush's." Cer
tainly, there is a-use in arguing against
what one sees as bad policy, but that
doesn't make the problem go away.
Rather, we live in a world of relatives,

where the best policy is i
often simply the least
worst. For the most part,
the protests this weekend
merely illustrated once
again that it's easier to de
stroy than it is to build.
In many ways, the
United States education
system is facing a similar
issue in the response to

the Supreme Court ease on the University
of Michigan's use of affirmative action in
its undergraduate and law school admis
sions policy. As most know, affirmative ac
tion was designed to correct the historic in
equalities and prejudices that helped
shape a socioeconomic system in which
whites dominated.
The theory was that by admitting mi
norities that might be less qualified, be it to
college, the judiciary, etc., those socioeco
nomic inequalities would be readjusted
over time. At the heart of the current de
bate over affirmative action is not whether
these historic injustices occurred. They
did. It is not a question if inequalities still
exist. They do. Instead, the question is
whether or not affirmative action along
ethnic lines has allowed just enough of a
readjustment that there is now a pool of
qualified middle- and upper-class minori
ty applicants who are given a leg up in ad
missions policy.
If this is the case, the presence of this
middle- and upper-class minority popula
tion prevents the race-based affirmative
action policy from helping those disad
vantaged candidates for whom the policy
was designed. While we don't dispute that
minority enrollment has dropped in those
states in which race-based affirmative ac
tion has been overturned, thus seemingly
suggesting that affirmative action is still
necessary, we would continue to suggest
that the more middle-and upper-class mi
nority applicants that exist, the less effi
cient the system will be in granting oppor
tunity to disadvantaged candidates.
Furthermore, there is no doubt that
race has been institutionalized in the last
30 years, although there is some dispute as

to whether this is a good or not. Many mi
nority groups claim that it is. Others who
would argue that point have to walk a
careful line to avoid being tagged with a
racist label. In other words, the whole
issue has become too politically charged
fora free debate to take place or for intel
ligent policy to be enacted. Do to its enor
mous guilt complex, American society
slapped a quick-fix on an enormous prob
lem, and now doesn't know how to amend
the prescription. We've become addicted
to race, when what we set out to cure was
ills grounded in socioeconomic status.
One has to look no further than these
pages to see how Stanford trumpets its
ethnic diversity. An editorial on how some
aspect of "diversity" at Stanford is "good"
— without ever defining why or what kind
of diversity — runs practically ever week,
and the University has been seen bragging
that it is ranked as one of the top schools
for African Americans in a recent maga
zine survey. Anyone who has been a stu
dent at Stanford knows that what this
means in practice is that many minorities,
not just African Americans, keep to them
selves. In other words, affirmative action
was designed to integrate, but the upshot
at Stanford has been a large degree of self
segregation.
As for the technicalities of the policy,
with both Hopwood v.the UT-Austin
Board of Regents and the current UM
case, the explicit weightings in the point
based admissions policies are truly as
tounding. Who knew that being an attrac
tive minority could net you 20 points out
of 150 point maximum, when perfect SAT
scores pulled in a paltry 12 points or a
spectacular essay merited less than a tele
com stock dividend at 3 points? Similar
point values for race and LSATs were
leaked by UT-Austin. law professor and
admissions committee member Lino
Gralia six years ago in the Hopwood case.
On a gut level, these sorts of cold calcula
tions, particularly ones that prefer race to
merit by at least a factor of two, seem to
perpetuate the instit utionalization of race
while at the same time removing rewards,
and thus incentives, for middle- and
upper-class minority candidates to per
form at as high a level as they can.
With that said, the brief filed by the
Bush administration on the case is equally
flawed. Unlike most anti-war protesters,
the Bush brief at least tries to provide a
better policy alternative in the form of
race-less guaranteed admission policy for
state schools based on class rank champi
oned by Bush when he was governor (i.e.,
the top 10 percent in Texas). However, as
with much of the Bush presidency, if we
don't watch out, the entire country might
begin to look like Texas. Much of the suc
cess of the class-rank admissions policy in
restoring minorities into Texas state
schools post-Hopwood has been due to


Alex Greninger &
Tim Meyer
the incredible segregation of Texas high
schools. The class-rank admissions policy
has also created some interesting policy
options lor Texas high schools. Alex's high
school was profiled in The Wall Street
Journal for editing iis "class ranking" sys
tem such that it was no longer a rank. In
stead, if you achieved, say a 3.5 CPA, you
were automatically in the top 10 percent
and guaranteed a ticket to UT-Austin —
although in some years 13 percent or
more of a class might be in the "top 10 per
cent." An excelling high school is essen
tially forced to adopt ihis policy because
the state universities cannot accommodate
the top 10 percent of all Texas high school
students. Thus, finishing outside the top

10 percent essentially meant one would
not be accepted to the state universities.
These point-based admission systems
combined with Bush's top "x" percent ad
missions policy tell a damning story of the
nation's secondary school education sys
tem, largely under the jurisdiction of state
governments. In the wake of any
Supreme Court decision (although we're
positing they'll fall on Bush's side) any re
form of aflirmative action, and it is need
ed, must be accompanied by an overhaul
of the nation's elementary and secondary
education system. Without giving all stu
dents, regardless of race or socioeconomic
background, the chance to succeed at all
levels, there is no hope of resolving de
bates about merit versus categorization.

Tim Meyer and Alex Greninger don't think
they've even come close to addressing this issue in
5000 characters or less. E-mail them at tlmey
