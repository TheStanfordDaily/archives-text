'U.S. military is perhaps the world's
greatest defender or gay rights'

The Daily's editorial against the effort
to bring ROTC to campus makes some
good points concerning the military's dis
crimination against homosexuals ("ROTC
does not live up to University's standards,"
Jan. 17). Indeed, this is an embarrassment
fora nation that prides itself on the de
fense of pluralism and equal rights. Yet,
we must take into consideration the fact
that our soldiers are putting their lives on
the line to defend the freedoms and liber
ties of all Americans of all colors, creeds
and sexual orientations. Given the current
state of the world, the U.S. military is, per
haps, the world's greatest defender of gay
rights.
The military does deserve reproach for
its failings, but decency requires some
show of respect and gratitude from a na
tion that takes for granted the freedoms
and liberties that so many of our soldiers
have given their lives to protect.

ROTC revival not a 'partisan issue'
In response to Mr. Lehnert's letter to
the editor ("ROTC editorial reflects a
'general ignorance,'" Jan. 21). I must
commend him on his last four para
graphs: He puts lot th facts and informa
tion that is not heard often enough on this
campus. Additionally, 1 agree personally,
for the most part, with the views he ex
pressed in his letter.
At the same time, I'd like to comment
on a couple of his points concerning the
Stanford College Republicans in his first

three paragraphs as I am the president of
the organization. My organization is fully
aware that those in the military are not
strictly Republican or conservative. We
understand that there is a range of views
within the military. This is the way it
should be.
We undertook this cause of fighting
for the return of ROTC not in the name
of partisanship, but because it is a noble
and worthy cause for which nobody on
this campus was fighting.
The members of ROTC are instructed
to not get involved in the promoting of
their cause on this campus by the mili
tary. Therein, they needed someone else
to spearhead this effort for them, and we
felt it was an honorable cause for which
to light.
Additionally, contrary to his state
ment that we are ignorant of current mil
itary culture, I believe "personally that 1
might have a better perspective on this
than most other Stanford students. My
father is Class of 1975 from West Point
and was a member of the 82nd Airborne.
I grew up for the first 21 years of my life
with my father stationed at Fort Sam
Houston in San Antonio, Texas. My fa
ther left the military as a Lieutenant
Colonel after 13 years of service and took
a job where close to half of his co-workers
are ex-military in Charlotte, N.C. In that
time in the military, 1 was given a deep
sense of military life that has shaped the
person that I am. It also gave me the op
portunity to the see the consequences of
war firsthand as many of my playmates'
fathers were sent over to Operation
Desert Storm. I will never forget greet
ing the troops as they returned from
Iraq at Kelly Air Force Base and the San
Antonio Airport.
Lehnert probably has a more cur

rent view of the military culture than I
do since his father is a Marine Corps
Officer now deployed to the Middle
East. I hope he understands that I am
trying to instill in my members, with
the help of a couple of former and cur
rent members of ROTC in my organi
zation, a sense of current military cul
ture. I hope he also understands that I
do not intend to make this a partisan
issue and am more than willing to ac
cept any help on this cause from any
other group on campus.

'Academic freedom' should be applied
â™¦o Hoover as well
On Thursday, a guest column ap
peared in The Daily suggesting that Stan
ford remain consistent in its policy on ac a
demic freedom and hold all institutions to
the same standard ("Is the Hoover Insti
tute compatible with Stanford's goals,"
Jan. 16). This article provoked several let
ters that pointed out the resources avail
able within Stanford's Hoover Institution.
As many of us who have used the
archives and who maintain contact with
Hoover fellows know, Hoover's archives
provide incredible resources to visiting
scholars and to students. Many of us are
very grateful for the resources housed in
the tower and would not dream of "criti
cizfing] one of the finest assets the Univer
sity has to offer its students," as stated in
Jon Dunn's letter to the editor. ("Student's
should be grateful for Hoover," Jan. 17).
