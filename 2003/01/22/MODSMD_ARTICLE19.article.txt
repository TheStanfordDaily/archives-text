'U.S. military is perhaps the world's
greatest defender or gay rights'

The Daily's editorial against the effort
to bring ROTC to campus makes some
good points concerning the military's dis
crimination against homosexuals ("ROTC
does not live up to University's standards,"
Jan. 17). Indeed, this is an embarrassment
fora nation that prides itself on the de
fense of pluralism and equal rights. Yet,
we must take into consideration the fact
that our soldiers are putting their lives on
the line to defend the freedoms and liber
ties of all Americans of all colors, creeds
and sexual orientations. Given the current
state of the world, the U.S. military is, per
haps, the world's greatest defender of gay
rights.
The military does deserve reproach for
its failings, but decency requires some
show of respect and gratitude from a na
tion that takes for granted the freedoms
and liberties that so many of our soldiers
have given their lives to protect.

ROTC revival not a 'partisan issue'
In response to Mr. Lehnert's letter to
the editor ("ROTC editorial reflects a
'general ignorance,'" Jan. 21). I must
commend him on his last four para
graphs: He puts lot th facts and informa
tion that is not heard often enough on this
campus. Additionally, 1 agree personally,
for the most part, with the views he ex
pressed in his letter.
At the same time, I'd like to comment
on a couple of his points concerning the
Stanford College Republicans in his first

three paragraphs as I am the president of
the organization. My organization is fully
aware that those in the military are not
strictly Republican or conservative. We
understand that there is a range of views
within the military. This is the way it
should be.
We undertook this cause of fighting
for the return of ROTC not in the name
of partisanship, but because it is a noble
and worthy cause for which nobody on
this campus was fighting.
The members of ROTC are instructed
to not get involved in the promoting of
their cause on this campus by the mili
tary. Therein, they needed someone else
to spearhead this effort for them, and we
felt it was an honorable cause for which
to light.
Additionally, contrary to his state
ment that we are ignorant of current mil
itary culture, I believe "personally that 1
might have a better perspective on this
than most other Stanford students. My
father is Class of 1975 from West Point
and was a member of the 82nd Airborne.
I grew up for the first 21 years of my life
with my father stationed at Fort Sam
Houston in San Antonio, Texas. My fa
ther left the military as a Lieutenant
Colonel after 13 years of service and took
a job where close to half of his co-workers
are ex-military in Charlotte, N.C. In that
time in the military, 1 was given a deep
sense of military life that has shaped the
person that I am. It also gave me the op
portunity to the see the consequences of
war firsthand as many of my playmates'
fathers were sent over to Operation
Desert Storm. I will never forget greet
ing the troops as they returned from
Iraq at Kelly Air Force Base and the San
Antonio Airport.
Lehnert probably has a more cur

rent view of the military culture than I
do since his father is a Marine Corps
Officer now deployed to the Middle
East. I hope he understands that I am
trying to instill in my members, with
the help of a couple of former and cur
rent members of ROTC in my organi
zation, a sense of current military cul
ture. I hope he also understands that I
do not intend to make this a partisan
issue and am more than willing to ac
cept any help on this cause from any
other group on campus.

'Academic freedom' should be applied
♦o Hoover as well
On Thursday, a guest column ap
peared in The Daily suggesting that Stan
ford remain consistent in its policy on ac a
demic freedom and hold all institutions to
the same standard ("Is the Hoover Insti
tute compatible with Stanford's goals,"
Jan. 16). This article provoked several let
ters that pointed out the resources avail
able within Stanford's Hoover Institution.
As many of us who have used the
archives and who maintain contact with
Hoover fellows know, Hoover's archives
provide incredible resources to visiting
scholars and to students. Many of us are
very grateful for the resources housed in
the tower and would not dream of "criti
cizfing] one of the finest assets the Univer
sity has to offer its students," as stated in
Jon Dunn's letter to the editor. ("Student's
should be grateful for Hoover," Jan. 17).
The resources housed at Hoover should
certainly remain where they currently are
— under the auspices of Stanford Univer
sity. This is, however, not the issue at
hand.
What is at issue is Stanford's policy on
academic freedom that states: "Decisions
concerning. . . the search for, and ap
pointment of, faculty... [and] the support
and sponsorship of scholarly research. . .
shall be made without regard to a person's
political, social or other views" (Section 2.3
of Stanford's Research Policy Handbook).
Is Stanford's policy a good policy?
Some seem do have their doubts. Ernest
Tedeschi's letter noted the risk of losing
"ideological diversity" if Stanford's policy
was applied uniformly (" 'Proud liberal'
alum appreciates diversity Hoover brings
to campus," Jan. 17). It's certainly true
that exempting certain departments or in
stitutions from Stanford's policy on aca
demic freedom would pave the road for
"ideological diversity" at Stanford. But
this only brings us back to the question of
whether such a move would be wise.
Should political and social views be con
sidered alongside scholarly work? Should
any part of Stanford be guided by a politi
cal mission statement?
Would Stanford be better off if the So
ciology Department could consider a

prospective professor's social views before
hiring him or her? Should the History De
partment be allowed to weigh a candi
date's commitment to "limiting govern
ment intrusion into the lives of individu
als" alongside their scholarly work? Some
students would undoubtedly feel more
comfortable at Stanford if they could work
within a department whose mission re
flected their social or political views.
If, however, you believe that scholars
should be evaluated without regard to
their political and social views, now is the
time to demand from the administration
that Stanford apply its policy on academic
freedom consistently to all institutions
housed on Stanford campus, 1 loover in
cluded.

Students can 'make if for two days'
without custodians
After reading about Stanford's new ini
tiative to respond to student complaints of
weekend disorder and disrepair in dorms
by extending University custodians' hours
into the weekend, I was left with a set of
mixed emotions that tended more toward
negative reactions of cynicism than to any
positive feelings of satisfaction or relief
("Dorm custodians to work weekends,"
Jan. 8). While it shows great responsiveness
on the part of Housing and Dining Services
to respond to consistent student complaints

about dorm cleanliness, I cannot help but
believe that this extra burden should not be
falling on the shoulders of those people
who already spend live days out of their
week cleaning up after us students.
Alter living in all-freshman and all
sophomore dorms during my first two
years at Stanford, I was often very elated to
see that a mess that someone had careless
ly strewn about and leli behind had been
cleared away. Alter living in a co-op fora
year and a half, however, it has become
blatantly clear to me that students (lAN
clean up after themselves, and that they
act more responsibly in social spaces when
they know that they themselves, or a
housemate, will have to clean up that
space should it be left in a bad state. The
responsibility to keep our living spaces
clean during the weekend, however, be
longs to us, and not to people who proba
bly have countless other things that they
would rather do on the weekend, such as
spend time with their families or do any
thing not having to do with cleaning up
after college students.
Emergency services are available on the
weekends for occasions when a profes
sional cleaning is quickly needed, but I
truly believe that if students were more
thoughtful and deliberate in their actions
and how they impact other people outside
of their dorm, they could make it for two
days without having their floors mopped
and their paper towel trash emptied.
