## Card's $2 million kid picks Farm over pros 
### 
First things first: I've had
an excellent experience
at Stanford that I would
not trade for four years
at any other institution in the
nation.
And now, I pose a question:
What was John Mayberry, Jr.
thinking?
Now that the 6-foot-5, 215-
pound all-world prospect is
liere, it's safe to write this with
out scaring him off — profes
sional baseball can't touch him
for three more years. He's wear
ing Cardinal for the next three

seasons, and
don't think
Mike Gillespie
hasn't noticed
down at South
ern California.
But while
Mayberry now
practices at
Sunken Dia-

mond, rides his bike between
classes everyday and dines at
Stern Hall, mustn't he wonder
what he would be doing right
now with, say, $2 million?
That's the amount the kid,
who celebrated his 19th birthday
in December, reportedly turned
down from the Seattle Mariners
as the 28th pick of the 2002
Major League Baseball Draft.
That's $2 million. Hard cash,
if he would have asked for it.
That's a high school diploma in
one hand and two million bills in
the other.
If it's me, I'm asking where to
sign. According to Baseball
America, Mayberry was asking
fora 50-percent raise.
"The opportunity was just
too good to pass up," he says as
he expounds upon the virtues of
our fine and proud university.
"Stanford is a great institution;
it's one of the most prestigious
universities in the world. On top
of that you have one of the
perennial powerhouses in col
lege baseball. For me, Stanford
was just the place to be."
Yes, John, that's all nice and
true. But did you forget the part
about $2 million?
Apparently, he has. The
freshman, an absolute specimen
with physical gifts and a baseball
mind inherited from his father
— a former Major Leaguer —
swears he hasn't looked back one
bit since arriving on campus.
"The program is all that I
could have ever wanted," he
said. "Coach [Mark] Marquess
does a great job getting every

body to improve and reach their
potential. I'm very happy with
how things have gone in the fall
and thus far this winter."
What a kid. While it's one
thing for middle-aged sports
commentators to sit back and
criticize young athletes for tak
ing the money instead of mak
ing a commitment to a college
education, it's quite another to
be 19 and tearing up $2 million
checks in your name. And our
new first baseman did just that.
Of course, "Junior" is the
only 19-year-old athlete I've
seen use the word "behoove"
without batting an eyelash, so
maybe we shouldn't be all that
surprised. Show me a 19-year
old using "behoove" in his first
college interview, and I'll show
you a kid that would turn down
$2 million to attend Stanford
University.
That's how special Mayberry
is and also may turn out to be.
Though we'll need three
years to determine whether
Mayberry made the right call —
he could, in fact, improve his
draft status in 2005 and emerge
a much richer and much more
prepared young man — it's hard
to say that it's a sure-fire win. The
risk of injury and of rule changes
in the draft are legitimate con
cerns that would have had me
driving to Wells Fargo with
Mariners General Manager Pat
Gillick riding shotgun.
But Mayberry politely said,
"Thanks but no thanks," bought
his books and left Kansas City
for Palo Alto instead of the rook
ie league. By the way, the re
cruiting job by Marquess and his
staff must be acknowledged, for
first-rounders are almost always
pipe dreams for college pro
grams.
"Junior" will not be the Car
dinal's hero right away, but he
certainly has the potential to be
come Stanford's most celebrat
ed diamond star in the school's
history.
No matter what Mayberry ac
complishes at Sunken Diamond
in his career, I'm already sold on
the kid.
But some three-run homers
this season wouldn't hurt.
Brett Kaufman is a senior majoring
in international relations and
Spanish. He'd like to point out that
$2 million could pay for more than
150 quarters at Stanford Universi
ty. E-mail him at bkaufman@stan
ford.edu.

maybe we shouldn't be all that
surprised. Show me a 19-year
old using "behoove" in his first
college interview, and I'll show
you a kid that would turn down
$2 million to attend Stanford
University.
That's how special Mayberry
is and also may turn out to be.
Though we'll need three
years to determine whether
Mayberry made the right call —
he could, in fact, improve his
draft status in 2005 and emerge
a much richer and much more
prepared young man — it's hard
to say that it's a sure-fire win. The
risk of injury and of rule changes
in the draft are legitimate con
cerns that would have had me
driving to Wells Fargo with
Mariners General Manager Pat
Gillick riding shotgun.
But Mayberry politely said,
"Thanks but no thanks," bought
his books and left Kansas City
for Palo Alto instead of the rook
ie league. By the way, the re
cruiting job by Marquess and his
staff must be acknowledged, for
first-rounders are almost always
pipe dreams for college pro
grams.
"Junior" will not be the Car
dinal's hero right away, but he
certainly has the potential to be
come Stanford's most celebrat
ed diamond star in the school's
history.
No matter what Mayberry ac
complishes at Sunken Diamond
in his career, I'm already sold on
the kid.
But some three-run homers
this season wouldn't hurt.
Brett Kaufman is a senior majoring
in international relations and
Spanish. He'd like to point out that
$2 million could pay for more than
150 quarters at Stanford Universi
ty. E-mail him at bkaufman@stan
