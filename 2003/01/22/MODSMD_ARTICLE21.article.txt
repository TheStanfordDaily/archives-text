# Baseball set for 5th straight Omaha run

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senior catcher Ryan Garko
wasn't supposed to be here this win
ter. If things had gone perfectly,
about now he would be celebrating
his early fall graduation, working
out near his home and preparing to
enter a new life of cramped buses,
small towns and even smaller pay
checks as a professional baseball
player.
Instead, Garko leaves Sunken
Diamond after dark every evening,
still donning the same Cardinal
practice jersey he's worn for four
years. He's still catching bullpens
after practice, still taking extra
swings in the Stanford batting cages
and still taking heat from head
coach Mark Marquess during post
practice clean-up. After watching
40 entire rounds pass by last June
without hearing his name called in
the Major League Baseball First-
Year Player Draft, he's back.
"At first it was very frustrating,"
Garko said. "But it's great to be
back. I wasn't ready to leave last
year."
Bolstered by a something-to
prove attitude that is neither phony
nor overstated, Garko has trans
formed the disappointment of
going undrafted after his junior
campaign into confidence and ex

citement about leading one of the
nation's most storied collegiate
sports programs in its quest for an
unprecedented fifth consecutive
College World Series appearance.
Garko leads offensive charge
The Cardinal enters the 2003
season with its perennial high
hopes, basking in a No. 3 preseason
ranking and touting the presence
of Ail-Americans past, present and
— most interestingly — even some
in waiting. With four seniors back, a
talented junior class eager to step to
the forefront and outstanding
depth around the field, a fifth
straight trip to Omaha and the
school's first Pacific-10 Conference
title since 2000 are both within the
Cardinal's grasp.
Leading this year's group will be
Garko, thrust into that role by pro
fessional baseball's cold shoulder
last June. If Garko can improve on
his outstanding 2002 statistics and
thereby shed the first word from his
three-year moniker — "Budding
Superstar" — the media darling's
Bay Area coverage is sure to ex
pand.
"There've been so many Stan
ford guys that came back for their
senior year, from [John] Gall to
[Chris] O'Riordan, and I knew I'd
