# Baseball set for 5th straight Omaha run

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senior catcher Ryan Garko
wasn't supposed to be here this win
ter. If things had gone perfectly,
about now he would be celebrating
his early fall graduation, working
out near his home and preparing to
enter a new life of cramped buses,
small towns and even smaller pay
checks as a professional baseball
player.
Instead, Garko leaves Sunken
Diamond after dark every evening,
still donning the same Cardinal
practice jersey he's worn for four
years. He's still catching bullpens
after practice, still taking extra
swings in the Stanford batting cages
and still taking heat from head
coach Mark Marquess during post
practice clean-up. After watching
40 entire rounds pass by last June
without hearing his name called in
the Major League Baseball First-
Year Player Draft, he's back.
"At first it was very frustrating,"
Garko said. "But it's great to be
back. I wasn't ready to leave last
year."
Bolstered by a something-to
prove attitude that is neither phony
nor overstated, Garko has trans
formed the disappointment of
going undrafted after his junior
campaign into confidence and ex

citement about leading one of the
nation's most storied collegiate
sports programs in its quest for an
unprecedented fifth consecutive
College World Series appearance.
Garko leads offensive charge
The Cardinal enters the 2003
season with its perennial high
hopes, basking in a No. 3 preseason
ranking and touting the presence
of Ail-Americans past, present and
— most interestingly — even some
in waiting. With four seniors back, a
talented junior class eager to step to
the forefront and outstanding
depth around the field, a fifth
straight trip to Omaha and the
school's first Pacific-10 Conference
title since 2000 are both within the
Cardinal's grasp.
Leading this year's group will be
Garko, thrust into that role by pro
fessional baseball's cold shoulder
last June. If Garko can improve on
his outstanding 2002 statistics and
thereby shed the first word from his
three-year moniker — "Budding
Superstar" — the media darling's
Bay Area coverage is sure to ex
pand.
"There've been so many Stan
ford guys that came back for their
senior year, from [John] Gall to
[Chris] O'Riordan, and I knew I'd


ANNA CHRISTINA DOUGIAS/The Stanford Daily
be tine," Garko said. "Part of me
was really happy when it hap
pened. I know my turn will come;
it's just going to come a year later."
Garko looks to match his pre
season second-team All-American
billing by building on a solid junior
season, one that saw him start 01 of
65 games behind the plate tor the
Cardinal. The senior batted .314
with 14 home runs and 55 runs bat
ted in and will be one of the offen
sive centerpieces of this year's Stan
ford team.
Garko's spot behind the dish is
far from secure, however, with two
solid backups ready tor spot duty in
a position that Marquess says "has
never been better" in his 27 years as
head coach.
Sophomore Donny Lucy,
ranked the top 2004 catching
prospect out of the West by Baseball
America, will see time either
spelling Garko or in the designated
hitler role. Most see the athletic
Lucy as a better defensive backstop
than Garko, and solid offensive per
formance could lead to more starts
behind the plate with Garko mov
ing to DH. Behind Lucy is one of a
host of talented freshmen, John
Hester, who played well through
out the fall to push for at-bats and
who could be used as a late-inning
defensive replacement.
Deep lineup made deeper by
talented freshmen
Garko and Lucy's bats will be
aided by those of two All-American
juniors, outfielders Sam Fulcl and
Carlos Quentin. Fuld sets to begin a
potential Player of the Year cam
paign after an All-American season
last year in which he hit .375,
pushed .400 in conference games,
drove in 47 runs and stole eight
bases.
Quentin is a two-time All-Pac-10
selection who belted 12 home runs
last season, a mark that should be

cracked it he maintains his health.
The junior bore the brunt of 19 hit
by-pitches last year, setting the
Stanford single-season mark and
setting an NCAA record when
Florida State pitchers beaned him
five times in a single game last Feb
ruary.
The surprise of seeing Garko be
hind the plate for the Cardinal this
year may be matched only by that
accompanying the 6-foot-5 frame
of freshman John Mayberry, Jr. at
first base. When the Seattle
Mariners selected Mayberry, the
son of a tormer Major Leaguer,
with the 28th pick of the 2002 draft,
he dropped oft most Cardinal tans'
wish lists lor 2003, despite his verbal
commitment to Stanford.
However, Mayberry spurned
the Mariners' reported $2 million
plus offer and chose to come play
for Marquess in a move that surely
will delight the Sunken Diamond
faithful for the next three years.
Due to a shoulder injury that will
sideline sophomore Chris Carter
for at least 15 games, Mayberry will
get a good look at first base with his
raw athletic tools and outstanding
makeup. If "Junior" lives up to his
hype early on, Carter may find left
field his 2003 destination.
The remainder of the lineup is
less certain, with many players
vying for at-bats all around the dia
mond. While junior Brian Hall, se
nior Tobin Swope and junior John
ny Ash should till out the rest of the
opening day infield lineup from left
to right, they will be tested for their
spots by an impressive freshman
group that includes Chris Lewis,
Jed Lowrie and Chris Minaker.
Hall — the team's best base run
ner and thief of 14 bases in as many
attempts last season in limited ac
tion — looks to bounce back from
off-season shoulder surgery and to
fully realize the potential of which
he's shown flashes during his two
years at Stanford.
"Brian Hall has really helped
our ballclub each of the last two sea
sons and this year he has an excel
lent opportunity to emerge as one

of our leaders," said Marquess.
Staff looks to maintain dominance
Finally, a deep but young pitch
ing staff will try to overcome the key
loss of Jeremy Guthrie, the Cardi
nal's former go-to guy that piled up
26 victories the last two seasons. Se
nior Tim Cunningham and junior
John Hudgins will battle it out at
the top of the rotation, each coming
of! 10-win campaigns as weekend
starters. Neither has found the con
sistency expected of Stanford's top
starter yet in their careers, but one
must emerge as a dominant mound
leader if the Cardinal is to enjoy its
usual amount of success this season.
The third starting role undoubt
edly will be "TBA" each Sunday for
at least a month, as Marquess plans
to use many of his young arms in
limited innings as the season be
gins. The top candidates to take
hold of the role are sophomore
Mark Jecmen and senior Ryan Mc-
Cally. Jecmen certainly has the
physical tools to start, but in order
to do so he must shake off a rough
freshman season (0-4, 8.26 KRA)
and fulfill the promise that he
brought to Sunken Diamond last
season.
McCally led Stanford's bullpen
last season and may be too valuable
there to remove him from that role.
Waiting behind those two are fresh
man Mark Romanczuk and junior
Di ew Erlich, who will both pitch in
relief regularly as the season moves
forward.
A final option could be Kodiak
Quick, a freshman righthander
that uses a 3 / 4 delivery, gets excel
lent movement on his pitches and
has impressed everyone in fall and
winter practice.
With depth throughout the line
up and rotation, Marquess has an
array of talent at his disposal as the
Cardinal opens the 2003 season. A
fifth straight College World Series
appearance will put Garko and the
rest of the Stanford team back in
Omaha, and that should make all
the bus rides and small towns in the
world worth the wait.

fully realize the potential of which
he's shown flashes during his two
years at Stanford.
"Brian Hall has really helped
our ballclub each of the last two sea
sons and this year he has an excel
lent opportunity to emerge as one

of our leaders," said Marquess.
Staff looks to maintain dominance
Finally, a deep but young pitch
ing staff will try to overcome the key
loss of Jeremy Guthrie, the Cardi
nal's former go-to guy that piled up
26 victories the last two seasons. Se
nior Tim Cunningham and junior
John Hudgins will battle it out at
the top of the rotation, each coming
of! 10-win campaigns as weekend
starters. Neither has found the con
sistency expected of Stanford's top
starter yet in their careers, but one
must emerge as a dominant mound
leader if the Cardinal is to enjoy its
usual amount of success this season.
The third starting role undoubt
edly will be "TBA" each Sunday for
at least a month, as Marquess plans
to use many of his young arms in
limited innings as the season be
gins. The top candidates to take
hold of the role are sophomore
Mark Jecmen and senior Ryan Mc-
Cally. Jecmen certainly has the
physical tools to start, but in order
to do so he must shake off a rough
freshman season (0-4, 8.26 KRA)
and fulfill the promise that he
brought to Sunken Diamond last
season.
McCally led Stanford's bullpen
last season and may be too valuable
there to remove him from that role.
Waiting behind those two are fresh
man Mark Romanczuk and junior
Di ew Erlich, who will both pitch in
relief regularly as the season moves
forward.
A final option could be Kodiak
Quick, a freshman righthander
that uses a 3 / 4 delivery, gets excel
lent movement on his pitches and
has impressed everyone in fall and
winter practice.
With depth throughout the line
up and rotation, Marquess has an
array of talent at his disposal as the
Cardinal opens the 2003 season. A
fifth straight College World Series
appearance will put Garko and the
rest of the Stanford team back in
Omaha, and that should make all
the bus rides and small towns in the
world worth the wait.
Senior catcher Ryan Garko
wasn't supposed to be here this win
ter. If things had gone perfectly,
about now he would be celebrating
his early fall graduation, working
out near his home and preparing to
enter a new life of cramped buses,
small towns and even smaller pay
checks as a professional baseball
player.
Instead, Garko leaves Sunken
Diamond after dark every evening,
still donning the same Cardinal
practice jersey he's worn for four
years. He's still catching bullpens
after practice, still taking extra
swings in the Stanford batting cages
and still taking heat from head
coach Mark Marquess during post
practice clean-up. After watching
40 entire rounds pass by last June
without hearing his name called in
the Major League Baseball First-
Year Player Draft, he's back.
"At first it was very frustrating,"
Garko said. "But it's great to be
back. I wasn't ready to leave last
year."
Bolstered by a something-to
prove attitude that is neither phony
nor overstated, Garko has trans
formed the disappointment of
going undrafted after his junior
campaign into confidence and ex

citement about leading one of the
nation's most storied collegiate
sports programs in its quest for an
unprecedented fifth consecutive
College World Series appearance.
Garko leads offensive charge
The Cardinal enters the 2003
season with its perennial high
hopes, basking in a No. 3 preseason
ranking and touting the presence
of Ail-Americans past, present and
— most interestingly — even some
in waiting. With four seniors back, a
talented junior class eager to step to
the forefront and outstanding
depth around the field, a fifth
straight trip to Omaha and the
school's first Pacific-10 Conference
title since 2000 are both within the
Cardinal's grasp.
Leading this year's group will be
Garko, thrust into that role by pro
fessional baseball's cold shoulder
last June. If Garko can improve on
his outstanding 2002 statistics and
thereby shed the first word from his
three-year moniker — "Budding
Superstar" — the media darling's
Bay Area coverage is sure to ex
pand.
"There've been so many Stan
ford guys that came back for their
senior year, from [John] Gall to
[Chris] O'Riordan, and I knew I'd


ANNA CHRISTINA DOUGIAS/The Stanford Daily
be tine," Garko said. "Part of me
was really happy when it hap
pened. I know my turn will come;
it's just going to come a year later."
Garko looks to match his pre
season second-team All-American
billing by building on a solid junior
season, one that saw him start 01 of
65 games behind the plate tor the
Cardinal. The senior batted .314
with 14 home runs and 55 runs bat
ted in and will be one of the offen
sive centerpieces of this year's Stan
ford team.
Garko's spot behind the dish is
far from secure, however, with two
solid backups ready tor spot duty in
a position that Marquess says "has
never been better" in his 27 years as
head coach.
Sophomore Donny Lucy,
ranked the top 2004 catching
prospect out of the West by Baseball
America, will see time either
spelling Garko or in the designated
hitler role. Most see the athletic
Lucy as a better defensive backstop
than Garko, and solid offensive per
formance could lead to more starts
behind the plate with Garko mov
ing to DH. Behind Lucy is one of a
host of talented freshmen, John
Hester, who played well through
out the fall to push for at-bats and
who could be used as a late-inning
defensive replacement.
Deep lineup made deeper by
talented freshmen
Garko and Lucy's bats will be
aided by those of two All-American
juniors, outfielders Sam Fulcl and
Carlos Quentin. Fuld sets to begin a
potential Player of the Year cam
paign after an All-American season
last year in which he hit .375,
pushed .400 in conference games,
drove in 47 runs and stole eight
bases.
Quentin is a two-time All-Pac-10
selection who belted 12 home runs
last season, a mark that should be

cracked it he maintains his health.
The junior bore the brunt of 19 hit
by-pitches last year, setting the
Stanford single-season mark and
setting an NCAA record when
Florida State pitchers beaned him
five times in a single game last Feb
ruary.
The surprise of seeing Garko be
hind the plate for the Cardinal this
year may be matched only by that
accompanying the 6-foot-5 frame
of freshman John Mayberry, Jr. at
first base. When the Seattle
Mariners selected Mayberry, the
son of a tormer Major Leaguer,
with the 28th pick of the 2002 draft,
he dropped oft most Cardinal tans'
wish lists lor 2003, despite his verbal
commitment to Stanford.
However, Mayberry spurned
the Mariners' reported $2 million
plus offer and chose to come play
for Marquess in a move that surely
will delight the Sunken Diamond
faithful for the next three years.
Due to a shoulder injury that will
sideline sophomore Chris Carter
for at least 15 games, Mayberry will
get a good look at first base with his
raw athletic tools and outstanding
makeup. If "Junior" lives up to his
hype early on, Carter may find left
field his 2003 destination.
The remainder of the lineup is
less certain, with many players
vying for at-bats all around the dia
mond. While junior Brian Hall, se
nior Tobin Swope and junior John
ny Ash should till out the rest of the
opening day infield lineup from left
to right, they will be tested for their
spots by an impressive freshman
group that includes Chris Lewis,
Jed Lowrie and Chris Minaker.
Hall — the team's best base run
ner and thief of 14 bases in as many
attempts last season in limited ac
tion — looks to bounce back from
off-season shoulder surgery and to
fully realize the potential of which
he's shown flashes during his two

"Brian Hall has really helped
