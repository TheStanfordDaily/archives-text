# Hudgins ready for prime-time gig on staff

### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last year's Stanford baseball media guide
had "Omaha" emblazoned over a picture of the
team, with Ail-American hurler Jeremy
Guthrie at the center.
It may have seemed a tad pretentious —
proclaiming the site of the College World Se
ries to be the Cardinal's destination before the
first pitch of the season was thrown — but in
the end it was right on target, as Guthrie led
Stanford to its fourth consecutive appearance
in the CWS.
However, this year, Guthrie is gone — after
being drafted in the first round by the Cleve
land Indians — leaving the Cardinal to rely on
its two remaining starters, junior John Hudgins
and senior Tim Cunningham, to fill in
Guthrie's huge cleats and bring Stanford back
to Omaha for the fifth straight year.
Ironically, with Sunken Diamond's most re
cent national championship Hag having been
raised in 1988, the Cardinal is actually in some
what of a championship drought despite all of
its trips to the CWS.
Last year's starting rotation of now-departed
Guthrie, current junior Hudgins and senior
Cunningham propelled the Cardinal to a 47-8
overall record and a fourth-place finish at the
CWS.

"Jeremy was (he team leader, and we all
looked up to him and tried to emulate what he
was doing," Hudgins said. "Every time out of
the gate he was 100 percent and dominated al
most every single outing — and that set the
tone for the rest of the weekend."
Though undoubtedly the team's ace,
Guthrie was by no means the Cardinal's only
star hurler. Hudgins had the best win-loss per
centage on the Cardinal staff last season (.909)
and this year will be asked to help fill the void
left by Guthrie.
Hudgins will begin this season as either the
Friday or Saturday starter — a change from his
Sunday position last year — which means he
will be squaring off against opposing teams'
aces. This will be no minor task, considering the
great depth of pitching talent in the Pacific-10
Conference.
"It's true that for every day you move up in
the weekend rotation, the opposing pitcher be
comes a more difficult challenge," Hudgins
said. "At the same, that's really what I want. I
want to be facing the other team's best pitchers
because I like the competition."
Judging from his performances last year,
Hudgins will be up to the task as a competitor
who thrives under pressure. Hudgins has con
sistently delivered when pitching in tight
spots. His ability to escape from innings with
runners on base, his three complete games

and one shutout and his win over Notre Dame
in the CW r S all exemplify a cool head and
steady presence.
Like any pitcher, Hudgins' success on the
mound depends in large part on a solid de
fense. Aside from nasty movement on his
breaking pitches and a change-up that has
batters falling forward with mistimed swings,
last year Hudgins had arguably the nation's
best defensive infield at his back.
Every starting infielder from last season has
moved on, but Hudgins has full confidence that
this year's regulars will be able to continue the
tradition of spectacular defense that the Cardi
nal has displayed in recent years.
"Aside from the loss of Guthrie, [the loss of
last year's infielders] is probably our biggest
question mark," Hudgins said. "Rut [coach
Mark] Marquess usually does a really good job
of making sure guys don't make errors. He
makes sure we have a good infield no matter
who's out there, so I'm not really concerned
about a lack of defensive support."
W r ith a new infield, a pitching staff reform
ing itself after the loss of Guthrie and large
class of talented freshmen, the Cardinal is no
doubt a very different team than it was last
year. But with veteran stars like Hudgins to
lead the way, a fifth consecutive Omaha ap
pearance by the Cardinal should surprise no
one.
