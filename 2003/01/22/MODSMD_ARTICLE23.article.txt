# Split tennis squad shines in Vegas, Seattle
## Younger players solid at National Collegiate; elders strong at Pac-10s 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With two events on its schedule
last weekend, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team found itself
broken in two. But the collective re
sults of the split squads did plenty
to reaffirm that the Cardinal will be
a threat to everyone when its all to
gether for the dual-match season.
A group of Stanford players
turned in strong showings at the
National Collegiate Women's Ten
nis Classic in Las Vegas, while the
rest of the squad led the way at the
Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Championships in Washington.
In Nevada, the Cardinal's im
pressive group of young talent was
on display as several of Stanford's
youngest competitors came home
with more than their share of wins
in their pockets.
Freshman Amber Liu led the
way, advancing to the singles finals
with three consecutive victories be
fore being defeated by fourth
ranked Vilmarie Castellvi of Ten
nessee 6-4, 6-3.

Liu reached the finals by taking
down Agata Cioroch of Georgia —
a 7-5, 7-6 winner over Stanford
sophomore Erin Burdette in the
quarters — in the semifinals.
Fellow Cardinal freshman Alice
Barnes was also set fora big show
ing, advancing to the semifinals.
Freshman Joanna Kao was not
left out of Stanford's young surge.
She advanced to the finals of the
consolation backdraw tournament
before losing to Kelly Nelson of
Notre Dame, 7-5, 3-6, 1-0(10-7).
"It was a very good tournament
for the four players who went to
Las Vegas," said head coach Lele
Forood. "Amber obviously got to
the finals and played very well,
while Alice played very well, and
lost to the girl who won the tour
nament last year and won it again
this year. Erin had a good close
match with the No. 1 girl in the
country, and Joanna got a lot of ex
perience playing four matches."
Hundreds of miles away in
Seattle, five other Cardinal players
competed in the Pac-10 Indoor
Championships, keeping solidari
ty with their Vegas compatriots
with a successful weekend of their
own.
Junior Lauren Barnikow was
the most impressive of the Cardi
nal players, advancing to the finals

of the first-flight singles competi
tion before succumbing to both fa
tigue and strong competition in a
6-3, 6-1 loss to Daria Panova of
Oregon.
"I think overall we had a pretty
solid showing," Barnikow said. "I
lost in the finals, but 1 had some
good matches and some good
wins. It was really good to get some
match experience in because I
hadn't played a tournament since
November."
Barnikow's spot in the finals was
ensured with a three-hour, three
set victory over Emilie Scribot of
Arizona.
"It was just long — playing four
matches in one weekend is just
tough," Barnikow said. "I finished
that [semifinal match] at 9:30 at
night and I had to get up the next
morning at 9:00 a.m. for the final.
It was really tiring, really fatiguing
and really tough competition."
Also adding a strong perfor
mance was sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates, who achieved a
hard-fought victory in the second
flight consolation singles bracket
with a victory over Orsi Sallai of
Washington State, 6-3, 6-2.
"[Tweedie-Yates] lost her first
round match, but I think she was a
little tight because she's from
[Washington] and a lot of her

friends were there," assistant coach
Frankie Brennan said. "Then she
played a couple of great consola
tion matches to win the backdraw."
Also competing in second-flight
singles was junior Emilia Ander
son, who won her opening match
before being defeated by Jieun Ja
cobs of California 6-2, 6-3.
"Emilia Anderson had a
tougher tournament, since she
had a pulled stomach muscle,"
Brennan said. "But she played one
match where she looked really
good and then lost in a match
where she was very sore."
Sophomore Kara Guzman
fought to the semifinals of the
third-flight singles competition be
fore falling to Erin Hoe of Wash
ington 6-2, 6-0, while freshman
Jessica Leek fell to UCLA's Anva
Loncaric 6-2,6-0 in the first round.
Stanford's showing at both
tournaments bodes well for the
team, which is up against some
fierce competition in the Pac-10
this year.
"A lot of teams are returning the
same exact players t hat they had last
year," Barnikow said. "I can't say
there is an easy team in the Pac-10."
"The competition looked
tough," Brennan added. "The

Junior Lauren Barnikow follows through on yet another vicious serve.
Barnikow advanced to the finals of the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor Cham
pionships this past weekend in Seattle.
