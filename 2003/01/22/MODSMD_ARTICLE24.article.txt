# Card faces top-ranked Hawaii
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER 
The two losses that the Stanford
men's volleyball team suffered to
Brigham Young last weekend to
start the conference season may
have brought down the morale of
the team, but what's better than a
trip to Hawaii to boost it back up?

Men's Voileybail
â– 
at No. 1 Hawaii, Today and Friday,
10:00 p.m.

Actually, a lot of things could be.
The trip to the Pineapple State is
not going to be easy as the No. 11
Cardinal (2-4, 0-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) takes on the top
team in the country in No. 1 Hawaii
(4-0) twice in next three days.
The Cardinal and the Warriors
will square off at 10:00 p.m. PST
tonight and Friday.
The battle between the two
perennial powerhouses features a
matchup between two of the
NCAA's top hitters, Stanford senior
Curt Toppel and senior Costas
Theocharidis from Hawaii.
Both players were selected as
first-team Ail-Americans last year,
marking Toppel's first selection and
Theocharidis' third straight.
While Theocharidis has been
able to dominate from the first
game of this season, Toppel is still
building up steam. Toppel has
played well, but his usual domi
nance has not been as consistent
after he missed autumn practices
while nursing a broken thumb.
"[Toppel] wasn't with us all fall,"

said head coach Don Shaw. "He's
still working his way into shape, into
the timing of things."
However, in Stanford's two con
ference losses to BYU to start the
MPSF season, Toppel quickly
showed that he's close to reaching his
original form.
"I think he started to come
around there toward the end of the
second match [against BYU]," Shaw
said.
Despite Toppel's slow start, he
was still able to record team highs
with 22 kills on Friday and 25 killson
Saturday.
Toppel's best play will be neces
sary for the Cardinal to compete
witli the Warriors.
In addition to Theocharidis, four
other starters are returning to the
Warriors' squad, including All-
MPSF honorable mention selection
Eyal Ziniet.
Preparing for the match against
Hawaii, the Cardinal has been work
ing on its defense and intensity.
"Our blocking defense is what
we've been trying to work on," Toppel
said. "Against BYU it was a little weak.
It got better the second match, but it's
going to need to improve if we want to
have a chance against Hawaii."
"[Our practice intensity] needs to
match our game intensity," Shaw
said. "It's hard to go out there and just
turn it on in a match, but [Monday's
practice] was a good day of that."
The Cardinal has not had much
time to prepare for Hawaii because of
the extensive travel time. The team
left the mainland yesterday.
"We just finished the two matches

at BYU on Saturday night," Shaw
said. "We only had two hours of
practice [Monday], so we haven't re
ally had time to do anythingjust for
I lawaii."
While Hawaii's status as the top
team in the country creates a chal
lenge, the team is still looking for
ward to its trip.
"We want to show the rest of the
conference that we can beat the No.
1 team," Toppel said.
"If we go over there and get even
one win, that will be a bonus for us,
because not too many teams will be
able to go over there and win at all,"
Shaw added.
While in Hawaii, the team will
enjoy an environment that is very
different from what is experienced
on the mainland.
"I like the atmosphere over
there," said Shaw. "It's kind of fun.
It's always very competitive."
fhe extremely competitive nature
of the matches in Hawaii is obviously
not the only bonus of traveling to
Hawaii. The Warriors routinely lead
the nation in attendance, with thou
sands packing the Stan Sherif Center
every match, and the Hawaiian fan
are far and away the most knowl
edgeable in the country.
"Fans are really into it," Shaw ex
plained. "There'll be a lot of them
and the games will be on TV on the
islands.
"I'll be recognized by people over
there when I'm walking down the
street. That doesn't happen here. In
fact, I can walk across the street from
here to Arrillaga and people don't
know who I am."

will try to rebound from two straight losses as Stanford battles top-ranked Hawaii tonight and again on Friday.
