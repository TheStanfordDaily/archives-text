# Weightlifting club makes great strides in short time

### AMELIA DELAPAZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many college students, the phrase "lifting weights"
recalls images of 25-pound free weights that one occasion
ally picks up at the gym on an especially energetic day.
However, for the members of the Stanford Weightlifting
Club, these words represent a passion in their lives.
"I've always lifted. For my entire life, 1 don't remem
ber a week going by without three solid workouts," junior
Dana Mauriello said, showing the dedication and love for
the sport of weightlifting that is common to all members
of the club.
She is one of the approximately 18 members that form
the weightlifting club, which does everything from power
lifting to Olympic lifting to strong man competitions. Of
these members, about 12 are Stanford students and the
rest live in the surrounding community.
Although most of the members had experience

weightlifting before joining the club, there was no orga
nized group of weightlifters on campus until the club
came along this past spring.
"Several other schools in the area have started teams
that are quite successful, like Sacramento State and Chico
State," said Joseph Matteo, a Ph.D. student in applied
physics. "We figured there is no reason Stanford can't do
the same."
When Matteo was an undergraduate, there was no
organized weightlifting group for him to work with, so
he was enthusiastic about starting such a group at Stan
ford. The other members that have joined since the
group's inception share these sentiments — the club al
lows them to work out with and learn from a group of
similarly minded people, as well as a chance to lift com
petitively.
Many team members, like Mauriello, had no com
petitive experience before joining the club. However,
strengthened by the club's supportive environment and

led by their coach, Don Hughs, several of the members
have done very well in recent competitions.
"Last year alone, we had five first-place finishes in
various meets around California," said club co
founder Andrew Schober, an applied physics graduate
student.
Matteo, along with Stephanie Kubik and Chuck
Booten, both graduate students in mechanical engineer
ing, even qualified for nationals this past year.
Matteo, Kubik and Charlie Stocking, a recent Stanford
graduate, hold California state records in their specific
events and weight categories for lifting 606 pounds, 308
pounds and 550 pounds, respectively.
Pretty impressive fora club that is only about six
months old.
Overall, the club members cited the support, motiva
tion and unique learning environment that the club pro-
vided as being supremely impor
tant — all ideas that were embod
ied in Matteo's original goals for
the team.
"[We wanted] to bring all of
the people together who are in
terested in strength sports," Mat
teo said. "At Stanford, you have
numerous people from different
backgrounds with greatly varied
athletic experiences. By forming
the club, we created a common
ground where we could all bene
fit from this."
Certainly, it is their dedication
to each other and their love of the
sport itself that has allowed them
to meet as well as surpass this goal
in such a short amount of time.
