### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week was unusually busy for the Stan
lord fencing team, which found itself en
camped in San Diego for six days fora pair of
tournaments.
The Cardinal turned in a solid showing in
its first competitions of 2003, as the Stanford
fencers continued to accumulate points for
the national rankings and tried to gain some
attention with selections of 2004 Olympic
teams looming on the horizon.
Last Wednesday, the full men's and
women's team traveled to UC-San Diego to
face a tough day of matches against Columbia,
Cal State-Fullerton, NYU, Saint John's and
the host Tritons.
The No. (j Stanford men won four of their
five dual meets, defeating NYU, No. 3 Saint
John's, Fullerton and UCSD, but falling to
No. 7 Columbia.
The victory over the Red Storm stood out,
as the Cardinal eked out a 14-13 win over the
2001 NCAA champions thanks to a big effort
from its foil team, widely regarded as the best
in the nation.
"The team overall did well, especially con
sidering we have a lot of walk-ons on the
team," said sophomore Ibilist Florian Reich
ling, who dropped only one of his 15 match
es. "We should be even better by the NCAA
Championships [in late March]."
The Cardinal women captured two oftheir
five duals, beating the Titans and the Tritons.
But the No. 3 Saint John's women, No. 6 Co
lumbia and NYU were too much for the Stan
ford swordswomen.
Sophomore Iris Zimmerman and Eva
Petschnigg led the way for Stanford on foil,
while sophomore Meghan Everett guided the
Cardinal's sabre unit.
"Unfortunately we don't have the same
depth that other schools have [on the
women's side]," said men's captain sopho
more Mark Mulholland. "Each respective
weapon's team has an outstanding fencer, but
we often don't have enough."
This weekend, select Stanford team mem

bers competed in the North American Circuit,
also in San Diego. Only about half of Stan
ford's team qualified to participate in this elite
tournament.
"It is the best in the country that come [to
the North American Circuit] to fence to try to
get points to make an Olympic team in the fu

ture," Cardinal coach Lisa Milgram said.
Younger members of the team were allowed
to compete in the under-20 junior category.

the junior competition, won the silver medal
