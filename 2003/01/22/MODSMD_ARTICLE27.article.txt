# Eagles fans learning the shame of Buffalo
## 
### 
So this must be an inkling of
what it felt like to be a Bills
fan in the early '90s. To
watch your team fall yet
again after getting ever so close to
the pinnacle. To sit and stare in
disbelief as your beloved Eagles'
comeback bid falls ever so hapless
ly into the waiting arms of Tampa
cornerback Ronde Barber, thus
dashing your hopes fora second
straight year.

1, of course, am
using the univer
sal "you" to refer
to anyone and
everyone who,
like me, is be
grudgingly drag
ging themselves
out of bed to face
another harsh

winter day in which the Philadel
phia Eagles will not be represent
ing the NFC in the Super Bowl.
Alter last year's 5-point loss to the
St. Louis Rams in the NFC Cham
pionship, I just knew that late was
a Philly fan this year. A 13-4
record, home-field advantage, a
rejuvenated Donovan McNabb
and the last football game ever at
venerable Veterans Stadium — all
the pieces seemed to be in place.
But alas, it was not to be. The
Buccaneers defense proved just
too strong for the Birds on this
cruel, cruel day, and all of us die
hard Philly fans are left to ponder
what could have been for yet an
other year.
In this day and age of parity in
the NFL, even I, who has pro
claimed, "This will be the Eagles
year," every single season since my
conception, am beginning to feel
the sense of urgency that comes
along with being oh-so-close for
just-too-long. With salary caps,
free agency and the propensity for
high profile NFL players to com
mit some sort of career-ending
felony, it is hard to keep a quality
team together for too many runs at

ilie Super Bowl.
The Bills, with their four
straight appearances in the big
game, were an aberration in every
sense of the word. The fact that the
ownership and the coaching stall
could field a team that competitive
for four years in a row is remark
able. The fact that they will go
down in history as the biggest
bunch of choke artists this side of a
Sprewell family reunion is slightly
less appealing, but that should not
take away from the magnitude of
their accomplishments. Okay,
maybe it should take away a little
— I mean, they could have at least
tried to be competitive in any of
their last three Super Bowls.
Although I don't think it's time
to start raising any alarms in the
City of Brotherly Love, one has to
feel that, in the end, the McNabb,
Dawkins, Andy Reid era almost
isn't going to count for much if
they don't win a title. Not in
Philadelphia. Just ask Mitch
Williams. Or Allen Iverson. Or
Eric Lindros.
Buffalo Bills jokes aside, people
really don't pay that much atten
tion to those who come close but
don't quite get the cigar. A case in
point: How much attention would
we really have paid to Monica
Lewinsky without the evidence of
the aforementioned tobacco prod
uct and a dress that was badly in
need of some Tide?
An epitome of close-but-no
cigar, Dennis Green is a prime
candidate to replace Steve Mariuc
ci as head coach ofthe49ers. I low
ever, odds are he'd have retained
his last job and still be one the eight
African-American residents of the
state of Minnesota if not for Gary
Andersen's Heimlich-quality per
formance in the 1998 NFC Cham
pionship game.
The Vikings of that season, led
by Randall Cunningham (who is


Ryan Stewart
by far the most underrated quar
terback of all-time), Chris Carter
and Randy Moss, boasted arguably
the best offensive season in the his
tory of the NFL. Primed fora mon
ster Super Bowl showdown with
John Elway and the Broncos, An
dersen, who hadn't missed a kick
all year, botched a chip-shot field
goal that would have sent the
Vikings to the big game. Instead,
Cunningham and company were

sent back to the ice fjords, and the
Atlanta Falcons went on to get de
molished in one of the worst Super
Bowls ever. To this day I am bitter
about that game. Possibly the
worst kick ever in football, and that
includes Scott Norwood's famous
gaffe. At least we expected Nor
wood to miss.
When push comes to shove,
great performances mean little
without taking home the ultimate
prize. Charles Barkley knows it, A1
Gore knows it, Susan Lucci knew
it, Kevin Garnett is coming to real
ize it, and Barry Bonds better start
accepting it real quick. For the

Philadelphia Eagles, the sun isn't
yet setting on their chances, but
they'd better stop basking in the
glow too much longer, or this gold
en opportunity might pass them
b y-
As for the Raiders and Bucca
neers, The Gruden Bowl is going
to prove bittersweet for its name
sake. Raiders 31, Bucs 21. But hey,
there's always next year.
