# Students show support for affirmative action at forum
## 
### ERIC ELOON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday, around 100 students gath
ered in White Plaza to support affirmative
action policies at Stanford and across the
nation as part of the National Take Affir
mative Action Day, organized by the
NAACP and the United States Student As
sociation.
"One only needs to look around Stan
ford to see the benefits of affirmative ac
tion," said senior Sonrisa Lucero, a mem
ber of MEChA, a Chicano / Latino student
group. "We need to celebrate and defend
the diversity of color, gender, ethnicity and
thought that it provides."
As the crowd chanted, "Education is a
right, not a privilege of the rich and white,"
speakers discussed subjects ranging from
the history of affirmative action at Stanford
to new plans to send Stanford students to
Washington, D.C. to march in support of
affirmative action this spring.
The event was organized by the Stu
dents of Color Coalition, which includes
the Asian American Students Association,
the Black Student Union, the Stanford
American Indian Organization, the
Pilipino American Student Union and
MEChA.
"SOCC represents all minority
groups on campus, and we're ready to
make a move on campus to support af
firmative action policies regardless of the
outcome of the University of Michigan
[Supreme Court] case," said senior
Owen Li, a participant at the event and
current chair of the Asian American Stu
dents Association.
The Supreme Court is currently consid
ering two cases brought against the Uni
versity of Michigan that are contesting the
constitutionality of existing affirmative ac
tion policies there.
"Within the Asian-American racial
group, there are large sections of the popu

lation that need and deserve affirmative ac
tion because they come here as refugees as
a result of U.S. wars of aggression in Asia,"
Li continued. "We also need socioeconom
ic diversity in sufficiently represented eth
nicities."
Some speakers claimed that it is hypo
critical for critics to assail affirmative ac
tion while ignoring other admissions
practices, like giving priority to the rela
tives of alumni.
"The primary critique of affirmative ac
tion is that it unfairly biases educational op
portunities in favor of specific groups," said
MEChA member Nolan Cabrera, who
spoke yesterday. "That's exactly what a
legacy does, but no one talks about it.
"They want to talk about having the best
qualified candidates — but say, for exam
ple, that I had had the same academic qual
ifications as the current president of the
United States when he applied to college —
I never would have gotten into Stanford,"
Cabrera added.
The rally also signaled the beginning of
SOCC's fundraising efforts to send a Stan
ford contingency to the National March on
Washington in early April. The march is
scheduled to take place on the day that the
Supreme Court rules on the University of
Mulligan cases.
"In 1989, Stanford students marched on
Washington in large numbers to support
the 'education as a light' movement," said
sophomore Khalilah Karim. "We hope to
continue in this tradition this April."
SOCC will be meeting with Provost John
Etchemendy this coming Monday to dis
cuss affirmative action issues as they relate
to students and faculty, and they plan to
meet with the admissions office sometime
this week.
"The University is definitely paying at
tention to what we have to say," said
MEChA core member Laura Avina. "And
they know that we're concerned about
what's going on."
