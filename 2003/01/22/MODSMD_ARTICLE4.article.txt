# Wais to leave for NYU in March
## 
### SAMEER AHMED EDITORIAL STAFF 
Dean of Students Marc Wais is leaving
Stanford in March to become the vice
president of student affairs at New York
University.
"I make this decision with very mixed
feelings," said Wais, who is also a resi
dent fellow for Junipero House. "Stan
ford has always meant much more than
a job to me."
Christine Griffith, associate dean and
director of graduate life, will serve as act
ing dean after Wais departs from the
Farm on March 28. The University will
conduct a nationwide search to choose a
permanent dean of students.
At NYU, the nation's largest private in
stitution, Wais will be responsible for all as
pects of student life, including the univer
sity's housing and dining services and its
20-sport intercollegiate athletic program.
"[Wais'] energy and enthusiasm will
be missed, but I am excited for his op
portunity at NYU," said Gene Awakuni,
Stanford's vice provost for student af
fairs. "I think he will do an outstanding
job for them."
Wais was initially offered the NYU
position on Dec. 20, and he finally
reached an agreement with the school
last Thursday. On Friday, he sent an e
mail to friends and colleagues informing

them of his decision.
Wais gave four reasons for his deci
sion to accept the NYU post: the acade
mic caliber of the school, NYU's
"tremendous growth" in the past 10
years, its New York City location and the
school's relative closeness to his and his
wife Sue's families (Wais is originally
from Baltimore, and Sue is from New
Haven, Conn.).
"It's a very exciting time to be at

NYU," Wais said. "In the past 10 years,
the number of applications to NYU (has]
increased from 10,000 to over 32,000 last
year . . . [NYU's] average SAT score
used to be 1050, and now it's slightly
under 1400."
While Wais had wanted to finish out
the academic year at Stanford, NYU offi
cials needed him to start his new position
as soon as possible.
"[The NYU officials] really wanted
me to leave Stanford in February, so I
did my best to stay at Stanford las long as
possible]," Wais said.
When Wais leaves Stanford in March,
his wife Sue will become Junipero's sole
resident fellow until the end of the
school year.
Students at Stanford said they will
miss Wais for many reasons, especially
his openness and availability to students.
"It's been really nice to have some
body [as an RF] who knows the Universi
ty so well," said junior Jocelyn Whitson, a
resident assistant in Junipero. "[Wais is]
a great person to work with. He's not
domineering at all as an RF."
"I think what has impressed me about
[Dean Wais] is his accessibility to stu
dents," said ASSU President Monica
1 lenestroza. "He's always made sure that
students are involved."

Dean of Students Marc Wais has regularly
met with students at ASSU meetings and
other gatherings. In March, he will leave
the Farm to take on a new post at New York
University.
Henestroza specifically praised
Wais'commitment to the Stanford
Alter Midnight program, which
extends various facility hours on
campus to as late as 2 a.m., and his
help in setting up meetings be
tween student representatives and
administrators to talk about Stan
ford's recent budget cuts.
The Stanford After Midnight
program, which VVais helped es
tablish after lie conducted a stu
dent time-use survey document
ing how Stanford undergraduates
spend their time, is one of VVais'
many accomplishments during his

seven-plus years at the University.
He is also responsible for estab
lishing the Graduate Student Pro
gramming board, upgrading the
computer clusters in all six com
munity centers and forming the
Acts of Intolerance Advisory
Group, in which he helped create
a Web site to support Stanford's ef
forts to prevent and respond to
acts of intolerance on campus.
VVais also played a major role in
renovating Tresidder Union by
bringing Jamba Juice and the
Treehouse to campus and convert
ing vacant space on the first floor
into the Tresidder Fitness facility.
Wais, who worked at six differ
ent schools before coming to Stan
ford, said that one of the many
things he will miss about the Farm

is the unique character of Stanford
students.
"The one tiling I appreciate
most about Stanford students is
t hat they take their work
seriously — their academics, ath
letics and whatever else they are
passionate about — but they don't
take themselves too seriously,"
Wais said. "When you go to other
schools, you really appreciate that."
"It is very difficult to even con
template leaving the Farm," he
added. "Stanford has been very
kind and thoughtful to my family
and me. And while I have learned
a great deal about university ad
ministration during my tenure as
dean, I have always been im
pressed with the people and spirit
that exist at Stanford."

permanent dean of students.
At NYU, the nation's largest private in
stitution, Wais will be responsible for all as
pects of student life, including the univer
sity's housing and dining services and its
20-sport intercollegiate athletic program.
"[Wais'] energy and enthusiasm will
be missed, but I am excited for his op
portunity at NYU," said Gene Awakuni,
Stanford's vice provost for student af
fairs. "I think he will do an outstanding
job for them."
Wais was initially offered the NYU
position on Dec. 20, and he finally
reached an agreement with the school
last Thursday. On Friday, he sent an e
mail to friends and colleagues informing

them of his decision.
Wais gave four reasons for his deci
sion to accept the NYU post: the acade
mic caliber of the school, NYU's
"tremendous growth" in the past 10
years, its New York City location and the
school's relative closeness to his and his
wife Sue's families (Wais is originally
from Baltimore, and Sue is from New
Haven, Conn.).
"It's a very exciting time to be at

NYU," Wais said. "In the past 10 years,
the number of applications to NYU (has]
increased from 10,000 to over 32,000 last
year . . . [NYU's] average SAT score
used to be 1050, and now it's slightly
under 1400."
While Wais had wanted to finish out
the academic year at Stanford, NYU offi
cials needed him to start his new position
as soon as possible.
"[The NYU officials] really wanted
me to leave Stanford in February, so I
did my best to stay at Stanford las long as
possible]," Wais said.
When Wais leaves Stanford in March,
his wife Sue will become Junipero's sole
resident fellow until the end of the
school year.
Students at Stanford said they will
miss Wais for many reasons, especially
his openness and availability to students.
"It's been really nice to have some
body [as an RF] who knows the Universi
ty so well," said junior Jocelyn Whitson, a
resident assistant in Junipero. "[Wais is]
a great person to work with. He's not
domineering at all as an RF."
"I think what has impressed me about
[Dean Wais] is his accessibility to stu
dents," said ASSU President Monica
1 lenestroza. "He's always made sure that
students are involved."

Dean of Students Marc Wais has regularly
met with students at ASSU meetings and
other gatherings. In March, he will leave
the Farm to take on a new post at New York
University.
Henestroza specifically praised
Wais'commitment to the Stanford
Alter Midnight program, which
extends various facility hours on
campus to as late as 2 a.m., and his
help in setting up meetings be
tween student representatives and
administrators to talk about Stan
ford's recent budget cuts.
The Stanford After Midnight
program, which VVais helped es
tablish after lie conducted a stu
dent time-use survey document
ing how Stanford undergraduates
spend their time, is one of VVais'
many accomplishments during his

seven-plus years at the University.
He is also responsible for estab
lishing the Graduate Student Pro
gramming board, upgrading the
computer clusters in all six com
munity centers and forming the
Acts of Intolerance Advisory
Group, in which he helped create
a Web site to support Stanford's ef
forts to prevent and respond to
acts of intolerance on campus.
VVais also played a major role in
renovating Tresidder Union by
bringing Jamba Juice and the
Treehouse to campus and convert
ing vacant space on the first floor
into the Tresidder Fitness facility.
Wais, who worked at six differ
ent schools before coming to Stan
ford, said that one of the many
things he will miss about the Farm

is the unique character of Stanford
students.
"The one tiling I appreciate
most about Stanford students is
t hat they take their work
seriously — their academics, ath
letics and whatever else they are
passionate about — but they don't
take themselves too seriously,"
Wais said. "When you go to other
schools, you really appreciate that."
"It is very difficult to even con
template leaving the Farm," he
added. "Stanford has been very
kind and thoughtful to my family
and me. And while I have learned
a great deal about university ad
ministration during my tenure as
dean, I have always been im
pressed with the people and spirit
that exist at Stanford."
