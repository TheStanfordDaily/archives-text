# Bio prof’s work evolves despite detractors
## Critical Mass: Ehrlich fires back 
### ALVIN CHIN 
When most people hear a ref
erence to Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich in the news, it's usually for
the gloomy environmental and
population-related scenarios he
has portrayed in his influential
books. Words such as: "The battle
to feed all of humanity is over,"
and ". . . The world will experi
ence starvation of tragic propor
tions— hundreds of millions of
people will starve to death," are
frequently cited statements from
Ehrlich's works.
However, the "predictions,"
which Ehrlich's many critics often
assail, are, according to Ehrlich
himself, simply a series of scenar
ios that he described as possible
consequences of unchecked con
sumption and population growth
in a mass-marketed book from
1968, "The Population Bomb."
Today, Ehrlich is still con
cerned with the environment and
population, but is currently in
volved in several different studies,
including terrorism, household
structure, nuclear proliferation
and butterflies.
'Eco-gloomster' no more
Last year, Ehrlich was blasted
as an "eco-gloomster" in The
Wall Street Journal and as a "tire
less pessimist" and "techno

phobe" in Forbes.
However, Ehrlich noted that as
a scientist in the public eye, such
harsh criticism is not unusual.
"You're going to be at
tacked," he said. "It's like going
into politics."
As for the book, which lias be
come the overwhelming target for
anti-environmental "brownlash"
rhetoric, Ehrlich defends his work
but is astonished that people
think he still stands behind every
thing that he wrote in"The Popu
lation Bomb."
Regarding the "doomsday
predictions" that have consistent
ly attracted criticism, Ehrlich said,
"Nobody ever hits 100 percent."
But, he continued, "I wouldn't
write the same book today — if
you say the same thing 35 years
later, then you haven't been a
very good scientist."
This doesn't mean Ehrlich no
longer concerns himself with pop
ulation issues.
On Jan. 12, Ehrlich, along with
Fisheries and Wildlife Prof. Jian
guo Liu of Michigan State Uni
versity and Stanford Assoc. Prof,
of Biology Gretchen Daily and Bi
ology graduate student Gary
Luck, published a paper in Na
ture on the effect of decreased
household size on environmental
