# Bio prof’s work evolves despite detractors
## Critical Mass: Ehrlich fires back 
### ALVIN CHIN 
When most people hear a ref
erence to Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich in the news, it's usually for
the gloomy environmental and
population-related scenarios he
has portrayed in his influential
books. Words such as: "The battle
to feed all of humanity is over,"
and ". . . The world will experi
ence starvation of tragic propor
tions— hundreds of millions of
people will starve to death," are
frequently cited statements from
Ehrlich's works.
However, the "predictions,"
which Ehrlich's many critics often
assail, are, according to Ehrlich
himself, simply a series of scenar
ios that he described as possible
consequences of unchecked con
sumption and population growth
in a mass-marketed book from
1968, "The Population Bomb."
Today, Ehrlich is still con
cerned with the environment and
population, but is currently in
volved in several different studies,
including terrorism, household
structure, nuclear proliferation
and butterflies.
'Eco-gloomster' no more
Last year, Ehrlich was blasted
as an "eco-gloomster" in The
Wall Street Journal and as a "tire
less pessimist" and "techno

phobe" in Forbes.
However, Ehrlich noted that as
a scientist in the public eye, such
harsh criticism is not unusual.
"You're going to be at
tacked," he said. "It's like going
into politics."
As for the book, which lias be
come the overwhelming target for
anti-environmental "brownlash"
rhetoric, Ehrlich defends his work
but is astonished that people
think he still stands behind every
thing that he wrote in"The Popu
lation Bomb."
Regarding the "doomsday
predictions" that have consistent
ly attracted criticism, Ehrlich said,
"Nobody ever hits 100 percent."
But, he continued, "I wouldn't
write the same book today — if
you say the same thing 35 years
later, then you haven't been a
very good scientist."
This doesn't mean Ehrlich no
longer concerns himself with pop
ulation issues.
On Jan. 12, Ehrlich, along with
Fisheries and Wildlife Prof. Jian
guo Liu of Michigan State Uni
versity and Stanford Assoc. Prof,
of Biology Gretchen Daily and Bi
ology graduate student Gary
Luck, published a paper in Na
ture on the effect of decreased
household size on environmental
impact.
Despite awareness of popula
tion growth as a whole, "the issue
of the number of households and
their impact on the environment
basically has been ignored," said
Liu. "Having fewer people in
more households means using
more resources and putting more
stress on the environment."
A previous Ehrlich and Liu
study on population, published in
November, was concerned not
only with the environmental im
pact of population, but also specif
ically its impact on terrorism.
The study claimed that "terror
ist attacks on the rich [countries]
by people from developing coun
tries . . . [are rooted in] poverty,
inequality and large numbers of
young men facing dim economic
prospects."
Taking a stand against the
war on Iraq
In a November column in The
Daily, Ehrlich mentioned that
despite the United States' neces
sary short-term military cam
paign, the Bush administration
lias ignored, or failed to recog
nize, the factors responsible for
inspiring terrorists.
"It was a mistake to call this a
war on terrorism — we have to
obviously do everything that we
can to protect ourselves from fur
ther events like 9/11 or what
could be much worse," he said.

Ehrlich acknowledged the
widely held geopolitical explana
tion that terrorists are motivated
by the presence of American
troops in Saudi Arabia.
"And one then has to ask why
American troops are in Saudi Ara
bia. That leads us to people dri
ving around in SUVs and Hum
mer 2s with American Hags 011
them," he said.
"The reason we're in Saudi
Arabia is, I think, clear to everyone
— that is, to get our hands on the
oil and for Bush's friends to get
their hands 011 the oil," lie added.
Ehrlich also emphasized the
need to end global dependence on
fossil fuel.
"There are lots of reasons why
we shouldn't be driving gas-guz
zling cars — irrespective of if
there were an infinite amount of
petroleum that just spouted out of
George Bush's mouth in Wash
ington, I). C.and you could fill up
your car for nothing, you still
shouldn't be doing it."
Awareness of terrorism; a per
sonal experience
The study by Ehrlich and Liu
goes beyond geopolitics, however,
highlighting demographic and so
cioeconomic factors such as gen
der, education, poverty and regu
lar exposure to violence.
"Look at the age structure of
populations — how many are
young men 15-30 in the various
populations in poor countries?
They're often disaffected because
the economic situation in those
countries is bad and there are hor
rendous levels of unemploy

merit," he said. "These people
have reasons [for engaging in ter
rorism] — but we're not doing
much to understand the reasons,
or, in my view, to change the be
havior that has created those rea
sons."
Ehrlich reported that disaffect
ed young males with a high level of
education but scarce opportuni
ties were most prone to recruit
ment by terrorist groups.
"It's particularly sad because in
some groups there are high levels
of education — Palestinians are
very well-educated people — and
yet the opportunities are way
down," he said.
The terrorism study by Ehrlich
and Liu was triggered by personal
experience. During the Sept. 11
attacks, Ehrlich and Liu were in
Washington, D.C. fora profes
sional conference aimed at train
ing scientists to handle political
and media exposure.
"Our hotel was not too far
from the Pentagon," Liu recalled.
"Prof. Ehrlich and I were trapped
in D.C. for several anxious and
stressful days. Because the air
port was closed, the only way to
return to California was by car.
Eventually, we were able to rent a
vehicle and drove more than
3,000 miles over a period of two
days and nights."
Terrorism and the environment:
'a seamless traverse'
Beyond that experience, it may
seem odd that professors of popu
lation biology would suddenly
choose to write about terrorism,
but Ehrlich has always found the

topics closely linked.
"I've been writing about terror
ism for years," he said. "It may
sound weird fora professor who
was originally concerned with
what [the concept ol] 'Too Many
People' was doing to butterfly
populations and our life support
systems and so on to get into issues
like terrorism — it seems like a
leap, but it's actually a seamless
traverse."
Liu clarified Ehrlich's position,
explaining that conservation ecol
ogy research "requires a strong
background not only in tradition
al ecology — which focuses on
'natural' ecosystems without con
sidering human impacts — but
also socioeconomics, human de
mography and government poli
cies, because almost all ecosystems
on earth have been affected or
dominated by humans.
"Working on terrorism . . .
[has been] a logical and natural ex
tension of Prof. Ehrlich's personal
experience, broad knowledge
about social sciences, great sense
of obligations fora peaceful world,
and long-term passion for the en
vironment," said Liu.
Ehrlich emphasized the con
nections between the social and
the scientific.
"When you get into issues of
how we run the globe — start
with, say, population as an issue,
that immediately leads you to con
sumption and it leads you to pop
ulation growth and differing rates
of consumption. And that leads
you to power relations because
what goes on in this world is inex
plicable unless you understand

the power relations, which gets
you into economics
As an example, Ehrlich re
counts how in the 19705, he, his
wife Anne and John Holdren
were studying the environmen
tal impact of using nuclear
power, including power plant
accidents, nuclear waste and nu
clear proliferation.
"We were writing about con
trolling nuclear materials, and
sub-national groups and rogue
nations with nuclear weapons —
it's all old, old, stuff. (We exam
ined] the kind of power that's
best for the environment —
well, of course blowing people
up isn't good for the environ
ment," he said.
'Population Bomb' continues to
haunt Ehrlich
Ehrlich is the author of at least
37 books and more than 000 arti
cles, on topics such as Costa
Rican birds, coevolution, terror
ism, ecological effects of nuclear
war, the checkerspot butterfly
and the Endangered Species Act.
Vet Ehrlich notes that despite the
volume and variety of his work,
the "predictions" of his first book
are regularly cited as proof of ex
tensive flaws in the environmen
tal movement.
Martin Wolf of the Financial
Times recently praised Bjorn
Lomborg's book, "The Skeptical
Environmentalist," in a Jan. 15 ar
ticle, a challenge of widely held be
liefs that the global environment is
progressively worsening. In con
trast to Lomborg, Wolf did not
quote any environmental warn

ings given recently, but instead
referenced "The Population
Bomb." Wolf pointed out that, as
of today, Prof. Ehrlich's forecast of
famine in India have been proven
"grotesquely mistaken."
Ehrlich responded, "I probably
published 200 papers in the . ..
literature and 10 books since 'The
Population Bomb,' and he goes
back and accuses me of having
been wrong in 'The Population
Bomb' on one point."
In a letter published in the Fi
nancial Times on Jan. 20, Ehrlich
wrote that the Lomborg book
"has been thoroughly reviewed
by environmental scientists with
the highest credentials (not 'envi
ronmentalists,' as Mr. Wolf and
others so disingenuously label
them) and by the Danish Com
mittee on Scientific Dishonesty
(which was not made up of envi
ronmental scientists), and found
it to be fraudulent."
Ehrlich is familiar with this
now-routine line of attack on "The
Population Bomb."
"I didn't sit down and decide
that 1 was going to become known
as the Population Guru. 1 get this
all the time: 'All that I think about
is Population.' "
The idea for"The Population
Bomb" came when lan Ballantine,
the founder of Ballantine Books,
heard Ehrlich on a radio broad
cast, approached him and sug
gested that lie write a short book.
"Ballantine said, Maybe it'll get
out in time to affect the presiden
tial election.'" Ehrlich laughed. "It
shows how incredibly naive you
can be when you're young."
