Asian Immigrant Students.
Though the ASSU has a general fees
budget of $148,000, Shipp, a sopho
more, explained that many student
groups do not use their complete bud
get and end up returning funds to the
ASSU. Last year, $75,000 was re
turned.

The senate approved bills to modify
the budgets of the Kuumba Dance En
semble, Stanford Pre-Law Society,
Henry's Place, Womenspeak and Stu

issues, she asked the senators to submit
questions or issues that they would like

Henestroza also announced that
Wais will be stepping down from
his current position to accept a po
sition at New York University as the
vice president for student affairs.
She urged the senators to think
about how this period of transition
will present both "challenges and
opportunities" to the student body
and how the position of the dean
of students at Stanford could be
improved.
Henestroza also announced
that the Office of the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs is considering a
change to residential life at Stan
ford that would place all freshmen
into one dorm complex. Many
universities already implement
this kind of system, I fenestroza ex
plained, and many others, like
Stanford, are considering adopt
ing this system.
"It would change the face of
Residential Education," Hene
stroza said. She also encouraged
the senators to "work with [their]
constituents to find out the best
needs of students."

again," he said.
The senate approved a bill to
fund "Exploring Religious
Boundaries and Conflicts," a con
ference taking place on Jan. 25.
The senate decided to table vot
ing on a bill to approve amend
