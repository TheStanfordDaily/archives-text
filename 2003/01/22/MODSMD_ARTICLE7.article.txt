# With $7.5M gift, physics institute to open in 2005
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a recent $7.5 million gift fiom the Kavli Foun
dation, construction has resumed on the Kavli Institute
for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, which is now
slated for completion in 2005. The institute is a joint
venture between ihe Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, the Department of Physics and the Department of
Applied Physics, with the aim of investigating basic
questions of the universe from a unique, multidiscipli
nary perspective.
The University had planned to complete construc
tion of the institute in 2001. However, construction
stalled when funding for building the institute ran out.
The $7.5 million donated by the foundation will go
mostly toward constructing a new building at SLAC to
bring together theoretical and experimental physicists
who specialize in both cosmology, the study of the uni
verse, and particle physics, the study of basic compo
nents of matter.
The initial $15 million donation for the institute
came from Pehong and Adele Chen in 2001. Chen was
partially motivated by his brother, I'isin Chen, who
works at SLAC.
"The germ of the idea [for the institute] came from
Pisin Chen, and the original support came from Pe
hong Chen," said Physics Department Chair Douglas
()shei < >ff.
The gift from the Chens will endow the directorship
of the institute.
The Kavli Foundation was created by Fred Kavli, a
physicist and founder of Kavlico, a company that spe
cializes in sensors for aircraft and space shuttles. The
foundation's mission is to support basic research in
neuroscience, cosmology and nanoscience.
"We think Stanford lias an outstanding opportuni
ty to do something new by bringing the elementary
particle physicists together with the cosmologists to

benefit both the understanding of
how the universe came into being
and evolved and to improve the un
derstanding of elementary particle
physics," said David Austen, presi
dent of the Kavli Foundation.
Though the institute's exact re
search plan is not yet clear, it is like
ly that researchers will focus on
dark matter.
"Dark matter is known to be a
very significant component of the
total mass of the universe, but it
does not emit any form of de
tectable electromagnetic radia
tion," said the institute's incoming
Deputy Director Steven Kahn, a
professor of physics at Columbia
University. "There is good reason
to believe that it is made up of a new
form of matter which interacts only
very weakly with the ordinary mat
ter we are familiar with."

Another area of probable re
search is dark energy, the theoreti
cal force that is responsible for the
continuing acceleration of the uni
verse despite the pull of gravity.
"Particle astrophysics and cos
mology have been the fields in
which some of the most exciting
discoveries in all of physics have oc
curred in the last lew years," Kahn
said. "I am eager to expand my ex
perimental activities in these fields,
and the new institute at Stanford
will certainly give me an excellent
opportunity to do so."
Kahn also mentioned Slv\C as
instrumental in drawing his inter
est. Both Kahn and incoming di
rector Roger Blandford, a profes
sor of theoretical astrophysics at
Caltech, will receive joint appoint
ments at SIAC and in the Physics
Department in fall 2003.
"The Physics [Department] and
SLAC at Stanford are both out
standing, and it will be an honor to
be associated with them," Kahn
said.
