With a recent $7.5 million gift fiom the Kavli Foun
dation, construction has resumed on the Kavli Institute
for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, which is now
slated for completion in 2005. The institute is a joint
venture between ihe Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, the Department of Physics and the Department of
Applied Physics, with the aim of investigating basic
questions of the universe from a unique, multidiscipli
nary perspective.
The University had planned to complete construc
tion of the institute in 2001. However, construction
stalled when funding for building the institute ran out.
The $7.5 million donated by the foundation will go
mostly toward constructing a new building at SLAC to
bring together theoretical and experimental physicists
who specialize in both cosmology, the study of the uni
verse, and particle physics, the study of basic compo
nents of matter.
The initial $15 million donation for the institute
came from Pehong and Adele Chen in 2001. Chen was
partially motivated by his brother, I'isin Chen, who
works at SLAC.
"The germ of the idea [for the institute] came from
Pisin Chen, and the original support came from Pe
hong Chen," said Physics Department Chair Douglas
()shei < >ff.
The gift from the Chens will endow the directorship
of the institute.
The Kavli Foundation was created by Fred Kavli, a
physicist and founder of Kavlico, a company that spe
cializes in sensors for aircraft and space shuttles. The
foundation's mission is to support basic research in
neuroscience, cosmology and nanoscience.
"We think Stanford lias an outstanding opportuni
ty to do something new by bringing the elementary
particle physicists together with the cosmologists to
