SEVIS INFORMATION FOR STANFORD INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS & SCHOLARS ON F & J VISAS
What is SEVIS?
SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor
Information System, a federally mandated
electronic system by which Stanford will
provide information to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) on all F-l and
J-l students, J-l scholars and F-2 and J-2
dependents. Students and scholars will pay a
fee to cover the ongoing operating costs of
SEVIS. This fee is currently set at $54. At
this time there is no information on when the
fee will be implemented or how it will be
paid.
What is the history of SEVIS?
request.
SEVIS now requires that Stanford both keep
this information and provide it to INS on a
regular basis using electronic reporting. This
electronic reporting system has been in the
development stages since 1995. In October
2001, the Patriot Act mandated that SEVIS
would begin by January 2003.
When does SEVIS go into effect?
Schools need to be ready to use SEVIS by
January 30, 2003. There is a phased in
approach as to when students and scholars
will be entered into SEVIS. By August 1,
2003 all current students and scholars will
need to be entered into SEVIS.
SEVIS will produce different looking I-20s
(for F-1 students) or DS-2019s ( —formerly
lAP-66 —for J-l students and scholars).
What information will SEVIS require?
1. Stanford will need to provide quarterly
reports to confirm the enrollment and
attendance of students
2. Stanford will also need to report "events'
such as change of address, change of
degree, employment authorization,
termination, and graduation.
All reporting will have to be done within a
certain time period. The I-Center will be
providing further information on these
SEVIS, therefore, not only produces 1-20
and DS-2019 forms but also requires that
Stanford provides regular electronic reports
to INS throughout the stay of the F-l and J-l
visa holder.
SEVIS also requires the INS to audit
Stanford's compliance every two years.
Can Stanford refuse to send this informa
tion?
No —Colleges that enroll students and
scholars on F-l and J-l visas have to
participate in SEVIS
Can a student or scholar refuse to provide
Information?
No—this is a federal regulation. The Family
Rights and Protection Act (FERPA) does not
apply.
How is information sent to SEVIS?
It is sent electronically and will use
information generated by the student
information system at Stanford. However
there will still be paper procedures with the
INS for such things as Optional Practical
Training.
How often is information sent?
It depends on the information. Changes to a
student's status have to be reported within a
very short time period so the I-Center will
not have much time to verify information.
Who sends the information?
The information can only be sent by those
officials at Stanford who are Designated
School Officials. Stanford is allowed 10
DSOs. Students and scholar do not have
access to the SEVIS system.
How will the information be used?
The intent of SEVIS is to provide assurance
that students are maintaining full status in
the U.S., to allow quicker reporting of "event
changes" and to allow the INS to monitor
colleges and track trends.
Will SEVIS provide me with a new 1-20 or
DS-2019?
Yes —but not all continuing students/scholars
will receive a new SEVIS document at the
same time. Remember that you do not need
to have a SEVIS-produced I-20/DS-2019 by
January 30. 2003. The I-Center will alert
students and scholars as to when they will
need to be in possession of a SEVIS
document.
When will I get this new document?
It will depend. You will need to be issued
one by August 1, 2003 at the latest. However
students who apply for practical training,
change degree levels, wish to bring depen
dents to the U.S. will need to be issued a
SEVIS document earlier. The I-Center will
provide further information on obtaining a
SEVIS document for current students and
scholars.
How long will I be able to use my old 1-20
or DS-2019, including for travel?
If you do not need to apply for work
permission, extend or change your program,
or add dependents you can keep your non-
SEVIS 1-20 or DS-2019 document until
August 1, 2003. Please do not discard your
non-SEVIS document after this date. It
should be retained for your records.
Will I need to get the new SEVIS 1-20
signed for travel?
Yes.
Will my dependents need a SEVIS
document?
Yes —in fact all dependents will need to be
entered into SEVIS. This is a big change and
the I-Center will be providing more
information to students with dependents as
to how to provide dependent information.
PLEASE NOTE: Under new regulations F-2
dependents cannot attend school full time.
What effect will SEVIS have on students
and Stanford?
Students who maintain status will see no real
effect. However SEVIS requires reports on
students who are not maintaining full-time
status or who are not enrolled when they
should be. Such students may have to leave
the country and re-enter with a new
document in order to return to status. In
other words SEVIS is not very forgiving. It
is therefore very important that students not
drop below a full course of study without
first discussing the issue with the I-Center.
What does it mean that an F-l student has
to maintain full-time status?
SEVIS makes it very clear that students must
maintain full-time status. For undergraduates
this means 12 units per quarter. For graduate
students Stanford has determined that
enrollment for at least 8 units is considered a
full course of study , although departments
and professional schools may have policies
that require more. TGR is considered full
time enrollment.
Are there circumstances when to less than
a full-course load is permitted?
Yes —but remember that INS assumes that
students are going to be in full-time status
throughout their academic career. The
situations under which less than full-time
enrollment can be approved are: last quarter
prior to graduation; documented medical;
one quarter for documented academic
and the I-Center must authorize the reduced
course load in advance.
What happens if I drop below a full
course load?
Only a DSO at the I-Center can approve a
student dropping below a full course load.
As we are required to report students who
drop below a full course load without prior
permission from the I-Center it is very
important that students discuss their situation
with the I-Center before dropping below a
full course load.
Will SEVIS affect my ability to work on
or off Campus?
No. Practical Training and Curricular
Practical Training remain in place for F-l
students. However you will have to apply for
Post-Completion OPT before you graduate.
F-l students will now be allowed a further
12 months of OPT if you enroll in a new
degree level after completing the first
degree.
Do I have to report any change of address
to both the I-Center and to INS directly?
SEVIS requires that the I-Center report
address changes to the INS. Students will
need to report a change of address to the I-
Center within 10 days of the address change.
The I-Center will then need to report this
change within 21 days. We will be providing
further information. We also recommend that
you continue to report address changes to the
INS using the AR-11 form. Students who
need to comply with the National Security
Entry-Exit registration System (NSEERS)
also need to report an address change to that
system.
How will SEVIS affect obtaining a visa to
enter the L.S?
There are numerous policies that are
delaying the issuance of visas. SEVIS should
not add extra delays and, in the future, may
help in expediting visa issuance.
SEVIS also limits when you can enter the
U.S. before beginning your program of study
or research. You will be allowed to enter
only 30 days prior to the beginning date
listed on your SEVIS I-20/DS-2019.
Can I still get a program extension or
change degree level?
Yes
What should F-l and J-l students and
scholars do to prepare for SEVIS?
• The I-Center staff are available to answer
any questions you might have. Don't
hesitate to ask for assistance. The
information provided in this memo is an
overview of SEVIS
• Students and scholars will receive a direct
email or letter providing further details.
• Further information on SEVIS can be
found on the I-Center web site:
icenter.stanford.edu
• Read any email updates from the I-Center
• Understand the immigration regulations
and how they affect your lawful status in
the U.S. and refer any questions or
problems immediately to the I-Center. The
INS has a web site at:
http://www.ins.usdoj.gov/graphics/
services/tempbenefits/sevp/htm .
• Be prepared! Plan your course schedules
carefully, make travel arrangements early,
and keep all documents up-to-date.

not have much time to verify information.
Who sends the information?
The information can only be sent by those
officials at Stanford who are Designated
School Officials. Stanford is allowed 10
DSOs. Students and scholar do not have
access to the SEVIS system.
How will the information be used?
The intent of SEVIS is to provide assurance
that students are maintaining full status in
the U.S., to allow quicker reporting of "event
changes" and to allow the INS to monitor
colleges and track trends.
Will SEVIS provide me with a new 1-20 or
DS-2019?
Yes —but not all continuing students/scholars
will receive a new SEVIS document at the
same time. Remember that you do not need
to have a SEVIS-produced I-20/DS-2019 by
January 30. 2003. The I-Center will alert
students and scholars as to when they will
need to be in possession of a SEVIS
document.
When will I get this new document?
It will depend. You will need to be issued
one by August 1, 2003 at the latest. However
students who apply for practical training,
change degree levels, wish to bring depen
dents to the U.S. will need to be issued a
SEVIS document earlier. The I-Center will
provide further information on obtaining a
SEVIS document for current students and
scholars.
How long will I be able to use my old 1-20
or DS-2019, including for travel?
If you do not need to apply for work
permission, extend or change your program,
or add dependents you can keep your non-
SEVIS 1-20 or DS-2019 document until
August 1, 2003. Please do not discard your
non-SEVIS document after this date. It
should be retained for your records.
Will I need to get the new SEVIS 1-20
signed for travel?
Yes.
Will my dependents need a SEVIS
document?
Yes —in fact all dependents will need to be
entered into SEVIS. This is a big change and
the I-Center will be providing more
information to students with dependents as
to how to provide dependent information.
PLEASE NOTE: Under new regulations F-2
dependents cannot attend school full time.
What effect will SEVIS have on students
and Stanford?
Students who maintain status will see no real
effect. However SEVIS requires reports on
students who are not maintaining full-time
status or who are not enrolled when they
should be. Such students may have to leave
the country and re-enter with a new
document in order to return to status. In
other words SEVIS is not very forgiving. It
is therefore very important that students not
drop below a full course of study without
first discussing the issue with the I-Center.
What does it mean that an F-l student has
to maintain full-time status?
SEVIS makes it very clear that students must
maintain full-time status. For undergraduates
this means 12 units per quarter. For graduate
students Stanford has determined that
enrollment for at least 8 units is considered a
full course of study , although departments
and professional schools may have policies
that require more. TGR is considered full
time enrollment.
Are there circumstances when to less than
a full-course load is permitted?
Yes —but remember that INS assumes that
students are going to be in full-time status
throughout their academic career. The
situations under which less than full-time
enrollment can be approved are: last quarter
prior to graduation; documented medical;
one quarter for documented academic
and the I-Center must authorize the reduced
course load in advance.
What happens if I drop below a full
course load?
Only a DSO at the I-Center can approve a
student dropping below a full course load.
As we are required to report students who
drop below a full course load without prior
permission from the I-Center it is very
important that students discuss their situation
with the I-Center before dropping below a
full course load.
Will SEVIS affect my ability to work on
or off Campus?
No. Practical Training and Curricular
Practical Training remain in place for F-l
students. However you will have to apply for
Post-Completion OPT before you graduate.
F-l students will now be allowed a further
12 months of OPT if you enroll in a new
degree level after completing the first
degree.
Do I have to report any change of address
to both the I-Center and to INS directly?
SEVIS requires that the I-Center report
address changes to the INS. Students will
need to report a change of address to the I-
Center within 10 days of the address change.
The I-Center will then need to report this
change within 21 days. We will be providing
further information. We also recommend that
you continue to report address changes to the
INS using the AR-11 form. Students who
need to comply with the National Security
Entry-Exit registration System (NSEERS)
also need to report an address change to that
system.
How will SEVIS affect obtaining a visa to
enter the L.S?
There are numerous policies that are
delaying the issuance of visas. SEVIS should
not add extra delays and, in the future, may
help in expediting visa issuance.
SEVIS also limits when you can enter the
U.S. before beginning your program of study
or research. You will be allowed to enter
only 30 days prior to the beginning date
listed on your SEVIS I-20/DS-2019.
Can I still get a program extension or
change degree level?
Yes
What should F-l and J-l students and
scholars do to prepare for SEVIS?
• The I-Center staff are available to answer
any questions you might have. Don't
hesitate to ask for assistance. The
information provided in this memo is an
overview of SEVIS
• Students and scholars will receive a direct
email or letter providing further details.
• Further information on SEVIS can be
found on the I-Center web site:

SEVIS INFORMATION FOR STANFORD INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS & SCHOLARS ON F & J VISAS
What is SEVIS?
SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor
Information System, a federally mandated
electronic system by which Stanford will
provide information to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) on all F-l and
J-l students, J-l scholars and F-2 and J-2
dependents. Students and scholars will pay a
fee to cover the ongoing operating costs of
SEVIS. This fee is currently set at $54. At
this time there is no information on when the
fee will be implemented or how it will be
paid.
What is the history of SEVIS?
request.
SEVIS now requires that Stanford both keep
this information and provide it to INS on a
regular basis using electronic reporting. This
electronic reporting system has been in the
development stages since 1995. In October
2001, the Patriot Act mandated that SEVIS
would begin by January 2003.
When does SEVIS go into effect?
Schools need to be ready to use SEVIS by
January 30, 2003. There is a phased in
approach as to when students and scholars
will be entered into SEVIS. By August 1,
2003 all current students and scholars will
need to be entered into SEVIS.
SEVIS will produce different looking I-20s
(for F-1 students) or DS-2019s ( —formerly
lAP-66 —for J-l students and scholars).
What information will SEVIS require?
1. Stanford will need to provide quarterly
reports to confirm the enrollment and
attendance of students
2. Stanford will also need to report "events'
such as change of address, change of
degree, employment authorization,
termination, and graduation.
All reporting will have to be done within a
certain time period. The I-Center will be
providing further information on these
SEVIS, therefore, not only produces 1-20
and DS-2019 forms but also requires that
Stanford provides regular electronic reports
to INS throughout the stay of the F-l and J-l
visa holder.
SEVIS also requires the INS to audit
Stanford's compliance every two years.
Can Stanford refuse to send this informa
tion?
No —Colleges that enroll students and
scholars on F-l and J-l visas have to
participate in SEVIS
Can a student or scholar refuse to provide
Information?
No—this is a federal regulation. The Family
Rights and Protection Act (FERPA) does not
apply.
How is information sent to SEVIS?
It is sent electronically and will use
information generated by the student
information system at Stanford. However
there will still be paper procedures with the
INS for such things as Optional Practical
Training.
How often is information sent?
It depends on the information. Changes to a
student's status have to be reported within a
very short time period so the I-Center will
not have much time to verify information.

SEVIS makes it very clear that students must
maintain full-time status. For undergraduates
this means 12 units per quarter. For graduate
students Stanford has determined that
enrollment for at least 8 units is considered a
full course of study , although departments
and professional schools may have policies
that require more. TGR is considered full
time enrollment.
Are there circumstances when to less than
a full-course load is permitted?
Yes —but remember that INS assumes that
students are going to be in full-time status
throughout their academic career. The
situations under which less than full-time
enrollment can be approved are: last quarter
prior to graduation; documented medical;
one quarter for documented academic
and the I-Center must authorize the reduced
course load in advance.
What happens if I drop below a full
course load?
Only a DSO at the I-Center can approve a
student dropping below a full course load.
As we are required to report students who
drop below a full course load without prior
permission from the I-Center it is very
important that students discuss their situation
with the I-Center before dropping below a
full course load.
Will SEVIS affect my ability to work on
or off Campus?
No. Practical Training and Curricular
Practical Training remain in place for F-l
students. However you will have to apply for
Post-Completion OPT before you graduate.
F-l students will now be allowed a further
12 months of OPT if you enroll in a new
degree level after completing the first
degree.
Do I have to report any change of address
to both the I-Center and to INS directly?
SEVIS requires that the I-Center report
address changes to the INS. Students will
need to report a change of address to the I-
Center within 10 days of the address change.
The I-Center will then need to report this
change within 21 days. We will be providing
further information. We also recommend that
you continue to report address changes to the
INS using the AR-11 form. Students who
need to comply with the National Security
Entry-Exit registration System (NSEERS)
also need to report an address change to that
system.
How will SEVIS affect obtaining a visa to
enter the L.S?
There are numerous policies that are
delaying the issuance of visas. SEVIS should
not add extra delays and, in the future, may
help in expediting visa issuance.
SEVIS also limits when you can enter the
U.S. before beginning your program of study
or research. You will be allowed to enter
only 30 days prior to the beginning date
listed on your SEVIS I-20/DS-2019.
Can I still get a program extension or
change degree level?
Yes
