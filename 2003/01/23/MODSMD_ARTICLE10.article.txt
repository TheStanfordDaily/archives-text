PARIS (AP) — Countering blunt
talk of war by the Bush administration,
France and Germany yesterday insist
ed that they are committed to a peace
ful solution to the Iraq crisis.
"War is not inevitable," French
President Jacques Chirac told a his
toric joint session of the French and
German parliaments. "The only
framework fora legitimate solution is
the United Nations."

The statement —made during a cer
emony marking 40 years of reconcilia
tion between the once-hostile nations —
came as the top U.S. military comman
der declared American forces could re
main in a high state of readiness for
months if necessary.
Chirac said both nations agreed
that any decision to attack Iraq
should be made only by the U.N. Se
curity Council, after U.N. weapons

inspectors have reported their find
ings.
"For us, war is always the proof of
failure and the worst of solutions, so
everything must be done to avoid it,"
Chirac said.
France, one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, hint
ed this week that it could use its veto
power on the issue, while Schroeder
has made plain that Germany will

refuse to back an Iraq war resolution in
the council.
Britain — the closest U.S. ally on
Iraq — has said it would prefer Secu
rity Council support. But Prime Min
ister Tony Blair said yesterday his
country would back a U.S.-led war
without United Nations support if
any countries imposed "unreason
able blockage" of a Security Council
resolution.
