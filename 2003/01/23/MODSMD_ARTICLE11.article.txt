# Venezuelan court postpones vote

### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — In a setback for op
position efforts to oust Hugo Chavez, the Supreme
Court yesterday indefinitely postponed a nationwide
referendum that would have asked Venezuelans
whether the president should quit.
Hours later, Chavez moved to bolster Venezuela's
strike-damaged economy, saying he would impose
foreign exchange controls to prevent Venezuela's
currency from further plummeting. The Central
Bank had suspended foreign currency trading earli
er in the day.
The high court decision came just 11 days before
the scheduled vote. The decision stunned the op
position that delivered 2 million signatures in No
vember to demand the referendum and backed it
up with a strike that has lasted 52 days. It was also to
pay for the vote because Chavez's government re
fused to do so.
Chavez opponents vowed to step up street protests
— a stark contrast to hopes raised Tuesday by Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Jimmy Carter, who presented
both sides with electoral proposals to end the crisis.
The referendum wouldn't be binding, but oppo
nents hoped that a poor showing would increase po
litical pressure on Chavez to quit.
Chavez argued that Venezuela's constitution allows
a binding referendum midway through his six-year
term, or August. Opponents cited a constitutional
clause that allows citizens to petition for referendums
on "matters of national importance" at any time.
The strike has slashed oil production in the
world's fifth-largest petroleum exporter by more
than two-thirds — crippling an industry that pro
vides half of government revenue and 70 percent of
export revenue.
Chavez was elected in 1998 and re-elected in 2000
on promises to help the country's poor majority, but
he has failed to remedy the nation's economic ills.
Opponents blame Chavez's leftist policies for an es
timated 8 percent economic contraction in 2002.
Chavez blames it on opposition attempts to destabilize
the country.
