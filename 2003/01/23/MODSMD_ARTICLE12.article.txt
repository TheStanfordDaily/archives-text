## The 						Stanford Daily SIC provides students with more diverse options 
### 
Three years ago the ASSU intro
duced the Student Initiated
Courses (SIC) program, allow
ing students to organize courses
with a faculty sponsor on topics that de
partments have not chosen to offer. We sup
port this program, which gives students
more of a say in their education and broad
ens the spectrum for academic inquiry on
campus. The University should recognize
its importance by encouraging the partici
pation of faculty sponsors.
SIC is a truly democratic student initia
tive driven by the student body and funded
by an ASSU special fee that students sup
ported by a 76-percent vote last year. It
gives students the opportunity to share
with the community their passion and
knowledge about specific topics. As are-

search university, Stanford should promote
such initiatives because research gains
meaning only when it is shared, and SIC
compliments the numerous research op
portunities offered to both graduate and
undergraduate students.
As a student group, SIC has faced chal
lenges in transitioning from year to year.
This underscores the necessity to raise
awareness of the program among all sec
tions of campus, especially for graduate stu
dents who have had limited involvement in
the program. Given the focused nature of
graduate research and strong connections
with faculty, they are perfect candidates to
lead courses.
It is important to remember that while
these courses are proposed by students,
they are truly collaborations with faculty

members who help formulate the syllabus
and evaluate papers. Critics of the program
have questioned the academic standards of
these classes and whether students should
still receive units. The one or two units that
students receive are important to legitimize
the classes and reward students both lead
ing and participating in the classes.
The academic standards of the program
are maintained by the faculty sponsor. He or
she goes over the readings and syllabus and
grades final projects. In this way the courses
are much like directed readings. The main
difference is that SIC courses are driven by
student interest and promote the sharing of
knowledge between students.
