## Sweet, sweet lucidity 
### 
Th e demands of a Stanford ed
ucation on students' time and
energy can often preclude in
volvement in extracurricular
activities. The pursuit of academic excel
lence can, regrettably, force students to re
frain from traditional, subscholastic col
lege fun in the spirit of "Animal House,"
"Tommy Boy" and "Van Wilder." It is my
mission in this week's column to inform
you of an invaluable skill which can em
power you, the overstressed, to achieve all
you ever wanted to without making con
cessions in your overbooked schedule.
This skill is lucid dreaming.
While lucid dreaming has recently
made appearances in the movies "Vanilla
Sky" and "Waking Life," only the latter
(with a more limited release) explored the

phenomenon at length.
And while Stanford's
very own Stephen
Laßerge, a research asso
ciate in the Psychology
Department, coined the
phrase "lucid dreaming,"
I have encountered few
students with any idea
what it means.

According to the Lucidity Institute,
lucid dreaming is "dreaming while know
ing you are dreaming." Many people, I
have found, claim to have achieved lucidi
ty by this minimalist definition. But what
distinguishes lucid dreaming from a pas
sive, half-conscious suspicion that one is
dreaming is, fittingly, lucidity — that is,
the sensory and mental clarity of the
dream experience. When you become
lucid, there is absolutely nothing that dis
tinguishes dream from waking. Lucidity
endows you with full autonomy to guide
your dream in any conceivable direction.
I can say without exaggeration that it
has been one of the most rewarding expe
riences of my life. It can fill me with an al
most religious exultation. I achieve lucidi
ty five to seven nights a week when I prac
tice it; I become a fanatical proponent of
lucidity all the waking day.
It is impossible to overstate this. You
can do whatever you want. The mere
sense of possibility can be overwhelming.
Unfortunately, lucid dreaming can re
quire quite a bit of practice. Exercises in
clude conducting frequent "double-takes"
of clocks and printed text. For example,
make a habit of glancing at your watch dur
ing the (waking) day. Then look away and
back again. When this simple habit begins
to carry over into your dreams, you will dis
cover that, more often than not, the time on
your watch will have completely changed.
The same inconsistency often shows up in
text. It is your cue: You are dreaming.
One of the more effective and easier ex
ercises for me has been casual skepticism;
I will often simply wonder, "Dream or
waking?" several times a day. When this
musing springs up in my dreams and I
cannot say with certainty whether I'm

dreaming, then I must be.
And then I am free to fly, to breathe un
derwater, to see — in the full panoply of
color and light — lands I have only
viewed in photographs and paintings.
I have tested the scope of realism in these
dreams. I have pored over the color and
texture of individual leaves. I have tasted
food (Jack Daniel's mustard, curiously) to
test the richness of my dream gustation. In
every single case, the sensations I experi
ence in dreams are as strong and distinct (in
deed, as lucid) as the sensations of waking.
Of course, everybody has stories of
bizarre dreams and nightmares. Some
people even vividly recollect dreams from
their early childhood. But it is something
else to exercise free will in a world of limit
less fantasy. In one of my earliest experi
ences with lucidity, I announced to an au
ditorium full of people that I was their god
(wasn't I?). When they did not respond
deferentially, I used telekinesis to send
one of them flying across the room.
In another dream, a group of Enrique
Iglesias' bodyguards were chasing me
throughout his mansion. In mid-stride I
became lucid and simply leapt out the near
est window and descended weightlessly
and safely to the ground. It was one of my
first experiences with dream flying, a sensa
tion that rivals anything I have ever seen,
felt or imagined, waking or dreaming.
It is hard to make a case for cultivating
and practicing the skill of lucid dreaming
because sleep, after all, bears a stigma
among workaholic college students. Sleep
has come to suggest overindulgence and
sloth. Not only college students, but also
investment bankers and financial analysts,
proudly recite the nominal amount of
sleep they receive as a testament to their
diligence and industry.
My parents always admonish me for
sleeping past 2 p.m., unaware of my need
to reduce the insurmountable sleep debt I
run up each quarter at Stanford. My
friends scoff at me when I confess that I
have backed out of 9 a.m. classes because
of my commitment to slumber.
Lucidity could restore the status of
sleep. Sleep itself can be productive; lucid
dreaming has been used to practice instru
ments, solve problems and even rehearse
real world situations. (Although it's not
easy to resist the impulse to wander and ex
plore the terrains of pure consciousness.)
The fact is that every dream without lu
cidity is a wasted dream. These dreams con
stitute a transitory succession of images ab
sorbed by an inert consciousness. Lucidity
is freedom to go and see and do everything
you ever imagined. In "Caligula," Albert
Camus wrote, "If I sleep, who'll give me the
moon?" He may have had it backward.

Craig Albrecht often worries that his brain unll reject
linking life for his much more exciting lucid exis
tence. To learn more about lucid dreaming, lisit
