SCPJ clarifies Hoover Institution column
Since the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice's column, "Is the
Hoover Institution compatible with Stan
ford's goals?" (Jan. 16) has been widely
misunderstood, and in the interest of pro
moting informed debate, we have decid
ed to clarify and expand our position.
For example, in William Hauk's Jan.
17 letter to the editor ("Challenge to
Hoover opponents: Get rid of'institution
al bias' in all departments"), he writes that
we ought to "work towards eliminating a
lopsided political bias from infiltrating
our academic departments." To this end,
Hauk wants to see a survey of the political
affiliations of all academic departments
and address with concern any depart
ment which shows bias from any region of
the political spectrum.
Hauk does not write this, but if he be
lieves (as is suggested by the tone of his
piece) that SCPJ's criticism of this rela
tionship is motivated by our political op
position to the number of Republicans in
the Hoover Institution, he is mistaken.
The scholars at Hoover have every right
to hold any political belief they should
choose, and their choices do not generate
our opposition to Stanford's relationship
with Hoover.
Of course, any member of Stanford's
(non-Hoover) faculty holds the same
right. As pointed out in our original piece,
Stanford University is prohibited from
using political or social views in the hiring
of faculty, and if any hiring in any depart
ment violated this standard it should be
investigated, but it is hard to see how
knowledge of the political makeup of a

particular academic department could be
helpful.
No one is suggesting, and with good
reason, that we get rid of the Economics
Department if it becomes too conservative
or the Feminist Studies Department if it
leans too far to the left.
The Web sites of both departments
emphasize that the purpose of each de
partment is academic. The Economics
Department seeks to inform students'
critical and analytic capacities in econom
ic subjects, and the Feminist Studies De
partment gives its mission as the "investi
gation of the significance of gender in all
areas of human life." Neither contains
any overt political goal, as does the mis
sion statement of the Hoover Institution.
The problem arises when these political
goals result in the consideration of a fel
low's political views as a component of
hiring decisions.
As John Raisian, director of the Hoover
Institution, put it in the San Francisco
Chronicle on February 24, 1995:
"[Hoover] tends to be suspicious of bigger
and more expensive government....
People who look to the government to try
to solve problems are not the type who will
fit in well." It is this necessity to "fit in,"
combined with Hoover's ability to attract
and retain Stanford faculty through joint
appointments, that seems to contradict
the University's policy, which is designed
to ensure academic freedom in all aspects
of University life.
If Hoover is going to continue to use its
affiliation with Stanford to enhance its
prestige, we must have assurance that we
can expect no possible future compromise
of the University's values. This means

holding the Hoover Institution to the
same standards met by our diverse aca
demic departments â€” which, for Hoover,
means an elimination of political criteria in
the hiring of fellows.
STANFORD COMMUNITY FOR
PEACE AND JUSTICE
University has obligation to
surrounding community
In a recent editorial, The Stanford Daily
argued that Santa Clara County made a
wise choice in removing two trails near
Matadero Creek from study because doing
so will allow the University to save about
$170,000 during tough financial times
("County decision on trial debate a fair solu
tion," Jan. 14). However, the writers of the
editorial may not be aware that the county
offered to pay for the study. They may also
not be aware that the University is planning
to spend $8 to $9 million on a trail that it is
proposing next to Alpine Road, despite
widespread opposition from nearby resi
dents, community groups, environmental
ists and trail users concerned about safety,
and despite the existence of much cheaper
alternatives. Extensive and cosdy engineer
ing studies have already been completed,
which include moving Alpine Road. Clear
ly, money is not the primary issue.
The underlying issues are simple. In
2000, Stanford asked Santa Clara County
for the right to expand die campus by
roughly one-third over 10 years. Area envi
ronmental and community groups did not
oppose this massive expansion, but did ask
for and receive a few measures to benefit the
surrounding community and the environ
ment as conditions on the General Use Per
mit. The condition that Stanford dedicate
two recreational trails, one near Matadero
Creek and another near San Francisquito
and Los Trancos Creeks, was included in
die GUP. Stanford's approach to dealing
with this requirement to date is to offer trails
with little or no recreational value and to
threaten litigation. The University may
deny threatening to sue, but the record
shows that the Board of Supervisors dis

cussed this matter in closed session, and the
only issues that can be discussed in closed
session are personnel matters, negotiations
to purchase property and litigation.
Naturally, Stanford can and should
protect its interests. But it should also rec
ognize its legal and moral obligation to
provide outstanding recreational trails
that connect to the public open space
areas in the foothills. The two trail alter
natives that the University fought to have
removed from further study near
Matadero Creek would have been a
tremendous asset for both the Stanford
community and the people that live in the
surrounding areas. Neither of these pro
posals would interfere with potential fu
ture uses in the area, and one is on the
very edge of Stanford lands. Stanford of

ficials should reconsider their opposition
to these win-win alternatives and have
them put back on the table for study. The
goodwill this move would generate would
help erase the legacy of years of adminis
tration hardball tactics with the surround
ing community.
JEFFSEGALL
Chairperson, Stanford Open Space Alliance
Head of anti-war group 'defends
mass murderers'
In a recent article, The Daily coneedy
pointed out that the latest anti-war protests
across the country were organized by a
group called International A.N.S.W.E.R.

("Stanford students join diverse S.F. protest
crowd," Jan. 21). Since several dozen Stan
ford students participated in the protest in
San Francisco, perhaps they would care to
find out a bit more about die group that
they have chosen to associate with.
International A.N.S.W.E.R. was found
ed by Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attor
ney general. But how many of the anti-war
protesters know that Clark is also well
known for having legally defended the
Serbian dictator and mass murderer Slo
bodan Milosevic and the Egyptian Sheik
Omar Abdel Rahman, the chief planner
and organizer of the first World Trade
Center bombing in 1993? Do Stanford stu
dents not object that the man who is lead
ing their anti-war crusade runs a side busi
ness providing legal defense for perpetra

tors of genocide and terrorism?
The list of International AN.S.W.E.R.'s
"coalition co-signers" reads like a hodge
podge of disparate and sometimes contra
dictory far-left causes coupled with at least
half a dozen communist parties from
around the world. Prominendy featured
on the "steering committee" is the Korea
Truth Commission, a North Korea-fund
ed group. Do the Stanford anti-war
protesters really believe in these groups'
mishmash of extremist causes? If not, how
can they compromise all of their principles
by marching in unity with these extremists,
headed by a man who defends mass mur
derers?
