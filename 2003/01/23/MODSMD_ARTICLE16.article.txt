# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Are international conflicts really clashes of civilization? 
### S. NAGEEB M. ALI GUEST COLUMNIST 
As our world is about to be engulfed
once more with war, we are presented
with the image of an inevitable clash of civ
ilizations. This war, like the war with
Afghanistan, will be posed in terms of
freedom and dictatorship, modernity and
antiquity, liberty and oppression. If I
were to find 10 faults with this war (and
believe me, I find many more), I would
find a thousand with the rhetoric that sur
rounds it.
It is deficient thinking to believe that
this world comprises separate civilizations
and that the United States has just en
countered those other civilizations. Glob
alization is a process that began neither
with the World Trade Organization nor
the League of Nations. It began long ago
and has recently included moments in
which the United States supported harsh
dictatorial rule in Latin America and the
Middle East. That the U.S. did not sup
port democracy in these countries is un
surprising: You cannot simultaneously
want democracy and dictate another
country's policies. The "Arab" or "Islamic"
civilization has been shaped, to a large ex

tent, by Western Europe and the U.S. and
is hardly "separate."
It is also deficient to believe that identi
ty and values can be divided amongst civi
lizations; it is an attribute of ethics — both
good and evil — that neither culture nor
religion has monopoly over it. It is clear
that intolerance is easy to find in any na
tion, but it is equally clear that voices have
risen in favor of freedom in distinct and
distant cultures, in the same way that cries
for peace rise in unison across the world.
As much as cultures do not own values,
no nation has a monopoly over grief and
sadness. As a Bengali looks at the Twin
Towers' smoldering remains of a thou
sand voices silenced, he will empathize, re
calling genocide in his country. Were he a
Jew, his mind may have turned to the
Holocaust. And I could go on for people of
many different nations: Chinese, Soma
lians, Palestinians and many others. All of
our lives have felt catastrophe, and none of
us have been invulnerable.
This realization is essential. In the days
since Sept. 11, the U.S. has justified its ac
tions in a you-could-not-possibly-under
stand-our-grief tone, showing a tremen
dous disregard for world opinion and in
ternational law. Yet in reality, the cries for

peace are largely shaped by empathy; it is
not blind prejudice but knowledge of
death that has stirred hundreds of thou
sand across the world to protest and speak.
These "peacemongers" do feel the tragedy
of Sept. 11, but they equally mourn
Afghan families now lost like dust in the
wind and fear for the Iraqi innocent.
Today, the threat of the "Islamic civi
lization" lurks in the air. These fears are
not completely unfounded. Some coun
tries that are predominantly Muslim
have shown an alarming degree of intol
erance and warmongering, and there is
no doubt that Islam, as it is taught to
some (but certainly few) Muslims, lends
itself to the death and destruction we
have seen. As a Muslim, I would be the
first to agree that "Islamic" countries
need drastic reform. It is a serious cate
gory mistake, however, to attribute all of
these issues to religion. The entire de
veloping world, with people of all faiths,
has been symptomatic of the same dis
eases, and it was not a century ago that
much of the "Western world" pillaged
and controlled far-away lands, its peo
ple, its children and its women in very
wanton ways.
Of course, the "Islamic civilization"

was not always so. If one were to examine
history, there are many concepts that we
mistakenly identify as Western values
that lie within Islam. Beyond the world of
science (let us note that the "Al" in algo
rithm, algebra and Al Saud is not a mere
coincidence), the early "Islamic civiliza
tion" encouraged discourse, debate, ra
tional thought, poetry, literature and
learning. Ideas within Islam were not
held in isolation: It was an Englishman
who translated the Al-Khwarizmi book
on algebra from Arabic to Latin, and
Muslims traveled as far as China to seek
knowledge. Even more recently, it is
being shown that Goethe, the 18th-cen
tury writer, drew inspiration from Islam.
The examples of how the "Islamic" and
"Western" civilizations are not so differ
ent are many and are naked to the eye
when the eye is opened.
Today, when I am asked why American
Muslims have not spoken out against the
acts of Sept. 11,1 am dumbfounded. Since
that day, American Muslims have shared
the grief of losing their kith, kin and coun
trymen, and simultaneously felt anger at
seeing their faith smeared by a terrible
crime. Our Friday services, our writings,
our speeches and our searches for com

inon ground with the U.S. government all
took a tone that may be mistaken for apol
ogy, but in reality reflected our grief, anger
and support. On our very own campus, the
Muslim Students Awareness Network
chose to do an Islamic Awareness Week on
"Islam in America," that, in part, appreci
ated the deep connections between Islam
and the values we believe that we hold as
Americans.
What does this have to do with us at
Stanford? Thrust in a world of tremen
dous comfort for us, and truly merciless
destitution for many others, we have the
opportunity to learn, live, understand and
shape the world through our words and
actions. In perhaps one of the world's first
anthropological forays, the early Iranian
mathematician Alberuni protested in the
early 11th century against the fact that
"depreciation of foreigners is common to
all nations towards each other." If a mil
lennium later, we are unable to change
this, the world's nations shall truly clash—
but the clash should not be characterized
as that of civilizations.
