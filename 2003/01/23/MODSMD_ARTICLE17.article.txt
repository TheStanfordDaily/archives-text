## No. 1 Card men face first Pac-10 road trip 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some people might say that
being the No. 1 ranked men's swim
ming team in the country comes
with its fair share of pressure.

at No. 14 Arizona, Friday, 2:00 p.m
at No. 13 Arizona St., Saturday,
12:00 p.m.

According to Stanford head
coach Skip Kenney, however, the
top spot is the least stressful place
to be — a good thing given the
Cardinal's recent ascent to the No.
1 position in the polls.
"It's really only the ranking at
the end of the year that matters to
us," Kenney said. "Right now, it is
a great feeling to be ranked by
your peers as the top team, and I
don't think it puts any negative
pressure on us. When your team is
ranked seventh or eighth, that's
when the pressure to move up re
ally sets in."
Following wins over then-No. 1
Michigan and Cal State-Bakers
field two weeks ago, the Cardinal
(4-0) took over the No. 1 spot in the
College Swimming Coaches Asso
ciation of America Top 25 poll.
"We had quite possibly our best
Christmas training ever," Kenney
said. "After that we went right into
the Michigan meet, and the follow
ing week the guys were unbeliev
able in practice. Usually when you
go so long without competition
and then jump into a race like that,
you see a little slump afterwards. I
was really surprised to see the guys
train at an even higher level after
swimming against Michigan."
Stanford plans to use this mo
mentum to get through back-to
back dual meets at Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend.
Though Kenney expects strong
performances from his swimmers,
his main focus in Arizona is not on
winning. Instead, he wants them
to get used to traveling and to
competing on consecutive days.
"This is our first big chance this
year at competing on the road,"
Kenney said. "In the past this has

been a pretty good traveling team.
It's important right now for them
to get used to the flying and then
sleeping in hotels. Everything that
we do from here on out is a dress
rehearsal for the NCAA Champi
onships [in March].
"I don't think these guys would
mind if we had to lose a meet as
long as it would help us be better
off in the long run. We have so
many talented swimmers, though,
that I just think it would be tough
for Arizona or Arizona State to
beat them."
Though No. 14 Arizona and
No. 13 Arizona State both have
several strong individual swim
mers, the teams lack the depth that
makes the Cardinal stand out
among collegiate programs.
Arizona junior Juan Veloz
turned in a time of 1 minute, 42.72
seconds in the 200-yard butterfly
at the Texas Invitational last
month, a time several seconds
faster than any Cardinal perfor
mance this season. Despite Veloz's
performance, however, Arizona
only finished in eighth place at the
meet.
Arizona State finished fourth at
the Dallas Morning News Classic
last weekend.
"If we swim like we did against
Michigan, we can see some pretty
great things happen," said senior
co-captain Randall Bal. "The
freshmen have made some giant
leaps, and our guys know how im
portant each meet is as a stepping
stone for the rest of the season. It
was easy to blow off some of the
early-season meets because the
competition wasn't all that great,
but now every meet is going to be
competitive."
When the Cardinal returns to
California next week, the captains
and Kenney plan to conduct a
team meeting to discuss what the
team did well and what it can do
better.
"What I really want these guys
to see with each meet is how much
they can learn — from themselves
and from each other," Kenney
said. "I want them to ask them-

ranked Michigan squad, the Cardinal swimmers will face Arizona and Ari
