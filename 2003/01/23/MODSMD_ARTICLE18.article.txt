# Track's early results bode well for season

### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
While many Stanford students
spent the weekend skiing at
Tahoe, the Stanford women's
pole vaulters opened their in
door season just down the road in
Reno, Nev., at the 2003 Pole
Vault Summit.
The rest of the team hosted an
intrasquad meet on Sunday to
kick off what promises to be a suc
cessful indoor track season.
Junior Leila Ben-Youssef and
freshman Samantha Shepard led
the Cardinal at the Pole Vault
Summit, both tying for ninth place
and clearing a height of 3.60 me
ters (11 feet, 9.75 inches) in the top
section of the women's collegiate
competition.
Senior All-American Kathleen
Donoghue also cleared 3.60 me
ters, but misses in earlier rounds
left her tied for 13th.
"The heights weren't that
great, but it shows great promise
for the pole vaulters," Ben-
Youssef said.
The rest of the team competed
against each other and members
of the Nike Farm Team as a shake
down before its official indoor sea
son begins.
Odd distances not normally
seen in college racing — the 500-,
1,200- and 2,000-meter races —
were also contested.
And although this was hardly
full-competition mode for the ath
letes, the meet saw some impres
sive times and marks across the
board.
The long jumpers didn't use
.the entire ..runway. tt>. attain top
speed, but that didn't stop senior
Milton Little from posting an
early-season 23-5. Freshman

Solomon Welch also had an im
pressive showing, jumping over
22 feet.
The distances in the weight
throw were not announced, but it
wasn't hard to tell that the squad is
fine-tuning its form and building
its strength to perform well when
it counts.
"The results from the throwers
were solid," said senior thrower
Nick Welihozkiy. "It's early in the
season and the intrasquad meet
helps to establish a mile-marker
for athletes as to where they are
now and where they want and
need to be."
The sprinters looked to be in
great early-season form, filling
most of the track's nine lanes in
both the men's and women's 60-
meter races. For the first time in
several years, it looks as if the
sprint squad may be able to impact
the national scene.
The distance squad put on a
great show, as always, in the
women's 1,200 and 2,000 races
and the men's 2,000 and 3,000.
Sophomore Jeane Goff was in
good form, outkicking her team
mates in the women's 2,000, and
junior Seth Hejny closed with a
57-second last lap in the men's
2,000 to finish right behind for
mer Stanford Ail-American
Jonathan Riley '02.
"I thought that the intrasquad
meet went great," said sophomore
Evan Fox, who ran in the 2,000.
"Personally, I still have a lot to
work on, but this was definitely a
good start."
Overall, the Cardinal looks
poised to have one of its best in
door and outdoor seasons ever as
the squads all come together to
make one of the most dominant
teams in the nation. •

"The intrasquad meet's main
emphasis was to get the team to
gether in one venue and promote
team unity and spirit," said Weli
hozkiy, "and that goal was
reached."
The Cardinal will be looking to
build on this early success in per
formances and team-building at
the Western Indoor Classic in
Boise, Idaho, this Saturday.
Focus at this meet will now turn

to posting qualifying marks for the
Indoor National Championships
to be held in March.
Both the men's and women's
teams will be comprised of experi
enced national qualifiers and am
bitious, talented freshmen.
