# Kirk faces rival Kovacs in ASU showdown
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two minutes, 7.36 seconds. That is how long
it took Stanford junior Tara Kirk to swim to a
victory and an American record in the 200-yard
breaststroke at last year's NCAA Champi
onships.
Women's Swimming

at No. 10 Arizona, Friday, 1:00 p.m.
at No. 16 Arizona St., Saturday, 11:00 a.m

Twenty-eight hundredths of a second be
hind Kirk on that day was Arizona State's then
freshman Agnes Kovacs. Kovacs, who happens
to be the 2000 Olympic gold medalist in the
200-meter breaststroke, is one of the few swim
mers in the nation that can match up to Kirk.
The two athletes have met four times in their
collegiate careers in the 200-yard breast, and
Kovacs has triumph in three of those races. But
Kirk's victory in the NCAA championship sure
ly sticks out as the only one that matters.
This weekend, when the Cardinal begins it's
series of Pacific-10 Conference meets, Kovacs
and Kirk will have a chance to meet again.
Kirk seems more than ready for the chal
lenge.
"I think that I am mature enough as a com

petitor to look forward to racing someone who is
just as good as I am," Kirk said. "Agnes is a great
athlete and competitor. I think that both of us
will lay it on the line and see who touches first."
According to Stanford coach Richard Quick,
Kirk's win in the 200 at NCAAs required a "su
perb effort" from her, as the matchup was in
credibly close. Predicting the outcome of this

weekend's race would be impossible, he said.
"[Kirk] just has to be the best that she can
be," said Quick. "It'll be a tremendous race."
The entire weekend could be unpredictable,
as Kirk and her Cardinal teammates face off
against No. 10 Arizona and No. 16 Arizona
