# Dashing through the snow, with your house on the Row... but
## HOW LOW CAN SKI-TRIP COSTS GO? 
### STEPHANIE CONDON 
Fora weekend in Tahoe, $40
did not seem exorbitant to sopho
more Loro resident Connie Chen,
who expressed delight that her
dorm landed luxurious accommo
dations for its ski trip.
"We were really lucky and
ended up staying in a four-story
Swiss castle," she said. "It had a hot
tub, a beautiful deck and even a
bar, though it was empty. I know
that most dorms usually aren't so
lucky."
But does the cost of dorm snow
trips ever discourage students
from participating?
The Office of Residential Edu
cation tries to make such trips af
fordable to anyone who wants to
go.
Winter quarter snow trips are
typically subsidized or fully spon
sored by residences and have
probably been a Stanford tradition
"as long as there has been snow in
the mountains," said Jane Camar
illo, director of Res Ed.
Senior Sara Wampler, a resi
dent assistant in Loro, said stu
dents in her dorm paid $40 to go
on the ski trip. The rest of the ex
penses were subsidized by the
dorm and totaled about $400, an
additional $9 per person.
Residents of Castafio paid $10
to attend their dorm's ski trip but
were given $25 for spending
money once they got there, ac
cording to sophomore Jeff Lee,

the dorm treasurer.
"About 50 percent of the dorm
funds were spent on the ski trip,"
Lee said.
Much of the funding is allocat
ed by Res Ed, and dorms are al
lowed to use the money at their
own discretion.
Still, is the subsidy enough?
The cost of renting skis and snow
equipment can climb into the hun
dred-dollar range.
Chen said she found a better
deal that made it able for her to ski.
"Originally I thought I couldn't
afford to go skiing, but then 1
heard it only costs an extra $30,"
she said.
Chen said that Gavilan, which
paid the same amount as her dorm
did per person, stayed in"a tiny
building that looked like the
garage or outhouse of our lodge."
"After comparing their accom
modations to ours, I felt that I got
a pretty good deal for paying as lit
tle as I did for the weekend," Chen
said.
For students who cannot afford
the cost of their dorm's ski trip, ad
ditional assistance is available. Res
idential staff members are asked
"to share with students that, if fi
nances are a concern . . . [addi
tional] funding can be found," ac
cording to Camarillo.
Such expenses are subsidized
by a Res Ed program fund avail
able to resident fellows.
No one from Loro asked for fi
nancial assistance for the trip, ac

cording to Wampler.
"1 found this to be surprising,"
she said. "In my dorm last year, a
couple of students asked for assis
tance; they seemed uncomfortable
asking, but no one other than the
staff knew that they asked, so I
don't think they felt uncomfort
able on the trip."
Some students, like Chen, are
skeptical of the need for further fi
nancial assistance to attend a dorm
snow trip.
"I don't really believe it when
people say that can't shell out
$40," she said. "It came right after
Christmas, so if someone really
wanted to go, he could have
worked over Christmas or re
quested it as a Christmas present.
Ski trips sound expensive, but they
really aren't."
But the expense of a dorm ski
trip can prove burdensome to stu
dents with less financial freedom.
"I have talked with students in
the past about the pressures
of.. . having fewer financial re
sources that require students to
have part-time jobs and to work all
summer to buy books," Camarillo
said. "Students have talked about
the sacrifices that they make to be
able to attend Stanford, so they
feel it not prudent to spend addi
tional funds on a trip to the moun
tains given their priorities.
"These students are making
very tough choices and our goal is
to be sure that the house-bonding
intent behind planning a snow
trip does not result in dividing the
community."
That's why dorm staffs tout
snow trips as enriching experi
ences that all students should be
able to attend, regardless of finan
cial limitations.

"Fora dorm, a successful trip
can be everything, since it can so
lidify connections between peo
ple and groups and can either
break down or reinforce cliques
that may have started to form,"
Wampler said. "The fact that
people get to ski, or see an area
they have never been to before, is
a nice experience — but it is the
interactive social environment
that is truly valuable."

cording to Wampler.
"1 found this to be surprising,"
she said. "In my dorm last year, a
couple of students asked for assis
tance; they seemed uncomfortable
asking, but no one other than the
staff knew that they asked, so I
don't think they felt uncomfort
able on the trip."
Some students, like Chen, are
skeptical of the need for further fi
nancial assistance to attend a dorm
snow trip.
"I don't really believe it when
people say that can't shell out
$40," she said. "It came right after
Christmas, so if someone really
wanted to go, he could have
worked over Christmas or re
quested it as a Christmas present.
Ski trips sound expensive, but they
really aren't."
But the expense of a dorm ski
trip can prove burdensome to stu
dents with less financial freedom.
"I have talked with students in
the past about the pressures
of.. . having fewer financial re
sources that require students to
have part-time jobs and to work all
summer to buy books," Camarillo
said. "Students have talked about
the sacrifices that they make to be
able to attend Stanford, so they
feel it not prudent to spend addi
tional funds on a trip to the moun
tains given their priorities.
"These students are making
very tough choices and our goal is
to be sure that the house-bonding
intent behind planning a snow
trip does not result in dividing the
community."
That's why dorm staffs tout
snow trips as enriching experi
ences that all students should be
able to attend, regardless of finan
cial limitations.

"Fora dorm, a successful trip
can be everything, since it can so
lidify connections between peo
ple and groups and can either
break down or reinforce cliques
that may have started to form,"
Wampler said. "The fact that
people get to ski, or see an area
they have never been to before, is
a nice experience — but it is the
interactive social environment
that is truly valuable."
