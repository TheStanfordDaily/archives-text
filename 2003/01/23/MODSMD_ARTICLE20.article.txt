perennial powerhouse Long Beach
State to claim the men's team title at the
California State Indoor Archery Cham
pionships in Tulare, Calif., on Jan. 12.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

Several Cardinal archers garnered in
dividual medals, but it was the men's tri
umph over the 15-time defending cham
pion 49er squad that highlighted the
tournament.
The men's team, composed of senior
Mike Lin, co-term student Keith Cole
man and sophomore Sam Chang, de
feated Long Beach by an overwhelming

600 points.
Both Lin and Coleman also took
home individual medals. Lin captured
the silver with a score of 1,034, edging
out Coleman who shot a 1,012 for the
bronze. The gold medal went to Occi
dental College's Adam Androlia, who
placed first with a 1,051.
Chang, sophomore David Lu and
sophomore Sean Tyan, three of Stan
ford's newest archers, also shot high
scores, placing fifth, sixth and 10th, re
spectively.
"We have an amazing balance of ex
perienced shooters and extremely tal
ented beginners," said Coleman, the
team's captain. "Guys like Sam and
David, who first picked up bows fall
quarter, have ramped up at an unheard
of speed and are already putting the heat
on archers from other schools who've
been shooting for years."
Senior Michelle Marco, the captain of
the Stanford women's team, took a silver

medal in her division after outshooting
Long Beach's top woman, who took the
bronze. The gold medal winner in the
women's division was Kate Anderson of
UCLA.
The strong showing by the Cardinal
archers added on to what has already
been a big year for the Stanford archery
program. Both the men and the women
claimed gold at the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships in September, and the team
received increased funding from the
ASSU in October to bolster its efforts.
"This has been a year that surpassed
everyone's expectations for Stanford
archery," said Marco, who helped found
the club in 2000. "With the generous
help of the ASSU, we've been able to sig
nificantly increase the amount of equip
ment we have, and therefore increase
our team's size. We want to be able to
give everyone who wants to a chance to
