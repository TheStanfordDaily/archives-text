### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Community for Peace and Justice
is calling fora re-evaluation of the role of the Hoover
Institution at Stanford.
After an anti-war demonstration last week in
which students marched to Hoover Tower, along
with a column in The Daily raising questions
about Hoover policies, the group is beginning a
campaign to increase student awareness of possi
ble conflicts between University standards and
Hoover Institution policy.
"We're trying to get [Hoover] in line with the
Stanford University academic freedom policy," said
senior Calvin Miaw, co-coordinator of the Commu
nity for Peace and Justice. "Politics should not play a
role in any of the activities there."
The Stanford Community for Peace and Justice,
a student-run organization, sees two main problems
with the Hoover Institution and its relationship with
the University, said Miaw. There is a perception that
the institution as a whole has a political bias and that
this colors the research it conducts.
Miaw also pointed out that many faculty are
hired on one of about 20 joint appointments be
tween University departments and Hoover, and he
said that these faculty are only hired if they agree
with the conservative political bias of the institution.
David Brady, associate director for research at
Hoover, said he is skeptical of calls fora new evalua
tion of the University's connection to the institution.
"The Hoover Institution does not take politi
cal positions as an institution," he said. "The fact
that individual scholars take positions [should
not matter]."
"In appointing faculty, there are certain crite-
