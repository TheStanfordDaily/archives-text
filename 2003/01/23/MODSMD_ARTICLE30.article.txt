# Southern Cal, UCLA visit Maples

### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Home sweet home" rings the familiar
cliche. And after gutting out a tight over
time win at Washington State last Thurs
day, only to fall to an athletic Washington
squad in Seattle two days later, how could
the Stanford men's basketball team not be
excited to return to the comfortable con
fines of Maples Pavilion?

But for the Cardinal, coming home this
weekend is a bit bittersweet in nature. The
same court that aided the team in an
upset of then-No. 11 Xavier in November
and a 24-point romp of then-No. 10 Ore
gon earlier this month holds much more
of an uncertain aura when UCLA comes
to town tonight.
The Bruins are the only Pacific-10
Conference team that has been able to
beat the Cardinal at home in each of the
last three seasons, which, considering the
talent of recent Stanford lineups, has
been no easy task.
In 2000 and 2001, the unranked Bru
ins came in and dethroned Stanford of its
No. 1 ranking and assured themselves of
a spot in the NCAA tournament. In 2002,
UCLA, ranked No. 25, upset the No. 10
Cardinal, confirming the squad's notori
ous trend of coming on strong in the end
of the season.
However, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery doesn't want to set a prece
dent by losing to UCLA at home, and rec
ognizes that the Cardinal has a lot more
to concentrate on if it is to come out with
the win.
"That's not relevant," he said, refer
ring to his team's recent home record
against UCLA. "What's relevant is how we
play. If you are really resorting to tricks
and devices to get your team to play hard,
you have got a problem to begin with.
There shouldn't be any psychological bar
rier to us coming out and competing."

But even if history repeats itself, this
year the Bruins are going to need a lot
more than a successful trek through
Maples to find their way into any postsea
son tournament. Sitting with a disastrous
4-9 record, including a 1-7 mark at home,
UCLA is merely trying to retain a last
shred of respect.
However, while the Bruins are severe
ly lacking in the win department, individ
ually they are as tough as any team in the
Pac-10, a certainty that the Cardinal
hasn't overlooked.
"I think we are going to take this game
like any other," said sophomore forward

Josh Childress. "We realize that their
record may not show it, but they are still a
really good team. We have got to come
out and play hard."
Leading the team is senior forward
Jason Kapono, a bona fide shooter that
demonstrated what he was capable of in a
44-point performance against Washing
ton State on Jan. 4.
Joining Kapono are athletic forwards
