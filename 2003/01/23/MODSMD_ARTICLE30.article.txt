# Southern Cal, UCLA visit Maples

### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
"Home sweet home" rings the familiar
cliche. And after gutting out a tight over
time win at Washington State last Thurs
day, only to fall to an athletic Washington
squad in Seattle two days later, how could
the Stanford men's basketball team not be
excited to return to the comfortable con
fines of Maples Pavilion?

But for the Cardinal, coming home this
weekend is a bit bittersweet in nature. The
same court that aided the team in an
upset of then-No. 11 Xavier in November
and a 24-point romp of then-No. 10 Ore
gon earlier this month holds much more
of an uncertain aura when UCLA comes
to town tonight.
The Bruins are the only Pacific-10
Conference team that has been able to
beat the Cardinal at home in each of the
last three seasons, which, considering the
talent of recent Stanford lineups, has
been no easy task.
In 2000 and 2001, the unranked Bru
ins came in and dethroned Stanford of its
No. 1 ranking and assured themselves of
a spot in the NCAA tournament. In 2002,
UCLA, ranked No. 25, upset the No. 10
Cardinal, confirming the squad's notori
ous trend of coming on strong in the end
of the season.
However, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery doesn't want to set a prece
dent by losing to UCLA at home, and rec
ognizes that the Cardinal has a lot more
to concentrate on if it is to come out with
the win.
"That's not relevant," he said, refer
ring to his team's recent home record
against UCLA. "What's relevant is how we
play. If you are really resorting to tricks
and devices to get your team to play hard,
you have got a problem to begin with.
There shouldn't be any psychological bar
rier to us coming out and competing."

But even if history repeats itself, this
year the Bruins are going to need a lot
more than a successful trek through
Maples to find their way into any postsea
son tournament. Sitting with a disastrous
4-9 record, including a 1-7 mark at home,
UCLA is merely trying to retain a last
shred of respect.
However, while the Bruins are severe
ly lacking in the win department, individ
ually they are as tough as any team in the
Pac-10, a certainty that the Cardinal
hasn't overlooked.
"I think we are going to take this game
like any other," said sophomore forward

Josh Childress. "We realize that their
record may not show it, but they are still a
really good team. We have got to come
out and play hard."
Leading the team is senior forward
Jason Kapono, a bona fide shooter that
demonstrated what he was capable of in a
44-point performance against Washing
ton State on Jan. 4.
Joining Kapono are athletic forwards
T.J. Cummings and Andre Patterson,
both of whom can creating some major
offense. Guard Dijon Thompson pro-

vides versatility at the wing and
is averaging almost 14 points per
game.
"They have a lot of guys that
are good at point of attack," said
Montgomery. "They are a little
bit better when some freedom is
involved and the kids are al
lowed to take advantage of their
skills. That has been a bit of a
problem for us, because often
times they could have a player
that is a bit more athletic at a
given spot."
"They have a bunch of guys
that you just don't know if they
will explode on any given night,"
added Childress.
Stanford will most likely be
without the services of junior
forward Justin Davis for the du
ration of the weekend. Davis,
who leads the Pac-10 in re
bounding and double-doubles,
sprained the MCL in his left
knee during the second half of
the conference opener at Cali
fornia. He is listed as day-to-day
and is waiting to receive medical
clearance.
With Davis out, Stanford will
be forced to rely on redshirt
sophomore guard Nick Robin
son, who has stepped into a start
ing role. Robinson's knee has
been bothering him, and the
extra minutes have been putting
some strain on the forward.

Stanford will most likely be
without the services of junior
forward Justin Davis for the du

who leads the Pac-10 in re

sprained the MCL in his left
knee during the second half of
the conference opener at Cali

and is waiting to receive medical
clearance.
With Davis out, Stanford will
be forced to rely on redshirt
sophomore guard Nick Robin

Looking ahead to Saturday,
things don't get any easier for the

Maples.
Led by sophomore guard
Errick Craven's 22 points, the

Trojans upset Arizona State last

While Montgomery and his

"They are very quick and ath

changing defenses as well as in the
past, they are a team that can
change defenses. They are a good
basketball team."
"Home sweet home" rings the familiar
cliche. And after gutting out a tight over
time win at Washington State last Thurs
day, only to fall to an athletic Washington
squad in Seattle two days later, how could
the Stanford men's basketball team not be
excited to return to the comfortable con
fines of Maples Pavilion?

But for the Cardinal, coming home this
weekend is a bit bittersweet in nature. The
same court that aided the team in an
upset of then-No. 11 Xavier in November
and a 24-point romp of then-No. 10 Ore
gon earlier this month holds much more
of an uncertain aura when UCLA comes
to town tonight.
The Bruins are the only Pacific-10
Conference team that has been able to
beat the Cardinal at home in each of the
last three seasons, which, considering the
talent of recent Stanford lineups, has
been no easy task.
In 2000 and 2001, the unranked Bru
ins came in and dethroned Stanford of its
No. 1 ranking and assured themselves of
a spot in the NCAA tournament. In 2002,
UCLA, ranked No. 25, upset the No. 10
Cardinal, confirming the squad's notori
ous trend of coming on strong in the end
of the season.
However, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery doesn't want to set a prece
dent by losing to UCLA at home, and rec
ognizes that the Cardinal has a lot more
to concentrate on if it is to come out with
the win.
"That's not relevant," he said, refer
ring to his team's recent home record
against UCLA. "What's relevant is how we
play. If you are really resorting to tricks
and devices to get your team to play hard,
you have got a problem to begin with.
There shouldn't be any psychological bar
rier to us coming out and competing."

But even if history repeats itself, this
year the Bruins are going to need a lot
more than a successful trek through
Maples to find their way into any postsea
son tournament. Sitting with a disastrous
4-9 record, including a 1-7 mark at home,
UCLA is merely trying to retain a last
shred of respect.
However, while the Bruins are severe
ly lacking in the win department, individ
ually they are as tough as any team in the
Pac-10, a certainty that the Cardinal
hasn't overlooked.
"I think we are going to take this game
like any other," said sophomore forward

Josh Childress. "We realize that their
record may not show it, but they are still a
really good team. We have got to come
out and play hard."
Leading the team is senior forward
Jason Kapono, a bona fide shooter that
demonstrated what he was capable of in a
44-point performance against Washing
ton State on Jan. 4.
Joining Kapono are athletic forwards
T.J. Cummings and Andre Patterson,
both of whom can creating some major
