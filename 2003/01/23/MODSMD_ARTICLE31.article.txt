# Pressure on Calif, coaches
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery is
finding himself in a much different position
than last year. And this weekend, his Cardinal
men's basketball team faces a couple of squads
whose coaches have likewise had a lot of
changes to deal with.
Last year, Montgomery, Southern Califor
nia head coach Henry Bibby and UCLA head
coach Steve Lavin each led his respective team
to the NCAA tournament.
Hit hard by the loss of seniors and early de
partures to the NBA, however, all three coach
es find themselves in challenging situations
this year.
Bibby, whose Trojans finished 22-10 (12-6
Pacific-10 Conference) last year, is currently
leading a 7-6 (3-2 Pac-10) team, and he is try
ing to fit a smaller, less experienced group of
players into his complicated defensive
schemes. Bibby's squad suffered the loss of its
top three scorers, seniors Sam Clancy, Bran
don Granville and David Bluthenthal. Al
though his squad has played decently this year,
Bibby wishes he had more talent to work with.
"What we've got to do is try to keep the

Adams and the Shipps and the Wethers at
home," Bibby said. "We've got to do a better re
cruiting job and keep those guys at home."
California's Joe Shipp and Brian Wethers
and Arizona's Hassan Adams rank first, 11 th
and 18th in conference scoring with 21.4, 14.0
and 13.3 points per game, respectively. All
three hail from Los Angeles but went else
where in the Pac-10 to play.
Given the youth of his team — USC starts
four sophomores and a junior — Bibby has
witnessed some surprising and disappointing
moments this season, including a meltdown
against Washington earlier this month.
"That was a big loss for us, because we had a
21-point lead," Bibby said. "But we're a young
basketball team. You're going to win some
games you shouldn't win; you're going to lose
some games you shouldn't lose."
Bibby's Los Angeles counterpart Steve
Lavin is probably the most scrutinized college
basketball coach in the country. Having faced
questions about his job security for years,
Lavin's and his team's struggles this season
have intensified the firestorm. The talented
Bruins have stumbled to a 4-9 start (2-3 Pac-10)

after finishing 21-12 (11-7) last
year, a mark that included two
wins in the NCAA tournament.
"I think it's a great job, and I
came in with my eyes open in
terms of the challenges that a bas
ketball coach at UCLA has," Lavin
said. "Obviously every coach that
follows John Wooden under
stands that it's kind of a unique set
of expectations and challenges
that you're going to face on an an
nual basis any time your team
struggles."
Throughout his seven-year
head coaching stint at UCLA,
Lavin has walked the job security
tightrope but saved himself with
impressive late-season runs, which
consistently include surprising
performances in the Big Dance.
But exhibition losses to Branch
West and the EA Sports All-Stars
during the fall were followed by
losses to San Diego, Northern Ari
zona, Michigan and Saint John's
— all teams that UCLA was ex
pected to beat.
The expectations may have
been unreasonably high, given the
loss of Billy Knight, Matt Barnes
and Dan Gadzuric — seniors and
the Bruins' respective second,
third and fourth leading scorers
last year. Their departure seems to
have left the younger Bruins con
fused and disjointed.
"More than any one individual
player not playing well, it's the
collective level of play at both
ends [of the court] that has our
team struggling for answers,"
Lavin said. "When you struggle
and have a discouraging season
as we have to this point, you're
just looking for something to
build on in terms of positive mo
mentum, and we haven't been
able to generate that."
Montgomery, a friend of
Lavin's from the dozen years both
have spent coaching in the Pac-10,
believes that there is too much

pressure being put on the Bruins'
head coach.
"I think he's handled what's
been a very difficult situation,"
Montgomery said. "It can't be
much fun going to the office
every day, [but] Steve seems to
have a way to get things turned
around."
Montgomery, who surely
misses his would-be seniors, cur
rent NBA players Curtis Bor
chardt and Casey Jacobsen, has
also had to make do with a weak
ened roster, particularly in light
of injuries to Chris Llernandez
andjustin Davis.
"Our problems have been
chronicled in terms of people that
we don't have," Montgomery
said. "We only have nine scholar
ship kids and six freshmen and
sophomores. We can only ask so
much of these kids. They're not
supermen."
Though Stanford has a better
record than its Los Angeles coun
terparts (12-5, 3-2), Montgomery
resists any attempts to categorize
this weekend's games as must-win
contests, despite the struggles of
the L.os Angeles schools.
"The assumption that we're
better than everybody is a false as
sumption," Montgomery said.
"We have our hands full every
night. We don't have the luxury of
walking in and being superior to
people."
Like Bibby and Lavin, Mont
gomery doesn't sugarcoat his
team's situation.
"I don't know if we're going to
have a chance at the conference
championship, even though we
only have two losses," Mont
gomery said.
Fans at Maples Pavilion for this
weekend's games won't see con
tests between experienced teams
gearing up for the Pac-10 title, but
rather three veteran coaches fac
ing the unpleasant but perennial
task of developing young, inexpe
rienced players into proven, con
sistent winners.
"The key is [to] just keep getting
better every day," Bibby said.

Pacific-10 Conference) last year, is currently
leading a 7-6 (3-2 Pac-10) team, and he is try
ing to fit a smaller, less experienced group of
players into his complicated defensive
schemes. Bibby's squad suffered the loss of its
top three scorers, seniors Sam Clancy, Bran
don Granville and David Bluthenthal. Al
though his squad has played decently this year,
Bibby wishes he had more talent to work with.
"What we've got to do is try to keep the

Adams and the Shipps and the Wethers at
home," Bibby said. "We've got to do a better re
cruiting job and keep those guys at home."
California's Joe Shipp and Brian Wethers
and Arizona's Hassan Adams rank first, 11 th
and 18th in conference scoring with 21.4, 14.0
and 13.3 points per game, respectively. All
three hail from Los Angeles but went else
where in the Pac-10 to play.
Given the youth of his team — USC starts
four sophomores and a junior — Bibby has
witnessed some surprising and disappointing
moments this season, including a meltdown
against Washington earlier this month.
"That was a big loss for us, because we had a
21-point lead," Bibby said. "But we're a young
basketball team. You're going to win some
games you shouldn't win; you're going to lose
some games you shouldn't lose."
Bibby's Los Angeles counterpart Steve
Lavin is probably the most scrutinized college
basketball coach in the country. Having faced
questions about his job security for years,
Lavin's and his team's struggles this season
have intensified the firestorm. The talented
Bruins have stumbled to a 4-9 start (2-3 Pac-10)

after finishing 21-12 (11-7) last
year, a mark that included two
wins in the NCAA tournament.
"I think it's a great job, and I
came in with my eyes open in
terms of the challenges that a bas
ketball coach at UCLA has," Lavin
said. "Obviously every coach that
follows John Wooden under
stands that it's kind of a unique set
of expectations and challenges
that you're going to face on an an
nual basis any time your team
struggles."
Throughout his seven-year
head coaching stint at UCLA,
Lavin has walked the job security
tightrope but saved himself with
impressive late-season runs, which
consistently include surprising
performances in the Big Dance.
But exhibition losses to Branch
West and the EA Sports All-Stars
during the fall were followed by
losses to San Diego, Northern Ari
zona, Michigan and Saint John's
— all teams that UCLA was ex
pected to beat.
The expectations may have
been unreasonably high, given the
loss of Billy Knight, Matt Barnes
and Dan Gadzuric — seniors and
the Bruins' respective second,
third and fourth leading scorers
last year. Their departure seems to
have left the younger Bruins con
fused and disjointed.
"More than any one individual
player not playing well, it's the
collective level of play at both
ends [of the court] that has our
team struggling for answers,"
Lavin said. "When you struggle
and have a discouraging season
as we have to this point, you're
just looking for something to
build on in terms of positive mo
mentum, and we haven't been
able to generate that."
Montgomery, a friend of
Lavin's from the dozen years both
have spent coaching in the Pac-10,
believes that there is too much

pressure being put on the Bruins'
head coach.
"I think he's handled what's
been a very difficult situation,"
Montgomery said. "It can't be
much fun going to the office
every day, [but] Steve seems to
have a way to get things turned
around."
Montgomery, who surely
misses his would-be seniors, cur
rent NBA players Curtis Bor
chardt and Casey Jacobsen, has
also had to make do with a weak
ened roster, particularly in light
of injuries to Chris Llernandez
andjustin Davis.
"Our problems have been
chronicled in terms of people that
we don't have," Montgomery
said. "We only have nine scholar
ship kids and six freshmen and
sophomores. We can only ask so
much of these kids. They're not
supermen."
Though Stanford has a better
record than its Los Angeles coun
terparts (12-5, 3-2), Montgomery
resists any attempts to categorize
this weekend's games as must-win
contests, despite the struggles of
the L.os Angeles schools.
"The assumption that we're
better than everybody is a false as
sumption," Montgomery said.
"We have our hands full every
night. We don't have the luxury of
walking in and being superior to
people."
Like Bibby and Lavin, Mont
gomery doesn't sugarcoat his
team's situation.
"I don't know if we're going to
have a chance at the conference
championship, even though we
only have two losses," Mont
gomery said.
Fans at Maples Pavilion for this
weekend's games won't see con
tests between experienced teams
gearing up for the Pac-10 title, but
rather three veteran coaches fac
ing the unpleasant but perennial
task of developing young, inexpe
rienced players into proven, con
sistent winners.
"The key is [to] just keep getting
better every day," Bibby said.
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery is
finding himself in a much different position
than last year. And this weekend, his Cardinal
men's basketball team faces a couple of squads
whose coaches have likewise had a lot of
changes to deal with.
Last year, Montgomery, Southern Califor
nia head coach Henry Bibby and UCLA head
coach Steve Lavin each led his respective team
to the NCAA tournament.
Hit hard by the loss of seniors and early de
partures to the NBA, however, all three coach
es find themselves in challenging situations
this year.
Bibby, whose Trojans finished 22-10 (12-6
Pacific-10 Conference) last year, is currently
leading a 7-6 (3-2 Pac-10) team, and he is try
ing to fit a smaller, less experienced group of
players into his complicated defensive
