# Pressure on Calif, coaches
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery is
finding himself in a much different position
than last year. And this weekend, his Cardinal
men's basketball team faces a couple of squads
whose coaches have likewise had a lot of
changes to deal with.
Last year, Montgomery, Southern Califor
nia head coach Henry Bibby and UCLA head
coach Steve Lavin each led his respective team
to the NCAA tournament.
Hit hard by the loss of seniors and early de
partures to the NBA, however, all three coach
es find themselves in challenging situations
this year.
Bibby, whose Trojans finished 22-10 (12-6
Pacific-10 Conference) last year, is currently
leading a 7-6 (3-2 Pac-10) team, and he is try
ing to fit a smaller, less experienced group of
players into his complicated defensive
schemes. Bibby's squad suffered the loss of its
top three scorers, seniors Sam Clancy, Bran
don Granville and David Bluthenthal. Al
though his squad has played decently this year,
Bibby wishes he had more talent to work with.
"What we've got to do is try to keep the

Adams and the Shipps and the Wethers at
home," Bibby said. "We've got to do a better re
cruiting job and keep those guys at home."
California's Joe Shipp and Brian Wethers
and Arizona's Hassan Adams rank first, 11 th
and 18th in conference scoring with 21.4, 14.0
and 13.3 points per game, respectively. All
three hail from Los Angeles but went else
where in the Pac-10 to play.
Given the youth of his team — USC starts
four sophomores and a junior — Bibby has
witnessed some surprising and disappointing
moments this season, including a meltdown
against Washington earlier this month.
"That was a big loss for us, because we had a
21-point lead," Bibby said. "But we're a young
basketball team. You're going to win some
games you shouldn't win; you're going to lose
some games you shouldn't lose."
Bibby's Los Angeles counterpart Steve
Lavin is probably the most scrutinized college
basketball coach in the country. Having faced
questions about his job security for years,
Lavin's and his team's struggles this season
have intensified the firestorm. The talented
Bruins have stumbled to a 4-9 start (2-3 Pac-10)
