# Matt Lottich:
## The 						Cardinal's Straight Shooter 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a press conference earlier this
week, Stanford men's basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery spoke light
heartedly of superheros.
Montgomery said: "We can only ask
so much of these kids. They're not su
permen."
Tell that to then-No. 7 Florida, which
watched helplessly as junior shooting
guard Matt Lottich hit two clutch 3-
pointers from an elongated 3-point line
back in November.
Tell that to a Sixth Man Club that
watched Lottich score 13 points in three
minutes to help the Cardinal overcome
a 15-point second-half deficit to Oregon
State two weeks ago.
Tell that to a stunned Washington
State crowd that cringed when Lottich
led the Cardinal with 17 points as Stan
ford survived a tough overtime game in
Pullman last Thursday.
After two years of playing behind
Cardinal "alum" Casey Jacobsen, Lot
tich has finally gotten his chance in the
spodight.
Now, more than ever, the compar
isons between the two are irresistible —
a fearless shooter like Lottich in a post
Jacobsen-era can't help but receive a lit
tle extra scrutiny.
But for those who thought that there
would be no life after Jacobsen — no
last-second buzzer-beaters, no come
from-behind rallies, no more heroic ef
forts — Lottich is ready to prove them
wrong.
"I learned a lot playing behind Casey,
and I tried to gain all I could from him
while he was here," he said.
Despite being fairly consistent early
on, winter break saw Lottich go cold for
a three-game stretch during which he
only managed three points. His
mediocre shooting performances made
several of his coaches sit up and take no
tice. Soon they were breaking down
tapes of Lottich's shooting form.
"When I was struggling, the coaches
came in and showed me clips of games
where I'd shot the ball well and clips of

games where I hadn't," Lottich said.
"There were just some technique things
that had changed."
The video session worked wonders.
Just when the doubt about Lottich
had officially set in, he reappeared when
his team needed him the most.
In die last four Pacific-10 Conference
games, the 6-foot-4 guard has been
Stanford's leading scorer, averaging 17
points. And, with the exception of last
Saturday's loss to Washington, he's
managed to score the majority of his
points in the second half.
His performance two weeks ago
against unranked Oregon State is defi
nitely the reason for Lottich's newfound
popularity. With 12 minutes left to play
against the Beavers and Stanford down
by 15, Lottich led a 20-5 run to help the
Cardinal avoid an upset. In his career
high 23-point performance, Lottich,
who at one point in the waning minutes
of the game scored eight consecutive
points, brought life back to a stunned
Sixth Man Club and a seemingly passive
Stanford team.
Two days later, he followed up his ca
reer-high night with an impressive per
formance against then-No. 12 Oregon.
Still reveling in"the zone," Lottich
scored 15 points off 5-of-7 shooting from
behind the arc to aid his team's 24-point
rout over the Ducks.
"I'm definitely shooting with a lot
more confidence now," he said. "I think
that's a credit to my coaches and team
mates having faith in me even though I
struggled the first three games back
after winter break. They kept saying
positive things to me, kept telling me to
shoot, and eventually I broke out of that
slump."
It takes a certain kind of mentality
to be a shooting guard — to be able to
step onto that hardwood night after
night and be unafraid to take the last
shot, to risk personal disappointment
and constant external second-guess
ing in the name of glory and team and
victory.
It's so easy to get down on the shoot-
er when the shots just aren't falling.
"VVe have an expression here,
'Shooters shoot,'" Lottich said. "I
kinda take that expression to heart.
You have to keep shooting even if
you're missing. You can't let one bad
shot or one off-night affect you."
Furthermore, it takes a certain
kind of person to step into that roie
amidst outsider speculation that,
not only would Jacobsen have
done it better, but that the once
probable combo of injured sopho
more point guard Chris Hernan
dez and senior Julius Barnes at the
two-spot would have been a much
more attractive option for this
young Stanford program.
In all honesty, Lottich's recent
success might be the result of good
timing and patience on his part.
It couldn't have been easy fora
former high school tri-athlete (he
was also a standout in both football
and baseball) to come into a pro
gram and be relegated to endure
the unenviable label as a "strong
practice player."
To his credit, however, he's fig
ured out a way to overcome all of
that — the bad shooting days, the
outside speculators and the frustra
tions of years past. He's taken Sixth
Man Club standing ovations and
his coaches' decision to stick with
him despite a spell of lackluster
shooting nights, and translated
them into consistent, borderline

heroic performances.
And on a team of no "stars" and
in a pavilion of lowered expecta
tions, Lottich and his teammates are
proving again and again that the

aforementioned scenario isn't the
whole truth. That being underesti
mated can give you an unquantifi
able strength. That even "kids" can
be supermen sometimes.
