specific poll you were looking at.
But there is a reason why they play
the games.
Still reeling from one of the toughest
nonconference schedules in the nation,
the Women of Troy own a mediocre 7-
11 record (2-5 Pac-10) while their
crosstown rivals in Westwood are sec
ond in the Pac-10 with a 6-1 conference
mark and an 11-5 overall record.
Both teams will face their biggest
tests of the year against No. 5 Stanford
(14-1, 6-0 Pac-10), which visits Pauley
Pavilion tomorrow night before jaunt
ing across town on Sunday to take on
the Trojans.
The first meeting between the two
Los Angeles teams was indicative of
their respective seasons thus far. After
battling back from a second-half deficit,
USC committed a careless foul on the
Bruins' Michelle Greco as she forced
up a heave with the shot clock winding
down. UCLA took the gift and ran,
scoring 12 of the game's final 19 points
to take a 72-64 victory.
Boosted by Pac-10 leading scorer
Greco — who sat out last season due to
recurring concussions — and a group
of talented freshmen, the Bruins (11-5)
have already won more games this year
that they did all of last season. The
freshmen, led by high school first-team
Ail-American Nikki Blue, account for
43 percent of UCLA's offense.

its record suggests, UCLA's record

ence schedule. Despite its vastly su
perior overall record, the Bruins
rank behind the Women of Troy
in the RPI rankings. UCLA has not
beaten a top-25 team all season.
In the end though, winning
games is what matters, and the
Bruins have taken care of business
in the Pac-10, defeating the Ore
gon and Washington schools, USC
and Arizona State and having lost
only to Arizona.
Tomorrow's game against Stan
ford will be a measuring stick for
UCLA, and the Bruins seem more
concerned about the Cardinal
than the other way around.
"We have a lot of issues playing
Stanford," said UCLA head coach
Kathy Olivier. "They're just very
talented. There is a reason they are
in the top five in the country. They
have so many good outside shoot
ers and so many weapons. You
stop one player, and the other
players are going to score.
"They have a boatload of play
ers that can shoot the ball well, so
that kind of scares me."
Stanford has the luxury of fo
cusing on what it needs to do
rather than on what the opponent
might do.
"We do what we do," said Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
don't look at opponents and say we
have to play this way for them. We
play our way, and it works pretty

well.
Turnovers and rebounds will
be key in tomorrow's matchup at
Pauley. The Bruins lead the Pac
-10 in steals (12.62 per game),
and turnover margin (plus-6.19
per game), having forced 100
more turnovers than they have
committed.
But UCLA has struggled re
bounding the ball especially after
losing its leading rebounder Julia
Pitts to a season-ending ACL in
jury. The Bruins were outre
bounded by 20 against Arizona
State and by 10 against Arizona
last week.
Stanford, meanwhile, has been
turnover-prone recently.
"I think a lot of our turnovers
have been related to lack of con
centration," VanDerveer said.
"Against a team that is very ag
gressive, if we were not playing
sharp, then we could have prob
lems with it."
Acknowledging that the
NCAA tournament selection
committee emphasizes strength
of schedule, USC put together
one of the toughest nonconfer
ence schedules in the nation.
However, it doesn't help to play
against top teams if you can't
compete with them.
The Women of Troy lost con
vincingly to three top-10 teams —
Connecticut, Tennessee, Kansas
State — and one top-25 team,
Notre Dame.
Rather than toughen up the
team as was hoped, the rough
schedule seems to have eroded

USC's confidence, especially down
the stretch of close games.
In the Pac-10, the Women of
Troy have already lost to Oregon
State by two points, Oregon by six,
Washington by two in overtime
and No. 22 Arizona by three.
The sad fact is that the Women
of Troy are not nearly as bad as
their record would suggest — on
average they are being outscored
by 2.9 points per game, a tiny
deficit given a tough schedule.
Talent is not the problem as
four of USC's starters average
double figures in points, led by All-
America candidate Ebony Hoff
man, who boasts 15.8 points per
game. The Trojans just find ways
to lose close games.
Head coach Chris Gobrecht
hopes that a recent 58-53 come
from-behind win over Arizona
State will raise her team's confi
dence level. USC took its first lead
since the early minutes of that
game with an Hoffman jumper in
the last minute.
"It was nice to come back from
so far down and realize that we
had that kind of fight in us," Gob
recht said. "[Now] we understand
that we thought we are working
hard, but we were not. They have
made a commitment there."
Unless USC finds its lost killer
instinct fast, it won't have much of a
chance against a Stanford team
that specializes in mental tough
ness and smart play. The Cardinal
has not lost a close game all season
and has come back from second
half deficits seven times this season.

Unless USC finds its lost killer

Still reeling from one of the toughest
nonconference schedules in the nation,
the Women of Troy own a mediocre 7-

crosstown rivals in Westwood are sec

Both teams will face their biggest

The first meeting between the two

ence schedule. Despite its vastly su
perior overall record, the Bruins
rank behind the Women of Troy
in the RPI rankings. UCLA has not
beaten a top-25 team all season.
In the end though, winning
games is what matters, and the
Bruins have taken care of business
in the Pac-10, defeating the Ore
gon and Washington schools, USC
and Arizona State and having lost
only to Arizona.
Tomorrow's game against Stan
ford will be a measuring stick for
UCLA, and the Bruins seem more
concerned about the Cardinal
than the other way around.
"We have a lot of issues playing
Stanford," said UCLA head coach
Kathy Olivier. "They're just very
talented. There is a reason they are
in the top five in the country. They
have so many good outside shoot
ers and so many weapons. You
stop one player, and the other
players are going to score.
"They have a boatload of play
ers that can shoot the ball well, so
that kind of scares me."
Stanford has the luxury of fo
cusing on what it needs to do
rather than on what the opponent
might do.
"We do what we do," said Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
don't look at opponents and say we
have to play this way for them. We
play our way, and it works pretty

well.
Turnovers and rebounds will
be key in tomorrow's matchup at
Pauley. The Bruins lead the Pac
-10 in steals (12.62 per game),
and turnover margin (plus-6.19
per game), having forced 100
more turnovers than they have
committed.
But UCLA has struggled re
bounding the ball especially after
losing its leading rebounder Julia
Pitts to a season-ending ACL in
jury. The Bruins were outre
bounded by 20 against Arizona
State and by 10 against Arizona
last week.
Stanford, meanwhile, has been
turnover-prone recently.
"I think a lot of our turnovers
have been related to lack of con
centration," VanDerveer said.
"Against a team that is very ag
gressive, if we were not playing
sharp, then we could have prob
lems with it."
Acknowledging that the
NCAA tournament selection
committee emphasizes strength
of schedule, USC put together
one of the toughest nonconfer
ence schedules in the nation.
However, it doesn't help to play
against top teams if you can't
compete with them.
The Women of Troy lost con
vincingly to three top-10 teams —
Connecticut, Tennessee, Kansas
State — and one top-25 team,
Notre Dame.
Rather than toughen up the
team as was hoped, the rough
schedule seems to have eroded

USC's confidence, especially down
the stretch of close games.
In the Pac-10, the Women of
Troy have already lost to Oregon
State by two points, Oregon by six,
Washington by two in overtime
and No. 22 Arizona by three.
The sad fact is that the Women
of Troy are not nearly as bad as
their record would suggest — on
average they are being outscored
by 2.9 points per game, a tiny
deficit given a tough schedule.
Talent is not the problem as
four of USC's starters average
double figures in points, led by All-
America candidate Ebony Hoff
man, who boasts 15.8 points per
game. The Trojans just find ways
to lose close games.
Head coach Chris Gobrecht
hopes that a recent 58-53 come
from-behind win over Arizona
State will raise her team's confi
dence level. USC took its first lead
since the early minutes of that
game with an Hoffman jumper in
the last minute.
