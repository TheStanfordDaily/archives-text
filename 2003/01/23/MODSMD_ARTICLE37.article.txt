# Back from injury, King unstoppable

In street clothes, 5-foot-7
sophomore point guard Susan
King looks like an average Stan
ford undergraduate.
On the basketball court, she
looks like a scrapping, clawing blur
of energy.
What she lacks in height and
girth, she makes up in blinding
speed and competitive fire.
Because after two years of in
jury, every moment on the floor is
precious.
"I just want to get through
practice today. I want to be excit
ed that I am out there and not
look into the future because I have
had it taken away so quickly,"
King says.
Basketball flows through
King's veins — her father played
college ball at Nebraska-Kearny
and her brother is a freshman bas
ketball player at Ohio. Her fianc6,
former Stanford star Curtis Bor
chardt, plays in the NBA for the
Utah Jazz.
King honed her ball-handling,
shooting and competitive edge in
intense battles in her family's dri
veway. And when injury took bas
ketball away for two years, Bor
chardt was the one who encour
aged her through rehab.
"[My family] has played a huge
role in my basketball career," King
said. "I started going to the gym

with my dad when I was little, and
I can't tell you how much time I
spent on the driveway with my
brothers playing one-on-one."
King came to Stanford in the
same recruiting class as All-Amer
ica candidate Nicole Powell — a
class that was ranked fifth nation
ally that year.
The highly touted recruit could
do it all. As a senior she averaged
an incredible 35 points per game
in addition to being named Min
nesota's defensive player of the
year. That award was just one of
several she received on the state
and national level her last two
years of high school.
"I think the fact that she has
been named defensive player of
the year twice sums up the type of
player Susan is," King's high
school coach Danny Wood said at

the time. "She can do anything she
wants on the basketball court."
Prodigious talent aside, King's
most valuable contribution to a
team is her passion for basketball.
Words like "competitive" and "in
tense" always seem to slip into
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's description of King.
"Susan is very athletic, very
quick and extremely competitive.
She can pass, shoot and use her
quickness to take people to the
basket," VanDerveer said during
King's first year on the Farm.
"She is crazy about the game of
basketball and has a great work
ethic."
In high school King was known
as a gym rat, spending hours
alone shooting jumpers.
This desire to learn and com
pete allowed her to bypass the

usual freshman growing pains
and start immediately at point
guard for the Cardinal.
As a freshman, she averaged
11.3 points, 5.1 assists and 3.0 re
bounds in a team-high 33.1 min
utes in Stanford's first nine games.
In just her a sixth collegiate game,
King broke onto the national
scene by scoring 21 points in Stan
ford's near upset of then-No. 2
Tennessee.
After the game, Tennessee
head coach Pat Summit gushed,
"Susan King was everything and
more than we had heard that she
was. Nothing really affected
her."
A day later, King was named
Pac-10 Player of the Week, and
the nation was talking about the 1-
