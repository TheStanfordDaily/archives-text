# Controversy brews in PA City Council
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Political turmoil has engulfed Palo
Alto City Council meetings in recent
months, leaving residents concerned
and government officials divided.
In a move that many critics have
deemed inappropriate, Palo Alto City
Councilwoman Nancy Lytle publicly de
clared what she believed were the short
comings of the leading candidates for
mayor and vice mayor during a city re
organization meeting on Jan. 13.
Later that evening, the two candidates
who were criticized were unanimously
elected to their respective positions.
According to the Palo Alto city char
ter, the incoming mayor and vice mayor
are each selected by a majority vote. The
mayor is only allotted limited powers,
such as the ability to make appointments
to committees and the responsibility to
preside over council meetings.
In a written response released on Jan.
15 addressing those who have argued
that the meeting is intended to be large
ly ceremonial, Lyde emphasized that

candidates should not simply be promot
ed to mayor by default.
"Legally, the reorganization meeting
of the city council is an election," Lytle
said. "The meeting itself and the election
was perfunctory, and the families were
all present as though the decision was
made behind the scenes and ahead of
time, which would be illegal."
"I am sorry that you feel strongly that
my timing was wrong," she continued.
"But an election is the proper time in
democracy for raising the conduct and
record of the candidate and evaluating it
openly, honestly and critically. Criticism
has to be public in an election."
Newly elected Mayor Dena Mossar
refused to comment on what occurred
during the election, stating only that
"the issues involved are not so much
about the ceremony and the way that
we proceed."
This incident is not the first time that
Lytle has found herself at the center of
political controversy. I n a memo written
last November by Councilman Jack Mor
ton, Lytle and two other council mem
bers were accused of violating the Brown

Act â€” a law requiring that most meet
ings in which city matters are decided
have to be open to the public.
"The Morton memo and the man
ner in which it has been glorified in the
local press and praised by our leader
ship is cause for great alarm," Lytle
said. "A need for reform and training
on our city council and in our commu
nity is apparent."
According to The Mercury Times,
Lytle and her fellow council members
were later cleared of the charges levied
against them in the memo after Michael
Jenkins, an attorney appointed to inves
tigate the allegations, found that the
three members had done nothing in vio
lation of any laws.
"I find the progression of events
rather interesting," said sophomore
Timnit Gebru. "It seems strange that
Lytle was first accused of holding secret
meetings and not allowing for enough
transparency within city government,
but then she was later reprimanded for
making her concerns too public."

Lyde, while explaining her dif
ference in opinion, has main
tained that her actions were by no
means unsuitable for the occasion.
"You feel that I should have
stayed silent, but democracy
works differendy," Lytle said. "En
forcing ethics requires speaking
up. Our leadership must be ac
countable for high standards."
