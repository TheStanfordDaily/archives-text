# Computers in the classroom
## Take a Byte out of learning 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Will Stanford classes 10 years from now
be full of students with laptops in hand
swiftly typing notes or following class ma
terial along with their professor? They
may if the University continues to follow
the nationwide trend of incorporating
technology into the classroom.
Already, several Program in Writing
and Rhetoric classes have used the
Meyer Flex lab in Meyer Library and
classrooms in Wallenberg Hall to exper
iment with integrating computers into
the class curriculum.
Lecturer Marvina White, who taught
the PWR class American Sea Writing in

one of the classrooms last year, found the
software and plasma screens in Meyer
Flex very helpful for revision and presen
tations. She said that her students especial
ly enjoyed using them for group work.
Even so, White was a little wary of the
technology and questions whether the
high-tech equipment really facilitates
learning.
"The students were excited about
being in that room," White said. "They
wanted to play with the stuff. It was the
novelty and the dazzle of the technology
that they seemed to be attracted to, but I'm
not sure how much it enhances the actual
learning."
Some students, however, said that they
felt the technology made a difference in

their education. Freshman Laura Surma's
PWR class, Rhetorics of Journalism, uses
computers roughly half the time to refer to
instruction material, research topics and
work on peer editing.
"PWR is an ideal class for die use of
technology because it is a smaller-scale
class and it allows all of us to look at and dis
cuss die same document at once without
wasting excessive amounts of paper," she
said.
Kevin Heatheringon is a sophomore
who took Electric Rhetoric last winter
quarter. He said he enjoyed using the
wireless laptops available in the Meyer
Flex classroom. Heatherington also
noted he appreciated looking at
different Web sites as part of class
discussions, and added that he
liked being able to take notes on
the computer and e-mail them to
himself during class.
Nevertheless, he noted, "It was
convenient, but that doesn't neces
sarily make it better."
And computer-based classes are
certainly not always convenient, es
pecially when technology glitches
interfere. White, for instance, gave
up using the laptops in class due to
logistical problems and die time
wasted in working out the kinks.
"The effort and frustration was
too much and it wasn't worth it for
me," she said. She noted, however,
"A lot of my colleagues have worked
through these things."
Heatherington, for example,

couldn't recall any major problems
widi the technology in his class. His
course was co-taught by a technolo
gy specialist who was able to help re
solve any issues that might have
come up. And while Surma's class
has had fewer problems than
White's, she said it could still ham
per the flow of the class.
"It is somewhat of a nuisance
when the class is significantly de
layed by such problems as laptops
that shut down when they are not
in constant use and plasma
screens that do not always cooper
ate," she said.
White explained, "Teachers
need to create class plans that
take into account the difficulties
as well as advantages of using this
technology: Always have a back
up plan and make adjustments to
the syllabus."
She thinks that curriculum for
computer-intensive classes needs to
be developed with the technology in
mind, and that teachers should be

given a good amount of time and
training on how to incorporate
these resources into their classes.
"It's not the sort of thing that
works well by the seat of your pants,"
she said.
Asked what she would change,
White responded, "I would have
structured activities to eliminate dis
cipline issues."
White was not alone in noticing
diat students often get distracted by
the computers in front of them,
straying from class material.
Heatherington noted, "There
were definitely people playing
solitaire."
Surma explained, "With com
puters present, there's always the
desire to check your e-mail or surf
the Web rather than pay attention to
class.
"However, I think that students
here are responsible for their own
learning, so if they choose not to pay
attention, that's their own decision.
If a large portion of the class is dis

tracted by e-mail and the Web and
therefore disengaged in the pro
ceedings of the class, it's probably an
indication of poor teaching rather
than poor students."
Still, White said she found that
the added distraction from the
computers was not outweighed by
the benefits of the technology in
the class. She prefers the more di
rect personal contact that she sees
as less likely with the introduction
of laptops.
"A level of intimacy comes best
when you sit around a seminar
table looking at each others'
faces," she said. "The technology
was intrusive."
And while Surma is enjoying her
experience with technology in
PWR, she has reservations about
widespread computer-based cur
riculum.
She noted, "I would not recom
mend integrating computers into all
classes. Sometimes they just compli
cate things."
