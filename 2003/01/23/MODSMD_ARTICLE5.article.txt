# Computers in the classroom
## Take a Byte out of learning 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Will Stanford classes 10 years from now
be full of students with laptops in hand
swiftly typing notes or following class ma
terial along with their professor? They
may if the University continues to follow
the nationwide trend of incorporating
technology into the classroom.
Already, several Program in Writing
and Rhetoric classes have used the
Meyer Flex lab in Meyer Library and
classrooms in Wallenberg Hall to exper
iment with integrating computers into
the class curriculum.
Lecturer Marvina White, who taught
the PWR class American Sea Writing in

one of the classrooms last year, found the
software and plasma screens in Meyer
Flex very helpful for revision and presen
tations. She said that her students especial
ly enjoyed using them for group work.
Even so, White was a little wary of the
technology and questions whether the
high-tech equipment really facilitates
learning.
"The students were excited about
being in that room," White said. "They
wanted to play with the stuff. It was the
novelty and the dazzle of the technology
that they seemed to be attracted to, but I'm
not sure how much it enhances the actual
learning."
Some students, however, said that they
felt the technology made a difference in

their education. Freshman Laura Surma's
PWR class, Rhetorics of Journalism, uses
computers roughly half the time to refer to
instruction material, research topics and
work on peer editing.
"PWR is an ideal class for die use of
technology because it is a smaller-scale
class and it allows all of us to look at and dis
cuss die same document at once without
wasting excessive amounts of paper," she
said.

who took Electric Rhetoric last winter
quarter. He said he enjoyed using the
wireless laptops available in the Meyer
Flex classroom. Heatherington also
