# Trees to be planted on El Camino Real
## Four years ago, a new proposal was grounded; now it will take root 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
El Camino Real will soon look a bit more like
Palm Drive.
A recent decision to plant large trees in the
median of El Camino Real has finally been ap
proved by the California Department of
Transportation after a four-year push for ac
tion by its decision-makers.
Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) re
ceived the necessary approval earlier this

month from Caltrans to take the first step to
beautify the Peninsula's main commercial thor
oughfare.
"I can't believe it'd take four years to give
someone permission to plant a tree," Simitian
said. "I approached Director of [Caltrans] Jeff
Morales, who authorized a pilot project, there
by alleviating most of the concern regarding
the decision to plant trees."
According to Simitian, the cities of Palo
Alto, Menlo Park and Redwood City have
tried unsuccessfully for years to get their pro
posal approved by Caltrans and approached
Simitian early last year.
Caltrans commissioned a study and want
ed to manipulate the data some more, then
get back to these cities in late 2003.
Some students have questioned the ne

cessity of trees in a time of economic reces
sion.
"Trees are nice, but it'd be better if they used
money on something that helps the underpriv
ileged," said senior Donny Yoo. "Planting trees
would be good for areas that aren't in a reces
sion, unlike Silicon Valley."
Simitian pointed out that the cities "made
the decision [to fund the tree projects] them
selves," and added that Menlo Park has con
sidered slowing down work on the project for
now, until the economy picks up.
He noted that beautifying El Camino Real
could attract more business.
"I think you need to view it as not just an aes
thetic, or even an environmental improve
ment, but also as an economic improvement,"
Simitian said.
