Senior Robert Fernandez, Latina's bachelor
Senior Robert Fernandez is one of the nation's top 12 Latino bache
lors, according to the February issue of Latina magazine. A political sci
ence and Spanish major, Fernandez is featured on the list along with
soap actor Eduardo Verastegui and Food Network television presenter
Aaron Sanchez.
"Every year, Latina magazine scours the land for some of the most
available single Latino men around," said Latina's Contributing Editor
Carolina Miranda. "And while looks certainly count for part of what we
evaluate, we're basically looking for guys with heart — smart men, doing
interesting things or working in interesting professions. Robert, for us,
represented that. He's young, good-looking, well-grounded, and he's at
tending one of the nation's top universities."
According to Miranda, the bachelors on this list enjoy the attention
they receive.
"(The men] get lots of attention for being on our list — in their offices
and in their communities. Most boys really dig that attention," she said.

uate level looking fora temporary or permanent job.
"We usually attract companies from the Fortune 50 down to star

unique characteristic of this fair is that the event is planned and pro
duced by volunteers from four technical societies: SWE, SBSE, AISES
and SSCLES."

Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Conference to discuss culture as scientific concept
From Jan. 24-25, several eminent scholars will speak about culture as
an influence on behavior in the "Toward A Scientific Concept of Cul
ture" conference.
"Everybody talks about 'culture' these days — e.g., grad student
culture . . . corporate culture in general and of specific businesses,
and of course French culture or Chinese culture," said Assistant Prof.
Of Anthropological Sciences Melissa Brown,.who organized the con
ference. "In doing so, there is an assumption that 'culture' somehow
explains or justifies the actions of people in these different social cat
egories — e.g., corporate culture explaining Enron and other simi
lar fiascoes.
"However, it is not really clear what people mean by culture — if we
say that culture is what people do and what people do is their culture,
then we have not explained anything really. People at this conference
are trying to get beyond that tautology."
The conference will take place in the Bechtel Conference Room in
Encina Hall.
