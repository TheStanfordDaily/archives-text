## Both sides hold rallies on abortion rights 
### 
WASH INGTON (AP) — Opponents and support
ers of abortion rights rallied at the nation's symbols of
freedom yesterday, energized on both sides by Re
publican hopes of curbing the procedure 30 years
after the Supreme Court legalized it.
Dueling protests are a ritual in the nation's capital
on the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.
But both sides said there was greater urgency this
year with the GOP now controlling Congress and the
White House.
Abortion opponents see their best chance in years
to erode if not overturn Roe.
Abortion rights advocates acknowledged that their
opponents have reason to cheer this year.
"President Bush is just itching to put forward anti
choice legislation," said Polly Stamatopoulos, 32, of
Washington, D.C., outside the Supreme Court. She
and about 20 other abortion rights advocates found
themselves outnumbered by roughly 50 women car
rying signs that said, "I regret my abortion."
Earlier, Kim Gandy, president of the National Or
ganization for Women, said, "We will not be the gen
eration that both won and lost reproductive rights in

our lifetime."
The flash point comes as abortions become less
common in the United States — particularly among
teenagers — in part because of better contracep
tion. The overall abortion rate fell from 1994 to
2000, from 24 abortions for every 1,000 women of
childbearing age to 21, according to the Alan

Guttmacher Institute, which was begun by Planned
Parenthood but now is an independent nonprofit
corporation.
As is traditional, Bush broadcast a message to
the anti-abortion rights rally, saying Americans
"must protect the lives of innocent children waiting
to be born."
