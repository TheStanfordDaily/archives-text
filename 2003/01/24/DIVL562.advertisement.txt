Bookstore
Art Alcove
What did Kazimir Malevich
(1878 - 1935), the proponent of
pure abstraction in painting,
have to do with film, that
mechanical repository of every
thing that is banal and worth
less? It was only in 1924 that
Malevich described film as a sys
tem that fixed reality beyond
the cultural idea. Nonetheless,
between 1925 and 1929, he
wrote several articles on film as
well as a script.
