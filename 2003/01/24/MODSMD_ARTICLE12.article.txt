KASA Culture Night commemorates centennial
Tonight, the Korean American Student Association will be holding its
Culture Night, a celebration of the centennial anniversary of Koreans in
the United States. The theme of KASA Culture Night will be "Stepping
Up, Speaking Out."
"We're addressing the centrality of political empowerment in the Ko
rean-American community through our event, which I believe is impor
tant for all Asian-American communities to address since it's a topic that
isn't necessarily thought of as being central to our identities," said KASA
Culture Chair Sarah Ihn, ajunior. "But a closer look finds that Korean-
Americans have always been politically active and aware, ever since (he first
major wave of Korean immigration in 1903, and this part of our culture
should be celebrated as much as any part of Korean-American culture.
"We have amazing speakers lined up, including Judge Tammy Ryu,
the first Korean-American judge in California, and Ishle Park, a spoken
word artist and community activist. These women are on the cutting
edge .. . They're essentially Korean American pioneers, and its great to
be able to interact and listen to people who are changing the face of Ko
rean-American culture today."
KASA will provide free Korean food at 8 p.m. and will start the show,
which will include performances by Stanford Hwimori and Stanford
Taekwondo, at 8:30 p.m. in Manzanita Dining Hall.
Figure Skating Club hosts Stanford Invitational
On Jan. 25 and 26, the Stanford Collegiate Figure Skating Club will
be hosting its first Stanford Invitational.
"The Stanford Invitational is a qualifying competition Stanford will be
hosting for the Pacific Coast colleges, like UC-Davis, Santa Clara, San
Jose State and CalTech," said Events Coordinator junior Connie Chen.
"The colleges that perform in the top three in two qualifying competi
tions will move onto the National Intercollegiate Competition at Denver
State University. Our officers, President Jenny Chen, Financial Manag
er Jackie Wong and myself. . . have been working very hard to put this
together."
Chen said that the club hopes to use the competition to make figure
skating a visible sport on campus and is hoping to promote figure skat
ing on the Pacific Coast among high school students.
The figure skating club invites the Stanford community to support it
this Saturday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Yerba Buena Ice Skat
ing and Bowling Center in San Francisco.
Saturday shuttle transports students from San
Francisco to campus
The ASSU, in conjunction with Parking and Transportation, the Of
fice of Student Activities and the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, has re
cently launched a new late-night shuttling program from San Francisco
to campus. The shuttle, which is free for students, picks up as many as 30
students at 1:30 a.m. at Stockton and Columbus streets and at 1:45 a.m.
at 4th and Mission. Students must present their SUIDs to utilize this ser
vice.
"It only takes students from S.F. back to campus, but it is a prototype,"
Communications Director Joey Natoli said. "If there appears to be
enough interest in a shuttle to the city, the ASSU would definitely con
sider sponsoring it."
According to Natoli, the shuttle will continue throughout the quarter,
during which time its successfulness will be assessed.
