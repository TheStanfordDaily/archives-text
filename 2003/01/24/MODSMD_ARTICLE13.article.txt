## Iraqi scientists refuse interviews 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraqi scientists
are refusing private interviews with U.N. in
spectors despite t lie strong urgings of the
Iraqi government, a senior Iraqi official said
yesterday.
But Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wol
fowitz said yesterday that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein had threatened coopera
tive scientists with death. Chief U.N.
weapons inspector Hans Blix, meanwhile,
complained Iraq was still not complying fully
with U.N. demands.
"Today we know from multiple sources
that Saddam has ordered that any scientist
who cooperates during interviews will be
killed, as well as their families," Wolfowitz
said in New York.
Despite the scientists' balking at inter
views, Lt. Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin
said Baghdad hopes the chief U.N. inspec
tors will submit a progress report to the Se
curity Council that falls short of declaring
Iraq in material breach of the latest U.N. dis
armament resolution.
The report, due Monday, will assess
Iraq's level of cooperation with the U.N. in
spection program and will be crucial in de
termining whether the United States and

Britain launch military operations against
Saddam's government.
During a news conference, Amin said
top inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed
Elßaradei, head of the U.N. nuclear
agency, had "exaggerated" differences be
tween them and the Iraqi government
after talks in the Iraqi capital on Sunday
and Monday.
Amin noted that Blix said after Mon
day's talks that outstanding issues included
Iraq's refusal to allow reconnaissance over
nights by American U-2 spy planes to help
the U.N. inspectors' hunt for banned
weapons programs.
"He accused us of putting unnecessary
conditions and so forth, which is inaccurate,"
said Amin, the chief liaison with the U.N.
weapons monitors.
Amin said Iraq was simply seeking
"safeguards" that would "secure our
right to defend our sky and our ground."
He noted that U.S. and British jets still
patrol no-fly zones over Iraq — which
Baghdad maintains are illegal — and that
the presence of American spy planes in
Iraqi skies would "complicate the air de
fense project."
