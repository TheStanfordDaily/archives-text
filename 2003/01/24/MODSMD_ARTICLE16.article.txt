## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford should mobilize against war in Iraq 
### 
Published Since 1891

Last week, members of the Stanford
community voiced their opposition
to the Bush administration's prepa
rations fora war in Iraq in two sep
arate protests — an on-campus rally of
around 400 participants and a march in San
Francisco of over 100,000 people, according
to the latest police estimate.
As a war with Iraq becomes imminent, we
urge the Stanford community to oppose any
preemptive U.S.-led strike on Iraq without di
rect consent from the United Nations. While
we understand the threat Saddam Hussein
might pose if he has the capability to deploy
weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. govern
ment should allow the U.N. weapons inspec
tors to fully complete their job before consid
ering military action. Furthermore, any attack
on Iraq, especially initiated primarily by the
United States, will undoubtedly have many se
rious repercussions.
I he Stanford community should mobilize

to prevent the costly war that President Bush
has been advocating. The faculty senates and
student governments at universities across
the country have passed resolutions against a
potential war in Iraq, and Stanford's Faculty
Senate and ASSU should do the same. While
the ASSU has a constitutional amendment
barring it from passing bills on issues "not di
rectly affecting student life" — enacted in re
sponse to an ASSU resolution in 1990 oppos
ing the Persian Gulf War — CIA experts have
noted that a war with Iraq would increase the
threat of terrorism in the United States,
which would affect the lives of everyone in the
Stanford community.
Students can express their opposition to
the war in other ways as well, from attending
rallies, contacting their congressmen, or even
just by informing others of the severe conse
quences of the war. The gravity of this issue
has already reached beyond the typical "ac
tivist" communities, as members of the right,

left and center have united against a military
strike. Anti-war students from all walks of life
should also join together to let their voices be
heard. While some students might not agree
with what every speaker says at an anti-war
rally, just by attending the rally, they are
showing their commitment to peace and in
ternational cooperation with regard to the
Iraq crisis.
Some pro-war supporters label their oppo
nents as "anti-American," but Stanford stu
dents should remember that real patriots re
spect other nations' leaders, promote peace,
have a high civic consciousness, treat their fel
low citizens with honor and defend the United
States against anti-democratic processes. Dis
sent is as American as apple pie.
Instead of blindly following the U.S. gov
ernment, Stanford students should use on
campus resources — teach-ins, classes, guest
lectures, etc. — to explore the reasons be
hind Bush's push for war, and why Americans

should oppose it. Questions that the Stanford
community should ask include: Does the
United States' dependence on foreign oil
serve its interests? How many civilians are
likely to be killed in a military strike on Iraq?
If the United States succeeds in ousting Hus
sein, who will replace him if there is no strong
opposition force? Won't a war create more in
stability in the Middle East, an already volatile
region? Didn't the CIA say that the likelihood
of Hussein using weapons of mass destruction
would increase if Iraq were invaded?
College campuses have always been at the
forefront of activism during critical times in
U.S. and world history. Students at Stanford
and other universities around the country
played important roles in protesting the Viet
nam War and urging the U.S. government to
pressure South Africa to end its apartheid poli
cies. It's time once again to stand together
against the destructive path that Bush is
preparing to lead us down.
