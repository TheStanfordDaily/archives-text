# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## My hair, my self 
### 
Over the years, my hairstyles
have fluctuated in serious
ways, from the time the hair
dresser butchered me to with
in an inch of my scalp, literally, to the
braids I wore that really did extend all the
way down my back, gently fringing the
top of my bottom. At the moment, I'm
growing it out from the super-short natu
rally curly way I wore it about a year and
a half ago, a style that I loved but soon got
bored of. So right now it's somewhere in
between my neck and my shoulders.
Over winter break a friend of mine was
coming to see me, and he makes no bones
about the fact that he prefers women with
long hair, so I thought it would be cute if I
played a little trick on him and told him
over the phone that I had chopped mine

off. Of course he was
highly unimpressed and
proceeded to explain to
me that this unilateral de
cision of mine was not
only unfair to all of male
kind, but also to myself,
since I was taking away
my hair's chance to know
what it felt like to be long.

Now, every culture and every individ
ual has their preferences, and I don't
wish to begrudge them, but it seems that
the general consensus is that to epito
mize feminine charm is to have long,
flowing hair.
Case in point: A friend of mine gets
voted homecoming queen at her high
school and is widely hailed (with good rea
son) as a gorgeous, beautiful woman.
Then she cuts off her straightened, shoul
der-length hair and wears it as a very short
afro, and an older woman actually has the
audacity to tell her she doesn't even con
sider her pretty anymore.
And I'm like, hello, we're talking about
the same person here. How could she go
from gorgeous to not even pretty in just a
few snips? She tells me that there are even
more ways in which she feels that she is
being treated differently, mostly worse,
and that really upsets me because I don't
understand how people can really be that
shallow, and for what reason we have
bought so strongly into this notion of
beauty, which quite frankly is not even at
tainable for everyone.
Nonetheless, we are preoccupied with
living up to the standard of what it means
to be attractive, to the point where we will
inconvenience ourselves in ridiculous
ways to attain attractiveness. All you have
to do is ask a black woman how much her
first perm burned her scalp, or ask any
woman how she feels about the time it
takes her to primp and preen in the
mornings, not to mention for special oc
casions. This is why I enjoyed my short
hair; it freed up so much of my time. The
fact that it was literally impossible to
spend two hours doing my hair (since I
just didn't have that much hair to do) was

so liberating, and that carried into other
aspects of my life. So what is really going
on? Why do we allow ourselves to be dic
tated to in this way?
Well, to tell the truth, growing my hair
was my own choice. It was partly a matter
of convenience â€” I was bored with short
hair so I wanted it longer, but that meant
growing it long enough to tie it up. How
ever, I will not lie: It was also partly a mat
ter of vanity and the need to feel attractive.
And so I'm wondering, is that really nec
essary? Shouldn't I demand to be judged
on something other than appearance?
Well, it is important to humans to find
partners, since we're social beings. And of
course, the main way we size them up is
through sight. Apparently in many other
species the males have special sets of eyes

and / or regions of the brain developed
specifically for the purpose of tracking fe
males. And we do kind of need this process
to happen, because we eventually start to
feel the need to have kids. As a friend's fa
ther, who is a doctor, pointed out: "In the
purely biological sense, you have failed as
a member of your species if you do not re
produce." Now, whether you agree with
that is another story, but I do think it has
some degree of salience.
If you need to pair up to reproduce,
you need to choose a partner; the main
way you identify them is through sight,
and you have your preferences about
what you like to see. But what bothers me
is the effects. What about all the young
girls growing up watching TV believing
that they will never measure up to the
world's standard of what it means to be
good enough or pretty enough. This is a
real issue, even if you don't think it's im
portant to engage in relationships of the
romantic kind.
It has even been shown that in the cor
porate world, the more attractive of two
applicants fora job will be hired in a case
where their qualifications are equal. Be
yond good grooming, you can't really con
trol the features you were born with, so
since beauty is so subjective, can't we call
that discrimination? If the beauty were re
placed with another variable, like age or
height, wouldn't we be outraged?
Maybe we should think about that fora
minute.
