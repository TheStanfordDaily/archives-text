The military's unintentional
contribution to gay rights
Several excellent letters have been
published about the ROTC and gays in
the military, including Brian Ball's "U.S.
military is perhaps the world's greatest
defender of gay rights" (Jan. 22). What's
more, there is substantial historical evi
dence that the U.S. military has signifi
cantly contributed to the rise of the mod
ern gay rights movement, albeit unin
tentionally.
During World War 11, the military cre
ated a new policy on homosexuality. In
stead of waiting to catch gays in sexual acts
and charge them with sodomy (which
rarely happened), the new policy was de
signed to either "treat" or exclude every
one with a homosexual orientation from
the military, regardless of whether a per
son was actually involved in a same-sex re
lationship. The military began asking
every man drafted about his sexuality.
This had broad historical conse
quences. First, before WWII, being gay
or lesbian was not generally considered
an identity. Homosexuality was not dis
cussed in the media or in official society.
The military's new policy began to
change this.
Gay-related discharges skyrocketed;
there were over 9,000 during WWII.
And they weren't honorable discharges.
They were a special kind, nicknamed
"blue discharges" because they were
printed on blue paper.
Denied veteran's benefits and with the
bleak prospects of returning home and
facing the embarrassment of the blue dis
charge papers, many stayed where they
were in the ports of call, such as New York
and San Francisco.
These men and some women began to
build the climate of (relative) tolerance

that would begin to make these cities
major centers for gays and lesbians.
Additionally, the climate among ser
vicemen at war was one of relaxed social
norms compared to life in small-town
America before the war. It created an en
vironment in which some gay people
could figure out who they were, and it is
not much of a surprise that of the 16 mil
lion Americans who served in the war,
many were gay and found each other in
course. This was no big secret. My grand
father served in the Pacific theater dur
ing WWII and, when docked in a port of
call, was once invited by certain ship
mates to join them and go "beat up
queers." He declined.
Many gay servicemen and some
women were not suspected or discovered
and received honorable discharges at the
end of the war. After the war, some went
back to their hometowns and attempted
to lead "normal" heterosexual lives: mar
rying, taking advantage of the GI bill to
get an education, finding jobs and having
kids. But others didn't want to go back to
that life, or attempted to do so and failed,
and wound up back in cities like New
York and San Francisco where a critical
mass of gays and lesbians was beginning
to build.
Indeed, the first major gay organiza
tion in the U.S. was the Veteran's Benev
olent Association, a group formed by gay
people who had fought for their country
and felt they weren't getting the respect
they deserved. It is this tremendous social
change, largely created by World War II
and the policies of the U.S. military, that
sowed the seeds of the modern gay civil
rights movement, including the Stonewall
rebellion in New York City and the elec
tion of the first openly gay public official
in the nation, Harvey Milk, to the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors. (He was

assassinated less than a year later.)
The military did not stop asking re
cruits about their sexual orientation until
1993, when the policy was changed to
something so disingenuous only Bill Clin
ton could have thought of it: "Don't ask,
don't tell." Under the current policy, dis
charges have remained high â€” in many
years, higher than they were before.
I hope our generation, through our
votes and leadership, will change this, one
of the last vestiges of government-sanc
tioned, immoral discrimination in Ameri
can life. If you are willing and able to serve
your country and defend freedom as a
soldier in the U.S. military, you ought to
be able to do so, regardless of your sexual
orientation.
Hoover Institution? Of course it
should stay here. ROTC? If they want to
come back to Stanford, we should wel
come it. The University doesn't need to
give academic credit, but 1 agree with [let
ter-writer] Brendan Lehnert's assertion
that we should be focusing on positive
change.
If anyone thinks keeping the ROTC off
campus (or keeping military recruiters
out of high schools) is an effective way to
make things better, they are deluding
themselves. And if an alum wanted to
endow a "Roosevelt Institution for the
Study of Liberalism, Equality and Ways
Government Programs Can Make Our
Society Better," I think we should wel
come that, too.
Let's remember the Golden Rule, folks.
Other ideas and other people are nothing
to be afraid of, unless we lack the maturity
to treat each other with respect.
