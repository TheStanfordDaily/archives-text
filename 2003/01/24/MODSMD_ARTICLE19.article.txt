The military's unintentional
contribution to gay rights
Several excellent letters have been
published about the ROTC and gays in
the military, including Brian Ball's "U.S.
military is perhaps the world's greatest
defender of gay rights" (Jan. 22). What's
more, there is substantial historical evi
dence that the U.S. military has signifi
cantly contributed to the rise of the mod
ern gay rights movement, albeit unin
tentionally.
During World War 11, the military cre
ated a new policy on homosexuality. In
stead of waiting to catch gays in sexual acts
and charge them with sodomy (which
rarely happened), the new policy was de
signed to either "treat" or exclude every
one with a homosexual orientation from
the military, regardless of whether a per
son was actually involved in a same-sex re
lationship. The military began asking
every man drafted about his sexuality.
This had broad historical conse
quences. First, before WWII, being gay
or lesbian was not generally considered
an identity. Homosexuality was not dis
cussed in the media or in official society.
The military's new policy began to
change this.
Gay-related discharges skyrocketed;
there were over 9,000 during WWII.
And they weren't honorable discharges.
They were a special kind, nicknamed
"blue discharges" because they were
printed on blue paper.
Denied veteran's benefits and with the
bleak prospects of returning home and
facing the embarrassment of the blue dis
charge papers, many stayed where they
were in the ports of call, such as New York
and San Francisco.
These men and some women began to
build the climate of (relative) tolerance

that would begin to make these cities
major centers for gays and lesbians.
Additionally, the climate among ser
vicemen at war was one of relaxed social
norms compared to life in small-town
America before the war. It created an en
vironment in which some gay people
could figure out who they were, and it is
not much of a surprise that of the 16 mil
lion Americans who served in the war,
many were gay and found each other in
course. This was no big secret. My grand
father served in the Pacific theater dur
ing WWII and, when docked in a port of
call, was once invited by certain ship
mates to join them and go "beat up
queers." He declined.
Many gay servicemen and some
women were not suspected or discovered
and received honorable discharges at the
end of the war. After the war, some went
back to their hometowns and attempted
to lead "normal" heterosexual lives: mar
rying, taking advantage of the GI bill to
get an education, finding jobs and having
kids. But others didn't want to go back to
that life, or attempted to do so and failed,
and wound up back in cities like New
York and San Francisco where a critical
mass of gays and lesbians was beginning
to build.
Indeed, the first major gay organiza
tion in the U.S. was the Veteran's Benev
olent Association, a group formed by gay
people who had fought for their country
and felt they weren't getting the respect
they deserved. It is this tremendous social
change, largely created by World War II
and the policies of the U.S. military, that
sowed the seeds of the modern gay civil
rights movement, including the Stonewall
rebellion in New York City and the elec
tion of the first openly gay public official
in the nation, Harvey Milk, to the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors. (He was

assassinated less than a year later.)
The military did not stop asking re
cruits about their sexual orientation until
1993, when the policy was changed to
something so disingenuous only Bill Clin
ton could have thought of it: "Don't ask,
don't tell." Under the current policy, dis
charges have remained high — in many
years, higher than they were before.
I hope our generation, through our
votes and leadership, will change this, one
of the last vestiges of government-sanc
tioned, immoral discrimination in Ameri
can life. If you are willing and able to serve
your country and defend freedom as a
soldier in the U.S. military, you ought to
be able to do so, regardless of your sexual
orientation.
Hoover Institution? Of course it
should stay here. ROTC? If they want to
come back to Stanford, we should wel
come it. The University doesn't need to
give academic credit, but 1 agree with [let
ter-writer] Brendan Lehnert's assertion
that we should be focusing on positive
change.
If anyone thinks keeping the ROTC off
campus (or keeping military recruiters
out of high schools) is an effective way to
make things better, they are deluding
themselves. And if an alum wanted to
endow a "Roosevelt Institution for the
Study of Liberalism, Equality and Ways
Government Programs Can Make Our
Society Better," I think we should wel
come that, too.
Let's remember the Golden Rule, folks.
Other ideas and other people are nothing
to be afraid of, unless we lack the maturity
to treat each other with respect.

'The time has come to bring ROTC back'
As usual, a long list of Defense Agencies
and contractors is scheduled to appear at
this weekend's School of Engineering job
fair. The strong presence of the defense
industry at these recruiting events is a re
minder of the steady How of engineers that
leave Stanford each year to begin careers
in the defense industry.
Yet despite the continual support for
the military on the part of Stanford alum
ni working in the defense sector, the Fac
ulty Senate has refused to allow fora full-
Hedged ROTC program at Stanford lot
over 30 years.
The time has come to bring ROTC back.
With more of our military personnel
being deployed overseas each day in the
shadow of a looming war with Iraq, the
Stanford faculty needs to make a collective
show of support for our men and women
in uniform.
The idea of bringing ROTC back has
tended to attract conservatives on campus,
but re-establishing ROTC isn't about sup
porting the policies of the Bush adminis
tration regarding Iraq or any other Re
publican agenda. In fact, this shouldn't be
a partisan issue at all. Bringing ROTC
back is about supporting the men and
women who have to do our fighting and
supporting them at all times, despite the

political climate.
Re-establishing ROTC would also be a
strong gesture of sympathy for students
and alumni who have family members in
active duty during (his time of foreign
policy crisis.
Many have argued in the past that be
cause of the military's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy toward gays and lesbians, sup
porting ROTC would go against the Uni
versity's anti-discrimination policy.
However, the University would be wise
to recognize that because military laws and
rights are distinct from those governing
U.S. civilians, the military is rather impervi
ous to outside social pressures such as boy
cotts. Declining to reinstate the ROTC- pro
gram at Stanford does nothing but allow
existing military policy to go unchallenged.
The best way for Stanford to affect
change in the policies of the U.S. military
is by involving its students in active mili
tary service. In short, the military is best
shaped from within.
Why shouldn't Stanford take a more ac
tive role in helping to lead and shape the
U.S. military of the 21st century?

INS registration requirements are
necessary 'in a state of war'
In its editorial on Jan. 21, The Daily
urged Stanford to make an official state
ment decrying the new INS registration
requirements for foreign students. The

Daily used the opportunity to lament that
the INS does not treat international stu
dents with "fairness and respect."
Perhaps The Daily editorial stall lias
somehow missed the fact that the U.S. is
effectively in a state of war after having
been viciously attacked by terrorists on
Sept. 11. Perhaps The Daily is equally
unaware that all of the conspirators in
that attack were Islamic fundamentalists
and that 15 of the 19 perpetrators came
from a single country, Saudi Arabia. Per
haps The Daily is unaware of these facts,
but it is more likely that it simply chooses
to ignore them.
It is not unreasonable to assume that
after an attack by Muslim foreign nation
als, the government would express some
interest in other Muslim foreign nationals
residing in the United States. Had the at
tack been perpetrated by fundamentalist
Hindus, for example, the government
would be equally interested in tracking cit
izens of India and Nepal residing in the
U.S. The Daily's attempt to paint this poli
cy as unfair is tantamount to burying one's
head in the sand and pretending that the
problem of international terrorists target
ing the United States does not exist.
Finally, being an international student
myself, I certainly believe that interna
tional students should be treated with
fairness and respect. And this is exactly
how they are being treated. Registration
with the INS is not at all an unreasonable
requirement.

Alum lauds Goldberg's 'fine run'
as a KZSU broadcaster
During my last three years at Stanford,
I had the pleasure of listening to Chad
Goldberg call Stanford baseball games on
KZSU. The first time I tuned into one of
Chad's broadcasts, 1 had difficulty believ
ing that it was a Stanford student doing the
play-by-play because it sounded like a pro
fessional announcer. While my Stanford
days have come to a close, Chad's fine run
will continue this year. I know that I will be
tuning in to hear the "sweet sound of alu
minum." I recommend that all of you give
it a try. It promises to be another fine per
formance by one of Stanford's many tal
ented students.

lion Americans who served in the war,
many were gay and found each other in
course. This was no big secret. My grand
father served in the Pacific theater dur
ing WWII and, when docked in a port of
call, was once invited by certain ship
mates to join them and go "beat up
queers." He declined.
Many gay servicemen and some
women were not suspected or discovered
and received honorable discharges at the
end of the war. After the war, some went
back to their hometowns and attempted
to lead "normal" heterosexual lives: mar
rying, taking advantage of the GI bill to
get an education, finding jobs and having
kids. But others didn't want to go back to
that life, or attempted to do so and failed,
and wound up back in cities like New
York and San Francisco where a critical
mass of gays and lesbians was beginning
to build.
Indeed, the first major gay organiza
tion in the U.S. was the Veteran's Benev
olent Association, a group formed by gay
people who had fought for their country
and felt they weren't getting the respect
they deserved. It is this tremendous social
change, largely created by World War II
and the policies of the U.S. military, that
sowed the seeds of the modern gay civil
rights movement, including the Stonewall
rebellion in New York City and the elec
tion of the first openly gay public official
in the nation, Harvey Milk, to the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors. (He was

assassinated less than a year later.)
The military did not stop asking re
cruits about their sexual orientation until
1993, when the policy was changed to
something so disingenuous only Bill Clin
ton could have thought of it: "Don't ask,
don't tell." Under the current policy, dis
charges have remained high — in many
years, higher than they were before.
I hope our generation, through our
votes and leadership, will change this, one
of the last vestiges of government-sanc
tioned, immoral discrimination in Ameri
can life. If you are willing and able to serve
your country and defend freedom as a
soldier in the U.S. military, you ought to
be able to do so, regardless of your sexual
orientation.
Hoover Institution? Of course it
should stay here. ROTC? If they want to
come back to Stanford, we should wel
come it. The University doesn't need to
give academic credit, but 1 agree with [let
ter-writer] Brendan Lehnert's assertion
that we should be focusing on positive
change.
If anyone thinks keeping the ROTC off
campus (or keeping military recruiters
out of high schools) is an effective way to
make things better, they are deluding
themselves. And if an alum wanted to
endow a "Roosevelt Institution for the
Study of Liberalism, Equality and Ways
Government Programs Can Make Our
Society Better," I think we should wel
come that, too.
Let's remember the Golden Rule, folks.
Other ideas and other people are nothing
to be afraid of, unless we lack the maturity
to treat each other with respect.

'The time has come to bring ROTC back'
As usual, a long list of Defense Agencies
and contractors is scheduled to appear at
this weekend's School of Engineering job
fair. The strong presence of the defense
industry at these recruiting events is a re
minder of the steady How of engineers that
leave Stanford each year to begin careers
in the defense industry.
Yet despite the continual support for
the military on the part of Stanford alum
ni working in the defense sector, the Fac
ulty Senate has refused to allow fora full-
Hedged ROTC program at Stanford lot
over 30 years.
The time has come to bring ROTC back.
With more of our military personnel
being deployed overseas each day in the
shadow of a looming war with Iraq, the
Stanford faculty needs to make a collective
show of support for our men and women
in uniform.
The idea of bringing ROTC back has
tended to attract conservatives on campus,
but re-establishing ROTC isn't about sup
porting the policies of the Bush adminis
tration regarding Iraq or any other Re
publican agenda. In fact, this shouldn't be
a partisan issue at all. Bringing ROTC
back is about supporting the men and
women who have to do our fighting and
supporting them at all times, despite the

political climate.
Re-establishing ROTC would also be a
strong gesture of sympathy for students
and alumni who have family members in
active duty during (his time of foreign
policy crisis.
Many have argued in the past that be
cause of the military's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy toward gays and lesbians, sup
porting ROTC would go against the Uni
versity's anti-discrimination policy.
However, the University would be wise
to recognize that because military laws and
rights are distinct from those governing
U.S. civilians, the military is rather impervi
ous to outside social pressures such as boy
cotts. Declining to reinstate the ROTC- pro
gram at Stanford does nothing but allow
existing military policy to go unchallenged.
The best way for Stanford to affect
change in the policies of the U.S. military
is by involving its students in active mili
tary service. In short, the military is best
shaped from within.
Why shouldn't Stanford take a more ac
tive role in helping to lead and shape the
U.S. military of the 21st century?

INS registration requirements are
necessary 'in a state of war'
In its editorial on Jan. 21, The Daily
urged Stanford to make an official state
ment decrying the new INS registration
requirements for foreign students. The

Daily used the opportunity to lament that
the INS does not treat international stu
dents with "fairness and respect."
Perhaps The Daily editorial stall lias
somehow missed the fact that the U.S. is
effectively in a state of war after having
been viciously attacked by terrorists on
Sept. 11. Perhaps The Daily is equally
unaware that all of the conspirators in
that attack were Islamic fundamentalists
and that 15 of the 19 perpetrators came
from a single country, Saudi Arabia. Per
haps The Daily is unaware of these facts,
but it is more likely that it simply chooses
to ignore them.
It is not unreasonable to assume that
after an attack by Muslim foreign nation
als, the government would express some
interest in other Muslim foreign nationals
residing in the United States. Had the at
tack been perpetrated by fundamentalist
Hindus, for example, the government
would be equally interested in tracking cit
izens of India and Nepal residing in the
U.S. The Daily's attempt to paint this poli
cy as unfair is tantamount to burying one's
head in the sand and pretending that the
problem of international terrorists target
ing the United States does not exist.
Finally, being an international student
myself, I certainly believe that interna
tional students should be treated with
fairness and respect. And this is exactly
how they are being treated. Registration
with the INS is not at all an unreasonable
requirement.

Alum lauds Goldberg's 'fine run'
as a KZSU broadcaster
During my last three years at Stanford,
I had the pleasure of listening to Chad
Goldberg call Stanford baseball games on
KZSU. The first time I tuned into one of
Chad's broadcasts, 1 had difficulty believ
ing that it was a Stanford student doing the
play-by-play because it sounded like a pro
fessional announcer. While my Stanford
days have come to a close, Chad's fine run
will continue this year. I know that I will be
tuning in to hear the "sweet sound of alu

it a try. It promises to be another fine per

The military's unintentional
contribution to gay rights
Several excellent letters have been
published about the ROTC and gays in
the military, including Brian Ball's "U.S.
military is perhaps the world's greatest
defender of gay rights" (Jan. 22). What's
more, there is substantial historical evi
dence that the U.S. military has signifi
cantly contributed to the rise of the mod
ern gay rights movement, albeit unin
tentionally.
During World War 11, the military cre
ated a new policy on homosexuality. In
stead of waiting to catch gays in sexual acts
and charge them with sodomy (which
rarely happened), the new policy was de
signed to either "treat" or exclude every
one with a homosexual orientation from
the military, regardless of whether a per
son was actually involved in a same-sex re
lationship. The military began asking
every man drafted about his sexuality.
This had broad historical conse
quences. First, before WWII, being gay
or lesbian was not generally considered
an identity. Homosexuality was not dis
cussed in the media or in official society.
The military's new policy began to
change this.
Gay-related discharges skyrocketed;
there were over 9,000 during WWII.
And they weren't honorable discharges.
They were a special kind, nicknamed
"blue discharges" because they were
printed on blue paper.
Denied veteran's benefits and with the
bleak prospects of returning home and
facing the embarrassment of the blue dis
charge papers, many stayed where they
were in the ports of call, such as New York
and San Francisco.
These men and some women began to
build the climate of (relative) tolerance

that would begin to make these cities
major centers for gays and lesbians.
Additionally, the climate among ser
vicemen at war was one of relaxed social
norms compared to life in small-town
America before the war. It created an en
vironment in which some gay people
could figure out who they were, and it is
not much of a surprise that of the 16 mil
lion Americans who served in the war,
many were gay and found each other in
course. This was no big secret. My grand

can life. If you are willing and able to serve
your country and defend freedom as a
soldier in the U.S. military, you ought to
be able to do so, regardless of your sexual
orientation.
Hoover Institution? Of course it
should stay here. ROTC? If they want to
come back to Stanford, we should wel
come it. The University doesn't need to
give academic credit, but 1 agree with [let
ter-writer] Brendan Lehnert's assertion
that we should be focusing on positive
change.
If anyone thinks keeping the ROTC off
campus (or keeping military recruiters
out of high schools) is an effective way to
make things better, they are deluding
themselves. And if an alum wanted to
endow a "Roosevelt Institution for the
Study of Liberalism, Equality and Ways
Government Programs Can Make Our
Society Better," I think we should wel
come that, too.
Let's remember the Golden Rule, folks.
Other ideas and other people are nothing
to be afraid of, unless we lack the maturity
to treat each other with respect.

'The time has come to bring ROTC back'
As usual, a long list of Defense Agencies
and contractors is scheduled to appear at
this weekend's School of Engineering job
fair. The strong presence of the defense
industry at these recruiting events is a re
minder of the steady How of engineers that
leave Stanford each year to begin careers
in the defense industry.
Yet despite the continual support for
the military on the part of Stanford alum
ni working in the defense sector, the Fac
ulty Senate has refused to allow fora full-
Hedged ROTC program at Stanford lot
over 30 years.
The time has come to bring ROTC back.
With more of our military personnel
being deployed overseas each day in the
shadow of a looming war with Iraq, the
Stanford faculty needs to make a collective
show of support for our men and women
in uniform.
The idea of bringing ROTC back has
tended to attract conservatives on campus,
but re-establishing ROTC isn't about sup
porting the policies of the Bush adminis
tration regarding Iraq or any other Re
publican agenda. In fact, this shouldn't be
a partisan issue at all. Bringing ROTC
back is about supporting the men and
women who have to do our fighting and
supporting them at all times, despite the

political climate.
Re-establishing ROTC would also be a
strong gesture of sympathy for students
and alumni who have family members in
active duty during (his time of foreign
policy crisis.
Many have argued in the past that be
cause of the military's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy toward gays and lesbians, sup
porting ROTC would go against the Uni
versity's anti-discrimination policy.
However, the University would be wise
to recognize that because military laws and
rights are distinct from those governing
U.S. civilians, the military is rather impervi
ous to outside social pressures such as boy
cotts. Declining to reinstate the ROTC- pro
gram at Stanford does nothing but allow
existing military policy to go unchallenged.
The best way for Stanford to affect
change in the policies of the U.S. military
is by involving its students in active mili
tary service. In short, the military is best
shaped from within.
Why shouldn't Stanford take a more ac
tive role in helping to lead and shape the
U.S. military of the 21st century?

INS registration requirements are
necessary 'in a state of war'
In its editorial on Jan. 21, The Daily
urged Stanford to make an official state
ment decrying the new INS registration
requirements for foreign students. The

Daily used the opportunity to lament that
the INS does not treat international stu
dents with "fairness and respect."
Perhaps The Daily editorial stall lias
somehow missed the fact that the U.S. is
effectively in a state of war after having
been viciously attacked by terrorists on
Sept. 11. Perhaps The Daily is equally
unaware that all of the conspirators in
that attack were Islamic fundamentalists
and that 15 of the 19 perpetrators came
from a single country, Saudi Arabia. Per
haps The Daily is unaware of these facts,
but it is more likely that it simply chooses
to ignore them.
It is not unreasonable to assume that
after an attack by Muslim foreign nation
als, the government would express some
interest in other Muslim foreign nationals
residing in the United States. Had the at
tack been perpetrated by fundamentalist
Hindus, for example, the government
would be equally interested in tracking cit
izens of India and Nepal residing in the
U.S. The Daily's attempt to paint this poli
cy as unfair is tantamount to burying one's
head in the sand and pretending that the
problem of international terrorists target
ing the United States does not exist.
Finally, being an international student
myself, I certainly believe that interna
tional students should be treated with
fairness and respect. And this is exactly
how they are being treated. Registration
with the INS is not at all an unreasonable
requirement.

Alum lauds Goldberg's 'fine run'
as a KZSU broadcaster
During my last three years at Stanford,
I had the pleasure of listening to Chad
Goldberg call Stanford baseball games on
KZSU. The first time I tuned into one of
Chad's broadcasts, 1 had difficulty believ
ing that it was a Stanford student doing the
play-by-play because it sounded like a pro
fessional announcer. While my Stanford
days have come to a close, Chad's fine run
will continue this year. I know that I will be
tuning in to hear the "sweet sound of alu
minum." I recommend that all of you give
it a try. It promises to be another fine per
formance by one of Stanford's many tal
ented students.
