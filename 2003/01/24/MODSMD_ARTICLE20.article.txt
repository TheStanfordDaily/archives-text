# Segregation in public schools on the rise

(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE,
Mass. â€”As minority populations
in America's public schools contin
ue to climb, schools across the
country are becoming increasingly
segregated, according to a report
released on Thursday by Harvard
University's Civil Rights Project.
According to the report, re
leased to coincide with the Martin
Luther King, Jr. holiday, 44 per
cent of high schools have almost
entirely black student populations,
and only 14 percent of white stu
dents attend schools with signifi
cant minority numbers.
The authors points to this "re
segregation" as a grave threat to the
nation's school systems at a time
when 40 percent of all public school
students are minorities. In highly
multiracial areas such as the South
and the West, that percentage in
creases to nearly halfof all students.
"Public school enrollment in
the year 2000 was more non-white
than it has ever been, and black
students are more segregated than
they have been in the past 30
years," said Erica Frankenberg,
one of the study's authors.
The study found that desegre
gation reached its peak in the late
1980s and has since rapidly re
trenched.
Currently, one-sixth of the
country's black students are edu
cated in schools that are almost
completely non-white. In the
Northeast and Midwest, the pro
portion rises to one-fourth of all
black students. These schools,
which the report calls "apartheid
schools," often suffer from pover
ty, limited resources and a variety
of social and health problems.
"What students need to realize
is that they are living through a pe
riod like the end of the Recon

struction when rights of minorities
in the country are being interpret
ed away by our courts," Harvard
Prof, of Education and Social Poli
cy Gary A. Orfield wrote in an e
mail, "and in which the country is
moving toward greater inequality
and more reinforcement of social
and economic privilege."
Orfield and the report's other
authors blame the problem chiefly
on three Supreme Court decisions
of the early 1990s that lowered the
standards for what is necessary to
be considered a desegregated
school. Since that time, lower
courts have found that school dis
tricts throughout the nation have
met the new standard.
When desegregation laws were
passed in the 19605, school dis
tricts were forced to bus children
from one part of the district to an
other to maintain a satisfactory
level of integration in each school.
The high court rulings in the early
'90s mean that schools no longer
need to bus children.
Although busing met with
fierce opposition in some cities,
Frankenberg said that on the
whole these policies worked and
gained public support.
"You do see some black parents
that have had to shoulder the bur
den of desegregation, but you also
see a growing acceptance of de
segregated schools in the public
opinion," she said.
Frankenberg said she has expe
rienced the phenomenon she and
her colleagues call resegregation.
She attended a public high school
in an Alabama school district
where a desegregation court order
was lifted. In her senior year, the
district redrew the boundary lines
that determine where students
went to high school.
"The white neighborhood was
taken away from the school, so the
black population got bigger," she said.
