## Men grind out win over Bruins 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was a slow, methodical basketball game.
I low slow, you ask?
Even the little kids who participated in
that race during a timeout where they run
to half court and put on an oversi/ed Stan
ford uniform took forever.

Men's Basketball
Last Night: Stanford 52, UCLA 51

Even Stanford President John Hen
nessyjoined the Stanford yell leaders in the
crowd, jumping frantically in trying to
bring some energy back to Maples Pavilion.
But in front of the largest Sixth Man
Club audience so far this season, Stan
ford (13-5, 4-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
barely defeated a struggling UCLA team
(4-10, 2-4), which dropped its fifth game
in a row, 52-51.
Both teams struggled from the field
early, in a low-scoring first half. The Bru
ins opened the contest in a zone full-court
press but quickly took it off when it failed
to produce Cardinal turnovers.
Stanford, on the other hand, opened
the game in its patent 1-3 zone, which

seemed to cause UCLA to stand around a
bit — although (he Bruins didn't seem in
any hurry to score.
"We were kind of messing with the
zone a little bit and we weren't very ag
gressive," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They attacked it pretty in
telligently."
UCLA surprised Stanford with the
type of pace it opted to play at. The Bru
ins consistently showed patience in their
offense, often taking shots with the shot
clock winding down.
"1 didn't anticipate [UCLAJ running
that throw-away motion," Montgomery
said. "That's designed to shorten the
game and it did just that."
And just to reiterate how slow this con
test was, neither team succeeded in pro
ducing a single point off turnovers.
"It feels good [to finally win at home
against UCLA]," said Stanford senior
guard Julius Barnes. "It wasn't the style
I hoped it would be. For some reason
they decided to slow it down a bit, which
isn't typical of UCLA basketball. We
were thrown off by it.
"I told the guys that this was really im
portant to me, especially having lost the
last three [at home to UCLA]. But it didn't

have that for all the marbles type feel."
The first half saw scoring from a variety
of unexpected sources.
With seven minutes left before the in
termission, freshman point guard Jason
Haas stole the ball and scored on a coast
to-coast backside layup. On Stanford's
next trip down, freshman shooting guard
Dan Grunfeld hit a deep 3-pointer to ex
tend the Cardinal's lead to nine, its largest
lead of the half.
The Bruins starting five only man
aged five first-half points, and Stanford
held UCLA senior sharp shooter Jason
Kapono to a meager three points off 1-
for-6 shooting from the field. Sopho
more swingman Dijon Thompson
scored 10 points to keep the Bruins in
the game.
In the second half, UCLA threatened
early. Kapono came out of the locker
room and hit back-to-back shots to put the
Bruins up by five. He finished with 13
points and seven boards.
But once again for the Cardinal, the
game came down to the last few seconds
— something that seems to be turning
into a sort of ritual now.
