# Men struggle, but find a way to win
## Stanford holds on against UCLA despite multitude of mistakes and missed shots 
### MAUREEN MULLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Some would call it a defensive strug
gle, but anyone at Maples Pavilion last
evening couldn't help but see it was
more a comedy of errors.
College sports are usually settled by
the more skilled, the more consistent,
the more well-coached team. Last night
it wasn't the better team that won. It was

(he team that was less bad.
Consider the stats:
Stanford's starters combined to shoot
17-for-49; UCLA's starters went only 9-
for-34. The Bruins held the advantage at
the free-throw line, despite hitting a
meager 61.7 percent.
The 52 points scored by the Cardinal
was the lowest point total in a Stanford
win in the 30-plus-year history of
Maples.
When UCLA head coach Steve Lavin
came into the postgame press confer
ence, he pointed out the silver linings in
what is beginning to look like the peren
nial stormy clouds of the Bruins' season.
"If we can sustain the level of intensi
ty, we can put ourselves in the place to be

successful," said Lavin. "Tonight we
didn't beat ourselves; Stanford beat us."
Despite grabbing the win, Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery was a lit
tle less positive.
"We didn't execute very well. We got
outrebounded. We made mental mis
takes," Montgomery said. "For us to
shoot as poorly as we did and get outre
bounded, it's a credit to our resiliency."
So the question remains, was this a
bad night for the Cardinal or merely
more of the same?
With just over seven minutes remain
ing in the first half, freshman Dan Grun
feld sunk a 3-pointer — reminiscent of
Casey Jacobsen's favorite spot up
mark on the Pac-10 sign — that put
the Cardinal up by a comfortable
nine-point margin and allowed tans
to breathe a sigh of relief. Tonight,
iheStanlord boys had it under con
trol. They were playing good de
tense, rebounding the ball, and, for
the most part, making their shots.
They had made it over that hump.
However, t lie confidence level
in Maples dwindled with the clock,
and by halftime the score was tied
at 29-29.
The second half was marked by
more inconsistent play. Despite
going up by as much as eight, the
Cardinal couldn't seem to put the
Bruins away.
Twenty minutes later Stanford
was locked in a buzzer beater a la
Washington State, Oregon State
and even Boston University.
Luckily for Mike Montgomery's
squad, margin of victory doesn't
count in the record books. At the
end of the night it doesn't matter if
the ditlerential is two or 20 — it is
still another tally in the win column.
"A win is a win," said sopho
more forward Josh Childress. "I
am just happy we got it tonight. We
need to start capitalizing on other
teams' mistakes."
For the Cardinal, playing to
the level of the competition has
become more than a trend — it
has become a mode of existence,
and one only needs to look to
close losses against Montana last
month and last weekend at Wash
ington to begin to recognize that
heart-stoppers aren't always the
best way to go.
"Obviously we can't keep
putting ourselves in this kind of
position," Montgomery said.
For Stanford teams of the past
— for which 20-point wins were
the norm — the only fear lay in
close contests heading into the
postseason. For this year's
squad, tears are more centered

around letting games against
teams with only a 4-9 record slip
away at home.
So what is the key for the
Cardinal?
Alter looking at last evening's
52-point effort, it isn't too difficult
to see that the team needs to in
crease its offensive production.
At Tuesday's press conference,
Montgomery pointed out his team

needs to return to the fundamen
tals on offense. He held a walk
through practice on Monday.
Alter last night's performance,
he couldn't help but pointing out
the failure of his teaching.
"We were struggling to find
someone to get an open shot,"
said Montgomery.
"A teacher deserves an 'F' for
failure to communicate," he added

with a chuckle.
Regardless of the unforced er
rors, junior Matt Lottie h's l-for-8
shooting performance and the
Bruins' 36-31 romping of the Car
dinal on the boards, the Stanford
men still left Maples with smiles on
their faces.
"It is a work in progress," Mont
gomery said. "Every night some
thing new will fall into place."

Sophomore Josh Childress pushes the ball upcourt against UCLA defender Ray Young in last night's Cardinal victory.
Childress led the Cardinal attack, posting a game-high 18 points on 7-17 shooting. Childress also came up with seven
rebounds for the Cardinal, which has lost its dominance on the boards since Justin Davis was sidelined with an injury.
