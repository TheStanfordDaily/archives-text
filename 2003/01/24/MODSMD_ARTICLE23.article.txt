# Saving the best for last: Cardinal strong on beam
## 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN STAFF WRITER 
There are four things every collegiate gymnast
knows about the balance beam: It is 10.4 feet long, 3.9
feet above the floor, a mere four inches wide and domi
nated by the No. 10 Stanford women's gymnastics team
(3-1,0-0 Pacific- 10C Conference).

"Meets are won and lost on beam," head coach Kris
ten Smyth said. "Our group of beam workers is one of
the best in the country."
The Cardinal is currently ranked third in the nation
on beam and anchoring Stanford on this unsteady ap
paratus are juniors Lise Leveille and Lindsay Wing.
"Beam's defining characteristic is requiring mental
toughness," Smyth said. "Lise and Lindsay have superb
skills and hit flawless routines consistently. We can al
ways count on them when push comes to shove."
Between them Leveille and Wing have garnered
every possible award on beam, short of a national title,
over the last two seasons.
As rookies, they were co-Pac-10 champions on the
event — their winning score of 9.975 is the Cardinal's
all-time top performance on beam. Wing then became
the regional beam champion en route to first-team All-
America honors and second place on beam at the NCAA
Championships.
In 2002, Leveille and Wing were first-team All-
Americans on beam, repeated as co-Pac-10 champions
and shared the regional beam title. Leveille also re
ceived All-Conference honors in the event.
Bottom line: The duo packs a powerful one-two
punch.
Leveille and Wing's efforts are ably supported by the
rest of the beam lineup, which adds insult to injury for
the Cardinal's rivals.
"In collegiate gymnastics, you aim for higher scores
as you progress down the lineup," Smyth said. "But our
beam is so strong, order often doesn't matter. All of our
beam workers can notch outstanding scores."
Junior Kendall Beck's performance against No. 6
Denver on Jan. 18 is c ase in point. Beck, who narrowly
missed All-America honors on beam in 2002, was sec -
ond in the lineup and scored a career-high 9.9.
Junior Caroline Fluhrerand freshman Natalie Foley

can also be depended on to execute solid beam routines.
"I have the confidence that my teammates will hit
their beam routines," Leveille said. "It's a great feeling,
because then I don't have to hold back and can be real
ly aggressive."
"It's good to know that our team is strong and that
everyone is contributing great performances," Wing
echoed.
Leveille, Wing and the rest of the squad are re
grouping after a tough loss to Denver on the road and
will look to got back on top during their trip to Califor
nia (3-1,0-1) this Friday.
"Coming off the Denver meet, we are especially mo
tivated and hungry lor the chance to make improve
ments," Wing said.
The Pioneers were chomping at the bit in antic ipa-

tion of facing Stanford and
chalked up their first win in history
against die Cardinal after seven
unsuccessful tries.
Stanford's performance was high
lighted by Bet:k, who took lirst on die
vaulting table with a career-high
9.95, to go along widi her stellar per
formance on beam. Foley and Ijev
eille continued their tour de force in
the all-around, where they secured
third and fourth, respectively.
Denver benefited from the
home-court advantage during its
record-setting night, which saw se
nior Michelle Kasuga receive two
perfect 10s as Stanford was handed
its first loss of the year.
"Every time you go on the
road, you have to be not just good
but great," Smyth said. "Denver is
a solid competitor, and we had to
be flawless and not allow them to
take deductions."
The Bears lost their first meet of
the season to No. 1 UCLA and will
attempt to get back on the winning
track this weekend.
"Cal is a great rival, and these dual
meets help us see what works and
continue to upgrade our difficulty,"
said Smyth, who was a three-time
Ail-American at Cal and die Golden
Bears' Gymnast of the Decade.
Amidst a schedule packed with
tough competitors, the Cardinal
focuses more on competition
against itself.
"It really hit me in Denver how
talented our team is as a whole,"
Leveille said. "Wejust need to con
tinue stepping it up and hitting
our routines."
"We have room for improve
ment and a lot of irons in the fire
waiting to be unveiled," Smyth
said. "That means we're right on
track for where we want to be in
the postseason."
And, as is the rule at dual meets
away from home, the Cardinal will
finish Friday night's meet on the
balance beam.
"Beam is one of our best events
as a team," Wing said. "And it's al
ways nice to end the night on a
strong note."

knows about the balance beam: It is 10.4 feet long, 3.9
feet above the floor, a mere four inches wide and domi
nated by the No. 10 Stanford women's gymnastics team
(3-1,0-0 Pacific- 10C Conference).

at Cal, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.

"Meets are won and lost on beam," head coach Kris
ten Smyth said. "Our group of beam workers is one of
the best in the country."
The Cardinal is currently ranked third in the nation
on beam and anchoring Stanford on this unsteady ap
paratus are juniors Lise Leveille and Lindsay Wing.
"Beam's defining characteristic is requiring mental
toughness," Smyth said. "Lise and Lindsay have superb
skills and hit flawless routines consistently. We can al
ways count on them when push comes to shove."
Between them Leveille and Wing have garnered
every possible award on beam, short of a national title,
over the last two seasons.
As rookies, they were co-Pac-10 champions on the
event — their winning score of 9.975 is the Cardinal's
all-time top performance on beam. Wing then became
the regional beam champion en route to first-team All-
America honors and second place on beam at the NCAA
Championships.
In 2002, Leveille and Wing were first-team All-
Americans on beam, repeated as co-Pac-10 champions
and shared the regional beam title. Leveille also re
ceived All-Conference honors in the event.
Bottom line: The duo packs a powerful one-two
punch.
Leveille and Wing's efforts are ably supported by the
rest of the beam lineup, which adds insult to injury for
the Cardinal's rivals.
"In collegiate gymnastics, you aim for higher scores
as you progress down the lineup," Smyth said. "But our
beam is so strong, order often doesn't matter. All of our
beam workers can notch outstanding scores."
Junior Kendall Beck's performance against No. 6
Denver on Jan. 18 is c ase in point. Beck, who narrowly
missed All-America honors on beam in 2002, was sec -
ond in the lineup and scored a career-high 9.9.
Junior Caroline Fluhrerand freshman Natalie Foley

can also be depended on to execute solid beam routines.
"I have the confidence that my teammates will hit
their beam routines," Leveille said. "It's a great feeling,
because then I don't have to hold back and can be real
ly aggressive."
"It's good to know that our team is strong and that
everyone is contributing great performances," Wing
echoed.
Leveille, Wing and the rest of the squad are re
grouping after a tough loss to Denver on the road and
will look to got back on top during their trip to Califor
nia (3-1,0-1) this Friday.
"Coming off the Denver meet, we are especially mo
tivated and hungry lor the chance to make improve
ments," Wing said.

tion of facing Stanford and
chalked up their first win in history
against die Cardinal after seven
unsuccessful tries.
Stanford's performance was high
lighted by Bet:k, who took lirst on die
vaulting table with a career-high
9.95, to go along widi her stellar per
formance on beam. Foley and Ijev
eille continued their tour de force in
the all-around, where they secured
third and fourth, respectively.
Denver benefited from the
home-court advantage during its
record-setting night, which saw se
nior Michelle Kasuga receive two
perfect 10s as Stanford was handed
its first loss of the year.
"Every time you go on the
road, you have to be not just good
but great," Smyth said. "Denver is
a solid competitor, and we had to
be flawless and not allow them to
take deductions."
The Bears lost their first meet of
the season to No. 1 UCLA and will
attempt to get back on the winning
track this weekend.
"Cal is a great rival, and these dual
meets help us see what works and
continue to upgrade our difficulty,"
said Smyth, who was a three-time
Ail-American at Cal and die Golden
Bears' Gymnast of the Decade.
Amidst a schedule packed with
tough competitors, the Cardinal
focuses more on competition
against itself.
"It really hit me in Denver how
talented our team is as a whole,"
Leveille said. "Wejust need to con
tinue stepping it up and hitting
our routines."
"We have room for improve
ment and a lot of irons in the fire
waiting to be unveiled," Smyth
said. "That means we're right on
track for where we want to be in
the postseason."
And, as is the rule at dual meets
away from home, the Cardinal will
finish Friday night's meet on the
balance beam.
"Beam is one of our best events
as a team," Wing said. "And it's al
ways nice to end the night on a
strong note."
