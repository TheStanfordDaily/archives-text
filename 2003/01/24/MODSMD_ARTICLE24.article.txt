# Baseball opens up vs. Santa Clara
## 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The long road to Omaha begins
on Highway 101, as a freeway series
against the Santa Clara Broncos
opens the 2003 season for the No. 3
Cardinal baseball team.
Junior John Hudgins is getting
the nod to start tomorrow's game at
Santa Clara, and will face the Bron
cos' lefty Joe Diefenderfer.

Baseball
at Santa Clara, Saturday, 1:00 p.m.
vs. Santa Clara, Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

Sunday will mark the home
opener for Stanford, as Cardinal
southpaw Tim Cunningham will
take the mound at Sunken Dia
mond against fellow lefty Matt
Travis.
Both Cunningham and Iltid
gins were mainstays of the starting
rotation last year, combining fora
formidable 20 wins with just four
losses. Travis and Diefenderfer
own a combined 9-10 record.
The pitching records notwith
standing, the Cardinal has to like its
chances against the Broncos given
their series history. Stanford has
won 22 of its last 23 contests against
Santa Clara, and owns a 75-28-1
total record over its Peninsula rivals
since 1977.
However, that one Bronco win
came in last year's series between
the two teams.
With last year's win and two near
misses against the Cardinal, the
Broncos are unlikely to be intimi
dated coming into this weekend,
and the Cardinal is far from having
a seasoned, set roster.
Ivitst year's Cardinal infielders all
had fielding percentages above
.900 and comprised one of the most
solid defenses in the nation. How
ever, all four of those starters either
graduated or left for the Major
League Draft, meaning Stanford
will be doing a great deal of experi
menting in the early stages of the
season to determine who will play
which position.

A talented freshman class
promises to be capable of filling the
spikes of last year's stars both on the
field and at the plate, but it may take
some time for the Cardinal to adjust
to its new roster.
While many of last season's stars
may have departed, the Cardinal

still has the bats of senior catcher
Ryan Garko and junior outfielders
Sam Fuld and Carlos Quentin, not
to mention the pitching talent of
veterans Hudgins an<j Cunning
ham.
Both of this weekend's contests
begin at 1:00 p.m.
