# Panel says pro-choice battle far from over

### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Marking the 30th anniversary of the
Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v.
Wade, Stanford Students For Choice
presented a panel teach-in entitled
"Threats to Reproductive Freedom
and What You Can Do as the Pro-
Choice Majority." The event, held last
night in the History Corner, attracted
around 80 people, predominantly fe
males, who gathered to celebrate the
legalization of abortion.
"Even though this generation of
people has all been born after Roe v.
Wade, we can't take for granted that
our reproductive rights are still under
attack," said Students For Choice Coor
dinator Tess Bridgeman. Bridgeman, a
senior, is on Choice USA's "30 under
30" list as a young leader in the pro
choice struggle.
The panel featured three keynote
speakers: Crystal Plati, the executive di
rector of Choice USA; Rosemary Stasek,

a member of Catholics fora Free Choice;
and Cari Sietstra, a legal fellow at the Cal
ifornia Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League.
"[Roe v. Wade] is only one piece of the
entire reproductive rights picture," Plati
said. "Another reason I'm glad to be out
of Washington, D.C. is that 1 don't have
to look at the dome on Capitol Hill. I
know very well what they've been plan
ning in there."
In light of the Bush administration's
support for anti-abortion policies and
measures, pro-choice activists feel that
they need to continue pushing.
"Eighty-seven percent of counties [in
the United States] have no abortion prac
tices," Plati said. "Roe was never enough
to secure women's reproductive rights.
Since 1995, 335 anti-choice measures
have been enacted at the state level.
"Is the threat to reproductive free
dom greater now than it was 30 years
ago? Absolutely. Just bear in mind that it
did not happen overnight."
While abortion has always been a topic

that has elicited heated controversy, the
anniversary of Roe v. Wade has brought
the issue back under national scrutiny.
"My personal opinion is that it would
be a real misfortune if Roe v. Wade came
down," said Stanford Law Prof. George
Fisher. "In many states, perhaps the ma
jority, abortion would still be available.
But in many places — and perhaps

across broad swaths ot middle .Ameri
ca — a woman, who was not ready to
have a child and who lacked the money
or mobility to travel to a state with legal
abortion, would have to bear a child she
didn't want. That could be a tragedy for
both of them."

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Stanford Students For Choice organized
a panel teach-in last night.
Fisher, whose area of expertise
as a law professor does not encom
pass the issues pertinent in Roe v.
Wade, separates his personal opin
ion from that of a law professor.
Pro-life students, around 20 of
whom held a candlelight vigil in
White Plaza on Tuesday, have also
recognized the Roe v. Wade an
niversary.
"If we are truly committed to
ending abortion," said Stanford
Students For Life's Eva St. Clair,
"we should not attack the law, but
the causes of abortion itself: pover
ty, anti-feminist and anti-woman
ideologies, sexual and reproductive
ignorance, racism, the subjective
valuization of human life, the
stigmatization of out-of-wedlock
pregnancy, incest, rape, domestic
violence and discrimination against
parents in the workplace and
school."
In contrast, Plati suggested that
pro-choice advocates "have to run
local grassroots campaigns because
[they] need to get ready to fight
state legislatures."
Last night's panel emphasized
the threat that the current Supreme
Court justices represent to pro
choice goals, which are much more
broad than merely supporting
abortion, according to Plati.
"When we say reproductive free
dom, we mean the right of a woman
to choose whether she will or will
not have sex, will or will not be preg
nant, and will or will not have a
child," Plati said.
"This event is really important in
light of the new [U.S.] administra
tion and policy," said sophomore
Lisa Diver, a member and one of
the organizers of yesterday's panel.
"It's important to have an event like
this so we can educate the public. All
of us are in college, and we weren't
alive when abortion was illegal. We
need to know what women went
through before this."
