# Despite illness and injury,
## Metzler battles back 
### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
As a redshirt freshman last year. Brad
Metzler learned a few harsh realities
about wrestling at the collegiate level,
namely what it's like to watch your team
mates compete week in and week out
while you watch from the side hobbled by
injury — or sickness.

WRESTUNG
at Cal State-Bakersfield, Sunday, Noon

But after battling mononucleosis for
the first half of last season and fighting
through a bruised meniscus, Metzler did a
little teaching of his own the rest of the
year. He rebounded to win 16 matches,
place fourth at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships and qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
So perhaps it should come as no sur
prise that after being sidelined for the
past two-and-a-half weeks with an LCL
tear of his left knee — not to mention a
nagging pinched nerve in his shoulder —
Metzler returned to the Cardinal lineup
on Saturday to pin his opponent in a
mere 35 seconds.
"I don't feel healthy yet," Metzler said.
"I feel like I'm wrestling pretty weak, only
going about 60 or 70 percent of what I
should be going. I think I just had a
hunger and desire to get on the mat and
was so fired up because I had been off the
mat for three weeks watching my team."
Metzler, who was a four-time Nebraska
state champion and compiled a 120-0
record in high school, injured his knee at
the tail end of practice the day before the
team headed to the Lone Star Duals on
Jan. 4. With no backup at his weight class,
Stanford was forced to forfeit all three
matches at 133 in Texas and in subse
quent meets against Pennsylvania, Ore
gon and Oregon State.
While fellow redshirt sophomore Matt
Gentry continued his dominance and ju
nior Nathan Peterson began displaying
the form that made him an NCAA qualifi
er last season, the team struggled to earn
wins without Metzler. The Cardinal had
lost seven straight before Saturday's 24-20
triumph over Portland State.

Stanford head coach Steve Buddie put
Metzler's absence in perspective:
"II you compare it to the basketball
team, it's like not having a [Josh] Chil
dress or a [Julius] Barnes in there," Bud
die said. "Brad is someone who elevates
the team. We certainly missed his team
points and his performance, but also all

the other things that come with that —
the leadership, the morale, the sense of
humor ... he was sorely missed."
Citing the effect the injuries have had
on his conditioning and technique, Met
zler is frustrated with his year so far, but
his experience last season provides some
perspective for dealing with his health

troubles.
"The whole left side of my body is
messed up right now," Metzler said. "But
these are just physical injuries, unlike last
year when mono really took a lot out of
me. I was just drained mentally and phys
ically."
Metzler dealt with a whole different
challenge the first hali of this season after
dropping down one weight class from 141
to 133 over the summer.
"Down at 133 I feel a lot stronger,"
Metzler said. "I'm being able to push guys
around a little bit easier, but they're a lot
quicker on their feet and a lot more versa
tile. That's taking a little time to get ad
justed to, but I think I've done pretty
well."
Admitting that the weight is a lot
tougher to make this year, Metzler has
rolled to a 12-2 record this season, includ
ing two pins and a first-place finish at the
California Open.
He will put his perfect 5-0 dual meet
record on the line this Sunday as Stanford
(3-8, 1-3 Pac-10) travels to Gal-State Bak
ersfield fora dual meet starting at 12:30.
Metzler will battle the Roadrunners'
Malt Sanchez, whom he has already beat
en this year.
"I had a pretty non-strenuous schedule
going into the break," Metzler said. "I had
only encountered a couple of guys who
were above average, and I felt pretty con
fident where I was at. I've got a lot of
tough matches coming up in the next two
or three weeks."
After Bakersfield, Stanford hosts Cal
Poly on Jan. 31 before heading to the All-
Cal Invitational on Feb. 7.
Metzler's biggest test yet should come
one week later on Valentine's Day, at
home against UC-Davis senior Urijah
Faber. A win over Faber, who is currently
ranked in the top 20 nationally, could po
tentially do wonders for Metzler's seeding
at Pac-10s.
Qualifying for the NCAA tournament
at 133 will be no easy task, as the weight
class is one of the strongest in the confer
ence. But for Metzler, who knows what it's
like to stare adversity in the face, the chal
lenge is welcomed.
"I just have to go out there and wrestle
a smart tournament, and I should quali
fy," Metzler said.

despite battling mononucleosis and a bruised meniscus, has shown his resolve once again this
season by coming back quickly from a knee injury.
