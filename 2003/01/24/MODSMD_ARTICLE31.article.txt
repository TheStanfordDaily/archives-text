# Men's gymnastics kicks off new season
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No more flying 40-year-olds, hel
mets and tag-team gymnastics. This
time the competition is for real.
After previewing new routines in
a very entertaining alumni exhibi
tion meet last week, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team kicks off the
2003 competition season tomorrow
night at the Cardinal Open.
"This meet is going to start us
rolling," said senior co-captain Mar-

p.m.

shall Erwin. "This is our first chance
to gain some momentum."
The Cardinal Open is Stanford's
largest annual meet and often fea
tures high-level international com
petitors. This year, the collegiate
portion of the competition will fea
ture the Stanford varsity and Stan
ford club teams, California and UC-
Santa Barbara club gymnastics. For
mer World Championship team
member Yewki Tomita is also
scheduled to compete.
Stanford will get its first look at
fifth-ranked rival Cal. The Bears
feature four Ail-Americans and two
NCAA event champions, including
current national team member
Cody Moore. Cal also added to its
lineup four freshmen and three
transfer students from UCSB,
which dropped its men's gymnastics
program last year.
Stanford hasn't beaten Cal since
1999, though the Cardinal came
within three-tenths of a point of
beating the Bears last season. Stan
ford will get plenty of chances to try
to come out on top — the teams are
scheduled to meet at least five times
this year.
"Cal is the team to beat," said
Thorn Glielmi, who is making his
collegiate head-coaching debut.
"They finished third at NCAAs last
year, and they're even better this
year."
Former Stanford All-American
David Durante, along with several
of the nation's top high school re
cruits, will compete for the Stanford
club team.
The varsity team already tasted
some competition in an exhibition

meet versus gymnastics alumni last
week. The meet was all fun in games
— for the alumni. The varsity squad
still performed with the intensity of
a real competition.
"The alumni meet was enter
taining for the crowd and a very
useful for the varsity," Glielmi
said. "Their performance was
encouraging."
Though the team counted sever
al falls on high bar and on pommel
horse, the Cardinal was unusually
consistent for this time of the year.
Depth is the team's weakness, but
the team performed at least one full
10.0 difficulty routine on most
events. And in the short training pe
riod since the exhibition, several
gymnasts already upgraded their
routines.
"The guys are right where they
need to be this early in the season,"
Glielmi said. "Even Marshall Erwin

is upgrading his ring routine, be
lieve it or not."
Erwin, the defending NC AA ring
champion, added more strength
moves to the "easier" lull 10.0 diffi
culty ring routine he performed at
the alumni competition.
Erwin isn't the only Cardinal up
grading a high-difficulty routine.
Junior co-captain Dan Gill, the de
fending NCAA vault champion, will
return to the vault lineup after
being sidelined with a knee injury at
the alumni meet. Gill also practiced
a double-twisting double-back flip
on the floor exercise this week and
plans to add a rare release move
combination sequence on the high
bar.
The seniors will likely add to
Stanford's highlight reel, which in
cludes Paul O'Leary's high-flying
floor and high bar routines, Matt
McLean's powerful vault and Cade

Raggio's perfect execution on the
pommel horse.
"The alumni meet was a great
preview for what we're capable of
doing," O'Leary said. "If the young
guys do as well as I know they can
do, we're going to do some dam
age."
The young guys making their
collegiate debuts are freshmen Nate
Downs and Sean Doolan. At the
alumni meet, Downs performed a
solid parallel bars routine, and
Doolan turned in an excellent floor
exercise, dismounting with a two
and-a-half twisting front flip.
The Cardinal Open is tomorrow
at 7:00 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
As Stanford's largest annual meet,
the house is usually packed for the
collegiate competition.
"I'm just looking forward to
throwing some big skills in front of a
large crowd," O'Leary said.

Erwin isn't the only Cardinal up
grading a high-difficulty routine.
Junior co-captain Dan Gill, the de
fending NCAA vault champion, will
return to the vault lineup after
being sidelined with a knee injury at
the alumni meet. Gill also practiced
a double-twisting double-back flip
on the floor exercise this week and
plans to add a rare release move
combination sequence on the high
bar.
The seniors will likely add to
Stanford's highlight reel, which in
cludes Paul O'Leary's high-flying
floor and high bar routines, Matt
McLean's powerful vault and Cade

Raggio's perfect execution on the
pommel horse.
"The alumni meet was a great
preview for what we're capable of
doing," O'Leary said. "If the young
guys do as well as I know they can
do, we're going to do some dam
age."
The young guys making their
collegiate debuts are freshmen Nate
Downs and Sean Doolan. At the
alumni meet, Downs performed a
solid parallel bars routine, and
Doolan turned in an excellent floor
exercise, dismounting with a two
and-a-half twisting front flip.
The Cardinal Open is tomorrow
at 7:00 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
As Stanford's largest annual meet,
the house is usually packed for the
collegiate competition.
"I'm just looking forward to
throwing some big skills in front of a
large crowd," O'Leary said.

Cade Raggio, who is one of several Cardinal gymnasts expected to give Stanford 10.0 routines on the pommel horse
this year, is one of four seniors on this year's squad under first-year coach Thorn Glielmi.
