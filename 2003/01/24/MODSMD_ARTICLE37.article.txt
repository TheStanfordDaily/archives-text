# 'Hours' deftly weaves 'Dalloway' narratives

### RAMIN SETOODEH 
Let's start with some superlatives.
"The Hours" is sensational. It is a
work of film that is literary and literate,
beautifully mounted by director
Stephen Daldry ("Billy Eliot"), skillful
ly edited by Peter Boyle, and with one
of the best cinematic scores of all time
from Philip Glass.
It might not have turned out this
way. The novel, a Pulitzer Prize winner

from Michael Cunningham
(a Stanford graduate), is r
comprised of dense inter- \
rial narratives. The work is
bold and imaginative, one
of the great modern books
that yon could read, and
yet, it intentionally opposes
theatricality.

pie could have been happier than
we've been," one character tells anoth
er. It's the only melodramatic line of di
alogue that Cunningham writes. And
he doesn't even write it himself: The
words are lifted from Virginia Woolfs
suicide note to her husband in 1941.
Fortunately, the screenplay by
David Hare translates magnificently
on screen. Some details have been
changed, others removed, but the
spirit of Cunningham's novel has been
captured.
Hare, a theater veteran, has a
strongpoint for writing intelligent

women. He also wrote "Breath of
Life," which is now playing in London
with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.
In"The Hours," he does what he has
done on stage — create women who
grapple with the meaning of life, who
resist to be defined by the men who sur
round them. The movie, like the novel,
tells three separate narratives.
The first story takes places in a Lon
don suburb. It is 1923, and Virginia

Woolf (Nicole Kidman)
has started writing her

masterpiece, "Mrs. Dal

loway" — a novel that
takes place in a day, about
a woman planning a
party. Virginia's husband
Leonard (Stephen Dil
lane) fears she is going in
sane, and a visit from her
sister (Miranda Richard

son) does little to help the situation.
The second story takes place in Los
Angeles. It is 1949, and Laura Brown
(Julianne Moore) is reading "Mrs. Dal
loway" when she should be planning a
birthday party for her husband (John
C. Reilly). She is depressed, and alone
with her young son Richie (Jack Rovel
lo) when she receives an unexpected
visit from a neighbor (Toni Collette).
And the final story takes place in
New York City. It is 2001, and Clarissa
Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a
party fora friend dying of AIDS named
Richard (Ed Harris) — who has re-

named her Mrs. Dalloway.
Much has been made of the pros
thetic nose Nicole Kidman wears to
play Woolf. But not enough can be
said about the actress, who inhabits
the role with a skin-and-bones perfor
mance that is phenomenal. With an
aristocratic British accent and two
beads for eyes, she plunges into the
material with a courage (and a des
perate hunger) that no other living ac
tress could match.
Julianne Moore is also exceptional.
The last time anyone played a literary
role with such grace and control was in
1962, when Gregory Peck starred as
Atticus Finch in "To Rill a Mocking
bird." Her scenes are the most effective
of the film, and the young Rovello
plays her son with surprising sincerity.
If "The Hours" has a flaw, it's in the
staging of the modern-day story line.
Meryl Streep — the goddess of oper
atic acting — never gels into her role
as well as her co-stars do. Her inten
tions are only adequately explicated.
And her scenes with Ed Harris creak
when they should coast.
But masterpieces are allowed their
occasional weaknesses.
"I wanted to create something alive
and shocking enough that it could
stand beside a morning in somebody's
life," Richard says in Cunningham's
novel. In"The Hours," we have wit
nessed that creation — and it is extra
ordinary.


Who's afraid of Virignia Woolf's beak-like schnozz?
