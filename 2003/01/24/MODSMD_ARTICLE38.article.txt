# '25th Hour’ confronts the post-9/11 American experience
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
The trailers and press synopses say that
"25th Hour" is Spike Lee's film about a
man spending his last hours before going
to prison for seven years. But if you know
anything about Spike Lee, that's hard to

believe. In reality,

"25th Hour" is

as much a story about a man's last day as
his seminal "Do The Right Thing" is a
story about a black kid delivering pizza in.
Brooklyn.
The film is framed around Monty
(played by Edward Norton), a convicted
drug dealer, who is just hours away from
a seven-year maximum security prison
sentence, courtesy of New York's Rocke

feller Law. He will spend his remaining

day saying his good-byes — to

his father (Brian Cox), girl

friend Naturelle

(Rosario Dawson)

and childhood

buddies
Frank

(Barry I'epper), a Wall Street trader

and Jakob (Philip Seymour
Hoffman), an English
teacher at a private Man
hattan prep school.
This alone might have
made for an interesting
story, but it becomes all the
more fascinating as the
movie takes the form of a
metaphor for the post-Sept.

25th Hour

★★★★★

11 America in which we all live — from
the opening nighttime sequence of
Ground Zero and the twin blue beams
piercing the sky to Brian Cox's beautiful
concluding monologue. That said, both

Lee ana 111s cast expertly commu
nicate the muddled moral ques
tions we face in our modern world.
On one hand, we have a father
who took his son's money to save
his Staten Island bar. Likewise, Na
turelle lives comfortably in Monty's
apartment without questioning
where the wealth around her
comes from, and Frank agonizes
over his refusal to say anything to
his friend about the dangerous life
he embarked upon. And on top of
all of this, a tantalizing question
lingers. Who reported Monty to
the DEA?
Each performance is subtle, but
leaves the audience convinced of
the longstanding relationships be
tween the characters. Edward

Norton is the true master here,
though, allowing us to deeply

empathize with a drug dealer — a

man who, we are often remind
ed, lived off of the pain of oth
ers.
"25th Hour" is a film
about race, culture and "Amer
ican-ness," but all of the charac
ters except for Rosario Daw
son's are white. Though many

critics are openly hostile toward Lee be
cause of his frequent focus on people of
color, he should hopefully silence his de
tractors with his deftness in understand
ing and communicating an inclusive vi
sion of our new American experience.
Near the end, the Russian mafia boss
for whom Monty works gives him one
piece of advice for surviving in prison —
find the smallest man there and ruthlessly
beat him beyond recognition as a show of
force to others. Frank, in a conversation
with Jakob, says, quite truthfully, that
Monty has three choices —he can run
away, kill himself or go to prison.
As Monty's father drives him to prison,
he still has a decision to make. Should he
survive by horribly disfiguring the small
est person he sees? Or should he run
away, embrace the beauty and history of
the great nation around him and start a
new life? It's the first great question of the
21st century and this might be the centu
ry's first great film.
