# Killer B's: From Berlin to Bernstein to Bolcom
## 
### HART GILULA 
If" the United States needed
an Art Song Czar, I would ap
point pianist Stephen Blier
without hesitation. This past
Sunday, at San Francisco's Old
First Church, the San Francisco
Opera Center presented Blier
along with four current and
former Adler Fellows in a recital
entitled "Killer 'B's."
Blier, who played piano for
the entire recital (sometimes
joined by pianist Mark Morash
for four-hand arrangements),
also conceived of the recital's
concept, which centered the en
tire program around American
composers whose last names
begin with the letter B. While
this conceit allowed for the in
clusion of such outstanding
song composers as Samuel Bar
ber, Paul Bowles, Ernst Bacon
and Stanford alumnus William
Bolcom, it also made fora pro

gram too heavily loaded with
popular songs. These popular
songs ran the gamut from Irv
ing Berlin and Eubie Blake to
songs by The Bobs and The
Beach Boys.
Undoubtedly, these songs
were real crowd pleasers, but
they diluted the impact of the
program's most poignant pieces.
These few miniature master
works stood apart from the fre
quent vaudevillian show pieces.
The occasional appearance
of excellent poets like Dickin
son, Tennessee Williams and

Theodore Roethke really high
lighted the overall lack of
stronger poetry on the pro
gram. There were too many of
Bolcom's cute theater songs,
which, while skillfully com
posed, do not match the depth
of his American poetry settings.
While it may seem uncharac
teristic to have gone this far in a
song recital review, with little
mention of the singers, this was a
content driven program, not a
star vehicle for the performers.
Blier conceived of the recital, in
terjected pithy commentary be
tween sets, and, of course,
played with great sensitivity.
This is a pianist who is very clear
ly aware of the song texts while
always dividing his attentions be
tween the singers and the piano
part. He and co-founder
Michael Barrett have estab
lished what might be the most
successful institution devoted to
Art Song in the U.S.: "The New

York Festival of Song."
While NYFOS usually uses
professional singers for its
recitals, the singers at this
recital were current and for
mer members of San Francisco
Opera Center's prestigious
Adler Fellow program. The
singers were soprano Saundra
DeAthos, mezzo Katherine
Rohrer, tenor Todd Geer and
baritone Hugh Russell. All
four were finely polished
though they never quite tran
scended their "Emerging
Artist" status.
While it was difficult to deter
mine whether any of them had
the star potential of now famous,
former Adler Fellows like Debo
rah Voigt and Ruth Ann Swen
son, they all held their audi
ence's attention for the duration
of the program. DeAthos is a
lyric soprano with very consis
tent technique and coquettish
stage persona. Rohrer has a dis

tinct mezzo allure but never had
the opportunity to show off her
vocal goods. Geer's voice peters
out in his lower range, but he
handled the difficult Robert
Beaser song very well. Russell
has an engaging stage presence
and fine lyric baritone but his
sound often lost its natural spin.
The program was a strong
testament to the accessibility of
an almost all-English language
program (there was a Bernstein
song with Spanish text) with the
audience responding in all of
the appropriate places. J udging
by the crowd's enthusiastic in
volvement, this was perhaps the
most important measure of the
recital's success.

The next Schwabaclier Debut Recital
will feature soprano Shannon Metre)
and mezzo Katherine Rohrer on Sun
day, Feb. 16 at 5:30. Tickets are $25.
