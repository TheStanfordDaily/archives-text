# Law prof Lessig dismayed by Supreme Court defeat
## Lessig argued the constitutionality of the latest copyright law extention 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
On Jan. 15, the Supreme Court de
cided 7-2 to uphold the Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act of
1998, much to the disappointment
and dismay of Stanford Law Prof.

Lawrence Lessig and his team of
lawyers. In Eldred v. United States,
Lessig represented the plaintiffs, argu
ing that the latest extension to copy
right law was unconstitutional.
Also known as the Mickey Mouse
Protection Act, this law retroactively
extended the duration of copyright
from the life of the author plus 50
years to the life of the author plus 70
years in the case of individual works.
For corporate authorship and any
thing published before Jan. 1, 1978,
the act extended copyright protection

from 75 to 95 years.
"The copyright law as it stands can
both promote and hamper creativity,"
said Lessig, in an interview with The
Daily. "But in the case of this copyright
extension, you're not increasing cre
ativity, you're promoting the posses
sion of this material.
"Nobody doubts that a well-func
tioning system of copyright, with all of
the correct dimensions to advance cre
ativity and protect creators would
work .... but what we have right now
is a terrible law."

Lessig said he was frustrated main
ly with the court's avoidance of his
team's core contention — that the
Copyright Term Extension Act ex
ceeded the power of Congress under
the Copyright Clause, which was orig
inally intended to motivate the cre
ation of new works by protecting them
under copyright laws.
In recent cases regarding the Com
merce Clause, which allows Congress
to regulate commerce with foreign na-
tions and among states, the cur
rent court has acted to limit Con
gress' ability to create laws under
the clause. In Eldred v. United
States, however, the "conservative
five" — Chief Justice Rehnquist
and Justices Scalia, Kennedy,
Thomas and O'Connor —
bucked the trend and allowed
Congress to extend copyright
terms once again.
"The past history of Justice
Ginsburg has been to act very,
very deferential to Congress, so
we were not surprised by her
opinion," said Lessig. "The frus
trating part about this case was
that the five that had limited the
[Commerce] Clause in the past
said nothing about limiting Con
gress' power when applied to the
Copyright Clause."
Both clauses are located within
the congressional powers enu
merated in Article I, Section 8 of
the Constitution, and many be
lieve that they should be held
under the same scrutiny.
"This [inconsistency] was the
most frustrating part of the case,"
he said. "It was like 'Hamlet' with
out a prince. Our core argument
was that the court had failed to
rule consistently within the con
text of the Commerce Clause.
They simply didn't apply the
precedents to the Copyright
Clause and didn't even consider
this argument."
The court rejected this argu
ment on the basis that, beginning
with the first copyright statute in
1790, "[hjistory reveals an unbro
ken congressional practice of
granting to authors of works with
existing copyrights the benefit of
term extensions so that all under
copyright protection will be gov
erned evenhandedly under the
same regime."
The court also argued that the
copyright laws would protect

American works in Europe, and
would "avoid competitive disad
vantages vis a vis foreign rightsh
olders."
Lessig adamantly opposed this
reasoning, arguing that the cur
rent act does nothing to promote
harmonization between America
and Europe's copyright laws.
"The Bono Act did nothing to
make these two systems equal," he
said. "The United States tried to
make the regulations equal in '76,
but we still have a radically differ
ent system. I'm all for harmoniz
ing ... we could all adopt Eu
rope's laws it we wanted. But as it
stands, the latest addition to the
Bono Act did nothing to make
these laws harmonious."
Lessig and his team also ar
gued that the act violates the First
Amendment. While the govern
ment can restrict the distribution
and access of free speech when
there is a compelling national in
terest to do so, Lessig contended
that this act does provide such an
interest.
However, the court ruled that
"copyright's limited monopolies
are compatible with free speech
principles."
Therefore, "when . . . Con
gress has not altered the tradi
tional contours of copyright pro
tection, further First Amendment
scrutiny is unnecessary."
Back at Stanford, Lessig is cur
rently busy teaching classes and
keeping up with e-mails and
phone calls from supporters of his
cause. He plans to offer a no-cred
it course in which he will teach
legal strategies to expand the
public domain. The public do
main includes literature, art and
film works that are available to the
public without copyright royal
ties.
"The results of the case make
the urgency for promoting cre
ativity and expanding the public
domain much more real," he said.
"We desperately need energy and
insight into these matters."
"We are very eager to build up

a team of dedicated and creative
students who will continue this
work. Now we must find creative
ways to use the copyright law to
put more works into the public
domain — it's important that that
the law not get in the way of this
cause," he added.
Lessig will also continue updat
ing his Web log, or "blog," where
he documented the progress and
developments of the Eldred case
during the trial.
"Writing in the blog was a very
strange and weird experience —
for one thing, you don't control
the audience, and it felt strange to
think that anyone could simply
read anything I wrote about the
case ... 1 almost felt like it was an
invasion of privacy," he said.
"At the same time, it was a way
to get people to think about these
issues and I got an overwhelming
response .... I got about l,oooe
mail responses after the case."
Law student Alex Diaz is one of
the many dismayed with the deci
sion of the court.
"Lessig has a very convincing

point about copyright: that a vi
brant public domain is the goal of
copyright law, and that we have
been straying dangerously away
from this goal," Diaz said.
"By extending new and exist
ing copyrights indefinitely, we
have kept virtually all new works
since 1923 from entering the pub
lic domain," he said.
Diaz, along with many who are
adamant about the creation and
expansion of the public domain,
sees this last extension as detri
mental to current and future gen
erations.
"Sure, it's 'legal' by the letter of
the law —at any given moment,
there is a finite horizon of protec
tion," he continued. "But the ef
fect of continued extension is to
keep the public domain from
being replenished. This is devas
tating .... You and I will never
see a new work enter the public
domain for us to use freely. And as
copyright terms keep extending
indefinitely, perhaps to 'forever
minus a day,' neither might our
children or grandchildren."
