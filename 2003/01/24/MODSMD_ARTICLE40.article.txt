# Kangaroo Jacked

When I decided not to embark on any
Tahoe excursions last weekend, I pledged
to participate in something that would
make my ski-tripping / gambling friends
envious. On Friday, that activity present
ed itself in shining glory as my editors in
formed me that I had the opportunity to
review the highly touted film "Kangaroo
Jack." The very name sent thrills down
my spine. First there was"The Godfa-

ther,' then there was "Goodfellas,'

and now, in that long running -
tradition of excellent mob films: *
"Kangaroo Jack." It is truly rare
to see such an Oscar caliber film
this early in the year. The fol
lowing is the timeline of my stu
pendous "Kangaroo Jack" ex
perience.
9:25 p.m.: Realized the film

starts at 9:30 and decided it might be time
to leave.
9:50: Arrived at the megaplex with
friends Patrick and Olivia, and purchased
tickets — to my great surprise, the show
was not sold out.
9:55: Entered the theater after missing
first ten minutes.
9:56: Left theater to go sneak into "25th
Hour."
9:56: Just kidding. Never entered "Kan
garoo Jack." Headed straight to theater
showing "25th Hour."
9:59: Struck by a pang of guilt for mis
spending The Daily's dollar, made mental
note to obtain "Kangaroo Jack" review
from random child exiting theater.
12:30 a.m.: Remembered that Estella

Warren (hot chick from"The Planet of
the Apes") was in "Kangaroo Jack." While
exiting "25th hour," decided that I did
have a duty for The Daily and stopped to
view the last hour of a later showing of
"Kangaroo Jack."
12:31: Wondered what the hell had gone
on in the first half hour.
12:32: Realized it was irrelevant.
12:33: Watched with interest as Patrick
became increasingly impatient at seeing

Estella Warren fully clothed.
12:35: Gleefully witnessed
Patrick receive slap to back of
head from random mother
behind him for shouting
"take it all off."
12:42: Was privileged to see
highly original joke about M
kangaroo tranquilizer being
fired into the neck of a
human being. Turned in
surprise to see Olivia crack-

ing up like a mad bastard.
12:50: Watched with increasing horror as
Olivia laughed more and more at jokes
about a) crashing airplanes, b) licorice
eating, sunglasses-wearing kangaroos
and c) farting camels. Began thinking
about math homework.
12:51-1:15: Nothing happened.
1:15: Credits rolled. Cringed as Olivia
turned and said, "You know, this really
wasn't a bad movie."
1:16: Movie had gall to show outtakes,
which were actually the funniest part of
the film.
1:20: Took out frustration by writing note
to producer of film. Note to producer:
"Make outtakes the movie, and movie the
outtakes."


"Aaaah! I'm stuck in a crappy ass movie!"
