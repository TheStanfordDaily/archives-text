# Overpolished OK Go blows...us away!
## 
### ALICE KIM 
Here, from memory, is the chorus of OK
Go's first single "Get Over It": "Heeey! Get
get get get get over it." Even knowing that,
and only that, how could yon not love this
band? From OK Go's days as They Might Be
Giants tourmates (admittedly, not a shabby
place to start at ALL) to headlining gigs and
video rotation on MTV, they've always been
making smart, innocent pop.
OK Go is no Papa Roach or Limp Bizkit,
in that they don't work through memories of
a bad childhood, 01 middle school fatness, or
girls that hate you. They're all in good clean
fun; the band is so niche-perfect, harmonic
and well-scrubbed that you can almost see
echoes of the Orlando boy band they could
have been. Complete with handclaps,
oooohs and aaahs and cheesy/great key
board, OK Go's pop is fresh as a young
alpine barmaid and almost as sexy.
A few hours before OK Go played a show
at the nearby Icon nightclub, Intermission
co-editor Ryan Sands and I visited the venue
to interview lead singer and primary song
writer Damian Kulash, Jr. Ryan made sure I
didn't ask anything embarrassing, such as,
"How did you decide how many 'gets' to put
in that song?" Damian cut an imposing fig
ure, being about 10 feet tall, thin and walk
ing with a cane and a cast on his leg. He also
had the same haircut as Ryan.
INTERMISSION: You're getting a lot more
fans now, especially female fans. On the mes
sage board at the band Web site, there was a
fan who went by the name "1 Stalk Damian."
What is it like dealing with the attention?
OK GO: The Web site, and the message
board in particular, tends to attract girls. I
don't know why. We have a lot of female
fans, and part of it is because we toured with
Phantom Planet recently, and all of their
fans are girls. And you know, whatever,
we're young-ish boys and girls like boys. But
I haven't had any problems. We've had
some sort of crazy fans but about as many of
them have been awesome as not awesome.
Last week, in Seattle, a couple, maybe 40
or 50, drove from Anchorage, .Alaska to see
us in Seattle. So that's pretty great. The peo
ple who like us enough to go see our shows
are usually people we kind of like. There's
been a couple people who think sort of
"Well, I've been to the last four shows; I'm
entitled to hang out with you all the time."
That can be annoying.
But for the most part, we're usually just
as fascinated by the people who like us as
they are by us. One, they're kind of crazy.
Two, the whole situation is crazy. I mean,
the thing I was just writing when you guys
were coming in was something fora Japan
ese magazine, in the form of a letter to peo
ple who want to apply for the job of travel
ing rock singer. You would not believe how
much stuff we are entitled to do, just be
cause we have some okay songs, and even
better than okay, maybe? You kind of get to
do everything, like I get to design stuff, I
get to shoot movies, I get to write for mag
azines. How much fun is that? The general
sort of liberal-artsy fartsy stuff to do, I get to
do them all now. I'm most greatly indebted
and sort of wildly fascinated by the sort of
people who make it all possible for me.

[Pause.] Did you actually say "I Stalk
Damien" was one of their names?
INTERMISSION: Yeah.
OK GO: Wow. Maybe I should watch out.
INTERMISSION: What other bands be
sides They Might Be Giants have you toured
with?
OK GO: We've toured with them a bunch,
toured with Phantom Planet, who I can't say
enough good things about as well; those
guys are so, so talented. They're such a good
band. Their level of energy onstage is just
fucking atomic. We toured with the Vines.
INTERMISSION: That guy Craig [lead

singer of the Vines]? Is he as fucked up as
he's supposed to be?

OK GO: Yeah, everyone asks me this, Yeah,
he's as fucked up as he's supposed to be.
Honestly, I worry about him, and this is the
sort of thing I'm sure I'm not supposed to
say in interviews, but it's a sad thing when it's
someone's marketing schtick â€” he's not
conscious enough of it.
At first, we thought, "God, that guy puts
on such a show of being so fucked up." But
he's not doing it to promote himself. But
every piece on them is about, "Oh my God,
this guy is probably going to commit suicide
soon." That's just not a good idea. He
shouldn't be indulged, and he shouldn't be
led on. He is a wonderful guy, a really really
nice guy, but he is off the deep end. They're
young; when we first saw them play, it was
their tilth show ever. I think that as long as
[Craig's] able to keep from totally self-de
structing, they'll be a great band.

A lot happened to them really fast. The
British press is extremely effective and ex
tremely ruthless. For two or three months
they love something, and then they spit it out
the backside. It is great for people's careers
in the sense that you can be in a garage one
day, and sell two million records the next, in
a way that never happens in America. It's a
star system that's unbelievable. But most
American bands, even the ones people think
of as being pretty manufactured, are years
into their careers by the time anyone's ever
heard of them.
People definitely think that because we
never put out any major indie records, we're
out of nowhere. But we've played hundreds
of shows, in 32 states, something like that.
The Vines, or any of the bands that go
through that, get caught. If we had to put

out our record after 10 shows, we would
fucking suck. We were terrible then.
INTERMISSION: You mentioned that you
were writing fora Japanese magazine, and I
was wondering if the Japanese love you.
OK GO: They do, as far as I can tell. Obvi
ously, I usually only hear from people who
are pro-us. It's not like our detractors call us
up to tell us they hate us. The record is doing
pretty well. Since the record came out in
Japan, we've had a ton of people. .Almost
every show, there's two or three Japanese
kids. You're like, "Why are you in Min
neapolis?" And last night, they gave me this
beautiful keychain, these twojapanese girls.
They bought little keychains for all of us, like
different ones for each member of the band.
They apparently Hew from Japan to see our
show in Seattle. Same night that these two
people drove from Anchorage, Alaska.
It's weird. But the thing is, it's kind of not.

It's weird if I thought it was actually me, but
if you fall in love with a band, it's like some
thing so much more than any member of that
band. I was a mega-fan, I still am a mega-fan;
I saw Shudder To Think 12 times in a year
once. To [fans], we're not just some guys who
just make rock music and travel around. Es
pecially if you are several continents away
and you have this new record, and none of
your other friends have it or whatever, it be
comes your fucking thing, you know?
INTERMISSION: We've heard about your
stage show, which is supposed to include
rapping, choreographed boy-band dancing
and scenes from "Les Miserables." Do you
do that for most shows?
OK GO: Most people are predisposed to
hate whoever's on stage for one reason or
another. With first-time listeners, unless you
really, really love an album or something like
that, at least half of the audience is going to
be like, "I'm just here with a pal." So when
it's new crowds like that, then we just try to
keep it more straight music, because I know
that if I walked into a show, and saw a bunch
of annoying self-important kids like us try
ing to rap, I would just be like, "Dude, that's
so lame." But if it was a band that I really
liked, and I saw them sort of making fools
out of themselves, then I would like it. So,
the antics come out more when we're play
ing to our crowd. Which have been greatly
diminished by my cast, unfortunately.
INTERMISSION: Is your ankle broken, or
just sprained?
OK GO: It is broken, yeah.
INTERMISSION: You know that Justin
Timberlake just broke his ankle, right?
OK GO: Yeah. It was obviously such a copy
cat move. 1 broke my leg two days before
that, and then that shitbag just has to get all
INTERMISSION: His was mentioned on
MTV.com.
OK GO: Exactly. And then mine's not! You
see what I'm saying? He's totally trying to
overshadow my glory all of the time. And of
course, he's in a wheelchair. I'm getting by
with a fucking cane. Toughen up, J.T.!
During the latter part of the interview,
which was conducted outside of the Icon, a
group of Asian girls came up to us. They
asked Damian if he is in OK GO, and he in
troduced himself. This is what happened.
GIRL: (Giggling) We already know who you
are.
DAMIAN: Oh. Well, thank you.
ANGEL: Hi, I'm Angel [to Ryan.]
RYAN: Oh, I'm interviewing Damian.
ANGEL: Oh, okay.
RYAN: Nice to meet you.
Damian autographs some things for them.
ANGEL: Where's everyone else?
DAMIAN: Oh, they're inside. We're sup
posed to be sound-checking.
ANGEL: Who's her? [To me.]


Damian didn't know it yet, but the leg he held would soon be BROKEN!
