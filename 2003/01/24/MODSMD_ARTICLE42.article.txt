# Another Detroit garage rock gem

People travel the world with an insatiable
thirst for the sights. On one hand, we are en
thralled with experiencing the old and cultural
ly relevant. See: slouchy Italian towers. See also:

acs. On the other hand, the new and gaudy
can also serve as "the sights," drawing
throngs that seek the Zeitgeist. See: the lat

est, biggest shiny object in Vegas. It's only

appropriate then, that a band called The

vi 1 7 -
Sights sit at the crossroads of vintage rock and
the up-and-coming garage rock scene. The
Sights were on target with their previous release
"Are You Green?" and have set their aim much
higher with their latest album "Got What We
Want."
These days it's OK to be suspicious about a
Detroit garage rock band whose name is molded
to the popular "The Nouns" template. Sounds
like a simple thrown-together outfit designed to
piggyback on the trendiness and commercial
success of the heroic garage bands who "saved
rock and roll." See: Detroit sibling divorcees The
White Stripes. See also: The $4,000 it cost to
record the Stripes' million-dollar album "White
Blood Cells." However, a glance at The Sights'
resume verifies that they've done their time in
the hallowed garage of rock. Frontman Eddie
Baranek and oassist Mark Leahey have been
jamming since they were 13, and officially
formed The Sights at DeLaSalle High in Detroit.
But where you see bored teenagers, you'll
find any number of so-called garage get-ups.
Right. But The Sights' rock revivalism is more
than just denim and destruction. What sets

them apart is their ability to channel the spirit
and the sound of their wonderful rock influ
ences. "Got What We Want" schools us in what
was so great about the screaming '60s and sweat
drenched '70s in rock 'n' roll. This record is
somewhere between rock-resurrection seance

Got What We Want

and nostalgic clip
show.
Seance, because
these kids are barely
old enough to re
member vinyl, so it

must be something
supernatural that allows Baranek and Leahey to
be possessed by the fierce-fun spirit of the Kinks'
Davies brothers. Clip show because every track is
like a stop on the guided tour through chief rock
bands in the '60s and '70s. Now departing the
bluesy Zeppelin tribute with Jagger shrillness.
Next stop, the intersection of The Who and Su
pergrass, with a Hammond organ twist. Maybe a
kickin" progressive down the hall of good rock is
a better visual. A highlight on the historic rock
tour is track four, "It'd Be Nice to Have You
Around." This track has a highlight feel-good
hook that pulls you in, reminiscent of Beach
Boys' "Pet Sounds." With the free-wheeling gui
tar solos and howling on the final track, "No
body," is "Houses of trie Holy" with some resid
ual angst left over from the band's grunge child
hood.
For those who feel that there hasn't been a
good rock record in 20 years, The Sights offer a
rekindling of the old spirit. For those who spend
hours trying to look like a glamorous train wreck
a la garage-rock-revival, nere is your next big
thing.
