# The

### KARAN MAHAJAN 
Every morning, I wake up to the slip-shod elegance of The
Strokes, gift-wrapped in corauroy and pasted on the far side of
my wall. I recall the glib-talk of Julian Casablancas and the tired
jerk of glitzy guitars.
It's only then that I realize that this has been a big sham. The
Strokes were hailed not for their inherent genius, but for creating
a leeway for their more stunted siblings — the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
The Walkmen, The Raveonettes — garage-rockers who'd been
nurturing their Vitamin D deficiencies for far too long and need
ed to see the light. With algae-green hair, badly bandaged sounds
and egregious eccentricities, these were bands that got you excit
ed about rock 'n' roll all over again.
Some of it was well-marketed bullshit. Some of it was the alco
hol. The Liars, however, are worthy of all my spent words:
They're groovy NYC punk rockers wno mask their talent with a
well rehearsed drunkenness; their keen ear for dance rhythms is

matched only by a love for grating noise. And to top it all, they're out to prove
that rock 'n' roll is the populist junky art form it always claimed to lie.

All through their wonderfully titled debut

froths at the mouth and spits like a man pos-'
sessed. The songs bounce out one-by-one like

bits of charred toast smeared with heavy layers of

guitar funk, synthetic keypads, voice modulation and drum machines. The
foreground is predominantly eerie and mechanical, lending the music its
menacing vibe.

At the outset, one might fall in love with songs by simply pe
rusing their titles: "Grown Men Don't Fall Into a River, Just
Like That," "Nothing Is Ever Lost or Can Be Lost My Science
Friend" and so forth. The best song on the album — "Mr. Your

on Fire Mr." — unwinds from a start-stop sequence into a full-blood
ed booty-shaker. On "Loose Nuts on the Velandrome," meanwhile, the Liars
flaunt inanities ("Last night you and I / we gathered berries with a Hash
light") and masterfully replicate the sound of a marching army of buffoons.
While the rest of the tracks are equally distinctive and daring, the final track
is a 30-minute band-made disaster — trie listener is left with a synth sequence
on repeat for 20 minutes, angry and alienated.
Why? That's part ofThe Liars' cubicle-crushing, corporation-flushing mes
sage. In fact, at this stage, The Liars are more concerned about carrying the
flag for their genre than they are about crafting "timeless" music. It's a minor
quip though — 1 haven't heard a band creating such pointlessly urgent music
in a while. I earnestly want to be up all night in an alcoholic stupor twisting
and turning to the fantabulous funk ofThe Liars.
And finally, when 1 wake up with a hangover, I want to move from one hype
to the next. But first, I'm going to reach across my desk and tear that Strokes
poster down.
