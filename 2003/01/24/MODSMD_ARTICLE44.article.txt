It's true — the shaggy corpse of rock and roll is alive and well,
staggering around London's East End in a glorious, sloppy delir
ium. Ahh, Libertines, let me sing thy praises.
Basically what we have here are two smart young lads named

Carl Barat and Pete Doherty, both of

whom can sing and play their asses
off. Think Paul McCartney and
John Lennon, Ray and Dave |
Davies, Joe Strummer and Mick
Jones or Johnny Marr and Stephen

The Libertines
Up The Bracket

#1 Stunner" Morrissey. Barat and

Doherty follow in these fine footsteps, the prodigal

sons in a veritable family tree of literate Brits paired
up to produce clever, energetic guitar music. 4
The following fictional account is meant to give

you some idea of what "Up the Bracket" sounds like: Johnny Marr
meets Joe Strummer in a London dive. They get as drunk as a couple
of czars and stumble over to the jukebox. Johnny plays a song by the
Jam; Joe picks some Supergrass. . . after three or four songs and a
dozen more drinks they look at each other, blurt out some unintelligi
ble British obscenities ("divvy," "poofter," and the like), and pass out.
Suddenly their bodies vanish and in their place stand Barat and Do
herty, coked up and decked out like The Strokes. Thus, like Athena
emerging fully formed from the head of Zeus, The Libertines arrived
on the scene.
Of course it wasn't actuallv like that — but hey, the) did get Mick Jones
from the Clash to produce trie damn album. And before it came out, they
did have an incredibly catchy single, "What a Waster," that contained a ref
erence to "the unabridged Ulysses" and the phrase "mind your bleedin'
own, you two-bob cunt' in the same song. And to top it off, they sound
even better live. Hype-heavy groups like The Hives and The Vines will be
revealed as the second-rate Stooges cover bands they really are when the

cheery glow of this album reaches their pallid, aging frames and
gets released on this side of the Atlantic. Even good old Radiohead,
who can usually do no wrong in my eyes, seem a little pretentious

and grandiose
next to The Lib
ertines.
In sum, this album
is the best British
rock debut since
Oasis dropped
"Definitely
Maybe," and it's
even sexier and

sloppier than The Strokes'
"IsThis It." In fact, theonly
album released last year
that even came close to
being as exciting as "Up
the Bracket" was Missy El
liott's "Under Construc
tion." There's a freshness,
an intelligence, and a sense
of fun to both — Missy and
Timbaland innovate in hip
hop while The Libertines
keep rock tight, and for the
length of a couple of al
bums, all is right with the
world.
