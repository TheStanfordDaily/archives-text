# Roxy comes clean on PDAs

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Depending on where you live, public displays of
lust and abandonment may be illegal. Is that the case
here in the Bay Area? Frankly, I wouldn't know.
Sure, Roxy has let love, sexual frustration and booze
get the best of her in the past, and sure, she has a
predilection for doing the private in public. But —
not to toot my own horn — I have never, ever been
caught.
See, the appeal of, for example, being fingered
in a crowdecl Caltrain car, is the possibility of get
ting caught. For all you know, the ticket man might
come by, and then your companion would have to
present his or her ticket with honey-covered
hands. And it stands to reason that the Caltrain
ticket man probably wouldn't be too thrilled with
the idea of punching a ticket dripping with love
nectar. In a best case scenario, you'd merely get a
glare from an angry public transportation employ
ee. The worst case? Finding yourselves stranded in
San Carlos.
For me, the trick to having sex in public is to
pick places where I could get caught, but likely
won't. For example, 1:30 at night, bent over a bike
rack outside the Stanford post office, getting the
royal tongue treatment from a guy in my statistics
study group.
Or, that time during finals week two years ago at
around midnight in the History Corner third floor
women's bathroom. There on the ground, I'm sure
we must've made Snoop Dogg proud. And while
we're talking about the History Corner, the same

week, I took a different friend to room 105. You
know, the one with the big oval seminar table? A
group of freshmen looking fora study place almost
ruined the academic atmosphere we had going in
there. Almost.
Of course, your other choice is to pick places
where you're likely to get caught, but unlikely to
meet any consequences. I once sat in the sixth row
of a Redwood City movie theater while watching
"Runaway Bride." Now, I know that the movie crit
icism here at Intermission is best left to others, but
Miss Julia wasn't exactly in best form. Luckily, I
don't remember much after the first 15 minutes as
my date opted to teach me a new meaning for the
term "chick flick."
A friend once told me about "The Chase," a
movie where a couple — as Grandma Sass says —
makes whoopee as the guy speeds away from po
lice on the freeway. This can't be done, I thought.
But one night, on the return trip from concert in
San Francisco, my imagination got the better of
me, and 1 made my move. I hiked up my skirt (not
that it needed much hiking), pulled my thong
aside and straddled my date as he looked over my
shoulder to avoid steering us into the center di
vide on 101.
I noticed several smiles from the drivers we
passed, and at least one Acura missed its exit for SFO.
Though I never really spoke much to that guy after
ward, you can imagine what a pleasant ride home
that was.
