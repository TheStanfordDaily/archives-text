# Film series displays stylized beauty of Japanese legend
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
When Americans think of Japanese
cinema, they usually picture a scene out
of an Akira Kurosawa epic: the archetyp
al close-up of a samurai posing menac
ingly, backed by frantic Taiko drums and
intelligible war cries. Though this paints
one aspect of Japanese film, another im
portant vision can be found in the re
markably stylized films of director Yasu
jiro Ozu. Ozu, who is renowned by many
critics as one of the five or six most im
portant directors of the 20th century, di

retted 60 films in his career, mostly fo
cusing on the domestic lives of middle
class Japanese families.
In the following weeks, the Stanford
Center for East Asian Studies is sponsor
ing a film series focusing on seven pic
tures made by O/.u in the last years of his
career, a period when the director
reached his creative peak and honed his
formal style of directing, which consisted
of static shots taken from a low angle,
similar to the viewpoint of a seated
Japanese adult. Ozu's films are those of a
true auteur, whose uncompromised ad-

herence to a simplistic style and formal
ism gives a depth which is rarely
matched in the works of other directors,
Japanese or otherwise. This depth and
attention to detail permeates Ozu's work
and makes him the perfect focus of a
chronological study.
Though Ozu's films are not often re
vived in the U.S., Stanford was able to bor
row 16 mm prints the featured films from
independent film distributor New Yorker
Films. These films will be presented with a
brief introduction by Asian Languages
Prof. Jim Reichert, who organized these

ries and is also teaching a seminar based
around the films that will be showing
throughout the next series weeks. All of
the films showing in the series are subti
tled and free to the public. If you have a
love for film, an interest in Japanese cul
ture or are looking for something differ
ent to do on those boring Thursday
evenings, check out the film series in Cub
berley Auditorium.
