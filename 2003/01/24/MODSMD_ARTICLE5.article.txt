## Hennessy issues statement reaffirming University's commitment to considering race in admissions 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a presentation to tlie Faculty Senate yesterday
afternoon, University President John Hennessy en
dorsed affirmative action. I lennessy's statement rep
resents the University's official response to the
Supreme Court case concerning (he University of
Michigan's use of race as a factor in admissions.
Hennessy announced that the University will col
laborate wilh other institutions and "participate in an
amicus brief before the Supreme Court."
"It is appropriate to reaffirm our commitment to
diversity," Hennessy said. "We remain committed to
affirmative action ... as a practical and appropriate
means to achieve such diversity."
Hennessy noted that the University places a high
value on preserving a diverse climate at Stanford, and
added that while race is considered in the admissions
process, "other factors play an important role."
The difference between Stanford University's ad
missions process and that of the University of Michi
gan is that Stanford's is not based on numerical scores
or methods.
"Our admissions are not formulaic," he said. "We
consider the whole person." The admissions office
looks at candidates' academic achievements, extracur
ricular activities and other factors, including race and
socioeconomic background.
John Bravman, vice provost of undergraduate ed
ucation, remarked that Stanford is being cited in na
tional publications as an example of how admissions
policies can fairly and beneficially incorporate race.
"We are showing that it can be done correctly," he
said.
Hennessy explained, "The statement is, at it
roots, about the education benefits of being a
diverse institution."
The Supreme Court's decision about affir
mative action could strongly impact the acade
mic community, and the Faculty Senate recog
nizes its potential significance.
"It would inevitably affect private as well as
public institutions Iwere race outlawed as a fac
tor in admissions]," Hennessy said.
The senate responded with resounding
support for the president's statement and for
Stanford's admissions policies in general.
Debra Satz, associate professor of philoso
phy, summed up the senate's sentiments by
calling Hennessy's press release "a very good
statement." After several more senate members
echoed commendation and praise for the pres
ident's statement, associate professor of politi
cal science Luis Fraga suggested a motion from
the senate as a whole to endorse the president's
statement.
The motion passed with unanimous sup
port.
The Supreme Court will 1 lear oral arguments
concerning the University of Michigan's admis
sions policies on April 1, with a final decision date
slated to come sometime in June or July.
In the meantime, President Hennessy
praised Stanford University's climate as a
model for other institutions.
"It's just incredibly diverse," he said with
a smile.
