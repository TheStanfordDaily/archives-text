## 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an attempt to facilitate dis
cussion and promote understand
ing about religious conflict and
mediation, Stanford will host a

multifaith conference entitled "Kx
ploring Religious Boundaries and
Conflicts" tomorrow. Held in con
junction with the centennial cele
bration of Memorial Church, the
one-day conference will explore
interfaith dialogue and the media

tion of conflicts among various re
ligious traditions.
"In the aftermath of Sept. 11,
2001, it seems more important
than ever to promote inter-reli
gious dialogue and understand
ing," said Dean of Religious Life
Scotty McLennan. "It also seems
critical to investigate why we have
so much religious conflict in the
world today."
An organizing committee —
made up of Assoc. Dean of Reli
gious Life Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior Sumir Meghani
and sophomore Anna Mumford —
lias been planning this conference
since summer and is optimistic
about its potential impact.
"We expect strong student par
ticipation," Meghani said. "The
events of the past two years espe
cially have created a demand for
this kind of program. We have


PATRICK WOOD/The Stanford Daily
worked with [Residential Educa
tion] to encourage dorms to send a
few representatives to the confer
ence who can take back what they
learn and share with their peers,"
he said.
The conference is sponsored by
the ASSU Forum on Contempo
rary Issues and many other groups
and offices, including the Stanford
Office for Religious Life and the
Office of the President.
Karlin-Neumann believes that
religious awareness is an impor
tant and necessary step toward tol
erance and acceptance.
"We know the usefulness of
addressing racial and ethnic dif
ferences," she said. "Many of our
identities are based on religious
differences as well, and including
religious difference and conflicts
in our understanding will enable

us to become better educated and
thoughtful citizens of the world,"
Karlin-Neumann added.
A diverse list of speakers are slat
ed to participate, including Rev.
Byron Bland; Political Science
Prof and Assoc. Director of the
Stanford Center on Conflict and
Negotiation James Fearon;
Iftekhar Mai, co-founder of the
United Muslims of America; and
Rev. Heng Sure, director of the
Berkeley Buddhist Monastery.
A Hindu-Christian relations
specialist and active participant in
the World Council of Churches,
Prof. Anantanand Rambachan of
St. Olaf College in Minnesota will
serve as the keynote speaker.
The event is scheduled to begin
with two panels, "Defining the
'Other' " and "Encountering the
'Other,' " and will conclude with a
musical performance by the a
capella group Talisman to com
memorate the centennial anniver
sary of the dedication of Memorial
Church.

"The closing will be in Memori
al Church, because it was built as a
non-sectarian Christian church,
informed by and embracing the
religions of the world," McLennan
said. "Stanford should be proud
that it was deeply involved in pro
moting inter-religious respect and
understanding 100 years ago
when that was not necessarily a
popular thing to be doing. Satur
day's conference continues that
tradition."
The conference will take place
from. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. tomorrow
in the basement of the History
Corner. The organizers encour
age students, faculty and local res
idents of all religious backgrounds
to attend.
"It is our hope that through this
forum, in which members of dif
ferent religious communities come
together in dialogue, we will begin
an exploration in which we will to
gether grow closer to truth, In jus
tice and to peace," Karlin-Neu
mann said.
