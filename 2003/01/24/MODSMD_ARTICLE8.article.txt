# Winter rainfall completes Lake Lag's transformation ...
## From a ditch to an oasis 
### JESSICA WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Returning to campus after winter break, Stan
ford students were surprised to discover that Lake
Lagunita had actually become a lake.
As one freshman wryly commented, "I think (he
name 'Lake Lagunita' is a misnomer — it should be
called 'a huge dry ditch that fills up with some water
after it rains a lot.' "
Lake Lagunita is usually dry for six to eight
months during the year until the wet season. Win
ter rains and diverted water from nearby San Fran
cisquito Creek have historically filled the irrigation

reservoir in time for spring quarter.
In the past, to maintain the lake levels for spring
quarter classes such as the windsurfing lessons of
fered by the Department of Athletics, the lake had
to be filled at a rate of 500 gallons per minute.
The traditional autumn Big Game Bonfire used
to be held in the middle of Lake Lagunita when it
was dry, but it was recently moved to a location near
Stanford Stadium in an effort to preserve the
lakebed as a breeding ground for the threatened
California tiger salamander.
For the past few years, Lake Lagunita has usual-
ly been filled in time for spring
quarter. Rainfall levels in the area
were low last year, however, and
the lake never filled up with a suf
ficient amount of water. The Uni
versity decided not to pump
water into the lake, given that it
would take too much water to fill
the lake completely.
Contrary to the popular stu
dent urban legend that the lack
of lake water is in some way relat
ed to the protection of the tiger
salamanders, whether or not the
lake will be filled in a given year
is based solely on the amount of
rainfall. Last year, Athletics De
partment classes, such as wind
surfing, were held on Felt Lake
instead of Lake Lagunita.

Tom Zigterman of the Stan
ford Grounds Services Water
Department said, "Our policy is
to retain all runoff into the lake,
and not drain it, and till it from
creek diversions only if we've
had a wet enough winter to fill
Felt Lake."
Thus the fate of the Athletics
Department's spring quarter
classes this year relies solely on
the levels of rainwater this year.
Not to worry, though — classes
will be offered regardless of the
unpredictable rain.
Thomas Loverro, president of
the Stanford Windsurfing and
Kitesurfing Club, elaborated:
"We are undecided whether we
are going to be back at our tradi
tional home of Lake Lagunita or
Felt Lake, where lessons were
held last year," Loverro said. "A
number of factors will affect our
decision, but the main determi

nant is water quality — depth,
cleanliness and clarity. One thing
is for sure though: We will be of
fering classes on campus."
Some students are not waiting
for spring quarter to put the new
and improved water-filled lake to
good use. Freshman Mia Lee,
along with some of her class
mates, said she believes there is
no point in waiting to use the
lake.
"My friends and I took advan
tage of the lake the first night we
got back from vacation by going
midnight rafting," she said.
Residents in Lagunita Court
are especially excited about the
water in the lake, which is practi
cally in their backyard. Freshman
Alex Rivas of Granada said, "I
think it is incredible to be able to
step out onto the balcony and see
the moon's reflection in the water
at night."
