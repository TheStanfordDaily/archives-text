## U.N. speech criticizes Iraq's secrecy 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
U.N. weapons inspectors have
prepared toughly worded assess
ments that criticize much of Iraq's
performance over the past two
months but won't be able to con
firm claims by the Bush adminis
tration that Saddam Hussein is
rearming, U.N. officials said.
The reports by Hans Blix and
Mohamed Elßaradei, to be deliv
ered as speeches to the Security
Council today at 10:30 a.m. EST,
will be key to Washington's efforts
to bolster international support for
a war on Iraq and to efforts by
skeptics to avert one.
Blix, a 74-year-old Swede with
decades of experience in the field
of disarmament, will address the
open council meeting first, fie
spent much of the weekend per
sonally writing his l(i-page report
which will deal with Iraq's failure
to address key questions on the
fate of chemical and biological
agents such as VX and anthrax
that it succeeded in weaponizing

on the eve of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
"112 have been working very hard
and very carefully on the details,"
Blix told flie Associated Press.
His staff said the speech would
be stronger than originally antici
pated because the Iraqis have failed
to be forthcoming about informa
tion long sought by inspectors.
Despite assurances from Iraq
that it would encourage its scien
tists to submit to private inter
views, no such interviews have
taken place and Baghdad contin
ues to block inspectors from using
a U-2 reconnaissance plane that
could be helpful in the hunt for
weapons of mass destruction.
In addition, U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Com
mission teams found thousands of
pertinent documents hidden in the
home of an Iraqi scientist, at least
1 (i empty and undeclared chemical
warheads and illegally imported
parts for its missile program.
Elßaradei, director of the Inter

national Atomic Energy Agency,
has prepared a 20-page report in
which he intends to make the case
for continued inspections.
"We're just in mid-course and
we still need to exhaust tfie option
of inspections before we think of
any alternatives," Elßaradei told
AP yesterday. "We still need more
time and that depends obviously
on fiow intensive our work is and
fiow cooperative Iraq is."
The administration, convinced
that Iraq has already failed to meet
its obligations in Security Council
Resolution 1441, drafted by Wash
ington and adopted in November,
is playing close attention to the
speeches.
U.S. Ambassador John Negro
ponte is expected to respond to the
reports once today's session moves
behind closed-doors. An adminis
tration official, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said the am
bassador would focus more on
Iraq's obligations than on the in
spectors' findings.
