SHANGHAI, China (AP) — Police in
western China have executed a Tibetan
fora string of bomb attacks in support of
Tibetan independence, despite an inter
national outcry over the fairness of his
trial.
Lobsang Dhondup, 28, was executed
yesterday afternoon in Ganzi, a city near
the Tibetan border in Sichuan
province, immediately after a court up
held his original death sentence, an offi
cial at Ganzi Intermediate People's

Court said today. She refused to give
her name.
The Sichuan Provincial High Peo
ple's Court also rejected an appeal by
Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, a 52-year-old
senior Buddhist monk, and affirmed his
suspended death sentence, the official
said. A suspended sentence is usually
commuted to life in prison.
The two men were convicted in De
cember of seeking independence for
Tibet and involvement in a series of

bombings that killed one person.
While only Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche
filed an appeal, the court affirmed the
sentences of both men yesterday, the offi
cial Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.
The case has raised protests among Ti
betan activists and the U.S. government.
The top U.S. human rights official
raised the men's cases during talks last
month in Beijing. Assistant Secretary of
State Lome Craner expressed "deep con
cern" about the severity of the sentences

and the possible lack of a fair trial.
China has angrily rejected such ap
peals as interference in its internal affairs.
Militants opposed to Chinese control
of Tibet have carried out at least eight
bomb attacks in the Himalayan region
since the mid-19905. Communist troops
marched into the region in 1950, and
Beijing says it has been part of China for
centuries.
The Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in
1959 during a failed uprising against

communist rule, has urged Tibetans to
avoid violence, but some want more di
rect action.
Activists describe Tenzin Deleg Rin
poche as a community leader in Sichuan,
which abuts Tibet and has a large ethnic
Tibetan population.
The court official in Ganzi refused to
tell how Lobsang Dhondup's execution
was carried out, but China's usual
method is by gunshot to the back of the
head.
