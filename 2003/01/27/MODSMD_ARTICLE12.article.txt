## The
						Stanford Daily Stanford exemplifies reason to support Michigan's case

Published Since 1891

As the Supreme Court logins to debate
the constitutionality of racial prefer
ence in the University of Michigan's
admissions policy, universities
throughout the country face the threat of com
promising elements of diversity that contribute
to college communities. We stand by affirmative
action as a measure for achieving racial diversity
and hope that the Supreme Court justices will
support this view when making their decision.
The Stanford admissions process hits been
praised for bcx)sting diversity by its method of
evaluating the "whole person" behind even' ap
plication. While opponents of the University of
Michigan's admissions policies have labeled them
as quotas, they essentially employ a system similar
to that used by Stanford. First, Michigan has l>een
accused of setting loose percentage goals for spe
cific ethnic groups. However, setting goals does
not compromise the quality of candidates or re
quire a certain number of minorities to Ix? admit
ted. Whether or not Stanford's Office of Admis-

sions formally sets such goals, they have similarly
expressed desires to increase student diversity.
Also, the University of Michigan uses a nu
merical point system whereby minority candi
dates receive points for their minority status.
While Stanford does not use such a numerical
system, race is still perceived as a strength when
it adds to the candidate as a "whole person." The
University of Michigan has been criticized for
formalizing many of the practices that Stanford
has informally employed with success.
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice,
a former Stanford provost, has publicly ex
pressed support for consideration of race in col
lege admissions. Further, University President
John Hennessy recently released a statement
reaffirming the University's commitment to af
firmative action policies. W 7 hile President
Bush's statements against Michigan's policies
imply that the "whole person" can be examined
without considering race, those who have con
tributed to Stanford's success suggest the oppo

site: that consideration of race cannot be ne
glected when attempting to diversify universi
ties.
At Stanford, it is easy to take for granted the
benefits of racial diversity. While the University
still has room for improvement regarding diver
sity, students generally benefit from the assorted
backgrounds and experiences of professors and
classmates. Whether in a classroom or ethnic
community center, students are constantly given
the opportunity to learn from others with varied
backgrounds. Such diversity prepares students
for basic participation and leadership in a di
verse society. Many cases have shown that by fail
ing to consider race in admissions, universities
decrease the student body's diversity.
Since the court's decision to hear the case,
Stanford student groups have called meetings
to mobilize efforts in support of the Universi
ty of Michigan. The Stanford administration
has formally voiced support for its affirmative
action practices and plans to file an amicus

brief in the case. We applaud students and ad
ministration for recognizing the importance
of this case and redirecting the spotlight of di
versity success toward the consideration of
race in admissions.
The conservative Supreme Court majority is
predicted to rule Michigan's current admissions
policies as unconstitutional. Even a narrowly tai
lored Michigan-specific ruling can have a ripple
effect on other colleges and universities. If race
is not considered in higher education admis
sions, then non-minority students will continue
to be automatically rewarded. After all, minori
ty students are less likely to gain an admissions
advantage through opportunities such as uni
versity legacy policies. Minority students are
also more likely to bear the burden of extenuat
ing circumstance because access to resources
often correlates with race. To the extent that ad
missions officers can assess the whole person by
considering race, affirmative action must be a
factor in the college application process.
