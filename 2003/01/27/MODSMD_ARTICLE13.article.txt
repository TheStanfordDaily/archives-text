# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Why are politics so boring? 
### 
Last week, someone came
around the house to get people
to sign some pro-Israel peti
tion. He never actually came by
my room, but one of my friends was
telling me about it. As these things tend to
do, it sparked off one of those two-hour
conversations about politics.
It ended with my friend, who by the
way is a political science major, giving
this great little speech: "It's like, you peo
ple bore me with your endless conflict.
Why don't you all just leave me in peace?
There are so many horrible things hap
pening in the world, every minute of
every day, and you just reach a point
where you stop caring. Because if you
didn't, you'd just go insane, because
there's nothing you can do about it. I

mean, what do you do?"
Dramatic pause. "I play
Freecell."
How many times have
you sat around with your
friends and complained
that the country is going
to hell in a handbasket, or
when are we going to get
a decent health-care svs-

tern, or I can't believe people voted for
that idiot? And then you went home and
did your laundry or something.
Politics is boring. It's fun to sit around
and talk about it, because it makes us feel
smart and important, but let me ask you:
If you had to choose between spending
time getting informed on all the issues or
watching a movie with your friends, which
would you pick?
It's not so much that people are stupid.
It's just that people don't care. It's very dif
ficult to sell idealism, especially to the edu
cated class. We have been trained to see
both sides of every issue, and we know from
history that there are no easy answers.
So if you're watching television and
something comes up about, oh, I dunno,
Argentina's economic woes, you're proba
bly going to change the channel unless
you a) have relatives living there, b) have
investments there or c) study economics
fora living. Most people's involvement in
politics (that is, if they have any at all) is al
most entirely mediated by personal bias
and self-interest.
And that's the way it should be. Who's
going to speak for you if not yourself?
Who's going to light your battles if not
you? Perhaps, if you're lucky enough not
to need representation, you can lend your
voice to another cause. Kinda like the lift
ed Lorax. You know, he speaks for the
trees. But in the end, that's what politics is:

It's people fighting for their own interests,
not some idealistic dream of us all working
together to make a better future. Yeah, to
some extent you have to care about other
people's issues where they overlap or con
flict with your own, but at a certain point,
you have to realize your limitations. You
can't please everyone.
Some people try, or at least pretend to.
That's why we have a political elite in this
country. It takes a special kind of arro
gance to think you know better how peo
ple should run their lives. Throw in a little
charisma and a lot of ambition, and you've
got yourself a political career. But real pol
itics doesn't happen in Washington, D.C.;
it happens in the street. It happens in peo
ple's homes and in the town hall; it hap
pens when one group of people organizes
and mobilizes to make themselves heard;
it happens when people are tired of the in
justice and shout it at the top of their
lungs: "Enough."
Plato's polis is a pie in the sky. We
throw around terms like "civic duty" and
"patriotism," but they don't mean any
thing. Nobody does politics because they
love politics. They do it because they love
the intellectual thrill of being in the know,
the self-righteous honor of defending
their own issues, the sense of accomplish
ment they get from the bettering of hu
mankind. In some cases, they love money,
or power, or both.
People cannot love in the abstract. You
can't love freedom of speech; you can only
love speaking your mind. You can't love
the environment; you can only love the
taste of fresh air. I can't love feminism; I
can only love being a woman.
Don't get me wrong. I have a lot of re
spect for the people who get out there and
fight fora cause greater than themselves.
Some of my best friends are activists. Hell,
I'm dating one. But I just can't bring my
self to get involved in his work. Because it's
not my issue. I cannot love the activist. I
can only love the man.
In the same way, I have a lot of admi
ration for the few people who do live the
ideal of the polis. The people who do it
not for love of money or power but for
love of humanity. The people who truly
believe that they're working fora better
tomorrow. The people who have a real
passion for representing their constituen
cy, so that they make the effort to under
stand the issues and make it work.
To you, the true politicians, I wish you
luck. You're going to need it.

Last week, someone came
around the house to get people
to sign some pro-Israel peti
tion. He never actually came by
my room, but one of my friends was
telling me about it. As these things tend to
do, it sparked off one of those two-hour
conversations about politics.
It ended with my friend, who by the
way is a political science major, giving
this great little speech: "It's like, you peo
ple bore me with your endless conflict.
Why don't you all just leave me in peace?
There are so many horrible things hap
pening in the world, every minute of
every day, and you just reach a point
where you stop caring. Because if you
didn't, you'd just go insane, because
there's nothing you can do about it. I

mean, what do you do?"
Dramatic pause. "I play
Freecell."
How many times have
you sat around with your
friends and complained
that the country is going
to hell in a handbasket, or
when are we going to get
a decent health-care svs-

tern, or I can't believe people voted for
that idiot? And then you went home and
did your laundry or something.
Politics is boring. It's fun to sit around
and talk about it, because it makes us feel
smart and important, but let me ask you:
If you had to choose between spending
time getting informed on all the issues or
watching a movie with your friends, which
would you pick?
It's not so much that people are stupid.
It's just that people don't care. It's very dif
ficult to sell idealism, especially to the edu
cated class. We have been trained to see
both sides of every issue, and we know from
history that there are no easy answers.
So if you're watching television and
something comes up about, oh, I dunno,
Argentina's economic woes, you're proba
bly going to change the channel unless
you a) have relatives living there, b) have
investments there or c) study economics
fora living. Most people's involvement in
politics (that is, if they have any at all) is al
most entirely mediated by personal bias
and self-interest.
And that's the way it should be. Who's
going to speak for you if not yourself?
Who's going to light your battles if not
you? Perhaps, if you're lucky enough not
to need representation, you can lend your
voice to another cause. Kinda like the lift
ed Lorax. You know, he speaks for the
trees. But in the end, that's what politics is:

It's people fighting for their own interests,
not some idealistic dream of us all working
together to make a better future. Yeah, to
some extent you have to care about other
people's issues where they overlap or con
flict with your own, but at a certain point,
you have to realize your limitations. You
can't please everyone.
Some people try, or at least pretend to.
That's why we have a political elite in this
country. It takes a special kind of arro
gance to think you know better how peo
ple should run their lives. Throw in a little
charisma and a lot of ambition, and you've
got yourself a political career. But real pol
itics doesn't happen in Washington, D.C.;
it happens in the street. It happens in peo
ple's homes and in the town hall; it hap
pens when one group of people organizes
and mobilizes to make themselves heard;
it happens when people are tired of the in
justice and shout it at the top of their
lungs: "Enough."
Plato's polis is a pie in the sky. We
throw around terms like "civic duty" and
"patriotism," but they don't mean any
thing. Nobody does politics because they
love politics. They do it because they love
the intellectual thrill of being in the know,
the self-righteous honor of defending
their own issues, the sense of accomplish
ment they get from the bettering of hu
mankind. In some cases, they love money,
or power, or both.
People cannot love in the abstract. You
can't love freedom of speech; you can only
love speaking your mind. You can't love
the environment; you can only love the
taste of fresh air. I can't love feminism; I
can only love being a woman.
Don't get me wrong. I have a lot of re
spect for the people who get out there and
fight fora cause greater than themselves.
Some of my best friends are activists. Hell,
I'm dating one. But I just can't bring my
self to get involved in his work. Because it's
not my issue. I cannot love the activist. I
can only love the man.
In the same way, I have a lot of admi
ration for the few people who do live the
ideal of the polis. The people who do it
not for love of money or power but for
love of humanity. The people who truly
believe that they're working fora better
tomorrow. The people who have a real
passion for representing their constituen
cy, so that they make the effort to under
stand the issues and make it work.
To you, the true politicians, I wish you
luck. You're going to need it.
