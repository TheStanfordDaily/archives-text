Technology in classrooms
can enhance learning
In regards to Rose Jenkins' article,
"Computers in the classroom take a byte
out oflearning" (Jan. 23), I feel that the ar
ticle presents too apprehensive a view
about the integration of technology into
the classroom for daily instruction and
about the benefits the integration would
have to instruction.
Having been exposed to a technologi
cal class environment last quarter in f'WR,
I have seen first hand the amazing benefits
of technology in instruction. Peer revision
of papers became more efficient, expedi
ent and beneficial due to the ability to use
wireless laptops during class time. My
classmates and I could critique and revise
papers in real time, making changes and
getting instant feedback on those changes.
In addition, the electronic whiteboards in
conjunction with the laptops allowed for
interactive presentations and enhanced
learning opportunities with the wealth of
information that could be easily accessed
on hard disk and on the Internet with only
a quick few clicks of the mouse.
Even though it might be impractical at
times for students to use technology in the
classroom (during math lectures, for exam
ple), the use of technology in the classroom
can improve the overall learning experi
ence for them. With classroom technology,
instructors can access pre-recorded exam
ples to present to the class, using time more
efficiently by explaining the example
rather than composing it on the white
board. Examples and notes that are pre
sented in lecture can easily be captured and
made available to the students for reference
outside of lecture. Technology can help
provide a more enjoyable educational ex
perience by providing additional tools for
instructors to use in order to create more
engaging and informative presentations.

While technology brings numerous ad
vantages to instruction, it cannot be seen as
infallible. Technology, like any tool, is prone
to fail at some points. In addition, the allure
of technological capabilities that wireless
laptops provide can easily distract students
from the goals of professors. However, in
stead of writing off technology as merely a
hassle, instructors should be responsible for
how technology is being used in the class
room and should be equipped to handle
technology failure with alternate plans.
As our society has become more tech
nologically advanced, so have our class
rooms. We have gone from chalkboards to
whiteboards to touch-sensitive screens,
and from slide projectors and overhead
projects to video projectors. Instead of
looking at technology in a questionable,
apprehensive manner, we need to make
the effort to quickly find its most appro
priate use in college-level learning envi
ronments and implement those possibili
ties into daily instruction in order for this
university to continue to live up to the
high academic standards for which it is
known worldwide.

Graduate student 'disgusted' by editorial
I am writing this letter in response to
your editorial, "Stanford should mobilize
against war in Iraq" (Jan. 24). I have to say
that I am disgusted by the very idea that
you would write an article like that. The
purpose of the newspaper is to let people
know the facts with the minimum of per
sonal bias. The readers should then draw
their own conclusions. I low dare you say
what a Stanford student should do?
Your job regarding any contentious
issue is to provide defense for both sides.
You use the typical tactic of fact omission

to get your personal opinions across. Why
don't you run an article titled, "Avoid war:
appease Saddam Hussein and delay any
repercussions fora few years." You don't
get into the fact that Saddam Hussein has
used weapons of mass destruction in the
past. You don't talk about the fact that
Saddam recently announced that any sci
entist who cooperates with U.N. weapons
inspectors will he killed, along with their
family members. You have your poorly
founded opinions, and you are just using
your editorial position to spread them.
I understand that this article appeared
in the opinions section of the paper, but
for you to have any chance of running a
quality and objective newspaper, the edi
torial board cannot choose a side in any
contentious issue.

hoards, is to discuss contentious issues, form
opinions about them and present our view
