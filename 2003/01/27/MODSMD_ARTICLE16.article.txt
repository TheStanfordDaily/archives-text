The Stanford men's basketball
team's 80-72 victory over un
ian Iced Southern California on
Saturday afternoon was, most no
tably, a game of rebounds — both
literal and figurative.

Saturday: Stanford 80, USC 72

Stanford sophomore swingman
Josh Childress grabbed a career
high 15 boards.
Junior shooting guard Matt

Lottich, coming off a l-for-8, 2-
point performance against UCLA
on Thursday, added 22 points off
of 50 percent shooting from the
field.
Senior point guard Julius
Barnes da/zled from the very be
ginning, opening his 27-point per
formance with a baseline slam
dunk over USC's 6-foot-11 center
Rory O'Neil.
And in what was, perhaps, the
most inspired rebound of the day,
junior forward Justin Davis re
turned to the Cardinal lineup —
after a sprained left knee caused
him to miss five games — to a

standing ovation in front of a
Maples crowd of 7,391.
"[Davis] got word tight before
the game that he could go," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "I thought he added some
stability.
"I told [the team] before the
game that Justin was going to be
available. The crowd responded,
and I think the kids responded."
After battling the Trojans to a
12-12 tie in the first four minutes of
play, the Cardinal (14-5, 5-2 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference) proceeded to
momentarily extend its lead to 11.
Opening with a steal by sopho

more forward Nick Robinson,
which lead to an open-court slam
dunk from Barnes, Stanford went
on an 13-2 run.
Davis, who entered the game
about a minute into the Cardinal
run, made his presence felt early.
After a low-post entry to him, Davis
found Barnes on the opposite side
of the court. Barnes then hit a deep
3-pointer to give Davis the assist.
A lew trips down the court later,
Davis scored his first field goal off a
turn-around jumper to bring the
score to 25- i l lie would finish

with seven points and four boards
in only 15 minutes of play.
Of his performance Davis said,
"More than anything I think the
team looked a lot more calm on
the court. I don't know if that was
because of my presence or what."
USC refused to let the game get
out of hand early, however. The
Trojans went into the locker room
only down by seven, 40-33, off 42
percent team shooting from the
field and 10 points from junior
guard Desmon Farmer.
After the halftirne break, neither
team lost its intensity. Lottich was
called fora flagrant foul at the 18-
minute mark that allowed the Tro
jans to pull within four points. A
minute later, after sophomore cen
ter Rob Ijttle grabbed a defensive
rebound, he and a Trojan forward
Nick Curtis got a little tangled up,
causing tempers to flare. The two
met face to face and had to be sepa
rated by their teammates, with each
receiving a technical foul.
With seven minutes left to play,
USC began a three-minute 8-0
run to tie the score at 62-62.
But from there it became a one
sided free-throw shooting contest.
Stanford capitalized on the dou
ble-bonus situation and went 16-
for-18 from the line. A Davis slam
dunk from a Lottich dish was Stan
ford's only field goal in that
stretch.
The Cardinal's ability to hit free
throws down the stretch was even
more surprising than Davis' sud

den return to the lineup. Stanford,
the Fac-10's worst free-throw
shooting team, shot 82 percent
from the charity stripe and went
18-for-20 in the final eight minutes
of play. Barnes went 13-for-13
from the line.
I he Cardinal's ability to con
vert its foul shots was USC head
coach Henry Bibby's main cause
for complaint after the game.
"[Stanford] had two buckets
from the last 11 minutes on," an
upset Bibby said. "Two buckets. Is
this fair to the kids?
"We just can't get a call down
the stretch. Were we that much
more aggressive than Stanford
tonight? I don't think so."
The foul-call disparity was in
deed significant — the Trojans
were whistled 28 times (20 in the
second halt), while Stanford was
only called for 14 total fouls. The
Cardinal shot 34 free throws to
USC's 12.
The foul differential can likely
be traced to the Trojans' decision
to play an aggressive full-court
pressure defense, while Stanford
opted to pick up at half court and
sit back in a zone for the majority
of the game.
"[This] was one of our better
performances," Montgomery said.
"We played well today, and we
shot free throws [well] today. That
was nice."
The Cardinal will attempt to
carry the momentum from this
two-win weekend into Arizona this
week. Stanford will face off against
No. 1 Arizona on Thursday in
Tucson before traveling to Tempe
on Saturday to challenge un
ranked Arizona State.

causing tempers to flare. The two
met face to face and had to be sepa
rated by their teammates, with each
receiving a technical foul.
With seven minutes left to play,
USC began a three-minute 8-0
run to tie the score at 62-62.
But from there it became a one
sided free-throw shooting contest.
Stanford capitalized on the dou
ble-bonus situation and went 16-
for-18 from the line. A Davis slam
dunk from a Lottich dish was Stan
ford's only field goal in that
stretch.
The Cardinal's ability to hit free
throws down the stretch was even
more surprising than Davis' sud

den return to the lineup. Stanford,
the Fac-10's worst free-throw
shooting team, shot 82 percent
from the charity stripe and went
18-for-20 in the final eight minutes
of play. Barnes went 13-for-13
from the line.
I he Cardinal's ability to con
vert its foul shots was USC head
coach Henry Bibby's main cause
for complaint after the game.
"[Stanford] had two buckets
from the last 11 minutes on," an
upset Bibby said. "Two buckets. Is
this fair to the kids?
"We just can't get a call down
the stretch. Were we that much
more aggressive than Stanford
tonight? I don't think so."
The foul-call disparity was in
deed significant — the Trojans
were whistled 28 times (20 in the
second halt), while Stanford was
only called for 14 total fouls. The
Cardinal shot 34 free throws to
USC's 12.
The foul differential can likely
be traced to the Trojans' decision
to play an aggressive full-court
pressure defense, while Stanford
opted to pick up at half court and
sit back in a zone for the majority
of the game.
"[This] was one of our better
performances," Montgomery said.
"We played well today, and we
shot free throws [well] today. That
was nice."
The Cardinal will attempt to
carry the momentum from this
two-win weekend into Arizona this
week. Stanford will face off against
No. 1 Arizona on Thursday in
Tucson before traveling to Tempe
on Saturday to challenge un
ranked Arizona State.
The Stanford men's basketball
team's 80-72 victory over un
ian Iced Southern California on
Saturday afternoon was, most no
tably, a game of rebounds — both
literal and figurative.

Men's Basketball
m
Saturday: Stanford 80, USC 72

Stanford sophomore swingman
Josh Childress grabbed a career
high 15 boards.
Junior shooting guard Matt

Lottich, coming off a l-for-8, 2-
point performance against UCLA
on Thursday, added 22 points off
of 50 percent shooting from the
field.
Senior point guard Julius
Barnes da/zled from the very be
ginning, opening his 27-point per
formance with a baseline slam
dunk over USC's 6-foot-11 center
Rory O'Neil.
And in what was, perhaps, the
most inspired rebound of the day,
junior forward Justin Davis re
turned to the Cardinal lineup —
after a sprained left knee caused
him to miss five games — to a

standing ovation in front of a
Maples crowd of 7,391.
"[Davis] got word tight before
the game that he could go," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "I thought he added some
stability.
"I told [the team] before the
game that Justin was going to be
available. The crowd responded,
and I think the kids responded."
After battling the Trojans to a
12-12 tie in the first four minutes of
play, the Cardinal (14-5, 5-2 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference) proceeded to
momentarily extend its lead to 11.
Opening with a steal by sopho

more forward Nick Robinson,
which lead to an open-court slam
dunk from Barnes, Stanford went
on an 13-2 run.
Davis, who entered the game
about a minute into the Cardinal
run, made his presence felt early.
After a low-post entry to him, Davis
found Barnes on the opposite side
of the court. Barnes then hit a deep
3-pointer to give Davis the assist.
A lew trips down the court later,
Davis scored his first field goal off a
turn-around jumper to bring the
score to 25- i l lie would finish

Senior point guard Julius Barnes drives through the lane during Stanford's
80-72 victory over Southern California on Saturday. Barnes scored 27
points, just one shy of his career high.
with seven points and four boards
in only 15 minutes of play.
Of his performance Davis said,
"More than anything I think the
team looked a lot more calm on
the court. I don't know if that was
because of my presence or what."
USC refused to let the game get
out of hand early, however. The
Trojans went into the locker room
only down by seven, 40-33, off 42
percent team shooting from the
field and 10 points from junior
guard Desmon Farmer.
After the halftirne break, neither
team lost its intensity. Lottich was
called fora flagrant foul at the 18-
minute mark that allowed the Tro
jans to pull within four points. A
minute later, after sophomore cen
ter Rob Ijttle grabbed a defensive
rebound, he and a Trojan forward
Nick Curtis got a little tangled up,
causing tempers to flare. The two
