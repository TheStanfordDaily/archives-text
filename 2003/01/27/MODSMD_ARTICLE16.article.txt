Men's Basketball
m
Saturday: Stanford 80, USC 72

Stanford sophomore swingman
Josh Childress grabbed a career
high 15 boards.
Junior shooting guard Matt

Lottich, coming off a l-for-8, 2-
point performance against UCLA
on Thursday, added 22 points off
of 50 percent shooting from the
field.
Senior point guard Julius
Barnes da/zled from the very be
ginning, opening his 27-point per
formance with a baseline slam
dunk over USC's 6-foot-11 center
Rory O'Neil.
And in what was, perhaps, the
most inspired rebound of the day,
junior forward Justin Davis re
turned to the Cardinal lineup —
after a sprained left knee caused
him to miss five games — to a

standing ovation in front of a
Maples crowd of 7,391.
"[Davis] got word tight before
the game that he could go," Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "I thought he added some
stability.
"I told [the team] before the
game that Justin was going to be
available. The crowd responded,
and I think the kids responded."
After battling the Trojans to a
12-12 tie in the first four minutes of
play, the Cardinal (14-5, 5-2 Pacif
ic- 10 Conference) proceeded to
momentarily extend its lead to 11.
Opening with a steal by sopho

more forward Nick Robinson,
which lead to an open-court slam
dunk from Barnes, Stanford went
on an 13-2 run.
Davis, who entered the game
about a minute into the Cardinal
run, made his presence felt early.
After a low-post entry to him, Davis
found Barnes on the opposite side
of the court. Barnes then hit a deep
3-pointer to give Davis the assist.
A lew trips down the court later,
Davis scored his first field goal off a
turn-around jumper to bring the
score to 25- i l lie would finish
