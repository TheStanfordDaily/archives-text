# Card keeps its cool to burn Trojans
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
For five minutes in the first half
of its win over Southern California,
the Stanford men's basketball team
played textbook basketball. The
players beat the zone by passing,
they rained jumpers from all over
the court, their man-to-man defense
was stilling, and they seized a 25-14
lead with 11:54 remaining.
Two fouls, two turnovers and a
missed lay-up later, the lead was
down to four, and it looked like the
Cardinal was in for another ragged
nail-biter. But there's an upside to
winning ugly on a regular basis: you
learn how to keep an even keel in
choppy waters.
So when junior shooting guard
Matt Lottich got called for an inten
tional foul early in the second half,
the team took it in stride. When a
tangle with Trojan forward Nick
Curtis got the usually stoic Rob Little

riled up and drew a double-techni
cal, Stanford retained its composure.
And, wonder of wonders, when USC
got aggressive and put the Cardinal
on the line, the boys in white sank
free throw after free throw.
After the game, senior point
guard Julius Barnes was at a loss to
explain his 13-for-13 night at the
line, noting sheepishly that foul
shots have always been a point of
emphasis in practice. But fora team
ranked last in the conference in foul
shooting, hitting 22-of-24 down the
stretch can't be explained by the old
"practice-makes-perfect" mantra.
"It's all mental," Barnes admit
ted after a few moments' reconsid
eration.
And so was the team's steady exe
cution in the face of relentless ag
gression from USC's pressing de
fense. Unable to force the Cardinal
backcourt into the sort of miscues
that plagued it in three losses to the
Trojans last year, guards Errick

Craven and Desmon Farmer com
mitted a series of reach-ins, holds
and hacks that kept the whistle
blowers busy throughout the second
half.
"They try to get you to make a
mistake, and we didn't make too
many unforced errors," head coach
Mike Montgomery pointed out.
The signs of frustration were
etched onto the Trojans' counte
nances — so much so that one hall
expected Farmer's mother to warn
him to wipe the scowl off his face or
risk getting it stuck, that way.
Meanwhile, Lottich, Barnes
and sophomore swingman Josh
Childress were all business. The
trio calmly dismantled the press
that frazzled former players Casey
Jacobsen and Tony Giovacchini
last year. And when matters be
came heated in the second half,
the Trojans were the ones who lost
their cool.
"I think our guys were just inter

ested in trying u> win," Montgomery
said. "I don't think they thought
ihey were going to win by getting
into a confrontation."
Junior forward Justin Davis, who
learned just before tip-ofl that he
was cleared to play for the first time
in five games, may have contributed
to his teammates' unflappable de
meanor.
"I felt the team was a lot more
calm on the court," Davis said. "I
don't know il it was my presence, or
just the unit on the court. . . but a
lot of stuff just worked out for us."
While Davis played just 15 min
utes, he posted seven points, four
rebounds and two assists and neu
tralized Curtis and (JSC center
Rory O'Neil in the paint — a per
formance that was invaluable in
light of sophomore center Little's
uneven showing.
But no matter who was on the
court at any given point, there was a
marked contrast between Stanford's
"just win" determination and USC's
"please God don't let us lose again"
frenzy.

It would have been nice to watch
40 minutes of the precision offense
that dazzled the crowd in the first
half. But when the Cardinal sealed
the victory by maintaining its poise
and concentration, while the hag
gard Trojans melted down — a vin
dicating reversal from last year's
contests between the schools — no
