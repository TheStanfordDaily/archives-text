# Trojans end women's Pac-10 win streak

### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
LOS ANGELES — There
aren't too many times when Tara
VanDerveer vocalizes her anger
— probably because her teams
just don't lose all that often — but
apparently she made an excep
tion after Stanford's 75-72 loss at
Southern California yesterday.
VanDerveer bemoaned her

team's lack of effort, calling it
"uninspired" and said the Cardinal
"became a stand-around team."
Such are the so-called travails of
No. 5 Stanford (15-2,7-1 Pacific-10
Conference), which saw its 28-
game Pac-10 and 10-game overall
win streaks come to an end.

Obviously, there aren't any
real problems in Cardinal land.
Stanford split the Los Angeles
trek, winning 80-78 Friday night
against UCLA on a shot by Nicole
Powell with 2.3 seconds left and
coming up on the short end yes
terday. But the Cardinal still re
mains atop the conference and
appears to be headed fora top
seed in the NCAA tournament.
But VanDerveer was so un
happy with her team's lack of ag
gressiveness in the (JSC game —
especially in the opening min
utes, when USC (9-11, 4-5)
surged to a 10-0 lead — that she
boldly declared changes were on
the horizon.
"We're going look at people
that have been stepping up big
for us," VanDerveer said. "Maybe
that's something I should have
done earlier."
Hidden among the shadows of
Stanford's first conference loss
since March 2001 (to USC, no
less) was the play of Powell, who
scored a season-high 34 points,
with five 3-pointers, and pulled
down 15 rebounds.
The junior All-American was
at her very best on a night when
Stanford's well-documented bal
ance somehow disappeared into
the rafters of the L.A. Sports
Arena. Chelsea Trotter was the
only other Cardinal player in

double figures, scoring 10 points.
In the end, it was USC's
spreading around of the wealth
that helped decide the outcome.
Rometra Craig led five Tro
jans in double figures with 19
points, but it was the play of re
serves Meghan Gnekow (12
points) and Kim Gipson (10) that
had USC coach Chris Gobrecht
calling her bench's effort its best
of the season.
And USC really needed that
kind of effort, since second-lead
ing scorer and rebounder Aisha
Hollans sat out the contest with a
bruised knee suffered against
California on Friday.
USC blitzed the Cardinal from
tipolf, shooting a blistering 60.6
percent from the field and forc
ing 12 first-half turnovers en
route to a 49-35 halftime lead.
Behind 11 points and three 3-
pointers from Powell to open the
second half, the Cardinal went on
a 15-1 run to tie the game with
14:19 remaining.
Stanford took its first and only
lead of the game at 60-58 with a
pair of free throws from Powell
with 6:12 remaining.
But Craig wrested the lead
right back on the next possession
with a trey from the wing to put
USC ahead for good.

Sophomore guard Kelley Suminksi defends her opponent. The women's team
beat UCLA 80-78 on Friday night before falling to USC 75-72 on Sunday.
Stanford tried to get closer, but
just didn't seem to have the energy
in the waning moments. Suminski
was fouled as she shot a 3-pointer
with 0.4 seconds left, and then
made all three free throws.
The Trojans then just
launched the ball past the half
court line and celebrated as the
buzzer sounded.
A loss to USC was enough to
dampen the Cardinal's spirits, but
the weekend could have been a
whole lot worse with the effort
given by an upset-hungry UCIA
squad on Friday at Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA's Michelle Greco (28
points and eight steals) and
Nikki Blue (If) points) played
their "A" games, but the rest of
the team stepped up for the Bru
ins as well.

Whitney Jones, who posted a
double-double, and Jamila
Veasley, who nearly tripled her
average output with six points,
both played their best games of
the season as the Cardinal's win
ning streak almost ended two
days earlier than it did.
The Bruins played a tenacious
game, pulling down 21 offensive
boards to outrebound the Cardi
nal 41-31 —something that
hasn't happened since Stanford
fell at Tennessee a month ago.
Stanford, by now used to Pac
-10 teams playing t heir best games
of the season against it, still led
38-36 at half time after Powell
nailed a 3-pointer as time ex
pired.
The Bruins came out ener
gized from the locker room,
pushing their lead to 52-47 after
a jumper by Emma Tautolo with
13:03 to go.
The Cardinal regained the
lead behind the play of King,

who first hit a 3-pointer from
(he wing to pull Stanford within
one, and then put her team
ahead for good at 60-58 with a
tough drive and 3-point play
with 8:24 remaining.
UCLA battled in the latter
stages of the game and eventually
tied the score with 27 seconds re
maining off a pair of Greco free
throws.
That's when Stanford turned
to Powell, who played a season
high 36 minutes, for some last
second magic.
Powell got the hall at the top of
the key and drove inside with
about six seconds left. She knifed
through the Bruin defense and
put up the soft six-foot leaner in
the lane that gave the Cardinal its
fourth come-from-behind road
victory of the season.
Stanford next has a home
and-home series with Cal this
week beginning Wednesday at
Maples Pavilion at 7:00 p.m.

throws.
That's when Stanford turned
to Powell, who played a season
high 36 minutes, for some last
second magic.
Powell got the hall at the top of
the key and drove inside with
about six seconds left. She knifed
through the Bruin defense and
put up the soft six-foot leaner in
the lane that gave the Cardinal its
fourth come-from-behind road
victory of the season.
Stanford next has a home
and-home series with Cal this
week beginning Wednesday at
Maples Pavilion at 7:00 p.m.
LOS ANGELES — There
aren't too many times when Tara
VanDerveer vocalizes her anger
— probably because her teams
just don't lose all that often — but
apparently she made an excep
tion after Stanford's 75-72 loss at
Southern California yesterday.
VanDerveer bemoaned her

team's lack of effort, calling it
"uninspired" and said the Cardinal
"became a stand-around team."
Such are the so-called travails of
No. 5 Stanford (15-2,7-1 Pacific-10
Conference), which saw its 28-
game Pac-10 and 10-game overall
win streaks come to an end.

Obviously, there aren't any
real problems in Cardinal land.
Stanford split the Los Angeles
trek, winning 80-78 Friday night
against UCLA on a shot by Nicole
Powell with 2.3 seconds left and
coming up on the short end yes
terday. But the Cardinal still re
mains atop the conference and
appears to be headed fora top
seed in the NCAA tournament.
But VanDerveer was so un
happy with her team's lack of ag
gressiveness in the (JSC game —
especially in the opening min
utes, when USC (9-11, 4-5)
surged to a 10-0 lead — that she
boldly declared changes were on
the horizon.
"We're going look at people
that have been stepping up big
for us," VanDerveer said. "Maybe
that's something I should have
done earlier."
Hidden among the shadows of
Stanford's first conference loss
since March 2001 (to USC, no
less) was the play of Powell, who
scored a season-high 34 points,
with five 3-pointers, and pulled
down 15 rebounds.
The junior All-American was
at her very best on a night when
Stanford's well-documented bal
ance somehow disappeared into
the rafters of the L.A. Sports
Arena. Chelsea Trotter was the
only other Cardinal player in

double figures, scoring 10 points.
In the end, it was USC's
spreading around of the wealth
that helped decide the outcome.
Rometra Craig led five Tro
jans in double figures with 19
points, but it was the play of re
serves Meghan Gnekow (12
points) and Kim Gipson (10) that
had USC coach Chris Gobrecht
calling her bench's effort its best
of the season.
And USC really needed that
kind of effort, since second-lead
ing scorer and rebounder Aisha
Hollans sat out the contest with a
bruised knee suffered against
California on Friday.
USC blitzed the Cardinal from
tipolf, shooting a blistering 60.6
percent from the field and forc
ing 12 first-half turnovers en
route to a 49-35 halftime lead.
Behind 11 points and three 3-
pointers from Powell to open the
second half, the Cardinal went on
a 15-1 run to tie the game with
14:19 remaining.
Stanford took its first and only
lead of the game at 60-58 with a
pair of free throws from Powell
with 6:12 remaining.
But Craig wrested the lead
right back on the next possession
with a trey from the wing to put
USC ahead for good.

Sophomore guard Kelley Suminksi defends her opponent. The women's team
beat UCLA 80-78 on Friday night before falling to USC 75-72 on Sunday.
Stanford tried to get closer, but
just didn't seem to have the energy
in the waning moments. Suminski
was fouled as she shot a 3-pointer
with 0.4 seconds left, and then
made all three free throws.
The Trojans then just
launched the ball past the half
court line and celebrated as the
buzzer sounded.
A loss to USC was enough to
dampen the Cardinal's spirits, but
the weekend could have been a
whole lot worse with the effort
given by an upset-hungry UCIA
squad on Friday at Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA's Michelle Greco (28
points and eight steals) and
Nikki Blue (If) points) played
their "A" games, but the rest of
the team stepped up for the Bru
ins as well.

Whitney Jones, who posted a
double-double, and Jamila
Veasley, who nearly tripled her
average output with six points,
both played their best games of
the season as the Cardinal's win
ning streak almost ended two
days earlier than it did.
The Bruins played a tenacious
game, pulling down 21 offensive
boards to outrebound the Cardi
nal 41-31 —something that
hasn't happened since Stanford
fell at Tennessee a month ago.
Stanford, by now used to Pac
-10 teams playing t heir best games
of the season against it, still led
38-36 at half time after Powell
nailed a 3-pointer as time ex
pired.
The Bruins came out ener
gized from the locker room,
pushing their lead to 52-47 after
a jumper by Emma Tautolo with
13:03 to go.
The Cardinal regained the
lead behind the play of King,

who first hit a 3-pointer from
(he wing to pull Stanford within
one, and then put her team
ahead for good at 60-58 with a
tough drive and 3-point play
with 8:24 remaining.
UCLA battled in the latter
stages of the game and eventually
tied the score with 27 seconds re
maining off a pair of Greco free
throws.
That's when Stanford turned
to Powell, who played a season
high 36 minutes, for some last
