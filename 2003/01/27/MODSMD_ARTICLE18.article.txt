LOS ANGELES — There
aren't too many times when Tara
VanDerveer vocalizes her anger
— probably because her teams
just don't lose all that often — but
apparently she made an excep
tion after Stanford's 75-72 loss at
Southern California yesterday.
VanDerveer bemoaned her

Women's Basketball
Friday: No. 5 Stanford 80, UCLA 78
Sunday: USC 75, Stanford 72

team's lack of effort, calling it
"uninspired" and said the Cardinal
"became a stand-around team."
Such are the so-called travails of
No. 5 Stanford (15-2,7-1 Pacific-10
Conference), which saw its 28-
game Pac-10 and 10-game overall
win streaks come to an end.

Obviously, there aren't any
real problems in Cardinal land.
Stanford split the Los Angeles
trek, winning 80-78 Friday night
against UCLA on a shot by Nicole
Powell with 2.3 seconds left and
coming up on the short end yes
terday. But the Cardinal still re
mains atop the conference and
appears to be headed fora top
seed in the NCAA tournament.
But VanDerveer was so un
happy with her team's lack of ag
gressiveness in the (JSC game —
especially in the opening min
utes, when USC (9-11, 4-5)
surged to a 10-0 lead — that she
boldly declared changes were on
the horizon.
"We're going look at people
that have been stepping up big
for us," VanDerveer said. "Maybe
that's something I should have
done earlier."
Hidden among the shadows of
Stanford's first conference loss
since March 2001 (to USC, no
less) was the play of Powell, who
scored a season-high 34 points,
with five 3-pointers, and pulled
down 15 rebounds.
The junior All-American was
at her very best on a night when
Stanford's well-documented bal
ance somehow disappeared into
the rafters of the L.A. Sports
Arena. Chelsea Trotter was the
only other Cardinal player in

double figures, scoring 10 points.
In the end, it was USC's
spreading around of the wealth
that helped decide the outcome.
Rometra Craig led five Tro
jans in double figures with 19
points, but it was the play of re
serves Meghan Gnekow (12
points) and Kim Gipson (10) that
had USC coach Chris Gobrecht
calling her bench's effort its best
of the season.
And USC really needed that
kind of effort, since second-lead
ing scorer and rebounder Aisha
Hollans sat out the contest with a
bruised knee suffered against
California on Friday.
USC blitzed the Cardinal from
tipolf, shooting a blistering 60.6
percent from the field and forc
ing 12 first-half turnovers en
route to a 49-35 halftime lead.
Behind 11 points and three 3-
pointers from Powell to open the
second half, the Cardinal went on
a 15-1 run to tie the game with
14:19 remaining.
Stanford took its first and only
lead of the game at 60-58 with a
pair of free throws from Powell
with 6:12 remaining.
But Craig wrested the lead
right back on the next possession
with a trey from the wing to put
USC ahead for good.
