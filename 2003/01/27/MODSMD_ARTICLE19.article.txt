BKRKELKY — It's January,
and the Golden Bears are hiber
nating.

Women's Gymnastics
Friday: No. 10 Stanford 195.250, Cal
192.950

Despite the clanging and hang
ing of its marching band, the Cali
fornia women's gymnastics team
(3-2, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
couldn't wake up in time as No. 10
Stanford (4-1, 2-0) outperformed
the Bears 195.25-192.95 in Cal's
home gym on Friday.
Although it notched a number
of personal bests throughout the

evening, the Cal roster received a
total score of 192.95 for the third
consecutive time in the young sea
son. Stanford went home with
three event titles and the all
around, forcing the Bears to be
content with the floor title cap
tured by sophomore My-Lan
Dodd.
Despite grabbing the win, the
Cardinal was hoping for more
than the evening ultimately of
fered.
"I felt that the energy was a hit
low from the team at Cal and
that's something we need to work
on," Stanford head coach Kristen
Smyth said. "We need more of
the exciting collective energy that
only collegiate gymnastics teams
can have.

"It's important to be a mentally
tough team, so that if we have a 112 ew
mistakes early on, we are able to
quickly regain our focus," junior
Kendall Beck said. "As we get fur
ther into the season, we are going
to work on keeping the energy up
throughout every competition."
Stanford started the night on the
uneven bars, which saw freshman
Natalie Foley score a season-best
9.925 to garner the bars tide. Juniors
Lindsay Wing and Caroline Fluhrer
also executed solidly, picking the
Cardinal up after a few rough land
ings earlier in the lineup.
But (he Bears were simultane
ously posting consistent scores on
the vaulting table, and Stanford
took the first rotation by a margin
of 0.225.

Coming off her explosive per
formance on bars, Foley proceed
ed to win vault with a 9.875. Fresh
man Glyn Sweets chalked up a 9.8
for the Cardinal as well. Mean
while, the Bears had a tough time
on bars but still had a chance as
they found themselves within
0.475 of Stanford's lead.
The balance beam would be the
straw that broke the Bears' back.
As Stanford tumbled on the
floor exercise, the Bears tumbled
of! the beam and were forced to
count four falls. The lone clean
routine for Cal on the rotation was
freshman Britani Pittullo's career
best 9.8.
Once the Bears cleared the
beam for the Cardinal heading
into the final rotation, Stanford
was able to close out (lie win on its
strongest event.
"We had outstanding perfor
mances on tht' balance beam, and
it was nice to end the night that
way," Smyth said.
Beck set the tone at the top of
the beam lineup by tallying a new
career high of 9.925. Beck's beau
tifully executed routine bested
her previous high of 9.9, set a
mere six clays earlier against No.
8 Denver.
"My personal goal for every
meet is to contribute the best rou
tine I can to the team score," Beck
said. "Since I was first up, 1 was just
happy that I could set a good base
score for the rest of the beam team
to build from."
Fluhrer posted 9.8, paving the
way for high scores as junior Lise
Leveille and Wing prepared to
compete.
Leveille's routine was solid from
the moment she mounted the
beam with a front tuck — the same
mount that caused four falls for the
Cal lineup — and scored a 9.9.
Wing secured a 9.975 for the
third time in her career — tying
the all-time top performance on
beam for Stanford, again — to
take first in the event.
"Alter struggling a little on the
first three events, we came on
strong with some excellent beam
routines to finish up the meet,"
Leveille said. "However, we gave
up several tenths on landings
against Cal, which we'll really focus
on fixing this week in the gym."
In addition to Foley's first-place
finishes on vault and bars, Wing,
Beck and Leveille seized the top
three honors on beam while
Fluhrer took second on both floor
and bars.
Leveille collected the all

around title with a 39.125, and just
on her heels was Foley, whose
38.975 translated to second.
Another highlight oi the night
for the Cardinal was the return ol
freshman Jessica Louie and
sophomore Mandy Delgado from
injury. Louie delivered on vault,
and Delgado performed a show
stopping floor routine to cap the
night.
"We warmed tip some difficult

skills at Cal and incorporated Jessi
ca and Mandy," Smyth said. "It's
exciting for us to get everyone
healthy and contributing."
"While the team's performance
was a bit shaky on Friday, we now
know some of our weak areas and
will work hard this week to fix
them," Beck said. "It is still early in
the season, and we are looking for
ward to improving each weekend
up until the last day of the year."
