Women's Gymnastics
Friday: No. 10 Stanford 195.250, Cal

Despite the clanging and hang
ing of its marching band, the Cali
fornia women's gymnastics team
(3-2, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
couldn't wake up in time as No. 10
Stanford (4-1, 2-0) outperformed
the Bears 195.25-192.95 in Cal's
home gym on Friday.
Although it notched a number
of personal bests throughout the

evening, the Cal roster received a
total score of 192.95 for the third
consecutive time in the young sea
