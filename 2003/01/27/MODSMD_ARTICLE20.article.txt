### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A win over California (0-1) was
not supposed to happen for the

But on Saturday, Stanford won
its own Cardinal Open at Burn
ham Pavilion, beating Cal for the
first time since 1999 in the process.
The Cardinal also won five of the
six individual events, plus (he all
around in a high-level competi
tion featuring six teams and about
50 athletes.
Despite the numerous individ
ual honors, the highlight of the
competition for the gymnasts was
beating the Bears in front of a
packed house.
"It was one of the most exciting
meets of my Stanford career," said
senior co-captain Marshall Ki win,
who won the ringcompetition. "In
my three years, we never beat (lal.

I expected it to happen sometime
this year, so I was happy that it
happened this early."
Adding to t he Cardinal celebra
tion, lirst-year head coach Thorn
Glielmi got his first win on the
Farm.
"It wasn't about beating Cal,"
Glielmi said. "It was about those
guys using the meet to learn how
to compete better. When they go
out, their mindset has to be not, '11
I hit,' but rather, 'How well will 1
hit.'"
Stanford looked surprisingly
consistent as it beat an improved
Cal squad with four All-Americans
and national team member Cody
Moore.
By starting on the vault, a high
scoring event for Stanford, the
Cardinal took the lead early and
never relinquished it, leading by
as many as two points going into
the final event. Cal was within
mere tenths of Stanford until the
pommel horse competition,
where the Cardinal beat the Bears
by almost three points.
"It was sort of unexpected, and
we really surprised ourselves," said
senior Matt McLean, who hit his
six routines and took third in the

meet. Stanford narrowily defeated California 212.75-211.10.
all-around competition. "No one is
really expecting much from us."
Despite not putting up a full
lineup on the high bar, Stanford
1 lit all five of its routines, catching
the seven releases performed —
something the Cardinal hasn't ac
complished in several seasons. Se
nior Paul O'Leary caught a full
twisting double-back release for
the first time in competition, and
junior co-captain Dan Gill nailed a
rare two-release move combina
tion to win the high bar title by six
tenths of a point.
The bar was the best routine of a
monster night by Gill, who also won
the floor, vault and all-around titles.
"Dan's on a two peak cycle,"
said Glielmi. " Most guys are train
ing to peak at NCAAs. Dan's also
training to make the national team

at Winter Cup [in two weeks]."
To gymnastics aficionados, the
best routine of the night was a vir
tuoso pommel horse performance
by senior Cade Raggio. With a dif
ficulty start value of 9.9, Raggio
scored a 9.7, winning I lie event by
.35 and posting Stanford's highest
score of the competition.
"A routine like that is so rare in
men's gymnastics," Glielmi said.
"When you see a routine like that
— big, original, perfectly executed
— you think, 'That's what the
sport is all about.' "
Raggio said he is finally getting
comfortable with his routine in
competition.
"1 was glad I hit pommel horse
because I hadn't had a good meet
until that point," Raggio said. "It
was an extra incentive to not fall off."
This has proven to be the main
characteristic of the team this year.
Despite not having a 112 ull lineup on
all events, the team's top routines
are some of the best in the country.

"That's the thing about our team
this year," Krwin said. "We're not
deep, but we could come away with
champions on all events at N( AAs.
The Cardinal was far from per
fect on the parallel bars, however.
O'Leary and McLean were the
only Cardinal gymnasts who
didn't fall on their routines, as Cal
outscored the Cardinal by almost
two points on the event. Cal's
Moore, the defending NCAA
champion on the parallel bars,
took the event title.
The sold-out crowd had the op
portunity to see top-level competi
tion from six All-Americans, four
NCAA event champions, two na
tional team members and one world
championship team member. The
atmosphere was loud and made for
some ex< iting competition.
"1 think it was evident last night as
to how much fun we were having,"
Gill said. "People will think it was a
fluke, so we'll use it as a motivator to
prove to people that it wasn't."

But on Saturday, Stanford won
its own Cardinal Open at Burn
ham Pavilion, beating Cal for the
first time since 1999 in the process.
The Cardinal also won five of the
six individual events, plus (he all
around in a high-level competi
tion featuring six teams and about
50 athletes.
Despite the numerous individ
ual honors, the highlight of the
competition for the gymnasts was
beating the Bears in front of a
packed house.
"It was one of the most exciting
meets of my Stanford career," said
senior co-captain Marshall Ki win,
who won the ringcompetition. "In
my three years, we never beat (lal.

I expected it to happen sometime
this year, so I was happy that it
happened this early."
Adding to t he Cardinal celebra
tion, lirst-year head coach Thorn
Glielmi got his first win on the
Farm.
"It wasn't about beating Cal,"
Glielmi said. "It was about those
guys using the meet to learn how
to compete better. When they go
out, their mindset has to be not, '11
I hit,' but rather, 'How well will 1
hit.'"
Stanford looked surprisingly
consistent as it beat an improved
Cal squad with four All-Americans
and national team member Cody
Moore.
By starting on the vault, a high
scoring event for Stanford, the
Cardinal took the lead early and
never relinquished it, leading by
as many as two points going into
the final event. Cal was within
mere tenths of Stanford until the
pommel horse competition,
where the Cardinal beat the Bears
by almost three points.
"It was sort of unexpected, and
we really surprised ourselves," said
senior Matt McLean, who hit his
six routines and took third in the

all-around competition. "No one is
really expecting much from us."
Despite not putting up a full
lineup on the high bar, Stanford
1 lit all five of its routines, catching
the seven releases performed —
something the Cardinal hasn't ac
complished in several seasons. Se
nior Paul O'Leary caught a full
twisting double-back release for
the first time in competition, and
junior co-captain Dan Gill nailed a
rare two-release move combina
tion to win the high bar title by six
tenths of a point.
The bar was the best routine of a
monster night by Gill, who also won
the floor, vault and all-around titles.
"Dan's on a two peak cycle,"
said Glielmi. " Most guys are train
ing to peak at NCAAs. Dan's also
training to make the national team

at Winter Cup [in two weeks]."
To gymnastics aficionados, the
best routine of the night was a vir
tuoso pommel horse performance
by senior Cade Raggio. With a dif
ficulty start value of 9.9, Raggio
scored a 9.7, winning I lie event by
.35 and posting Stanford's highest
score of the competition.
"A routine like that is so rare in
men's gymnastics," Glielmi said.
"When you see a routine like that
— big, original, perfectly executed
— you think, 'That's what the
sport is all about.' "
Raggio said he is finally getting
comfortable with his routine in
competition.
"1 was glad I hit pommel horse
because I hadn't had a good meet
until that point," Raggio said. "It
was an extra incentive to not fall off."
This has proven to be the main
characteristic of the team this year.
Despite not having a 112 ull lineup on
all events, the team's top routines
are some of the best in the country.

"That's the thing about our team
this year," Krwin said. "We're not
deep, but we could come away with
champions on all events at N( AAs.
The Cardinal was far from per
fect on the parallel bars, however.
O'Leary and McLean were the
only Cardinal gymnasts who
didn't fall on their routines, as Cal
outscored the Cardinal by almost
two points on the event. Cal's
Moore, the defending NCAA
champion on the parallel bars,
took the event title.
The sold-out crowd had the op
portunity to see top-level competi
tion from six All-Americans, four
NCAA event champions, two na
tional team members and one world
championship team member. The
atmosphere was loud and made for
some ex< iting competition.
"1 think it was evident last night as
to how much fun we were having,"
Gill said. "People will think it was a
fluke, so we'll use it as a motivator to
prove to people that it wasn't."
