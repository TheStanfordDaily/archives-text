# Baseball opens season with pair of wins

### DANIEL URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Put aside any anxieties about
the loss oflast year's stars.
If this weekend's series against
Santa Clara is any indication, the
new Cardinal baseball roster has
the tools to repeat last year's stellar
season.

Baseball
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 7, Santa Clara 2
Sunday: Stanford 5, Santa Clara 0

Stanford won its season opener
for the sixth time in seven years on
Saturday (0-2) by a score of 7-2 at
Santa Clara.
The Cardinal (2-0) then pro
ceeded to win its first game at
Sunken Diamond this year with a
5-0, one-hit shutout against the
Broncos yesterday. Only a two-out
double in the ninth inning saved
the Broncos from being held hit
less by the Cardinal staff.
The Cardinal's respective Sat
urday and Sunday starters, junior
John Hudgins and senior Tim
Cunningham, shut down the
Broncos' lineup to earn the wins.
Hudgins threw six innings on
Saturday, striking out six and giv
ing up two runs, while Cunning
ham dealt a hitless 5.2 innings on
Sunday.
"I felt really good," Hudgins
said. "I felt like I was in very good
shape for being at this point in the
season. Coach [Tom] Kunis has re
ally helped me get my mechanics
and delivery in shape early this
year, and I almost feel like I'm in
midseason form."
The training has evidently paid
off with exceptional control, as
Hudgins had only one walk in his
six innings.
In addition to the pitching duo
of Hudgins and Cunningham, the
Cardinal bats lit up the Bronco
pitchers. Stanford's defense, which
included an entirely different in
field from last year, cleanly fielded
everything the Bronco hitters
managed to send its way.

"I walked a few guys, but the de
fense really picked me up," Cun
ningham said. "We had no errors
all weekend."
Taking four balls was the only
way the Broncos could reach base
yesterday, as Cunningham struck
out four and left the game without
giving up a hit.
Cunningham and Hudgins
weren't the only Cardinal pitchers
with outstanding performances
over the weekend.
Senior Ryan McCally picked up
the save on Saturday, walking
none and allowing just one hit in
three innings of work.
As a general rule, a pitcher usu
ally gets lit up in his first collegiate
outing, but apparently no one told
this to freshman Matt Manship,
who struck out three and allowed
only one hit in 3.1 innings en route
to a save in yesterday's affair.
"I was happy with the results
from my first collegiate experi
ence," Manship said. "Now that I
it's over, I feel like I've just jumped
over a huge hump."
The Cardinal pitchers may
have stolen the show this weekend,
but Stanford's hitters proved that
they are ready to make some noise
in 2003 as well.
"This is the first time since I've
been here that our hitting is prob
ably the dominant force on our
team," Cunningham said. "All of
our hitters, one through nine, are
capable of hitting the ball hard,
and [this weekendj they came up
with late runs to put the games out
of reach."
Saturday's game saw eight of
nine Cardinal starters have at least
one hit, including home runs from
junior Brian Hall and sophomore
Danny Putnam. Freshman John
Mayberry Jr. pounded a triple and
both senior Ryan Garko and Put
nam went 3-for-5.
On Sunday, Putnam homered
for the second consecutive game, as
both he and Mayberry had two hits.
"I'm seeing the ball really well
and just letting the game come to
me," Putnam said. "I've been re

warded with a couple of home runs
in my first two games this year."
Things went almost eerily well
for the Cardinal, as its pitching,
hitting and defense seemed to be
in excellent form so early in the
season.
"If we play as well as we did this

weekend, we will have the poten
tial to win any game," Cunning
ham said.
The Cardinal's strong start will
face a stiffer test this weekend
when Stanford heads to No. 13 Cal
State-Fulleuon fora three-game
series.
