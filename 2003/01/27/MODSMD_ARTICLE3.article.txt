# Endowment pool survives downturn
##

University endowments
across the country are suffering
from the recent economic
downturn. Although Stanford's
endowment has also been nega
tively impacted — partly result
ing in several budget cuts — its
investment returns remain
higher than those of many of the
University's peer institutions.
This result is attributed largely
to the investment strategies of
the Stanford Management
Company, which administers
the endowment.
The endowment provides
funds for the University's annu
al operating budget, granting fi
nancial support for educational
resources and research initia
tives. Much of the endowment is
composed of alumni contribu
tions and is distributed by the
management company to more
than 150 managers who in turn
invest the money in a wide vari
ety of assets.
"We don't make any invest
ments directly into companies,"
said Griffith King, an invest
ment associate at the manage
ment company. "We give it to an
investment manager, and they
make the decision on which
companies to invest in."
On average, the University
receives approximately 5 per

cent of the total endowment as
an annual payout that can be
tunneled into different projects
and departments. The exact
amount is calculated using a
smoothing formula that pre
vents fluctuation in periods of
high market volatility.
"The management company
and the controller's office go to
the trustees with the figure gen
erated by tfie formula," said
Michael McCatfery, the presi
dent and chief executive officer
of the management company.
"From that point on, it's the
University's decision how they
are going to spend it."
The Stanford Merged En
dowment Pool (MEP) consists of
86 percent of the University's
total endowment and 50 per
cent of expendable funds. The
MEP produced a minus-2.6 per
cent investment return for the
last fiscal year, which ended on
June 30. At the end of this 12-
month period, the MEP was val
ued at $7.6 billion.
"Although we are disappoint
ed to show negative perfor
mance under any circum
stances, we feel our diversified
portfolio structure has demon
strated excellent relative perfor
mance over the last 12 months,"
McCatfery said in the company's
endowment report.
The last fiscal year presented an
incredibly difficult financial envi
ronment, demonstrated by an 18
percent decline in the S&P 500
U.S. stock index. As a result, the
average university endowment
was reduced by six percent.
"The difference between six
percent and 2.6 percent is approx
imately $300 million," McCaffery
said. "So to have beaten the medi
an by that much is a substantial
achievement."
Cambridge Associates consult
ing firm ranks Stanford in the 85th
percentile based on investment re
turns for this fiscal year.
"While we are concerned about
our daily, quarterly and annual re
turns, we're most concerned about
our 10-year returns," McCaffery
said.
Over the past decade, the MEP
has averaged an annual invest
ment return of 14.6 percent, plac
ing Stanford in the 95th per
centile, according to Cambridge
Associates. Management company
officials said that this ranking puts
the University at the same level as
Harvard, Princeton and Yale.
The investors at the Stanford
Management Company attribute
this apparent success to strategic
asset allocation and the variety of
the endowment's current hold
ings.
The company must constantly
work to strike a balance between
higher risk and more secure in
vestments.
"We want the University to get
as much money out of the endow
ment each year as it possibly can,"
McCaffery said. "But we want to
preserve the purchasing power of
the endowment."

The company seeks to pool as
sets and weigh them in such a way
that they garner the highest possi
ble returns at a comfortable level
of risk. This level is determined
through collaboration of the com
pany's board and the University's
Board of Trustees, as well as the
University's president and chief fi
nancial officer.
"We're constantly playing of
fense and defense," McCaffery
said. "If we said we're not going to
invest in risky stuff, there would be
no way to preserve the purchasing
power of the endowment ."
"If we took no risk during the
past 10 years, the endowment
would be half its current size," said
Michael Ross, a chief investment
officer at the management compa
ny. "Whenever you take risk you
absorb the potential for volatility,
and that's what we've faced the last
couple years."
Despite the necessary risk, the
company claims to have adopted
more conservative strategies by fa
voring more stable assets such as
bonds, which may also have con
tributed to its relative success.
"We seek to be very strong, and
not necessarily the highest-risk,
highest-return player every year,"
Ross said. "We want to be a solid
A,' 'A-minus' player every year.
And if you string this together for
10 years, ultimately we're an 'A
plus' player."
The management company's
officials predict continued success
in future years, including further
positive returns.
"To me, Stanford is about ex
cellence," McCaffery said. "Most of
our action is concentrated on giv
ing students and faculty as rich an
educational environment as possi
ble, while making sure future fac
ulty and students get to have the
same experience."
