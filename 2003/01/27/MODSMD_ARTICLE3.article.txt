# Endowment pool survives downturn

University endowments
across the country are suffering
from the recent economic
downturn. Although Stanford's
endowment has also been nega
tively impacted — partly result
ing in several budget cuts — its
investment returns remain
higher than those of many of the
University's peer institutions.
This result is attributed largely
to the investment strategies of
the Stanford Management
Company, which administers
the endowment.
The endowment provides
funds for the University's annu
al operating budget, granting fi
nancial support for educational
resources and research initia
tives. Much of the endowment is
composed of alumni contribu
tions and is distributed by the
management company to more
than 150 managers who in turn
invest the money in a wide vari
ety of assets.
"We don't make any invest
ments directly into companies,"
said Griffith King, an invest
ment associate at the manage
ment company. "We give it to an
investment manager, and they
make the decision on which
companies to invest in."
On average, the University
receives approximately 5 per

cent of the total endowment as
an annual payout that can be
tunneled into different projects
and departments. The exact
amount is calculated using a
smoothing formula that pre
vents fluctuation in periods of
high market volatility.
"The management company
and the controller's office go to
the trustees with the figure gen
erated by tfie formula," said
Michael McCatfery, the presi
dent and chief executive officer
of the management company.
"From that point on, it's the
University's decision how they
are going to spend it."
The Stanford Merged En
dowment Pool (MEP) consists of
86 percent of the University's
total endowment and 50 per
cent of expendable funds. The
MEP produced a minus-2.6 per
cent investment return for the
last fiscal year, which ended on
June 30. At the end of this 12-
month period, the MEP was val
ued at $7.6 billion.
"Although we are disappoint
ed to show negative perfor
mance under any circum
stances, we feel our diversified
portfolio structure has demon
strated excellent relative perfor
mance over the last 12 months,"
McCatfery said in the company's
endowment report.
