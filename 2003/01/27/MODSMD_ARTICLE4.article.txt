# Panels examine religious violence
## Panelists call for a re-examination of the role that religion plays in society 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
While religion itself isn't the sole cause of
what is ostensibly called religious conflict, peo
ple need to re-evaluate the role religion plays in
society, scholars and religious leaders conclud
ed at the "Exploring Religious Boundaries and
Conflict" conference on Saturday.
The conference was organized to focus on
how religions define and interact with one an
other. This issue has drawn increased attention
in the last two years after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attack and continued religiously divisive vio
lence in regions such as Kashmir and Gujurat.
After a welcome by Dean for Religious Life
Scotty McLennan, keynote speaker Prof. Anant
Rambachan of the Religion Department of St.
Olaf College discussed the role of religion in ex
acerbating conflicts between groups and the
need to use religion as a means of creating uni
fied values and identities.
"Religion, admittedly, is not the sole expla
nation for any of these conflicts, and the reli
gious factor is intermeshed with historical, po
litical, economic, racial and cultural dimen
sions," he said. "Yet we cannot overlook the
role of religion in intensifying narrow loyalties,
providing a motivation for violence and en
trenching divisiveness."
Rambachan warned against "explaining
away the relationship between religion and vio
lent conflict" by arguing that religion is being
misused.
"When we reflect on the role of religion as a
force for reconciliation, we cannot ignore its
continuing contribution in human discord and
divisiveness," he said.

Yet, Rambachan added, "While we must
never underestimate and ignore the destruc
tive side of religion, our challenge is also to
discover and recover the religious and ethi
cal insights, often ignored and forgotten,
that are essential for the well-being of the
world community.
"One of the unprecedented opportunities of
our current context is the possibility of growth
and mutual transformation through interreli
gious dialogue and encounter," he said.
The first panel discussion, titled "Defining
the 'Other,' " featured a series of scholars who
agreed that drawing distinctions among people
of other faiths can lead to violence, but that
often it is not adherence to religion that is the

true source of such division.
Political Science Prof. James Fearon, whose
recent research has focused on civil wars, ar
gued that many wars being fought along reli
gious lines would more accurately be described
as political conflicts.
Fearon said that roughly one-fourth of the
conflicts he studied in the last 50 years were
characterized by distinct religious affiliations,
and that the majority of such conflicts occurred
on the edges of the Islamic world.
Claiming that, in the modern period, "reli
gion has been hijacked and worked over" as a
front for forging national identities, he said,
"Very few of these conflicts, possibly any of

them, seem to be driven by reli
gion in the way old-time religious
war used to be."
He added lhat, in his data, nei
ther religious diversity nor having
a religious minority population
was correlated with an increased
propensity for civil conllict.
Prof. Byron Bland, a Presbyter
ian minister and associate director
of the Stanford Center for Conflict
and Negotiation, posed the ques
tions of whether the "other" exists
and if it is necessary to draw such
distinctions.
"The answer I come out with is,

'Unfortunately, yes,' " he said.
"And the more 1 look at lhat, the
more 1 want to remove the 'unfor
tunately.' "
Bland discussed the impor
tance of the "other" in forging in
dividual identities and stressed
that in religiously defined conflicts
today, the issues of contention are
not theological but political. He
cited his time in Northern Ireland,
where he said he did not feel in
danger despite spending time in
areas viewed as hostile to people of
his faith.
The second panel discussion,
entitled "Encountering the
'Other,' " featured religious lead
ers instead of scholars and fo
cused on how people must ap
proach those of other faiths in

order to avert religiously based
conflict.
McLennan, speaking from a
Christian perspective, opened by
expressing concern that most peo
ple's encounter with the religious
"other" is through violence —
often violence that is alleged to be
sanctioned by God.
"Basically, I'm just appalled by
all this, and as Stanford's dean for
Religious Life, I wonder if I should
give a talk about whether religion
does more harm than it does
good," he said.
Like many of the panelists,
McLennan asked whether reli
gious violence could be explained
in terms other than religion, de
spite a growing body of literature
claiming that religion is a source of

violence.
"Is religion ultimately promot
ing war [and] intolerance, not tol
erance?" he said. "I don't think
so. For most people, it is through
our religious institutions that we
learn what it means to be
human."
Alter the conclusion of the pan
els, the conference ended with a
performance by Talisman in
Memorial Church. The church
celebrated its 100-year anniver
sary on Saturday.
Though it grew over the course
of the day, attendance at the con
ference was meager. By the end of
the conference, slightly over 60
people were in attendance, most
non-students. Approximately 25
students attended.

good," he said.
Like many of the panelists,
McLennan asked whether reli
gious violence could be explained
in terms other than religion, de
spite a growing body of literature
claiming that religion is a source of

violence.
"Is religion ultimately promot
ing war [and] intolerance, not tol
erance?" he said. "I don't think
so. For most people, it is through
our religious institutions that we
learn what it means to be
human."

the conference, slightly over 60
people were in attendance, most

While religion itself isn't the sole cause of
what is ostensibly called religious conflict, peo
ple need to re-evaluate the role religion plays in
society, scholars and religious leaders conclud
ed at the "Exploring Religious Boundaries and
Conflict" conference on Saturday.
The conference was organized to focus on
how religions define and interact with one an
other. This issue has drawn increased attention
in the last two years after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attack and continued religiously divisive vio
lence in regions such as Kashmir and Gujurat.
After a welcome by Dean for Religious Life
Scotty McLennan, keynote speaker Prof. Anant
Rambachan of the Religion Department of St.
Olaf College discussed the role of religion in ex
acerbating conflicts between groups and the
need to use religion as a means of creating uni
fied values and identities.
"Religion, admittedly, is not the sole expla
nation for any of these conflicts, and the reli
gious factor is intermeshed with historical, po
litical, economic, racial and cultural dimen
sions," he said. "Yet we cannot overlook the
role of religion in intensifying narrow loyalties,
providing a motivation for violence and en
trenching divisiveness."
Rambachan warned against "explaining
away the relationship between religion and vio
lent conflict" by arguing that religion is being
misused.
"When we reflect on the role of religion as a
force for reconciliation, we cannot ignore its
continuing contribution in human discord and
divisiveness," he said.

Yet, Rambachan added, "While we must
never underestimate and ignore the destruc
tive side of religion, our challenge is also to
discover and recover the religious and ethi
cal insights, often ignored and forgotten,
that are essential for the well-being of the
world community.
"One of the unprecedented opportunities of
our current context is the possibility of growth
and mutual transformation through interreli
gious dialogue and encounter," he said.
The first panel discussion, titled "Defining
the 'Other,' " featured a series of scholars who
agreed that drawing distinctions among people
of other faiths can lead to violence, but that
often it is not adherence to religion that is the

true source of such division.
Political Science Prof. James Fearon, whose
recent research has focused on civil wars, ar
gued that many wars being fought along reli
gious lines would more accurately be described
as political conflicts.
Fearon said that roughly one-fourth of the
conflicts he studied in the last 50 years were
characterized by distinct religious affiliations,
and that the majority of such conflicts occurred
on the edges of the Islamic world.
Claiming that, in the modern period, "reli
gion has been hijacked and worked over" as a
front for forging national identities, he said,
"Very few of these conflicts, possibly any of

them, seem to be driven by reli
gion in the way old-time religious
war used to be."
He added lhat, in his data, nei
ther religious diversity nor having
a religious minority population
was correlated with an increased
propensity for civil conllict.
Prof. Byron Bland, a Presbyter
ian minister and associate director
of the Stanford Center for Conflict
and Negotiation, posed the ques
tions of whether the "other" exists
and if it is necessary to draw such
distinctions.
"The answer I come out with is,

'Unfortunately, yes,' " he said.
"And the more 1 look at lhat, the
more 1 want to remove the 'unfor
tunately.' "
Bland discussed the impor
tance of the "other" in forging in
dividual identities and stressed
that in religiously defined conflicts
today, the issues of contention are
not theological but political. He
cited his time in Northern Ireland,
where he said he did not feel in
danger despite spending time in
areas viewed as hostile to people of
his faith.
The second panel discussion,
entitled "Encountering the
'Other,' " featured religious lead
ers instead of scholars and fo
cused on how people must ap
proach those of other faiths in

order to avert religiously based
conflict.
McLennan, speaking from a
Christian perspective, opened by
expressing concern that most peo
ple's encounter with the religious
"other" is through violence —
often violence that is alleged to be
sanctioned by God.
"Basically, I'm just appalled by
all this, and as Stanford's dean for
Religious Life, I wonder if I should
give a talk about whether religion
does more harm than it does
good," he said.
Like many of the panelists,
McLennan asked whether reli
gious violence could be explained
in terms other than religion, de
spite a growing body of literature
claiming that religion is a source of

violence.
