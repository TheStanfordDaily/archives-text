# Economist critiques hospital deal Leland takes research leave
## Rising health-care costs may offset gains in worker salary 
### JULIE PATEL 
As a unit secretary for Stanford
Hospital, 48-year-old Lourdes
Arafiles coordinates the proce
dures— laboratory work, blood
samples and appointments tor X
rays and other services — for her
floor, which can hold up to 26 pa
tients. Doing that for eight hours
a day is stressful enough, she said.
But when the unit secretary on
another floor doesn't show up for

work and Araliles has to manage
both floors, she said it becomes
downright chaotic. Sometimes,
while she is on one floor she miss
es a procedure a patient needed
on another floor.
Last year, Araliles was mak
ing $14.78 an hour, $2.08 less
than the starting salary fora
unit secretary at the Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center, accord
ing to Mark Gomez, spokesman
for SEIU Local 715.
This is part of the reason
Araliles, a member of the union,
went on strike in November.

Stanford Director of Athletics Ted Le
land will take an 11-week "special research
leave" from his post on March 1 to become a
distinguished fellow at (he Hoover Institu
tion. Leland will return as athletic director
on May 19.
During Leland's absence, Debi Gore-
Mann, senior associate athletic director for fi
nance and business affairs, will become Stan
ford's interim athletic director.
At the Hoover Institution, Leland plans to
conduct research fora book and work on
four speeches lie is scheduled to deliver
around the nation. He also plans to spend
more time with his family.
"I have been on this treadmill for quite a
while," said Leland, who has been Stanford's
athletic director since 1991, "and this leave

will give me a chance to step off and focus on
some of my other interests.
"1 appreciate the opportunity provided
me by [University President] John Hennessy
and [Hoover Institution Director] John
Raisian ..
Hennessy stated that Leland's leave was in
part to acknowledge his contributions to the
University.
"Ted Leland and his staff have built the
preeminent athletic program in the country,"
Hennessy said. "He has shown a tireless dedi
cation to Stanford and our student athletes,
and he richly deserves this leave. 1 hope this
time allows Ted to pursue intellectual and
personal interests and that he returns to Stan
ford in May renewed and reinvigorated."
