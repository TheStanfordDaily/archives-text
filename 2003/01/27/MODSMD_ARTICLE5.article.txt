# Economist critiques hospital deal Leland takes research leave
## Rising health-care costs may offset gains in worker salary 
### JULIE PATEL 
As a unit secretary for Stanford
Hospital, 48-year-old Lourdes
Arafiles coordinates the proce
dures— laboratory work, blood
samples and appointments tor X
rays and other services — for her
floor, which can hold up to 26 pa
tients. Doing that for eight hours
a day is stressful enough, she said.
But when the unit secretary on
another floor doesn't show up for

work and Araliles has to manage
both floors, she said it becomes
downright chaotic. Sometimes,
while she is on one floor she miss
es a procedure a patient needed
on another floor.
Last year, Araliles was mak
ing $14.78 an hour, $2.08 less
than the starting salary fora
unit secretary at the Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center, accord
ing to Mark Gomez, spokesman
for SEIU Local 715.
This is part of the reason
Araliles, a member of the union,
went on strike in November.

Stanford Director of Athletics Ted Le
land will take an 11-week "special research
leave" from his post on March 1 to become a
distinguished fellow at (he Hoover Institu
tion. Leland will return as athletic director
on May 19.
During Leland's absence, Debi Gore-
Mann, senior associate athletic director for fi
nance and business affairs, will become Stan
ford's interim athletic director.
At the Hoover Institution, Leland plans to
conduct research fora book and work on
four speeches lie is scheduled to deliver
around the nation. He also plans to spend
more time with his family.
"I have been on this treadmill for quite a
while," said Leland, who has been Stanford's
athletic director since 1991, "and this leave

will give me a chance to step off and focus on
some of my other interests.
"1 appreciate the opportunity provided
me by [University President] John Hennessy
and [Hoover Institution Director] John
Raisian ..
Hennessy stated that Leland's leave was in
part to acknowledge his contributions to the
University.
"Ted Leland and his staff have built the
preeminent athletic program in the country,"
Hennessy said. "He has shown a tireless dedi
cation to Stanford and our student athletes,
and he richly deserves this leave. 1 hope this
time allows Ted to pursue intellectual and
personal interests and that he returns to Stan
ford in May renewed and reinvigorated."

'Who's footing the bill?'
At the end of last year, the
union struck what seemed to be a
sweet deal with Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital for the service workers it
represented, including lab techni
cians, food service employees and
nursing assistants.
The union managed to negotiate
a 21 percent pay raise over three
years and won representation on a
committee that decides how to staff
the hospital. Now, Aratiles is making
$1.13 more per hour.
On the surface, it's a win-win sit
uation: Workers get paid more,
which creates more incentives for
better-qualified workers, and pa
tient care improves.
Hut who's footing the bill?
That's the question that concerns
Stanford University economist
Alain Enthoven.
Wage increases drive up the
costs of health care, and thus peo
ple of all socioeconomic back
grounds — including blue-collar
workers — pay more for health in
surance premiums, Enthoven
said. Or their salaries aren't as high
because employers account for the
rising costs of insurance.
But you can't look at labor costs
in a bubble, countered Bernard E.
Anderson, professor of manage
ment at the Wharton School of
Business in Pennsylvania.
"We're talking about the real
world," Anderson said. "The in
creased cost of labor is not the pri
mary factor responsible for in
creasing health care costs."
Of the total expenses at the
Children's Hospital — about
$253,000 for the fiscal year end
ing Aug. 31, 2001 — salaries and
benefits accounted for approxi
mately $ 120,000. The cost of pay
ing all employees — not just ser
vice workers — represents
roughly 47 percent of the hospi
tal's total costs.
That may seem like a lot, but
when inflation is factored in, at an
average of about 3.5 percent per

year, the wage increase is less
than 4 percent per year — barely
a drop in the hospital's bucket of
expenditures, Anderson said.
The effects on workers
There are other problems that
can surface for workers when they
manage to get a pay raise, Ander
son added.
"If, as an adjustment to in
creased wage costs, the hospital re
duces the size of the workforce,
that means those who remain will
have more work to do," he said.
Fortunately for the hospital
workers, the union will influence
how many workers are staffed on
each floor, Gomez said. As part of the
new agreement, a committee of both
union and management representa
tives will meet to discuss staffing is
sues. When they don't agree, a fed
eral mediator will step in.
The union wasn't able to se
cure a promise of job security
from the hospitals, which could
spell trouble, Anderson said. The
hospital could resort to substitut
ing part-time workers for full
time ones.
The problem is, part-time em
ployees "don't get all the benefits,"
Anderson said. "No health cover
age, no pension contribution. On
the average, the fringe benefits ac
count for 33 percent of the wages.
For part-time workers, the fringe
benefits represent only 7 percent
of the wages."
Labor advocates want to spend
more on employee salaries and
benefits. However, according to
Enthoven, doing so for employees
in health care and other insur
ance-dependent industries affects
how much those employees spend
on insurance or how little they end
up getting paid.
For example, he said, business
es pay their employees for the
value they add to the business. The
cost of the employees can't exceed
the value they add, or their jobs get
eliminated. Increasingly, employ
ers are sharing hefty chunks of the
burden of rising health-care costs
with their employees.
During the strike at the Stan
ford hospitals, the union unsuc
cessfully demanded that workers'

spouses receive health-care cover
age. Thus, employees making
Arafiles' salary could, under her
current plan, end up paying up to
about $900 — 3 percent of their
income — to purchase insurance
fora spouse alone. Once inflation
is factored in, the recent pay raise
may do little to alleviate health
care costs.
Health-care costs spiraling
According to the 2002 Kaiser
Family Foundation Employer
Health Benefits study, compa
nies increased workers' monthly
premiums on average by 27 per
cent for single coverage and 16
percent for family coverage be
tween 2001 and 2002, despite av
erage hourly wage increases of
only 3.8 percent in 2001 and 2.9
percent in 2002.
This has led some employees to
cancel their insurance. More than
40 million people in the United
States are uninsured, and as costs
go up, that number is growing, En
thoven said.
The government helps pay for
medical services for some of these
people, but many go without the
services they need. And in his cur
rent budget proposal, Gov. Gray
Davis has advocated slashing gov
ernment-subsidized health benefits.
With the economy in its current
slump, some employers seem reluc
tant to pay any more than they have
to help insure their workforce.
Take General Electric — G.E.'s
health-care costs soared from
$965 million in 1999 to $1.4 bil
lion in 2002. The company recent
ly announced that its employees
would have to pay more for health
insurance to compensate for the
increase.
Under G.E.'s new plan, the av
erage employee would pay as
much as $400 a year in health in
surance co-payments, according to
the AFL-CIO Web site. Some
17,000 G.E. workers went on a
two-day strike this month to
protest the higher premiums but
didn't secure any relief.
Several factors are contributing
to rising costs, including record
spending on medical technology.
The legal environment of hospitals

these days also contributes to high
er costs. For example, hospitals
often order costly extra tests, even
when a doctor doesn't think
they're needed to diagnose a pa
tient. That's because if the hospi
tals get sued, the extra tests would
make their cases stronger.
Balancing the equation
Hospitals can pump more
money into one area, such as staff
pay, at the expense of another. Or,
they can charge more for services.
So, for example, they can charge
$1,000 instead of $900 fora Mag
netic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
attributing the extra costs to the in
creased cost of labor. Or inversely,
they can refuse to give employees
bonuses or pay raises if they want
to spend more on technology.
Teaching hospitals like the
Stanford Hospital are in a unique
ly difficult position because they
spend so much on training new
doctors and providing low-income
care, Enthoven said.
Teaching hospitals account for
only 6 percent of the country's
total hospital beds but provide 39
percent of total low-income care.
The result is an expense of more
than $5.5 billion annually, accord
ing to Anthony L. Barbato, M.D.,
chairman of the board of directors
of the Association of Academic
Health Centers in Washington,
D.C., and president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Loyola University
Health System.
As part of the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, the federal govern
ment cut subsidies for teaching
hospitals, putting many of these
hospitals in the red.
Recently, Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital have stopped losing
money.
And despite the reservations of
scholars and academics, Arafiles
said she was reasonably satisfied
with the new agreement between
the hospitals and the union.
"For the first time, we were able
to pressure Stanford to give us a
step increase," she said. "At least
we have a voice. We can say, 'I'm

'Who's footing the bill?'
At the end of last year, the
union struck what seemed to be a
sweet deal with Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital for the service workers it
represented, including lab techni
cians, food service employees and
nursing assistants.
The union managed to negotiate
a 21 percent pay raise over three
years and won representation on a
committee that decides how to staff
the hospital. Now, Aratiles is making
$1.13 more per hour.
On the surface, it's a win-win sit
uation: Workers get paid more,
which creates more incentives for
better-qualified workers, and pa
tient care improves.
Hut who's footing the bill?
That's the question that concerns
Stanford University economist
Alain Enthoven.
Wage increases drive up the
costs of health care, and thus peo
ple of all socioeconomic back
grounds — including blue-collar
workers — pay more for health in
surance premiums, Enthoven
said. Or their salaries aren't as high
because employers account for the
rising costs of insurance.
But you can't look at labor costs
in a bubble, countered Bernard E.
Anderson, professor of manage
ment at the Wharton School of
Business in Pennsylvania.
"We're talking about the real
world," Anderson said. "The in
creased cost of labor is not the pri
mary factor responsible for in
creasing health care costs."
Of the total expenses at the
Children's Hospital — about
$253,000 for the fiscal year end
ing Aug. 31, 2001 — salaries and
benefits accounted for approxi
mately $ 120,000. The cost of pay
ing all employees — not just ser
vice workers — represents
roughly 47 percent of the hospi
tal's total costs.
That may seem like a lot, but
when inflation is factored in, at an
average of about 3.5 percent per

year, the wage increase is less
than 4 percent per year — barely
a drop in the hospital's bucket of
expenditures, Anderson said.
The effects on workers
There are other problems that
can surface for workers when they
manage to get a pay raise, Ander
son added.
"If, as an adjustment to in
creased wage costs, the hospital re
duces the size of the workforce,
that means those who remain will
have more work to do," he said.
Fortunately for the hospital
workers, the union will influence
how many workers are staffed on
each floor, Gomez said. As part of the
new agreement, a committee of both
union and management representa
tives will meet to discuss staffing is
sues. When they don't agree, a fed
eral mediator will step in.
The union wasn't able to se
cure a promise of job security
from the hospitals, which could
spell trouble, Anderson said. The
hospital could resort to substitut
ing part-time workers for full
time ones.
The problem is, part-time em
ployees "don't get all the benefits,"
Anderson said. "No health cover
age, no pension contribution. On
the average, the fringe benefits ac
count for 33 percent of the wages.
For part-time workers, the fringe
benefits represent only 7 percent
of the wages."
Labor advocates want to spend
more on employee salaries and
benefits. However, according to
Enthoven, doing so for employees
in health care and other insur
ance-dependent industries affects
how much those employees spend
on insurance or how little they end
up getting paid.
For example, he said, business
es pay their employees for the
value they add to the business. The
cost of the employees can't exceed
the value they add, or their jobs get
eliminated. Increasingly, employ
ers are sharing hefty chunks of the
burden of rising health-care costs
with their employees.
During the strike at the Stan
ford hospitals, the union unsuc
cessfully demanded that workers'

spouses receive health-care cover
age. Thus, employees making
Arafiles' salary could, under her
current plan, end up paying up to
about $900 — 3 percent of their
income — to purchase insurance
fora spouse alone. Once inflation
is factored in, the recent pay raise
may do little to alleviate health
care costs.
Health-care costs spiraling
According to the 2002 Kaiser
Family Foundation Employer
Health Benefits study, compa
nies increased workers' monthly
premiums on average by 27 per
cent for single coverage and 16
percent for family coverage be
tween 2001 and 2002, despite av
erage hourly wage increases of
only 3.8 percent in 2001 and 2.9
percent in 2002.
This has led some employees to
cancel their insurance. More than
40 million people in the United
States are uninsured, and as costs
go up, that number is growing, En
thoven said.
The government helps pay for
medical services for some of these
people, but many go without the
services they need. And in his cur
rent budget proposal, Gov. Gray
Davis has advocated slashing gov
ernment-subsidized health benefits.
With the economy in its current
slump, some employers seem reluc
tant to pay any more than they have
to help insure their workforce.
Take General Electric — G.E.'s
health-care costs soared from
$965 million in 1999 to $1.4 bil
lion in 2002. The company recent
ly announced that its employees
would have to pay more for health
insurance to compensate for the
increase.
Under G.E.'s new plan, the av
erage employee would pay as
much as $400 a year in health in
surance co-payments, according to
the AFL-CIO Web site. Some
17,000 G.E. workers went on a
two-day strike this month to
protest the higher premiums but
didn't secure any relief.
Several factors are contributing
to rising costs, including record
spending on medical technology.
The legal environment of hospitals

these days also contributes to high
er costs. For example, hospitals
often order costly extra tests, even
when a doctor doesn't think
they're needed to diagnose a pa
tient. That's because if the hospi
tals get sued, the extra tests would
make their cases stronger.
Balancing the equation
Hospitals can pump more
money into one area, such as staff
pay, at the expense of another. Or,
they can charge more for services.
So, for example, they can charge
$1,000 instead of $900 fora Mag
netic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
attributing the extra costs to the in
creased cost of labor. Or inversely,
they can refuse to give employees
bonuses or pay raises if they want
to spend more on technology.
Teaching hospitals like the
Stanford Hospital are in a unique
ly difficult position because they
spend so much on training new
doctors and providing low-income
care, Enthoven said.
Teaching hospitals account for
only 6 percent of the country's
total hospital beds but provide 39
percent of total low-income care.
The result is an expense of more
than $5.5 billion annually, accord
ing to Anthony L. Barbato, M.D.,
chairman of the board of directors
of the Association of Academic
Health Centers in Washington,
D.C., and president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Loyola University
Health System.
As part of the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, the federal govern
ment cut subsidies for teaching
hospitals, putting many of these
hospitals in the red.
Recently, Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital have stopped losing
money.
And despite the reservations of
scholars and academics, Arafiles
said she was reasonably satisfied
with the new agreement between
the hospitals and the union.
"For the first time, we were able
to pressure Stanford to give us a
step increase," she said. "At least

As a unit secretary for Stanford
Hospital, 48-year-old Lourdes
Arafiles coordinates the proce
dures— laboratory work, blood
samples and appointments tor X
rays and other services — for her
floor, which can hold up to 26 pa
tients. Doing that for eight hours
a day is stressful enough, she said.
But when the unit secretary on
another floor doesn't show up for

work and Araliles has to manage
both floors, she said it becomes
downright chaotic. Sometimes,
while she is on one floor she miss
es a procedure a patient needed
on another floor.
Last year, Araliles was mak
ing $14.78 an hour, $2.08 less
than the starting salary fora
unit secretary at the Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center, accord
ing to Mark Gomez, spokesman
for SEIU Local 715.
This is part of the reason
Araliles, a member of the union,
went on strike in November.

Stanford Director of Athletics Ted Le
land will take an 11-week "special research
leave" from his post on March 1 to become a
distinguished fellow at (he Hoover Institu
tion. Leland will return as athletic director
on May 19.
During Leland's absence, Debi Gore-
Mann, senior associate athletic director for fi
nance and business affairs, will become Stan
ford's interim athletic director.
At the Hoover Institution, Leland plans to
conduct research fora book and work on
four speeches lie is scheduled to deliver
around the nation. He also plans to spend
more time with his family.
"I have been on this treadmill for quite a
while," said Leland, who has been Stanford's
athletic director since 1991, "and this leave

will give me a chance to step off and focus on
some of my other interests.
"1 appreciate the opportunity provided
me by [University President] John Hennessy
and [Hoover Institution Director] John
Raisian ..
Hennessy stated that Leland's leave was in
part to acknowledge his contributions to the
University.
"Ted Leland and his staff have built the
preeminent athletic program in the country,"
Hennessy said. "He has shown a tireless dedi
cation to Stanford and our student athletes,
and he richly deserves this leave. 1 hope this
time allows Ted to pursue intellectual and
personal interests and that he returns to Stan
ford in May renewed and reinvigorated."

KATE KAUFMAN/The Stanford Daily
'Who's footing the bill?'
At the end of last year, the
union struck what seemed to be a
sweet deal with Stanford Hospital
and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital for the service workers it
represented, including lab techni
cians, food service employees and
nursing assistants.
The union managed to negotiate
a 21 percent pay raise over three
years and won representation on a
committee that decides how to staff
the hospital. Now, Aratiles is making
$1.13 more per hour.
On the surface, it's a win-win sit
uation: Workers get paid more,
which creates more incentives for
better-qualified workers, and pa
tient care improves.
Hut who's footing the bill?
That's the question that concerns
Stanford University economist
Alain Enthoven.
Wage increases drive up the
costs of health care, and thus peo
ple of all socioeconomic back
grounds — including blue-collar
workers — pay more for health in
surance premiums, Enthoven
said. Or their salaries aren't as high
because employers account for the
rising costs of insurance.
But you can't look at labor costs
in a bubble, countered Bernard E.
Anderson, professor of manage
ment at the Wharton School of
Business in Pennsylvania.
"We're talking about the real
world," Anderson said. "The in
creased cost of labor is not the pri
mary factor responsible for in
creasing health care costs."
Of the total expenses at the
Children's Hospital — about
$253,000 for the fiscal year end
ing Aug. 31, 2001 — salaries and
benefits accounted for approxi
mately $ 120,000. The cost of pay
ing all employees — not just ser
vice workers — represents
roughly 47 percent of the hospi
tal's total costs.
That may seem like a lot, but
when inflation is factored in, at an
average of about 3.5 percent per

year, the wage increase is less
than 4 percent per year — barely
a drop in the hospital's bucket of
expenditures, Anderson said.
The effects on workers
There are other problems that
can surface for workers when they
manage to get a pay raise, Ander
son added.
"If, as an adjustment to in
creased wage costs, the hospital re
duces the size of the workforce,
that means those who remain will
have more work to do," he said.
Fortunately for the hospital
workers, the union will influence
how many workers are staffed on
each floor, Gomez said. As part of the
new agreement, a committee of both
union and management representa
tives will meet to discuss staffing is
sues. When they don't agree, a fed
eral mediator will step in.
The union wasn't able to se
cure a promise of job security
from the hospitals, which could
spell trouble, Anderson said. The
hospital could resort to substitut
ing part-time workers for full
time ones.
The problem is, part-time em
ployees "don't get all the benefits,"
Anderson said. "No health cover
age, no pension contribution. On
the average, the fringe benefits ac
count for 33 percent of the wages.
For part-time workers, the fringe
benefits represent only 7 percent
of the wages."
Labor advocates want to spend
more on employee salaries and
benefits. However, according to
Enthoven, doing so for employees
in health care and other insur
ance-dependent industries affects
how much those employees spend
on insurance or how little they end
up getting paid.
For example, he said, business
es pay their employees for the
value they add to the business. The
cost of the employees can't exceed
the value they add, or their jobs get
eliminated. Increasingly, employ
ers are sharing hefty chunks of the
burden of rising health-care costs
with their employees.
During the strike at the Stan
ford hospitals, the union unsuc
cessfully demanded that workers'

spouses receive health-care cover
age. Thus, employees making
Arafiles' salary could, under her
current plan, end up paying up to
about $900 — 3 percent of their
income — to purchase insurance
fora spouse alone. Once inflation
is factored in, the recent pay raise
may do little to alleviate health
care costs.
Health-care costs spiraling
According to the 2002 Kaiser
Family Foundation Employer
Health Benefits study, compa
nies increased workers' monthly
premiums on average by 27 per
cent for single coverage and 16
percent for family coverage be
tween 2001 and 2002, despite av
erage hourly wage increases of
only 3.8 percent in 2001 and 2.9
percent in 2002.
This has led some employees to
cancel their insurance. More than
40 million people in the United
States are uninsured, and as costs
go up, that number is growing, En
thoven said.
The government helps pay for
medical services for some of these
people, but many go without the
services they need. And in his cur
rent budget proposal, Gov. Gray
Davis has advocated slashing gov
ernment-subsidized health benefits.
With the economy in its current
slump, some employers seem reluc
tant to pay any more than they have
to help insure their workforce.
Take General Electric — G.E.'s
health-care costs soared from
$965 million in 1999 to $1.4 bil
lion in 2002. The company recent
ly announced that its employees
would have to pay more for health
insurance to compensate for the
increase.
Under G.E.'s new plan, the av
erage employee would pay as
much as $400 a year in health in
surance co-payments, according to
the AFL-CIO Web site. Some
17,000 G.E. workers went on a
two-day strike this month to
protest the higher premiums but
didn't secure any relief.
Several factors are contributing
to rising costs, including record
spending on medical technology.
The legal environment of hospitals

these days also contributes to high
er costs. For example, hospitals
often order costly extra tests, even
when a doctor doesn't think
they're needed to diagnose a pa
tient. That's because if the hospi
tals get sued, the extra tests would
make their cases stronger.
Balancing the equation
Hospitals can pump more
money into one area, such as staff
pay, at the expense of another. Or,
they can charge more for services.
So, for example, they can charge
$1,000 instead of $900 fora Mag
netic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
attributing the extra costs to the in
creased cost of labor. Or inversely,
they can refuse to give employees
bonuses or pay raises if they want
to spend more on technology.
Teaching hospitals like the
Stanford Hospital are in a unique
ly difficult position because they
spend so much on training new
doctors and providing low-income
care, Enthoven said.
Teaching hospitals account for
only 6 percent of the country's
total hospital beds but provide 39
percent of total low-income care.
The result is an expense of more
than $5.5 billion annually, accord
ing to Anthony L. Barbato, M.D.,
chairman of the board of directors
of the Association of Academic
Health Centers in Washington,
D.C., and president and chief ex
ecutive officer of Loyola University
Health System.
As part of the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, the federal govern
ment cut subsidies for teaching
hospitals, putting many of these
hospitals in the red.
