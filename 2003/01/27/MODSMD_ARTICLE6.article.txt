# Rethinking the "fuzzy" / "techie" boundary
## Stanford Humanities Lab

The best way to convey the in
terdisciplinary nature of the Stan
ford Humanities Laboratory may
be to look at Jeffrey Schnapp, its
founder and director. The former
chair of the University's Depart
ments of French and Italian and
Comparative Literature, Schnapp
speaks six different languages and
is a semi-professional motorcycle
racer. He placed third at the Cali
fornia State Formula Singles
Championship this year.
The laboratory — which in
volves both undergraduate and
graduate students, professors and
library curators — is one-of-a
kind, approaching the humanities
with the same attitude as that of
the natural and social sciences.
"In the first two of the three

major disciplines — natural sci
ences and social sciences — there
are different large-scale, team
based collaborative models,"
Schnapp said. "Humanities are
the exception. They are craft
based.
"What 1 mean by this is the no
tion that, in the humanities, the in
dividual works in isolation, accu
mulating expert knowledge, and
distributes the knowledge through
books. There is no lab."
Schnapp added, "With music,
language and history, you don't
have a place where you actually
study that discipline. It's unusual
for you to produce a small piece of
a larger project whereas in the nat
ural sciences, you do a shard of a
bigger mosaic. In a scientific jour
nal article, yours might be the sixth
name in a row of authors."
Each of the 13 projects that the

laboratory currently supports is
aided not only through funding,
but also through details like exhib
it contract negotiations, methodol
ogy assistance and the creation of
presentations that would "help re
searchers . . . imagine outputs and
results beyond the limits of their
technological familiarity."
The laboratory typically sup
ports projects for five to seven
years.
"We try to reflect critically and
innovatively on not only the pro
duction of knowledge, but also on
the presentation of knowledge,"
Schnapp said. "How do you make
it accessible? How do you make it
interesting?"
The laboratory's vision is to
provide scholars in and outside the
humanities with the tools neces

The new Stanford Humanities Laboratory, founded and directed by Jeffrey Schnapp, seeks to bring the rigor and col
laborative nature of the social and natural sciences to humanities research.
