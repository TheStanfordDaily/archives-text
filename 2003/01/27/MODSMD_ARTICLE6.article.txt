# Rethinking the "fuzzy" / "techie" boundary
## Stanford Humanities Lab 
### MIKEY LEE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The best way to convey the in
terdisciplinary nature of the Stan
ford Humanities Laboratory may
be to look at Jeffrey Schnapp, its
founder and director. The former
chair of the University's Depart
ments of French and Italian and
Comparative Literature, Schnapp
speaks six different languages and
is a semi-professional motorcycle
racer. He placed third at the Cali
fornia State Formula Singles
Championship this year.
The laboratory — which in
volves both undergraduate and
graduate students, professors and
library curators — is one-of-a
kind, approaching the humanities
with the same attitude as that of
the natural and social sciences.
"In the first two of the three

major disciplines — natural sci
ences and social sciences — there
are different large-scale, team
based collaborative models,"
Schnapp said. "Humanities are
the exception. They are craft
based.
"What 1 mean by this is the no
tion that, in the humanities, the in
dividual works in isolation, accu
mulating expert knowledge, and
distributes the knowledge through
books. There is no lab."
Schnapp added, "With music,
language and history, you don't
have a place where you actually
study that discipline. It's unusual
for you to produce a small piece of
a larger project whereas in the nat
ural sciences, you do a shard of a
bigger mosaic. In a scientific jour
nal article, yours might be the sixth
name in a row of authors."
Each of the 13 projects that the

laboratory currently supports is
aided not only through funding,
but also through details like exhib
it contract negotiations, methodol
ogy assistance and the creation of
presentations that would "help re
searchers . . . imagine outputs and
results beyond the limits of their
technological familiarity."
The laboratory typically sup
ports projects for five to seven
years.
"We try to reflect critically and
innovatively on not only the pro
duction of knowledge, but also on
the presentation of knowledge,"
Schnapp said. "How do you make
it accessible? How do you make it
interesting?"

The new Stanford Humanities Laboratory, founded and directed by Jeffrey Schnapp, seeks to bring the rigor and col
laborative nature of the social and natural sciences to humanities research.
sary to do mid- to large-scale col
laborative research projects that
are both interesting and
valuable — something that
Schnapp says is not usually the
case in the field of humanities, es
pecially given the typical hyper
specialization.
"One of our other projects, one
on medieval Spain, deals with three
very different groups of people liv
ing in that time and place—Jews,
Muslims and Christians — and co
existing in dialogue and culture,"
he said. "To study even one of those
cultures requires a demanding set
of skills, like knowing not only Ara
bic, but classical 12th-century Ara
bic. For somebody to be an expert
in all those fields is an overwhelm
ing task that is perhaps impossible."
The laboratory is helping to net
work scholars in the obscure fields
and is providing a server with data
base tools that allows them to sub
mit their contributions to a Web
site. The final product will be a hy

pertextbook that Schnapp says will
provide viewers with the ability to
virtually explore medieval Spain,
complete with its music and walk
throughs of buildings.
"It's a story," Schnapp said. " It's
interactive, but if you want to read
it like a textbook, you can read it
like a textbook."
Schnapp also sees the famous
Stanford "techie versus fuzzy" di
chotomy disappearing and the
laboratory's place in academia be
coming more important.
"I believe [the techie / fuzzy in
stitution] applies only to my gener
ation and maybe to that of a few
years ago," he said. "For [under
graduates] and especially incom
ing freshmen where computing is
part of the framework of their ed
ucation and lives, 1 don't think that
opposition is accurate.
"[The humanities laboratory is]
creating a new kind of techie and a
new kind of fuzzy in the sense that
it gives you a kind of perspective
that's more real-world than just
studying a subject in the tradition
al way. Employers want people
who can write, speak, compute . . .
all of the above."
