# International Spotlight: India
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Karan Mahajan is a sophomore
from New Delhi, India double ma
joring in economics and English. A
former colony of the British Em
pire, India is the world's second
most populated country with
more than one billion people liv
ing within its borders, though ter
ritorially the country is only one
third the size of the United States.
With 16 languages, five major reli
gions and a caste system, India has
had an internal history rife with
both cultural diversity and conflict.
The nation has also experienced a
number of disagreements with its
neighbor Pakistan over matters
such as disputed territories and
nuclear arms.
The Daily asked Mahajan to dis
cuss the major political and social
issues facing his country as he sees
them.
The Daily: How has it been adjust
ing to American culture and life?
Karan Mahajan: The education
system in the United States is ex

tremely different from India, in
the sense that the emphasis is on
the humanities and good writ
ing . .. The humanities in India
are almost looked down upon as
an area for someone who could
not achieve in the sciences.
TD: Since arriving in the United
States, what have you noticed
about Stanford in particular?
KM: Sometimes, [I've observed]
apathy toward the outside world
and that many people are not con
scious of what is going on. Howev
er, I think people are very friendly
and more open than in India.
There is so much diversity in Cali
fornia. You really learn to accept
people for who they are.
TD: What would you say is one of
the most pressing problems India
has at the moment?
KM: The Kashmir problem, or
rather, the feud with Pakistan.
That takes up a lot of India's time
and resources that could go else
where. The problem is that people
are out to justify their actions by in

voking the past. As long as both
sides keep on doing that and keep
trying to make up injustices, there
will be no end to these problems.
TD: Could you elaborate a little
more on the history of the conflict?
KM: Kashmir was given to India
after its independence . . . Kash
mir has a Hindi government but a
Muslim majority. There was an in
vasion by Pakistan anil general dis
pute, but things simmered down
until 1990. The Indian govern
ment has messed up there. The
Pakistani government has also
been involved and has accused
India of human rights issues. We
need a third party to decide the
issue or the mandate of Kashmir
through a plebiscite, [not through]
war, which they have come to four
times within the last 50 years.
TD: How do you think the recent
ascension of both India and Pak
istan to the status of nuclear pow
ers has affected the situation?
KM: Having nuclear power gives
people a sense of great power in

general. [Indians] felt their status
had been lifted from being a mid
dle-of-the-road state to one of the
top 10 states. Pakistan got nuclear
weapons almost at the same time.
It came to a head in December
2001 when there was an attack on
the Indian Parliament house by
Pakistani militants. India built up
militarily and then General [Per
vez] Musharraf said that he be
lieved in the first-use [of nuclear
weapons] doctrine. It is dangerous
that one side is saying that it be
lieves in first-use polities.
TD: How have things changed for
Indians in the U.S., as well as those
in India, since the Sept. 11 attacks?
KM: Post-Sept. 11, combined
with the recession, even though
there are a lot of Indians in the
Bay Area, [the number of Indians
coming to the U.S.] has declined.
People think twice before com
ing. Indian citizens are particu
larly concerned about that. They
have to wait for months and
months for visas. The U.S. is no
