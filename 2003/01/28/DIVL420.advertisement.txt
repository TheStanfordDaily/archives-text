DR. TATIANA'S
SEX ADVICE
TO ALL CREATION
Olivia Judson
Finally, a how-to guide, in the
guise of a Q&A advice column, for
marching, flying, or slithering
into the battle of the sexes, what
ever your species. In this enter
taining and informative book,
evolutionary biologist Olivia
Judson presents "letters"from
sexually frustrated animals, birds,
and insects who ask "Dr. Tatiana"
to explain some
sexual oddity. For example,
"Don't Wanna Be Butch in
Botswana" writes, "I'm a spotted
hyena, a girl. The only trouble is,
I've got a large phallus. I can't
help feeling that this is unlady
like. What's wrong with me?"
Each question leads Dr. T. into a
fascinating explanation about the
sex life of this species, sprinkled
with sprightly stories about other
species with similar attributes or
behavior. You'll also ponder
human sexuality when you learn
that "monogamy is one of the
most deviant behaviors in biolo
gy" (although jackdaws, chinstrap
penguins, California mice, and
some termites swear by it) and
"natural selection, it seems, often
smiles on strumpets."
