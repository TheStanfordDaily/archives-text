Producer and director of 9/11 documentary to
lead discussion
This evening's screening of "Why U.S? An insightful look at the 9/11
tragedy and what makes the United States a target" will be followed by a
discussion led by the film's producer, Cody Shearer, and director, Daniel
Lindsay. The event, which is free and open to the public, is co-sponsored
by Bursting the Bubble, the Society for International Affairs at Stanford
and the Stanford Association for International Development. It will be
held this evening at 7 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The film began as a project aiming to capture the reactions of ordi
nary Americans to the Sept. 11 attacks and seeks to answer the questions
asked by many of the people interviewed, "Why us?" Washington D.C.-
based journalist Shearer and Lindsay, a recent graduate from the Uni
versity of Missouri, met by chance in August 2001, and following Sept.
11, made a cross-country drive to New York and conducted interviews
along the way.
"We got in the car with cameras," Shearer said. "We headed across
America from L.A. to Ground Zero, capturing the reactions of main
stream Americans."
Lindsay, who directed the film, said that the film has taken him in a
different direction than he initially expected. When he moved to L.A., he
was planning to get a graduate degree in film studies at USC. The film
was his first work in documentary film.
"It's been an amazing experience to open my eyes to a lot of the is
sues," Lindsay said.
Because of Shearer's 30-year background and connections as a jour
nalist, the project was expanded to include interviews with prime min
isters, politicians and scholars. Shearer and Lindsay are currently going
around the country showing their film at various universities. They
hope to get people talking about the 9/11 tragedy and American foreign
policy.
"We expect to have a healthy discussion," Shearer said. "Needless to
say, it's a crucial time to commence this debate."

1998, seeks young Americans with academic excellence, leadership and
community service. The scholarship is named for the former U.S. sena
