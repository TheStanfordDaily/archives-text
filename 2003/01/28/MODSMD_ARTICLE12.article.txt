## Bush to make case for Iraq war tonight 
### 
A.
WASHINGTON (AP) —Pres-
ident Bush will outline his case
against Saddam Hussein in
tonight's State of the Union ad
dress, balancing tough talk on
Iraq with a domestic policy agen
da that includes a new plan to di
rect drug treatment money to re
ligious groups.
Pushing a new plank in his
"faith-based initiative," Bush
planned to ask Congress for
$200 million next fiscal year for
vouchers to people seeking
drug treatment. The vouchers
would allow them to seek help at
any treatment center, including
those with religious approaches,
two senior White House officials
said.
The plan is sure to be contro
versial because many religious
drug treatment programs do not
employ medical approaches and

do not use staff that have been li
censed for this work.
The officials, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said Bush
also planned to propose a signifi
cant increase in spending on re
search into development of hydro
gen fuel-cell cars.
Both initiatives were previewed
by advisers as they sought to high
light aspects of his budget blue
print that might prove attractive to
moderate voters.
Bush wants to show Americans
that his White House can focus on
problems at home while fighting
war abroad. His agenda also in
cludes massive tax cuts, Medicare
reform, prescription drugs for the
elderly, health insurance for small
businesses and other new initia
tives that help religious groups
provide federally funded commu
nity services.
