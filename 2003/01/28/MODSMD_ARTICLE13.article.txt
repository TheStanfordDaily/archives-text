# North Korean govt. rejects U.N. nuclear agency

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea
ordered the U.N. nuclear agency to keep out of
its business yesterday, a scornful diatribe that
came as top North and South Korean officials
held cordial talks on resolving Pyongyang's nu
clear crisis.
Moving ahead with Seoul's diplomatic offen
sive, South Korea's presidential envoy met with
a close confidant of reclusive North Korean
leader Kim Jong II — and there was specula
tion that he and other envoys could meet with
Kim himself in the coming days.
Washington has supported Seoul's efforts

and has widely sought international interven
tion in the dispute. It also has pushed to take
the issue to the U.N. Security Council, which
could increase pressure on the impoverished
North with sanctions.
But the U.N. nuclear agency had indefinite
ly postponed a meeting of its 35-nation board to
decide on Security Council intervention, at
Seoul's request. South Korea feared such a
meeting would derail its current diplomatic
trip by enraging Pyongyang.
The North has said it would consider U.N.
sanctions an act of war, and yesterday issued a

diatribe against lAEA chief Mohamed Elßa
radei, calling him a "poor servant and mouth
piece" of the United States.
The lAEA is biased and should have no
role in trying to resolve the standoff, the
North said.
"It is, therefore, an objective reality that
the secretariat of the lAEA is not in a posi
tion to discuss the DPRK's issue," the
North's official news agency said in its dis
patch, using the acronym for the Democrat
ic People's Republic of Korea, the North's
official name.
