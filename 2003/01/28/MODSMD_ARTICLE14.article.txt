# Turkey allows U.S. to use its bases
## Decision on Iraq war could come next week 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Bush administration moved
steadily yesterday toward a mili
tary showdown with Iraq and sug
gested a decision could come as
early as next week after U.N. in
spectors credited Iraq with only
limited cooperation in the search
for weapons.
President Bush and his senior
advisers refused to tip their hand
on when the United States might
go to war to force Iraq to disarm.
But Secretary of State Colin Powell
set out a scenario to bring the tug
of-war with President Saddam
Hussein to a conclusion.
"What we can't do is just keep
kicking the can down the road in
the absence of a change in policy
and attitude" in Baghdad, Pow
ell said at a State Department
news conference, even though
he acquiesced to additional U.N.
inspections.
"We will have our discussions
and consultations this week, and
then we will announce next steps
at an appropriate time," he said.
The Pentagon pushed ahead
with war preparations that would
position more than 150,000 troops
and four aircraft carrier battle
groups, each with more than 70
warplanes, in the Persian Gulf re
gion by the end of February.
In a significant step, the Penta
gon concluded an arrangement
with the Turkish government to
permit up to 20,000 U.S. troops

to use bases in Turkey fora po
tential ground invasion into
northern Iraq, a senior Defense
Department official said. Turkey,
a valued ally in the 1991 U.S.-led
war with Iraq to liberate Kuwait,
had taken an ambivalent stance
this time.
The administration's strategy
calls for agreement to possibly a
few more weeks of inspections as
Powell, U.N. Ambassador John
Negroponte and other American
diplomats lobby the 14 other
members of the Security Council
to implement the "serious conse
quences" the Council threatened
Iraq with in November.
Germany is dead-set against
going to war. France, Russia and
others are skeptical that a case for
war has been made.
On Capitol Hill, Senate Demo
cratic leader Tom Daschle of lowa
said Monday, "If we have proof of
nuclear and biological weapons,
why don't we show that proof to
the world — as President
Kennedy did 40 years ago when
he sent Adlai Stevenson to the
United Nations to show the world
U.S. photographs of offensive
missiles in Cuba?"
To bolster the U.S. case, the
United States intends to provide
the inspectors with additional evi
dence to support its claim Saddam
has hidden thousands of chemical
and biological weapons in palaces,
mosques and private homes.
