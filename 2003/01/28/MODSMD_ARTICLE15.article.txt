## The
						Stanford Daily Supreme court copyright decision is flawed 
### 
Published Since JB9l

Less than two weeks ago, the Supreme
Court decided the case of Eldred v.
Ashcroft by upholding the Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998,
which extended individual and corporate copy
right terms an additional 20 years. The decision
prevents many notable works, including "Steam
boat Willie," from entering the public domain.
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig led the legal
team that argued against the constitutionality of the
Copyright Term Extension Act before the Supreme
Court. We applaud Prof. Lessig for his great dedi
cation in advocating the protection of the public do
main, his spirited arguing of the case before the
Supreme Court, and his honorable representation
of Stanford students, faculty and alumni.
We agree with Prof. Lessig that the Constitu
tional language of "limited Times" neither con
strues infinite and opportunistic extensibility, nor
that extending the duration of the copyright privi
lege for the eleventh time since 1962 "promote[s]
the Progress of Science and useful Arts." Copyright
is a legal monopoly, yet we believe the court failed

to understand the point at which a monopoly ceas
es to benefit both the individual and society, and
benefits only the individual. In adhering to a strict
reading of the Constitution, the court affirmed the
late Sonny Bono's timeserving legislation of 1998
over the much higher and enduring vocation of ju
risprudence.
As the case made its way to the Supreme Court,
the issue was portrayed as a batde between Silicon
Valley and Hollywood, of "Geeks vs. Glitterati," in
the words of Newsweek. While this characterization
might err toward sensationalism, we believe it re
veals two substantial messages for Stanford stu
dents, especially those seeking to become leaders in
high-tech industries.
The first is that the computing industry must
become more politically astute and well connect
ed. On one hand, computing technology has
flourished in a culture of independence and self
direction, a disposition that has been crucial to its
seemingly limitless creativity and productivity.
Yet this characteristic has left the industry isolated
politically. The entertainment industry, on the

other hand, is one of the most politically plugged
in groups in the country, having for decades won
controversial court cases regarding their intellec
tual property. By the entertainment industry's
total mastery of the dramatic art — that of making
the audience believe that which is palpably untrue
— it is able to express this art beyond studio or
sound stage. It regularly recreates the experiences
of its blockbusters in real-life courtrooms, offices
of government leaders and closed-door negotia
tions. While the entertainment industry creates a
convincing virtual reality by means of circus tent
technology, the computer industry's mastery of
semiconductivity and integrated-circuit technolo
gy yields a virtual reality that is manifestly ersatz
and soon tossed into the garbage.
The second message is that the Internet has little
mass appeal without content, and that high-tech in
dustry owns very little content. Although engineers
and programmers developed the means and the
compression techniques that facilitate an unprece
dented flow of content, they have failed to extract any
substantial economic benefit. The entertainment in

dustry, on the other hand, exploits new technologies
to its benefit, convincing consumers every few years
to spend thousands of dollars replacing their enter
tainment libraries so they may have enhanced enter
tainment experiences.
At one time the cowboys of the Internet
promised a vast open range, where the masses
would be free to explore a landscape capable of
nurturing all forms of content. Yet market and
legal forces, such as the demise of Napster, and the
vigorous court tests of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act by the entertainment industry,
have tempered that fulfillment. Stanford students
wishing to ensure that their technological prod
ucts will not be further curtailed in the uses for
which they were envisioned must fundamentally
reconsider their posture toward content and
politics. They must aggressively pursue a relation
ship with the entertainment industry that allows
some control over content, whose widespread
distribution and monopoly profits would be all
but impossible without progress of science and
useful arts.
