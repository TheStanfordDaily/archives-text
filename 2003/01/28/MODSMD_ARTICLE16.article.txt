# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## Geek pride 
### 
This weekend has reminded me
that I'm a geek. It's not like I've
forgotten, andiCs not like I try to
hide it. The multitude of com
puters and computer parts covering my
desk gives most people a fairly accurate
first impression of me. But sometimes, just
sometimes, it'd be nice to forget about
being a geek and all the negative connota
tions that come with it.
I went to my first frat party this week
end. I feel like I've just discovered an alien
culture. I'd been trying to get people to ex
plain to me what makes a party qualify as
"good." They all seem to have the same el
ements — booze, music and people. So
what makes one lame?
I learned a long time ago, back when the

freshmen dorms in
Wilbur were experi
menting with throwing
their parties, that achiev
ing a critical mass of peo
ple is key, but as far as I
could guess frats don't
have that problem. No
one expects those parties
to be lame in the same
way they expect the silly

freshman parties to be lame.
On the way to KA, I had the theory of
party relativity explained to me in simple
terms. At a party of a decent size, the ex
perience of each person differs based on
their "success" that night. "Success"
meaning anything from getting to dance
with a girl to getting to hook up with a
girl. There are two essential skills need
ed to pull off a successful night of party
ing. One is the ability to socialize and the
other is the ability to dance.
I stood on the dance floor and watched
my friends try to dance their way up to two
girls and utterly fail. I watched guys try to
figure out where to focus their eyes when
dancing alone, and these were guys, most
ly white, like myself, who have an inability
to dance at all. There is nothing worse
than feeling uncomfortable on a dance
floor.
It's even worse when your friends
point out a girl you should go after. You
feel sheepish about it, see some guy
seemingly dancing like a spaz, and, a
minute later, they're grinding like ani
mals. How does this all work? It mystifies
me. I still have yet to test out the theory
that alcohol makes it easier. I tried to
dance, but once I realized how silly I
looked, I stopped. The dance floor isn't
where I belong. I have no rhythm. It's
been confirmed. At some point in the
past few years I've even lost the ability to
clap in unison in a crowd. When truly
forced on to the dance floor against my
will, I need to rely on my education from
the Center for Talented Youth, also
known as nerd camp.
I can do the "CTY Dance" in which I
somewhat rhythmically bend my knees
in time to the music. At CTY dances, all

the geeks and nerds and four-eyes and
spazzes and dorks would stand around
in. big circles and bend our knees. It
worked. And then when "It's the end of
the world as we know it" came on, we'd
all run around like crazy and then go
home and call it a good night. I haven't
progressed much since then. The bend
ing the knees thing I can do, but then I
notice all these people around me mov
ing their feet and using their arms, and
as soon as I try to integrate that into my
dance repitoire, everything falls apart,
and I realize it's time to take my rightful
place on the sidelines of mainstream so
cial life.
Sure I can socialize. I do it all the
time. It's a requirement of living in a
dorm. I can do introductions and make
chit-chat and small talk, and sometimes
I can even flirt with girls when I'm feel
ing brazen enough.
These aren't skills that come naturally
to me. It's taken me years to build them up
to this point, but it all comes crashing
down as soon as I find myself in the vicini
ty of a party. I don't know when everyone
else acquired these skills; maybe I missed
it when I opted to watch anime with my
friends on Friday nights during high
school. The day after the frat party was the
Super Bowl. I don't care about the Super
Bowl. I might have cared if the Jets had
been playing. That's my Queens, N.Y.,
pride (even if they do play in New Jersey),
but they weren't. So the only thing that got
me excited was the trailer for the new "Ma
trix" movies. Slip-ups like these are re
minding me that the geek inside wants
out. (See: http://www.ernestcline.com/air
wolf/, trust me, it's funny).
People try to console me. They remind
me that I can write, interact in social situa
tions and had a girlfriend. I like to
rollerblade and bike long distances, and
my skin isn't pale and pasty. All very atyp
ical features of a geek. But that's all super
ficial. Underneath it all, there's a geek.
The mop of hair is just a cover. Just be
neath the surface is a guy who has the urge
to spend sleepless nights hunched over a
laptop surrounded by empty cans of Jolt
and listening to the "Matrix" soundtrack.
I'd rather spend a night watching re
runs of the campy BBC-TV production of
the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"
and going MST3k on it. I'm not sleeping
until I unlock all the secret characters in
"Soul Caliber" and their third outfits. I
need to have a recording of every Radio
head concert ever performed on my com
puter. I want enough monitors on my
desk that the radiation from them gives
my skin the healthy glow that I can nor
mally only get from being outside.
I am a geek, and that's nothing to be
ashamed of.

I stood on the dance floor and watched
my friends try to dance their way up to two
girls and utterly fail. I watched guys try to
figure out where to focus their eyes when
dancing alone, and these were guys, most
ly white, like myself, who have an inability
to dance at all. There is nothing worse
than feeling uncomfortable on a dance
floor.
It's even worse when your friends
point out a girl you should go after. You
feel sheepish about it, see some guy
seemingly dancing like a spaz, and, a
minute later, they're grinding like ani
mals. How does this all work? It mystifies
me. I still have yet to test out the theory
that alcohol makes it easier. I tried to
dance, but once I realized how silly I
looked, I stopped. The dance floor isn't
where I belong. I have no rhythm. It's
been confirmed. At some point in the
past few years I've even lost the ability to
clap in unison in a crowd. When truly
forced on to the dance floor against my
will, I need to rely on my education from
the Center for Talented Youth, also
known as nerd camp.
I can do the "CTY Dance" in which I
somewhat rhythmically bend my knees
in time to the music. At CTY dances, all

the geeks and nerds and four-eyes and
spazzes and dorks would stand around
in. big circles and bend our knees. It
worked. And then when "It's the end of
the world as we know it" came on, we'd
all run around like crazy and then go
home and call it a good night. I haven't
progressed much since then. The bend
ing the knees thing I can do, but then I
notice all these people around me mov
ing their feet and using their arms, and
as soon as I try to integrate that into my
dance repitoire, everything falls apart,
and I realize it's time to take my rightful
place on the sidelines of mainstream so
cial life.
Sure I can socialize. I do it all the
time. It's a requirement of living in a
dorm. I can do introductions and make
chit-chat and small talk, and sometimes
I can even flirt with girls when I'm feel
ing brazen enough.
These aren't skills that come naturally
to me. It's taken me years to build them up
to this point, but it all comes crashing
down as soon as I find myself in the vicini
ty of a party. I don't know when everyone
else acquired these skills; maybe I missed
it when I opted to watch anime with my
friends on Friday nights during high
school. The day after the frat party was the
Super Bowl. I don't care about the Super
Bowl. I might have cared if the Jets had
been playing. That's my Queens, N.Y.,
pride (even if they do play in New Jersey),
but they weren't. So the only thing that got
me excited was the trailer for the new "Ma
trix" movies. Slip-ups like these are re
minding me that the geek inside wants
out. (See: http://www.ernestcline.com/air
wolf/, trust me, it's funny).
People try to console me. They remind
me that I can write, interact in social situa
tions and had a girlfriend. I like to
rollerblade and bike long distances, and
my skin isn't pale and pasty. All very atyp
ical features of a geek. But that's all super
ficial. Underneath it all, there's a geek.
The mop of hair is just a cover. Just be
neath the surface is a guy who has the urge
to spend sleepless nights hunched over a
laptop surrounded by empty cans of Jolt
and listening to the "Matrix" soundtrack.
I'd rather spend a night watching re
runs of the campy BBC-TV production of
the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"
and going MST3k on it. I'm not sleeping
until I unlock all the secret characters in
"Soul Caliber" and their third outfits. I
need to have a recording of every Radio
head concert ever performed on my com
puter. I want enough monitors on my
desk that the radiation from them gives
my skin the healthy glow that I can nor
mally only get from being outside.
I am a geek, and that's nothing to be
ashamed of.

This weekend has reminded me
that I'm a geek. It's not like I've
forgotten, andiCs not like I try to
hide it. The multitude of com
puters and computer parts covering my
desk gives most people a fairly accurate
first impression of me. But sometimes, just
sometimes, it'd be nice to forget about
being a geek and all the negative connota
tions that come with it.
I went to my first frat party this week
end. I feel like I've just discovered an alien
culture. I'd been trying to get people to ex
plain to me what makes a party qualify as
"good." They all seem to have the same el
ements — booze, music and people. So
what makes one lame?
I learned a long time ago, back when the

freshmen dorms in
Wilbur were experi
menting with throwing
their parties, that achiev
ing a critical mass of peo
ple is key, but as far as I
could guess frats don't
have that problem. No
one expects those parties
to be lame in the same
way they expect the silly

freshman parties to be lame.
On the way to KA, I had the theory of
party relativity explained to me in simple
terms. At a party of a decent size, the ex
perience of each person differs based on
their "success" that night. "Success"
meaning anything from getting to dance
with a girl to getting to hook up with a
girl. There are two essential skills need
ed to pull off a successful night of party
ing. One is the ability to socialize and the
other is the ability to dance.
I stood on the dance floor and watched
my friends try to dance their way up to two
girls and utterly fail. I watched guys try to
figure out where to focus their eyes when
dancing alone, and these were guys, most
