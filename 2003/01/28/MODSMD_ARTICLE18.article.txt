'Watch your bike at Sunken Diamond'
Following the baseball game at
Sunken Diamond yesterday, I emerged
about 3:30 p.m. to Find my bike had
been stolen. I had locked my bike to one
of the bike racks near the ticket windows
with a braided-steel chain-lock. At the
same moment a 12 to 14-year-old boy
who had just left the stadium also was
complaining that his locked bike also
was gone. I searched the entire area
carefully but without any luck — my
bike was not there.
In semi-denial, I went back this morn
ing and searched the bike-rack area at
Sunken Diamond again but did not find
my bike. I then drove around the park
ing lot about to return home when I
spotted a bike that looked like mine in a
bike rack at the southeast corner of the
concrete rotunda in front of Stanford
stadium.
The bike was mine with the cut chain
carefully placed around the bike and
rack to give it the appearance of being se
cured to the rack. Next to my bike in the
rack was a child-sized bike similarly
"locked" in place. I recovered my bike —
I kept the cut-chain as a souvenir — and
reported the whereabouts of the other
bike to the Stanford Police, who recov
ered it immediately.
They subsequently found the owner
of that bike, not the young boy I saw at
the Sunken Diamond but a third victim
of bike theft yesterday. Officer Bates of
the Stanford Police suggest that this
was probably a staged bike-theft oper
ation — the bike is taken one day and

moved to a pick-up point for collection
the next day.
So, watch your bike around Sunken
Diamond — a patrolled bike-parking
area like the one available at football
games would solve that aspect of the
problem. I also learned a personal lesson
— after 30-plus years of securing my bike
around campus with a braided-steel
chain-lock, I am switching to a Kryp
tonite bar lock. Finally, if your bike is
taken, search the area; it may be hidden
in another bike rack waiting for later
pick-up.

Graduate student 'disgusted' by
Peker's letter
I am writing this letter in response to
Boris Peker's Jan. 27 letter ("Graduate
student 'disgusted' by editorial"). I have
to say that I am disgusted by the very
idea that he would write a letter like that.
The purpose of an editorial is to let peo
ple know the board's opinions without
trying to compile a list of facts. Students,
especially graduate students, should be
able to calculate their own dynamical
conception of fact.
A letter's job regarding any con
tentious issue is to provide your point
of view. You should use the fuzziness
of putting ideas into context, and
foggy concepts such as morals and be
lief systems to get your personal opin
ions across.

You don't got into the fact that the
"objective" of a newspaper is to homog
enize perspective. You don't talk about
the fact that any finite set of particulars
is a distortion of the completeness of
truth.
Peker has poorly selected facts and is
using them to dispute editorial opinions.
I understand that we are supposed to
be very busy graduate students, but, in
order to achieve a quality graduate stu
dent experience, I think that it is great
that we have the time to read The Stan
ford Daily and send our diatribes to the
editors.
