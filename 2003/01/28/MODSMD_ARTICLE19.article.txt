## Jewish refugees from Arab countries: The forgotten refugees 
### 
The 2,500 year history of Jews living
in what is now the Arab world has
come to an end, but the tale will
never be a forgotten one. The emerging
generation in the Arab world has no mem
ory of living alongside Jews, facilitating
anti-Semitic demonization. Thejews from
the Arab world are known as Mizrahi Jews,
meaning "from the East." We are the Mid
dle East's forgotten refugees. This article
has been written by two Jews — one who
fled Egypt in 1952 for America, and one
born in America to parents who lied Egypt
in the 1960s.
Tonight at 7 p.m., in Bldg. 380-380C, a
pair of Jewish refugees from the Arab
world will share their stories and their
hopes for peace, in a talk entitled "Love is
Stronger than Hate."
