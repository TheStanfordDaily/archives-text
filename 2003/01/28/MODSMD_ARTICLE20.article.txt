# The
						legacy of the refugees
## 
### MORRIS COHEN STANFORD-ISRAEL ALLIANCE 
The Arab-Israeli conflict produced
two refugee groups, Palestinian and Jew
ish, yet world attention has largely fo
cused on the Palestinian refugees. The
reason is that Israel solved the Jewish
refugee problem by resettling them.
Meanwhile, the Arab world has not ade
quately responded to the Palestinian
refugee problem, refusing to permanent
ly resettle enough of them, and using
them as political pawns against Israel.
Both refugee groups numbered about
900,000. Though many were peaceful or
passive, many Palestinian refugees were

openly hostile and violent against the no
tion of any Jewish state. In contrast, Jews
in the Arab world identified themselves
with their respective countries and posed
no threat to them.
Jews have lived throughout what are
now Arab countries since biblical times,
many hundreds of years before Islam ar
rived. For example, the Iraqi and Persian
Jewish communities elate back to the sixth
century 8.C.E., when Nebuchadnezzar
destroyed the first Holy Temple in
Jerusalem, and Jews fled to Babylonia. Ju
daism's most authoritative law book, the
Talmud, was written there.
The conquest of the entire region by
the Arab-Islamic armies from the Arabi
an Peninsula in the seventh century C.E.
established a new order. Under Islamic
law, Jews were accorded "tolerated mi
nority" status as "people of the book,"
but Jews were also treated as second-class
citizens, subordinate to the Muslim-ma
jority occupiers. Over the next 1,300
years, the comparative treatment of Jews
varied greatly from country to country,
depending on the local conditions and
the specific rulers.
But the presence of Jews in the Arab
world all came to an end in the 20th cen
tury. There were nearly a million Jews liv
ing throughout the Arab world in 1948,
the year Israel was born. Today there are
no more than 10,000. The establishment
of Israel provided an excuse for Arab gov
ernments to view "Jews," "Zionists," and
"Israelis" as one and the same, a trend
which has become the norm in the Arab
press and academia right up until today.
Jews were therefore mistreated and ex

pelled, until nearly all had left by 1970.
They fled leaving their homes, friends,
communities and lives behind them. They
lost everything.
Two-thirds of the expelled Jews fled
to Israel, where refugees now form the
majority of the Jewish population. The
remainder were scattered around the
world. Arab propagandists try to portray
Israel as a European colony, but in reali
ty, Israel is a nation whose vast majority
today is completely indigenous to the
Middle East. For millions of expelled
Mizrahi Jews around the world, Israel is
the connection to a many-century-old
Middle Eastern heritage. When you
have been cast off by Egypt, Morocco or
Iraq, what else can you do to show your
Middle Eastern roots but hold up an Is
raeli flag?
Jews from the Arab world have no de
sire to return to their birthplaces, where
anti-Semitism still runs rampant. They
simply want justice and acknowledge
ment. They want an end to decades of de
nial by the Arab world. They want a return
of Torah scrolls and religious artifacts
gathering dust in the synagogues. They
want compensation for stolen property
and recognition by the world community
of a refugee problem that was solved by
pragmatism, not idealism. Jews from the
Arab world will never relinquish their ties
to the region, nor will they ever forget the
importance of Israel in maintaining these
ties, now and forever.
