# Memories of an Egyptian Jew
## 
### JOSEPH ABDEL WAHED JEWS INDIGENOUS TO THE MIDDLE EAST NORTH AFRICA 
My name is Joseph Abdel Wahed. I
am an Egyptian Jew, and my father and
his father were also Egyptian Jews. In
fact, Jewish presence in Egypt goes back
to Biblical times, or more than 3,000
years ago. We are indigenous to Egypt
just like the Native American is indige
nous to America.
I was born in Heliopolis, a suburb of
Cairo, in 1936. Growing up in Egypt
evokes many different, and often contra
dictory, feelings. I have vivid memories of
the Pyramids, the Nile, majestic and
grand, my school friends and neighbors,
and a strong Jewish community with a
rich and proud heritage. I remember also
our spacious villa. My room had a balcony
overlooking a beautiful garden, filled with
flowers, orange, lemon and fig trees. Ev
erywhere there was sun, hence the name
of my town, Heliopolis, or "City of the
Sun" in Greek. Cairo at the time was a
very cosmopolitan city inhabited by peo
ple of many ethnicities and religions.
From them I learned tolerance, respect
and the importance of human rights. All
in all, it was a very interesting and exciting
time for me.
Unfortunately, there are less pleasant
memories still lingering in my deep sub
conscious. I call that the dark side. It con
sisted of a nagging fear for our lives
caused by an undercurrent of anti-
Semitism and xenophobia. I especially re

member the large-scale riots when for
eigners and Jews were singled out, killed
or assaulted. From 1945 onward, bomb
ings killing many Jewish people rocked
the Jewish part of Cairo, the Haret el
Yahud. I remember signs, which read:
"The Jew is the dog of the Arab." Our jan
itor, kind and gentle, taught me to say to
anyone who tried to beat me up: "I am a
Muslim, and I believe in one God." This,
and my Arabic-sounding name, Abdel
Wahed, gave me some measure of protec
tion every time I went out in the street.
It is essential to understand that Egypt,
at the time, went through major changes
caused by Islamic fundamentalism, strong
feelings of nationalism, and the challenge
from the birth of Israel. Together, these
forces brought a great deal of anger and
hatred toward Jews. All Jews were brand
ed as Zionists and thus an enemy of the
state. Laws were passed that made it diffi
cult for us to qualify for work. Jewish busi
nesses were confiscated, and their owners
put in prison on trumped-up charges. My
own family was among them, and we had
to flee and find refuge in another country.
When all is said and done, Egyptian
Jews were forced out of their land of birth
simply because of their identity. Of the
nearly 80,000 Jews who lived there in
1945, less than 50 remain. In the common
parlance of today, this is called "ethnic
cleansing." Most people don't know any
thing about history or about the other one
million Jews who also were brutally ex
pelled from nine Arab countries.
But I still believe in miracles. Some day,
Jewish refugees from Arab lands will walk
hand in hand with Palestinian refugees.
