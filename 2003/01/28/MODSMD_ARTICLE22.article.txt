## Picturing peacemakers

The men and women who work tirelessly to
bring peaceful resolution to international con
flict are celebrated in the new "Architects of
Peace" exhibition on display atTresidder Union
until Feb. 28.
"I'm really excited about this," said Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of meeting services. "It's an
extraordinary piece of work." Smith-Laws esti
mates that the exhibit is currently visited by 400
people each day.
The centerpiece of the exhibit is a collection of
42 photographs by native San Franciscan
Michael Collopy, son of internationally ac
claimed graphic artist George Collopy. Pub
lished worldwide, Collopy has gained recogni
tion for his commissioned portraits of hundreds
of public figures.
Collopy selected the images from a collection
of 75 works focusing on international advocates
of peace featured in his book "Architects of
Peace; Visions of Hope in Words and Images."
Many of the photographs are of renowned
Nobel Peace Prize laureates, such as Shimon
Peres and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, though
Collopy also singled out lesser-known subjects.
The collection includes several luminaries from
the arts and entertainment industry, such as
Steven Spielberg, Carlos and Deborah Santana,
Robert Redford and Maya Angelou.
One particularly striking group of images
shows the face, hands and feet of Mother There
sa, in three separate photographs placed togeth
er. Having worked many times with Mother
Theresa, Collopy finally released his collection,
"Works of Love are Works of Peace" in 1996, a
project which later inspired him to publish "Ar
chitects of Peace."
The exhibit results from six months of collab
orative work between Collopy and the Fund for

Peace Initiatives, Paintbrush Diplomacy, the
Haas Center for Public Service, the Hoover In
stitute Library and Archives, the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Papers Project and the United Nations
Association Film Festival.
"Seeing the exhibition is a very rewarding ex
perience," said Kathleen Morrison, who served
as the main project coordinator at the Universi
ty and enlisted the involvement of the other
Stanford partners. Morrison has also worked as
associate director of the Center for Latin Ameri
can Studies for the past 12 years.
Production costs for the exhibition amounted
to $51,000, the majority of which came from pri
vate donations and sponsorship from Baccharis
Capital, Inc.
Les DeWitt, who has worked for nonprofit or
ganizations and educational projects for the last
15 years and established Fund for Peace Initia
tives specifically to raise money for the exhibit,
said that he wanted to reach out to students and
educate them about peacemakers.
"People come in, and they are so moved by
what they see. This is an exhibition that touches
them deeply," said DeWitt, who hopes to see the
exhibit move on to other educational sites and
local community centers.
Among the other works displayed is a
small selection of letters, writings and materi
als from the vast peace collections at the
Hoover Institution.
"There were just so many phenomenal works
representing peace that it really was very difficult
to choose," said Cecille D. Hill, exhibits coordi
nator at the Hoover Institution.
One of the exhibits featured is the facsimi
le of a letter written in 1915 by activist Jane
Adams to David Starr Jordan, the first presi
dent of Stanford and a prominent peace ac
tivist. Another is a letter written by Mohandas
Gandhi in 1939 to Polish Statesman Ignacy J.

Paderewski. In earlier correspondence,
Paderewski had asked Gandhi to issue a press
statement condemning the invasion of Poland
by Hitler.
There is also a selection of works borrowed
from the permanent collection of Paintbrush
Diplomacy, which was founded by Char and
Rudy Pribuss of San Mateo in 1975 and com
prises artworks by over 14,000 children in 80
countries. One piece, entitled, "Scream of Sep
tember" by 16-year-old Hanzlica Tonac from
the Czech Republic, displays the harrowing
scene of the 9/11 events.
"It just shows you that children are cognizant
all over the world of what happened," DeWitt
said. "And people come back again and again.
The exhibit is just packed with little things if you
really study it."
Morrison believes that with the buildup to
military action in Iraq, the timing of the exhibit
is appropriate.
"I can think of no better time to have an ex
hibition like this," said Morrison, who hopes to
establish funds for ongoing peace activities at
Stanford.
"Many students are disillusioned and not op
timistic at this time," he added. "This exhibition
gives them hope and a way of seeing other possi
bilities in the future, through peacemaking."
Many who have already visited the exhibition
praised the works displayed in a book set aside
for comments.
"Thank you for this very important work you
do â€” you are an inspiration," wrote Elizabeth
Kingella in reference to Collopy's photography.
"If every person contributes something big or
small to the effort of peace, it can be achievable in
our lifetime," wrote Janet and Ed Gregory.
Michael Collopy will speak about his work
and the exhibition on Feb. 5 at the Oak West
Lounge in Tresidder from 7:30-9 p.m.
