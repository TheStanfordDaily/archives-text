## Cardinal falls to Arizona, beats ASU Kirk swims to two wins over Kovacs 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anyone in the NCAA would
love to be the one to finally
break Stanford junior Tara
Kirk's unbeaten streak* in the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke.
And if anyone in the N(L\A
could have been the one to do it,
it would have been Arizona
State sophomore Agnes Kovacs,
the 2000 Olympic gold medalist
in the 200-meter breaststroke.

Kovacs got her chance this
weekend, but couldn't outrace
Kirk, who is the defending
NCAA champion and American
record holder in both events.
A pair of wins by Kirk in her
two specialties guided the No. 4
Cardinal (4-2, 1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) to a 159-141 victo
ry over the No. 16 Sun Devils (4-
4, 0-4) in Tempe on Saturday.
That win picked up Stanford's
spirits after the Cardinal
dropped its conference opener
to No. 10 Arizona (6-1, 3-1),
166.5-132.5, in Tucson on Fri
day.
Cardinal coach Richard
Quick was thrilled with the out
come of Kirk's races, and said
that the Ail-American had truly
worked hard to touch the wall
first.

"It was an amazing win for
Tara," Quick said.
Kirk clocked in at 2 minutes,
9.66 seconds in the 200, with
Kovacs trailing by more than
one second. Kovacs also came in
second in the 100 breast, finish
ing almost two seconds behind
her Stanford rival.
Kirk's times were the top in
the nation in the breaststroke
this season.
Despite falling to Arizona, the
Cardinal did record some solid
performances against the Wild
cats. Freshman Dana Kirk swept
her butterfly events against Ari
zona, recording times of 54.71
and 2:00.42 in the 100 and 200,
respectively.
"Dana Kirk did a great job,"
said Quick. "She's really stepped
it up since the beginning of the
season."
Freshman Kristen Caverly
claimed an individual victory in
the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 4:21.59, while
sophomore Lacey Boutwell
clocked in at 23.58 to win the 50
freestyle race.
Despite the Cardinal's ef
forts, the Wildcats managed to
triumph in crucial races. They
won both of the relay events and
both of the backstroke events,
and also captured wins in the
100, 200, 500 and 1,000
freestyle swims.
"Arizona is a good team," said
Quick. "But we could have won
that meet. It's the coach's re

sponsibility to get the athletes
ready to compete at the highest
level, and we just weren't ready to
compete at that level for whatever
reason. We just didn't bring
enough intensity to that competi
tion."
The Stanford swimmers
stepped it up in time to face Ari
zona Slate on Saturday, though. In
addition to Kirk's wins, four other
Cardinal athletes claimed victory
against the Sun Devils.

Dana Kirk repeated her im
pressive Friday performance by
sweeping the butterfly events
again. Boutwell contributed a win
in the 200-yard free, while Caverly
also added two victories to the
team score, one in the 200 back
and another in the 200 IM.
According to Quick, one of the
most impressive wins from the
weekend was sophomore Amy
Wagner's triumph in the 100 back.
Not only did she record a season
best and an NCAA "B" qualifying
time, but she did so with an injury.
"Amy has a bulging disk in her
back. We have to modify her train
ing, and she swims in pain almost

every day," Quick said. "I'm really
pleased with where Amy is right
now."
The Stanford squad also pulled
out a collection of other top-three
finishes, including two third-place
finishes from freshman Ashley
Daly, two second-place finishes
from sophomore Evins Cameron
and a second-place finish from
freshman Anna Strohl.
The Stanford divers also, faced
off against the Sun Devils, and
proved to be crucial assets to the
team score.
Sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal
won the 3-meter diving competi
tion, finishing 13.50 points ahead

of Arizona State's Trisha Tumlin
son. Freshman Michaela Skloven
and senior McKenze Murphy fin
ished third and fourth, respective
ly, in the 3-meter.
Tumlinson managed to edge
out Rosenthal in the 1-meter div
ing event by a margin of less than
five points. Skloven clinched her
second top-three finish of the sea
son by coming in right behind
Rosenthal, and Murphy rounded
out the Cardinal squad with a
fourth-place finish.
The swimming and diving
squads will continue battling their
Pac-10 rivals this weekend at
UCLA and Southern California.

The Stanford swimmers
stepped it up in time to face Ari
zona Slate on Saturday, though. In
addition to Kirk's wins, four other
Cardinal athletes claimed victory
against the Sun Devils.

Dana Kirk repeated her im
pressive Friday performance by
sweeping the butterfly events
again. Boutwell contributed a win
in the 200-yard free, while Caverly
also added two victories to the
team score, one in the 200 back
and another in the 200 IM.
According to Quick, one of the
most impressive wins from the
weekend was sophomore Amy
Wagner's triumph in the 100 back.
Not only did she record a season
best and an NCAA "B" qualifying
time, but she did so with an injury.
"Amy has a bulging disk in her
back. We have to modify her train
ing, and she swims in pain almost

every day," Quick said. "I'm really
pleased with where Amy is right
now."
The Stanford squad also pulled
out a collection of other top-three
finishes, including two third-place
finishes from freshman Ashley
Daly, two second-place finishes
from sophomore Evins Cameron
and a second-place finish from
freshman Anna Strohl.
The Stanford divers also, faced
off against the Sun Devils, and
proved to be crucial assets to the
team score.
Sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal
won the 3-meter diving competi
tion, finishing 13.50 points ahead

of Arizona State's Trisha Tumlin
son. Freshman Michaela Skloven
and senior McKenze Murphy fin
ished third and fourth, respective
ly, in the 3-meter.
Tumlinson managed to edge
out Rosenthal in the 1-meter div
ing event by a margin of less than
five points. Skloven clinched her
second top-three finish of the sea
son by coming in right behind
Rosenthal, and Murphy rounded
out the Cardinal squad with a
fourth-place finish.
The swimming and diving
squads will continue battling their
Pac-10 rivals this weekend at
UCLA and Southern California.
Anyone in the NCAA would
love to be the one to finally
break Stanford junior Tara
Kirk's unbeaten streak* in the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke.
And if anyone in the N(L\A
could have been the one to do it,
it would have been Arizona
State sophomore Agnes Kovacs,
the 2000 Olympic gold medalist
in the 200-meter breaststroke.

Kovacs got her chance this
weekend, but couldn't outrace
Kirk, who is the defending
NCAA champion and American
record holder in both events.
A pair of wins by Kirk in her
two specialties guided the No. 4
Cardinal (4-2, 1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) to a 159-141 victo
ry over the No. 16 Sun Devils (4-
4, 0-4) in Tempe on Saturday.
That win picked up Stanford's
spirits after the Cardinal
dropped its conference opener
to No. 10 Arizona (6-1, 3-1),
166.5-132.5, in Tucson on Fri
day.
Cardinal coach Richard
Quick was thrilled with the out
come of Kirk's races, and said
that the Ail-American had truly
worked hard to touch the wall
first.

"It was an amazing win for
Tara," Quick said.
Kirk clocked in at 2 minutes,
9.66 seconds in the 200, with
Kovacs trailing by more than
one second. Kovacs also came in
second in the 100 breast, finish
ing almost two seconds behind
her Stanford rival.
Kirk's times were the top in
the nation in the breaststroke
this season.
Despite falling to Arizona, the
Cardinal did record some solid
performances against the Wild
cats. Freshman Dana Kirk swept
her butterfly events against Ari
zona, recording times of 54.71
and 2:00.42 in the 100 and 200,
respectively.
"Dana Kirk did a great job,"
said Quick. "She's really stepped
it up since the beginning of the
season."
Freshman Kristen Caverly
claimed an individual victory in
the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 4:21.59, while
sophomore Lacey Boutwell
clocked in at 23.58 to win the 50
freestyle race.
Despite the Cardinal's ef
forts, the Wildcats managed to
triumph in crucial races. They
won both of the relay events and
both of the backstroke events,
and also captured wins in the
100, 200, 500 and 1,000
freestyle swims.
"Arizona is a good team," said
Quick. "But we could have won
that meet. It's the coach's re
