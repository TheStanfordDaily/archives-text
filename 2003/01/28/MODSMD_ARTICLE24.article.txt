### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anyone in the NCAA would
love to be the one to finally
break Stanford junior Tara
Kirk's unbeaten streak* in the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke.
And if anyone in the N(L\A
could have been the one to do it,
it would have been Arizona
State sophomore Agnes Kovacs,
the 2000 Olympic gold medalist
in the 200-meter breaststroke.

Kovacs got her chance this
weekend, but couldn't outrace
Kirk, who is the defending
NCAA champion and American
record holder in both events.
A pair of wins by Kirk in her
two specialties guided the No. 4
Cardinal (4-2, 1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) to a 159-141 victo
ry over the No. 16 Sun Devils (4-
4, 0-4) in Tempe on Saturday.
That win picked up Stanford's
spirits after the Cardinal
dropped its conference opener
to No. 10 Arizona (6-1, 3-1),
166.5-132.5, in Tucson on Fri
day.
Cardinal coach Richard
Quick was thrilled with the out
come of Kirk's races, and said
that the Ail-American had truly
worked hard to touch the wall
first.

"It was an amazing win for
Tara," Quick said.
Kirk clocked in at 2 minutes,
9.66 seconds in the 200, with
Kovacs trailing by more than
one second. Kovacs also came in
second in the 100 breast, finish
ing almost two seconds behind
her Stanford rival.
Kirk's times were the top in
the nation in the breaststroke
this season.
Despite falling to Arizona, the
Cardinal did record some solid
performances against the Wild
cats. Freshman Dana Kirk swept
her butterfly events against Ari
zona, recording times of 54.71
and 2:00.42 in the 100 and 200,
respectively.
"Dana Kirk did a great job,"
said Quick. "She's really stepped
it up since the beginning of the
season."
Freshman Kristen Caverly
claimed an individual victory in
the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 4:21.59, while
sophomore Lacey Boutwell
clocked in at 23.58 to win the 50
freestyle race.
Despite the Cardinal's ef
forts, the Wildcats managed to
triumph in crucial races. They
won both of the relay events and
both of the backstroke events,
and also captured wins in the
100, 200, 500 and 1,000
freestyle swims.
"Arizona is a good team," said
Quick. "But we could have won
that meet. It's the coach's re
