# Bakersfield routs Card wrestlers on home mats

### SCOTT ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team felt
the Oakland Raiders' pain on
Super Bowl Sunday. Just as Bill
Callahan's troops would find them
selves a few hours later, the Cardi
nal was at a disadvantage before
Sunday's dual meet at Cal-State
Bakersfield — pushed back to ac
commodate football fans — even
started.

Sunday: Cal State-Bakersfield 32,
Stanford 12

The Raiders were without All-
Pro center Barret Robbins, the Car
dinal without redshirt sophomore
and NCAA qualifier Brad Metzler.
While the forfeit at Metzler's
spot at 133 did not turn out to be
the difference in the 32-12 Stanford
loss, his absence due to nagging
knee and shoulder injuries was cer
tainly felt.
A week after helping Stanford to
a win over Portland State, Metzler
was once again relegated to t he role
of spectator, spoiling an anticipated
matchup with the Roadrunners'

Matt Sanchez at 133. Metzler beat
Sanc hez earlier this season.
"We decided around Friday that
[Metzler's] nagging injuries just
weren't healed enough yet," Stan
ford head coach Steve Buddie said.
"Had the l'ac-10 Championships
been this weekend, Brad would
have suited up. But at this point, it's
just not worth the risk."
"My pinched-nerve has both
ered me especially, and the knee
will take another three or four
weeks to heal," Metzler said last
week.
Stanford (3-9, 1-4 Pacific-10
Conference) fell behind early after
the Roadrunners' Efren Ceballos,
the No. 2 125-pounder in the I'ac
-10, earned a 17-7 major decision
over junior Nathan Peterson to
open the meet. Ceballos moved to
6-1 in dual meets and 1(5-6 overall,
including six major decisions.
Alter the forfeit at 133 increased
the Bakersfield lead to 11 -0, Antho
ny Baza downed Cardinal junior
Brendon Fox 10-3 at 141.
At 149, Stanford redshirt sopho
more Scott Polley controlled the
bout in the early going, jumping
out to a 6-2 lead after one quarter
against Roberto Vargas. But Var

gas rebounded to tally his first colle
giate pin at 3:11, staking the Road
runners to a 19-0 edge.
The Cardinal finally got on the
board in the next bout, as redshirt
sophomore Matt Gentry remained
perfect in dual meets this season
(10-0) and extended his team-best
record to 23-4 with an 8-6 decision
over Bakersfield's Brian Cobb.
Gentry has not lost a dual meet
to a Pac-10 opponent since his very
first conference meet against Ore
gon in November 2001.
With a chance to get Stanford
hack into the meet at 165, junior
Garrett Johnston lost the lead and

eventually the bout in a tough 9-8
decision to Christian Arellano.
Johnston held a slight 6-5 ad
vantage with 20 seconds remaining
and earned an escape fora 7-5 lead .
But seconds later, Arellano scored a
takedown to knot the match at 7-7
and another with just seven seconds
remaining to pull off the come
from-behind victory.
"Garrett's match was indicative
of something our team needs to
focus on more in practice: mental
toughness," Buddie said. "It's
something we haven't worked on

enough this season, and I certainly
take the blame for that."
Johnston was not the only Cardi
nal grappler to see a lead slip away,
as Stanford held the lead in five of
the six bouts it lost.
The Cardinal would not go qui
edy, as senior Harold Penson post
ed his team-leading fifth pin of the
season at 174, dropping Matt Mon
tiero at 6:16. His five pins equal his
total for the past three seasons com
bined.
Following another Bakersfield
major decision and pin at 184 and
197, respectively, Stanford fresh

man heavyweight Shawn Ritzen
thaler closed out the scoring with an
8-4 decision, his seventh of the sea
son and fourth in dual-meet com
petition.
"We corrected some things tech
nically, which was great to see,"
Buddie said. "Now, we need to sim
plify and out-tough our opponents.
Other than the conditioning and
technical improvements, I've also
been very pleased with Shawn
Ritzenthaler's progress, and it's in
spiring to see Matt win every time
he takes the mat."
Stanford returns to action this
Friday when it hosts Cal Poly at 5:00
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion. The
Cardinal will then take part in the
All Cal Invitational on Saturday in
San Francisco.
