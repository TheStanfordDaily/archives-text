### EMILY KUEHLER 
After opening conference play
with two home losses to Brigham
Young (3-1), traveling to Honolulu
to take on No. 1 Hawaii (1 -1) was the
last thing the No. 11 Stanford men's
volleyball team (1-3) wanted to do.

The Cardinal had not won a
match in Hawaii since its champi
onship season in 1997, but were
able to split matches with the War
riors on Jan. 22 and 24.
"Not only are they the number
one ranked team in the country, but
Hawaii is one of the toughest places
in the nation to play," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "Any team would
be happy to come away from Hon
olulu with just one win."
Stanford fell to the Warriors 3-1
in Wednesday's match, but came
back from two games down to win
Friday's match by a score of 3-2.
Ultimately in Wednesday's
match, Stanford was unable to over
come the duo of Hawaii seniors
Tony Ching and Costas
Theocharidis.
"[Ching and Theocharidis] are
really great hitters," said Shaw.
"When the time comes for them to
rise to the occasion they usually
do."
Theocharidis finished with a

match-high 26 kills, while Ching
had 20.
Both teams came out strong to
begin Wednesday's match, as indi
cated by the nine lead changes in
game one.
With the score tied at 28, it was
only fitting that Theocharidis and
Ching would close out the game for
Hawaii with a kill each.
The loss in game two was all too
familiar for the Cardinal, as the
team could not convert at the end of
the game, squandering a 27-22 lead
to lose the game.
Stanford extended the match
with a victory in game three, but
could not pull out game four, de
spite a four-point lead deep in the
game.
"Wednesday's match was espe
cially disappointing for us," said
Shaw. "If we had been able to stay
focused and execute, we might have
been able to win that match, but we
came away with a four-game loss in
stead."
Despite the team's loss, Shaw was
encouraged by some of the individ
ual play.
On Friday, it seemed as though
the Cardinal was in for yet another
disappointing loss.
Although the score remained
close throughout the first game,
Stanford was never able to take the
lead, allowing Hawaii to take the
game 30-28.
Stanford was able to take an early
12-8 lead in game two, but let it slip
