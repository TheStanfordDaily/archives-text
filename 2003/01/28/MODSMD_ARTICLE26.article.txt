## 
### EMILY KUEHLER 
After opening conference play
with two home losses to Brigham
Young (3-1), traveling to Honolulu
to take on No. 1 Hawaii (1 -1) was the
last thing the No. 11 Stanford men's
volleyball team (1-3) wanted to do.

Friday: Stanford def. Hawaii 28-30,
25-30, 30-27, 30-27, 15-8

The Cardinal had not won a
match in Hawaii since its champi
onship season in 1997, but were
able to split matches with the War
riors on Jan. 22 and 24.
"Not only are they the number
one ranked team in the country, but
Hawaii is one of the toughest places
in the nation to play," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "Any team would
be happy to come away from Hon
olulu with just one win."
Stanford fell to the Warriors 3-1
in Wednesday's match, but came
back from two games down to win
Friday's match by a score of 3-2.
Ultimately in Wednesday's
match, Stanford was unable to over
come the duo of Hawaii seniors
Tony Ching and Costas
Theocharidis.
"[Ching and Theocharidis] are
really great hitters," said Shaw.
"When the time comes for them to
rise to the occasion they usually
do."
Theocharidis finished with a

match-high 26 kills, while Ching
had 20.
Both teams came out strong to
begin Wednesday's match, as indi
cated by the nine lead changes in
game one.
With the score tied at 28, it was
only fitting that Theocharidis and
Ching would close out the game for
Hawaii with a kill each.
The loss in game two was all too
familiar for the Cardinal, as the
team could not convert at the end of
the game, squandering a 27-22 lead
to lose the game.
Stanford extended the match
with a victory in game three, but
could not pull out game four, de
spite a four-point lead deep in the
game.
"Wednesday's match was espe
cially disappointing for us," said
Shaw. "If we had been able to stay
focused and execute, we might have
been able to win that match, but we
came away with a four-game loss in
stead."
Despite the team's loss, Shaw was
encouraged by some of the individ
ual play.
On Friday, it seemed as though
the Cardinal was in for yet another
disappointing loss.
Although the score remained
close throughout the first game,
Stanford was never able to take the
lead, allowing Hawaii to take the
game 30-28.

away, giving Hawaii room to pull
out a 30-25 victory.
"Letting that lead go in game two
was really critical," said Shaw. "Los
ing that game really put us in a
hole."
The hole was even deeper than
the team imagined when it learned
that Toppel had reaggravated a
pulled abdominal muscle midway
through the game.
"[Toppers] already playing with
a fractured thumb," said Shaw. "We
really need to watch him physically
so that he doesn't cause further in
jury that would cause him to miss
considerable time."
Shaw decided to put Toppel
back in for the third game, but he
changed the lineup in case Toppel
suddenly had to come out.
Senior Will Curtis came out so
that he could replace Toppel if nec
essary, sophomore libero David
Vogel replaced Curtis, and sopho
more Jeremy Jacobs replaced Vogel
at libero.
"The change in the lineup made

us a little smaller but it gave us bet
ter ball control," said Shaw. "We
started digging some balls, and Ja
cobs made some key digs and pro
vided a litde spark for us."
The lineup change had an im
mediate effect, leading the Cardinal
to a 30-27 win. Toppel loosened up
throughout the third game, easing
some of Shaw's worries.
Despite Stanford's third-game
turnaround, much of the fourth
game was dominated by Hawaii,
but the Cardinal refused to go
away and battled its way to a 30-
27 victory.
At two games apiece, the match
was up for grabs.
Toppel set the tone for Stanford
with four early kills to put the Car
dinal up 6-2. Hawaii would not get
any closer dian 7-4.
The Cardinal ran away with the
fifth game, ending with an amazing
.846 hitting percentage on 11 kills
and no errors.
"Even though we got away with a
victory, Hawaii is making a pretty
big deal over the loss because they
were without one of their starters,"
said Shaw. "I don't think they know
how strong the conference is yet.
We've already figured that out."

to a 30-27 win. Toppel loosened up
throughout the third game, easing
some of Shaw's worries.
Despite Stanford's third-game
turnaround, much of the fourth
game was dominated by Hawaii,
but the Cardinal refused to go
away and battled its way to a 30-
27 victory.
At two games apiece, the match
was up for grabs.
Toppel set the tone for Stanford
with four early kills to put the Car
dinal up 6-2. Hawaii would not get
any closer dian 7-4.
The Cardinal ran away with the
fifth game, ending with an amazing
.846 hitting percentage on 11 kills
and no errors.
"Even though we got away with a
victory, Hawaii is making a pretty
big deal over the loss because they
were without one of their starters,"
said Shaw. "I don't think they know
how strong the conference is yet.
We've already figured that out."
After opening conference play
with two home losses to Brigham
Young (3-1), traveling to Honolulu
to take on No. 1 Hawaii (1 -1) was the
last thing the No. 11 Stanford men's
volleyball team (1-3) wanted to do.

Wednesday: No. 1 Hawaii def. No. 11

The Cardinal had not won a
match in Hawaii since its champi
onship season in 1997, but were
able to split matches with the War
riors on Jan. 22 and 24.
"Not only are they the number
one ranked team in the country, but
Hawaii is one of the toughest places
in the nation to play," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "Any team would
be happy to come away from Hon
olulu with just one win."
Stanford fell to the Warriors 3-1
in Wednesday's match, but came
back from two games down to win
Friday's match by a score of 3-2.
Ultimately in Wednesday's
match, Stanford was unable to over
come the duo of Hawaii seniors
Tony Ching and Costas
Theocharidis.
"[Ching and Theocharidis] are
really great hitters," said Shaw.
"When the time comes for them to
rise to the occasion they usually
do."
Theocharidis finished with a

match-high 26 kills, while Ching
had 20.
Both teams came out strong to
begin Wednesday's match, as indi
cated by the nine lead changes in
game one.
With the score tied at 28, it was
only fitting that Theocharidis and
Ching would close out the game for
Hawaii with a kill each.
The loss in game two was all too
familiar for the Cardinal, as the
team could not convert at the end of
the game, squandering a 27-22 lead
to lose the game.
Stanford extended the match
with a victory in game three, but
could not pull out game four, de
spite a four-point lead deep in the
game.
"Wednesday's match was espe
cially disappointing for us," said
Shaw. "If we had been able to stay
focused and execute, we might have
been able to win that match, but we
came away with a four-game loss in
stead."
Despite the team's loss, Shaw was
encouraged by some of the individ
ual play.
On Friday, it seemed as though
the Cardinal was in for yet another
disappointing loss.
Although the score remained
close throughout the first game,
Stanford was never able to take the
lead, allowing Hawaii to take the
game 30-28.
Stanford was able to take an early
12-8 lead in game two, but let it slip

Sophomore Craig Buell serves the ball in a match earlier this season. The Car
dinal men's volleyball team rallied in the final three games of its second match
to upset top-seeaed Hawaii in Honolulu this weekend.
away, giving Hawaii room to pull
out a 30-25 victory.
"Letting that lead go in game two
was really critical," said Shaw. "Los
ing that game really put us in a
hole."
The hole was even deeper than
the team imagined when it learned
that Toppel had reaggravated a
pulled abdominal muscle midway
through the game.
"[Toppers] already playing with
a fractured thumb," said Shaw. "We
really need to watch him physically
so that he doesn't cause further in
jury that would cause him to miss
considerable time."
Shaw decided to put Toppel
back in for the third game, but he
changed the lineup in case Toppel
suddenly had to come out.
Senior Will Curtis came out so
that he could replace Toppel if nec
essary, sophomore libero David
Vogel replaced Curtis, and sopho
more Jeremy Jacobs replaced Vogel
at libero.
"The change in the lineup made

us a little smaller but it gave us bet
ter ball control," said Shaw. "We
started digging some balls, and Ja
cobs made some key digs and pro
vided a litde spark for us."
