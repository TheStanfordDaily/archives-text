## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's track teams had a suc
cessful weekend as they officially
opened their indoor season at the
Western Indoor Classic in Boise,
Idaho, on Saturday.
Although not many from Stan
ford's famed distance squad com
peted this weekend, the Cardinal
posted victories in nine events and
walked away with two NCAA pro
visional marks behind the growing
strength of its sprint and field
squads.
In the men's weight throw, se
nior Nick Welihozkiy posted a vic
tory and a qualify ing mark with his
64 foot, 10 inch heave, while in the
women's 60-meter dash, freshman
Jakki Bailey hit a provisional time
with her win in 7.44 seconds.
The men also got victories from
senior Milton Little in the long
jump (24-6.25), sophomore Evan
Fox in the mile (4 minutes, 14.37
seconds) and the distance medley
team (10:21.50).
For the women's squad, the
1,600-meter relay team ran

3:46.14 to win its event, and senior
Kim Stone jumped four inches
higher than her closest competitor
to take the high jump.
"Even though I didn't jump
particularly high, it was good for
an opener," Stone said. "For the
first meet of the year, I am happy
to see progress and excited about
what is in store."
The success in the women's
sprints was not limited to Bailey as
a host of freshmen and experi
enced competitors made their
early marks.
Freshman Ashley Purnell won
the 200-meter dash in 24.16 sec
onds and took second behind Bai
ley in the 60 at 7.66 seconds. Ju
nior Lindseyjohnson, meanwhile,
won the 60-meter hurdles in 8.58
seconds.
Sophomore Christine Moschel
la led three Stanford sprinters into
the top five of the 400-meter dash
with her second-place showing in
56.25 seconds.
In the women's pole vault, the
Cardinal took three of the top six
places as freshman Samantha
Shepard posted a 12-6 vault to
claim second behind world
record holder Stacy Dragila. Se
nior Kathleen Donoghue and ju
nior Leila Ben-Youssef both
cleared 12 feet for fifth and sixth,
respectively.
The Cardinal also got a pair of
thirds from junior Lillian Bush in
the longjump (18-4.25) and junior
[essica Pluth in the weight throw
(58-1.75).
"The meet was really exciting
for the women's team," Stone said.
"It seemed like every time I turned
around, a Stanford lady was taking
a victory lap."
"We decided that we needed to
build a core of women's sprinters
that could score at the Pacific-10
Conference Outdoor Track
Championships," said Vin Lanan
na, director of cross country and
track and field. "Coach [Edrick]
Floreal has done an excellent job
recruiting these girls and building
that squad."
The men's squad, behind four
victories, also had impressive
showings across the board.
Freshman T.J. Rushing posted
a 7.05-second performance in the
60 and claimed fifth in the 200,
coming in at 22.16.
The Cardinal got three second
place showings. Little ran the 60 in
6.95 for second while freshman
Josh Hustedt completed the 60-
hurdles in 8.53 seconds for his sec
ond-place finish. Freshman Steve
DeWitt posted a 4:16.18 mile to
claim second behind Fox.
Freshman Solomon Welch
jumped 47-6.25 in the triple jump
to claim third, and sophomore
Nick Sebes claimed third in the
400-meter dash, finishing in 48.89
seconds. Sebes was also part of the
third-place 1,600-meter relay
team (3:16.92).
"I felt very positive coming out
of the meet in Boise," Sebes said,
"not only for myself, but also be

cause of the great performances
our team displayed in all aspects of
the meet."
"We would like to get a men's
and women's 1,600-meter relay to
the NCAA Championships,"
Lananna said. "We now have a
couple sprinters who have the po
tential to get there on their own or
with a relay."
"Our focus, however, is mainly
on the outdoor Pac-10 Champi
onships," Lananna added. "We

aren't going to race people until
they are ready, and we are hoping
to use indoor to practice being
competitive and use it as a way to
break up the monotony of train
ing."
A host of Ail-Americans from
the Cardinal's distance and throw
ing squads will be making their de
buts this weekend as the Cardinal
continues its indoor action again at
the Husky Indoor Invitational in
Seattle.
