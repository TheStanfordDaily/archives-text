### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's track teams had a suc
cessful weekend as they officially
opened their indoor season at the
Western Indoor Classic in Boise,
Idaho, on Saturday.
Although not many from Stan
ford's famed distance squad com
peted this weekend, the Cardinal
posted victories in nine events and
walked away with two NCAA pro
visional marks behind the growing
strength of its sprint and field
squads.
In the men's weight throw, se
nior Nick Welihozkiy posted a vic
tory and a qualify ing mark with his
64 foot, 10 inch heave, while in the
women's 60-meter dash, freshman
Jakki Bailey hit a provisional time
with her win in 7.44 seconds.
The men also got victories from
senior Milton Little in the long
jump (24-6.25), sophomore Evan
Fox in the mile (4 minutes, 14.37
seconds) and the distance medley
team (10:21.50).
For the women's squad, the
1,600-meter relay team ran

3:46.14 to win its event, and senior
Kim Stone jumped four inches
higher than her closest competitor
to take the high jump.
"Even though I didn't jump
particularly high, it was good for
an opener," Stone said. "For the
first meet of the year, I am happy
to see progress and excited about
what is in store."
The success in the women's
sprints was not limited to Bailey as
a host of freshmen and experi
enced competitors made their
early marks.
Freshman Ashley Purnell won
the 200-meter dash in 24.16 sec
onds and took second behind Bai
ley in the 60 at 7.66 seconds. Ju
nior Lindseyjohnson, meanwhile,
won the 60-meter hurdles in 8.58
seconds.
Sophomore Christine Moschel
la led three Stanford sprinters into
the top five of the 400-meter dash
with her second-place showing in
56.25 seconds.
In the women's pole vault, the
Cardinal took three of the top six
places as freshman Samantha
