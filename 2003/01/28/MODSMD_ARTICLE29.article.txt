# Bucs save Raider fans from self destruction
## 
### 
I'm starting to think that
maybe I should stop bet
ting against the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers. I still
think that Brad Johnson is an
overrated third-string nobody
and that Keyshavyn Johnson
drops more balls than a greased
up prostitute, but I can't bring
myself to say a single bad thing
about that defense. It shut down
Terrell Owens, Donovan McN
abb and Rich Gannon in succes
sive weeks, and all in convincing
fashion.
Warren Sapp and company
deserve all of the accolades and

awards they
piled up this
season. Tampa
proved its su
periority on
Sunday in all
ways but one.
The Bucca
neers will never
overtake the

Raiders in the area of (an riot
ing. Take home all of the Lom
bardi trophies you want, Tampa
Bay. But for every one win you
notch at Oakland's expense, just
know that the Raider Nation
will burn down three buildings.
That will really teach those Bucs
a lesson.
1 mean, nothing says "Don't
tread on me" like committing
random acts of arson on your
own community. I really want to
meet the guy who started the
idea of fan rioting. The thought
process that went on that made
him think that Hipping over a
couple of cars will ensure that
the other team knows that he
means business.
1 seriously doubt that Tampa
Bay, consisting of a population
with an average age of "Dead on
Arrival," has a similarly "dedi
cated" core of fans. Even if you
shipped all the Viagra in the
world down to South Florida,
there still wouldn't be enough
life in that fan base to exhort a
bunch of septuagenarians to set
fire to one of Tampa's finer eat

ing establishments. Like Waffle
House. Or the Shady Oak Re
tirement Home's food court.
I do have to say that I was
rather disappointed with last
night's rioting performance. I
find it ironic that cities are gen
erally more fearful of the after
math of a victory than a loss.
There really is no logical justifi
cation for wanting to burn clown
an additional couple blocks of
Quik-E-Marts and strip malls
when your team wins rather
than loses, but for some reason it
always seems to be true. It's like
kicking the crap out of your dog
to celebrate getting into that re
ally prestigious law school. (By
the way, if anyone knows of a
good veterinarian, I just found
out that I got into Harvard).
I for one would not want to
be an Oakland resident this
morning had the Super Bowl
actually been a close game that
was decided in Tampa's favor
on an errant refereeing deci
sion on the final play. Forget the
L.A. riots, Oakland would still
be burning after next year's
Super Bowl. If I were a cop in
that scenario, I would have just
put down my riot gear and
started looting the nearest
Fry's. Because sometimes, you
just have to know when you're
going to be beaten.
The most unbelievable part
of the rioting in Oakland was the
fact that it seemed as if people
were just sitting around waiting
for the riots to happen. It's not
as if the night's activities were
just unexpected outbreaks of
aggression, but they were pre
dictable, calculated acts of idio
cy. It's as if people feel it is their
duty to burn things whenever
the Raiders play a game. Raider
Nation might want to take a
long hard look at some pyroma
nia therapy sessions.
Since Sunday night's perfor
mance on the part of the rioters
was rather half-hearted, I still
