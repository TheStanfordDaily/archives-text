Editors Note: This article is the next in a series examining
the relationship between Stanford and thepotenluil war in
Iraq.

Like most current Stanford students, sopho
more Mabrookah Heneidi was just a child when
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The difference is that
Heneidi, the daughter of an Arab father and an
American mother, was living in Kuwait at the time.
"My family went into hiding," said Heneidi,
now vice president of the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University. "We lost our house and belong
ings in the Iraqi invasion."
If anyone might be expected to support a U.S.
invasion to overthrow Saddam Hussein, it would
be Heneidi, who left Kuwait before its 1991 liber
ation. And yet, Heneidi is vehemendy opposed to
the possibility of a U.S. war in Iraq. In fact, she
thinks the United States was wrong to involve it
self the first time around.
"The way my father explained it to me, which
1 agree with, is that Iraq was the big brother fight
ing with Kuwait, the little brother. And then
somebody just came from outside and beat the
big brother up," she said.
Heneidi's staunch support for noninterven
tion, despite her firsthand encounter with Hus
sein's aggression, is only one of many ironies that
swirl amid the debate over whether the United
States should go to war with Iraq. For example,
some liberals who had called on the United
States to end the genocide in the Balkans in the
'90s now question whether U.S. intervention in
Iraq is justifiable.
At Stanford, much of the discussion of the
merits of war has come in the form of rallies and
demonstrations, along with the occasional faculty
panel or public lecture. But reasons for opposing
U.S. action in Iraq have extended beyond slogans
like "No blood for oil," even among activists.
Underlying the rallies and rhetoric are practi
cal questions about the threat Hussein repre
sents, as well as concerns about the probability of
American success in a war. There are moral ques
tions, too â€” questions about what constitutes a
