# Variety found in opposition to war on Iraq

Editors Note: This article is the next in a series examining
the relationship between Stanford and thepotenluil war in
Iraq.

Like most current Stanford students, sopho
more Mabrookah Heneidi was just a child when
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The difference is that
Heneidi, the daughter of an Arab father and an
American mother, was living in Kuwait at the time.
"My family went into hiding," said Heneidi,
now vice president of the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University. "We lost our house and belong
ings in the Iraqi invasion."
If anyone might be expected to support a U.S.
invasion to overthrow Saddam Hussein, it would
be Heneidi, who left Kuwait before its 1991 liber
ation. And yet, Heneidi is vehemendy opposed to
the possibility of a U.S. war in Iraq. In fact, she
thinks the United States was wrong to involve it
self the first time around.
"The way my father explained it to me, which
1 agree with, is that Iraq was the big brother fight
ing with Kuwait, the little brother. And then
somebody just came from outside and beat the
big brother up," she said.
Heneidi's staunch support for noninterven
tion, despite her firsthand encounter with Hus
sein's aggression, is only one of many ironies that
swirl amid the debate over whether the United
States should go to war with Iraq. For example,
some liberals who had called on the United
States to end the genocide in the Balkans in the
'90s now question whether U.S. intervention in
Iraq is justifiable.
At Stanford, much of the discussion of the
merits of war has come in the form of rallies and
demonstrations, along with the occasional faculty
panel or public lecture. But reasons for opposing
U.S. action in Iraq have extended beyond slogans
like "No blood for oil," even among activists.
Underlying the rallies and rhetoric are practi
cal questions about the threat Hussein repre
sents, as well as concerns about the probability of
American success in a war. There are moral ques
tions, too — questions about what constitutes a

just war and what the United States'
role in the world ought to be in the
post-Sept. 11 era.
Many Stanford students seem
skeptical that Iraq poses a serious
enough threat to U.S. security to
necessitate an invasion. They point
to the United Nations' failure to
find a "smoking gun" — a defini
tive, irrefutable body of evidence
that Hussein is currently engaged
in a program to create weapons of
mass destruction. Other nations,
they add, particularly North Korea,
are ruled by equally dangerous
regimes and unsavory leaders
whom the United States is not pur
suing with equal determination.
"Our deterrence has worked for
nearly a decade," said senior Josh
Benson, president of the Stanford
Progressive, referring to the sanc
tions and no-fly zones the United
Nations imposed on Iraq after the

Gulf War. "Why the sudden imper
ative to go to war?"
Some Stanford students question
not only the Bush administration's
claims about the seriousness of the
Iraqi threat, but also Bush's motives.
"Corporate interests are driving
the Bush administration, especially
its attempt to push into the Iraqi oil
fields," said Mandeep Gill, a mem
ber of the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice.
Much of the opposition to war
seems to focus on Bush's unilateral
ist approach and personal leader
ship style.
"A lot of America's perception as
a bully has to do with Bush," said
sophomore Sam Shapero, news
editor of the Stanford Review and
a Democrat.
Benson, who opposes a preemp
tive war, argued that fi:x:using on
Bush might be counterproductive.
"The campus left does itself a dis
service when they make this a per
sonal attack on Bush, or say this is all
a conspiracy, or a quest for oil or im
perialism," Benson said. "There are

much better reasons for opposing a
war," he said, including the need tor
international consensus and the dif
ficulty of installing a friendly, demo
cratic regime in Iraq."
Joel Beinin, a professor of histo
ry and a member of Stanford Fac
ulty Against War, said that "the
U.S. doesn't have a good track
record over the last 50 years of lib
erating anyone from anything, ex
cept Kosovo. Afghanistan hasn't
been a success."
Parts of Afghanistan have fallen
under the rule of local warlords
since the United States deposed the
Taliban regime in 2001.
"It's not really the U.S.'s role to at
tack other countries," said Scott
Ogawa, a fifth-year coterminal stu
dent in mechanical engineering.
"Not that I wouldn't want Saddam
out of power. It's just what it would
do to the U.S.'s international reputa
tion. It would set a bad precedent."
That is a view Heneidi shares.
"As much as we'd like to imagine
that Iraq is America, it's not," she
said. "It is wrong for Americans to

impose democracy. The Iraqi liber
ation needs to come from within."
According to Shapero, "people
don't want the war, but they want the
results that will happen from it —
the removal of Saddam Hussein."
Shapero, however, sees war as in
evitable. He points to Hussein's his
tory of defiance in the face of inter
national pressure, noting that the
latest round of U.N. inspections
were only possible because Iraq was
threatened with war.
"lives will be lost, whether we at
tack sooner or later," he said.
Sophomore Frances Lewis
hopes the Bush administration is
bluffing — betting on the idea that
the threat of war will be sufficient to
prevent one.
"The anti-war protests and the
pro-war sentiment are actually work
ing to achieve the same goal," she
said. "It's not the opinion that really
matters in this case, it's the strength
behind it. The more people protest
the •war, the more people support
the war, the more likely Hussein is to
think Bush means business."

Heneidi, the daughter of an Arab father and an
American mother, was living in Kuwait at the time.
"My family went into hiding," said Heneidi,
now vice president of the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University. "We lost our house and belong
ings in the Iraqi invasion."
If anyone might be expected to support a U.S.
invasion to overthrow Saddam Hussein, it would
be Heneidi, who left Kuwait before its 1991 liber
ation. And yet, Heneidi is vehemendy opposed to
the possibility of a U.S. war in Iraq. In fact, she
thinks the United States was wrong to involve it
self the first time around.
"The way my father explained it to me, which
1 agree with, is that Iraq was the big brother fight
ing with Kuwait, the little brother. And then
somebody just came from outside and beat the
big brother up," she said.
Heneidi's staunch support for noninterven
tion, despite her firsthand encounter with Hus
sein's aggression, is only one of many ironies that
swirl amid the debate over whether the United
States should go to war with Iraq. For example,
some liberals who had called on the United
States to end the genocide in the Balkans in the
'90s now question whether U.S. intervention in
Iraq is justifiable.
At Stanford, much of the discussion of the
merits of war has come in the form of rallies and
demonstrations, along with the occasional faculty
panel or public lecture. But reasons for opposing
U.S. action in Iraq have extended beyond slogans
like "No blood for oil," even among activists.
Underlying the rallies and rhetoric are practi
cal questions about the threat Hussein repre
sents, as well as concerns about the probability of
American success in a war. There are moral ques
tions, too — questions about what constitutes a

just war and what the United States'
role in the world ought to be in the
post-Sept. 11 era.
Many Stanford students seem
skeptical that Iraq poses a serious
enough threat to U.S. security to
necessitate an invasion. They point
to the United Nations' failure to
find a "smoking gun" — a defini
tive, irrefutable body of evidence
that Hussein is currently engaged
in a program to create weapons of
mass destruction. Other nations,
they add, particularly North Korea,
are ruled by equally dangerous
regimes and unsavory leaders
whom the United States is not pur
suing with equal determination.
"Our deterrence has worked for
nearly a decade," said senior Josh
Benson, president of the Stanford
Progressive, referring to the sanc
tions and no-fly zones the United
Nations imposed on Iraq after the

Gulf War. "Why the sudden imper
ative to go to war?"
Some Stanford students question
not only the Bush administration's
claims about the seriousness of the
Iraqi threat, but also Bush's motives.
"Corporate interests are driving
the Bush administration, especially
its attempt to push into the Iraqi oil
fields," said Mandeep Gill, a mem
ber of the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice.
Much of the opposition to war
seems to focus on Bush's unilateral
ist approach and personal leader
ship style.
"A lot of America's perception as
a bully has to do with Bush," said
sophomore Sam Shapero, news
editor of the Stanford Review and
a Democrat.
Benson, who opposes a preemp
tive war, argued that fi:x:using on
Bush might be counterproductive.
"The campus left does itself a dis
service when they make this a per
sonal attack on Bush, or say this is all
a conspiracy, or a quest for oil or im
perialism," Benson said. "There are

much better reasons for opposing a
war," he said, including the need tor
international consensus and the dif
ficulty of installing a friendly, demo
cratic regime in Iraq."
Joel Beinin, a professor of histo
ry and a member of Stanford Fac
ulty Against War, said that "the
U.S. doesn't have a good track
record over the last 50 years of lib
erating anyone from anything, ex
cept Kosovo. Afghanistan hasn't
been a success."
Parts of Afghanistan have fallen
under the rule of local warlords
since the United States deposed the
Taliban regime in 2001.
"It's not really the U.S.'s role to at
tack other countries," said Scott
Ogawa, a fifth-year coterminal stu
dent in mechanical engineering.
"Not that I wouldn't want Saddam
out of power. It's just what it would
do to the U.S.'s international reputa
tion. It would set a bad precedent."
That is a view Heneidi shares.
"As much as we'd like to imagine
that Iraq is America, it's not," she
said. "It is wrong for Americans to

impose democracy. The Iraqi liber
ation needs to come from within."
According to Shapero, "people
don't want the war, but they want the
results that will happen from it —
the removal of Saddam Hussein."
Shapero, however, sees war as in
evitable. He points to Hussein's his
tory of defiance in the face of inter
national pressure, noting that the
latest round of U.N. inspections
were only possible because Iraq was
threatened with war.
"lives will be lost, whether we at
tack sooner or later," he said.
Sophomore Frances Lewis
hopes the Bush administration is
bluffing — betting on the idea that
the threat of war will be sufficient to
prevent one.
"The anti-war protests and the
pro-war sentiment are actually work
ing to achieve the same goal," she
said. "It's not the opinion that really
matters in this case, it's the strength
behind it. The more people protest
the •war, the more people support
the war, the more likely Hussein is to
think Bush means business."
