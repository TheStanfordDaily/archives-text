As die controversies surrounding Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein and his alleged
weapons of mass destruction continue to un
fold, a number of Hoover fellows have un
dertaken outreach efforts to further explore
the issues and establish whether war is a vi
able solution.
Charles Hill, a distinguished fellow in in
ternational security studies at Yale and a re
search fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, participated in an online forum last No
vember focused on the question of how to
deal with Iraq.
"There was a lot of positive response and
a good set of questions coming in from
around the world," Hill said. "They were in
teresting, and I was very happy to have them
and to be able to answer them."

Three Stanford faculty members con
tributed to the forum, in addition to one
from Oxford and two from Yale. The forum
ran from Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
Hill explained that offering the course on
line and making it available to individuals
around the world afforded unique advan
tages that conventional location-based fo
rums could not match.
"There has been no debate on a question
of this magnitude that involves these three
great universities that comes exactly at the
time when people around the world want
to know about it," Hill said. "It has the abil
ity to reach all around the world to the
5,000 participants."

quences of a conflict have inspired some
academics to publicize their stance on Iraq,
