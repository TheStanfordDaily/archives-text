# Hoover fellows speak on Iraq

### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As die controversies surrounding Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein and his alleged
weapons of mass destruction continue to un
fold, a number of Hoover fellows have un
dertaken outreach efforts to further explore
the issues and establish whether war is a vi
able solution.
Charles Hill, a distinguished fellow in in
ternational security studies at Yale and a re
search fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, participated in an online forum last No
vember focused on the question of how to
deal with Iraq.
"There was a lot of positive response and
a good set of questions coming in from
around the world," Hill said. "They were in
teresting, and I was very happy to have them
and to be able to answer them."

Three Stanford faculty members con
tributed to the forum, in addition to one
from Oxford and two from Yale. The forum
ran from Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
Hill explained that offering the course on
line and making it available to individuals
around the world afforded unique advan
tages that conventional location-based fo
rums could not match.
"There has been no debate on a question
of this magnitude that involves these three
great universities that comes exactly at the
time when people around the world want
to know about it," Hill said. "It has the abil
ity to reach all around the world to the
5,000 participants."
The possibility and potential conse
quences of a conflict have inspired some
academics to publicize their stance on Iraq,
utilizing their past knowledge and
experience with foreign affairs to
justify their respective positions.
David Henderson, an associ
ate professor of economics at
the Naval Postgraduate School
in Monterey, Calif., and a re
search fellow at Hoover, said
that he has recently been read
ing a lot of foreign press sources
in an effort to discover angles
on the fraq issue that he feels
American media outlets have
not been covering.
"112 wrote a piece for Hoover
this summer laying out what the
[Central Intelligence Agency]
said three months later," Hen
derson said. "I have been work
ing on some articles like that,
but it is hard to get them pub
lished. One of my outlets is The
Wall Street Journal, but they are
so pro-war, it's hard to get
through there. San Francisco
Chronicle would be open to it
though, for example."
In the article for Hoover, Hen
derson argued that the Bush ad
ministration should stop targeting
Saddam Hussein, and questioned
what Hussein's actions might be if a
war is launched against Iraq.
"If he is as evil as George W.
Bush thinks he is, then he
wouldn't mind taking a million
innocent Iraqis with him," he
said. "In fact, he might actually
prefer to die with a splash.
Moreover, Hussein would prob
ably prefer to take a few hun
dred thousand innocent Israelis
or even Americans with
him . . . Either way, invading
Iraq is a bad idea."
Hoover Senior Fellow Thomas
Moore also ftas criticized the
prospect of war with Iraq, focusing
more on the repercussions that the
conflict could have on foreign atti
tudes toward the United States than
on Hussein's possible actions.
"I have been talking out on the
issue, and I am one of the few peo
ple who really thinks that this is a
wrong-headed policy we are fol
lowing," Moore said. "We are now
being loathed around the world,
and not because they dislike the
United States, but because they
dislike our policies."
Moore said that he believed
Osama bin Laden carried out the
Sept. 11 attacks largely because of
anger resulting from the United
States' placement of troops in
Saudi Arabia and other countries.
An attack on Iraq, according to
Moore, would only further enrage
those already angry about the past
presence of American forces in
Muslim countries.
"It is just going to backfire on us,
and we have no right to be telling
people what their government
should be," Moore said. "It is just
going to generate more Sept. 11 at
tacks."
