# Coalition introduces proposal on diversity
## 
### ERIC ELDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their latest action to increase
diversity on campus, the Students of
Color Coalition presented their de
mands for increased efforts to re
cruit, admit and retain a more di
verse student population to Provost
John Etchemendy and Vice Provost
for Student Aft airs Gene Awakuni in
a closed meeting yesterday.
The move comes as the
Supreme Court is prepared to con
sider a landmark case challenging
the affirmative action policies of the
University of Michigan — policies
that University President John
Hennessy reiterated Stanford's
support for at a Faculty Senate
meeting last week.
"We applaud Stanford's ef
forts to have a diverse student
body," said sophomore Khalilah
Karim, who represents the Black
Student Union in SOCC. "How
ever, Stanford can improve upon
its commitment to diversity by
admitting more students from
low socioeconomic backgrounds
as well as recruiting in areas that
remain underrepresented in
Stanford's pool of applicants,
such as areas of the South and
the Midwest."
SOCC called for the Admissions
Office to increase the money allo
cated for admissions officers to trav
el to underrepresented areas by 15
percent, hire three additional full
time staff members to create and
implement strategy for the recruit
ment of students from these areas,
and involve students in the effort to
seek such applicants.
SOCC recommended expand
ing the word "others" in Stanford's
Special Consideration for Appli
cants policy to include students of
low socioeconomic status, LGBT
students and first-generation col
lege students.
"LGBT intolerance is a societal
problem as well as a Stanford prob

lem," Karim said. "In order for
Stanford to live up to its ideals of di
versity, our administration must
recognize this and correct it
through changes in policy, wherev
er possible."
To increase LGBT yield, SOCC
suggested expanding LGBT repre
sentation in admissions and orien
tation materials.
In addition, SOCC wants the
University to look at the represen
tation of specific ethnic groups
within larger racial categories
when making admissions deci
sions. For example, SOCC noted
that Asian-American students
comprise almost one-fourth of
Stanford's undergraduate body,
but Pilipino students represent
only a small fraction of Asian-
Americans at Stanford despite
being one of the largest Asian eth
nicities in California.
Both sides found the meeting
constructive.
"Stanford is considered the
leader among universities for the
diversity of its undergraduate pop
ulation and for the supportive and
inclusive environment we have
managed to create for all members
of the community," Etchemendy
said. "We're proud of that fact. But
being a leader does not mean we've
achieved everything we want to
achieve.
"1 enjoyed hearing the thoughts
of the SOCC about ways to furdier
enhance diversity and, more gener
ally, to improve the environment on
campus. I think some of their ideas
were very useful."
SOCC is made up of representa
tives from the Stanford American
Indian Organization, Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan,
the Pilipino American Student
Union, the Asian American Stu
dent Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, the NAACP and the
Queer Students of Color Coalition,
as well as members of the student
population at large.
