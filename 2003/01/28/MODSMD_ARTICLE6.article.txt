# With a new crop of stomachs to please each year, Row chefs aim to please
## AS GOOD AS MOM'S COOKIN' 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The chefs on the Row don't serve
mystery meat and soggy potatoes. Nor
do they remain anonymous white-hat
and-apron-wearers who cook meals and
promptly disappear. Gregarious, fun
loving and open to suggestions, this
eclectic group of people forms an inte
gral part of residential life.
23-year-old Dixie Lopez is in his sec
ond year as a chef at Phi Sig House. He
enjoys the friendly, intimate atmosphere
in Phi Sig, the smallest house on the Row
— Lopez cooks for only 27 people.

Lopez boasted that he always knows who
has a paper the next day. Last year, the
students even burned him a CD.
"The great thing about this place is
that I get to interact with the stu
dents," Lopez said. "I feel like I'm
cooking for all of my friends. And it's
fun being at the center of the house."
Lopez emphasized that he isn't set in
one fixed cooking pattern.
"Each year I get a different set of
kids, and I try to adapt my style to match
what they want. This year I have a house
full of health freaks, so I never use
cream and keep only healthy oils."
To ensure no one's taste buds get

bored, Lopez has made every night a
"theme night." Tuesday is Asian
night, and Wednesday is Mexican
night, for example.
Lopez offers something else that
makes the house feel like home: He'll
cook a recipe that a student brings in.
"The only condition is that the oth
ers have to eat it, too. So it better be
good," Lopez joked.
Louisiana native Brandon Lane
cooks for more than twice as many peo
ple as Lopez but still manages to create
a homey effect. After an assorted group
of jobs, including serving in the
Navy and working at Santa Clara
University and Bon Appetit, Lane
is in his second year as a chef at
Grove Mayfield.
"It's my grandmother who really
taught me how to cook, though,"
Lane pointed out, speaking about
his previous work and his training at
the San Francisco Cooking Institute.
"And I'm here because of my drive
to cook. This is a place where I can be
my own boss — a place where I can
use my talent and my creativity and
have people fully appreciate it. It's
an opportunity to shine brightly."
Lane tries hard to cater to all eat
ing preferences and cultural tastes.
"You have to be open-minded
to other people's needs," Lane
stressed. "You have to be flexible
and go with the flow; you can't ex
pect every day to be the same."
Although he classifies his cook
ing as predominantly North
American cuisine, Lane makes a
point of providing variety.
"I make Greek and Chinese
food every once in a while, and
there are always plenty of vegan
options," Lane said. "I also do spe
cial meals around Hanukkah if
there's a demand for it."
Lane is proud of his Southwest
ern bar, his make-your-own
smoothie bar (the only one on
campus) and his turkey dinner
"that tastes just like Thanksgiv
ing." He will name his favorite dish
to prepare without a moment's
hesitation: baby-back short ribs.
"Last year the kids weren't that
into finger foods," Lane explained.
"This year they love the stuff."
Lane insisted that the recent
budget cuts proposed by Provost
John Etchemendy shouldn't be a
problem for him.
"I have good kitchen experi
ence," he boasted." I can work with

$20 worth of food and make it look
like $70. I've learned how to use
my time and money wisely to cre
ate a diverse menu."
Apparently, the students think
so, too.
"There's always one person
who doesn't like the food," Lane
explained, "but for the most part,
people are very happy. They give
good constructive criticism."

Sophomore Nick Casey, a
Toyon resident, uses conversa
tions with his chef as an opportuni
ty to brush up on his Spanish.
"You've got to love the guy that
feeds you," Casey said. "Eating at
[the] Los Arcos [eating club] is
great: I get to practice my Spanish
with the chef, who enjoys making
imitations of Latin American dic
tators of yesteryear."
