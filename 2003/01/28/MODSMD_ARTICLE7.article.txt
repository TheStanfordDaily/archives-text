# New ASSU S.F. shuttle packed on first weekends in use

### KARI LUNDGREN 
The ASSU's late-night shuttle from
San Francisco back to the Stanford cam
pus has been packed in its first two week
ends in service, leading its organizers to
believe that their latest effort to provide
students with transportation options oil
campus may be a lasting success.
For the past two weekends, Stanford
students have had the option of enjoying
a lale night in San Francisco without hav
ing to worry about driving themselves
back to campus or finding somewhere to

sleep. A free shuttle bus, leaving at 1 a.m.
Sunday morning, is now available to make
the return trip.
This past weekend, the bus was over
capacity, with more than 30 people show
ing up. The majority were upperclass
men, some of whom were going up to at
tend an anti-war protest on Saturday.
Others enjoyed an evening bar-hopping
or clubbing without having to find them
selves a designated driver.
The opportunity is part of a new initia
tive created by the ASSU and the Office of
Student Activities and is a response to the

CalTrain not running on weekends.
Other similar ASSU efforts, such as a
weekend movie bus to San Jose, have
been dropped because of limited partici
pation.
According to sophomore Joey Natoli,
the ASSU communications director, the
number of people who took the bus on
Saturday shows that there is a high de
mand for the shuttle and bodes well for
the longevity of the program. The pro
gram's future depends on the level of par
ticipation this quarter.
Senior Emily Cuatto said, "The bus is a

great idea and solves the designated-dri
ver program, but the University still needs
to recognize that we have an isolated cam
pus." Cuatto worried that underclassmen,
or anyone under 21 for that matter, were
still not being given viable social options,
especially as houses and fraternities are
hosting fewer all-campus social events.
As there is only one bus, other students
were concerned about the possibility of
getting stuck in the city. A cab fare back to
campus is over $100, and the only other
option is to wait for the first bus
Sunday morning.
Asked what she had heard about
the program, Jea-Hyoun Kim, aju
nior in Trancos, said, "Well, I'm
from San Francisco, so I wouldn't
use it, but the freshmen in my
dorm all were excited about it."
