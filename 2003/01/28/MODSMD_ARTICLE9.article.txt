# When bad weather hits the Farm, an epic battle ensues
## University vs. supertyphoon 
### ILENA C. GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After months full of warm, cloud
less days, Northern California's
rainy season is upon us. This means
Stanford students face the prospect
of wet bicycle seats, slippery roads
and ants seeking a warm, dry place.
Those who were at Stanford right
after finals got a taste of the state's
finest in foul weather when a huge
storm battered the area.
Dan Siroker, a sophomore who
lives in Palo Alto, said, "The rain was
really bad, but it was just absurd
wind. It was unequivocally the worst
wind I've [experienced] here."
Student Housing Services was
up to the challenge to respond to
the bad weather.
"Given the intensity of the storm
and massive amount of rainfall dur
ing short bursts, Student Housing
Services facilities performed very
well," said Imogen Church, manag
er of undergraduate housing oper
ations, and Rodger Whitney, execu
tive director for Student Housing
Services. "We had some minor roof
leaks, water intrusion into a few
buildings by hard-driving winds
penetrating partially opened win
dows, and a few overwhelmed
storm drains, but no long-term
harm to buildings."
While intense rainstorms can

have a variety of negative repercus
sions, including blackouts and flood
ing, the biggest problem Stanford
has to deal with is the effects of strong
winds.
"Ifa tree comes down and blocks
a road, there is an emergency crew
that we call out on a 24-hour basis,"

said Chris Christofferson, associate
vice provost for facilities. When a
tree falls down on campus grounds,
"what you frequently see is people
with chainsaws," Christofierson
added, "That is our major activity."

Church and Whitney said Hous
ing Services is responsible for "re
porting fallen trees for removal by
the University Grounds Depart
ment, unclogging drains that have
filled up with fallen leaves, or repair
ing roofs that had leaking during the
storm."
The University is virtually always
able to avoid the inconveniences of
blackouts because Stanford's power
is supplied by a cogeneration plant
located on campus. Christofferson
explained that the plant "generates
both heating and cooling for the
campus buildings and electrical
power all at the same time... It's
not subject to problems that [fallen]
transmission lines cause."
Christofferson said the Universi
ty was able to avoid the energy crisis
last year because of this energy
source. However, houses on the

Row as well as the faculty subdivi
sion are not on the campus grid,
which leaves them subject to the oc
casional blackout.
Flooding is also no longer an
issue. Since 1998, when there was
Hooding in several basements on
campus, Stanford "invested an
awful lot of time and money in im
proving the drainage system on
campus so that the incidence or like
lihood of flooding has been signifi
cantly reduced," Christofferson
said. "We're confident those prob
lems have been solved."
Student Housing Services goes
through a series of preventive mea
sures when it knows a storm is about
to hit.
"Storm alert e-mails go out to all
Housing Supervisors to check win
dow well drains, close all basement
windows, check local storm drains
for debris and sand bag any 'at risk
areas,' " Church and Whitney said.
"SHS Maintenance Shop Staff are
dispatched to also check sewers and
storm drains."
