# When bad weather hits the Farm, an epic battle ensues
## University vs. supertyphoon

After months full of warm, cloud
less days, Northern California's
rainy season is upon us. This means
Stanford students face the prospect
of wet bicycle seats, slippery roads
and ants seeking a warm, dry place.
Those who were at Stanford right
after finals got a taste of the state's
finest in foul weather when a huge
storm battered the area.
Dan Siroker, a sophomore who
lives in Palo Alto, said, "The rain was
really bad, but it was just absurd
wind. It was unequivocally the worst
wind I've [experienced] here."
Student Housing Services was
up to the challenge to respond to
the bad weather.
"Given the intensity of the storm
and massive amount of rainfall dur
ing short bursts, Student Housing
Services facilities performed very
well," said Imogen Church, manag
er of undergraduate housing oper
ations, and Rodger Whitney, execu
tive director for Student Housing
Services. "We had some minor roof
leaks, water intrusion into a few
buildings by hard-driving winds
penetrating partially opened win
dows, and a few overwhelmed
storm drains, but no long-term
harm to buildings."
While intense rainstorms can

have a variety of negative repercus
sions, including blackouts and flood
ing, the biggest problem Stanford
has to deal with is the effects of strong
winds.
"Ifa tree comes down and blocks
a road, there is an emergency crew
that we call out on a 24-hour basis,"

said Chris Christofferson, associate
vice provost for facilities. When a
tree falls down on campus grounds,
"what you frequently see is people
with chainsaws," Christofierson
added, "That is our major activity."
