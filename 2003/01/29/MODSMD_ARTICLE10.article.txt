ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) —
Ivory Coast's army said yesterday
it opposed a new peace deal with
rebel forces while ethnic clashes re
portedly killed 10 people, new
signs that loyalist anger over the
accord was spinning out of the gov
ernment's control.
Thousands of government loy
alists surrounded the U.S. Em
bassy in the commercial capital of
Abidjan, demanding that Wash
ington press President Laurent
Gbagbo to back out of the deal.
The accord, brokered by
France during two weeks of talks
that ended Friday, seeks to end
four months of fighting that saw
rebels seize the northern half of the
nation, the world's leading cocoa
producer and a vital economic hub
in West Africa.
Ivory Coast's security forces are

unhappy with unconfirmed provi
sions that would give the rebels
control of the military and para
military police. They have done lit
tle to quell four days of often-vio
lent protests.
The security forces' support is
vital in Ivory Coast, a once stable
country plunged into chaos by its
first and only military coup in
1999.
Hard-core loyalists say the deal,
which calls fora government-rebel
power-sharing government until
2005 elections, yields far too much
to the insurgents, who launched
the war in September in part be
cause they say Gbagbo and his
southern-based government
fanned ethnic tensions.
