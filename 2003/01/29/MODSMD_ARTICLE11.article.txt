# Bush outlines challenges facing U.S.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Building a case for war against
Iraq, President Bush said last
night he has fresh evidence that
Saddam Hussein seeks to "domi
nate, intimidate or attack" with
weapons of mass destruction that
he could share with terrorist allies.
Bush pledged to "fight with the
full force and might of the United
States military," if necessary, to
disarm Iraq.
"A future lived at the mercy of
terrible threats is no peace at all,"
the president said in a State of the
Union address that also put for
ward tax cuts, Medicare changes
and other domestic policies
geared toward his 2004 re-elec
tion drive.
The first half of Bush's hour
long address was devoted to do
mestic policy, a reflection of his
desire not to let Iraq overshadow
domestic issues dear to Ameri
cans. The heart of his package is a
$674 billion plan to revive the
economy, mostly with tax cuts,
and a $400 billion, 10-year pro
posal to overhaul Medicare,
sprinkled with initiatives to com
bat AIDS, produce energy-efTi
cient cars and give religious
groups access to federal commu
nity service money.
After an address interrupted 77
times by applause, Democrats
challenged Bush's elforts both at
home and abroad.
"Tonight, the president used
all the right rhetoric, but he still

fighting — have defied Gbagbo's
calls for calm.
In Abidjan, 40 miles south,
6,000 government loyalists massed
outside the U.S. Embassy, de
manding that Washington block
the French-brokered peace deal.
The United States already has said

has all the wrong policies," said
Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.l).
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., said he would introduce a
resolution requiring Bush to pre
sent "convincing evidence of an
imminent threat" before sending
troops to fight Iraq.
Bush offered no new evidence
to support his charges against

it backs the accord, although word
appeared not to have sunk in with
the protesters.
President Gbagbo at least ini
tially tried to sell the deal, saying
frankly that Ivory Coast had not
won the war and thus could not
impose the terms for peace.

Iraq, but said Secretary of State
Colin Powell will go to the U.N. Se
curity Council next Wednesday to
present the U.S. case.
Next week, Powell will allege
that not only was Iraq hiding
chemical and biological weapons
from U.N. inspectors but smug
gling in technology for long-range
missile and nuclear weapons pro
grams, a senior U.S. official said.

"We will consult, but let there be
no misunderstanding: If Saddam
Hussein does not fully disarm for
the safety of our people, and for
the peace of the world, we will lead
a coalition to disarm him," the
president said. Key allies, includ
ing France and Germany, oppose
military action in Iraq and want
Bush to give U.N. weapons inspec
tors more time.
