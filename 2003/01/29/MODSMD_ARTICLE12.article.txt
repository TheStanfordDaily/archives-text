SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A
South Korean envoy who had
hoped to try in person to dissuade
North Korea's Kim Jong II from
pursuing a nuclear program re
turned home today without meet
ing the reclusive leader, as the
North accused Washington of
planning a major attack on the
communist country.
South Korea had been opti
mistic that its delegation, led by
presidential envoy Lim Dong
won, would be able to meet the
North Korean leader. But instead,
Lim was allowed only to meet
other high-level officials, officials
in the Seoul said.
Many in the South view Kim
as the only figure in the reclusive
country who can make any
meaningful decision on the nu
clear issue. There was no imme
diate comment from the North,
which had not previously con
firmed that the delegation would
meet Kim.
Lim and his delegation arrived
back in Seoul after an 80-minute
flight from the North, ending the
latest bid by the South to mediate a
peaceful end to the crisis over the
North's nuclear ambitions. The
North insists on direct talks with
the United States to resolve the
standoff

In his State of the Union
speech Tuesday night, President
Bush denounced Kim's govern
ment as an oppressive regime that
leaves its people "living in fear
and starvation" and insisted the
United States and other countries
would not be "blackmailed" into
granting concessions to North
Korea because of its nuclear
weapons development.
A day earlier, North Korea
made a strong warning of an in
creasing threat of war, saying the
U.S. State Department was mak
ing "a final examination" of an at
tack plan that American forces,
with the help of South Korean
troops, could carry out within
hours of receiving orders.
The situation on the Korean
Peninsula is deteriorating so
rapidly that "an armed clash may
break out quite contrary to the de
sire of the North for the peaceful
settlement of the nuclear issue,"
said a report yesterday by North
Korea's state-run KCNA news
agency.
The current dispute began in
October when U.S. officials said
North Korea had admitted having
a nuclear weapons program based
on uranium enrichment in viola
tion of a 1994 agreement with the
United States.
