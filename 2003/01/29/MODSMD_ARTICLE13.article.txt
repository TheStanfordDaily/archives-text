## The
						Stanford Daily Dean Wais' contributions leave lasting legacy 
### 
The walls of his office are lined with
Stanford memorabilia, ranging from
sports souvenirs and historical pho
tographs to award plaques and Gai
eties posters. For die past seven years, Dean of
Students Marc Wais has embodied more school
spirit than many students have. His uncondition
al commitment to student life can be seen in the
coundess initiatives and consistent quality of ser
vice performed from within his office. Although
Wais has recendy announced plans to leave the
Farm, his presence will remain on campus
through the legacy of his accomplishments. We
congratulate Wais on the acceptance of his new
post and know that he will add similar strength to
his community at New York University.
To start, Wais will be remembered for his vis
ibility among students. On any given day, he ex
ecuted his administrative duties while maintain
ing a willingness to informally listen to student
complaints, collaborate with student groups

and actively participate in student activities.
Whether singing in White Plaza at the annual
"An Art Affair," mentoring freshmen as Resi
dent Fellow of Junipero, or dancing the
Bhangra at Gaieties, Wais' school spirit trickled
over into many aspects of student life.
Wais will also be remembered for matching
his visibility with behind-the-scenes support
for diversity of student life. With ethnic com
munity centers under his supervision, he in
creased staffing and upgraded computer clus
ters, even within climates of heavy University
budget cuts. His commitment to diversity can
also be seen in his chairmanship of the Acts of
Intolerance committee that sought to curb
sources of hate crimes. Wais collaborated with
students while respecting the boundaries of
student autonomy. He often worked with the
ASSU to improve conditions of student life. In
response to student complaints about campus
facilities closing at early hours, he worked with

P

the ASSU to establish Stanford After Midnight,
a program that increased the night hours of
campus operations. Similar endeavors, such as
Midnight Breakfast, helped bring together
students and University administrators.
The Dean of Students position holds tremen
dous importance and the ability to determine
everything from community centers and stu
dent group registration to campus eating op
tions and orientation of students. Wais has a nat
ural inclination toward communication with
students that allowed him to balance such re
sponsibilities. Rather than allowing walls of ten
sion and miscommunication to form, he often
brought students together. With such an impor
tant influence on student life, Wais has left a
legacy of student friendliness. If his successor
can continue such a legacy, the University will be
in good hands.
At the risk of sounding cliche, the campus
community is at a unique moment in the Uni

versity's history. Within the past three years, we
have witnessed a complete turnover of Univer
sity leadership. Our current Chair of the Board
of Trustees, President, Provost, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs, and now the Dean of Students
have all been newly appointed within the last
three years. While long-term student interests
are usually protected by the stability of universi
ty administradon, we must now be more atten
tive to assure that our needs and interests do not
fall in between the cracks of University leader
ship transition. As the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs, Gene Awakuni, prepares to analyze the
structure and functions of the Dean's Office, we
encourage him to consider ways that diversity
might continue to be safeguarded on campus.
Also, we hope any changes continue to provide
administrative visibility to students in the same
spirit of accountability set forth by Dean Wais.
We will miss Wais and wish him the best of
luck at NYU.
