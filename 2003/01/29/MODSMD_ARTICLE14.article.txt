## Our two cents 
### 
During last year's ASSU cam
paign, current ASSU President
Monica Henestroza promised
that as part of her platform, she
would address the ever-escalating cost of
living for students at Stanford. Instead of
focusing on the drain on student financial
resources caused by a $29,000 tuition
which is projected to rise five percent a
year for the next decade or so (despite the
zero percent projected increase in the unit
cap), or the inordinate cost of living in a
closet in Roble, the ASSU elected to tackle
the enormously significant issue of the cost
of laundry, printing, I-Hum books, and
meal choices. Although the 33 percent in
crease in one load of laundry, and the
elimination of the Freshman Book Project
would lead one to believe that the ASSU is

fighting a futile battle,
there is one issue in which
there is hope — printing.
As you know, free
printing was ended at the
University Libraries at
the beginning of this aca
demic year. On a purely
economic basis, the deci
sion to end free printing
was a smart one for the li-

vya aniaj i uiiv, iwi uiv. 11
braries. Free printing had been abused
by a large number of enterprising stu
dents who printed out lengthy reports
and life-size pictures of Anna Kournikova.
In light of the budget proposals for this
year, branches of the University were
forced to eliminate inefficient costs, such
as replacing excessive amounts of toner
and paper as well as servicing the much
taxed printers so that staff positions could
be kept.
Now, printing is available at the pan
university price of 10 cents per page,
which seems like a high price to pay for
students who had once received the ser
vice for free (unless you consider that
copying at the library now costs 15 cents
a page).
This supply-side problem has been
compounded by developments on the de
mand side as well. The adoption of ser
vices like Coursework was designed to in
crease the use of course Web sites and to
eliminate wasted paper. Readings and
problem sets for classes in the form of
HTML and PDF files are increasingly
available only online. Although these ser
vices do make course material more acces
sible for students and can actually provide
for more contact between students and
professors in the form of online news
groups, in practice they increase the de
mand for printing. What had previously
been printed out by the professor and
handed out in class is now posted online
for students to acquire at their own cost. As
a number of books and articles in recent
years have pointed out (such as "The
Myth of the Paperless Office" by Abigail
Sellen and Richard Harper), despite
many businesses' and institutions' desires

to create a "paperless office" by increas
ingly using e-mail or the Internet, many
workers and students still overwhelming
ly prefer text presented on paper fora va
riety of reasons, such as ease of reading,
the ability to annotate on a text, and mo
bility. Furthermore, many students have
not invested in printers and / or feel that
the University should take a reasonable,
basal level of responsibility for these legiti
mate printing needs.
Thankfully, the University has long
heeded this call and gives each Leland ac
count a quota of 100 pages a quarter. Ad
ditional pages are provided to students in
certain classes such as Honors Colloqui
ums or seminars. Unfortunately, these
page quotas are only available behind a
veritable series of "firewalls" in Sweet Hall.
These "firewalls" are not denotative, typi
cal computer firewalls — rather, they are a
combination of factors that keep most stu
dents from accessing their page quotas.
The first firewall is that the quota is only
physically available in Sweet Hall. Fora
university as wired and infrastructurally
gifted (in other words, we have printers in
other places too!) as Stanford, there is no
reason beyond pure bureaucracy that this
quota is limited to Sweet Hall.
The second (and perhaps most impor
tant) firewall is that UNIX is the only op
erating language available on the Sweet
Hall computers. Although Stanford does
boast a good many techy majors, forcing
fuzzy majors to learn UNIX to access their
free printing is like forcing techy majors to
adequately deconstruct Dostoevsky in
Russian before they can compile their pro
grams. Simply put, UNIX is not a very
user-friendly interface. In addition, Sweet
Hall printers cannot accommodate Mi
crosoft Word files, which are by far the
most common files needed for printing by
all students, techy or fuzzy.
Of course, there continues to be an
issue of bureaucratic control. Academic
Computing allots students their 100-page
quotas. In order for students to access
their quotas anywhere on campus, Aca
demic Computing would be forced to co
ordinate with Residential Computing and
the University Libraries. Although this ad
mittedly would require some extra work
on the part of the involved branches of the
University, it is totally unreasonable to
force the Stanford student body to play
Tantalus to the metaphorical grapes of
fered by free printing. Either the bureau
cracies should coordinate with each other
to ensure that this quota is equally avail
able to all students, or the money used to
provide the quota should be reallocated
towards resources that can be utilized by a
larger segment of the student body.

Tim Meyer and Alex Greninger tackle the hard
hitting issues each and every Wednesday. E
