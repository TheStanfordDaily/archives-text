Discrepancies arise from
'editorial omissions'
With regard to my interview about
India, ("International Spotlight:
India," Jan. 27) I'd like to point out sev
eral discrepancies arising out of edito
rial omissions.
For one, when asked, "What would you
say is one of the most pressing problems
[in India]?" I responded that develop
mental issues common to all Third World
countries (poverty, pollution, population
growth) were a major concern and that in
addition to these, India drained a fair
amount of resources away in tackling ter
rorism in the Kashmir region. This refer
ence to developmental issues, and terror
ism (which is why Kashmir is relevant in
the post-Sept. 11 world), was omitted.
These issues, and not simply the dispute
with Pakistan, form the crux of India's
socio-political initiative.
Further, I commented on the build-up
of communal tensions, particularly in the
state of Gujarat and cited this as a major
factor in modern Indian politics.
Finally, this interview features several
factual errors that resulted from a lack of
verbatim transcription (this interview was
not taped). For one, the statement," Kash
mir has a Hindi government but a Muslim
majority," is both syntactically (the word is
"Hindu") and factually inaccurate. When
Kashmir acceded to India under extreme
duress and pressure from tribal invasions,
its ruler was a Hindu. The current Kash
mir government, elected late last year, has
a Muslim chief-minister, as have all the
elected governments in the past 50 years.

While I recognize that such interviews
by their very nature trivialize important is
sues, and that the editors must work with
in their constraints of space, I hope that in
the future all omissions will be made care
fully so as to not distort the issue. I also sin
cerely hope that The Daily will henceforth
record all interviews and ensure a verba
tim transcription of statements.

Targeting university students because of
their background is not the solution'
According to a story in Saturday's
Washington Post, federal authorities are
using campus police officers to effectively
spy on Arab and Muslim students at Amer
ican universities. According to officials, the
FBI "has strengthened or established
working relationships with hundreds of
campus police departments in part to gain
better access to insular communities of
Middle Eastern students."
Similar strategies were used in the
1950s and 60s to spy on student activists
and political dissidents. Although I would
love to see the deputy sheriffs and com
munity service officers of Stanford's De
partment of Public Safety do something
more useful than ticket bicyclists, I strong
ly oppose any attempt to conduct surveil
lance on or otherwise monitor my fellow
students on the basis of their nationality or
religion.
I hope to see The Daily and student
groups call upon the Department of Pub

lie Safety to make public their cooperation
with FBI authorities (or lack thereof) on
this matter. To what degree are Stanford
officers involved with FBI investigations
and local Joint Terrorism Task Forces?
Have Stanford officers been given access
to classified information on students? It is
bad enough that our federal government
is racially profiling Arab and Muslim stu
dents through new INS registration pro
cedures and denying visas to visiting
scholars.
Any attempt to involve Stanford's De
partment of Public Safety in this process
would undermine the respect the Stan
ford community currently holds for its
public safety officers and hinder the open
exchange of ideas that is critical for educa
tional endeavors at the university level. Ac
cording to The Daily, international stu
dents comprise one-third of Stanford's
graduate student population and five per
cent of undergraduates.
These students deserve to have their
privacy respected just as much as the rest
of us. I realize that the U.S. faces internal
terrorist threats that the majority of Amer
icans did not fully appreciate until 16
months ago, but targeting university stu
dents because of their background is not
the solution.
The U.S. occupies its current cultural
and economic position partly due to its
ability to attract the brightest minds from
around the globe to our institutions of
higher learning. We should be careful not
to damage that attraction.
