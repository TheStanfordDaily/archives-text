# HIGH WATER RISING
## Reflections on President Bush's State of the Union address 
### 
As President George Bush con
cluded his rendition of the time
honored State of the Union ad
dress last night, he declared: "We
Americans have faith in ourselves, but not
in ourselves alone." Great, I thought: He's
going to thank our allies and remind them
of how much we'd appreciate their sup
port. The president continued: "We do not
claim to know all the ways of Providence,
yet we can trust in them, placing our confi
dence in the loving God behind all of life
and history."
Oh. That's what he meant by "not in
ourselves alone." That ending must have
gotten a lot of eye rolls around the Stan
ford campus, and I'm sure the lofty per
oration about America exercising power
without conquest, being forced into war in
Iraq, and being the resolute defender of
God's favorite form of government
(democracy) weren't big hits around here
either. Other highlights: the "axis of evil,"
was replaced with the axis-of-isms ("Hit
lerism, militarism and communism were
defeated by the will of free peoples"); and
the U.N. is getting one and only one more
chance, a week from today, to get on board

regarding Iraq.
A statement on a
greater commitment to
public diplomacy — the
quest for hearts and
minds around the world
— was regrettably absent
from the address. Ameri
cans put a profoundly
higher premium on dead

sons than we do on oil (in fact, there's a
good chance that this war is going to be
bad for American oil interests); but you'd
never know it from listening to the rest of
the world's complaints. Perhaps that's be
cause when the president talks about
American justice lately, he always seems
to be referring to killing terrorists. He
would honor the term and proselytize the
concept far more aptly by emphasizing
the other side of American justice — the
rule of law, freedom and equality — to
the world.
Indeed, many at home and far more
abroad are put oft" by the president's
brazen style. His predecessors have done a
far superior job massaging international
egos and sugarcoating harsh strategic re

alities with testaments to multilateralism
and cooperation.
But in his remarks tonight, the presi
dent made explicit what has been known
in foreign policy circles for years: It is the
American military that has harbored
near-exclusive responsibility for the
democratic victories of the 20th century,
and it is the American military that will
continue to be the vanguard of the free
world in the years to come. The more co
operation, the better. But at the end of
the day, as the president noted, the re
sults must trump the process.
Sadly, for the Bush administration, this
has meant that the process (of going to the
U.N. and attempting to garner interna
tional support) has been executed with an
air of moderate annoyance and impa
tience. However, it's still better than disre
garding the international body entirely,
which may well have been the case had
Secretary Colin Powell and Dr. Con
doleezza Rice not convinced the president
to try the multilateral route.
But far worse than those who are cava
lier about the process, are those who allow
the fundamental goal to be subjugated by

it. For example, many Europeans swear
allegiance to the rule of law but are averse
to military action in places where it is
patently ignored; the ultimate distortion
of the process-result relationship.
And to those who offer the, 'let the in
spections work!" mantra, I ask you: Whom
are the inspections working for? Saddam,
and Saddam alone. He, like so many
tyrants before him, sees a fertile opportu
nity to exploit those hopeful souls who are
willing to delay his demise by nourishing a
well-intended but defunct process.
The reality is there. We know Sad
dam had a formidable arsenal of bio
logical and chemical weapons, and no
one has been able to discern what has
happened to them. Therefore, inspec
tions aren't working.
The process is invalidated because of
insufficient cooperation by Saddam. But
those who wish to avert the result at all
costs are clinging to any process, no matter
how devoid of value and effect, that will
achieve this end.
The terrible irony is that we are going
to get the answer as soon as we go to war.
When America, hopefully with a coalition

of willing partners, invades Iraq, Saddam
is likely to pull out all the stops. The anti
war, pro-letting-inspections-go-on-forev
er cadres will be faced with a soul-search
ing quandary at this juncture: If American
troops and / or Israeli civilians are attacked
with biological or chemical weapons, will
you concede the failure of the inspections
and support the war? Or will you then
argue that maybe if we wouldn't have at
tacked, he would never have used his
weapons of mass destruction? As the pres
ident said tonight, "trusting in the sanity
and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a
strategy, and it is not an option."
In the long term, a largely dismissive
approach to the mechanisms of interna
tional cooperation will be damaging for
the United States. But when tyrants are
shielded by the tired processes of implau
sible peace, the American fidelity to results
— no matter how ill-conveyed — emerges
as the sole guarantor of a secure world.
