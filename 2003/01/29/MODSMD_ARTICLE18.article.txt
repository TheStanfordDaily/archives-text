## Softball prepares for title run 
### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal softball team is
about to open its seventh season
under the direction of head coach
John Rittman.
But this year's team looks very
different from those in his previous
six — especially the last four
squads he has led — as the greatest
softball class to ever pass through
Stanford graduated last year, leav
ing a lot of open spaces behind
them.
"Any time you lose players of
the caliber of the players that we
lost last year, it is tough," Rittman
said. "However, we have a great
group of returners and a solid
freshman recruiting class that
should help us with the transition.
All programs go through that kind
of change."
And this year, it happens that all
the Pacific-10 Conference power
houses are going through a similar
transition. Last year's national
champion California, Arizona and
UCLA are all losing their top pitch
ers in Jocelyn Forrest, Jenny Finch
and Amanda Freed, respectively.
So although the Cardinal recog
nizes the talent of those who are
now gone from its roster, it is only
anticipating a season in which any
thing is possible.
"We are looking forward to a
very good year and not dwelling
on the past or who we have lost,"
Rittman said. "Our approach will
be looking at the future and taking
it game by game."
The future is one that includes a
big and promising freshman class,
one that is expected to immediate
ly contribute to Stanford's success.
Kicking off their first season on
the Farm are Lauren Lappin,
Megan Bordelon, Catalina Morris,
Laura Severson and former Stan
ford cross-country runner Kather
ine Hoffman.
But Catalina Morris, named All-
State in Arizona, may have the

toughest role of all the freshmen.
She will likely be the replacement
for four-time All-American Jessica
Mendoza in center field.
"[Morris] has done a good job
for us so far in practices and in the
fall tournament," Rittman said.
"She has some pretty big shoes to
fill, but we are looking for her to
step in at center field."
There is no doubt that Men
doza, a U.S. National Team mem
ber, and her graduated counter
parts will be tough to replace, but
the Cardinal is confident that this
year's squad is up to the challenge.
"We do have a lot of freshmen,
but they have really come in and
done a good job," said junior catch
er Jessica Allister. "I think that we
are going to have good people
everywhere that we need them. I
think we have a really good chance
at doing things this year we have
never done before."
For Stanford softball, the only
thing remaining on this list of un
finished goals is winning a national
championship. Leading the way
this year will be a senior class that is
eager to bring the program its first
NCAA tide.
These four seniors are second
baseman Kira Ching, outfielder
Cassi Brangham and pitchers Tori
Nyberg and Maureen LeCocq.
Dana Sorensen, who also entered
the program in the 2000 season,
will be returning this year after
redshirting last season with a torn
ACL.
Ching will be a leader in the in
field as well as at the plate. An Hon
orable Mention All-Pac-10 selec
tion, Ching started 61 games last
season at second base. Beyond her
consistent play in the field, Ching
also posed a threat at the plate, hit
ting .326 and leading the team with
46 RBI. Always aggressive on the
basepaths, Ching also posted 13
stolen bases for the Cardinal last
season.
"Kira is just an outstanding
player and is sometimes over

looked," Rittman said. "Kira has
contributed tremendously in three
years, and we are looking for her to
solidify our infield and be a leader
on the field."
With Ching at second and Lap
pin at shortstop, the corners are
still up for grabs.
Sophomore Elizabeth Bendig
will be batding Bordelon and Sev
erson for third base, while first base
is a four-way contest between
LeCocq and a trio of sophomores,
Leah Nelson, Meghan Sickler and
Michelle Thiry.
With Ching leading the infield,
Brangham will be taking on the
identical role in the outfield. After
starting all 65 games of the 2002
season, the Cardinal's only return
ing starter in the outfield will try to
pass on her knowledge to the new
comers taking over in center and
right.
With Morris expected to take
over the role in center field, right
field remains the only open spot,
with sophomores Heather Shook
and Sickler competing for the job.
While the faces in the infield
and outfield will be mosdy new, the
Cardinal battery will remain the
same with Allister behind the plate
and Nyberg, Sorensen and
LeCocq on the rubber. In addition
to the returners will be freshmen
hurler Laura Severson.
"We are going to have a great
pitching staff this year," Allister
said. "Widi Tori, Dana, and Mau
reen returning this season, I diink
we are going to have one of the
strongest and deepest pitching
staffs in die conference."
The Cardinal is one of the only
teams in the Pac-10 returning all its
pitchers, and with Sorensen's re
turn and Severson's arrival, the
Stanford staff could be tops in the
nation.
Nyberg returns after her best
season on the Farm, having
stepped up to the challenge when
two-time Ail-American Sorensen became
injured. Finishing with a 26-11 record, a
1.51 ERA and a career-high 203 strikeouts,
Nyberg was recognized for her efforts as a
second-team All-Pac-10 selection.
LeCocq appeared in 25 games last sea
son, winning 16 in 158 innings of work. The
1999 Gatorade High School Player of the
Year from California, LeCocq will share time
in the circle with Severson, the 2002 Illinois
Player of the Year.
With the field open, the sense of oppor
tunity and excitement among team mem
bers is definitely contagious. With so much
change at Stanford and across the Pac-10,
positions and championships are definitely
there for the taking.
"We want to place first or second in the
conference, [and] win our regional and the
College World Series," Brangham said.
"That is what we are shooting for every sin
gle day when we step on the field for prac
tice, and I don't see any reason why we
shouldn't be able to accomplish those goals if
we continue to work as hard as we have
been."

years, and we are looking for her to
solidify our infield and be a leader
on the field."
With Ching at second and Lap
pin at shortstop, the corners are
still up for grabs.
Sophomore Elizabeth Bendig
will be batding Bordelon and Sev
erson for third base, while first base
is a four-way contest between
LeCocq and a trio of sophomores,
Leah Nelson, Meghan Sickler and
Michelle Thiry.
With Ching leading the infield,
Brangham will be taking on the
identical role in the outfield. After
starting all 65 games of the 2002
season, the Cardinal's only return
ing starter in the outfield will try to
pass on her knowledge to the new
comers taking over in center and
right.
With Morris expected to take
over the role in center field, right
field remains the only open spot,
with sophomores Heather Shook
and Sickler competing for the job.
While the faces in the infield
and outfield will be mosdy new, the
Cardinal battery will remain the
same with Allister behind the plate
and Nyberg, Sorensen and
LeCocq on the rubber. In addition
to the returners will be freshmen
hurler Laura Severson.
"We are going to have a great
pitching staff this year," Allister
said. "Widi Tori, Dana, and Mau
reen returning this season, I diink
we are going to have one of the
strongest and deepest pitching
staffs in die conference."
The Cardinal is one of the only
teams in the Pac-10 returning all its
pitchers, and with Sorensen's re
turn and Severson's arrival, the
Stanford staff could be tops in the
nation.
Nyberg returns after her best
season on the Farm, having
stepped up to the challenge when
two-time Ail-American Sorensen became
injured. Finishing with a 26-11 record, a
1.51 ERA and a career-high 203 strikeouts,
Nyberg was recognized for her efforts as a
second-team All-Pac-10 selection.
LeCocq appeared in 25 games last sea
son, winning 16 in 158 innings of work. The
1999 Gatorade High School Player of the
Year from California, LeCocq will share time
in the circle with Severson, the 2002 Illinois
Player of the Year.
With the field open, the sense of oppor
tunity and excitement among team mem
bers is definitely contagious. With so much
change at Stanford and across the Pac-10,
positions and championships are definitely
there for the taking.
"We want to place first or second in the
conference, [and] win our regional and the
College World Series," Brangham said.
"That is what we are shooting for every sin
gle day when we step on the field for prac
tice, and I don't see any reason why we
shouldn't be able to accomplish those goals if
we continue to work as hard as we have
been."

The Cardinal softball team will begin its quest fora fifth straight 40-win season on Saturday against Pacific.
Stanford is depending on a strong freshman class to weather the loss of three All-Pacific-10 selections.
The Cardinal softball team is
about to open its seventh season
under the direction of head coach
John Rittman.
But this year's team looks very
different from those in his previous
six — especially the last four
squads he has led — as the greatest
softball class to ever pass through
Stanford graduated last year, leav
ing a lot of open spaces behind
them.
"Any time you lose players of
the caliber of the players that we
lost last year, it is tough," Rittman
said. "However, we have a great
group of returners and a solid
freshman recruiting class that
should help us with the transition.
All programs go through that kind
of change."
And this year, it happens that all
the Pacific-10 Conference power
houses are going through a similar
transition. Last year's national
champion California, Arizona and
UCLA are all losing their top pitch
ers in Jocelyn Forrest, Jenny Finch
and Amanda Freed, respectively.
So although the Cardinal recog
nizes the talent of those who are
now gone from its roster, it is only
anticipating a season in which any
thing is possible.
"We are looking forward to a
very good year and not dwelling
on the past or who we have lost,"
Rittman said. "Our approach will
be looking at the future and taking
it game by game."
The future is one that includes a
big and promising freshman class,
one that is expected to immediate
ly contribute to Stanford's success.
Kicking off their first season on
the Farm are Lauren Lappin,
Megan Bordelon, Catalina Morris,
Laura Severson and former Stan
ford cross-country runner Kather
ine Hoffman.
But Catalina Morris, named All-
State in Arizona, may have the

toughest role of all the freshmen.
She will likely be the replacement
for four-time All-American Jessica
Mendoza in center field.
"[Morris] has done a good job
for us so far in practices and in the
fall tournament," Rittman said.
"She has some pretty big shoes to
fill, but we are looking for her to
step in at center field."
There is no doubt that Men
doza, a U.S. National Team mem
ber, and her graduated counter
parts will be tough to replace, but
the Cardinal is confident that this
year's squad is up to the challenge.
"We do have a lot of freshmen,
but they have really come in and
done a good job," said junior catch
er Jessica Allister. "I think that we
are going to have good people
everywhere that we need them. I
think we have a really good chance
at doing things this year we have
never done before."
For Stanford softball, the only
thing remaining on this list of un
finished goals is winning a national
championship. Leading the way
this year will be a senior class that is
eager to bring the program its first
NCAA tide.
These four seniors are second
baseman Kira Ching, outfielder
Cassi Brangham and pitchers Tori
Nyberg and Maureen LeCocq.
Dana Sorensen, who also entered
the program in the 2000 season,
will be returning this year after
redshirting last season with a torn
ACL.
Ching will be a leader in the in
field as well as at the plate. An Hon
orable Mention All-Pac-10 selec
tion, Ching started 61 games last
season at second base. Beyond her
consistent play in the field, Ching
also posed a threat at the plate, hit
ting .326 and leading the team with
46 RBI. Always aggressive on the
basepaths, Ching also posted 13
stolen bases for the Cardinal last
season.
"Kira is just an outstanding
player and is sometimes over

looked," Rittman said. "Kira has
contributed tremendously in three
years, and we are looking for her to
solidify our infield and be a leader
on the field."
With Ching at second and Lap
pin at shortstop, the corners are
