## Freshmen fill big shoes 
### LEE INSINGA 
Stanford softball fans might occasionally be
tempted to reflect on the trio of All-Pacific-10 Con
ference seniors lost to graduation in June 2002.
First-team selections Jessica Mendoza and Sarah
Beeson, and second-team selection Robin Walker,
left big cleats to fill on the mound, at first base and
shortstop, respectively. Fans can take heart, howev
er, from four talented freshmen, and the unexpect
ed addition of a sophomore to the team.
The first of the newcomers, freshman Laura Sev
erson, will be expected to make an immediate con
tribution to the team's pitching staff. Severson, who
arrived at Stanford by way of Frankfort, 111., has
been pegged as a possible member of this year's
starting rotation by head coach John Rittman.
Said Rittman: "Laura works extremely hard and
will come in and give us some solid innings this year."
With staff ace Dana Sorensen still recovering
from injury, Severson will most likely pitch one of
the games in this weekend's season-opening series
against Pacific. This might intimidate most fresh
men, but not Severson.

"Pitching is something that I've done fora very
long time; it's where I'm most comfortable," she
said.
Severson describes herself as an aggressive pitch
er — she "doesn't throw extremely hard," but
strives to "make the hitters get themselves out."
Freshman Lauren Lappin has been selected to
fill the hole at shortstop. Lappin, hailing from Ana
heim, Calif., was the 2002 Orange County Female
Athlete of the Year. She is noted for her hitting
prowess, exemplifying that with a 31 -game hitting
streak while at Loara High School.
"Lauren has great range, hands and a great
arm," Rittman said. "She has all the tools necessary
to be an outstanding player at this level. Now it'sjust
a matter of settling in and playing some games."
Freshman Catalina Morris will see time in center
field for the Cardinal.
Morris is a 2002 Arizona All-State selection who
played high school ball for Buena High School of
Sonoita.
"Catalina has improved drastically in the outfield

defensively," Rittman said.
Freshman Megan Bordelon
joins the Cardinal from Dana Hills
High School in Laguna Niguel,
Calif. Bordelon, who played third
base at Dana Hills, can expect to
see time at both third and first.
Perhaps the most difficult tran
sition for these freshmen will be
adjusting to the quality of play in
the Pac-10.
"It is always tricky to speculate
how freshmen are going to react to
Division I Pac-10 Conference
pitching, but they are all very tal
ented athletes and we are looking
for them to step up and produce
offensively," Rittman said. "I think
that your freshmen year is a huge
learning experience and one of ad

justment. But we are hoping that
the transition is smooth, and that
they will put up some good num
bers for us."
The freshmen certainly feel
that they have been prepared by a
fall quarter of rigorous training
and practices.
"I've never worked this hard
before in my life," Bordelon said.
"It's a lot more productive than
anything I've ever done."
Sophomore Katherine Hoff
man was an unexpected boon for
Cardinal softball.
Hoffman was a member of
Stanford's track and cross country
teams in 2002. But a series of stress
fractures forced her to take a break
from running, and during spring
break of 2002 she decided to re
turn to softball, a sport in which
she had starred in high school.
Hoffman tried out for the soft
ball team this fall and will be an ex

cellent addition to the team's of
fensive attack. Hoffman brings an
element of speed that will chal
lenge opposing defenses. She will
take advantage of this by utilizing
bunts and slap-hits to put pressure
on the infielders while gaining a
natural shortening of the distance
to first base by being a left-handed
batter.
Another challenge facing any
newcomer to Stanford, and espe
cially those involved in intercolle
giate athletics, is how to manage
one's time between academics,
athletics and having a social life.
After a fall quarter full of practices
and workouts, the freshmen seem
to have things well in hand.
"I've learned my lesson about
procrastinating," Bordelon said,
adding that keeping up is a matter
of striking a "balance between what
is required and what I can get
done."

Severson described a fall quar
ter of weight-training before class
es, a full day of classes, and practice
in the afternoon, finally getting
home between 6:00 and 8:00 at
night, leaving just a few hours for
homework — not to mention the
socializing that is an integral part
of the freshman experience.
"It's hard sometimes," Severson
admitted, "but you have to keep
going, you can't get down on your
self."
There isn't a shred of pessimism
in these newcomers in evaluating
the coming season.
"We've been practicing a lot
and we love practice, but we play
for the games," said Hoffman.
Hoffman, Severson, and Borde
lon all emphasized the team's com
mitment to setting goals and then
doing what it takes to achieve them.
"We have really high expecta
tions," Severson said.
