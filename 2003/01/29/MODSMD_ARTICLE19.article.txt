## Freshmen fill big shoes 
### LEE INSINGA 
Stanford softball fans might occasionally be
tempted to reflect on the trio of All-Pacific-10 Con
ference seniors lost to graduation in June 2002.
First-team selections Jessica Mendoza and Sarah
Beeson, and second-team selection Robin Walker,
left big cleats to fill on the mound, at first base and
shortstop, respectively. Fans can take heart, howev
er, from four talented freshmen, and the unexpect
ed addition of a sophomore to the team.
The first of the newcomers, freshman Laura Sev
erson, will be expected to make an immediate con
tribution to the team's pitching staff. Severson, who
arrived at Stanford by way of Frankfort, 111., has
been pegged as a possible member of this year's
starting rotation by head coach John Rittman.
Said Rittman: "Laura works extremely hard and
will come in and give us some solid innings this year."
With staff ace Dana Sorensen still recovering
from injury, Severson will most likely pitch one of
the games in this weekend's season-opening series
against Pacific. This might intimidate most fresh
men, but not Severson.

"Pitching is something that I've done fora very
long time; it's where I'm most comfortable," she
said.
Severson describes herself as an aggressive pitch
er â€” she "doesn't throw extremely hard," but
strives to "make the hitters get themselves out."
Freshman Lauren Lappin has been selected to
fill the hole at shortstop. Lappin, hailing from Ana
heim, Calif., was the 2002 Orange County Female
Athlete of the Year. She is noted for her hitting
prowess, exemplifying that with a 31 -game hitting
streak while at Loara High School.
"Lauren has great range, hands and a great
arm," Rittman said. "She has all the tools necessary
to be an outstanding player at this level. Now it'sjust
a matter of settling in and playing some games."
Freshman Catalina Morris will see time in center
field for the Cardinal.
Morris is a 2002 Arizona All-State selection who
played high school ball for Buena High School of
Sonoita.
