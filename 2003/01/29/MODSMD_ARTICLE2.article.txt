The ASSU may not know art, but it
knows it'd like to fund it.
In addition to granting General Fee
money to eight student organizations, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate heard a pro
posal for a $ 15,000 series of grants to endow
student art projects at its meeting yesterday.
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez
presented a preliminary draft of a proposal
to create a sort of ASSU Endowment of the
Arts, meant to fund individual student art
projects. Rodriguez, a junior, explained
that while resources for student art organi
zations existed, no ASSU funding was allo
cated for individual artists.
The proposal would grant between $300
to $ 1,000 to artists for "a wide range of pur
chases, from honorarium, to actual art sup
plies ... to equipment rental." Capital equip
ment, such as videocameras and easels, would

become the property of the ASSU once the
project was done. The equipment would later
be loaned to other student groups.
A committee of five students — two of
which must be senators — would review ap
plications of the ASSU Arts Grant (the work
ing title) and dispense a total of $15,000 out
of the General Fee reserve to aspiring
artists. In addition to the application, aspir
ing artists would have to be sponsored by a
student organization, though group mem
bership is not mandatory.
According to Senator Gonnie Ghen, the
General Fee reserve — composed of Gener
al Fee funding returned to the ASSU by stu
dent groups at the end of each school
year — served to buffer overappropriation
of the General Fee. However, the reserve
has since grown to $500,000.

driguez said.
Spending the money thus was
legal under the ASSU Constitu
tion, Rodriguez said.
"The Senate has ultimate dis
cretion . . . over what happens to
the General Fee reserves," he said.
"The Senate can do whatever the
heck it pleases so long as it does so
responsibly."
In future years, the project
would be put on the ballot as a Spe

rial Fee, Rodriguez said, "if it turns
out to be a good idea."
Senator Ex Officio Sarah Schul
man, a sophomore, noted that
problems may arise with funding
"controversial art projects."
Senator Joey Natoli, a sopho
more, expressed concern over
"starting a trend" of ASSU officials
mining the General Fee reserves
for pet projects, joking that an up
coming event sponsored by his
committee "could use $20,000."
The proposal was distributed to
senators for scrutiny and will be
fleshed out and voted upon in up
coming meetings.
