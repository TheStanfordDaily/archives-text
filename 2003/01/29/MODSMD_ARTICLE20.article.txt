# Cardinal slashes its way to wins in PA
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pampered by the perpetually pleas
ant Palo Alto weather, Stanford athletes
tend to not take temperatures of nine
degrees Fahrenheit too well. So the Car
dinal fencing team was none too pleased
when it arrived in State College to face
both the bitter cold and a field that in
cluded the host school, defending
NCAA champions, Penn State.
Yet the Cardinal emerged successful
ly from last weekend's tournament, de
feating four teams, including perennial
powerhouse Pennsylvania, while losing
only to Penn State.
The Stanford men's team blew out
Hunter College 22-5, North Carolina
20-7 and Duke 18-9, while earning a
very respectable 16-11 win over a strong
Penn team. The men's record for the
weekend was 4-1, with the only loss com
ing against Penn State 11-16.
"Penn State has won something like
13 of the past 14 NCAA championships,
and is favored to do so again this year,"
sophomore epeeist Ken Jung said. "Ob
viously it was disappointing to lose to
them, but they have outstanding squads
in all three weapons — that's why
they're No. 1."
The women struggled more than the
men did, finishing the weekend with a 1-
4 record.
The Cardinal's lone victory came
against Hunter College, which the Stan
ford women crushed 22-5. Duke and
UNC both eked past Stanford by a 14-13
margin, and the Cardinal women had
another close match against Penn, with
Stanford falling 15-12. The match
against Penn State was a little more lop
sided, as the Nittany Lions won 19-8.
The generally close margins on the
women's side allowed Stanford to pull
ahead in the overall standings because
the scores of the men's team and the
women's team are combined under
NCAA rules. That allowed Stanford to
take overall victories over Penn, Hunter,
UNC and Duke.
"The overall result was great," an ex
uberant head coach Lisa Milgram said.

The most impressive performances of
the weekend were put on by the men's
and women's foil squads, which both
emerged undefeated on the weekend.
The men's epee squad was also strong,
going 4-1 while falling to Penn State by
only one bout.
Individually, Jung put on a coura
geous show, posting a 9-6 record despite
having an injured back. Freshman sen
sation Martin Lee, currently ranked
fourth in the nation in the junior men's
epee category, led the epee squad with a
12-3 record
Foilists sophomore Steve Gerberman
(14-1) and juniors Florian Reichling(l3-
2) and Mark Mulholland (12-3), domi
nated opponents all weekend — includ
ing Penn State — indicating that the
Cardinal men's foil team is truly a force

to be reckoned with.
"The men's foil squad was generally
outstanding, with Steve Gerberman and
Florian Reichling each fencing wonder
fully, and team captain Mark Mulhol
land, the emotional leader of the team,
having a very good day," Jung said.
On the women's side, both junior Iris
Zimmerman and freshman Eva
Petschnigg went undefeated, each fin
ishing 15-0 for the weekend. Junior
Meghan Everett was also impressive
with a 12-3 record, going undefeated
against Hunter, Penn, UNC and Duke,
while falling only to Penn State.
Both Gerberman and Lee will be out
of the country this weekend competing
in their weapons' respective Junior
World Cups. Stanford's next competi
tion will be held at Duke on Feb. 8.
