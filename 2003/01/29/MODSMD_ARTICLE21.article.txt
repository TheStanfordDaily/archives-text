# Sports clichés and a round badonkadonk
## 
### 
The Super Bowl is the
sports Mecca of press
conferences, media at
tention and general
hype. And, if you've ever watched
sports, you know what that means
— inarticulate people repeating
more inane cliches than seems
humanly possible So, it got me
thinking.
Let's start off with the always
popular football metaphor: "It
was a battle in the trenches." I
don't have a problem with
metaphors at all but this has been
repeated every Sunday since the
Battle of Hastings by hordes of
obese lineman comparing their

offensive / defen
sive line
matchups to
trench warfare.
Now, I under
stand that many
of these guys are
two Big Macs
away from a
coronary and
that not all of

them have actually attended the
world-renowned War College in
Washington. But still, realize that
they play football, and as serious
as it may seem, it is clearly not war.
Other than the occasional steroid
induced heart attack, no one dies
from "combat," and usually when
they do, it's because they modeled
their careers after Lattimer from
"The Program." If you want to see
a real battle in the trenches, get
your plus-sized ass on an Air Force
jet and fly your way to Tora Bora
— or better yet, back in time, to
World War I.
For every team ever to make
the playoffs, "The season was all
about perseverance." How many
times have you heard, "We over
came so much adversity." I'm
sorry, but two egomaniacal stars
battling for media attention does
not exactly equal "adversity" in
my mind. Neither does spraining
an ankle, going on a losing streak
or hearing rumors about getting
traded. If you want to see some
real perseverance, check out O.J.
still swearing that he's looking for
the real killer.
"We gave it 110 percent
today." Now, my only math back
ground may be Econ 50M, but
I'm pretty sure you can't give 10
percent more effort than your
maximum capacity of effort. But
maybe I'm wrong because every
day professional athletes seem to
defy the laws of science — or
maybe that's just the laws of the
land. Now when Theo Fleury
shows up at 110 percent of the
legal BAG level the next time he's
stopped for public drunkenness,
I'll let it slide.
"There's no I in 'team'." But, as
any Hooked on Phonics grad can
attest, there's still a "ME" in there,
so I don't really see what the point
is. Although spelling doesn't seem
to be a big concern for athletes
anyway — tell Walker, Jamison,
Smith, Harris and Womack to
agree on a spelling for "Antoine"

(or Antawn, or Antowain, or
Antwan or Antwoine).
"Records are made to be bro
ken." Not really. People break
records to keep them as long as
possible. They don't make them
with the intention of getting them
broken, even if that may happen
much of the time. Restraining or
ders, on the other hand, are made
to be broken. Not that I would
know.
And my personal favorite,
heard after every single upset
over the past couple years, "We
shocked the world." Yeah, that's
probably right. Somewhere in
Ghana, little kids are in utter dis
belief because the Clippers found
a way to pull out a win over the
Lakers. A national holiday was ac
tually declared in Venezuela
when the Bucs won on Sunday. All
through the streets of Caracas,
you could hear chants of "Los Bu
caneeros, Los Bucaneeros."
And don't forget about the se
ries of words that always seem to
follow each other, like the words
were only invented with that one
use in mind. Ensuing . . . kickoff.
Crafty . . . lefty. Brink . . .of elimi
nation.
Honestly, how many times can
the same crap be repeated before
someone decides to formulate an
original way of describing some
thing.
"Wejust have to go out and ex
ecute." "We showed a lot of heart
out there today." " ball is a
game of inches." Anytime a pitch
er gets a hit in baseball, he's "help
ing his own cause" while anytime a
basketball player makes three
shots in a row, he's automatically
"on fire" — at least in NBA Jam,
he actually was aflame.
It's not that all of the aforemen
tioned cliches are never accurate
in describing a game — some
times they are. It's just that, some
times, an original thought would
actually be nice. So, as a service to
all of the professional athletes that
read my columns, I'll leave you
with a couple new possibilities for
sports cliches.
"I smoked that defender like a
Godfather blunt." Or, "We
dropped our opponents faster
than Christina Aguilera's panties
after a night of clubbing." And, my
personal favorite, "I tagged that
fastball like it was a nice, round
badonkadonk."
I'm sorry if anyone reading
these suggestions — or the col
umn in general — thought that
they were lame. I was probably
just looking ahead to next week's
column. I forgot that I have to
take each assignment one column
at a time. Don't worry, next week
I'll be sure to give it my all — 110
percent, that is.
