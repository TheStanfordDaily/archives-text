## The 						Rematch of Man vs. Machine: Kasparov to challenge Deep Junior 
### SUJEY SUB RAMANIAN 
Grandmasters often say that the intro
duction of computers has transformed
the modern chess arena. In the past it was
common practice to adjourn tournament
games and continue them the following
day. Gambits were also in fashion. Now,
all that has changed.
Computers have made several open
ing lines almost obsolete with their pin
point accuracy and ability to search a
broad range of moves within a limited
time. This has lead to inflation on the
chessboard — the price of a pawn now is
far more than it was 50 years ago.
Former world chess champion Garry
Kasparov will put the power of the com
puter to the test over the next few weeks
in his match against IBM's latest chess
program.
In 1997, a supercomputer by the
name of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov. A
relatively elementary error of judgment
by Kasparov in the sixth and final game
left Deep Blue victorious 3.5 to 2.5. The
deciding game highlighted the vulnera
bility of even the greatest chess minds in
the world and reiterated that to err is
human.
The result made Deep Blue the first
computer to ever defeat a reigning world
champion under classical chess time con
trols. It also made Deep Blue a household
name. Now, six years later, Kasparov will
once again pit human intuition against
the power of artificial intelligence.

A new program, "Deep Junior," will
represent the computers in this year's
match. The word "Deep" in front of the
name of the program means that Junior
will run on multiple processors — eight
in this case.
One of the main differences between
Deep Junior and Deep Blue is that Deep
Junior is a chess program, while Deep
Blue was a computer with no function

other than to play chess.
Deep Blue consisted of an IBM SP / 2
server equipped with over 200 special
purpose chips that gave the computer an
overall speed in the range of 200 million
positions per second. However, IBM dis
mantled the computer soon after the se
ries was over, and it is anyone's guess
what the various parts of Deep Blue are
doing today.
Kasparov, who became the youngest
world chess champion after defeating fel
low Russian Anatoly Karpov in 1985, is
considered by many to be the greatest
player in the history of chess. However,
in recent years, Kasparov has lost more
than a series to Deep Blue. In 2000, he
lost his world title to his former student,
Vladimir Kramnik. This ended Kas
parov's 15-year reign as world champion.
Kasparov's opponent, Deep Junior is a
three-time world super-computer chess
champion. Deep Junior was released
commercially almost two years ago and
can run on any computer. A copy of the
program costs less than $50. The ma
chine won the last official world chess
championship for computers in July
2002 by defeating 18 other machines.
Deep Junior calculates roughly three mil
lion moves per second, but its wider
repertoire makes it far less predictable
and in many ways more human than
Deep Blue.

Kasparov's opponent this time around is Deep Junior, a three-time world chess champion that
can calculate approximately three million moves per second.
to calculate between one and
three moves per second. Howev
er, Kasparov is able to disregard
weak moves and devote his time
to good ones. On the contrary, a
computer has to consider every
possible move one by one using a
programmed algorithm.
Computers are unbelievably
strong in open, tactical positions,
but contrary to folklore, they can
be beaten. This is because of their
Achilles' heal — unlike humans,
computers are unable to sense
emotion, such as danger. So ideal
ly, aiming to create closed posi
tions where you are able to build a
gradual attack on the enemy king
should give you a fair chance at
success.

It is also important to try to
minimize the number of ex
changes and to not rush the attack
because unlike the human mind,
which works on identifying famil
iar themes and patterns, the com
puter tediously works through all
the possible continuations.
Therefore, although it is impossi
ble fora strong computer to blun
der, it can choose an incorrect
plan.
Today, many believe that
grandmaster chess is more a
game of pattern recognition than
brute calculation. Therefore,
while humans and machines
both play world-class chess, their
approach to the game is com
pletely different. This difference
will be emphasized this week
when Kasparov begins his six
game match against Deep Ju
nior. Kasparov is being paid an
appearance fee of $500,000, with

an additional $300,000 going to
the winner and $200,000 to the
loser. Interested chess enthusi
asts will be able to follow the
games live in both 2D and 3D on
America Online and at X3D
Technologies' Extreme 3D Web
site, respectively.
Deciding the rules of a human
versus computer chess competi
tion is always complicated. In the
Deep Blue match, Kasparov went
into the contest without ever hav
ing seen Deep Blue play a game.
Deep Blue, on the other hand,
was able to analyze hundreds of
Kasparov's games. This gave
Deep Blue a distinct advantage.
The organizers of this event have
decided to level the odds by al
lowing Kasparov to receive a rela
tively up-to-date version of Deep
Junior prior to the contest. This
factor should give Kasparov the
extra move he needs to win.
