# Scientists use light to destroy cancer cells

The doctor said, "Let there be
light" and the cancer was cured.
Sounds likes a fantasy, but scien
tists are working on a new tech
nique known as photodynamic
therapy that uses light to destroy
fast-growing, potentially cancer
ous, cells. The technique makes
use of a light-activated chemical
called porphyrin. In a study at the
Roswell Cancer Institute, photo
dynamic therapy improved 111 of
113 tumors. The treatment does
come with dangerous side-effects,
such as increased sensitivity to
light and limited potency of the
medication.

newly discovered planet is 2.6 times
the size of Jupiter, but orbiting clos
er to its sun than Mercury, when
ever it crosses paths with the star,
there is a significant reduction in its
luminosity.
Researchers at Texas A&M
University have started sequenc
ing the genome of the honey bee,
the first agricultural species to be
sequenced. The honey bee was se
lected because of its complex social
behavior and highly developed
ability to detect and locate chemi
cals. The scientists will then utilize
advanced software to synthesize
the mass of data into a coherent
genome. However, genome se
quencing is just the first step in a
much longer process of under
standing the organism. The next
challenge is to identify which
genes control specific functions.
The New England Journal of
Medicine published a study on a
new genetic test for Hallevorden
Spatz Syndrome (HSS), a disorder
with symptoms similar to Parkin
son's disease. Scientists at Oregon
Health & Science University and
UCSF found that the PANK.2 gene
exhibited an unusual pattern in
the brain MRIs of HSS patients.
HSS is characterized by an accu
mulation of iron in the brain,
which causes gradual loss in mus
cle control. Researchers are now
investigating a theory that a muta
tion in the PANK2 gene causes an
enzyme deficiency which may be
treated with vitamin B-5.
Researchers are beginning to
doubt the optimism of Moore's
Law, which predicts the number
of circuits in an integrated chip
will double every two years. They
believe that the extreme densities
in a chip will cause thermal noise,
which can induce random bit flips
and cause the chips to malfunc
tion. Researchers predict this will
occur within the next six years,
when the space between chip com
ponents is estimated to be down to
40 nanometers.
Two studies reveal new
sources of danger for smokers.
Dr. Ovide Pomerleau of the Uni
versity of Connecticut found that
almost one-fourth of the nicotine
inhaled through a cigarette enters
the brain within seven seconds.
He also showed that smokers
under stress tend to smoke more
since the nicotine causes endor
phins to be released, which make
the smokers happier. The Ameri
can Health Foundation found that
12-14% of the hemoglobin in
smokers is bound by carbon
monoxide. Since CO ties up he
moglobin much better than oxy
gen, its presence can severely re
duce oxygen supply to the body.
