# Online diaries: innovation or violation?
## Diary writers use online journals as an outlet for their feelings 
### TAYLOR ALTMAN 
"Today was awesome: went
shopping with J and S, then had
dinner with parents at my fave
restaurant. After that, I saw a
movie with L! (are we more than
friends?!) Or is it time fora reality
check? Haha."
Think this is a typical diary entry
from a teenager's journal? Think
again. These days, the Internet is
inundated with a proliferation of
online diaries created by teens and
adults, particularly on Web sites
designed for this purpose.
These sites are all similar, in
volving the creation of an elec
tronic diary in which you can
write as much or as little as you
want whenever you choose.
These services, most of which are
free, permit an element of privacy
via exclusivity. You can create a
password, a username (a pseudo
nym) and even a list of buddies
who have access to your entries.
Livejournal, Deadjournal, Diary-
Land, Xanga and Blog are some
popular Web journal sites.
Several students have strong
reactions, both positive and nega
tive, on the subject of electronic
diaries.
"I love keeping an online jour
nal," said freshman Bethany Bier.
"I write in mine all the time to
keep my friends updated on what
I'm doing."
Bier explained that Livejour
nal allows different degrees of pri

vacy. Sometimes, she makes her
entries publicly available to the
online community. Other times,
she opts to share her entries with
a group of friends, and for truly
personal details, she chooses to
keep her entries for her eyes only.
However, freshman Alex
Carter is not sold on the idea of
online diaries. "I used to keep
one, but I don't anymore," he
said.
In high school, Carter found
himself in serious trouble after
criticizing a teacher in one of his
entries, which another student
brought to the teacher's atten
tion. Scenarios like this one make
it difficult to know whom to trust
with your private information,
how much information you
should disclose online and if it is
even a wise idea to create an on
line journal at all.
Another student, who pre
ferred not to be identified, re
called her own devastating expe
rience with online diaries. As a
Livejournal enthusiast, she uses
her diary as a forum to express
frustration, excitement, and
other emotions. She enjoys the
fact that readers can post com
ments, which are usually empa
thetic, after each of her entries.
She said the journal gives her a
sense of validation that what she is
going through as a young adult is
perfectly normal.
Unfortunately, when she de
cided to post a public entry chron
icling an argument between her
and a friend, in which she direct
ly attacked that friend, she was
faced with some very nasty conse
quences. Not only did the friend
harass her verbally, but also man
aged to embroil both sets of par

ents in the dispute.
It is hard to weigh the pros and
cons of online diaries, especially
from such varied experiences.
Some adults believe that the prob
lems with electronic journals stem
from teen angst and merely give
rise to a new method of gossiping
and back-stabbing. On the other
hand, many teenagers have had
nothing but pleasurable experi
ences in writing online journals,
using them as outlets for their

feelings and as a way to keep in
touch with their friends.
"It's so much easier to keep an
online journal than a regular
paper one," Bier said. "Typing is
so much faster." The only draw
back, in her opinion, is that she
cannot print out all of her entries,
as they are all far too long.
Jerry White, who runs the
Meadowood apartment complex in


LUIS FELIPE ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
Mountain View, keeps a different
type of online journal. He e-mails
three essays per week to a group of
about a hundred people on the
topic of feeling great at age 75.
Inspired by Henry David
Thoreau's poem "Walden, "he
says he sees "God's miracle in the
natural things that are happen
ing," such as interacting with
warm and receptive people and
staying fit, healthy and vigorous
as he grows older.
And White said that he isn't
concerned that strangers might be
reading his private work. "When
you get to be my age, you don't re
ally care about that," he said.
Why do so many people keep
electronic diaries? "Because they

can," White said. He said elec
tronic diaries allow people to ex
press political and religious views,
share their wisdom, or just write
for fun.
Apart from online diaries, peo
ple are using the Internet to share
their views about other issues im
portant to them. Weblogs, com
monly referred to as blogs, allow
people to post regular entries to a
Web site. They have become in
creasingly popular in the past few
years.
Dave Winer runs the Scripting
News weblog, one of the first and
longest-running weblogs on the
Internet.
"[Weblogs are] often-updated
sites that point to articles else
where on the Web, often with
comments, and to on-site arti
cles," he said. "A weblog is kind of
a continual tour, with a human
guide who you get to know.

There are many guides to choose
from, each develops an audience,
and there's also comraderie [sic]
and politics between the people
who run weblogs." Hundreds of
thousands of people use weblogs
in all sorts of ways.
While visitors cannot generally
post comments on weblogs, a run
ning count is kept of how many
people visit the site.
So what's the verdict? Are on
line journals a wonderful innova
tion or a terrible invasion of pri
vacy? That is for people to deter
mine for themselves, based on
how open they want to be.
If you decide to create an on
line diary, first find out about the
privacy policy of the Web site you
use. Make sure you know who is
reading it and remember that you
are always in control of how much
(or little) information you want to
reveal.
