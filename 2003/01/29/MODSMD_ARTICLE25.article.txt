# Internet virus reveals network vulnerability
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
weekend attack on the Internet
crippled some sensitive corporate
and government systems, includ
ing banking operations and 911
centers, far more seriously than
many experts believed possible.
Police and fire dispatchers out
side Seattle resorted to paper and
pencil for hours Saturday after the
virus-like attack disrupted opera
tions for the 911 center that serves
two suburban police departments
and at least 14 fire departments.
American Express Co. con
firmed that customers couldn't
reach its Web site to check credit
statements and account balances
during parts of the weekend. The

attack prevented many customers
of Bank of America Corp., one of
the largest U.S. banks, and some
large Canadian banks from with
drawing money from automatic
teller machines Saturday.
The surprising disruptions
shook popular perceptions that
vital services were largely immune
to such attacks.
President Bush's cyber-security
adviser, Howard Schmidt, said
that what he called "collateral
damage" stunned even experts
who have warned about uncertain
effects on the nation's most impor
tant electronic systems from mass
scale Internet disruptions.
Miles McNamee, a top official

with the technology industry's In
ternet early-warning center, said
the attack was "comparable to the
worst of previous denial of service
attacks and if so, marks another
multibillion-dollar hit to the global
Internet community."
The White House confirmed
they were investigating how the at
tack, which started about 12:30
a.m. EST Saturday, could have af
fected ATM banking and other im
portant networks that should re
main immune from traditional In
ternet outages.
Officials were most concerned
about risks that citizens might lose
confidence in financial networks.
The virus-like attack, alternate

ly dubbed "Slammer" or "Sap
phire," sought vulnerable com
puters to infect using a known flaw
in popular database software from
Microsoft Corp. called "SQL Serv
er 2000."
The attacking software scanned
for victim computers so randomly
and so aggressively that it saturat
ed many of the Internet largest
data pipelines, slowing e-mail and
Web surfing globally.
Complicating the investigation
was how quickly the attack spread
across the globe, making it nearly
impossible for researchers to find
the electronic equivalent of "pa
tient zero," the earliest-infected
computers.
