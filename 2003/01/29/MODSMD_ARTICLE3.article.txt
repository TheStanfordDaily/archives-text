# Documentary examines U.S.- world relations
## Director Daniel Lindsay talks about film at Kresge Auditorium 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Many Americans have wondered why the United
States was targeted in the Sept. 11 attacks, and a
documentary shown last night to about 250 viewers
at Kresge Auditorium tried to address this question.
The 75-minute-long film, "Why U.S.?", was pre
sented by Bursting the Bubble, the Stanford Associ
ation for International Development and the Soci
ety for International Affairs at Stanford.
At the event, producer Cody Shearer and direc
tor Daniel Lindsay discussed the reasons behind ha
tred of the U.S. in the Muslim world.
Shearer and Lindsay, who met through a chance
encounter, compiled over 150 interviews as they
first traveled on a road trip from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C. and later throughout Europe
and the Middle East.
"The future of physical and economic security is
going to change," Shearer said. "For example, The
Washington Post recently had an article saying that
the FBI has a new national campaign to use all U.S.
universities' police to spy on students because stu
dents might be susceptible to be recruited for ter
rorist activities."
