# Documentary examines U.S.- world relations
## Director Daniel Lindsay talks about film at Kresge Auditorium 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Many Americans have wondered why the United
States was targeted in the Sept. 11 attacks, and a
documentary shown last night to about 250 viewers
at Kresge Auditorium tried to address this question.
The 75-minute-long film, "Why U.S.?", was pre
sented by Bursting the Bubble, the Stanford Associ
ation for International Development and the Soci
ety for International Affairs at Stanford.
At the event, producer Cody Shearer and direc
tor Daniel Lindsay discussed the reasons behind ha
tred of the U.S. in the Muslim world.
Shearer and Lindsay, who met through a chance
encounter, compiled over 150 interviews as they
first traveled on a road trip from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C. and later throughout Europe
and the Middle East.
"The future of physical and economic security is
going to change," Shearer said. "For example, The
Washington Post recently had an article saying that
the FBI has a new national campaign to use all U.S.
universities' police to spy on students because stu
dents might be susceptible to be recruited for ter
rorist activities."

Daniel Lindsay, a documentary director, spoke at Kresge last night before
a screening or his film. About 250 viewers attended the event, which ad
dressed how Middle Eastern countries view the United States.
For Lindsay, a recent gradu
ate of the University of Missouri,
the documentary was his initial
foray into filmmaking.
"Dan is symbolic of our peer
generation," Shearer said. "The
film could not have been made
without one of your peers travel
ing around the world and con
ducting interviews to gather this
information."
Lindsay explained, "The film
doesn't necessarily seek to an
swer the question, 'Why us?' It is
merely an attempt to shed light
on some of the issues media
weren't covering. One of the
goals of the film is to create dis
cussion and dialogue among peo
ple in our generation about how
we can better secure ourselves in
the future."
The film dealt with hypocrisy
in democracy, cultural igno
rance, biases toward Israel, influ
ences of oil-rich Arab countries
and stereotypes.
Abu Aziz, a 26-year-old
spokesman for the London
based radical Islamic organiza
tion al-Muhajiroun, was one of
several prominent people inter
viewed in the film.
"Pull your troops out of Mus
lim soil — that is what we are ask
ing you," Aziz said in the docu
mentary. "The U.S. government
is full of terrorists
Dr. Jane Holl Lute, vice presi
dent of the United Nations Foun
dation, criticized the hypocrisy of
enforcing democratic values.
"Democracy is fundamentally
of, by and for the people . . . and
that is for them to decide," she
said.
The film hinted that Ameri
cans are being overly predatory
in promoting democracy and
that others think Bush is trying to
take over the world.
Many of the experts featured
in the film expressed their con
cern with the influence that oil
rich Arab countries have on the
United States.
"You can see the way oil
changed this world," one ex
pert stated. "Because of oil, we

support several corrupt coun
tries."
Some Americans that were in
terviewed voiced their belief that
the U.S. government has no rea
son to be supporting Israel and
that the Muslims despise Ameri
cans because they favor Israel.
The film prompted emotional
responses from audience mem
bers.
At the end, Shearer and Lind
say answered questions from the
audience.
Student response was mixed.
Sophomore Neel Parikh said
that he enjoyed the film and
agreed with the viewpoints of
fered in the film.
"I think more than anything
else this film demonstrates how
important it is that the American
people have an ongoing discus
sion of what our government is
doing in the name of the United
States and the name of democra
cy," Parikh said. "It brought to
light the facts that our way of life
is not the only one and is not nec
essarily the best. We must do
whatever we can to learn about
people of other countries and
cultures."
Parikh added, "The movie
showed how easy it is to become
complacent in our world view
and what we must do to under
stand why people in other coun
tries have the opinions they do
about us. Many people of other
nations hate the United States.
Why is that?"
Junior Eve Peters had a more
lukewarm reaction.
"Although the film was slightly
littered with various biases, it
demonstrated a wide range of
opinions as to the sources of anti-
American sentiment in the Mus
lim and Arab communities," Pe
ters said.
Sophomores Maris Jones and
Chloe Rothstein, co-presidents of
"Bursting the Bubble," stated
that the views of their organiza
tion are not necessarily repre
sented by "Why U.S.?"
Jones and Rothstein ex
plained that producer Cody
Shearer contacted them about
showing the film at Stanford and
that they wanted to show it to
promote discussion among audi
ence members.

Daniel Lindsay, a documentary director, spoke at Kresge last night before
a screening or his film. About 250 viewers attended the event, which ad
dressed how Middle Eastern countries view the United States.
For Lindsay, a recent gradu
ate of the University of Missouri,
the documentary was his initial
foray into filmmaking.
"Dan is symbolic of our peer
generation," Shearer said. "The
film could not have been made
without one of your peers travel
ing around the world and con
ducting interviews to gather this
information."
Lindsay explained, "The film
doesn't necessarily seek to an
swer the question, 'Why us?' It is
merely an attempt to shed light
on some of the issues media
weren't covering. One of the
goals of the film is to create dis
cussion and dialogue among peo
ple in our generation about how
we can better secure ourselves in
the future."
The film dealt with hypocrisy
in democracy, cultural igno
rance, biases toward Israel, influ
ences of oil-rich Arab countries
and stereotypes.
Abu Aziz, a 26-year-old
spokesman for the London
based radical Islamic organiza
tion al-Muhajiroun, was one of
several prominent people inter
viewed in the film.
"Pull your troops out of Mus
lim soil — that is what we are ask
ing you," Aziz said in the docu
mentary. "The U.S. government
is full of terrorists
Dr. Jane Holl Lute, vice presi
dent of the United Nations Foun
dation, criticized the hypocrisy of
enforcing democratic values.
"Democracy is fundamentally
of, by and for the people . . . and
that is for them to decide," she
said.
The film hinted that Ameri
cans are being overly predatory
in promoting democracy and
that others think Bush is trying to
take over the world.
Many of the experts featured
in the film expressed their con
cern with the influence that oil
rich Arab countries have on the
United States.
"You can see the way oil
changed this world," one ex
pert stated. "Because of oil, we

support several corrupt coun
tries."
Some Americans that were in
terviewed voiced their belief that
the U.S. government has no rea
son to be supporting Israel and
that the Muslims despise Ameri
cans because they favor Israel.
The film prompted emotional
responses from audience mem
bers.
At the end, Shearer and Lind
say answered questions from the
audience.
Student response was mixed.
Sophomore Neel Parikh said
that he enjoyed the film and
agreed with the viewpoints of
fered in the film.
"I think more than anything
else this film demonstrates how
important it is that the American
people have an ongoing discus
sion of what our government is
doing in the name of the United
States and the name of democra
cy," Parikh said. "It brought to
light the facts that our way of life
is not the only one and is not nec
essarily the best. We must do
whatever we can to learn about
people of other countries and
cultures."
Parikh added, "The movie
showed how easy it is to become
complacent in our world view
and what we must do to under
stand why people in other coun
tries have the opinions they do
about us. Many people of other
nations hate the United States.
Why is that?"
Junior Eve Peters had a more
lukewarm reaction.
"Although the film was slightly
littered with various biases, it
demonstrated a wide range of
opinions as to the sources of anti-
American sentiment in the Mus
lim and Arab communities," Pe
ters said.
Sophomores Maris Jones and
Chloe Rothstein, co-presidents of
"Bursting the Bubble," stated
that the views of their organiza
tion are not necessarily repre
sented by "Why U.S.?"
Jones and Rothstein ex
plained that producer Cody
Shearer contacted them about
showing the film at Stanford and
that they wanted to show it to
promote discussion among audi
ence members.
