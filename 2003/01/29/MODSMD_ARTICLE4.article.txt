# Project focuses on Dickens' literature
## 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER 
Most readers today would be sur
prised if they were given a book of which
they could only access a single chapter
each week, but this format was once pop
ular in Charles Dickens' time and was re
cently revived by Stanford's Discovering
Dickens Project.
Readers from around the local com
munity who have joined the project re
ceive the influential Dickens novel,
"Great Expectations," in 18 installments,
along with annotations, images and maps
to make the reading more enjoyable and

interesting.
The idea behind mailing the novel in
installments was conceived a year ago by
Linda Paulson, director of Stanford's Dis
covering Dickens Project and Continu
ing Studies Department.
The emphasis of the project was to
publish the novel "as Dickens wrote it to
be read," said Paulson, and to open up
the riches of the Stanford Library hold
ings to the greater public.
In the Dickens era, the novel was pub
lished in 36 weekly installments, forming
what popular contemporary soap operas
and television series are to today's world.

"[Dickens] wrote [Great Expectations]
with a view to leave you with tension and
expectation. [It made] you eager to read
the next issue," said Paulson.
In today's fast-paced world, which
often leaves many people little time for
reading, the installments also allow busy
readers, like freshmen Ross Cheung, to
read bits of the novel at a time.
"I like the format of the novel very
well," Cheung said. "I usually like novels
because they don't leave me hanging
during any clifthangers, but having it in
installments is more interesting as
a novelty in its own right, as it is
how readers originally read Dick
ens when it originally came out."
"My workload and usual pace
of life leave little time for me to
read each installment, but I try to
read what I can when I can," he
continued.
Presently, the novel is being
published in 18 issues by the Uni
versity, with funding from the Of
fice of the President, Stanford
Continuing Studies, Stanford
Alumni Association, Stanford Uni
versity Libraries, University Com
munications, Stanford News Ser
vice, English Department, Drama
Department and the Palo Alto
Weekly.
The need for sponsors was vital
to the project, as it is provided
free-of-charge to the public. The
demand has far exceeded organiz
ers' expectations.
"Success," Paulson said, "was
defined as 500 people," and the
program budgeted for 1,000. Ac
cording to Paulson. The program
currently has 6,750 readers, with
slightly fewer than 6,000 receiving
copies at home.
Requests for these installments
came from all over the country,
and there were even some re
quests from overseas. The first
three issues of the series were in
cluded as free inserts in the Palo
Alto Weekly and the Stanford Re
port.
After those initial issues were
distributed, the popularity of the
issues burgeoned. A dramatic
reading of the first few chapters of
"Great Expectations" was per
formed by Marco Barricelli of the
American Conservatory Theater

in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last De
cember. The audience far exceed
ed the capacity in the auditorium,
and the overflow was ushered into
Kresge Auditorium.
Paulson hopes for more such
dramatic readings, but says that
the project's budget, which has al
ready run into the red, limits these
sorts of special events.
The issues are carefully anno
tated to explain confusing seg
ments to the readers. Included in
the readings are maps and illustra
tions from the Stanford Library
holdings to enhance the aesthetics.
The typeface is also a facsimile of
the original issues in Victorian
England.
Paulson said that although she
thinks Stanford is mostly known
for its scientific departments, the
University also has "wonderful
humanities holdings," and she
sees the Dickens series as a good
opporttinity to share these great
resources with the public.
When asked whether she
would like to continue publishing
more Dickens in such a format,
Paulson replied, "I would love to
[continue]," yet it depends on
"whether we can afford it," citing
the tough economic times and
budget restrictions at Stanford as
limiting factors.
Anyone interested in receiving
copies of Dickens' "Great Expecta
tions" readings can sign up online
at dickens.stanford.edu.
So far, many are pleased with
the novel and have enjoyed the
themes discussed.
"I think Dickens is relevant to
today's world because many of the
issues he talked about are still true
today," Cheung said. "A huge
theme he tackled in many of his
works is the presence of class dif
ferences, something that has al
ways existed in human history and
continues to exist today."

ed the capacity in the auditorium,
and the overflow was ushered into
Kresge Auditorium.
Paulson hopes for more such
dramatic readings, but says that
the project's budget, which has al
ready run into the red, limits these
sorts of special events.
The issues are carefully anno
tated to explain confusing seg
ments to the readers. Included in
the readings are maps and illustra
tions from the Stanford Library
holdings to enhance the aesthetics.
The typeface is also a facsimile of
the original issues in Victorian
England.
Paulson said that although she
thinks Stanford is mostly known
for its scientific departments, the
University also has "wonderful
humanities holdings," and she
sees the Dickens series as a good
opporttinity to share these great
resources with the public.
When asked whether she
would like to continue publishing
more Dickens in such a format,
Paulson replied, "I would love to
[continue]," yet it depends on
"whether we can afford it," citing
the tough economic times and
budget restrictions at Stanford as
limiting factors.
Anyone interested in receiving

tions" readings can sign up online

So far, many are pleased with
the novel and have enjoyed the
themes discussed.
"I think Dickens is relevant to
today's world because many of the
issues he talked about are still true
today," Cheung said. "A huge
theme he tackled in many of his
works is the presence of class dif
ferences, something that has al
ways existed in human history and
continues to exist today."
