## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Dean of Students Marc Wais prepares to depart
in late March to assume his new position as vice presi
dent of student affairs at New York University, Stanford
will begin its search for his replacement. The search has
prompted the University's administration to evaluate
the role of the Dean of Students on campus and to con
sider potential changes in the position's responsibilities
before it is filled.
"The search process will begin sometime within the
next couple months," said Gene Awakuni, vice provost
for student affairs. "Students, faculty, staff and adminis
trators will be involved."
Within the next six months, the University will place
advertisements in major national publications, such as
the Chronicle of Higher Education, announcing the
opening fora dean of students position. Applicants
from both within and outside of the Stanford commu
nity will be considered for the position.
Candidates' applications will be screened by a com
mittee, and a small group of semifinalists will be inter
viewed for the position.
After these initial interviews, three to five finalists will
be invited to visit the Stanford campus and spend sev
eral days interviewing with students, faculty and ad
ministrators.
The names of these candidates will then be forward
ed to Awakuni for final consideration. Awakuni em
phasized that students will be highly involved in the se
lection process.
"The whole process takes about four to six months,"
Awakuni said. "A new dean would be named around
August."
In the meantime, Christine Griffith, the associate
dean and director of graduate life, will be taking on
Wais' responsibilities as die acting dean of students.

Griffith was selected to assume the position temporari
ly by Awakuni and her colleagues in the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
"I'd like to take this opportunity of Marc's leaving
to do an in-depth analysis of the structure and func
tions of the dean's office before I embark on a nation
al search," Awakuni said. "I want to ensure that the
dean's office is structured in a way that can optimize
its effectiveness."
The role of the dean of students has always been to
oversee the different aspects of student life on campus,
including student discipline, the operation of commu
nity centers and die office of student activities.
"I rely on the dean to create and establish programs
that contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic student
community," Awakuni said. He cited Wais' many con
tributions to Stanford, including the Midnight Break
fast initiative and his energetic support lor campus com
munity centers.
"I want someone who can hit the ground running,"
Awakuni said. "Someone who understands how to
work with high-achieving students in a highly competi
tive Ivy League environment."
Although the search will proceed soon after Wais
leaves, his impact on the student body and the Univer
sity as a whole will remain for years to come, according
Awakuni.
"Marc is die consummate student affairs profession
al," Awakuni said. "He's totally dedicated to helping stu
dents succeed and thrive at Stanford."
Wais, who officially accepted the job offer at NYU on
Jan. 16, will depart for New York on March 28. In his
new role, he will take charge of university housing, din
ing services, the athletic program and other aspects of
student life.
"The NYU Student Affairs Vice Presidency lisa
great opportunity to work] with a broad range of stu
dent services," Awakuni said. "Marc will do a great job."
