# Decision nixes student group surcharges

### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student groups no longer must
pay an 11 percent surchange for
Event and Labor Services after a de
cision made by Provost John
Etchemendy last quarter. His deci
sion does not apply to organizations
unaffiliated with the University.
ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez identified the surcharge
problem during his campaign last
year with Monica Henestroza, who
is now .ASSU president. Rodriguez
is largely responsible for the change
in the previous policy, which he said
had treated student groups like
"outsiders."
"This policy change is a sign that
student groups are a part of the Uni
versity community and that they
therefore deserve the same rights
and privileges as ever)- other Univer
sity entity," he said. "Further, it pro
vides an incentive for more student
group activities on campus-which
can only increase the richness and di
versity of campus life in general."
Students are billed for group

funds in their tuition.
Etchemendy explained that the
University will make up for the lost
funds by using either General
Funds, which come primarily from
tuition, or from "cuts in other parts
of the General Funds budget."
"The elimination of the sur
charge, though it is a very important
change for the ASSU and ASSU
sponsored groups, does not involve
enough money to have a noticeable
effect on tuition," Etchemendy said.
The surcharge issue does not fall
under the ASSU's "Cost of Living"
campaign, which is aimed at mini
mizing the out-of-pocket expenses
of individual students, like laundry,
meal plans and books.
Instead, the elimination of the
Event and Labor Service surcharge
is what Rodriguez called an issue of
"student space" because it involves
the availability of campus space to
student groups. Groups that want
ed to reserve spaces for activities and
events were the ones subject to the
11 percent surcharge.
According to Rodriguez, the
ASSU is now working to alleviate

many difficulties associated with the
rental of campus space for student
events. Event and Labor Services
charges a "student rate" if a student
technician is hired, but as this rarely
occurs, students pay twice as much
for the work of a professional.
The ASSU aims to either receive
a University subsidy for profession
als or to make student technicians
more available to student groups,
Rodriguez said. Student technicians
with audio/video skills generally
charge less than professionals,
which makes the option more cost
effective for student groups.
"The more likely option is the re
cruitment of student technicians;
the student 'techie' community is
enthusiastic about the prospect,"
Rodriguez said. "I suspect that if the
costs for [the subsidy] turn out to be
too high, we will begin exploring the
second option, [student techni
cians]."
Another of the ASSU's aims is to
enact a uniform space reservation
system.
"Anyone who has ever tried to re
serve space on campus has seen it: It

is virtually impossible to reserve
space on campus without going to at
least three offices, filling out a whole
sheaf of forms, and getting approval
from half a dozen people," Ro
driguez said.
The ASSU is currently working
with Innovative Student Informa
tion Services to "dramatically im
prove the most challenging aspects
of event planning at Stanford," ac
cording to die group's co-founder,
Scott Cannon.
"ISIS contributes strong techni
cal knowledge and a persistent focus
on building a world-class event in
formation system," Cannon said.
"The ASSU has an excellent rela
tionship with the Stanford adminis
tration and can accurately convey
student needs at a high level. To
gether, the teams have made signif
icant progress in upgrading the
event planning process."
Goals for the event information
system include an interactive online
calendar, a network of video dis
plays for multimedia distribution at
key campus locations and space
reservation capacity.
