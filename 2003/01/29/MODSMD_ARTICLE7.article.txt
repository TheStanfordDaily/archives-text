# PA schools grapple with statewide cuts
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Amid a stagnant national econo
my and a potential $34.6 billion Cal
ifornia state budget shortfall, the
Palo Alto Unified School District
held a board meeting yesterday
evening to begin examining how to
handle anticipated budget cuts and
avoid diversions of district revenue.
The school district is one of 60
out of the 1,000 in California that
is classified as a Basic Aid district,
which means it receives $120 per
student from the state. Districts
not designated with Basic Aid sta
tus typically receive greater fund
ing per student from the state.
Gov. Gray Davis' current bud
get proposal, if implemented,
would eliminate the $120 per stu
dent in Basic Aid districts. The
mid-year reductions proposed for
this year alone would cost the dis
trict over $2 million in revenue.
'We are currently examining all
areas of the budget," said superinten
dent Mary Frances Callan in a writ
ten statement issued yesterday. "We
are fortunate to have a policy of con
servative fiscal management in place.
Should we need to make reductions,
our goal is to keep them as far away
from the classroom as possible."
However, the end of Basic Aid al
lotments might not be the only cuts
that schools in Palo Alto will have to
cope with as the push to resolve the
state budget crisis continues.
The more controversial compo
nent of the Davis economic plan is
the potential reallocation to the
state of as much as 100 percent of
local property taxes over the rev
enue limit within Basic Aid districts.
"This is the first time in three
decades that a governor has pro
posed that local-district revenues
be taken by the state," Assembly
member Joe Simitian told the Palo
Alto Weekly.
According to the Palo Alto Uni
fied School District, which is cur
rently operating with a budget of
approximately $108 million, it
could lose as much as $23.1 mil
lion if Davis' property tax diver
sion scheme were implemented.

With such drastic cuts, the district
would have to reduce its 2003-04
budget by over 25 percent.
"These reductions have the po
tential to change the face of fund
ing for schools in California forev
er," Callan said. "We are doing
everything we can to fight this un
precedented policy change. To do
less would not serve the well-being
of our students, our staff and our
community."
Residents in the district have ex
pressed concern over the district's
ability to maintain its high quality
of education in the future given the
restrictive budget situation.
"It will mean the end of so
many things that are the heart and
soul of education, things we
fought so hard to keep, [such as]
music, art, P.E.," said Rose Fil
icetti, a Mountain View-Whisman
schools trustee, in an interview
with The San Jose Mercury News.
In an effort to minimize the ex
tent of the education budget cuts,
the district has suggested that res
idents approach government offi
cials with their concerns.
"We have been told that send
ing 1,000 letters from each district
to the governor and local legisla
tors will make a difference," said a
statement on the district's Web site.
Yesterday afternoon, while the
school district met to deal with its
specific concerns, State Senator
Jackie Speier and Assemblymem
ber Gene Mullin sponsored a meet
ing at the San Mateo City Council
Chambers aimed at addressing the
whole statewide fiscal crisis.
Speier said she believes "we re
ally should rethink the way we do
a lot of things."
Among the reforms she sug
gested were efforts to end Medi-
Cal fraud and reducing the oper
ating costs of state prisons.
"We are not going to be able to
get through without doing some
significant cuts instate govern
ment," Speier continued. "There
are lots of things that you will see
happen in the next couple
months. Our intention is to look at
where we can make significant
changes with significant savings."
