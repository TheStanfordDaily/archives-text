## Sharon, Likud win Israeli elections 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and his
Likud Party won a resounding
victory in Israel's parliamentary
elections yesterday, as voters en
dorsed his hard-line approach
to the Palestinian uprising and
dealt the dovish Labor Party its
worst defeat in history.
The prospect of progress on
the Palestinian front now ap
pears to depend on whether
Sharon can form a coalition that
will include the opposition
Labor, which campaigned on a
pledge to restart peace negotia
tions with the Palestinians.
In his victory speech before
jubilant supporters, Sharon
called fora "unity govern
ment" and warned that "there
is no cause for celebration. The
battle against the terrorist or
ganizations hasn't ended and it
claims more victims every day .
.. It's a time for soul-searching,
for uniting."
Israel TV quoted Sharon as
saying he would not establish a
right-wing government under
any circumstances, although in
his speech he did not offer any
policy incentive to Labor.
Labor leader Amram Mitzna
has ruled out joining a Likud
led government, and he reiter

ated that stance yesterday after
congratulating Sharon on his
victory. "We will remind Sharon
every day that there is an alter
native, that there is another
way," Mitzna said.
Even without Labor, Sharon
is expected to face difficulties in
forming a stable government
from the myriad political and re
ligious factions, especially amid
the turmoil of the Palestinian
uprising.
Despite unrelenting violence
with the Palestinians and a crip
pling economic crisis, Likud
won 37 seats in the 120-member
parliament — up from 19 seats
in the outgoing Knesset, accord
ing to official results. The bloc of
rightist and religious parties that
support Sharon's tough stance
against the Palestinians won 67
seats overall.
Once-dominant Labor,
which called fora speedy pull
out from most of the West Bank
and Gaza, won only 19 seats,
compared to 26 in the outgoing
parliament — a reflection of Is
raelis' anger at the failure of a
decade's peace efforts with the
Palestinians which the party led.
The right wing's victory was
greeted with dismay by Pales
tinians.
