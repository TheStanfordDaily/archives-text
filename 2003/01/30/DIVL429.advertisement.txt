ESTELLE B. FREEDMAN
Stanford historian
Freedman (Intimate
Matters: A History

America) offers a
comprehensive,
accessible synthesis
of interdisciplinary
feminist scholarship,
placing feminism in a
global, historical
framework. Freedman
begins with theories
of the emergence
and diversification of
patriarchy, outlining
the ways that
urbanization,
colonialism,
capitalism, and
industrialization have
intensified gender
segregation and
gender, race, and
class hierarchies.
