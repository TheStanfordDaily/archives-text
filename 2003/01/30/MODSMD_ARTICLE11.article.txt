## Plant blast kills at least 2 
### 
KINSTON, N.C. (AP)—An ex
plosion followed by a raging fire
demolished a plastics factory yes
terday, killing at least two people
and injuring at least 37. Three oth
ers were feared missing in the
burning ruins, which sent a black,
acrid smoke billowing over the
countryside.
There were conflicting reports
on the number of casualties, but
Gov. Mike Easley and Mayor
Johnnie Mosley later said two
deaths had been confirmed. The
mayor also said three people were
unaccounted for.
Plant manager Thomas
Clagon appealed to workers to
check in to help figure out who
was still missing.
The cause of the thunderous
blast at the West Pharmaceutical
Services plant was not immediate

ly known. The factory, which
made syringe plungers and IV
supplies, was cited for numerous
safety violations last fall.
Workers who escaped the fire
ball and the choking smoke said
they thought the factory was
under terrorist attack. Sampson
Heath said the explosion on the
other side of the factory sent a
plume of fire toward his work sta
tion and knocked him off his feet.
When he stood up, he saw wires
and tiles hanging from the ceiling
and he coulcl hear trapped co
workers screaming for help.
"Your life did flash before your
eyes," Heath said as he stood in the
yard of a church, getting hugs and
kisses from relatives.
The first emergency crews on
the scene rescued workers who
were dangling from steel beams.
