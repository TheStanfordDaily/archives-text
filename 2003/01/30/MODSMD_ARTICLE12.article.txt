# Al-Qaida member Richard Reid to be sentenced today
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Richard Reid's
lawyers said Tuesday he didn't try to
blow up a jetliner with explosives in his
shoes because he hated the United
States, but instead was trying to defend
Islam from U.S. aggression.
The explanation of Reid's actions
aboard an American Airlines flight
from Paris to Miami in 2001 was in
court documents submitted to the
judge who will sentence him today. He

faces 60 years to life in prison.
Passengers and crew members
overpowered Reid, 29, after he tried
to light a fuse protruding from one
of his shoes. Prosecutors said the
bombs would have caused cata
strophic damage aboard the flight
carrying 197 people.
When he pleaded guilty in October,
Reid said he was a member of the ter
rorist group al-Qaida and declared his

hatred for the United States.
But in their sentencing memo,
Reid's lawyers say he did not do it to
wage war against America. They say he
"took no pleasure" in trying to blow up
the plane, but did it to defend Islam,
which he believes has been under at
tack by the United States.
Reid, a British citizen who con
verted to Islam, claims in letters he
wrote from prison that the United

States, through sanctions on Iraq, is
responsible for the deaths of 2 mil
lion Iraqi children.
"He well knew that he would
cause untold pain and grief even if
only a few people were killed, but he
says that this was outweighed in his
mind by his firm belief . . . that this
country in recent years has caused
the deaths of millions of Muslims,"
his lawyers Vrote.
