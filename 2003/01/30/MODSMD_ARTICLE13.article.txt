# U.N. wants more time for inspectors
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Key members of
the U.N. Security Council said yesterday that the
United States has so far failed to convince them that
time has run out fora peaceful resolution to the cri
sis with Iraq.
At a crucial council meeting a day after President
Bush's State of the Union speech, 11 of the 15 mem
bers supported giving more time to weapons inspec
tors to pursue Iraq's peaceful disarmament, council
diplomats told The Associated Press.
Calling for continued inspections were France,
Russia and China, which all have veto power, as well
as Germany, Mexico, Chile, Guinea, Cameroon,
Syria, Angola and Pakistan. Only Bulgaria and Spain
backed the United States and Britain in focusing on
Iraq's failures rather than the inspections process.
In Washington, White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said diplomacy was in its "final phase."
Secretary of State Colin Powell said the United
States would try to help find a haven for Saddam
Hussein, his family and close aides if he would agree
to go into exile.
"That would be one way to try to avoid war," Pow
ell, who will address the Security Council next
Wednesday, said at a news conference.
State Department officials, however, said an exile
scenario was not under serious consideration.
Saddam, in remarks televised yesterday in Iraq,
was defiant. He said his country "has huge capabili
ties" and is ready to face a U.S. attack, "destroy it and
defeat it."
"When faced with an attack, we always put in our
calculation the worst case scenario and we build our
tactics on that," the Iraqi leader told military com
manders. "We will have long successive defense lines
with continued support of equipment."
