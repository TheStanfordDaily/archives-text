## The
						Stanford Daily Students should recognize flaws in Bush's plans 
### 
Published Since 1891

On Tuesday night, Stanford stu
dents, faculty, staff and community
members gathered around their
television sets with the rest of the
country to hear President George W. Bush
give his second State of the Union address.
Given the state of the economy and the
growing inequality within the United States,
many Americans worried that Bush might
use his desire for war to veer away from do
mestic issues, the traditional focus of this ad
dress. Fortunately, he did not ignore domes
tic issues; unfortunately, his initiatives con
tinued to appeal to the emotions of the
American people instead of providing logi
cal solutions. As members of the academic
community, we should analyze and identify
the fallacies of his programs so to better
lobby the government and create truly vi
able alternatives.
Bush seemed to try to recreate the image of
being a compassionate conservative, but,
apart from his pledge to increase funding by

$ 10 billion to fight AIDS in Africa, it was hard
to be convinced. Probably the most irrespon
sible of his proposals is his plan for $674 billion
in tax cuts. Bush's plan is simple: Take some
thing that did not work last year — when the
United States lost an additional 646,000 jobs
in cities — and double up on it. The repeal of
the dividend tax will put 95 percent of the tax
cut into the pocketbooks of the wealthiest 1
percent of Americans — those earning
$300,000 or more. While a fiscally responsible
tax cut for the poor would definitely increase
consumer spending, these kinds of cuts for the
rich could just as easily find their way into off
shore accounts.
Bush also tried to give some hope to those
of us who dream of living in a cleaner, more
sustainable world some day, pledging $1.5 bil
lion for research into hydrogen-powered cars.
While any support of cleaner technology
should be applauded, this initiative seems to
be an empty gesture when put in the context
of Bush's other policies. First and foremost, he

has expressed only utter disdain for the Kyoto
Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, which
has been adopted by the international com
munity as a common framework for dealing
with a global problem. If Bush really cares for
the environment, he should put money into
technologies like hybrid electric cars that are
already available today, and provide auto
manufacturers with incentives for increased
fuel-efficiency standards.
Despite sprinkling freedom rhetoric
throughout his speech, Bush did not men
tion arguably authoritarian policies includ
ing the USA Patriot Act and the Homeland
Security Act, which place unprecedented
power in the hands of the executive branch.
These policies take away the rights to priva
cy, an attorney and a trial by a jury of one's
peers from people suspected as "terrorists"
— a label only the president and the secre
tary of state have the power to bestow. Bush
even smirked in saying that some suspected
terrorists "are no longer a problem to the

United States and our friends and allies," ref
erencing the extra-judicial killings of sus
pected terrorists.
He further proposed a law banning late
term abortions, to "protect children at the
very hour of their birth." Not only does this
"hour" last four and a half months, but it takes
the right away from women to control their
own bodies and puts it in the hands of the gov
ernment.
Bush's State of the Union address should be
a wake-up call to all members of the Stanford
community who care about the future of this
country. Some economists argue that between
the cost of Bush's war and his tax cuts, the fed
eral government can expect deficits of $300
billion per year over the next decade. One
day, our generation will have to pay for that.
More importantly, if the United States hopes
to continue to be a symbol of democracy to the
world, we are going to have to stop listening to
what the word "freedom" sounds like and
start thinking about what it means.
