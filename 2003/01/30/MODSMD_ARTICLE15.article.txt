## Don't call me white 
### 
Two of my fellow columnists have re
cently explored the nature of "white
ness." As a white person, I thought I
might chime in.
When I first set out to write this column, I
thought I might explore the fact that white
people simply cannot express pride in being
white. (The words "white pride," I would ven
ture to guess, almost universally induce
queasiness.) Or perhaps I would simply enu
merate the beauty and elegance of "whiteness"
—just to elicit some hypocritical censure from
the multicultural camp.
But try as I have to pinpoint the essential fea
tures of "whiteness," it has proven futile. The
truth is, most white Americans, most of the time,
give barely a fleeting consideration to their
"whiteness." The notion that

there is some universal "white"
value system is ludicrous. It is
funny to think that, while ad
missions and hiring commit
tees may consider white peo
ple the very antithesis of diver
sity, the diversity among white
people rivals any differences
between aggregate racial pop
ulations in the United States.

"Whiteness" is too diffuse to be meaningful.
Before I would ever identify myself narrow
ly as "white," I would call myself German-Irish
— perhaps the most generic ancestry in all of
America, but one of which I am proud. Indeed,
I am apt to think of my disposition as two parts
Teutonic industriousness, one part Celtic mer
riment.
And before I would identify myself as Ger
man-Irish, I would describe myself as a Mid
westerner — a St. Louisan — deeply suffused
with its attendant sensibilities.
William Shakespeare was white. Adam
Smith, John Locke and Thomas Hobbes were
white. George Washington and Benjamin
Franklin were white. George Eliot, Jane Austen
and Emily Bronte: white. Beethoven, Mozart,
van Gogh, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, all white.
Even Jesus was white. (Settle down; that last one
was a joke.)
Am I proud of these white men and
women? Not really. I have absolutely nothing
in common with any of them.
While there are few bastions of "white
pride," there are a host of self-segregated black
organizations, many on our own campus.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this in
sofar as it does not amount to what John
McWhorter, a black Berkeley professor, calls a
"Cult of Separatism." Defining one's self day to
day as "other" can lead only to alienation from
a society that — despite the profound cynicism
and retro-rhetoric of A1 Sharp ton and Jesse
Jackson — wants very badly to integrate you.
Of course, the importance of race has bub
bled up again in recent months. First, Trent
Lott said some very stupid things. And now,
the Bush administration's position on the Uni

versity of Michigan's affirmative action policy
has, predictably, incurred anger from the left.
But the president, and the Republican Party as
a whole, simply cannot be accused of reversing
the progress of civil rights.
Their proposals — "affirmative access," con
certed minority recruiting, and affirmative ac
tion based on socioeconomic status — are not,
nor can they be construed to be, efforts to ex
clude blacks. They would like to remove affir
mative action from the arena of race politics.
These initiatives would disproportionately ben
efit blacks and Hispanics, but the emphasis
would no longer be on race alone.
It is hard to ignore race, too, when campus
publications, guest lectures and conferences so
tirelessly bandy "diversity" about. Übiquitous
in these contemplations of "diversity" is lan
guage about "community," "tolerance,"
"awareness," "understanding," etc. These 10-
megaton words mask the fact that, more often
than not, what we are talking about is race.
Consider the undeniably diverse bounty of
special events, meals and ceremonies held dur
ing last year's commencement weekend. On Sat
urday at 11:30 a.m., NuestraGraduacion Mass
was held. A couple of hours later, the Chicano /
Latino Graduation Ceremony and the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Graduation
Celebration. At 5 p.m., both the Asian Ameri
can Graduation Dinner and the American In
dian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian
Graduation Dinner. (Can't a straight, white
guy get a sandwich somewhere?)
I have caught a glimpse of what prejudice
feels like. I am a football player. My teammates
and I, conspicuously husky as we are, have
been the object of prejudicial stereotypes.
("Jocks are idiots.") Does this experience
wound my ego? Of course. Does it define me,
or the expectations I have for myself? Of
course not.
It was heartening to read earlier this week
that a representative from the Black Student
Union thinks Stanford could improve its diver
sity by admitting more students from low so
cioeconomic backgrounds and recruiting from
regions of the U.S. that are underrepresented
in Stanford's applicant pool. This kind of re
cruitment is likely to yield diversity of thought
and experience, the only legitimate kind of di
versity toward which a university should strive.
Of course, race as a politically divisive issue
will not disappear anytime soon. But I have
faith that it is on a gradual path to obsoles
cence. Consider this prophecy by John
McWhorter: "A hundred years from now, the
marvelous inevitability of interracial mixture
will have created a deliriously miscegenated
America where hundreds of millions of caf£-
au-lait Tiger Woodses and Mariah Careys will
be quite secure in knowing that American is
'who they are.'"
