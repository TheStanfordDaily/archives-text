Stanford Review apologizes for
plagiarizing Tne Daily
As the last issue of this volume of
The Stanford Daily approaches, I
would like to apologize again fora fair
ly serious mistake that was made in the
first issue of my autumn volume as edi
tor of The Stanford Review.
An article on Ehud Barak was sub
mitted in which the writer's name was
inadvertently lost. I did editorial work
on the piece and contributed to it sig

nificantly; as is sometimes done in
cases like this, my name was attached
to the article.
Four weeks later I discovered that
several phrases from the piece, includ
ing a witty introduction, were taken
from a Daily article by Jennifer Graham
and Will Oremus. In the 16-year histo
ry of The Stanford Review, nothing like
this has ever happened, and we sin
cerely apologize to Graham, Oremus
and the staff of The Stanford Daily for
this mistake.

Congratulations on a successful vol
ume. I commend you and your staff for
the dedicated and professional work you
do on behalf of the Stanford community.

Editor's Note: In the Oct. 24 issue of The
Stanford Review, the article "Barak: Terror
must be defeated"copied 10phrases verbatim
from "Barak addresses packed house at Mem
And," an article on the front page of The
Stanford Daily's Oct. 17 issue.
