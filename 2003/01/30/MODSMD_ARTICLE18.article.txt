## Battling injury, Toppel still at the top of his game 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Curt Toppel steps onto
the volleyball court, he's going to
make an impact regardless of any
pain he might be feeling — and
he's had plenty of that lately.

at No. 8 Northridge, Friday, 7:00 p.m.
at No. 12 UCSB, Saturday, 5:00 p.m.

Three weeks ago Toppel refrac
tured a thumb that had kept him
out of service all fall, and last week
he aggravated a lingering abdomi
nal strain, keeping him out of prac
tice this week.
But this week the senior Ail-
American opposite hitter still
earned National Player of the
Week honors for the second time
in his career. In addition, Toppel
was named the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Player of the
Week.
Batding through his ailments,
Toppel guided Stanford to its first
win at Hawaii in five years, as the
No. 10 Cardinal split a pair of

matches with the then-No. 1 War
riors last week in Honolulu.
Toppel led the Stanford squad
to a comeback victory in the second
match on Friday, recording 26
kills, eight digs and two service
aces. That was on top of 25 kills,
five digs and one service ace he had
in the first-match loss two days ear
lier.
"I'm really humbled by [the
Player of the Week award]," Top
pel said. "I feel like the entire team
should have gotten it, but still, it's
very nice to get it."
Rather than simply being satis
fied with Player of the Week hon
ors, Toppel is motivated to play
even harder.
"It's really nice to get the recog
nition," Toppel said. "But at the
same time, you don't want to lay
back and say, 'I'm doing really well
at this point, so I don't have to keep
working hard.'"
Stanford may have just started
to put a dent in its schedule this
season, but it's been a long year al
ready for Toppel.

Despite nagging injuries that have sidelined him during games and inhibit
ed his training, Curt Toppel led the Cardinal men's vollevball team to a vic
tory over No. i Hawaii — Stanford's first win in Honolulu in five years.
