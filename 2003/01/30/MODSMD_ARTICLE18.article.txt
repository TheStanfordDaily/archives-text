## Battling injury, Toppel still at the top of his game 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Curt Toppel steps onto
the volleyball court, he's going to
make an impact regardless of any
pain he might be feeling — and
he's had plenty of that lately.

Three weeks ago Toppel refrac
tured a thumb that had kept him
out of service all fall, and last week
he aggravated a lingering abdomi
nal strain, keeping him out of prac
tice this week.
But this week the senior Ail-
American opposite hitter still
earned National Player of the
Week honors for the second time
in his career. In addition, Toppel
was named the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Player of the
Week.
Batding through his ailments,
Toppel guided Stanford to its first
win at Hawaii in five years, as the
No. 10 Cardinal split a pair of

matches with the then-No. 1 War
riors last week in Honolulu.
Toppel led the Stanford squad
to a comeback victory in the second
match on Friday, recording 26
kills, eight digs and two service
aces. That was on top of 25 kills,
five digs and one service ace he had
in the first-match loss two days ear
lier.
"I'm really humbled by [the
Player of the Week award]," Top
pel said. "I feel like the entire team
should have gotten it, but still, it's
very nice to get it."
Rather than simply being satis
fied with Player of the Week hon
ors, Toppel is motivated to play
even harder.
"It's really nice to get the recog
nition," Toppel said. "But at the
same time, you don't want to lay
back and say, 'I'm doing really well
at this point, so I don't have to keep
working hard.'"
Stanford may have just started
to put a dent in its schedule this
season, but it's been a long year al
ready for Toppel.

Despite nagging injuries that have sidelined him during games and inhibit
ed his training, Curt Toppel led the Cardinal men's vollevball team to a vic
tory over No. i Hawaii — Stanford's first win in Honolulu in five years.
His first health setback came at
the end of this past summer, which
he spent training with the U.S. na
tional team. A thumb injury took
him out of action for three months
during the fall.
Mostly recovered, Toppel
joined Stanford for preseason ac
tion as die team traveled to Santa
Barbara for the Elephant-Bar Invi
tational earlier this month. But
during the team's last match
against Long Beach State, Toppel
fractured the freshly healed thumb
when attempting to dig a ball.

Adding to the frustration of his
reinjured thumb, Toppel left the
match with a slight pull of his right
abdominal muscle.
With his abdominal muscle feel
ing better and a special cast for his
thumb, Toppel played through
Stanford's first three conference
matches without any problems.
"[The cast] protects the thumb,"
Toppel said. "It doesn't hurt at all
when I play. It just makes my hand
a little clumsy, but other than that it
doesn't affect me too much because
it's on my non-hitting hand."
But in the Cardinal's fourth
match, the win over Hawaii, Top
pel aggravated his abdominal pull
during the second game.
Stanford was forced to switch to

a smaller lineup in the event that
Toppel could not continue playing.
The strain kept Toppel out of
practice this week.
"[The abdominal pull] is a very
nagging injury," Toppel said. "It's
something that doesn't really get
better. It actually gets a little worse
over time. Each time I play, it tears
a tiny bit more. Sometimes I wish I
just had a new body."
As the teams in the MPSF are
very evenly matched this season,
each player's best play is needed for
every contest, especially consider
ing the Cardinal's disappointing 1-
3 start in conference play — the
team is 3-5 overall.
"Obviously Curt's play is very
critical to the team's success," said

Stanford coach Don Shaw. "But it is
my job to insure that the team isn't
just built around one player."
The team hopes to be at full
strength with two important con
ference matches coming up this
weekend.
The Cardinal takes on No. 8 Cal
State Northridge (6-2, 2-1 MPSF)
tomorrow and No. 12 UC-Santa
Barbara (3-5, 1-2) on Saturday.
"Matches against any team in
the conference are going to be real
ly tough," said Shaw. "This trip is
really important so that we can
bring ourselves up in conference
standings, so we really want Curt to
be at his absolute best. But at the
same time we don't want to risk any
further injury."

riors last week in Honolulu.
Toppel led the Stanford squad
to a comeback victory in the second
match on Friday, recording 26
kills, eight digs and two service
aces. That was on top of 25 kills,
five digs and one service ace he had
in the first-match loss two days ear
lier.
"I'm really humbled by [the
Player of the Week award]," Top
pel said. "I feel like the entire team
should have gotten it, but still, it's
very nice to get it."
Rather than simply being satis
fied with Player of the Week hon
ors, Toppel is motivated to play
even harder.
"It's really nice to get the recog
nition," Toppel said. "But at the
same time, you don't want to lay
back and say, 'I'm doing really well
at this point, so I don't have to keep
working hard.'"
Stanford may have just started
to put a dent in its schedule this
season, but it's been a long year al
ready for Toppel.

Despite nagging injuries that have sidelined him during games and inhibit
ed his training, Curt Toppel led the Cardinal men's vollevball team to a vic
tory over No. i Hawaii — Stanford's first win in Honolulu in five years.
His first health setback came at
the end of this past summer, which
he spent training with the U.S. na
tional team. A thumb injury took
him out of action for three months
during the fall.
Mostly recovered, Toppel
joined Stanford for preseason ac
tion as die team traveled to Santa
Barbara for the Elephant-Bar Invi
tational earlier this month. But
during the team's last match
against Long Beach State, Toppel
fractured the freshly healed thumb
when attempting to dig a ball.

Adding to the frustration of his
reinjured thumb, Toppel left the
match with a slight pull of his right
abdominal muscle.
With his abdominal muscle feel
ing better and a special cast for his
thumb, Toppel played through
Stanford's first three conference
matches without any problems.
"[The cast] protects the thumb,"
Toppel said. "It doesn't hurt at all
when I play. It just makes my hand
a little clumsy, but other than that it
doesn't affect me too much because
it's on my non-hitting hand."
But in the Cardinal's fourth
match, the win over Hawaii, Top
pel aggravated his abdominal pull
during the second game.
Stanford was forced to switch to

a smaller lineup in the event that
Toppel could not continue playing.
The strain kept Toppel out of
practice this week.
"[The abdominal pull] is a very
nagging injury," Toppel said. "It's
something that doesn't really get
better. It actually gets a little worse
over time. Each time I play, it tears
a tiny bit more. Sometimes I wish I
just had a new body."
As the teams in the MPSF are
very evenly matched this season,
each player's best play is needed for
every contest, especially consider
ing the Cardinal's disappointing 1-
3 start in conference play — the
team is 3-5 overall.
"Obviously Curt's play is very
critical to the team's success," said

Stanford coach Don Shaw. "But it is
my job to insure that the team isn't
just built around one player."
The team hopes to be at full
strength with two important con
ference matches coming up this
weekend.
The Cardinal takes on No. 8 Cal
State Northridge (6-2, 2-1 MPSF)
tomorrow and No. 12 UC-Santa
Barbara (3-5, 1-2) on Saturday.
"Matches against any team in
the conference are going to be real
ly tough," said Shaw. "This trip is
really important so that we can
bring ourselves up in conference
standings, so we really want Curt to
be at his absolute best. But at the
same time we don't want to risk any
further injury."
