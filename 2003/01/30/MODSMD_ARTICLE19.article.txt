# His game improved from a stint on the pro tour;
## Ryan Haviland is back on the Farm 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While his teammates on the No.
4 Stanford men's tennis team were
busy studying and taking exams
last quarter, senior Ail-American
Ryan Haviland was traveling
around the United States on the
professional tennis tour.

Men's Tennis
at No. 9 Cal, Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

At the end of his junior year,
Haviland was only two quarters
away from graduating, so he de
cided to take fall quarter off to
see if his game was ready for the
pro tour, while still maintaining
his amateur status. He will grad
uate this June with a degree in
sociology.
"I'm planning on having a pro
fessional career after I graduate,"
Haviland said. "It was like getting
a summer internship. It's really
important to get your feet wet and
know what it's all about."
Spending pre-graduation time
on the tour can be a tremendous
advantage for players to not only
gain some professional experience
to prepare them for their post-col
legiate careers, but to also try and
establish a world ranking before
they graduate.
In recent years, former Stan
ford players Alex Kim and Paul
Goldstein also took off fall quarter
of their senior years to play pro
fessionally. According to associate
head coach John Whitlinger, "If
you only have two quarters to go
to graduate, then I think it's a
smart thing to try and get a leg up
on the tour."
Haviland's stint on the tour
proved to be a valuable learning
experience. Making travel
arrangements, budgeting living
expenses and choosing which
tournaments to play in are just

some of the day-to-day tasks that
players have to learn to do for
themselves after leaving college.
But the most important lesson
that Haviland learned from being
on the professional circuit was a
humbling one.
"Being on tour, you're going to
lose pretty much every week, and
you have to learn how to deal with
it,"he said. "I'm much more level
headed about my expectations.
You want to go out and set the
world ablaze right off the bat, but
in reality that never happens."
The higher level of competition
and the opportunity to concen
trate solely on tennis certainly al
lowed Haviland to make positive
strides in his game. He feels he im
proved his serve, his transitions to
the net, his slice backhand and his
net coverage.
Haviland's time away from the
Farm also made him appreciate
what he was missing.
"I'm looking forward to that
transition to the professional level,
but I'm really cherishing my last
stint here at Stanford," he said.
"I'm really glad to be back in col
lege right now.
"It can get lonely out there trav
eling by yourself for six months. I
missed the team atmosphere. It's
great to have a team of guys with
you all the time."
Can the coaching staff see any
differences in Haviland's game
since he's returned to campus?
"All aspects of his game have
gotten better," Whitlinger said.
"He just keeps working and im
proving. His game has matured
very well."
The key to Haviland's consis
tent improvement, not only in the
last year but also over the course of
his entire Stanford career, is his
strong work ethic.
"He's been coming in at least a
half-hour before practice every
day and working on improving

every little thing," Whitlinger said.
"He's putting the time into the
weight room. He's doing all the
right things to have a great senior
season."
Last year, Haviland reached the
semifinals of the NCAA individual
championships in Athens, Ga. In
the semifinal round, he lost a
tough three-set battle, in which se

vere leg cramps may have cost him
a shot at the championship match.
"My game is in a good place,"
said Haviland. "If 1 can stay
healthy, I've got a chance of having
a great year and contending again
for the title."

take on the No. 9 California (1-0)
to open its dual-match season and
its Pacific-10 Conference sched
ule. The match will take place at
noon on Saturday at the Hellman
Tennis Complex in Berkeley.
This will be the first action the
Cardinal has seen since Novem
ber.
"We've practiced so much
against each other that I think the
guys will be so thrilled to see an
other person on the other side of
the net besides a teammate,"
Whitlinger said. "I think we're
going to come out firing."
The Bears field one of their
strongest teams in recent memory.

Cal started its dual-match sea
son by taking down No. 18 Pepper
dine 5-2 in Malibu two weeks ago.
"I expect a heck of a match,"
Whitlinger said. "We're jumping
into the fire right away. This is a
tough test for us right off the bat."
Last year, both meetings ended
with a final score of 4-3, with each
school winning as the visiting
team. Cal's win ended the Cardi
nal's 75-match home winning
streak and was its first victory over
Stanford since 1991, putting a hint

world ablaze right off the bat, but
in reality that never happens."
The higher level of competition
and the opportunity to concen
trate solely on tennis certainly al
lowed Haviland to make positive
strides in his game. He feels he im
proved his serve, his transitions to
the net, his slice backhand and his
net coverage.
Haviland's time away from the
Farm also made him appreciate
what he was missing.
"I'm looking forward to that
transition to the professional level,
but I'm really cherishing my last
stint here at Stanford," he said.
"I'm really glad to be back in col
lege right now.
"It can get lonely out there trav
eling by yourself for six months. I
missed the team atmosphere. It's
great to have a team of guys with
you all the time."
Can the coaching staff see any
differences in Haviland's game
since he's returned to campus?
"All aspects of his game have
gotten better," Whitlinger said.
"He just keeps working and im
proving. His game has matured
very well."
The key to Haviland's consis
tent improvement, not only in the
last year but also over the course of
his entire Stanford career, is his
strong work ethic.
"He's been coming in at least a
half-hour before practice every
day and working on improving

every little thing," Whitlinger said.
"He's putting the time into the
weight room. He's doing all the
right things to have a great senior
season."
Last year, Haviland reached the
semifinals of the NCAA individual
championships in Athens, Ga. In
the semifinal round, he lost a
tough three-set battle, in which se

vere leg cramps may have cost him
a shot at the championship match.
"My game is in a good place,"
said Haviland. "If 1 can stay
healthy, I've got a chance of having
a great year and contending again
for the title."

This will be the first action the
Cardinal has seen since Novem

"We've practiced so much
against each other that I think the
guys will be so thrilled to see an
other person on the other side of
the net besides a teammate,"
Whitlinger said. "I think we're
going to come out firing."
The Bears field one of their
strongest teams in recent memory.
They return all six starters and
have added senior transfer Steve

"I expect a heck of a match,"
Whitlinger said. "We're jumping

tough test for us right off the bat."
Last year, both meetings ended
with a final score of 4-3, with each
school winning as the visiting
team. Cal's win ended the Cardi
nal's 75-match home winning
streak and was its first victory over
Stanford since 1991, putting a hint
of revenge in the minds of the re

While his teammates on the No.
4 Stanford men's tennis team were
busy studying and taking exams
last quarter, senior Ail-American
Ryan Haviland was traveling
around the United States on the
professional tennis tour.

Men's Tennis
at No. 9 Cal, Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

At the end of his junior year,
Haviland was only two quarters
away from graduating, so he de
cided to take fall quarter off to
see if his game was ready for the
pro tour, while still maintaining
his amateur status. He will grad
uate this June with a degree in
sociology.
"I'm planning on having a pro
fessional career after I graduate,"
Haviland said. "It was like getting
a summer internship. It's really
important to get your feet wet and
know what it's all about."
Spending pre-graduation time
on the tour can be a tremendous
advantage for players to not only
gain some professional experience
to prepare them for their post-col
legiate careers, but to also try and
establish a world ranking before
they graduate.
In recent years, former Stan
ford players Alex Kim and Paul
Goldstein also took off fall quarter
of their senior years to play pro
fessionally. According to associate
head coach John Whitlinger, "If
you only have two quarters to go
to graduate, then I think it's a
smart thing to try and get a leg up
on the tour."
Haviland's stint on the tour
proved to be a valuable learning
experience. Making travel
arrangements, budgeting living
expenses and choosing which
tournaments to play in are just

some of the day-to-day tasks that
players have to learn to do for
themselves after leaving college.
But the most important lesson
that Haviland learned from being
on the professional circuit was a
humbling one.
"Being on tour, you're going to
lose pretty much every week, and
you have to learn how to deal with
it,"he said. "I'm much more level
headed about my expectations.
You want to go out and set the
world ablaze right off the bat, but
in reality that never happens."
The higher level of competition
and the opportunity to concen
trate solely on tennis certainly al
lowed Haviland to make positive
