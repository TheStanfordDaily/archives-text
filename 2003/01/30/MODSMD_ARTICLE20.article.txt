# Sloshball, Cool Rubin and the year in sports
## 
### 
With this being my last column of this
volume of The Daily, I think it's
time to stop, take a breath, and
look back at some of the events of
the last five and a half months.
First of all, how did I ever convince The Daily
to give me free reign once a week to write what
ever I wanted? I suppose that's an issue for an
other day (and probably another paper).
Anyway, it doesn't seem that long ago that
columns extolling the virtues of fall sloshball and
barbeques filled this space with visions of cool
kegs and hot diving outfield saves. As the weath
er got colder there was an intense literary exam
ination of Full Moon on the Quad. We had an
epic poem about the rally monkey, a character
summary of Barry Bonds (aloof, in a word), and
the X-factor.
There was a ghostwritten column, courtesy
of Cool Rubin and Butterbean sending in that
letter describing their "beer mile." (Rumor has
it, by the way, that Butterbean has competed in

subsequent beer miles, and
has, in fact, recently returned
from the woods of the Pacific
Northwest where he had re
treated to train. Though de
tails about his comeback are
few and far between, it seems
that a challenge has indeed
been issued. Stay tuned as fur
ther events will be reported as
news warrants.)

There was a softly written eulogy for the Nar
nia IM ultimate team, which went down 12-0 in
a furious blaze of glory in the Division II playoffs,
and a sailing ode to the homeopathic powers of
New Year's Day bowl games.
Now at this point you might say, "Why the ret
rospective?" A just question. The answer is that
in order to truly understand where future
columns (say, next volume) are coming from, we
must fully understand their origins. That and
the real fact that there is almost nothing hap

pening in the world of sports right now.
Super Bowl over. Pro 80w1... no one cares.
Hockey All-Star Break ... a toss-up between
tuning into that bad boy and a rerun of an E-50
lecture in the basement of Green.
Baseball... not many hot stoves in the hot
stove season, with little or no gossip to report and
mock now that winter meetings are over.
College Hoops .. . the lone bright star in the
cloudy sports sky.
Even with one-point victories over those
chumps from SoCal, and buzzer beaters and di
aper dandies, everyone in their right mind
knows that there are still weeks left before college
hoops gets serious. Before bracketology means
anything, before you can really talk about RPI
-100 wins, and road losses, and momentum, and
who are your last four in and last four out.
So let us take this chance then to look forward
to the future and the bounty (or, in the spirit of


Matt Babin
the Tampa Bay Bucs, the booty)
that awaits us. Next volume we'll be
graced with the presence of the re
turn of Major League Baseball,
Stanford baseball's trek back to
Omaha, March and all of its Mad
ness, hockey playoffs — and oh
yes, more sloshball.
Life is good, isn't it?
At least in the sports world, any

way. (As long as you're not Barrett
Robbins.)
So here's to the sports stories of
this past volume and the anticipa
tion of the stories still to come,
whatever they may be. There will
be excruciatingly detailed ac
counts of athletic activity on Lake
Lag — if it continues to fill up and
make that possible. There will be
more smack talked about the East
Coast, especially if the sun contin
ues to shine.
Will we have another survey of
campus reactions to sporting

events? Of course. (The early fa
vorite explanation already being
"not enough sloshball on campus.")
Finally, will we get another letter
from Cool Rubin? Now you can
never know — but I'm fairly confi
dent. Time alone will tell.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in eco
nomics and Italian who really does think
Cool Rubin will send him another letter.
He '5 also starting to think that launching
water balloons should be an IM sport,
somehow. You can contact him at
babin @stanford. edu.
