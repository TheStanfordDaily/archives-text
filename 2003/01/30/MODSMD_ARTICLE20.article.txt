# Sloshball, Cool Rubin and the year in sports
## 
### 
With this being my last column of this
volume of The Daily, I think it's
time to stop, take a breath, and
look back at some of the events of
the last five and a half months.
First of all, how did I ever convince The Daily
to give me free reign once a week to write what
ever I wanted? I suppose that's an issue for an
other day (and probably another paper).
Anyway, it doesn't seem that long ago that
columns extolling the virtues of fall sloshball and
barbeques filled this space with visions of cool
kegs and hot diving outfield saves. As the weath
er got colder there was an intense literary exam
ination of Full Moon on the Quad. We had an
epic poem about the rally monkey, a character
summary of Barry Bonds (aloof, in a word), and
the X-factor.
There was a ghostwritten column, courtesy
of Cool Rubin and Butterbean sending in that
letter describing their "beer mile." (Rumor has
it, by the way, that Butterbean has competed in

subsequent beer miles, and
has, in fact, recently returned
from the woods of the Pacific
Northwest where he had re
treated to train. Though de
tails about his comeback are
few and far between, it seems
that a challenge has indeed
been issued. Stay tuned as fur
ther events will be reported as
news warrants.)

There was a softly written eulogy for the Nar
nia IM ultimate team, which went down 12-0 in
a furious blaze of glory in the Division II playoffs,
and a sailing ode to the homeopathic powers of
New Year's Day bowl games.
Now at this point you might say, "Why the ret
rospective?" A just question. The answer is that
in order to truly understand where future
columns (say, next volume) are coming from, we
must fully understand their origins. That and
the real fact that there is almost nothing hap

pening in the world of sports right now.
Super Bowl over. Pro 80w1... no one cares.
Hockey All-Star Break ... a toss-up between
tuning into that bad boy and a rerun of an E-50
lecture in the basement of Green.
Baseball... not many hot stoves in the hot
stove season, with little or no gossip to report and
mock now that winter meetings are over.
College Hoops .. . the lone bright star in the
cloudy sports sky.
Even with one-point victories over those
chumps from SoCal, and buzzer beaters and di
aper dandies, everyone in their right mind
knows that there are still weeks left before college
hoops gets serious. Before bracketology means
anything, before you can really talk about RPI
-100 wins, and road losses, and momentum, and
who are your last four in and last four out.
So let us take this chance then to look forward
to the future and the bounty (or, in the spirit of
