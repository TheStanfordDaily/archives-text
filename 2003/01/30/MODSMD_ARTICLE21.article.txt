# A 						new era for women sprinters
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
First, name a former Stanford
athlete who has won a national title
at any event from 60 to 400 meters.

Indoor Track

That's an easy one — Chrystie
Gaines.
Now, name a second.
Other than Gaines, Stanford's
success at the sprints has been just
average while Southern California
and UCLA consistendy have some
of the top sprinters in the nation
and use them to rise to the top of
the NCAA.
But over the last few years,
things have been changing on the
Farm.
"UCLA says you got to get up
early," said Stanford freshman
Chauntae Bayne. "Well, we're up."
Despite having no seniors and
just one junior, the Cardinal
women's sprint squad posted four

victories at its opening meet, in
cluding an NCAA provisional qual
ifying time in the 60-meter dash by
freshman Jakki Bailey.
Freshman Ashley Purnell posted
the eighth-fastest time in Stanford
history with her 24.16-second win
in the 200 meters, while the 1,600-
meter relay team also posted the
eighth-fastest time in the school
record books by winning that event
in 3 minutes, 46.14 seconds. Both
these times were set on an indoor
track where performances are typi
cally slower.
"Before the 1,600-meter relay,
we lined up on the inside of the
track and did a stride-out as a
team," said junior Lindsey John
son. "It was just amazing to be able
to fill all eight lanes with Stanford
sprinters."
Part of the reason for this success
was Stanford's first large sprinting
class in many years. It brought na
tionally ranked and highly touted
sprinters to Stanford to add to the
small but strong core of runners al
ready on the Farm.

"This is a very big change from
where I came from," Bailey said.
"Coming in as a freshman, I hadn't
been exposed to much of the work
we've been doing. However, the en
ergy and personality of the team
made the transition easier."
The sprinters lack seniors, but
have found leadership both within
their squad — from Johnson and
sophomore Christine Moschella —
and from veterans in other events.
"We definitely looked to the up
perclassmen a lot in the beginning,"
said Purnell. "They gave us more
confidence that we could do the
training and handle the morning
workouts."
"We also look to each other,"
added freshman Chinny Offor. "It
takes everyone, not just individuals,
to represent the Stanford name and
show what Stanford has."
Obviously, the freshmen have
weathered the transition well and
the upperclassmen have stayed in
top form to bring such exciting

has the potential, for the first time in many years, to make an impact on the national level.
early-season results. These perfor
mances now provide a springboard
for the remainder of the indoor
and outdoor seasons.
"I think we have a shot of win
ning the indoor and outdoor Pac
-10 Championships," Bayne said.
"We are also in great position to
place well at nationals."
This optimism will be put to the
test on Saturday as the track team
travels to the Husky Indoor Invita
tional in Seattle, which will feature
UCLA, Wisconsin, Oregon and
Washington. All these programs
have much older and experienced
squads, but that doesn't scare the
sprinters.
"Our biggest advantage is our
willingness to learn," said freshman
Nashonme Johnson. "We aren't
stuck in old ways of doing things.
It's exciting to see this team so
young and have decent times in the
first meet."
"This is not about sprint versus
distance," said sprint coach Edrick
Floreal. "This is about being com
petitive with any school.
"I credit the athletes like Lindsey
[Johnson] and Christine [Moschel
la] who had a vision of wfiat this pro
gram can be. It's easy to come into a
program where you have many

people to train with, but it took
courage to come here and help
build a sprint program. Now, Stan
ford is an all-around great team."
This weekend will display the
all-around ability of the Stanford
team, as most of the distance and
field squads will debut to support
the sprints.
"Almost everyone will open
up," said Vin Lananna, director of
track and field. "There will be
some good competition there.
Most of the athletes will be focused
on qualifying marks this week. For
others, we are looking ahead two
weeks to try and produce some
faster times."
Stanford is currently ranked
sixth in the men's Trackwire na
tional rankings and seventh in the
women's. UCLA is ranked fifth in
the women's poll, while Oregon
and Washington both rank in the
top 25.
But no Stanford sprinter or
sprint relay team is even mentioned
in the rankings. The Cardinal
sprinters may be young and, to
date, unrecognized, but they hope
to soon prove that they can be com
petitive on the national level.
The Cardinal will start to make
its case Friday night with the dis
tance medley relay and then con
tinue on Saturday morning with
the weight throw at 9:00 a.m.
Offor summed it up best: "We
are going to turn heads."

"Our biggest advantage is our
willingness to learn," said freshman
Nashonme Johnson. "We aren't
stuck in old ways of doing things.
It's exciting to see this team so
young and have decent times in the
first meet."
"This is not about sprint versus
distance," said sprint coach Edrick
Floreal. "This is about being com
petitive with any school.
"I credit the athletes like Lindsey
[Johnson] and Christine [Moschel
la] who had a vision of wfiat this pro
gram can be. It's easy to come into a
program where you have many

people to train with, but it took
courage to come here and help
build a sprint program. Now, Stan
ford is an all-around great team."
This weekend will display the
all-around ability of the Stanford
team, as most of the distance and
field squads will debut to support
the sprints.
"Almost everyone will open
up," said Vin Lananna, director of
track and field. "There will be
some good competition there.
Most of the athletes will be focused
on qualifying marks this week. For
others, we are looking ahead two
weeks to try and produce some
faster times."
Stanford is currently ranked
sixth in the men's Trackwire na
tional rankings and seventh in the
women's. UCLA is ranked fifth in
the women's poll, while Oregon
and Washington both rank in the
top 25.
But no Stanford sprinter or
sprint relay team is even mentioned
in the rankings. The Cardinal
sprinters may be young and, to
date, unrecognized, but they hope
to soon prove that they can be com
petitive on the national level.
The Cardinal will start to make
its case Friday night with the dis
tance medley relay and then con
tinue on Saturday morning with
the weight throw at 9:00 a.m.
Offor summed it up best: "We
are going to turn heads."
First, name a former Stanford
athlete who has won a national title
at any event from 60 to 400 meters.

That's an easy one — Chrystie
Gaines.
Now, name a second.
Other than Gaines, Stanford's
success at the sprints has been just
average while Southern California
and UCLA consistendy have some
of the top sprinters in the nation
and use them to rise to the top of
the NCAA.
But over the last few years,
things have been changing on the
Farm.
"UCLA says you got to get up
early," said Stanford freshman
Chauntae Bayne. "Well, we're up."
Despite having no seniors and
just one junior, the Cardinal
women's sprint squad posted four

victories at its opening meet, in
cluding an NCAA provisional qual
ifying time in the 60-meter dash by
freshman Jakki Bailey.
Freshman Ashley Purnell posted
the eighth-fastest time in Stanford
history with her 24.16-second win
in the 200 meters, while the 1,600-
meter relay team also posted the
eighth-fastest time in the school
record books by winning that event
in 3 minutes, 46.14 seconds. Both
these times were set on an indoor
track where performances are typi
cally slower.
"Before the 1,600-meter relay,
we lined up on the inside of the
track and did a stride-out as a
team," said junior Lindsey John
son. "It was just amazing to be able
to fill all eight lanes with Stanford
sprinters."
Part of the reason for this success
was Stanford's first large sprinting
class in many years. It brought na
tionally ranked and highly touted
sprinters to Stanford to add to the
small but strong core of runners al
ready on the Farm.

"This is a very big change from
where I came from," Bailey said.
"Coming in as a freshman, I hadn't
been exposed to much of the work
we've been doing. However, the en
ergy and personality of the team
made the transition easier."
The sprinters lack seniors, but
have found leadership both within
their squad — from Johnson and
sophomore Christine Moschella —
and from veterans in other events.
"We definitely looked to the up
perclassmen a lot in the beginning,"
said Purnell. "They gave us more
confidence that we could do the
training and handle the morning
workouts."
"We also look to each other,"
added freshman Chinny Offor. "It
takes everyone, not just individuals,
to represent the Stanford name and
show what Stanford has."
Obviously, the freshmen have
weathered the transition well and
the upperclassmen have stayed in
top form to bring such exciting

A large group of young, talented sprinters on the women's track squad has demonstrated in the early season that it
has the potential, for the first time in many years, to make an impact on the national level.
early-season results. These perfor
mances now provide a springboard
for the remainder of the indoor
and outdoor seasons.
"I think we have a shot of win
ning the indoor and outdoor Pac
-10 Championships," Bayne said.
"We are also in great position to
place well at nationals."
This optimism will be put to the
test on Saturday as the track team
travels to the Husky Indoor Invita
tional in Seattle, which will feature
UCLA, Wisconsin, Oregon and
Washington. All these programs
have much older and experienced
squads, but that doesn't scare the
