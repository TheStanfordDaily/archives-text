						new era for women sprinters

### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
First, name a former Stanford
athlete who has won a national title
at any event from 60 to 400 meters.

Indoor Track
at Husky Invitational in Seattle, Saturday

That's an easy one — Chrystie
Gaines.
Now, name a second.
Other than Gaines, Stanford's
success at the sprints has been just
average while Southern California
and UCLA consistendy have some
of the top sprinters in the nation
and use them to rise to the top of
the NCAA.
But over the last few years,
things have been changing on the
Farm.
"UCLA says you got to get up
early," said Stanford freshman
Chauntae Bayne. "Well, we're up."
Despite having no seniors and
just one junior, the Cardinal
women's sprint squad posted four

victories at its opening meet, in
cluding an NCAA provisional qual
ifying time in the 60-meter dash by
freshman Jakki Bailey.
Freshman Ashley Purnell posted
the eighth-fastest time in Stanford
history with her 24.16-second win
in the 200 meters, while the 1,600-
meter relay team also posted the
eighth-fastest time in the school
record books by winning that event
in 3 minutes, 46.14 seconds. Both
these times were set on an indoor
track where performances are typi
cally slower.
"Before the 1,600-meter relay,
we lined up on the inside of the
track and did a stride-out as a
team," said junior Lindsey John
son. "It was just amazing to be able
to fill all eight lanes with Stanford
sprinters."
Part of the reason for this success
was Stanford's first large sprinting
class in many years. It brought na
tionally ranked and highly touted
sprinters to Stanford to add to the
small but strong core of runners al
ready on the Farm.

"This is a very big change from
where I came from," Bailey said.
"Coming in as a freshman, I hadn't
been exposed to much of the work
we've been doing. However, the en
ergy and personality of the team
made the transition easier."
The sprinters lack seniors, but
have found leadership both within
their squad — from Johnson and
sophomore Christine Moschella —
and from veterans in other events.
"We definitely looked to the up
perclassmen a lot in the beginning,"
said Purnell. "They gave us more
confidence that we could do the
training and handle the morning
workouts."
"We also look to each other,"
added freshman Chinny Offor. "It
takes everyone, not just individuals,
to represent the Stanford name and
show what Stanford has."
Obviously, the freshmen have
weathered the transition well and
the upperclassmen have stayed in
top form to bring such exciting

A large group of young, talented sprinters on the women's track squad has demonstrated in the early season that it
has the potential, for the first time in many years, to make an impact on the national level.
