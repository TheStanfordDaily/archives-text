# Card faces Arizona St. and No. 1 'Cats
## 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
There is a certain amount of
confidence about the way the Stan
ford men's basketball team is ap
proaching its road trip to Arizona
this week.
There's a certain amount of en
thusiasm and hope in the way that
the Cardinal (14-5, 5-2 Pacific-10
Conference) is talking about its
games against No. 1 Arizona (15-1,
7-0) tonight and Arizona State (12-
6, 4-3) on Saturday.

Men's Basketball
at No. 1 Arizona, Tonight, 5:30 p.m.
at Arizona St., Saturday, 2:00 p.m.

And there's a certain amount of
youthful idealism in there as well.
"These are two games that we'd
love to get," said junior shooting
guard Matt Lottich. "We're going
to go out there, and we want to
play hard. We know these two
teams are very capable, and we
have all the respect in the world for
them. But we're looking to go out
there and upset some people."
But, here's the reality of the sit
uation.
In the 26 times that the Cardi
nal has faced a team ranked No. 1
in the nation, it has been victorious
only twice — an 82-74 victory over
Arizona in 1988 at Maples and a
win over Duke in the Pete Newell
Challenge in 2000.
Further, the Wildcats have only
been upset once this season. Back
in December, Arizona dropped a
close 66-65 game to Louisiana
State in Baton Rouge, and even
then the Wildcats were playing

without 6-foot-8 senior All-Ameri
can Luke Walton, who was out due
to injury.
"Health-wise, we're in the best
shape we've been in fora while,"
said Arizona head coach Lute
Olson. "I still don't think that
Luke is better than 70 percent. . .
[but] barring any problems today
or tomorrow in practice, we
should be in the best physical con
dition we've been in since before
the season started."
That's not good news for the
Cardinal.
The combination of Walton and
senior point guard Jason Gardner
has proven extremely capable of
leading a balanced Arizona scoring
attack. The tandem has averaged
22 points.
Like the Wildcats, Stanford is
also beginning to walk the slow
road toward injury-recovery. Ju
nior forward Justin Davis, the
Pac-10's leading rebounder,
played his first game since the first
week of January last Saturday
against Southern California.
Sophomore Nick Robinson will
continue to start in his place, but
Davis will again likely be available
off the bench.
How smooth Davis can make
the transition back into game rota
tion and his earlier playing form
could play a major role in the Car
dinal's ability to compete this
weekend. Moreover, with Davis
still not at full strength, other play
ers will have to step up, most no
tably Robinson, who is also suffer
ing from a "quiet" knee injury,
which he won't talk about.
Davis, Robinson and sopho
more Josh Childress will all take

turns guarding Walton.
"This game is really important
for us," Childress said. "Going
there with a [Pac-10] record of 5-2,
it's important for us to come out
there and show what we can do.
Arizona is a really good team —
they've shown that throughout the
season. But I think that we're a re

ally good team too. We just need to
come out and play aggressive both
defensively and offensively and try
to come out with a victory."
Arizona, however, isn't the only
thorn in Stanford's side. The dra
matic improvement of Arizona
State over the past few years,
makes the desert road trip the
