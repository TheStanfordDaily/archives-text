# Frosh-focused dorms considered by ResEd
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In response to a 1997 report
and ongoing trends in freshman
housing preferences, the Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs is discussing a change in resi
dential education that would cre
ate a high concentration of fresh
men in one area of campus, likely
around Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The number of incoming fresh
men who typically request all
frosh housing — approximately
75 percent each year — exceeds
the University's capacity, accord
ing to Asst. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs and Dean of Fresh
men and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims.
"In the current configuration of
housing assignments, we cannot
accommodate all [freshmen] who
want an all-frosh house," said
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for
student affairs.
He added, "We are not contem
plating putting all frosh in one
dorm. First, it would be impossible
and second, it's not what we think
is desirable. We are, however, re
viewing the possibility of strength
ening the all-frosh living experi
ence [while] ensuring that stu
dents who wish to live in a four
class house would still have an op
portunity to do so."
In the 1997 Report of the Task
Force on Residential Programs
and Student Housing for Under
graduates — commissioned by
then-University President Ger
hard Casper and chaired by then-
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar — the
members wrote: "From our con
versations with students and resi
dent fellows, surveys and town
meetings in the residences, the
task force found that first-year stu
dents value and benefit intellectu
ally and socially from residing in

houses that allow for significant in
teraction between first-year stu
dents, allowing them to . .. share
the broad range of intellectual and
social experiences that are com
mon and unique to the freshman
year experience."
Several of the recommenda
tions in the report proposed by the
task force have been put into prac
tice already. For example, the rec
ommendation fora "Fresh
man / Sophomore residential clus
ter and learning community" led
to the creation of
Freshman / Sophomore College.
According to Provost John
Etchemendy, "The current discus
sion [about residential education]
focuses on another recommenda
tion from that report: to enhance
the freshman living and learning
experience by concentrating first
year students in residences with
populations large enough to main
tain a 'critical mass,' and to make
more all-freshman housing in
order to create living situations
that optimize the intellectual and
social environment and also allow
for concentration of services to be
delivered to students."
Though plans for such a
change are only in the discussion
stage, some resident fellows on
campus have expressed appre
hension toward the idea.
"Resident fellows rarely speak
with one voice, but I think you
would find consensus among
them that freshmen should not be
clustered into what amount to
mega-Branners," said Larkin Res
ident Fellow Stephen Stedman, se
nior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
"You might find support from
some of the RFs for increasing the
number of all-frosh residences,
but many insist that there is a real
value in four-class dorms on cam
pus and observe that the presence
of freshmen in four-class dorms is
a real plus in terms of energy and
community," he added. "Finally,
even for those who support more
all-freshmen housing, most would
prefer to see such dorms spread
across campus and not located
solely on the east side."
The 1997 report also included a
set of recommendations concern
ing advising that is currently being
discussed. For example, the task
force suggested the creation of a
live-in "resident tutor" position, to
be filled by advanced graduate stu
dents and postdoctoral fellows.
Resident tutors would work
with resident fellows to "help cre
ate an effective, coordinated advis
ing and mentoring system." The
lesident tutors would also help
handle crisis management and dis
ciplinary issues.
Placing resident tutors would
change the role of resident fellows,

whose main focus would be to
"concentrate on the scholarly as
pects of residential education, in
cluding setting the intellectual
tone of the house, overseeing aca
demic programming and encour
aging various kinds of faculty men
toring activities."
The details and timeline for any
sort of change to residential educa
tion at Stanford have not been de
termined.
"We're still in the discussion
phase, thinking about what we
may be able to do this upcoming
year and what might need to be
phased in," Awakuni said.
Lythcott-Haims added, "There
really isn't a specific proposal on
the table right now. Basically, we
are looking at the existing dorm
configurations to see what might
make the most sense. It is prema
ture to say when any change
would take place, since we don't
even know yet what the changes
would be."
Though ASSU President Moni
ca Henestroza, a senior, said that it
is too early to tell what the effects of
such a change would be on fresh

men, she said that it would "great
ly reduce the amount of choice
that incoming students would
have with regards to their living
environment."
"I think first year students ar
rive with a range of interests,
lifestyles and maturity levels,"
Henestroza added, "and there are
very compelling reasons for allow
ing these students to situate them
selves in that residential environ
ment that they feel will be most
conducive to their success at Stan
ford. That may be in an all-frosh
environment, but for many it
might not."
Awakuni stressed that fresh
men who do not want to live in all
frosh dorms would still have other
options.
"We also want to ensure that
such special programs as Fresh
man / Sophomore College, Struc
tured Liberal Education and the
cultural theme houses are sup
ported as well," he said.
Both Awakuni and Lythcott-
Haims said that if a large number
of freshmen were to be placed in
one area on campus, Stern Hall

and Wilbur Hall, dorms on the
east side of campus, would be logi
cal options because they currently
have the highest concentration of
freshmen and are less popular
with upperclassmen.
Some do not believe that clus
tering freshmen into Stern Hall
and Wilbur Hall would create a
better residential environment on
campus.
"[The changes in this proposal]
would essentially make east cam
pus a freshman campus. It would
isolate people who live in Manzani
ta, Casa Zapata and Okada, and it
would also isolate the freshmen liv
ing in FroSoCo," Stedman said.
Sanghyup Kwak, a freshman
living in a four-class dorm, said,
"I'm really happy with my dorm
situation. I like living with upper
classmen who have more experi
ence and knowledge about college
life, both academically and socially.
I also think that if you had a bunch
of all-frosh dorms in one area, it
would get very rowdy and noisy."
But Gillian Quandt, a freshman
living in an all-frosh dorm in
Wilbur Hall, disagreed.

"I really love living in an all
frosh dorm in a complex that
houses other all-frosh dorms. And
since no one really knows a lot of
people in the beginning, everyone
is willing to meet other people. I
think it's a really great idea to place
all-frosh dorms in one area of cam
pus," she said.
Stedman commented, "Given
the drastic nature of the changes
being considered, resident fellows,
especially freshmen resident fel
lows, resident assistants and stu
dents should participate in any
planning and decision-making."
Both Awakuni and
Etchemendy expressed a commit
ment to seek participation from
the entire Stanford community.
"So far, we've collected lots of
data through surveys and conver
sations with students and alumni.
When and if any plans are formu
lated, students, faculty, staff and
alumni will be consulted and in
volved in the process of determin
ing what will be done," Awakuni
said.
"As with everything that we do
at Stanford, we will continue to

talk to and listen to all interested
individuals," Etchemendy said.
According to Henestroza, die
ASSU has not yet been ap
proached by the administration to
provide input on this issue. The
ASSU is currendy gathering infor
mation and feedback on the po
tential change and expects to be
come more involved soon.
"I think that . . . the
ASSU . . . would have much to
contribute to the discussion, given
our interest in the structure of res
idential life, a student-centered ed
ucational enterprise," Henestroza
said.
While the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs is re
viewing residential education at
Stanford, Awakuni emphasized
that his office is not suggesting that
the current system is flawed.
"The residential program al
ready works very well," Awakuni
said. "We are not about to 'fix
what's not broken.' We simply
want to do what we can to create
the best possible living and learn
ing experience for all of our stu
dents."

live-in "resident tutor" position, to
be filled by advanced graduate stu
dents and postdoctoral fellows.
Resident tutors would work
with resident fellows to "help cre
ate an effective, coordinated advis
ing and mentoring system." The
lesident tutors would also help
handle crisis management and dis
ciplinary issues.
Placing resident tutors would
change the role of resident fellows,

whose main focus would be to
"concentrate on the scholarly as
pects of residential education, in
cluding setting the intellectual
tone of the house, overseeing aca
demic programming and encour
aging various kinds of faculty men
toring activities."
The details and timeline for any
sort of change to residential educa
tion at Stanford have not been de
termined.
"We're still in the discussion
phase, thinking about what we
may be able to do this upcoming
year and what might need to be
phased in," Awakuni said.
Lythcott-Haims added, "There
really isn't a specific proposal on
the table right now. Basically, we
are looking at the existing dorm
configurations to see what might
make the most sense. It is prema
ture to say when any change
would take place, since we don't
even know yet what the changes
would be."
Though ASSU President Moni
ca Henestroza, a senior, said that it
is too early to tell what the effects of
such a change would be on fresh

men, she said that it would "great
ly reduce the amount of choice
that incoming students would
have with regards to their living
environment."
"I think first year students ar
rive with a range of interests,
lifestyles and maturity levels,"
Henestroza added, "and there are
very compelling reasons for allow
ing these students to situate them
selves in that residential environ
ment that they feel will be most
conducive to their success at Stan
ford. That may be in an all-frosh
environment, but for many it
might not."
Awakuni stressed that fresh
men who do not want to live in all
frosh dorms would still have other
options.
"We also want to ensure that
such special programs as Fresh
man / Sophomore College, Struc
tured Liberal Education and the
cultural theme houses are sup
ported as well," he said.
Both Awakuni and Lythcott-
Haims said that if a large number
of freshmen were to be placed in
one area on campus, Stern Hall

and Wilbur Hall, dorms on the
east side of campus, would be logi
cal options because they currently
have the highest concentration of
freshmen and are less popular
with upperclassmen.
Some do not believe that clus
tering freshmen into Stern Hall
and Wilbur Hall would create a
better residential environment on
campus.
"[The changes in this proposal]
would essentially make east cam
pus a freshman campus. It would
isolate people who live in Manzani
ta, Casa Zapata and Okada, and it
would also isolate the freshmen liv
ing in FroSoCo," Stedman said.
Sanghyup Kwak, a freshman
living in a four-class dorm, said,
"I'm really happy with my dorm
situation. I like living with upper
classmen who have more experi
ence and knowledge about college
life, both academically and socially.
I also think that if you had a bunch
of all-frosh dorms in one area, it
would get very rowdy and noisy."
But Gillian Quandt, a freshman
living in an all-frosh dorm in
Wilbur Hall, disagreed.

"I really love living in an all
frosh dorm in a complex that
houses other all-frosh dorms. And
since no one really knows a lot of
people in the beginning, everyone
is willing to meet other people. I
think it's a really great idea to place
all-frosh dorms in one area of cam
pus," she said.
Stedman commented, "Given
the drastic nature of the changes
being considered, resident fellows,
especially freshmen resident fel
lows, resident assistants and stu
dents should participate in any
planning and decision-making."
Both Awakuni and
Etchemendy expressed a commit
ment to seek participation from
the entire Stanford community.
"So far, we've collected lots of
data through surveys and conver
sations with students and alumni.
When and if any plans are formu
lated, students, faculty, staff and
alumni will be consulted and in
volved in the process of determin
ing what will be done," Awakuni
said.
"As with everything that we do
at Stanford, we will continue to

talk to and listen to all interested
individuals," Etchemendy said.
According to Henestroza, die
ASSU has not yet been ap
proached by the administration to
provide input on this issue. The
ASSU is currendy gathering infor
mation and feedback on the po
tential change and expects to be
come more involved soon.
"I think that . . . the
ASSU . . . would have much to
contribute to the discussion, given
our interest in the structure of res
idential life, a student-centered ed
ucational enterprise," Henestroza
said.
While the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs is re
viewing residential education at
Stanford, Awakuni emphasized
that his office is not suggesting that
the current system is flawed.
"The residential program al
ready works very well," Awakuni
said. "We are not about to 'fix
what's not broken.' We simply
want to do what we can to create
the best possible living and learn
ing experience for all of our stu
dents."
In response to a 1997 report
and ongoing trends in freshman
housing preferences, the Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs is discussing a change in resi
dential education that would cre
ate a high concentration of fresh
men in one area of campus, likely
around Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The number of incoming fresh
men who typically request all
frosh housing — approximately
75 percent each year — exceeds
the University's capacity, accord
ing to Asst. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs and Dean of Fresh
men and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims.
"In the current configuration of
housing assignments, we cannot
accommodate all [freshmen] who
want an all-frosh house," said
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for
student affairs.
He added, "We are not contem
plating putting all frosh in one
dorm. First, it would be impossible
and second, it's not what we think
is desirable. We are, however, re
viewing the possibility of strength
ening the all-frosh living experi
ence [while] ensuring that stu
dents who wish to live in a four
class house would still have an op
portunity to do so."
In the 1997 Report of the Task
Force on Residential Programs
and Student Housing for Under
graduates — commissioned by
then-University President Ger
hard Casper and chaired by then-
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar — the
members wrote: "From our con
versations with students and resi
dent fellows, surveys and town
meetings in the residences, the
task force found that first-year stu
dents value and benefit intellectu
ally and socially from residing in

houses that allow for significant in
teraction between first-year stu
dents, allowing them to . .. share
the broad range of intellectual and
social experiences that are com
mon and unique to the freshman
year experience."
Several of the recommenda
tions in the report proposed by the
task force have been put into prac
tice already. For example, the rec
ommendation fora "Fresh
man / Sophomore residential clus
ter and learning community" led
to the creation of
Freshman / Sophomore College.
According to Provost John
Etchemendy, "The current discus
sion [about residential education]
focuses on another recommenda
tion from that report: to enhance
the freshman living and learning
experience by concentrating first
year students in residences with
populations large enough to main
tain a 'critical mass,' and to make
more all-freshman housing in
order to create living situations
that optimize the intellectual and
social environment and also allow
for concentration of services to be
delivered to students."
Though plans for such a
change are only in the discussion
stage, some resident fellows on
campus have expressed appre
hension toward the idea.
"Resident fellows rarely speak
with one voice, but I think you
would find consensus among
them that freshmen should not be
clustered into what amount to
mega-Branners," said Larkin Res
ident Fellow Stephen Stedman, se
nior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
"You might find support from
some of the RFs for increasing the
number of all-frosh residences,
but many insist that there is a real
value in four-class dorms on cam
pus and observe that the presence
of freshmen in four-class dorms is
a real plus in terms of energy and
community," he added. "Finally,
even for those who support more
all-freshmen housing, most would
prefer to see such dorms spread
across campus and not located
solely on the east side."
The 1997 report also included a
set of recommendations concern
ing advising that is currently being
discussed. For example, the task
force suggested the creation of a
live-in "resident tutor" position, to
be filled by advanced graduate stu

pus," she said.
Stedman commented, "Given
the drastic nature of the changes
being considered, resident fellows,
especially freshmen resident fel
lows, resident assistants and stu
dents should participate in any
planning and decision-making."
Both Awakuni and
Etchemendy expressed a commit
ment to seek participation from
the entire Stanford community.
"So far, we've collected lots of
data through surveys and conver
sations with students and alumni.
When and if any plans are formu
lated, students, faculty, staff and
alumni will be consulted and in
volved in the process of determin
ing what will be done," Awakuni
said.
"As with everything that we do
at Stanford, we will continue to

talk to and listen to all interested
individuals," Etchemendy said.
According to Henestroza, die
ASSU has not yet been ap
proached by the administration to
provide input on this issue. The
ASSU is currendy gathering infor
mation and feedback on the po
tential change and expects to be
come more involved soon.
"I think that . . . the
ASSU . . . would have much to
contribute to the discussion, given
our interest in the structure of res
idential life, a student-centered ed
ucational enterprise," Henestroza
said.
While the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs is re
viewing residential education at
Stanford, Awakuni emphasized
that his office is not suggesting that
the current system is flawed.
"The residential program al
ready works very well," Awakuni
said. "We are not about to 'fix
what's not broken.' We simply
want to do what we can to create
the best possible living and learn
ing experience for all of our stu
dents."
