# Frosh-focused dorms considered by ResEd

### CYNTHIA CHO EDITORIAL STAFF 
In response to a 1997 report
and ongoing trends in freshman
housing preferences, the Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs is discussing a change in resi
dential education that would cre
ate a high concentration of fresh
men in one area of campus, likely
around Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The number of incoming fresh
men who typically request all
frosh housing — approximately
75 percent each year — exceeds
the University's capacity, accord
ing to Asst. Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs and Dean of Fresh
men and Transfer Students Julie
Lythcott-Haims.
"In the current configuration of
housing assignments, we cannot
accommodate all [freshmen] who
want an all-frosh house," said
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for
student affairs.
He added, "We are not contem
plating putting all frosh in one
dorm. First, it would be impossible
and second, it's not what we think
is desirable. We are, however, re
viewing the possibility of strength
ening the all-frosh living experi
ence [while] ensuring that stu
dents who wish to live in a four
class house would still have an op
portunity to do so."
In the 1997 Report of the Task
Force on Residential Programs
and Student Housing for Under
graduates — commissioned by
then-University President Ger
hard Casper and chaired by then-
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar — the
members wrote: "From our con
versations with students and resi
dent fellows, surveys and town
meetings in the residences, the
task force found that first-year stu
dents value and benefit intellectu
ally and socially from residing in

houses that allow for significant in
teraction between first-year stu
dents, allowing them to . .. share
the broad range of intellectual and
social experiences that are com
mon and unique to the freshman
year experience."
Several of the recommenda
tions in the report proposed by the
task force have been put into prac
tice already. For example, the rec
ommendation fora "Fresh
man / Sophomore residential clus
ter and learning community" led
to the creation of
Freshman / Sophomore College.
According to Provost John
Etchemendy, "The current discus
sion [about residential education]
focuses on another recommenda
tion from that report: to enhance
the freshman living and learning
experience by concentrating first
year students in residences with
populations large enough to main
tain a 'critical mass,' and to make
more all-freshman housing in
order to create living situations
that optimize the intellectual and
social environment and also allow
for concentration of services to be
delivered to students."
Though plans for such a
change are only in the discussion
stage, some resident fellows on
campus have expressed appre
hension toward the idea.
"Resident fellows rarely speak
with one voice, but I think you
would find consensus among
them that freshmen should not be
clustered into what amount to
mega-Branners," said Larkin Res
ident Fellow Stephen Stedman, se
nior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
"You might find support from
some of the RFs for increasing the
number of all-frosh residences,
but many insist that there is a real
value in four-class dorms on cam
