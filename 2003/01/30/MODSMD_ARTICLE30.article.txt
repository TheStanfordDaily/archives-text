# Cardinal women trounce the Bears at Maples
## Stanford rebounded from a loss to Southern California by crushing the Golden Bears 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a 75-72 loss to Southern Califor
nia on Sunday, the Stanford women's basket
ball team (16-2, 8-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
didn't fool around against California last night.
The Cardinal began the game in attack
mode by immediately taking the ball to the bas
ket on its first three possessions, playing an ag-

gressive, scrambling zone trap, and crashing
the boards. Stanford opened the game with a
16-4 run en route to a 72-48 victory.
From the tone set by the Cardinal in the
opening minutes, the outcome of the game was
never in doubt.
After Stanford's lackluster performance
against USC, head coach Tara VanDerveer
promised there would be lineup changes this
week.
"We're going look at people that have been

stepping up big for us," VanDerveer said.
"Maybe that's something I should have done
earlier."
Sure enough, VanDerveer inserted junior
All America candidate Nicole Powell into the
starting lineup for the first time since she re
turned from a back injury earlier this month.
Although Powell finished with a season-low
nine points, she dominated the game in other
ways â€” especially in rebounding and distribut
ing the ball.
On one play, Powell fought off three Golden
Bears fora defensive rebound, took two drib
bles with her head up, and fired a bullet full
court pass through five California players to
T'Nae Thiel for an easy lay-up.
Time and again Powell used her size to look
over defenders and find open players under
neath the basket. A classic "point-forward" and
Stanford's all-time leader in triple-doubles,
Powell's versatility makes her one of the best
players in the nation. The 6-foot-2 point guard
starts fast breaks with defensive rebounds and
pushes the ball up the floor.
"We were aggressive and got out in transi
tion," VanDerveer said. "I thought Nicole did a
great job of distributing the ball. The key for us
was our defense and aggressiveness. It has been
dormant but it was there [tonight]."
The Cardinal led by a score of 40-21 at half
time and put the game away for good with a
16-2 run at the start of the second period. Sit
ting on a comfortable cushion,VanDerveer
spread out the minutes generously as every
healthy Stanford player saw at least five min
utes of action.
Chelsea Trotter continued her efficient play,
leading the team in scoring with 17 points de
spite playing only 21 minutes.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu and Thiel also scored
in double figures as the Cardinal regained its
trademark offensive balance that was missing in
the loss to USC.
Kimyacioglu, who was displaced from the
starting lineup by Powell, played like she
had something to prove. She finished 4-of-5
from the 3-point line and was clearly in a
shooting zone.
"With Sebnem [Kimyacioglu] coming off the
bench, she was a little fired up," said Cal head
coach Caren Horstmeyer. "I think Tara [Van-
Derveer] knows the right buttons to push."
California (7-11,3-6) simply lacked sufficient
taient against the fired-up Stanford team. The
Bears' media guide boasts of "balance" as 11
Cal players see at least 10 minutes per outing
and nobody averages more than 30 minutes,
but it appeared last night that the Bears need
ed less balance and more star players.
Last night, Timea Ivanyi was the only Bear
to manage double figures with 10 points. Cal

shot 32 percent from the field,
compared to Stanford's 42 per
cent, and committed 25 turnovers.
Despite the large margin of vic
tory and poor offensive stats,
Horstmeyer didn't think her team
played badly.
"Stanford was pretty good
tonight," Horstmeyer said. "[But]
I don't think there was an ounce of
lost passion on the floor for my
team. And it very well could have
gone out the door. My team didn't
hang their heads and they played
with pride."
From what happened last
night, it is hard to believe that Cal
recently upset the UCLA Bruins, a
team which beat USC, which in
turn dealt the Cardinal its only
loss of the season. Transitivity
would imply that Cal should have
beaten Stanford, but anything can
happen on any given night in the
Pac-10. Still, if Stanford brings the
level of intensity it did tonight,
how well other teams play could
be irrelevant.
"We do go in with a target on
our backs, and teams really give us
special attention and play hard
against us," VanDerveer said. "We
are used to that. That's how it is,
and we didn't play very well
[against USC], We have not been
playing very well lately so we hope
this is a January wake-up call for us
that will help us down the road."
