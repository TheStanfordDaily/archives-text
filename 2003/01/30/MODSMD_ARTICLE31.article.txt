# Arizona players caught stealing money, candy
## 
### 
Top-ranked Arizona may
have more to worry about this
weekend than Stanford and
co-Pacific-10 Conference
leader California coming to
town. The team is under inves
tigation by the Arizona athletic
department — and possibly
soon by the NCAA—after
three Wildcat players were ac
cused of robbing a candy ma
chine at the team's hotel in
Lawrence, Kan., before Ari
zona's game against then-No. 6
Kansas last Saturday.
Lawrence police Lt. David
Cobb told the Arizona Daily Star
that a witness staying at the hotel
identified two of those three
players, who allegedly took
about 70 candy bars and emp
tied the vending machine's
money box.
Head coach Lute Olson
called the theft reports
"hearsay and rumors" during
most difficult of the season.
The Sun Devils have played an
extremely competitive schedule
this season, which explains their
six losses on the season. Arizona
State currently has a No. 35 RPI
ranking and tops the Pac-10 in
field-goal percentage (48.3 per
cent) and blocks per game (4.8).
Sun Devil freshman Ike Diogu
is fourth in the Pac-10 in scoring,
averaging 18.2 points per game.
The 6-foot-8 forward from Gar
land, Texas, has posted double
digits in every game this season —
making him one of only five Pac-10
players to do so — while also man

this week's Pac-10 press con
ference, but his coaching staff
paid the hotel $80 to settle the
matter, according to the local
police source.
Cobb told the Daily Star that
the repayment satisfied the
hotel, ending his department's
investigation of the matter.
But the $80 shelled out by the
coaching staff may get the
NCAA involved, as it could be
construed as an NCAA benefits
violation by the coaches on be
half of the players involved. Nei
ther the NCAA nor the Arizona
athletic department would com
ment to the Daily Star on that
possibility.
Olson has said that he will
fight the allegations.
Arizona overcame a 20-point
deficit to crush Kansas 91-74 in
the game.

Although Arizona State "might
be the second best team in the
league" according to Lottich, it
doesn't present the same threat or
represent the same ideal that Ari
zona seems to exude.
"There's no doubt that [the
matchup against Arizona] will be
an emotional game," Lottich said.
"We're going down to see the No.
1 team in the country."
While emotion was a key factor
in Stanford's victories over Florida,
Xavier and Oregon, the question
still remains, will it be enough this
time around?
