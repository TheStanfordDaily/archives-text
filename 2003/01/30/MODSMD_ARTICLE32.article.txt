Everyone who has played a
sport is familiar with the infa
mous parent-athlete chats. After
the courts are cleared, you've
thrown your uniform in the
laundry, scrutinized the stat
sheet and heard the coaches'
final reflections, you make that
phone call home fora chat with
arguably your biggest fan —
and your worst critic.
While coaches are looking at

team dynamic and fans rarely
see far beyond the box score,
parents have a knack for notic
ing the little things. The slip-up
on your crossover dribble, the
extra step on the lay-in or the 30
seconds of extra time you got at
the end of the first half.
For Stanford freshman Dan
Grunfeld, the parental ap
praisals on the other end of the
telephone aren't coming from
any old mom or dad. They are


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Dan Grunfeld is the son of Ernie Grunfeld, a former collegiate
and professional basketball star and the current general manager of the
Milwaukee Bucks. The younger Grunfeld has already made huge contri
butions to the Cardinal, hitting two key 3-pointers in its victory over (JSC.
coming from Ernie Grunfeld, gen
eral manager of the Milwaukee
Bucks.
"1 talk to him every day, but he's
my dad; he's not my coach," said
the freshman. "He knows the
game, and I trust what he says."
The GM didn't get his job be
fore first accumulating a rather
lengthy list of credentials in the
world of basketball.
Immigrating from Romania in
the early 19605, the elder Grunfeld
used basketball to make his way in
the United States. He earned a
basketball scholarship to Ten
nessee, where he teamed with
Bernard King in the famed "Ernie
and Bernie Show." The duo aver
aged around 50 combined points.
After college, the 6-foot-6 patri
arch moved into the professional
leagues, playing for Milwaukee
and Kansas City before finishing
off his career with the New York
Knicks. In 1986, Grunfeld retired
and moved into broadcasting.
Three years later he returned to
the Knicks as an assistant coach.
Moving up through the front
office, he became general manager
of the Knicks in 1995, and in 1999
switched to the GM position with
the Bucks.
For the younger Grunfeld, his

father's heralded career has trans
lated into more than a little famil
iarity with the world of basketball.
"It gave [me] the opportunity to
be around basketball a lot," Dan
Grunfeld said. "Whether it was
going to games, or going to prac
tices or simply talking to my dad or
other people, I got to see what bas
ketball is all about."
His familiarity with the game has
translated into strong fundamen
tals and confident shooting on the
Cardinal courts, an asset that head
coach Mike Montgomery is thank
ful for, particularly due to the ex
tensive losses Stanford has endured
to injury and the NBA Draft.
With the recent injury of junior
forward Justin Davis — which has
moved sophomore Nick Robinson
into a starting position and more of
a forward role — Grunfeld is often
the first or second guy off the
bench and the strongest reserve in
the backcourt.
"We all came in with the mindset
that we wanted to contribute,"
Grunfeld said. "With some of the in
juries and people going to the NBA,
it's given me the chance to play a lit
tle more and step up my game."
However, the freshman is quick
to assert that the adjustments
needed for the college game don't
come without their fair share of
struggles. A heralded shooter,
Grunfeld had more than a few air
balls in the early season as he
stepped up to the pace of the col

lege game.
"It is just a whole different situ
ation. Everyone who comes to a
program like Stanford was proba
bly the best on their team or in
their state," said Grunfeld. "The
coaches do a great job trying to ac
climate us to the offense and the
different rigors of college basket
ball, but often times it is just a ques
tion of being out there."
Grunfeld isn't doing all that bad
of a job. In addition to coming in
and playing consistent defense
and protecting the ball — giving
the Stanford starters invaluable
rest — the freshman has assumed
a fair amount of offensive respon
sibility, averaging just under five
points a game.
Grunfeld broke double figures
in an 18-minute performance
against UC-Irvine in December,
scoring 12 points on 4-for-4 shoot
ing with two 3-pointers. And just
last weekend, he hit two critical 3-
pointers in Stanford's tight win
over Southern California.
While consistent play domi
nates the younger Grunfeld's
thoughts for the time being, it is
hard not to question if he thinks of
following in his father's footsteps.
"I want to do the best I can," he
said. "Everyone sets lofty goals for
themselves, but right now I am just
trying to maximize my potential. I
just want to win. At the end of the
day its great if you win, and if you
lose, it's not."

laundry, scrutinized the stat

arguably your biggest fan —

While coaches are looking at

team dynamic and fans rarely

For Stanford freshman Dan
Grunfeld, the parental ap

any old mom or dad. They are

Freshman Dan Grunfeld is the son of Ernie Grunfeld, a former collegiate
and professional basketball star and the current general manager of the
Milwaukee Bucks. The younger Grunfeld has already made huge contri
butions to the Cardinal, hitting two key 3-pointers in its victory over (JSC.
coming from Ernie Grunfeld, gen
eral manager of the Milwaukee
Bucks.
"1 talk to him every day, but he's
my dad; he's not my coach," said
the freshman. "He knows the
game, and I trust what he says."
The GM didn't get his job be
fore first accumulating a rather
lengthy list of credentials in the
world of basketball.
Immigrating from Romania in
the early 19605, the elder Grunfeld
used basketball to make his way in
the United States. He earned a
basketball scholarship to Ten
nessee, where he teamed with
Bernard King in the famed "Ernie
and Bernie Show." The duo aver
aged around 50 combined points.
After college, the 6-foot-6 patri
arch moved into the professional
leagues, playing for Milwaukee
and Kansas City before finishing
off his career with the New York
Knicks. In 1986, Grunfeld retired
and moved into broadcasting.
Three years later he returned to
the Knicks as an assistant coach.
Moving up through the front
office, he became general manager
of the Knicks in 1995, and in 1999
switched to the GM position with
the Bucks.
For the younger Grunfeld, his

father's heralded career has trans
lated into more than a little famil
iarity with the world of basketball.
"It gave [me] the opportunity to
be around basketball a lot," Dan
Grunfeld said. "Whether it was
going to games, or going to prac
tices or simply talking to my dad or
other people, I got to see what bas
ketball is all about."
His familiarity with the game has
translated into strong fundamen
tals and confident shooting on the
Cardinal courts, an asset that head
coach Mike Montgomery is thank
ful for, particularly due to the ex
tensive losses Stanford has endured
to injury and the NBA Draft.
With the recent injury of junior
forward Justin Davis — which has
moved sophomore Nick Robinson
into a starting position and more of
a forward role — Grunfeld is often
the first or second guy off the
bench and the strongest reserve in
the backcourt.
"We all came in with the mindset
that we wanted to contribute,"
Grunfeld said. "With some of the in
juries and people going to the NBA,
it's given me the chance to play a lit
tle more and step up my game."
However, the freshman is quick
to assert that the adjustments
needed for the college game don't
come without their fair share of
struggles. A heralded shooter,
Grunfeld had more than a few air
balls in the early season as he
stepped up to the pace of the col

lege game.
"It is just a whole different situ
ation. Everyone who comes to a
program like Stanford was proba
bly the best on their team or in
their state," said Grunfeld. "The
coaches do a great job trying to ac
climate us to the offense and the
different rigors of college basket
ball, but often times it is just a ques
tion of being out there."
Grunfeld isn't doing all that bad
of a job. In addition to coming in
and playing consistent defense
and protecting the ball — giving
the Stanford starters invaluable
rest — the freshman has assumed
a fair amount of offensive respon
sibility, averaging just under five
points a game.
Grunfeld broke double figures
in an 18-minute performance
against UC-Irvine in December,
scoring 12 points on 4-for-4 shoot
ing with two 3-pointers. And just
last weekend, he hit two critical 3-
pointers in Stanford's tight win
over Southern California.
While consistent play domi
nates the younger Grunfeld's
thoughts for the time being, it is
hard not to question if he thinks of
following in his father's footsteps.
"I want to do the best I can," he
said. "Everyone sets lofty goals for
themselves, but right now I am just
trying to maximize my potential. I
just want to win. At the end of the
day its great if you win, and if you
lose, it's not."
