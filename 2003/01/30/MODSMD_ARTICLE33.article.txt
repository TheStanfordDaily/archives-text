# Why are collegiate athletes subjected to a Double standard?
## 
### 
After its victory over No. 6
Kansas last Saturday, top
ranked Arizona allegedly
stole money and up to 70
candy bars from a hotel vending
machine in Lawrence, Kan.
Never mind that the hotel was
reimbursed $80 by an Arizona as
sistant, or that the hotel has no in
tent to press charges. On the day
following President Bush's State of

the Union ad
dress, the above
tidbit proved
sweet enough for
inclusion in na
tional sports
news. An Associ
ated Press story
about the inci
dent ran on all

major sports Web sites, including
the front page of ESPN.com.
The real question here isn't
why the Wildcats didn't know
that, as NCAA athletes, they could
and would get in hot water for
their actions. The question isn't
even why Arizona coach Lute
Olson is denying the entire inci
dent, even after assistant coach
Jim Rosborough shelled out
money to the hotel.
The question is why the police
barged into the Wildcats' locker
room after the game to interview
the players about their suspected
criminal activities. The question is,
why is this national news?
"Candygate," as a Yahoo Sports
headline dubbed it, is a matter of
national importance because the
NCAA often mandates ridiculous
ly stringent behavioral require
ments for its amateur cash cows.
The NCAA hasn't yet said a
word, but the Wildcats are already
on red-alert damage control. This
is to be expected in today's athletic
climate. Keep in mind that it was
Stanford, not the NCAA, that vol
untarily suspended Chris Lewis
from the football team's first game
for making personal phone calls

on the Athletics Department's
dime. The mere threat of NCAA
sanctions in a college basketball cli
mate — one that's already short of
scholarships due to so many play
ers leaving early for the NBA (or
Europe or the NBA Developmen
tal League) — is enough to make
any coach jump at the thought of
the slightest misstep by his players.
But let's get real here fora sec
ond. If any other group of college
students break into a vending ma
chine, nothing happens beyond
the possibility of their being roped
into paying damages — and no
one cares. Such behavior is juve
nile and wrong, sure, but it's a
minor offense. The hotel isn't
going to press charges, and all the
damages have already been paid.
So why is this still an issue? Why
does this nation, at least ostensibly,
care so much about keeping its col
lege athletics lily-white, while at
the same time, it habitually deni
grates the virtuosity of its profes
sional athletes?
I feel weird just writing this —
which I think reflects just how in
grained our assumptions are about
how athletes are "supposed" to be
have — but I just don't care if the
Wildcats enjoyed a few candy bars
and some quarters on the Arizona
athletic department's tab. Food-re
lated thefts occur every day in com
mon refrigerators across the Stan
ford campus, and no one around
here ever cares that somebody
went ahead and baked your cook
ies for you and then decided to save
you the trouble of eating them, too.
As inconsiderate as such actions
are, they're just not that big a deal
in the grand scheme of things.
Candygate has no effect on the
integrity of college basketball. No
one's rolling over and dropping a
game because of this.
And it shouldn't have any effect
on the players. I don't dispute that
