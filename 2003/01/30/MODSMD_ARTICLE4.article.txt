# At the School of Education
## New gov't created 
### STEPHANIE CONDON 
The School of Education has a
new government and a new plan to
increase communication among
students and staff.
The Student Guild, the new gov
ernmental body, is a separate entity
from the Graduate Student Council
and was created fall quarter "to fa
cilitate a student community in the
school with support for academic
and research work," said second
year doctoral student Blake
Naughton, who is also the Guild's
chief of staff.
The Guild also serves roles as a
social oudet to help students get to
know one another and to advocate
student issues, and as a forum for the
school's faculty and administration.
Naughton, along with doctoral
students David Waddington and
Gayle Christensen, started planning
the Guild last summer after meeting
with School of Education Dean Deb
orah Stipek to gauge the interest in
initiating a student group.
"Basically, our steps toward for
mation were pretty informal, fo
cused on finding folks that were in
terested," Naughton said. "In Octo
ber, we held our kickoff town meet
ing, at which some 40 or so students
showed up — a pretty big number
fora school of3oo — and we set out

our agenda."
The Guild has two main branch
es, said Waddington, who is Guild
chairperson and also the School of
Education's elected representative
on the Graduate Student Council.
They are the advocacy arm and the
collegiality arm.
The role of the former is to solic
it information from students and to
report it during the Guild's meet
ings with the dean, which are held
twice each quarter.
The advocacy arm is run by
Christensen, the advocacy coordi
nator. Currendy, she is working to
accommodate the school's doctoral
students who want to pursue non
education master's degrees. It is also
responsible for course scheduling
and curricular issues as well as ca
reer services and fellowship, accord
ing to Christensen.
The collegiality arm, led by mas
ter's student Kim Stuart, is in charge
of planning social events.
Maggie Roach, a master's student
in the school, said her experiences
with the Guild have been positive.
"I gave some feedback for an
issue once, and I feel confident that
[the Guild] will take it to the dean,"
Roach said.
According to Roach, the Guild
