# Fac Sen one of few to speak out on Patriot Act
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Faculty Senate be
came one of the first and only uni
versity faculties in the nation to
speak out against the Patriot Act
when it unanimously passed a reso
lution two weeks ago expressing
concerns about the act's possible
harmful effects on education.
Though at least 20 municipali
ties around the country have passed
resolutions with various degrees of
force against the Patriot Act, few

universities have been vocal in ex
pressing cohesive opposition to
post- Sept. 11 security measures.
The Faculty Senate's resolution
expressed concern and urged the
University administration, other
universities and the federal govern
ment to work together to minimize
the negative consequences that the
Patriot Act could have on research
and education.
"Some of the actions taken, or
contemplated, by the federal gov
ernment ... may harm the funda
mental educational and research

missions of college and universi
ties," the resolution said. "These in
clude some ... restrictions on who
may use certain biological materials,
some limitations on visas for foreign
students . . . and the broadened
range of monitoring of public and
private communications."
Though the Patriot Act was
passed more than a year ago in the
immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, its
implementation is still being
worked out, and the Bush adminis
tration is still considering new re
strictions on certain sensitive re

search, according to Sheila Widnall,
who chaired an MIT committee ex
ploring the Patriot Act.
To publicize the Patriot Act's re
strictions, letters were sent out to
more than 100 different people in
volved in research and legislation
around the country.
According to Faculty Senate
Chair Hank Greely, letters went to
members of the Bush administra
tion, Congressional committee
chairs, every member of the Califor-
nia congressional delegation and se
lect peer universities.
Faculty members were unsure as
to whether the Stanford resolution
would have any impact on govern
ment policy.
"The expressive symbolism
hopefully moves hearts and minds
of people who might not otherwise
have thought about [the Patriot
Act]," said Assoc. Philosophy Prof.
Debra Satx
"Most likely it will have an un
clear impact," Greely said. "It can
serve as background information
for policymakers."
Responses at other universities
have varied greatly.

Ari MIT faculty committee wrote
an extensive report in August cri
tiquing MlT's relationship to re
search that is restricted. The report,
which called for keeping MlT's clas
sified research off campus, focused
on the educational necessity of
keeping all research conducted at
MIT open to all participants.
"The report called for us to basi
cally follow the law," Widnall said.
"It's a values-based report studying
the balance between public service
responsibilities and research."
Widnall noted that although
the MIT faculty had not passed a
resolution like the Stanford facul
ty, they were firmly behind the
report.
"I think [the Stanford] resolution
is exactly what I expect the MIT ad
ministration to do," she said, refer
ring to the necessity of working with

the government to keep research as
open as possible.
Harvard is also considering a res
olution concerning research impli
cations of the Patriot Act, though the
faculty have not yet decided
whether a resolution would be ap
propriate.
"There's some real gain in being
proactive," said Everett Mendel
sohn, a Harvard professor of the
history of science.
Elaine Scarry, a Harvard profes
sor of aesthetics and value theory,
noted that the implications of the
Patriot Act reach beyond research.
"Every faculty member should
spend 15 minutes in the interna
tional office watching what inter
national students go through,"
she said.
She also pointed out that li
braries are also a target of the Patri

ot Act. The act requires librarians to
turn over information on patrons'
borrowing records.
"Among citizens the burden falls
unevenly," she said.
Yale, Princeton and Duke are
among the many universities that
have remained publicly quiet about
the Patriot Act.
"The fact that faculty are not
more involved is lamentable," said
William Tierney, a professor at the
University of Southern California,
of his own institution's faculty. "A
resolution that every member of the
[Pacific 10 Conference] signed
about the Patriot Act would send a
powerful message."
Many university towns have
passed resolutions supporting civil
liberties and calling for various de
grees of resistance to the Patriot Act.
They include: Berkeley, Calif.;

Boulder, Colo.; Ann Arbor, Mich,
and Cambridge, Mass.
"A lot of [faculty members
around the country] don't know
what all the implications of the Pa
triot Act are," said Mendelsohn,
commenting on why universities
have been relatively slow to speak
out about the Patriot Act.
Others, however, note that uni
versity resolutions seldom have
much impact.
"[Resolutions] are fairly com
mon, always heartfelt, but most
often not seen as terribly germane
beyond the campus where they
originate," said Larry Arbeiter at
the University of Chicago.
"Whether the act is a threat or a has
sle may be difficult to determine
this early in the process."
Widnall pointed out one ex
ample of university voices mak

ing a difference in national re
search policy.
In 1985, the Reagan administra
tion issued National Security Deci
sion Directive 189 in response part
ly to an outcry from the presidents
of MIT, Caltech and Stanford
about Defense Department de
mands to review research before it
was published.
The directive stated, "It is the
policy of this Administration that, to
the maximum extent possible, the
products of fundamental research
remain unrestricted," a policy Na
tional Security Adviser Condoleezza
Rice has said is still in effect.
Still, few think that this resolution
will have any immediate impart.
"The chance of a discernible im
pact is low," said Greely, "but it is
better to light a single candle than
curse the dark."

Faculty members were unsure as
to whether the Stanford resolution
would have any impact on govern

"The expressive symbolism

have varied greatly.

Ari MIT faculty committee wrote
an extensive report in August cri
tiquing MlT's relationship to re
search that is restricted. The report,
which called for keeping MlT's clas
sified research off campus, focused
on the educational necessity of
keeping all research conducted at
MIT open to all participants.
"The report called for us to basi
cally follow the law," Widnall said.
"It's a values-based report studying
the balance between public service
responsibilities and research."
Widnall noted that although
the MIT faculty had not passed a
resolution like the Stanford facul
ty, they were firmly behind the
report.
"I think [the Stanford] resolution
is exactly what I expect the MIT ad
ministration to do," she said, refer
ring to the necessity of working with

the government to keep research as
open as possible.
Harvard is also considering a res
olution concerning research impli
cations of the Patriot Act, though the
faculty have not yet decided
whether a resolution would be ap
propriate.
"There's some real gain in being
proactive," said Everett Mendel
sohn, a Harvard professor of the
history of science.
Elaine Scarry, a Harvard profes
sor of aesthetics and value theory,
noted that the implications of the
Patriot Act reach beyond research.
"Every faculty member should
spend 15 minutes in the interna
tional office watching what inter
national students go through,"
she said.
She also pointed out that li
braries are also a target of the Patri

ot Act. The act requires librarians to
turn over information on patrons'
borrowing records.
"Among citizens the burden falls
unevenly," she said.
Yale, Princeton and Duke are
among the many universities that
have remained publicly quiet about
the Patriot Act.
"The fact that faculty are not
more involved is lamentable," said
William Tierney, a professor at the
University of Southern California,
of his own institution's faculty. "A
resolution that every member of the
[Pacific 10 Conference] signed
about the Patriot Act would send a
powerful message."
Many university towns have
passed resolutions supporting civil
liberties and calling for various de
grees of resistance to the Patriot Act.
They include: Berkeley, Calif.;

Boulder, Colo.; Ann Arbor, Mich,
and Cambridge, Mass.
"A lot of [faculty members
around the country] don't know
what all the implications of the Pa
triot Act are," said Mendelsohn,
commenting on why universities
have been relatively slow to speak
out about the Patriot Act.
Others, however, note that uni
versity resolutions seldom have
much impact.
"[Resolutions] are fairly com
mon, always heartfelt, but most
often not seen as terribly germane
beyond the campus where they
originate," said Larry Arbeiter at
the University of Chicago.
"Whether the act is a threat or a has
sle may be difficult to determine
this early in the process."
Widnall pointed out one ex
ample of university voices mak

ing a difference in national re
search policy.
In 1985, the Reagan administra
tion issued National Security Deci
sion Directive 189 in response part
ly to an outcry from the presidents
of MIT, Caltech and Stanford
about Defense Department de
mands to review research before it
was published.
The directive stated, "It is the
policy of this Administration that, to
the maximum extent possible, the
products of fundamental research
remain unrestricted," a policy Na
tional Security Adviser Condoleezza
Rice has said is still in effect.
Still, few think that this resolution
will have any immediate impart.
"The chance of a discernible im
pact is low," said Greely, "but it is
better to light a single candle than
curse the dark."
The Stanford Faculty Senate be
came one of the first and only uni
versity faculties in the nation to
speak out against the Patriot Act
when it unanimously passed a reso
lution two weeks ago expressing
concerns about the act's possible
harmful effects on education.
Though at least 20 municipali
ties around the country have passed
resolutions with various degrees of
force against the Patriot Act, few

universities have been vocal in ex
pressing cohesive opposition to
post- Sept. 11 security measures.
The Faculty Senate's resolution
expressed concern and urged the
University administration, other
universities and the federal govern
ment to work together to minimize
the negative consequences that the
Patriot Act could have on research
and education.
"Some of the actions taken, or
contemplated, by the federal gov
ernment ... may harm the funda
mental educational and research

missions of college and universi
ties," the resolution said. "These in
clude some ... restrictions on who
may use certain biological materials,
some limitations on visas for foreign
students . . . and the broadened
range of monitoring of public and
private communications."
Though the Patriot Act was
passed more than a year ago in the
immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, its
implementation is still being
worked out, and the Bush adminis
tration is still considering new re
strictions on certain sensitive re

search, according to Sheila Widnall,
who chaired an MIT committee ex
ploring the Patriot Act.
To publicize the Patriot Act's re
strictions, letters were sent out to
more than 100 different people in
volved in research and legislation
around the country.
According to Faculty Senate
Chair Hank Greely, letters went to
members of the Bush administra
tion, Congressional committee
chairs, every member of the Califor-
nia congressional delegation and se
lect peer universities.
Faculty members were unsure as
to whether the Stanford resolution
would have any impact on govern
