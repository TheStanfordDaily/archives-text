# Students jump kick with
## The 						wushu club 
### MICHELLE KELLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
In a dimly lit Dinkelspiel Auditorium, students in
black and red satin robes practice a dizzying array of air
kicks, strikes and flips. The Stanford Wushu Club is
preparing for its upcoming performance on Feb. 7.
The word wushu is composed of two Chinese char
acters — "wu," meaning "military" and "shu," meaning
"art." Stanford Wushu comprises of three different dis
ciplines: traditional wushu, which is a performance and
aesthetic art; Taijiquan, also known as "Tai Chi," which
is meditative and internally focused; and Sanshou, the
only full-contact discipline of wushu.
"While wushu can refer to any Chinese martial art,
includingTaiji, people tend to associate it with 'external'
physical styles often seen in kung fit movies," said Chuck
Lam, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering.
"Taiji, on the other hand, is an 'internal' style of fight
ing that overpowers one's opponent with refined, nat
ural movements," Lam said. "Taiji [puts more empha
sis on] sensitivity, timing and mind / body coherence
than raw speed and strength. Thus, in Taiji training, the
students practice the movements very slowly to develop
the right feel for them.
Teachers Phillip Wong and Zhang Hong Mei coach
the Stanford Wushu Club and classes at Pacific Wushu,
a nearby wushu studio. The exhibition on Feb. 7 will fea
ture students from both the Stanford club and Pacific
Wushu, a group that ranges broadly in age.
When Wong arrived at Stanford five years ago to
start the program, fewer than 20 students came to prac
tice. Today, there are over 100 members on the team, of
whom approximately 30 are women.
"In a field traditionally dominated by men, it has
been an honor to work with a phenomenal female
wushu athlete," said Wong of his co-teacher, Zhang
Laoshi. "She has been a great inspiration for our fe
male athletes."

Only about one-third of the students that arrive at
Stanford have done any wushu before joining the team,
but Wong emphasized that most students have been
willing to work hard to learn and improve their skills.
"The dedication of die students here at Stanford is
very impressive," Wong said. "Since they are smarter
than your average student, we have no problems with
attitude. The sign of a smart person is one who listens —
those who tell you they are smart are often not."
Senior Luther White, the club president, started
practicing wushu in the spring quarter of his freshman
year. After playing fall and winter quarters for the varsi
ty soccer team at Stanford, White decided to try anoth
er sport.
"1 like the way that your body moves in wushu,"
White said. "I remember I once saw a movie in which Jet
Li executes a series of amazing kicks, and I thought,
'Wow, 1 really want to do that.' Wushu is very elegant
and yet very powerful."
Traditional wushu is a non-contact sport, yet accord
ing to senior Filip Krsmanovic, it is still "a very physical
ly demanding sport." Krsmanovic started practicing

wushu in his sophomore year after trying a series of
martial arts disciplines.
"There are so many flips and jumps — I find it
much more physically demanding than either Judo or
Tae Kwan Do," Krsmanovic said. "Yet it is not used for
fighting, which is not really needed in this world any
way. For people like us who cannot draw or sculpt,
wushu is a great way to express ourselves."
Wong echoed Krsmanovic's opinion on the nonvi
olent emphasis of wushu.
"We are really trying to promote wushu here and
help people understand it better," he said. "When
most people think of martial arts, they think of violence
and fighting, but that's about the last aspect they
should think about. One of the important lessons of
wushu is to have confidence in yourself so that you
don't feel the need to fight."
The Stanford Wushu Club and Pacific Wushu's
joint exhibition, "A Night of Wushu," on Feb. 7 will be
a celebration of the Chinese New Year and Chinese
martial arts. The show will be held in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium from 8-10 p.m., and tickets can be purchased
by calling (510)361-1908.
