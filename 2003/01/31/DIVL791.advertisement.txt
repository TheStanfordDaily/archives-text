Activist Ann Simonton is a former top model who appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and Seventeen, and on the pages of
many other national magazines. She also appeared on dozens of national television commercials before turning her back on this
lucrative career to dedicate her life to exposing commercial media's bias. Her goal is to expose the media's blatant propaganda
and to teach people to become more critical consumers of the media.
Ms. Simonton is one of the nation's leading authorities on the effects of media images and has travelled nationwide to present
her compelling expose on the disturbing consequences of media images. She has been arrested and jailed 11 times for her coura
geous. non-violent and often humorous protests. She is the founder and Director of Media Watch.
