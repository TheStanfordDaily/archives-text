## N. Korea criticizes State of the Union 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€”
North Korea yesterday said Pres
ident Bush's State of the Union
address was an "undisguised dec
laration of aggression."
In its first reaction to the
speech, North Korea said it "will
never allow the U.S. to wantonly
encroach upon the sovereignty
and dignity of the (North) and
destroy its system."
"This policy speech is, in
essence, an undisguised declara
tion of aggression to topple the
DPRK system," an unidentified
spokesman of the North's For
eign Ministry said in a statement
carried by the North's official
news agency, KCMNA. DPRK is
the Democratic Peoples Republic
of Korea.
Bush said in his address that
North Korea was "an oppressive
regime" ruling "a people living in
fear and starvation."
Responding to the North's de
cision to withdraw from the Nu
clear Nonproliferation Treaty, an
international pact to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons, Bush
said Pyongyang was resorting to
blackmail.
"The North Korean regime is
using its nuclear program to in

cite fear and seek concessions.
America and the world will not be
blackmailed," Bush said.
Striking back, the North said
Bush was a "shameless charla
tan."
"Bush has so far earned an ill
fame as an emotional backbiter,
but his recent address clearly
proves that he is a shameless
charlatan reversing black and
white under the eyes of the
world and the incarnation of the
misanthropy as he rejects the
people out of his favor for no
reason," the North Korean
spokesman said.
South Korean media reported
yesterday that key members of
the U.N. International Atomic
Energy Agency tentatively
planned an emergency board
meeting Feb. 12 to consider re
ferring the nuclear dispute to the
Security Council.
The lAEA had at first suggest
ed a Feb. 3 meeting, but South
Korea wanted to delay it to give
the North more time to change
course.
If the lAEA does refer the mat
ter, the council could decide to
impose sanctions on North
Korea, a step Pyongyang has said

it would consider an act of war.
South Korean President-elect
Rob Moo-hyun said yesterday he
opposes any U.N. economic sanc
tions against the North and that
he backs outgoing president Kim
Dae-jung's policy of engaging the
North.
The North Korean official ac
cused Bush of "trying to mislead
the public opinion by spreading
the rumor that the North is
chiefly to blame for the nuclear
issue."
"This is the height of shame
lessness," he was quoted as say
ing. "We will do our utmost to de
fend our system in view of the

U.S. declaration of aggression."
In his speech, Bush said the
United States is working with
South Korea, Japan, China and
Russia "to find a peaceful solu
tion" to the nuclear standoff,
"and to show the North Korea
government that nuclear
weapons will bring only isolation,
economic stagnation and contin
ued hardship."
North Korea is demanding a
nonaggression treaty with the
United States before it gives up its
nuclear programs. Washington
has ruled out a formal treaty, but
said it can provide a written secu
rity guarantee.
