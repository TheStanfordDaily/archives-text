# Al-Qaida built 'dirty bomb,' British say

LONDON (AP) — British offi
cials believe that Osama bin
Laden's al-Qaida terrorist net
work successfully built a crude ra
diological device known as a
"dirty bomb" in Afghanistan, the
British Broadcasting Corp. re
ported yesterday.
British intelligence agents
found documents that showed al-
Qaida members had built a small
device near Herat in western
Afghanistan, the BBC said, citing
unidentified British government
officials.
Britain's Foreign Office said
yesterday the report substantiated
expert opinion that al-Qaida want
ed to develop a nuclear weapon.
"The evidence presented in the
BBC report speaks for itself," a
spokesman told The Associated
Press. "It provides proof to sub
stantiate expert opinion that al-
Qaida was interested in develop
ing nuclear weapons."
In Washington, a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, said bin Laden was no doubt in
terested in acquiring a "dirty
bomb" — a conventional bomb ca
pable of spreading radiation.
But the U.S. official said, "We
have no evidence to substantiate
that he's built such a device."
The British intelligence agents

did not find the device itself and it
has not since been recovered, BBC
reported.
But scientists at the British gov
ernment's weapons research facility
in Porton Down concluded that al-
Qaida had succeeded in construct
ing a small "dirty bomb" in Herat —
based on documents and material
uncovered by the British military
and intelligence, the BBC said.
The scientists did not believe al-
Qaida had been able to develop a
full-blown nuclear device, it said.
The report did not say when the
device was thought to have been
developed or how much radiation
it could spread.
British officials showed some of
the documents — including dia
grams — to the BBC, the report
said.
As part of the operation, British
agents infiltrated al-Qaida camps
in Afghanistan, posed as recruits
and reported back, BBC said.
The British officials told the
BBC that Afghanistan's Taliban
regime helped al-Qaida construct
the device by providing medical
isotopes.
There has been previous evi
dence of al-Qaida's interest in a
"dirty bomb," which would be far
less deadly and damaging than a
nuclear explosion.
