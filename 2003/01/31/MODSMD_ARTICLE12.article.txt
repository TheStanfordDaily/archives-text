## The 						Stafford Daily Stanford Daily editor in chief says, 'Peace out' 
### 
"Whosoever of you sees an evil action, let him
change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do
so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do
so, then with his heart — and this is the weakest de
gree offaith."
—Prophet Muhammad (S)
Today is my last day of having the
honor to lead some of Stanford's
most talented students as editor in
chief of The Stanford Daily. On Sunday, in
stead of meeting with my editorial board to
discuss the next issue that we think the Uni
versity should take a stand on, I'll probably
sleep in until 3 p.m., watch the Pro Bowl and
maybe even begin working on my senior
honors thesis.

During my tenure as editor in chief, I have
tried to construct The Daily into a forum of
ideas, where all members of the Stanford
community can express their opinions in a
respectable manner. While The Daily, like
any mainstream newspaper, always needs to
be fair and balanced in its coverage, I believe
a student-run newspaper can and should be
a vehicle to challenge people's thinking and
fight injustice on campus and off.
We are undoubtedly at one of the most
critical times in the history of the United
States, and Stanford students are fighting to
make this campus, this country and the
world a better place.
Over the past five months, The Daily has
covered many issues facing the Stanford
community: Stanford's relationship with
the costly potential war on Iraq, INS and

FBI policies that make the lives of many in

Patriot Act's infringement on our civil lib

restrict affirmative action in college admis
sions, on-campus labor disputes at the
Stanford hospitals and Bon Appetit, and
the relationship between Stanford's inno
vative Global Climate & Energy Project and
its corporate sponsors, among others. I
hope the pages of The Daily this past vol
ume have urged our readers to become
more informed on some of these topics and
act accordingly.

lives for The Daily, to our freshman writers,
I thank all of them for their amazing contri
butions and for putting up with me for five
months. And I have no doubt that The Daily
will continue to provide strong news, sports,
opinions, science and entertainment cover
age to the Stanford community in the years
to come.
May peace be with you all,
