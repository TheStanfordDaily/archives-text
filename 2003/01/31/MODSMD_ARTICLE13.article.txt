# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## How we communicate 
### 
Mr y best friends tend to be Scorpios.
1% /■ I realized the other day that even
; 1%/ I in high school, before I was inter
,JL ▼ JL. ested in astrology, my closest,
deepest friendships were with Scorpios. That's
because my mother is a Scorpio, so having
been raised by one, I think, gives me a natural
affinity for others who behave like she does.
Now, to all the astrological cynics out there, I
want to say, open your mind or stop reading.
actually, don't, because I really do want
you to continue. Just skip the parts that deal
with astrology, because that's not really the
point of the column; it was just my segue into
the main theme.
> Anyway, I've been dealing with Scorpios
my whole life. As a Capricorn, what I find is

that, although on many basic
levels we understand each
< other almost intuitively, we
; really do have great difficulty
and express
ing our thoughts and feelings
— a phenomenon that struck
!me again last night as I was
talking to my friend Nadiya
about success and how I look

at the world. I just felt like the words I was say
ing weren't telling her what I really meant to
convey.
Something that fascinates me about humans
js the gap between thoughts and expression. We
have aP the time we want to filter and edit and
tweak our thoughts so that they come out the
way that we want them to; in other words, lan
guage as it is expressed and interpreted is high
'ly manipulated and completely subjective. So,
What does it really mean?
; Now, sometimes you meet someone, and you
get to know them and start to feel like you don't
leven have to speak. You don't even have to say
a word or finish a sentence, because they al
ready understand what you're thinking, where
you're coming from and what you're trying to
say. That's a beautiful thing that can make life a
' lot easier, I know, because the very friend I was
talking to last night is like that to me. And even
she doesn't always get it right, even when I ex
• plain at length and try to unpack and unfold the
true meaning behind my thoughts.
!; The point is that language is a clumsy and
seemingly inefficient means of communication.
Yes, it's highly advanced in biological terms, but
the fact is that half the time when you hear
someone say something, what you think they
meant and what they actually did mean are not
the same thing. Why is that desirable? Why do
we settle for these quasi-accurate representa
tions? Is that because truth is relative? Or is that
» why it is?
i See, language is a funny thing. It's how we
'communicate, but it's not really all that effi
cient. Which is probably fine — there's proba
; bly a good reason why I can never know exact
-ly what you mean when you say something,
- even when I think I do. It's like, people who are
reading this probably think that once they are
• jdone they will have comprehended my point,
got the message or whatever, but they actually
'have no idea what I'm really saying, because
; they don't know where it's coming from. Basi

cally, to state the obvious, you don't have access
to my thoughts or how I have internalized my
experiences, and so you really do have a very
limited understanding of the context for my
point.
And nowhere is this phenomenon crueler
than in relationships, in love, or really any
where that you have a lot invested in how an
other person thinks or feels about you or acts
toward you. First of all, I think that the phrase
"I love you" is a lazy one, a cop-out. What does
that mean? It's obvious that it means different
things to different people. This is something
that varies among sexes, among cultures,
among individuals. What you might think lov
ing someone means could be completely dif
ferent from the perspective of the one who
claims to love you. And here's where I think
men and women really do differ. Now, I have
a lot of male friends, because, to an extent, I
find their company to be easier than that of
women. I love hanging out with guys because
I feel like things with them are just so much
simpler. So they tend to reach a point where
they just treat me like one of them, and they
tell me fascinating things.
For example, I've had a ton of men tell me
that they love their girlfriends / wives / partners
to death, which is why they never want their sig
nificant others to find out that they're cheating
on them. And I'm like, "Okay, these ideas are
mutually exclusive in my mind. If you love her,
how can you mess around with anybody else?
Surely, that means that to an extent you don't
really love her completely. I mean, what's really
going on?"
And, of course, their response: "If I didn't
love her, I wouldn't a) try to keep it a secret from
her, or b) let her know that I'm casually dating
other people because she is the one I really love,
because, you know, I want her to trust me."
Note to guys: As much as you may think you are
going out of your way to be decent, that is not re
ally acceptable to us. We might continue to affil
iate ourselves with you, and you probably have
1,001 wonderful redeeming qualities that make
the bigger picture beneficial in the net analysis.
However, no matter how savory your intentions
toward the one you purport to love, the threat
of your infidelity taints your exchanges with a
stain that is probably ever-visible in her mind.
Granted, the stain might wash out and even
fade into invisibility over time, but at least fora
while it will be there, lurking in the back of her
consciousness.
And that's why I think it's a lazy phrase.
Maybe I'm just cynical when it comes to these
things, but I feel like it's easy to say "I love you"
just because we know that as a society we place a
high value on hearing those words. I wish peo
ple would spend more time saying what they re
ally mean. Maybe then we would be able to get
along better and not have to engage in so many
senseless arguments, misunderstandings and
other crazy things like war that really could
probably be avoided in most cases if there were
constructive communication.
But then again, maybe not. I mean, I don't
really know.
