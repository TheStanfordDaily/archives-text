Columnist Albrecht overlooks
prejudice facing minorih'es
Craig Albrecht's column on his white
identity, or lack thereof, was beautifully
illustrative of the many privileges that
still accompany whiteness in America
today ("Don't call me white," Jan. 30).
While I'm glad that Albrecht can fluidly
move between social situations without
having to be conscious of his race, to
generalize this experience to the rest of
the population, or anyone else for that
matter, is very problematic.
If, in his perspective, American so
ciety is eager to integrate all its mi
norities into one happy family, I have
to doubt the breadth of his experi
ence. I wonder if he has ever, for ex
ample, been told that his hair looks
like pubic hair. Such insensitive reac
tions to racialized traits makes it diffi
cult or impossible for many people of
color to not be aware of their race.
And his experience with (the very
real) prejudice against athletes
doesn't seem to be analogous to the
threat of physical harm some minori
ties face in the form of overt bigotry.
The telling mention of John
McWhorter and the emphasis on his
blackness show that Albrecht is also
not above subscribing to supposedly
pointless racial categories to prove his
point. It's ludicrous to bemoan the
rise of identity politics and then turn
around and play the game yourself.
Lastly, in terms of where a hetero
sexual white man can get a meal on

this campus, I offer a few suggestions:
the fraternities or, better yet, the facul
ty club. I hear their buffet is great.

Four-class dorms help gay
students adjust
As a queer student, I could not
help reacting to yesterday's article on
all-frosh "cluster" housing with some
degree of concern ("Frosh-focused
dorms considered by Res Ed," Jan.
30). When I made the decision to
come to Stanford, the fact that I had
the choice of staying in a four-class
dorm was important to me, as I want
ed the interaction with upperclass
men and guidance that a four-class
dorm provides. Furthermore, as a
queer student, I sought a visible
presence, established by the upper
classmen who spent at least a year at
Stanford and who were familiar with
the campus atmosphere, that told all
newcomers to check their homopho
bia at the door and to help make the
dorm a safer space for all students. I
believe that in many respects a four
class dorm can provide queer, queer
allied and questioning frosh with a
support network of older students
and their friends. They can make
easier the adjustment to campus life
and the coming-out process many
queer students undergo during their
freshman year.

All-frosh dorms, to their credit,
have much to offer to freshmen; how
ever, they also tend to be more het
eronormative and initially less tolerant
of alternative sexualities than their
four-class counterparts.
I would hope that, as the adminis
tration studies the pros and cons of all
frosh cluster housing in east campus, it
takes into account the already difficult
coming-out experiences many queer
and questioning students go through
during their first year at Stanford.
Four-class dorms, in my opinion, are a
significant factor in helping these stu
dents mature and address important
issues such as sexuality, and should re
main a choice for incoming students to
consider when choosing their hous
ing.

Grad student 'wonders about editor 7
I am writing to ask why eccentric
letters from graduate students to the
editor are always given a title that
mentions that the author is a graduate
student. Take, for example, "Grad
student 'disgusted' by editorial" (Jan.
27). How often do we see "Undergrad
complains about the draw?" I have to
wonder about the editor of your let
ters page.
