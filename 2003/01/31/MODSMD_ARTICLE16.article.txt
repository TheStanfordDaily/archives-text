## Baseball gets ready for Bakersfield battle 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven months ago, it took Cardinal ace Jere
my Guthrie 144 pitches to defeat Cal State-
Fullerton and its top starter, Wes Litdeton, in a
13-inning, 3-2 instant classic at the 2002 Sunken
Diamond Regional. The electric evening added
another chapter to the passionate rivalry be
tween the two schools and raised the stakes of
any future meetings.

at No. 13 Fullerton, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.; Saturday,
6:00 p.m.; Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

This weekend, as No. 3 Stanford (2-0) travels
south of Los Angeles to take on the No. 13 Titans
(0-0) in their traditional early-season three-game
series, the rematch the entire college baseball
world would love to have seen won't happen.
Guthrie has since moved on to professional ball,
so the Cardinal must take on Litdeton, now a
yitan junior, without him.
That's sort of like watching your best friend
up your enemy, then coming to school the
Kfext day only to realize your buddy called in sick.
Generally speaking, these are not fun times.
But while Stanford won't have Guthrie on the
mound to bully the Fullerton bats, it does come
ihto Goodwin Field a confident bunch after a
(jpminating sweep of Santa Clara last weekend
that even saw a combined no-hit bid die with one
out to go last Sunday.
Behind four outstanding pitching perfor
mances, the Cardinal won its first two games of
the 2003 campaign without much trouble. How
ever, armed with Litdeton and all-world closer
Chad Cordero, Fullerton brings its best team in
years to the series and provides Stanford with a

daunting early-season test.
Tonight, Littleton will look to avenge his
team's Regional loss at Sunken Diamond by tak
ing on Stanford senior John Hudgins. Hudgins
pitched well last weekend, going six innings and
allowing two runs while fanning five, but he may
have to better those numbers if he hopes to hang
with his preseason Ail-American opponent.
Littleton bounced back last season from a
troublesome freshman year to post a 9-4 record
and a 2.40 ERA.

"He is such a phenomenal athlete, and the big
key for Wes last year was gaining command in
the strike zone," Fullerton pitching coach Dave
Serrano said. "Once he established that, he was
almost unhittable."
Littleton's improvement throughout 2002
has no better proof than his two outings against
the Cardinal. In early February, Littleton lasted
just 4 2/3 innings at Sunken Diamond, allowing

seven runs on 10 hits in a 7-4 Stan
ford win. Four months later, he
cuffed Stanford batters for 8 1/3,
and only Guthrie's tremendous ef
fort allowed the Cardinal to prevail.
The Fullerton ace will not give
Stanford junior center fielder Sam
Fuld an easy opportunity to turn
around his early struggles at the
plate. Fuld, a National Player of the
Year candidate, opened the season
with an 0-for-9 line and three
strikeouts against Santa Clara.
His success is imperative for
Stanford against the Titans, as
grabbing hold of the lead will be
doubly important with Cordero
closing for Fullerton. Last season,
Cordero racked up 12 saves and
fanned 81 batters in just 55 2/3 in
nings.
That success earned him a fea
ture photograph in the Fullerton
media guide that shows the

through opposing players — in
cluding one dressed in a Stanford
uniform — with the caption
"Mowing 'em down."
Last Sunday, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess pulled to
morrow's starter for the Cardinal,
senior Tim Cunningham, after the
lefty threw 5 2/3 innings of hidess
ball. While his pitch count reached

its upper limit due to a lack of con
trol— he walked six Broncos —
his overall effectiveness gives Stan
ford hope that he and Hudgins will
develop into a potent 1-2 punch at
the top of the rotation.
Tomorrow, Cunningham will
face Fullerton freshman Ryan
Schreppel, a 6-foot-2 lefty that
physically resembles his opponent
but relies on a changeup for his suc
cess instead of Cunningham's mix
ture of a 90-mile-per-hour fastball
and breaking pitches. For his ca
reer, Cunningham has posted a 2-0
record and a minuscule 0.60 ERA
against the Titans. Repeating that
sort of success will likely ratde
Schreppel in his first collegiate
start.
Sunday, Fullerton freshman
Dustin Miller will face an unnamed
Cardinal starter, though that hard
ly means the game lacks buildup.
Intriguingly, Miller — a redshirt
freshman — could square off
against his former teammate, Stan
ford true sophomore Mark Jec
men, a leading candidate for this
Sunday's starting role. Both players
attended Diamond Bar High
School together while pitching on
the same staff.
The first pitch of tonight's game
is set for 7:00 p.m., with tomorrow's
tilt scheduled for 6:00 p.m. The
Sunday series finale will begin at
1:00 p.m. All three contests will be
broadcast by KZSU 90.1-FM over
the air and on the Internet.
