## Baseball gets ready for Bakersfield battle 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seven months ago, it took Cardinal ace Jere
my Guthrie 144 pitches to defeat Cal State-
Fullerton and its top starter, Wes Litdeton, in a
13-inning, 3-2 instant classic at the 2002 Sunken
Diamond Regional. The electric evening added
another chapter to the passionate rivalry be
tween the two schools and raised the stakes of
any future meetings.

at No. 13 Fullerton, Tonight, 7:00 p.m.; Saturday,
6:00 p.m.; Sunday, 1:00 p.m.

This weekend, as No. 3 Stanford (2-0) travels
south of Los Angeles to take on the No. 13 Titans
(0-0) in their traditional early-season three-game
series, the rematch the entire college baseball
world would love to have seen won't happen.
Guthrie has since moved on to professional ball,
so the Cardinal must take on Litdeton, now a
yitan junior, without him.
That's sort of like watching your best friend
up your enemy, then coming to school the
Kfext day only to realize your buddy called in sick.
Generally speaking, these are not fun times.
But while Stanford won't have Guthrie on the
mound to bully the Fullerton bats, it does come
ihto Goodwin Field a confident bunch after a
(jpminating sweep of Santa Clara last weekend
that even saw a combined no-hit bid die with one
out to go last Sunday.
Behind four outstanding pitching perfor
mances, the Cardinal won its first two games of
the 2003 campaign without much trouble. How
ever, armed with Litdeton and all-world closer
Chad Cordero, Fullerton brings its best team in
years to the series and provides Stanford with a

daunting early-season test.
Tonight, Littleton will look to avenge his
team's Regional loss at Sunken Diamond by tak
ing on Stanford senior John Hudgins. Hudgins
pitched well last weekend, going six innings and
allowing two runs while fanning five, but he may
have to better those numbers if he hopes to hang
with his preseason Ail-American opponent.
Littleton bounced back last season from a
troublesome freshman year to post a 9-4 record
and a 2.40 ERA.

"He is such a phenomenal athlete, and the big
key for Wes last year was gaining command in
the strike zone," Fullerton pitching coach Dave
Serrano said. "Once he established that, he was
almost unhittable."
Littleton's improvement throughout 2002
has no better proof than his two outings against
the Cardinal. In early February, Littleton lasted
just 4 2/3 innings at Sunken Diamond, allowing

Freshman irifielder John Mayberrv — a first-round choice in this year's MLB Draft — will try to help the
