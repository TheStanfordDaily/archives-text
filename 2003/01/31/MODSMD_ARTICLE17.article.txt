# Caverly to the rescue: frosh sparks swimming
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
J Back at the beginning of the
season, Swimming World ranked
the Stanford freshman swimmers
as the best female recruiting class
in the nation. Stanford freshman
Kristen Caverly played a signifi
cant role in gaining her class that
distinction, and since then, has
proven her value to the Cardinal
iji ways she never expected.
"It's hard switching teams,"
Gaverly said. "But I've had a great
season so far. It's a great team this
year. We're all swimming for each
olher, and [coach Richard Quick]
is a great coach."
- Caverly has recorded more in
dividual top-three finishes than
c ny freshman on the team. She has
t iree third-place finishes, seven
second-place finishes, and eight
wins on the season, as well as hav
ihg contributed to five top-three
ijelay finishes. Caverly has also al
ready recorded lifetime best times

for herself.
Rattle off this list of accomplish
ments to her, though, and Caverly
will blush and then laugh.
"I can't really see myself as a
standout or anything, but I
hope to prove myself," Caverly
said. "I'm definitely swimming
better than I expected, but right
now I think I see more potential
in myself."
Caverly hopes to take some of
that untapped potential and apply
it to her best event, the 400-yard
individual medley.
At the Stanford Invite in No
vember, Caverly faced the defend
ing champion in the event,
Auburn's Maggie Bowen. Caverly
came in a close second to her then.
Bowen also happens to be the
American record holder and de
fending NCAA champion in the
200 IM, and when she and Caver
ly met for that event, they finished

in a dead heat.
"I'm sort of running after
[Bowen]," Caverly said. "She defi
nitely wasn't at her best [at the dual
meet], and hopefully I wasn't at my
best. It should be a good race at
NCAAs."
Caverly's optimism and strong
work ethic will be assets to her
team as the Cardinal continues its
series of Pacific-10 Conference
matchups.
This weekend, No. 13 UCLA
and No. 5 Southern California will
visit Avery Aquatic Center, hoping
to keep the No. 4 Cardinal from a
repeat of last year's sweep of the
Los Angeles schools.
Though the Stanford squad
toppled both the Bruins and the
Trojans with ease last year, USC is
one of the top teams in the country
this year.
"[USC] will be one of the biggest
challenges to us in the Pac-10,"
Quick said.
Stanford already triumphed
over the Trojans in the first meet of

the year, the Texas Invite. Both
teams, though, have come a long
way since then.
The Cardinal has been
strong since then, due to the
leadership of veterans like ju
nior Tara Kirk and sophomore
Lacey Boutwell, and Quick has
witnessed vast improvements in
the performances of his
younger swimmers, including
Caverly and freshmen Dana
Kirk and Ashley Daly.
Now that the Stanford swim
mers have an even record in Pac
-10 competition (1-1), it will be cru
cial that they use the improving
depth of their squad to put away
both their weekend foes.
The Stanford divers have also
already faced UCLA and USC,
posting solid scores but falling
short to USC's NCAA champion,
Blythe Hartley. In a meeting be
tween these three squads earlier
this month, the Trojans and Bru
ins both proved to have remark
ably deep diving squads.
