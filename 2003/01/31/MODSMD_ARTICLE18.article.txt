J vs. No. 21 Pacific (DH),
Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

n
The Cardinal, ranked 14th in
j the USA Today / NFCA presea
« son poll, will look to continue its
recent dominance over the 21st
ranked Tigers in a doubleheader
beginning at noon on Saturday
] at Smith Family Stadium. These-
J ries will be the season-opener for
■ both clubs.
While the Cardinal has put to
gether a record of eight wins and
< one loss against Pacific over the
< past three years, facing a ranked
1 team this early is never easy.
t "This is a tough test coming
; out of the chute," Rittman said.
; But games against tough com
petition such as these are essential
in preparing the team for the diffi
cult Pacific-10 Conference sched
ule and the NCAA tournament.
"We use our conference as
( kind of a building block to [the]
postseason and getting us pre
pared for our ultimate goal of

making a run at the national
championship," Rittman said.
Stanford will send senior
pitcher Tori Nyberg to the circle
in the first game and freshman
Laura Severson in the second.
Nyberg emerged as the leader of
the Cardinal pitching staff in
2002, with a 26-11 record, while
posting an ERA of 1.51.
"Tori stepped up and did an
outstanding job for us last year,"
Rittman said. "We are expecting

big things from her senior year."
The Cardinal offense will be led
by senior second baseman Kira
Ching. Ching led the team in RBI
in 2002 with 46 and was second on
the team in home runs.
"Kira's been an inspirational
type leader for us," Rittman said.
"We're looking for her to solidify
our infield and be a leader on the
field."
