J vs. No. 21 Pacific (DH),
Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

n
The Cardinal, ranked 14th in
j the USA Today / NFCA presea
« son poll, will look to continue its
recent dominance over the 21st
ranked Tigers in a doubleheader
beginning at noon on Saturday
] at Smith Family Stadium. These-
J ries will be the season-opener for
■ both clubs.
While the Cardinal has put to
gether a record of eight wins and
< one loss against Pacific over the
< past three years, facing a ranked
1 team this early is never easy.
t "This is a tough test coming
; out of the chute," Rittman said.
; But games against tough com
petition such as these are essential
in preparing the team for the diffi
cult Pacific-10 Conference sched
ule and the NCAA tournament.
"We use our conference as
( kind of a building block to [the]
postseason and getting us pre
pared for our ultimate goal of

making a run at the national
championship," Rittman said.
Stanford will send senior
pitcher Tori Nyberg to the circle
in the first game and freshman
Laura Severson in the second.
Nyberg emerged as the leader of
the Cardinal pitching staff in
2002, with a 26-11 record, while
posting an ERA of 1.51.
"Tori stepped up and did an
outstanding job for us last year,"
Rittman said. "We are expecting

big things from her senior year."
The Cardinal offense will be led
by senior second baseman Kira
Ching. Ching led the team in RBI
in 2002 with 46 and was second on
the team in home runs.
"Kira's been an inspirational
type leader for us," Rittman said.
"We're looking for her to solidify
our infield and be a leader on the
field."

Kira Ching whips the ball to first base in a game last /ear. Ching led the
team in 2002 with 46 runs batted in, and was second in home runs. The
senior will anchor Stanford's offense this season.
The Tigers enter the 2003 cam
paign having lost the greatest
pitcher in Pacific history. Cindy
Ball, a two-time All-American and
two-time Big West Conference
Pitcher of the Year, holds the Pa
cific career records for wins, strike
outs, innings pitched and
shutouts. Ball remains with the
team as an assistant coach.
Tigers' pitcher Jennifer Dacre
will look to take up the reins from
Ball. Dacre owns a 27-7 career
record, but was roughed up by the
Cardinal last year in an 8-2 Stan
ford win during regular season.
"She's not overpowering,"
Rittman said of Dacre, "but when
her stuff is moving she can be
very effective."
Pacific's lineup has not experi
enced a similar drop-off as the

pitching staff, however, and re
mains the team's strength. The
Tigers return four All-Big-West
players: Barbara Moody, Estee
Okumura, Brandy Thurman and
Michelle Anunciation.
The offense is led by senior out
fielders Moody and Okumura,
who put up a combined 75 RBI last
year. Moody led the NCAA in dou
bles in 2002 with 28, and Okumu
ra is just 18 RBI shy of becoming
the Pacific career leader.
"One of our keys is to keep peo
ple offbase in front of [Moody and
Okumura]," Rittman said.
Sophomore infielder Anuncia
tion is the most dangerous of
those leadoff hitters, and was a
close second to Moody in runs
scored last year.
Although Stanford has owned
recent matchups against Pacific, in
cluding a 7-0 win in last year's
NCAA Regional, that was not always
the case. Between 1996 and 1999,
Pacific dominated the series by a

count of seven wins to two losses.
Rittman's arrival as head coach
in 1997 was a large part of the Car
dinal's change in fortunes.
Rittman is modest about his
role, however. According to
Rittman, much of the success can
be attributed to "the University's
commitment to developing the
program, and the work of associate
head coach Lonni Alameda and as
sistant coach Sara Pickering."
In the three years prior to
Rittman's arrival, the Stanford
softball program accumulated a
44-96 record and managed only
eight wins in its first two seasons of
Pac-10 play.
Since Rittman's hiring in 1997,
the Cardinal has put together a
254-120-1 record, averaged over
10 wins a season in the ultra-com
petitive Pac-10, advanced to the
NCAA postseason for the first time
in 1998 and made its first College
World Series appearance in 2001.
"It was just a matter of getting

good kids in and creating a good
work ethic," Rittman said.
The future only looks bright
for the Cardinal. Having become
a consistent 40-plus win pro
gram, the next step is a national
championship.
"We've had winning records for
six straight years," Rittman said.
"People are starting to recognize
Stanford softball."
Another crucial event in the
progress of the softball program was
the construction of Smith Family
Stadium. The stadium's first phase
of construction was completed in
1997, with permanent seating arriv
ing in 2001 and lighting fixtures to
make night games possible first ap
pearing this year.
And to those who have not
taken advantage of the top-notch
facilities and softball program,
Rittman admonishes:
"If you haven't been out to
watch a game, you really don't
know what you're missing."
