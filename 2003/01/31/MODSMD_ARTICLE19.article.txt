November 10, 2001.
That's the last time Stanford
wrestler Matt Gentry lost to a Pacif
ic-10 Conference opponent in a
dual meet, when he fell 6-4 to Ore
gon's Tony Overstake.

vs. Cat Poly, Today, 5:00 p.m. at All
Cal Invite in San Francisco, Saturday

To put the time frame in per
spective, consider this: the Cardinal
football team improved to 6-2 that
same day under the direction of a
guy named Willingham, and two
days later, a couple of guys named
Jacobsen and Borchardt combined
for 29 points in an exhibition game
victory.
Other numbers and accolades
speak volumes about the sopho
more out of Grants Pass, Ore. Thir
ty-five wins as a redshirt freshman,
including a 17-match win streak,
being named Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year and landing a spot on Am
ateur Wrestling News' All-Rookie
Team. The list goes on.
"That kind of stuff you don't re
ally think about when you're
wrestling," Gentry said.
While he may not think about it
on the mat, the success Gentry en
joyed in his first year of competition
was a large reason Stanford put to
gether one of its best seasons in re
cent memory, as the Cardinal fin

ished 10-8 for its first winning sea
son since 1991.
Gentry was also one of four Car
dinal wresders to qualify for the
NCAA Championships in Albany,
N.Y., last season, where he finished
1-2.
"It was a whole step up in inten
sity," Gentry said. "I was blown away
and I felt like the pressure was on.
Getting that experience last year is
going to be really helpful preparing
for this year's tournament."
After wrestling all last season at
149 pounds, Gentry entered this
season at 157, adding that the new
weight class has not altered his
wrestling style or technique.
So far this season, that technique
has carried Gentry to a 23-4 overall
record, including a perfect 10-0
mark in dual meets. He has not lost
a dual meet since Jan. 11, 2002,
against Columbia, a span of 21
matches.
Gentry will put both streaks on
the line tonight as Stanford (3-9,1-4
Pac-10) squares off'against Cal Poly
in the Ford Center at 5:00 p.m. The
Cardinal will look to rebound from
a 32-12 loss to Cal State-Bakersfield
on Sunday, while the Mustangs (5-
6, 2-1) enter tonight's meet coming
off a 32-9 defeat at the hands of No.
9 Arizona State.
Gentry is on pace to surpass his
freshman win total, which is re
markable considering he missed the
entire preseason and the Cardinal's
first two dual meets of the season
due to mononucleosis. He made his

season debut on Nov. 20, posting a
pin against San Francisco State.
"Having to sit out really makes
you hungry," Gentry said, some
thing injured teammate and fellow
redshirt sophomore Brad Metzler
can vouch for.
Metzler returned to the mat to
post a pin in his first action in nearly
three weeks on Jan. 18 before sitting
out Sunday's loss.
Despite being three weight class
es apart, Gentry and Metzler work
out a lot together.
"He's just got a great mental atti
tude," Metzler said. "You can tell by
watching him wresde [that] he's
confident. In every match, he'll find
a way to win."
With three dual meets remain
ing before the Pac-10 Champi
onships on Mar. 2 and Mar. 3 in
Boise, Idaho, Gentry is in good po
sition to garner a top seed and se
cure another bid to the NCAA
Championships.
Gentry will not get a chance to
match up with Arizona State's
Rocky Smart, ranked 13th in the na
tion at 157, until thePac-lOs, but the
Stanford phenom will face a stiff"test
in UC-Davis' Jeremiah larvis on
Feb. 14.
Individual concerns aside, as one
of the team's captains, Gentry has
witnessed a Cardinal squad with
high expectations and lofty goals
struggle to find ways to win this sea
son.
"This team has gone through a
lot," Gentry said. "We've had guys
quit, some of our top guys get in
jured, and we're also really young
and inexperienced. We've also
wrestled some really tough teams,

such as Nebraska and Wyoming.
"At the same time, this is D-I col
lege wrestling and the expectations
should be that you can compete at
that level. That kind of stuff hap
pens and we've got to be able to
overcome it."
The fight to do so continues
tonight and tomorrow, when Stan
ford travels to San Francisco to com
pete in the All-Cal Invitational.

"This team has gone through a
lot," Gentry said. "We've had guys
quit, some of our top guys get in
jured, and we're also really young
and inexperienced. We've also
wrestled some really tough teams,

such as Nebraska and Wyoming.
"At the same time, this is D-I col
lege wrestling and the expectations
should be that you can compete at
that level. That kind of stuff hap
pens and we've got to be able to
overcome it."
The fight to do so continues
tonight and tomorrow, when Stan

Matt Gentry hits the mat for some stretching during practice. Gentry hasn't
lost since 2001, and he hopes that his consistency will help the Cardinal
wrestlers return to the win column tonight against Cal Poly.
November 10, 2001.
That's the last time Stanford
wrestler Matt Gentry lost to a Pacif
ic-10 Conference opponent in a
dual meet, when he fell 6-4 to Ore
gon's Tony Overstake.

Wrestung
m
vs. Cat Poly, Today, 5:00 p.m. at All
Cal Invite in San Francisco, Saturday

To put the time frame in per
spective, consider this: the Cardinal
football team improved to 6-2 that
same day under the direction of a
guy named Willingham, and two
days later, a couple of guys named
Jacobsen and Borchardt combined
for 29 points in an exhibition game
victory.
Other numbers and accolades
speak volumes about the sopho
more out of Grants Pass, Ore. Thir
ty-five wins as a redshirt freshman,
including a 17-match win streak,
being named Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year and landing a spot on Am
ateur Wrestling News' All-Rookie
Team. The list goes on.
"That kind of stuff you don't re
ally think about when you're
wrestling," Gentry said.
While he may not think about it
on the mat, the success Gentry en
joyed in his first year of competition
was a large reason Stanford put to
gether one of its best seasons in re
cent memory, as the Cardinal fin

ished 10-8 for its first winning sea
son since 1991.
Gentry was also one of four Car
dinal wresders to qualify for the
NCAA Championships in Albany,
N.Y., last season, where he finished
1-2.
"It was a whole step up in inten
sity," Gentry said. "I was blown away
and I felt like the pressure was on.
Getting that experience last year is
going to be really helpful preparing
for this year's tournament."
After wrestling all last season at
149 pounds, Gentry entered this
season at 157, adding that the new
weight class has not altered his
wrestling style or technique.
So far this season, that technique
has carried Gentry to a 23-4 overall
record, including a perfect 10-0
mark in dual meets. He has not lost
a dual meet since Jan. 11, 2002,
against Columbia, a span of 21
matches.
Gentry will put both streaks on
the line tonight as Stanford (3-9,1-4
Pac-10) squares off'against Cal Poly
in the Ford Center at 5:00 p.m. The
Cardinal will look to rebound from
a 32-12 loss to Cal State-Bakersfield
on Sunday, while the Mustangs (5-
6, 2-1) enter tonight's meet coming
off a 32-9 defeat at the hands of No.
9 Arizona State.
Gentry is on pace to surpass his
freshman win total, which is re
markable considering he missed the
entire preseason and the Cardinal's
first two dual meets of the season
due to mononucleosis. He made his

season debut on Nov. 20, posting a
pin against San Francisco State.
"Having to sit out really makes
you hungry," Gentry said, some
thing injured teammate and fellow
redshirt sophomore Brad Metzler
can vouch for.
Metzler returned to the mat to
post a pin in his first action in nearly
three weeks on Jan. 18 before sitting
out Sunday's loss.
Despite being three weight class
es apart, Gentry and Metzler work
out a lot together.
"He's just got a great mental atti
tude," Metzler said. "You can tell by
watching him wresde [that] he's
confident. In every match, he'll find
a way to win."
With three dual meets remain
ing before the Pac-10 Champi
onships on Mar. 2 and Mar. 3 in
Boise, Idaho, Gentry is in good po
sition to garner a top seed and se
cure another bid to the NCAA
Championships.
Gentry will not get a chance to
match up with Arizona State's
Rocky Smart, ranked 13th in the na
tion at 157, until thePac-lOs, but the
Stanford phenom will face a stiff"test
in UC-Davis' Jeremiah larvis on
Feb. 14.
Individual concerns aside, as one
of the team's captains, Gentry has
witnessed a Cardinal squad with
high expectations and lofty goals
struggle to find ways to win this sea
son.
"This team has gone through a
lot," Gentry said. "We've had guys
quit, some of our top guys get in
jured, and we're also really young
and inexperienced. We've also
wrestled some really tough teams,

such as Nebraska and Wyoming.
"At the same time, this is D-I col
lege wrestling and the expectations
should be that you can compete at
that level. That kind of stuff hap
pens and we've got to be able to
overcome it."

tonight and tomorrow, when Stan
