# Committee re-examines Title IX
## Group co-chaired by Athletic Director Ted Leland held final meeting yesterday 
### ALISON PIERCE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer started her
career, her high school didn't have a girl's
basketball team, her college season was
nine .games long, and jobs for women in
coaching were virtuallv nonexistent.
'My whole lite has been changed be
cause of Title IX,'' VanDerveer said. "It
gave me an opportunity to do what [ real
ly loved, an opportunity that men had
been able to do forever. ''
Most .\mertcans agree that Tide [X —
the 1972 law mandating gender equitv in

interschomstic athletics — was a monu
mental avil rights achievement. The legis
lation came at a ame when women's sports
were drastically undersup ported in com
parison to men's at schools across the
countrv. But today, amid allegations that
Tide IX is indirecriv killing off non-rev
enue-producing men's sports like
wrestling, many argue that the law de
serves a second look.
During his 2000 election campaign,
U.S. President George W Bush indicated
that he would support amendments to
Tide [X. Stanford University finds itself at
the center of the escalating debate on Tide
IX. with .Aihlenc Director Ted Leland co
chairing a group of coaches, athletic direc
tors and sports advocates created to exam
ine the law The group, called the Com
mission on Opportunity in .\ihiencs. was
formed by U.S. Secretarv of Educanon
Rod Paige and will release its final report

in early February.
Yesterday marked the commission's
last scheduled meeting. According to a re
port in The New York Times, members
agreed to recommend some moderate re
forms but rejected drastic changes to the
law or its interpretation. Paige will decide
what modifications to make alter consider

put women's sports at a disadvantage, and
'treat female ithletes like second-class citi
zens.'' according to the Women's Sports
Foundation, based in New York.
Leland and manv on the commission
disagreed.
"We've had vears of experience trvmg
to enforce Tide IX," Leland said. "It's ap
propriate that we sit down to strengthen it
and make it fair. I don't see it as an
attack on Tide IX."

Clarifying compliance:
the 'three-prong test'
• According to Tide IX, a school
must provide equal resources to
male and female teams, including
access to coaching, travel schedules
and facilities. In addition, there
must be equal opportunity, as mea
sured by team positions, teams of
fered and scholarships.
J In order to demonstrate compli
ance with Tide IX, schools must
meet at least one "prong" of what
Leland describes as the "three
prong test." One, female athletic
opportunities should be propor
tional to the number of female stu
dents on campus. Two, a school has
to show a history of improving
women's athletics. Three, a school
must meet the needs and interests
of its female students,
j "The problems have to do with
making the test better," said Le
fand. "We have to make it useable,
because right now there is a lot of
flexibility and it is hard to measure."
For instance, he said, no one
knows whether increasing opportu
nity for female athletes means in
creasing the women's program by 10
percent per year or simply adding
one or two scholarships per year. It is
also difficult to tell which schools are
in compliance because the law is
hard to understand, he added.
"I think there's a real feeling that
if we clarify proportionality and die
three-prong test, then we ought to
be more hard-nosed on enforce
ment," said Leland.
Wrestling controversy
sparks debate
The current contention over
Tide IX developed after the Na
tional Wrestling Coaches Associa
tion sued the U.S. Department of
Education. The NWCA claimed
that Tide IX helps women's sports
at the expense of programs for
men.
Steve Buddie, Stanford's head
wresding coach, said that he sup
ported the lawsuit. Although he
wished it wasn't the only way to re
solve the issue, he was glad the law
suit brought attention to the prob
lem.
" I think Tide IX is a great thing,"

Buddie said. "I think the problem is
enforcing it properly. Proportional
ity isn't the best way to attain gender
equity. I don't know what is, and
that's why these meetings are
good."
Buddie said that the wrestling
team, while well-supported by fans
and alumni, is poorly funded. The
team has to do its own fundraising if
it wants to recruit, travel or hire an
assistant coach. The program re
ceives only one-and-a-half scholar
ships, although it could have up to
10 according to the NCAA.
"So most big schools have about
10 scholarships," Buddie said. "I'm
hoping for more flexibility within
athletic departments to measure in
terest and treat men's and women's
sports fairly."
It is a fact that wrestling numbers
have been drastically reduced.
Today there is only one NCAA spot
for every 41 high school wresders.
In 1982, there were 363 NCAA
wrestling teams with 7,914
wresders competing; in 2001, there
were only 229 teams with fewer
than 6,000 wresders. Yet, in that
same period, the number of NCAA
institutions has increased from 787
to 1,049, according to figures cited
by novelist John Irving in a column
for The New York Times. Irving
competed in and coached wrestling
for over 30 years and was inducted
into the National Wrestling Hall of
Fame in 1992.
'Sharing the sandbox'
According to the Women's
Sports Foundation, female athletes
are still struggling for their fair shot
in collegiate sports. While more fe
male athletes are getting a college
education because of $372 million
awarded in scholarships each year,
male athletes still receive 36 percent
($133 million) more, according to
the 1999-2000 NCAA Gender-Eq
uity Report.
"It's all about 'sharing the sand
box,' " said Donna Lopiano, execu
tive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation. "If resources are limit
ed and budgets stretched, that is no
justification to discard civil rights
laws. They are nothing more than
thinly veiled attempts to legislate
continued advantage to men's
sports."
Sabrina Kolker, a senior varsity
crew team member at Stanford,
said she has no doubt that Tide IX
has been a huge help for building
women's crew not only at Stanford
but also nationally.

"But now, low-profile men's
sports are being short-changed and
that is not fair for them," Kolker
said. "Killing off smaller sports like
wrestling is completely missing the
point of Tide IX. These sports en
compass what collegiate sports are
all about: hard work, dedication
and tremendous training as a stu
dent athlete. And it would be a
shame to lose them."
Kolker suggested removing
football from the proportionality
equation so the numbers aren't
so skewed to the men's side. Ac
cording to Leland, however,
such a solution is considered im
possible among members of the
Commission for Opportunity in
Athletics.
Leland maintains that the na
tionwide drop in men's wrestling is
not a direct result of Tide IX. Indi
vidual institutions make their own
funding decisions. There are other
factors as well, like the rise in foot
ball and basketball coach salaries.
Plans more likely to emerge
from the commission's final report
include slightly loosening the pro
portionality requirement or tying it
to interest surveys as opposed to en
rollment. But some Title IX advo
cates worry that this would mean
setding for less than equality.
VanDerveer said she believes the
current interpretation of Tide IX is
necessary to ensure continued fair
ness in athletics, and she fears that
the commission might "water it
down."
A report from the Chronicle of
Higher Education suggested that
interest surveys could be used to
justify a reversion to disproportion
ate support of men's teams, since in
tramural sports — in which partici
pation is wholly interest-driven —
typically draw three to 112 our times as
many males as females.

Title IX at Stanford
Stanford has an outstanding
reputation for women's opportuni
ty in athletics. In 1990, Stanford
gave 24 percent of its sports schol
arships to women. Women also
made up 27 percent of student ath
letes. Today 46 percent of both
scholarships and athletic positions
go to women.
"The bottom line is that schools
have other options," Leland said.
"There's nothing in Tide IX that says
you must drop men's wrestling."
To level the playing field and ac
commodate football, which takes
up 85 scholarships each year, Stan
ford has a disparity in scholarship
funding from sport to sport, Leland
explained.
"To say that Tide IX is taking
money away from men's sports is
just not right," Leland said. "It's
called the blame game — they
blame the women because it's easy."
Yet Craig Amerkhanian, head
coach for men's crew, noted that his
team doesn't have a single scholar
ship position while the women's
team has 12.
"The compliance issues are real
ly complicated," he said, "I think
Tide IX is the best thing that's hap
pened to college sports, but as a col
legiate athlete myself, a coach and a
fan, college athletics as a whole
could use a revision."
Leland has made it clear that the
commission has the first word, not
the last. Paige, the secretary of edu
cation, will make the next decision,
but Congress may have to make the
final move, he said.
"The hearts and minds of the
American public are totally behind
equal opportunity for women," Le
land said. "That's news — that
wasn't around when I was growing
up. This is one of the most popular
laws around."

Leland and manv on the commission
disagreed.

Clarifying compliance:
the 'three-prong test'
• According to Tide IX, a school
must provide equal resources to
male and female teams, including
access to coaching, travel schedules
and facilities. In addition, there
must be equal opportunity, as mea
sured by team positions, teams of
fered and scholarships.
J In order to demonstrate compli
ance with Tide IX, schools must
meet at least one "prong" of what
Leland describes as the "three
prong test." One, female athletic
opportunities should be propor
tional to the number of female stu
dents on campus. Two, a school has
to show a history of improving
women's athletics. Three, a school
must meet the needs and interests
of its female students,
j "The problems have to do with
making the test better," said Le
fand. "We have to make it useable,
because right now there is a lot of
flexibility and it is hard to measure."
For instance, he said, no one
knows whether increasing opportu
nity for female athletes means in
creasing the women's program by 10
percent per year or simply adding
one or two scholarships per year. It is
also difficult to tell which schools are
in compliance because the law is
hard to understand, he added.
"I think there's a real feeling that
if we clarify proportionality and die
three-prong test, then we ought to
be more hard-nosed on enforce
ment," said Leland.
Wrestling controversy
sparks debate
The current contention over
Tide IX developed after the Na
tional Wrestling Coaches Associa
tion sued the U.S. Department of
Education. The NWCA claimed
that Tide IX helps women's sports
at the expense of programs for
men.
Steve Buddie, Stanford's head
wresding coach, said that he sup
ported the lawsuit. Although he
wished it wasn't the only way to re
solve the issue, he was glad the law
suit brought attention to the prob
lem.
" I think Tide IX is a great thing,"

Buddie said. "I think the problem is
enforcing it properly. Proportional
ity isn't the best way to attain gender
equity. I don't know what is, and
that's why these meetings are
good."
Buddie said that the wrestling
team, while well-supported by fans
and alumni, is poorly funded. The
team has to do its own fundraising if
it wants to recruit, travel or hire an
assistant coach. The program re
ceives only one-and-a-half scholar
ships, although it could have up to
10 according to the NCAA.
"So most big schools have about
10 scholarships," Buddie said. "I'm
hoping for more flexibility within
athletic departments to measure in
terest and treat men's and women's
sports fairly."
It is a fact that wrestling numbers
have been drastically reduced.
Today there is only one NCAA spot
for every 41 high school wresders.
In 1982, there were 363 NCAA
wrestling teams with 7,914
wresders competing; in 2001, there
were only 229 teams with fewer
than 6,000 wresders. Yet, in that
same period, the number of NCAA
institutions has increased from 787
to 1,049, according to figures cited
by novelist John Irving in a column
for The New York Times. Irving
competed in and coached wrestling
for over 30 years and was inducted
into the National Wrestling Hall of
Fame in 1992.
'Sharing the sandbox'
According to the Women's
Sports Foundation, female athletes
are still struggling for their fair shot
in collegiate sports. While more fe
male athletes are getting a college
education because of $372 million
awarded in scholarships each year,
male athletes still receive 36 percent
($133 million) more, according to
the 1999-2000 NCAA Gender-Eq
uity Report.
"It's all about 'sharing the sand
box,' " said Donna Lopiano, execu
tive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation. "If resources are limit
ed and budgets stretched, that is no
justification to discard civil rights
laws. They are nothing more than
thinly veiled attempts to legislate
continued advantage to men's
sports."
Sabrina Kolker, a senior varsity
crew team member at Stanford,
said she has no doubt that Tide IX
has been a huge help for building
women's crew not only at Stanford
but also nationally.

"But now, low-profile men's
sports are being short-changed and
that is not fair for them," Kolker
said. "Killing off smaller sports like
wrestling is completely missing the
point of Tide IX. These sports en
compass what collegiate sports are
all about: hard work, dedication
and tremendous training as a stu
dent athlete. And it would be a
shame to lose them."
Kolker suggested removing
football from the proportionality
equation so the numbers aren't
so skewed to the men's side. Ac
cording to Leland, however,
such a solution is considered im
possible among members of the
Commission for Opportunity in
Athletics.
Leland maintains that the na
tionwide drop in men's wrestling is
not a direct result of Tide IX. Indi
vidual institutions make their own
funding decisions. There are other
factors as well, like the rise in foot
ball and basketball coach salaries.
Plans more likely to emerge
from the commission's final report
include slightly loosening the pro
portionality requirement or tying it
to interest surveys as opposed to en
rollment. But some Title IX advo
cates worry that this would mean
setding for less than equality.
VanDerveer said she believes the
current interpretation of Tide IX is
necessary to ensure continued fair
ness in athletics, and she fears that
the commission might "water it
down."
A report from the Chronicle of
Higher Education suggested that
interest surveys could be used to
justify a reversion to disproportion
ate support of men's teams, since in
tramural sports — in which partici
pation is wholly interest-driven —
typically draw three to 112 our times as
many males as females.

Title IX at Stanford
Stanford has an outstanding
reputation for women's opportuni
ty in athletics. In 1990, Stanford
gave 24 percent of its sports schol
arships to women. Women also
made up 27 percent of student ath
letes. Today 46 percent of both
scholarships and athletic positions
go to women.
"The bottom line is that schools
have other options," Leland said.
"There's nothing in Tide IX that says
you must drop men's wrestling."
To level the playing field and ac
commodate football, which takes
up 85 scholarships each year, Stan
ford has a disparity in scholarship
funding from sport to sport, Leland
explained.
"To say that Tide IX is taking
money away from men's sports is
just not right," Leland said. "It's
called the blame game — they
blame the women because it's easy."
Yet Craig Amerkhanian, head
coach for men's crew, noted that his
team doesn't have a single scholar
ship position while the women's
team has 12.
"The compliance issues are real
ly complicated," he said, "I think
Tide IX is the best thing that's hap
pened to college sports, but as a col
legiate athlete myself, a coach and a
fan, college athletics as a whole
could use a revision."
Leland has made it clear that the
commission has the first word, not
the last. Paige, the secretary of edu
cation, will make the next decision,
but Congress may have to make the
final move, he said.
"The hearts and minds of the
American public are totally behind
equal opportunity for women," Le
land said. "That's news — that
wasn't around when I was growing
up. This is one of the most popular
laws around."
When Stanford women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer started her
career, her high school didn't have a girl's
basketball team, her college season was
nine .games long, and jobs for women in
coaching were virtuallv nonexistent.
'My whole lite has been changed be
cause of Title IX,'' VanDerveer said. "It

Foundation, based in New York.
Leland and manv on the commission
disagreed.
"We've had vears of experience trvmg
to enforce Tide IX," Leland said. "It's ap
propriate that we sit down to strengthen it
and make it fair. I don't see it as an
attack on Tide IX."
I
Clarifying compliance:
the 'three-prong test'
• According to Tide IX, a school
must provide equal resources to
male and female teams, including
access to coaching, travel schedules
and facilities. In addition, there
must be equal opportunity, as mea
sured by team positions, teams of
fered and scholarships.
J In order to demonstrate compli
ance with Tide IX, schools must
meet at least one "prong" of what
Leland describes as the "three
prong test." One, female athletic
opportunities should be propor
tional to the number of female stu
dents on campus. Two, a school has
to show a history of improving
women's athletics. Three, a school
must meet the needs and interests
of its female students,
j "The problems have to do with
making the test better," said Le
fand. "We have to make it useable,
because right now there is a lot of
flexibility and it is hard to measure."
For instance, he said, no one
knows whether increasing opportu
nity for female athletes means in
creasing the women's program by 10
percent per year or simply adding
one or two scholarships per year. It is
also difficult to tell which schools are
in compliance because the law is
hard to understand, he added.
"I think there's a real feeling that
if we clarify proportionality and die
three-prong test, then we ought to
be more hard-nosed on enforce
ment," said Leland.
Wrestling controversy
sparks debate
The current contention over
Tide IX developed after the Na
tional Wrestling Coaches Associa
tion sued the U.S. Department of
Education. The NWCA claimed
that Tide IX helps women's sports
at the expense of programs for
men.
Steve Buddie, Stanford's head
wresding coach, said that he sup
ported the lawsuit. Although he
wished it wasn't the only way to re
solve the issue, he was glad the law
suit brought attention to the prob
lem.
" I think Tide IX is a great thing,"

Buddie said. "I think the problem is
enforcing it properly. Proportional
ity isn't the best way to attain gender
equity. I don't know what is, and
that's why these meetings are
good."
Buddie said that the wrestling
team, while well-supported by fans
and alumni, is poorly funded. The
team has to do its own fundraising if
it wants to recruit, travel or hire an
assistant coach. The program re
ceives only one-and-a-half scholar
ships, although it could have up to
10 according to the NCAA.
"So most big schools have about
10 scholarships," Buddie said. "I'm
hoping for more flexibility within
athletic departments to measure in
terest and treat men's and women's
sports fairly."
It is a fact that wrestling numbers
have been drastically reduced.
Today there is only one NCAA spot
for every 41 high school wresders.
In 1982, there were 363 NCAA
wrestling teams with 7,914
wresders competing; in 2001, there
were only 229 teams with fewer
than 6,000 wresders. Yet, in that
same period, the number of NCAA
institutions has increased from 787
to 1,049, according to figures cited
by novelist John Irving in a column
for The New York Times. Irving
competed in and coached wrestling
for over 30 years and was inducted
into the National Wrestling Hall of
Fame in 1992.
'Sharing the sandbox'
According to the Women's
Sports Foundation, female athletes
are still struggling for their fair shot
in collegiate sports. While more fe
male athletes are getting a college
education because of $372 million
awarded in scholarships each year,
male athletes still receive 36 percent
($133 million) more, according to
the 1999-2000 NCAA Gender-Eq
uity Report.
"It's all about 'sharing the sand
box,' " said Donna Lopiano, execu
tive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation. "If resources are limit
ed and budgets stretched, that is no
justification to discard civil rights
laws. They are nothing more than
thinly veiled attempts to legislate
continued advantage to men's
sports."
Sabrina Kolker, a senior varsity
crew team member at Stanford,
said she has no doubt that Tide IX
has been a huge help for building
women's crew not only at Stanford
but also nationally.

"But now, low-profile men's
sports are being short-changed and
that is not fair for them," Kolker
said. "Killing off smaller sports like
wrestling is completely missing the
point of Tide IX. These sports en
compass what collegiate sports are
all about: hard work, dedication
and tremendous training as a stu
dent athlete. And it would be a
shame to lose them."
Kolker suggested removing
football from the proportionality
equation so the numbers aren't
so skewed to the men's side. Ac
cording to Leland, however,
such a solution is considered im
possible among members of the
Commission for Opportunity in
Athletics.
Leland maintains that the na
tionwide drop in men's wrestling is
not a direct result of Tide IX. Indi
vidual institutions make their own
funding decisions. There are other
factors as well, like the rise in foot
ball and basketball coach salaries.
Plans more likely to emerge
from the commission's final report
include slightly loosening the pro
portionality requirement or tying it
to interest surveys as opposed to en
rollment. But some Title IX advo
cates worry that this would mean
setding for less than equality.
VanDerveer said she believes the
current interpretation of Tide IX is
necessary to ensure continued fair
ness in athletics, and she fears that
the commission might "water it
down."
A report from the Chronicle of
Higher Education suggested that
interest surveys could be used to
justify a reversion to disproportion
ate support of men's teams, since in
tramural sports — in which partici
pation is wholly interest-driven —
typically draw three to 112 our times as
many males as females.

Title IX at Stanford
Stanford has an outstanding
reputation for women's opportuni
ty in athletics. In 1990, Stanford
gave 24 percent of its sports schol
arships to women. Women also
made up 27 percent of student ath
letes. Today 46 percent of both
scholarships and athletic positions
go to women.
"The bottom line is that schools
have other options," Leland said.
"There's nothing in Tide IX that says
you must drop men's wrestling."
To level the playing field and ac
commodate football, which takes
up 85 scholarships each year, Stan
ford has a disparity in scholarship
funding from sport to sport, Leland
explained.
"To say that Tide IX is taking
money away from men's sports is
just not right," Leland said. "It's
called the blame game — they
blame the women because it's easy."
Yet Craig Amerkhanian, head
coach for men's crew, noted that his
team doesn't have a single scholar
ship position while the women's
team has 12.
"The compliance issues are real
ly complicated," he said, "I think
Tide IX is the best thing that's hap
pened to college sports, but as a col
legiate athlete myself, a coach and a
fan, college athletics as a whole
could use a revision."
Leland has made it clear that the
commission has the first word, not
the last. Paige, the secretary of edu
cation, will make the next decision,
but Congress may have to make the
final move, he said.
"The hearts and minds of the
American public are totally behind
equal opportunity for women," Le
land said. "That's news — that
wasn't around when I was growing
up. This is one of the most popular
laws around."
