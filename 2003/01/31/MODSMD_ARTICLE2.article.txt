When Stanford women's basketball
head coach Tara VanDerveer started her
career, her high school didn't have a girl's
basketball team, her college season was
nine .games long, and jobs for women in
coaching were virtuallv nonexistent.
'My whole lite has been changed be
cause of Title IX,'' VanDerveer said. "It
gave me an opportunity to do what [ real

Women's rights advocates worrv that
the current scrutiny will weaken Tide IX.
put women's sports at a disadvantage, and
'treat female ithletes like second-class citi
zens.'' according to the Women's Sports
Foundation, based in New York.
Leland and manv on the commission
disagreed.
