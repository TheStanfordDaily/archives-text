# Tennis begins its team title defense
## Fresno State match precedes next week's all-important Team Indoors 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend at the Taube Family
Tennis Center, the Stanford women's ten
nis squad looks to avoid something that
has never happened in program history
— a loss to Fresno State.

Women's Tennis
vs. No. 26 Fresno St., Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

After competing in numerous individ
ual tournaments, such as the National
Collegiate Women's Tennis Classic two
weeks ago, the Cardinal will play its first
dual match of the spring season against
the Bulldogs, a team that Stanford has
defeated in all 13 prior meetings. The
top-ranked Cardinal will do battle with
No. 26 Fresno tomorrow at noon.
The match takes extra importance be
cause, not only is it against a highly ranked
opponent, but it is the only chance for the
Cardinal to play as a team before the Team
Indoor Championships in Madison, Wis.,
next week. And fora young team, this ex
perience will be very helpful in improving
team solidarity.
"Dual matches are way different
[than individual tournaments]," said
Stanford coach Lele Forood. "In the in

dividual tournaments, everyone is out
fora little personal glory and just to see
where they're at with their tennis. But
you go into that team match, and it's a
totally different philosophy."
Additionally, the four freshmen on the
Stanford roster will participate in their
first team competition of the spring sea
son. Although the team traveled to
Hawaii fora dual match in November, the
Wahine couldn't offer much competition
as Stanford romped to an easy 7-0 victory
— not to mention that the contest oc
curred over two months ago.
"[The match against Fresno] is basical
ly for the freshmen, because the fresh
men haven't actually played a team
match yet," said junior Lauren
Barnikow. "It's good to have at least one
match under your belt before the In
doors."
The Cardinal may not breeze
through the match, however, as the
Bulldogs sport a strong program with
one of the top players in the country in
sophomore Chloe Carlotti. Hailing from
France, Carlotti was ranked No. 27 in the
fall singles rankings.
As a freshman last season, Carlotti fin
ished with an impressive 33-16 record at
the No. 2 singles position for the Bull
dogs. Additionally, she was chosen as an
Ail-American for her stellar play.
Countering Carlotti and the rest of the
Fresno squad will be top Stanford fresh
men Alice Barnes and Amber Liu. Al
though they have no real dual-match ex
perience, both played well in preseason

tournaments and are ranked in the sin
gles top 20.
In addition, they will be accompa
nied by Barnikow, who earned a 19-5
record in dual matches last season, and
junior Emilia Anderson, who posted a
23-4 record a year ago. Sophomore
Erin Burdette, who fought to a spectac
ular 25-1 dual record last year, will also
return for Stanford.
On the Fresno side of the court will be
Carlotti, Swiss sophomore Lucia Tallo
and Croatian freshman Vlatka Jo
vanovic. This trio of foreign players com
prises the solid upper half of the team's
singles squad.
"They're always tough, they always
have a bunch of good players," Forood
said. "The fact that they're our first op
ponent in a dual match makes them that
much better."
Besides Carlotti, though, the Fresno
State team may not bring many familiar
players to Stanford this Saturday. The
teams were supposed to face off last year,
but the match was canceled due to rain,
thereby further reducing the Cardinal's
exposure to the Bulldogs.
"They have a really good No. 1 in Car
lotti, and I recognized a few of the names,
but I don't really know some of the girls,
and they weren't at the Pac-10 tourna
ments," Barnikow said.
And, like Stanford, Fresno suffered a
loss of top 2002 players to graduation.
"They did graduate their No. 1 from
the last few years, All-American Kim
Niggemeyer, but they are still a very solid

team," Forood said.
The visiting Bulldogs already have one
dual-match victory under their belt, notch
ing a 5-2 win at Cal Poly earlier this week.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal will look to
begin a dual-match season that will be the

culmination of months of tough practice
and effort.
"Everybody is playing good tennis,
and we're really looking forward to play
ing some common opponents finally,"
Forood said.

junior Emilia Anderson, who posted a
23-4 record a year ago. Sophomore
Erin Burdette, who fought to a spectac
ular 25-1 dual record last year, will also
return for Stanford.
On the Fresno side of the court will be
Carlotti, Swiss sophomore Lucia Tallo
and Croatian freshman Vlatka Jo
vanovic. This trio of foreign players com
prises the solid upper half of the team's
singles squad.
"They're always tough, they always
have a bunch of good players," Forood
said. "The fact that they're our first op
ponent in a dual match makes them that
much better."
Besides Carlotti, though, the Fresno
State team may not bring many familiar
players to Stanford this Saturday. The
teams were supposed to face off last year,
but the match was canceled due to rain,
thereby further reducing the Cardinal's
exposure to the Bulldogs.
"They have a really good No. 1 in Car
lotti, and I recognized a few of the names,
but I don't really know some of the girls,
and they weren't at the Pac-10 tourna
ments," Barnikow said.
And, like Stanford, Fresno suffered a
loss of top 2002 players to graduation.
"They did graduate their No. 1 from
the last few years, All-American Kim
Niggemeyer, but they are still a very solid

team," Forood said.
The visiting Bulldogs already have one
dual-match victory under their belt, notch
ing a 5-2 win at Cal Poly earlier this week.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal will look to
begin a dual-match season that will be the

culmination of months of tough practice
and effort.
"Everybody is playing good tennis,
and we're really looking forward to play
ing some common opponents finally,"
Forood said.
