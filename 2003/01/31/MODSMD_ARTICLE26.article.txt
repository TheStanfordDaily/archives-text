### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN STAFF WRITER 
Four weeks into the collegiate
gymnastics season, most teams have

tion. But the No. 9 Stanford women's

Conference) has a hat trick that will
be revealed diis weekend.

Unluckily for the Cardinal's
challengers, freshman Jessica
Louie, sophomore Mandy Delga
do and senior Kelsey Stillinger are
recovering from injuries and are
ready to perform.
"The timing couldn't be more
perfect for Jessica, Mandy and
Kelsey to be returning," head
coach Kristen Smyth said. "We've
got a lot of girls that could use a bit
of rest and we want to give all the
athletes more experience."
Although each gymnast is en
during painful injuries — Louie
has a bulging disc in her lower
back, Delgado underwent shoul
der and ankle surgery and Still
inger suffers from Achilles ten
donitis — the trio is keen to get
back into cardinal and white.
"It's been frustrating to watch
the other freshmen compete be
cause they're having so much fun,"
Louie said. "I'm excited to be able
to do more soon and contribute to
my team, especially because every
one's been so encouraging as I'm
getting healthy again."
"It's hard to sit back and watch,"
Delgado echoed. "I really want to sup
port my teammates by competing."
The Cardinal roster has a bonus
most coaches dream of: It possess
es depth on all four events, and six
of the 12 athletes are able to do the
all-around.
As the saying goes, blessings can
be burdens. This makes resting
athletes and staying healthy a must
to reach the team's goal of peaking

at NCAAs in April.
"The toughest job for gymnas
tics coaches is getting the team to
the end of the year healthy,"
Smyth said. "At the college level,
we compete 14 weeks in a row and
most kids are used to four meets
spread throughout the year at the
club level.
"I think conditioning is the key.
If the team is strong and fit, they're
more likely to withstand the de
manding schedule and make it to
the end of the year."
When Stanford squared off'with
rival California last Friday, fans saw
Louie and Delgado post solid per
formances on the vaulting table
and the floor exercise, respectively.
Over the next few weeks, the
trio will add to the threat the Car
dinal poses in the gym.
"Jessica was recruited for her
power and explosive tumbling abil
ity," Smyth said. "She has a confi
dent personality on the floor of a
meet that will add so much, and we
really need to get her involved."
Louie, combined with freshmen
Natalie Foley and Glyn Sweets,
rounds out the highly touted rook
ie class that has made an immediate
impact on the Farm. Sweets and
Foley have chalked up four first
place finishes between them in the
young season, and Louie will un
doubtedly add to their efforts.
Delgado's outstanding perfor
mances on vault, beam and floor
earned her Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors in 2002. She performs
a front handspring tuck front with a
full twist on the vaulting table, mak
ing her the only athlete in the coun
try to execute that impressive skill.
"Mandy added so much to what
we did last year and her personality
in competition is irreplaceable,"
Smyth said. "We especially need
her to step in on floor because the
crowd loves her performances."
Stillinger competes primarily on
vault and beam for Stanford and
serves as one of the team's captains.
"Beam is where we will use
Kelsey's leadership and consisten

cy," Smyth said. "She is upbeat, loves
to compete and is a great leader."
The Cardinal is getting healthy
just in time for tonight when Stan
ford will match wits against No. 12
Oregon State, San Jose State and
Seattle Pacific during its first home
meet of the season at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

Oregon State is coming off a
huge home opener where it upset
then-No. 1 UCLA, and will be
looking to prove that victory
wasn't a fluke. Beaver Tanya Ricoli
was named Pac-10 Gymnast of the
Week for her efforts against the
Bruins and will contend for the all
around title tonight.

place finishes between them in the
young season, and Louie will un
doubtedly add to their efforts.
Delgado's outstanding perfor
mances on vault, beam and floor
earned her Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors in 2002. She performs
a front handspring tuck front with a
full twist on the vaulting table, mak
ing her the only athlete in the coun
try to execute that impressive skill.
"Mandy added so much to what
we did last year and her personality
in competition is irreplaceable,"
Smyth said. "We especially need
her to step in on floor because the
crowd loves her performances."
Stillinger competes primarily on
vault and beam for Stanford and
serves as one of the team's captains.
"Beam is where we will use
Kelsey's leadership and consisten

cy," Smyth said. "She is upbeat, loves
to compete and is a great leader."
The Cardinal is getting healthy
just in time for tonight when Stan
ford will match wits against No. 12
Oregon State, San Jose State and
Seattle Pacific during its first home
meet of the season at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

Oregon State is coming off a
huge home opener where it upset
then-No. 1 UCLA, and will be
looking to prove that victory
wasn't a fluke. Beaver Tanya Ricoli
was named Pac-10 Gymnast of the
Week for her efforts against the
Bruins and will contend for the all
around title tonight.
