### SARAH PAPÉ EDITORIAL STAFF 
For the first time in Stanford history,
students of color constitute the majority
of a class — among this year's freshmen,
59.4 percent are non-white students. But
tor Provost John Etchemendy. numbers
aren't the only indicators of a university's
commitment to diversity on campus.
''The question is whether minorities
are given the tools to succeed,"
Etchemendy said.
To this end. last tall. Etchemendv cre
ated the Diversity Action Council to help
advise University President John Hen
nessv and himself on how to enhance di
versity at Stanford. Students, tacultv and
staff make up the council, which is bro
ken down into tour subcommittees that
focus on diversity among undergradu
ates. graduates, staff and faculty.
"As far as undergraduates are con
cerned. we have an incredibly ,gifted and
diverse populauon." said Comparative
Literature Prof. David Palumbo-Liu,
who chairs the subcommittee for under
graduate diversity.
"The key is to do two things once stu
dents get here.'' he said. 'First, to make
sure that .ill students have access to the
full range of resources and learning op
portunities, and can thrive and con
tribute here. Second, that Stanford
makes the most of these diverse back
grounds to enhance the quality of all un
dergraduate education."

Palumbo-Liu added that the subcom
mittees are also looking into undergrad
uate advising and mentoring, diversity in
curriculum, increased support for the
ethnic communitv centers, and minority
faculty hiring and retenuon. Over the
past year, each of the subcommittees has
been working to create proposals, which
are now being reviewed by Etchemendv
and Hennessv.

"We're acting on the notion that di
versity is central to the mission and the
excellence of the University," said Cul
tural and Social Anthropology Prof. Re
nato Rosaldo, who chairs the council.
"In a coordinated way, we are think
ing about how to enhance diversity at
Stanford — increase the numbers where
that is appropriate and create a better
working environment for minority staff
and students.''
Vice Provost of Campus Relations
LaDons Cordell, who chairs the subcom
mittee for staff'diversity, emphasized that
the goal of the committees is not to create
a lengthy report and to let it sit some
where without taking any action.
"This is about doing something soon
er than later," Cordell said.
The council is committed to imple
menting changes soon.
"The Provost very much wants us to
pick up some momentum on these is
sues."' Palumbo-Liu added. "The word
'action is central — we are committed to
producing results and setting a tone
here. Diversity and excellence go hand in
hand."
Rosaldo said he hopes that the recom
mendations of the subcommittees, as stat
ed in the proposals, will be put into prac
tice m the next year
"We're trving to make this all work
better," Rosaldo said. He explained that
the goal of the council is "to think of a

small number of items that could
have an impact."
The council is partly funded by
the University and will be affected
by Etchemendy's proposed bud
get cuts and hiring freezes. The
budget cuts could result in the
delay in implementing or scaling
back on some of the recommenda
tions of the council.
"The budget cuts are some
thing that has to be taken into con
sideration," Etchemendy said.
"This is not a great time to be start
ing new things."
But Rosaldo and Etchemendy
have been pleased with the work of
the council so far and remain opti
mistic about seeing the recommen

dations in the proposals come to
life.
"I have really admired the job
the council has done," Rosaldo
said. "And I've admired how the
provost and president have been
thoughtful in their reaction to the
proposals in light of budget cuts."
Rosaldo said it would have been
easy for the president to put the
council's proposals on the back
burner, but he hasn't.
In addition to receiving fund
ing from the University, the coun
cil received a $1.5 million grant
from the James Irvine Founda
tion. The foundation is dedicated
to "enhancing the social, economic
and physical quality of life
throughout California, and to en
riching the state's intellectual and
cultural environment."
The grant will be payable over
three years and will be used to help

implement the various strategies
to recruit and retain diverse stu
dents, faculty and staff.
The council is working at a time
when diversity has become an im
portant national issue, especially in
higher education.
"Stanford has a history of being
in the forefront on higher educa
tion in this area," Rosaldo said.
Rosaldo also mentioned that a
number of institutions — such as
Columbia University, University
of Michigan and Princeton Uni
versity — have taken a strong lead
in this area. But he added that, at
other institutions, "initiatives have
come from the vice provost or the
president, but not from a full slate
of collective thought."
The council at Stanford, on the
other hand, has representatives
from students, faculty and staff to
help create diversity initiatives.

" We have a historic opportunity
to extend Stanford's leadership in
this area," Palumbo-Liu said. "We
are ideally positioned as a Califor
nia university — this state is the
most diverse in the union and a
harbinger of things to come. More
and more we are recognizing that
race and ethnicity play a central
role in our new world."
Rosaldo hopes that the work of
the council will benefit the entire
I
Stanford community.
"I really wanted to do this," hie
said. "1 think it makes Stanford la
better place for everyone, human
ly and intellectually."
"I've been pleased so far," h(e
added. "[Now] we have to wait anid
see what kind of difference [the
proposals] will make.
"It's like trying to turn a big ship
around. It is going to take time to
see change."

aren't the only indicators of a university's
commitment to diversity on campus.
''The question is whether minorities
are given the tools to succeed,"
Etchemendy said.
To this end. last tall. Etchemendv cre
ated the Diversity Action Council to help
advise University President John Hen
nessv and himself on how to enhance di
versity at Stanford. Students, tacultv and
staff make up the council, which is bro

focus on diversity among undergradu
ates. graduates, staff and faculty.
"As far as undergraduates are con
cerned. we have an incredibly ,gifted and
diverse populauon." said Comparative
Literature Prof. David Palumbo-Liu,
who chairs the subcommittee for under
graduate diversity.
"The key is to do two things once stu
dents get here.'' he said. 'First, to make
sure that .ill students have access to the
full range of resources and learning op
portunities, and can thrive and con
tribute here. Second, that Stanford
makes the most of these diverse back
grounds to enhance the quality of all un
dergraduate education."

Palumbo-Liu added that the subcom
mittees are also looking into undergrad
uate advising and mentoring, diversity in
curriculum, increased support for the
ethnic communitv centers, and minority
faculty hiring and retenuon. Over the
past year, each of the subcommittees has
been working to create proposals, which
are now being reviewed by Etchemendv
and Hennessv.

"We're acting on the notion that di
versity is central to the mission and the
excellence of the University," said Cul
tural and Social Anthropology Prof. Re
nato Rosaldo, who chairs the council.
"In a coordinated way, we are think
ing about how to enhance diversity at
Stanford — increase the numbers where
that is appropriate and create a better
working environment for minority staff
and students.''
Vice Provost of Campus Relations
LaDons Cordell, who chairs the subcom
mittee for staff'diversity, emphasized that
the goal of the committees is not to create
a lengthy report and to let it sit some
where without taking any action.
"This is about doing something soon
er than later," Cordell said.
The council is committed to imple
menting changes soon.
"The Provost very much wants us to
pick up some momentum on these is
sues."' Palumbo-Liu added. "The word
'action is central — we are committed to
producing results and setting a tone
here. Diversity and excellence go hand in
hand."
Rosaldo said he hopes that the recom
mendations of the subcommittees, as stat
ed in the proposals, will be put into prac
tice m the next year
"We're trving to make this all work
better," Rosaldo said. He explained that

small number of items that could
have an impact."
The council is partly funded by
the University and will be affected
by Etchemendy's proposed bud
get cuts and hiring freezes. The
budget cuts could result in the
delay in implementing or scaling
back on some of the recommenda
tions of the council.
"The budget cuts are some
thing that has to be taken into con
sideration," Etchemendy said.
"This is not a great time to be start
ing new things."
But Rosaldo and Etchemendy
have been pleased with the work of
the council so far and remain opti
mistic about seeing the recommen

dations in the proposals come to
life.
"I have really admired the job
the council has done," Rosaldo
said. "And I've admired how the
provost and president have been
thoughtful in their reaction to the
proposals in light of budget cuts."
Rosaldo said it would have been
easy for the president to put the
council's proposals on the back
burner, but he hasn't.
In addition to receiving fund
ing from the University, the coun
cil received a $1.5 million grant
from the James Irvine Founda
tion. The foundation is dedicated
to "enhancing the social, economic
and physical quality of life
throughout California, and to en
riching the state's intellectual and
cultural environment."
The grant will be payable over
three years and will be used to help

implement the various strategies
to recruit and retain diverse stu
dents, faculty and staff.
The council is working at a time
when diversity has become an im
portant national issue, especially in
higher education.
"Stanford has a history of being
in the forefront on higher educa
tion in this area," Rosaldo said.
Rosaldo also mentioned that a
number of institutions — such as
Columbia University, University
of Michigan and Princeton Uni
versity — have taken a strong lead
in this area. But he added that, at
other institutions, "initiatives have
come from the vice provost or the
president, but not from a full slate
of collective thought."
The council at Stanford, on the
other hand, has representatives
from students, faculty and staff to
help create diversity initiatives.

" We have a historic opportunity
to extend Stanford's leadership in
this area," Palumbo-Liu said. "We
are ideally positioned as a Califor
nia university — this state is the
most diverse in the union and a
harbinger of things to come. More
and more we are recognizing that
race and ethnicity play a central
role in our new world."
Rosaldo hopes that the work of
the council will benefit the entire
I
Stanford community.
"I really wanted to do this," hie
said. "1 think it makes Stanford la
better place for everyone, human
ly and intellectually."
"I've been pleased so far," h(e
