59.4 percent are non-white students. But
tor Provost John Etchemendy. numbers
aren't the only indicators of a university's
commitment to diversity on campus.
''The question is whether minorities
are given the tools to succeed,"
Etchemendy said.
To this end. last tall. Etchemendv cre
ated the Diversity Action Council to help
advise University President John Hen
nessv and himself on how to enhance di
versity at Stanford. Students, tacultv and
staff make up the council, which is bro
ken down into tour subcommittees that
focus on diversity among undergradu
ates. graduates, staff and faculty.
"As far as undergraduates are con
cerned. we have an incredibly ,gifted and
diverse populauon." said Comparative
Literature Prof. David Palumbo-Liu,
who chairs the subcommittee for under
graduate diversity.
"The key is to do two things once stu
dents get here.'' he said. 'First, to make
sure that .ill students have access to the
full range of resources and learning op
portunities, and can thrive and con
tribute here. Second, that Stanford
makes the most of these diverse back
grounds to enhance the quality of all un
dergraduate education."

Palumbo-Liu added that the subcom
mittees are also looking into undergrad
uate advising and mentoring, diversity in
curriculum, increased support for the
ethnic communitv centers, and minority
faculty hiring and retenuon. Over the
past year, each of the subcommittees has
been working to create proposals, which
are now being reviewed by Etchemendv
and Hennessv.

"We're acting on the notion that di
versity is central to the mission and the
excellence of the University," said Cul
tural and Social Anthropology Prof. Re

"In a coordinated way, we are think
ing about how to enhance diversity at
Stanford — increase the numbers where
that is appropriate and create a better
working environment for minority staff
and students.''
Vice Provost of Campus Relations
LaDons Cordell, who chairs the subcom
mittee for staff'diversity, emphasized that
the goal of the committees is not to create
a lengthy report and to let it sit some
where without taking any action.
"This is about doing something soon
er than later," Cordell said.
The council is committed to imple
menting changes soon.
"The Provost very much wants us to
pick up some momentum on these is
sues."' Palumbo-Liu added. "The word
'action is central — we are committed to
producing results and setting a tone
here. Diversity and excellence go hand in
hand."
Rosaldo said he hopes that the recom
mendations of the subcommittees, as stat
ed in the proposals, will be put into prac

"We're trving to make this all work
better," Rosaldo said. He explained that
