# So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night!

### RYAN SANDS 
Just like Boyz II Men, we've come to the end of the
road. And good lord are we ready to let go. Volume 222
has been the best of times and the worst of times.
Though Alice and I found our academic careers nearly
ruined by the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours spent
at the Storke Publication Building, the issues were rad,
the graphics were hot, and we featured reviews with
some of the entertainment world's biggest up and com
ing stars, like ... um ... Duncan Sheik and one of the
non-Casablancas Strokes.
Before we take a final bow, we would like to thank all

the kids who read Intermission
these past 14 issues. We calcu
late that, subtracting writers,
roommates, mothers and a sig
nificant other, there are per
haps seven of you out there that
read our indie fanzine-esque
labor of love. We reach out our
hands to you dedicated readers
and as a sign of our apprecia
tion, we've included a coupon
on page 11 that can be re
deemed for one free kiss at the
Intermission kissing booth we
will be heading at the coming
Spring Activities Fair.
Oh, and our dedicated staff
â€” how could we forget you? We
want to give "much love" to the
kids who toiled under of author-

itarian thumbs and pounded out garage rock, punk and
singer-songwriter reviews of the highest possible caliber.
Our non-review features, including Bay Area guides of
all shapes and sizes and some hard-hitting investigative
reporting (did someone say "bikini wax?").
We need to take a moment now and give a proper
farewell salute to ChenLi, who schemed and planned
some of the coolest layouts and raunchiest graphics this
side of New Orleans. Thank you ChenLi! I'm sorry that
your mother could never read your publication because
of one special little lady.
Speaking of which ... dear Roxy, how do I love you?
Let me count the ways. Or rather, let me reflect on your

progressively las
civious missives
which brought
smiles to the faces
of campus ladies
and provided
masturbatory
fodder from the
high rises of
Blackwelder to
the Penthouse of
Roble. I managed
to make it
through this vol
ume unscathed
by Roxy's sexual
advances, but the
same can't be said
for the rest of
Stanford campus.
With that, our
thank you's and
good wishes end.

We pushed our managing editors around and managed
to super-size this last issue up from a black & white 8-
pager to a glorious 12 pages with a full color spread!
Please enjoy our swan song, as we gladly reclaim our so
cial lives and free time from this 12-headed beast that
has been the Intermission. Starting next week, Ms. Jen
nie Kim and Mr. Chris Lee will be bringing you the lat
est and greatest A&E on a weekly basis. They are very
kind and outrageously attractive people, and we hope
you'll love them almost as much as you loved us.
