# Desensitive yourself to penises AND enjoy theatre!
## 
### ERICK FLORES 
Oh, the sweet irony. Never did I once think I
would be seeing a show called "Puppetry of the
Penis" in the yuppie suburb Redwood City. But I
did, and the Fox Theatre was complete with every
one I imagined to be a Redwood City archetype:
white, middle-aged, middle-class soccer moms, ei-

ther with friends on a "girls' night
out" or with their equally typical
(and possibly impotent) husbands,
who had been dragged along on
the date only because the next day
was the Super Bowl.
I have to admit that my favorite
part of the show was the "hip"
kindergarten teacher sitting in
front of me, who got so drunk that
she entered the cackle and fall-out-

of-your-seat phase, all while trying to look out for
parents from which she would have to hide. Why
hide? Because if you were to run into your kid's
teacher at a show about men that prance around
stage wiggling their cocks at the audience, wouldn't
you think twice about sending your children to
school the next day?
Well, that's what this show is — a stage act of two
men doing dick tricks on stage, while throwing in a
joke here and there, always about the penis. I'd like
to think of it as a fusion of "The Full Monty" and
MTV's "Jackass," but even the word "fusion" makes
me uncomfortable. It's usually a word that would be
reserved for describing some cultural or artistic com
bination in some fancy book, paper or brochure.
And this show was by no means art.
There are no elaborate stage settings or lighting,
no fancy music orchestras, no story lines, and for
that matter, probably not even a script. The sole cos
tumes are the capes the two men wear, and the only

props used are pieces of wood and other such things
that the men put their members through to simulate
tricks, like one called "the squirrel." Despite being in
a theatre, you can't even call the men actors. As they
say themselves, "Our dicks are the real stars of the
show — we're just the life-support system."
But where this show goes right is that it doesn't
pretend to be artistic, satirical or political. Putting

frames around their packages and
calling them portraits of George W.
is about as political as the duo gets.
"Puppetry of the Penis" is a mind
less creation from Aussies Simon
Morley and David Fiend (why do
shows about beefy nude men always
have to be Australian?), who one
day, probably while shit-faced,
thought it would be a good idea to
make money off of playing with

themselves on stage, trying to add credibility to the
show by calling it something fancy, like "the art of
penis origami."
Indeed, you can't help but notice the expression
of gloat the duo has onstage, as they stretch, twist,
bend, tuck and wrap their Johnsons in every
unimaginable and seemingly painful way possible,
as they imitate everything from body parts (the eye,
the heart, the hairy tongue) to culinary arts (hot dogs
with cheese!, hamburgers, chicken drumsticks).
They bite their lips, stick out their tongues and raise
their eyebrows like little boys that can't get enough
of touching themselves.
The show is a good time to be had, especially if
you're looking to be desensitized to penises. But I
would say $50 is a bit much to watch them on ajum
botron. Ladies and gay men, if what you're looking
for is stimulation and titillation, you might as well cut
your losses short and get a good porn or even a
cheap hustler.
