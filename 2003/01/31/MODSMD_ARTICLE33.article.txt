# 'Max’ too strained and clumsy to be effective

### JESSICA JOFFE 
i "Max" is about Hitler. It's about a
I little guy who spat a lot when he spoke,
painted portraits of smiling cocker
spaniels, and then when diat didn't work
out, presented himself and his fuming
brand of hard future-kitsch as die solution

to German post-war malaise.
"Max," contrary to ex-

pectation, is not Herr Hitler's
secret nickname, but diat of a
fictional art-dealer called Max
Rothman (Jewish, naturally),
who decides, in a moment of

philanthropic delusion, to
take little Adolph under his
wing. The pint-sized mon-

ster is neither particularly
talented, intelligent, nor
charming, and yet manages
to insinuate his way into

112 Rothman's consciousness
immediately, the repercus
sions of which are far worse

than one might have antici
pated for the majority of the
film. "Max" attempts to capture

the moment when these two op
posing figures are dirown together
Hitler as demented art student.

and the early stages of Hider's rise to po-

litical power.
Rothman is a former World
War I Offizier and artist
plagued, like many others, by
the idea that it was simply luck
that saw him survive while most
his trench-bound compatriots
did not. He lost the arm he
painted with in the process, and
so, aided by a sizable trust fund,

opens a conceptual gallery in a derelict train sta
tion on the outskirts of Munich, in an attempt to
remain a fixture in the world he knows so well
and loves. He has a penchant for drinking more
champagne than he can afford, conducting
extra-marital affairs with teenage artists and
throwing cynical artsy jargon ("It doesn't have
to be good, nor beautiful: It just has to be true")
about the place as though his life depended on
it. But he is also a doting father, a gentle hus
band and a genial son-in-law.
This, of course, is what the filmmakers rather
ham-fistedly want to convey as the contradictory
nature of man: Most of us are morally ambiguous,
neither good nor bad, and we're just trying to do
our best, hoping that it will somehow work out. In
rendering Rothman this way, the filmmakers
wanted, perhaps, to make a general statement
about the lack of moral certitude pervading post
war societies across Europe, which allowed for
something like WWII to occur in the first place.
But if historical analysis was their intention,

their poorly created characters and ten
dentiously constructed arguments ham
per the results. The two protagonists are
no more than a neat pile of traits and
flaws — one perpetually limp-wristed
and morbid, the other perpetually out
raged and unbearable. What the film
makers thought in casting John Cusack
as the suave artist type remains baffling.
The ease and grace with which lit* slips
into his usual roles is absent here, "dome

on Hider, let me buy you a lemonade," is just
about the most suitable line uttered and inciden
tally the most memorable line of the entire film.
First-time director Menno Meyjes, a decorated
screenwriter, lays down a surprisingly affected
script, over-determined and flimsy ;dl at once. He
and producer Andras Hamori claim their mission
was to stray from conventional depictions of Hitler,
to embrace the taboo, but the final result is neither
daring nor original. They've applied Freud for
Dummies to Hitler and put W.W.1.1. down to the
fact diat the greatest dictator of all times was simply
a misunderstood artist. And they even invented a
tidy formula to explain away the whole phenome
non. "Art + Politics = Power."
If I am correct in assuming that "Max," with all
its contentious subject matter, wants to convey
some sort of message to its viewers, its arch and su
perficial tone does not match up with its very seri
ous and bleak conclusion. But then, this is not the
first time a director should assume that mere style
can compensate for inconsequent development.
