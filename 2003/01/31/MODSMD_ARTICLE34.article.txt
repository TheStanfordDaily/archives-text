# 'Lost' chronciles trainwreck film production
## 
### MICHAEL BAER 
Terry Gilliam, who got his start in
"Monty Python," is perhaps best known as

the director of such adventurous

films as "Brazil," "The Fisher
King," and "12 Monkeys," all

quite successful considering
their unconventionality. How
ever, throughout the 19905, he
had been gathering informa
tion fora film based on Cer
vantes' "Don Quixote de la
Mancha." In 2000, he began
production on this film, starting

Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp. This is
not the film reviewed here, because that film
was never finished.
Instead, "Lost in La Mancha," a project
begun as a "making of' documentary for the
"Quixote" DVD, stands on its own. It is a
movie detailing the truly quixotic misadven
tures of Gilliam trying to make the film,
"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote," in
which Depp is a time traveler playing the
part of a reluctant and foulmouthed Sancho
Panza to Rochefort's Quixote.
Judging from the talent and the props, it
might have been a truly magnificent film.
However, Gilliam admits from the start that,
because it is made without Hollywood back
ing, it will have to be made for half the price
such a film should cost. This will be a chal
lenge, requiring reduced pay, a tight sched

ule,and no room for error. Error occured,
though in the beginning, it is not clear if it
will ultimately be weather, illness, facilities,

scheduling, or the proximity of a
NATO bombing range that will
ultimately doom "Quixote." It is

fascinating to see what does.
In the meantime, we are
given insight into the process of
making a film, both big-budget
and independent; in a sense,
the failed "Quixote" is both.
The curses of Gilliam and
Quixote — as well as their com
monalities — are also explored,

quite intriguingly. Gilliam tends to mount
near-impossible productions about unbal
anced characters standing up to an unbal
anced world, so in some sense he has been
both filming and living "Don Quixote."
More banal is the role of the insurance
company when a film's prospects go up in
smoke. As when dealing with private indi
viduals, the company — never named - tries
to wriggle out of any obligation, to the point
where every problem is deemed an "act of
God." Meanwhile, Gilliam wants to keep
shooting, saying he just wants to be "filming
something to justify years of work."
Much like "Adaptation," the film shows
what happens when one link in the movie
making process comes loose. This factual
story is as entertaining and interesting as
many fictional stories, but it is ultimately a

documentary. The details are interesting be
cause they are real. The unsuccessful making
of "Quixote" provides it with a natural plot.
"Lost" may not entertain all. Not every
one enjoys seeing "making of' films or see
ing a titanic endeavor falling apart as the
seams. It also doesn't go nearly as far as fans
might want. One might wonder if the film
will ultimately wind up in a Gilliam box set,
complemented by a better explanation of
the overall context of both the failed movie

and Gilliam's other work.
Nevertheless, "Lost in La Mancha" may
be as close to "The Man Who Killed Don
Quixote" as we're ever going to get, and,
taken on this basis, as well as on the basis of
its entertainment value, it is a film that
should be seen. As Gilliam himself told the
directors, "This project has been so long in
the making and so miserable that someone
needs to get a film out of it, and it doesn't
look like it's going to be me."
