# What is 'Emo-punk piano?'
## SOMETHING CORPORATE 
### DINA WALLIN 
"You don't see us playing at CAL any
where on this tour, do you?"
— Andrew McMahon, at the
show at Stanford.
"We're Something Corporate... we're
not about precision, we're about good
times," proclaimed the band's lead singer,
Andrew McMahon. as the band played
Kresge Auditorium on Jan. 21. One
couldn't guess that, though, from the
band's rocking performance, and from
their overwhelming success — they came
to Stanford after selling out a show at the

Fillmore in San Fran
cisco the night before.
Since starting out in
Orange County in
1998, Something Cor

porate (McMahon on
piano and vocals, guitarists Josh Parting
ton and William Tell, bassist Clutch, and
drummer Brian Ireland) has had nothing
but success with their emo-punk-piano
sound that can only be accurately classi
fied as rock. MCA's Drive-Thru records
signed them in 2001, and they've been
rocketing to fame ever since the release of
"Leaving Through the Window" (2002).
The band toured this summer with the
Vans Warped Tour and in the fall with
New Found Glory and Finch, and landed
dates in London and Paris, three days be
fore kicking off this tour in Ventura, CA. I
chatted with McMahon for 40 minutes in
the tour bus before the San Francisco
show.
INTERMISSION: How long have you
been playing the piano?

SOMETHING CORPORATE: Eleven
years.
INTERMISSION: Did you start with the
finger exercises and the classical? Or did
you start by plunking out songs by ear?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: 1 started
just by writing songs... [in] fourth grade,
some kid taught me how to play. I think it
was"A Whole Lotta Shakin' Coin' On" by
Jerry Lee Lewis. You know, I had taken a
piano lesson in my life, but that was pretty
much it. I used the chord that I had
learned in my right hand, and just fol-

lowed it around the piano, then started
writing.
INTERMISSION: Back when you were
in junior high and high school, did you go
to all the punk concerts or was that not
something you were into?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: No, no,
the first punk show I had ever been to, I
was a senior in high school.
INTERMISSION: Really?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: I like a lot
of punk now, just 'cause we've been so sur
rounded by it. I think it's fucking awe
some, and I love what it's done for music,
'cause I think [punk is] spreading that to
kids and getting them really excited about
music, and I think that's what music has
been lacking - an overall excitement.

There hasn't really been a scene for peo
ple in high school to really go and be into
music, you know? So yeah, I used to go to
shows, but I was into bands like . . . Ben
Folds, Counting Crows, Jimmy Eat
World.
INTERMISSION: So, what's your pre
show routine, now that you're touring so
much?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: We do a
band prayer before every show, and, we
just kind of reflect on how lucky we are to
be where we are, which 1 think is really im-

portant for us. On one hand, aside from
anything spiritual about it, it gets us fo
cused and attentive, all on the same page
and ready to do what we have to do.
Sometimes you gotta smack yourself
around and be like, "OK, we're gonna
play a show right now."
INTERMISSION: What about coming
down after a show?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: It really
depends on the show and stuff like that. I
mean, I haven't really had the opportuni
ty to party in the past week or so, just be
cause it's the first time we've ever done
hour sets every night, so I kinda just look
after myself, make sure I'm in bed early,
that kinda thing [laughs]. I think it's fun to
party, but the reason we get the chance to
do that every night is because we play
music, and that's g6tta be kinda the prior
ity. I think, a lot of times, bands kind of
forget the reason they're there is for of the
music, and it becomes about the extrane
ous elements of the lifestyle — which are
great, don't get me wrong! But, for these

kind of sets, I
think that I
gotta just

take it easy fora little while.
INTERMISSION: Do you ever feel like
you're sacrificing other parts of your life
by doing the band thing? Like, by not
going to college?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: Of
course. I mean, you have to sacrifice
everything, really, for the most part. We
get to a point where doing something like
this, I don't think it's really looked at as a
sacrifice. It's a concession, it's something
that you do; you give up certain things to
do other things. I think of a sacrifice as

something that you
give up that leaves
some sort of huge
void, and to be hon
est, what we do real
-1 Cll a.

ly fills any space that
has been left empty by anything I've had
to give up to do it.
INTERMISSION: If you weren't in the
band, then, what would you be?
SOMETHING CORPORATE: Trying to
be in a band. It's weird, it's all I've ever
wanted to do since the first day I wrote a
song. We have always been really motivat
ed. I remember all of us just sitting
around and we'd always been so motivat
ed and ambitious with the band, but it was
never motivated and ambitious towards
getting a record deal. [It was] like, we love
to do this, we love to play music, we're just
gonna play, and we didn't really think be
yond that. I mean, we would be excited by
the idea of getting signed or things like
that, but the motivation was, "We love
playing music." We didn't know why we
practiced twice a week, we didn't know
why we took it so seriously, we didn't
know why we played shows all the time.
INTERMISSION: Just because it made
you happy.
SOMETHING CORPORATE: Yeah,
and that was really all it was. So, we ended
up being found somehow — but iealiy.

t'oe only reason we got found is
that we did it enough because we
had so much fun. So many people,
they make it their goal in life to get
signed by a record label. I mean, if
you have your choice of spending
all your time shopping demo tapes
or spending all your time sitting in
your garage playing music, you
should be in your garage playing
music. You should be out playing
shows. 'Cause shopping a demo
tape maybe will get you signed, but
playing music is what's fulfilling to
you.

INTERMISSION: How old were
you when you got your first kiss?
SOMETHING CORPORATE
Like, tongue kiss?
INTERMISSION: Yeah, like, real
kiss.
SOMETHING CORPORATE: I
was ... shit... wait, no, no, I know
exactly when it was, it was. Begin
ning of sixth grade, this chick that
I had in drama — I was in, like, a
community theater. I made out
with this girl in the back of her
friend's mother's van, while her
mother was driving. Fucking so
cool — I rubbed her thigh and
everything. I was like, one of the
first guys to make out in the whole

school. I lived in Ohio, so things
were a little slower until everybody
got way into drugs, but . . . you
don't understand, I mean, I was fat
too, I was really fat as a kid, and I
had girls who were into me be
cause they knew I had experience.
INTERMISSION: Are you seri
ous?!
SOMETHING CORPORATE:
They ran away pretty quickly
when they looked at me and real
ized how fat I was, but...

Something Corporate are continu
ing their U.S. tour with the Juliana
Theory throughout the entire month of
February, and, are planning on releas
ing a new album in the fall.
