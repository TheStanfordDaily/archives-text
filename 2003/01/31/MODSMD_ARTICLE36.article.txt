# From tha Chuuuch to da U.K

### ANDREW NIELSEN STUDYING AT OXFORD, ENGLAND 
"I camc all the way from San Francisco to rock you guys
tonight. How many of you have heard of William Shake
speare?" The crowd responds enthusiastically. "I guess he's
kind of famous," 1 say, before pressing play on my laptop and
rapping over my "Macbeth" homage hip hop track. It goes
over well, and later, Simon, the lead singer of a rock group
called the Samurai Seven, tells the crowd ironically, "Lars
was right. Shakespeare is pretty well established."
I've been here for about a month, and have so far opened
fora few local rock acts as a solo hip-hop act. At first, I was
treated with some distrust and derision, as seen in one re
sponse after posting on a local message board about my rap
ping: "Okay, whose idea of a sick joke was that?" Not every
one appreciates rap music here, as guitar-driven indie music
seems to dominate the radios of and venues of England.
1A * C _

What else would you expect from
a country that helped establish
rock music, giving us the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones and the Who?
But, even though rock music may
be more popular, hip-hop has
been here fora long time in vari
ous degrees of popularity and
seems to be gaining momentum.
Hip hop as an art form itself
has a long, multi-faceted history.
If we want to pick an actual point
of its germination, it can be ar
gued that the genre first emerged
when Jamaican DJ Kool Here ar
rived in New York in August of
1969, and began putting break
beats together for b-boys and b
girls in the South Bronx. In the
34 years after, hip-hop pervades
practically every avenue of West
ern civilization, packaged and
processed like McDonalds' ham
burgers and Coca Cola. It is no
surprise that Britain, a first-world
brethren to the country that
spawned this genre, would feed

off of New York's late 20th century
contribution to rap music.
So far, there have been a few
notable British hip hop albums.
Derek B's 1988 "Bullet from a
Gun" did not sell as much as he
would have liked, but ii put U.K.
hip hop on the map as a genre with
roots in U.S. rap. In 1990, London
rapper Monie Love showed the
world that women from the U.K.
could rap as well, with her debut
"Down to Earth." But what should
be noted is that most hip hop here
derives much of its inspiration
from electronic music, manifested
in such bands as Massive Attack,
who fuse hip hop and avid-jazz to

create more syncopated rhythms.
Black Twang, an artist I re
cently discovered,

put out an
album last
May entided
"Kick Off." It
is a great
album that I*
feel best re
flects the*
U.K. sound
of hip-hop,
and for those

of you back in the U.S. in
terested in hearing what
good contemporary Eng-

lish rap sounds like, pick it
up. Another one of the
U.K.'s finest albums of
2002 was Mike Skinner's (i.e.

the Streets) "Original Pirate Ma
terial." The record is hugely popular
over here in England as well. British



hip-hop has invaded the rest of the
world after the U.S. has pervaded
the U.K., which is an interesting
cross-cultural phenomenon.
However, being an MC here in
England has made me think about
the ethics in trying to find one's
voice in a genre like hip hop. I feel
a twinge of guilt as I rhyme over
tracks with a rhythmic sense I most
likely could never have established
on my own. Is it right to twist the
music that African-Americans in
New York created 30 years ago

and make it international and ho
mogenized?
Rap music has indeed gained
much notoriety worldwide. Who
would have thought dial when MC's
in New York first started rapping,
people in England would be doing
the same 20 years later? Apparendy
hip-hop is here to stay, its manifesta
tion in die U.K. being a true testa
ment to die genre's durability.
"As London Bridge burns
down Brixton's burning up..."
Mike Skinner raps on the new
Streets LP, "don't conform to for
mulas, pop genres and such.
Sharp darts, double dutch, parked
cars trouble you much . . . let's
push things forward."
