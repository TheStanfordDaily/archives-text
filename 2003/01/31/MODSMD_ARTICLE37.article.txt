# Musique tzigane, out from the underground
## 
### JENNIFER CARR STUDIED IN PARIS, FRANCE 
A picture of the weekday morning ritual during my
"petit voyage a Paris": bound across the Metro platform,
force myself into the crowded city train, grip onto the
greasy handrail and fish around in my pockets for loose
change to toss into the plastic coffee-cup of next starving
accordionist or violinist. Flappers in flamenco dresses,
withered elders in windbreakers-musicians from all walks
of life were always stumbling down the aisle my way.
Like Chicago's Land New York's subways, the Paris
Metro is always bouncing with the harmony of clinking
coins and panhandlers' melody-making. But the French
rapid transit music scene has come to be dominated, not
by Tony Bennett hits wailed into karaoke machines, but
by a genre of world music that's practically unknown to
American audiences: musique tzigane, or gypsy music.
The popularity of musique tzigane isn't isolated to the
(literal) underground of Paris subway tunnels. The genre
has seen a rapid rise in recognition worldwide through
the few decades. Jazz guitarist Django Reinhart and vio
linist Stephane Grappelli are generally credited with hav

the formation of the Quintette du Hot Club de France in
the 19305. More recently, the French director Tony Gatlif
drew international attention with his 1993 film, "Latcho

Drom," an awarding-winning documentary exploring
gypsy culture through its music and dance.

ing a modest following: the catchiness of the music's
melodies is only exceeded by the danceability of its tem
pos; and if the lyrics tend not to deviate from a core the-

matic of sex and de
bauchery, they're at
least partly concealed
within the relative ob
scurity of their tongues.
Festivals of musique

Tzigane are held annually throughout
Paris in such grand venues as la Pare de
la Villette and such petite ones as la
Guinguette Pirate - a 20' by 30' flyboat
turned-concert hall roped to the shore
of the Seine. Even local corner bars oc
casionally sponsor Saturday evening
concerts and flood Paris' famed cobble
stone streets with melancholic Slavic
arias and bubbly jazz rhythms.
At one such concert, I met
with Zsuzsanna Varkonyi â€” a virtu
ally penniless Roma-Hungarian ac
cordionist and vocalist whose accom
paniment had recently abandoned
her to follow the nomadic footsteps of
their ancestors. Varkonyi initially
took the stage with a impish smile and
a 50-pound accordion that seemed as
