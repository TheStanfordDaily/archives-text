# Musique tzigane, out from the underground
## 
### JENNIFER CARR STUDIED IN PARIS, FRANCE 
A picture of the weekday morning ritual during my
"petit voyage a Paris": bound across the Metro platform,
force myself into the crowded city train, grip onto the
greasy handrail and fish around in my pockets for loose
change to toss into the plastic coffee-cup of next starving
accordionist or violinist. Flappers in flamenco dresses,
withered elders in windbreakers-musicians from all walks
of life were always stumbling down the aisle my way.
Like Chicago's Land New York's subways, the Paris
Metro is always bouncing with the harmony of clinking
coins and panhandlers' melody-making. But the French
rapid transit music scene has come to be dominated, not
by Tony Bennett hits wailed into karaoke machines, but
by a genre of world music that's practically unknown to
American audiences: musique tzigane, or gypsy music.
The popularity of musique tzigane isn't isolated to the
(literal) underground of Paris subway tunnels. The genre
has seen a rapid rise in recognition worldwide through
the few decades. Jazz guitarist Django Reinhart and vio
linist Stephane Grappelli are generally credited with hav
ing brought the genre before the French public eye with
the formation of the Quintette du Hot Club de France in
the 19305. More recently, the French director Tony Gatlif
drew international attention with his 1993 film, "Latcho

Drom," an awarding-winning documentary exploring
gypsy culture through its music and dance.
It isn't surprising that musique tzigane is finally gain
ing a modest following: the catchiness of the music's
melodies is only exceeded by the danceability of its tem
pos; and if the lyrics tend not to deviate from a core the-

matic of sex and de
bauchery, they're at
least partly concealed
within the relative ob
scurity of their tongues.
Festivals of musique

Tzigane are held annually throughout
Paris in such grand venues as la Pare de
la Villette and such petite ones as la
Guinguette Pirate - a 20' by 30' flyboat
turned-concert hall roped to the shore
of the Seine. Even local corner bars oc
casionally sponsor Saturday evening
concerts and flood Paris' famed cobble
stone streets with melancholic Slavic
arias and bubbly jazz rhythms.
At one such concert, I met
with Zsuzsanna Varkonyi — a virtu
ally penniless Roma-Hungarian ac
cordionist and vocalist whose accom
paniment had recently abandoned
her to follow the nomadic footsteps of
their ancestors. Varkonyi initially
took the stage with a impish smile and
a 50-pound accordion that seemed as

though it might collapse her
waifish frame. After exhausting
her small repertoire of solo pieces,
she turned to the small, smoke
filled crowd for accompaniment,
coaxing a few reluctant friends to
the stage. These included a prepu
bescent cousin that, after a few
minutes' protest, finally agreed to
join her in the spotlight, beating on
a small ceramic vase and cooing to
the audience in lilting soprano.
Varkonyi described musique
tzigane to me as "so capable of as
similating other musical influences
while keeping as a 'seed,' for one
thousand years now, its unique
rhythm and force." "Assimilating
other influences" is right: musique
tzigane exhibits a remarkable cos
mopolitanism. As early as the
1600s, transient gypsy trouba
dours or Lautari — many of whom
couldn't read music — toured Eu
rope and the Middle East, absorb
ing local sounds and mimicking
local styles with magpie-like acquis
itiveness. Conventional gypsy
music therefore represents a sort of
patchwork musical tradition, piec
ing together elements of other

world music from as far east as
India and as far west as Brazil.
At another concert I attended,
this one featuring the Roma-Brazil
ian band Cordo del Fogo, half of the
spectacle was witnessing how the en
ergy of gypsy music penetrates and
jubilates its listeners. Adolescent
girls danced like dervishes over the
dried leaves of the Luxemburg Gar
den's long, unraked lawns, while
grandmothers swung their heads
and bounced their heels with broad,
satisfied smiles. Meanwhile, band
members donned ornately beaded
costumes and painted wooden ani

mal masks as they banged on
marimbas and xylophones, shout
ing to the audience in energetic
Brazilian.
The Paris Metro system provides
a sort of mobile stage that recalls
musique tzigane's place of birth-in
the horse-hitched wagons of fiddle
toting troubadours, wandering on
the fringes of Fortress Europe.
Varkonyi describes the transitory
tradition of gypsy music singing the
following from a 300-year-old Hun
garian song: "Cold wind blows me /
as far as the earth is from the stars. /
Oh, the chariot rolls without end."

tzigane to me as "so capable of as
similating other musical influences
while keeping as a 'seed,' for one
thousand years now, its unique
rhythm and force." "Assimilating
other influences" is right: musique
tzigane exhibits a remarkable cos
mopolitanism. As early as the
1600s, transient gypsy trouba
dours or Lautari — many of whom
couldn't read music — toured Eu
rope and the Middle East, absorb
ing local sounds and mimicking
local styles with magpie-like acquis
itiveness. Conventional gypsy
music therefore represents a sort of
patchwork musical tradition, piec
ing together elements of other

world music from as far east as
India and as far west as Brazil.
At another concert I attended,
this one featuring the Roma-Brazil
ian band Cordo del Fogo, half of the
spectacle was witnessing how the en
ergy of gypsy music penetrates and
jubilates its listeners. Adolescent
girls danced like dervishes over the
dried leaves of the Luxemburg Gar
den's long, unraked lawns, while
grandmothers swung their heads
and bounced their heels with broad,
satisfied smiles. Meanwhile, band
members donned ornately beaded
costumes and painted wooden ani

mal masks as they banged on
marimbas and xylophones, shout
ing to the audience in energetic
Brazilian.
The Paris Metro system provides
a sort of mobile stage that recalls
musique tzigane's place of birth-in
the horse-hitched wagons of fiddle
toting troubadours, wandering on
the fringes of Fortress Europe.
Varkonyi describes the transitory
tradition of gypsy music singing the
following from a 300-year-old Hun
garian song: "Cold wind blows me /
as far as the earth is from the stars. /
Oh, the chariot rolls without end."
