# Grindcore Punk lives in Japan!
## 
### NATE SHOCKEY STUDYING IN KYOTO, JAPAN 
It's New Years Eve. The streets of Kyoto, Japan are packed
with people upholding the time-honored Japanese tradition
of the shrine visit. Everyone puts on their best, bundles up
against the cold and heads off to their local shrine to pray for
the next year to be a good one. Compared to the typical Amer
ican New Year's bash it's a bit of a solemn affair.
Around the corner from Yasakajinja, one of the most pop
ular shrines in town, a New Year's celebration of a whole dif
ferent kind is taking place. All the punks in Kyoto have con
vened at Whoopees Live House, a small basement club where
local punk and indie bands often play shows. Tonight,
Whoopees is holding an all-night 15-band fiesta. Those in at
tendance are a lot more concerned with ringing ears than
with

ringing in the New Year. Over at the shrine, ymi might bow
your head in prayer and reverence, but down Vlere it's so you
won't get hit by the next beer can, microphon/stand or stage
diver that might come flying your way. /
On stage, bands like The Outnauts, Radio Shanghai, Con
stricted and Humpty Dumpty kick out the jams, frenzied 90
second belches of fury, spite and spit, wl/le the faithful whirl
their fists in the mosh pit churning below. Needless to say, it's
a hell of a lot more fun than putting on /suit and ringing some
temple bell. The show finally draws tor a close around 5 in the
morning, but not before a few and vodka botdes meet
their end on the dingy tile floor. /
Yes dear readers, even in Jap/n does the spirit of punk
rock live on. In fact, the countr/that most people associate
with little more than crowded trains, geisha girls, video games
and sushi has produced some w the best pissed, fast and loud
music ever to grace this earth* In the early '80s, while Ameri-

can fans were aancing their coked-out minds
„/ ~1 L A__ I

aiway to cheesy synth-beats and
/ vapid pop music, the Japanese
' were banging their heads

along to the likes of
Guerilla Incendiary Sabo
tage Mercenaries (GISM),
Sabotage Organized Bar
barian (SOB) and The
Comes. These bands

somehow even managed to re
lease records on major labels.
Maybe the Japanese people were
rebelling against materialistic afflu
rv .1 • ... l .1

ence. Or then again, maybe they just
wanted to rock.
However, like most fads in Japan,

the punk trend too was short-lived and
forgotten in a matter of years. In the old
days, bands used to sell-out stadiums and play

to crowds of thousands Bon Jovi
style. (Well, Bon Jovi never at
tacked his audience with flame
throwers, cinder blocks or swift
kicks to the head, but you know
what I mean). Nowadays, punk
has been confined to the base
ments of pay-by-the-hour love ho
tels while the rest of the country
bops along to the beat of generic
pop garbage like Morning
Musume.
But then again, punk was never
meant to be part of the main
stream. Like foot fungus and that
clown from"It," punk thrives in
dark, forgotten places. Yeah sure,
you've read about punk in maga
zines and stuff, but forget that —
The Clash and The Sex Pistols are
for karaoke. The scene is alive and
well in Japan, but it's not doing so
bad in America either. So put
down that White Stripes record,
pick up something good and start
the pit!
Some Japanese bands to check out:
The Registrators (garage punk),
Husking Bee (emo), Guitar Wolf (crazy
dirty rock and roll), Ckiuze (hardcore),
Teengenerate (punk), Rocky and the
Sweden (thrash) and Melt Banana
(like uxitching a video of a chipmunk on
acid reading a comic book on fast for
ward).
