# Indian television: The cult of the joint family
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN BORN RAISED IN NEW DELHI, INDIA 
While I am usually a sieve for my grandmodier's incessant chat
ter, my ears pricked up when I heard that Mihir had died in a car
crash. This news had come in the midst of several random narra
tions and I finally folded my newspaper, inquiring solicitously
about the death of this unknown family friend. "It's sad," I said, and
mumbled something about traffic regulations.
It was only the next morning that I realized I was among the few
ignoramuses who didn't know that Mihir was a character on India's
then-biggest TV soap: "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" ("Be
cause the mother-in-law was once a daughter-in-law"). The whole
republic of India was up in arms that this man — this clean-shaven,
well-spoken, beatific vessel of values — had been struck ofr the sta
tic by some corporate decision.
Headlines spoke of tragedy. Angry letters were mailed in to Bal
aji Tele-films, the producers of the show. Mothers everywhere wept
into their starched saris. TV ratings plummeted in defiance. Strikes
and meetings were held outside the offices of Balaji Tele-films.
Tempers flared.
And so Mihir was brought back to life. "It was some dude who
looked something like him who had died," retorted Balaji.
But this is not his story. Instead, this is the story of the newest is
land on the delta where fantasy meets reality — the Great Indian
Television Soap. It's only been four years since India's cable net
works l>egan airing episodes about the drama of the upper-class
joint family and now even Bollywood has competition.

Nearly all these soaps boast in
distinguishable story lines, showcase
melodramatic acting and possess tides
beginning with "K" (for good luck, appar-

endy). The central feature is the urban joint-family and the tensions

it represents. Women (bitches / goddesses) are

anchored in their

traditional
roles as a
homemak-l
ers. Men

such as Mihir drop awful, saccharine lines. The mother-in-law en
gages in sinister puppeteer-ing. Marriages are viciously arranged.
Still, the titles of shows such as "Ghar Ghar Kee Kahani" ("The
Story of Every Family") may be misnomers. In fact, this whole phe
nomenon represents an interesting dichotomy — viewers are typi
cally city-dwellers who live in nuclear families and aspire to increas
ingly liberal values, while the shows carry strong messages about an
India of traditions and hierarchies. What draws these viewers who
have junked the joint-family juggernaut?
For one, the joint family, with its collection of random relatives,
is a construct seething with intrigue and malice. It allows directors
to pull off an Indian version of "The Bold and the Beaudful" with-. >
out an overdose of adultery and sexual innuendo, thus making it
socially acceptable. A whole generation views the rites and rituals of
its childhood updated to a modern setting. This modern setting, as
opulent and vulgar as it may seem, is also an escape for young peo
ple who struggle with the drudgery of urban life.
By channeling the drama of the great Indian epics and applying
their clear demarcations of good and evil, these shows market role
models for Indian society. So much so, that the arranged-inarriage
circuit is abuzz with people asking specifically for sons-in-law "like
Mihir". Or as my grandmother puts it — "Either you're with the
Mihir, or you're against him".
Furthermore, as a part of this revivalism, "sales of holy tulsi
plants, worshipped by the women of the house, have shot up...retro
clothes and furnishings featured on the shows are all the rage," ac-
