Scrnes (ngnrj and Stanford outplayed the Wildcats ast night, in one of oniv three wins Stan
fiord has -sver recorded against a tap-ranked
In the first half, foul trouble
plagued both teams in a very tight
ly officiated match.
Advantage Wildcats: Arizona
boasts a much deeper bench diana
depleted Cardinal roster.
Sophomore swingman Josh
Childress picked up two early whis
tles while guarding senior Luke
Walton. Junior Justin Davis picked
up three very quick fouls. Sopho
more forward Nick Robinson
picked up two.
With 2:24 left in the half,
sophomore center Rob Little
scored off a Julius Barnes miss to
extend Stanford's lead to nine at
37-28. However, the next trip
down the court, with junior center
Joe Kirchofer waiting at the scor
er's table to relieve him, Little
picked up his third foul.
And when you add to that Kir
chofer's three first-half fouls, fresh
man forward Matt Haryasz was the
only member of Stanford's front
court not in foul trouble.
"I had all of my post guys in
jeopardy foul-wise," Montgomery
said. "Arizona is very physical in
subtle ways."
The Wildcats, however, could
not capitalize. Shooting a dismal 55
percent from the charity stripe, Ari
zona had a five-minute stretch late
in the first half in which it missed
seven straight free throws.
The Wildcats managed to escape
the half with only 11 team fouls, al
though Salim Stoudamire picked
up two quick fouls and had to sit.
Stanford shot 7-for-10 from the
line and the Cardinal went into the
locker room up by three off 43 per
cent shooting from the field and 4-
of-10 shooting from behind the arc.
After the break, Stanford came
out shooting. The Cardinal opened
the half on an 18-7 run, extending
its lead to as many 14. The opening
run was due in part to the ability of
Stanford to really work on the of
fensive glass.
With 16 minutes left to play, Lot
tich hit a 3-pointer after three Car
dinal offensive rebounds to extend
Stanford's lead.
But the Wildcats mounted their
comeback in a hurry.
Arizona, which stayed religious
in its full-court press throughout the
game, started to see its defense pay
dividends in the second half. The
Wildcats answered the Cardinal's
run with a 26-16 run of their own.
"They got very hungry, very ag
gressive up front," Montgomery
said. "Arizona came at us in the sec
ond half, got the crowd in it. They

took their best shot."
Once again, the game came
down to the wire. With two minutes
left to play, Gardner scored a layup
and was fouled to tie the game at
75-75. He failed to put the Wildcats
ahead, though, when he missed the
and-one.
After tough full-court pressure,
Robinson scored a driving layup to
put Stanford back up by two, and
after an Arizona miss Lottich hit a
deep 3-pointer over Stoudamire
with 54 seconds left to play, quickly
extending the Cardinal's lead to five.
"[Sometimes] you put so much
effort into getting back in [the
game], that your energy's not there
[at the end] when you need it." said
Arizona head coach Lute Olson.
"Stanford did a great job. Any way
they could outplay us, they did."
Arizona forward Rick Anderson
scored his first field goal of the
game to bring the Wildcats back to
within three with 43 seconds left on
the clock.
But Stanford then ran 20 sec
onds off of the clock before Arizona
fouled Lottich. Lottich missed the
first half of a one-and-one situation,
leaving the Wildcats the opportuni
ty to tie. Gardner missed a tough 3-
point shot and Walton fouled
Barnes going fora desperation re
bound, putting the Cardinal senior
on the line to shoot one-and-one
with 8.5 seconds on the clock.
Barnes stepped to the line and
knocked them both down, bringing
the final score to 82-77.
"We just came out and hung in
there," Montgomery said. "For
these young kids to come in and
handle [the pressure], I think, is a
big feat."

SAUL LOEB/The Daily Wildcat
Despite a ieascn-high 20 points from Luke Walton (Set*; and a hostile Tucson crowd, Julius
Scrnes (ngnrj and Stanford outplayed the Wildcats ast night, in one of oniv three wins Stan
fiord has -sver recorded against a tap-ranked
In the first half, foul trouble
plagued both teams in a very tight
ly officiated match.
Advantage Wildcats: Arizona
boasts a much deeper bench diana
depleted Cardinal roster.
Sophomore swingman Josh
Childress picked up two early whis
tles while guarding senior Luke
Walton. Junior Justin Davis picked
up three very quick fouls. Sopho
more forward Nick Robinson
picked up two.
With 2:24 left in the half,
sophomore center Rob Little
scored off a Julius Barnes miss to
extend Stanford's lead to nine at
37-28. However, the next trip
down the court, with junior center
Joe Kirchofer waiting at the scor
er's table to relieve him, Little
picked up his third foul.
And when you add to that Kir
chofer's three first-half fouls, fresh
man forward Matt Haryasz was the
only member of Stanford's front
court not in foul trouble.
"I had all of my post guys in
jeopardy foul-wise," Montgomery
said. "Arizona is very physical in
subtle ways."
The Wildcats, however, could
not capitalize. Shooting a dismal 55
percent from the charity stripe, Ari
zona had a five-minute stretch late
in the first half in which it missed
seven straight free throws.
The Wildcats managed to escape
the half with only 11 team fouls, al
though Salim Stoudamire picked
up two quick fouls and had to sit.
Stanford shot 7-for-10 from the
line and the Cardinal went into the
locker room up by three off 43 per
cent shooting from the field and 4-
of-10 shooting from behind the arc.
After the break, Stanford came
out shooting. The Cardinal opened
the half on an 18-7 run, extending
its lead to as many 14. The opening
run was due in part to the ability of
Stanford to really work on the of
fensive glass.
With 16 minutes left to play, Lot
tich hit a 3-pointer after three Car
dinal offensive rebounds to extend
Stanford's lead.
But the Wildcats mounted their
comeback in a hurry.
Arizona, which stayed religious
in its full-court press throughout the
game, started to see its defense pay
dividends in the second half. The
Wildcats answered the Cardinal's
run with a 26-16 run of their own.
"They got very hungry, very ag
gressive up front," Montgomery
said. "Arizona came at us in the sec
ond half, got the crowd in it. They

took their best shot."
Once again, the game came
down to the wire. With two minutes
left to play, Gardner scored a layup
and was fouled to tie the game at
75-75. He failed to put the Wildcats
ahead, though, when he missed the
and-one.
After tough full-court pressure,
Robinson scored a driving layup to
put Stanford back up by two, and
after an Arizona miss Lottich hit a
deep 3-pointer over Stoudamire
with 54 seconds left to play, quickly
extending the Cardinal's lead to five.
"[Sometimes] you put so much
effort into getting back in [the
game], that your energy's not there
[at the end] when you need it." said
Arizona head coach Lute Olson.
"Stanford did a great job. Any way
they could outplay us, they did."
Arizona forward Rick Anderson
scored his first field goal of the
game to bring the Wildcats back to
within three with 43 seconds left on
the clock.
But Stanford then ran 20 sec
onds off of the clock before Arizona
fouled Lottich. Lottich missed the
first half of a one-and-one situation,
leaving the Wildcats the opportuni
ty to tie. Gardner missed a tough 3-
point shot and Walton fouled
Barnes going fora desperation re
bound, putting the Cardinal senior
on the line to shoot one-and-one
with 8.5 seconds on the clock.
Barnes stepped to the line and
knocked them both down, bringing
the final score to 82-77.
"We just came out and hung in
there," Montgomery said. "For
these young kids to come in and
handle [the pressure], I think, is a
big feat."
