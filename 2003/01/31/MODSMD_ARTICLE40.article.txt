# This just in...The World is STILL Tight!!!
## 
### JULIAN WASS 
When my column, "The World
is SO Tight!!!," was cancelled, I
was crushed. I fought bitterly, but
in the end, my editor and friend
Ryan had to break this boy's heart
by telling me that I would no
longer be able to share tight
things with the Stanford commu
nity. I must admit, there were
tears, and there were harsh words
thrown about. I was hurt, but I
thought that perhaps TWIST was
the sole reason that tight things
kept happening in this world and
that maybe I was being selfish.
Maybe if I let TWIST go, people
would stop beating kids to death
over a package of breakfast
sausages, or that fathers would
never inject their 11-month old
babies with the HIV virus to avoid
paying child support (By the way,
what the fuck is up with this guy?
Doesn't he know about modern
medicine? People with HIV live a
long time and run up huge med
ical bills. Who's going to pay that,
I wonder?).
I drank heavily and abused
drugs to deal with my pain. I
thought, "Hey, if it means that no
more children get brutally mur

dered and no more Australian
people perform dick and balls tor
ture while playing "Lightning
Crashes," I will allow myself to slip
quietly into degenerate drug and
alcohol addiction and slowly fade
away." I watched my bank account
dwindle to nothing, and once I had
no more money for heroin and
crystal meth, I started sneaking
into laundry rooms and mainlin
ing various detergents. Mountain
Fresh Tide burns when you first
shoot it, but you get used to it pret

ty soon.
When the cops found me, I was
curled up behind dryer #5 in the
Alondra basement, packing a used
Bounce sheet into what was once
my crack pipe, Estella. Estella, piss
infested and chipped, was a testa
ment to how far I'd fallen. Her
bowl, once filled with fat, juicy
crack rocks, was now a home to
dead insects, assorted seeds from
bagels, Flinstones vitamins — any
thing to numb the pain of my can
cellation.

The police were going to give
me a good old "Santa Clara Spe
cial," (Officer Reilly, if you're read
ing this: I agree with you — I don't
think it's legal either) but decided it
would be better to take ine to a
rehab facility. At first, I refused
food and medical attention. What
good could I be to the world? What
I had to otter to the world of jour
nalism only seemed to result in the
horrible torture and deaths of in
nocent people.
Then, I saw it. On the newspa
per that the orderlies put down to
cover the stains I had made on the
floor:
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Attackers
killed a 3-year-old girl and repeat
edly stabbed her 10-year-old sis
ter with a butcher knife early
Wednesday outside a Mesquite
casino where their mother was
gambling.
"Tight," I thought to myself. I
glanced over at another paper:
CHICAGO, Illinois (AP) — Offi

cers searching a home for drugs
and weapons found a 3-year-old
boy chained by the neck t(\ a
bedpost.

I searched through more pa
pers, only to find similar tales of
tightness. "How can this be? With
out me writing about these things,
they can't happen! My cancellation
and spiral into addiction was sup
posed to stop this! How can the
world be so tight without "The
World is SO right!!!"?"
Since then, things have been
looking up. I'm 92 pounds now,
up from the 75 I weighed when I
got here. My pee is purple and
brown, which is cool because the
doctors at the facility said they
have never seen anything like
that before, and that makes me
feel special. Dr. Miller says my
pee might turn green next week.
I've studied the chart, and I
know that after that, its pink,
then orange, then electric blue,
then yellow. When it turns yel
low, I get a Rice Krispies Treat.
Isn't that tight?
