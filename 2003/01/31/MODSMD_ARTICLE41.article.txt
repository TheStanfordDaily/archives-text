"Bum Fights" is totally fucked up. I mean, se
riously.
For those of you out there in freedom land
who haven't heard of "Bum Fights," it's the em
bodiment of P.T. Barnum's maxim, "Nobody
ever went broke by underestimating the taste of
the general public." The film is produced by a
bunch of bratty little punks from Las Vegas who
thought it would be a blast to get homeless folks
to do degrading shit (one of the most wretched
part of the films is where the boys pay one home
less fellow to rip out one of his own teeth) fora

couple of bucks or a forty. GOD
BLESS AMERICA and the home
video cam. The piece has received
plenty of coverage from the big
media outlets, hailed as perhaps the
greatest product yet on the shock
market. It has sparked controversy
over Fifth amendment rights and
some of the creators, those involved
in the hi-jinx on video, have been
sent to jail. The film, however, re
mains available for purchase at bum
fights.com.
The star of the film is Rufiis the
stunt bum. His main gig is slamming
his head into things. Things include:
a Burger King drive through menu,
a window (for Christ's sake!) and
other bums. Rufiis also dives off of
parking structures into rubbish bins.
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

T-Bone the track dealer gives us the run
down on his business and how he is a master of
"serving rocks" and making "honey real quick
with a mentality that is sharp all day." Later, Bling
Bling (who coincidentally has had first, third, and
fourth encounters with extraterrestrial beings)
demonstrates how to smoke crack with "bling
bling expertise" to the viewer. After hitting up the
good rock, he busts a freestyle that is indescrib
able. While on the topic of CRACK (a frequently
broached subject in "Bum Fights"), there is a dra
matic show down between two crack dealers. The
thin and dazed one gets clocked in the temple at
the peak of the argument.

A good deal of "Bum Fights" is dedicated to
Steve Irwins, bum hunter. The lads go about
capturing homeless men in the back of their van
by whatever means possible, including tackles,
duct tape and nets. Montages set to rowdy punk
music splice together clips of things like punk
kids beating the shit out of each other, bums
jumping out of moving cars, the boys throwing
dead ducks and fishes at people and Santa,
Snoopy and a cow in a bum fuck conga line. The
film also asserts its "urban" nature with a seg
ment of the boys spray painting sleeping bums.
When the bums don't wake up, they make sure
to spray Krylon into the top of the sleeping bag.

The tone in which I relayed the
content above is representative of
the tone of the film: flippant, irre
sponsible and unaffected. "Bum
Fights" on the whole is a pretty
disgusting view, and frankly, I
could barely make it through the
entire thing. My discomfort arose
from the fact that human suffer
ing could so easily be packaged
and sold with MTV-flavored
chutzpah. Beyond that, it upsets
me that there is a public that is
ready to consume it happily.
There is something menacing in
the fact that it has attracted popu
lar attention (and money), which
suggests it is truly symptomatic of
a culture that is comfortable with
the commodification ofjust about
everything.


Some spoiled asshole kid clocks Rufus the stunt bum
