# ‘Quality’ accessible yet ambitious
## 
### KAREEM GHANEM 
It stands to reason that
when the country goes to
shit, artists with a social and
political conscience will
have plenty to say. Is it any
wonder that hip hop came
of age telling the truths of
the Reagan and Bush ad
ministrations? Well, the
country's gone to shit once
more, making it a very good
time to be Talib Kweli. As
the rapper declares on his
newest album, "Quality,"
"The President is Bush /
The Vice President's a
Dick."
On "Quality," Kweli
makes it clear that his goal is
to expose his work to a
greater audience — cer
tainly an understandable
artistic ambition. With an
art form as commercialized
as music, however, this en
tails a degree of sacrifice in
order to make the work
more accessible — witness
Common's new "Electric
Circus" or The Roots'
"Phrenology." So, in this
sense, "Quality" is both
Kweli's most and least ambi
tious record yet, giving it an
overall conflicted character.
For starters, the produc-

tion on this record is far, far smoother than
Kweli's work with DJ Hi-Tek on the "Re
flection Eternal" album. Similarly, it lacks
the endearing roughness that character
ized the "Black Star" album he cut with fel
low Brooklyn hip hop star Mos Def. "Mos
Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star" made
a compelling case for both rappers because
it juxtaposed two vastly different lyrical
styles. Namely, it paired Kweli's lack of
flow with the über-slick Mos Def.
It was this combination that first made a

name for the duo. The only
track here that comes close to
recreating that synergy is the
playful, earnest "Joy," which
features Mos Def ruminating
with his friend, Kweli, about fa
therhood. Other selections
from the album are transpar
ently calculated "break
through" efforts.
Last year's übiquitous —
and uniformly boring — trend
of pairing a male rapper and fe
male R&B singer rears its
shameless face here on "Stand
To The Side," "Cun Music"
and "Won't You Stay." Kweli
isn't the only high-profile con
scious hip hop personality to

slide into this pit. To his credit, Jurassic s's
collaboration with Nelly Furtado and
Common's "Come Close" with Mary J.
Blige are both more embarrassing than
anything to be had here. Alas, none of
these rappers are Ja Rule, and with that in
mind, ladies and gentlemen, my snobbery

ends.
To be fair, "Quality" is one of few new
hip hop releases to even approach merit
ing that title. On "The Proud," Kweli lends
his capable voice in deploring the Ameri
can media's hypocrisy after the Oklahoma
City bombing and praising the rescue
workers at the Pentagon and Twin Towers
on Sept. 11. Painting these issues in a
human way, he confides, "I struggle to ex
plain the situation to my son / It's hard."
Ain't it the truth.
