# Alice gets weird for the last time
## 
### ALICE KIM 
This is my goodbye to you, readers. For
the last time, I will be weird all up in your
faces and tell you three things I have enjoyed
recendy.
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey": For many
years, I was under the impression that "Bill
and Ted's Bogus Journey" was a terrible se
quel, a film that should have been exposed
on a hill in its infancy, even though I had
never seen it. But although nothing can
match the sweet exuberance and historical

celebrity power of "Bill and Ted's Ex
cellent Adventure," I must admit

that "Bogus Journey" is a won
derful movie. A

First of all, in "Bogus

Journey" Bill and
Ted are forced to,
look beyond their j
slacker lives to thel
bigger is-

sues:
nature of life V
and death, heav-

en and hell, which always
means GOD. Bill and Ted
die in this movie! Theyj
play Battleship with 4

Death, they go to hell ("I can't do in
finity pushups!"), and they fight
their evil doppelganger robots by
building their own doppelganger
robots. Bill and Ted also give
someone a Melvin; I will not spoil
the delicious surprise by telling
whom they give it to.

The set design in this movie is
gorgeous, especially for heaven
and hell. The acting is pretty im
peccable, with standouts being
Ted's dad (he's fabulous in a scene

in which he's possessed by the dead Ted!)

and an exasperated, foppish Death.

There's plenty more. Just
give a great film a chance.

"Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to
L all Creation": Pop science

books are my friends. Es
pecially smart, sharp,
funny ones that are more
than just disconnected

i assemblages of facts.
I "Dr. Tatiana" is struc
f tured in the form of
Q&A sex columns, only
the lovelorn writing in

are not people; they're
elephants, spotted hyenas, li-

onesses, and every other type of crea
ture under die sun.
They ask questions such as "I'm a

spotted hyena, a girl. The only
trouble is, I've got a large phallus.
I can't help feeling that this is un
ladylike. What's wrong with me?"
You get to find out about sexually
obsessed elephants' penises turn
ing green, stick insects that copu
late for 10 weeks at ago and the fly
that makes a sperm longer than it
self. Most horrifically, you also learn

of the insect that is pregnant before it is born.
It's gross, as well as disturbing in a classical in
cestuous Greek drama sense.
However, it's not just trivia with which
you can impress the hell out of your friends.
"Dr Tatiana" is also an interesting overall
look at the evolutionary biology of sex and
promiscuity. All of you evolutionary biology
geeks in the house, and also those just in it
for the trivia, should read it.
Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce: Sriracha, how I
love thee. This is the perfect hot sauce. Übiq
uitous in all types of Asian restaurants and
dorm cafeterias, Sriracha is instantly recog
nizable and convenient: The proud red
rooster on its label allows any intimidated by
Southeast Asian pronunciation to identify it

by description, and Sriracha itself is con
tained in a convenient plastic squeeze botde.
The sauce is a beautiful orange-red neutron
death color, with an immaculate texture. It
tastes like the sweat of the gods — basically,
it will render anything lusciously spicy and
red; your pho, your eggs, your chocolate
chip cookies. It's up to you, because this is
the best goddamn sauce in the world. Be
lieve it.
