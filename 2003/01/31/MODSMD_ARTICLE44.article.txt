### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Let Roxy say it loudly, once and for all: SIZE DOES MATTER. More so in extreme
cases, but yes, it always matters. Always. How else to explain Napoleon's insatiable quest
to tear up the better part of Europe? That famous portrait of him with his hand tucked
surreptitiously into his coat-front clearly signals penis insecurity. And what girl hasn't se
credy fantasized about what makes those cocky Stanford athletes so damn cocky?
Forget about all those myths linking his dick to his fingers, feet and height. Turns out
the average difference in length between a 5'4" and 6'4" guy is a paltry half-inch. That's
because most men fall into the five to seven inch range, regardless of height, race, weigh t
and shoe size.

So, on any given Saturday night, most of us encounter penises that measure close to six

inches, about the size of an unwrapped Butterfinger bar. Any
thing significandy larger is met with an equal mix of trep- /

o o / o * t *
[idation and fascination. No need to fear ladies,
vagina is clinically defined like real estate, "a space" fl
that just happens to be surrounded by muscles and tis
sues. It may take an entire tube of Astroglide, but he will
be able to squeeze it in there.

But girls, if he does reach John Holmes propor
tions, avoid any acrobatic sex- A

ual positions that involve

you on your back with your knees bent or your legs over your head unless your lung needs
scratching. Woman on top, besides being a general crowd-pleaser, is the best way to ma
neuver that joystick.
"Oh that Roxy," you exclaim, "What a wishful thinker!" Fine, fine, I suppose it's time
to venture onto dicks on the wrong side of average. What to do if he's a shade small? First,
keep things in perspective: The smallest penises on record measure one centimeter
(erect!) and are clinically referred to, somewhat cruelly, as "micropenises." What are they
called when they aren't aroused, Roxy wonders, "microsoft?"
If you're a man with a fun-sized pecker, the best sexual positions for the both of you are
variations on the missionary â€” try placing a pillow under her lower back for more lever
age. Whip out the vibrator to help polish her off if need be.
Ms. Sass, eternal optimist that she is, has even discovered a few unexpected advantages
of such encounters. Men who are stingily endowed are anything but in bed; they tend to
go the extra mile to make up for that extra inch. Also, going down on him is a hell of a lot
easier.
Really, as long as a guy has the girth to get you off, the sex can be as earth-shatteringly
(great as with a super-sized member. Sure, everyone loves a big dick, but very few women
use a man's measurement as a major determinant in a relationship.
Just remember that old Girl Scout saying (being a Girl Scout dropout, this is only rough
ly paraphrased), "What you have is a gift from God, and what you do with what you have
is your gift to God." Come on guys; use your gift, and show us God!


"Dude, your fish is touching mine." "Dude, that 7 s gross." "But hot."
