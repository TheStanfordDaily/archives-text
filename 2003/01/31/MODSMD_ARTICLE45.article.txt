# BIKINI KILL ’s riot grrl swagger lives on

"It's not about getting the chords
right, for starters!"
So Joe Strummer told us two
decades ago. But sometimes we for
get. Sometimes we're so impressed
by technique, by musicianship, by
talent, that we lose sight of the direct,
visceral blow to the guts that even
the most primitive rock 'n' roll can
deliver.
Which brings us, in roundabout
fashion, to Bikini Kill.
The band's music wasn't stupid,
and it wasn't like its members
couldn't play. But Bikini Kill sure as
hell wasn't subtle, either. Basically,
the band — particularly on "The
C.D. Version of the First Two
Records," which brought together
the Bikini Kill mini-LP and "Yeah,
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah" — showed the
world that the rage and speed of
hardcore punk could be co-opted
out of the hands of the meatheads.
There were female punk bands
before Bikini Kill, but few that had
dared to be so primal and raw, and
even fewer that made gender so cen
tral to their music. Thus, the band's
sound was at once startlingly old
fashioned and revolutionary.
Singer Kathleen Hanna didn't

hide her ambitions
(musical and political), i
either. Fora moment I
on the opening track "

"Double Dare Ya" —

when she meekly promis-

es the studio technician, "Sorry, we're
starting now" — she seems almost shy.
But a second later, the band kicks into
gear and Hanna bellows, "We're Bikini
Kill! We want revolution, grrrl style,
NOWWW!"
In true punk fashion, the band blazes
through 13 songs in half an hour —
most of them fast, violent thrashes call
ing for feminist solidarity and giving a
sharp middle-finger to "the Man." The
first six tracks (the ones from the first
mini-LP) are the songs that really burn
themselves into the listener's mind,
starting with the direct, transcendent
anger of "Double Dare Ya" moving
through the gleeful headbanging of
"Carnival" and finishing with the art
punk experimentation of "Thurston
Hearts the Who" (on which Hanna
reads a magazine article about the band
over the "real" music and lyrics).
Despite the high quality of the entire
album, "Suck My Left One," — a very
funny, very disturbing look at incest and
reclaiming female sexuality — is without
question the standout. Keeping pace with
drummer Tobi Vail's frantic pounding,

Bikini Kill
The C.D. Version of the First
Two Records

Hanna declares,
"We've got to
show them we're
worse than
queer!" She re
sponds to the

warning, "Wait 'till your father gets
home," by savoring every syllable of the
chorus:
"SUCK ... MY ... LEFT ... ONE!"
Although the C.D.'s second half loses
some of the momentum, it's still fast-paced
fun. Plus, it contains an early version of
"Rebel Girl," which boasts the line "In her
kiss, I taste the Revolution!" and would
later be rerecorded by the band under the
guidance of Joan Jett.
The tracks on "The C.l). Version of the
First Two Records" were, in many ways,
"historic" — they helped launch the early
'9os riot grrrl movement, they put riot
grrrl locus Olympia, Wa. and indie label
Kill Rock Stars on the musical map and
they inspired a new batch of feminist rock
ers, most famously Sleater-Kinney.
Bikini Kill itself would go on to release
two more full-length albums and perform
legendary live shows before the band
broke up and Hanna reinvented punk
rock AGAIN with LeTigre.
But "The C.D. Version of the First Two
Records" is hardly a historic artifact. Ten
years later, it still has the same swagger, the
same sneer and the same vicious bite.


Kathleen Hanna — loved by riot grrls the world over.
