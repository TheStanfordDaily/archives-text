## 
### JENNIFER TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Thursday, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood ele
mentarv school district extended the contract of In
tenm Supenntendenr. Flovd Gonella tor in indefinite
period. Gonella. who has held the post tor a little over
two months, will continue to work, without pay due to
the district's recent legal troubles and financial insta
bility.
Charlie Viae Knight, who served as Ravenswood's
superintendent tor 17 years, was placed on paid ad
ministrative leave on Dec. 9, 2002, alter a flood of
legal allegations surfaced. Gonella took over the posi
tion shortly thereafter.
The Ravenswood eiementarv school district is cur
rently involved in a lawsuit tiled by families of dis
abled students. The plaintiffe claim that, under
Knight, the district tailed to provide adequate pro
grams tor disabled students. If tbund liable, the dis
trict could be ordered to foot all or some of the multi
million dollars needed to establish such programs ui
its schools.
In light of the district's financial hardship and in
ability to pav two salaries tor the same position.
Gonella agreed r.o work, without pay on Jan. 6, when

he officially stepped down as the San Mateo Countv
superintendent of schools.
He will not receive any compensation for work
done between then and todav. when his current con
tract as interim superintendent ends. He mav, how
ever. receive retroactive pav for labor done under the
new contract, which begins tomorrow
Goneila had originaHv planned to retire this vear
but has put those plans on hold to take on the task of
rebuilding the Ravenswood elementarv school dis
trict.
"I'll stay as long as they want me." he said.
At the time ot" his appointment, Ravenswood
had 0.3 percent of its budget m reserves, well
under the 3 percent state minimum. Due to the
multitude of legal troubles lacing the school dis
trict. it has been pavmg a monthly attornev tee of
$600,000 — which Goneila has since reduced to;
$30,000 bv emplovmg the services of the County
Education Counsel.
He has also proposed $400,000 in budget cuts and
is anxiously awaiting $2 million m education im
provement compensation promised by the state of
California, according to Goneila.

Yet, Gonella is the first to admit
there is still much to be done.
"It's an incredible challenge,
but it's incredibly exhilarating," he
said.
Shortly alter last year's local
elections, school board members
joined together in efforts to oust
Knight and instate Gonella, at
least as a temporary solution. Now
that Gonella has convinced many
in the district that he is an effective
leader, there is a push to end
Knight's contract.

"It's been a long time coming,
and I feel we owe the community
what we promised," Ravenswootl
school board trustee Adam Mitchell
said. "We need to move on."
Yet the cost to buy out Knight's
contract would be $225,000 —
money the struggling district just
does not have.
Gonella emphasized that while
the district works to overcome fi
nancial and legal obstacles, the
main purpose of the school district
should be providing quality edu
cation to its students.
" I felt a very strong profession
al obligation to do this," said
Gonella. "The district critically,
critically needed help."
