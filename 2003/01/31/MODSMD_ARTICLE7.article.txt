# Stanford weighs in on new birth control
## Drug reduces number of menstrual cycles from 13 to four a year 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By the end of the year, the
Food and Drug Administration
may approve a new birth control
pill, commonly called Seasonale,
that may have a dramatic impact
not only on contraceptive meth
ods but also on female lifestyles.
When Seasonale is used correctly,
it can effectively reduce the num
ber of periods a woman has each
year from 13 to four. While this
unique aspect of the pill has some
women and medical professionals
at Stanford anxiously awaiting its
release, many others remain
skeptical.
Seasonale is composed of estro
gen and progestin, two hormones
regularly found in other oral con
traceptives. While the cumulative
amount of hormones contained in
Seasonale is lower than that of
other birth control pills, such as
Levlen and Ortho Tri Cyclen, it
must be taken 84 days in a row
rather than the standard 21 days
before the customary seven-day
break.
Similar to other conventional
birth control pills, Seasonale works
by suppressing ovulation and pre
venting the development of an en
dometrium layer in the uterus.
"Women have informally been

achieving the effects of Seasonale
for years by simply skipping the
week of placebos in their regular
birth control pills," said Kati
Willoughby, a women's health and
Herstory coordinator at the
Women's Community Center.
"Providing a pill specifically
intended for this will hopefully
lead to greater communication
about the issue between patients
and health-care providers," she
said.
There are relatively few health
concerns related to the use of Sea
sonale. Negative side effects in
clude breast tenderness and blood
clots in very rare cases, though
these symptoms were reported to
disappear within the first several
months of use. Research has also
concluded that the pill will not en
hance women's chances of devel
oping breast cancer.
In fact, physicians suggest that
menstrual suppression resulting
from the use of the pill may even
be healthy for women.
"In a primitive society, women
may only have 10 or 20 periods in
her life because she is pregnant or
breastfeeding the rest of the time,"
said Dr. Jerry Shefren, a director
in the obstetrics and gynecology
department at the School of Medi
cine. "Having regular 28-day cy
cles year after year may in fact be
abnormal."
Some doctors believe that
women who ovulate regularly
without getting pregnant have
higher risks of certain cancers and
endometriosis, a condition that

could lead to internal bleeding and
lesions resulting from malfunc
tions in the menstrual cycle. In ad
dition, oral contraceptives are
shown to cut the risk of uterine
and ovarian cancer.
"It sounds like any woman's
dream come true, not having to
deal with pads, tampons, etc.," said
Valerie Lundy-Wagner, a campus
and community outreach coordi
nator at the WCC.
The pill is still pending govern
ment approval; however, with tests
consistendy proving it safe and ef
fective, Seasonale may be available
with prescription by the end of this
year. Upon FDA approval, Stan
ford's health centers will need to de
cide whether to provide it as anoth
er birth control option for patients.
"I do hope that [Vaden Health
Center] distributes Seasonale,"
Willoughby said. "I believe that
women should have the opportu
nity to choose to control their men
struation if it is medically possible.
However, I don't believe it is the
right choice for everyone."
The WCC will continue to be
heavily involved in educating
women about their birth control
options, regardless of the Univer
sity's decision concerning Sea
sonale. The WCC will most likely
hold workshops and information
sessions on Seasonale and other
methods of birth control toward
the end of winter quarter.
While the community center
will not advocate use of this pill
over other methods of contracep
tion, the staff expressed their hope

to create a forum to raise women's
awareness of Seasonale, and to
help students make informed
choices about whether or not to
use the product.
"Our main purpose is to pro
vide women in Stanford's commu
nity with information," Lundy-
Wagner said. "After consulting a
physician who recommends it,
women on campus should defi
nitely have access to this form of
birth control."
The WCC and other health
sources also expressed the need to
draw women's attention to the fact
that Seasonale is not a proper form
of contraception when used alone.
"Unfortunately, oral contracep
tives only work at preventing preg
nancy, but they don't do a thing
about sexually transmitted infec
tions," said junior Erik Wong, a
peer health educator at Freshman
/ Sophomore College. "So we al
ways advise that students know
what other forms of contraception
there are, and that the pill can be
used in conjunction with a con
dom."
While the University will need
to decide whether or not to have
the drug available by prescrip
tion, a variety of resources on
campus will still provide women
with the information they need to
make educated decisions regard
ing the pill.
"It will be interesting to see in
ten years down the road, if the
phenomenon of monthly men
struation is still commonplace,"
Willoughby said.

pill, commonly called Seasonale,
that may have a dramatic impact
not only on contraceptive meth
ods but also on female lifestyles.
When Seasonale is used correctly,
it can effectively reduce the num
ber of periods a woman has each
year from 13 to four. While this
unique aspect of the pill has some
women and medical professionals
at Stanford anxiously awaiting its
release, many others remain
skeptical.
Seasonale is composed of estro
gen and progestin, two hormones
regularly found in other oral con
traceptives. While the cumulative
amount of hormones contained in
Seasonale is lower than that of
other birth control pills, such as
Levlen and Ortho Tri Cyclen, it
must be taken 84 days in a row
rather than the standard 21 days
before the customary seven-day
break.
Similar to other conventional
birth control pills, Seasonale works
by suppressing ovulation and pre
venting the development of an en
dometrium layer in the uterus.
"Women have informally been

achieving the effects of Seasonale
for years by simply skipping the
week of placebos in their regular
birth control pills," said Kati
Willoughby, a women's health and
Herstory coordinator at the
Women's Community Center.
"Providing a pill specifically
intended for this will hopefully
lead to greater communication
about the issue between patients
and health-care providers," she
said.
There are relatively few health
concerns related to the use of Sea
sonale. Negative side effects in
clude breast tenderness and blood
clots in very rare cases, though
these symptoms were reported to
disappear within the first several
months of use. Research has also
concluded that the pill will not en
hance women's chances of devel
oping breast cancer.
In fact, physicians suggest that
menstrual suppression resulting
from the use of the pill may even
be healthy for women.
"In a primitive society, women
may only have 10 or 20 periods in
her life because she is pregnant or
breastfeeding the rest of the time,"
said Dr. Jerry Shefren, a director
in the obstetrics and gynecology
department at the School of Medi
cine. "Having regular 28-day cy
cles year after year may in fact be
abnormal."
Some doctors believe that
women who ovulate regularly
without getting pregnant have
higher risks of certain cancers and
endometriosis, a condition that

could lead to internal bleeding and
lesions resulting from malfunc
tions in the menstrual cycle. In ad
dition, oral contraceptives are
shown to cut the risk of uterine
and ovarian cancer.
"It sounds like any woman's
dream come true, not having to
deal with pads, tampons, etc.," said
Valerie Lundy-Wagner, a campus
and community outreach coordi
nator at the WCC.
The pill is still pending govern
ment approval; however, with tests
consistendy proving it safe and ef
fective, Seasonale may be available
with prescription by the end of this
year. Upon FDA approval, Stan
ford's health centers will need to de
cide whether to provide it as anoth
er birth control option for patients.
"I do hope that [Vaden Health
Center] distributes Seasonale,"
Willoughby said. "I believe that
women should have the opportu
nity to choose to control their men
struation if it is medically possible.
However, I don't believe it is the
right choice for everyone."
The WCC will continue to be
heavily involved in educating
women about their birth control
options, regardless of the Univer
sity's decision concerning Sea
sonale. The WCC will most likely
hold workshops and information
sessions on Seasonale and other
methods of birth control toward
the end of winter quarter.
While the community center
will not advocate use of this pill
over other methods of contracep
tion, the staff expressed their hope

to create a forum to raise women's
awareness of Seasonale, and to
help students make informed
choices about whether or not to
use the product.
"Our main purpose is to pro
vide women in Stanford's commu
nity with information," Lundy-
Wagner said. "After consulting a
physician who recommends it,
women on campus should defi
nitely have access to this form of
birth control."
The WCC and other health
sources also expressed the need to
draw women's attention to the fact
that Seasonale is not a proper form
of contraception when used alone.
"Unfortunately, oral contracep
tives only work at preventing preg
nancy, but they don't do a thing
about sexually transmitted infec
tions," said junior Erik Wong, a
peer health educator at Freshman
/ Sophomore College. "So we al
ways advise that students know
what other forms of contraception
there are, and that the pill can be
used in conjunction with a con
dom."
While the University will need
to decide whether or not to have
the drug available by prescrip
tion, a variety of resources on
campus will still provide women
with the information they need to
make educated decisions regard
ing the pill.
"It will be interesting to see in
ten years down the road, if the
phenomenon of monthly men
struation is still commonplace,"
Willoughby said.
