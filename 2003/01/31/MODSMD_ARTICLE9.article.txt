bines various types of foods, games and cultural performances in an ef
fort to create the crowded, festive feel ofTaiwanese night markets. Other

students from all sorts of backgrounds to enjoy the food, games and cul
tural activities," said TCS co-chairs Jimmy Lu and Jen Chen. "Our goal
is to educate the Stanford community about the vice-cultural history of
Taiwan through an event that's both fun and informative."

Lane lecture series presents Bidart
On Feb. 3, distinguished American poet Frank Bidart will read from
his poetry, which represents an original voice in the contemporary land
scape of American literature.
Born in Bakersfield in 1939 and educated at UC-Riverside and
Harvard, Bidart is known for such poems as "Desire," "The Sacrifice,"
"The Book of the Body" and "Golden State."
"Frank Bidart's visit brings to campus — thanks to the Lane lecture
series — a poet of extraordinary power and range, said Creative Writing
Program director Eaven Boland. "His poems have an absolutely distinc
tive voice. Poems like 'Ellen West' are contemporary classics, and they
speak with a rare directness and freshness to students and readers right
across the board."
Bidart's reading will take place at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium and
will be followed on the next day by an informal colloquium at 11 a.m. in
the Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks Hall, Bldg. 460.
