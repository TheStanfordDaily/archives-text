"More than twenty years after the ground-breaking anthology This Bridge Called Mv Back called j
upon feminists to envision new forms of communities and practices, Gloria £ Anzaldcea and |
Ana Louise Keating have painstakingly assembled a new collection of over eighty original whtings \
that offers a bold new vision of women-of-color consciousness for the twenty-first century. Written
by women and men - both 'of color' and 'white'-this bridge we call home will challenge readers to
rethink existing categories and invent new individual and collective identities."
