Editorial

When the cook in my house
learned that I would be The
Daily's next editor in chief,
he told me, "That's great —
I've always respected journalists. But
sometimes all they care about is getting
the story, when they should be getting
the truth."
I joined this newspaper four years ago
because I believed then — and continue
to believe now — that responsible jour
nalists carry out one of the highest forms
of public service. As we head into the sec
ond half of the school year, it is time to re
flect on The Daily's commitment to pro
viding insightful, responsible coverage
and to improving our role as a forum for
campus dialogue and sharing viewpoints.
ITie student daily newspaper occupies a
unique place on campus. On one hand, it is
a viable, working press with the same free
doms and goals as newspapers oft'campus.
This year, many

ically, we'll do our best to make sure others
learn about it, too. When we make editori
al decisions and you wonder why, ask. We
do our most meaningful work when we ex
plain how and why we arrived at our choic
es. This means, too, that when we make an
error, you should tell us — we have an obli
gation to set the record

On this auspicious day, I am reminded
of why I continued working so much at
The Daily: I loved the pressure of working
on deadline, the thrill of a great interview
