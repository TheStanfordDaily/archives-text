# 21 AND STILL CLUELESS
## Tall boots, short skirt 
### 
Every girl under 25 secretly
wants to be a badass.
Admit it. There's a quiet,
silky pleasure that comes
from looking in the mirror and see
ing black leather, vamp nail polish,
fishnet stockings and way too much
eyeshadow. As if for one night only,
the world is your oyster.
I have a balisong that likes to
twirl around my fingers. Illegal to
carry, but not illegal to own. Like
the butterfly it's named for, it
opens its wings in celebration of
flight, and its soft snick of metal
on metal makes me smile in satis
faction.
I try not to place too much em
phasis on it. After all, it's only a knife.
If the occasion arose, I probably
wouldn't even know how to use it in
self-defense on the street, but it
makes fora handy letter-opener.
So yeah, I'm basically a big
poser when it comes to cultivat
ing my badass image. I wear the
calf boots, walk the sexy walk, lis
ten to trip-hop, smoke cigarettes.
But take away the fancy trap
pings, and I'm just a big softie on
the inside.
Still, the boots and the skirt can
really pack a punch. The weird
thing about power is, you don't
actually have to have it to have it.
If that makes any sense. Most of
the time, you dor.'t really need to
kick ass, you just need to look like
you could.
So I carry myself like someone
who's packing a deadly weapon,
and people don't mess with me.
Take back the night and all that.
Ladies, you haven't lived until
you've walked the city alone after
dark. Do it while you're still young
and immortal. (Oh, and wear com
fortable shoes.)
It's weird. When was the first
time any of you ladies discovered
that you could make men want

you? (Excuse the heterosexual bias
fora minute here.) Mine was in, of
all places, a Pizza Hut. I was 16
years old. I was waiting tables —
my first paying job — and a cus
tomer asked me fora lap dance.
Jerk. I went into the break room
and cried.
Later on, another customer
who had seen my distress decided
to play the hero. Imagine this 300-

pound black guy
advancing on this
skinny white boy
and saying, "Is
there a problem
here? 'Cause I can
make it my prob
lem." Ugh. Not
exactly how I had
pictured my

knight in shining armor, you
know? And then my hero had the
audacity to ask for digits. Jerk.
Funny that the one moment in
my life when I felt the most vul
nerable has taught me how power
ful I can be. Like it or not, we
women are objectified, vilified,
commodified. We are sexualized,
scrutinized, terrorized, fetishized.
Why not turn it all on its head and
use it to our advantage?
Anna Mae Wong did it in
"Shanghai Express." Lucy Liu
does it today. Why not? Why the
hell not use sex as a tool, use it like
a glittery silver knife to pierce the
hearts of the men who dare to look
at us? Use them, hurt them, before
they can hurt us?
So here I am with my tight lit
tle Asian body, my beady in
scrutable eyes, my wicked-witch
exotic mysterious glorious self.
What's a girl to do? Do I join the
proud tradition of Chinese drag
on ladies in our seductive decep
tion? Do I spread my thighs like
the legs of my balisong to reveal
the cold, unfeeling blade hidden

between?
I can see it now. I can see myself
embracing the trinity of sex,
money, power. I live and breathe
the heterosexual matrix that is
Adam and Eve, that tells me I can
only be one thing or another. It
whispers to me — if I won't be Eve
the Mother, I must be Lilith the
Harlot, who dances with ecstasy in
the fires of Hell.
So what's a girl to do? I will not
submit to the gender binary that
dictates that because I am born
woman, I must bow my head in the
service of man. Then do 1 become
the harlot? Do I forever close the
door to motherhood, to warmth,
to love? Do I wear my short skirt
like a shield, so that no one can
ever hurt me again?
No. I can't do that. I think if I
went around wearing that hard
shell on the outside, it would soak
into my bones like acid and eat me
alive. I don't have to be one thing
or the other; I can be both and nei
ther and all things at once.
On the inside, I am soft and
warm. 1 am bittersweet. I am loving
and giving and wanting and long
ing and desiring and desirable. I
am old enough to know heartbreak
and young enough to want to try
again. I am powerful and weak and
everything in between.
I am summer nights, I am win
ter mornings. I am everything you
ever wanted, I am nothing you
have ever dreamed. I am mother,
daughter, sister, virgin, whore.
I am beautiful and wise.
And I am a badass.

What's a girl to do? Do I join the
proud tradition of Chinese drag
on ladies in our seductive decep
tion? Do I spread my thighs like
the legs of my balisong to reveal
the cold, unfeeling blade hidden

between?
I can see it now. I can see myself
embracing the trinity of sex,
money, power. I live and breathe
the heterosexual matrix that is
Adam and Eve, that tells me I can
only be one thing or another. It
whispers to me — if I won't be Eve
the Mother, I must be Lilith the
Harlot, who dances with ecstasy in
the fires of Hell.
So what's a girl to do? I will not
submit to the gender binary that
dictates that because I am born
woman, I must bow my head in the
service of man. Then do 1 become
the harlot? Do I forever close the
door to motherhood, to warmth,
to love? Do I wear my short skirt
like a shield, so that no one can
ever hurt me again?
No. I can't do that. I think if I
went around wearing that hard
shell on the outside, it would soak
into my bones like acid and eat me
alive. I don't have to be one thing
or the other; I can be both and nei
ther and all things at once.
On the inside, I am soft and
warm. 1 am bittersweet. I am loving
and giving and wanting and long
ing and desiring and desirable. I
am old enough to know heartbreak
and young enough to want to try
again. I am powerful and weak and
everything in between.
I am summer nights, I am win
ter mornings. I am everything you
ever wanted, I am nothing you
have ever dreamed. I am mother,
daughter, sister, virgin, whore.
I am beautiful and wise.
And I am a badass.

Lillian Ho

Every girl under 25 secretly
wants to be a badass.
Admit it. There's a quiet,
silky pleasure that comes
from looking in the mirror and see
ing black leather, vamp nail polish,
fishnet stockings and way too much
eyeshadow. As if for one night only,
the world is your oyster.
I have a balisong that likes to
twirl around my fingers. Illegal to
carry, but not illegal to own. Like
the butterfly it's named for, it
opens its wings in celebration of
flight, and its soft snick of metal
on metal makes me smile in satis
faction.
I try not to place too much em
phasis on it. After all, it's only a knife.
If the occasion arose, I probably
wouldn't even know how to use it in
self-defense on the street, but it
makes fora handy letter-opener.
So yeah, I'm basically a big
poser when it comes to cultivat
ing my badass image. I wear the
calf boots, walk the sexy walk, lis
ten to trip-hop, smoke cigarettes.
But take away the fancy trap
pings, and I'm just a big softie on
the inside.
Still, the boots and the skirt can
really pack a punch. The weird
thing about power is, you don't
actually have to have it to have it.
If that makes any sense. Most of
the time, you dor.'t really need to
kick ass, you just need to look like
you could.
So I carry myself like someone
who's packing a deadly weapon,
and people don't mess with me.
Take back the night and all that.
Ladies, you haven't lived until
you've walked the city alone after
dark. Do it while you're still young
and immortal. (Oh, and wear com
fortable shoes.)
It's weird. When was the first
time any of you ladies discovered
that you could make men want

you? (Excuse the heterosexual bias
fora minute here.) Mine was in, of
all places, a Pizza Hut. I was 16
years old. I was waiting tables —
my first paying job — and a cus
tomer asked me fora lap dance.
Jerk. I went into the break room
and cried.
Later on, another customer
who had seen my distress decided
to play the hero. Imagine this 300-

pound black guy
advancing on this
skinny white boy
and saying, "Is
there a problem
here? 'Cause I can
make it my prob
lem." Ugh. Not
exactly how I had
pictured my

knight in shining armor, you
know? And then my hero had the
audacity to ask for digits. Jerk.
Funny that the one moment in
my life when I felt the most vul
nerable has taught me how power
ful I can be. Like it or not, we
women are objectified, vilified,
commodified. We are sexualized,
scrutinized, terrorized, fetishized.
Why not turn it all on its head and
use it to our advantage?
Anna Mae Wong did it in
"Shanghai Express." Lucy Liu
does it today. Why not? Why the
hell not use sex as a tool, use it like
a glittery silver knife to pierce the
hearts of the men who dare to look
at us? Use them, hurt them, before
they can hurt us?
So here I am with my tight lit
tle Asian body, my beady in
scrutable eyes, my wicked-witch
exotic mysterious glorious self.
What's a girl to do? Do I join the
proud tradition of Chinese drag
on ladies in our seductive decep
tion? Do I spread my thighs like
the legs of my balisong to reveal
the cold, unfeeling blade hidden

between?
