Clarifying Bush's economic plan
There has been a lot of confusion lately
regarding the dividend tax cut. The Stan
ford Daily editorial, "Students should rec
ognize flaws in Bush's plans," (Jan. 30) as
serts that 95 percent of the tax cut would go
into "the pocketbooks of the wealthiest 1
percent of Americans" and then makes the
flippant remark that this money would go
into "off shore accounts." This characteriza
tion could not be further from the truth.
Now, this mistake should be forgiven.
Even this week's issue of Time magazine
makes the same boldly incorrect asser
tions. However, some clarification needs
to be made.
An important question in public fi
nance is the question of tax incidence. In
other words, who actually pays the tax?
Consider the expected response to the tax
cut. Companies will realize that they can
reduce the amount of dividends they pay
out, allowing them to reinvest more of
their profits. Alternatively, if the level of
dividends stays the same, which makes the
stocks more attractive, more people invest
and, again, capital stock increases.
In both cases, the cost of capital is re

duced. Far from going to offshore ac
counts, the money will largely go into
America's lackluster capital markets,
spurring investment and resulting in long
term growth, higher productivity, lower
cost goods, greater job creation and all
sorts of good things.
Admittedly, benefits also accrue to the
owners of capital, increasing income in
equality. But many economists have made
their careers demonstrating that capital is
taxed at too high a rate and that inequali
ty can more efficiently be addressed
through other means. (By efficiency, we
are referring to the fact that most any tax
leads to some dead weight loss to society,
and thus we would like to minimize this
loss. Many papers have argued that each
dollar collected from corporate taxation
leads to twice as much loss as a dollar col
lected by income taxation.)
Both Time and The Daily advocate
tax cuts for the poor, even though under
the Bush plan, the poor (those with kids
anyway) will hardly pay any income tax
at all. Thus the cuts can only come from
the Social Security tax. This may be a
good idea, but then this totally destroys
any notion that Social Security is some
kind of savings plan, where individuals
take personal responsibility for their re
tirement.
A lot of the confusion comes from the

old-fashioned Keynesian idea that the
proper medicine to economic slowdown is
tax cuts and government spending, which
may work but not well. Fiscal policy is a
lumbering beast and not very effective at
responding to cyclical downturns. The key
benefit of tax reform is the impact it has on
behavior, on how much people work, on
how people invest and on how firms utilize
their money — and the long-term conse
quences of such changes. Admittedly, the
Bush administration's rhetoric has not
done a good job at making clear this dis
tinction, but from my time spent in the
Clinton White House (does that sound im
pressive or what? OK, so I was an intern) I
realize that political rhetoric never does.
It should also be noted that the divi
dend tax cut also reduces the distortion
that causes corporations to favor debt over
equity. It also eliminates the tax advantage
of stock buybacks, encouraging more
firms to offer dividends and ultimately
leads to more honest accounting.
Given all this information, can I say thai
the elimination of the dividend tax cut is
definitively a good idea? Of course not.
What I can say for certain, however, is that
much of the rhetoric surrounding the tax
cut has largely been uninformed.

Club sports caption
lacks information
I am writing to express my disappoint
ment in the caption of the sports photo
that ran on the front page of The Stanford
Daily on Jan. 30. The caption read: "A
Stanford women's rugby player tries to
make a break for it during a recent game."
I was the player in the photo, the game
took place on Saturday, Jan. 25, against
University of Nevada-Reno, and Stanford
won 103-0 — but none of this information
was included in the caption. In contrast,
the women's basketball photo that ap
peared in the Cardinal Today section on
the same day had the caption, "T'nae
Thiel and the No. 6 Cardinal women's bas
ketball team put on a show for the home
crowd at Maples Pavilion as it dismantled
cross-Bay rival California, 72-48."
I'm not sure why The Daily felt such de
tailed information was unnecessary in the
rugby photo, but, unfortunately, it seems
to reflect a difference in attitude toward
club sports and varsity sports. Club sports
may not have the fan base, ticket sales or
prestige of varsity sports. But we work very
hard to represent Stanford as best we can
in our athletic communities, and we are in
credibly proud to wear the Cardinal jer
sey. I'm not saying that we deserve equal

coverage in The Daily but if you're going
to do it, at least do it right.
I'm also surprised that that caption ran
because, to be honest, it's pretty lame. If
The Daily had worked a little harder to
find the background information, per
haps there would have been a better cap
tion than what amounted to "anonymous
woman runs down anonymous field with
anonymous ball."

I'm also surprised that that caption ran

Clarifying Bush's economic plan
There has been a lot of confusion lately
regarding the dividend tax cut. The Stan
ford Daily editorial, "Students should rec
ognize flaws in Bush's plans," (Jan. 30) as
serts that 95 percent of the tax cut would go
into "the pocketbooks of the wealthiest 1
percent of Americans" and then makes the
flippant remark that this money would go
into "off shore accounts." This characteriza
tion could not be further from the truth.
Now, this mistake should be forgiven.
Even this week's issue of Time magazine
makes the same boldly incorrect asser
tions. However, some clarification needs
to be made.
An important question in public fi
nance is the question of tax incidence. In
other words, who actually pays the tax?
Consider the expected response to the tax
cut. Companies will realize that they can
reduce the amount of dividends they pay
out, allowing them to reinvest more of
their profits. Alternatively, if the level of
dividends stays the same, which makes the
stocks more attractive, more people invest
and, again, capital stock increases.
In both cases, the cost of capital is re

duced. Far from going to offshore ac
counts, the money will largely go into
America's lackluster capital markets,
spurring investment and resulting in long
term growth, higher productivity, lower
cost goods, greater job creation and all
sorts of good things.
Admittedly, benefits also accrue to the
owners of capital, increasing income in
equality. But many economists have made
their careers demonstrating that capital is
taxed at too high a rate and that inequali
ty can more efficiently be addressed
through other means. (By efficiency, we
are referring to the fact that most any tax
leads to some dead weight loss to society,
and thus we would like to minimize this
loss. Many papers have argued that each
dollar collected from corporate taxation
leads to twice as much loss as a dollar col
lected by income taxation.)
Both Time and The Daily advocate
tax cuts for the poor, even though under
the Bush plan, the poor (those with kids
anyway) will hardly pay any income tax
at all. Thus the cuts can only come from
the Social Security tax. This may be a
good idea, but then this totally destroys
any notion that Social Security is some
kind of savings plan, where individuals
take personal responsibility for their re
tirement.
A lot of the confusion comes from the

old-fashioned Keynesian idea that the
proper medicine to economic slowdown is
tax cuts and government spending, which
may work but not well. Fiscal policy is a
lumbering beast and not very effective at
responding to cyclical downturns. The key
benefit of tax reform is the impact it has on
behavior, on how much people work, on
how people invest and on how firms utilize
their money — and the long-term conse
quences of such changes. Admittedly, the
Bush administration's rhetoric has not
done a good job at making clear this dis
tinction, but from my time spent in the
Clinton White House (does that sound im
pressive or what? OK, so I was an intern) I
realize that political rhetoric never does.
It should also be noted that the divi
dend tax cut also reduces the distortion
that causes corporations to favor debt over
equity. It also eliminates the tax advantage
of stock buybacks, encouraging more
firms to offer dividends and ultimately
leads to more honest accounting.
Given all this information, can I say thai
the elimination of the dividend tax cut is
definitively a good idea? Of course not.
What I can say for certain, however, is that
much of the rhetoric surrounding the tax
cut has largely been uninformed.

Club sports caption
lacks information
I am writing to express my disappoint
ment in the caption of the sports photo
that ran on the front page of The Stanford
Daily on Jan. 30. The caption read: "A
Stanford women's rugby player tries to
make a break for it during a recent game."
I was the player in the photo, the game
took place on Saturday, Jan. 25, against
University of Nevada-Reno, and Stanford
won 103-0 — but none of this information
was included in the caption. In contrast,
the women's basketball photo that ap
peared in the Cardinal Today section on
the same day had the caption, "T'nae
Thiel and the No. 6 Cardinal women's bas
ketball team put on a show for the home
crowd at Maples Pavilion as it dismantled
cross-Bay rival California, 72-48."
I'm not sure why The Daily felt such de
tailed information was unnecessary in the
rugby photo, but, unfortunately, it seems
to reflect a difference in attitude toward
club sports and varsity sports. Club sports
may not have the fan base, ticket sales or
prestige of varsity sports. But we work very
hard to represent Stanford as best we can
in our athletic communities, and we are in
credibly proud to wear the Cardinal jer
sey. I'm not saying that we deserve equal

coverage in The Daily but if you're going
to do it, at least do it right.
I'm also surprised that that caption ran
because, to be honest, it's pretty lame. If
The Daily had worked a little harder to
find the background information, per
haps there would have been a better cap
tion than what amounted to "anonymous
woman runs down anonymous field with
anonymous ball."
