## Stanford emerges from desert with 2 victories 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
TEMPE, Az. — Suddenly, the
game that was billed as the under
card matchup of the weekend had
much more important implica
tions. Before Thursday evening, all
of the buzz surrounded the Satur
day afternoon matchup in Tucson,
in which the two undefeated Pacif
ic- 10 Conference teams — Arizona
and California — were to battle for
league supremacy. The thinking
was that the conference would
have just one unbeaten team once
the weekend was over.
Men's Basketball
Saturday: Stanford 58, Arizona State 57
at No. 17 Oregon, Thursday, 5:30 p.m.
But then Thursday happened.
Arizona State (13-7, 5-4 Pac-10)
upset No. 20 California (14-4, 7-2)
and Stanford surprised No. 1 Ari
zona (16-2, 8-1), meaning that no
team would escape the weekend
without a blemish on its confer
ence record.
And when the dust settled,
Stanford (16-5,7-2) emerged from
the desert as the only team to
sweep the weekend after a narrow
58-57 victory over the Sun Devils
on Saturday.
Stanford is now tied for second
place with the Golden Bears and is
just one game behind conference
leader Arizona. And, most impor
tantly for the Cardinal, both the
Wildcats and Cal must face Stan
ford at Maples in what could be an
intriguing Pac-10 regular season
finale if all three teams continue
their winning ways.
Still, Stanford's domination in
the desert seemed anything but
certain early in Saturday's contest.
Coach Mike Montgomery was

forced to call an early timeout after
Arizona State opened with a 10-2
run in the first four minutes of play.
The Sun Devil full-court press,
despite leading to only one Cardi
nal turnover in the first half, suc
ceeded in breaking Stanford out of
its offensive rhythm.
The game quickly became a de
fensive batde, and Montgomery
switched his team from man-to
man into the 1-1-3 zone that has
plagued more than a few oppo
nents this season. The zone did not
cure Stanford's rebounding woes,
but it forced the Sun Devils into
more outside shots, exposing their
ineptitude from behind the arc.
But then again, there wasn't
much scoring going on in the first
half from either squad. Arizona
State shot 26 percent from the
field, while Stanford shot 30 per
cent and went into the locker room
with a 26-24 halftime lead.
The zone effectively keyed in on
the Sun Devils' leading scorer, Ike
Diogu. The constant double-team
ing of the 6-foot-8 freshman led to
the unraveling of an ASU offense
that likes to look inside first.
The zone, however, failed to
keep a hustling Sun Devil team off
of the offensive boards. Arizona
State grabbed nine offensive re
bounds in the first half.
"We defended pretty well,"
Montgomery said. "I? was obvious
ly a low-scoring game. Again, we
just hung around. I thought the
zone really helped us control the
tempo a little bit."
The second half saw more of
the same, as scoring didn't pick up
much for either team. After the
Sun Devils opened the half on a 9-
0 run, led by Diogu, who had six of
those points, Stanford junior

Senior guard Julius Barnes drops the dime from on high in Stanford's home win against USC last
weekend. Foul trouble hampered Barnes against Arizona State on Saturday, but the Cardinal came
away with a gritty one-point win that put it in a second-place tie with rival California in the Pac-10.
