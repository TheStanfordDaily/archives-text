# Baseball suffers 3-game sweep at No. 13 Fullerton
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On an average Sunday, the bus ride from Fuller
ton back to Palo Alto lasts about six hours. Yesterday,
it must have felt like a lifetime for the No. 3 Stanford
baseball team after the Cardinal suffered its first se
ries sweep in nearly six years at the hands of No. 13
Cal State-Fullerton this weekend.

"Cal State-Fullerton just outplayed us in every
phase of the game during this series," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We felt coming into the
series that Fullerton was definitely one of the top 10
teams in the country, and they showed it this week
end."
Stanford (2-3) headed downstate with hopes of
continuing the momentum it garnered in its 2-0 start
but instead returned with a losing record, while the
Titans (3-0), one of the Cardinal's biggest rivals, im
pressed many in the nation's marquee series of the
weekend.
Crucial to all three Fullerton victories were big in
nings set up by Stanford miscues from which the Car
dinal could not recover.
The Titans' first outburst of their young season,
which came during Friday night's 7-3 Fullerton win,
set the tone for the entire series. Locked in a 3-3 bat
tle that began as a matchup between Stanford senior
pitcher John Hudgins and Fullerton junior pitcher
Wes Littleton, Cardinal freshman Matt Manship
took the mound to begin the bottom of the seventh
inning.
He promptly issued two walks and misplayed a
sacrifice bunt, loading the bases for Titan left fielder
Danny Dorn with no outs. Dorn ripped a bases-clear
ing triple to right center, and after Fullerton added
another run on a sacrifice fly, the Titans led 7-3. Stan
ford managed to produce just two more hits in its
final six outs.
On Saturday night, the story
line and the outcome — a 10-2
Stanford loss keyed by a five-run
sixth inning — were strikingly
similar to the series opener.
Cardinal junior lefty Tim Cun
ningham allowed a single to begin
the sixth, but found himself just
one out away from ending the
threat without any damage after
two consecutive strikeouts. How
ever, a balk and a steal had put the
Titan leadoff man at third, and
Cunningham's second wild pitch
of the game gave Fullerton the
lead, 3-1.

Marquess pulled his senior
starter after another single and a

hit batsman, leading to a less
than-memorable collegiate debut
for Cardinal freshman Kodiak
Quick. Quick yielded a single, a
wild pitch and a two-run homer,
and Fullerton grabbed control of
the contest by jumping on Stan
ford's mistakes for the second
straight day, heading into the
seventh up 7-1.
Yesterday in the series fi
nale —an 8-2 drubbing — the
Titan knockout punch came earli
est of the three games with a six
run second inning. Stanford ju
nior second baseman Johnny Ash
committed an error to start the
frame, and after a single and a
walk, Dorn launched Cardinal
starter Ryan McCally's pitch over
the right-field fence and put
Fullerton in front 3-0.

After a groundout, Stanford

saw senior Tobin Swope make an
error at shortstop that led to three
more runs in the inning, giving
Fullerton an early 6-0 lead and
sending the Cardinal to its third
loss of the weekend.
One week after Stanford domi
nated Santa Clara, allowing seven
hits and playing errorless ball in
two games, Fullerton turned the
tables on the Cardinal and opened
its season with a bullying perfor
mance of its own.
In one nightmarish weekend,
Stanford committed eight errors
while its pitchers hit nine Fuller
ton batters, balked three times
and threw three wild pitches. At
the plate, the Cardinal left 23 men
on base in the series and scored
just seven runs despite 26 hits,
breaking one of Marquess's key
talking points: "timely hitting."
Despite the silence the Stan
ford players surely endured dur
ing last night's trip back to cam
pus, the Cardinal did have some
positives on which to fall back
from its weekend in Fullerton.
After beginning the season in an
0-for-14 slump, junior Sam Fuld
had a 3-for-4 day on Saturday
and belted his first homer of the
season yesterday. Also Saturday,
freshman first baseman John
Mayberry, Jr. hit his first colle
giate home run, a game-tying
solo shot to left in the fourth.
Finally, freshman right-hander
Mark Romanczuk relieved McCal
ly in the sixth and pitched the
team's final 2 1/3 innings, allow
ing just one hit and striking out
four, fora successful Stanford
debut.
Though only one game below
.500 early in the season, Stanford
has little time to lick its wounds as
it hosts No. 4 Florida State this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
With games against Fresno State,
fifth-ranked defending national
champion Texas, and No. 6
Southern California all in Febru
ary, the Cardinal must turn
things around quickly against the
Seminoles or find itself in a very
difficult position heading into
conference play.

error at shortstop that led to three
more runs in the inning, giving
Fullerton an early 6-0 lead and
sending the Cardinal to its third
loss of the weekend.
One week after Stanford domi
nated Santa Clara, allowing seven
hits and playing errorless ball in
two games, Fullerton turned the
tables on the Cardinal and opened
its season with a bullying perfor
mance of its own.
In one nightmarish weekend,
Stanford committed eight errors
while its pitchers hit nine Fuller
ton batters, balked three times
and threw three wild pitches. At
the plate, the Cardinal left 23 men
on base in the series and scored
just seven runs despite 26 hits,
breaking one of Marquess's key
talking points: "timely hitting."
Despite the silence the Stan
ford players surely endured dur
ing last night's trip back to cam
pus, the Cardinal did have some
positives on which to fall back
from its weekend in Fullerton.
After beginning the season in an
0-for-14 slump, junior Sam Fuld
had a 3-for-4 day on Saturday
and belted his first homer of the
season yesterday. Also Saturday,
freshman first baseman John
Mayberry, Jr. hit his first colle
giate home run, a game-tying
solo shot to left in the fourth.
Finally, freshman right-hander
Mark Romanczuk relieved McCal
ly in the sixth and pitched the
team's final 2 1/3 innings, allow
ing just one hit and striking out
four, fora successful Stanford
debut.
Though only one game below
.500 early in the season, Stanford
has little time to lick its wounds as
it hosts No. 4 Florida State this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
With games against Fresno State,
fifth-ranked defending national
champion Texas, and No. 6
Southern California all in Febru
ary, the Cardinal must turn
things around quickly against the
Seminoles or find itself in a very
difficult position heading into
conference play.

Junior second baseman Johnny Ash and the rest of the Cardinal weren't
laughing at the comedy of errors that contributed to three consecutive defeats
at the hands of underdog Cal State-Fullerton over the weekend.
On an average Sunday, the bus ride from Fuller
ton back to Palo Alto lasts about six hours. Yesterday,
it must have felt like a lifetime for the No. 3 Stanford
baseball team after the Cardinal suffered its first se
ries sweep in nearly six years at the hands of No. 13
Cal State-Fullerton this weekend.

■
Friday: No. 13 Cal State-Fullerton 7, No. 3 Stanford 3
Saturday: No. 13 Cal State-Fullerton 10, No. 3 Stanford 2
Sunday: No. 13 Cal State-Fullerton 8, No. 3 Stanford 2
"Cal State-Fullerton just outplayed us in every
phase of the game during this series," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We felt coming into the
series that Fullerton was definitely one of the top 10
teams in the country, and they showed it this week
end."
Stanford (2-3) headed downstate with hopes of
continuing the momentum it garnered in its 2-0 start
but instead returned with a losing record, while the
Titans (3-0), one of the Cardinal's biggest rivals, im
pressed many in the nation's marquee series of the
weekend.
Crucial to all three Fullerton victories were big in
nings set up by Stanford miscues from which the Car
dinal could not recover.
The Titans' first outburst of their young season,
which came during Friday night's 7-3 Fullerton win,
set the tone for the entire series. Locked in a 3-3 bat
tle that began as a matchup between Stanford senior
pitcher John Hudgins and Fullerton junior pitcher
Wes Littleton, Cardinal freshman Matt Manship
took the mound to begin the bottom of the seventh
inning.
He promptly issued two walks and misplayed a
sacrifice bunt, loading the bases for Titan left fielder
Danny Dorn with no outs. Dorn ripped a bases-clear
ing triple to right center, and after Fullerton added
another run on a sacrifice fly, the Titans led 7-3. Stan
ford managed to produce just two more hits in its
final six outs.
On Saturday night, the story
line and the outcome — a 10-2
Stanford loss keyed by a five-run
sixth inning — were strikingly
similar to the series opener.
Cardinal junior lefty Tim Cun
ningham allowed a single to begin
the sixth, but found himself just
one out away from ending the
threat without any damage after
two consecutive strikeouts. How
ever, a balk and a steal had put the
Titan leadoff man at third, and
Cunningham's second wild pitch
of the game gave Fullerton the
lead, 3-1.

Marquess pulled his senior
starter after another single and a

hit batsman, leading to a less
than-memorable collegiate debut
for Cardinal freshman Kodiak
Quick. Quick yielded a single, a
wild pitch and a two-run homer,
and Fullerton grabbed control of
the contest by jumping on Stan
ford's mistakes for the second
straight day, heading into the
seventh up 7-1.
Yesterday in the series fi
nale —an 8-2 drubbing — the
Titan knockout punch came earli
est of the three games with a six
run second inning. Stanford ju
nior second baseman Johnny Ash
committed an error to start the
frame, and after a single and a
walk, Dorn launched Cardinal
starter Ryan McCally's pitch over
the right-field fence and put
Fullerton in front 3-0.

saw senior Tobin Swope make an
