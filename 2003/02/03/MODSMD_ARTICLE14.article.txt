On an average Sunday, the bus ride from Fuller
ton back to Palo Alto lasts about six hours. Yesterday,
it must have felt like a lifetime for the No. 3 Stanford
baseball team after the Cardinal suffered its first se
ries sweep in nearly six years at the hands of No. 13
Cal State-Fullerton this weekend.

"Cal State-Fullerton just outplayed us in every
phase of the game during this series," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We felt coming into the
series that Fullerton was definitely one of the top 10
teams in the country, and they showed it this week
end."
Stanford (2-3) headed downstate with hopes of
continuing the momentum it garnered in its 2-0 start
but instead returned with a losing record, while the
Titans (3-0), one of the Cardinal's biggest rivals, im
pressed many in the nation's marquee series of the
weekend.
Crucial to all three Fullerton victories were big in
nings set up by Stanford miscues from which the Car
dinal could not recover.
The Titans' first outburst of their young season,
which came during Friday night's 7-3 Fullerton win,
set the tone for the entire series. Locked in a 3-3 bat
tle that began as a matchup between Stanford senior
pitcher John Hudgins and Fullerton junior pitcher
Wes Littleton, Cardinal freshman Matt Manship
took the mound to begin the bottom of the seventh
inning.
He promptly issued two walks and misplayed a
sacrifice bunt, loading the bases for Titan left fielder
Danny Dorn with no outs. Dorn ripped a bases-clear
ing triple to right center, and after Fullerton added
another run on a sacrifice fly, the Titans led 7-3. Stan
ford managed to produce just two more hits in its
final six outs.
