And so it begins.
This weekend the No. 14 Stanford soft
ball team (1-1) kicked off its season on the
Farm by splitting a double-header with the
No. 21 Pacific Tigers (1 -1).
The twin bill began with a pitcher's duel
between Cardinal senior Tori Nyberg and
Pacific's Jennifer Dacre.
In her first inning back after a breakout
junior year, Nyberg shut down the first
three Tiger batters she faced.
Dacre, however, started out a bit shaky,
loading the bases with three walks before
settling down and ending the inning with
the bases still loaded and no score.
'Hie scoreboard remained blank iÂ»itil the
fourth inning, when the Tigers pounced
first.
Tiger senior Barbara Moody led off the
inning with a single up the middle and
moved over to second on a sacrifice. Anoth
er single to center field, this time by Kristen
Allen, put runners on first and third. An in
field error then allowed Moody to score

from third before the Cardinal turned
around and picked off a Tiger at third base
to end the rally.
Stanford's bats came alive in the bottom
of the inning, when junior catcher Jessica Al
lister drove a single through the right side.
Junior Heather Shook came in to pinch run
for Allister, and she immediately made her
presence felt on the basepaths, stealing sec
ond to put herself in scoring position.
Then senior left fielder Cassi Brangham
stepped into the box and reached first after
being hit by the pitch. Shook and Brangham
advanced to second and third on a sacrifice
and were then joined on the bases by senior
first baseman Maureen LeCocq, who drew a
walk. A fielder's choice resulted in an out at
home, but the Pacific pitching folded tinder
the pressure, walking in two runs and plac
ing the Cardinal ahead 2-1.
