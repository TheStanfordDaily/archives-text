### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
And so it begins.
This weekend the No. 14 Stanford soft
ball team (1-1) kicked off its season on the
Farm by splitting a double-header with the
No. 21 Pacific Tigers (1 -1).
The twin bill began with a pitcher's duel
between Cardinal senior Tori Nyberg and
Pacific's Jennifer Dacre.
In her first inning back after a breakout
junior year, Nyberg shut down the first
three Tiger batters she faced.
Dacre, however, started out a bit shaky,
loading the bases with three walks before
settling down and ending the inning with
the bases still loaded and no score.
'Hie scoreboard remained blank i»itil the
fourth inning, when the Tigers pounced
first.
Tiger senior Barbara Moody led off the
inning with a single up the middle and
moved over to second on a sacrifice. Anoth
er single to center field, this time by Kristen
Allen, put runners on first and third. An in
field error then allowed Moody to score

from third before the Cardinal turned
around and picked off a Tiger at third base
to end the rally.
Stanford's bats came alive in the bottom
of the inning, when junior catcher Jessica Al
lister drove a single through the right side.
Junior Heather Shook came in to pinch run
for Allister, and she immediately made her
presence felt on the basepaths, stealing sec
ond to put herself in scoring position.
Then senior left fielder Cassi Brangham
stepped into the box and reached first after
being hit by the pitch. Shook and Brangham
advanced to second and third on a sacrifice
and were then joined on the bases by senior
first baseman Maureen LeCocq, who drew a
walk. A fielder's choice resulted in an out at
home, but the Pacific pitching folded tinder
the pressure, walking in two runs and plac
ing the Cardinal ahead 2-1.

Stanford rallied on fora 3-1 win in the first game of a doubleheader against the Tigers on Sat
urday, but the Cardinal got trounced 15-2 in the nightcap.
Stanford manufactured another
run in the fifth when senior second
baseman Kira Ching took a walk
before being moved over to second
and then third on a pair of sacrifice
ground balls. With Ching on third,
sophomore Leah Nelson singled
down the third base line, driving in
Ching and posting the third and
final run of the game.
The second contest of the day
was far less competitive. Freshman
pitcher Laura Severson got her first
taste of NCAA Division I softball the
hard way, as the Cardinal fell 15-2.
The Tiger bats were unstop
pable from the beginning, rallying

in the second inning to take a 6-0
lead and finally resting at the end of
five innings having racked up 14
hits.
Stanford was not totally silent,
posting two runs in the loss, one on
an RBI single by LeCocq in the sec
ond and another by Brangham in
the bottom of the fifth.
The Cardinal is looking at the
second game as a learning tool.
"Obviously the weekend didn't
turn out like we expected it to,"
Brangham said. "But 112 think this
shows us how much harder we're
going to need to work at practice in
the next couple of weeks to get to
where we need to be."
With a 65-game season ahead of
it, Stanford softball knows that it
has plenty of time to make up for
this weekend's loss.
