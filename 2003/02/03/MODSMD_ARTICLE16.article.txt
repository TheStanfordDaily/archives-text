# Cardinal nets sloppy win in Cal rematch
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was one of those days that a team goes
through and hopes never to relive. In front
of a hostile crowd at Haas Pavilion on Sat
urday, No. 6 Stanford was fortunate to pull
out a 53-50 win against an inspired Califor
nia squad. Having already annihilated the
Bears 72-48 at Maples Pavilion earlier in
the week, the Cardinal was apparendy
nonchalant about the rematch.

vs. Oregon, Thursday, 7 p.m.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer called
her team's dominant victory over the Bears
on Wednesday a refocusing effort. After
Saturday's sloppy follow-up performance,
it is fair to say that Stanford is back at square
one.
Just as junior Nicole Powell is regaining
her All-American form, the rest of the team
seems tentative — especially on the road.
The Cardinal's last four road games have
been decided by a total of nine points. And
as Stanford's 75-72 loss at USC last week
demonstrated, you can't win every close
game.
"Nicole is an amazing player and it is
easy to sit and watch her," sophomore
TNae Thiel said earlier this week. "But as
amazing as she is, she can't do it by herself,
and we all [have] to step up."
The Cardinal's road woes are particu
larly wonisome given its upcoming con
tests at No. 22 Arizona and No. 25 Wash
ington.
"Our team is in transition," VanDerveer
said. "We are figuring out what we can run.
We didn't execute well offensively, and we
need to rebound better."
Despite coming into the game with the
lOth-best rebounding margin in the nation
(+9), the Cardinal gave up 14 offensive
boards to the Bears.
Given what had happened at Stanford
on Wednesday night, Cal's pre-game intro
duction routine at Haas Pavilion — replete

with dimmed lights, sweeping spotlights
and hyped-up bass — seemed over-the
top and overly optimistic.
But Stanford started the game poorly
and gave Cal a chance to build offensive
momentum. The Bears held the lead for
most of the opening five minutes and never
trailed by more than five points during the
contest. The Cardinal missed easy lay-ups
on offense and gave up wide-open looks on
defense.
An agitated VanDerveer was quick to
bring sophomores Sebnem Kimyacioglu

and Chelsea Trotter off the bench. Trotter
provided a temporary offensive spark with
four quick points, but no one caught fire to
put down the persistent Bears. After play
ing all 11 healthy players in Wednesday's
blowout, VanDerveer used a seven-player
rotation during this game.
Leading 29-28 at the half, the Cardinal
started the second period like it began the
first — carelessly. Cal converted steals into
fast-break lay-ups on Stanford's first two

tential upset slip through their claws.
