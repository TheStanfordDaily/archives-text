### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
I he tough breaks that have character
ized this season continued Friday for the
Stanford wrestling team, as the Cardinal
forfeited at four weight classes in a 35-12
loss at home to Cal Poly. Stanford (3-10, 1-
5 Pacific-10 Conference) enjoyed more
success Saturday at the All Cal Invitation
al, an all-day tournament hosted by San
Francisco State.
Wrestung
â€” Friday: Cal Poly 35, Stanford 12
Fourteen wrestlers competed for Stan
ford on Saturday, as junior Nathan Peter
son and sophomore Matt Gentry each fin
ished second at 125 and 149, respectively.
Senior Harold Penson captured a third
place finish at 174, and redshirt freshman
Larry Ozowara finished fourth at 197.
Injuries and academic commitments
accounted for the inability of Cardinal
wrestlers at 133, 149, 157 and 197 pounds
to make weight for the Cal Poly meet by
the 10 a.m. weigh-in on Friday.
Despite the distraction, two of the five
Stanford wrestlers who actually took to the
mat tallied wins, including a 7-1 decision
by Penson to open the abbreviated meet.

Penson, a team captain, jumped out to
a 4-1 lead after one period and never
looked back, controlling the bout against
the Mustangs' Brett Schuman for the re
maining five minutes.
"The win felt easy in spite of what the
team was going through," Penson said.
The decision, Penson's 11th win of the
season, gave Stanford a short-lived 4-0
lead in the team score before Cal Poly's
Ryan Halsey recorded a technical fall
against Stanford's Mark Egesdal at 184.
Egesdal, a Hawaii state champion in high
school, was making his second consecutive
appearance in the starting lineup after
seeing limited time in the early part of the
season.
Following a Stanford forfeit at 197,
freshman Shawn Ritzenthaler dropped a
7-0 decision to Cal Poly's Dan Howe.
Peterson won by forfeit at 125 to bring
the team score to 16-10, but with three of the
next five bouts already determined by for
feit, victory was out of reach for Stanford.
That didn't stop junior Brendon Fox
from putting together a strong perfor
mance at 141 against Jeff Owens. Fox
recorded a takedown and a near fall less
than one minute into the bout fora 5-0
lead. The lead would diminish to 5-3
heading into the third period, when
Owens used two takedowns to seize a 7-6
advantage.

The two eventually went to overtime
knotted at 7-7, and Fox ended the bout
with an escape for an 8-7 decision.
"There was a lot of drama surrounding
the dual," Fox said. "It was nice to put that
out of the way and have a good match."
Two forfeits later, Stanford junior Gar
rett Johnston concluded the night with a
batde against Keith Kroeger at 165. A
point for stalling paved the way for
Kroeger to pick up the 4-3 decision for Cal
Poly.
"The guys who were able to go tonight
did a great job," said Stanford head coach
Steve Buddie after the meet. "Everyone
did a great job in practice this week, and
we responded very well to a tough loss last
weekend. And they responded well as a
team after the things presented to them
today."
In addition to putting more wrestlers
on the mat on Saturday, the Cardinal also
managed its fair share of wins.
Peterson defeated Cal Poly's Joel Mit
tleman 10-8 before falling to San Francis
co State's Joey Bareng 5-2 in the finals at
125.
Gentry rode a major decision over Cal
State-Bakersfield's Brian Cobb and a 7-3
decision over Menlo College's Tony Mar
tinez into the final at 157. Fresno State's
Jim Mederios eventually dropped Stan
ford's win-leader 12-4 to claim the title.

Penson, who took home fifth-place
honors at the Aggie Open, placed third on
Saturday with a 4-1 record. After losing to
Bakersfield's Matthew Montiero in his sec
ond bout of the day, Penson scored a 6-3
decision and a pin against other oppo
nents before earning a major decision in a
rematch with Montiero in the third-place

bout.
Ozowara garnered the first top-five fin
ish of his young collegiate career by tally
ing three wins, including a 6-4 overtime
thriller to propel him into the third-place
match at 197.

Failure to make weight in four classes doomed Stanford to a loss at home against Cal Poly
on Friday, but solid performances by Matt Gentry, Nathan Peterson and Harold Penson high
lighted a more encouraging performance at Saturday's All Cal Invitational.
