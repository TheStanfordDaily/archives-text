# Injuries can't slow Cardinal in SoCal
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A combination of injury and fa
tigue could not stand in the way of
a successful trip to Southern Cali
fornia for the men's volleyball team.
Men's Volleyball
Friday: Stanford 3, Cal State-North ridge 1
Saturday: Stanford 3, UC-Santa Barbara 2
Tenth-ranked Stanford defeat
ed No. 8 Cal State-Northridge (6-4,
2-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) on Friday night and No. 12
UC-Santa Barbara (3-7, 1-4 MPSF)
on Saturday in two must-win con
ference matches.
The aforementioned injury and
fatigue required significant bench
production from the Cardinal (5-5,
3-3).
"Basically, our entire team was
feeling sore," said head coach Don
Shaw. "About half our guys had
something more than just a typical
sore muscle. Whether it was just
some kind of binising or a sprained
ankle, it seemed like everyone was
bothered by something."
Most notably, senior first-team
All-American Curt Toppel was
bothered by an abdominal strain
and a thumb fracture.
"Obviously Curt was not at his
best," Shaw said. "But I was so
pleased with the way some of the
other guys came through.
Senior middle blocker Paul
Bocage recorded 15 kills on Friday
and 13 on Saturday.
"Paul had two really huge per
formances," Shaw said. "Especially
in the Northridge match, it seemed
that he was right there whenever
we needed him."
Bocage did not make a single
error in Friday's match, finishing
with a .789 hitting percentage, the
lOth-highest single match perfor
mance in Stanford's history.
Bocage's clean play helped pull
out very tight games in Friday's
match. The Cardinal finished with
a 3-1 (30-28, 31-29, 27-30, 30-28)
win.
"There weren't really any big

momentum swings throughout the
match," Shaw said. "We just made
plays at the end of the match, which
is something we weren't doing ear
lier in the season. I think the guys
are gaining a lot of confidence after
wins like that."
The Matadors stayed with the
Cardinal throughout the match be
hind the play of senior middle
blocker Joe Nargi, who finished
with a match-high 28 kills.
"CSUN saw some great individ
ual play," Shaw said. "But it just
seems like we have their number. At
the end of games, we get the feeling
that we are just going to pull it out,
while it seems that they lose a little
confidence."
After leaving Northridge with a
hard-fought victory, the Cardinal
arrived in Santa Barbara for what
proved to be a wild match.
"On Saturday, the refs really lost
control of the match at the outset,"
Shaw said. "It was like a three-ring
circus out there. We just couldn't
tell what calls they were making, but
I think you can get an idea of that
just by looking at the score."
The match featured particularly
long first and second games. The
Cardinal pulled out the second of
these games and eventually won
the match 3-2 (32-34, 37-35,25-30,
30-21,15-8).
"After the shock of the first two

games, we came out really flat in the
third," Shaw said. "We got way be
hind really fast, and without the
side-out scoring system, it's almost
impossible to come back from that
kind of a deficit, so I let some guys
get some rest."
For the remainder of the game,
Stanford played with an alternate
lineup. Craig Buell, Ben Reddy
and Pat Bomhack came in for
Kevin Hansen, Will Curtis and Paul
Bocage, giving the three starters
some rest.
While the Cardinal still lost the
game, the play of the second lineup
caused a momentum swing in the
Cardinal's favor.
In game four, Stanford used yet
another lineup, one which it had
success with in Hawaii.
"This lineup is based on the pos
sibility that Toppel might have to
come out," Shaw said. "It is a small
er lineup: our usual starters are in,
except that Will Curtis comes out,
David Vogel is moved to outside
hitter and Jeremy Jacobs comes off
the bench as libero."
In addition, Bomhack remained
in as setter in place of Hansen.
"Kevin wasn't really having a
bad day," Shaw said. "He wasn't
playing his best, and Bomhack was
having a great outing."

Stanford men's volleyball team dig out a pair of wins against Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara on Friday and Saturday.
After this final lineup change, the
Cardinal caught fire and crushed
UCSB in the last two games to come
away with the victory.
"1 was very happy with the way

team effort of the season."

Saturday: Stanford 3, UC-Santa Barbara 2
Tenth-ranked Stanford defeat
ed No. 8 Cal State-Northridge (6-4,
2-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) on Friday night and No. 12
UC-Santa Barbara (3-7, 1-4 MPSF)
on Saturday in two must-win con
ference matches.
The aforementioned injury and
fatigue required significant bench
production from the Cardinal (5-5,
3-3).
"Basically, our entire team was
feeling sore," said head coach Don
Shaw. "About half our guys had
something more than just a typical
sore muscle. Whether it was just
some kind of binising or a sprained
ankle, it seemed like everyone was
bothered by something."
Most notably, senior first-team
All-American Curt Toppel was
bothered by an abdominal strain
and a thumb fracture.
"Obviously Curt was not at his
best," Shaw said. "But I was so
pleased with the way some of the
other guys came through.
Senior middle blocker Paul
Bocage recorded 15 kills on Friday
and 13 on Saturday.
"Paul had two really huge per
formances," Shaw said. "Especially
in the Northridge match, it seemed
that he was right there whenever
we needed him."
Bocage did not make a single
error in Friday's match, finishing
with a .789 hitting percentage, the
lOth-highest single match perfor
mance in Stanford's history.
Bocage's clean play helped pull
out very tight games in Friday's
match. The Cardinal finished with
a 3-1 (30-28, 31-29, 27-30, 30-28)
win.
"There weren't really any big

momentum swings throughout the
match," Shaw said. "We just made
plays at the end of the match, which
is something we weren't doing ear
lier in the season. I think the guys
are gaining a lot of confidence after
wins like that."
The Matadors stayed with the
Cardinal throughout the match be
hind the play of senior middle
blocker Joe Nargi, who finished
with a match-high 28 kills.
"CSUN saw some great individ
ual play," Shaw said. "But it just
seems like we have their number. At
the end of games, we get the feeling
that we are just going to pull it out,
while it seems that they lose a little
confidence."
After leaving Northridge with a
hard-fought victory, the Cardinal
arrived in Santa Barbara for what
proved to be a wild match.
"On Saturday, the refs really lost
control of the match at the outset,"
Shaw said. "It was like a three-ring
circus out there. We just couldn't
tell what calls they were making, but
I think you can get an idea of that
just by looking at the score."
The match featured particularly
long first and second games. The
Cardinal pulled out the second of
these games and eventually won
the match 3-2 (32-34, 37-35,25-30,
30-21,15-8).
"After the shock of the first two

games, we came out really flat in the
third," Shaw said. "We got way be
hind really fast, and without the
side-out scoring system, it's almost
impossible to come back from that
kind of a deficit, so I let some guys
get some rest."
For the remainder of the game,
Stanford played with an alternate
lineup. Craig Buell, Ben Reddy
and Pat Bomhack came in for
Kevin Hansen, Will Curtis and Paul
Bocage, giving the three starters
some rest.
While the Cardinal still lost the
game, the play of the second lineup
caused a momentum swing in the
Cardinal's favor.
In game four, Stanford used yet
another lineup, one which it had
success with in Hawaii.
"This lineup is based on the pos
sibility that Toppel might have to
come out," Shaw said. "It is a small
er lineup: our usual starters are in,
except that Will Curtis comes out,
David Vogel is moved to outside
hitter and Jeremy Jacobs comes off
the bench as libero."
In addition, Bomhack remained
in as setter in place of Hansen.
"Kevin wasn't really having a
bad day," Shaw said. "He wasn't
playing his best, and Bomhack was
having a great outing."

Senior outside hitter William Strickland helped the injury-riddled No. 10
Stanford men's volleyball team dig out a pair of wins against Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara on Friday and Saturday.
After this final lineup change, the
Cardinal caught fire and crushed
UCSB in the last two games to come
away with the victory.
"1 was very happy with the way
we finished in Santa Barbara.
Shaw said. "It was by far our best
team effort of the season."
