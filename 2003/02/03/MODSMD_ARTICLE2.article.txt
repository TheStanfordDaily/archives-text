# OSP to close Buenos Aires, Puebla programs
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to a lack of student and faculty in
terest, Overseas Studies is closing its pro
grams in Puebla, Mexico and Buenos
Aires, Argentina at the end of this year.
With the loss of Stanford in Puebla and
Stanford in Buenos Aires, the newest of
OSP's nine current programs, Stanford
in Santiago will be the only remaining
overseas campus in a Spanish-speaking
country.
According to Susan Christopher, aca
demic program officer at Overseas Stud
ies, the two programs have never filled to
capacity. Stanford in Puebla, which

opened in the winter of 1998, can ac
commodate 25 students but is only host
ing six this quarter. Only five or six are
slotted to attend Stanford in Buenos
Aires next quarter, even though the
spring program that opened in 2000 can
hold 15 students.
Christopher said that Stanford in
Puebla and Stanford in Buenos Aires are
built on different models from the rest of
the University's Overseas Studies pro
grams and so may have contributed to the
dearth of student and faculty interest. In
Puebla and Buenos Aires, students would
attend classes at local universities, while
the University's other overseas campuses
follow a more "stand-alone Stanford" ap-

proach where students would take classes
— often taught by regular Stanford facul
ty — with other Stanford students at a
Stanford center.
"The students who have gone [to Mex
ico or Argentina] appreciated that model,"
Christopher said, referring to total im
mersion in a foreign university. "But I
think that has had an impact on the level
of student interest — it certainly has had
an impact on faculty interest."
She added, "I think in the future, we
will think very carefully about any alterna
tive models to ensure that they do elicit
strong support from the faculty as well as
from students."
Both Stanford in Puebla and Stanford

in Buenos Aires have more stringent lan
guage requirements for admission than
most other Stanford campuses, to ensure
that students can handle studying at for
eign universities. Stanford in Puebla re
quires at least one year of college-level
Spanish and two years of courses in eco
nomics or international relations, while
Stanford in Buenos Aires students need
two years of college-level Spanish for
entry.
Senior Andrea Gonzalez, who is from
Mexico and studied at Stanford in Buenos
Aires last spring, said that the more strin
gent language requirements intimidate

some students and deter them
from applying or attending the
program.
"I did hear that people didn't
go because they were afraid they
weren't going to be able to handle
the classes," Gonzalez saic^.
Senior Payal Dalai, who de
scribed language as "a bit of a
barrier" for her when she stud
ied at Stanford in Buenos Aires
last spring, said that being in an
immersion program "exponen
tially increased" her Spanish
abilities.
"I'm really sad that Stanford
has chosen to do away with the im
mersion model," Dalai said. "I
think the Stanford model works,
but I think there are a lot of stu
dents who don't want to keep liv
ing in the Stanford bubble."
She added, "I feel like there are
a lot of kids out there who really
appreciate that model."
Christopher said that the deci
sion to close Stanford in Buenos
Aires was unrelated to violence
that has broken out in parts of Ar
gentina over the last year as it has
weathered an economic crisis.
However, Gonzalez said that the
sudden outbreak of violence in
December 2001 caused students
who planned on attending to
drop out of the program.
"Everything that happened in
Argentina happened in Decem
ber," the time when students ac
cepted to Stanford in Buenos Aires
had to commit to attending, Gon
zalez said. Of 13 students who had
been accepted to Stanford in
Buenos Aires and planned on at
tending in last spring, nine decid
ed not to go.

Christopher said that Stanford
wants to "continue to have a pres
ence in Latin America"and does
not see the closure of the two
campuses as a signal of weaken
ing its support of study in Latin
America. Overseas Studies plans
to put together a focus team of
faculty and students to discuss
new initiatives in Latin America
and is looking to expand the aca
demic and field research oppor
tunities available through Stan
ford in Santiago.
Overseas Studies said that the
interest in Buenos Aires and
Puebla has been so low that closing
campuses there should not over
load demand for the Santiago pro
gram, which enrolls between 50
and 70 students a year.
Nonetheless, students who plan
on studying in Chile now wonder
if admission to Stanford in Santia
go will be more competitive.
"I kind of just assumed that
there'd never be any problem be
cause there were three Spanish
speaking campuses," said sopho
more Dan Van Fleet, who intends to
study at Santiago next winter.
"Now, I see the competition rising."
Christopher stressed that finan
cial considerations were not the
motivating factor behind closing
the two programs, and added that
Stanford is working toward estab
lishing a program in China.
"China is the next location in
which we will be locating a pro
gram," Christopher said, adding
that Overseas Studies Director
Amos Nur just returned from
China where he was working on
the plans for the new campus.
Overseas Studies has not estab
lished a target opening time for
the campus yet, and Christopher
said that Overseas Studies has no
specific plans for campuses in any
other locations right now.
