# OSP to close Buenos Aires, Puebla programs
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Due to a lack of student and faculty in
terest, Overseas Studies is closing its pro
grams in Puebla, Mexico and Buenos
Aires, Argentina at the end of this year.
With the loss of Stanford in Puebla and
Stanford in Buenos Aires, the newest of
OSP's nine current programs, Stanford
in Santiago will be the only remaining
overseas campus in a Spanish-speaking
country.
According to Susan Christopher, aca
demic program officer at Overseas Stud
ies, the two programs have never filled to
capacity. Stanford in Puebla, which

opened in the winter of 1998, can ac
commodate 25 students but is only host
ing six this quarter. Only five or six are
slotted to attend Stanford in Buenos
Aires next quarter, even though the
spring program that opened in 2000 can
hold 15 students.
Christopher said that Stanford in
Puebla and Stanford in Buenos Aires are
built on different models from the rest of
the University's Overseas Studies pro
grams and so may have contributed to the
dearth of student and faculty interest. In
Puebla and Buenos Aires, students would
attend classes at local universities, while
the University's other overseas campuses
follow a more "stand-alone Stanford" ap-

proach where students would take classes
— often taught by regular Stanford facul
ty — with other Stanford students at a
Stanford center.
"The students who have gone [to Mex
ico or Argentina] appreciated that model,"
Christopher said, referring to total im
mersion in a foreign university. "But I
think that has had an impact on the level
of student interest — it certainly has had
an impact on faculty interest."
She added, "I think in the future, we
will think very carefully about any alterna
tive models to ensure that they do elicit
strong support from the faculty as well as
from students."
Both Stanford in Puebla and Stanford

in Buenos Aires have more stringent lan
guage requirements for admission than
most other Stanford campuses, to ensure
that students can handle studying at for
eign universities. Stanford in Puebla re
quires at least one year of college-level
Spanish and two years of courses in eco
nomics or international relations, while
Stanford in Buenos Aires students need
two years of college-level Spanish for
entry.
Senior Andrea Gonzalez, who is from
Mexico and studied at Stanford in Buenos
Aires last spring, said that the more strin
gent language requirements intimidate
