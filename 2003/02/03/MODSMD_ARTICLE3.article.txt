### VINAY JAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thousands of area residents demonstrating against
a potential U.S. war in Iraq tilled the streets of Palo Alto
on Saturday afternoon in a gathering that organizers
described as "the largest peace demonstration ever
seen 011 the San Francisco Peninsula."
About 50 Stanford students walked from Hoover
Tower tojoin the antiwar demonstration, which began
at noon in front of Palo Alto City Hall.
Among the many speakers at City Hall was sopho
more Caroline Picker of the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, who told the crowd that the conser
vative Hoover Institution should disaffiliate with Stan
ford.
"The military-academic complex will not stand,"
she said. "We demand that the link between these
right-wing, hawkish ideas [at the Hoover Institution]
and our university be broken."
History Prof. Joel Beinin attacked U.S. intervention
in Middle East affairs since the Gulf War.
"A democratic country, such as the one the United
States aspires to be, does not need and cannot be an
empire," he said, drawing a positive vocal response
from the crowd.
A spokesperson for Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Ca.) ex
pressed solidarity with the protesters, saying that the
Bush administration's unilateral approach was mis
guided.
The rally drew a large, diverse crowd, despite the
day's blustering winds and the announcement that
singer Joan Baez — who had been given top billing in
the rally's publicity — could not attend due to illness.
The Palo Alto Police Department did not provide
an official count, but a police officer estimated the
crowd, which filled the plaza in front of City Hall, to
number about 4,000. The rally's sponsor, the Palo

Alto-based Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, said
5,000 people attended.
Among the demonstrators was Anne Dochez, a
high school teacher from Los Altos who said she had
been involved the Vietnam-era antiwar movement.
She called that war "a tragedy for our country as well
as theirs."
"I don't want that happening again," she said.
Lena Dekesel, a Belgian who has lived in the Unit
ed States for 18 years, said her friends and family in

Europe are "against the war and Bush, but they don't
believe t hat Americans are opposed to it."
She added, "I cannot vote, but I want to be heard."
Many of the demonstrators bore signs and slogans
that have become familiar in such rallies, including
"Say no to war," and "No blood for oil." But third-year
law student Bryce Giddens waved a Palestinian flag in
stead of a sign.
