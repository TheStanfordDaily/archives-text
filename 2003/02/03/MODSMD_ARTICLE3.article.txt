# Palo Altans rally against Iraq war
## 
### VINAY JAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thousands of area residents demonstrating against
a potential U.S. war in Iraq tilled the streets of Palo Alto
on Saturday afternoon in a gathering that organizers
described as "the largest peace demonstration ever
seen 011 the San Francisco Peninsula."
About 50 Stanford students walked from Hoover
Tower tojoin the antiwar demonstration, which began
at noon in front of Palo Alto City Hall.
Among the many speakers at City Hall was sopho
more Caroline Picker of the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, who told the crowd that the conser
vative Hoover Institution should disaffiliate with Stan
ford.
"The military-academic complex will not stand,"
she said. "We demand that the link between these
right-wing, hawkish ideas [at the Hoover Institution]
and our university be broken."
History Prof. Joel Beinin attacked U.S. intervention
in Middle East affairs since the Gulf War.
"A democratic country, such as the one the United
States aspires to be, does not need and cannot be an
empire," he said, drawing a positive vocal response
from the crowd.
A spokesperson for Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Ca.) ex
pressed solidarity with the protesters, saying that the
Bush administration's unilateral approach was mis
guided.
The rally drew a large, diverse crowd, despite the
day's blustering winds and the announcement that
singer Joan Baez — who had been given top billing in
the rally's publicity — could not attend due to illness.
The Palo Alto Police Department did not provide
an official count, but a police officer estimated the
crowd, which filled the plaza in front of City Hall, to
number about 4,000. The rally's sponsor, the Palo

Alto-based Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, said
5,000 people attended.
Among the demonstrators was Anne Dochez, a
high school teacher from Los Altos who said she had
been involved the Vietnam-era antiwar movement.
She called that war "a tragedy for our country as well
as theirs."
"I don't want that happening again," she said.
Lena Dekesel, a Belgian who has lived in the Unit
ed States for 18 years, said her friends and family in

Europe are "against the war and Bush, but they don't
believe t hat Americans are opposed to it."
She added, "I cannot vote, but I want to be heard."
Many of the demonstrators bore signs and slogans
that have become familiar in such rallies, including
"Say no to war," and "No blood for oil." But third-year
law student Bryce Giddens waved a Palestinian flag in
stead of a sign.

When the suburbs hit the streets — more than 50 Stanford students joined with over 4000 other anti-war pro
testers from area communities at Palo Alto's City Hall in what organizers called the largest protest ever on the
Peninsula.
" Bush claims to be in favor of
liberating the Iraqi people from
Saddam Hussein," Giddens said.
"And yet, at the same time, he sup
ports the oppression of Palestini
ans."
The rally began on a somber
note with a moment of silence
held for the seven astronauts who
perished aboard the space shuttle
Columbia earlier in the day. The
protest continued with nearly two
hours of antiwar speeches. Near
the end of that time, protesters

anxious to start the next phase of
the demonstration shouted "Let's
march!" from the rear.
The march, which lasted only
about 20 minutes, began at City
Hall. The crowd followed Ra
mona Street and turned onto Uni
versity Avenue, where some shop
keepers and pedestrians smiled
and waved in support while others
simply watched. After walking two
blocks along University Av
enue — which the police had
blocked to traffic — the crowd
turned on to Waverly Street and
headed along Hamilton Avenue
before returning back to City Hall.
The marchers were orderly
throughout.

"It's so inspiring to see all these
people united," said sophomore
Jonathan Fetter, his voice hoarse
from chanting. As he marched, Fet
ter bore a sign that read "Resist the
State."
Near him marched Palo Alto res
ident John Skinner, a Vietnam vet
eran with a 9-year old son.
"It's encouraging to see so many
people here," he said. "It raises my
spirits."
The march was followed by a
concert in front of City Hall, where
many demonstrators listened and
lingered before dispersing. Among
them was Kelly Kobza, a sixth grade
teacher at J.L. Stanford Middle
School. She stood side by side with

four friends, each wearing a lrame
backpack supporting a large piece
of poster board labeled on each side
with one letter of the phrase "No
War," and on the other side,
"Peace."
Kobza said that her views are un
likely to change, regardless of what
ever arguments the Bush adminis
tration makes.
"I will never be persuaded that
war is the answer," she said, refer
ring to Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell's highly anticipated Feb. 5 effort
to present compelling evidence
against Saddam Hussein to the
U.N. Security Council.
Scanning the plaza, she added,
"This is the crowd I was hoping for."

from the crowd.
A spokesperson for Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Ca.) ex
pressed solidarity with the protesters, saying that the
Bush administration's unilateral approach was mis
guided.
The rally drew a large, diverse crowd, despite the
day's blustering winds and the announcement that
singer Joan Baez — who had been given top billing in
the rally's publicity — could not attend due to illness.
The Palo Alto Police Department did not provide
an official count, but a police officer estimated the
crowd, which filled the plaza in front of City Hall, to
number about 4,000. The rally's sponsor, the Palo

Alto-based Peninsula Peace and Justice Center, said
5,000 people attended.
Among the demonstrators was Anne Dochez, a
high school teacher from Los Altos who said she had
been involved the Vietnam-era antiwar movement.
She called that war "a tragedy for our country as well
as theirs."
"I don't want that happening again," she said.
Lena Dekesel, a Belgian who has lived in the Unit
ed States for 18 years, said her friends and family in

Europe are "against the war and Bush, but they don't
believe t hat Americans are opposed to it."
She added, "I cannot vote, but I want to be heard."
Many of the demonstrators bore signs and slogans
that have become familiar in such rallies, including
"Say no to war," and "No blood for oil." But third-year
law student Bryce Giddens waved a Palestinian flag in
stead of a sign.

When the suburbs hit the streets — more than 50 Stanford students joined with over 4000 other anti-war pro
testers from area communities at Palo Alto's City Hall in what organizers called the largest protest ever on the
Peninsula.
" Bush claims to be in favor of
liberating the Iraqi people from
Saddam Hussein," Giddens said.
"And yet, at the same time, he sup
ports the oppression of Palestini
ans."
The rally began on a somber
note with a moment of silence
held for the seven astronauts who
perished aboard the space shuttle
Columbia earlier in the day. The
protest continued with nearly two
hours of antiwar speeches. Near
the end of that time, protesters

anxious to start the next phase of
the demonstration shouted "Let's
march!" from the rear.
The march, which lasted only
about 20 minutes, began at City
Hall. The crowd followed Ra
mona Street and turned onto Uni
versity Avenue, where some shop
keepers and pedestrians smiled
and waved in support while others
simply watched. After walking two
blocks along University Av
enue — which the police had
blocked to traffic — the crowd
turned on to Waverly Street and
headed along Hamilton Avenue
before returning back to City Hall.
The marchers were orderly
throughout.

"It's so inspiring to see all these
people united," said sophomore
Jonathan Fetter, his voice hoarse
from chanting. As he marched, Fet
ter bore a sign that read "Resist the
State."
Near him marched Palo Alto res
ident John Skinner, a Vietnam vet
eran with a 9-year old son.
"It's encouraging to see so many
people here," he said. "It raises my
spirits."
The march was followed by a
concert in front of City Hall, where
many demonstrators listened and
lingered before dispersing. Among
them was Kelly Kobza, a sixth grade
teacher at J.L. Stanford Middle
School. She stood side by side with

four friends, each wearing a lrame
backpack supporting a large piece
of poster board labeled on each side
with one letter of the phrase "No
War," and on the other side,
"Peace."
Kobza said that her views are un
likely to change, regardless of what
ever arguments the Bush adminis
tration makes.
"I will never be persuaded that
war is the answer," she said, refer
ring to Secretary of State Colin Pow
ell's highly anticipated Feb. 5 effort
to present compelling evidence
against Saddam Hussein to the
U.N. Security Council.
Scanning the plaza, she added,
"This is the crowd I was hoping for."
