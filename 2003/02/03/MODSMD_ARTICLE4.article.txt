# Tragedy elicits mild response from campus
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford students reacted in quiet shock to news of
the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia and
the loss of its seven crew members on Saturday. Nu
merous students tuned into CNN that day, but by
Sunday many televisions were off despite the constant
coverage of the tragedy.
Students — some of whom barely noticed the
shuttle crash — agreed that while the event saturat
ed newspapers, it didn't affect Stanford students that
much.
"I didn't notice much reaction on campus," said ju
nior Nick Chan. "People don't tend to hear the news
that much. I think the impact off campus was a lot
more than on campus."
Others said that, fora student body that gained
political consciousness after Star Wars in the '80s, the
tragedy did not resonate as much as it did with earli
er generations.
"Some people thought it was no more tragic than
other people who die on jobs that are risky," said
sophomore Tom Hennessy.
Some faculty and students have more personal
connections to the shuttle, including Aeronautics and
Astronautics Prof. Emeritus Holt Ashley, who worked
on a committee that reviewed thermal insulation and
testing in 1981 before the first launch of Columbia,
and Management Science and Engineering Prof. M.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, who did a risk analysis study of
the insulation tiles on the shuttle.
"It was terrible," Ashley said. "I remember die
Challenger and Apollo 13."
