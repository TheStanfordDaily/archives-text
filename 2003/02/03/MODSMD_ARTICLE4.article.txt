# Tragedy elicits mild response from campus
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford students reacted in quiet shock to news of
the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia and
the loss of its seven crew members on Saturday. Nu
merous students tuned into CNN that day, but by
Sunday many televisions were off despite the constant
coverage of the tragedy.
Students — some of whom barely noticed the
shuttle crash — agreed that while the event saturat
ed newspapers, it didn't affect Stanford students that
much.
"I didn't notice much reaction on campus," said ju
nior Nick Chan. "People don't tend to hear the news
that much. I think the impact off campus was a lot
more than on campus."
Others said that, fora student body that gained
political consciousness after Star Wars in the '80s, the
tragedy did not resonate as much as it did with earli
er generations.
"Some people thought it was no more tragic than
other people who die on jobs that are risky," said
sophomore Tom Hennessy.
Some faculty and students have more personal
connections to the shuttle, including Aeronautics and
Astronautics Prof. Emeritus Holt Ashley, who worked
on a committee that reviewed thermal insulation and
testing in 1981 before the first launch of Columbia,
and Management Science and Engineering Prof. M.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, who did a risk analysis study of
the insulation tiles on the shuttle.
"It was terrible," Ashley said. "I remember die
Challenger and Apollo 13."
Pate-Cornell added, "I felt very
sad for the astronauts and their fam
ilies. I wondered how many were
married and had children."
Senior Paul Haynes, who has
aspired to be an astronaut fora
long time, said that this reminds
everyone of the risks associated
with space travel.
"It brought home the realities of
the dangers of space flight," he said.
Students and experts agreed
with President George Bush, who
noted the risks that astronauts face
in an address on Saturday.
"These astronauts knew the dan
gers, and they faced them willingly,
knowing they had a high and noble
purpose in life," Bush said. "Be
cause of their courage and daring
and idealism, we will miss them all
the more."
An investigation is ongoing
and the preliminary focus has
been on insulation tiles being dis

lodged on launch.
"So far NASA has been very thor
ough," said Brian Cantwell, associ
ate chair of the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department. "I'm very
impressed by how much informa
tion they have released."
Experts at Stanford speculated
that a failure with the insulation tiles
is a definite possibility.
"[The tiles] are designed with
great care but rather close toler
ances," Ashley said. "If for some
reason one was damaged where
heat transfer occurs, the tempera
tures are very, very high and
there's the possibility of tempera
tures high enough to melt the alu
minum of the shuttle.
"Everything in engineering is
probabilistic," he continued.
"There's always a probability some
thing could go wrong or fail."
Pate-Cornell noted that her risk
analysis in 1990 concluded that the
heat shield presents a risk in the
order of ten percent of the total risk
of catastrophic failure on die shut
tie. Within the tiles, over 85 percent
of the risk came from a critical 15
percent of them.

"The risk analysis is not well
known, but that's because it is
rather soft in some cases," she said.
"[Still,] the astronauts who flew
knew the risk."
It remains early to guess the
repercussions, but experts expected
that the shuttle program would be
stalled, but not for as long as after
the Challenger disaster.
"I do not expect the space pro
gram to come to a grinding halt, at
least [not] right now because they
have men up there," Pate-Cornell
said, referring to the International
Space Station which NASA had
planned to expand with five shuttle
flights this year. These flights are
now halted indefinitely.
Experts and students agreed
that while this disaster was a wake
up call for the space program and
the public, it did not and should
not mean an end to the manned
space program.
"The first and most important
reason for continuing the manned
space program is that it's good for
the American public and the public
likes it," Ashley said.
Cantwell said that manned space

flight is important not only for its
technological spin-offs and the abili
ty to do unique experiments in
space, but also as an investment for
the future.
"In the long run, human beings
will populate and move into space,"
he said.
President Bush has agreed that
manned space flight was important.
On Sunday, an administration offi
cial said that Bush's new budget
would include a $500 million in
crease in NASA's budget.
"Mankind is led into the dark
ness beyond our world by the in
spiration of discovery and the long
ing to understand." Bush said on
Saturday. "Our journey into space
will go on."
Professors saw the crash as hav
ing little impact on Stanford.
Cantwell noted that there are small
satellite programs being worked at
Stanford that had hoped to use
shuttles to get into space, but there
are other avenues for launching
satellites into orbit.
Still, psychologically, the tragedy
will have many repercussions, they
said.

Students — some of whom barely noticed the
shuttle crash — agreed that while the event saturat
ed newspapers, it didn't affect Stanford students that
much.
"I didn't notice much reaction on campus," said ju
nior Nick Chan. "People don't tend to hear the news
that much. I think the impact off campus was a lot
more than on campus."
Others said that, fora student body that gained
political consciousness after Star Wars in the '80s, the
tragedy did not resonate as much as it did with earli
er generations.
"Some people thought it was no more tragic than
other people who die on jobs that are risky," said
sophomore Tom Hennessy.
Some faculty and students have more personal
connections to the shuttle, including Aeronautics and
Astronautics Prof. Emeritus Holt Ashley, who worked
on a committee that reviewed thermal insulation and
testing in 1981 before the first launch of Columbia,
and Management Science and Engineering Prof. M.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, who did a risk analysis study of
the insulation tiles on the shuttle.
"It was terrible," Ashley said. "I remember die
Challenger and Apollo 13."
Pate-Cornell added, "I felt very
sad for the astronauts and their fam
ilies. I wondered how many were
married and had children."
Senior Paul Haynes, who has
aspired to be an astronaut fora
long time, said that this reminds
everyone of the risks associated
with space travel.
"It brought home the realities of
the dangers of space flight," he said.
Students and experts agreed
with President George Bush, who
noted the risks that astronauts face
in an address on Saturday.
"These astronauts knew the dan
gers, and they faced them willingly,
knowing they had a high and noble
purpose in life," Bush said. "Be
cause of their courage and daring
and idealism, we will miss them all
the more."
An investigation is ongoing
and the preliminary focus has
been on insulation tiles being dis

lodged on launch.
"So far NASA has been very thor
ough," said Brian Cantwell, associ
ate chair of the Aeronautics and As
tronautics Department. "I'm very
impressed by how much informa
tion they have released."
Experts at Stanford speculated
that a failure with the insulation tiles
is a definite possibility.
"[The tiles] are designed with
great care but rather close toler
ances," Ashley said. "If for some
reason one was damaged where
heat transfer occurs, the tempera
tures are very, very high and
there's the possibility of tempera
tures high enough to melt the alu
minum of the shuttle.
"Everything in engineering is
probabilistic," he continued.
"There's always a probability some
thing could go wrong or fail."
Pate-Cornell noted that her risk
analysis in 1990 concluded that the
heat shield presents a risk in the
order of ten percent of the total risk
of catastrophic failure on die shut
tie. Within the tiles, over 85 percent
of the risk came from a critical 15
percent of them.

"The risk analysis is not well
known, but that's because it is
rather soft in some cases," she said.
"[Still,] the astronauts who flew
knew the risk."
It remains early to guess the
repercussions, but experts expected
that the shuttle program would be
stalled, but not for as long as after
the Challenger disaster.
"I do not expect the space pro
gram to come to a grinding halt, at
least [not] right now because they
have men up there," Pate-Cornell
said, referring to the International
Space Station which NASA had
planned to expand with five shuttle
flights this year. These flights are
now halted indefinitely.
Experts and students agreed
that while this disaster was a wake
up call for the space program and
the public, it did not and should
not mean an end to the manned
space program.
"The first and most important
reason for continuing the manned
space program is that it's good for
the American public and the public
likes it," Ashley said.
Cantwell said that manned space

flight is important not only for its
technological spin-offs and the abili
ty to do unique experiments in
space, but also as an investment for
the future.
"In the long run, human beings
will populate and move into space,"
he said.
President Bush has agreed that
manned space flight was important.
On Sunday, an administration offi
cial said that Bush's new budget
would include a $500 million in
crease in NASA's budget.
"Mankind is led into the dark
ness beyond our world by the in
spiration of discovery and the long
ing to understand." Bush said on
Saturday. "Our journey into space
will go on."
Professors saw the crash as hav
ing little impact on Stanford.
Cantwell noted that there are small
satellite programs being worked at
Stanford that had hoped to use
shuttles to get into space, but there
are other avenues for launching
satellites into orbit.
Still, psychologically, the tragedy
will have many repercussions, they
said.
