## Fostering diversity in medicine 
### MICHAEL MILLER EDITORIAL STAFF 
Over 600 prospective medical students
from West Coast colleges and high schools
gathered on Saturday for the 12th annual
Stanford University Minority Medical Asso
ciation conference, a convention created to
increase racial and ethnic diversity in medi
cine by providing attendees with informa
tion, opportunities and role models.
"I see the future health care leaders of
America in front of me," second-year Stan
ford medical student Thomas Satterwhite
said to a packed house at the opening of the
conference at the School of Medicine.
The day was filled with presentations
and workshops on everything from how to
prepare a good application for medical
school to how to find opportunities in bio
medical research. Organizers also encour
aged mingling among the students from
different backgrounds all over the West
Coast.
Unifying the conference was a drive by
the organizers and sponsors to increase mi
nority participation in medicine. Recruiters
from medical schools across the country
came to get a look at the best applicants, and
representatives from Kaplan and the

Princeton Review held sessions on test
preparation.
"Getting into medical school is such a
strategic thing," said Melissa Enriquez, a
second-year medical school student and
one of the coordinators. "[Many of these
students come from environments] that are
confounded with a lot of variables. Coming
from a place where a family doesn't know
how to get into college [or] doesn't have the
resources to provide more diana public
school education, it can be difficult to go into
medicine."
The conference aimed to disseminate
both theoretical and practical knowledge,
according to organizers.
"It's informational, demystifying the
medical admissions process," said Ron Gar
cia, assistant dean of minority affairs at the
Medical School. "It also has a motivational
role and presents role models."
Hie keynote speakers, successful med
ical professionals, emphasized the impor
tance of mentors and demonstrated with
their own examples how dedication could
triumph over adversity.
