## New discovery in the Columbia investigation; Missing tiles may have caused crash 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) —
Just before it disintegrated, space
shuttle Columbia experienced an
abnormal rise in temperature
and wind resistance that forced
the craft's automatic pilot to make
rapid changes in its flight path.
There is possible evidence that
some heat-protection tiles were
missing or damaged, NASA said
yesterday.
Engineers began assembling a
grim puzzle from debris recov
ered in Texas and Louisiana, and
disclosed computerized data
showing that the unusual events
before Saturday's accident oc
curred in the wheel well and fuse
lage on the left side of the shuttle,
the same side hit by a piece of
fuel-tank insulation during the
launch 16 days earlier.
Ron Dittemore, shuttle pro
gram manager, cautioned the
data was preliminary but said the
combination of events and data
suggest that the thermal tiles that
protect the shuttle from burning
up during re-entry may have
been damaged on Jan. 16.
"We've got some more detec
tive work. But we're making
progress inch by inch," Ditte
more said, adding that engineers
are trying to extract 32 seconds
more of computerized data from
the doomed spacecraft.

Dittemore said earlier in the

mission, NASA had investigated
the possible effects of the impact
from the fuel tank's foam insula
tion and concluded "it did not rep
resent a safety concern."
Dittemore said the engineer
ing data showed a rise of 20 to 30
degrees in the left wheel well
about seven minutes before com
munication was lost with the
spacecraft. Then there was a rise
of about 60 degrees over five min
utes in the lefthand side of the
fuselage above the wing, he said.
On the right side, the shutde
temperature rose the normal 15
degrees over the same period, he
said. The readings came from sen
sors underneath the thermal tiles,
on the aluminum hull of the craft.
The temperature rises were
followed by increased drag on the
spacecraft that caused its auto
mated flight system to adjust its
path, he said.
Communication with the shut
tle was lost soon after.
"It was if someone had cut the
wire," Dittemore said.
The left side of the spacecraft
has been the focus of suspicion al
most from the start. Investigators
are focusing on whether a broken
off piece of foam insulation from
the external fuel tank caused dam
age to the shuttle's left wing dur
ing lift-off Jan. 16 that ultimately
doomed the flight 16 days later.
