# U.S. vehicle purchases to dip in the new year
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — This
year's U.S. vehicle sales will likely
decline 1.8 percent and possibly
even more if the nation goes to war
with Iraq, but should remain
strong by historical standards, the
National Automobile Dealers Asso
ciation predicted yesterday.
NADA chief economist Paul
Taylor, speaking at the organiza
tion's 86th annual convention,
projected new car and light truck
sales of 16.5 million in 2003, down
from 16.8 million last year, the
fourth-best tally on record.
If the United States goes to war
with Iraq, Taylor says total volume
will likely decline by another
200,000 vehicles as the conflict
chills Americans' spending.
His predictions are in line with
most industry forecasts, which
range from 15.9 million to some 17
million.
"Given that the preceding four
years were the best in the history
of automotive retailing, there's
momentum for the long-run,"
Taylor said.
Some of the 25,000 dealers
and industry observers here said
they've been encouraged by re
cent economic indicators, such as
Friday's news that Americans
boosted their spending in De
cember by the largest amount in
five months.
Part of that surge was attributed
to year-end financing deals and
other incentives on cars and trucks.
At the same time, Americans' in
comes, including wages, interest
and government benefits, rose by a

solid 0.4 percent in December, up
from a 0.3 percent rise the month
before.
Both measures were stronger
than analysts had expected.
Ford Motor Co. chairman Bill
Ford said Saturday he remained
optimistic his company would top
Wall Street earnings forecasts this
year, though he acknowledged the
uncertainty related to a possible
war.
"I think there's just a general
tone of skepticism out there to
ward all businesses right now,"
Ford told reporters.
"I think with the threat of inter
national conflict hanging over the
stock market, it doesn't help any of
us," he said.
U.S. light vehicle sales topped
17.1 million in 2001 —the second
best year on record—before de
clining to what's still considered a
robust level last year.
Dealer incentives drove much
of the business and led to a surge in
trade-ins as consumers opted for
new vehicles.
Taylor said a focus among deal
ers this year will be ridding their
lots of used products.
"Dealers are challenged with
the need to turn over inventory
quickly in their used car opera
tions at a time of faster deprecia
tion on these vehicles," he said.
Taylor also said sales of
crossover utility vehicles — those
with features of a car and light
truck — are likely to grow at rates
near 50 percent this year as new
versions are introduced.
