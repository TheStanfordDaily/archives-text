## Columbia's nose-cone uncovered 
### 
HEMPHILL, Texas (AP) — Searchers found
the nose-cone of the space shuttle Columbia
buried deep in a thick pine forest near the
Louisiana border, officials said last night.
"It's reasonably intact," said Warren Zehner,
a senior coordinator for the Environmental
Protection Agency, which is overseeing collec
tion of shuttle debris.
Zehner estimated the shuttle piece weighed
about 500 pounds. He provided no other de
tails but it was believed to be one of the largest
pieces of the shuttle found thus far.
Since the shuttle broke up 39 miles over
Texas on Saturday, search teams have hunted
down remains and debris in the rivers and
woods of Louisiana and Texas — including a 6-
to-7-foot chunk of the shuttle's cabin found in
one rural county. Environmental and explo
sives experts, along with NASA officials, bagged
up wreckage yesterday and transported it to
airports now serving as evidence warehouses.
By late yesterday afternoon, some 12,000
pieces of debris had been collected in the re
gion.
State troopers near the site where the nose
cone was discovered described a hole about 20
feet wide in the pine forest. The troopers, who
would not give their names, were stationed at a
roadway to keep the media and others from the
site, about 130 miles northeast of Houston
What appeared to be one of the shuttle's
heat-protecting black tiles was embedded in a
tree in the vicinity of the nose cone.
Throughout the day, investigators went
from rural schools to a college campus gather
ing pieces of the space shuttle strewn across a
disaster scene larger than West Virginia.
"We are collecting material that we find on

the ground even as small as a quarter," said
Gary Moore, a regional coordinator for the
EPA.
"Obviously, you're going to get to a point
where you can't collect every single speck," he
said.
The agency is using an airplane equipped
with infrared sensors that can spot debris that
might be tainted with hazardous chemicals, as
well as a mobile unit on the ground to deter
mine whether any shuttle wreckage is emitting
toxic chemicals.
Divers plied the murky waters of Toledo
Bend Reservoir on the Texas-Louisiana state
line yesterday, scouting for what authorities be
lieve is a car-size chunk of the shuttle. Nothing
was found, although divers are expected to re
turn today with sonar equipment.
NASA shuttle program manager Ron Ditte
more said NASA was particularly interested in

any pieces that may have fallen from Columbia
as far west as New Mexico, Arizona or Califor
nia. The FBI was checking reports of possible
debris in Arizona.
"It's like looking fora needle in a haystack,"
Dittemore said, referring to tracking bits of the
6-by-6 inch thermal tiles that covered Colum
bia.
"But that is not going to keep us from look
ing for it,"he said.
Recovery teams gathered yesterday at a fed
eral command post in Lufkin to be dispatched
to counties across the state, said Sue Kennedy,
emergency management coordinator for
Nacogdoches County.
A seven-member squad in Nacogdoches re
moved 25 pieces of debris from the grounds at
Douglass School, whose 340 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade stayed
home for the day.
