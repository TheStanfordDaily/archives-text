### 
ALHAMBRA, Calif. (AP) — Phil
Spector, the legendary record
producer whose "wall of sound"
helped change the sound of pop
music in the 19605, was arrested
yesterday for allegedly shooting a
woman to death at his suburban
mansion.
Spector, 62, was seized at the
castle-like estate around 5 a.m.
after someone in the home called
the authorities. He was released
after 7 p.m. after posting a $ 1 mil
lion bond, said Los Angeles Coun
ty sheriff s Deputy Rich Pena.
Attorney Robert Shapiro, whose
clients have included O.J. Simpson,
was representing Spector.
Authorities did not immediate
ly identify the woman or her rela
tionship to Spector.
The victim, found in the foyer,
appeared to be in her early to mid
-208 and authorities were trying to
locate her relatives, sheriffs Lt.
Daniel Rosenberg said. He said
deputies had found the murder
weapon but released no details.
"Someone else was there at the
time of the shooting," he said, de
clining to elaborate. A black Mer
cedes-Benz sedan with the driver's
door open was parked in the dri
veway of the home, which records
show Spector bought in 1998 for
$1.1 million. Authorities towed the
car away later in the day.
A friend of Spector's, attorney
Marvin Mitchelson, said the pro
ducer lived alone and didn't have
a girlfriend. He said he and Spec
tor had been trying to put togeth

era movie about Spector's life.
"His mental state has been
great — very rational, very togeth
er," the attorney said.
Spector is famous for creating
the "wall of sound" effect that in
volved overdubbing to create a
full, dramatic sound. The tech
nique, which combines multiple
instruments, vocals and sound ef
fects, changed the way pop
records were produced while
bringing fame to groups like the
Ronettes and the Crystals.
In his storied career, Spector
produced records for Elvis Pres
ley, Ike and Tina Turner, the
Righteous Brothers and Darlene
Love. He produced the last Beat
les album, "Let It Be," in 1970,
worked with John Lennon on
"Imagine" and helped Yoko Ono
produce Lennon's work after he
was killed in 1980.
Among the hits bearing his sig
nature style are "Da Doo Ron
Ron" and "Then He Kissed Me"
by the Crystals; "Walking in the
Rain" by the Ronettes and "You've
Lost That Lovin' Feelin"' by the
Righteous Brothers.
His session players, known as
the "Wrecking Crew," included
guitarist Glen Campbell, pianist
Leon Russell, drummer Hal
Blaine and the late Sonny Bono,
who learned the producer's trade
under Spector.
Spector, who was inducted into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1989, has been reclusive over the
past couple of decades.
