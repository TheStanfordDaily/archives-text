## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Crunching frosh dorms 
### 
Last week, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs an
nounced that it is considering
fundamental changes in resi
dential education that would include
clustering freshmen in two residence
complexes on the east side of campus.
The freshman dorm experience is con
sidered to be very important; first-year
students are introduced to living with a
large group of their peers in a rich social
and intellectual environment, and last
ing friendships and relationships are
often formed. Substantial changes to
such an experience warrant important
discussions between the administration,
students and resident fellows.
Although the 1997 Report of the Task
Force on Residential Programs and Stu
dent Housing for Undergraduates stated
that 75 percent of students requested all
frosh dorms, many upper-class students re-

portedly felt very
pleased with their ex
periences in four-class
dorms as freshmen
and were not unhap
py with their final
placement. For many
freshmen, the unique
living situation avail
able in a four-class
dorm results in more

interactions and friendships with older stu
dents, allowing them to explore activities
and academic opportunities they might not
have discovered on their own. Tlie changes
proposed would imply that incoming stu
dents would have fewer choices in terms of
living situations and would also further iso
late students in mixed-class dorms, such as
ethnic theme houses, the Structured Liber
al Education program and Freshman/
Sophomore College.
The Office of the Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs is also contemplating adding a
new staff position to freshman dorms: live
in resident tutors who would concentrate
on academic advising and guidance as well
as disciplinary issues. These tutors would
be either graduate students or postdoctor
al fellows, which would essentially change
the current dynamic in the undergradu
ate-run dorms. The presence of these new
resident tutors would greatly affect the
function of the existing resident fellows,
and the Vice Provost's Office has made it
unclear whether the resident fellows would
continue to live in the dorm apartments.
Because their future is so uncertain, the
Vice Provost's Office must include them in
the discussions.
Most importantly, however, is whether
the proposed residential tutors are really
necessary. The current freshman dorm

staff already includes a group of trained
undergraduates who accommodate the
many needs of first-year students and who
form important personal relationships
with the residents. Current dorm staff
members are undergraduates, which al
lows fora more comfortable peer-to-peer
relationship. This might not be as attain
able with the authoritarian position that an
older resident tutor might assume. Not
only does the Head Peer Academic Coor
dinator, an undergraduate staff member
living in the dorms, already provide an ex
cellent array of resources and advice for
first-year students, but the Undergraduate
Advising Center offers an invaluable ser
vice to undergraduates seeking academic
advice from trained professional coun
selors. A change in the structure is unnec
essary.
Although the administration claims to
have interviewed students regarding this

issue, it is clear that
not enough have
been surveyed and
that the ASSU has not
been properly con
sulted. Several impor
tant clarifications
need to be presented
to students, resident
fellows and future
dorm staff members

regarding this issue, including when the
proposed changes would be made; how
residential education activities and services
would change; and how ethnic theme
dorms, FroSoCo and the SLE students
would be incorporated into the all-frosh
programs.
It is imperative that upperclassmen are
also consulted, given that these changes
would fundamentally impact the Draw and
would allow for less interaction with the in
coming classes. Additionally, the opinions of
both current resident fellows as well as stu
dents considering future staff positions
should be sought out; all-frosh dorms re
quire much more attention and energy on
the part of the staff and RFs, and some
might find the cluster of freshman dorms
overwhelming for both the freshmen and
the staff.
While Stanford's residential education
system differs from that of many schools in
that it combines upperclassmen and fresh
men in most dorms, it has worked well in
the past, offering incoming students who
live in or near four-class dorms the oppor
tunity to learn and interact with older sea
soned students. Any overhauling changes
need to be highly scrutinized and discussed
to insure that first-year students are offered
an equally valuable and enjoyable intro
duction to the Farm.
