# TALES FROM UNDERCLASS
## So long, and thanks 
### 
For the first time at Stan
ford I'm taking a class
where I feel completely
lost. It's a new feeling. I
keep thinking of that "Simpsons"
episode where Lisa wants to drop
out of military school. Bart says"I
thought you came here looking for
a challenge,", to which Lisa re
sponds "Duh! A challenge I could
do!" That's me. Sure it's fun to
learn stuff and to grapple with
problems, but not when I have
more pressing needs, like reading
Dostoevsky or playing Grand
Theft Auto 111, and not when the
homework is graded.
I'll probably miss it when it's
over.
This is my last column, and as
much as it's been torture for me to
come up with a topic every week,
I've loved it. I've loved the experi
ence and I once again need to
thank all my readers for their sup
port and feedback. I wanted to go
out with a bang, with the best col
umn ever written, but this is just a
tribute. I'm going to sum up this
quarter in my last column, so this is
just a collection of little bits I never
got a chance to expound on.
Why does everyone expect to
find their soulmate while doing
laundry? Or is that just me? I think
this is another idea of love that's
been forced on us by sitcoms. I
barely ever talk to people in the
laundry room, let alone engage in
deep, meaningful conversations.
Besides, people are usually surly
when doing laundry; it's not an ac
tivity that anyone really enjoys.
The utilitarian furnishings and
poor lighting in the underbelly of
Wilbur Hall aren't very conducive
to romantic encounters, either.
The only thing more depress
ing than sitting motionless in the
computer cluster until the auto
matic neon cubicle lighting goes

dark is opening your PO Box and
finding it empty. I think I'm going
to get back into bootleg trading
just so I'll always have live, good
music waiting for me in my mail
box. Stanford should set up a pen
pal program so our mailboxes
never go unfilled. We'll match up
total strangers on campus, grad
students in the School of Educa
tion and EE sophomores. Every-

one always talks
about diversity,
but I'm really
doing something
about it.
Someone once
came up to me
while I was wait
ing in line fora
package at the

post office and said that he and a
friend wanted to convert the
burnt-out CDC building into a
whore house called "The HoHo".
The joke wouldn't work without
the existing absurdity of Stanford
vernacular.
Does anyone else get flashbacks
to Sept. 11 when they can't fall
asleep? I always thought I'd get
around to talking about 9/11, but
I never did. I've always been of the
opinion that everyone should just
shut up about it, but the fact that 1
still think about it means I'm
guessing other people do too. It
hits me at the weirdest times, see
ing photographs of the Twin Tow
ers don't bother me, but seeing a
shot of the towers through the
arch in Washington Square Park
does. Giving my heavily opinionat
ed and highly critical explanations
of each of the new plans for
"Ground Zero" (go Sky Park!)
doesn't bother me, but watching
Bush's State of the Union, as peo
ple drank to terrorism sent shivers
down my spine. I wonder if I'll still
be thinking about it when I'm 30.1

wonder if my kids will ask me
about it. I wonder if I'll tell them.
I was hoping to write this col
umn either drunk or hungover, as
this week has seen my first Stan
ford experiences with alcohol. I
thought it'd be mature and glam
orous to be drinking Hemingway
esque mint juleps while writing, or
popping Tylenol like tic-tacs to
nurse a headache. Unfortunately I
failed to get wasted enough this
weekend. I'm pretending I have a
lot more weekends to try.
It scares me how casually I let
the weeks and weekends slip
through my fingers. The quarter
seems a lot shorter when you think
of it as "10 Fridays" rather than
"10 weeks". One of my friends has
an even more depressing perspec
tive — he figures we have roughly
130 weekends at Stanford over the
course of four years, for all the
freshman, we've already used up
around 10% of them. If you let just
one of those Fridays go by, moping
around the dorm, it's a catastroph
ic loss.
It saddens me that I won't have
a column running the week of
Valentine's Day. It had always
been my secret plan to use my col
umn to leverage a date for V-Day.
Am I this desperate? Possibly. But
since this is my last column, I won't
be able to look fora smart, funny,
Radiohead-loving, geekiness-tol
erating, well-read Stanford fe
male. Oh well.
Writing this column has been a
lot like talking to a cute girl. After
wards you replay the conversation
over and over and wonder what
cunning linguistics would have
worked better. At least that what's
I do.
Don't Dream It. Be It.

the weeks and weekends slip
through my fingers. The quarter
seems a lot shorter when you think
of it as "10 Fridays" rather than
"10 weeks". One of my friends has
an even more depressing perspec
tive — he figures we have roughly
130 weekends at Stanford over the
course of four years, for all the
freshman, we've already used up
around 10% of them. If you let just
one of those Fridays go by, moping
around the dorm, it's a catastroph
ic loss.
It saddens me that I won't have
a column running the week of
Valentine's Day. It had always
been my secret plan to use my col
umn to leverage a date for V-Day.
Am I this desperate? Possibly. But
since this is my last column, I won't
be able to look fora smart, funny,
Radiohead-loving, geekiness-tol
erating, well-read Stanford fe
male. Oh well.
Writing this column has been a
lot like talking to a cute girl. After
wards you replay the conversation
over and over and wonder what
cunning linguistics would have
worked better. At least that what's
I do.
Don't Dream It. Be It.

For the first time at Stan
ford I'm taking a class
where I feel completely
lost. It's a new feeling. I
keep thinking of that "Simpsons"
episode where Lisa wants to drop
out of military school. Bart says"I
thought you came here looking for
a challenge,", to which Lisa re
sponds "Duh! A challenge I could
do!" That's me. Sure it's fun to
learn stuff and to grapple with
problems, but not when I have
more pressing needs, like reading
Dostoevsky or playing Grand
Theft Auto 111, and not when the
homework is graded.
I'll probably miss it when it's
over.
This is my last column, and as
much as it's been torture for me to
come up with a topic every week,
I've loved it. I've loved the experi
ence and I once again need to
thank all my readers for their sup
port and feedback. I wanted to go
out with a bang, with the best col
umn ever written, but this is just a
tribute. I'm going to sum up this
quarter in my last column, so this is
just a collection of little bits I never
got a chance to expound on.
Why does everyone expect to
find their soulmate while doing
laundry? Or is that just me? I think
this is another idea of love that's
been forced on us by sitcoms. I
barely ever talk to people in the
laundry room, let alone engage in
deep, meaningful conversations.
Besides, people are usually surly
when doing laundry; it's not an ac
tivity that anyone really enjoys.
The utilitarian furnishings and
poor lighting in the underbelly of
Wilbur Hall aren't very conducive
to romantic encounters, either.
The only thing more depress
ing than sitting motionless in the
computer cluster until the auto
matic neon cubicle lighting goes

dark is opening your PO Box and
finding it empty. I think I'm going
to get back into bootleg trading
just so I'll always have live, good
music waiting for me in my mail
box. Stanford should set up a pen
pal program so our mailboxes
never go unfilled. We'll match up
total strangers on campus, grad
students in the School of Educa
tion and EE sophomores. Every-

one always talks
about diversity,
but I'm really
doing something
about it.
Someone once
came up to me
while I was wait
ing in line fora
package at the

post office and said that he and a
friend wanted to convert the
burnt-out CDC building into a
whore house called "The HoHo".
The joke wouldn't work without
the existing absurdity of Stanford
vernacular.
Does anyone else get flashbacks
to Sept. 11 when they can't fall
asleep? I always thought I'd get
around to talking about 9/11, but
I never did. I've always been of the
opinion that everyone should just
shut up about it, but the fact that 1
still think about it means I'm
guessing other people do too. It
hits me at the weirdest times, see
ing photographs of the Twin Tow
ers don't bother me, but seeing a
shot of the towers through the
arch in Washington Square Park
does. Giving my heavily opinionat
ed and highly critical explanations
of each of the new plans for
"Ground Zero" (go Sky Park!)
doesn't bother me, but watching
Bush's State of the Union, as peo
ple drank to terrorism sent shivers
down my spine. I wonder if I'll still
be thinking about it when I'm 30.1

wonder if my kids will ask me
about it. I wonder if I'll tell them.
I was hoping to write this col
umn either drunk or hungover, as
this week has seen my first Stan
ford experiences with alcohol. I
thought it'd be mature and glam
orous to be drinking Hemingway
esque mint juleps while writing, or
popping Tylenol like tic-tacs to
nurse a headache. Unfortunately I
failed to get wasted enough this
weekend. I'm pretending I have a
lot more weekends to try.
