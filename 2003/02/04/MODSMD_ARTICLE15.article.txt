Modern space travel 'foolish'
The news has been dominated by the
Columbia tragedy, which resulted in the
deaths of seven astronauts and the loss of a
$7 billion enterprise. Watching the flam
ing wreckage streak through the sky, I im
mediately thought of the Icarus legend.
Daedalus was an inventor of great renown
who built a labyrinth in Crete to house the
Minotaur. King Minos then imprisoned
Daedalus and his son Icarus. Daedalus in
vented waxed wings, which allowed them
to escape. However, Icarus flew too close
to the sun, his wings melted and he fell into
the sea. Safe, yet despondent, Daedalus
settled in Sicily.
Here is a perfect allegory for modern
space programs. Flying in airplanes
makes sense, but space travel is foolish
and leads to disaster. We should learn
this lesson. David Wilson, a congress
man from Florida, and sundry NASA of
ficials vowed to continue the program to
have people living in space and presum
ably to put a man on Mars. This is Icarus
madness. Scientific experiments can be
carried out in unmanned spacecraft.

The problem is that there are so many
vested interests in Florida and NASA
that there will be new demands that we
spend billions on these foolish and ex
pensive expressions of man's pride.
Pride comes before a fall, both figura
tively and literally. The Greeks had a
word for this: hubrisâ€”the result of arro
gance resulting from excessive pride.

Column on 'whiteness' fails to relate real
prejudice
Craig Albrecht's column, "Don't
Call Me White" (Jan. 30) on his white
identity, or lack thereof, was beautiful
ly illustrative of the many privileges
that still accompany whiteness in
America today. While I'm glad that Al
brecht can fluidly move between social
situations without having to be con
scious of his race, to generalize this ex
perience to the rest of the population,
or anyone else for that matter, is very
problematic.
If in his perspective American society

is eager to integrate all its minorities into
one happy family, I have to doubt the
breadth of his experience. Insensitive re
actions to racialized traits makes it diffi
cult or even impossible for many people
of color to become unaware of their race.
And his experience with the altogether
too real prejudice against athletes
doesn't seem to be analogous to the
threat of physical harm some minorities
face in the form of overt bigotry.
The telling mention of John
McWhorter, and the emphasis on his
blackness, shows that Albrecht is also not
above subscribing to supposedly point
less racial categories to prove his point.
Lastly, in terms of where a heterosex
ual white man can get a meal on this campus,
I offer a few suggestions: the fraternities, or
better yet, the Faculty Club. I hear their buf
fet is great.

'Mega Branner' would reduce
interaction, diversity
I have never been aware of students
calling for more all-frosh housing. As

someone who requested an all-frosh
dorm and didn't get placed in one, I
have some suggestions for why this
type of advocacy hasn't materialized.
Living in a four-class dorm freshman
year was one of the best things that
happened to me. The upperclassmen
in my dorm gave me great advice,
guidance and perspectives that made
my experience easier, not to mention
much richer.
Clustering freshmen together would
end interactions between people of dif
ferent graduating classes, which often
constitutes a vital component of any stu
dent's experience. I cannot imagine how
different my experience would have been
if I had lived in a "mega-Branner."
More importantly, as chair of the Asian
American Students' Association and a
member of the Students of Color Coali
tion, I have to voice concern over the fate
of ethnic theme dorms. Ethnic theme
dorms are crucial to the intellectual, cul
tural and social vitality of Stanford. The
type of clustering that is being proposed,
would isolate freshmen in Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and Ujamaa from the rest of
their class. Okada and Casa Zapata, on
the other hand, would become the only
four-class dorms in an all-freshman envi

ronment, changing their dynamics and
making them less appealing for non
frosh. At these ethnic theme dorms, the
presence of resident fellows who add to
and cultivate a sense of community is es
pecially important, and I would hope
that their positions are not eliminated.
