# INS delays registration deadline
## Schools given two more weeks to register on Sevis 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
In response to problems with its $36 million
Student and Exchange Visitor System, the Im
migration and Naturalization Service an
nounced a two-week extension Saturday of the
deadline for institutions to begin using the
computerized, online system that tracks inter
national students' enrollment in U.S. universi
ties.
The INS has given over 3,000 high schools,
colleges and universities — including
Stanford — approval to use Sevis, but over
2,000 are still awaiting permission. Many of the
colleges that did receive approval reported that
Sevis was extremely slow and often booted its
users.
The issue is pressing because the INS re
quires schools to meet certain requirements —
now including Sevis compliance — and com
plete an application process to be able to host
international students. Schools had been

promised that their applications would be
processed by the self-imposed Jan. 31 INS
deadline, but when that day came and went, the
INS announced the extension.
Sevis is designed to help schools across the
country and the INS to better keep track of in
ternational students at U.S. learning institu
tions.
Stanford's Bechtel International Center re
ceived approval last week, but only started up
loading information on Stanford's internation
al students to Sevis yesterday.
"They seem to have done an upgrade over
the weekend," said John Pearson, director of
the center. "But it [still] seems to go a little slow,
so, yes, it takes time to do it."
The extension gives the INS time to both im
prove Sevis' functionality and process schools'
applications, some of which have been pending
for months.
"Some schools had not been approved, and
so for the next two weeks, they
[are] still allowed to hand in
documents the old way," Pear
son explained.
The INS hopes that, once its
initial problems are overcome,
Sevis will function as the sole
means for schools to provide in
formation about their interna
tional students to the agency.
Sevis was initially introduced
after the first World Trade Cen
ter bombings in 1993, but be
came a priority after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.
The deadline extension is the
latest in a long series of devel
opments and INS directives re
garding international students,
as the agency attempts to keep
closer tabs on foreigners.
Many international students
have complained that the new
INS tracking procedures are
overly invasive and put pressure
on universities to reveal addition
al personal student information.
"I. think it's going to be an
ongoing story," Pearson said.
