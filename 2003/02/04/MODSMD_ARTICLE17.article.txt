## Cal edges Stanford in tight tennis match 
### CHRIS MEYER 
Stanford's quest fora record 18th
NCAA, team tennis championship got
off to a rocky start in Saturday's season
opener at the Hellman Tennis Com
plex in Berkeley. The No. 4 Cardinal
seemed to have the match in hand, but
losses by two of its three All-Americans
allowed No. 9 California (2-0) to edge
Stanford 4-3 for only the second time
since 1991.

Men's Tennis
Saturday:
No. 9 California 4, No. 4 Stanford 3
vs. TCU, Saturday, 12:00 p.m.

With the match knotted at 3-3, the
crowd gathered around the first court
to watch the deciding contest between
Stanford's senior Ail-American Ryan
Haviland and Cal's Balazs Veress, a ju
nior ranked No. 37 nationally.
As the third set of the match wore
on, the fans became increasingly bois
terous and supportive of the Bears.
"The crowd was awesome and if
anything it just motivated me more,"
Haviland said. "But I think it helped
Veress more than it helped me. He
was really feeding on it."
Haviland struggled with his serve
in the third set, preventing him from
playing his attacking serve-and-volley
game. Veress increasingly attacked his
opponent's second serve, putting
pressure on Haviland to make first
serves. In the end, Veress prevailed 4-
6, 6-4, 6-3.
"I had the match in my hands, but it
slipped through my fingers," Haviland
said. "He played some amazing tennis
to get the win. I've got to give him cred
it. At the same time, I don't think I re
ally played the way I wanted to."
Haviland was talking about his
own loss, but his words could have
been describing the performance of
his entire team. The Cardinal came

so close to victory, only to have it slip
away.
"In these matches with the other
top teams, it's such a thin line between
going home happy and going home
disappointed," senior Scott Lipsky
said.
The match got off to a promising
start for the Cardinal as it jumped out
to a 3-1 lead. Stanford secured the first
point by winning two of the three dou
bles matches. KC Corkery and James
Pade, the Cardinal's third doubles
team and the No. 9 duo in the country,
demolished Cal's Or Dekel and Conor
Niland 8-1. The Cardinal's top dou
bles tandem, Scott Lipsky and David
Martin, ranked No. 3 nationally, de
feated Cal's Robert Kowalczyk and
Steve Berke 9-7.
With the doubles point in hand, the
Cardinal proceeded to win two of the
first three singles matches. On court
two, 15th-ranked Martin beat Dekel,
6-3, 7-5. At No. 5, freshman James
Pade defeated Steve Berke 6-2, 6-0.
The win was especially impressive
considering Berke, a senior transfer
from Yale, reached the quarterfinals
of the NCAA singles championship
two years ago.
The Cardinal's only early loss was
Kowalczyk's (No. 82) win over Cork
ery (No. 50) 6-2, 6-2 on court number
four.
"It was sort of a matter of fact match
fora while," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "All of a sudden it be
came a really tight match."
The next match to finish was at No.
6. Junior Carter Morris battled hard,
but ultimately fell 7-5, 6-3 to Mik
Ledanova. Morris's loss left the match
at 3-2, with two matches yet to be de
cided.
On court three, Lipsky (No. 46)
won his first sets and held the lead in
the second set. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, he was met by a strong op
ponent who came from behind to beat

him 2-6, 7-5, 6-2.
"We lost a match that we were in a
position to win, and we have to find a
way to win these kind of matches,"
head coach Dick Gould said. "We have
to learn how to play when ahead, so
this won't happen again."
"We're going to be fine, and we'll

get better because of this. It's a really
good match to get under our belt. I
wish we would have won it, but it's a
long season and we'll see Cal again
down the road."
The Cardinal's next match is Satur
day against Texas Christian at the
Taube Tennis Stadium.

going home happy and going home
disappointed," senior Scott Lipsky
said.
The match got off to a promising
start for the Cardinal as it jumped out
to a 3-1 lead. Stanford secured the first
point by winning two of the three dou
bles matches. KC Corkery and James
Pade, the Cardinal's third doubles
team and the No. 9 duo in the country,
demolished Cal's Or Dekel and Conor
Niland 8-1. The Cardinal's top dou
bles tandem, Scott Lipsky and David
Martin, ranked No. 3 nationally, de
feated Cal's Robert Kowalczyk and
Steve Berke 9-7.
With the doubles point in hand, the
Cardinal proceeded to win two of the
first three singles matches. On court
two, 15th-ranked Martin beat Dekel,
6-3, 7-5. At No. 5, freshman James
Pade defeated Steve Berke 6-2, 6-0.
The win was especially impressive
considering Berke, a senior transfer
from Yale, reached the quarterfinals
of the NCAA singles championship
two years ago.
The Cardinal's only early loss was
Kowalczyk's (No. 82) win over Cork
ery (No. 50) 6-2, 6-2 on court number
four.
"It was sort of a matter of fact match
fora while," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "All of a sudden it be
came a really tight match."
The next match to finish was at No.
6. Junior Carter Morris battled hard,
but ultimately fell 7-5, 6-3 to Mik
Ledanova. Morris's loss left the match
at 3-2, with two matches yet to be de
cided.
On court three, Lipsky (No. 46)
won his first sets and held the lead in
the second set. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, he was met by a strong op
ponent who came from behind to beat

him 2-6, 7-5, 6-2.
"We lost a match that we were in a
position to win, and we have to find a
way to win these kind of matches,"
head coach Dick Gould said. "We have
to learn how to play when ahead, so
this won't happen again."
"We're going to be fine, and we'll

get better because of this. It's a really
good match to get under our belt. I
wish we would have won it, but it's a
long season and we'll see Cal again
down the road."
The Cardinal's next match is Satur
day against Texas Christian at the
Taube Tennis Stadium.
