successful as Cardinal athletes ran

al marks.
To open the invitational, the
men's and women's distance med
ley relay teams both posted wins.
The distance medley relay consists
of a 1200, 400, 800, and then a

minutes, 34.56 seconds is currently
the leading time in the nation, while

fending national champions, to post
a nation-leading 11:05.16.
"It was a great meet for the Stan
ford men and women," said Vin
Lananna, director of cross country
and track and field. "I was particular
ly pleased with the competitive side of
our team. We won a number of events
and have been working very hard."
The women's sprint squad again
posted impressive results as fresh
man Jakki Bailey lowered her pro
visional time in the 60 to 7.35 sec
onds, winning the race over UCLA
standouts All-American Monique

finishing third.
Freshman Samantha Shepard
tied for second in the pole vault,
clearing 12-7.5, while teammates se

The Cardinal also got a third
from Becker in the long jump (18-
7.75) and junior Jessica Pluth
claimed seventh in the women's
weight dirow (55-6.50).
Cardinal distance runners again
proved why Stanford's program is
considered one of the best in the na
tion. On top of their distance med
ley wins, the men's and women's
squads saw eight athletes hit NCAA
qualifying times.
Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig
posted the second fastest time
(9:07.88) in the nation while win
ning the 3,000 meter. Teammate

and defending NCAA champion at
3,000, senior Lauren Fleshman,
claimed second in an auto time of
9:11.53. Senior Malindi Elmore fin
ished fourth, posting an automatic
time of 9:17.68.
Sophomore Jeane Goff and ju
nior Katie Hotchkiss took fifth and
sixth in the mile, finishing in 4:49.85
and 4:51.81, respectively.
In the men's mile, junior Phillip
West was the top finisher for the
Cardinal, finishing eighth in
4:09.93.
Juniors Seth Hejny and Steve
Loughlin led the men's team with
provisional times in 3,000 by placing
14th (8:03.75) and 15th (8:04.16).
Junior Louis Luchini posted the
second fastest time in the nation this
year in the 5,000 with an auto time of
13:49.82. Redshirt freshman Neil
Davis also hit the auto standard with
his 13:57.18, the fourth fastest time in
the nation. Junior Adam Tenforde
had a provisional time of 14:02.11.
"It was a great way to open the sea
son personally, as I hit the auto mark"
Davis said. "This first invitational
shows to all the doubters that my
cross country season was not a fluke
and that I can run with the top colle
giate distance runners in America."
These early season marks are un
doubtedly a positive sign for the
Stanford squad as training has not
been tapered for the champi
onships portion of the season, yet.
"We have done very little race
specific work for the middle dis
tance and distance events," Lanan
na said. "Our sprinters look good,
and, once we back off on the weights
and drill, they will be ready to roll."
The Cardinal will compete again
at the United Heritage Invitational
in Boise, Idaho, on Saturday.
