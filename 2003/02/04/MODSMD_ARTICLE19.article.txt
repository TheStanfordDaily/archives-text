# LeBron, I would have taken the jerseys as well

What was Leßron James thinking? How
could someone so gifted, and so blessed do
something so childish and thoughtless? By
accepting two throwback jerseys valued at
$845 from a local merchant, Leßron violated Ohio am
ateur athletics bylaws and was declared ineligible for the
remainder of his high school basketball season.
Such thoughtless actions plainly illustrate the com
plete lack of compassion the youngster has for those
people who have given so selflessly of their time and en-

ergy to help this young man along his
path.
Like those loveable, warm-hearted
folks at ESPN. Eager to show that
they're not just another branch of that
evil Disney corporation, ESPN willingly
televised several of Leßron's high
school games nationally. And what did
ESPN ask in return? Many hundreds of
thousands of dollars of advertising rev-

enue, a photo shoot for the cover of ESPN the magazine
and page after page of analysis, critique, and day-to-day
saturation coverage of Leßron's life for ESPN.com.
But other than that, what did they ask? Nothing.
They reached out an affectionate arm to a talented
youngster who just needed some guidance, some moti
vation, some national media exposure and Dick Vitale
calling his high school games from the sidelines. And
how did Leßron repay this unconceivable generosity
(other than with hundreds of thousands of dollars of ad
vertising revenue)? He accepted two shirts for free! Oh
the shame of it all.
And let's not forget the little guy in all of this. The
Pay-Per-View stations that were charging local cable
subscribers to view Leßron's games fora small fee will
now miss out on their kind-hearted investment of love,
caring and closed-circuit feeds.
If I were Leßron's mother I would be ashamed. Here
I go and take out a loan to buy my kid a Hummer H2,
and he turns around and gets himself disqualified. And
to think that there's some spoiled rich white kid from La
Jolla who has to drive himself to and from the tennis
club in a stinkin' Cadillac Escalade Limited Edition be
cause that ungrateful, undeserving Leßron wanted to
walk around in a Gayle Sayers throwback. How does his

poor mother sleep at night?
I personally am disturbed that
I know the value of the merchan
dise given to a high school kid in
Ohio. What does it say about our
society that a high school senior
would make headlines in major
news publications, and The Stan
ford Daily, for something so
minor?
In my opinion, Leßron should
be able to reap the fruits of the
fame that we have thrust upon
him. It's not as if he asked ESPN
to cash in on the fact that he's the

best high school basketball player
since a guy named Lew Alcindor
was bursting onto the scene. It's
not a crime fora mother to obtain
a bank loan to buy her son a gift,
although it was certainly treated
as if it were one in this case.
I can't name a single high
school senior who wouldn't trade
a few promotional photos for
$845 worth of merchandise. I'm a
college senior, and I'd trade my
photograph fora cheeseburger if
I could find any takers (and don't
think I haven't tried. They won't
even accept my picture at Arby's).
How do you not indulge your
self once in a while if you're in Le-
Bron's position? He has Darius
Miles, star forward for the Cleve

land Cavaliers, shelling out big
bucks for courtside seats to watch
him play. And with good cause,
because his name sells more tick
ets than your average Cavs game
nowadays.
His popularity is so profound
and his skills so revered, that the
Cavs actually considered Le-
Bron's feelings before making the
decision to dismiss head coach
John Lucas recently. You're a se
nior in high school and NBA
teams are making personnel deci
sions based on the hope that they
might get a chance to pay you ab
surd amounts of money to play
for them next year. But don't let
people give you cool-looking
gear, because that's just unaccept

able.
I say give the kid a break. He
has a chance to help his team
mates reach the goals that they
have worked toward for four long
years. To forbid him to play even
after he has returned the jerseys
and apologized for unknowingly
breaking the rules is to make a
mockery of his situation. The
media has highlighted his every
move fora year now, why not give
him a chance to make a couple
more highlight reels on the court?

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and he has no qualms
about accepting free stuff. Please send
