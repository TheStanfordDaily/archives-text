What was Leßron James thinking? How
could someone so gifted, and so blessed do
something so childish and thoughtless? By
accepting two throwback jerseys valued at
$845 from a local merchant, Leßron violated Ohio am
ateur athletics bylaws and was declared ineligible for the
remainder of his high school basketball season.
Such thoughtless actions plainly illustrate the com
plete lack of compassion the youngster has for those
people who have given so selflessly of their time and en-

ergy to help this young man along his
path.
Like those loveable, warm-hearted
folks at ESPN. Eager to show that
they're not just another branch of that
evil Disney corporation, ESPN willingly
televised several of Leßron's high
school games nationally. And what did
ESPN ask in return? Many hundreds of
thousands of dollars of advertising rev-

enue, a photo shoot for the cover of ESPN the magazine
and page after page of analysis, critique, and day-to-day
saturation coverage of Leßron's life for ESPN.com.
But other than that, what did they ask? Nothing.
They reached out an affectionate arm to a talented
youngster who just needed some guidance, some moti
vation, some national media exposure and Dick Vitale
calling his high school games from the sidelines. And
how did Leßron repay this unconceivable generosity
(other than with hundreds of thousands of dollars of ad
vertising revenue)? He accepted two shirts for free! Oh
the shame of it all.
And let's not forget the little guy in all of this. The
Pay-Per-View stations that were charging local cable
subscribers to view Leßron's games fora small fee will
now miss out on their kind-hearted investment of love,
caring and closed-circuit feeds.
If I were Leßron's mother I would be ashamed. Here
I go and take out a loan to buy my kid a Hummer H2,
and he turns around and gets himself disqualified. And
to think that there's some spoiled rich white kid from La
Jolla who has to drive himself to and from the tennis
club in a stinkin' Cadillac Escalade Limited Edition be
cause that ungrateful, undeserving Leßron wanted to
walk around in a Gayle Sayers throwback. How does his
