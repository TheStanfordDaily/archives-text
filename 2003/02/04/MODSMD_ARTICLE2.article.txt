# New assistant deans to focus on grad diversity
## 
### FRANCINE MILLER 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences has appointed two Stanford
graduates to be assistant deans for mul
ticultural graduate student services,
expanding the position in an effort to
stimulate minority admission to and
enrollment in the University's gradu
ate programs.
"The School of Humanities and Sci
ences had been diversifying nicely until
five years ago," said Judith Goldstein,
cognizant dean for graduate and under
graduate studies. "For some reason we
have been less successful in yielding mi
nority students in recent years. We are
making the offers, but no one is coming."
Although the undergraduate stu
dent population at Stanford is consid
erably diverse, only 2.7 percent of the
non-international graduate popula
tion admitted this year emanates
from minority backgrounds, said
Stephanie Fryberg, one of the two
new appointees.
The new appointees, Fryberg and
Joseph Brown, both recent graduates
from Stanford's doctoral program in
social psychology, will help recruit and
retain candidates from diverse back
grounds by visiting schools and meet
ing with students, assisting them with
the admissions process and providing
services and resources for minority stu
dents already at Stanford.
Bolstered by Provost John
Etchemendy's Diversity Action Coun
cil, which has in recent years empha
sized the need fora greater presence of
graduate student minorities at Stan
ford, the School expanded the person

nel committed to achieving this goal.
In the past, a single assistant dean
was responsible for recruiting minori
ties into graduate programs. This is the
first time the position has been split.
Fryberg will concentrate primarily
upon students in the humanities and
social sciences, while Brown will
focus upon minority graduates in
natural sciences.
"We live in a world that is essentially
a complex, diverse place," Goldstein
said. "By having larger numbers of mi
nority students on campus, we can bet
ter approximate the diversity within
American society."
Brown, who is black and holds a
bachelor's degree in physics and a mas
ter's biomedical engineering, believes
that greater student diversity would
benefit the academic community.
"Stanford is a premier educational
institution and a wonderful place for
minority students," Brown said. "From
my own personal experience here, it
was helpful to have people from other
ethnic backgrounds and to have them
share their experiences with me."
Aside from increasing minority stu
dent representation at Stanford,
Brown also hopes to provide awareness
of the various support networks avail
able on campus.
"As human beings, we naturally
need communities," Brown said.
"Many graduates feel that, when their
program is especially challenging and
stressful, knowing there is a communi
ty there to support them is especially
helpful."
Fryberg, who is Native American,
agreed that minority students feel en

couraged when they can connect with
others in their community. "It is more
than simply that you deserve to be
here. It is also a matter of whether you
feel people like you belong here and
are made to feel welcome."
While at Stanford, Fryberg benefit
ed from the large presence of Native
Americans within the student popula

tion. Recent estimates suggest that
there are nearly 200 undergraduate
and graduate students representing
more than 50 tribes at Stanford. The
community is proportionately larger
than at other universities.
