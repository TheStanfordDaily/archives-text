### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping in the NCAA rankings
from N0.4 to N0.7 as a result of a loss to Ari
zona, the Stanford women's swimming and
diving team (7-2, 3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
had to turn out a pair of victories this week
end to maintain its momentum leading up
to the Pac-10 Conference Championships at
the end of the month. Thanks to stellar per
formances from several athletes, the Cardi
nal knocked off No. 4 Southern California
and No. 12 UCLA.
Friday's meet against the Bruins, which
ended in a 159-141 win for Stanford,
brought the first Cardinal diving sweep of
the season, as senior McKenze Murphy and
sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal captured wins
in the 3-meter and 1-meter competitions,
respectively. Murphy finished second in the
1-meter as well.
Junior Tara Kirk swept her specialty
events, the 100- and 200-vard breaststroke,
with times of 1 minute, .94 seconds, and
2:14.68 respectively. Sophomore Kirsten
Gilbert pulled out a pair of excellent perfor
mances in those same two events, placing sec
ond in the 100 and third in the 200.
"We expected Tara Kirk to win [the 1001",
coach Richard Quick said, "Rut when Kirsten

got second in the 100-yard breaststroke, it
was just huge for us. We needed that key sec
ond-place finish."
Sophomore Evins Cameron also con
tributed a pair of wins to the team score,
recording a time of 4:56.30 to win the 500-
yard freestyle, and a time of 10:04.42 to win
the 1000 free.
Freshman Kristen Caverly was the third
Cardinal to record two wins against UCIA,
one in the 200 individual medley and the
other in the 200 back. She also touched the
wall in third place in the 100 back, just be
hind sophomore teammate Amy Wagner.
"Kristen is one of the best swimmers in the
nation," Quick said, "She had a phenomenal
meet this weekend."
One of Stanford's freestyle specialists,
sophomore Lacey Boutwell, clocked in at
51.02 to claim victory in the 100 free.

Against the No. 12 UCLA Bruins, sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal won the 3-meter diving compe
tition and placed third in the event against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
One would imagine that the
Cardinal's outstanding meet
against UCLA would be hard to
top — until watching the team
unite for the second half of the
SoCal sweep, a 167-133 triumph
over the Trojans.
Caverly managed to outdo her
performance from the day before
by bringing in three individual
wins. She swept the 100 and 200
backstroke events and crushed the
competition in the 400 IM by more
than five seconds.
According to Quick, the win in
the 400 IM was especially "extraor
dinary" because she was swimming
against 2000 Olympian Kaitlin
Sandeno.
Kirk extended her unbeaten
NCAA streak in the 100 breast to
23, and continued her unbeaten
season in the 200. Gilbert repeated
her excellent swims from the
UCLA meet, claiming second and
third in the 100 and 200, respec
tively.
Boutwell captured another win
in the 100 free, plus a first-place fin

ish in the 50 free.
The 50 free was a Stanford
sweep, as sophomore Sarah Jones
and junior Megan Baumgartner
came in second and third behind
Boutwell.
One of the most crucial sweeps
for the Cardinal was the pair of wins
in the two relay events. Both Kirks,
Caverly, and sophomore Tami
Ransom combined to win die 400
medley relay, while Jones, Ransom,
Dana Kirk, and Boutwell teamed
up to capture victory in the 400 free
relay.
The remainder of the meet
was full of top-three finishes by
the Cardinal. The younger Kirk
and Cameron finish in the two
and three spots in the 500 free,
while Kirk also placed second in
the 200-yard butterfly. Fresh
man Laura Davis and Boutwell
finished second and third in the
100 fly. Ransom had an excellent
dual meet, contributing to the
team score with multiple top
three finishes.
The Stanford divers struggled a
bit against the Trojans, but Rosen
thal and Murphy finished second
and third respectively in 1-meter
diving, and Rosenthal ended in
third place on the 3-meter.

got second in the 100-yard breaststroke, it
was just huge for us. We needed that key sec
ond-place finish."
Sophomore Evins Cameron also con

recording a time of 4:56.30 to win the 500-
yard freestyle, and a time of 10:04.42 to win

hind sophomore teammate Amy Wagner.
"Kristen is one of the best swimmers in the
nation," Quick said, "She had a phenomenal
meet this weekend."

Against the No. 12 UCLA Bruins, sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal won the 3-meter diving compe
tition and placed third in the event against the No. 4 USC Trojans.
One would imagine that the
Cardinal's outstanding meet
against UCLA would be hard to
top — until watching the team
unite for the second half of the
SoCal sweep, a 167-133 triumph
over the Trojans.
Caverly managed to outdo her
performance from the day before
by bringing in three individual
wins. She swept the 100 and 200
backstroke events and crushed the
competition in the 400 IM by more
than five seconds.
According to Quick, the win in
the 400 IM was especially "extraor
dinary" because she was swimming
against 2000 Olympian Kaitlin
Sandeno.
Kirk extended her unbeaten
NCAA streak in the 100 breast to
23, and continued her unbeaten
season in the 200. Gilbert repeated
her excellent swims from the
UCLA meet, claiming second and
third in the 100 and 200, respec
tively.
Boutwell captured another win
in the 100 free, plus a first-place fin

ish in the 50 free.
The 50 free was a Stanford
sweep, as sophomore Sarah Jones
and junior Megan Baumgartner
came in second and third behind
Boutwell.
One of the most crucial sweeps
for the Cardinal was the pair of wins
in the two relay events. Both Kirks,
Caverly, and sophomore Tami
Ransom combined to win die 400
medley relay, while Jones, Ransom,
Dana Kirk, and Boutwell teamed
up to capture victory in the 400 free
relay.
The remainder of the meet
was full of top-three finishes by
the Cardinal. The younger Kirk
and Cameron finish in the two
and three spots in the 500 free,
while Kirk also placed second in
the 200-yard butterfly. Fresh
man Laura Davis and Boutwell
finished second and third in the
100 fly. Ransom had an excellent
dual meet, contributing to the
team score with multiple top
three finishes.
The Stanford divers struggled a
bit against the Trojans, but Rosen
thal and Murphy finished second
and third respectively in 1-meter
diving, and Rosenthal ended in
third place on the 3-meter.
