After dropping in the NCAA rankings
from N0.4 to N0.7 as a result of a loss to Ari
zona, the Stanford women's swimming and
diving team (7-2, 3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
had to turn out a pair of victories this week
end to maintain its momentum leading up
to the Pac-10 Conference Championships at
the end of the month. Thanks to stellar per
formances from several athletes, the Cardi
nal knocked off No. 4 Southern California
and No. 12 UCLA.
Friday's meet against the Bruins, which
ended in a 159-141 win for Stanford,
brought the first Cardinal diving sweep of
the season, as senior McKenze Murphy and
sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal captured wins
in the 3-meter and 1-meter competitions,
respectively. Murphy finished second in the
1-meter as well.
Junior Tara Kirk swept her specialty
events, the 100- and 200-vard breaststroke,
with times of 1 minute, .94 seconds, and
2:14.68 respectively. Sophomore Kirsten
Gilbert pulled out a pair of excellent perfor
mances in those same two events, placing sec
ond in the 100 and third in the 200.
"We expected Tara Kirk to win [the 1001",
coach Richard Quick said, "Rut when Kirsten

Sophomore Evins Cameron also con

recording a time of 4:56.30 to win the 500-
yard freestyle, and a time of 10:04.42 to win
the 1000 free.
Freshman Kristen Caverly was the third
Cardinal to record two wins against UCIA,
one in the 200 individual medley and the
other in the 200 back. She also touched the
wall in third place in the 100 back, just be
hind sophomore teammate Amy Wagner.
"Kristen is one of the best swimmers in the
nation," Quick said, "She had a phenomenal
meet this weekend."
One of Stanford's freestyle specialists,
sophomore Lacey Boutwell, clocked in at
51.02 to claim victory in the 100 free.
