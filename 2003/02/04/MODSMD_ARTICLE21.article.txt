It must be tough for Beavers to
find their efforts dammed.
After defeating powerhouse
UCLA the previous week, the No.
12 Oregon State women's gymnas
tics team (5-3, 1-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference) watched as No. 9 Stanford
(7-1, 2-0) edged past them to win
the Cardinal's home opener on
Friday 196.575 to 196.275.

187.825
vs. UCLA, Friday, 7:30 p.m.

En route to victory in the four
way meet, Stanford also bulldozed
over San Jose State and Seattle Pa
cific, who fell in third and fourth
with scores of 193.425 and
187.825, respectively.
"I am so excited about the po
tential of this team," head coach
Kristen Smyth said. "OSU is a
tough rival in our conference and
the meet was a nail biter."
The Cardinal began the night
with a dazzling performance on
the vaulting table, in which junior
Lise Leveille scored a career-high
9.9, good for first on the appara
tus. Junior Kendall Beck was on
Leveille's heels with a 9.875, in
keeping with the 2002 All-America
honors she earned on vault.
"We incorporated five vaults
with 10.0 start values into the line
up," assistant coach Larissa
Fontaine said. "Adding that diffi
culty and hitting our vaults was a
great way to start our first home
meet." At the end of the first rota
tion, the Cardinal shot ahead at
49.225 as the Beavers totaled a
48.8 on the uneven bars, forced to
count a fall when All-American
Elizabeth Jillson put her hands
down on her double layout dis
mount.
"Coming into the meet, we were
really focused on displaying a lot of
energy," junior Caroline Fluhrer
said. "I think we definitely met that

goal and it showed through in our
performances."
The Cardinal's consistent exe
cution continued on bars, with
three athletes tallying 9.875 or bet
ter. Freshman Natalie Foley led
the attack with a 9.9 that took sec
ond on the event.
But the Beavers would not be
quelled and rallied on the floor ex-

ercise to come within 0.05 of the
win at the end of the third rotation.
Tanya Ricioli, a 2000 All-American
on floor, delivered a career-high
9.925 as OSU went six-for-six on
the event and counted nothing less
than a 9.825.
On beam, Beck scored a 9.925
at the top of the lineup and per
formed three layouts in a row for

the first time in competition â€”a
skill few gymnasts in the country
can execute. Junior Lindsay Wing
chalked up a 9.975 for the second
consecutive week and fourth time
in her career.
But things got a bit shaky on
beam and the Cardinal was forced
to count a fall, allowing OSU a
chance to win as Stanford pre
pared to perform on floor.
"On floor, we saw some of the
best individual performances
we've had all year," assistant coach
Steve Ohel said. "Lise stepped up
with a really strong performance."
Taking advantage of the sold
out home crowd's energy, Stan
ford's floor lineup delivered su
perlative performances, exempli
fied by Leveille's 9.925.
Fans also witnessed the return
from injury of freshman Jessica
Louie on vault, sophomore Mandy
Delgado on floor, and senior
Kelsey Stillinger on beam.
"Jessica's vault was awesome,
and having Kelsey and Mandy
back gave the whole team a big lift
and made our home meet that
much more exciting," Beck said.
Leveille doubled her collection
of first-place finishes this season by
taking vault, floor, and the all
around, as Wing secured the title
on beam. First on bars went to San
Jose State's Shirla Choy, the lone
bright spot of the Spartans'
evening. Beck took second on
vault and beam to round out the
Cardinal's solid performance.
OSU's Ricioli discovered first
hand how difficult it is to knock off
the Cardinal as she tied for eighth
on vault with Louie, second on
bars with Foley, fourth on beam
with Leveille and Fluhrer, and first
both on floor and in the all-around
with Leveille.
Stanford hopes to keep up its
undefeated conference record
when it batdes No. 5 UCLA at
home on Feb. 7 at 7:30 p.m.
"We're trying to get our
strongest lineup together for
UCLA, but our team is looking so
good right now," Smyth said. "I
can't wait for what the rest of the
season will bring."
