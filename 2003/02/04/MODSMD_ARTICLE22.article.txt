# Fresno State no match for No. 1 Card
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Both a strong wind and a Fresno State
team loaded with talented foreigners
were no match for the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team last Saturday at
the Taube Family Tennis Center.

Women's Tennis
Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 6, Fresno State 1
at Indoor Championships, Feb 6-9.

The Cardinal had no trouble dispatch
ing the No. 26 Bulldogs, which featured
players from France, Croatia and Switzer
land. Stanford cruised to a 6-1 victory by
winning five singles matches and the dou
bles point.
Impressive performances were con
tributed by every Cardinal player, includ
ing sophomore Erin Burdette, who did
not appear to be hampered by a pulled
muscle as she quickly defeated Lucia
Sainz, 6-2, 6-1, at the No. 3 singles posi
tion.
"I strained something when we had
the tournament in Las Vegas, so I took
some time off after that to let it heal," Bur
dette said, adding that the injury, "did not
affect my play."
Straight-set singles victories were also
turned in by junior Lauren Barnikow at
No. 2 and sophomore Story Tweedie-
Yates at No. 6. Barnikow used accurate
shot placement in her defeat over Vlat
ka Jovanovic, 6-3, 6-2, while Tweedie-
Yates overpowered Kristy Mcßae en
route to a 6-3, 6-4 win. In addition, ju
nior Emilia Anderson was a 6-1, 7-6 (4)

winner over Kathrin Winterhalter.
"I think it was a great showing for the
first match of the season," Anderson
said. "No one knows what to expect, and
we have been looking forward to the
first 'real' team match for so long, that
everyone wanted to perform well and
play well for each other, and I think we
did that."
Contributing a lengthy three-set sin
gle victory was freshman Alice Barnes,
who beat Lucia Tallo 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
Barnes was up a break early in the sec
ond set but could not hold her lead. She
eventually wore down her opponent in
the final set.
The only Fresno State victory oc
curred at No. 1 singles. In a hard-fought
three-set match, Chloe Carlotti, No. 27
in the ITA fall singles rankings, re
bounded from a first set loss to take the
victory over Stanford freshman Amber
Liu. After losing a seesaw second set, the
Stanford freshman overcame a 2-4 third
set deficit and had chances to break Car
lotti's serve at 4-4. The left handed Bull
dog, who hails from France, won the
final two games for the victory, however.
"Amber had a very tough match," said
Stanford head coach Lele Forood. "Chloe
is a very cagey player and really came alive
in the second set.'
Stanford kicked off the match by win
ning the all-important doubles point,
which set the tone of tilings to come.
The top Cardinal doubles team of
Barnikow and Burdette defeated Sainz
and Tallo, 8-2, while Barnes and Liu beat
Carlotti and Winterhalter, 8-3. Anderson
and Tweedie-Yates were defeated by Jo

vanovic and Mcßae, 9-7, but by that time
the point had already been secured by
Stanford.
The Cardinal was fighting a second,
more uncontrollable opponent through
out the day, though—gusty winds dis
guised by a sunny sky that no doubt al
tered the ball movement on many shots
and serve tosses.
"The weather wasn't the nicest. It was
warm, but there was wind, and the air was
chilly," Burdette said.
"It just makes shots harder to hit be
cause you set up too early sometimes,
thinking the ball will go one way, and
then the wind either stops it shorter, or
blows it another way, so it makes it tough
to set up," Anderson said. "You really
have to concentrate hard on moving
your feet to get up to the ball and not
waiting for it to get to you, because you
want to hit it before the wind has a
chance to get a hold of it."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal was able to
overcome the elements and the Bulldogs
to post an impressive victory over a
ranked opponent in its first dual match of
the spring season. As a result, the team
was able to establish a feel for playing to
gether in anticipation of the Team Indoor
Championships next week.
"So much of team matches are who has
the most heart and toughness to pull out
tough matches, and I think we all showed
a lot of fight today, win or lose," Anderson
said. "Overall, I think the first match is al
ways tough, and combined with the tricky
conditions today, I would say it was a great
start to the season, and everyone is excit
ed for the matches to come."

Yates at No. 6. Barnikow used accurate
shot placement in her defeat over Vlat
ka Jovanovic, 6-3, 6-2, while Tweedie-
Yates overpowered Kristy Mcßae en
route to a 6-3, 6-4 win. In addition, ju
nior Emilia Anderson was a 6-1, 7-6 (4)

winner over Kathrin Winterhalter.
"I think it was a great showing for the
first match of the season," Anderson
said. "No one knows what to expect, and
we have been looking forward to the
first 'real' team match for so long, that
everyone wanted to perform well and
play well for each other, and I think we
did that."
Contributing a lengthy three-set sin
gle victory was freshman Alice Barnes,
who beat Lucia Tallo 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
Barnes was up a break early in the sec
ond set but could not hold her lead. She
eventually wore down her opponent in
the final set.
The only Fresno State victory oc
curred at No. 1 singles. In a hard-fought
three-set match, Chloe Carlotti, No. 27
in the ITA fall singles rankings, re
bounded from a first set loss to take the
victory over Stanford freshman Amber
Liu. After losing a seesaw second set, the
Stanford freshman overcame a 2-4 third
set deficit and had chances to break Car
lotti's serve at 4-4. The left handed Bull
dog, who hails from France, won the
final two games for the victory, however.
"Amber had a very tough match," said
Stanford head coach Lele Forood. "Chloe
is a very cagey player and really came alive
in the second set.'
Stanford kicked off the match by win
ning the all-important doubles point,
which set the tone of tilings to come.
The top Cardinal doubles team of
Barnikow and Burdette defeated Sainz
and Tallo, 8-2, while Barnes and Liu beat
Carlotti and Winterhalter, 8-3. Anderson
and Tweedie-Yates were defeated by Jo

vanovic and Mcßae, 9-7, but by that time
the point had already been secured by
Stanford.
The Cardinal was fighting a second,
more uncontrollable opponent through
out the day, though—gusty winds dis
guised by a sunny sky that no doubt al
tered the ball movement on many shots
and serve tosses.
"The weather wasn't the nicest. It was
warm, but there was wind, and the air was
chilly," Burdette said.
"It just makes shots harder to hit be
cause you set up too early sometimes,
thinking the ball will go one way, and
then the wind either stops it shorter, or
blows it another way, so it makes it tough
to set up," Anderson said. "You really
have to concentrate hard on moving
your feet to get up to the ball and not
waiting for it to get to you, because you
want to hit it before the wind has a
chance to get a hold of it."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal was able to
overcome the elements and the Bulldogs
to post an impressive victory over a
ranked opponent in its first dual match of
the spring season. As a result, the team
was able to establish a feel for playing to
gether in anticipation of the Team Indoor
Championships next week.
"So much of team matches are who has
the most heart and toughness to pull out
tough matches, and I think we all showed
a lot of fight today, win or lose," Anderson
said. "Overall, I think the first match is al
ways tough, and combined with the tricky
conditions today, I would say it was a great
start to the season, and everyone is excit
ed for the matches to come."
