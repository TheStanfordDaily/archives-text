lazy, so a lot of times it is me visiting them,"
he said.
Sethi, who was appreciative of Faisan's
central location, joked, "I'd kill myself if I
was in Yost."
One of the drawbacks of spending fall
quarter abroad is coming back to campus

It was the day before winter quarter
classes began, and junior Ramit Sethi was
as ready as anyone to be back on campus.
After a quarter abroad at Stanford in Ox
ford, traveling to India during winter
break and spending only a short amount
of time at home in Sacramento, he was ex
cited to be back.
Despite a housing assignment in
Faisan, a four-class dorm housing the
Structured Liberal Education program —
hardly the holy grail for many upperclass
men seeking a place on the Row — Sethi
remained open-minded about the rest of
his year. Like many students who come
back from abroad, it was the luck of the
draw that determined where, and with
whom, he would end up living.
"It was a coincidence that my room
mate ended up being someone who I stud
ied with at Oxford," he said, adding that it
was nice to already know someone in the
dorm.
"It feels good to be back," Sethi said.
"There's a pumped up, 'freshman year'
feeling. I've been here almost a month and
I feel really comfortable."
"Being back and being able to see my
friends is probably the only thing that gets
me out of my chair," he said. He said that
while all of his friends are now spread out
across campus, it is not a chore to make the
effort to see people. "My friends are pretty

mid-year, moving into a random hous
ing assignment and trying to start from
scratch while everything else on campus
is in full swing. Compounding this is the
fact that students who study abroad often
don't get to choose their roommates
upon return and find their best friends
and former drawmates dispersed
through campus.
Anna Forgie, a junior now living in
Yost, was happy with her assignment after
coming back from a quarter in the Stan
ford in Washington program. "I got really
lucky with a two-room double," she said.
"But it's a litde strange when everyone in
the house already knows each other and
looks at you with sideways glances that say,
'Who is diis person?' "
Forgie had mixed feelings about com
ing back to campus. "It was a phenomenal
experience," she said. "By far the best ex
perience I've had at Stanford."

Forgie, who worked full-time as an in
tern for the Senate Judiciary Committee
while also taking 17 units, described the
experience of coming back to Stanford as,
"at first, jarring."
"It was really good to be back, see
friends and catch up with people, but it

'Who is this person?' "

definitely was a transition," she said.
Though Washington certainly wasn't
another country, for Forgie, the culture
there was vasdy different from Stanford's.
"There, I switched mentalities and
everything was so focused on politics.
There were so many young people who
were ambitious and excited, and it was
easy to get really caught up on that."
While Forgie had such a great time in
Washington and hopes to return some
day, she said that one of the best parts of
being back at Stanford was seeing friends
and being comfortable with Stanford life.
Garrick Chak, a senior who studied at
Stanford in Oxford, had a slighdy differ
ent perspective because he was the only se
nior in the Stanford in Oxford program.
"It was a tradeoff leaving during my se
nior year," he said, since a lot of people
worry about jobs. "But it was good to be
away from that stress. Now, I feel a step be

hind in that process, but the tutorial expe
rience at Oxford made it all worth it."
Chak, who for the first time in his col
lege years had a single at Oxford, is now
living in a two-room double in East. "I'm in
a quiet place," he said, noting the differ
ence between the freshman atmosphere
he experienced abroad when he knew few
people going into the Oxford program.
"Here, it is strange being away from my
drawmates, but we still see each other."
Students going abroad must enter the
housing draw separately, and if they chose
to draw with others, must find people who
are also returning at the same time. Often,
students studying through non-Stanford
programs are not guaranteed housing
and go unassigned.
Andi Hansen, a junior who spent last
quarter touring the world through the Se
mester at Sea program, was surprised by
the realization she had about living with
friends. Hansen walked on to a triple in
Mirrielees, and said she was happy with
the walk on process.
"It's strange not to see my drawmates
and friends everyday, but we all agree that
we get along better when we live apart,"
she said.
She described her experience abroad as
probably the best thing she had ever done
in her life and was happy to have the op
portunity to travel with people her own
age. After visiting 12 countries, including
South Africa, Vietnam and India, she said,
"I think that seeing more of the world

opened my eyes, and I can now see Stan
ford for the bubble that it is."
Susan Christopher, academic program
officer with Overseas Studies, said that
there is currendy no formal or informal
program to assist students in their transi
tions back to Stanford, though she would
like to see something in the future.
"Among different kinds of models that
we might think about for our re-entry pro
gram would be academic courses where
students can reflect on their experiences
abroad but in the context of an academic
topic," Christopher said.
She acknowledged that there are many
issues that concern students when they re
turn from abroad and was especially inter
ested in reverse culture shock.
"There's an untapped opportunity for
students to make even more of an oppor
tunity from what they've learned over
seas," she said.
For Sethi, it seemed like adjusting back
to life on the Farm wouldn't take long. He
has already succeeded in putting on a
dorm program in personal finance and in
vestment banking and has relished the op
portunity to share the experience of being
excited about Stanford with his dorm
mates. He said that as an upperclassman in
a predominantly freshman dorm, he feels
like a staff member, but without the re
sponsibility and many of the rewards.
"Oxford was an experience to remem
ber," he said. "But at Stanford, I feel 100
percent at home."
