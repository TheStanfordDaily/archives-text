### KIM-MAI CUTLER DAILY CALIFORNIAN (UC-BERKELEY 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.â€”The Depart
ment of Energy released its most searing attack on
Los Alamos National Laboratory on Thursday, con
firming $1.5 million in missing property and accus
ing the lab of hiding information from investigators.
The Inspector General's report, though stopping
short of calling UC-Berkeley actions a cover-up, may
further jeopardize UC-Berkeley's $1.7 billion con
tract with the nuclear weapons lab.
It is the first independent confirmation of mis
management at the lab.
The report found that lab officials "obscured seri
ous property management and security problems."
Lab officials discouraged employees from speak
ing out about problems at Los Alamos, according to
the report.
Employees received memos urging them to "re
sist the temptation to 'spill your guts'" and saying
that "finger pointing will just make the program
look bad," the report stated.
The report also criticized the lab's property man
agement, citing a "substantial degree of dysfunc
tion."
Lab officials did not hold employees accountable
for lost property, the report stated, and new equip
ment was delivered to "open spaces with little or no
security."
