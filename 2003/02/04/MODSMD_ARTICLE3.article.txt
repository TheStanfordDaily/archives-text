# Bush address yields mixed student reaction

### TORI BABIN 
Editor's Note: This article is part of a
weekly series investigating the relationship
between the Stanford community and the
potential war in Iraq.

A week aft£r President George W.
Bush delivered his annual State of the
Union Address, student opinion toward
war with Iraq has been largely unaffected,
despite the influential impact it may have
had on the general public.
In his address last Tuesday, Bush artic
ulated his plans for ensuring Iraqi disar

mament, stating, "[L]et there be no mis
understanding: If Saddam Hussein does
not fully disarm, for the safety of our peo
ple and for the peace of the world, we will
lead a coalition to disarm him."
Bush's plan elicited a mixed reaction
from the Stanford student body. Though
some students viewed the State of the
Union as an appropriate outline for the
United States' foreign policy, others re
mained doubtful about the validity of
Bush's declarations.
Senior Josh Benson, editor in chief of
the Stanford Progressive, said, "Speeches
aren't what changes students' minds —

we want to see details, numbers, more so
phisticated arguments."
Freshman Mojan Movassate com
mented that the population of student
viewers interested in the address likely al
ready held resolute views on the issues at
hand and were therefore probably not
going to change their opinions because of
his speech.
For the most part, students did not see
Bush's comments on Tuesday as an out
right declaration of war, but rather a "de
claration of the intention of going to war,"

said senior Calvin Miaw of the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice.
"The address seems to have
shifted the debate from whether or
not we should go to war with Iraq
to when we will be going to war
with Iraq," Movassate said.
However, some students did
see the address as a de facto decla
ration of war with Iraq.
With the growing immediacy of
conflict, "You can almost hear the
tanks of the liberators rolling into
Baghdad" said sophomore Joseph
Fairbanks, co-founder of the Stan
ford College Republicans.
The address also stimulated
discussion about the United
States' approach to conflict as one
of necessary defense rather than
unmerited aggression. Bob
Sensenbrenner, communications
director for the Stanford College
Republicans, said that Bush's
statements did not declare war but
rather, "made it clear that the
United States does not wish to
wage war, but will show [its] re
solve when a brutal dictator prolif
erates weapons whose horrors are
hardly imaginable."
Bush's address did influence
some students to consider Iraq a

more imminent threat, but did
not necessarily lead these stu
dents to believe that war was a
necessary end.
"I went in with a very skeptical
view on the war, but if what [Bush ]
says is true, then there is more rea
son for concern [about the danger
posed by Iraq]," said senior Jing
Cai. However, I still believe that in
vading would just give [Hussein] a
reason to use what weapons he
does possess."
Many students agreed with
Bush's statements that America's
next step is dependent upon the
actions of Hussein. Benson said
that Hussein's avoidance of disar
mament should not be tolerated,
and if he continues to impede in
spections and if the United States
receives clear evidence of this,
then, "[W]ar is mandated — uni
laterally if necessary."
However, for Benson, Bush's
"open and shut" assumptions that
Hussein is entirely not cooperative
are not appropriate; he advocates
continued inspections as long as
we can safely investigate Iraq's real
weapons capability, so that Hus
sein can cooperatively change his
weapon status and so that the
United States can prevent war.
And while most students sup
port Bush's call for the United
States to "seek peace" and "strive
for peace," some also agreed with
Bush that an active reform on

Iraq's part is imperative if peace is
to be maintained.
"Should Saddam make any
overtures whatsoever toward co
operation, the US will gladly avert
armed conflict," said sophomore
Piotr Kosicki, the incoming editor
in chief of the Stanford Review.
Students also saw this address as
an appeal not only to U.S. citizens,
but also as a warning to the gov
ernment and population in Iraq
about the mounting threat of a po
tential conflict.
"The Iraq portion of the address
was meant as an address to Saddam
and the Iraqi government to signal
that they have very little time left to
comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions if they want to avoid los
ing power," Fairbanks said.
Many students expressed
concern over how other coun
tries would view an American
military initiative.
Miaw commented that "Bush,
as well as [British Prime Minister
Tony] Blair, still has to contend
with domestic and international
opinion on this."
Ultimately, Bush's comments
stimulated discussion, as students
questioned the feasibility and
moral imperative of his ideas. Re
gardless of what side of the politi
cal line students were on, there was
an expressed, common hope that
this disarmament can be achieved
as peacefully as possible.

Editor's Note: This article is part of a
weekly series investigating the relationship
between the Stanford community and the
potential war in Iraq.

A week aft£r President George W.
Bush delivered his annual State of the
Union Address, student opinion toward
war with Iraq has been largely unaffected,
despite the influential impact it may have
had on the general public.
In his address last Tuesday, Bush artic
ulated his plans for ensuring Iraqi disar

mament, stating, "[L]et there be no mis
understanding: If Saddam Hussein does
not fully disarm, for the safety of our peo
ple and for the peace of the world, we will
lead a coalition to disarm him."
Bush's plan elicited a mixed reaction
from the Stanford student body. Though
some students viewed the State of the
Union as an appropriate outline for the
United States' foreign policy, others re
mained doubtful about the validity of
Bush's declarations.
Senior Josh Benson, editor in chief of
the Stanford Progressive, said, "Speeches
aren't what changes students' minds —

we want to see details, numbers, more so
phisticated arguments."
Freshman Mojan Movassate com
mented that the population of student
viewers interested in the address likely al
ready held resolute views on the issues at
hand and were therefore probably not
going to change their opinions because of
his speech.
For the most part, students did not see
Bush's comments on Tuesday as an out
right declaration of war, but rather a "de
claration of the intention of going to war,"

said senior Calvin Miaw of the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice.
"The address seems to have
shifted the debate from whether or
not we should go to war with Iraq
to when we will be going to war
with Iraq," Movassate said.
However, some students did
see the address as a de facto decla
ration of war with Iraq.
With the growing immediacy of
conflict, "You can almost hear the
tanks of the liberators rolling into
Baghdad" said sophomore Joseph
Fairbanks, co-founder of the Stan
ford College Republicans.
The address also stimulated
discussion about the United
States' approach to conflict as one
of necessary defense rather than
unmerited aggression. Bob
Sensenbrenner, communications
director for the Stanford College
Republicans, said that Bush's
statements did not declare war but
rather, "made it clear that the
United States does not wish to
wage war, but will show [its] re
solve when a brutal dictator prolif
erates weapons whose horrors are
hardly imaginable."
Bush's address did influence
some students to consider Iraq a

more imminent threat, but did
not necessarily lead these stu
dents to believe that war was a
necessary end.
"I went in with a very skeptical
view on the war, but if what [Bush ]
says is true, then there is more rea
son for concern [about the danger
posed by Iraq]," said senior Jing
Cai. However, I still believe that in
vading would just give [Hussein] a
reason to use what weapons he
does possess."
Many students agreed with
Bush's statements that America's
next step is dependent upon the
actions of Hussein. Benson said
that Hussein's avoidance of disar
mament should not be tolerated,
and if he continues to impede in
spections and if the United States
receives clear evidence of this,
then, "[W]ar is mandated — uni
laterally if necessary."
However, for Benson, Bush's
"open and shut" assumptions that
Hussein is entirely not cooperative
are not appropriate; he advocates
continued inspections as long as
we can safely investigate Iraq's real
weapons capability, so that Hus
sein can cooperatively change his
weapon status and so that the
United States can prevent war.
And while most students sup
port Bush's call for the United
States to "seek peace" and "strive
for peace," some also agreed with
Bush that an active reform on

Iraq's part is imperative if peace is
to be maintained.
"Should Saddam make any
overtures whatsoever toward co
operation, the US will gladly avert
armed conflict," said sophomore
Piotr Kosicki, the incoming editor
in chief of the Stanford Review.
Students also saw this address as
an appeal not only to U.S. citizens,
but also as a warning to the gov
ernment and population in Iraq
about the mounting threat of a po
tential conflict.
"The Iraq portion of the address
was meant as an address to Saddam
and the Iraqi government to signal
that they have very little time left to
comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions if they want to avoid los
ing power," Fairbanks said.
Many students expressed
concern over how other coun
tries would view an American
military initiative.
Miaw commented that "Bush,
as well as [British Prime Minister
Tony] Blair, still has to contend
with domestic and international
opinion on this."
Ultimately, Bush's comments
stimulated discussion, as students
questioned the feasibility and
moral imperative of his ideas. Re
gardless of what side of the politi
cal line students were on, there was
an expressed, common hope that
this disarmament can be achieved
as peacefully as possible.
