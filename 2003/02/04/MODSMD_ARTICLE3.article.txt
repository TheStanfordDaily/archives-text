Editor's Note: This article is part of a
weekly series investigating the relationship
between the Stanford community and the
potential war in Iraq.

A week aft£r President George W.
Bush delivered his annual State of the
Union Address, student opinion toward
war with Iraq has been largely unaffected,
despite the influential impact it may have
had on the general public.
In his address last Tuesday, Bush artic
ulated his plans for ensuring Iraqi disar

mament, stating, "[L]et there be no mis
understanding: If Saddam Hussein does
not fully disarm, for the safety of our peo
ple and for the peace of the world, we will
lead a coalition to disarm him."
Bush's plan elicited a mixed reaction
from the Stanford student body. Though
some students viewed the State of the
Union as an appropriate outline for the
United States' foreign policy, others re
mained doubtful about the validity of
Bush's declarations.
Senior Josh Benson, editor in chief of
the Stanford Progressive, said, "Speeches
aren't what changes students' minds —

we want to see details, numbers, more so
phisticated arguments."
Freshman Mojan Movassate com
mented that the population of student
viewers interested in the address likely al
ready held resolute views on the issues at
hand and were therefore probably not
going to change their opinions because of
his speech.
For the most part, students did not see
Bush's comments on Tuesday as an out
right declaration of war, but rather a "de
claration of the intention of going to war,"
