# International spotlight
## Venezuela 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is the sixth in a weekly series of interviews
with international students at Stanford meant to heighten
awareness of issues of social and political importance around
the world.
This past weekend, The Daily sat down to dis
cuss Venezuelan politics with second-year
chemistry doctoral student Eileen Jackson,
president of the Venezuelan Association at
Stanford, and fifth-year geophysics doctoral student
Sandra Vega, a member of the association.
Venezuela emerged with Colombia and Ecuador
from the collapse of Sim6n Bolivar's post-Spanish colo
nial Gran Columbia in 1830. Venezuela has overcome
a long line of military strongmen and economic insta
bility, largely with money earned through its vast oil
fields. It has successfully implemented many political
reforms and attained, until recendy, a remarkable level
of economic stability.
Democratically elected governments have been in
power since 1959. Today, the populist, leftist President
Hugo Chavez is losing his once-solid support among
Venezuelans — having survived one coup on his gov
ernment, Chavez and his supporters are now con
fronting a popular two-month-old national strike led
by the state oil company and, until yesterday, other
business leaders.
The oil strike goes on even as the Chavez govern
ment continues to increase oil production without
company involvement.
Yesterday, opposition leaders called off the general
strike in response to the worsening economy and me
diation efforts by a group of countries including the
United States.
The Daily: The United States buys a lot of its oil from
Venezuela, a member of OPEC, and it affects the oil
prices and industries there. Many U.S. oil companies
are invested in Venezuela, or at least used to be. How
do U.S. and other foreign interests affect Venezuela?
Sandra Vega: Everything related to oil is [run by] the
state. It's managed by the state. Sometimes they have
deals with other international oil companies. These
companies go to Venezuela, they work there, and they
have to pay taxes, and, depending on how much they
produce, they have to give some [oil] to the govern
ment. You can say it's an investment, but everything is

controlled by the state.
TD: What do you think about President Hugo Chavez
as a leader, as a person and about his economic plans?
Eileenjackson: I don't like him at all. I think he's a very
resentful person. He's very aggressive, he has very vio
lent speech. His economic plan is a mysteiy to me. He's
always talking about his revolution, he's always talking
about feeding the poor and making their lives better.
What I see in Venezuela is more poverty since he's been
in government. Every year I go home and I can see it
deteriorating. Unemployment is terrible. Chavez sets
himself up there like he's some new world leader, like
he's Jesus Christ, like he's Simon Bolivar, like he's
going to change the world. But then it's mosdy
rhetoric, there's no real plan. Some of the things he's
done, some of the social programs have been more of a
corruption case. He's bankrupted the national bank.

[Chavez's government] has built houses [for the poor],
but the houses are falling apart. He talks a!>out public
education, but there's not enough money going into it.
He says he's building more schools, but I don't see
them. It's turned into more of an indoctrination sys
tem, where they're re-writing history. I think it's dan
gerous because people actually believe in him, because
lie doesn't have a plan — nothing different than com
munism, nothing new.
TD: So do you hold him responsible for the problems
that Venezuela c urrently has?
EJ: I don't think Chavez is responsible for all the
problems. I think the problems are from the past and
they've been growing. We've had a lot of corruption
and a lot of inefficient governments, but instead of
solving these problems, he's making them worse.
He's created a lot of hate among classes that hadn't

been there before ... in his speeches, he tells the
poor people that they're poor because [the rich] ex
ploited them. There's still a belief that the country is
rich and it hasn't been divided well. But it's not only
distribution of wealth, it's also that you have to work,
that you have to create wealth, and he doesn't really
have a plan for creating more wealth, or creating
sources of employment, there's something that's
long-term or long-standing. He hasn't given any se
curity, and no one invests in Venezuela nowadays.
He talks about nationalizing businesses and that
doesn't help, either.
SV: Chavez took advantage of a very important histor
ical moment in Venezuela. The people were tired of
the corrupt political parties that had been governing
the country for the last 40 years, and he promised to
help the situation. Many people from the middle class
es, especially who leaned towards the left, voted for

him. He had a lot of support from people in different
political parties. He tried to put everything in his favor
to stay in power fora very long time — he changed the
constitution — but in the years that he's been in gov
ernment, he hasn't done a lot. He does a lot of talking,
like every day on the television, but not about impor
tant things, and he has been very insulting to people
who don't support him. Now the private media doesn't
support him, and he does not want to tolerate this.
EJ: As time progressed, it became more and more ob
vious that he was becoming more and more authori
tarian. At the beginning, it wasn't so obvious, but any
one in the government who would criticize or say
something against him would be removed from office,
and that's been happening more and more lately.
SV: He was elected democratically, but now he's acting
like a dictator.

TD: Could you talk about how you as individuals —
your family backgrounds and work experience, such
as experience in the national oil company — relate to
how you perceive Chavez.
SV: I worked for PDVSA, the national oil company, I
don't work there anymore, but I have a lot of friends in
the oil company, which gives me a different perspective
on what's going on. It is a very polarized situation now,
and even though I don't agree with Chavez's behavior,
the way he has done things, at the same time I also don't
agree with those who call themselves the opposition
and the things they have also done.
TD: Are there noticeable shifts taking place in public
opinion?
SV: Venezuela is in a process right now where the peo
ple are learning, where the people who used to be ap
athetic about these sorts of issues are out on the streets
protesting. They realize that they have to participate to
improve the situation. But the problems that we're fac
ing will take years to fix.
SV: There are many students, especially [studying]
geophysics from Venezuela, especially from PDVSA.
They have scholarships.
EJ: The company is paying for them. Scholarships
from PDVSA and their affiliated consortiums
SV: No one knows what is going to happen now with
the scholarships because Chavez has taken control of
PD VSA and is filing a lot of people. I know at least three
people who went to Stanford, who got their master's
degree here, who are fired. They are some of the thou
sands of people who are fired. No one knows what the
strategy is that Chavez and his supporters are using, ex
cept that those who stay in the street protesting him are
fired. He says he's only firing managers, but that's not
true, he's firing people who don't manage anything.
They're managing PDVSA right now in a way that no
body understands. People are being fired who have
been in charge of paying the scholarships for the peo
ple at Stanford.
EJ: llie people that are at Stanford right now don't
know what is going to happen.

Stanford, and fifth-year geophysics doctoral student
Sandra Vega, a member of the association.
Venezuela emerged with Colombia and Ecuador
from the collapse of Sim6n Bolivar's post-Spanish colo
nial Gran Columbia in 1830. Venezuela has overcome
a long line of military strongmen and economic insta
bility, largely with money earned through its vast oil
fields. It has successfully implemented many political
reforms and attained, until recendy, a remarkable level
of economic stability.
Democratically elected governments have been in
power since 1959. Today, the populist, leftist President
Hugo Chavez is losing his once-solid support among
Venezuelans — having survived one coup on his gov
ernment, Chavez and his supporters are now con
fronting a popular two-month-old national strike led
by the state oil company and, until yesterday, other
business leaders.
The oil strike goes on even as the Chavez govern
ment continues to increase oil production without
company involvement.
Yesterday, opposition leaders called off the general
strike in response to the worsening economy and me
diation efforts by a group of countries including the
United States.
The Daily: The United States buys a lot of its oil from
Venezuela, a member of OPEC, and it affects the oil
prices and industries there. Many U.S. oil companies
are invested in Venezuela, or at least used to be. How
do U.S. and other foreign interests affect Venezuela?
Sandra Vega: Everything related to oil is [run by] the
state. It's managed by the state. Sometimes they have
deals with other international oil companies. These
companies go to Venezuela, they work there, and they
have to pay taxes, and, depending on how much they
produce, they have to give some [oil] to the govern
ment. You can say it's an investment, but everything is

controlled by the state.
TD: What do you think about President Hugo Chavez
as a leader, as a person and about his economic plans?
Eileenjackson: I don't like him at all. I think he's a very
resentful person. He's very aggressive, he has very vio
lent speech. His economic plan is a mysteiy to me. He's
always talking about his revolution, he's always talking
about feeding the poor and making their lives better.
What I see in Venezuela is more poverty since he's been
in government. Every year I go home and I can see it
deteriorating. Unemployment is terrible. Chavez sets
himself up there like he's some new world leader, like
he's Jesus Christ, like he's Simon Bolivar, like he's
going to change the world. But then it's mosdy
rhetoric, there's no real plan. Some of the things he's
done, some of the social programs have been more of a
corruption case. He's bankrupted the national bank.

[Chavez's government] has built houses [for the poor],
but the houses are falling apart. He talks a!>out public
education, but there's not enough money going into it.
He says he's building more schools, but I don't see
them. It's turned into more of an indoctrination sys
tem, where they're re-writing history. I think it's dan
gerous because people actually believe in him, because
lie doesn't have a plan — nothing different than com
munism, nothing new.
TD: So do you hold him responsible for the problems
that Venezuela c urrently has?
EJ: I don't think Chavez is responsible for all the
problems. I think the problems are from the past and
they've been growing. We've had a lot of corruption
and a lot of inefficient governments, but instead of
solving these problems, he's making them worse.
He's created a lot of hate among classes that hadn't

been there before ... in his speeches, he tells the
poor people that they're poor because [the rich] ex
ploited them. There's still a belief that the country is
rich and it hasn't been divided well. But it's not only
distribution of wealth, it's also that you have to work,
that you have to create wealth, and he doesn't really
have a plan for creating more wealth, or creating
sources of employment, there's something that's
long-term or long-standing. He hasn't given any se
curity, and no one invests in Venezuela nowadays.
He talks about nationalizing businesses and that
doesn't help, either.
SV: Chavez took advantage of a very important histor
ical moment in Venezuela. The people were tired of
the corrupt political parties that had been governing
the country for the last 40 years, and he promised to
help the situation. Many people from the middle class
es, especially who leaned towards the left, voted for

him. He had a lot of support from people in different
political parties. He tried to put everything in his favor
to stay in power fora very long time — he changed the
constitution — but in the years that he's been in gov
ernment, he hasn't done a lot. He does a lot of talking,
like every day on the television, but not about impor
tant things, and he has been very insulting to people
who don't support him. Now the private media doesn't
support him, and he does not want to tolerate this.
EJ: As time progressed, it became more and more ob
vious that he was becoming more and more authori
tarian. At the beginning, it wasn't so obvious, but any
one in the government who would criticize or say
something against him would be removed from office,
and that's been happening more and more lately.
SV: He was elected democratically, but now he's acting
like a dictator.

TD: Could you talk about how you as individuals —
your family backgrounds and work experience, such
as experience in the national oil company — relate to
how you perceive Chavez.
SV: I worked for PDVSA, the national oil company, I
don't work there anymore, but I have a lot of friends in
the oil company, which gives me a different perspective
on what's going on. It is a very polarized situation now,
and even though I don't agree with Chavez's behavior,
the way he has done things, at the same time I also don't
agree with those who call themselves the opposition
and the things they have also done.
TD: Are there noticeable shifts taking place in public
opinion?
SV: Venezuela is in a process right now where the peo
ple are learning, where the people who used to be ap
athetic about these sorts of issues are out on the streets
protesting. They realize that they have to participate to
improve the situation. But the problems that we're fac
ing will take years to fix.
SV: There are many students, especially [studying]
geophysics from Venezuela, especially from PDVSA.
They have scholarships.
EJ: The company is paying for them. Scholarships
from PDVSA and their affiliated consortiums
SV: No one knows what is going to happen now with
the scholarships because Chavez has taken control of
PD VSA and is filing a lot of people. I know at least three
people who went to Stanford, who got their master's
degree here, who are fired. They are some of the thou
sands of people who are fired. No one knows what the
strategy is that Chavez and his supporters are using, ex
cept that those who stay in the street protesting him are
fired. He says he's only firing managers, but that's not
true, he's firing people who don't manage anything.
They're managing PDVSA right now in a way that no
body understands. People are being fired who have
been in charge of paying the scholarships for the peo
ple at Stanford.
EJ: llie people that are at Stanford right now don't
know what is going to happen.
Editor's Note: This is the sixth in a weekly series of interviews
with international students at Stanford meant to heighten
awareness of issues of social and political importance around
the world.
