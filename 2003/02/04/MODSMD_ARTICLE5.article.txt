# In spite of gains, housing plagues grad students
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER EDITORIAL STAFF 
This article is the first in a week-long series exploring issues
related to graduate student life.

For many of Stanford's graduate students, getting
housing can come down to a tough choice: continuing
to endure the limited space, uncertainty and lack of
privacy that can come with on-campus housing, or
paying the often exorbitant rent for an off-campus
apartment. Others have no choice but to brave the
housing costs in Silicon Valley, which can be difficult

or impossible to meet on a
student budget.
As a result, many stu
dents are demanding
more and higher-quality
on-campus housing. Ac
cording to administra
tors, the University is
doing its best to meet
their needs and to build a

significant system of on-campus graduate residences.
But students say that, while the severity of the housing
situation has decreased in the last few years, the Uni
versity still has work to do.
Graduate students at Stanford get one year of guar
anteed on-campus housing in the lottery. Currently,
there are 4,070 graduate students housed on campus,
of which 2,050 are in their first year of graduate study.
Of the continuing students entering the lottery last
year, 50 percent — or 700 students — were denied
on-campus housing.
However, the University has constructed new hous
ing over the past five years, adding 1,335 bed spaces
since 1998.
"We now have over 60 percent of graduate students

on campus," said Rodger Whit
ney, executive director of Student
Housing Services. "[That is]
greater than any other [of our]
peer institutions. The closest to
that is probably 20 to 25 percent.
That's the investment we've made
because it's important to us."
Lisa Marin, chair of the Gradu
ate Housing Advisory Committee
and a doctoral student in biologi
cal sciences, said she appreciated
the University's efforts, but noted
that there is still more to do.
"For graduate students, it real
ly wasn't too much of a problem
until five or six years ago; before
that grad students could afford
off-campus housing," she said.
"It's really been in recent years
[that prices rose]. The University
has been struggling to keep up
with it."
Further construction of gradu
ate housing is on hold due to cur
rent budget problems.
Another concern with the lot
tery system is the instability that it
can create for graduate students at
tempting to establish more perma
nent homes. A student, once he or
she gets on-campus housing, is not
guaranteed that same housing, or
even any housing, the next year.
"There is a very high turnover
rate, where people are forced to
move every year on average,"
Marin said.
Many students seeking to avoid
such instability do not even enter
the lottery.
"I personally live off campus,"
said Grace Chang, a medical stu
dent and chair of the Graduate
Student Council."I was unable to
get on-campus housing when I re
turned to Stanford for my current
studies, though I had tried. But I
really fear the instability that going
through the housing lottery every
year would cause."
Besides on-campus housing,
the University also offers subsi
dized off-campus apartments.
These are leased to 780 students at
rates slightly higher than on-cam
pus housing.
"The [subsidized housing] is a
good solution for students who are
able to drive," Marin said. "Of
course, a lot of our students are in
ternational students and a lot of
those don't drive or own a car."
Additionally, 235 students re
ceive housing stipends of $100 a
month.

"The University is likely to take
the housing stipend away [next
year], and many of the units of
fered in the subsidized housing
program are too far away to be a
realistic -option for students — es
pecially if they don't have cars,"
Chang said.
More recently, with the Silicon
Valley economic bust, off-campus
housing has become more afford
able.
"There's less of a housing
crunch for grad students than
there used to be, because off-cam
pus housing options are increas
ing, as the housing market
dropped 30 percent or more," said
Todd Benson, director of Housing
Assignment Services. "Housing
will always be an issue in the Silicon
Valley. Having said that, though, I
would add that it's much less criti
cal than it used to be."
Other living issues for graduate
students include roommates, sig
nificant others and pets. For many
of the graduate residences, stu
dents are assigned roommates,
which can be an issue for those
who desire privacy. For couples,
on-campus housing can be small.
Additionally, other students take
issue with the regulation against
owning pets.
"I live off-campus mainly be
cause I like privacy, and I just
don't want to be shoved in a small
apartment with someone that I've
never met before," said Bronwyn
Barnett, a master's student in com
munication. "It's expensive—l
pay $1,050 fora one-bedroom
apartment — but things are a lot
cheaper than they were two years
ago. The [apartment] I'm living in
would have been about $1,800."
Others said they are pleased
with the on-campus housing.
"I think it's great," said Muoi
Trail, also a master's student in com
munication. "My commute is about
two minutes and the campus is beau
tiful. Then when you factor in utili
ties and other things like transporta
tion, University housing has helped
me to keep my costs down."
Both Chang and Marin ex
pressed appreciation for the Uni
versity's efforts.
"Every year they give us more
help, and every year we need
more," Marin said.
Benson emphasized that while
construction may be on hold, the
University is committed to gradu
ate students.
"The University's goal, long
term, remains to house as many
grad students on campus as feasi
ble," Benson said.

there are 4,070 graduate students housed on campus,
of which 2,050 are in their first year of graduate study.
Of the continuing students entering the lottery last
year, 50 percent — or 700 students — were denied
on-campus housing.
However, the University has constructed new hous
ing over the past five years, adding 1,335 bed spaces
since 1998.
"We now have over 60 percent of graduate students

on campus," said Rodger Whit
ney, executive director of Student
Housing Services. "[That is]
greater than any other [of our]
peer institutions. The closest to
that is probably 20 to 25 percent.
That's the investment we've made
because it's important to us."
Lisa Marin, chair of the Gradu
ate Housing Advisory Committee
and a doctoral student in biologi
cal sciences, said she appreciated
the University's efforts, but noted
that there is still more to do.
"For graduate students, it real
ly wasn't too much of a problem
until five or six years ago; before
that grad students could afford
off-campus housing," she said.
"It's really been in recent years
[that prices rose]. The University
has been struggling to keep up
with it."
Further construction of gradu
ate housing is on hold due to cur
rent budget problems.
Another concern with the lot
tery system is the instability that it
can create for graduate students at
tempting to establish more perma
nent homes. A student, once he or
she gets on-campus housing, is not
guaranteed that same housing, or
even any housing, the next year.
"There is a very high turnover
rate, where people are forced to
move every year on average,"
Marin said.
Many students seeking to avoid
such instability do not even enter
the lottery.
"I personally live off campus,"
said Grace Chang, a medical stu
dent and chair of the Graduate
Student Council."I was unable to
get on-campus housing when I re
turned to Stanford for my current
studies, though I had tried. But I
really fear the instability that going
through the housing lottery every
year would cause."
Besides on-campus housing,
the University also offers subsi
dized off-campus apartments.
These are leased to 780 students at
rates slightly higher than on-cam
pus housing.
"The [subsidized housing] is a
good solution for students who are
able to drive," Marin said. "Of
course, a lot of our students are in
ternational students and a lot of
those don't drive or own a car."
Additionally, 235 students re
ceive housing stipends of $100 a
month.

"The University is likely to take
the housing stipend away [next
year], and many of the units of
fered in the subsidized housing
program are too far away to be a
realistic -option for students — es
pecially if they don't have cars,"
Chang said.
More recently, with the Silicon
Valley economic bust, off-campus
housing has become more afford
able.
"There's less of a housing
crunch for grad students than
there used to be, because off-cam
pus housing options are increas
ing, as the housing market
dropped 30 percent or more," said
Todd Benson, director of Housing
Assignment Services. "Housing
will always be an issue in the Silicon
Valley. Having said that, though, I
would add that it's much less criti
cal than it used to be."
Other living issues for graduate
students include roommates, sig
nificant others and pets. For many
of the graduate residences, stu
dents are assigned roommates,
which can be an issue for those
who desire privacy. For couples,
on-campus housing can be small.
Additionally, other students take
issue with the regulation against
owning pets.
"I live off-campus mainly be
cause I like privacy, and I just
don't want to be shoved in a small
apartment with someone that I've
never met before," said Bronwyn
Barnett, a master's student in com
munication. "It's expensive—l
pay $1,050 fora one-bedroom
apartment — but things are a lot
cheaper than they were two years
ago. The [apartment] I'm living in
would have been about $1,800."
Others said they are pleased
with the on-campus housing.
"I think it's great," said Muoi
Trail, also a master's student in com
munication. "My commute is about
two minutes and the campus is beau
tiful. Then when you factor in utili
ties and other things like transporta
tion, University housing has helped
me to keep my costs down."
Both Chang and Marin ex
pressed appreciation for the Uni
versity's efforts.
"Every year they give us more
help, and every year we need
more," Marin said.
Benson emphasized that while
construction may be on hold, the
University is committed to gradu
ate students.
"The University's goal, long
term, remains to house as many
grad students on campus as feasi
ble," Benson said.
This article is the first in a week-long series exploring issues
related to graduate student life.

For many of Stanford's graduate students, getting
housing can come down to a tough choice: continuing
to endure the limited space, uncertainty and lack of
privacy that can come with on-campus housing, or
paying the often exorbitant rent for an off-campus
apartment. Others have no choice but to brave the
housing costs in Silicon Valley, which can be difficult

or impossible to meet on a
student budget.
As a result, many stu
dents are demanding
more and higher-quality
on-campus housing. Ac
cording to administra
tors, the University is
doing its best to meet
their needs and to build a

significant system of on-campus graduate residences.
But students say that, while the severity of the housing
situation has decreased in the last few years, the Uni
versity still has work to do.

anteed on-campus housing in the lottery. Currently,
