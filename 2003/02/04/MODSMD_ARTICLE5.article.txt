This article is the first in a week-long series exploring issues
related to graduate student life.

For many of Stanford's graduate students, getting

to endure the limited space, uncertainty and lack of
privacy that can come with on-campus housing, or
paying the often exorbitant rent for an off-campus
apartment. Others have no choice but to brave the

As a result, many stu

doing its best to meet
their needs and to build a

significant system of on-campus graduate residences.
But students say that, while the severity of the housing
situation has decreased in the last few years, the Uni
versity still has work to do.
Graduate students at Stanford get one year of guar
anteed on-campus housing in the lottery. Currently,
there are 4,070 graduate students housed on campus,
of which 2,050 are in their first year of graduate study.
Of the continuing students entering the lottery last
year, 50 percent — or 700 students — were denied
on-campus housing.
However, the University has constructed new hous
ing over the past five years, adding 1,335 bed spaces
since 1998.
