# Author helps students face befuddling career choices
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford community members flocked
to Manzanita Dining last night to hear
best-selling author Po Bronson address
the topic of his latest book, one that has a
strong resonance with many ambitious stu
dents at the Farm — "What Should I Do
With My Life?"
Bronson spent the evening discussing
and reading excerpts from the book, a
collection of stories from over 900 peo
ple from across the country who talked
to Bronson about what kinds of choices
they have made in their lives. Most had
undertaken significant career changes
that resulted in—or from — shifts in

their outlook on life.
Bronson, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1986 with a bachelor's in econom
ics, has made similar decisions —he
worked in a law and consulting firm and as
a bond salesman before deciding to leave
the corporate world and pursue writing.
"It's not what you do that defines
you," Bronson said. "It's the choices you
make and the obstacles you overcome to
get there."
The author's other works include "The
Bombardiers," "The Nudist on the Late
Shift," and"The First $20 Million is Always
the Hardest." He was also involved with
the television show, "The Street."
Bronson read excerpts from his
book, accompanied with slides of
the people whose lives he de
scribed. Afterwards, he spoke
more informally about his own ex
periences and the circumstances
surrounding his decision to be
come a writer.
The event was sponsored by the
Asia-Pacific Student Entrepre
neurial Society.
"I invited Po Bronson because
he's my favorite author and he's
written an awesome book about
people who followed their
dreams," said ASES President
Garry Tan, a senior. "Po Bron
son's talk is so cogent to what we all

wonder these days, no matter what
year we are at Stanford. We are on
the cusp of our careers, of the real
world. What should we do? How
do we make these choices? These
stories give us strength."
Tan described the goals of the
organization as, "hooking Stan
ford undergraduates up with
MBA students at the [Graduate
School of Business] to learn about
business and entrepreneurship in
Asia, and also [to] form networks
and mentorship ties with people
who are sto 10 years older than us,
who are farther down the path that
we want to be."
Overall, Bronson was well re
ceived. The audience was particu
larly responsive to his humorous re
counting of his experiences in the
corporate world. He mentioned his
extreme weight loss because of

work-related stress and misery.
"I wasn't metaphorically with
ering away, I was literally wither
ing away," Bronson said.
Freshmen Ben Guthrie and
Mira Leytes had positive reactions
to Bronson's talk.
"I'm trying to figure out what I
want to do with my life," Guthrie
said. "He's talking on a deeper
level, about passions. I thought it
was a good message."
Leytes added, "I think it was in
spiring ... he inspires you to
make choices and commit to things
you are passionate about."
Freshman Gabriele Koch felt
differently.
"I don't think he really said any
thing mind-boggling," Koch said.
"He picked some really interesting
cases, but I don't think they're more
interesting than anything else."
