# Author helps students face befuddling career choices

### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford community members flocked
to Manzanita Dining last night to hear
best-selling author Po Bronson address
the topic of his latest book, one that has a
strong resonance with many ambitious stu
dents at the Farm — "What Should I Do
With My Life?"
Bronson spent the evening discussing
and reading excerpts from the book, a
collection of stories from over 900 peo
ple from across the country who talked
to Bronson about what kinds of choices
they have made in their lives. Most had
undertaken significant career changes
that resulted in—or from — shifts in

their outlook on life.
Bronson, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1986 with a bachelor's in econom
ics, has made similar decisions —he
worked in a law and consulting firm and as
a bond salesman before deciding to leave
the corporate world and pursue writing.
"It's not what you do that defines
you," Bronson said. "It's the choices you
make and the obstacles you overcome to
get there."
The author's other works include "The
Bombardiers," "The Nudist on the Late
Shift," and"The First $20 Million is Always
the Hardest." He was also involved with
the television show, "The Street."
