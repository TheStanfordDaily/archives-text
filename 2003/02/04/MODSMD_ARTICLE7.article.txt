# From faith to atheism and back again
## McLennan's long journey 
### NATALIE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although he is very much a religious
man today, Stanford's Dean of Religious
Life, Reverend Scotty McLennan left for
college as an atheist. Although he grew up
in a conservative Protestant family with
parents who were active in church life,
McLennan describes himself as "that pre
cocious Sunday School student who was al
ways questioning the teacher."
This early questioning of his own faith
sparked McLennan's interest in religions
of the world.
"I could not seem to understand that, if
there was a God, how he could allow all the
horrible things in the world to happen,"
McLennan said of his feelings at the end of
high school.
These sentiments drove him to atheism.
After entering Yale in 1966 as an athe

ist, McLennan reconsidered finding a
new faith after joining "A Seminar for
Friendly Disbelievers," offered by the
university's chaplain. McLennan start
ing engaging in more and more discus
sion with his chaplain, who McLennan
said offered a "liberal view on Christian
ity and a great perspective." McLennan
was active in the social justice movement
and wished to learn more about the
ideals of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Gandhi. This led him to spend a summer
with a Hindu priest and his family in
India after freshman year.
Upon returning to Yale sophomore
year, McLennan discussed Hinduism fur
ther with his chaplain, who advised him to
"go back and be the best Christian you can
be — follow Jesus' Footsteps." McLennan
said these words have stuck with him to
this day. After a two-year dialogue,
the chaplain recommended that
McLennan become a Unitarian
Universalist because it is a reli
gious sect that is very open to all
religions of the world and has no
binding doctrine.
After graduating from Yale
with a bachelor's degree in com
munications, McLennan decided
that he could best find the tools
he needed to pursue social justice
in law school. He went on to re
ceive his master's in divinity and
law degree from Harvard in
1975. He went on to pass the
Massachusetts Bar exam and be
come an ordained Unitarian
Universalist minister.
He went straight to work with
the Unitarian Universalist Min
istry practicing poverty law and
working in Dorchester, one of
Boston's poorest neighborhoods.
In 1984, when his wife suggest
ed that he apply to be Tufts Uni
versity's chaplain, McLennan was
at first very skeptical that he could
go from working for people in life
or death situations in Boston to
working with privileged students.
It was only after being reminded
by his wife of the importance of
the Yale chaplain in his early life
and contemplating how much he
loved intellectual life that he ap
plied for and eventually accepted
the position.
McLennan said he has no re
grets about his switch from di
rect social justice work to work at
universities.
"I didn't get to preach or teach
as a lawyer, and, as the chaplain, I
was able to leverage many students
to do social justice," he said. "I am
working for the next generation."
McLennan said he was very
happy working at Tufts from 1984
to 2001 and that the choice to come
to Stanford in January of2ool was
a difficult one for McLennan, since
he was so happy at his present job
and in Boston.
"It was a big challenge to pull up
all our roots in our 505," McLen
nan said. But he has not regretted
the move fora moment.
"With all due respect to Tufts,
Stanford is an incredible place,"
he said. "The student body is
equal to none."

He said he has loved working
with the students at Stanford.
"While Stanford students are
just as stressed as those at Tufts, at
Stanford, students internalize it,
where at Tufts they wear it on their
sleeves," he said.
McLennan commented that, in
general, he finds people on the
West Coast "happier and friend
lier — and I think it really has to
do with the weather."
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neuman,
senior associate dean of religious
life, who works closely with
McLennan at Stanford, comment
ed, "It's fun and interesting [to]
work with McLennan; he brings
background as a lawyer in addition
to being a minister, which informs
his thought process."
Reverend Joanne Sanders, as
sociate dean of religious life,
added, "Scotty has an enormous

amount of personal energy and
enthusiasm, which always gives
you the sense that he loves what he
is doing."
At Stanford, McLennan works
with Sanders and Karlin-Neuman
as the "facilitator for all religious
organizations on campus" to pro
vide and nurture moral and spiri
tual leadership for the University
as a whole.
On a day-to-day basis, McLen
nan provides individual counsel
ing to students, faculty and staff,
organizes University public wor
ship and other services that go on
in the Church, teaches classes and
supports various member groups
of Stanford Associated Religions, a
group of about 30 religious organi
zations on campus.
"He particularly has worked at
emphasizing, welcoming and en
abling SAR as a partner to our of

fice in the work of religious and
spiritual life on campus," Sanders
said.
Last year McLennan taught
"Ethics and Professions," a class of
fered through the Program in
Ethics and Society. This spring he
will teach "Business Ethics" at the
Graduate School of Business.
Senior Sandie Zuniga took
"Ethics and Professions" last
winter.
"The class met at 9 a.m., but it
was one of those classes people
came too early and stayed late
talking every day," Zuniga said.
"He taught the class in the So
cratic method, which was very ef
fective in producing intense class
discussion."
Zuniga added, "As a teacher,
McLennan was very insightful and
always available after class."
Sophomore Cindy Henn also
took the class last winter.
"It was one of the most useful
classes I've taken at Stanford,"
Henn said. "He brought in many
guest speakers from the profes
sions we were discussing to further
challenge our views on a wide
range of ethical issues."
In addition to formal classes,
McLennan has been a part of
dorm programming. Last month
he spoke about Martin Luther
King Jr. in Florence Moore Hall.
Other dorm programs that the
deans of religious life have been in
volved in have been "Religious
Edges" and "Interfaith Dating."
"Our goal [as the deans of reli
gious life], is to help different reli
gious groups understand each
other and promote interfaith dia
logue and also to get non-religious
people to understand religion,"
McLennan commented.
Since coming to Stanford,
McLennan has been working to
ward these goals primarily
through the existing programs at
Stanford, however he is open to
working with other staff and stu
dents on campus to create new
groups or programs to address
faith-related issues.
McLennan said the Haas Cen
ter was a "primary locus" for so
cial justice awareness on campus
and has helped to create a new
Public Service Fellowship, "Spiri
tuality and Service," which will be
offered next summer. He has also
started working with a new facul
ty group that meets to discuss sci
ence and religion.
