# Worm burrows into servers
## 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A virus-like worm attacked the Internet world
wide last weekend — and hit Stanford's servers —
slowing Internet traffic and overwhelming the
world's digital pipelines. According to Stanford's
Director of Information Security Services, Ced
Bennett, the worm was first detected the evening of
Jan. 24, and at one point, Stanford's network was
being hit with nearly 400,000 attempts per minute
from the Internet due to the worm's monopolizing
bandwidth.
The MS SQL Server worm created a generalized
distributed denial of service (DdoS) that did not
allow access or slowed normal access to Web sites.
The worm, also known as "W32.Slammer" and
"Sapphire," attacked MS SQL Server systems. It
caused problems all over the world, ranging from
computer failures at Korea Telecom Freetel that
left millions of Internet users in South Korea with
out service, to the inability of most of Bank of Amer
ica's ATMs to process transactions, the Associated
Press reported.
At Stanford, many Stanford Hospital servers and
several University servers that use MS SQL Server

had problems. SQL Server is only used on a few
Stanford servers, though, because it is not a part of
a default Windows installation.
The most widely felt effects were reduced access
to web servers and other network services.
"There were no related problems with individ
ual computers in [my dorm]," said Residential
Computer Coordinator Eric Boyes, a senior. "The
noticeable effect was that the entire Internet slowed
to a crawl nation wide... Stanford residents felt the
same slowdown that the rest of the world experi
enced."
The SQL worm attacked a known vulnerability
of Microsoft database software, SQL Server 2000.
Upon successful infection of a system, the worm
replicated itself and used the new host to search for
other computers and to launch additional attacks
over the network, according to Bennett. The attack
was non-destructive to local machines.
"It didn't affect that many machines, that wasn't
a major problem," Bennett said. "[But] it was af
fecting our traffic. Most people saw they couldn't
get to Web sites because they were acting like they
were broken. There was so much traffic they
couldn't get through."
While the worm propagated
rapidly, it was relatively easy to
control and stop once identified.
"It was contained pretty fast. At
Stanford it was stopped over the
weekend. Monday and Tuesday
we finished cleaning up," Bennett
said.
There is a known patch for the
software vulnerability that pro
vides an easy fix. Information
Technology Systems and Services
and other staff started controlling
the problem on Saturday morn
ing, Bennett said. Infected servers
were taken off-line and repaired
or cut off from the network until
the owner could rectify the situa
tion. A filter was placed on SUNet
to stop any off-campus host from
further using the specific port
being exploited by the worm.
ITSS has been working to pre
vent future viruses and worms
from infecting Stanford comput
ers, making security software like
Norton Antivirus available for
free and blocking certain high-risk
hosts, among other things. Ben
nett sees a need for balance,
though, between blocking things
from entering Stanford's network
and keeping the network open be
cause of Stanford's identity as a
university. It is also raising aware
ness in the community about the
dangers of computer viruses and
how to protect against them.
"Prevention is a difficult task
when there are thousands of mem
bers in the Stanford community,"
Boyes said. "In the end, it is up to in
dividual computer users to help
keep their network safe from attack."
Bennett considers the attack
one of the dangers of the Internet
and expects such problems to arise
again in the future. The ITSS staff
doubled its size last year, in recog
nition of the need for increased se
curity to keep computers safe as
resources increase on the Internet.
"As a worm, it was not destruc
tive, but it could've been. We can
see something like this as a warn
ing. That same worm could've
come through and done a lot of
damage," Bennett said.
Boyes agreed: "Viruses and
worms are a major issue. Stanford
is a prime target for electronic at
tack because of our strong net
work infrastructure."
The FBl's National Infrastruc
ture Protection Center is still
searching for the source of the at
tack. London-based market intelli
gence firm Mi2g said that this
worm caused between $950 mil
lion and $1.2 billion in lost produc
tivity in its first five days worldwide.
