# Worm burrows into servers

A virus-like worm attacked the Internet world
wide last weekend — and hit Stanford's servers —
slowing Internet traffic and overwhelming the
world's digital pipelines. According to Stanford's
Director of Information Security Services, Ced
Bennett, the worm was first detected the evening of
Jan. 24, and at one point, Stanford's network was
being hit with nearly 400,000 attempts per minute
from the Internet due to the worm's monopolizing
bandwidth.
The MS SQL Server worm created a generalized
distributed denial of service (DdoS) that did not
allow access or slowed normal access to Web sites.
The worm, also known as "W32.Slammer" and
"Sapphire," attacked MS SQL Server systems. It
caused problems all over the world, ranging from
computer failures at Korea Telecom Freetel that
left millions of Internet users in South Korea with
out service, to the inability of most of Bank of Amer
ica's ATMs to process transactions, the Associated
Press reported.
At Stanford, many Stanford Hospital servers and
several University servers that use MS SQL Server

had problems. SQL Server is only used on a few
Stanford servers, though, because it is not a part of
a default Windows installation.
The most widely felt effects were reduced access
to web servers and other network services.
"There were no related problems with individ
ual computers in [my dorm]," said Residential
Computer Coordinator Eric Boyes, a senior. "The
noticeable effect was that the entire Internet slowed
to a crawl nation wide... Stanford residents felt the
same slowdown that the rest of the world experi
enced."
The SQL worm attacked a known vulnerability
of Microsoft database software, SQL Server 2000.
Upon successful infection of a system, the worm
replicated itself and used the new host to search for
other computers and to launch additional attacks
over the network, according to Bennett. The attack
was non-destructive to local machines.
"It didn't affect that many machines, that wasn't
a major problem," Bennett said. "[But] it was af
fecting our traffic. Most people saw they couldn't
get to Web sites because they were acting like they
were broken. There was so much traffic they
