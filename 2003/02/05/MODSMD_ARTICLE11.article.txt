## WTC designs are narrowed to two 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Two plans featuring structures
that would rise taller than any other in the world have
been picked as finalists in the selection of a design to re
build the World Trade Center, officials said yesterday.
One proposal evokes the original trade center with
twin latticework towers, while the other preserves the
foundations of the twin skyscrapers.
The selection of the designs was announced yester
day afternoon by officials from the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp., the agency overseeing the rede
velopment of the site, and the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey, the agency that owned the trade
center.
"These designs best satisfied the rigorous set of cri
teria that we set forth," said Roland Betts, head of the
LMDC's planning committee.
Both finalist designs — by an architectural team
known as THINK and by Berlin-based architect
Daniel Libeskind — feature structures rising higher
than the tallest in the world, Malaysia's 1,483-foot
Petronas Twin Towers.
The World Trade Center's twin towers measured
1,350 feet.
The THINK team, led by New York-based archi
tects Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz, proposed
the World Cultural Center, whose lacy 1,665-foot tow
ers have been called 21st-century Eiffel Towers.
Libeskind, who designed Berlin's Jewish Museum,
proposed starkly geometrical buildings clustered
around the foundations of the fallen towers and
topped by a 1,776-foot spire.
Although both finalists include soaring structures,
neither plan conceives of office space extending all the
way to the top.
The models each include a vision for where the vic
tims' memorial might be built. A specific design for the
memorial is expected to be chosen later this year in a
separate competition. Nearly 2,800 people were killed
in the attack on the trade center Sept. 11, 2001.
The two finalists were among nine proposals for re
developing the 16-acre World Trade Center site that
were unveiled Dec. 18.
