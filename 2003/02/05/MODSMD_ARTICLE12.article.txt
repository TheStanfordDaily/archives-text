# U.N. to hear new evidence on Iraq
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Secretary of State Colin Powell
will be joined by top CIA officials today as he presents
the U.N. Security Council with evidence culled from
classified material to try to convince wavering allies
and other nations that Iraq has defied calls to disarm.
The evidence is expected to include transcripts and
possibly recordings of intercepted conversations of
Iraqi officials discussing the country's weapons pro
grams. There probably also will be satellite images of
suspected biological weapons labs, officials said.
Powell's report is also expected to indicate that
Iraqi officials had advance knowledge where U.N.
weapons inspectors were going to look, in line with a
recent report from the British government that said

Iraqi intelligence had bugged inspectors' telephones
and hotel and conference rooms.
Hans Blix, the chief U.N. weapons inspector,
warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein yesterday
that it's "five minutes to midnight." President Bush
and his top national security officials have said re
peatedly that Iraq will be forcibly disarmed if it does
not comply with U.N. resolutions demanding that it
reveal and give up weapons of mass destruction.
CIA Director George J. Tenet and his chief deputy,
John McLaughlin, are expected to accompany Powell.
In selecting evidence, Powell and intelligence special
ists are said to be taking care not to reveal more about
their operations than they could safely show Iraq.
