# Cal's cyclotron may close soon

### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) —The 88-inch cy
clotron at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, an
outgrowth of research that began with pioneer
ing scientist Ernest O. Lawrence, may be closed
down.
President Bush's 2004 budget proposal pre
sented this week cuts the appropriation for the
cyclotron from $6.3 million to $3 million, with
the $3 million intended for shutdown.
Office of Science head Raymond Orbach said
the cut was unavoidable.
"The 88 inch (cyclotron) has been one of the
most productive machines we have," he said. "It
is with a heavy heart that we make this recom
mendation."
The closing isn't inevitable because the bud
get has not yet been passed by Congress and nu
clear scientists are likely to fight to keep it open.
The cyclotron is a particle accelerator that
works by slamming atoms into each other at low
energies, giving scientists clues into how atoms
work. In 2001, 255 researchers used the cy
clotron for their research.
Accelerator research began at the University
of California, Berkeley under Lawrence in the
1930s and includes such milestones as the dis
covery of plutonium during World War 11.
Federal officials said the budget decision was
not influenced by a Berkeley research team's ac
knowledgment last year that one of its members
made up data supporting the creation of ele
ment 118.
Although it may be losing the cyclotron
under the proposed budget, the lab would get
more money to build a new nanotechnology re
search building as well as money fora superno
va research satellite.
Lawrence Berkeley, which conducts unclassi
fied research, is one of three labs managed by
UC for the government.
