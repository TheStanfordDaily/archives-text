## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Judging by the cover 
### 
Administrators from the Intro
duction to the Humanities
Program confirmed last
month that the Freshman
Book program had been cut this year due
to budget limitations. This would have
been the fifth year of the program —
which in the past brought to campus such
established storytellers as novelists Max
ine Hong Kingston and Charles Johnson,
playwright Tom Stoppard and documen
tary filmmaker Errol Morris.
The program's director, Rob Robinson,
told The Daily last month that he was "re
ally disappointed" the program ended.
We are also disappointed.
The program was perhaps one of the
most promising ideas Stanford has come
up with in recent years. But unfortu
nately, it has also been poorly organized,
executed and publicized. Last year's

four films were dis
tributed to fresh
men, but the films
were only integrated
into one I-Hum
course. Morris' ap
pearance was not
publicized well and
was consequently
poorly attended.
If the Freshman
Book program does
return, then changes

must be made to ensure that it accommo
dates the needs of the freshman class.
The concept for the Freshman Book,
instituted in 1998, was simple: The I-
Hum department purchased copies of a
selected book for the entire freshman
class. The book's author was then slated to
speak to the class, as well as members of
the Stanford community, later in the year.
The first book selection—Johnson's
"Middle Passage" — worked well and
showed potential for the program's
growth. The book was distributed to the
class early in the year. It was not a difficult
read and was easily accessible to all stu
dents. And Johnson's talk, in May, was
well attended.
But in the next two years, I-Hum fum
bled with the program. The Freshman
Book became Stanford's version of
Oprah's Book Club — where the reading
was informal, the discussion was superfi
cial and the learning was minimal, espe
cially because few I-Hum classes integrat
ed the book into the curriculum.
Though they are excellent books,
Stoppard's "Arcadia" and Kingston's
"The Woman Warrior," are somewhat
dense and do not follow a linear storyline,
making it less likely that students would

feel like picking them up for pleasure
reading. The books were only assigned
reading in one I-Hum course — Prof.
Diane Middlebrook's "Literature of
Transformation" — and because they
were difficult, they were ignored by a
large number of freshmen.
Last year, the program took anoth
er unexpected turn: The Freshman
Book wasn't a book at all, but a series
of four documentaries from filmmak
er Errol Morris. To further complicate
matters, each freshman received only
one of the films — with the suggestion
from I-Hum to share their selection
with their peers.
The intention of the I-Hum depart
ment was to introduce freshmen to docu
mentary films by distributing Morris'
works, hoping to illustrate that documen
tary films have a place in academia. Un

fortunately, because
few I-Hum classes
discussed the films,
students were left
with a rather com
plex series of films
that would have been
better appreciated if
a discussion or expla
nation had preceded
the films. Morris' lec
ture was not well at
tended, even though

he is a widely acclaimed filmmaker, simply
because the event was poorly publicized.
It would be wonderful if the Freshman
Book could return in the future, as either
a more accessible book, or if well-chosen
films that are better integrated into the
curriculum, with more support from I-
Huin.
Other universities have similar fresh
man book programs that have proven to
be more successful. One of the reasons
that these programs may be more success
ful is timing. Stanford students are often
so busy throughout the year that allowing
students to read during the summer, such
as the way University of Pennsylvania
runs its freshman book program, would
allow more students to enjoy the works.
The text or film should be distributed to
freshmen in the summer prior to arrival
on campus, when most newly admitted
Stanford students have enough time fora
leisurely read.
The book should also be weaved into
the curriculum of all I-Hum classes, and
section discussions about the book before
the author's talk would undoubtedly peak
interest in the work.

Finally, the book should be ac
cessible to all readers. We are not
suggesting that the work should be
easy, but it wouldn't hurt if it con
tained more conventional ele
ments. Stanford students are al
ready given a large amount of dif
ficult texts to read for the standard
I-Hum courses. It would be more
valuable, however, to see a fresh

man book that was more of a page
turner. How about a novel from
Toni Morrison, Michael Cunning
ham, Amy Tan or Barbara King
solver?
We are convinced that the
Freshman Book could succeed on
several levels. I-Hum should take
this year to re-evaluate the pro
gram and to determine where past
selections have failed. A well-exe
cuted selection next year would
renew our faith in the Freshman
Book program and in I-Hum
courses as a whole.
