Cracking down on student bikers
There is currently much debate among
students about the issue of bike citations
on campus, 112 do not contest the fact that
there are certain laws that apply to bike
riders — 1 am just outraged by the way
these laws are applied. In theory, all laws
should be obeyed equally by everyone,
but, in reality, there are always going to be
more people who disrespect laws than po
lice to catch those people. So, that allows
the police to really focus on the serious in
fractions first and using their judgement
as of the disrespect for which laws is more
detrimental.
What does the campus police do in
stead? They crack down on student bikers.
They slyly set up traps for those unfortu
nate students who happen to pass by ex
actly at the moment when the police feels
that there's no bigger crime going around
than not having a light or a license.
And what does the University do about
that? Did the University ever consider
providing separate bike paths to safe

guard us from the street traffic, or do they
just expect us to all bike through the park
ing lots in order to avoid being pulled over
with ridiculous charges?
Recently, I was riding down from
Hoover Tower on an empty Serra Mall to
wards Escondido Village when I saw a
sheriff s assistant stopping bikers at Encina
Hall, 112 had a bike light and my bike was
registered, so 112 thought 112 would be safe.
But 112 suppose the police has a quota they
have to fulfill in fines, because I was
stopped just so they could find something
wrong with what 112 was doing.
Moreover, 112 was handed directly a
court citation, as the officer thought that
just a fine would not suffice — my crimi
nal offense being that 112 am a Stanford stu
dent and 1 ride a bike. The student voice
on this issue is not loud and not organized
enough.

Ironic' political agenda
I am wondering if anybody else ap
preciates the extreme irony of those

who decry the Hoover Institute are
furthering a bias in academia. Is any
body else snickering to themselves
when they hear, of all people, Prof.
Benin complain about the Hoover In
stitution being motivated by a political
agenda? Just curious.

Escondido Village residents ignored by
administration, press
It is a welcome surprise to see the Daily
begin a series of articles on the problems
facing graduate students at Stanford. The
recent article, 'In spite of gains, housing
plagues grad students,' (Feb. 4) accurate
ly noted some of the larger forces impact
ing graduate students seeking housing:
the recent partial correction of the expen
sive local housing market and the Univer
sity's maddening policy of forcing single
graduate students to re-enter the housing
lottery annually.
However, I was disappointed that
Morgan Springer never mentioned the
most visible and most important element

in graduate housing at Stanford. I refer to
Escondido Village, where thousands of
graduate students and their spouses and
children live year-round. Escondido Vil
lage is perhaps the University's greatest
success when it comes to assisting gradu
ate students.
Students with children (including a
number of undergraduates with children)
are guaranteed four years in a two- or
three-bedroom Escondido Village apart
ment, and most do not move during their
tenure at Stanford. In general, these are
relatively affordable, safe, pleasant and
socially active communities that provide a
high quality of life for graduate students,
their spouses and children.
Escondido Village is the University's
largest and most distinctive housing com
munity, housing far more Stanford com
munity members than the faculty hous
ing, the undergraduate dorms, fraterni
ties or theme houses. Ask a local merchant
or Palo Alto resident who they know at
Stanford and it is more likely to be a man
or woman with a baby in tow than an un
dergrad. We are a large and growing part
of the overall student body.
The fact that Escondido Village was
not mentioned in the article is related to

the greater problem that faces graduate
students with dependents here at Stan
ford. We are largely ignored in The Daily,
and we are largely ignored by the admin
istration. I hope The Daily's upcoming ar
ticles will consider the needs and concerns
of graduate students with dependents.
