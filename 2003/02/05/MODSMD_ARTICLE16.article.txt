# MEMORY YIELDS
## Virtuous silence

Reality TV is the new
craze that is sweeping
the United States. From
the early days of "Sur
vivor" to the decadent state of af
fairs that gave us "Joe Millionaire,"
Americans have been engulfed by
one show after another that pur
ports to show us what "reality" is
actually like.
In the process, we have moved
from the original "Real World,"
which was an entertainment
forum for issues that faced the '90s
generation, to the "Real World:
Las Vegas," which is all about fig
uring out who Trishell is going to
sleep with next. It has been said
that all great literature is about ei
ther sex or death. In 21 st century
America, all "great" television is
just about sex — witness ABC's
"Are You Hot?"
The more people who tune in,
the more layers we peel away,
until we get to naked, raw lust.
The more people that get interest
ed, the simpler it gets (or perhaps
it is the other way around).
This tendency is not just true of
entertainment. Our own presi
dent, George W. Bush is living out
his own reality TV show. Of
course, the ratings for Bush II
haven't come close to the ratings
of the last few seasons of the Clin
ton administration, but back then
everyone had the leisure time that
went with money to worry about
where the Prez was getting his.
Now Bush is doing everything he
can to make Americans forget that
he was elected by a 5-4 Supreme
Court vote. Repeat after us: "That
man tried to kill my father."
What is it about politics that
leaves us with this bad taste in our
mouths? Why does the Left hate
the Right, the Right hate the Left
and the President feel the need to
speak in euphemisms that sound

like they are from old John Wayne
movies? Really, though, we can't
blame the politicians. After all,
they pander to the drama pop
culture craves. So why can't we
keep the entertainment out of pol
itics?
The answer can be found in one
word: Bias. Whenever the Right
wing wants to discredit the Left,

they scream leftist
bias. The media is
biased. This politi
cian is biased.
That argument is
flawed by bias.
And half of Amer
ica agrees. The
other half of
America nods
along with Mau
reen Dowd of the

New York Times when she writes
her biweekly column about how
W. is a "bad" man. Never mind
the fact that she offers little to no
analysis. She points out that he is
too conservative and that his fam
ily is rich. Can the rich not make
good policy?
The problem with public dis
course in the 21 st century is that
public figures want to get out the
vote by any means possible. In
order to do this, you have to make
people believe they understand
the world from your perspective.
So you give them . . . bias. You
point to your enemies and declare
them to be the "other," with all the
flaws — usually unrelated moral
flaws — that entails and reap the
benefits of the knee-jerk party
line voter.
The American people are so
well-trained that real discussion is
almost totally precluded. The
word bias is a code word for saying
that pop culture has succeeded in
making you believe that your self
identity is so wrapped up in some

value, which may be nominally as
sociated with the issue at hand,
that to give an inch is to admit you
aren't who you say you are. Bias
has come to have an Orwellian
meaning: venerated as dogma,
but completely lacking substance.
Stanford is certainly not free of
this scourge. History Prof. Joel
Beinin is the frequent subject of
criticism for his pro-Palestinian,
or as they are often called, "anti-
Israeli" views. When he sent a let
ter to The Daily with 800 signato
ries (Jan. 8) citing the rhetoric of
the Israeli government with re
gards to Palestinians living in Is
rael, he was immediately met with
indignant letters denying any
such tendency in Israeli political
discourse. Beinin may be regard
ed by some as "anti-Israeli" —
whatever that term means — but
the letters' dismissal of Beinin's
viewpoint does not address the
core concerns of the Beinin letter.
These pages again saw Mc-
Carthy-ite talk of bias in a series of
letters a week later that suggested
that the Hoover Institute should
be reformed because it has right
wing leanings. The word 'bias" was
thrown in to suggest that because
the Hoover Institute is a conserva
tive institution, there is something
wrong with how people receive
appointments to the Institute. Is
there, then, by the same logic,
something wrong with how pro
fessors at large are appointed at
Stanford, as most seem to be liber
al? Or with how students are ad
mitted, as an overwhelming ma
jority of the undergraduate popu
lation is liberal?
Incessant talk of bias, at Stan
ford and in the nation at large,
does a great disservice to both
ends of the political spectrum.
