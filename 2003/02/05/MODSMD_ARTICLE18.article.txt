## Women begin title defense with win 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
As much as the Stanford
women's water polo team would
like to relish its first national
championship of a year ago, the
start of the 2003 season makes its
8-4 win over UCLA in the champi
onship game officially yesterday's
news.
No. 1 Stanford (1-0) picked up
right where it left off after finish
ing last season 23-2 and took the
first step in defending its title with
a dominating 13-1 victory over
No. 16 UC-Davis on Sunday at
Avery Aquatic Center.
Repeating as champions will
not be easy for head coach John
Tanner and his squad. Tanner,
who has helped establish Stanford
as a perennial power, enters his
sixth season with the Cardinal and
will have to cope with the depar
tures of graduated senior starters
Ellen Estes, Kate Pettit and
Margie Dingeldein.
In addition, the No. 1 and "de
fending National Champions"
label that adorns the Cardinal will
have every team in the nation
gunning for Stanford like teams
do for the Lakers or Yankees.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
while the team is different in many
respects, it also returns a core
group of experienced upperclass
men to complement its highly
touted freshman class.
That group of seasoned veter
ans welcomes the challenge.
"It's definitely realistic for us to
repeat," senior driver Nicole
Huszcz said. "That's our goal for
this season. It's a different team in
the sense that we graduated three
star players but the seven coming
in add a whole new flavor and
we've been working well togeth
er."
Junior Brenda Villa, a two-time
Ail-American and Stanford's lead
ing scorer last season returns to so
lidify the Cardinal offensive at
tack.
In addition to leading the Unit
ed States to the final game of the
Women's Water Polo World Cup
in Australia last summer, Villa was
also the recipient of the presti
gious Cutino Award, presented to
the most outstanding female
water polo player.
Villa is not the only Cardinal

with international experience. Se
nior goalkeeper Jackie Frank, the
2002 NCAA Player of the Year
and MVP of the NCAA tourna
ment, played alongside Villa as
the starting goalkeeper on the
U.S. Senior National Team.
Fellow senior Julie Gardner, a
two-time All-American and the
team's second leading scorer a
year ago, will also be an integral
part of Stanford's continued suc
cess, as will juniors Wendy
Watkins and Shannon Avrett.
Any questions that the Cardinal
was hung up on last season's suc
cess going into its season opener
with UC-Davis on Sunday were
quickly answered when Stanford
drew first blood on junior driver
Lauren Faust's goal just 41 sec
onds into the game.
Frank continued right where
she left off with three early saves,
and two First period goals by
sophomore Kelty Luber staked
Stanford to an 8-0 halftime lead
and the Cardinal never looked
back.

While different players were
responsible for the damage, the
outcome was much the same in
the second half as Stanford's un
derclassmen put together a domi
nating and promising perfor
mance while several Cardinal
starters rested.
Sophomore Hannah Luber, no
stranger to following her twin
Kelty since being born minutes
after her, equaled her sister's two
goals in the first half with two of
her own in the second, and fresh
men Lauren Boreta and Laurel
Champion scored the first goals of
their young collegiate careers.
Freshman Amanda Matuk
played like Frank's heir apparent
after replacing the four-year
starter in net in the second half,
recording eight saves and allow
ing only one goal.
"It was really nice to see Aman
da play," said Frank. "She played
really well and she's quick and en
thusiastic. It's great to have her
here."
Offensively, the Cardinal dis

played the balanced attack that
characterized last season's title run,
as nine players recorded goals, in
cluding two apiece by Gardner,
Villa and the Luber sisters.
Huszcz, who tallied nine goals
last season, closed out the Stan
ford scoring on Sunday.
"It's different getting everyone
together and playing on the same
page," Huszcz said. "But the
freshmen have done a great job
stepping up and learning our sys
tem of play. We have a lot of depth
coming off the bench and we have
six really great starting players.
We have one of our freshmen
starting this year, which is fantas
tic."
The Cardinal will continue its
title defense this weekend at the
third annual Stanford Invitation
al. Seven teams will make the trip
to the Farm, including rivals No. 2
UCLA, No. 3 USC and No. 5 Cal
as well as Indiana, and Hawaii.

No. 16 UC-Davis on Sunday at
Avery Aquatic Center.
Repeating as champions will
not be easy for head coach John
Tanner and his squad. Tanner,
who has helped establish Stanford
as a perennial power, enters his
sixth season with the Cardinal and
will have to cope with the depar
tures of graduated senior starters
Ellen Estes, Kate Pettit and
Margie Dingeldein.
In addition, the No. 1 and "de
fending National Champions"
label that adorns the Cardinal will
have every team in the nation
gunning for Stanford like teams
do for the Lakers or Yankees.
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
while the team is different in many
respects, it also returns a core
group of experienced upperclass
men to complement its highly
touted freshman class.
That group of seasoned veter
ans welcomes the challenge.
"It's definitely realistic for us to
repeat," senior driver Nicole
Huszcz said. "That's our goal for
this season. It's a different team in
the sense that we graduated three
star players but the seven coming
in add a whole new flavor and
we've been working well togeth
er."
Junior Brenda Villa, a two-time
Ail-American and Stanford's lead
ing scorer last season returns to so
lidify the Cardinal offensive at
tack.
In addition to leading the Unit
ed States to the final game of the
Women's Water Polo World Cup
in Australia last summer, Villa was
also the recipient of the presti
gious Cutino Award, presented to
the most outstanding female
water polo player.
Villa is not the only Cardinal

with international experience. Se
nior goalkeeper Jackie Frank, the
2002 NCAA Player of the Year
and MVP of the NCAA tourna
ment, played alongside Villa as
the starting goalkeeper on the
U.S. Senior National Team.
Fellow senior Julie Gardner, a
two-time All-American and the
team's second leading scorer a
year ago, will also be an integral
part of Stanford's continued suc
cess, as will juniors Wendy
Watkins and Shannon Avrett.
Any questions that the Cardinal
was hung up on last season's suc
cess going into its season opener
with UC-Davis on Sunday were
quickly answered when Stanford
drew first blood on junior driver
Lauren Faust's goal just 41 sec
onds into the game.
Frank continued right where
she left off with three early saves,
and two First period goals by
sophomore Kelty Luber staked
Stanford to an 8-0 halftime lead
and the Cardinal never looked
back.

While different players were
responsible for the damage, the
outcome was much the same in
the second half as Stanford's un
derclassmen put together a domi
nating and promising perfor
mance while several Cardinal
starters rested.
Sophomore Hannah Luber, no
stranger to following her twin
Kelty since being born minutes
after her, equaled her sister's two
goals in the first half with two of
her own in the second, and fresh
men Lauren Boreta and Laurel
Champion scored the first goals of
their young collegiate careers.
Freshman Amanda Matuk
played like Frank's heir apparent
after replacing the four-year
starter in net in the second half,
recording eight saves and allow
ing only one goal.
"It was really nice to see Aman
da play," said Frank. "She played
really well and she's quick and en
thusiastic. It's great to have her
here."
Offensively, the Cardinal dis

played the balanced attack that
characterized last season's title run,
as nine players recorded goals, in
cluding two apiece by Gardner,
Villa and the Luber sisters.
Huszcz, who tallied nine goals
last season, closed out the Stan
ford scoring on Sunday.
"It's different getting everyone
together and playing on the same
page," Huszcz said. "But the
freshmen have done a great job
stepping up and learning our sys
tem of play. We have a lot of depth
coming off the bench and we have
six really great starting players.
We have one of our freshmen
starting this year, which is fantas
tic."
The Cardinal will continue its
title defense this weekend at the
third annual Stanford Invitation

to the Farm, including rivals No. 2

The defending national champion women's water polo team opened defense of its title with a 13-1 victory over vis

are standing," Huszcz said. "Teams are

top spot and everyone wants to be
there."
Stanford will play San Jose on Satur
day morning before taking on Cal at 5
p.m.
Indiana awaits the Cardinal the next
day at 9 a.m. and the rest of the tourna
ment, culminating in Sunday's champi
onship game at 5 p.m.. will be decided
by the eight teams' performance to that
point.
A matchup with UCLA would be a re
match of the previous two NCAA Cham
pionship games.
The Cardinal won the tournament
last year with wins over UC Santa Bar
bara on the second day and a win over
UCLA in the championship game.
Following the tournament, Stanford
will enjoy a two-week break before scrim
maging the U.S. National Team on Feb.
22 and hosting UCLA on Feb. 28 to close
out the first month of the season.
As much as the Stanford
women's water polo team would
like to relish its first national
championship of a year ago, the
start of the 2003 season makes its
8-4 win over UCLA in the champi
onship game officially yesterday's
news.
No. 1 Stanford (1-0) picked up
right where it left off after finish
