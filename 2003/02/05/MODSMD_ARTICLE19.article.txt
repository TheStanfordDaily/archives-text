# New volume, same old Mac attack

### 
This is my first column
of the new volume. To
be honest, things
probably won't be
much different for the rest of my
columns this year unless the
new commander-in-chief,
Megan, has a problem with me
calling people cheesedicks, talk
ing about badonkadonks and
glorifying beer games. So you
can expect more of the same.
However, I am still feeling in
somewhat of a beginning mode,
so I thought I would give a brief
rundown of a few of the sports
issues that I am bound to touch
on in the coming months.

With the
Super Bowl
over, NFL
teams won't go
at it again for
months — but
that doesn't
mean there
won't be any in
triguing foot
ball stories to

talk about. In fact, some of the
most entertaining storylines de
velop in the spring. How can
you forget Mark Chmura and
his romp in a hot tub at some
post-prom party, or Rae Car
ruth's trial, which admittedly
wasn't as amusing as Chuey's
cradle-robbing exploits? A cou
ple notable arrests and court
cases are a lock, while April's
NFL draft always brings loads of
unintentional comedy with it.
Mel Kiper alone is worth a cou
ple columns — no doubt focus
ing on his rock-hard hair that
could be only sculpted with the
"gel" from "There's Something
About Mary."
The NBA playoffs should be
another classic this year, espe
cially with the cracks in the Lak
ers' armor more apparent than
ever. If the postseason is any
thing like the last couple weeks,
we're in for some trouble be
cause the league has been Mike
Tyson-worthy. Honestly, it's
only a matter of time before
Rasheed Wallace one-ups La
trell Sprewell and beats down a

ref. Rasheed's now been sus
pended more times than 50
Cent's been shot and he's show
ing no signs of slowing down.
However, personally, what
I'm looking forward to the most
is another Mr. Vanessa
Williams/Doug Christie battle.
But this time, Vanessa jumps in
once Christie's wife starts swing
ing around that Gucci purse like
a machete, and eventually it
turns into the mud-wrestling
catfight from the new Miller Lite
ad.
At the college ranks, March
Madness will be as exciting as
ever, with people all across the

Both Kentucky and
Louisville can get up and

Joe Millionaire will fade into

country betting their rent
money on some sleeper like
Northern Arizona because Jay
Bilas called them "this year's
Kent State." It looks like Stan
ford will be making another
tourney run in the first year P.C.
(Post Casey), and the Pac-10
should be representing the Left
Coast to the fullest.
But I'm coming out early
with my championship pick and
it's straight out of the Bluegrass
State: either Kentucky or
Louisville. I'm not sure which
one yet, but both teams can
shoot, they're athletic as hell and
they can get up and down the
floor faster than Joe Millionaire
will fade into the sort of oblivion
that only Kato Kaelin knows.
Moving from college to high
school — if you can even call it
that — Leßronmania should
come to a head in the coming
months when he finally gets his
hard-earned diploma and en
