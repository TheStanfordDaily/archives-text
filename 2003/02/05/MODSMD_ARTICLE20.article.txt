### 
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) _ Florida hardly lived up
to its first-ever No. 1 ranking last night.
Keith Bogans scored 15 points-all in the first half
as No. 6 Kentucky used overwhelming defense to beat
the Gators 70-55, snapping Florida's 14-game win
ning streak one day after they moved to the top of the
rankings for the first time in school history.
Gerald Fitch had 14 points for Kentucky (17-3, 7-0
Southeastern Conference), which won its 11th
straight game, its second-longest winning streak in
coach Tubby Smith's six seasons. The Wildcats
haven't won their first seven league games since 1997-
98, their last national championship season.
Anthony Roberson scored 18 points for the Gators
(18-3, 7-1), who shot 34 percent (17-of-50), including
36 percent (5-of-14) from 3-point range.
The Gators hit four of their first seven shots before
Kentucky's defense seized control. For the rest of the
half, Florida hardly got an open look and the Wildcats
seemed to track down every loose ball.
Kentucky finished the half on a 23-4 run as Flori
da missed 21 of its last 23 shots and committed eight
turnovers. The Wildcats scored 14 straight points
over one five-minute stretch.
Bogans, a senior who averaged 17 points in six pre
vious games against Florida, shot 6-of-11 in the first
half. The Wildcats went 19-of-37 from the field (51
percent) in the opening half, including 7-of-12 from
3-point range (58 percent).
The Gators' offensive struggles were summed up
in the final 1:22 of the first half.
After a timeout, Roberson overthrew an inbounds
baseball pass to Brett Nelson on the Kentucky side of
the floor. Nelson saved the ball right to Cliff Hawkins,
who calmly made an uncontested layup.
Seconds later, Bogans stole a pass and threw down
a two-handed, breakaway dunk for a4l -20 lead. Nel
son missed a 3-pointer, the Wildcats rebounded and
Bogans lobbed an alley-oop pass to Hayes fora dunk.
Roberson made two free throws, but Daniels hit a
fadeaway jumper with 2 seconds left to give Kentucky
a 45-22 halftime lead.
The Gators had no solutions for Kentucky's de
fense in the second half.
