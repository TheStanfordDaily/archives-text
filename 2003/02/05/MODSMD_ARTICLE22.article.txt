# Monday night TV is sick
## 
### 
So I sit down to write my column, bring
my laptop onto my couch, and figure
there's no better backdrop for serious
sportswriting than the insight of my
boys Wilbon and Kornheiser and some "Par
don the Interruption." As you all know, Mon
day nights are the perfect TV viewing nights,
with PTI at 8:30 on the deuce, my boy "Joe
Millionaire" at 9 on Fox, and then on MTV's
10-spot, with the "Road Rules — Real World
Challenge," followed by "Clone High USA"
(the best cartoon on TV right now).
It was going to be a great night, let me tell
you.
So, I setde into the couch, change it to

channel 53, and what do I
find? Six yokels driving
snowmobiles over one an
other, combined with an
announcer well over his
quota of two usages of "sick"
per minute. A pass, maneu
ver, jump, holeshot,
straightaway, whoop sec
tion. Take my word for it, it
was all very sick.

Now I love ESPN as much as the next guy,
but the X-games test my patience. Every six
months these things are on, but it seems like
every six days. Just as we finish watching the
highlights of the last X-games and Tony
Hawk's newest trick "revolutionizing" sports
as we know it, we get a new version of the
same people driving over the same snow (or
kick-flipping on the same ramp) with the
same results. But you're right dreadlocked
announcer dude, it's all very sick.
But my night wasn't ruined — thankfully
there was an 8 p.m. Sports Center to tide me
over until Joe, helping to provide some sports
content for this column. So I give you what I
yelled last night, at the TV, at my roommate,
but really, at anyone who would listen
Here goes:
First, Vanderjagt. OK, you are an idiot.
Who gets on Canadian cable TV and says
they aren't a fan of their own team? But more
importandy, who gets on Canadian cable TV
in the first place? An idiot, that's who!
Now, I know that Vanderjagt is a bailer,
and I mean that in the sickest sense of the
word. He is the most accurate field goal kick
er in NFL history, and he saved the Colts a lot
this year. But dude, don't insult your coach
and your quarterback, no matter how calm
they are.
I'm no Tony Dungy fan, and I hate Peyton
Manning as much as you, but saying you
aren't a fan of your own team when you are a
baseball season away from next year is just
going to hurt you in the long run. Vanderjagt
just set back the kicker's liberation movement
to the era of Garo Yepremian.

Second, The Super Bowl. God what a dis
appointment. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers
destroyed my favorite teams like only Terry
Tate (office linebacker) could. I could just see
Simeon Rice pummeling Rich Gannon while
yelling "You know you have to put a cover
sheet on that TPS report....RlCH!!!"
The Pain Train certainly arrived, and it
destroyed me. Down 30 bucks and a larynx
after yelling at the 49ers, then the Raiders, to
come back against the Bucs, I figured out
why the Bay Area lost. It's that damn Rally
Monkey. It may have stopped jumping
around for now, but the curse lingers in the
minds of Bay Area sports like a bad Dave
Matthews song. But I digress.
Finally, Leßron. Let me just get this off
my chest. Athletes get tons of free stuff, and
the Ohio High School State Gaming Com
mission, or whatever their name is, isn't
going to change that. How about concen
trating on the girls undoubtedly throwing
themselves at Leßron because of his athlete
status? Want something Leßron's athleti
cism is undeservedly getting him? Start with
the ladies. Love is worth more than 100
bucks, isn't it?
Love worth a hundred bucks? Ha! Try 50
million. That's right, it was time for my good
buddy Joe Millionaire to come on, and God,
was I ready. Watching it with my roommate
and several female friends (yeah OK, one fe
male friend), we played a game where one ar
ticle of clothing had to be removed for every
stupid thing they said. Thanks to the replay
of the "Mercenary" line (and I quote: "I want
to bathe poor children, give them shots...l
guess I'm just a mercenary type of person"),
how the sun "setted," and the "breast...l
mean dress you brought from home," I was
already naked halfway into the show (Note to
self: when playing strip games, wear more
than three articles of clothing).
So at this point in the night, I was naked,
cold, sad, and hungry . But Zora had moved
on to the next round, and the mercenary was
eliminated. The Rally Monkey couldn't mess
up that one. Life was good.
My unsolicited opinion: Leßron will be
in the NBA fora couple years, then peter
out and end up in Slamball, the "sport" on
TNN where everything inside of the 3-point
line is a trampoline. Imagine Leßron going
up fora reverse jam and spending 8.5 sec
onds in the air, splintering the backboard
and spitting out his "King James" mouth
guard to boot.
That would be sick.

Spencer Porter, a sophomore, would like to apologize
[or this week's TV theme, but when Joe Millionaire
is on the brain, it's hard to think of anything else. He
