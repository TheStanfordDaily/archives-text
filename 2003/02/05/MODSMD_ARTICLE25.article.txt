## The 						Long Road to Recovery: CEO upbeat about tech economy 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Jensen Huang, the CEO of Santa
Clara-based NVIDIA, one of the leading
manufacturers of computer graphics
cards, predicted a long term revival of the
economy during a talk at Terman Audito
rium last week. But Huang did not ex
plain what would specifically drive the re
covery.
Figures released last week by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics showed no let
up in unemployment rates for California.
Unemployment increased slighdy from
6.5 percent in November to 6.6 percent in
December last year.
Such numbers did not deter Huang.
"The entrepreneur sees the world in a
perspective that the rest of us can't possi
bly," Huang said. "Ideas [are] what drive
innovation and innovation is what drives
the economy."
Huang did not elaborate on what will
reinvigorate Silicon Valley. "Ultimately,
there will be something besides high-tech
that becomes the next Internet boom," he
said. "There was the PC boom, there was
the Internet boom [and] there will be
some other boom beyond that. We don't
know what it is; otherwise we would be
doing it ourselves."
But others are not as optimistic that the
economy will rebound so quickly.
Spencer Horowitz, a business consultant
in Silicon Valley who was in the audience,
sees a gloomier outlook.

"There are fewer ventures being fund
ed," he said. "I see a lot of great people out
there either looking for work or looking to
start ventures and can't attract capital.
Until the capital markets recover, [ven
ture capital] funding won't recover, and
we might not see a recovery for another
three to four years."
Horowitz also hoped that Huang
would provide more detailed informa
tion. "I think it's great that he's making
himself available to the students and an
swering questions, but [he] didn't talk that
much about future directions for the in
dustry or the company," he said. "That's
really what I was here to see."
Tom Berard, a surgeon and assistant
professor at Stanford Medical School,
agreed with that analysis. "All of my
friends, many of whom are between jobs,
are just waiting for the upturn," he said.
He also disagreed with Huang's confi
dence in a rapid recovery, particularly due
to the threat of war in the Middle East.
"War stops everything," Berard said.
"People stop spending. They wait until
something's clear. In the very short term,
there will be a shock. Then, it depends on
how it goes. People spend money because
they feel safe enough to do that, and
there's a lot of uncertainty about that
now."
But Berard agreed that Silicon Valley is
a good environment for new businesses.
"I've been through several [economic
downturns], but the human spirit and op
timism and the capital in this area sup

ports [the spirit of] entrepreneurship and
innovation," he said.
Michael Pierantozzi, formerly an exec
utive at Hewlett Packard, thinks the econ
omy has reached a turning point.
"I have this belief that we're in a transi
tion point, and that while the economy is
still down and there seems to be a lot of
anxiety about geopolitical issues like Iraq,
these are the times that are typically high
innovation periods," he said.
"There are people taking risks in qui
eter ways than, say, two years ago. I do be
lieve that innovation will still go on; it'sjust
not hyped the way it was. I believe that's
healthier."
Pierantozzi works as a consultant and
believes that the impact of the unemploy
ment numbers might be exaggerated.
"For my colleagues around the Valley
that are, like myself, in transition from an
executive position looking for another op
portunity, it's less about being unem
ployed and more about being in a consult
ing role," he said.
Additionally, some sectors of the indus
try have seen a boom due to the economic
downturn. Paul Durieux, who works in
network security consulting, said that "ac
tually, it's been good for business — peo
ple are more concerned about security."
He works mostly with large companies,
specializing in the financial industry.
Unfortunately, students face a more
difficult situation. Tan Yung-Than, a

prospective Stanford student who
lives in Santa Clara, is rather un
certain about his prospects.
"Hopefully, by the time I come
out of college, there will be more
jobs," he said. Current students
also face similar concerns about
entering the job market.
"Getting an internship used to
be certain," said sophomore
Avichal Garg. "Now, a lot of com
panies have cut back significantly
and it has become very hard."
"I'm not sure there's a short
term solution for [the economy],"
Huang said. "All I can say is spend
less, save more, go to school, work
hard if you have a job. All the ba
sics that our mom and dad told us
as we were growing up are still
good ideas."
Huang spoke at the DFJ Entre
preneurial Thought Leaders Pro
gram, which is sponsored by the
Stanford Technology Ventures
Program and the Business Associ
ation of Stanford Engineering
Students.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of Santa
Clara-based NVIDIA, one of the leading
manufacturers of computer graphics
cards, predicted a long term revival of the
economy during a talk at Terman Audito
rium last week. But Huang did not ex
plain what would specifically drive the re
covery.
Figures released last week by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics showed no let
up in unemployment rates for California.
Unemployment increased slighdy from
6.5 percent in November to 6.6 percent in
December last year.
Such numbers did not deter Huang.
"The entrepreneur sees the world in a
perspective that the rest of us can't possi
bly," Huang said. "Ideas [are] what drive
innovation and innovation is what drives
the economy."
Huang did not elaborate on what will
reinvigorate Silicon Valley. "Ultimately,
there will be something besides high-tech
that becomes the next Internet boom," he
said. "There was the PC boom, there was
the Internet boom [and] there will be
some other boom beyond that. We don't
know what it is; otherwise we would be
doing it ourselves."
But others are not as optimistic that the
economy will rebound so quickly.
Spencer Horowitz, a business consultant
in Silicon Valley who was in the audience,
sees a gloomier outlook.

"There are fewer ventures being fund
ed," he said. "I see a lot of great people out
there either looking for work or looking to
start ventures and can't attract capital.
Until the capital markets recover, [ven
ture capital] funding won't recover, and
we might not see a recovery for another
three to four years."
Horowitz also hoped that Huang
would provide more detailed informa
tion. "I think it's great that he's making
himself available to the students and an
swering questions, but [he] didn't talk that
much about future directions for the in
dustry or the company," he said. "That's
really what I was here to see."
Tom Berard, a surgeon and assistant
professor at Stanford Medical School,
agreed with that analysis. "All of my
friends, many of whom are between jobs,
are just waiting for the upturn," he said.
He also disagreed with Huang's confi
dence in a rapid recovery, particularly due
to the threat of war in the Middle East.
"War stops everything," Berard said.
"People stop spending. They wait until
something's clear. In the very short term,
there will be a shock. Then, it depends on
how it goes. People spend money because
they feel safe enough to do that, and
there's a lot of uncertainty about that
now."
But Berard agreed that Silicon Valley is
a good environment for new businesses.
"I've been through several [economic
downturns], but the human spirit and op
timism and the capital in this area sup

ports [the spirit of] entrepreneurship and
innovation," he said.
Michael Pierantozzi, formerly an exec
utive at Hewlett Packard, thinks the econ
omy has reached a turning point.
"I have this belief that we're in a transi
tion point, and that while the economy is
still down and there seems to be a lot of
anxiety about geopolitical issues like Iraq,
these are the times that are typically high
innovation periods," he said.
"There are people taking risks in qui
eter ways than, say, two years ago. I do be
lieve that innovation will still go on; it'sjust
not hyped the way it was. I believe that's
healthier."
Pierantozzi works as a consultant and
believes that the impact of the unemploy
ment numbers might be exaggerated.
"For my colleagues around the Valley
that are, like myself, in transition from an
executive position looking for another op
portunity, it's less about being unem
ployed and more about being in a consult
ing role," he said.
Additionally, some sectors of the indus
try have seen a boom due to the economic
downturn. Paul Durieux, who works in
network security consulting, said that "ac
tually, it's been good for business — peo
ple are more concerned about security."
He works mostly with large companies,
specializing in the financial industry.
