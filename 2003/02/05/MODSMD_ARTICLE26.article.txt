# Telescope discovers massive black hole
## 
### AMIT GARG STAFF WRITER 
Growing evidence has virtual
ly established that a super-mas
sive black hole inhabits the cen
ter of the Milky Way. The Chan
dra telescope just made the most
detailed observations ever of this
giant body, weighing three mil
lion times the mass of the sun and
located 26,000 light years away.
By analyzing X-ray emissions,
Chandra found that the black
hole is prone to numerous out
bursts and occasional explosions.
Astronomers believe that this
happens because the black hole is
"starved" â€” it was more active
in the past and blew away most of
its core gases. Current theory
suggests that black holes arise
when large amounts of matter are
compressed into smaller vol
umes, yielding highly dense ma
terial. Black holes are typically
found in the center of galaxies or

locations following the explosion
of massive stars.
A study funded by the Nation
al Heart, Lung and Blood Insti
tute found that many highly ad
vertised, costly drugs for hyper
tension are no more effective than
traditional, cheap medicines. The
study involved 42,000 people and
represented a diverse cross-section
of American society. The re
searchers found that thiazide di
uretics ($25 / year) were as effec
tive as newer treatments like ACE
inhibitors ($250 / year) and calci
um channel blockers ($5OO / year).
Besides, doctors prescribe diuret
ics in smaller amounts, which
means fewer side effects. The au
thors agreed that newer drugs
have hypothetical advantages but
physicians might want to prescribe
them only for specific cases. They
further added that most hyperten
sion cases could simply be treated
with diuretics and exercise.
Ecologists studying Lyme dis
ease announced earlier this month
that Lyme disease spreads more
readily in areas of low biodiversity.
Lyme disease is caused by ticks and
can lead to nerve and heart damage,
and chronic arthritis if left untreat
ed. It affects more dian 16,000 peo
ple in the United States every year.
The researchers observed that in

areas with high biodiversity, the
ticks fed on many species that are
poor reservoirs for Lyme disease.
They suggest that a similar phe
nomenon occurs in other parasitic
infections, including Chagas dis
ease, which affects 17 million people
in South America.
Predicting earthquakes is an
inexact science. The Earth's crust
is so complex that not even the
most powerful computers today
can analyze current data to pin
point a future earthquake.
Nonetheless, there has been
progress. In recent years, seismol
ogists have noted that large earth
quakes influence the timing and
location of the next one. More

over, all else being equal, regions
in the Earth's crust showing more
stress will eventually be sites of an
earthquake. One of the primary
studies has been on the Bay Area.
After the great earthquake of
1906, the area has been relatively
safe from major earthquakes. Sci
entists found that the stress dissi
pated from that event spread far
away parallel to the San Andreas
fault. The result is lower seismic
activity, and a major cataclysm is
likely to occur far in the future.

X-ray data from the Chandra telescope suggests that a massive black hole,
weighing three million times the mass of the sun and located 26,000 light
years away, lies at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
