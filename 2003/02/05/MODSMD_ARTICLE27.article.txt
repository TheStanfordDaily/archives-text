The third and fourth install
ments of the chess game between
man and machine brought unex
pected results. Having lost to
IBM's Deep Junior computer pro
gram last Thursday, Garry Kas
parov fought to a draw on Sunday,
setting the score at 2-2 in the six
game chess series.
A fatal move by Kasparov cost
the former world chess champion
the game last Thursday. He domi
nated through the opening stage
and looked likely to win, or at least
draw, before making a catastroph
ic error.

Kasparov said he lost the
game when he blundered be
cause of fatigue.
"Kasparov had missed a spec
tacular checkmate variation that
caused him to lose another pawn
and the game," said Dutch chess
columnist Mig Greengard in an
online report.
Akin to the first game in the
match, Kasparov played an unex
pected move to force Deep Junior
to abandon its "opening book."
Despite dominating the board, he
faced an almost flawless defense
from the computer program.
" This is exactly how Grandmas
ters most often lose to computer
programs," Greegarnd said. "They

get excellent posi
tions and then
watch them un
ravel against near
perfect computer
defense."
At a press con
ference, Kas
parov admitted to
feeling despon-

dent following the loss. The
world's top-ranked player was un
happy at being tied with his com
puter opponent, feeling he had
played a better game throughout
the match.
Despite his defeat in game
three, Kasparov faced his oppo
nent with stern optimism last Sun

day in game four.
Deep Junior played with
white pieces and moved first,
putting Kasparov on the defen
sive. Kasparov repelled the com
puter's attacks until neither
player could make progress, re
sulting in a draw.
Sunday's game lasted about five
hours and 61 moves, making it the
longest of the series. The others
had been about four hours or less.
Kasparov hopes to capture the
match by winning the fifth game,
in which the computer will play
with black pieces, and getting at
least a draw in the sixth, the Asso
