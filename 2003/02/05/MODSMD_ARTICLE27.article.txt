The third and fourth install
ments of the chess game between
man and machine brought unex
pected results. Having lost to
IBM's Deep Junior computer pro
gram last Thursday, Garry Kas
parov fought to a draw on Sunday,
setting the score at 2-2 in the six
game chess series.
A fatal move by Kasparov cost
the former world chess champion
the game last Thursday. He domi
nated through the opening stage
and looked likely to win, or at least
draw, before making a catastroph
ic error.

Kasparov said he lost the
game when he blundered be
cause of fatigue.
"Kasparov had missed a spec
tacular checkmate variation that
caused him to lose another pawn
and the game," said Dutch chess
columnist Mig Greengard in an
online report.
Akin to the first game in the
match, Kasparov played an unex
pected move to force Deep Junior
to abandon its "opening book."
Despite dominating the board, he
faced an almost flawless defense
from the computer program.
" This is exactly how Grandmas
ters most often lose to computer
programs," Greegarnd said. "They

get excellent posi
tions and then
watch them un
ravel against near
perfect computer
defense."
At a press con
ference, Kas
parov admitted to
feeling despon-

dent following the loss. The
world's top-ranked player was un
happy at being tied with his com
puter opponent, feeling he had
played a better game throughout
the match.
Despite his defeat in game
three, Kasparov faced his oppo
nent with stern optimism last Sun

day in game four.
Deep Junior played with
white pieces and moved first,
putting Kasparov on the defen
sive. Kasparov repelled the com
puter's attacks until neither
player could make progress, re
sulting in a draw.
Sunday's game lasted about five
hours and 61 moves, making it the
longest of the series. The others
had been about four hours or less.
Kasparov hopes to capture the
match by winning the fifth game,
in which the computer will play
with black pieces, and getting at
least a draw in the sixth, the Asso


Kasporov
ciated Press said.
"Game 1 and Game 3 showed
that Deep Junior has significant
problems with the black pieces,"
Kasparov said.
Having lost to IBM's Deep
Blue in 1997, Kasparov has been
keen on evening the score for
over six years.
Unlike Deep Blue, which was
a custom-built supercomputer,
Deep Junior is computer code
that runs on standard hardware.
The team that designed Deep Ju
nior said their program employs
a more sophisticated move-selec
tion algorithm, considering only

the strongest possible positions
in detail.
"The Artificial] Intelligence]
chess game tries to enumerate
every single possible move from
the current configuration of the
board," said Pedram Keyani, a
Stanford computer science grad
uate student. "Then it builds a
huge game tree and does a deep
search to find the best possible
move."
IBM's Shay Bushinsky, who co
designed Deep Junior with Amir
Ban, said "behind [Deep Junior] is
the accumulation of a lot of effort,
and this is the epitome of what we
are doing."
Feng-hsiung Hsu, one of the
principle designers of Deep Blue,
claims Kasparov's current oppo
nent has significant shortcomings.

He predicts that Kasparov will
beat Deep Junior.
"Deep Junior has serious prob
lems with positional play and it is
not clear that they can compensate
by changing the [opening] book,"
Hsu told New Scientist.
The match is sanctioned by the
World Chess Federation, which
will pay Kasparov $500,000 for
playing and another $300,000 if
he beats Deep Junior.
Deep Junior, a three-time
world champion, won the last of
ficial world chess championship
for computers in July. It has not
lost a match against a human in
two years.
The match will further un
ravel as Kasparov and Deep Ju
nior go at it once again today for
game five.
