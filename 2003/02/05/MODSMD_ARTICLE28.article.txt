# Gov't tech spending boosts Silicon Valley

### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
As Silicon Valley's economy
lingers in a recession, the next in
jection of growth could come from
the federal government.
The federal government's
chief information officer, Mark
Forman, proposed a 12 percent
increase in technology spending
for fiscal 2004, designed in part to
improve systems to protect
homeland security, as reported
by the Associated Press.
The proposed $59 billion tech
nology budget is a potential shot
in the arm for Silicon Valley com
panies that specialize in security
products and other technologies
in high demand by the govern
ment. But the complexity and
specialized nature of the applica
tions needed by the government
and the lengthy federal procure
ment process means that compa
nies need to move quickly to se
cure their slice of the cake.
One such company is Sky -
tream Networks in Sunnyvale,
which builds equipment and
software to deliver video and

data over wired and wireless net
works. Founded in 1996, the pri
vately held company's technolo
gy allows information to be
transmitted simultaneously to a
number of people at different
sites over satellite or land-based
communication networks.
Tom Sauer, Sky Stream's direc
tor of business development, said
that the company's products,
which are used mainly in commer
cial settings, also have government
and military uses. For example,
the technology could be used to
transmit information such as satel
lite images, surveillance and map
ping data to remote offices or
troops in the field.
The ability to communicate in
formation quickly and securely be
tween different sites is an impor
tant component of the govern
ment's efforts to combat terrorism.
"[Disseminating] information
out in real-time becomes increas
ingly important as you start to
think about the war on terrorism,"
Sauer said.
