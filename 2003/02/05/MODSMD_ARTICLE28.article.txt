# Gov't tech spending boosts Silicon Valley
## 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
As Silicon Valley's economy
lingers in a recession, the next in
jection of growth could come from
the federal government.
The federal government's
chief information officer, Mark
Forman, proposed a 12 percent
increase in technology spending
for fiscal 2004, designed in part to
improve systems to protect
homeland security, as reported
by the Associated Press.
The proposed $59 billion tech
nology budget is a potential shot
in the arm for Silicon Valley com
panies that specialize in security
products and other technologies
in high demand by the govern
ment. But the complexity and
specialized nature of the applica
tions needed by the government
and the lengthy federal procure
ment process means that compa
nies need to move quickly to se
cure their slice of the cake.
One such company is Sky -
tream Networks in Sunnyvale,
which builds equipment and
software to deliver video and

data over wired and wireless net
works. Founded in 1996, the pri
vately held company's technolo
gy allows information to be
transmitted simultaneously to a
number of people at different
sites over satellite or land-based
communication networks.
Tom Sauer, Sky Stream's direc
tor of business development, said
that the company's products,
which are used mainly in commer
cial settings, also have government
and military uses. For example,
the technology could be used to
transmit information such as satel
lite images, surveillance and map
ping data to remote offices or
troops in the field.
The ability to communicate in
formation quickly and securely be
tween different sites is an impor
tant component of the govern
ment's efforts to combat terrorism.
"[Disseminating] information
out in real-time becomes increas
ingly important as you start to
think about the war on terrorism,"
Sauer said.
Since terrorist organizations
such as Al-Qaida work as a global
network of terrorist cells, effective
communications between differ
ent government agencies is critical.
"Terrorism is very distributed . ..
a senator in a limo needs to be able
to pop up a laptop and receive data
immediately," Sauer added.
In the wake of the Sept. 11 at
tacks, Sky Stream responded to a
call put out by the Department of
Defense to build a trial version of a
digital emergency broadcast sys
tem that could transmit content
and live streaming video to mobile
laptop emergency units around
Ground Zero. The network acted
as a backup communications sys
tem for the networks that had been
taken out by the attacks.
One advantage of Sky Stream's
technology is that it is based on
open Internet standards, making
it more compatible with other
communications systems.
"This allows the government to
use more commercially based

products and not so many propri
etary systems," Sauer said.
The government agrees.
"We're moving to take more ad
vantage of technologies coming
out of Silicon Valley, as opposed to
the government trying to jury-rig
our own versions of technology,"
Forman said, at a conference host
ed by Oracle Corporation in San
Diego last week, as reported by the
San Francisco Chronicle.
The increase in government
spending on technology will not
be an automatic windfall for Sili
con Valley firms, however. The
first hurdle companies face is
Fierce competition for govern
ment contracts.
"Because of the sluggish com
mercial economy, there's a lot
more competition moving into the
federal space," Sauer said.
The second hurdle technology
companies, especially small start
ups, face is long and complex gov
ernment procurement cycles.
Sauer said that the government
has broadly similar rules of en
gagement to commercial deals.
But the government also has its
own special rules and "this is

where a lot of commercial compa
nies get into a little bit of trouble,"
he said.
Selling to the government can
take a long time and often in
volves installing highly complex
systems and technologies while
taking account of security and se
crecy considerations.
According to Sauer, when many
companies saw their commercial
sales dry up, they tried to move
into selling to the government.
"[But] it's not quite that easy," he
added.
Sky Stream only recently began
to target the federal sector by
opening a sales office in the Wash
ington D.C. area in December last
year. But Sauer projects that the
company's federal sales will grow
rapidly over the next two years.
"We are very bullish about
where the government [business]
is going, and how our products will
be used," he said.
While there is little doubt that
Silicon Valley will benefit from the
government's spending plans,
only time will tell which firms will
be the individual winners and
losers.
