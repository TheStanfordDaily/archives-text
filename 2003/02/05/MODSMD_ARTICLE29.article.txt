If you are always tired and achy,
it might not be because of your
all-nighters or over-exertion
during afternoon practice. You
might have what is clinically called
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. In fact, if
you had CFS then you would not have
enough energy to do normal activities
like sit through lecture awake or go
shopping at the mall.
CFS has been compared to a seri-

ous hangover that lingers inside your bones for weeks, months and
even years. Unfortunately, a few good nights of sleep will not take
care of the condition. And fighting through it will cause you to be
come more exhausted. But that does not mean that you have to lose
out on life because of CFS. There are lifestyle options and treat
ments that can help. The trick is diagnosing CFS early before it
bedriddens you.
CFS is a very confusing condition because there are no set caus
es. Some people get CFS after dealing with mono or a serious cold
or flu. Others report getting CFS after times of heavy stress. CFS can
be due to anemia (iron-deficient blood), hypoglycemia (low blood
sugar), allergies, chronic infectious mononucleosis or body-wide
yeast infections.
To make things worse, diagnosing CFS is hard because many ill
nesses can lead to side effects. For example, your fatigue may be due

to sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism,
eating disorders, depression, can
cer or autoimmune diseases. So
how do you know if you have CFS?
Contemporary medicine has
identified two criteria for diagnos
ing CFS.
First, you must have severe
chronic fatigue of six months or
longer duration with other known
medical conditions excluded by
clinical diagnosis.
Second, patients exhibit four or
more of the following symptoms:
substantial impairment in short

term memory or concentration,
sore throat, tender lymph nodes,
muscle pain, multi-joint pain with
out swelling or redness, headaches
of unusual severity, unrefreshing
sleep and post-exertional malaise
lasting more than 24 hours.
If you meet both criteria then
you should make a trip to your
general practitioner. Because of
the difficulty of diagnosing CFS,
your doctor might do tests that will
exclude other possible causes of
your conditions.
Once your doctor has excluded
all other illnesses, he or she can
help you, but don't expect to be
given a miracle drug. Doctors still
do not know how to cure CFS so
your best bet would be to change

your lifestyle. You can help by eat
ing a balanced diet, managing your
stress, getting eight hours of sleep a
night, exercising regularly (but not
over-exerting) and recognizing
what times of the day you feel ex
hausted. Being mentally and psy
chologically cognizant of your body
will aide in your recovery.
If you need medications, your
doctor can give you low-dose tri
cyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs), anxiolytic agents, SRIs
(serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or
benzodiazepines. As of now, it is
not known whether any of these
drugs cure CFS completely, but
they have been proven to de
crease the severity of the symp-

Toms of CFS.
Should you be worrying about
CFS? CFS affects more women
than men and is an equal opportu
nity disease affecting all races and
ethnic groups. It usually strikes be
tween the ages of 20 and 40. But
cases have been reported in chil
dren as young as 12 years of age.
So if you feel like you might
have CFS, do something about it.
In general, it is a good idea to see
your doctor whenever you feel that
something is not right with your
body. It is always better to err on
the side of precaution.
