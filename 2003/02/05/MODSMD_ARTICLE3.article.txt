# Sen. approves proposal for student space
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate ap
proved the Campaign for Student Space's rec
ommendation last night, calling for the Uni
versity to renovate Tresidder Union, expand
the Black Community Student Center and the
LGBT-Community Resource Center and cre
ate a new Interfaith Center.
The proposal was drafted by ASSU Senator
Joey Natoli, a sophomore, after research into
student space needs. It was determined that
the current spaces on campus, including
Tresidder, the BCSC and the LBGT-CRC, do
not accommodate the demands of student
groups. Additionally, the requirements of a
variety of religious groups on campus re
newed the idea of the Interfaith Center, which
was initially proposed during the '80s. The
center would be "a working location for many
of the religious groups" that would "facilitate
collaboration, the exchange of ideas and
greater tolerance among religions on cam
pus," according to the recommendation's
cover letter.
These recommendations were sent to

Provost John Etchernendy, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni and Director of
Capital Planning Margaret Dyer-Chamberlain.
"We hope to gain more discussion about
possible ways to incorporate these ideas in fu
ture University plans as well as maintain a stu
dent voice in those plans," Natoli said.
Additionally, Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a junior, continued work on estab

lishing an Arts Grant program that would uti
lize the ASSU's sizable General Fee Reserve.
The program would fund up to $15,000 of in
dividual student art projects, with each grant
ranging from $300 to $1000.
The program would be part of a larger
plan to utilize the General Fee Reserve, which

consists of unused General Fee
funds that are returned to the
ASSU by student groups. Under
Rodriguez's proposed financial
policy for the reserve, funds may
be used for long-term investment
or short-term service projects —
like the Arts Grant program — as
long as the reserve remains above
a lower limit.
"The first application would be
the Arts Grant program, but it

would hopefully serve many other
projects from here on out," Ro
driguez said.
Other senators argued that an
upper-limit to spending should be
set instead, so as to prevent reck
less spending.
"I think we may want to articu
late this a bit more before we spend
this vast sum of money that has ac
cumulated fora long time," said
senator Brigitte Zimmerman,. a
sophomore.
The bill was tabled until next
week.
General Fee funds were also ap
proved for the Educational Studies

Program, Fleet Street and Talis
man a cappella groups, the Young
Communist League, the NAACP,
Women's Club Soccer, the Latin
American Film Society, Bent
Spoon Dance Company and the
Stanford Undergraduate Psychol
ogy Association.
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Bo Cowgill, a senior, brought up
the University of Michigan affir
mative action case and suggested
that perhaps the ASSU could sup
port the Faculty Senate's position
in favor of affirmative action.
While some senators supported
the idea, others objected that it

could alienate the portions of their
constituency that opposed affirma
tive action.
"I think the ASSU should be
wary about dipping its hands into
things of this political nature," Na
toli said.
The idea was also tabled for fur
ther discussion next week.
The meeting ended with final
comments from ASSU President
Monica Henestroza, a senior, in
cluding recommendations that
senators "follow the issues about
frosh clustering, as [they] repre
sent the constituency that would be
affected."
