### MORGAN SPRINGER EDITORIAL STAFF 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate ap
proved the Campaign for Student Space's rec
ommendation last night, calling for the Uni
versity to renovate Tresidder Union, expand
the Black Community Student Center and the
LGBT-Community Resource Center and cre
ate a new Interfaith Center.
The proposal was drafted by ASSU Senator
Joey Natoli, a sophomore, after research into
student space needs. It was determined that
the current spaces on campus, including
Tresidder, the BCSC and the LBGT-CRC, do
not accommodate the demands of student
groups. Additionally, the requirements of a
variety of religious groups on campus re
newed the idea of the Interfaith Center, which
was initially proposed during the '80s. The
center would be "a working location for many
of the religious groups" that would "facilitate
collaboration, the exchange of ideas and
greater tolerance among religions on cam
pus," according to the recommendation's
cover letter.
These recommendations were sent to

Provost John Etchernendy, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni and Director of
Capital Planning Margaret Dyer-Chamberlain.
"We hope to gain more discussion about
possible ways to incorporate these ideas in fu
ture University plans as well as maintain a stu
dent voice in those plans," Natoli said.
Additionally, Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a junior, continued work on estab

lishing an Arts Grant program that would uti
lize the ASSU's sizable General Fee Reserve.
The program would fund up to $15,000 of in
dividual student art projects, with each grant
ranging from $300 to $1000.
The program would be part of a larger
plan to utilize the General Fee Reserve, which
