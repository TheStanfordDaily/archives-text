# Microsoft agrees to European demands
## 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
After a six-month probe by
the European Union, Microsoft
last week agreed to make signifi
cant changes to its .Net Passport
service to protect the privacy of
its users.
Launched in 1999, Mi
crosoft's Passport service allows
Web users to create a single sign
in name and password that can
be used across all participating
Web sites. The technology is de
signed to make surfing and
shopping on the Internet more
convenient, since users only
need to remember a single sign
in name and password to access
a range of services.
But regulators and privacy
advocacy groups in the United
States and Europe are con
cerned that the Passport system
would facilitate the centraliza
tion of information on cus
tomers in large databases.
The European Union's work
ing party on data protection, the

group that negotiated with Mi
crosoft on the changes, says that
Microsoft will need to make
"substantial changes" to its Pass
port system. In the future, Euro
peans signing up fora Passport
account will be prompted to
look at a summary of their priva
cy rights under E.U. law, as well
as receive a link to the European
Commission's Web site on data
protection laws.
In addition, Microsoft
agreed to give Passport users in
Europe and around the world
more control over the informa
tion they share with Passport
and participating sites, on a site
by-site basis. Users will also be
given information on how to
create more secure passwords.
Some of these changes will take
as little as two months to imple
ment, while others may take as
long as 18 months.
There are over 250 million
Passport accounts registered
worldwide, and 69 non-Mi
crosoft Web sites use the service,
according to the E.U. working
party's report. Everyone who signs
up fora Microsoft Hotmail e-mail
account is automatically given a
Passport account, and many of Mi
crosoft's other online services now
require users to sign up for Pass
port accounts.
"The bottom line is that users'
data will be better protected,"
said Frits Bolkenstein, internal
market commissioner for the
E.U. in a press release. "The in
dustry in general now needs to
take on board the working
party's guidelines when develop
ing new systems."
Microsoft spokesman Brian Pe
terson said the agreement will re
inforce the company's philosophy
of putting the user in control of the
information they share on the
Passport service.
"Microsoft remains committed
to working constructively with
data protection authorities around

the world, as it works with other in
dustry leaders to promote privacy
online and ensure users enjoy a
safe and secure experience," Peter
son wrote in an e-mail.
The agreement comes at a time
of heightened concern about data
security and privacy. The recent
"SQL Slammer" worm, a destruc
tive program that dramatically
slowed down worldwide Internet
traffic, exploited weaknesses in Mi

crosoft's software designed to run
on server computers. The E.U.
working party's report noted that
Microsoft is a high-profile target
for hackers.
This is also a sensitive time for
Microsoft's relationship with the
EU. European regulators are soon
expected to conclude their long
running anti-trust investigation
into the company.
Although the E.U. working

party said that its discussions with
Microsoft had been "open and
fruitful," this is not the first time
the company has clashed with
privacy advocacy groups and pol
icy makers.
In August last year, the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission con
cluded that Microsoft deceived
consumers about how well it pro
tects their privacy and forced the
company to put its Passport ser
vice through regular checks for
the next two decades, according
to Associated Press reports. The
action stemmed from formal
complaint by a coalition of groups
led by Electronic Privacy Infor
mation Center (EPIC), a hi-tech
policy and advocacy group in
Washington.
Marc Rotenberg, executive di
rector of EPIC, said that the FTC's
decision last year might have con
tributed to the action by the Euro
pean Union.
"I think the key is to understand
that privacy protection enables the
use of new technologies," wrote
Rotenberg in an e-mail. "Privacy
protection promotes consumer
confidence which encourages con

sumer acceptance of new services."
"Privacy is the number one con
sumer concern on the Internet
today," Rotenberg added. "Mi
crosoft, and every other company
operating online, has to take these
issues seriously".
The working party will contin
ue to monitor Microsoft's Pass
port service, as well as a rival —
but not yet operational — tech
nology created by the Liberty Al
liance, a consortium of 150 com
panies and consumer organiza
tions led by Sun Microsystems.
Although new Internet services
evolve rapidly, Rotenberg is confi
dent that the law will be able to
keep up with the development of
new technologies such as Passport.
"Throughout the 20th century,
there were many great technologi
cal innovations in communica
tions, in data processing, and con
sumer services. But privacy laws
were also established to safeguard
telephone calls, personal informa
tion in government agencies, and
records of video rentals and cable
subscribers," Rotenberg said. "We
face a similar challenge with online
identification services."

After a six-month probe by
the European Union, Microsoft
last week agreed to make signifi
cant changes to its .Net Passport
service to protect the privacy of
its users.
Launched in 1999, Mi
crosoft's Passport service allows
Web users to create a single sign
in name and password that can
be used across all participating
Web sites. The technology is de
signed to make surfing and
shopping on the Internet more
convenient, since users only
need to remember a single sign
in name and password to access
a range of services.
But regulators and privacy
advocacy groups in the United
States and Europe are con
cerned that the Passport system
would facilitate the centraliza
tion of information on cus
tomers in large databases.
The European Union's work
ing party on data protection, the

group that negotiated with Mi
crosoft on the changes, says that
Microsoft will need to make
"substantial changes" to its Pass
port system. In the future, Euro
peans signing up fora Passport
account will be prompted to
look at a summary of their priva
cy rights under E.U. law, as well
as receive a link to the European
Commission's Web site on data
protection laws.
In addition, Microsoft
agreed to give Passport users in
Europe and around the world
more control over the informa
tion they share with Passport
and participating sites, on a site
by-site basis. Users will also be
given information on how to
create more secure passwords.
Some of these changes will take
as little as two months to imple
ment, while others may take as
long as 18 months.
There are over 250 million
Passport accounts registered
worldwide, and 69 non-Mi
crosoft Web sites use the service,
according to the E.U. working
party's report. Everyone who signs
up fora Microsoft Hotmail e-mail
account is automatically given a
Passport account, and many of Mi
crosoft's other online services now
require users to sign up for Pass
port accounts.
"The bottom line is that users'
data will be better protected,"
said Frits Bolkenstein, internal
market commissioner for the
E.U. in a press release. "The in
dustry in general now needs to
take on board the working
party's guidelines when develop
ing new systems."
Microsoft spokesman Brian Pe
terson said the agreement will re
inforce the company's philosophy
of putting the user in control of the
information they share on the
Passport service.
"Microsoft remains committed
to working constructively with
data protection authorities around

the world, as it works with other in
dustry leaders to promote privacy
online and ensure users enjoy a
safe and secure experience," Peter
son wrote in an e-mail.
The agreement comes at a time
of heightened concern about data
security and privacy. The recent
"SQL Slammer" worm, a destruc
tive program that dramatically
slowed down worldwide Internet
traffic, exploited weaknesses in Mi

crosoft's software designed to run
on server computers. The E.U.
working party's report noted that
Microsoft is a high-profile target
for hackers.
This is also a sensitive time for
Microsoft's relationship with the
EU. European regulators are soon
expected to conclude their long
running anti-trust investigation
into the company.
Although the E.U. working

party said that its discussions with
Microsoft had been "open and
fruitful," this is not the first time
the company has clashed with
privacy advocacy groups and pol
icy makers.
In August last year, the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission con
cluded that Microsoft deceived
consumers about how well it pro
tects their privacy and forced the
company to put its Passport ser
vice through regular checks for
the next two decades, according
to Associated Press reports. The
action stemmed from formal
complaint by a coalition of groups
led by Electronic Privacy Infor
mation Center (EPIC), a hi-tech
policy and advocacy group in
Washington.
Marc Rotenberg, executive di
rector of EPIC, said that the FTC's
decision last year might have con
tributed to the action by the Euro
pean Union.
"I think the key is to understand
that privacy protection enables the
use of new technologies," wrote
Rotenberg in an e-mail. "Privacy
protection promotes consumer
confidence which encourages con

sumer acceptance of new services."
"Privacy is the number one con
sumer concern on the Internet
today," Rotenberg added. "Mi
crosoft, and every other company
operating online, has to take these
issues seriously".
The working party will contin
ue to monitor Microsoft's Pass
port service, as well as a rival —
but not yet operational — tech
nology created by the Liberty Al
liance, a consortium of 150 com
panies and consumer organiza
tions led by Sun Microsystems.
Although new Internet services
evolve rapidly, Rotenberg is confi
dent that the law will be able to
keep up with the development of
new technologies such as Passport.

tion in government agencies, and
records of video rentals and cable
