After a six-month probe by
the European Union, Microsoft
last week agreed to make signifi
cant changes to its .Net Passport
service to protect the privacy of
its users.
Launched in 1999, Mi
crosoft's Passport service allows
Web users to create a single sign
in name and password that can
be used across all participating
Web sites. The technology is de
signed to make surfing and
shopping on the Internet more
convenient, since users only
need to remember a single sign
in name and password to access
a range of services.
But regulators and privacy
advocacy groups in the United
States and Europe are con
cerned that the Passport system
would facilitate the centraliza
tion of information on cus
tomers in large databases.
The European Union's work
ing party on data protection, the

group that negotiated with Mi
crosoft on the changes, says that
Microsoft will need to make
"substantial changes" to its Pass
port system. In the future, Euro
peans signing up fora Passport
account will be prompted to
look at a summary of their priva
cy rights under E.U. law, as well
as receive a link to the European
Commission's Web site on data
protection laws.
In addition, Microsoft
agreed to give Passport users in
Europe and around the world
more control over the informa
tion they share with Passport
and participating sites, on a site
by-site basis. Users will also be
given information on how to
create more secure passwords.
Some of these changes will take
as little as two months to imple
ment, while others may take as
long as 18 months.
There are over 250 million
Passport accounts registered
worldwide, and 69 non-Mi
