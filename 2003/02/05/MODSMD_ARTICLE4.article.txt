# ISIS centralizes campus publicity

Students working to revolutionize the way that
Stanford shares news now project that personalized
Web sites, the first phase of their project intended to
give students better access to events, will available in a
matter of weeks.
By the end of February, students will be able to
start using Innovative Student Information Services,
a project designed to bring the campus together by
better publicizing Stanford events.
ISIS and the Office of University Communications,
responsible for My.Stanford, have designed a Web site
to centralize information on campus activities. This
Web site will eventually be personalized to each user,
like Amazon.com. Many campus bodies — such as
Overseas Studies, the Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts and the Department of Athletics — have al
ready expressed interest in ISIS. The project team
hopes to include residences in the future.
ISIS is a non-profit project that began last July in
response to concerns about the difficulty of advertis
ing events to the entire campus. It seeks to provide a
central source of information and build a stronger
sense of community by bringing knowledge of activi
ties to more people. A core team of around 18 stu
dents, ranging from freshmen to doctoral candidates
with a mix of technical and non-technical back
grounds, worked to get the project funded and de
signed.
"We've got enough seed funding to get off the
ground," said Scott Cannon, a senior in electrical en
gineering and one of the project's co-founders. "The
challenge is to evaluate success."
The team's goal is to find an innovative way to im
prove inefficient e-mail and to create "a one-touch up
date system that saves the hassle of having to flyer"
Cannon said. "Student groups will post directly to the
Web site."
He added, "It's a realm that hasn't been ap
proached on any other campus, and we've done lots
of research. We have a lot of new, cool technology and
we want to integrate it with tried and true [systems]."
The second phase of the project is a multi-media
network of high definition television displays around
campus that will appear by April. Right now, ISIS is
prototyping the screens.
"We have a test group of about 50 student groups

for the beta phase," Cannon said.
"The first locations will be in
dining halls, the libraries like
Green and Meyer, the bookstore
and Tresidder," he said. "We want
to test these locations for user
feedback."
ISIS will also emphasize im
proved video communications for
Stanford students.
Technical lead and co-founder
Kyle Doerksen, a junior with an
independendy designed major in
neuroengineering, talked about
how ISIS can improve video cre
ation and distribution.
"Some student groups like the
swim team and the men's soccer
team have independently put out
video and distributed it by e-mail,"
Doerksen said. "It's very taxing on
the Stanford network and the
video quality is poor."
ISIS will make available for
download stock footage that can
be used in student video produc
tion.
"Video is our most pervasive
medium," he said. "It [communi
cates] a lot of information but also
embellishes a group's character.
All the cluster computers can edit
video and [at] Meyer as well.
We'll allow you to distribute this
video."
ISIS wants to distinguish itself
from a portal like My.Stanford.

Rather than going to other Web
sites, the ISIS site will be a one
stop source of information.
"We're not trying to be a por
tal," Doerkson said. "When peo
ple think, 'What am I going to do
tonight?', they'll go to ISIS."
For now, the project is secure in
its financial backing, but it must
have student support to continue.
"We've been lucky, but any
project on campus has questions
down the road," Cannon said.
"We need to make [the] project
impressive to inspire further in
vestment."
Doerksen described ISIS as
capitalizing on its position in Sili
con Valley, with connections in
HP Labs and Xerox Palo Alto Re
search Center. While excited
about the current implementa
tion, he wonders what improve
ments they can make "one, three
or five years out."
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior, joined the project
when ISIS student organizers ap
proached her asking for ASSU
support.
"I have been impressed by how
many students continue to join the
team," Henestroza said. "Not only
is the feedback positive, but some
students are so committed to the
vision that they feel compelled to
contribute to its implementation.
Perhaps more than anything else,
this kind of buy-in so early on
makes me feel that ISIS will suc
ceed in bringing the campus com
munity together."

"We're not trying to be a por
tal," Doerkson said. "When peo
ple think, 'What am I going to do
tonight?', they'll go to ISIS."
For now, the project is secure in
its financial backing, but it must
have student support to continue.
"We've been lucky, but any
project on campus has questions
down the road," Cannon said.
"We need to make [the] project
impressive to inspire further in
vestment."
Doerksen described ISIS as
capitalizing on its position in Sili
con Valley, with connections in
HP Labs and Xerox Palo Alto Re
search Center. While excited
about the current implementa
tion, he wonders what improve
ments they can make "one, three
or five years out."
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza, a senior, joined the project
when ISIS student organizers ap
proached her asking for ASSU
support.
"I have been impressed by how
many students continue to join the
team," Henestroza said. "Not only
is the feedback positive, but some
students are so committed to the
vision that they feel compelled to
contribute to its implementation.
Perhaps more than anything else,
this kind of buy-in so early on
makes me feel that ISIS will suc
ceed in bringing the campus com
munity together."
