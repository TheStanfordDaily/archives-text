Students working to revolutionize the way that
Stanford shares news now project that personalized
Web sites, the first phase of their project intended to
give students better access to events, will available in a
matter of weeks.
By the end of February, students will be able to
start using Innovative Student Information Services,
a project designed to bring the campus together by
better publicizing Stanford events.
ISIS and the Office of University Communications,
responsible for My.Stanford, have designed a Web site
to centralize information on campus activities. This
Web site will eventually be personalized to each user,
like Amazon.com. Many campus bodies — such as
Overseas Studies, the Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts and the Department of Athletics — have al

hopes to include residences in the future.
ISIS is a non-profit project that began last July in
response to concerns about the difficulty of advertis

central source of information and build a stronger
sense of community by bringing knowledge of activi

with a mix of technical and non-technical back
grounds, worked to get the project funded and de
signed.
"We've got enough seed funding to get off the
ground," said Scott Cannon, a senior in electrical en
gineering and one of the project's co-founders. "The
challenge is to evaluate success."
The team's goal is to find an innovative way to im
prove inefficient e-mail and to create "a one-touch up
date system that saves the hassle of having to flyer"
Cannon said. "Student groups will post directly to the
Web site."
He added, "It's a realm that hasn't been ap
proached on any other campus, and we've done lots
of research. We have a lot of new, cool technology and
we want to integrate it with tried and true [systems]."
The second phase of the project is a multi-media
network of high definition television displays around
campus that will appear by April. Right now, ISIS is
prototyping the screens.
"We have a test group of about 50 student groups
