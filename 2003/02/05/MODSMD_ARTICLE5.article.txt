Kirsten Leute, a licensing associate in Stan
ford's Office of Technology Licensing.
"That invention was a part of this lawsuit."
Leute continued, "[Ringold] was at the
University at the time. If a licensee subli

of those payments as well."
Leute explained that the payment struc

at Stanford, the University did not play a
