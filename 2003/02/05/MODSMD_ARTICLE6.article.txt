Many have lauded the success of
Stanford's efforts to increase under
graduate diversity, but the Univer
sity's attempts at the graduate stu
dent level have yielded far fewer
gains. According to data provided
by the Registrar's Office, none of
Stanford's seven schools has seen a
substantial increase in either the
number of minority applicants or
the number of minority enrollees
over the past decade. Some schools,
such as the School of Law, have
even seen a drop in the number of
minority applicants over that time.
This lack of improvement comes
despite the efforts of the seven
schools and their departments to re
cruit a greater number of minority
students.
In the past few years, the admin
istration has taken steps to address
the problem by meeting with mem
bers of different minority graduate
groups, and Humanities and Sci
ences recendy hired two new assis
tant deans for diversity.
The issue was also addressed by
Provost John Etchemendy's Gradu
ate Diversity Council, whose recom
mendations were incorporated into
a proposal submitted to the James
Irvine Foundation which has given
the University a 3-year, $1.5 million
gi ant. Some of the funds will be
used to create a new University
wide position — assistant dean of
graduate diversity — who will coor
dinate the currently decentralized
graduate admissions process. The
process is now conducted most
often by individual departments
without oversight from their re
spective schools, much less from the
University as a whole.
According to Ayodele Thomas, a
doctoral student in electrical engi
neering who has participated in

some of the talks
with
Etchemendy,
the continuing
problem with
graduate diver
sity is particular
ly troubling in

light of reports released in 1989 and
1994.
"In '89, there was a crisis situa
tion," Thomas said. "Our numbers
were way too low; we shouldn't be
this bad ... So the question was,
OK, if in '89 it was a crisis situation,
and in 1999-2000 [when the talks
started] it's the same or worse, what
is that saying?"
The statistics on graduate diver
sity also appear disappointing when
compared to the corresponding sta
tistics for undergraduates. Accord
ing to data released by the Regis
trar's Office, African Americans
make up 10.3 percent of Stanford's
undergraduate population, but
only three percent of graduate stu
dents.
A school without diversity can be
a 'Pandora's box of problems"
Tiffany Showell, the associate
dean of MBA admissions at the
Graduate School of Business, and
Godfrey Mungal, the associate dean
for graduate policy, said the prob
lem is only partially solvable on a
graduate level.
"We're competing with top uni
versities fora very, very small pool
of qualified applicants," Showell
said.
Still, according to Thomas, the
University cannot evade at least
part of the responsibility for the
lackluster results of its recruitment
efforts. She said the blame largely
falls on the administration's failure
to make minority students feel wel
come or supported.
"If someone comes to me and
says, 'How committed is Stanford to
diversity?' I have to tell them the
