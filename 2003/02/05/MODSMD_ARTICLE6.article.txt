Many have lauded the success of
Stanford's efforts to increase under
graduate diversity, but the Univer
sity's attempts at the graduate stu
dent level have yielded far fewer
gains. According to data provided
by the Registrar's Office, none of
Stanford's seven schools has seen a
substantial increase in either the
number of minority applicants or
the number of minority enrollees
over the past decade. Some schools,
such as the School of Law, have
even seen a drop in the number of
minority applicants over that time.
This lack of improvement comes
despite the efforts of the seven
schools and their departments to re
cruit a greater number of minority
students.
In the past few years, the admin
istration has taken steps to address
the problem by meeting with mem
bers of different minority graduate
groups, and Humanities and Sci
ences recendy hired two new assis
tant deans for diversity.
The issue was also addressed by
Provost John Etchemendy's Gradu
ate Diversity Council, whose recom
mendations were incorporated into
a proposal submitted to the James
Irvine Foundation which has given
the University a 3-year, $1.5 million
gi ant. Some of the funds will be
used to create a new University
wide position — assistant dean of
graduate diversity — who will coor
dinate the currently decentralized
graduate admissions process. The
process is now conducted most
often by individual departments
without oversight from their re
spective schools, much less from the
University as a whole.
According to Ayodele Thomas, a
doctoral student in electrical engi
neering who has participated in

some of the talks
with
Etchemendy,
the continuing
problem with
graduate diver
sity is particular
ly troubling in

light of reports released in 1989 and
1994.
"In '89, there was a crisis situa
tion," Thomas said. "Our numbers
were way too low; we shouldn't be
this bad ... So the question was,
OK, if in '89 it was a crisis situation,
and in 1999-2000 [when the talks
started] it's the same or worse, what
is that saying?"
The statistics on graduate diver
sity also appear disappointing when
compared to the corresponding sta
tistics for undergraduates. Accord
ing to data released by the Regis
trar's Office, African Americans
make up 10.3 percent of Stanford's
undergraduate population, but
only three percent of graduate stu
dents.
A school without diversity can be
a 'Pandora's box of problems"
Tiffany Showell, the associate
dean of MBA admissions at the
Graduate School of Business, and
Godfrey Mungal, the associate dean
for graduate policy, said the prob
lem is only partially solvable on a
graduate level.
"We're competing with top uni
versities fora very, very small pool
of qualified applicants," Showell
said.
Still, according to Thomas, the
University cannot evade at least
part of the responsibility for the
lackluster results of its recruitment
efforts. She said the blame largely
falls on the administration's failure
to make minority students feel wel
come or supported.
"If someone comes to me and
says, 'How committed is Stanford to
diversity?' I have to tell them the

truth," Thomas said. "At the under
graduate level, they're very commit
ted. At the graduate student level,
it's some lip service you see put away
in some report... which is why
Stanford's numbers haven't in
creased— because the University
as a whole has not put an emphasis
in general on recruiting diversity
candidates on a graduate level."
Thomas added that minority stu
dents accepted to graduate pro
grams often choose schools with
more diverse graduate student bod
ies because coming to a school with
out existing diversity presents an
unappealing Pandora's box of social
and academic problems.
"Whenever you're in a place
where you're alone, it's very discon
certing," she said. "I'm walking
down the hall like, 'Dang, why didn't
nobody wave at me?' Over the
years... it's gotten much better."
She added, "But when I first got
here, if I was looking for support
within my department to make me
want to stay, I would be gone."
Showell said that the Business
School often encounters a similar
situation in its competition with
Harvard's larger business school.
"On average, we admit 365 stu
dents, while Harvard admits 800,"
she said. " We do our best to admit
all the qualified minority applicants,
but then they compare the number
of African Americans at Harvard
with the number of African Ameri
cans here, and we lose on sheer face
representation."
Adria Andrews, a doctoral stu
dent in sociology and the president
of the Black Graduate Student Asso
ciation, said a lack of diversity can
hurt students' research, particularly
in the social sciences, which are
often concerned with issues of race,
ethnicity and stratification.
"I have very little opportunity to
discuss race with anyone outside of
my advisor, who was ... hired when
I came in," Andrews said. "It's a

very, very difficult environment be
cause I'm not challenged on my
ideas. My colleagues don't know my
area well enough. And they're afraid
to say something, for fear of offend
ing me, for fear of sounding igno
rant, for fear of being called racist . ''
One factor often blamed for the
lack of ethnic and racial diversity in
the graduate student body is a similar
lack of diversity in the faculty — an
issue the University continues to con
front— but Andrews argued that
while the two issues are indeed closely
linked, it may be necessary to solve the
problem of graduate diversity first.
"We need more faculty of color,"
she said. "Or more faculty at least
who are sensitive to research that di
verse students are doing. There's
only one way to do that. More
Ph.D.s. It's kind of like a circular
process."
Another factor in the lack of
growth in diversity is economic —
students must both foot die bill of a
graduate education and surrender
the income they would make being
in the workforce. This concern is
often more serious for minority and
lower-income students.
"Teachers out there interested in
pursuing more education think that
they can't afford it," said Raquel
Sanchez, a doctoral student in edu
cation whose tuition is being funded
by a fellowship, an option she says is
not sufficiendy publicized "So I
think that there are a lot of people
who don't apply because they don't
realize that there will be a lot of fi
nancial help for them."
Diversity is 'cornerstone'
of recruitment
Although some of the demo
graphics might indicate otherwise,
the University's different schools
have been actively pursuing minor
ity students and trying to increase
diversity.
One University-wide part of this
campaign is Graduate Diversity
Weekend, which occurs in March or
April and will this year be coordinat
ed through Mungal's office.
"It tends to have a good capture
ratio," Mungal said.

Riddle said that representatives
from the biosciences department
have gone recruiting across the
country, including areas like Wash
ington, D.C. and Adanta.
"The goal there is just [to] put
Stanford's name out there and sort
give the impression to undergradu
ates that we really want a diverse
population of students in the gradu
ate programs and that we really
want them here," she said. "We're
not some strange place way off on
the West Coast."
Showell also emphasized that the
issue of diversity is one of the top pri
orities when admitting and recruit
ing students for the Business
School.
"It's one of the cornerstones of
the way we recruit," she said.
Showell pointed to her recruit
ment efforts at professional confer
ences for various minority groups.
She said she also coordinates with
the School of Engineering to recruit
at conferences for minority engi
neers.
Like Showell and Riddle, Eamonn
Callan, the associate dean for acade
mic affairs of the School of Education,
said that his admissions department is
committed to diversity and that diver
sity is one of the criteria weighed
when considering applicants.
However, Callan said the School
of Education could not afford any
substantial recruitment efforts
aimed at increasing diversity due to
its small size.
"We don't have the resources to
do large-scale resource campaigns,"
he said. "Frankly, given the success
we've had in the recent past, [it's]
not necessary."
Minority enrollees to the School
of Education's master's program, for
example, have increased 50 percent
in the last decade, and despite the
fact that minority doctoral applicants
have decreased by about 25 percent,
the number of minority doctoral en
rollees has slightly increased.
University must change emphasis
Just as there is a wide range of
suggested explanations for the
problems with graduate diversity,

there is also a greater range of sug
gestions for improvement.
For Thomas, the most important
change is a shift in the administra
tion's emphasis.
"Graduate student admissions
has to happen at an administrative
level," she said. "The University has
to say, This is important to us,' and
actually do what needs to be done to
make it happen."
"You have to have a culture
where people show up on your cam
pus and they just have this feeling
that, 'Wow, they want me to be
here.' The feeling I get on this cam
pus is that, 'You want to come? Cool.
If you don't want to come, who
cares?"'
Another crucial step in Thomas'
eyes is centralizing the process to
create more cooperation, more
oversight and a greater exchange of
information.
"Each department will have
their own individual things, but
there has got to be some University
presence of a unified voice on what
the commitment is to diversity,"
she said. "If you don't have any
communication between people
who are performing very similar
roles in different departments,
[then] you either have people who
are trying to do stuff but so they're
isolated that they can't make a real
impact, or there's no one even
bothering to look, so no one knows
it's a problem.
Riddle and Thomas both ex
pressed reservations about claims
that the applicant pool is too small
and argued that the University may
not be looking in the right places.
"Not all the best students go to
Harvard, Yale and Princeton," Rid
dle said. "That's the fact of the mat
ter. We need to be casting a much
wider net."
Thomas said that the University
should also be looking at schools
with higher percentages of under
graduate and graduate student mi
norities with strong academic
records, such as Georgia Tech.
"This is not about lowering stan
dards, it's about recruiting where
the people are," she said.
