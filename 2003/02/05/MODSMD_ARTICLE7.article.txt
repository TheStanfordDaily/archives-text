# Students to organize against SUV dealers
## 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seeking to educate faculty and
students on what they consider
vices of sport utility vehicles, a
group of Stanford students is
launching a campaign to raise
awareness of the automobile's
contribution to environmental
and political problems.
The "SUV SOS" campaign —
spearheaded by seniors Jonathan
Neril, an international relations
major, and Josh Bushinsky, an
earth systems major— aims to
"raise awareness about SUV con
sumption in particular and auto
mobile consumption in general
among Stanford students and the
broader community by linking it
to global climate change and
America's dependence on foreign
oil," Neril said.
Neril thought that this issue
was particularly salient to the
Stanford community because a
handful of students own Hum
mers, which he described as one of
the worst "gas guzzlers." Even
more students own other types of

SUVs — infamous for their low
fuel efficiency and high emissions
of greenhouse gases, which have
been shown to contribute to glob
al warming.
"We want to make people
aware that SUV consumption is a
national security issue and a glob
al environment issue, not just a
personal choice," he said.
According to some estimates,
the United States is home to five
percent of the world's population
but produces nearly one-third of
all greenhouse gases. The recent
upsurge in popularity of SUVs
has increased greenhouse gas
emissions, since SUVs emit on av
erage two times as much carbon
dioxide as a regular car.
After the group had its first
meeting on Jan. 29, Bushinsky
said that he has been "amazed" by
the student response and that
group leaders have been ap
proached by members of several
other student groups who are in
terested in working with them on
the project, which he calls an
