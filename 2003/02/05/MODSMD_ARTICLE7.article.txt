# Students to organize against SUV dealers
## 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seeking to educate faculty and
students on what they consider
vices of sport utility vehicles, a
group of Stanford students is
launching a campaign to raise
awareness of the automobile's
contribution to environmental
and political problems.
The "SUV SOS" campaign —
spearheaded by seniors Jonathan
Neril, an international relations
major, and Josh Bushinsky, an
earth systems major— aims to
"raise awareness about SUV con
sumption in particular and auto
mobile consumption in general
among Stanford students and the
broader community by linking it
to global climate change and
America's dependence on foreign
oil," Neril said.
Neril thought that this issue
was particularly salient to the
Stanford community because a
handful of students own Hum
mers, which he described as one of
the worst "gas guzzlers." Even
more students own other types of

SUVs — infamous for their low
fuel efficiency and high emissions
of greenhouse gases, which have
been shown to contribute to glob
al warming.
"We want to make people
aware that SUV consumption is a
national security issue and a glob
al environment issue, not just a
personal choice," he said.
According to some estimates,
the United States is home to five
percent of the world's population
but produces nearly one-third of
all greenhouse gases. The recent
upsurge in popularity of SUVs
has increased greenhouse gas
emissions, since SUVs emit on av
erage two times as much carbon
dioxide as a regular car.
After the group had its first
meeting on Jan. 29, Bushinsky
said that he has been "amazed" by
the student response and that
group leaders have been ap
proached by members of several
other student groups who are in
terested in working with them on
the project, which he calls an


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
"awareness raising campaign."
"The idea is that the technology
to make these cars more efficient is
out there and it's been sitting on the
shelves for decades," Bushinsky
said. "[lnstead of focusing on emis
sions], auto manufacturers have in
creased things like the size of the car
and horsepower as technology has
gotten better, so you've actually
seen a decline in average fuel effi
ciency since the late '80s."
Combining forces with other
local colleges and activists, a group
of Stanford students will descend
upon Burlingame auto mall on
Feb. 14 to protest sport-utility ve
hicles. This demonstration will
start with a rally in White Plaza at
noon and then a bus of about 50
Stanford students will go to the
auto mall, where protesters will
meet other local college and ac
tivist groups, such as Mothers
Against Gas Guzzlers. From there
they will walk down the strip of

about 10 dealerships and try to
garner as much media attention as
possible with speeches, chants and
spoken-word protests.
The group's primary focus so
far has been garnering student at
tention via mass e-mails, and it
plans to post a banner in White
Plaza advertising the rally at the
auto mall.
"One of the goals of our group
is to raise consciousness of this
issue and make gas-guzzling as so
cially unacceptable as smoking in
doors," Neril said.
Bushinsky acknowledged that a
transition to fuel cell or hybrid cars
would be an ultimate goal in the
reduction of greenhouse gas emis
sions. However, since this transi
tion will not likely come for some
years, he said that for now, putting
a stop on the growing trend of dri
ving SUVs is essential.
"We're not out to say everyone
should go around on horseback,"
Bushinsky said. "Really, what
we're trying to do is say that auto
makers should recognize that
there is a demand for fuel-efficient
cars."
