						look at life-like artistic creations of pregnant women
## PLASTER PEOPLE 
### VAUHINI VARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Standing in the doorway of Alex Marshall's
Palo Alto apartment is unsettling. Everywhere,
there are body parts.
On the little red armchair rests the plaster
torso of Asha, a feisty Polish woman. Asha is
tiny, and she'll tell anyone who asks: she adores
her breasts.
A nail fixes Cybilene to the adjacent wall
from her neck to her belly button. She hangs
over the television and stereo speakers. On a
low shelf near the doorway, three heads are
mounted precariously on uneven clay pillars.
This is Marshall's home. It is also his studio,
his office and his art gallery. It doesn't need to
be large; he is unmarried and without kids, and
he has left his eight siblings in his native Ireland
(though he has brought the jovial, growling
brogue with him). Here, in this small one-bed
room apartment, Marshall lives alone.
But it's hard to be lonely here, with all these
people around.
There's Kathy Chroust, for example, re
clined luxuriously against the arm of the couch.
The plaster mold of Chroust's distended belly
and breasts rests on a plastic bag to protect the
sofa from the dust that flakes from its edges.
The cast is frighteningly accurate; it captures
every curve on the front of her body — the way
her breasts curve to the side, the raised goose
bumps around her nipples, the enormous belly
that makes everything around it seem trivial.
Chroust has a brown mole between her breasts;
on her replica, it is a raised, plaster-colored cir
cle, the shape of a tiny pearl.
Marshall's art, lifecasting, is relatively un
known compared to other forms of art — there
are only 255 members of the Association for
Lifecasters International, the largest group of
people who do similar work.
His specialty, pregnancy casting, is even
rarer. New clients often confuse his work with
belly masks, a somewhat more conventional art
form in which the final product is the mask of
dried plaster from the front of the woman's
body. In pregnancy casting, the plaster shell is
used as a negative for the art piece. Once it is
plied from the subject, Marshall pours a thick
plaster into its curves and crevices to create a
detailed replica of the body.
A stranger's hands
Marshall doesn't notice the mole when
Chroust first enters his studio with her hus
band, Matt, on a Sunday afternoon. His first
challenge is to make her feel comfortable, so he
puts on a CD of pop songs from the '70s, turns
up the heat and chats with both of them.
Then, quite matter-of-factly, he asks her to
undress.
By the time Chroust is half-naked, covered
in a veil of plastic, Marshall is bent over a white
bucket, testing a mixture of gluey, blue paste
called alginate. Then, looking up, he asks, "Are
you OK?" When she nods, he begins his work,
gently slapping the paste onto her skin to cap
ture its details, its exact relief.
The child inside Chroust's belly is due in a
month. The pregnancy casting was Matt's idea.
"I had seen something similar in a pregnan
cy magazine, but I didn't really want to do it,"

she said. "I didn't, you know, want my tummy
hanging out like that. But my husband kept re
minding me. I was hoping he would forget
about it. . . But then I thought, we're going to
do it now or never."
Since becoming pregnant, Chroust has
avoided exposing her body. Now, she braces
her bare back against the kitchen table, consid
ering the oddness of a stranger's hands on her
skin as Marshall presses gauze onto the paste
and applies several thick coats of plaster with a
wooden paintbrush. Soon, hei body begins to
feel as though it is covered in a heavy, protective
armor.
When Chroust's belly is finally coated with its
last layer, Marshall calls Matt to his side. To
gether, they pry gently at the edges of the cast
until it begins to pull away from her skin. When
the entire mask has been plied from her body,
Chroust sees the imprint of her own curves, as
if from the inside of her body. And there, where
her waist meets her chest, is that tiny, almost
unnoticeable mole.
'Oh, God, that's your mother?'
Elizabeth Eilert Grewal, a Menlo Park mar
keting consultant, sees pregnancy casting as a
celebration of life. She commissioned Marshall
fora pregnancy casting just two weeks before
her baby boy was to be delivered.
"Those nine months pass quickly, so to
freeze it in time is special," she said.
Grewal is genuinely puzzled by the notion
that some women wouldn't want to remember
the 30 or 40 extra pounds they gain during
pregnancy. Then again, she grew up in a par

ticularly progressive family.
"My mother got into a hot tub naked when
she was 80 years old, so I come from a family
that is not repressed," she shrugged.
Grewal sometimes considers how people
might react to the pregnancy casting when her
son grows older.
"When his teenage friends come over and
they see it in the wall, they'll think, 'Oh, God,
that's your mother?'" she laughed, as if she's
looking forward to it.
A lucrative art
People sometimes question the vanity of
Marshall's clients. His response: "What's so
wrong with vanity?"
For Marshall, it is part of his livelihood. After
moving to the Bay Area from Ireland, he began
working as a general contractor — fixing hous
es and remodeling decks. But the cost of living
in his one-bedroom Palo Alto apartment soon
became prohibitive. Fora while, he tried to
make money by selling sculptures, but then re
alized that people are far more interested in
their own art than that of other people. Now, he
charges around $200 for each pregnancy cast
ing.
"At first, I thought that lifecasting was cheat
ing, that it wasn't real art," he said. "But then 1
realized: The subject is the art. Instead of being
so ego-driven as an artist, assuming that man
made art is the greatest, I realized that the op
posite is true — that nature makes the greatest
art. I've had people ask, 'Why?' Well, why take
a photograph? It's about capturing memory.
It's magic. It is. It's magic."
