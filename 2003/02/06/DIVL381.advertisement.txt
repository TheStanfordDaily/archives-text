Essays for the Black Silent Majority
by John H. McWhorter
Thursday, February 6, 2003
7pm • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Picking up where the
bestselling Losing the Race
left off, this penetrating and
profound collection of essays
by the controversial thinker
and passionate advocate for
racial enlightenment and
achievement explores what it
means to be black in America
today. Within this context
McWhorter takes the reader on
a guided tour through the race
issues dominant in our
moment: racial profiling,
getting past race, the
reparations movement, black
stereotypes in film and
television, hip-hop, diversity,
affirmative action, the word
nigger, and Cornel West's
resignation from Harvard.
With his fierce intelligence and
fervent eloquence, McWhorter
makes a powerful case for the
advancement of true racial
equality. A timely and impor
tant work about issues that
must be addressed by blacks
and whites alike, Authentically
Black is a book for Americans
of every racial, social, political,
and economic persuasion.
