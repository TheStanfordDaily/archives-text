# Committee to discuss course shopping
## Faculty member raises concerns over current course enrollment system 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Undergraduate Standards and Policy
Committee of the Faculty Senate will soon ad
dress concerns raised in a letter from a faculty
member to University Registrar Roger Printup
about the current course enrollment system at
Stanford, which may lead to changes in the way
students select and enroll in their classes and po
tentially even end course shopping.
As of now, there have been no specific alter
ations proposed by the committee or the Regis
trar's Office.
According to Printup, the letter itself did

not raise any solutions to the problems it criti
cized. Instead, it dealt with "issues about dead
lines and [course] shopping and students
being able to enroll in two classes at the same
time," Printup said.
"It was pretty comprehensive," he added.
Printup noted that, while informal com
plaints from students and faculty about the en
rollment system are fairly regular, a detailed and
thorough letter such as the one he received re
cendy is "very, very rare."
The fact that the issues it raised are being
brought before a Senate committee is "even
rarer," he added.
"It was thoughtful and raised questions diat
should be addressed," Printup said of the letter.
When he brought the criticisms before Com
mittee Chair Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology, Thomas "deemed that the issues be
shared with the committee," Printup said.
The committee, which includes three stu

dents, was scheduled to review the concerns in
the letter during a meeting last week. However,
Printup explained that there was not enough
time during the meeting to bring up the issue.
He said that there is not yet a general consen
sus on whether potential changes should be
looked into further
"Some people want it to be more stringent,
more strict, and some people want it looser,"
Printup said, referring to the enrollment system.
In brief discussions with students on campus,
undergraduates seem united in their desire to
stave off any changes to the system.
Pre-registration, a scheme under which
schedules be decided upon before the quarter
begins, aroused particular concern.
"I think the Stanford system is really good,"
said Michael Frank, a senior majoring in sym
bolic systems. "It gives a lot of freedom to choose
based on changing needs in our
schedules and the freedom to assess
our workload as the quarter goes
on so we don't over-stress ourselves.
"I think that it really emphasizes
that we're student-centered — that
we're a university that's committed
to undergraduate education," he
added.
Tracy Williams, a junior double
majoring in political science and
economics, agreed with Frank.
"You don't know what a class is
like until you see the professor talk
and get a feel for what he's like and
what angle he's going to take on the
topic," she said. "I don't think the
Bulletin can really show what the

class is going to be like."
However, faculty members ex
pressed a less unified sentiment.
"The absence of pre-registration
is difficult for faculty," said Morris
Fiorina, a professor of political sci
ence. "It makes it really difficult for
your course to get off to a good,
smooth start."
Fiorina explained that the size of
a class is always hard to predict and
this uncertainty is accentuated
under the Stanford method of en
rollment. He said that he witnessed
Introduction to American Govern
ment— which usually consists of
less than 150 students—jump to
more than 225 students this year.
He said that a sudden spike such
as this can cause shortages in both
book orders and qualified teaching
assistants.
"There have been times in the

past where we've had to hire mar
ginal people," Fiorina said. "I
would love to have pre-registra
tion."
Other faculty members see the
merits to both sides of the argument
over course shopping.
"Of course, it's a lot less chaotic
if you do pre-registration," said
Steve Kerckhoff, a professor of
mathematics. "[But] I, actually,
am perfectly fine with the current
[system]."
Communication Prof. Frederick
Turner seconded Kerckhoffs
words.
"You can find courses that in
terest you [in the current system],"
he said. "But it can be chaotic fora
professor in a workshop-style
class. It also puts pressure on fac
ulty to create very entertaining
first classes."
