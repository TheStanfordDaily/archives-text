Committee of the Faculty Senate will soon ad
dress concerns raised in a letter from a faculty
member to University Registrar Roger Printup
about the current course enrollment system at

When he brought the criticisms before Com
mittee Chair Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy

the letter during a meeting last week. However,
Printup explained that there was not enough
time during the meeting to bring up the issue.
He said that there is not yet a general consen

"Some people want it to be more stringent,
more strict, and some people want it looser,"
Printup said, referring to the enrollment system.
In brief discussions with students on campus,
undergraduates seem united in their desire to
stave off any changes to the system.
Pre-registration, a scheme under which
schedules be decided upon before the quarter
begins, aroused particular concern.
"I think the Stanford system is really good,"
said Michael Frank, a senior majoring in sym
bolic systems. "It gives a lot of freedom to choose
