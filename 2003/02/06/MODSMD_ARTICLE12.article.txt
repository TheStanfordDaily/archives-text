Online poll test reveals new way to gather opinions
In a joint effort, Communication Department Chair Shanto Iyengar
and Professor James Fishkin of the University of Texas-Austin devel
oped and conducted the first-ever online deliberative poll. A deliberative
poll allows participants the opportunity to explore, through discussion,
the issues before delivering their final responses, in contrast to normal
polls, which do not inform their participants.
The results from the poll, which questioned the willingness of citizens
to have the United States take responsibility for problems in the world,
were released on Jan. 27. The percentage of people who placed priority
on providing food and medical aid to other nations rose from 51 percent
to 67 percent. Those who supported protecting weaker nations against
aggression rose from 56 percent to 68 percent and those who support
ed reducing poverty rose from 50 percent to 60 percent after discussion,
revealing the ability of the deliberative method to inform participants.
The poll was conducted online to explore the possibility of utilizing
the Internet to gather opinions. The results of the online poll matched
those of an in-person poll, validating the online method.
"The question is, how do we get a national town hall meeting going?"
Iyengar said. "As more people get access to the Web, it may be easier and
cheaper to make this happen.
Cardinal Ballet gains rights to perform
Balanchine Ballet
The Cardinal Ballet, Stanford's student-run ballet group, has gained
the rights to perform George Balanchine's "The Four Temperaments"
for their "Urban Nights" recital — running April 5 and 6. Rehearsal on
the piece began last weekend, widi the assistance of a famous ballerina
who worked with Balanchine himself.
"Balanchine is considered the most important ballet choreographer
of the 20th century — he revolutionized ballet," said former Cardinal
Ballet President Diana Movius.
In order to gain permission to perform a Balanchine ballet, the Car
dinal Ballet group had to apply to the Balanchine Trust, which gained
the rights to all of Balanchine's ballets after he passed away 20 years ago.
The rights were obtained during exam week.
"[Gaining permission is] a huge honor — it happens very rarely, and
mostly it was done by professional companies and training conservato
ries, not by liberal arts colleges," Movius said.
Junior Formal to be held in San Francisco on Friday
Over 450 juniors will be donning their suits and dresses for the Junior
Formal tomorrow night. The dance will be held this year from 9:30 p.m.
to 1:30 a.m. in the Carnelian Room, located on the 52nd floor of the
Bank of America building in San Francisco. Four hundred fifty tickets,
at $20 per person, have been sold so far, with 50 to 70 more expected to
sell in the next few days.
"Most students are really excited about it, which is different from
freshman and sophomore years it seems," said Junior Class Co-Presi
dent Mike Scrafford. "It's a really unique spot in the city."
Two buses will leave from campus at 6:30 p.m., so that attendees —
who will be provided with restaurant guides — can eat in the city before
the dance. Three more buses will leave at 8:30 p.m., and all five will re
turn at the end of the dance. The dance was organized primarily by Ju
nior Class Co-Presidents Mikey Lee and Mike Scrafford, as well as ju
niors Shayna Fernandez and Mary Himinkool.
