In yesterday's Daily article about graduate student diversity, the first
name and title of Erica Riddle, a doctoral student in immunology, were
inadvertantly omitted from the story.
In yesterday's front page photo about the ASSU Senate meeting, the
caption incorrectly stated the frequency of the meetings. They are held
every Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Law School.
