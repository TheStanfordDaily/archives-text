## Powell presents U.N. with evidence 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Britain
called the evidence "powerful," and
Spain said the presentation was "com
pelling." France and Germany said they
needed more time to study the evidence.
Secretary of State Colin Powell, ad
dressing the U.N. Security Council yes
terday, presented tape recordings, satel
lite photos and statements from infor
mants that he said constituted "ir
refutable and undeniable" evidence that
Saddam is concealing weapons of mass
destruction.
But the elaborate, 80-minute "sound
and-light" show, as some diplomats re
ferred to it, got mixed reviews from
council members, and it didn't appear to
change many minds.
"The dangers of a military action and
its consequences are plain to see," said
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisch
er, whose country holds the rotating Se
curity Council presidency. "We must

continue to seek a peaceful solution to
this crisis."
France, which has hinted it might
use its veto power to block any new res
olution authorizing force against Iraq,
also maintained its opposition to war
right now.
"The use of force can only be a final re
course," French Foreign Minister Do
minique de Villepin said. "We must
move on to a new stage and further
strengthen the inspections."
Powell won the support of 10 former
communist countries, seven of them get
ting ready to join U.S.-led NATO, In a
joint letter, they offered "to contribute to
an international coalition to enforce its
provisions and the disarmament of Iraq,"
saying they remembered all too well what
it was like to live under a dictatorship.
The majority of the Security Council
members said Iraq must show it is coop
erating and provide inspectors with an

swers to questions Powell raised in his
presentation as soon as possible.
Israeli Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu welcomed Powell's speech,
saying he had "laid bare the true nature
of Saddam Hussein's regime and ... ex
posed the great dangers that emanate
from this regime to the region and to
the world."
Iraqi officials called the presentation a
collection of "stunts" and "special effects"
from "unknown sources" and was aimed
at undermining the work of the U.N.
arms inspectors.
Many in the Arab world reacted to
the speech with skepticism and claimed
that the Bush administration was
preparing fora fight regardless of inter
national opinion.
Others echoed Iraq's claims that
recorded interceptions of conversations
between Iraqi military officers and other
pieces of evidence could have been forged.
