HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP)—A congress
man who heads a homeland security sub
committee said on a radio call-in pro
gram that he agreed with the internment
of Japanese-Americans during World
War 11.
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., made
the remark Tuesday on WKZL-FM when
a caller suggested Arabs in the United
States should be confined. Another con
gressman who was interned as a child
criticized Coble for the comment, as did
advocacy groups.
Coble, chairman of the Judiciary Sub
committee on Crime, Terrorism and
Homeland Security, said he didn't agree
with the caller but did agree with Presi
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, who estab

lished the internment camps.
"We were at war. They (Japanese-
Americans) were an endangered
species," Coble said. "For many of these
Japanese-Americans, it wasn't safe for
them to be on the street."
Like most Arab-Americans today,
Coble said, most Japanese-Americans
during World War II were not America's
enemies.
Still, Coble said, Roosevelt had to con
sider the nation's security.
"Some probably were intent on doing
harm to us," he said, "just as some of
these Arab-Americans are probably in
tent on doing harm to us."
Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., a Japan
ese-American who spent his early child

hood with his family in an internment
camp during World War 11, said he
spoke with Coble yesterday to learn more
about his views.
"I'm disappointed that he really
doesn't understand the impact of what
he said," Honda said. "With his leader
ship position in Congress, that kind of
lack of understanding can lead people
down the wrong path."
The Japanese American Citizens
League asked Coble to apologize and
said he should be removed from his com
mittee chairmanship.
"We are flabbergasted that a man who
supports racial profiling" chairs the sub
committee, said the group's national ex
ecutive director, John Tateishi.
