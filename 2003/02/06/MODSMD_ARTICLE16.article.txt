CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — A
greed-driven plot that reached the top
levels of Tyson Foods used illegal immi
grants smuggled into the country to keep
poultry plants running, a prosecutor said
as the company's federal conspiracy trial
opened yesterday.
Assist. U.S. Attorney John Mac Coon
said secret tape recordings would help
prove the conspiracy started in 1994 after
plant managers had difficulty hiring at
low wages. He said company officials
turned to a pipeline of illegal immigrants
from Mexico and Central America.
"This trial is about corporate greed,"
Mac Coon said. He said illegal workers at

Tyson plants in Shelbyville and Wilkes
boro, N.C., at one point outnumbered le
gitimate employees.
Tyson's attorney, Tom Green, said any
hiring of illegal immigrants was done by a
few plant managers and was not known to
executives at Tyson headquarters.
"No one in senior management
knew," Green said. "No member of senior
management ever violated immigration
laws or encouraged" anyone else to do so.
An indictment accuses Tyson of taking
part in a conspiracy in which illegal work
ers were smuggled to plants in Ten
nessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Indi
ana, Missouri and Arkansas.
