## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Tribute to Columbia crew 
### 
Many of us at Stanford were still
in bed on Saturday morning
when the media began to re
port that the space shuttle
Columbia's return to Earth had gone
awry. The fatal crash, which took the lives
of all seven crew members, dominated
most brunch table discussions. But by the
end of the weekend, life at Stanford
seemed to return back to normal — The
Daily reported on Monday that student re
actions to the incident were lukewarm.
We feel that the community at Stanford
should take a moment to admire and re
spect not only Columbia's mission but also
the men and women who bravely risked
their lives to carry it out. Like the seven
members of Columbia's crew, we at Stan
ford dedicate our lives — or at least four
years — to the quest for knowledge. As
members of an elite research university,
where intellectual and technological ad
vancements are valued, we share more in

common with Rick
Husband, William
McCool, Michael An
derson, Kalpana
Chawla, David
Brown, Laurel Clark
and I lan Ramon than
we think.
Commander Rick
Husband had been to
space before, in 1999
on the space shutde
Discovery. He carried

to space with him a red sweatshirt from
Fresno State, his alma mater. On the day
of the scheduled landing, a friend left a
message on his home phone that said: "We
saw you this morning."
Pilot William McCool, who had degrees
in computer science and aeronautical en
gineering, said he exercised each day in
outer space to keep in shape. He gave an
interview to National Public Radio a week
ago. "I'll tell you, there's nothing better
than listening to a good album and looking
out the window and watching the world go
by while you pedal on the bike," he said.
Payload Commander Michael Ander
son was the only black crew member on
the Columbia and managed the hun
dreds of science experiments in the lab.
He had dreamed of being an astronaut
for most of his life. "It looks like the fu
ture's really bright," Anderson had said

before take-off.
Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, the
first Indian-born woman to travel into
space, has been lauded as a heroine in her
home country. In Chawla's hometown of
Karnal, a gathering on Saturday to cele
brate the successful return of Columbia
turned into a prayer vigil. Chawla earned
her masters degree at the University of
Texas and her doctorate at the University
of Colorado. She joined NASA in 1995 as
an astronaut candidate.
Mission Specialist David Brown, a col
lege gymnast and one-time circus per
former, joined NASA in 1996 after serv
ing as a captain and surgeon in the U.S.
Navy. Brown received his medical train
ing at Eastern Virginia Medical School
and the Medical University of South Car
olina. In an e-mail to his mother that he
wrote while in space, Brown said, "The
views of the Earth are really beautiful. If
you've ever seen a space IMAX movie,

that's really what it
looks like."
Mission Specialist
Laurel Clark was a
medical doctor and a
commander in the
U.S. Navy before
joining NASA in
1996. In an tele
phone interview with
a reporter from the
Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel, Clark said

from space, "This has been a great experi
ence for me. It's just an incredibly magical
place." She earned a zoology degree and a
medical degree from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
Payload Specialist I lan Ramon, the first
Israeli astronaut, carried onboard a draw
ing made by a 14-year-old boy who died in
a concentration camp. The picture
showed Earth as he imagined it would be
seen from space. "Being able to conduct a
press conference from space as the first Is
raeli astronaut, looking at the U.S. and Is
raeli flags behind us, I think it's a big 'oh
wow' for Israel and a big start for future
scientific collaborations internationally,"
Ramon said.
We pay tribute to these courageous men
and women who lost their lives in the pur
suit of technological progress. Their ex
amples in life are models for all of us.
