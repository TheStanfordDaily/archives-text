# THE 						MINISTRY OF TRUTH
## McDonald's and Civil Society 
### 
Hanging on my wall is a
December 2000 head
line from The Onion, a
parody newspaper, an
nouncing, "Hershey's Ordered To
Pay Obese Americans $ 135 Billion."
Unlike other Onion stories like
"Women: Why Don't They Lose
Some Weight?" and "Columbine
Jocks Safely Resume Bullying," die
fake class action against "Big Choco
late" has always seemed too plausi
ble to be a joke.
Sure enough, a New York attor
ney has filed a class action suit against
McDonald's on behalf of a group of
obese teenagers, claiming that the
fast food giant "negligently, reckless
ly, carelessly and/or intentionally"
markets food "high in fat, sugar, and
cholesterol" to children. While the
suit has been the object of ridicule
and parody, it has begged the ques
tion—as posed on the cover of For
tune —"Is Fat the Next Tobacco?"
I will set aside the more impor
tant question for now (To what de
gree should people be held respon
sible for their own choices?) in order
to say something in defense of the
Golden Arches.
McDonald's, along with the
snack food and soda industries, has
long been the bugbear of health and
fitness advocates. The McNugget,
that frightening conglomeration of
poultry detritus, has become a men
acing symbol for over-processed
"food." (Witness its derision by Sat
urday Night Live and RFC com
mercials.) The fast food chain has
even introduced a prefix, "Mc-" to
our lexicon, connoting both over
commercialization and a kind of un
holy synthesis of disparate elements.
To McDonald's credit, it has
made changes. Prior to 1990, the
chain's french fries were made in a
mixture of 7 percent cottonseed oil
and 93 percent beef tallow and, con
sequently, had more saturated beef
fat per ounce than their cheese
burger. McDonald's responded to
criticism of the fries' cholesterol con
tent by switching to 100 percent
vegetable oil.
That same year, McDonald's dis
continued the use of Styrofoam
packaging under pressure from en
vironmentalists and voluntary asso
ciations such as the "McToxins
Campaign." Last year the company
reduced transfatty acids in its fried
foods and added several healthier
items (frozen yogurt, chicken pitas)
to its menu. All of these changes
were made without the intrusion of
government and class action suits.
And now that the company has
posted its first quarterly loss in histo
ry, they will likely be redoubling
their efforts at reinvention.
The power of civil society — or in
this case, the power of shame — has
been at die vanguard not only of Mc-

Donald's reforms but also of cam
paigns against smoking and SUVs.
"The Truth" ad campaign has
saddled smokers with the guilt of
involuntary manslaughter and all
but equated tobacco executives
with Satan.
Bill O'Reilly, host of the hugely
popular Fox News Channel show
"The O'Reilly Factor," regularly
lambastes SUV manufacturers and

owners for their al
leged contribution
to global war ming.
(O'Reilly, a nomi
nal Independent,
takes a moderate
right position on
nearly every other
social and political
issue.)

Even Rush Limbaugh, radio talk
show host and avatar of conser
vatism, has succumbed to the envi
ronmentalists. While he has owned
an SUV for seven years, he vows
never to drive one again, citing the
insurmountable stigma attached to
the vehicles.
That O'Reilly and Limbaugh
have acquiesced to (or in the case of
O'Reilly, joined) the anti-SUV
camp is a testament to the power of
social pressure.
The proliferation of competitive
and diverse mass media has expand
ed the debate on social issues. Inter
net "watchdogs" and neo-muckrak
ers like Matt Drudge patrol both
ends of the ideological spectrum.
The emergence of the Fox News
Channel and the publication of
Bernard Goldberg's whistle-blow
ing book "Bias" have initiated a na
tional dialogue on the quality of net
work news.
Indeed, several cable news chan
nels have in recent months ques
tioned the source, the reliability and
the political motivations behind
rival channels' stories. This horizon
tal accountability (lacking in net
work news for much of television's

history) will promote the same type
of competition that is essential to lib
eral democracy.
The emphasis on voluntary asso
ciation within civil society has been
one of the essential tenets of Ameri
can democracy. The limitation that
the Founding Fathers placed on
the federal government has incul
cated a participatory civic culture.
As Alexis DeTocqueville observed
over 160 years ago, "In no country
in the world has the principle of as
sociation been more successfully
used, or more unsparingly applied
to a multitude of different objects,
than in America."
Unfortunately, the vestiges of the
Progressive Era, FDR's New Deal
and LBJ's Great Society have ob
scured this legacy of civic culture.
These programs, by deferring social
problems to an elite corps of social
scientists, lawyers and theoreticians,
contributed to the deterioration of
voluntary civic participation.
Participation in civic associa
tions bears one massively impor
tant but underrated feature: voli
tion. When individuals, by their
own free will, choose to form an as
sociation, endow a foundation or
pursue change, they achieve a
level of moral satisfaction that co
erced redistribution of resources
could never supply. Furthermore,
these associations often cut across
ideology and partisan doctrine,
liberalizing and depolarizing our
political culture.
To quote Woodrow Wilson
(maybe the Democrats will like this
one), "What are we if we are to be
taken care of by a small number of
gendemen who are the only men
who understand the job? Because if
we don't understand the job, then
we are not free people."
