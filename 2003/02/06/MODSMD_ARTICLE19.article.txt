SCPJ argues against Hoover Institution's
'overt political goal'
In "Virtuous Silence," columnists Alex
Greninger and Tim Meyer characterize
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice's discussion of the Hoover Institu
tion as follows: "a series of letters .. . sug
gested that the Hoover Institute be re
formed because it has right-wing leanings.
The word 'bias' was thrown in to suggest
that because the Hoover Institute is a con
servative institution, there is something
wrong with how people receive appoint
ments to the Institute. Is there, then, by
the same logic, something wrong with how
professors at large are appointed at Stan
ford, as most seem to be liberal?"
This is a mischaracterization of the ar
guments presented. We do not claim that
the Hoover Institution is biased because it
contains a large number of conservative
fellows; rather, we claim that the institu
tion is biased because its mission statement
contains an overt political goal. This mis
sion statement is used to guide both the
hiring of fellows (although it is not, of
course, the only factor in hiring) and the
institution's sponsored research initia
tives. The political character of Hoover
Fellows is thus a reflection of the underly
ing problem of the institution and not
"proof' of an underlying problem.
This being the case, there indeed is

"something wrong with how people re
ceive appointments to the Institute." The
consideration of non-academic factors in
the appointment process is a violation of
academic freedom as defined by the Re
search Policy Handbook.

I-Center continues to support
international students
There have been a number of recent
articles in The Daily concerning the ef
fects of federal immigration policies on in
ternational students at Stanford. I have
appreciated the concern shown by The
Daily and the continuing coverage of
these important issues. An editorial on
Jan. 21 ("University should oppose INS
registration process") called on the Uni
versity to take a public stand against the
National Security Entry Exit Registration
System (NSEERS), which requires citizens
from selected countries to report, on an
annual basis, to the Immigration and Nat
uralization Service. Reports from the first
round of registration in December raised
many questions about the process — so
much so that numerous organizations
and members of Congress, spoke out

against the excessive behavior of federal
officials during this first registration peri
od. Subsequently, the INS has taken steps
to ameliorate some of the more problem
atic aspects of registration. These steps,
however, do not include reducing the
time students will spend in line at local
immigration offices or any postponement
or cancellation ofNSEERS (even though
there is some Congressional support for
this).
I share the concerns expressed by The
Daily of the potential for long-term, nega
tive effects of such procedures on students
from the affected countries — students
who contribute significantly to Stanford
and to the United States. Should these stu
dents, in the future, decide not to study in
America, we would be that much poorer as
a community.
The Bechtel International Center has
been monitoring, as best it can, what hap
pens to our students when they are re
quired to participate in such programs as
NSEERS. Although we know of no Stan
ford student who has been detained, this
does not mean we view the issue lightly.
Stanford, and other institutions of higher
education, do provide feedback to federal
agencies and Congress, through member
ship in national associations and relation
ships with individual members of
Congress. Whatever we may feel personal
ly about recent policies, it is the Universi
ty's view that making our concerns known
through these means can be effective. As
University President John Hennessy has
said, the balance between national securi

ty and the welcome we wish to provide to
students from overseas is currently a deli
cate one.
Certainly the University will ensure
that any unwarranted treatment of inter
national students or scholars will be op
posed and brought to the attention of ap
propriate offices. I will keep the Presi
dent's Office informed of such situations
and continue to work with our profession
al colleagues around the country to pro
vide input and advice to the INS.

Nothing foolish about space travel
In his letter to editor on Tuesday,
Emeritus Prof. Ronald Hilton called the
Columbia Shuttle tragedy "the result of ar
rogance resulting from excessive pride."
Furthermore, he described the astronauts'
work as "foolish and expensive expres
sions of man's pride."
In spite of the accident, Columbia's
crew was able to record a wealth of scien
tific data that will provide valuable clues
with regard to fighting prostate cancer,
developing cleaner burning engines,
fighting fires on earth and modeling glob
al climate change.
There is nothing foolish or arrogant
about seven brave men and women know
ingly risking their lives for the sake of tan
gibly benefiting the whole of humanity.
Hilton's comments to the contrary are an

insult to their lives' work.
Also, Hilton made the statement that
"Scientific experiments can be carried out
in unmanned spacecraft." As a contracting
engineer who works at NASA's astrobiolo
gy branch, I can say that the vast majority
of today's experiments cannot just be car
ried out autonomously as he claims. Per
haps this professor should pursue a de
gree in science or engineering before com
menting further on this particular point.

Nothing foolish about space travel
In his letter to editor on Tuesday,
Emeritus Prof. Ronald Hilton called the
Columbia Shuttle tragedy "the result of ar
rogance resulting from excessive pride."
Furthermore, he described the astronauts'
work as "foolish and expensive expres
sions of man's pride."
In spite of the accident, Columbia's
crew was able to record a wealth of scien
tific data that will provide valuable clues
with regard to fighting prostate cancer,
developing cleaner burning engines,
fighting fires on earth and modeling glob
al climate change.
There is nothing foolish or arrogant
about seven brave men and women know
ingly risking their lives for the sake of tan
gibly benefiting the whole of humanity.
Hilton's comments to the contrary are an

insult to their lives' work.
Also, Hilton made the statement that
"Scientific experiments can be carried out
in unmanned spacecraft." As a contracting
engineer who works at NASA's astrobiolo
gy branch, I can say that the vast majority
of today's experiments cannot just be car
ried out autonomously as he claims. Per
haps this professor should pursue a de
gree in science or engineering before com
menting further on this particular point.

SCPJ argues against Hoover Institution's
'overt political goal'
In "Virtuous Silence," columnists Alex
Greninger and Tim Meyer characterize
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice's discussion of the Hoover Institu
tion as follows: "a series of letters .. . sug
gested that the Hoover Institute be re
formed because it has right-wing leanings.
The word 'bias' was thrown in to suggest
that because the Hoover Institute is a con
servative institution, there is something
wrong with how people receive appoint
ments to the Institute. Is there, then, by
the same logic, something wrong with how
professors at large are appointed at Stan
ford, as most seem to be liberal?"
This is a mischaracterization of the ar
guments presented. We do not claim that
the Hoover Institution is biased because it
contains a large number of conservative
fellows; rather, we claim that the institu
tion is biased because its mission statement
contains an overt political goal. This mis
sion statement is used to guide both the
hiring of fellows (although it is not, of
course, the only factor in hiring) and the
institution's sponsored research initia
tives. The political character of Hoover
Fellows is thus a reflection of the underly
ing problem of the institution and not
"proof' of an underlying problem.
This being the case, there indeed is

"something wrong with how people re
ceive appointments to the Institute." The
consideration of non-academic factors in
the appointment process is a violation of
academic freedom as defined by the Re
search Policy Handbook.

I-Center continues to support
international students
There have been a number of recent
articles in The Daily concerning the ef
fects of federal immigration policies on in
ternational students at Stanford. I have
appreciated the concern shown by The
Daily and the continuing coverage of
these important issues. An editorial on
Jan. 21 ("University should oppose INS
registration process") called on the Uni
versity to take a public stand against the
National Security Entry Exit Registration
System (NSEERS), which requires citizens
from selected countries to report, on an
annual basis, to the Immigration and Nat
uralization Service. Reports from the first
round of registration in December raised
many questions about the process — so
much so that numerous organizations
and members of Congress, spoke out

against the excessive behavior of federal
officials during this first registration peri
od. Subsequently, the INS has taken steps
to ameliorate some of the more problem
atic aspects of registration. These steps,
however, do not include reducing the
time students will spend in line at local
immigration offices or any postponement
or cancellation ofNSEERS (even though
there is some Congressional support for
this).
I share the concerns expressed by The
Daily of the potential for long-term, nega
tive effects of such procedures on students
from the affected countries — students
who contribute significantly to Stanford
and to the United States. Should these stu
dents, in the future, decide not to study in
America, we would be that much poorer as
a community.
The Bechtel International Center has
been monitoring, as best it can, what hap
pens to our students when they are re
quired to participate in such programs as
NSEERS. Although we know of no Stan
ford student who has been detained, this
does not mean we view the issue lightly.
Stanford, and other institutions of higher
education, do provide feedback to federal
agencies and Congress, through member
ship in national associations and relation
ships with individual members of
Congress. Whatever we may feel personal
ly about recent policies, it is the Universi
ty's view that making our concerns known
through these means can be effective. As
University President John Hennessy has
said, the balance between national securi

ty and the welcome we wish to provide to
students from overseas is currently a deli
cate one.
Certainly the University will ensure
that any unwarranted treatment of inter
national students or scholars will be op
posed and brought to the attention of ap
propriate offices. I will keep the Presi
dent's Office informed of such situations
and continue to work with our profession
al colleagues around the country to pro
vide input and advice to the INS.
