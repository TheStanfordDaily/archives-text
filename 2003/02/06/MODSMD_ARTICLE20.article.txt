# Cardinal Today
## New ranking adds pressure to roadtrip 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
What's most difficult about No. 25 Stan
ford's matchup tonight in Eugene against
a no-longer-ranked and still-struggling
Oregon team may, ironically, be the fact
that the Ducks have fallen out of the top-25
and haven't been able to match their dom
inance of last season. It's a Catch-22, of

sorts.
But the Cardinal (16-5, 7-2 Pacific-10
Conference), now 4-0 against ranked op
ponents, appears to live for the big game,
the last-second shots and the shock-the
world-type victories. It seems that so much
of Stanford's ability to play well is wrapped
up in the Cardinal's opinion of its oppo
nent.
The questions remain then: In Stan
ford's eyes, how threatening of an oppo
nent is Oregon (15-5, 5-4) right now? And
how about Sunday's matchup against Ore
gon State? How truly capable are the
Beavers?
In the case of these two teams, the past
may be the Cardinal's nemesis as far as
mindset goes.
Aside from the two-game sweep this
past weekend in Arizona, the two victories
over the Oregon schools four weeks ago
might be Stanford's most impressive suc
cessive performances to date. In combina
tion, the final 12 minutes of the Cardinal's
15-point come-from-behind victory over
Oregon State, and the 40 minutes of total
domination over then-no. 12 Oregon ac
count for Stanford's most successful 52
minutes of play and are emblematic, al
most, of larger mentality-related themes.
The game against the Beavers proved
that the Cardinal could overcome any ob
stacle — that it could find a way to win even
on a bad shooting night. In addition, the
victory over the Ducks showed that Stan
ford could be a domineering force when
all cylinders were clicking.
However, the last time that Stanford
and Oregon met at Maples Pavilion, the
scenario was completely different. The
Cardinal was coming off a tough winter
break, which saw the demise of its top-25
national ranking, a few bad injuries, a de
moralizing loss at California to open Pac
-10 play and a not-so-hot opening 28 min

utes against Oregon State.
But with 12 minutes left to play against
the Beavers the underdog mentality
kicked in, fueling a comeback and two
home wins. Needless to say, Stanford
doesn't have the luxury of the underdog
anymore.
"I'd like to keep the pressure off of us as
much as I can," said head coach Mike

Montgomery after Saturday's victory over
Arizona State. "We talked about it a little
bit [after the win at Arizona,] that we'd be a
game out of first — [that] the target is
going to come back on us because we're
challenging fora potential championship
and you've got to be ready to handle that."

Junior Justin Davis and his Stanford teammates will face Oregon tonight with a national rank
ing but without the luxury of being an underdog.
If adversity is what Stanford
needs to be successful, Mac Arthur
Court will provide one of the
toughest settings that the Cardinal
has played in all season. Whether it
will be a source of motivation for
Stanford remains to be seen. Until
the Duck's loss to Arizona five
weeks ago, Oregon had maintained
a 23-game home winning streak
dating back to Feb. 24, 2001.
"I'm really looking forward to
playing [at Mac Arthur Court]," ju
nior forward Justin Davis said. "I
know that it's going to be a hostile
crowd, similar to Arizona, which is
part of the fun of playing big time
college basketball. I think we're all
looking forward to the opportunity
to play in that kind of environment."
The Ducks are coming off a loss
as they get ready for battle against
Stanford, meaning Oregon will be
struggling to regain its footing.
"The game [tonight] is a really
big game for us," said sophomore
swingman Josh Childress. "We
beat Oregon last time at home and
to be able to go over there and
come out with a victory would be
really good for our confidence."
Stanford's Sunday matchup
against Oregon State should be
equally entertaining. The Beavers
are on a four-game winning streak
that they are hoping to extend this
weekend. The front court tandem
of senior forwards Brian Jackson
and Philip Ricci are averaging 30
points and 14 boards a game com

bined, which could prove trouble
some fora Stanford front court
that has shown a tendency to fall
into early foul trouble.
Despite his team's recent suc
cess, Montgomery is cautious in
preparing for Oregon He's very

wary about a possible shift in his
team's mentality because of the
new national ranking and the re
newed confidence gained as a re
sult of the Cardinal's successful
Arizona road trip.
"Now all of the sudden we're

ranked 25th," Montgomery said.
"It almost seems like it changes the
landscape, changes your mindset a
little bit [...] and that's not good."
Stanford will face Oregon
tonight at 5:30 p.m. and Oregon
State on Sunday afternoon 12:30
