# Cardinal Today
## New ranking adds pressure to roadtrip 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
What's most difficult about No. 25 Stan
ford's matchup tonight in Eugene against
a no-longer-ranked and still-struggling
Oregon team may, ironically, be the fact
that the Ducks have fallen out of the top-25
and haven't been able to match their dom
inance of last season. It's a Catch-22, of

sorts.
But the Cardinal (16-5, 7-2 Pacific-10
Conference), now 4-0 against ranked op
ponents, appears to live for the big game,
the last-second shots and the shock-the
world-type victories. It seems that so much
of Stanford's ability to play well is wrapped
up in the Cardinal's opinion of its oppo
nent.
The questions remain then: In Stan
ford's eyes, how threatening of an oppo
nent is Oregon (15-5, 5-4) right now? And
how about Sunday's matchup against Ore
gon State? How truly capable are the
Beavers?
In the case of these two teams, the past
may be the Cardinal's nemesis as far as
mindset goes.
Aside from the two-game sweep this
past weekend in Arizona, the two victories
over the Oregon schools four weeks ago
might be Stanford's most impressive suc
cessive performances to date. In combina
tion, the final 12 minutes of the Cardinal's
15-point come-from-behind victory over
Oregon State, and the 40 minutes of total
domination over then-no. 12 Oregon ac
count for Stanford's most successful 52
minutes of play and are emblematic, al
most, of larger mentality-related themes.
The game against the Beavers proved
that the Cardinal could overcome any ob
stacle — that it could find a way to win even
on a bad shooting night. In addition, the
victory over the Ducks showed that Stan
ford could be a domineering force when
all cylinders were clicking.
However, the last time that Stanford
and Oregon met at Maples Pavilion, the
scenario was completely different. The
Cardinal was coming off a tough winter
break, which saw the demise of its top-25
national ranking, a few bad injuries, a de
moralizing loss at California to open Pac
-10 play and a not-so-hot opening 28 min

utes against Oregon State.
But with 12 minutes left to play against
the Beavers the underdog mentality
kicked in, fueling a comeback and two
home wins. Needless to say, Stanford
doesn't have the luxury of the underdog
anymore.
"I'd like to keep the pressure off of us as
much as I can," said head coach Mike

Montgomery after Saturday's victory over
Arizona State. "We talked about it a little
bit [after the win at Arizona,] that we'd be a
game out of first — [that] the target is
going to come back on us because we're
challenging fora potential championship
and you've got to be ready to handle that."

Junior Justin Davis and his Stanford teammates will face Oregon tonight with a national rank
ing but without the luxury of being an underdog.
