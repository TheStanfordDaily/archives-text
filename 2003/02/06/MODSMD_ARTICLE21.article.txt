# Robinson Steps Up in the Nick of Time
## Sophomore forward seems to be at his best against Stanford's toughest foes 
### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If someone were to say in Novem
ber that the Stanford men's basket
hall team would be second in the Pa
cific-10 Conference with a 16-5
record, they probably would have
been met with some doubtful stares.
And, if they were to say the Cardi
nal accomplished this incredibly
strong record with redshirt sopho
more Nick Robinson in the starting
lineup for all but one conference
game, they would have just about
been tossed in the loony bin.
Needless to say, coach Mike Mont
gomery's squad, and especially
Robinson, have shown that there is
much more to basketball success
than a star-studded roster.
Robinson isn't the type of player
that gets much mention in the stat
sheet. Despite averaging 23 minutes
per game, he has only reached dou
ble figures in points three times and
averages under five points per game.
While he has picked up his produc
tion on the boards, he still only grabs
4.6 rebounds per game. In addition,
assists, 3-pointers and blocks aren't
really his forte.
However, no one who has
watched the Cardinal since the start
of the conference season could fail to
notice the invaluable contributions
of the 6-foot-6 forward. If hustle was
a category, he might very well lead
the team. For grabbing loose balls,
playing tight defense and preventing
unforced errors, Robinson is your
man. One need only look to Stan
ford's 7-1 record with him in the
starting lineup to begin to quantify
his contributions.
"I think my energy is really im
portant," Robinson said. "Defensive

ly I can contribute and rebound. I
will do whatever ever I can to give us
the chance to win big games."
Robinson was thrust into the
starting lineup after junior Justin
Davis injured his knee in the confer
ence opening loss to California. After
sophomore Chris Hernandez rein
jured his foot and junior Teyo John
son declared himself eligible for the
NFL draft, Montgomery was forced
to go with Robinson, who had played
in just three Pac-10 games in his first
year on the Farm.
"It's been a good opportunity for
me and I am thankful that I have
been able to get this far," Robinson
said. "A lot of hard work has been put
in to make it. It is unfortunate that
Justin had to go down, and since the
beginning of the season he has been
immensely valuable. I am just thank
ful about getting to perform."
However, not only has Robinson
been a consistent sparkplug for the
Stanford men, he has established an
ability to step up in big games.
Against then-No. 10 Oregon, Robin
son tallied his first career double
double, recording 13 points and 11
rebounds in Stanford's surprising
81-57 rout.
This past Thursday, Robinson
again responded to a ranked chal
lenger, posting 10 points and nine
rebounds in the Cardinal's upset of
top-ranked Arizona.
His intensity and work ethic are
hardly the only things that set Robin
son apart from other players on the
NCAA courts. Coming to Stanford
after completing a two-year Mormon
mission to Maceio, Brazil, he is the
oldest player on the team at 23. His
campus social life centers around his
wife Meagan rather than the local
fraternity parties.
"I really enjoy spending time with
my wife, and we have been able to
make good friends on campus,"
Robinson said. "But I am not on cam-
pus per se, and my life is a little
bit different than some of my
teammates' [lives]."
"The mission helped me
learn more about life in gener
al,"he added. "It helped me re
alize what other people go
through who don't have the
luxuries that we have. I was
able to learn from those I came
in contact with more about
teamwork and leadership,
about setting goals and working
hard."
But while Robinson has
taken a slightly different path
into the Cardinal starting line
up, he is not immune to the
dreams that come from play
ing Division I college basket
ball at one of the country's top
programs.
"I would love to continue to
play basketball, and I am defi
nitely going to give it a shot,"
Robinson said. "I am going to
try and make it the next level. It
has been a dream of mine since I
was kid."
For now though, Robinson is
focused on the task ahead in a
tough game against Oregon this
weekend at Mac Arthur Court.
"We have to come out and
play like we did against them
[Oregon] the first time or play
like we did against Arizona,"
Robinson said. "We have to try
to minimize their production
and give ourselves a chance to
win."
