Stanford women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer offered up
a helping of coachspeak in evaluat
ing her team's recent up-and-down
offensive performances.
"We need to improve our offen
sive execution," she said.

vs. Oregon, today, 7 p.m.
vs. Oregon State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Translation: Get someone not
named Nicole Powell scoring consis
tently.
The No. 6 Cardinal (17-2,9-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will try to do
that and more as it hosts the Oregon

schools this weekend. Stanford faces
Oregon (8-12, 4-7) Thursday at 7
p.m. and Oregon State (12-8.6-5) in
a Saturday afternoon affair begin
ning at 2 p.m.
Recently, there's been a danger
ous trend developing for the team
from the Farm: Stanford has begun
to lean too heavily on its All-Ameri
can forward to shoulder the scoring

load — and the much-talked about
Cardinal offensive balance has
seemed to curiously disappear.
Not even VanDerveer has a
plausible explanation.
"To me, it's inexplicable," she
said.
Stanford relied on Powell to
carry it down the stretch in games in
January against Oregon, Washing
ton and UCLA — which wasn't any
thing out of the ordinary when you
consider her talent level. The re
liance became a problem when the
other contributions started to wane.
When the buzzer sounded at the
Cardinal's first conference loss, a 75-
72 decision at Southern California,
Powell's stat line was testimony to
her usual dominant performance.
She poured in 34 points and grab
bing 15 rebounds — but Chelsea
Trotter (10 points) was the only
other Cardinal player to score in
double figures.
It seemed like the problem was
rectified against Cal last Wednes
day, when three players scored in
double digits, and Powell had only
nine points while doing a better job
of gett ing others involved.
But Saturday's narrow win in a
rematch with Cal saw Powell score
19, and for the first time all season
no other Cardinal player reached
double-digits in scoring.
VanDerveer wants those kinds of
numbers to change.
"There are some basic flaws with
some of the things that we've been
doing," she said. "I feel like we've
had a psychological letdown.
"People played fearlessly without
Nicole in the lineup. But when she
came back, people just said 'She can
do it for us.' We need to get away
from that."
Case in point: Sophomores Kel
ley Suminski and Azella Perryman
were one-two in scoring for the
Cardinal before Powell returned
