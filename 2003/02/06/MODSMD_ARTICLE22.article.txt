Stanford women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer offered up
a helping of coachspeak in evaluat
ing her team's recent up-and-down
offensive performances.
"We need to improve our offen
sive execution," she said.

vs. Oregon, today, 7 p.m.
vs. Oregon State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Translation: Get someone not
named Nicole Powell scoring consis
tently.
The No. 6 Cardinal (17-2,9-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will try to do
that and more as it hosts the Oregon

schools this weekend. Stanford faces
Oregon (8-12, 4-7) Thursday at 7
p.m. and Oregon State (12-8.6-5) in
a Saturday afternoon affair begin
ning at 2 p.m.
Recently, there's been a danger
ous trend developing for the team
from the Farm: Stanford has begun
to lean too heavily on its All-Ameri
can forward to shoulder the scoring

load — and the much-talked about
Cardinal offensive balance has
seemed to curiously disappear.
Not even VanDerveer has a
plausible explanation.
"To me, it's inexplicable," she
said.
Stanford relied on Powell to
carry it down the stretch in games in
January against Oregon, Washing
ton and UCLA — which wasn't any
thing out of the ordinary when you
consider her talent level. The re
liance became a problem when the
other contributions started to wane.
When the buzzer sounded at the
Cardinal's first conference loss, a 75-
72 decision at Southern California,
Powell's stat line was testimony to
her usual dominant performance.
She poured in 34 points and grab
bing 15 rebounds — but Chelsea
Trotter (10 points) was the only
other Cardinal player to score in
double figures.
It seemed like the problem was
rectified against Cal last Wednes
day, when three players scored in
double digits, and Powell had only
nine points while doing a better job
of gett ing others involved.
But Saturday's narrow win in a
rematch with Cal saw Powell score
19, and for the first time all season
no other Cardinal player reached
double-digits in scoring.
VanDerveer wants those kinds of
numbers to change.
"There are some basic flaws with
some of the things that we've been
doing," she said. "I feel like we've
had a psychological letdown.
"People played fearlessly without
Nicole in the lineup. But when she
came back, people just said 'She can
do it for us.' We need to get away
from that."
Case in point: Sophomores Kel
ley Suminski and Azella Perryman
were one-two in scoring for the
Cardinal before Powell returned

Oregon State.
from her bulging disc injury in
early January.
In the last five games, however,
Suminski has averaged 7.4 points
per game and Perryman 5.4. (It
should be noted that Perryman's
numbers are somewhat skewed
since she's lost playing time to
Trotter.)
So how does Stanford go about
fixing a problem that doesn't seem
to have a clear cause?
"We need to make some techni
cal adjustments to our offense,"
VanDerveer said. "I want us to ran
more and we have to be a better
passing team."
The problem may have emerged
from the uncertainty of Powell's sit
uation in the first few months of the
season. The Cardinal had to plan to
play without her and, until now,
didn't think about how she'd blend
into the chemistry of this year's
young squad.
"We are trying to see how Nicole
fits in with everyone," VanDerveer
said. "We do have a plan to use her:
take advantage of her versatility and
talent."
And it was at Oregon on Jan. 11
when all of Stanford remembered
how special Powell can be. The Car
dinal, after having led by as many as
15 points in the second half, found
itself trailing 74-73 after a pair of
free throws by Ducks forward Car
olyn Ganes with 3.3 seconds left.
So all t he Cardinal had to do was
pull off its version of the Mail Mar)'
to seal the victory .
TNae Thiel launched a 75-foot

pass downcourt to a streaking Pow
ell, who caught the ball behind Ducks
defender Kedzie Gunderson and
was tackled en route to the hoop.
Powell then made both ends of a 1-
and-1 to give the Cardinal an im
probable 75-74 victory at rambunc
tious Mac Arthur Court in Eugene.
"That was a huge play for our
team," VanDerveer said. "That in
some ways reminded Nicole who
she really was."
Of course, Stanford gets to face
the Ducks at Maples Pavilion this
time, so a repeat performance out of
Bev Smith's squad, which plays
poorly away from home, isn't as
likely.
"They play with a lot more confi
dence at home," VanDerveer said.
Then again, there hasn't been a
whole lot for die sub-.500 Ducks to
be confident about. They've en
dured a bevy of turmoil; from
Shaquala Williams' dismissal to
Catherine Kraayeveld's mysterious
staph infection, Oregon has been
hard-pressed to live tip to the ex
pectations bestowed upon them in
the preseason.
The Ducks were picked to finish
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll,
but currendy sit in seventh place.
The same home-road disparity
applies to Oregon State, which
boasts a 10-2 home record (one of
their losses was to Stanford, 62-51 in
mid-January), but are a mediocre 2-
6 away from Corvallis.
And they've never beaten Stan
ford at Maples in 16 tries—ls of
which ended up in double-digit
losses for the Beavers.
But the Cardinal can't worry
about that. Iliey've just got to start
executing better.

Translation: Get someone not
named Nicole Powell scoring consis
tently.
The No. 6 Cardinal (17-2,9-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will try to do
that and more as it hosts the Oregon

schools this weekend. Stanford faces
Oregon (8-12, 4-7) Thursday at 7
p.m. and Oregon State (12-8.6-5) in
a Saturday afternoon affair begin
ning at 2 p.m.
Recently, there's been a danger
ous trend developing for the team
from the Farm: Stanford has begun
to lean too heavily on its All-Ameri
can forward to shoulder the scoring

load — and the much-talked about
Cardinal offensive balance has
seemed to curiously disappear.
Not even VanDerveer has a
plausible explanation.
"To me, it's inexplicable," she
said.
Stanford relied on Powell to
carry it down the stretch in games in
January against Oregon, Washing
ton and UCLA — which wasn't any
thing out of the ordinary when you
consider her talent level. The re
liance became a problem when the
other contributions started to wane.
When the buzzer sounded at the
Cardinal's first conference loss, a 75-
72 decision at Southern California,
Powell's stat line was testimony to
her usual dominant performance.
She poured in 34 points and grab
bing 15 rebounds — but Chelsea
Trotter (10 points) was the only
other Cardinal player to score in
double figures.
It seemed like the problem was
rectified against Cal last Wednes
day, when three players scored in
double digits, and Powell had only
nine points while doing a better job
of gett ing others involved.
But Saturday's narrow win in a
rematch with Cal saw Powell score
19, and for the first time all season
no other Cardinal player reached
double-digits in scoring.
VanDerveer wants those kinds of
numbers to change.
"There are some basic flaws with
some of the things that we've been
doing," she said. "I feel like we've
had a psychological letdown.
"People played fearlessly without
Nicole in the lineup. But when she
came back, people just said 'She can
do it for us.' We need to get away
from that."
Case in point: Sophomores Kel
ley Suminski and Azella Perryman
were one-two in scoring for the
Cardinal before Powell returned

from her bulging disc injury in
early January.
In the last five games, however,
Suminski has averaged 7.4 points
per game and Perryman 5.4. (It
should be noted that Perryman's
numbers are somewhat skewed
since she's lost playing time to
Trotter.)
So how does Stanford go about
fixing a problem that doesn't seem
to have a clear cause?
"We need to make some techni
cal adjustments to our offense,"
VanDerveer said. "I want us to ran
more and we have to be a better
passing team."
The problem may have emerged
from the uncertainty of Powell's sit
uation in the first few months of the
season. The Cardinal had to plan to
play without her and, until now,
didn't think about how she'd blend
into the chemistry of this year's
young squad.
"We are trying to see how Nicole
fits in with everyone," VanDerveer
said. "We do have a plan to use her:
take advantage of her versatility and
talent."
And it was at Oregon on Jan. 11
when all of Stanford remembered
how special Powell can be. The Car
dinal, after having led by as many as
15 points in the second half, found
itself trailing 74-73 after a pair of
free throws by Ducks forward Car
olyn Ganes with 3.3 seconds left.
So all t he Cardinal had to do was
pull off its version of the Mail Mar)'
to seal the victory .
TNae Thiel launched a 75-foot

pass downcourt to a streaking Pow
ell, who caught the ball behind Ducks
defender Kedzie Gunderson and
was tackled en route to the hoop.
Powell then made both ends of a 1-
and-1 to give the Cardinal an im
probable 75-74 victory at rambunc
tious Mac Arthur Court in Eugene.
"That was a huge play for our
team," VanDerveer said. "That in
some ways reminded Nicole who
she really was."
Of course, Stanford gets to face
the Ducks at Maples Pavilion this
time, so a repeat performance out of
Bev Smith's squad, which plays
poorly away from home, isn't as
likely.
"They play with a lot more confi
dence at home," VanDerveer said.
Then again, there hasn't been a
whole lot for die sub-.500 Ducks to
be confident about. They've en
dured a bevy of turmoil; from
Shaquala Williams' dismissal to
Catherine Kraayeveld's mysterious
staph infection, Oregon has been
hard-pressed to live tip to the ex
pectations bestowed upon them in
the preseason.
The Ducks were picked to finish
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll,
but currendy sit in seventh place.
The same home-road disparity
applies to Oregon State, which
boasts a 10-2 home record (one of
their losses was to Stanford, 62-51 in
