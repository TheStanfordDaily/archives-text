# Cardinal gets midterm back and scores well
## 
### 
With only eight Pacific-10
Conference games left
before that whole March
Madness thing starts, I think it
might be a good idea if we took a
close look at the Stanford women's
basketball team. After all, the Car
dinal — at least by Stanford's
ridiculous Sears Cup standards —
has been lagging a bit in the post
season in recent years.
True, last year they made some
strides in reaching the Sweet 16,
but in the previous four years the

Cardinal could get
no further than
the second round.
(In 1998, Stanford
had that infamous
loss to 16th-seed
ed Harvard.)
The fact of the
matter is that
coach Tara Van-
Derveer has estab-

lished one of the winningest pro
grams in the college basketball
world in her years on the Farm, but
the last few have seen a departure
from her team's usual winning
ways. So though people will argue
that this club is filled with an en
tirely new nucleus and that recent
failures don't mean anything to
them, these young players are still
fighting a bit of recent revisionist
history.
In the spirit of the times, let's
give the Stanford players their own
midterm ...
(By the way, there's no curve
here. The grades are based on a
comparison of what I expected of
the players and how they've per
formed thus far.)
Center: A-
Chelsea Trotter, when she
doesn't have those thick ice packs
taped to her knees, has been noth

ing short of spectacular in the post.
She aggressively takes the ball to
the basket, and as VanDerveer likes
to say, she gives the Cardinal "in
stant offense." But she has those
nagging health limitations and
can't practice much.
T'Nae Thiel is the Cardinal's
most staunch defender and has
shut down such inside workhorses
as Arizona's Shawntinice Polk. But
she's had only a couple of games
where her offensive output has
matched her defensive fire — and
that must change if the Cardinal
ever has a cold shooting night in
March.
Sara McGee joined the team in
late December and hasn't really
had a visible impact — yet. She
could be a rebounding machine in
The Tournament if her game has
rounded out by then.
Forwards: B+
Nicole Powell is Nicole Powell,
so we don't need to say too much
about her. It's pretty obvious. She's
been doing everything recently —
scoring, rebounding, distributing
the ball, coming up with opportune
steals — and seems to be a surefire
candidate for the Wade Trophy
awarded to the nation's best player
despite her missing Stanford's first
nine games.
Azella Perryman began the sea
son as Stanford's leading rebound
er and second-leading scorer, and
it seemed like before Pac-10 play
got in full swing that she'd elevated
her game to a whole new level. But
in the last few weeks, her produc
tion has gone down and so have her
minutes. It's really hard to explain
why, but it's sure been disappoint
ing for everybody surrounding the
team. Stanford has got to find a way


Nathan Kurz
for Perryman to regain whatever
she's missing — be it opportunity
or confidence—so she can start
draining those unstoppable fade
away shots that drive opponent
coaches crazy.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu recently
lost her starting role in a lineup
shakeup after the USC game.
Some games she's been money
from beyond the arc and others she
hasn't been able to make anything
(she went scoreless against Cal Sat
urday). But she's definitely made
considerable strides from last year
and is still a 3-point threat the Car
dinal can look to when it needs a
big basket.
Katie Denny began the season
injured, and in her first game back
against Princeton, she scored a ca
reer-high 18 points. But since then,
she hasn't come close to matching
that production on either side of
the floor. VanDerveer moved her
inside in hopes of utilizing her
quickness, but Denny has suffered
from knee injuries recently and has
missed the last five games.
Guards: B +
I like VanDerveer's description
of Susan King as a warrior. She's
been just that in her first full season
on the Farm after battling injuries
for the last two years. She hasn't
quite scored as much as you'd ex
pect, but she's definitely hit a lot of
big shots for die Cardinal down the
stretch. King has done an excellent

job of distributing the ball and run
ning the offense. She's been a
leader on a Stanford team without
any seniors. In short, she's given
VanDerveer that true point guard
(see Jennifer Azzi or any other of
the point guard success stories in
the '90s) that the Cardinal has
lacked recently.
Kelley Suminski has been puz
zling lately. She, like Ferryman,
stepped up offensively without
Powell in the lineup but hasn't con
sistendy been hitting double fig
ures like earlier in the season re
cendy. She needs to get back to the
penetrate-and-kick game that
Stanford so effectively used earlier
in the season — and that will help
Kimyacioglu, too.
Cumulative GPA: 3.5
Right now, Stanford is in line for
a No. 2 seed in the West and would
probably be considered the best of
the second seeds, so it wouldn't be
placed in the same region with
Connecticut or Duke, (That's that
weird S-curve concept. Don't
worry about what it really means,
just trust me.) Stanford's ability to
come from behind and place in
close games / pressure-packed situ
ations bodes well for the NCAAs.
What's most important now is
for VanDerveer to have her team
peaking at the right time. The Car
dinal can't afford to go into The
Tournament on some sort of losing
streak, so she needs to keep her
team focused on avoiding a late
season meltdown. It might even be
best if the Cardinal does not receive
a No. 1 seed though, since it'd keep
the pressure off this young team.

before that whole March
Madness thing starts, I think it
might be a good idea if we took a
close look at the Stanford women's
basketball team. After all, the Car
dinal — at least by Stanford's
ridiculous Sears Cup standards —
has been lagging a bit in the post
season in recent years.
True, last year they made some
strides in reaching the Sweet 16,
but in the previous four years the

Cardinal could get
no further than
the second round.
(In 1998, Stanford
had that infamous
loss to 16th-seed
ed Harvard.)
The fact of the
matter is that
coach Tara Van-
Derveer has estab-

lished one of the winningest pro
grams in the college basketball
world in her years on the Farm, but
the last few have seen a departure
from her team's usual winning
ways. So though people will argue
that this club is filled with an en
tirely new nucleus and that recent
failures don't mean anything to
them, these young players are still
fighting a bit of recent revisionist
history.
In the spirit of the times, let's
give the Stanford players their own
midterm ...
(By the way, there's no curve
here. The grades are based on a
comparison of what I expected of
the players and how they've per
formed thus far.)
Center: A-
Chelsea Trotter, when she
doesn't have those thick ice packs
taped to her knees, has been noth

ing short of spectacular in the post.
She aggressively takes the ball to
the basket, and as VanDerveer likes
to say, she gives the Cardinal "in
stant offense." But she has those
nagging health limitations and
can't practice much.
T'Nae Thiel is the Cardinal's
most staunch defender and has
shut down such inside workhorses
as Arizona's Shawntinice Polk. But
she's had only a couple of games
where her offensive output has
matched her defensive fire — and
that must change if the Cardinal
ever has a cold shooting night in
March.
Sara McGee joined the team in
late December and hasn't really
had a visible impact — yet. She
could be a rebounding machine in
The Tournament if her game has
rounded out by then.
Forwards: B+
Nicole Powell is Nicole Powell,
so we don't need to say too much
about her. It's pretty obvious. She's
been doing everything recently —
scoring, rebounding, distributing
the ball, coming up with opportune
steals — and seems to be a surefire
candidate for the Wade Trophy
awarded to the nation's best player
despite her missing Stanford's first
nine games.
Azella Perryman began the sea
son as Stanford's leading rebound
er and second-leading scorer, and
it seemed like before Pac-10 play
got in full swing that she'd elevated
her game to a whole new level. But
in the last few weeks, her produc
tion has gone down and so have her
minutes. It's really hard to explain
why, but it's sure been disappoint
ing for everybody surrounding the
team. Stanford has got to find a way


Nathan Kurz
for Perryman to regain whatever
she's missing — be it opportunity
or confidence—so she can start
draining those unstoppable fade
away shots that drive opponent
coaches crazy.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu recently
lost her starting role in a lineup
shakeup after the USC game.
Some games she's been money
from beyond the arc and others she
hasn't been able to make anything
(she went scoreless against Cal Sat
urday). But she's definitely made
considerable strides from last year
and is still a 3-point threat the Car
dinal can look to when it needs a
big basket.
Katie Denny began the season
injured, and in her first game back
against Princeton, she scored a ca
reer-high 18 points. But since then,
she hasn't come close to matching
that production on either side of
the floor. VanDerveer moved her
inside in hopes of utilizing her
quickness, but Denny has suffered
from knee injuries recently and has
missed the last five games.
Guards: B +
I like VanDerveer's description
of Susan King as a warrior. She's
been just that in her first full season
on the Farm after battling injuries
for the last two years. She hasn't
quite scored as much as you'd ex
pect, but she's definitely hit a lot of
big shots for die Cardinal down the
stretch. King has done an excellent

job of distributing the ball and run
ning the offense. She's been a
leader on a Stanford team without
any seniors. In short, she's given
VanDerveer that true point guard
(see Jennifer Azzi or any other of
the point guard success stories in
the '90s) that the Cardinal has
lacked recently.
Kelley Suminski has been puz
zling lately. She, like Ferryman,
stepped up offensively without
Powell in the lineup but hasn't con
sistendy been hitting double fig
ures like earlier in the season re
cendy. She needs to get back to the
penetrate-and-kick game that
Stanford so effectively used earlier
in the season — and that will help
Kimyacioglu, too.
Cumulative GPA: 3.5
Right now, Stanford is in line for
a No. 2 seed in the West and would
probably be considered the best of
the second seeds, so it wouldn't be
placed in the same region with
Connecticut or Duke, (That's that
weird S-curve concept. Don't
worry about what it really means,
just trust me.) Stanford's ability to
come from behind and place in
close games / pressure-packed situ
ations bodes well for the NCAAs.
What's most important now is
for VanDerveer to have her team
peaking at the right time. The Car
dinal can't afford to go into The
Tournament on some sort of losing
streak, so she needs to keep her
team focused on avoiding a late
season meltdown. It might even be
best if the Cardinal does not receive
a No. 1 seed though, since it'd keep
the pressure off this young team.
