# Cardinal gets midterm back and scores well
## 
### 
With only eight Pacific-10
Conference games left
before that whole March
Madness thing starts, I think it
might be a good idea if we took a
close look at the Stanford women's
basketball team. After all, the Car
dinal — at least by Stanford's
ridiculous Sears Cup standards —
has been lagging a bit in the post
season in recent years.
True, last year they made some
strides in reaching the Sweet 16,
but in the previous four years the

Cardinal could get
no further than
the second round.
(In 1998, Stanford
had that infamous
loss to 16th-seed
ed Harvard.)
The fact of the
matter is that
coach Tara Van-
Derveer has estab-

lished one of the winningest pro
grams in the college basketball
world in her years on the Farm, but
the last few have seen a departure
from her team's usual winning
ways. So though people will argue
that this club is filled with an en
tirely new nucleus and that recent
failures don't mean anything to
them, these young players are still
fighting a bit of recent revisionist
history.
In the spirit of the times, let's
give the Stanford players their own
midterm ...
(By the way, there's no curve
here. The grades are based on a
comparison of what I expected of
the players and how they've per
formed thus far.)
Center: A-
Chelsea Trotter, when she
doesn't have those thick ice packs
taped to her knees, has been noth

ing short of spectacular in the post.
She aggressively takes the ball to
the basket, and as VanDerveer likes
to say, she gives the Cardinal "in
stant offense." But she has those
nagging health limitations and
can't practice much.
T'Nae Thiel is the Cardinal's
most staunch defender and has
shut down such inside workhorses
as Arizona's Shawntinice Polk. But
she's had only a couple of games
where her offensive output has
matched her defensive fire — and
that must change if the Cardinal
ever has a cold shooting night in
March.
Sara McGee joined the team in
late December and hasn't really
had a visible impact — yet. She
could be a rebounding machine in
The Tournament if her game has
rounded out by then.
Forwards: B+
Nicole Powell is Nicole Powell,
so we don't need to say too much
about her. It's pretty obvious. She's
been doing everything recently —
scoring, rebounding, distributing
the ball, coming up with opportune
steals — and seems to be a surefire
candidate for the Wade Trophy
awarded to the nation's best player
despite her missing Stanford's first
nine games.
Azella Perryman began the sea
son as Stanford's leading rebound
er and second-leading scorer, and
it seemed like before Pac-10 play
got in full swing that she'd elevated
her game to a whole new level. But
in the last few weeks, her produc
tion has gone down and so have her
minutes. It's really hard to explain
why, but it's sure been disappoint
ing for everybody surrounding the
team. Stanford has got to find a way
