# Football inks coveted recruits
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford football team may have
had a brutal 2-9 season in 2002, but that
didn't stop some of this year's best incoming
college talent from inking with the Cardinal.
Yesterday — which was national letter of
intent day — head coach Buddy Teevens
signed top players from California, while
also raiding his old southern haunting
grounds. He even scored a recruiting coup
over Tyrone Willingham.
ESPN.com yesterday had Stanford's class
of recruits ranked as the 15th-best in college
football.
"We went head to head with some of the
top programs around," Teevens said at yes
terday's press conference. "We want to take
this program to the highest level, and to do
so, you need players that can compete at the
highest level."
Headlining the Cardinal's recruiting
class is Menlo-Aiherton quarterback T.C.
Ostrander. The 6-foot-2 signalcaller chose
Stanford over offers from Arizona State,
Colorado and Oregon. Ranked as the 6th
best quarterback in the nation by Student
Sports, he threw for 44 touchdowns against
just seven interceptions and scored a 1460

on his SAT.
"He's a very accurate passer, his arm
strength is very solid, and he's not afraid to
throw it deep," Teevens said. "He feels very
confident in his abilities to compete [right
away]."
Evan Moore, a 6-7 wide receiver from
Brea, Calif., will remind Cardinal fans of
Teyo Johnson not just because of his height
but because he was recruited as a 2-sport
athlete and will suit up for Mike Mont
gomery's basketball squad in addition to his
gridiron duties.
"He's very gifted in tight quarters,"
Teevens said. "He's 6-7, so he'll go up and
get it."
Teevens and his staff talked running
backs Jason Evans and David Marrero out
of prior verbal commitments (Penn State
and Notre Dame, respectively). The two Ail-
American running backs combined for 41
touchdowns in their senior seasons and
were both ranked among the top-25 run
ning backs by Thelnsiders.com. They have
good blocking company in Emeka Nnoli,
who was a consensus Prep Ail-American and
was consistendy ranked as one of the top
fullbacks.
"That combination has great potential,"
Teevens said.

Marrero is from Florida, while Evans
hails from Georgia, highlighting a draft class
that shows remarkable geographic div ersity,
including a whopping 13 recruits from the
South. Teevens, a former offensive assistant
at Florida and head coach at Tulane, still ob
viously has Southern connections.
"We were very aggressive," he said. "Our
thought was to throw a net across the coun
try."
Other star recruits include 6-2 Fremont,
Calif, wide receiver Mark Bradford, who
was ranked the best receiver in the West by
Prep Star and was on everyone's Top 100
list and cannon-legged All-American
punter-kicker Jay Ottovegio, who was
ranked No. 2 in the nation by several publi
cations.
Stanford, due to its academic require
ments, is traditionally seen as having a seri
ous disadvantage in recruiting. Teevens,
though, saw the University's admissions
standards as having positive effects as well.
Stanford is one of the few major college pro
grams that requires its recruits to go
through an application process.
"It's a huge effort on their part," Teevens
explained. "It's a natural sifting process."
Teevens said that Stanford's recruiting
process wasn't impacted much by the Cardi

rial's poor showing in 2002.
" Probably more so from our opponents,"
he said. "Negative recruiting is alive and
well."
Teevens added that the current team de
serves a great deal of credit for Stanford's re
cruiting success.
"The greatest tribute probably goes to

our players ... the most important sales
people by far are the people who are play
ing," Teevens said. "The sense of enthusi
asm the [visiting] recruits had from our play
ers, the belief that our players have in the di
rection of the program . . . that's really
what's most telling about the whole
process."
