## March Madness? Don't bet on it 
### 
So Stanford basketball has
beaten two No. 1 teams
this season - 'Zona last
week away, and Florida
(who won't be No. 1 much longer
after that debacle Tuesday night)
in New York — yet remains un
ranked in the ESPN/USA Today
Coaches Poll.
How is this possible?
You can blame it on whatever
you want — the loss to Montana at
home that still stings, the East
Coast bias, cosmic flux. In truth,
though, I think it's just a preview

of the turbulence,
slights, and mad
ness that will blow
in like El Nino in a
few short weeks.
That's right,
March Madness is
coming. Get
ready.
It's "Rivalry
Week" this week

for most of the country in college
hoops, though I don't really see
how we have an especially intense
rivalry with the Ducks or the
Beavers. But leaving that aside, it's
a week filled with blockbuster
matchups:
Duke — UNC.
Cincinnati — Louisville.
Gonzaga — Pepperdine.
Sacramento State — San Jose
Christian College.
(Okay, scratch that last one).
But the idea remains the same
— college basketball is getting se
rious. You can check out Joe Lu
nardi's Bracketology (I'm taking it
for 3 units) on ESPN.com and it
starts to make some sense. You can
start paying attention to road wins,
RPI, who's hot and who's not, re
cent losses, conference records
and everything in between.
The people who are really pay
ing attention to these things,
though, are the ones who will put
money down on those games in
March.
You know that guy, the sports
nerd in your dorm who you know
is going to win the dorm pool?
(Hypothetically, of course — I
know college students don't even
wager laundry money on college
athletics).
I've tried everything I can in
those bracket pools and somehow
always come up short. I've taken
them seriously, actually picking
who I think would win. No luck.

I've gone the mascot route, pitting
each mascot against the other in a
sort of stuffed animal celebrity
deathmatch. Abject failure. I've re
sorted to picking teams on the
basis of how cute the women at
that school are. (Arizona State is
definitely in my Final Four, then).
I have a friend who goes to
Vegas every year for the first week
end of the tournament. He sits in a
sports bar, lays out all his parlays
and prospectives, enjoys a cold,
free Heineken and watches bas
ketball from dawn to dusk. He
comes back with tales of point
spreads, fortunes won and lost,
things that he "doesn't quite re
member," and a 3-day beard.
I don't think that'd be for me.
No problems with Vegas, but I'll
stick to cards and dice rather
than sports. Last time I was there
I put down a sawbuck on the
Broncos and they couldn't even
cover the spread against the
Chargers. (Forget the spread,
they didn't even win the game
... but I digress).
When I was up in Tahoe the
other weekend I was watching the
Eagles-Bucs game in our house,
planning to just lay on the floor all
day watching football. A resident
came back from the casino, run
ning in the door (leaving it open, I
should add), demanding to know
if there was a score in the first two
minutes. We told him that yes, ac
tually, there had been a touch
down.
"Sweet!" he said. "Now all I
need is less than two fumbles,
more than three interceptions,
total score under 47, Philly win
ning by more than 14, and fewer
than 24 Philadelphia fans arrested
at Veteran's Stadium and I win
$127.30!"
I asked him to kindly shut the
door and get me another beer out
of the fridge.
So I think I'll refrain from
sports betting this season, even
when the Madness of March in
vades. I'll fill out a bracket, I'll
keep track of how my picks are
doing — but I'm not throwing my
money away on it this time. I'll save
it for the blackjack table.

Economics and Italian who thinks the
Cardinal should be ranked at least No.
19 or 20. Send him your thoughts at

sports betting this season, even
when the Madness of March in
vades. I'll fill out a bracket, I'll
keep track of how my picks are
doing — but I'm not throwing my
money away on it this time. I'll save
it for the blackjack table.

Matt Babin is a senior majoring in
Economics and Italian who thinks the
Cardinal should be ranked at least No.
19 or 20. Send him your thoughts at
