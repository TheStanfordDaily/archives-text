The No. 14 Stanford softball
team (1-1) will pack its bags this
weekend and began a 5-week,
country-wide journey of tourna
ments, including two that will be
played here on the Farm for the first
time.

Softball
at Fiesta Bowl Tournament at Phoenix,
Arizona

This weekend, however, the
Cardinal will hit the road for
Phoenix, Arizona and the ASU Fies
ta Bowl Tonrnament. Stanford is
scheduled to take on No. 25 Massa
chusetts, UNLV, No. 10 Cal State
Fullerton (2-1), SW Texas State (3-
2), and Texas Tech (1-4).
The ASU Fiesta Bowl is nothing
new to the seniors on the squad, in
cluding left-fielder Cassi Brang
ham, second baseman Kira Ching,
pitcher Tori Nyberg and first base
man Maureen LeCocq. This was
the site where they each played in
and won their first tournament in a
Cardinal uniform,
There are a few obstacles the
Cardinal must tackle, however, be
fore reclaiming the tide in 2003, the
first of which will be No. 25 Massa
chusetts.

The tournament opener for the
Cardinal will also serve as the season
opener for the Minutewomen.
UMass will take the field with six re
turning starters from their 2002
squad that finished the season 53-
13. That squad also reached the
NCAA Regionals last year after
posting the nation's longest win
ning streak at 33 games en route to
their eighth consecutive Atlantic-10
Conference tide.
Standing in the Minutewomen's
way, however, will be a dominant
Nyberg, who did not allow an
earned run in her first game of the
season.
Also bound to see the circle fora
few innings this weekend is
Sorensen. After sitting out the 2002
season with a torn ACL and this
year's opener because of a recent
knee scope surgery, the two-time
All-American was just medically
cleared to take on opposing bats
again.
The Cardinal will batde UNLV
in its second game of the day.
Against the Rebels, Stanford will
again attack a team that has not yet
taken the field in 2003.
The Cardinal will then get a
chance to rest before facing off
against the No. 10 Titans of Cal
State-Fullerton Saturday morning.


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore outfielder Leah Nelson and the No. 14 Stanford softball team
will travel to the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix this weekend. They will look to avenge
last year's loss to Cal-State Fullerton in the NCAA tournament.
Beyond promising to be a challeng
ing matchup for both Stanford and
Fullerton, this game also has the po
tential to serve as revenge for the
Cardinal.
The last time the two teams took
the field together was in the 2002
NCAA Regional Tournament,

when the Titans finished on top —
4-I—and ended the Cardinal's
season.
The Titans, the only squad
ranked above the Cardinal on diis
weekend's schedule, are off to an
impressive start this season. In its
season-opening tournaments, the
squad beat powerhouses No. 22 Al
abama and No. 1 UCLA.
Leading the fight for the Titans
at the plate is senior outfielder
Kristy Halagarda. Halagarda, al

though standing at just five feet tall,
has been unstoppable at the plate so
far this season. She went 4-5 in the
games against Alabama and UCLA
in addition to knocking in the only
run in the Titan victory over 'Bama.
In the circle for the Titans is se
nior All-American utility player
Gina Oaks — an all-too-familiar
foe for the Cardinal. Oaks, who
shut down Cardinal batters in last
season's playoff win, continues to
overpower opposing bats this year.

This past weekend, Oaks struck out
16 batters in 14.2 innings of work.
Stanford will need more success
from the plate than it had in last
weekend's loss to Pacific if it is to pro
duce against the Titans.
The Cardinal bats will need to
keep swinging into the afternoon
on Saturday, as Stanford will get lit
tle rest before taking on Southwest
Texas State.
The Bobcats are currendy led in
the circle by junior Nicole Neuer

burg, who was named the South
land Conference Pitcher of the
Week this past Tuesday. Neuerburg
posted two wins for SW Texas State
last weekend, including a 2-1 win
over Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in
which the hurler racked up 15
strikeouts.
Another of Neuerburg's victories
was over Texas Tech, die Cardinal's
final competitor of the weekend.
The Red Raiders are a young
team with eight newcomers that

have nothing to lose against a
strong Pac-10 team. Stanford
will need to come out ready to
play at its own level in order to
keep this budding opponent
under control.
Stanford's trip to Arizona will be
a tough one and a testimony ofjust
what this team is capable of in the
lengthy season ahead, and with
five games in three days, the Car
dinal will have plenty of room to
prove itself.
