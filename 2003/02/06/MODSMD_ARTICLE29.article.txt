Softball
at Fiesta Bowl Tournament at Phoenix,
Arizona

This weekend, however, the
Cardinal will hit the road for
Phoenix, Arizona and the ASU Fies
ta Bowl Tonrnament. Stanford is
scheduled to take on No. 25 Massa
chusetts, UNLV, No. 10 Cal State
Fullerton (2-1), SW Texas State (3-
2), and Texas Tech (1-4).
The ASU Fiesta Bowl is nothing
new to the seniors on the squad, in
cluding left-fielder Cassi Brang
ham, second baseman Kira Ching,
pitcher Tori Nyberg and first base
man Maureen LeCocq. This was
the site where they each played in
and won their first tournament in a
Cardinal uniform,
There are a few obstacles the
Cardinal must tackle, however, be
fore reclaiming the tide in 2003, the
first of which will be No. 25 Massa
chusetts.

The tournament opener for the
Cardinal will also serve as the season
opener for the Minutewomen.
UMass will take the field with six re
turning starters from their 2002
squad that finished the season 53-
13. That squad also reached the
NCAA Regionals last year after
posting the nation's longest win
ning streak at 33 games en route to
their eighth consecutive Atlantic-10
Conference tide.
Standing in the Minutewomen's
way, however, will be a dominant
Nyberg, who did not allow an
earned run in her first game of the
season.
Also bound to see the circle fora
few innings this weekend is
Sorensen. After sitting out the 2002
season with a torn ACL and this
year's opener because of a recent
knee scope surgery, the two-time
All-American was just medically
cleared to take on opposing bats
again.
The Cardinal will batde UNLV
in its second game of the day.
Against the Rebels, Stanford will
again attack a team that has not yet
taken the field in 2003.
The Cardinal will then get a
chance to rest before facing off
against the No. 10 Titans of Cal
State-Fullerton Saturday morning.

Sophomore outfielder Leah Nelson and the No. 14 Stanford softball team
will travel to the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix this weekend. They will look to avenge
last year's loss to Cal-State Fullerton in the NCAA tournament.
