# Univ. reports deficit
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
After the economy's lackluster
performance last year, Stanford re
ported an operations deficit of $ 17
million and a total loss of $860 mil
lion in assets for fiscal year 2002,
which ended on Aug, 31, 2002.
According to Stanford's annual
fiscal report for 2002, revenues in
creased 5.4 percent relative to
2001, while expenses increased 9.5
percent and overtook revenues, re
sulting in this year's $17 million
budget shortfall.
Income from students in
creased by 1.7 percent to $305 mil
lion and comprised 14 percent of
the University's total operating
revenues. However, this rise in
revenue was eclipsed by an in
crease of 16 percent in financial
aid relative to the previous year,
which was $107 million of operat
ing expenses.
Stanford's total assets declined
to $12.8 billion after the loss of
$860 million from the end of fiscal
year 2001.
Despite declines in numerous
aspects of the budget, not all Uni
versity-related entities posted loss
es. According to the annual report,
the Stanford Hospital and Clinics

and the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital reported a combined sur
plus of $51 million.
Stanford has taken a number of
measures to reduce expenditures
in future years, including a Univer
sity-wide hiring freeze implement
ed in October and reductions in
department budgets.
"Although we face a number
of challenges — limited space for
growth, an endowment that is too
small on a per-student basis,
aging facilities that must be reno
vated or replaced and a down
turn in the U.S. economy — the
opportunities before us are re
markable," said University Presi
dent John Hennessy in a letter
accompanying the report. "We
will continue to innovate and in
vest in the future, whether that
means a series of multidiscipli
nary initiatives or new opportu
nities for undergraduates."
Stanford University Board of
Trustees Chair Isaac Stein stressed
that, in dealing with these budget
shortcomings, the University
would be careful not to compro
mise its long-term mission.
"Stanford must always admit
students without regard to their
ability to pay tuition and offer them
the best possible education," Stein

said in the report. "Stanford must
always attract outstanding faculty
and foster world-class research.
University officials are also re
minding faculty and students to
consider the larger picture, not just
the economic losses of the past cou
ple of years.
"Despite a second consecutive
year of investment losses, the Uni
versity remains in a much stronger
financial position than five years

ago," Randy Livingston, Stanford's
vice president for business affairs
and chief financial officer, said in
the report.
Though the University in
curred a deficit in its general oper
ations budget in 2002, it avoided
doing so in 2001 despite a similar
year-long downturn in invest
ments and ended the year with a

$59 million operations surplus.
Livingston emphasized that
Stanford is not the only institution
that has borne the brunt the recent
financial downturns.
"The [2002 fiscal year] was a
challenging one for higher edu
cation institutions, including
Stanford," he said. "Many uni
versities experienced negative
investment returns for the sec
ond year in a row, reflecting the
continuing decline in equity
market values."
