# ACL injuries plague women's basketball
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A, C, and L are the three most
daunting letters in women's bas
ketball today. Medically, ACL
stands for Anterior Cruciate Liga
ment, the ligament that stabilizes
the knee and controls pivoting.
Athletically, an ACL injury means
four to 12 months of rehab, usual
ly the loss of the season and greater
risk of further injury. Female ath
letes might want to stop reading
this article now because the statis
tics are demoralizing.
Numbers gathered by the
NCAA over a 3-year period in the
early '90s suggest that female bas
ketball players sustain ACL in
juries four times as often as their
male counterparts. Other studies
report that women are anywhere

from two to eight times as likely as
men to tear the ligament.
The view that a woman's body is
too fragile to compete at a high ath
letic level could only be considered
misogynistic in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, statistics on ACL
injuries are a sad reminder of the
current limitations of the female
anatomy under intense athletic
stress.
No top program has avoided
the plague, including Stanford,
who has three players on the cur
rent roster with reconstructed
ACLs. Sophomore center Chelsea
Trotter tore both in high school
and sat out last season with reoc
curring knee pain. Sophomore
Susan King suffered a season-end
ing ACL injury nine games into
her stellar freshman season and
then stretched the same ligament a

year later. Freshman Eziamaka
Okafor is out for this season with
an ACL injury sustained over the
summer.
Once torn, the ligament has a 5
to 8 percent chance of reinjury, so
many players, like King and Trot
ter, go through the grueling rehab

process more than once.
"The first time was really hard
for me," King said. "It was horri
ble. I was really out of it so I just
kind of got through it. The second
time I did it, I rehabbed up in the


LUIS ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
City at an amazing facility. I drove
an hour each way but it was worth it.
Every rehab process is a little differ
ent, but I think realistically eight
months is on track. It's a long
process and I wouldn't want anyone
to go through it if they didn't have
to."
Eight months can be a relatively
optimistic prognosis. Just ask Trot
ter, who still ices her knees daily.
"Unfortunately I have had a ton
of complications," she said. "Initial
ly my doctor said six to nine months.
My first one took about 12 months
to rehab because I had a lot of
chronic inflammation and meniscal
damage and a lot of complications.
The second one I came back in 10
months."
This year, Duke lost ACC tour
nament MVP Monique Currie for
the season when she tore her ACL
seconds into the first preseason
game. Former Connecticut star
Shea Ralph tore hers three times
and Tennessee lost Ail-American
Tamika Catchings midway through
her senior season. The most de
pressing ACL story of the year,
though, belongs to Oklahoma.
Earlier this season, the Sooners
lost freshman Erin Higgins to an
ACL tear (her second) during a pre
game shoot around. Forty seconds
into the same game, senior Caton
Hill, OU's lone returning starter,

also tore her ACL.
"It'sjust one of those deals where
you question, is this for real? When
and where does this happen twice in
one day?" OU coach Sherri Coale
said after die game. "It is beyond a
fluke. It is beyond strange."
Unlike other knee ligaments, the
ACL does not have the capacity to
heal itself. Non-athletes sometimes
choose not to undergo reconstruc
tive surgery and instead live with a
less stable knee. Fora competitive
athlete, however, the only real
choice is which kind of reconstruc
tive surgery to have.
The most common ACL substi
tute is a graft of the patellar tendon
harvested from the patient's knee.
That method is considered to be
particularly durable, although the
rehabilitation process can take
longer. Another option is to implant
an ACL from a cadaver — the
method chosen by King's doctors
because the healing time is usually
shorter. However, King received a
faulty graft that cost her another
surgery and year of rehabilitation.
"I got the bad end of the stick,"
she said. "One in every ten thou
sand grafts is bad. When they took
out the stretched one the second
time they saw that I had a bad graft.
There is nothing you can do to pre
vent that."
While there is no clear under
standing of what causes ACL in
juries or how to prevent them, re
searchers have identified a number
of risk factors for women. In partic
ular wider hips, a smaller femoral

notch connecting the femur and the
upper leg, hormonal changes dur
ing the menstrual cycle that may
cause increased ligament laxity and
weak hamstring strength cause in
creased vulnerability for females.
Other theories posit that because
women start playing sports later
than men and they don't develop
the muscle strength necessary to en
dure physical stress. Only this theo
ry suggests the possibility of preven
tative measures and many women's
college basketball programs have
special training regimes designed to
prevent ACL injuries.
Tennessee players, for example,
sometimes train with thick tubing
connecting their ankles to induce
flexing of the hips and knees. They
also play "twister" style games to
work on balance. The training,
though, didn't prevent Catchings
from tearing an ACL.
The randomness of ACL injuries
makes them particularly scary. A
player's — and a team's — dreams
and goals can evaporate with one
false pivot. Just ask Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer who saw
All-American Kristen Folkl and
Vanessa Nygaard each tear their
ACL in a 4-day span leading up to
the 1998 NCAA tournament. Miss
ing two of its best players, the Cardi
nal lost to Harvard in the first round
of the tournament and became the
first No. 1 seed ever to lose to a No.
16 seed.
The fact that 70 percent of all
ACL injuries are non-contact adds
to their random nature. Most in

juries occur when a player cuts, piv
ots or lands awkwardly on a jump.
"The first time I did it, I heard
my knee pop," King said. "It sound
ed like a cork. The second time I
didn't tear it. I had a cadaver graft in
and it stretched out. I heard a rip in
the back of my knee cap."
"I was devastated," Trotter re
called. "The pain itself wasn't so
acute that I was writing in pain. It
was more psychologically damaging
than physically painful."
The number of ACL injuries in
women basketball is rising with the
quality of play.
Pre-Tide IX women's basketball
rules only allowed two players to
travel the full length of the court
and imposed a dribble limit. Under
these limitations, a woman would be
hard-pressed to work up a sweat,
not to mention tear a ligament.
Everything changed with Tide
IX, and the women's game is subject
to die same physical demands as the
men's. As ACL injuries reach epi
demic levels, coaches, trainers, doc
tors and players struggle with how
to react.
What I have learned about ACLs
is that a lot of it has to do with genet
ics. It is not necessarily anything you
do preventatively to keep it from oc
curring. It's how you are made,"
Trotter said.
Other than focusing on ham
string strength, the Stanford
women's basketball team does not
have a specific ACL training routine
because preventative measures are
not clear.

report that women are anywhere

from two to eight times as likely as
men to tear the ligament.
The view that a woman's body is
too fragile to compete at a high ath
letic level could only be considered
misogynistic in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, statistics on ACL
injuries are a sad reminder of the
current limitations of the female
anatomy under intense athletic
stress.
No top program has avoided
the plague, including Stanford,
who has three players on the cur
rent roster with reconstructed
ACLs. Sophomore center Chelsea
Trotter tore both in high school
and sat out last season with reoc
curring knee pain. Sophomore
Susan King suffered a season-end
ing ACL injury nine games into
her stellar freshman season and
then stretched the same ligament a

year later. Freshman Eziamaka
Okafor is out for this season with
an ACL injury sustained over the
summer.
Once torn, the ligament has a 5
to 8 percent chance of reinjury, so
many players, like King and Trot
ter, go through the grueling rehab

process more than once.
"The first time was really hard
for me," King said. "It was horri
ble. I was really out of it so I just
kind of got through it. The second
time I did it, I rehabbed up in the


LUIS ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
City at an amazing facility. I drove
an hour each way but it was worth it.
Every rehab process is a little differ
ent, but I think realistically eight
months is on track. It's a long
process and I wouldn't want anyone
to go through it if they didn't have
to."
Eight months can be a relatively
optimistic prognosis. Just ask Trot
ter, who still ices her knees daily.
"Unfortunately I have had a ton
of complications," she said. "Initial
ly my doctor said six to nine months.
My first one took about 12 months
to rehab because I had a lot of
chronic inflammation and meniscal
damage and a lot of complications.
The second one I came back in 10
months."
This year, Duke lost ACC tour
nament MVP Monique Currie for
the season when she tore her ACL
seconds into the first preseason
game. Former Connecticut star
Shea Ralph tore hers three times
and Tennessee lost Ail-American
Tamika Catchings midway through
her senior season. The most de
pressing ACL story of the year,
though, belongs to Oklahoma.
Earlier this season, the Sooners
lost freshman Erin Higgins to an
ACL tear (her second) during a pre
game shoot around. Forty seconds
into the same game, senior Caton
Hill, OU's lone returning starter,

also tore her ACL.
"It'sjust one of those deals where
you question, is this for real? When
and where does this happen twice in
one day?" OU coach Sherri Coale
said after die game. "It is beyond a
fluke. It is beyond strange."
Unlike other knee ligaments, the
ACL does not have the capacity to
heal itself. Non-athletes sometimes
choose not to undergo reconstruc
tive surgery and instead live with a
less stable knee. Fora competitive
athlete, however, the only real
choice is which kind of reconstruc
tive surgery to have.
The most common ACL substi
tute is a graft of the patellar tendon
harvested from the patient's knee.
That method is considered to be
particularly durable, although the
rehabilitation process can take
longer. Another option is to implant
an ACL from a cadaver — the
method chosen by King's doctors
because the healing time is usually
shorter. However, King received a
faulty graft that cost her another
surgery and year of rehabilitation.
"I got the bad end of the stick,"
she said. "One in every ten thou
sand grafts is bad. When they took
out the stretched one the second
time they saw that I had a bad graft.
There is nothing you can do to pre
vent that."
While there is no clear under
standing of what causes ACL in
juries or how to prevent them, re
searchers have identified a number
of risk factors for women. In partic
ular wider hips, a smaller femoral

notch connecting the femur and the
upper leg, hormonal changes dur
ing the menstrual cycle that may
cause increased ligament laxity and
weak hamstring strength cause in
creased vulnerability for females.
Other theories posit that because
women start playing sports later
than men and they don't develop
the muscle strength necessary to en
dure physical stress. Only this theo
ry suggests the possibility of preven
tative measures and many women's
college basketball programs have
special training regimes designed to
prevent ACL injuries.
Tennessee players, for example,
sometimes train with thick tubing
connecting their ankles to induce
flexing of the hips and knees. They
also play "twister" style games to
work on balance. The training,
though, didn't prevent Catchings
from tearing an ACL.
The randomness of ACL injuries
makes them particularly scary. A
player's — and a team's — dreams
and goals can evaporate with one
false pivot. Just ask Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer who saw
All-American Kristen Folkl and
Vanessa Nygaard each tear their
ACL in a 4-day span leading up to
the 1998 NCAA tournament. Miss
ing two of its best players, the Cardi
nal lost to Harvard in the first round
of the tournament and became the
first No. 1 seed ever to lose to a No.
16 seed.
The fact that 70 percent of all
ACL injuries are non-contact adds
to their random nature. Most in

juries occur when a player cuts, piv
ots or lands awkwardly on a jump.
"The first time I did it, I heard
my knee pop," King said. "It sound
ed like a cork. The second time I
didn't tear it. I had a cadaver graft in
and it stretched out. I heard a rip in
the back of my knee cap."
"I was devastated," Trotter re
called. "The pain itself wasn't so
acute that I was writing in pain. It
was more psychologically damaging
than physically painful."
The number of ACL injuries in
women basketball is rising with the
quality of play.
Pre-Tide IX women's basketball
rules only allowed two players to
travel the full length of the court
and imposed a dribble limit. Under
these limitations, a woman would be
hard-pressed to work up a sweat,
not to mention tear a ligament.
Everything changed with Tide
IX, and the women's game is subject
to die same physical demands as the
men's. As ACL injuries reach epi
demic levels, coaches, trainers, doc
tors and players struggle with how
to react.
What I have learned about ACLs
is that a lot of it has to do with genet
ics. It is not necessarily anything you
do preventatively to keep it from oc
curring. It's how you are made,"
Trotter said.
Other than focusing on ham
string strength, the Stanford
women's basketball team does not
have a specific ACL training routine
because preventative measures are
not clear.
A, C, and L are the three most
daunting letters in women's bas
ketball today. Medically, ACL
stands for Anterior Cruciate Liga
ment, the ligament that stabilizes
the knee and controls pivoting.
Athletically, an ACL injury means
four to 12 months of rehab, usual
ly the loss of the season and greater
risk of further injury. Female ath
letes might want to stop reading
this article now because the statis
tics are demoralizing.
Numbers gathered by the
NCAA over a 3-year period in the
early '90s suggest that female bas
ketball players sustain ACL in
juries four times as often as their
male counterparts. Other studies
report that women are anywhere

from two to eight times as likely as
men to tear the ligament.
