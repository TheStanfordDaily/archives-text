# ACL injuries plague women's basketball
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A, C, and L are the three most
daunting letters in women's bas
ketball today. Medically, ACL
stands for Anterior Cruciate Liga
ment, the ligament that stabilizes
the knee and controls pivoting.
Athletically, an ACL injury means
four to 12 months of rehab, usual
ly the loss of the season and greater
risk of further injury. Female ath
letes might want to stop reading
this article now because the statis
tics are demoralizing.
Numbers gathered by the
NCAA over a 3-year period in the
early '90s suggest that female bas
ketball players sustain ACL in
juries four times as often as their
male counterparts. Other studies
report that women are anywhere

from two to eight times as likely as
men to tear the ligament.
The view that a woman's body is
too fragile to compete at a high ath
letic level could only be considered
misogynistic in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, statistics on ACL
injuries are a sad reminder of the
current limitations of the female
anatomy under intense athletic
stress.
No top program has avoided
the plague, including Stanford,
who has three players on the cur
rent roster with reconstructed
ACLs. Sophomore center Chelsea
Trotter tore both in high school
and sat out last season with reoc
curring knee pain. Sophomore
Susan King suffered a season-end
ing ACL injury nine games into
her stellar freshman season and
then stretched the same ligament a

year later. Freshman Eziamaka
Okafor is out for this season with
an ACL injury sustained over the
summer.
Once torn, the ligament has a 5
to 8 percent chance of reinjury, so
many players, like King and Trot
ter, go through the grueling rehab

process more than once.
"The first time was really hard
for me," King said. "It was horri
ble. I was really out of it so I just
kind of got through it. The second
time I did it, I rehabbed up in the
