# Cardinal looks to avenge loss
## Defeat by Georgia was only loss for two years 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last year at the Team Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wis
consin, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team suffered a
rare occurrence that had not pre
viously transpired in the 2-year
tenure of coach Lele Forood â€” a
defeat.

Wisconsin, Today through Sunday

The 4-3 loss to Georgia, who
went on to win the tournament,
snapped a 35-match winning
streak for the Cardinal and placed
Stanford in an unfamiliar losing
position.
"I don't think there is any pres
sure to win after losing last year in
the semifinals," junior Emilia An
derson said. "[We] of course re
member the loss from last year, but
personally I don't think it will have
any affect on how we look at the
tournament this year."
Stanford (1-0) is the top seed
again at this year's competition
and will look to avenge the 2002
loss with a resounding victory.
However, a defeat would not be
too crushing, given the level of
competition at the tournament

and considering the fact that last
year's squad followed up the loss
with an NCAA Championship.
Likewise, a Stanford victory in
Wisconsin would be amplified by
the difficult national setting and
would solidify the team's position
at the peak of college tennis.
"The Team Indoors will defi
nitely be the biggest tournament
so far this year, but it is still so
early," Forood said. "A win or loss
at [the Indoors] will not be an indi
cator of anything but it is a good
chance to play against everyone
and see what the other teams, par
ticularly non-Pac-10 teams have to
offer."
The intensity of the tourna
ment will certainly be a challenge
fora young Cardinal team that has
played only one dual match as a
team and may still be searching for
some chemistry.
"This year's team is a totally dif
ferent team from last year, so as a
team this year, we are not going to
compare ourselves or compete
with teams of the past," Anderson
said. "We have to look forward,
and start competing as this team,
and gradually get into the season
together."
The Cardinal can do just that
when it begins play today against
host Wisconsin in the first round.
Stanford received the same draw
in 2002, blanking the Badgers, 7-0
in the opener. If Stanford wins its
first match, it will play tomorrow in
the quarterfinals against the win

ner of the match between No. 10
California and No. 14 William &
Mary.
Other seeded teams with which
Stanford may have to contend are
No. 2 Florida, No. 3 Georgia and
Pacific-10 Conference rivals No. 7
UCLA and No. 9 Southern Cali
fornia.
"It's the first big team tourna
ment of the year, and it's kind of like
a lower-end NCAA tournament,
because all the top teams are there,"
sophomore Erin Burdette said.
The Cardinal will likely com
pete with the same lineup used in
its 6-1 victory over Fresno State last
Saturday, which featured fresh
man Amber Liu at the top singles
spot, followed by junior Lauren
Barnikow, Burdette, freshman
Alice Barnes, Anderson, and
sophomore Story Tweedie-Yates,
who won all three of her singles
matches at last year's Team In
doors.
The doubles tandem of
Barnikow and Burdette will play
at the top spot for Stanford, fol
lowed by Liu and Barnes at No. 2
and Anderson and Tweedie-Yates
at No. 3.
"I think that once we get to the
Indoors and start playing more
matches, everything will fall into
place," Anderson said. "We [had
practice this week] to work on little
things here and there, but pretty
much what wc have now is what we
are bringing to Madison, and I
think it's pretty good stuff."
