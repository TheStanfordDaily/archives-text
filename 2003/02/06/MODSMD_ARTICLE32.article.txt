# Res Comp seeks to reduce illegal file-sharing
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to increased com
plaints from entertainment compa
nies that students are unlawfully
downloading copyrighted materi
als through online networking
programs, Residential Computing
has begun an effort to inform stu
dents that their Internet connec
tions may be shut down if they en
gage in illegal file-sharing activities.
According to Ethan Rikleen,
network and systems administra
tor for Res Comp, the Recording
Industry Association of America
and the American Association of
Producers are now using "'e-shar

ing programs such as Kazaa and
Bearshare to monitor individuals
trading material protected by
copyright laws. Upon finding such
files, these associations inform the
Internet Service Providers — or at
Stanford, the Computer Security
Office — of the users responsible
for such violations.
Rikleen said that recently the
Computer Security Office has re
ceived multiple complaints citing
the same individuals for having
the same material.
He explained that multiple
complaints could mean students
contacted previously lied about
deleting illegal files or re-down
loaded the material a second time.

Alternatively, an outside user
could have "broken into" the sys
tem and performed the repeat ille
gal activity, or the recording in
dustry could have made a mistake,
he said.
Until now, neither Res Comp
nor the Computer Security Office
had made attempts to verify the ac
curacy of the complaints sent to
them. Rikleen commented that a
meeting between Residential Edu
cation, the Dean of Students Of
fice, Judicial Affairs, Res Comp
and the Computer Security Office
will probably be scheduled within
the next few weeks to discuss what
should be done.
Administrators in Res Comp

and the Computer Security Office
are acting cautiously in dealing
with the situation, Rikleen said,
adding that their primary concern
is maintaining security.
"When you start monitoring
and policing your own network,
watching for network problems is
fine, but actively going out and
looking fora problem is wrong,"
Rikleen said. "Stanford treats its
students as adults."
Res Comp Director Richard
Holeton said that, upon receiving
a complaint, "the [Internet Service
Provider] is then obligated to re
spond by [issuing] a demand letter
asking the alleged file-sharer to
cease and to remove illegal materi
als from their computer."
The Computer Security Office,
which is responsible for on-cam
pus enforcement of copyright
laws, informs each offending stu
dent that a complaint was re
ceived. The students are then
given 24 hours to remove the ille
gal material from the network be
fore having their service discon
nected. If a student does not re
spond, Res Comp is requested to
"turn off' their connection.
Since the associations have
begun registering more com
plaints, Res Comp has been alert
ing students of the repercussions
for illegal file-sharing by sending
e-mails and using resident com
puter coordinators to help dissem
inate information.
However, this procedure is not
rigidly structured. Holeton com
mented that "policies and proce
dures are naturally a work in
progress."
According to Holeton, so far
"no Stanford student has ever had
their network connection shut
down for downloading copyright

ed material."
Rikleen described the system as
"very mellow — students have
generally responded fairly quickly
and have been cooperative."
Holeton added, "Res Comp is
focused on supporting student use
of technology in all its forms —
from academic to social and com
munity uses — and on educating
residents about technology, in
cluding technology and society."
Rikleen said that Res Comp has
a policy of not collecting informa

tion or statistics on what students
download and does not intend to
do so in the future. Holeton added
that the University does not use
firewalls and maintains a "more
open network than many other
colleges,"
However, limitations are placed
on bandwidth for practical speed
related reasons, which Rikleen ex
plained in and of itself is "de facto
content control."
"The recording industry would
have you believe that file-sharing is
stealing but it isn't," Rikleen said.
"There is an enormous amount of
potential for positive uses. People
should be using new technology
and trying new things."
