# Stanford professor's report linked to shuttle investigation
## 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
Investigations into the space shuttle Co
lumbia disaster are showcasing the links be
tween Stanford and the space program.
A report written by professors at Stanford
and Carnegie Mellon University in 1990
warned that the shuttle could be put at risk
by the loss of tiles designed to protect it from
the heat generated during re-entry to the
earth's atmosphere.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, chair of the De
partment of Management Science and En
gineering at Stanford, wrote the confiden
tial report for NASA with Paul Fischbeck, a
professor at Carnegie Mellon.
The report examined the risk posed by
tiles coming loose from the surface of the
shuttle. Falling debris or the weakening of
the tile itself or its bond to the aircraft could
cause this.
There is currently speculation that a
chunk of foam breaking from the shuttle's
external fuel tank and hitting tiles on the un

derside of the left wing during launch may
have caused the Columbia disaster.
But NASA said late yesterday at a news
briefing that the foam striking the shuttle's
wing was unlikely to have caused the loss of
Columbia.
Holt Ashley, aeronautics and astronautics
professor emeritus, said that it is too early to
jump to conclusions on the cause of the dis
aster.
"I'm a little surprised that NASA can be so
definite," he said. "We'll just have to wait
and see what the investigations come up
with."
Involved in the space program since the
19605, Ashley chaired one of 12 review com
mittees in 1979 and 1980 to review the de
sign, development and testing of various
components in the shuttle system.
The group Ashley chaired had responsi
bility for the shuttle's thermal protection sys
tems, designed to shield it during re-entry to
the earth's atmosphere.
Ashley said that the tiles have worked well
over the years. "When you consider the

number of flights, they've done pretty well,"
he said.
Pat6-Cornell and Fischbeck's initial re
port to NASA in 1990, and later papers in
1993 and 1994, found that problems with
some of the shuttle's tiles — specifically
those on the undersides of the wings close to
the fuselage and right under the crew com
partment — posed a greater risk to overall
safety than others.
The researchers concluded that 15 per
cent of the 25,000 tiles used on the shuttle
account for 85 percent of the overall risk to
the aircraft.
The researchers found that the number
of tiles damaged in each of the first 33 shut
tle flights ranged from a low of 53 to a high
of 707, with an average of 179. The re
searchers noted that every shuttle, upon re
turn, has had some debris-damaged tiles. At
the time the report was written, only two
tiles had been completely lost.
The original report recommended a
number of management and organiza
tional improvements for how NASA deals

with tiles. '»
These included improving the pay of
technicians responsible for the tiles to re
duce staff turnover, relieving the time pres
sures on tile workers, prioritizing the in
spection of tiles based on the risk they pose
to safety and identifying areas of insulation
that would affect the highest priority tiles.
In a 1994 report, the researchers con
cluded that NASA had implemented a num
ber of improvements to the way tiles were
maintained and repaired, and they encour
aged more use of risk analyses to identify the
most important risks to the shuttle.
"NASA must find new ways of being cost
effective because it simply cannot afford fi
nancially or politically to lose another or
biter," the report concluded.
Pate-Cornell has also been involved with
projects to quantify the risk of offshore plat
forms used during oil and gas production
and anesthesia during surgery.
She is also formerly a member of the
NASA Advisory Council and is currently an
elected member of the Faculty Senate.
