# PoliSci students and faculty split on dept. changes

### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Since the requirements for political science majors
were significantly restructured at the beginning of
fall quarter, students and faculty have been sharply
divided over the results. While faculty in the depart
ment said they believe the changes are a step in the
right direction by giving the major more rigor, many
students said they find themselves caught between
fulfilling prerequisites and pursuing their interests.
The most drastic change is the new emphasis
placed on introductory classes. Students majoring in
political science must now take three out of the de
partment's four introductory courses — choosing
among international relations, American politics, po
litical theory and comparative politics — a criterion
that has drawn pointed criticism from some students.
"It is extremely annoying to have to reconstruct
your entire 4-year plan to accommodate classes that
you personally have no interest in or would not have
taken under ordinary circumstances," said Josette
Langevine, a junior majoring in political science.
'Hie faculty members responsible for the changes
believe that concentration on introductory concepts
will streamline the major and provide students with a
more coherent path in planning their future schedules.
"[lntroductory courses] really ensure a founda
tion of knowledge on which to build," said Paul Sni
derman, chair of the Political Science Department.
"Without the experience of taking several intro
ductory courses, students majoring in, say, American
politics might be totally ignorant of major theories
and arguments in other sub-fields like comparative
politics or international relations," said Morris Fiori
na, a professor of political science who played a key

role in the requirement modifica
tion.
According to Fiorina, the
changes were prompted by the
University's effort to focus more
attention on undergraduate edu
cation. Stanford has recently been
criticized for not placing as much
emphasis on the undergraduate
experience as its Ivy League peers,
he said.
Sniderman expressed his
hope that the new introductory
core will foster a sense of unity
among political science majors
that could enrich their Stanford
experience.
"Introductory courses form a
cohort of people who start off to
gether," Sniderman said. "In fu
ture courses, they will have people
they know from previous classes,
and over the four years they will
hopefully develop a strong set of
ties within the political science
community here."
Some students expressed ap
preciation for the simplicity of the
new requirements.
"The new structure does make
it easier to map out a plan for com
pleting the requirements," said
sophomore Courtney Smith, "I
feel it's more helpful than restric
tive."
However, many students
voiced confusion and frustra
tion. Prospective political science
majors said they were worried
that the weight placed on intro
ductory courses will distract
them from exploring more ad
vanced studies.
"I think [introductory classes]
restrict students who want to from
taking more upper-division politi
cal science classes instead, which
can give them the breadth as well

as more depth," said Tracy
Williams, a junior majoring in po
litical science.
Still others objected to the
format of the introductory
courses themselves, stating that
they prefer the small-lecture at
mosphere of most advanced
classes.
"[lntroductory classes] are big,
impersonal and feel very high
school-like with group projects,
I-Hum-like sections and
quizzes," said one sophomore
who asked not to be identified.
"You would never think to ask a
question in class, and you have no
chance of getting to know a pro
fessor unless you take a good deal
of initiative."
The restructuring does not
affect students who have al
ready declared political science
as their major, and juniors who
were still undeclared at the be
ginning of autumn quarter will
also need to follow the old
guidelines.
"Students have mentioned
that they were not informed that
these changes were going to
occur and didn't know who it af
fected," said Angelita Mireles, the
department's undergraduate
program administrator, noting
that the department will finish in
forming all declared political sci
ence majors by the end of winter
quarter.
The requirement modification
remains a work in progress, ac
cording to Sniderman, who said
there are already meetings sched
uled to discuss further changes to
the curriculum.
"The program is now more
structured and more rigorous,"
said Michael McFaul, the depart
ment's director of undergraduate
studies. "In adding these compo
nents, we are seeking to attract the
best students to our major, not the
most students."
