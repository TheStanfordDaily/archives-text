Since the requirements for political science majors
were significantly restructured at the beginning of
fall quarter, students and faculty have been sharply
divided over the results. While faculty in the depart

right direction by giving the major more rigor, many
students said they find themselves caught between
fulfilling prerequisites and pursuing their interests.
The most drastic change is the new emphasis
placed on introductory classes. Students majoring in
political science must now take three out of the de
partment's four introductory courses — choosing
among international relations, American politics, po
litical theory and comparative politics — a criterion
that has drawn pointed criticism from some students.
"It is extremely annoying to have to reconstruct
your entire 4-year plan to accommodate classes that
you personally have no interest in or would not have
taken under ordinary circumstances," said Josette
Langevine, a junior majoring in political science.
'Hie faculty members responsible for the changes
believe that concentration on introductory concepts
will streamline the major and provide students with a
more coherent path in planning their future schedules.
"[lntroductory courses] really ensure a founda
tion of knowledge on which to build," said Paul Sni
derman, chair of the Political Science Department.
"Without the experience of taking several intro
ductory courses, students majoring in, say, American
politics might be totally ignorant of major theories
and arguments in other sub-fields like comparative
politics or international relations," said Morris Fiori
na, a professor of political science who played a key
