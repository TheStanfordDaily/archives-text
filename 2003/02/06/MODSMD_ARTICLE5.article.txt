# Advising sets tone for grad students
## 
### VAUHINI VARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jenn Schindel had barely com
pleted her undergraduate degree
when she entered Stanford's
School of Education. She had a
vague idea of what she hoped to ac
complish during her graduate
studies, so she chose an advisor with
research interests similar to her
own. But a year later, her academic
focus had evolved to match more
closely with another professor's
work.
Schindel made a decision that
seemed quite innocuous at the
time. She chose to switch advisors.
At first, everyone agreed: This
was a good idea for all involved. But
what seemed like a straightforward
decision ended up getting bogged
down in bureaucracy, miscommu
nications and foot-dragging. In the
end, it took a full year before the
switch was finalized.
Schindel's situation reflects the
politics often involved in graduate
student-advisor relationships at
Stanford — a relationship that
many see as the most important
connection in a graduate student's

career. They choose their advisors
during their first two years at Stan
ford and work with them for the
duration of their academic careers.
Though the extent of the relation
ship varies between departments,
many students work daily under
their advisor's supervision. For
some, the relationship lasts well
after the student has completed his
or her education.
"The advisor is the one you talk
to everyday, and it's really the per
son who can make you really happy
or really miserable," said cancer bi
ology student Kathleen Rubins, a
representative to the Committee on
Graduate Studies. "The advisor has

more control over the student than
anything else at Stanford."
Students often swap horror sto
ries about negative experiences:
There's the woman who ended up
transferring to an entirely different
department because of difficulties
with her advisor, the man whose
advisor refused to recognize his
work and the woman whose re
search funding was cut off by an
angry ex-advisor.
"There's this whole mentality
that Stanford rides on that we have
such mentorship, and it pats itself
on the back constantly — but Stan
ford hires faculty fora reason, and
the focus is not on what they can
offer the students, necessarily,"
Schindel said.
The horror stories only illus
trate extremes that advising re
lationships rarely reach, howev
er. The majority of graduate
students have comfortable,
long-term relationships with
their advisors, and some enjoy
very close personal connections.
Rubins said she has strong rela
tionships with both of her advi
sors. In fact, she noted, most
students do not experience
much more than minor dissatis
faction, often caused by miscom
munication.
Rubins estimated that only a very
small percentage of students end up
in difficult relationships. But Grace

Chang, chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, said she believes there
could be many more who are simply
afraid to speak up. Students in
volved in extreme cases are often
too afraid of reprisal to talk about
them in public, Chang said.
"In academia, it's a small
world — everybody knows every
body else," she said. "If you have a
falling out with your advisor, it can
possibly ruin your career. Not only
are the faculty further along in their
professions, but because they're at
Stanford, they are likely to be very
influential in their field."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Godfrey Mungal said he stresses
open communication when advis
ing students. He likes to develop
close relationships, so he limits him
self to fewer than five students at a
time. That way, he said "I can work
closer with the individual, get to
know them."
For Mungal, most conflicts
have arisen from miscommunica
tion or a lack of information about
issues in students' personal lives
that affect their work. He said that
when that happens, he initiates a
meeting.
Mungal recalled dealing with a
d'Aficult situation about 10 years
jgo, when he advised a student who
was "dangerous" in the laboratory.
"I thought he might hurt himself
or people around him," he said.
Mungal set up a meeting to dis
cuss the problem. They decided to
gether that it would be better for the
student to move on to more theo
retical, less lab-based work. In the

end, the student's thesis included
both his lab research and his non
lab studies.
The Stanford Graduate Student
Handbook includes a section on ad
vising, which encourages both advi
sors and students to communicate
about problems in their working re
lationships and to make compro
mises in dealing with problems.
However, according to Chang,
there is no way to make sure either
party adheres to the policies. Al
though the Ombuds Office offers to
mediate conflicts, it doesn't take
sides.
Chang and Rubins are work
ing with a small group of admin
istrators, faculty members and
fellow students to improve the
advising relationship. In the next
few weeks, they plan to circulate a
survey asking students about
their advising situation. In addi
tion, they hope to start using the
University's policy on student-ad
visor relationships as a contract
that both parties must sign and
begin holding sessions for faculty
members on interpersonal com
munication.
Those involved said they hope to
eventually improve communica
tion between students and advisors
and offer students a better system to
deal with conflicts.
"The rest of your life is affected
by [the advising relationship]," Ru
bins said. "If the relationship does
go really bad, that will have a huge
impact on the student — and it'll
probably have a huge impact on the
advisor, too."

very close personal connections.
Rubins said she has strong rela
tionships with both of her advi
sors. In fact, she noted, most
students do not experience
much more than minor dissatis
faction, often caused by miscom
munication.
Rubins estimated that only a very
small percentage of students end up
in difficult relationships. But Grace

Chang, chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, said she believes there
could be many more who are simply
afraid to speak up. Students in
volved in extreme cases are often
too afraid of reprisal to talk about
them in public, Chang said.
"In academia, it's a small
world — everybody knows every
body else," she said. "If you have a
falling out with your advisor, it can
possibly ruin your career. Not only
are the faculty further along in their
professions, but because they're at
Stanford, they are likely to be very
influential in their field."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Godfrey Mungal said he stresses
open communication when advis
ing students. He likes to develop
close relationships, so he limits him
self to fewer than five students at a
time. That way, he said "I can work
closer with the individual, get to
know them."
For Mungal, most conflicts
have arisen from miscommunica
tion or a lack of information about
issues in students' personal lives
that affect their work. He said that
when that happens, he initiates a
meeting.
Mungal recalled dealing with a
d'Aficult situation about 10 years
jgo, when he advised a student who
was "dangerous" in the laboratory.
"I thought he might hurt himself
or people around him," he said.
Mungal set up a meeting to dis
cuss the problem. They decided to
gether that it would be better for the
student to move on to more theo
retical, less lab-based work. In the

end, the student's thesis included
both his lab research and his non
lab studies.
The Stanford Graduate Student
Handbook includes a section on ad
vising, which encourages both advi
sors and students to communicate
about problems in their working re
lationships and to make compro
mises in dealing with problems.
However, according to Chang,
there is no way to make sure either
party adheres to the policies. Al
though the Ombuds Office offers to
mediate conflicts, it doesn't take
sides.
Chang and Rubins are work
ing with a small group of admin
istrators, faculty members and
fellow students to improve the
advising relationship. In the next
few weeks, they plan to circulate a
survey asking students about
their advising situation. In addi
tion, they hope to start using the
University's policy on student-ad
visor relationships as a contract
that both parties must sign and
begin holding sessions for faculty
members on interpersonal com
munication.
Those involved said they hope to
eventually improve communica
tion between students and advisors
and offer students a better system to
deal with conflicts.
"The rest of your life is affected
by [the advising relationship]," Ru
bins said. "If the relationship does
go really bad, that will have a huge
impact on the student — and it'll
probably have a huge impact on the
advisor, too."

Jenn Schindel had barely com
pleted her undergraduate degree
when she entered Stanford's
School of Education. She had a
vague idea of what she hoped to ac
complish during her graduate
studies, so she chose an advisor with
research interests similar to her
own. But a year later, her academic
focus had evolved to match more
closely with another professor's
work.
Schindel made a decision that
seemed quite innocuous at the
time. She chose to switch advisors.
At first, everyone agreed: This
was a good idea for all involved. But
what seemed like a straightforward
decision ended up getting bogged
down in bureaucracy, miscommu
nications and foot-dragging. In the
end, it took a full year before the
switch was finalized.
Schindel's situation reflects the
politics often involved in graduate
student-advisor relationships at
Stanford — a relationship that
many see as the most important
connection in a graduate student's

career. They choose their advisors
during their first two years at Stan
ford and work with them for the
duration of their academic careers.
Though the extent of the relation
ship varies between departments,
many students work daily under
their advisor's supervision. For
some, the relationship lasts well
after the student has completed his
or her education.
"The advisor is the one you talk
to everyday, and it's really the per
son who can make you really happy
or really miserable," said cancer bi
ology student Kathleen Rubins, a
representative to the Committee on
Graduate Studies. "The advisor has

more control over the student than
anything else at Stanford."
Students often swap horror sto
ries about negative experiences:
There's the woman who ended up
transferring to an entirely different
department because of difficulties
with her advisor, the man whose
advisor refused to recognize his
work and the woman whose re
search funding was cut off by an
angry ex-advisor.
"There's this whole mentality
that Stanford rides on that we have
such mentorship, and it pats itself
on the back constantly — but Stan
ford hires faculty fora reason, and
the focus is not on what they can
offer the students, necessarily,"
Schindel said.
The horror stories only illus
trate extremes that advising re
lationships rarely reach, howev
er. The majority of graduate
students have comfortable,
long-term relationships with
their advisors, and some enjoy
very close personal connections.
Rubins said she has strong rela
tionships with both of her advi
sors. In fact, she noted, most
students do not experience
much more than minor dissatis
faction, often caused by miscom
munication.
