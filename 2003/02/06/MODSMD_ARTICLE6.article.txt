As the University's final Latin Ameri
can studies majors near graduation and
as Overseas Studies plans to close its
Puebla and Buenos Aires programs,
other departments — History in partic
ular — are bolstering their faculty with
Latin American experts to ensure that
Stanford maintains its scholarship in the
discipline.
Faculty and staff associated with the
Center for Latin American Studies are
confident that the new faculty members
will strengthen the center's programs
and are optimistic about the revival of
the Latin American Studies major, which

was cut last winter.
"There is a search in the History De
partment fora senior Latin Americanist
being conducted literally right now,"
said Molly Vitorte, the center's associate
director.
The department also recently hired
Asst. History Prof. Zephyr Frank, who
joined the department this September
after teaching Latin American history at
Illinois State University last year. His re
search focuses on the political economy
of the Brazilian frontier.
Frank is already taking on an active
role at the center.
"Since arriving, I've served on ad
missions and nomination committees
for external fellows from Latin Ameri

ca," he said. "I've been involved with
the Bolivar House to a certain extent so
far, and I'm eager to see what's ahead
of us."
Frank said he has also been involved
in the selection of the new Latin Ameri
canist who will be joining the History De
partment soon.
According to History Department
Chair Carolyn Lougee Chappell, three
professors — from the University of
Chicago, Princeton University and the
State University of New York at
Buffalo — are currendy being consid
ered for the tenured position. The new
professor will specialize in colonial Latin
American history.
Vitorte said that new faculty additions

will provide benefits for students inter
ested in Latin American Studies "in
everything from advising, overseeing
their theses, participating in the center's
events and giving talks and lectures to
the most obvious benefit of giving stu
dents the opportunity to take their
courses."
Currendy, the center offers an honors
program and a minor in Latin .American
Studies for undergraduate students. In
2001, the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies voted to cancel the bachelor's
program and the Committee on Gradu
ate Studies canceled the master's pro
gram due to a perceived lack of faculty
