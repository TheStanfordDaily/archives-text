# Commission on Title IX proposes modest changes
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Bush administration's Commission on Op
portunity in Athletics, headed by University Athlet
ic Director Ted Leland, laid out suggestions for re
vising Tide IX compliance at its final meeting last
Thursday that, if adopted, would change the way
schools nationwide — including Stanford — run
their athletic programs.
In a set of proposals that some critics of cur
rent Title IX enforcement have decried as too
modest and supporters of the status quo have
deemed excessive, the commission called for
changes in how schools could demonstrate com
pliance with the law and in how they count the
number of athletes on a team when calculating
scholarships.
As the law is currently enforced, schools can
demonstrate compliance with Title IX, a 1972 law
that mandates gender equity in athletics at educa
tional institutions, in three different ways. Schools
can either have opportunities for women to play
on team sports proportionally equal to the overall
gender distribution of the student body, show
yearly gains toward achieving increased equity or
prove that they are satisfying on-campus female
sports interest.
According to The New York Times, the commis
sion proposed that schools be allowed to prove legal
compliance for the first two meth
ods through on-campus surveys.
Currently, schools only can poll
students to demonstrate compli
ance with the third option.
The committee also suggested
that schools be able to count the
number of available spaces on
sports teams, not just the specific
number of athletes on a team's ros
ter, to demonstrate compliance
with Title IX.
Both those for and against the
current state of Title IX found
shortcomings in the committee's
suggested revisions.
"We are deeply troubled by the
commission's action," Jocelyn
Samuels, vice president of the Na
tional Women's Law Center, told
The Washington Post. "This au
thorizes the Secretary of Educa
tion to radically restructure cur
rent practices. The proposals rec
ommended are every bit as dam
aging as any that have been put on
the table."
However, National Wrestling
Coaches Association Executive Di
rector Michael Moyer told The
New York Times that the sugges
tions were "a great first step [that
would] certainly stem [the] further
loss of programs."
The commission also consid
ered a change that would have
modified the proportionality re
quirement from reflecting the
overall college enrollment distri
bution to a 50 / 50 scheme. This
would lessen the required num

ber of scholarships for women in
sports, since women currently
comprise the majority of college
students at 56 percent. The pro
posal did not pass due to a 7-7
vote tie.
Sentiments regarding the com
mittee's Title IX have been no less
divided at Stanford than in the na
tion-wide debate over how to
achieve gender fairness.
Junior Vicky Chiang, a member
of the women's rugby team, one of
Stanford's club teams, said, "I am
concerned about the 50 / 50 break
down." She added, "I see a lot of
opportunities for the 50 / 50
breakdown to be misapplied.
"I know Stanford is a place
where the female population is
greater," she continued. "If it is a
set number, that leaves less room
for potential situations that might
come, such as the school's demo
graphics changing in the future. I
think if you are looking for equali
ty, you have to do it by representa
tion based on proportion at the
school."
Taylor Ahlgren, a senior on the
men's soccer team, explained what
he saw as the shortcomings of re
strictions due to current Title IX
enforcement.
"Football has an extremely
high budget which has to be
matched percentage-wise by
women's sports," Ahlgren said.
"This turns into an opportunity
for women's sports in any particu
lar school. Because there are not
90 players on a woman's football
team, this leads to an inequity for
the rest of men's sports against all
women's sports."
Ahlgren said that other athletes

he had talked to at Stanford
shared his sentiments, especially
those on smaller teams.
"Men's wrestling, lacrosse,
swimming — all across the board,
the smaller programs are not
matched as well financially as the
women's sports are," he said.
"At Stanford you have a
women's lacrosse team that is var
sity, while there is only a club
lacrosse team for men," Ahlgren
continued. "You might see equal
funding between men and
women, but you might see specific
teams that have varsity for women
but not for men."
Philippe Farner, head coach for
the women's rugby team, ex
plained that Title IX provisions
could aid his sport in becoming
varsity-level at Stanford.
"There are rumors that the
women's rugby might become
varsity," Farner said. "Women's
rugby has been declared an
emerging sport for the NCAA,
which means that they are
studying women's rugby to see if
it could become a good candi
date to become varsity at college
level.
"In rugby, usually you need a
squad of 35," Farner continued. "I
just know that because of the num
bers you need in rugby, rugby
would help to get those equal op
portunities if the proportions
change."
The commission planned to
submit its findings to Education
Secretary Rod Paige.
"We've got to move forward,"
Leland said to The New York
Times. "All we are is the first shot
out of the cannon."
