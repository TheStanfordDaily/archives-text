## State may borrow up to $8 billion by June 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — State
Controller Steve Wesley said yes
terday that California will proba
bly have to borrow $2 billion to $8
billion bef ore the end of June to
deal with cash flow problems
brought on by its budget woes.
Meanwhile, state Treasurer
Phil Angelides said he "wouldn't
be surprised" if one of the major
New York credit rating firms
downgraded California's credit
worthiness next week, a step that
could force the state to pay more in
interest when it borrows.
"It's going to be a tough year,"
Angelides said after meetings in
New York with representatives of
two of the firms — Standard &
Poor's and Moody's Investors Ser
vice. "Our job is going to be to
maintain our ratings. I think that's
going to be particularly tough to
do in Moody's case."
Westly said the amount the
state will need to borrow will de
pend on the size of budget cuts
made by Legislature before the
end of the current fiscal year on
June 30.
"If lawmakers move quickly we
can limit the cost of borrowing," he
said. "We have had some signs of
progress, but compromise will be
the key to our success."
The state has had to engage in
end-of-the-fiscal-year borrowing
six times in the last 15 years by is
suing so-called revenue anticipa
tion warrants, including 2002

when it faced a $23.6 billion deficit
and had to borrow $7.5 billion.
This year the Legislature and
Gov. Gray Davis are grappling
with a budget deficit that the De
partment of Finance projects to be
$34.6 billion and the legislative an
alyst says is $26.1 billion over the
next 17 months.
Lawmakers have approved an
initial package of about $8.6 bil
lion in budget cuts and funding
shifts, but that legislation is tied to
enactment of a bill designed to
trigger a vehicle license fee in
crease. Davis said Tuesday he
would veto that measure.
Angelides said he and Finance
Director Steve Peace told the cred
it rating firms that despite Davis'
announcement the Legislature
and governor were making
progress in dealing with the state's
budget problems.
"We were able to convey to
them that there are disagreements
on tactics and policy (but) there is
forward progress being made,"
Angelides said. "That's reflected in
the fact that in the Legislature and
the administration are working to
ward midyear reductions. Other
than last year this is one of the ear
liest starts on the budget."
Despite those assurances, he
said he "wouldn't be surprised" if
Moody's downgraded its Califor
nia credit ratings before the state
sells $900 million in bonds next
Thursday.
