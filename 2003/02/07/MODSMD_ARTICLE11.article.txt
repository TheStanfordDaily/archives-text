WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
Dozens of big companies are
backing the University of Michi
gan and its affirmative action
policy before the Supreme
Court, saying such programs
help produce better workers of
all ethnic backgrounds.
The University of Michigan
case is the most significant affir
mative action case to reach the
court in decades. At issue is
whether racial preference pro
grams unconstitutionally discrim
ination against white students.
Microsoft, Intel, American
Airlines, Proctor & Gamble,
Eastman Kodak and PepsiCo
are among more than 40 For
tune 500 companies siding with
the University of Michigan.
"If you're going to be a glob
al company and you're going to
attract and retain the best peo

pie, then the mirror you have to
present is that you're a very di
verse company," said James
Hackett, CEO of Steelcase
Corp., the top-selling office fur
niture company in the world.
Other corporations say
racially and ethnically mixed
workers help sell products at
home and abroad, and that
whites entering a diverse work
ing world benefit from time
spent in the classroom with stu
dents of other races.
"It makes all the business
sense in the world. We sell vehi
cles in every corner of the
globe," and want employees
who look like and understand
other cultures, said Edd Snyder,
spokesman for General Motors.
"Where do you get that employ
ee base? From universities and
colleges."
