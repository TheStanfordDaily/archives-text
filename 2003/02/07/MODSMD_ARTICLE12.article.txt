# 'The game is over,' Bush tells Iraq
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In the face of stiff op
position from allies, President George W. Bush
declared yesterday"the game is over" for Sad
dam Hussein and urged the United Nations to
join in disarming Iraq.
"Saddam Hussein will be stopped," Bush
said.
The president said he would be open to a
second U.N. resolution on disarmament, fol
lowing up one approved last November, but
only if it led to prompt action.
"The Security Council must not back down
when those demands are defied and mocked by
a dictator," Bush said. If the U.N. fails to act,
"The United States, along with a growing coali
tion of nations, is resolved to take whatever ac
tion is necessary to defend ourselves and dis
arm the Iraqi regime," he said.
Aides said the next few days would be dedi
cated to turning up pressure on reluctant allies
such as France and Germany as well as other
U.N. members.
Bush was silent on a timetable.
Earlier in the day, Powell stuck to the phrase
the administration has been using concerning a
final decision on possible war — "weeks, not
months" — but White House officials noted
that Bush was no longer saying consultations

would last that long.
"Saddam Hussein was given a final chance,
he is throwing that chance away. The dictator of
Iraq is making his choice," Bush said.
He spoke after meeting with Powell to dis
cuss efforts to win U.N. approval of a resolution
specifically authorizing use of force. Powell,
who laid out the U.S. case to the U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday, told lawmakers yester
day that the Iraqi situation would be brought to
a conclusion "one way or another" in a matter
of weeks.
Sticking largely to the case outlined by Pow
ell on Wednesday, Bush said there is no doubt
Saddam is not complying with the earlier U.N.
order to disarm.
"Saddam Hussein recently authorized Iraqi
field commanders to use chemical weapons, the
very weapons the dictator tells the world he
does not have," Bush said.
"Saddam Hussein has the motive and the
means and the recklessness and the hatred to
threaten the American people. Saddam Hus
sein has to be stopped," Bush said.
He suggested anew that there is a link be
tween Saddam and the terrorist group al-
Qaida.
"The same terrorist network operating out

of Iraq is responsible for the murder — the re
cent murder — of an American diplomat,
Lawrence Foley," Bush said. Foley, a U.S.
Agency for International Development official,
was killed last November outside his home in
Amman, Jordan.
Foreign ministers responded mostly with
calls for more weapons inspections after
Powell's U.N. presentation, in which he as
serted that Iraq was shifting and hiding
weapons and missile programs from the cur
rent inspectors.
Powell told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that most of the statements read by
foreign ministers after his speech had been pre
pared beforehand. He said he detected a shift
in attitude when he talked to 13 of the ministers
in private afterward.
Still, President Jacques Chirac said yesterday
France's position on war with Iraq was un
changed by Powell's presentation.
"We refuse to think that war is inevitable,"
Chirac said.
Powell told the senators Bush would wel
come a second resolution and "many members
of the Council would not only welcome it, some
of them would say we require one for partici
pation in whatever might come."

Downstream from Diyarbakir, near the border town of Silopi, a tent city for possible Iraqi refugees has been built along the river. The Turkish Red Crescent
Society expects some 300,000 refugees to cross the rugged mountains and seek refuge in the camp if a war breaks out.
