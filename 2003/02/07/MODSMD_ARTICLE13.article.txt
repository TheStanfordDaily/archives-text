## The 						merits of Title IX 
### 
A Department of Education panel
co-chaired by Stanford Athletic-
Director Ted Leland re-evaluated
Tide IX last week and issued its
recommendadons in a report that will be
delivered to Education Secretary Rod
Paige. Citing a need to strengthen and clar
ify Tide IX, the panel suggested several al
terations to the law, including a change in
compliance standards. However, we believe
that I ide IX should not be changed.
Enacted in 1972, Tide IX prohibits sex
discrimination in any educational program
or activity within schools receiving federal
financial assistance. As applied to intercolle
giate athletics, Tide IX requires an equi
table distribution of opportunities and re
sources among male

and female athletes.
One of the cur
rent standards for
compliance is that a
school's athletic op
portunities be made
available according
to the proportion of
male to female stu
dents attending that
school. Some have

claimed that this standard specifically has
caused certain non-revenue-producing
male sports, such as men's wrestling, to be
come underfunded and often terminated.
We believe that Tide IX is a historic suc
cess in American higher education primar
ily because it offers equal access to educa
tional opportunities to both female and
male athletes. Changes to the law could
abate the progress that female student ath
letes and athletic programs have obtained
over the last 30 years.
A change to Tide IX could affect many
of the female athletes who attend Stanford
on athletic scholarships; if the current pro
posal are adopted, up to $122 million in
annual scholarship money for female col
lege athletes could be cut. Without ride
IX, many of the female athletic programs
currently in existence would likely have
been eliminated in order to provide more
resources for revenue-producing sports.
Historically, athledc departments have
been exempted from standards of diversity
that are enjoined to most American institu
tions, including university campuses. Tide
IX has proven to be one of the few legal
means that restrain athledc departments
from unbounded license — this law en

ties.
We also believe that Tide IX has proven
not only to benefit female athletes but also
the insdtudons that they attend. Typically,
intercollegiate female athletes have higher
SAT scores, graduadon rates and grade
point averages than male athletes and gen
erally exhibit the same level of classroom
performance as their non-athlete academ
ic peers. Taking into considering the high
level of academic performance exhibited
by female student athletes, Tide IX ensures
a well-balanced learning environment.
Cridcs of the current proportionality
standard under the compliance specifica
dons favor a system where compliance
would be judged according to individual

school athletic interest,
which would be mea
sured by surveys. But
the guidelines for such
surveys have yet to be
determined. We worry
that, if left vague, com
pliance tests could be
easily manipulated by
athletic departments to
support revenue-pro
ducing sports.

College athletics have changed vasdy
over the last 30 years because of Tide IX.
However, women athletes should not be
made vicdms of their own successes. The so
cial condiuons that necessitated die law
were clear in 1972; yet the success of
women's collegiate athledcs has made those
condiuons less percepuble, leading some to
conclude that the law itself needs to be
amended.
Ted Leland has articulated the panel's
task as one to "strengthen [Tide IX] and
make it fair." We believe that as a represen
tative of an elite athledc program within an
elite school, Leland ought to affirm his
words in his deeds; the new law should as
sure that future female athletes will contin
ue to participate in the successes Tide IX
has achieved. Athledc departments have no
preeminent right to tamper with laws or
manipulate processes designed to assure
compliance to the law. We believe that the
standards of accountability and disclosure
that are applied to athletic departments
need to be clarified and strengthened—
not the law itself. Tide IX should not be
changed to accommodate the recondite af
fairs of athletic departments or the means
by which they further exempt themselves
from the standards to which the rest of the
world is bound.
