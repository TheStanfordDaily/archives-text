# THE 						WAY I SEE IT
## Our social responsibilities 
### 
This is my last column
(sob), and for that reason
I have been giving seri
ous thought to what I
will say this time. Writing this col
umn has been a wonderful experi
ence for me. In particular, I want
to thank all the people who re
sponded to "White People Think,"
and I am serious about holding
conversations the way I said I
wanted to. When I have the time
and clarity of mind (i.e. sometime
after midterms) I will really make
efforts to facilitate such dialogues.
However, I am not the only person
interested in engaging in this type
of constructive discussion — I've
received lots of feedback on the
matter, and there seems to be a
large interest on campus. People
should start talking — in the
dorms, in the classrooms, the din
ing halls, wherever. Don't wait for
someone to arrange an event, start
talking now.
So anyway, in thinking about
what to write about today, I tried
to figure out what is the most im
portant thing to me, what is the
one thing I definitely have to say.
Luckily, it came to me on Sunday.
I went to a meeting called by a very
good friend of mine, a beautiful
woman from Botswana who is or
ganizing to fight against HIV and
AIDS in America and in South
Africa. She reminded me that the
reason I came to Stanford in the
first place was to try to understand
this virus that, for some reason,
seems to be so perfectly suited to
decimating the population of my
country and its neighbors. That is
why I bothered to put myself on a

plane and move halfway around
the world with no family and no
idea what I was getting myself into.
What I did know was that there
was a chance that I could use my
education to do something, how
ever small, to make things a little
better in my home.
For those who haven't seen the
statistics, South Africa's HIV infec
tion rate is currently estimated at

about 25 per
cent. In
Botswana,
which has the
strongest cur
rency and
fastest growing
economy on the
continent, one
third of its adult

population is currently infected
with HIV. That's 33 percent. Can
you imagine? One in three.
AIDS is everywhere. It touches
every single life in my country, and
you cannot ignore it. It is the rea
son people now find weekends
consumed with funerals. Even the
curricula in the schools have had
to change to accommodate to the
fact that many students have par
ents who are infected or that they
are infected with the disease them
selves. They need to be educated
to cope with a whole different kind
of life experience. These are
young kids who have to carry the
burden of this disease, either be
cause they have been orphaned or
because they themselves will soon
surely die.
Millions of people in my coun
try will soon surely die.
The thing about AIDS is that it

is theoretically 100 percent pre
ventable. Unfortunately, in the
context in which this pandemic has
spread and continues to spread,
this is easier said than done. AIDS
is preventable if you have a reason
and a way to prevent it.
And that is the problem. Not ev
eryone has a reason, and not ev
eryone has a way.
First, the reason. Now, you
would think that every person in
the world would want to prolong
his or her life. Here in the first
world, given the quality of life and
the ostensible range of opportuni
ties available to you, of course you
would want to live a long life, fulfill
your potential and experience all
the wonderful things the future
can offer. Well, imagine you lived
in a totally different context. Imag
ine you didn't have running water,
access to basic sanitation or, let
alone, electricity. Imagine your
home was a one-roomed shack
that you shared with eight other
people. What if you never really
had enough to eat and thoughts of
getting an education, buying a
house or even owning a car were
nothing more than a faraway
dream to you. For as long as you
can remember this has been your
life, and you don't realistically see
it changing anytime soon.
And then someone told you to
use a condom so that you wouldn't
get HIV.
What you had heard about
HIV was that everyone around
you had it, that you would proba-


Eleanor Williams
bly get it and that once you had it
you probably wouldn't even know
fora good while, until suddenly
you became really sick and just
didn't get better. Imagine this
kind of fatalistic messaging sur
rounding you all the time. It isn't
too hard to understand why some
people have just lost all hope that
they can escape infection and
don't see why they should be
thinking about using condoms.
Half the time they can't even af
ford the bus fare to get to the clin
ic to pick them up. It's a question
of survival — of prioritizing what
you need to do so that you live
through today.
And then there are those who
don't seem to have a choice. Sexu
al abuse and rape are rife in my

home country. So many little girls
are abused and molested that in
some communities it is accepted as
the norm. Many of these girls are
infected in this way — they lose
their innocence and their lives in
one fatal stroke.
It is sad. It is so very sad to me
because when I walk around at
home all I see is the paradox of the
"third world" existence — how
people who have nothing can re
tain their hope, their dignity and
their compassion. I have never
seen such testament to the
strength of the human character as
I have seen at home. I have never
been so inspired by the capacity to
survive when you seemingly have
nothing to live on and nothing to
live for. We know what causes
AIDS, we know that condoms can
prevent it, we've seen what it looks
like when you're dying of this dis
ease and, believe it or not, we know
what we need to make it better in
the country. But we simply don't

have the resources
People in South Africa are still
happy, still kind, still generous and
still hospitable, so I don't want you
to feel sorry for us. We don't want
your pity. We want your respect.
We want your compassion. We
want you to think of us as just the
same as you but in a different situ
ation. So don't judge us, because
your communities have their
problems too. I am writing about
this because I have committed my
self to doing all I can so that I know
that I tried to make it better in
whatever way I could.
My point is that we all have a re
sponsibility to look critically at the
less-than-ideal situations around
us that we could contribute to.
Sometimes all that means is talking
to a high school student and telling
her she can make it into college. So
what are you going to do?

eryone has a way.
First, the reason. Now, you
would think that every person in
the world would want to prolong
his or her life. Here in the first
world, given the quality of life and
the ostensible range of opportuni
ties available to you, of course you
would want to live a long life, fulfill
your potential and experience all
the wonderful things the future
can offer. Well, imagine you lived
in a totally different context. Imag
ine you didn't have running water,
access to basic sanitation or, let
alone, electricity. Imagine your
home was a one-roomed shack
that you shared with eight other
people. What if you never really
had enough to eat and thoughts of
getting an education, buying a
house or even owning a car were
nothing more than a faraway
dream to you. For as long as you
can remember this has been your
life, and you don't realistically see
it changing anytime soon.
And then someone told you to
use a condom so that you wouldn't
get HIV.
What you had heard about
HIV was that everyone around
you had it, that you would proba-


Eleanor Williams
bly get it and that once you had it
you probably wouldn't even know
fora good while, until suddenly
you became really sick and just
didn't get better. Imagine this
kind of fatalistic messaging sur
rounding you all the time. It isn't
too hard to understand why some
people have just lost all hope that
they can escape infection and
don't see why they should be
thinking about using condoms.
Half the time they can't even af
ford the bus fare to get to the clin
ic to pick them up. It's a question
of survival — of prioritizing what
you need to do so that you live
through today.
And then there are those who
don't seem to have a choice. Sexu
al abuse and rape are rife in my

home country. So many little girls
are abused and molested that in
some communities it is accepted as
the norm. Many of these girls are
infected in this way — they lose
their innocence and their lives in
one fatal stroke.
It is sad. It is so very sad to me
because when I walk around at
home all I see is the paradox of the
"third world" existence — how
people who have nothing can re
tain their hope, their dignity and
their compassion. I have never
seen such testament to the
strength of the human character as
I have seen at home. I have never
been so inspired by the capacity to
survive when you seemingly have
nothing to live on and nothing to
live for. We know what causes
AIDS, we know that condoms can
prevent it, we've seen what it looks
like when you're dying of this dis
ease and, believe it or not, we know
what we need to make it better in
the country. But we simply don't

have the resources
People in South Africa are still
happy, still kind, still generous and
still hospitable, so I don't want you
to feel sorry for us. We don't want
your pity. We want your respect.
We want your compassion. We
want you to think of us as just the
same as you but in a different situ
ation. So don't judge us, because
your communities have their
problems too. I am writing about
this because I have committed my
self to doing all I can so that I know
that I tried to make it better in
whatever way I could.
My point is that we all have a re
sponsibility to look critically at the
less-than-ideal situations around
us that we could contribute to.
Sometimes all that means is talking
to a high school student and telling
her she can make it into college. So
what are you going to do?

This is my last column
(sob), and for that reason
I have been giving seri
ous thought to what I
will say this time. Writing this col
umn has been a wonderful experi
ence for me. In particular, I want
to thank all the people who re
sponded to "White People Think,"
and I am serious about holding
conversations the way I said I
wanted to. When I have the time
and clarity of mind (i.e. sometime
after midterms) I will really make
efforts to facilitate such dialogues.
However, I am not the only person
interested in engaging in this type
of constructive discussion — I've
received lots of feedback on the
matter, and there seems to be a
large interest on campus. People
should start talking — in the
dorms, in the classrooms, the din
ing halls, wherever. Don't wait for
someone to arrange an event, start
talking now.
So anyway, in thinking about
what to write about today, I tried
to figure out what is the most im
portant thing to me, what is the
one thing I definitely have to say.
Luckily, it came to me on Sunday.
I went to a meeting called by a very
good friend of mine, a beautiful
woman from Botswana who is or
ganizing to fight against HIV and
AIDS in America and in South
Africa. She reminded me that the
reason I came to Stanford in the
first place was to try to understand
this virus that, for some reason,
seems to be so perfectly suited to
decimating the population of my
country and its neighbors. That is
why I bothered to put myself on a

plane and move halfway around
the world with no family and no
idea what I was getting myself into.
What I did know was that there
was a chance that I could use my
education to do something, how
ever small, to make things a little
better in my home.
For those who haven't seen the
statistics, South Africa's HIV infec
tion rate is currently estimated at

about 25 per
cent. In
Botswana,
which has the
strongest cur
rency and
fastest growing
economy on the
continent, one
third of its adult

population is currently infected
with HIV. That's 33 percent. Can
you imagine? One in three.
AIDS is everywhere. It touches
every single life in my country, and
you cannot ignore it. It is the rea
son people now find weekends
consumed with funerals. Even the
curricula in the schools have had
to change to accommodate to the
fact that many students have par
ents who are infected or that they
are infected with the disease them
selves. They need to be educated
to cope with a whole different kind
of life experience. These are
young kids who have to carry the
burden of this disease, either be
cause they have been orphaned or
because they themselves will soon
surely die.
Millions of people in my coun
try will soon surely die.
The thing about AIDS is that it

is theoretically 100 percent pre
ventable. Unfortunately, in the
context in which this pandemic has
spread and continues to spread,
this is easier said than done. AIDS
is preventable if you have a reason
and a way to prevent it.
And that is the problem. Not ev
eryone has a reason, and not ev
eryone has a way.
First, the reason. Now, you

his or her life. Here in the first
