Cancellation of OSP programs
a great 'loss'
I am writing to express disappointment
that Overseas Studies has chosen to dis
continue the Stanford programs in
Buenos Aires and Puebla. During my ju
nior year, I chose to study abroad with a
non-Stanford program in Santiago, Chile,
because I was specifically interested in
Chile, but felt that the Stanford program
was too insular and restrictive. The pro
gram that I went on allowed me to enroll
directly in the local university, as the
Buenos Aires and Puebla programs would
have had I chosen to study in Argentina or
Mexico. I was not alone in the desire for
a less structured, less mediated program
in Chile — out of the eight students on my
program, two others were from Stanford
as well.
The language requirements fora total
immersion program are necessarily more
stringent than those fora program whose
classes are given in English. But the re
wards are correspondingly greater. The
OSP program in Santiago is very valuable
in that it allows students with compara
tively little knowledge of Spanish to take

classes in a Latin American country. How
ever, we should not believe that this is the
only goal to which an overseas studies pro
gram should aspire. An immersion pro
gram gives the opportunity to explore all
of a local culture, not just the part that
finds its way into an English-speaking
classroom, and the experience of meeting
local students unvetted by mentoring pro
grams is also immensely important.
The Buenos Aires and Puebla pro
grams served a more limited constituency
than the Santiago program does, but they
still fulfill a valuable purpose. With their
loss, Stanford students will be forced to
give up transferable financial aid and
credit fora deeper, more immersive expe
rience in Spanish-speaking countries.

McDonald's case exhibits
value of tort system
I read Craig Albrecht's column, "Mc-
Donald's and Civil Society" (Feb. 6) and
wanted to point out that even though the
class-action lawsuit against McDonald's
has been dismissed for about two weeks —
and while the dismissal was due to an in
sufficient complaint — the judge did say

in his dismissal that he was extremely
doubtful that such a class action could suc
ceed, even with amendments.
Furthermore, it's worth pointing out
that class-action lawsuits like this one are
an extremely valuable part of the modern
regulatory system. Where legislation has
lagged behind, litigation of this sort has al
lowed those with legitimate injuries to
make important changes — for instance,
many workers who were injured as a result
of working with asbestos found their only
recourse in precisely this sort of class-ac
tion lawsuits. The classic example is, of
course, the tobacco cases, which led to a
voluntary settlement wherein the tobacco
industry finances advertisements to ex
plain the dangers of smoking. The tort sys
tem certainly has its flaws but they a small
price to pay for the ability of ordinary citi
zens to have their injuries recognized and
remedied.

Bikers should 'follow the rules'
I agree with Alex Ene who, in his letter
"Cracking down on student bikers" (Feb.
5), said that ticketing campus bikers is an
inefficient use of police resources. Clearly,
it would be much more efficient for the po

lice to shoot them. A decent marksman or
markswoman should be able to gun down
three or four law-breaking bikers in the
time it takes to write one ticket. Moreover,
after an initial learning period it probably
would only be necessary to shoot one or
two bikers a week to keep them in line —
assuming they are observant enough to
notice what is going on, which may be a
questionable assumption.
Seriously, folks, beyond the rudeness
and lack of consideration evident in their
behavior, scofflaw bikers are a danger to
themselves and others. The number of re
ported accidents vastly understates the
number of mild collisions, near misses and
panic stops that occur each week. Espe
cially in the winter when the evenings are
dark and sometimes rainy, driver visibility
is terrible. A week rarely goes by when I
don't have to brake to avoid hitting a biker
in dark clothing, without a light or a re
flector, barreling through a stop sign. We
can't see you nearly as well as you think we
can. I love Stanford students and I'd hate
to carry the memory of squashing one for
the rest of my life.
I too wish that I could decide on a case
by-case basis which regulations apply to
me and which don't, and when I should
obey the law and when I can blow it oft, but
everyone is worse off when we exercise
that degree of freedom, which is why we

have laws and regulations in the first place.
If, on reflection, campus bikers think the
rules are unreasonable, they should work
to change them. Otherwise, follow the
rules.

Columbia crew "inspires the human spirit 7
After reading Ronald Hilton's letter en
titled "Modern space travel 'foolish' "
(Feb. 4), I was completely astounded and
taken aback by his extremely negative
point of view.
It's very clever of him to use analogies
from Greek legends, but, in all honesty, he
sounds as if he really has little understand
ing of the space program.
He argues that "scientific experiments
can be carried out in unmanned space
craft," but the truth is that while there is
much research that can be done this way,
current computers and robotics are far in
ferior to human beings. We have the
adaptability to be able to perform far bet
ter than even the most expensive robots
thus built and, as a result, space science
benefits massively. For example, without
