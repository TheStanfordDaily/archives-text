## UO Ducks paddle over Stanford men 
### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
EUGENE — From the 50-foot sign
draped down the side of McArthur
Court which boldly read, "Home
court Advantage," to the 50 or so
students who showed up outside of
the arena two and a half hours be
fore game time so that they could
get in an extra 15 seconds of trash
talk as Stanford exited the court, it
was clear from the very beginning
that the game-time atmosphere was
going to come into play.

Men's Basketball
Last night: Stanford 79, Oregon 64
at Oregon St., Saturday, 12:30 p.m.

That it would affect the Cardinal
this much was surprising.
A month ago, at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford put forth its best perfor
mance to date in its 24-point dis
manding of the Ducks.
Oh, what a difference a venue
makes.
This was the only show in town
and Oregon didn't displease its au
dience as it defeated No. 25 Stan
ford 79-64 in front of an energetic,
capacity crowd in Eugene.
"I'm sure [we] had no notion
that Oregon was going to come out
with that kind of energy," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery
said.
The game got off to a slow start
offensively speaking. The teams
traded baskets until the 12-minute
mark. After sophomore center Rob
Litde found sophomore swingman
Josh Childress for an alley-oop
slam, junior Andre Joseph hit a
long three-pointer, breaking the
10-10 tie, bringing the crowd to its

feet and setting Oregon's offensive
game into motion.
The Ducks then went on a 14-6
run, extending their lead to 11
points with six minutes left to play
in the half.
The two biggest story lines of the
first half concerned the Oregon
bench. Junior point guard and
leading scorer Luke Ridnour was
whisded for two fouls in the open
ing two minutes of the game, forc
ing Oregon head coach Ernie Kent
to sit him down for the remainder
of the half.
The Ducks, however, didn't
seem to miss his presence all that
much.
In relief of Ridnour, Joseph
came in and produced offensively.
He scored 14 first-half points,
shooting 50 percent from the field
and going 4-for-6 from behind the
arch. Joseph, whose surprising
shooting performance accounted
for almost 40 percent of Oregon's
first-half points, was the primary
reason that the Ducks went into the
locker room up by nine, 36-27.
Stanford's inability to shoot the
ball and Oregon's persistence on
the boards, however, aided in the
cause. The Cardinal went 2-for-7
from behind the arch and shot just
over 30 percent from the field,
while the Ducks grabbed five more
rebounds than the Cardinal in the
opening 20 minutes.
"In the first half, we had a lot of
layups, a lot of point-blank looks
that we just missed," said a disap
pointed Montgomery. "We got
hurt inside by [Robert] Johnson
who rebounded the ball well and
got second [chance] opportunities
for them."
Ridnour made up for the 18

minutes he missed during the first
half in a hurry during the next sec
ond period. Ridnour came out of
the locker room on fire — picking
up where Joseph earlier left off.
He scored six quick points in the
second halfs opening three min
utes. More importantly though,

when Stanford went on an early 10-
2 run which brought the Cardinal
as close as two, Ridnour hit 11
straight points, including three
buckets from beyond the arch, in
two minutes to extend Oregon's

last night. The Ducks outscored the Cardinal by 15 to avenge their loss at
Maples earlier this season.
lead back to seven.
"We know that when [Ridnour's]
on the bench he's mad and when
he's mad he plays at a whole differ
ent level," said Johnson who
grabbed a season-high 11 rebounds
for Oregon.
"He came out in the second half
and he was gonna score the ball,"
added Montgomery. "You could see
that [in his eyes.]"
For the Cardinal, offensive pro
duction was the biggest issue. Senior
point guard Julius Barnes led the
team with 17 points and Childress
added 15 but no one else saw dou
ble-figures in the 15-point loss.
"Collectively we were not as
tough as we've been in the past,"
Montgomery said. "We didn't do a
good job of finding each other on
the offensive end."
Stanford will get the opportunity
to attempt to salvage at least one
game from this trip to Oregon on
Sunday as it takes on Oregon State
in Corvallis.
Tip-off is set for 12:30 p.m. and
the game can be seen on Fox Sports
Net.
