# Freshman Pade volleys to the top on the Farm
## 
### CHRIS MEYER 
Growing up in nearby Woodside, one
would expect freshman James Pade to jump at
the chance to take part in the storied Stanford
tennis program. But Pade was not fully con
vinced that he belonged on the Farm until he
began to visit his other suitors.
"Not until I went on some other college re
cruiting trips did I realize how amazing Stan
ford is," Pade said. "None of the other schools
I visited offered such a strong balance of acad-

Men's Tennis
vs. Texas Christian, Saturday, 12 p.m

emics and athletics. Once I.realized how nice it
is out here, there was no way I could pass up
the opportunity to come to Stanford."
Pade's decision is already paying dividends
for the No. 7 Cardinal. He was one of the
bright spots in Stanford's 4-3 season-opening
loss to No. 4 California last Saturday.
Playing in his first dual match, Pade dropped
just three games in two matches. He and fellow

freshman KC Corkery joined forces to form the
Cardinal's No. 3 doubles team and defeated Cal's
Conor Niland and Or Dekel, 8-1. In the No. 5
singles position, Pade crushed former NCAA sin
gles quarterfinalist Steve Berke 6-2,6-0.
"Last weekend's match was tough because I re
alized that you can help the team as much as pos
sible and the team can still lose," Pade said. "How
the team fares is the only diing that matters."
During the fall tournament season, Pade
made his mark primarily in dou
bles. He and Corkery won five
matches in three days to capture
the Omni Hotels Regional Dou
bles Championship at Saint
Mary's College. They also reached
the consolation semifinals at the

National Indoor Championships
in Texas. Based on these results,
the duo was rewarded with a No. 9
national ranking.
"James and KC love playing to
gether and they complement each
other well," coach Dick Gould
said.
Since arriving at Stanford, the
opportunity to play with such ac
complished teammates on an
everyday basis has helped Fade

improve his game tremendously.
"Practices are awesome," Pade
said. "In high school, it was really
hard to find good people to hit
with every day. I've never hit so
many balls before and been on the
court so much every day with such
great players."
Dave Higaki, Pade's personal
coach since the age of 11 and the
Cardinal's volunteer assistant
coach, has aided Pade's transition

to college tennis.
"It's been really nice having
Dave around. He keeps my game
on the right track," Fade said.
Standing 6-foot-3 and listed at
195 pounds, Pade is an imposing
presence on the court. He plays an
aggressive style, using his strong
serve and powerful forehand to
control points.
"James has a really good all
court game," Gould said. "He has
a lot of versatility and a lot of
weapons. 1 think he's got phe
nomenal potential and a ton of
natural ability."
Gould believes an NCAA cham
pionship in singles or doubles may
lie in Pade's future. But before
that can happen, he must improve
certain aspects of his game.
"He has to learn when to hit the
big shot and when to keep the ball
in play," Gould said. "He needs to
set the points up before he goes for
a big shot or a big ace. He's a big
kid, so we're working on his quick
ness with his feet and that's getting
better."
According to senior Scott Lip
sky, Pade fits in well with the rest
of the team.
"He's a very hard worker and
the guys on the team really like
him," Lipsky said.
"He's a little quiet when you
first meet him," Gould said. "He
lets his racket do the talking,
which I really respect. He's a very
classy individual. He's a great rep
resentative of Stanford tennis."
This Saturday, Pade and the
rest of the Cardinal will play the
first home match of the year
against Texas Christian (4-1) at 12
p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis
Center. Admission is free for stu
dents with Stanford ID.
The Horned Frogs are led by se
nior Toni Gordon (ranked N0.48
nationally) and junior Alex Meni
chini (N0.85). The match is the first
of four consecutive home matches
for the Cardinal before it travels to
defend its National Team Indoors
championship Feb. 20-23 in
Louisville, Ky.
