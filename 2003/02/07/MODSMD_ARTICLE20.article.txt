# Gymnasts bound for Vegas
## National team membership may be in the cards for three Stanford men’s gymnasts 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford men's gymnastics
team (1-0, 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) is taking a break from NCAA
competition this weekend to go to Sin City.
Junior Dan Gill and seniors Matt
McLean and Marshall Erwin, plus former
Stanford All-American David Durante,
will challenge the best gymnasts in the
country fora spot on the U.S. national
team at the Winter Cup Challenge in Las
Vegas tonight. These athletes represent
the best chances that Stanford has had in
over six years at one of the four open po
sitions on the national team.
But Stanford's chances would be even
better if all-arounder Gill hadn't spent al
most two days in the hospital with a severe
wrist infection last week.
"I essentially missed five days of train
ing and I'm still not able to train rings or
high-bar," Gill said. "But as of now, I'm
going to compete all six events."
Whether or not Gill competes all six
will depend on how painful it is for him to
wear his grips-hand guards that buckle
around a gymnast's wrists. This is an im
portant decision because only gymnasts
competing in the all-around have a
chance of making the national team.
At last year's Winter Cup, Gill finished
third on the vault and fourth on the high
bar. His high-bar routine is one of the few
sets boasting the maximum 10.0 difficulty

in the country, and he is currently ranked
in the top six in the NCAA on floor, vault,
high bar, and in the all-around. Before
the wrist infection, he was fresh off a huge
performance at the Cardinal Open,
where he notched above a 9.3 on four
events and en route to winning the all
around title.
"If Dan can compete six events, you
know he'll do fine," all-arounder McLean
said. McLean, who finished sixth on high
bar at last year's Challenge, is looking to
continue his own hot streak after hitting
all six of his routines at the Cardinal
Open.
"I expect to hit, but as far as placing, I
don't have any expectations — I just want
to do my routines," McLean said. "I'm
definitely more confident that I can hit
this year, especially on pommel horse and
vault."
Former team member Durante, who
continues to train with Stanford club gym
nastics, will compete in his third-straight
Winter Cup. With his previous attempts
under his belt, this meet may be Durante's
breakout competition. He recently up
graded the difficulty of most of his rou
tines and is considered one of the cleanest
gymnasts in the world.
"I'm most excited about my parallel
bars routine, which starts at a 9.9 [difficul
ty]," Durante said. "I have a pretty good
shot at hitting it, so if I do that, I can place
really high."
Defending NCAA rings champion
Erwin, ineligible fora spot on the nation
al team by virtue of competing on only
one event, will attempt to top his second
place finish on rings last year. Despite
matching the evening's highest rings

Senior Matt McLean is ranked 11 th in the country on pommel horse. McLean, teammates Marshall Erwin and Dan Gill, and former Car

score with Olympian Sean
Townsend, Erwin was awarded
second due to tie-breaking rules.
Erwin has spent much of the off
season perfecting the lines and
positions of his many strength
moves on the rings.
A curious omission from the
competition roster is senior
Cade Raggio, who is currently
the NCAA's top-ranked gymnast
on the pommel horse.
The Winter Cup Challenge is
a 2-day competition, comprised
of the all-around competition

that determines the new nation
al team members and the event
finals for the top individual
event finishers.
Even though they are facing
the best gymnasts in the country,
including six of the seven mem
bers of the 2000 Olympic team,
the gymnasts know that the na
tional team spots are within reach.
"Normally, the guys that hit
seem to creep up in there," Du
rante said. "I think if we hit, we
should be right in the mix of
things."
"I want all the guys to hit their
routines," coach Thom Glielmi
said. "I feel very strongly that if
Dan and Dave hit their routines
they'll make the national team."
