Who would believe that what
sparked a victory for the Stanford
women's basketball team was its
Ail-American heading to the
bench?

Women's Basketball
Last night: Stanford 85, Oregon 54
at Oregon St., Saturday, 2 p.m.

That's exactly what happened
during last night's game against
Oregon.
When junior forward Nicole
Powell picked up her second foul
with 9:41 remaining in the first
half, Stanford trailed the Ducks,
22-20.
The N0.6 Cardinal (18-2, 10-1
Pacific-10 Conference) then went
on a 25-6 run to close the half, and
Stanford turned a close-knit con
test into a blowout as it cruised to
an 85-54 victory over the Ducks (8-
13,4-8).
The win extended the Cardi
nal's home winning streak to 22
games, including 11-0 at Maples
Pavilion this season. It was also
Stanford's fifth consecutive win
over Oregon and its 29th win in
the last 32 contests against the
Ducks.
Junior guard Kelley Suminski
and Powell led five Cardinal play
ers in double figures with 15 points
apiece. It was the fifth time Stan
ford has had five or more players
score in double-digits this year.
The reason for the Cardinal's
offensive onslaught was simple.
Stanford did precisely what
coach Tara VanDerveer stressed
all week: improve offensive execu
tion.
So, you might ask, what does
improving offensive execution ac
tually mean?
It meant the Cardinal was effi
cient. Stanford shot a season-high
56.4 percent from the field.
It meant the Cardinal didn't
play sloppily. VanDerveer's squad
had a season-low 11 turnovers.
And it meant the Cardinal got

everyone involved. Ever)' player in
uniform but one scored, including
both Sara McGee and Shelley
Nweke — accounting for only
their second baskets, respectively,
of the season.
"We saw our team execute of
fensively as well as we've done all
season or better," VanDerveer
said. "We have players, that when
they focus on things, they really
get it done."
VanDerveer explained that the
Cardinal made some subtle
changes to its offense in practice
this week. The team had been run
ning more of a motion, unstruc
tured offense out of a 1-4 high set.
But in order to cut down on
turnovers and stagnation, and to
increase fluidity and aggressive
ness, the Stanford coach installed a
more structured offense.
"We wanted to help people an
ticipate better where their team
mates would be," she explained.
"But offense doesn't work by itself
— the players made it work."
The Ducks noticed, too.
"I noticed sharpness to their ex
ecution that they didn't necessarily
have against us up at our place,"
Oregon coach Bev Smith said.
A couple of notables stood out
for the Cardinal.
Forward Azella Ferryman had
been struggling offensively lately.
She had reached double figures in
only one of her last eight games en
tering the weekend, including two
occasions when she went scoreless.
But the 6-foot-1 sophomore re
asserted herself — and reaffirmed
her place in the starting lineup —
with a 14-point, 8-rebound effort
that left her coach raving.
"This was such a great game for
Azella," VanDerveer said. "She
played so smart and within her
self."
Perryman felt like she'd gotten
a little retribution after the game.
"It's definitely been a frustrat
ing month," she said. "But it's a lot
of fun playing on a team where
anyone can come out and do real
ly well for us."
Freshman guard Krista Rappa
hahn also made a significant con
tribution.
She came in when Powell went
out in the first half and helped lead
