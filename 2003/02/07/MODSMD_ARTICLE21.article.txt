Who would believe that what
sparked a victory for the Stanford
women's basketball team was its
Ail-American heading to the
bench?

Women's Basketball
Last night: Stanford 85, Oregon 54
at Oregon St., Saturday, 2 p.m.

That's exactly what happened
during last night's game against
Oregon.
When junior forward Nicole
Powell picked up her second foul
with 9:41 remaining in the first
half, Stanford trailed the Ducks,
22-20.
The N0.6 Cardinal (18-2, 10-1
Pacific-10 Conference) then went
on a 25-6 run to close the half, and
Stanford turned a close-knit con
test into a blowout as it cruised to
an 85-54 victory over the Ducks (8-
13,4-8).
The win extended the Cardi
nal's home winning streak to 22
games, including 11-0 at Maples
Pavilion this season. It was also
Stanford's fifth consecutive win
over Oregon and its 29th win in
the last 32 contests against the
Ducks.
Junior guard Kelley Suminski
and Powell led five Cardinal play
ers in double figures with 15 points
apiece. It was the fifth time Stan
ford has had five or more players
score in double-digits this year.
The reason for the Cardinal's
offensive onslaught was simple.
Stanford did precisely what
coach Tara VanDerveer stressed
all week: improve offensive execu
tion.
So, you might ask, what does
improving offensive execution ac
tually mean?
It meant the Cardinal was effi
cient. Stanford shot a season-high
56.4 percent from the field.
It meant the Cardinal didn't
play sloppily. VanDerveer's squad
had a season-low 11 turnovers.
And it meant the Cardinal got

everyone involved. Ever)' player in
uniform but one scored, including
both Sara McGee and Shelley
Nweke — accounting for only
their second baskets, respectively,
of the season.
"We saw our team execute of
fensively as well as we've done all
season or better," VanDerveer
said. "We have players, that when
they focus on things, they really
get it done."
VanDerveer explained that the
Cardinal made some subtle
changes to its offense in practice
this week. The team had been run
ning more of a motion, unstruc
tured offense out of a 1-4 high set.
But in order to cut down on
turnovers and stagnation, and to
increase fluidity and aggressive
ness, the Stanford coach installed a
more structured offense.
"We wanted to help people an
ticipate better where their team
mates would be," she explained.
"But offense doesn't work by itself
— the players made it work."
The Ducks noticed, too.
"I noticed sharpness to their ex
ecution that they didn't necessarily
have against us up at our place,"
Oregon coach Bev Smith said.
A couple of notables stood out
for the Cardinal.
Forward Azella Ferryman had
been struggling offensively lately.
She had reached double figures in
only one of her last eight games en
tering the weekend, including two
occasions when she went scoreless.
But the 6-foot-1 sophomore re
asserted herself — and reaffirmed
her place in the starting lineup —
with a 14-point, 8-rebound effort
that left her coach raving.
"This was such a great game for
Azella," VanDerveer said. "She
played so smart and within her
self."
Perryman felt like she'd gotten
a little retribution after the game.
"It's definitely been a frustrat
ing month," she said. "But it's a lot
of fun playing on a team where
anyone can come out and do real
ly well for us."
Freshman guard Krista Rappa
hahn also made a significant con
tribution.
She came in when Powell went
out in the first half and helped lead
the run, scoring five of her career
high 10 points during that span.
The freshman also added a career
high 7 rebounds.
"That might have been the key
— being able to go to the bench
and having Krista respond that
way," VanDerveer said. "She came
in and got to the free-throw line,
took the ball inside and played well
defensively."
However, Stanford didn't just
dominate offensively.
The Cardinal out-rebounded
the Ducks 39-22, setting a season
low for rebounds by an oppo
nent. And Stanford limited the
Ducks to only 35.7 shooting and
held guard Brandi Davis in check
once again.
Davis, who has taken over the
role of super-athletic guard on the
Oregon squad after star Shaquala
Williams was dismissed from the
team, went 3-14 from the field
against the Cardinal after going 2-
10 against Stanford in Eugene in
January.
Clearly, playing at Stanford was
a very different experience for the
Ducks, who couldn't match the
same effort they put forth in their
one-point loss a month ago.
"We didn't come out with the
same intensity and fire that we
need to and that hurt us," said
Ducks center Carolyn Ganes, who
led her team with 10 points.
Losing on the road in confer
ence play is nothing new for Ore

gon, who has lost 16 of its last 24
Pac-10 games away from home.
Stanford also got some good
news from Tucson, where Arizona
handed second-place Washington
a 79-66 loss, extending the Cardi
nal's Pac-10 lead to a game and a
half.
The Cardinal played without
starting point guard Susan King,
who sat out with a broken liitle left
toe.
King had injured the toe
against Pepperdine on Jan. 5 and
had played with the injury since
then. The toe got sore this week, so
the Stanford training staff kept her
out of last night's game for precau
tionary reasons.
She's listed as questionable for
Saturday's 2 p.m. game with Ore
gon State.
