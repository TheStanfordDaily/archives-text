### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tomorrow, in front of 65
relatives, two former Cardinal
coaches and a talented South
ern California team, five se
niors from the No. 1 Stanford
men's swimming program (6-
0, 2-0 Pacific-10) will compete
in the final home meet of their
impressive collegiate careers.

Men's Swimming
vs. USC, Saturday, 1 p.m.

Randall Bal, Pat Fowler,
John Waters, Dan Westcott
and Thomas Zochowski each
came to Stanford with their
eyes wide open and with a true
passion for the sport, accord
ing to coach Skip Kenney. As
the years passed, they pro
gressed from energetic fresh
men to Pac-10 and NCAA indi
vidual and relay champions.
"Every one of these guys
loves the team and it really
shows," Kenney said. "Their
attitudes are so positive that it
is just contagious. Every coach
wishes that he could have a
team like this one and we can
attribute a big part of our suc
cess this year to our five se
niors."
During their four years
competing for the Cardinal,
the seniors each distinguished
themselves as team leaders
and swimming superstars.
They have earned 28 All-
American honors between
them and were a major factor
in Stanford's two straight

NCAA runner-up finishes.
"It's hard to believe that
four years have gone by al
ready," Waters said. "This
team has done so much during
that time and I don't think that
you can beat Stanford. Being
on the team with the rest of
these guys has been a real priv
ilege and we have a great
group of people who work re
ally hard and offer so much to
each other."
Kenney agrees that the
team's dedication to the sport
has made his time working
with it all the more memo
rable.
"They gave me four years of
their lives, day after day. They
would come out here early in
the morning to practice, when
it was cold and rainy and
everyone else was asleep,"
Kenney said. "You really bond
with them and it is just the
greatest feeling to see them
succeed. I really learned a lot
from these guys."
In celebration of the final
home meet for the seniors, the
team invited the swimmers'
families to a weekend of spe
cial events. In addition, two
former Cardinal coaches, Jim
Gaughran (1960-1979) and
Tom Haynie (1947-1960) will
be on hand to see Stanford
take on No. 7 Southern Cali
fornia (5-1,2-0) at 1 p.m. at
Avery Aquatic Center.
"There have only been four
men's swimming coaches in
the history of the school," Ken-
ney said. "I have coached for 24
years, Jim Gaughran coached for
20 years, and Tom Haynie
coached for 13 years prior to
that. There is such a tremendous
history of people coming this
weekend, and it's really going to
be special."
The rivalry between the Stan
ford and USC teams dates back
to 1970, when Swimming World
magazine recognized them as the
top two private collegiate swim
ming programs in the country.
Stanford hasn't lost to the Tro
jans since 1997. Each year, the
winner of the dual meet takes
home a bell trophy donated by
Swimming World.
"USC has one of the greatest
swimmers of all time competing
for them," Kenney said. "Fortu
nately, he (Erik Vendt) can only
swim three events in the meet.
The rest of the team is also very
strong, though."
Senior co-captains Jeff Lee and
Vendt should lead USC in its bat
tle against the Cardinal. Vendt is
arguably the greatest distance
freestyler in the country. He has
won three NCAA titles during his
career at USC, and as a junior he
was named NCAA Swimmer of
the Year. In addition to being a
tough relay competitor, Lee is
strong in both the butterfly and
freestyle events. "From the team
perspective, we've been looking
forward to this meet fora long
time," Zochowski said. "Personal
ly, this will be a bittersweet week
end. It will be the last time that my

classmates and 1 will compete for
Stanford in front of the home
crowd."
"We all have great memories
of Stanford competition and rac
ing together and it will be sad to

see that time pass. On the other
hand, this is really the beginning
of the preparation for champi
onship season. We want to end
our Stanford careers with an
NCAA championship."
