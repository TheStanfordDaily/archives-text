# Baseball ready to strike out the Seminoles
## 
### RUSSELL GOLMAN 
When the No. 3 Stanford baseball team (2-3)
faced No. 4 Florida State last year, it was a mar
quee matchup between the two top-ranked teams
in the country.
Neither team has slipped much in a year, and
the Seminoles are surely looking to avenge last
year's 2-1 series loss tonight at Sunken Diamond.
While both teams' position among collegiate
baseball's elite has been stable in the past year,
their rosters have not. The Cardinal features four
new starters in the infield, and FSU has two new
comers in the outfield.
Stanford will have to rebound from last week
end's sweep at No. 13 Cal State-Fullerton. It was
the first time a Cardinal team has emerged winless
in a three-game series since 1997.

Baseball
vs. No. 4 Florida St., today, 6 p.m.; Saturday, 1 p.m.;
Sunday 1 p.m.

"We'll have to play better defensively and
swing the bats much better versus FSU than we
did at Fullerton," coach Mark Marquess said. "Of
fensively, we didn't generate many scoring op
portunities, and we need to be able to do that."
Tonight junior pitcher John Hudgins will try
to improve on his 1-0 record diis year against the
Seminoles' Marc LaMacchia, who did not give up
an earned run in winning his first outing of the
season.
Tomorrow afternoon senior lefty Tim Cun
ningham (1-1), also a returning starter, will take
the mound for the Cardinal against Matt Lynch
(1 -0). Cunningham is at his best when he is throw

ing strikes and making hitters work to get on base.
Marquess has yet to name a third pitcher to duel
with Mark Sauls (1-0) on Sunday.
After a rough series last week, Stanford's pitch
ing staff has a season ERA of 4.50, but opponents
have only been able to manage a .237 batting av
erage over the team's five games. Stanford's .283
batting average in that time, however, is not much
better.
Juniors Brian Hall and Carlos Quentin and
sophomore Danny Putnam hope to continue
their last starts — all three are tallying batting av
erages above .400 — and spark the rest of the of
fense, as no other Cardinal is above .300. Fresh
man first baseman John Mayberry Jr., a first
round pick in the Major League Baseball draft
straight out of high school, notched
his first collegiate home run last
weekend and aims to add some
punch in the lineup against the
Seminoles as he gets acquainted to
collegiate ball.
Cunningham and Quentin, as
well as senior center fielder Sam
Fuld and senior catcher Ryan
C.arko, earned 2003 preseason All-
America honors for Stanford. But
FSU boasts the same, as four of their
players were named Ail-Americans
in the preseason.
Marquess experts FSU to bring
their A-game.

"They're a very talented and
experienced team," Marquess
said. It will be another good test
for us. We have a good rivalry with
them throughout the years and
there have been some great
games."
Indeed, the overall series of 14
meetings is a dead tie. Stanford
has won five of the last six games
between the clubs, sweeping two
years ago and averaging 10 runs
last year. Florida State was the last
non-conference team to win a se
ries over the Cardinal before last
weekend's setback.
With such talented teams squar
ing off, fans can expert a hard fought
series. First pitch tonight is set for 6
p.m., while Saturday and Sunday's
contests will begin at 1 p.m.
