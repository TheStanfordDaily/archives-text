## Volleyball suffers without Toppel By EMILY KUEHLER 
### 
Without first-team All-Ameri
can Curt Toppel, the No. 6 Stan
ford men's volleyball team (5-6, 3-
4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) could not compete with No. 4
Pepperdine (8-1, 6-0 MPSF).
The Cardinal fell to the Waves
in three straight games in a match
that took only an hour and 15
minutes.

Last night: No. 4 Pepperdine 3, No. 6
Stanford 0
at USC, Saturday, 7 p.m.

Toppel did not make the trip
with the team as he is sitting out
with an abdominal strain that has
been bothering him since the Car
dinal's win over then-No. 1
Hawaii.
"We're not really sure when
he's going to return," said Coach
Don Shaw. "But the guys are
going to have to get used to play
ing without him really fast."
Toppel's absence caused a
major shift in the Cardinal lineup.
Senior Will Curtis, Stanford's
starting outside hitter moved to
Toppel's opposite hitter spot.
Sophomore libero David Vogel
started at outside hitter in place of
Curtis and freshman Jeremy Ja
cobs was inserted at libero.

Ultimately only half of Stanford's
starters were at their usual posi
tion.
"No one stepped up like they
needed to," said Shaw. "I expected
bigger numbers from the guys
who were taking the swings that
Curt usually takes."
Curtis posted a team-high 12
kills, while senior outside hitter
Billy Strickland added nine kills.
"Billy and [senior outside hitter
Paul] Bocage were ineffective,"
said Shaw. "And it wasn't until the
end of the match that Curtis start
ed to play well."
The error-plagued Cardinal
finished with a season-low . 176 hit
ting percentage, compared to a
.444 percentage posted by the
Waves.
Stanford was kept on the defen
sive throughout the match after a
quick start from Pepperdine.
"We started really slowly, while
they got on an early roll," said
Shaw. "We just never were able to
take the momentum away from
them."
Pepperdine was led by junior
outside hitter Fred Winters, who
finished the match with 15 kills.
"In addition to Winters, they
got great production from their
setter and a couple other guys,"
said Shaw.
Sophomore setter John Mayer
recorded a match high 42 assists
and added seven digs. Two more
Pepperdine sophomores, out
side hitters Mike Gledhill and
Sean Rooney recorded 10 kills
each.
"What it comes down to is that

we never really got on track
tonight," said Shaw. "I'm hoping
that the guys can bounce back real
ly quickly."
On Saturday night, the Cardi
nal has a chance to finish off' the
road trip on a positive note.
The Cardinal will travel to Los
Angeles to take on Southern Cali
fornia (2-6, 1-4 MPSF).
The Trojans are playing for
first-year coach Turhan Douglas,
who is hoping to turn the team
around after last year's season,

which saw the program's worst fin
ish since 1972.
USC is coming off two straight
wins against UC San Diego (3-6,0-
5 MPSF) and Division 111 La
Verne. The Trojans can count on
strong play from senior outside
hitter Mark Dusharme and senior
middle blocker Josh Day.
"I think we have a great oppor
tunity to gain some confidence
back," said Shaw. "But it will take a
better effort than we posted
tonight."
