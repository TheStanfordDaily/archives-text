# Student-run Bazaar online auction off to a promising start
## 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After its first quarter in operation, The
Bazaar, an on-campus online venue for
buying and selling items, has proven gen
erally successful, according to Bazaar
manager Elizabeth Yin.
Yin, a junior, estimated that
bazaar.stanford.edu has a few thousand
users. Yin based her analysis on student
responses and the Web site's popularity.
"Bazaar's first quarter was a very edu
cational experience," Yin said. "I've seen
the potential for growth as more and
more students have been using the Web
site."
Student reaction, however, indicates
that there is some dissatisfaction with
Bazaar and that, after trying Bazaar, stu
dents will turn often to other services.
"I searched the Bazaar Web site when
I was looking to buy a couch, but there
were so many people [placing bids] that I
thought my chances would be better on
su.market where there is a fixed price,"
said junior Eun Sang Hwang.
The Web site, sponsored by Stanford
Student Enterprises, is free and functions

as a forum for the University community
to buy and sell items. Located at
bazaar.stanford.edu, the Web site re
quires a Stanford identification for access.
Some students have shown interest in
the way the site works and have asked Yin
about general usage, she said. Yin has also
found that students like the Web interface
and search feature for buying and selling
items online.
"As we have grown, lately, I have had
people come up to me, saying that they
check the site frequently to look for items,
even if they have not hing specific in mind
to buy," Yin said.
She said the site's current focus is to in
crease its traffic.
"There is always room for improve
ment, and the more people use the site,
the more it benefits everyone on this cam
pus," Yin said.
Freshman Dan Tran cited this lack of
usage as one of the Web site's issues.
"Because Bazaar is not that popular
among Stanford students, the selection is
not that good," Tran said. "I would rather
get things from other [off-campus] Web
sites."
The site was launched in the middle

of last quarter. Yin said that starting out
was difficult but by the end of autumn
quarter, things picked up and began to
run smoothly.
"Like any new Web site, we have had
some bugs," she said. "When people re
port them, this helps us out a lot, and we
are able to work around those bugs im
mediately for those users."
The site facilitates two methods of
transaction: an auction method and a
fixed-price method. The auction method
works similar to eßay where the seller can
post items on which potential buyers can
bid. t he fixed-price method allows sellers
to advertise an item on which bidders can
then make an offer. The seller, who re
ceives e-mail notification, can then reject
or accept the bids. Both methods have

had about equal popularity, Yin said.
Bazaar follows in the footsteps of the
su.market news groups, which act as re
sources to the Stanford community for in
dividuals to post for-sale and wanted ads.
While similar as a forum for buying and
selling items, the two technologies are rel
atively distinct in terms of use and format.
The news group does not have a search
engine, categorization of items for sale or
an auction system.
As a result, students use the different
forums for personal reasons.
"I like su.market better than Bazaar
because it uses e-mail interface," said
freshman David Wang.
Bazaar allows the user to search for
items or browse categories, including
bikes, computer equipment, electronics,

furniture and textbooks. According to
Yin, textbooks have been the most popu
lar item, as she had expected.
Yin hopes Bazaar will expand as a tick
et vendor for various groups on campus.
Another prospective move for Bazaar is
converting to a non-profit enterprise.
This would ensure that the Web site
would continue to operate without charg
ing user fees. Bazaar is currently funded
by the student enterprises, which covers
expenses and provides various resources.
According to Yin, there have been "ongo
ing and tentative" talks with the ASSU
about the non-profit option.
"I believe that Bazaar is a great service
for students here — it makes connecting
with people for buying and selling easier,"
Yin said.
Yin came up with the idea for an on
campus, online auction two years ago as a
freshman, and the student enterprises ini
tially rejected her proposal, according to
the Bazaar Web site. Her plan was accept
ed last year and she worked with pro
grammers and the SSE Tech Group to
complete the project. The site is based on
a Computer Science 194 group project of
former SSE CEO Ross Davisson.
