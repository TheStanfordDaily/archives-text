### SAMANTHA PLESSER BROWN DAILY HERALD (BROWN U 
(U-WIRE) PROVIDENCE, R.I — A UC-
Berkeley dean who resigned in November amid al
legations that he had had a sexual encounter with a
student two years ago has prompted schools across
the country to examine the rules that govern facul
ty-student relationships outside the classroom.
Since UC-Berkeley Dean of the Bloat Hall
School of Law John B. Dwyer's resignation just be
fore Thanksgiving, institutions such as Oberlin
College and the College of William and Mary have
banned all non-professional encounters between
professors and students, according to the Los An
geles Times.
Colleges that do ban such relationships use their
policies to protect the community from any possi
ble scandal that could arise from a relationship be
tween a student and professor.
In May, Stanford University made it mandatory
for faculty to report all dating activity with students,
as well as to keep documentation of the relationship
to avoid problems if the relationship ends.

But Brown University has no specific policy on
relationships between students and faculty unless
they share a class.
"Brown has a responsibility to protect its stu
dents but it also has a responsibility not to infringe
on people's rights," said Associate Dean of the Fac
ulty William Crossgrove.
"It is not our job to govern other people's lives or
make their decisions, but faculty and students
should be sensitive to the fact that a relationship
like that could have other things involved in it."
Crossgrove said a memo is sent to each member of
the Brown faculty and staff at the beginning of the
school year that outlines the policy on sexual harass
ment and strongly advises against "amorous relation
ships with a student" as it could lead to the faculty mem
ber being "vulnerable to sexual harassment charges."
Crossgrove did say that the one instance in
which Brown forbids any relation between faculty
and staff is when it's a conflict of interest — the stu :
dent is actually directly in the class of the profe: sor
or graduate assistant.
Crossgrove also said that accusations of sexual
harassment against faculty members are rare.
