# Haas deadlines approaching
## Center offers around 100 fellowships to students 
### RYAN HUNTER 
Fighting malnutrition in Mex
ico, teaching theater to Palestin
ian youth in Jerusalem and work
ing for non-profits here in the
Bay Area â€” all of these projects
have been completed by Stanford
students using summer fellow
ships offered through the Haas
Center for Public Service.
Although they may want to
spend their summer doing service
work, Nadinne Cruz, director of
the Haas Center, said that many
students bypass such options be
cause they don't think they can af
ford a summer without working.
But, Cruz said, that's where the fel
lowship comes into play.
"Often students say, 'If only I
could take care of my living ex
penses I'd love to do [public ser
vice work]," she said. "They stereo
type good works by saying, 'It's
impossible to do, because I can't af
ford to.' A fellowship provides ex
acdy the key to that dilemma."
The fellowships offered by the
center support public service-re
lated work that otherwise would
not be paid.
According to Jon McConnell,
community partnerships place

ment coordinator for the Haas
Center, fellowships are generally in
partnership with a specific organi
zation. Some are pre-designed,
while others are developed by stu
dents on their own, he said.
Fellowship placements are not
limited to a specific geographic
area, either. In previous years,
fellows have worked on issues of
AIDS and computer use in Africa,
environmental issues in China
and Mongolia and community
health in Mexico. Many fellows
work domestically, as well, in
cities like Philadelphia, San
Diego and East Palo Alto.
Feb. 10 and 11 mark the dead
line for most of the Haas Center's
fellowships. Students still inter
ested in applying can either com
plete their applications this week
end or apply to one of the several
fellowships due later in February
and April.
The remaining fellowships in
clude the African Service Fellow
ship for social and economic issues
in Africa; the Eben Tisdale Fellow
ship, a technology and public poli
cy program based in Washington
D.C.; and the Stanford Pride Sum
mer Fellowship for activism in gay,
lesbian, bisexual and transgender
communities.
The 14 fellowships currently of
fered to undergraduates typically
last around six weeks, McConnell
said. The Haas Center also has

three longer 10 to 12 month fel
lowship programs designed specif
ically for graduating seniors.
McConnell said that most of
the fellowships are endowed and
will be offered again next year, in
addition to several new fellow
ships. Currently, the Haas Center
awards around 100 fellowships
each year.
James said that the competi
tiveness of the fellowships vary
widely between programs and
from year to year.
"When you look at the num
bers, it looks a little more compet
itive," she said, adding that "it's
very rare that a very qualified
person is turned away."
Cruz said that the fellowships
are intended to both help people
around the world and honor the
recipients.
"In the academic world, the
word 'fellowship' is associated
with an honor for an academic
achievement," she said. "We
think about our fellowships as be
stowing honor for different
achievements."
She added, "I meet many
Stanford students who are starry
eyed idealists and want to do
good in the world. Doing good
things is a craft; it has to be prac
ticed."
Cruz said that the fellowships
seek to grant students that op
portunity.

Senior human biology major
Allison James, who works as a stu
dent coordinator at the Haas
Center, previously pursued a
Haas Summer Fellowship at a
secondary school in Ghana.
James said that she recognized
the school's need when she spent
time abroad her junior year and
teachers lacked adequate supplies.
"I realized it's impossible to

teach when you have nothing to
teach with," she said.
After returning to Ghana on a
Haas Fellowship, James stocked a
spare school room with sports
equipment, school supplies and
science equipment. The teachers
would tell her what they needed
most, and she would do her best
to get it, James said.
Since her fellowship, the

school's situation has improved
drastically, and test scores have
risen, James said.
She added that she learned
how "one person making a tiny
little change can change the
world in some way."
Fellowship applications and
further information are available
from the Haas Center Web site at

The Haas Center, located on Salvatierra Way behind the Law School, has information on dozens of service
opportunities around the world.
