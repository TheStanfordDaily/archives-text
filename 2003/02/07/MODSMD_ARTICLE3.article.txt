# Public safety head reports stats for 2002
## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jaws dropped and eyes widened as Director of
Public Safety Laura Wilson revealed statistical in
formation about Stanford's safety issues to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday afternoon. Her comprehen
sive report to the senate reviewed her depart
ment's philosophy, its somewhat surprising num
bers of arrests and citations, including those in
volving student alcohol use and recent problems
widi staffing cutbacks.
In 2002, her deputies made 417 arrests and is
sued over 2,000 citations, mainly for biking law in
fractions. In the last year alone, the department
also issued over 42,000 parking citations on the
Stanford campus. The money collected from these
thousands of citations goes not to the University,
though, but rather to Santa Clara County.
Though her force has been quite active and
very successful in protecting the campus, the lack
of officers has created problems for Wilson. To il
lustrate this point, she presented statistics related
to alcohol use on campus. Last year, her officers
made 38 minor-in-possession arrests, but she feels
this number poorly reflects alcohol use on campus.
"If I had more staff, [this number] would be
much higher," she said confidendy. "We have five
officers out, maybe four, on Friday and Saturday
night... There could be only two officers on duty
at night [on a weeknight]." She added that this is
far too few to effectively cover a college campus.
To put these figures in perspective, she told
the senate that it takes two officers three hours to
fill out paperwork to process a driving-under
the-influence citation. It could take a new officer
as many as 11 hours to go through the same
process.
She called Stanford's alcohol problem "ap
palling" and referred to one night where 11
Stanford students were admitted to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning — but just because she
knows there is a problem doesn't mean that a
"crackdown" is imminent.
"We're doing the same thing we've always
done," she said. However, she added, "This is
a problem that we and the University need to
address."
Nonetheless, her deputy shortage cannot
quickly be allayed, she said.
Though she is currendy recruiting
more officers, no new staff will be
able to join the force until after the
completion of nine months of in
tense training — and she can't take
just any officer for her squad.
"I want to make sure that the
people who work here want to
work at Stanford," she said. Find
ing an officer whose dream is to
work on a college campus is a little
difficult, she added.
"You hear sports, you think of
Stanford. Academics, Stanford.
You hear police work, you don't
think of Stanford," she said.
During the meeting, Wilson em
phasized that the department's
goal is ultimately public safety.
"We are educators, just like the
rest of the University," Wilson said.
She said the department educates
the public through law enforce
ment, ranging from arresting mi
nors in possession of alcohol to issu
ing tickets to bikers without lights.
Whatever the enforcement, she as
sured the senate that her depart
ment is committed to making Stan
ford as safe as possible — despite
having fewer staff than desirable.
Wilson's report on bicycle safety
at Stanford took some senate mem
bers by surprise. She announced
that one of her goals is to achieve 50
percent bike light usage by the stu
dent population — she estimated
that the figure is now at about 45
percent.
Such a high percentage clearly
shocked the senate. Incredulous,

Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo
suggested that she deputize him
and other faculty to detect more
bike light neglecters.
After saying that only two per
cent of bikers actually stop at stop
signs, Wilson fielded the question
of what counts as a "stop" while on
a bike. She explained that a stop is
not necessarily putting a foot on the
ground; slowing down and looking
both ways suffices.
But Wilson also issued a word of
warning: a ticket for running a stop
sign on a bicycle can be $ 190.
"It's basically the same as if you
run a stop sign in a vehicle," Wilson
said.
"Bike theft is one of the biggest
problems on campus," she contin
ued, pointing out that the annual
Silicon Valley unemployment rate
almost exactly mirrors Stanford's
yearly bike theft trend.
Linguistics Prof. Tom Wasow
asked whether her department is
more concerned with "enforcing
the law or public safety," recalling
an incident where he'd received a
citation on his bicycle that he felt
was unjustified. "The problem is
not stop signs — it's people talking
on cell phones while they're rid
ing," he said.
Wilson wholeheartedly assured
the senate that her top priority is
safety and suggested that the only
way to protect oneself from cita
tions is to abide by all the rules.
Upon her presentation's comple
tion, University Provost John
Etchemendy summarized the unan
imous sentiment of the senate and
praised her department's efforts.
"I think we have the best public
safety department of any universi
ty," he said.
