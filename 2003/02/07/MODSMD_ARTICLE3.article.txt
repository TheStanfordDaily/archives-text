### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jaws dropped and eyes widened as Director of
Public Safety Laura Wilson revealed statistical in
formation about Stanford's safety issues to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday afternoon. Her comprehen
sive report to the senate reviewed her depart
ment's philosophy, its somewhat surprising num
bers of arrests and citations, including those in
volving student alcohol use and recent problems
widi staffing cutbacks.
In 2002, her deputies made 417 arrests and is
sued over 2,000 citations, mainly for biking law in
fractions. In the last year alone, the department
also issued over 42,000 parking citations on the
Stanford campus. The money collected from these
thousands of citations goes not to the University,
though, but rather to Santa Clara County.
Though her force has been quite active and
very successful in protecting the campus, the lack
of officers has created problems for Wilson. To il

to alcohol use on campus. Last year, her officers
made 38 minor-in-possession arrests, but she feels
this number poorly reflects alcohol use on campus.
"If I had more staff, [this number] would be
much higher," she said confidendy. "We have five
officers out, maybe four, on Friday and Saturday
night... There could be only two officers on duty
at night [on a weeknight]." She added that this is
far too few to effectively cover a college campus.
To put these figures in perspective, she told
the senate that it takes two officers three hours to
fill out paperwork to process a driving-under
the-influence citation. It could take a new officer
as many as 11 hours to go through the same
process.
She called Stanford's alcohol problem "ap
palling" and referred to one night where 11
Stanford students were admitted to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning â€” but just because she
knows there is a problem doesn't mean that a
"crackdown" is imminent.
"We're doing the same thing we've always
done," she said. However, she added, "This is
a problem that we and the University need to
address."
Nonetheless, her deputy shortage cannot
