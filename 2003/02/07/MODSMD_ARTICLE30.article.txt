# Applications on the rise at Dartmouth

### ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.
— Dartmouth College saw an
unprecedented number of ap
plicants this year, as 11,700 ap
plications found their way to Mc-
Nutt Hall by the Jan. 1 deadline.
"It was a record year by huge
margins," said Dean of Admis
sions Karl Furstenberg. "It will
be the largest applicant pool in
Dartmouth history, and we're
up more than anyone else in the
Ivy League."
The pool of 11,700 applicants
is up 15 percent over last year's
figure of 10,200, a far larger per
centage increase than any other
school in the Ivy League. Har
vard also saw a record number
of applicants, with 20,918, but
experienced only a 6.7 percent
increase over last year's number.
While the increase in applica
tions is good news for Dart
mouth, it will do little to reassure
student applicants.
"Overall, the admit rate will

be well below 20 percent for the
first time ever," Furstenberg
said. "It's going to be a lot
tougher to get into Dartmouth
this year."
Furstenberg expects the ad
mittance rate to drop to 18 per
cent, down from 21 percent
from last year.
The constitution of this year's
applicant pool was also unique.
Nearly two-thirds of this year's
applicants are from public
schools, up from 60 percent the
last two years.
While the male-to-female
ratio remained the same as last
year —53 percent male to 47
percent female — the numbers
of international students and
students of color increased dras
tically. International student ap
plications were at "an all-time
high," up 17 percent from last
year, Furstenberg said.
Likewise, Dartmouth re
ceived "record levels" of applica
tions from students of color —
11 percentage points more than
last year, Furstenberg said.
