### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
"How to Lose a Guy in 10
Days" embraces many of the
characteristics that today's
love connection shows in
clude: two people fall into
last, superficial love, with
hopes of enriching their so
cial and financial status
through reciprocity. "Joe
Millionaire," "How to Marry

a Millioniare" and"The Bachelor," are
joined by Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson)
and Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey)
— two people who dispense with the for
malities of courting and establish a mean
ingful relationship in 10 days.
Andie Anderson is Composure Mag
azine's "How To" girl. Her monthly
column runs features on make-up,
clothes, botox and breakup. However,
Andy is passionate to ditch the shallow
topics and delve into political pieces
and issues of substance. How will she
get her way? With an outlandish plot,
of course! Andie's boss challenges her
to write a first-hand account on "How
to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," especially
honing in on all of the pathetic flaws

that women inadver
tently make through
out their relationships.
If her feature is a suc
cess and the guy
dumps her, Andie will
be rewarded with col
umn topics of her
choice.
Enter Ben Barry, who

has just been challenged by his boss to
make a woman fall madly in love with
him within 10 days. As fate and the magic

of Hollywood would have it,
Andie and Ben meet at a bar
and the deception begins.
The film is admittedly pre
dictable, but its charming push
and pull of two career-driven
characters using a love-facade
to achieve their individual
goals has some movie merit.
Andie tries her best to make
Ben dump her by calling his
mother, making him custom
CD mixes, concocting a prema
ture wedding album (complete
with magazine photo chil

dren), and leaving her Vagisill in his bath
room medicine cabinet. Meanwhile, Ben
(to Andie's frustration) takes the punches
and accommodates Andie's erratic nature
the best he can. Andie even goes so far as
to ask Ben fora diet Coke during the last
few heated seconds of a Knicks game.
Though obviously aimed at women
(Producer Lynda Obst also produced
"Sleepless in Seattle") , "How To Lose a
Guy in 10 Days" will make girls thorough
ly aware of some of the annoying things
that men loathe in relationships, while

making men appreciate the fact that their
girlfriends are not as insane as Andie.
Both sexes will take pleasure in watching
an over-the-top parody of a clingy and co
dependent relationship in full force.
The movie, which also has its own
book and board game, comes out just be
fore Valentine's Day. Even if you don't
have a date on the 14tn, the image of the
ever-elusive Kate Hudson in designer
"second-skin" dresses and a shirtless
Matthew McConaughey will provide for
good company in the movie theater.

"There are no 'Help Wanted' signs
in Hollywood. The guards and the
gates are not there to keep you in,
they're to keep others out."



"WAAAH! I asked for dressing on the side!"
