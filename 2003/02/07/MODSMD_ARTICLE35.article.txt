# Q &A with Matthew McConaughey
## 
### 
Intermission had a chance to conve
niently pry 10 questions from Texan
charmer McConaughey concerning
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" and
other pressing issues.
INTERMISSION:
How do you sell "How to Lose a Guy in
10 Days" to the male population?
MM: It is a chick flick, but it's also for guys.
I got into the script, but I got an angle on
Ben that reflects a male point of view, so I
think guys can handle it. I am certain that
both girls and guys will laugh at it.
INTERMISSION: What will people get
out of your character, Ben?
MM: Women are going to just love Ben.
He shows amazing patience under ex
treme duress. And men are going to to
tally relate to how Andie tests this poor
guy to the max. I mean, she rearranges
his bathroom, she changes his music, she
redoes his apartment, and she even in

vades his poker game. Still, I found my
self actually rooting for them to get to
gether.
INTERMISSION: What would you say
attracts you to a script?
MM: It matters where I am at that time.
The director, the story all make a differ
ence, and a character that I can find an
angle on always makes it easier to decide.
It has to be something where I can look at
the character and say, "I know this guy."
Sometimes it takes me a while to find a
character on my feet, it can even take two
to three weeks into the movie and I'll still
be trying to find my legs. Fear is kind of
healthy though, it allows the actor to feel
his way through a part.
INTERMISSION: Who would be your
dream person to work with as an actor?
MM: Tom Hanks. I met him a couple
times. He's a funny, smart guy. Cole
Houser [from "Dazed and Confused"]

and Susan Sarandon would be great.
INTERMISSION: I heard you studied
law and then changed vour major to
film?
MM: I wasn't sleeping so well with the
idea that I wanted to spend seven years
in law school. At that time I was doing a
lot of writing and had a lot of stories I
wanted to write out. I still have passion
for law, I mean, I've played three
lawyers and I love debate. It's still cool to
look back at old diaries and see what I
wanted to do, but I know that I have al
ways wanted to act.
INTERMISSION: What advice would
you give to someone who wants to get
into acting?
MM: There are no "Help Wanted" signs
in Hollywood. The guards and the gates
are not there to keep you in, they're to
keep others out. The one piece of advice
I can offer is to take risks if you want to

make it in Hollywood.
INTERMISSION: In a recent interview
you said that you did not want to date
girls; you wanted to date women.
MM: No no no. I said 1 wanted to date
WOMEN, which means that a woman
can still be a girl, but a girl can never be
a woman. If you've never been a
woman, you can't be one yet! It's sim
ple, and I think the same thing goes for
boys too!
INTERMISSION: What do you think
about being an object of attraction?
MM: (Pause) Right 0n!... Yeah, I guess
that's how I feel.
INTERMISSION: Tell us something
unique that people don't know about
you.
MM: Although my roles keeps changing
in movies, I always keep my heart.
