Reviews by JESSICA JOFFE and
BRIAN UMANA
Consider it more than a litde iron
ic that Sundance really has become
something of an elaborate dance
these days. Whether it be films woo
ing distributors, the tittering
courtship of hot new writer / directors
and management agencies or the
giddy step of common moviegoers
eager to catch a glimpse of celebrities
(and the celebrities equally eager to
avoid them), one can't help feeling
that Sundance must be a very differ
ent animal from the one Robert "The
Sundance Kid" Redford envisioned
two decades ago. Back then it must
have been infinitely easier to stay true
to the spirit of independent film —
less marketing, less stars, less deals,
more adherence to that ideal of starv
ing artists and bohemian truths.
Nowadays, Sundance is about
high-profile premieres graced by
stars, and the studios that show up
just to be seen. It's about Skyy Vodka
parties and the denizens of LA who
fora week and a half have packed up
and transplanted their whole ques

tionabie culture to Utah. It's about
standing in crowded streets waiting
for that chance to glimpse J. Lo and
Ben, or hobnobbing with quasi-legiti
mate actors and directors who are al
ways eager to discuss their next "pro
ject" with you. And all of this occurs
within the homely confines of Park
City, Utah, a quaint ski village of a
town that one can't help feeling must
be barren for the other 354 days of the
year that Sundance does not exist.
Of course, for me to yearn about
the good old days of Sundance is like
my roommate trying to swap Vietnam
war stories — let's face it, Huy, we
were never there. The truth is, for all
this talk of how commercial the festival
has become, it's still an amazing expe
rience. There's nothing quite like hav
ing Kevin Spacey gruffly tell you to
step aside as he exits his premiere, like
trying to score Skyy swag at a party
from people who are too drunk to no
tice, or like sacrificing sleep and sanity
waiting outside all night in the freez
ing cold to buy tickets.
And OK, there are some pretty
cool films to see as well. Despite an
alarming profusion of inane ques
tions from a disturbingly uneducated

public, my favorite part of Sundance
screenings are the Q Sc A sessions with
the director and cast that occur im
mediately afterward. Seeing gor
geous actors in person (mmm, Rachel
Weisz) is always cool; it also helps to
have a physical presence to channel
silent rage at when you realize you've
just wasted two hours of your life that
would've been better spent sleeping
— oh wait, you were sleeping.
In the end, that's the one thing
about Sundance that you can be con
fident will never change: there will al
ways be God-awful movies to see,
movies that make you want to scream,
to tear your hair out and ultimately
even make you decide, "Hey, I'm
going to make my own God-awful
movie for Sundance." Intermission
was lucky enough to have a few writ
ers on site this year (yours truly in
cluded), and what follows are their fa
vorite picks of the crop they managed
to catch. Some of these — "Thirteen"
and "Leland"— have in fact been
picked up for distribution, so this
won't lie a complete waste of your
time. Be thankful, readers— many
brain cells died to bring you this in
formation.

Commandante
For his latest project, Oliver Stone spent three days and
three nights with Fidel Castro, shooting over 30 hours of his
own conversations with the Cuban leader. The men travel
around Cuba and discuss the histories of their two countries
since Castro took office: the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Missile
Crisis, the Elian Gonzales case, global environmental prob
lems, Che Guevara and even Castro's opinions on American
cinema.
Castro comes across as intellectual, deliberating and witty.
Some may say that Stone was not hard enough on Castro, but
the truth is that Castro answers difficult questions with relative
ease, usually sounding truthful and only rarely evasive. This is
a movie from which people can learn a lot about U.S. - Cuban
politics, but its best moments are still the many unexpected
ones (Castro saying " Brigitte Bardot can count me among her
admirers," or theorizing that a second gunman must have
been involved in the Kennedy assassination). Another mo-

ment also stands out, in which the handheld camera drifts
down to Fidel's shoes; on the toes of each foot is a little Nike
swoosh. —Brian Umana
Dot the i
The luscious Gael Garcia Bernal tries on a West London
accent for size and almost gets it right! The boy did study
drama at London's RADA for three years, so he ought to have
learned at least something there. Bernal stretches his reper
toire by playing a struggling actor from Brazil, his lips glis
tening as he scuffs through the London streets causing mis
chief and falling in love with a Spanish temptress who already
happens to be engaged to a limp-wristed English dandy.
Trouble and sex ensue: alternatively passionate (with Bernal,
who seems to have learned a thing or two since "Y Tu
Mama") and rigid (with the horsey English fellow, of course).
You'd be fooled into thinking that this is just another love tri
angle story, but just as it reaches the height of predictability,

it turns in on itself and succeeds in salvaging the audience's
goodwill. -Jessica Joffe
It's All About Love
It is the future and Claire Danes is a chin-quivering ice
skater, Joaquin Phoenix a concerned professor. They are try
ing to get their divorce settled, but things start going pear
shaped when they learn they're being sucked into a big, odd
conspiracy that threatens their lives. They wear symbolic col
ors and very earnest expressions on their faces as well as try
ing on a variety of (fictional) Slavic accents for size. The seasons
rearrange: summer turns to winter and it

stays that way. Sean Penn plays
Phoenix's brother — overdosing i

on fear-ot-tlying pills, he has been
relegated to eternal life aboard
giant airplanes flying over what
seems to be an endless mountain

range. He wears a Janet Jackson 1
headset and uses his brother's
voicemail as his rambling diary. Ap-

parendy it's all about love, but if

that's the case, the film's de-

nouement is not terribly

encouraging. Did I

mention director
Thomas Vinterberg
envisions flying
Ugandans as part of
his zany future
world?

Madame Sata
The antithesis of
what one finds in
mainstream Ameri
can cinema; it could
make "Hedwig and

the Angry Inch" seem "
conservative, based on

the true story of Joao de
Francisco dos Santos, a
black gay man in 1930s
Rio de Janeiro who lives I
as an outlaw. Joao

(Lazaro Ramos) works as a bully for nightclubs but is more
than just a shrewd street character who makes extra cash as a
prostitute, a pimp, and a thief; or works hard on a transvestite
singing act, aspiring to become famous. In addition, he acts
against social injustice and really knows how to fight. Brazilian
first-time director Karim Ainouz varies the film's pace with a
deft hand. At the movie's best, he segues from languid day-

time scenes that drip with the sweat of the

Brazilian heat to fast-paced nighttime se-

quences, in which Joao usually kicks

the asses of people who do not want
. him as part of their society — some-

times to the sound of majestically
ironic accordion music.
B.U.

Party Monster
Macaulay Culkin tries on short shorts

for size and they fit. It's

1990 and he's been tak-

ing fashion lessons
from Ginger Spice, to
a remarkable effect.
He bounces about the
place in platform
sneakers, applying his
makeup according to
the more-is-more
school of thought and
snorting a variety of
white powders off
smooth surfaces. He is
just an eager kid from
Middle America try-

r ing to carve out an exis
tence for himself in the

big city, so he goes to Rick
ey's for fake eye-lashes and
some glitter and appoints
himself the cheery emblem
of the most debauched and
decadent phase of New
York night life. Ecstasy was

still legal, Limelight and Club USA were in their
prime and night clubs were still for dancing. Un
fortunately the tun doesn't last forever, there are
overdoses, someone gets killed and someone else
writes a book about it. Within seconds the whole
scene dies, and people start shopping at Armani
and buying lounge music compilations. -J.J.
Raising Victor Vargas
Victor Vargas tries on a wife-beater for size, but
it doesn't fit, so he throws it over his shoulder and
walks around topless all day. With a body like that,
I strongly contemplated removing all of Victor's
shirts permanently, lest any of us should be de
prived of that perfectly gleaming piece of equip
ment. It's an ordinary summer on the Lower East
Side for Victor: causing mischief at the public
pool, sweet-talking the ladies, letting popsicle
juice run down his arm, sweating and arguing
with the family. That is, until word gets out that
he's been caught in the teenage version of fla
grante delicato with the local fatty. Victor is deter-

mined to restore his reputation and zones in on the juiciest girl
of the neighbourhood: Juicy J udy. What ensues is a tenderly
awkward tale of first love between two kids who realise they've
spent far too much time fronting. The picture hangs heavy
with color and heat, and the actors, all unprofessional, bring a
simple intensity to the story that enchants instandy.

Song fora Raggy Boy
One thing is certain here: this movie does not reflect well
on the Catholic Church. Irish director Aisling Walsh tells a
semi-factual story in which we meet a number of characters,
mosdy tough children at a 1940s Irish Reformatory and In
dustrial School (a place for kids who have criminal records or
families who cannot take care of them). The adult characters
consist of a priest who severely beats kids, one that rapes them,
and a few more who stand by and watch. Then there's the
good guy, William Franklin (Aidan Quinn), an atheist English
teacher who comes to the school because he needs a job. He
inspires the children to use learning as a way to change their
lives and stands up to the priests. The movie avoids coming off
as simplistic because of the nuance and tragedy that fill the
plot. Quinn's performance would be reason enough to see this
film, but beautiful photography of the south-Irish countryside
and phenomenal child acting provide added incentives.
Walsh recruited t he young boys, almost none of which had
any acdng experience, at a boxing school in Belfast. Hie Re
formatory and Industrial Schools lasted through most of the
20th century in Ireland, but the movie ends with a solid jab
that won't allow American audiences to feel superior. - B.U.
Thirteen
A well-intentioned girl wants to be popular, becomes
friends with her middle school's "bad girl" and in the process
ditches her old friends and strains her relationship with her
single mother (Holly Hunter). The two girls at the center of
the movie look edgy in a 13-year-old way (read: pierced belly
buttons and tongues, skin-tight jeans, and glittery Abercrom
bie and Fitch baby-tees), but they get absorbed in stuff that is
scary for anyone — self-starvation, drug use, self-mutilation
and social interacdon with boys who pressure them for sex. Di
rector Catherine Hardwicke wrote this film with the help of
Nikki Reed, a 13-year-old girl who I'm betting was not on top
of all of the script's ironies. The most impressive aspects of
" Thirteen" are the set and costume details, however and those
are probably just the kind of things Reed was helpful on; col
lages littered with images ofj. Lo and Justin I imberlake have
never fit a scene so well. The film succeeds because the script
comes off as extremely heartfelt — at certain moments it's im
possible not to understand the pain of the on-screen situation,
showing why Hardwicke won the Sundance Dramatic Direct

ing Award for her work here. But certain problems with the
manner in which the story progresses tend to give the im
pression that the filmmakers would have trouble making an
other compelling movie unless it were about, say, 14-year-old
girls. -B.U.
The United States of Leland
My favorite movie of my three days at Sundance, "Leland"
was produced by Kevin Spacey and prompdy sold to Para
mount; despite a warm reception, however, it failed to garner
any festival awards. Writer / director Matthew Ryan Hoge
crafts something more than your typical teenage drama — he
creates a truthful tone poem about life. Ryan Gosling stars as
teenager Leland Fitzgerald, the son of a famous novelist (a
fleeting Kevin Spacey) who has murdered an autistic child for
mysterious reasons. While in juvenile detention awaiting sen
tencing, Leland befriends a teacher (Don Cheadle) who wants
to write a book about him. I won't describe any more — the
movie deserves no preconceptions — but the true star of the
film is Hoge's script, which features impressively perceptive
dialogue that balances elements of "American Beauty" with
the angst of "Donnie Darko" (a past Sundance breakout).
Some might find it indulgent and melodramatic, but one of
my favorite moments of the festival was the feeling of exquis
ite sadness that Hoge's main character conveys in his narra
tion; Gosling wisely plays Leland with relaxed restraint, and
the film successfully works to make us feel sorry for ourselves
just as much as we do Leland. Sure, he's just a more resigned
Holden Caulfield, but for two beautiful hours Hoge gives you
the freedom to wonder about the nature of life and what truly
matters, and to do it without guilt. -G.L.
