# From Pumpkins' ashes, Corgan and Co. rise
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
Anyone who was still listening when the now-de
funct Smashing Pumpkins toured in 2000 to promote
their final album, "Machina / The Machines of God,"
can attest that the music was darkly contemplative and
fatalistic.
Following the Pumpkins for my entire junior high

and high school life and see-

ing them live a grand total

of nine times, I knew,
watching the band rock

through its last ever tour,

that things were changing

for Billy Corgan. The lead singer / songwriter was get
ting older, thinking about death and taking stock of a ca
reer which included not only phenomenal success and
accomplishment, but also the loss of fans, band mem
bers' addictions to drugs and the loss of his own mother.
Just two years after the Pumpkins bowed out more
graciously than most members of the grunge rock pan
theon — releasing a free double-album exclusively to the
Internet and performing two incredible farewell perfor
mances in Chicago — I was anxious to see what had be
come of Billy Corgan; Where would two years away from
the specter and fame of the Smashing Pumpkins leave
him, lyrically and musically? If "Mary Star OfThe Sea" is
any indication, Corgan has found happiness in the arms
of middle-age, true love and God.
Zwan is Corgan's most collaborative effort yet, shar
ing vocal duties with longtime friend Matt Sweeney (of
'90s underground rockers Chavez) and Paz Lenchantin
(hot bassist, formerly of A Perfect Circle) and mixing
melodies, riffs and solos between the three guitar fuzz of
Corgan, Sweeney and David Pajo (virtuoso of Slint and
Tortoise). Jimmy Chamberlin, once fired from the

Pumpkins for an out-of-control heroin addiction, is the
only member of that band to join Corgan in his new digs
and translates his drumming strengths, which made the
Smashing Pumpkins the kings of alternative stadium
rock, into the strong, yet often thoughtfully restrained,
backbone for Zwan's melodies.
After downloading the video for Zwan's first single,
the straightforward rock love song "Honestly," the
first thing that struck me was that Corgan was smiling;
I was so surprised by it that I began to grin myself,
squinting into my computer's monitor to make out
every last detail.
This is what the core of the album's appeal for me is all
about: Corgan's self-confidence is no longer in the form
of the Pumpkins' "the world is a vampire" angst. Instead,
Corgan is confident about the power of love, about his
place in the world as a man and about the power of faith

in God. In the vein of John Lennon's
solo work, the lyrics are deeply personal, but also speak
to people of Corgan's (and our) generation more gener
ally. The best songs by far are "El Sol" and the album's
final track, "Come With Me," which sound very melodic,
even folky at times and feature some of the most honest
and romantic rock lyrics in years.
Is "Mary Star of the Sea" groundbreaking, experi
mental or done with phat beats by the Neptunes? No, in
deed it is not. But after going ga-ga over the likes of neo
garage rockers The Liars, The Libertines and Scene
Creamers over the past month, those albums have sud
denly found themselves gathering dust while I keep
putting "Mary" back into the stereo; under all the pre
tense, what I really want is what Zwan brings: damn good
melodies, introspection and lyrics with a sense of pur
pose, beauty and faith.



Look, the/re smil
ing... sort of.
