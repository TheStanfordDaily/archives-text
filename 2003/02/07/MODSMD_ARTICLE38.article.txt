# Recruit me?! Hell no!

The poor CIA. There were those alle
gations it introduced crack cocaine into
the inner cities. There was Sept. 11. Now

comes a movie like "The
Recruit" to scare away
scores of bright,.willing col
lege students from joining
its ranks.
Al Pacino stars as hard
ened CIA recruiter Walter
Burke, who first appears as
some old guy stalking MIT
student James Clayton at
his campus job fair. Clay
ton, played by co-star Colin
Farrell ("Minority Report")

is a computer genius, boxer and bartender
to boot, apparently just what the CIA is
looking for.
On top of that, when James was 12, his
father died in a mysterious plane crash
near Peru and Burke successfully exploits
James' long-held suspicions that his father
worked for the CIA in order to lure him in.
"I always thought the CIA was a bunch
of fat, old white guys who fell asleep at the
wheel when we needed them most," Clay
ton tells Burke early in the film. Pacino re
sponds by challenging James to find out
what the CIA is really all about and ma
nipulates him (as only sketchy CIA people
can) into thinking that he will be his men
tor and father figure throughout the train
ing process.
Unfortunately the father figure in

Burke speaks almost exclusively in punchy
catchwords and platitudes, among which
"Everything is a test" and "Nothing is what
it seems" bear the most repetition.
These lines ring harshly true once

James and his fellow re
cruits arrive at the secluded
CIA training compound
that coincidentally shares
its nickname with Stanford
— The Farm. At The Farm,
we watch as a class of fresh
CIA recruits goes through
spy boot camp, subjected to
physical conditioning, lie
detector tests, mind games,
urban war games and even
torture.

In one of the movie's bleakest scenes,
James is suddenly kidnapped from The
Farm and spirited off to a small chamber
with grimy metal walls. There he is beaten,
starved and interrogated for what seems
like days. His captors want to know if he is
from the CIA. Janes wants to believe his
captors are CIA officers. He wants to be
lieve it's just another test.
Therein lies the redeeming strength of
the movie — the way it keeps the audience
guessing just as its characters keep each
other guessing. "The Recruit" is one of
those movies where you never know
what's real and what's a lie. That play with
deception might become tormenting to
the paranoid, who probably flock to see
movies like this.
Otherwise, there is not much else to

latch onto in this movie. Pacino and Farrell
are two great actors, and hats off especial
ly to Farrell for holding his own opposite
Pacino. Regrettably, James' quest to know
more about his father is underdeveloped,
and his romance with co-recruit Layla,
played by Bridget Moynahan, never feels
like anything but a tension device.
Unlike most movies of the genre, the
aesthetic feel of "The Recruit" is dead on
and realistic while its story remains re
markably uncomplicated and liable to be
described by a two-word summary that
gives the whole movie away: nothing
happens.



"Man, do I look cool running in these
action shots."
