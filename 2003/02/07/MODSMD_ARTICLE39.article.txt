# True confession: we've seen better before

### PHIL FLORES 
What do you get when you combine
mindless sex and violence, pervasive lan
guage, a multimillion dollar budget, A-list
stars and a first-time director? You get
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," a
film that lacks direction and purpose but
expects us to feel sympathy for Chuck
Barris, its unfunny subject. Although Sam

Rockwell
("Galaxy
Quest") as Bar
ris valiantly tries
to reclaim any
real humanity
Barris has left,
the character ul
timately comes
across as a good
for-nothing
prick that no
one (least of all a
paying audi
ence) should
care for.
Directed by
George
Clooney, "Con
fessions" culls its
plot from the

notorious autobiography written by
Chuck Barris, the creator of such TV
classics as "The Dating Game" and"The
Gong Show." The premise of that book
and this movie is that Barris, a TV pro
ducer, leads a secret life as a CIA-trained
assassin responsible for killing 30-odd
people over the course of nearly 20
years. As preposterous as this might

sound, Clooney and
screenwriter Charlie
Kaufman ("Adapta
tion") effectively inte
grate Barris' day job
with his life as an inter
national hitman. These
segments provide most
of the film's laughs, as
Barris skillfully and
not-so-skillfully hides

his double life from his employees and
his loyal girlfriend, Penny, played by
Drew Barrymore ("Charlie's Angels").
Most of the movie's A-list cast live up
to their billing. Sam Rockwell gives a
chameleon-like performance as Barris,
portraying him as a tortured entrepre
neur and con-artist whose double life
consumes him. In addition to directing,
Clooney co-stars as Barris' CIA handler,
doing well to subdue his leading-man
presence in deference to Rockwell's star
turn as Barris. Barrymore is unremark
able as his girlfriend, although the role
does not require anything of her to
begin with. And in another of a growing
list of non-roles, Julia Roberts is miscast
as a spy, adding little, if anything, to
"Confessions." The filmmakers don't

even allow Roberts to give the
audience one of her world-fa
mous, shiny-teeth grins, so
why even have her in this
movie?
The film's problems
mainly stem from its lack of
identity. Is this supposed to
be a tragi-comedy about a fas
cinating but troubled man, a
spy flick, or a ridiculous com-

edy? Clooney's direction appears to
originate from the Steven Soderbergh
school of filmmaking. While he packs in
as many cool camera shots and tricks as
possible, Clooney fails to translate these
stylistic devices into a compelling story,
something his frequent collaborator
Soderbergh can pull off more often than
not. Having a script written by Kaufman
(whose mixing of genres worked well in
previous movies, notably "Being John
Malkovich") does not help to alleviate
the film's identity crisis.
It's quite disconcerting that Miramax
would give the OK to a high-brow movie
about such a low-brow roach as Barris. It's
a testimony to the power and clout
Clooney wields that such a film could even
be made.
