# Rigid format defines pre-professional programs
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Law, medical and business school are
among the most popular academic des
tinations for Stanford alumni, but few
prospective applicants realize the stark
contrast between the atmosphere of in
dividual research and inquiry found in
academic graduate studies and the
more focused, compeutive environment
of a pre-professional program.
"Medical students are at war," said
medical student Everett Meyer. "They
are always studying and facing batdes,

while grad students are on a voyage of
exploration which seems a lot more
fun — but in the end they could get
lost."
While many fellow pre-professional
students echoed Meyer's concern with
the workload intensity, the true differ
ence may lie in the type of work done,
rather than the amount.
"The work of law school is classes; the
work of graduate programs is research,"
said law student Ben Horwich. "Night
and day."
He added, "We study a curriculum in
law school because we're joining the

ranks of an existing profession, with ex
isting techniques and modes of think
ing. But in graduate school, you're more
concerned about going beyond what ex
ists now and doing original work."
John Donahue, a professor of law, ex
plained the distinction between academ
ic and pre-professional graduate pro
grams in a similar way.
"The total amount of work is proba
bly similar," Donahue said. "But while
anyone [who is accepted] can get
through law school, the same is not true

for graduate school since you have
to be much more of a self-starter to
do original research."
Many pre-professional students
agreed that the methodical format
of a law, medical or business educa
tion makes the workload appear
more intense than that of other
graduate programs.
"The medical school curriculum
is a tour de force of information that
must be sorted through and memo
rized ad nauseam," Meyer said.
Because of their professional
focus, law, medical and business
students generally take the same
heavily structured classes during
their first few terms. This curricu

lum ensures that everyone is pro
vided with the same foundation of
knowledge, but it can also serve to
turn students away from academic
exploration and force them on to a
narrower path.
"Medical school is an intensive
educational process whose goal is to
provide students with the tools and
abilities and experience necessary
to become a doctor," said medical
student Kara Bradford. "In doing
so, all facets are designed with that
goal in mind. Students and the cur
ricula are focused on relevant infor
mation which will be of use to future
physicians."
"I would say that professional
schools emphasize career trajecto
ries more fundamentally," said law
student Araceli Campos, an execu
tive board member of Stanford
Latino Students Association.

The size of the graduating class
es also influences the student expe
rience in pre-professional pro
grams. The Law School is relatively
small with 185 students in the first
year class, yet academic graduate
schools only have a fraction of this
number.
"I think [the] Law School is
much more insular than the other
graduate programs at Stanford,"
said law student Bianca Sierra.
"Law students tend to keep to
themselves, while other graduate
programs seem to have more inter
action with each other."
But while law and medical stu
dents often form unified communi
ties isolated from the rest of cam
pus, many students said pre-profes
sional programs are actually more
social than they expected.
"Because of the professional

component involved in law school,
it seems a more social environment
than most of the graduate schools,"
Campos said. "Figuring out what
you want, and interviewing for and
getting that job is a big part of the
law school experience."
Pre-professional programs fur
ther remove their students from a
purely academic atmosphere by re
quiring them to participate in in
ternships and obtain work experi
ence so they can familiarize them
selves with their future work envi
ronments.
"Your summer employment in
law school is very important and
must be obtained months in ad
vance," Campos said.
While acquiring work experi
ence is stressful for many pre-pro
fessional students, it is often essen
tial to future employment opportu

nities. Pre-professional programs in
general are often viewed as provid
ing students with an edge in the job
market.
"In the current economic cli
mate, having any extra signal on
your resume is helpful," said
William Triant, a doctoral student
in business.
"I remember hearing in New
York during the Great Depression,
some hotels would only hire Ph.Ds
to operate elevators. It's not so bad
now, but still quite tough."
While pre-professional students
may be rewarded in the job market
after graduation, most face stiffer fi
nancial burdens during their edu
cation than academic graduate stu
dents, because law and medical stu
dents commonly cannot pay for
their research with fellowships and
grants. This financial burden can be

a major factor in shaping their fu
ture.
"Having to pay back huge debts
also diminishes one's ability to
choose more-needed, sometimes
more fulfilling but lesser-paying po
sitions," Campos said.
According to Horwich, all these
factors mean that the choice be
tween academic graduate and pre
professional schools may depend as
much on the type of educational at
mosphere students are looking
for — whether they prefer a struc
tured environment or individual
research — as on their future ca
reer plans.
"I think that grad school is right
for some, professional school is
light for others," Horwich said. "So
it's more of a question of whether
it's the right fit [rather] than what
opportunities are offered by each."
