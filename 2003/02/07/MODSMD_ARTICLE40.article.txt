# 'Chicago' CD lacks razzle dazzle

Following in the footsteps of "Evita" (1996) and
"Moulin Rouge" (2001), the only successful onscreen
musicals in the last few years, Rob Marshall's "Chica
go" is laudable on screen, but the soundtrack is weak
on your home stereo. The 1996 "Evita" faced the for-

midable task of compet-

ing with its excellent

1976 precedent —
the London cast

recording with Julie

Covington and the Lon-

don Philharmonic. The recent blockbuster version
featured Madonna, who, despite her inventive child
rearing tactics, is a talented singer. "Moulin Rouge,"
like "Chicago," featured actors who are passable
singers (Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor) rather
than the other way around, but Baz Luhrman's musi
cal production genius turned the soundtrack into a
gem.
"Chicago" is a black lingerie cabaret show about
"the six merry murderesses of the Cook County jail"
(two in particular) and their media shenanigans as
they dance their way out of cold-blooded murders.
Originally on Broadway in 1966, the show starred
Chita Rivera singing John Kander's music and Fred
Ebb's lyrics (for more of this duo, see the 1966 version
of "Cabaret" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman"). The

show's 1996 Broadway revival has been so successful it
is still running.
For this screen version, Marshall casts Renee Zell
weger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere; all of
them are excellent actors (especially Zellweger in
"Jerry Maguire"), but. singers?
Well, in their descriptions of Zellweger and Zeta-
Jones' performances, no less than three major news
publications used the word "vamp" (which, evidently,
means something along the lines of "acting seductive
ly," particularly when followed by the words "it up").
On the recording at least, Ebb and Kander's score
retains its sassy, eclectic jazz excellence. But I can't

help feeling that I'd rather be listening to the 1996 re
vival recording with Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reink
ing.
Fora musical whose stage success takes advantage
of its Bob Fosse choreography, a studio recording
needs an extremely punchy — on the verge of too
much — style, but, for whatever reason, producer Ric
Make restrains himself. A musical recording should,
on a good stereo, come memorably close to the fullness
and excitement of the live performance; it should not
be a passable reproduction of what one heard in (or at)
the theatre.
Velma's opening track "And All That Jazz" sung by
Zeta-Jones needs to set the show's tone of zany, self
ironic, entertaining almost justifiable criminality.
Track 3, "When You're Good to Mama," despite the
ingenious decision to cast Queen I.atifah as the prison
house matron, should seduce you into the real politick
of life among sexy murderesses. Roxie (Zellweger)
should offer her answer to Zeta-Jones in "Roxie" and
surpass her in sexy, morally questionable daring.
"Razzle Dazzle" should add Billy Flyyn's (Gere's)
dearth of scruples as he plans a murder defense based
on "a show that's so splendiferous," that the jury can't
"hear the truth above the roar."
If you'd like to hear such things, go get the 1996
recording. Then download an awesome remix of lif
Kim turning a Broadway song into a damn good hip
hop song.



Kind of like Marilyn Monroe, but sluffier.
