# Lou Reed quoths ‘The Raven’
## 
### KEVIN LIM 
While the longevity and inven
tiveness of Lou Reed has cat
apulted him to rock
demigod status, it's thor-

oughly disorienting to see
that same man fall to his
"mere fan" knees in a motley,
superlative-laden tribute to

another artist, renowned macabre writer
Edgar Allan Poe. The influential Reed
has forged lyrical blades, sharpened
melodic daggers and armed countless
followers with these tools in their quests
for brutal, graceful rock expression. But
in his latest album, "The Raven," Reed

takes his diverse rock

repertoire and makes a
star-studded, diverse —
if lukewarm — scrap
book dedicated to Poe.

Reed comes out glowing:

"For sure, Edgar Allan Poe is that most clas
sical of American writers." Maybe I didn't
notice his tongue in his cheek, but the first
four and a half minutes of "The Raven"
sounds like the brassy encore of a "Chica
go" concert, engineered to rouse 40-some
things to their feet. Or maybe that's a
hoarse Huey Lewis and the News, whoop
ing it up with gaudy tooting and giddy
lyrics like "these are the stories of Edgar
Allan Poe / not exacdy the boy next door."
Not exactly the stately entrance of the be
guiling raven that Poe had in mind.
The rest of "The Raven" weaves a
quickly predictable pattern, each track fit
ting one of three obvious categories.
Much of the album is loaded with spoken
performances of Poe pastiche poems, of
fered by a variety of celebrity thespians,
including Willem Dafoe and Amanda
Plummer (best known for her work as the
raspy, vulgar British woman who holds
up the diner at the beginning of "Pulp

Fiction"). Sitting idly by, this aspect of the
album may be the most emotionally com
pelling, especially Dafoe's reading of

"The Raven."
However it is trouble
some to concentrate on
the lyrics and find out
that Reed has done some
unethical bioengineering

of Poe's undead spirit. Some of the
shoved-in anachronisms (references to
cocaine and limp-cock syndrome) create
a desirable thrill, but for the most part
Reed is guilty of mish-mashing disjoint
Poes and lukewarm Reeds to generate
things that just aren't there. As a result,
what gives the original "Raven" its high
perch is taken down a notch by Reed's
tampering.
The second sporadic theme of several
"Raven" tracks is the strangely upbeat
melody with morbid or druggy lyrics.
The supreme 'What the hell is going on?'
moment comes when Steve Buscemi
waltzes in the door and croons a 1940s
nightclub revue melody called "Broad
way Song." For no apparent reason, this
Reed-mediated Perry Como / Edgar
Allan Poe crossover is laced with oral sex
imagery. Cognitively, the "Hey hey, it's
Steve Buscemi!" thought can only keep
this interesting for so long.

Last in Reed's scrapbook technique
trifecta is the mournful song, a la the old
Velvet Underground. The deadpan
voice that fronted VU for so long is ex
humed fora few highlight tracks, includ
ing the gripping "Vanishing Act." The
vivid "Call On Me" is a good attempt at
harnessing the heart of Poe in a solid
Reed mope. Another highlight is the re
configuration of Reed's "Perfect Day" by
Antony, a singer discovered by producer
Hal Willmer, who serves as a new-dav,

male version of VU accessory Nico.
All in all. Reed's enthusiasm, diverse
talents, and impressive address book of
celebrities strengthen the album. A star
studded tribute to a literary legend that
doesn't seem conceited is an achieve
ment in and of itself. But Reed's inconsis
tent use of his assets and his dubious ap
proaches at both the spirit and the letter
of Poe muddle this album. It's got a few
gems, but yields far fewer thrills than
Poe's achievements.
