# Activists stay silent on Korea
## Student groups show little reaction to the Bush administrations Korea policy 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though campus groups have been mobi
lized by the Bush administration's policy on
Iraq, many Stanford activists have not taken a
stance on the nuclear standoff with North
Korea.
"President Bush is not publicly focusing on
North Korea," said Stanford College Repub
licans President Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore,
in reference to students' relative apathy to
ward the Korean situation. "Obviously, the
administration is paying more attention to the
situation than we, the public, see on TV and
in our papers."
North Korea disclosed in October that it

had renewed its efforts to develop nuclear
weapons, despite the country's 1994 agree
ment to halt all nuclear activities and to allow
full inspections of its materials and facilities.
Most recently, North Korea threatened to
pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera
tion of Nuclear Weapons, thereby allowing it
to evade any international legal troubles in
pursuance of nuclear advancement.
Most agree that the situation is serious, and
it is one that campus organizations have dis
cussed. However, the general consensus
seems to be that the circumstances are beyond
the immediate influence of college students.
Therefore, instead of activism, a policy of ed
ucation is being followed.
"We are mobilizing to support stiffer action
against North Korea, but, as college students,
we are sometimes limited by what we can do,"
Fairbanks said. "We are continuing to edu
cate our members and any Stanford students

willing to listen on the North Korea
issue, and when people are exposed
to the facts, then they are more will
ing to support stiller action against
this brutal regime."
The Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, which has played
an active role in the anti-war move
ment, has not had meetings specifi
cally addressing Korea.
"The fact that we're not meeting
about this indicates primarily that
we don't take much offense with
what the current administration is
pursuing," said senior Calvin Miaw,
coordinator of SCPJ. "Our princi
ple is to change things, but what we
currendy see in the Bush adminis
tration with regard to [North]
Korea is diplomacy and peace, and
we don't see a need to change any
thing there."
Among those who have followed
the developments regarding North
Korea, student sentiments seem to
echo Miaw's stance.
"I think that the administration's
less confrontational approach to
North Korea, while it has many

problems, is certainly a better one,"
said Derek Kilner, a freshman. "But
I also think that it highlights the ad
ministration's hypocrisy in choos
ing which regimes require military
intervention. We need to re-exam
ine why the administration is so
eager to attack Iraq, because, as
North Korea's case shows, national
security does not seem to be a legit
imate reason."
There appears to be general
agreement in support of Bush's
diplomatic negotiations with North
Korea, though the situation has cre
ated fissures in opinion within some
organizations.
"We agree on a more aggressive
stance, but there seems to be a split
in strategy within the group," Fair
banks said of the College Republi
cans. "Some of us believe we should
withdraw our troops in South
Korea and allow that part of the
world deal with the problem, while
some of us believe we should be the
leaders in disarming the dictator
ship as we are in Iraq."
Considering the situation of
North Korea has also exposed Bush
to accusations from the left of em
ploying a double standard, while
those on the right defend Bush in
the face of these "war for oil" allega

uons.
"While diplomacy is still an op
tion with North Korea, Saddam has
proven himself immune to the
process of give-and-take inherent in
any rational negotiations," said in
coming editor in chief of the Stan
ford Review Piotr Kosicki, a sopho
more.
"Naturally, a peaceful solution is
always preferable to an armed con
flict," he said. "That is why I fully
support the administration's diplo
matic initiatives toward North
Korea while maintaining my sup
port for the Iraqi policy. If the issue
were truly oil, why would the presi
dent be pushing the Iraqi situation
in Americans' faces, rather than em
phasizing the diplomatic solution to
North Korea?"
Miaw, however, countered this
argument.
"Pro-war activists argue that
Saddam is a madman who wants to
blow us up as soon as he has the
nukes, and therefore we must take
action against him," he s<iid. "This
paranoia and fear is not perceived
within the North Korean situation,
yet Kim Jong-Il seems insane as
well. I don't understand how they
can favor action against one unsta
ble leader but not another/'

The Bush administration's view
is that action must be taken before a
country gets nuclear capabilities.
North Korea is believed to already
have nuclear weapons, while Iraq
does not, so the focus is on preven
tative measures in Iraq.
"The divergent approaches to
Iraq and North Korea taken thus
far by the administration reflect
measured threat assessments on the
part of the two nations," Kosicki
said. "Just because North Korea has
fissile material, it will not necessarily
use that fissile material unless it
deems doing so to be in its interest.
Saddam Hussein, on the other
hand, has historically proven him
self to use weapons of mass destruc
tion with abandon â€” he may not
have access to fissile material yet,
but the chemical and biological
weapons arsenal that he maintains
in material breach of U.N. Security
Council resolutions dating back to
1991 is a perpetual threat to our na
tional security."
Leaders of activist groups said
faculty involvement related to
North Korea has been minimal.
"1 have unfortunately not heard
anything specific on this issue come
from academics at Stanford," Fair
banks said.

I also think that it highlights the ad
ministration's hypocrisy in choos
ing which regimes require military
intervention. We need to re-exam
ine why the administration is so
eager to attack Iraq, because, as
North Korea's case shows, national
security does not seem to be a legit
imate reason."
There appears to be general
agreement in support of Bush's
diplomatic negotiations with North
Korea, though the situation has cre
ated fissures in opinion within some
organizations.
"We agree on a more aggressive
stance, but there seems to be a split
in strategy within the group," Fair
banks said of the College Republi
cans. "Some of us believe we should
withdraw our troops in South
Korea and allow that part of the
world deal with the problem, while
some of us believe we should be the
leaders in disarming the dictator
ship as we are in Iraq."
Considering the situation of
North Korea has also exposed Bush
to accusations from the left of em
ploying a double standard, while
those on the right defend Bush in
the face of these "war for oil" allega

uons.
"While diplomacy is still an op
tion with North Korea, Saddam has
proven himself immune to the
process of give-and-take inherent in
any rational negotiations," said in
coming editor in chief of the Stan
ford Review Piotr Kosicki, a sopho
more.
"Naturally, a peaceful solution is
always preferable to an armed con
flict," he said. "That is why I fully
support the administration's diplo
matic initiatives toward North
Korea while maintaining my sup
port for the Iraqi policy. If the issue
were truly oil, why would the presi
dent be pushing the Iraqi situation
in Americans' faces, rather than em
phasizing the diplomatic solution to
North Korea?"
Miaw, however, countered this
argument.
"Pro-war activists argue that
Saddam is a madman who wants to
blow us up as soon as he has the
nukes, and therefore we must take
action against him," he s<iid. "This
paranoia and fear is not perceived
within the North Korean situation,
yet Kim Jong-Il seems insane as
well. I don't understand how they
can favor action against one unsta
ble leader but not another/'

The Bush administration's view
is that action must be taken before a
country gets nuclear capabilities.
North Korea is believed to already
have nuclear weapons, while Iraq
does not, so the focus is on preven
tative measures in Iraq.
"The divergent approaches to
Iraq and North Korea taken thus
far by the administration reflect
measured threat assessments on the
part of the two nations," Kosicki
said. "Just because North Korea has
fissile material, it will not necessarily
use that fissile material unless it
deems doing so to be in its interest.
Saddam Hussein, on the other
hand, has historically proven him
self to use weapons of mass destruc
tion with abandon â€” he may not
have access to fissile material yet,
but the chemical and biological
weapons arsenal that he maintains
in material breach of U.N. Security
Council resolutions dating back to
1991 is a perpetual threat to our na
tional security."
Leaders of activist groups said
faculty involvement related to
North Korea has been minimal.
"1 have unfortunately not heard
anything specific on this issue come
from academics at Stanford," Fair
banks said.
Though campus groups have been mobi
lized by the Bush administration's policy on
Iraq, many Stanford activists have not taken a
stance on the nuclear standoff with North
Korea.
"President Bush is not publicly focusing on
North Korea," said Stanford College Repub
licans President Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore,
in reference to students' relative apathy to
ward the Korean situation. "Obviously, the
administration is paying more attention to the
situation than we, the public, see on TV and
in our papers."
North Korea disclosed in October that it

had renewed its efforts to develop nuclear
weapons, despite the country's 1994 agree
ment to halt all nuclear activities and to allow
full inspections of its materials and facilities.
Most recently, North Korea threatened to
pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera
tion of Nuclear Weapons, thereby allowing it
to evade any international legal troubles in
pursuance of nuclear advancement.
Most agree that the situation is serious, and
it is one that campus organizations have dis
cussed. However, the general consensus
seems to be that the circumstances are beyond
the immediate influence of college students.
Therefore, instead of activism, a policy of ed
ucation is being followed.
"We are mobilizing to support stiffer action
against North Korea, but, as college students,
we are sometimes limited by what we can do,"
Fairbanks said. "We are continuing to edu
cate our members and any Stanford students

willing to listen on the North Korea
issue, and when people are exposed
to the facts, then they are more will
ing to support stiller action against
this brutal regime."
The Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, which has played
an active role in the anti-war move
ment, has not had meetings specifi
cally addressing Korea.
"The fact that we're not meeting
about this indicates primarily that
we don't take much offense with
what the current administration is
pursuing," said senior Calvin Miaw,
coordinator of SCPJ. "Our princi
ple is to change things, but what we
currendy see in the Bush adminis
tration with regard to [North]
Korea is diplomacy and peace, and
we don't see a need to change any
thing there."
Among those who have followed
the developments regarding North
Korea, student sentiments seem to
echo Miaw's stance.
"I think that the administration's
less confrontational approach to
North Korea, while it has many

problems, is certainly a better one,"
said Derek Kilner, a freshman. "But
I also think that it highlights the ad
ministration's hypocrisy in choos
ing which regimes require military
intervention. We need to re-exam
