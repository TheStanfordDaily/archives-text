# Activists stay silent on Korea
## Student groups show little reaction to the Bush administrations Korea policy 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though campus groups have been mobi
lized by the Bush administration's policy on
Iraq, many Stanford activists have not taken a
stance on the nuclear standoff with North
Korea.
"President Bush is not publicly focusing on
North Korea," said Stanford College Repub
licans President Joe Fairbanks, a sophomore,
in reference to students' relative apathy to
ward the Korean situation. "Obviously, the
administration is paying more attention to the
situation than we, the public, see on TV and
in our papers."
North Korea disclosed in October that it

had renewed its efforts to develop nuclear
weapons, despite the country's 1994 agree
ment to halt all nuclear activities and to allow
full inspections of its materials and facilities.
Most recently, North Korea threatened to
pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera
tion of Nuclear Weapons, thereby allowing it
to evade any international legal troubles in
pursuance of nuclear advancement.
Most agree that the situation is serious, and
it is one that campus organizations have dis
cussed. However, the general consensus
seems to be that the circumstances are beyond
the immediate influence of college students.
Therefore, instead of activism, a policy of ed
ucation is being followed.
"We are mobilizing to support stiffer action
against North Korea, but, as college students,
we are sometimes limited by what we can do,"
Fairbanks said. "We are continuing to edu
cate our members and any Stanford students
