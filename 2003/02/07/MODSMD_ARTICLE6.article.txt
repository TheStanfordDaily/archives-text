# Optimistic Dell president discusses ethics, economy
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kevin Rollins, president and chief op
erating officer of Dell Computer Corp.,
visited campus yesterday to talk with the
University's Chief Information Officer
Chris Handley and Dean of the Gradu
ate School of Business Robert Joss.
In the wake of corporate scandals
and renewed focus on ethics in busi
ness, Rollins has worked to maintain a
focus on the "soul of Dell." While he
considers Dell's corporate culture ini

dative unique to the company, it has
many features that make it broadly ap
plicable to a corporate world looking to
recover from a tarnished image.
Rollins oversees a company that has
grown even in the current economic
slump. Dell has more employees this
year than it did last year and is actively
expanding into everything from print
ers to cash registers, though the results
of the expansion remain to be seen. For
Rollins, everything can be shaped by a
business model, and he said Dell's di
rect business model can sell much more

than computers.
The Daily sat down to talk with him
about his experience dealing with busi
ness ethics in the real world and the de
pressed economy.
The Daily: Why are you visiting
Stanford?
Kevin Rollins: Stanford has been a
very long-standing and very valued
customer. So basically, it's an opportu
nity for me to meet with some of your
technology people, see how things are

going and get a little feedback on what
we've been doing.
Secondly, we hire a lot of Stanford
Business School graduates, so it's a
chance for me to meet the dean of the
Business School, find out how things
are going and what he's seeing on the
horizon.
TD: What advice would you give to stu
dents graduating, especially in
technology fields?
KR: I'm a huge advocate of getting
as much education as you can.
There's always room in jobs for top
people. Spend your time in school
becoming the very best you can be,
and you will have a job, period.
I think at this particular time
you're going to find that it is a dif
ficult environment and you're
going to have to use all the net
works and all the opportunities
you can to find every available job.
You'll probably have to reset ex
pectations in the short term
for . . . the pay level that you can
possibly get versus . . . historical
norms. I think that's just the reali
ty that we all have to get our heads
around, that we're in a slow mar
ket and in slow markets wages are
more difficult to come by.
TD: What do you see as the role of
a business school in teaching
ethics?
KR: I think fundamentally, ethics
are taught long before students get
to business school. If you're having
to have an ethics lesson because you
don't know right from wrong by the

time you get to school, you've got
some other problems. But 1 think
what happens is that some folks, as
they move into the world, want to
know if what they have been taught
[as their conception of ethics] is
going to be accepted.
I think one of the things that the
business schools can do is reinforce
the value of fundamental ethics,
honesty and integrity ... as they
talk with their students about [hon
esty and integrity] being the only ap
propriate policy, being very careful
to not go to the level of, "Well if its
legal, it's OK." I do think that it can
come across that the legal hurdle is
die hurdle you have to worry about,
and all odiers are incidental.
TD: Just like Dell, Enron kept ex
panding into new markets, new
opportunities. How do you keep
the culture at Dell from becoming
too obsessed with growth?
KR: First of all, we need to create
an environment where people
are comfortable following funda
mental ethics. In some compa
nies there is a culture that's de
veloped that would suggest man
agement do not want to hear
about [inappropriate behavior].
If you create that kind of culture,
employees learn pretty quickly
that if you challenge that unethi

cal behavior you might pay for it.
So you have to . . . set the culture
up so that there are ways where
employees, if they see unethical
behavior, can report it without
retribution. You set those up
and, lo and behold, you get com
panies that don't do a lot of
things wrong.
I don't think we have the same
challenges as Enron. We're not
trying to create a new market.
We're fundamentally taking our
business model and adding new
products that are not new to the
world, they're just new to Dell.

TD: Do you think the tech econo
my will pick up any time soon?
KR: Well, our company does
quite well during economic
downturns.
The technology sector's very
correlated with the economy.
When the economy does well, the
technology sector does well.
Right now, the economy's not
doing well. In the short term,
until we see an upturn in the
economy, we're not forecasting,
nor do we think we will see an up
turn in overall technology.

Kevin Rollins, president and chief op
erating officer of Dell Computer Corp.,
visited campus yesterday to talk with the
University's Chief Information Officer
Chris Handley and Dean of the Gradu
ate School of Business Robert Joss.
In the wake of corporate scandals
and renewed focus on ethics in busi
ness, Rollins has worked to maintain a
focus on the "soul of Dell." While he
considers Dell's corporate culture ini

dative unique to the company, it has
many features that make it broadly ap
plicable to a corporate world looking to
recover from a tarnished image.
Rollins oversees a company that has
grown even in the current economic
slump. Dell has more employees this
year than it did last year and is actively
expanding into everything from print
ers to cash registers, though the results
of the expansion remain to be seen. For
Rollins, everything can be shaped by a
business model, and he said Dell's di
rect business model can sell much more

than computers.
The Daily sat down to talk with him
about his experience dealing with busi
ness ethics in the real world and the de
pressed economy.
The Daily: Why are you visiting
Stanford?
Kevin Rollins: Stanford has been a
very long-standing and very valued
customer. So basically, it's an opportu
nity for me to meet with some of your
technology people, see how things are

going and get a little feedback on what
we've been doing.
Secondly, we hire a lot of Stanford
Business School graduates, so it's a
chance for me to meet the dean of the
Business School, find out how things
are going and what he's seeing on the
horizon.
TD: What advice would you give to stu
dents graduating, especially in
technology fields?
KR: I'm a huge advocate of getting
as much education as you can.
There's always room in jobs for top
people. Spend your time in school
becoming the very best you can be,
and you will have a job, period.
I think at this particular time
you're going to find that it is a dif
ficult environment and you're
going to have to use all the net
works and all the opportunities
you can to find every available job.
You'll probably have to reset ex
pectations in the short term
for . . . the pay level that you can
possibly get versus . . . historical
norms. I think that's just the reali
ty that we all have to get our heads
around, that we're in a slow mar
ket and in slow markets wages are
more difficult to come by.
TD: What do you see as the role of
a business school in teaching
ethics?
KR: I think fundamentally, ethics
are taught long before students get
to business school. If you're having
to have an ethics lesson because you
don't know right from wrong by the

time you get to school, you've got
some other problems. But 1 think
what happens is that some folks, as
they move into the world, want to
know if what they have been taught
[as their conception of ethics] is
going to be accepted.
I think one of the things that the
business schools can do is reinforce
the value of fundamental ethics,
honesty and integrity ... as they
talk with their students about [hon
esty and integrity] being the only ap
propriate policy, being very careful
to not go to the level of, "Well if its
legal, it's OK." I do think that it can
come across that the legal hurdle is
die hurdle you have to worry about,
and all odiers are incidental.
TD: Just like Dell, Enron kept ex
panding into new markets, new
opportunities. How do you keep
the culture at Dell from becoming
too obsessed with growth?
KR: First of all, we need to create
an environment where people
are comfortable following funda
mental ethics. In some compa
nies there is a culture that's de
veloped that would suggest man
agement do not want to hear
about [inappropriate behavior].
If you create that kind of culture,
employees learn pretty quickly
that if you challenge that unethi

cal behavior you might pay for it.
So you have to . . . set the culture
up so that there are ways where
employees, if they see unethical
behavior, can report it without
retribution. You set those up
and, lo and behold, you get com
panies that don't do a lot of
things wrong.
I don't think we have the same
challenges as Enron. We're not
trying to create a new market.
We're fundamentally taking our
business model and adding new
products that are not new to the
world, they're just new to Dell.

TD: Do you think the tech econo
my will pick up any time soon?
KR: Well, our company does
quite well during economic
downturns.
The technology sector's very
correlated with the economy.
When the economy does well, the
technology sector does well.
Right now, the economy's not
doing well. In the short term,
until we see an upturn in the
economy, we're not forecasting,
nor do we think we will see an up
turn in overall technology.
