# Optimistic Dell president discusses ethics, economy
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kevin Rollins, president and chief op
erating officer of Dell Computer Corp.,
visited campus yesterday to talk with the
University's Chief Information Officer
Chris Handley and Dean of the Gradu
ate School of Business Robert Joss.
In the wake of corporate scandals
and renewed focus on ethics in busi
ness, Rollins has worked to maintain a
focus on the "soul of Dell." While he
considers Dell's corporate culture ini

dative unique to the company, it has
many features that make it broadly ap
plicable to a corporate world looking to
recover from a tarnished image.
Rollins oversees a company that has
grown even in the current economic
slump. Dell has more employees this
year than it did last year and is actively
expanding into everything from print
ers to cash registers, though the results
of the expansion remain to be seen. For
Rollins, everything can be shaped by a
business model, and he said Dell's di
rect business model can sell much more

than computers.
The Daily sat down to talk with him
about his experience dealing with busi
ness ethics in the real world and the de
pressed economy.
The Daily: Why are you visiting
Stanford?
Kevin Rollins: Stanford has been a
very long-standing and very valued
customer. So basically, it's an opportu
nity for me to meet with some of your
technology people, see how things are

going and get a little feedback on what
we've been doing.
Secondly, we hire a lot of Stanford
Business School graduates, so it's a
chance for me to meet the dean of the
Business School, find out how things
are going and what he's seeing on the
horizon.
TD: What advice would you give to stu
dents graduating, especially in
technology fields?
