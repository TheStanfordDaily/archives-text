# Commission delays Foothills zoning
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon in San
Jose, the Santa Clara County
Planning Commission decided to
postpone making its final deci
sion on future hillside zoning
regulations for the Foothills until
March 6, in light of a progress re
port presented by county staff
planners.
When the commission meets to
make its final decision, there will
be further presentations from
various interest groups including
University representatives and
organizations such as the Stan
ford Open Space Alliance and the
Committee for Green Foothills.
Members of these groups have
mixed interpretations about the
current proposals.
"We're digesting the report,"
said committee representative
Peter Drekmeier. "It looks like it
could offer some promise or
could be used to limit the
amount of protection."
Zoning regulations to protect
environmental resources and
the view-shed of the Foothills
are a central concern of local
conservation groups, including
the alliance and the committee.
According to the alliance's Web
site, "the zoning for the Stan

ford Foothills determines the lo
cation and scale of allowable de
velopment [in these lands] over
the course of this and future use
permits."
Protection of the view-shed is,
according to alliance member J.
Segal, "critical in order to pre
serve the spirit of the contract
[made by the University]."
Neither the alliance nor the

committee believe that the current
community plan is incorporating
protection of the view-shed. A
committee memo stated, "the
Board of Supervisors unanimous
ly established a policy indicating
that development should be limit
ed to lands below 200 feet in eleva
tion, to protect the view-shed and

ridgelines from visible hillside de
velopment." However, under the
current zoning plan, commercial
antennas are permissible.
Local groups are also uneasy
about giving the Architectural
and Site Approval Committee,
comprised of county staff plan
ners, the authority to make zon
ing decisions. As employees
rather than elected representa
tives, Drekmeier suggested that
these planners may not be suffi
ciently accountable to the public.
Preferable for the committee
and the alliance would be to
make the planning commission
the primary decision-maker for
the zoning process.
In general, members of the
Stanford community remain
concerned regarding the devel
opment and use of the Foothills.

In December 2000, Stanford
agreed to build two trails in com
pensation for development
planned under the General Use
Permit expansion plan. Plans for
these trails, submitted by the
University in 2001, were unpop
ular. The planning commission
continued working on five possi
ble trail options that would satis
fy both community and Univer
sity needs.
In December 2002, three of
these options were dropped by
the planning commission. This
was a disappointment to groups
such as the alliance and the com
mittee. According to Drekmeier,
the University "took the two best
trails off the list."
Two trail options remain,
called CI and SI. The CI trail
runs near Alpine and Sandhill
Roads and the SI trail passes
near Matadero Creek. A position
paper regarding the CI trail re
mains to be finalized by the com
mittee. This paper discusses two

proposed routes for the CI trail,
describing one as the "optimum
route" and the second, endorsed
by the University, as a "glorified
sidewalk." Proposals regarding
the CI trail are currently sus
pended due to a legal dispute
between the county and home
owners in that area. The SI trail
is actively being discussed and
three alignments are under con
sideration.
University representatives
consider the current situation
with the Foothills satisfactory.
Work is also underway to restore
grasses native to the Foothill area.
According to Larry Horton, asso
ciate vice president and director
of government and community
relations, Stanford is committed
to sustainable development and
open to proposals from the com
munity. Horton also pointed out
that a great deal of research, like
the Jasper Ridge Sustainable De
velopment Project, is currently
underway in the Foothills.
