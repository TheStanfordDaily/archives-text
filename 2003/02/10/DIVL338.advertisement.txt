This long-awaited work from one
of the world's most respected
scientists presents a series of
dramatic discoveries never before
made public. Starting from a
collection of simple computer
experiments-illustrated in the
book by striking computer
graphics-Wolfram shows how
their unexpected results force a
whole new way of looking at the
operation of our universe.
Wolfram uses his approach to
tackle a remarkable array of
fundamental problems in science:
from the origin of the Second
Law of thermodynamics, to the
development of complexity in
biology, the computational
limitations of mathematics, the
possibility of a truly fundamental
theory of physics, and the
interplay between free will and
determinism. Written with
exceptional clarity, and illustrated
by more than a thousand original
pictures, this seminal book allows
scientists and non-scientists alike
to participate in what promises to
be a major intellectual revolution.
