Health costs burden students
Despite subsidies,

Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.
If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per
centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23
and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person

EPATT panelists share tutoring insights

On Friday, nearly 100 Stanford East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring tutors
joined with members from area com
munities in a panel discussion on the
challenges that tutored students face in
East Palo Alto and what tutors can do
to become more effective instructors.
"This panel is for you," said East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring head
coordinator Kesha Weekes, who
opened the panel. "It's about practi
cality — for this week, not far off down
the road. This is about real-life skills
for you to go off and apply."
EPATT is a Stanford-run commu
nity service program that connects
Stanford students with residents of
East Palo Alto.
The panel consisted of Dean of Ed
ucation Deborah Stipek; Reverend
Jim Burklo, a campus minister and
leader of Reality Check Tours, a tour
of the economic and social realities of
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto; Meleini
Talakai, a mother of children tutored
through EPATT; and two high school
students tutored by EPATT since they
were in elementary school.
Stipek began the panel with an
overview of what she deemed the criti
cal ingredients in "learning motivation"
— competence and confidence, a feel
ing of control and connection.
Stipek and the other panelists of
fered suggestions on how tutors could
put these abstract traits into practice.
Many tutors had specific questions
about how best to interact with the kids
they tutor, though most felt that they
were already unconsciously using the
basic techniques.
"Does this stuff sound familiar to
you guys?" Stipek asked when ex
plaining the importance of encourage
ment coupled with critical feedback
and received a unanimous affirmative
head nod in response.
Talakai gave a powerful testimonial
about the important role that EPATT
has played for her and her children. A
college-educated woman from Tonga,
Talakai moved to East Palo Alto,
where she has raised her five children
alone.
While she works as a nurse at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, she said that most of
her peers work as babysitters or land
scapes because they lack the education
to find any other jobs. All five ofTalakai's
children are involved with EPATT, and
Talakai praised the program.
"We [East Palo Alto parents] have
very lofty hopes for our kids, but we
often think that having them in school
is enough," she said. "I wouldn't nor
mally think that I could do something
about it. Most of us don't think it be
hooves us to help our kids, and we as
sume failures are the teacher's fault. So
you're doing the things that we don't
get to do, either because we're working
or we don't know how to help our kids.
We are pure people who struggle every
day. Most of us have two or three jobs,
trying to make ends meet. Kids are ex

joined with members from area com

challenges that tutored students face in
East Palo Alto and what tutors can do
to become more effective instructors.
"This panel is for you," said East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring head
coordinator Kesha Weekes, who
opened the panel. "It's about practi

EPATT is a Stanford-run commu

The panel consisted of Dean of Ed

leader of Reality Check Tours, a tour
of the economic and social realities of
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto; Meleini

overview of what she deemed the criti

put these abstract traits into practice.
Many tutors had specific questions
about how best to interact with the kids

"Does this stuff sound familiar to

Talakai gave a powerful testimonial
about the important role that EPATT

college-educated woman from Tonga,
Talakai moved to East Palo Alto,
where she has raised her five children
alone.
While she works as a nurse at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, she said that most of
her peers work as babysitters or land

Health costs burden students
Despite subsidies,
care costs rise for
grad students
BY VINAY JAIN
CONTRIBUTING WRITER
Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.
If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per
centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23
and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person
pays out-of-pocket before the insur
ance takes over. But HMOs require
seeing a single doctor for all treat

After becoming one of the only groups
from a major university ever to obtain the
rights to perform the"The Four Tempera

preparing to put on world-famous choreo
grapher George Balanchine's neo-classical
ballet on April 5 and 6. Balanchine's work
was showcased in the popular movie, "Cen

Last December, the student-run ballet
group acquired the rights to present the
renowned piece to the Stanford community

"This is an enormous opportunity," said

Balanchine is considered to be one of the

The perceived political rift between the United

Emmott, addressing the potential war with Iraq
and the United States' role in international trade and

both a short-term and long-term framework. A self
proclaimed "non-European European" and recent
author of "20/21 Vision," a book that analyzes global
politics and economics, Emmott aimed to speak from
a world perspective rather than argue from a Euro

With respect to short-term policy in Iraq, Emmott
spoke of a conflict over words between Europe and

"In the trans-Atlantic debate, there is a lot more

more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single

However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's

After becoming one of the only groups
from a major university ever to obtain the
rights to perform the"The Four Tempera

preparing to put on world-famous choreo
grapher George Balanchine's neo-classical
ballet on April 5 and 6. Balanchine's work
was showcased in the popular movie, "Cen

Last December, the student-run ballet
group acquired the rights to present the
renowned piece to the Stanford community
and the general public. Colleen Neary, a
former dancer with the New York City Bal

chine himself, is training the group.
"This is an enormous opportunity," said
Cardinal Ballet faculty advisor Kristine El

ballet and working with one of its finest per

Balanchine is considered to be one of the
greatest 20th-century choreographers and
is credited with making the transition from
classical to modern ballet.

The perceived political rift between the United

magazine, in his speech to a full auditorium last Fri
day at the Graduate School of Business.
Emmott, addressing the potential war with Iraq
and the United States' role in international trade and
security, discussed European-American relations in
both a short-term and long-term framework. A self
proclaimed "non-European European" and recent
author of "20/21 Vision," a book that analyzes global
politics and economics, Emmott aimed to speak from
a world perspective rather than argue from a Euro

With respect to short-term policy in Iraq, Emmott
spoke of a conflict over words between Europe and
the United States, but argued there was an underly

"In the trans-Atlantic debate, there is a lot more
emphasis on the speaking Rumsfeld than there is

said Emmott, referring to the common European

EPATT panelists share tutoring insights

On Friday, nearly 100 Stanford East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring tutors
joined with members from area com
munities in a panel discussion on the
challenges that tutored students face in
East Palo Alto and what tutors can do
to become more effective instructors.
"This panel is for you," said East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring head
coordinator Kesha Weekes, who
opened the panel. "It's about practi
cality — for this week, not far off down
the road. This is about real-life skills
for you to go off and apply."
EPATT is a Stanford-run commu
nity service program that connects
Stanford students with residents of
East Palo Alto.
The panel consisted of Dean of Ed
ucation Deborah Stipek; Reverend
Jim Burklo, a campus minister and
leader of Reality Check Tours, a tour
of the economic and social realities of
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto; Meleini
Talakai, a mother of children tutored
through EPATT; and two high school
students tutored by EPATT since they
were in elementary school.
Stipek began the panel with an
overview of what she deemed the criti
cal ingredients in "learning motivation"
— competence and confidence, a feel
ing of control and connection.
Stipek and the other panelists of
fered suggestions on how tutors could
put these abstract traits into practice.
Many tutors had specific questions
about how best to interact with the kids
they tutor, though most felt that they
were already unconsciously using the
basic techniques.
"Does this stuff sound familiar to
you guys?" Stipek asked when ex
plaining the importance of encourage
ment coupled with critical feedback
and received a unanimous affirmative
head nod in response.
Talakai gave a powerful testimonial
about the important role that EPATT
has played for her and her children. A
college-educated woman from Tonga,
Talakai moved to East Palo Alto,
where she has raised her five children
alone.
While she works as a nurse at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, she said that most of
her peers work as babysitters or land
scapes because they lack the education
to find any other jobs. All five ofTalakai's
children are involved with EPATT, and
Talakai praised the program.
"We [East Palo Alto parents] have
very lofty hopes for our kids, but we
often think that having them in school
is enough," she said. "I wouldn't nor
mally think that I could do something
about it. Most of us don't think it be

you're doing the things that we don't

Res Ed reviews frat
housing probations

The Greek Housing Review
Board completed its annual re
view of Stanford's housed frater
nities and sororities last Friday,
ending Kappa Sigma's housing
probation and extending Sigma
Alpha Epsilon's probation for
three months. In addition,
Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi
were placed on housing proba
tion effective this current winter
quarter through December
2003, and Delta Delta Delta re
ceived a letter of commendation
for its compliance with housing
requirements.
"We have a commitment to
make Greek housing as produc
tive and fulfilling as it can be,"
said Co-Chair of the Review
Board and Associate Director of
Residential Education John Ju
dicki. "We hope that Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Chi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon will take this op
portunity to reevaluate their
strengths and areas for needed
improvement in order to better
the chapter, the Greek commu
nity, and Stanford."
Housed Greek chapters are
reviewed on a number of criteria
such as membership and occu
pancy, financial status and con
duct. The review board's recom
mendations are reviewed and
approved by Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camaril
lo. Review after probation can
result in the probation being lift
ed or extended — or a chapter
can lose its housing.
"I am really encouraged by
the progress of Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon dur
ing their probations," said se
nior Jordan Connors, Interfra

"They have grown a lot as orga
nizations and are better for it."
The review board said that
Kappa Sig's demonstrated im

probation, which has been effec

"Kappa Sig is on their way to
being one of strongest chapters
on campus if they continue the
way they have been going," said
review boards member Joey

Health costs burden students
Despite subsidies,
care costs rise for
grad students
BY VINAY JAIN
CONTRIBUTING WRITER
Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.
If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
