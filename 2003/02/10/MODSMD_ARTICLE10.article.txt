Senator Gary Hart to speak on foreign policy
Former presidential candidate Gary Hart will speak Tuesday at the
Law School on the topic of "Principled Engagement: A New Foreign Pol
icy Framework." The former senator, a Democrat, represented Col
orado from 1974 to 1986 and ran for president twice, in 1984 and 1988.
His second run ended in scandal and Hart has been in what he describes
as "exile" ever since.
Hart says he is contemplating a presidential bid for 2004, and his lec
ture at Stanford will be part of a six* to eight-week lecture series that will
help him decide in March.
In 1999, Hart and the commission he chaired, the U.S. Commission
on National Security for the 21st Century, predicted an imminent ter
rorist attack on American soil. Hart also called fora Department of
Homeland Security nine months before Sept. 11.
"Senator Hart is a distinguished public servant with an impressive
record of foreign policy expertise," said Jeremiah Frei-Pearson of the
American Constitution Society, a sponsor of the talk. "Given the dan
gerous times in which we live, the Senator's views on national security are
especially relevant to all Americans."
Jeff Halper to speak on rebuilding Palestinian
homes
Jeff Halper, professor of anthropology at Ben-Gurion University of
the Negev and coordinator of the Israeli Committee against House De
molitions, will discuss his campaign and his proposals for Israeli-Pales
tinian peace on Tuesday. His talk will be called "Under the Cover of
War" and will address the increase in the Israeli government's demoli
tions of Palestinian houses in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Born in Minnesota, Halper has lived in Israel since 1973 and cam
paigned for peace. He has been imprisoned periodically for lying down
between bulldozers and houses in protest. His trip to the Bay Area is
being sponsored by the Rebuilding Homes Campaign.
"Jeff Halper and a number of others had five years ago begun re
building houses as a form of constructive resistance to the occupation,"
said Donna Baranski-Walker, campaign manager of the Rebuilding
Homes Campaign. "There've been nearly 10,000 houses demolished
since 1967, and only 578 are reported by an Israeli human rights orga
nization as being cited as punishment demolitions, where someone in
the extended family had something to do with a militant or terrorist at
tack," Baranski-Walker said.
"That means 9,422 houses have been demolished and that has noth
ing to do with accused terrorism," she said. "Those are the houses we're
rebuilding."
