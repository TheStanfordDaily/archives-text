## Inspectors meet with Iraq officials 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — The U.N. chief
weapons inspectors emerged from key talks
with Iraq officials yesterday, saying they saw
signs of a "change of heart" from Baghdad over
disarmament demands and that further U.N.
inspections were preferable to a quick U.S.-led
military strike.
In two days of meetings with Hans Blix and
Mohamed Elßaradei, Iraq officials handed
over documents on anthrax, VX nerve gas
and missile development. But Blix said there
was still no immediate agreement on a key de
mand, using American U-2 surveillance
planes to help inspections.
"We are not at all at the end of the road,"
Blix told The Associated Press. "But neverthe
less I'm bound to note, to register, nuances and
this I think was a new nuance."
Both Blix and Elßaradei avoided saying
they were convinced Iraq now was ready to co
operate fully with the inspection program. Blix
quipped that the "proof is in the pudding."
However, their comments about signs of
change likely will strengthen calls by France,
Germany, Russia, China and others to allow
more time for inspections — possibly several
months — and undermine U.S. efforts to win
support for an imminent military showdown.
The weekend session, ahead of Blix and El-
Baradei's report this week to the U.N. Security
Council, could help decide the next steps taken
by the council in the months-long standoff that
has left the Middle East suspended between
war and peace.
But with tens of thousands of American
troops in the Persian Gulf preparing for war,
President Bush reiterated yesterday that it
was time for action against Iraqi leader Sad

dam Hussein.
"[Saddam] wants the world to think that
hide-and-seek is a game that we should play.
And it's over," Bush told congressional Re
publicans at a policy conference. "It's a mo
ment of truth for the United Nations. The
United Nations gets to decide shortly whether
or not it is going to be relevant in terms of
keeping the peace, whether or not its words
mean anything."
Asked yesterday about Blix's statement,
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer noted
that Bush has said, "Given the fact that Saddam
Hussein is not disarming, time is running out."
However, the United States was faced re
newed opposition in Europe to an Iraq war.
Germany's defense minister said yesterday that
Germany and France would present a propos
al to the Security Council next week to send

U.N. soldiers to disarm Iraq — a plan U.S. offi
cials denounced as ineffective.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin,
whose country holds veto powers on the coun
cil — reiterated his strong opposition to mili
tary action against Baghdad.
"We are convinced that efforts fora peaceful
resolution of the situation regarding Iraq
should be persistently continued," Putin told
journalists after talks with Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Berlin.
Putin also rejected U.S. goals of a regime
change in Iraq. "The task of reckoning with
Saddam Hussein does not stand before us,"
Putin said. "There is nothing in the U.N. Char
ter that would allow the U.N. Security Council
to make a decision to change the political
regime of one country or another — whether
we like that regime or not."
