# Bar Association to condemn Bush plan
## 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) â€” The nation's
largest lawyers' group is set to
condemn the government's re
fusal to give legal rights to Amer
ican enemy combatants, part of
the Bush administration's ter
rorism fighting strategy.
The American Bar Associa
tion also is expected to press for
more openness about govern
ment surveillance in the United
States.
The war on terror has been a
prominent theme at the associa
tion's winter meeting in Seattle,
a port city where signs of the
heightened terror alert were ev
ident with tighter security on the
water, at the airport and the
state border with Canada.
ABA leaders will vote as early
as today on the proposal calling
for lawyers to be provided to
Americans and U.S. residents
held as combatants to help them
argue in court that their deten
tions are illegal.
The government will not re
lease the names of those held as
combatants, and only a couple of
examples of detentions in Amer
ica are widely known. The most
high profile is Jose Padilla, ac
cused of plotting to detonate a
"dirty" bomb, which would use a
conventional explosive to
spread radioactive material.
Enemy combatants, a type of
wartime prisoner, are held with

out charge or trial and are not al
lowed to see lawyers.
Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett
said it is un-American to deny
legal rights to Americans or any
one else in the country when
they are apprehended.
"We cannot allow individual
rights to be eroded as part of the
war on terror," Sonnett said.
Supporting the govern
ment's policy is David Rivkin Jr.,
a lawyer from Washington,
D.C., who said the administra
tion has foiled crimes with infor
mation obtained from combat
ants. Giving them lawyers would
ruin interrogations and threat
en the public, Rivkin said.
"If we go in that direction it
will disrupt our ability to stop at
tacks and a lot of people are
going to die," Rivkin said yester
day during a debate with Son
nett at an event joindy spon
sored by the ABA and the more
conservative Federalist Society.
The resolution was being re
vised to satisfy some critics, by
spelling out that judges could
impose restrictions on lawyer
combatant meetings so that na
tional security is not compro
mised.
The lawyers' group also is
weighing in on the increased
surveillance power Congress
gave the government after the
Sept. 11 attacks.
