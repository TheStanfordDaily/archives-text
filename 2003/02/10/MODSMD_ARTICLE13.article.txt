## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Not making the grade

As students and community
members living, working and
studying in an educational en
vironment, it's difficult to
imagine that our nation's leaders would
fail to place education as a top priority in
the budget. But the state of schools in
California is something all of us should
be concerned with, on both political and
personal levels.
On Jan. 30, the state Senate passed a
controversial plan that would soften reg
ulations on the 20-student per class cap
in California schools. The proposal is the
result of a series of strategies planned to
accommodate the expected $34.6 billion
budget shortfall in California, which has
forced government and education offi
cials to cut education spending. Howev
er, we believe that increasing class sizes
will likely place California students and
teachers at a great

tion in California makes up approxi
mately 25 percent of the total state popu
lation. Of these 8.5 million people, one in
three lives in a household where the pri
mary source of income comes from an
agricultural job. High quality education
for the children of these workers is essen
tial to assure that they are offered equal
opportunities later on in their academic
and professional careers.
Making class sizes larger will inevitably
hurt California's students and make it
more difficult for them to succeed in high
schools and university environments.
This issue is especially pertinent to the
academic quality of future Stanford class
es, given that over 40 percent of Stanford
students are from California.
Although parental and peer support,
as well as personal effort, played a major
role in providing Stanford students with
the education to at-

disadvantage.
Currently, Cali
fornia's student-to
teacher ratio in
kindergarten
through third-grade
classes is the second
worst in the nation.

the education system that has
helped them get to where they are
today"

tend a prestigious
college, there is no
doubt that schools
and teachers also
played a major part.
Caring, attentive
teachers helped
many students pur
sue their passions
and reach their aca-

to grow to 22 students, placing Califor
nia's student-to-teacher ratio dead last in
the country. While this two student per
class increase may not seem like a large
change, it would set the precedent for fu
ture class increases whenever the budget
needed to be cut.
Proponents of the plan argue that the
change would save $200 million a year
statewide insofar that keeping smaller
classes demands hiring more teachers
and finding more classroom space.
While this may be true, the benefits
reaped by the students are well worth the
price: both the California Teachers Asso
ciation and the U.S. Department of Edu
cation support smaller classes. If our na
tion's experts believe smaller classes are
more effective, then why are we compro
mising the education of the next genera
tion when other cuts can be made in the
budget?
In a state as diverse as California,
where many students come into schools
with English as a second language, a re
duction in attention would likely have
adverse results. According the 2000 U.S.
census, the total Mexican-origin popula

demic and extracurricular goals.
Consequently, students should give
back to the education system that has
helped them get to where they are
today. Students can help by writing
their representatives to keep education
as a high priority in the state and feder
al budgets, or by directly participating
in local schools and making a personal
difference.
Stanford students have laudably
spent many hours tutoring elementary,
middle and high school students
around the area and their efforts are
deserving of praise. If class sizes contin
ue to increase, there will be more of a
need for these tutoring programs to as
sure that students from nearby school
districts continue to improve in test
scores and college enrollment.
While education officials and politi
cians continue to debate this issue in the
lofty buildings of the state Senate, par
ents, teachers and tutors must continue
to support students to ensure that the
future generations of the California
school system receive the education
they deserve.
