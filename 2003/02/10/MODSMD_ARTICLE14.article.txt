# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## The 						golden days of Stanford 
### 
Listen here: We're the
new Monday crew that
will occupy this space,
and we're going to tell
you a little about ourselves.
She's a little bit country; he's a
little bit rock 'n' roll. That's us in a
nutshell. One is an opinionated
sorority girl. The other one is a
dweeby guy who can't dance to
save his life. Together, we form a
pair who could get drunk from a
total of four drinks.
She always votes Republican
and cannot stand people who
smoke. He is a Democrat who in
haled.
The one place on the campus
where we could have possibly
met?
A frat party, of course. Where
else can you have a conversation
without talking about grades and
classes? Where else can you remi
nisce about your freshman dorm
experience?
We decided that Stanford ain't
what it used to be. So ever since
that fateful moment, we've dis
cussed our "Golden Days" of col
lege. We have a similar back
ground in the sense that we are
both juniors and share a common
nostalgia for the past.
Back in the day, before "Invita
tion Only" parties were the norm,
one of us was running away from
sketchy graduate students, while
the other one was with his friends,
clinging to his foamy red cup at
one particular keg-soaked display
of youthful debauchery. Now
some of you newer members of
the Stanford community may be
confused at this point because
what we are describing no longer
exists.
Once upon a time, every week
on Thursday, Friday and Satur

day nights there was a place
(granted, it moved around) where
your Computer Science nerd,
your I-Hum-saturated freshman
and your networking ASSU
wannabe could all congregate and
escape the everyday drudgery of
student life: midterms, problem
sets and mountains of reading.
Fraternities competed with
each other to see which one could

draw the biggest crowds. Today
they see who can stay off of alcohol
probation the longest or minimize
their sentences once infractions
are prosecuted (after they in
evitably occur).
During this "Golden Age," it
seemed that the University took
an active interest in furthering
the social atmosphere on cam
pus. The Alumni Association
sponsored Full Moon on the
Quad. Then there was the once
star-studded event, the annual
Ma usoleum Party on Hal
loween, which once featured the
infamous, booty-lovin' Sir Mix
a-Lot.
Before the words "Buddy
Teevens" entered our vocabu
lary, we had Tyrone. For those of
you who are not avid football fol
lowers, Coach Tyrone Willing
ham led us to seven (yes seven!)
straight Big Game wins and a
trip to the Rose Bowl. We cannot
guarantee causation, but there is
definitely a strong correlation

between the untimely depar
tures of the social scene and Ty
rone. Some say he's in a better
place now.
These changes are particularly
crippling to the Stanford bubble
because we live on a campus de
signed to be self-contained. Har
bored in a suburban oasis, our off
campus social options are scarce
and prohibitively expensive.
Those of us under the age of 21
face a particular dearth of social
options. On Saturday night, we
were so elated after we were noti
fied that we would be writing this
column, that we just had to go do
something at the "early" hour of 9
p.m. After driving around the
greater Palo Alto region for an
hour, we realized that if you are
not hungry, not 21 and not in the
mood to see "Kangaroo Jack," the
best place to go is Borders Book
store (yes, we are embarrassed to
admit this sad, sad fact).
Tragically, the most heavily im
pacted members of our student
body are the car-less freshmen.
What do they do? Go to the Stan
ford Bookstore? Oh wait, it's
closed already. Clearly this issue
has gained the attention of the
ASSU, who have done their best to
alleviate the situation, giving stu
dents the option of late night bus
ing to the city. But we all know this
solution is little more than a Band-
Aid on a broken leg.
So who's benefiting from these
dark times? It's not the police,
who have been deprived of their
traditional task: loitering in the
lower Row on patrol for underage
drinkers. Now, their occupational
duties have dwindled. They stop
bikers without lights.



Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi

Most people blame the University for
promoting these social changes to benefit
itself. We believe there is a far more insid
ious source for this void of social options:
Residential Education.

Residential Education lackeys, com
monly known as RAs, have been trying to
accrue decent turnouts at their dorm pro
gramming events since 1912 (or whenev
er they established the dorm system).
They realized the only way to force resi
dents to attend hug workshops and study
breaks on Thursday nights is to take away
every other possible social option. The
only choice students have, if they want to
escape their personal academic hell, is to

"Come on the down to the lounge for
some dorm lovin'!"
Their misplaced, albeit well-inten
tioned enthusiasm has gone too far.
So let's get back to the basics.
She's in favor of increased defense
spending, i.e. making police officers re
sponsible for keeping high school stu
dents out of frat parties. He would like
to see a more liberal social agenda on
campus, i.e. legalizing pot and alcohol

for everyone.
Basically, this dichotomy of opinion
translates into our fighting like cats and
dogs or techies and fuzzies, as the case
may be. There should be some entertain
ing mudslinging and hopefully you're
gonna get dirty too.

one particular keg-soaked display
of youthful debauchery. Now
some of you newer members of
the Stanford community may be
confused at this point because
what we are describing no longer
exists.
Once upon a time, every week
on Thursday, Friday and Satur

day nights there was a place
(granted, it moved around) where
your Computer Science nerd,
your I-Hum-saturated freshman
and your networking ASSU
wannabe could all congregate and
escape the everyday drudgery of
student life: midterms, problem
sets and mountains of reading.
Fraternities competed with
each other to see which one could

draw the biggest crowds. Today
they see who can stay off of alcohol
probation the longest or minimize
their sentences once infractions
are prosecuted (after they in
evitably occur).
During this "Golden Age," it
seemed that the University took
an active interest in furthering
the social atmosphere on cam
pus. The Alumni Association
sponsored Full Moon on the
Quad. Then there was the once
star-studded event, the annual
Ma usoleum Party on Hal
loween, which once featured the
infamous, booty-lovin' Sir Mix
a-Lot.
Before the words "Buddy
Teevens" entered our vocabu
lary, we had Tyrone. For those of
you who are not avid football fol
lowers, Coach Tyrone Willing
ham led us to seven (yes seven!)
straight Big Game wins and a
trip to the Rose Bowl. We cannot
guarantee causation, but there is
definitely a strong correlation

between the untimely depar
tures of the social scene and Ty
rone. Some say he's in a better
place now.
These changes are particularly
crippling to the Stanford bubble
because we live on a campus de
signed to be self-contained. Har
bored in a suburban oasis, our off
campus social options are scarce
and prohibitively expensive.
Those of us under the age of 21
face a particular dearth of social
options. On Saturday night, we
were so elated after we were noti
fied that we would be writing this
column, that we just had to go do
something at the "early" hour of 9
p.m. After driving around the
greater Palo Alto region for an
hour, we realized that if you are
not hungry, not 21 and not in the
mood to see "Kangaroo Jack," the
best place to go is Borders Book
store (yes, we are embarrassed to
admit this sad, sad fact).
Tragically, the most heavily im
pacted members of our student
body are the car-less freshmen.
What do they do? Go to the Stan
ford Bookstore? Oh wait, it's
closed already. Clearly this issue
has gained the attention of the
ASSU, who have done their best to
alleviate the situation, giving stu
dents the option of late night bus
ing to the city. But we all know this
solution is little more than a Band-
Aid on a broken leg.
So who's benefiting from these
dark times? It's not the police,
who have been deprived of their
traditional task: loitering in the
lower Row on patrol for underage
drinkers. Now, their occupational
duties have dwindled. They stop
bikers without lights.

Most people blame the University for
promoting these social changes to benefit
itself. We believe there is a far more insid
ious source for this void of social options:
Residential Education.

Residential Education lackeys, com
monly known as RAs, have been trying to
accrue decent turnouts at their dorm pro
gramming events since 1912 (or whenev
er they established the dorm system).
They realized the only way to force resi
dents to attend hug workshops and study
breaks on Thursday nights is to take away
every other possible social option. The
only choice students have, if they want to
escape their personal academic hell, is to

"Come on the down to the lounge for
some dorm lovin'!"
Their misplaced, albeit well-inten
tioned enthusiasm has gone too far.
So let's get back to the basics.
She's in favor of increased defense
spending, i.e. making police officers re
sponsible for keeping high school stu
dents out of frat parties. He would like
to see a more liberal social agenda on
campus, i.e. legalizing pot and alcohol

for everyone.
Basically, this dichotomy of opinion
translates into our fighting like cats and
dogs or techies and fuzzies, as the case
may be. There should be some entertain
ing mudslinging and hopefully you're
gonna get dirty too.

Listen here: We're the
new Monday crew that
will occupy this space,
and we're going to tell
you a little about ourselves.
She's a little bit country; he's a
little bit rock 'n' roll. That's us in a
nutshell. One is an opinionated
sorority girl. The other one is a
dweeby guy who can't dance to
save his life. Together, we form a
pair who could get drunk from a
total of four drinks.
She always votes Republican
and cannot stand people who
smoke. He is a Democrat who in
haled.
The one place on the campus
where we could have possibly
met?
A frat party, of course. Where
else can you have a conversation
without talking about grades and
classes? Where else can you remi
nisce about your freshman dorm
experience?
We decided that Stanford ain't
what it used to be. So ever since
that fateful moment, we've dis
cussed our "Golden Days" of col
lege. We have a similar back
ground in the sense that we are
both juniors and share a common
nostalgia for the past.
Back in the day, before "Invita
tion Only" parties were the norm,
one of us was running away from
sketchy graduate students, while
the other one was with his friends,
clinging to his foamy red cup at
one particular keg-soaked display
of youthful debauchery. Now
