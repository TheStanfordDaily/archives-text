Residential Education opens dialogue
concerning frosh-dorms
I was glad to see The Daily address
the issue of frosh housing in its recent
editorial entitled "Crunching frosh
dorms" (Feb. 4). I am in complete agree
ment with the editors that it will be criti
cal for all relevant parties — students,
Resident Fellows, faculty and staff alike
— to be engaged and consulted, as we
move from an initial conversation about
what the concerns are to the details of
possible solutions. That consultative
process began last week in discussions
with RFs and will continue by also in
volving students and others. In addi
tion, a survey of sophomores reflecting
on their freshman year was recently
completed and the results are being re
viewed. The data will provide valuable
insights into current student percep
tions of their residential experience.
There are a few things I would like to
clarify regarding the content of the ed
itorial. First, the idea of residence
based tutors originally arose from the

1997 Task Force on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for Un
dergraduates. The recommendations
from that Task Force report are worth
exploring, as are new ideas and con
cerns that have surfaced since the re
port was written.
Second, the notion that creating more
all-frosh housing would result in fewer
options for freshmen is a misconception.
The array of special programs and choic
es that currently exist would remain in
any future scenario that I can imagine.
Entering students would still be able to
voice their preference for Freshman /
Sophomore College, Structured Liberal
Education, ethnic theme houses, as well as
four-class houses.
The Residential Education program
at Stanford is considered among the best
in the country. We have no intention to
"fix what isn't broken." Periodic review,
such as the process we are engaged in, is
a vital activity in an organization's on
going efforts to maintain service and
programmatic excellence. Fundamen
tally, we've begun a dialogue about what
kind of housing options best support our
undergraduates. It is a critical conversa
tion, and we welcome the involvement of

all interested parties.

'Interested party 7 naturally supports space
travel
A member of Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, a contract
ing engineer who works at NASA's astro
biological branch, rejects my charge that
the manned space program is foolish.
Naturally, he would; he is an interested
party. More important, Paul Krugman,
the well-known economist, formerly at
Stanford, now at Princeton, in a New
York Times article 'A failed mission' (Feb.
4), called for the program to be shut
down, arguing that the program was a
misallocation of funds and a wrong bud
get priority.
His argument, too, was rebutted, with
the charge that he "insulted seven in
trepid explorers," which is an appeal to
the emotions. Naturally we deeply lament
the loss of the seven astronauts, for which
NASA, not its critics, is responsible. Krug
man has received the backing of thought
ful people looking beyond the tragedy.

Congress passed a long resolution ex
pressing the nation's grief regarding the
tragedy. After a list of "whereases" came an
eloquent but confused expression of deter
mination to continue manned exploration of
space even beyond the solar system. Such
dreaming makes things worse. It would not
surprise me if someone proposed landing a
man on the sun, with the scientific justifica
tion that the sun is the source of abundant,
non-polluting energy. There would be the
usual mantra about Christopher Columbus.
As a Hispanist, the dec line of Spain, once
the world's greatest power, is a matter of
scholarly interest to me. Spain expended its

resources on acquiring the empire and in
building the Grand Armada to crush Eng
land, which then became the greater power.
For Spain, the cosmos was the domain of
God. For the United States, space is its do
main and its astronauts' domain: more
pride, more hubris. Which is the equivalent
of the Grand Armada, the manned space
program or the armed forces arrayed
against Iraq? I do not know; the future is a
mystery. Whatever the United States decides
to do, it must act with due prudence.
