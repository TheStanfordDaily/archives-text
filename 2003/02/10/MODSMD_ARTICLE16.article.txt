# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Office of Public Affairs plays many influential roles on campus 
### 
Since arriving at Stanford six months
ago, one of the pleasures of my job
has been meeting students and
learning about the depth and diver
sity of student life. I have been especially
impressed with the intellectually dynamic
environment and the degree to which stu
dents are committed to improving the Uni
versity and the community at-large.
I also have discovered, however, that
many students and community members
don't have a clear idea of what the Office
of Public Affairs does and how the office is
involved in student life. In fact, for most
students, we probably blend into an
amorphous group known simply as the
"administration."
Yet I want to encourage students to get
to know those who work for the Universi
ty as people — not bureaucrats — and
become more familiar with the individu
als who serve in my office. Let me point
out several ways where we presently work
together, which can pave the way for new
collaborations.
One of our primary responsibilities of
our office is offering advice on communi
cations strategy and policy to the Office of
the President and Provost, as well as other
University officials. We also work with the
local and national media to disseminate
news about the accomplishments of Stan
ford's faculty and students and to pro
mote events in which they participate,

such as the recent conference on "Explor
ing Religious Boundaries."
Another example of how we have
worked with students in recent months
involved collaboration between our web
staff and ISIS, the student group that is
helping us pull together a public events
calendar. By combining resources and
technical expertise, we are building a
more dynamic and useful calendar for the
entire campus community.
In addition to holding on-campus
events, it is critical for Stanford to reach
beyond its borders. A substantial amount
of my time is spent in the community —
giving speeches, holding neighborhood
gatherings, meeting with local leaders
and residents to discuss issues of concern,
attending and hosting events and solving
problems with community members on a
range of "town and gown" issues.
This effort involves programs de
signed to bring Stanford and its neigh
bors closer together. Potential ideas for
this year include: a forum on town and
gown issues, an awards ceremony and ex
hibit celebrating outstanding Stanford
and community partnerships and pro
grams to more effectively communicate
about Stanford's many activities in the
local community.
Students can help in these efforts by of
fering suggestions. Are they good ideas?
Can they be improved? What student-initi

ated programs should we add to the mix?
One way such an exchange of ideas
might occur is to strengthen ties between
Public Affairs and "Bursting the Bubble,"
the student group that creates links be
tween Stanford students and important
issues that occur off campus. Its interests
coincide in many ways with the outreach
conducted by my staff, as well as other
Stanford organizations that have strong
connections to our community.
Other opportunities exist as well. For
example, I expect to hear fresh ideas
from students about community involve
ment when I attend "Shifting Our Think
ing: Beyond Service to Engaging Youth
and Communities," an event sponsored
this spring by the Haas Center for Public
Service and the John W. Gardner Center.
It will feature a panel of leaders from
local youth organizations and Stanford
student groups, who will explain their
role in civic engagement and building
community pride.
Stanford has created many innovative
programs that have strengthened ties to
the community. Stanford students are
currently playing a pivotal role in one of
them — Community Day — which takes
place on April 6. Some 60 student groups
applied for grants from the Office of the
President and Provost to provide demon
strations and entertainment as part of the
event, which was first launched a year

ago. Among groups receiving funding are
the Society of Women Engineers, the
Stanford Chemistry Club, the Stanford
Native American Craduate Students, the
Stanford Men's Ultimate Team and the
Taiwanese Cultural Society. Additionally,
the Haas Center, through its public ser
vice fellowship program, is sponsoring a
"Fun Run" during Community Day to
benefit the East Palo Alto YMCA.
These activities represent the tip of the
iceberg in terms of student involvement
with my office. Additional ideas from stu
dents to create and implement new com
munity programs are welcome.
The Office of Public Affairs is deeply
involved in shaping and communicating
policies initiated by the Office of the Pres
ident and Provost. In recent months we
have worked with the president and
provost to help articulate Stanford's sup
port for diversity and affirmative action
and to promote the University's desire to
encourage respectful campus discourse
on controversial political issues.
The proposed living-wage guidelines
represent another example of our in
volvement in policy issues. Last Novem
ber, I participated in a panel discussion
on the subject. After subsequent fine-tun
ing of the guidelines by President Hen
nessy and other University leaders, I am
now encouraging students who wish to
communicate about these proposals and

related issues to contact me directly. This
can be accomplished through e-mail,
phone conversations and one-on-one or
group meetings. The input will be valu
able as we move to finalize the proposals,
as well as develop a process for obtaining
student input in the future.
Presenting world-class artists, speak
ers, and special events on campus is cen
tral to our mission of engaging the cam
pus and our surrounding neighbors.
More than 50 performances of classical
and world music, dance and theater are
brought to Stanford annually through
Lively Arts, the university's presenting
program. Students are also a primary
focus of the University's most notable
public ceremonies such as Commence
ment, Baccalaureate, the University Pres
ident's Inauguration and New Student
Convocation, which all serve to build
stronger bridges between Stanford and
the community.
To succeed, the Office of Public Affairs
must communicate and exchange ideas
with a wide range of individuals. I en
courage students to engage in this dia
logue with us and, in the process, help de
velop innovative policies and programs
that are in best interests of the University
and the surrounding community.

This effort involves programs de
signed to bring Stanford and its neigh
bors closer together. Potential ideas for
this year include: a forum on town and
gown issues, an awards ceremony and ex
hibit celebrating outstanding Stanford
and community partnerships and pro
grams to more effectively communicate
about Stanford's many activities in the
local community.
Students can help in these efforts by of
fering suggestions. Are they good ideas?
Can they be improved? What student-initi

ated programs should we add to the mix?
One way such an exchange of ideas
might occur is to strengthen ties between
Public Affairs and "Bursting the Bubble,"
the student group that creates links be
tween Stanford students and important
issues that occur off campus. Its interests
coincide in many ways with the outreach
conducted by my staff, as well as other
Stanford organizations that have strong
connections to our community.
Other opportunities exist as well. For
example, I expect to hear fresh ideas
from students about community involve
ment when I attend "Shifting Our Think
ing: Beyond Service to Engaging Youth
and Communities," an event sponsored
this spring by the Haas Center for Public
Service and the John W. Gardner Center.
It will feature a panel of leaders from
local youth organizations and Stanford
student groups, who will explain their
role in civic engagement and building
community pride.
Stanford has created many innovative
programs that have strengthened ties to
the community. Stanford students are
currently playing a pivotal role in one of
them — Community Day — which takes
place on April 6. Some 60 student groups
applied for grants from the Office of the
President and Provost to provide demon
strations and entertainment as part of the
event, which was first launched a year

ago. Among groups receiving funding are
the Society of Women Engineers, the
Stanford Chemistry Club, the Stanford
Native American Craduate Students, the
Stanford Men's Ultimate Team and the
Taiwanese Cultural Society. Additionally,
the Haas Center, through its public ser
vice fellowship program, is sponsoring a
"Fun Run" during Community Day to
benefit the East Palo Alto YMCA.
These activities represent the tip of the
iceberg in terms of student involvement
with my office. Additional ideas from stu
dents to create and implement new com
munity programs are welcome.
The Office of Public Affairs is deeply
involved in shaping and communicating
policies initiated by the Office of the Pres
ident and Provost. In recent months we
have worked with the president and
provost to help articulate Stanford's sup
port for diversity and affirmative action
and to promote the University's desire to
encourage respectful campus discourse
on controversial political issues.
The proposed living-wage guidelines
represent another example of our in
volvement in policy issues. Last Novem
ber, I participated in a panel discussion
on the subject. After subsequent fine-tun
ing of the guidelines by President Hen
nessy and other University leaders, I am
now encouraging students who wish to
communicate about these proposals and

related issues to contact me directly. This
can be accomplished through e-mail,
phone conversations and one-on-one or
group meetings. The input will be valu
able as we move to finalize the proposals,
as well as develop a process for obtaining
student input in the future.
Presenting world-class artists, speak
ers, and special events on campus is cen
tral to our mission of engaging the cam
pus and our surrounding neighbors.
More than 50 performances of classical
and world music, dance and theater are
brought to Stanford annually through
Lively Arts, the university's presenting
program. Students are also a primary
focus of the University's most notable
public ceremonies such as Commence
ment, Baccalaureate, the University Pres
ident's Inauguration and New Student
Convocation, which all serve to build
stronger bridges between Stanford and
the community.
To succeed, the Office of Public Affairs
must communicate and exchange ideas
with a wide range of individuals. I en
courage students to engage in this dia
logue with us and, in the process, help de
velop innovative policies and programs
that are in best interests of the University
and the surrounding community.
GORDON EARLE
Vice Prestdenl for Public Affairs
Since arriving at Stanford six months
ago, one of the pleasures of my job
has been meeting students and
learning about the depth and diver
sity of student life. I have been especially
impressed with the intellectually dynamic
environment and the degree to which stu
dents are committed to improving the Uni
versity and the community at-large.
I also have discovered, however, that
many students and community members
don't have a clear idea of what the Office
of Public Affairs does and how the office is
involved in student life. In fact, for most
students, we probably blend into an
amorphous group known simply as the
"administration."
Yet I want to encourage students to get
to know those who work for the Universi
ty as people — not bureaucrats — and
become more familiar with the individu
als who serve in my office. Let me point
out several ways where we presently work
together, which can pave the way for new
collaborations.
One of our primary responsibilities of
our office is offering advice on communi
cations strategy and policy to the Office of
the President and Provost, as well as other
University officials. We also work with the
local and national media to disseminate
news about the accomplishments of Stan
ford's faculty and students and to pro
mote events in which they participate,

such as the recent conference on "Explor
ing Religious Boundaries."
Another example of how we have
worked with students in recent months
involved collaboration between our web
staff and ISIS, the student group that is
helping us pull together a public events
calendar. By combining resources and
technical expertise, we are building a
more dynamic and useful calendar for the
entire campus community.
In addition to holding on-campus
events, it is critical for Stanford to reach
beyond its borders. A substantial amount
of my time is spent in the community —
giving speeches, holding neighborhood
gatherings, meeting with local leaders
and residents to discuss issues of concern,
attending and hosting events and solving
problems with community members on a
range of "town and gown" issues.
This effort involves programs de
signed to bring Stanford and its neigh
bors closer together. Potential ideas for
this year include: a forum on town and
gown issues, an awards ceremony and ex
hibit celebrating outstanding Stanford
and community partnerships and pro
grams to more effectively communicate
about Stanford's many activities in the
local community.
