## Cardinal pounds Beavers 
### ARISHA HATCH STAFF WRITER 
CORVALLIS — The folks in Corvallis were full
of insults for the No. 25 Cardinal, and they
weren't keeping them a secret.

Men's Basketball

Sunday: No. 25 Stanford 84, Oregon St. 73
vs. Washington, Thursday, 7 p.m.

After dropping a game on Thursday night to
California, Oregon State senior point guard Jim
mie Haywood said in a televised postgame press
conference that he would rather play Stanford
than Cal.
Oops.
"Oh, OK," thought senior guard Julius
Barnes. "I didn't say anything to [Haywood] but I
kept that in the back of my head."
Oregon State's student section opened the
game with sporadic chants of, "Julie, Julie."
And the final straw, with 3:52 remaining in the
first half and Oregon State forward David Lucas
on the free-throw line waiting for his second shot,
one student yelled out: "Hey Julius, I don't like
you."
With a sly smile on his face, Barnes replied, "I
don't like you either," in what would be one of
many vocal encounters between Barnes and the
crowd on a career day for the 6-foot-1 guar d.
The Oregon State fan had plenty of reasons
not to like Barnes, though — 23 reasons in the
first hall alone — as Barnes opened the half with
that many points on 8-for-l 1 shooting from the
field (including five 3-pointers) and 71 percent
shooting from behind the arc. Each point came
with a swift glare to the crowd and a grin.
Today's lesson: Don't makejulius Barnes mad.
He scored a career-high 33 points to lead his

team to victory over the Beavers 84-73 on Sunday
afternoon in front of a near-capacity audience.
Bames also grabbed a team-high seven re
bounds.
"[Thecrowdl was funny," Barnes said. "I had a
good time with them."
In fact, the only thing that could stop Barnes
from scoring in the first half was Barnes himself.
The 6-foot-1 point guard, who accounted for 50
percent of his team's first-half scoring, was whis
tled for his third foul with 2:25 left on the clock.
"I'm not trying to take anything away from
him, but today, I don't think we did a good
enough job on Julius in transition," said Oregon
State head coach Jay John.
Sophomore Josh Childress added 11 first-half
points to aid Stanford to one of its best offensive
starts of the season and a 46-31 lead heading into
the locker room.
"Julius obviously had a career night," said Stan
ford head coach Mike Montgomery. "When we
shoot the ball [well], obviously everything looks a
lot different."
With Barnes on the bench to start the first half,
the Beavers went on an 8-1 run to open the half,
which ended when senior Brian Jackson picked
up his fourth foul and was forced to leave the
game.
Stanford answered the run, however. Barnes
returned after the Cardinal committed three
turnovers to open the half. After a Justin Davis
miss on the offensive end, Childress grabbed the
rebound and scored despite being fouled. He
made the free throw to complete the three-point
play, bringing the Cardinal's lead back to 12.
Childress finished with 16 points of 5-for-9
shooting from the field.
With nine minutes left to play, Oregon State
