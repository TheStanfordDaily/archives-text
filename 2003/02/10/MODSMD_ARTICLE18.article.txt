# Cal stuns No. 1 Stanford at National Team Indoors
## Tennis suffers rare loss 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Once is a fluke. But twice is the
beginning of a trend.
The National Team Indoors has
caused a rare blemish on the Stan
ford women's tennis team's record
for the second straight year. Last
year, the squad fell 4-3 to Georgia
before finishing the season with a
27-1 record and a national champi
onship. This year the Cardinal lost
to rival California 4-3 in Madison,
Wisconsin.
The loss was unsettling to Stan
ford fora variety of reasons. First,
the team may lose its No. 1
ranking — possibly to Florida, who
advanced to the finals of the tourna
ment before falling to Duke.
Second, the loss came at the
hands of No. 10 California which
makes it particularly stinging for
any Cardinal fan. Finally, this is a
program that had lost a total of one
match in two full seasons before Fri
day, so anything but victory is sur
prising.
The Cardinal (3-1) looked
strong in its opening-round
matchup against Wisconsin on
Thursday. I Tie team quickly took
the doubles point with wins from

sophomore Erin Burdette and ju
nior Lauren Barnikow at No. 1
doubles and freshmen Amber Liu
and Alice Barnes at No. 2.
From there, Stanford dominat
ed the six singles matches fora 7-0
victory. Sophomore Story Tweedie-
Yates picked up a quick 6-1,6-1 vic
tory at No. 6 singles, and Liu
claimed her first win of the year at
the No. 1 singles spot with a 6-1,6-3
victory over Shana McElroy of
Wisonsin.
The problems began early for
Stanford on Friday against Cal.
The team opened the match by
dropping the crucial doubles point,
as only Barnikow and Burdette —
who defeated the very strong Cal
team of Raquel Kops-Jones and
Christina Fusano, 8-5 — could earn
a doubles victory.
The Bears extended their lead to
2-0 with a victory at the top singles
spot. In a battle of heavyweights,
Kops-Jones, ranked No. 17 in the
nation, defeated No. 12 Liu in
straight sets, 6-3,6-2.
Burdette gained the first Cardi
nal victory of the day with a 5-7,6-
4, 6-3 win over Catherine Lynch,
but Cal secured the win with victo
