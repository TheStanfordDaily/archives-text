# Cal stuns No. 1 Stanford at National Team Indoors
## Tennis suffers rare loss 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Once is a fluke. But twice is the
beginning of a trend.
The National Team Indoors has
caused a rare blemish on the Stan
ford women's tennis team's record
for the second straight year. Last
year, the squad fell 4-3 to Georgia
before finishing the season with a
27-1 record and a national champi
onship. This year the Cardinal lost
to rival California 4-3 in Madison,
Wisconsin.
The loss was unsettling to Stan
ford fora variety of reasons. First,
the team may lose its No. 1
ranking — possibly to Florida, who
advanced to the finals of the tourna
ment before falling to Duke.
Second, the loss came at the
hands of No. 10 California which
makes it particularly stinging for
any Cardinal fan. Finally, this is a
program that had lost a total of one
match in two full seasons before Fri
day, so anything but victory is sur
prising.
The Cardinal (3-1) looked
strong in its opening-round
matchup against Wisconsin on
Thursday. I Tie team quickly took
the doubles point with wins from

sophomore Erin Burdette and ju
nior Lauren Barnikow at No. 1
doubles and freshmen Amber Liu
and Alice Barnes at No. 2.
From there, Stanford dominat
ed the six singles matches fora 7-0
victory. Sophomore Story Tweedie-
Yates picked up a quick 6-1,6-1 vic
tory at No. 6 singles, and Liu
claimed her first win of the year at
the No. 1 singles spot with a 6-1,6-3
victory over Shana McElroy of
Wisonsin.
The problems began early for
Stanford on Friday against Cal.
The team opened the match by
dropping the crucial doubles point,
as only Barnikow and Burdette —
who defeated the very strong Cal
team of Raquel Kops-Jones and
Christina Fusano, 8-5 — could earn
a doubles victory.
The Bears extended their lead to
2-0 with a victory at the top singles
spot. In a battle of heavyweights,
Kops-Jones, ranked No. 17 in the
nation, defeated No. 12 Liu in
straight sets, 6-3,6-2.
Burdette gained the first Cardi
nal victory of the day with a 5-7,6-
4, 6-3 win over Catherine Lynch,
but Cal secured the win with victo

ries at the No. 5 and No. 6 singles
spots, in which junior Emilia An
derson and Tweedie-Yates fell to
Jody Scheldt and Nicole Havlicek,
respectively.
Lauren Barnikow contributed a
solid 6-2, 6-2 win over a tough Fu
sano, while Barnes finished with a 6-
0.6-4 win over Jieun Jacobs.
The loss to Cal was not ruinous
to the Cardinal tournament, how
ever. The team seemed to com
pletely forget the Cal match in a 6-
1 dismantling of No. 5 North Car
olina in a quarterfinal play-off on
Saturday.
After Stanford again secured
the doubles point with victories
from Burdette / Barnikow at No.
1, Barnes /Liu at No. 2, and
Tweedie-Yates and Anderson at
No. 3, North Carolina quickly
evened the match with a victory at
No. 2 singles, in which Tar Heel
Kate Pinchbeck defeated
Barnikow, 6-1, 6-4.
The Cardinal would not permit a

repeat of Saturday, though, and
claimed the next five singles match
es for the win. Tweedie-Yates again
rolled to a straight-set victory, while
Liu claimed her second win at the
top singles spot with a 6-1,6-2 victo
ry over Marlene Mejia.
The rest of the singles matches
were closely decided three-set
battles. Burdette and Anderson
both blanked their opponents in
the first set before dropping the
second set. Anderson was able to
defeat Lee Bairos 6-2 in the final
set, while Burdette downed
Aniela Mojzis, 6-0, 5-7, 7-5 for the
win. Barnes pulled out a lengthy
victory over Kendall Cline, 6-3, 3-
6, 6-3, to complete the Cardinal
dominance.
The win against a top-five oppo
nent was important in helping the
Cardinal salvage confidence head
ing into a very difficult Pacific-10
Conference season. The loss to Cal
only highlighted the level of play
that the Cardinal will see in the com
ing weeks, including a rematch with
the Bears on Feb. 22.
The Cardinal's next five dual
matches will be played at home at
Taube Family Tennis Center.

The team opened the match by
dropping the crucial doubles point,
as only Barnikow and Burdette —
who defeated the very strong Cal
team of Raquel Kops-Jones and
Christina Fusano, 8-5 — could earn
a doubles victory.
The Bears extended their lead to
2-0 with a victory at the top singles
spot. In a battle of heavyweights,
Kops-Jones, ranked No. 17 in the
nation, defeated No. 12 Liu in
straight sets, 6-3,6-2.
Burdette gained the first Cardi

hands of No. 10 California.
ries at the No. 5 and No. 6 singles
spots, in which junior Emilia An
derson and Tweedie-Yates fell to
Jody Scheldt and Nicole Havlicek,
respectively.
Lauren Barnikow contributed a
solid 6-2, 6-2 win over a tough Fu
sano, while Barnes finished with a 6-
0.6-4 win over Jieun Jacobs.
The loss to Cal was not ruinous
to the Cardinal tournament, how
ever. The team seemed to com
pletely forget the Cal match in a 6-
1 dismantling of No. 5 North Car
olina in a quarterfinal play-off on
Saturday.
After Stanford again secured
the doubles point with victories
from Burdette / Barnikow at No.
1, Barnes /Liu at No. 2, and
Tweedie-Yates and Anderson at
No. 3, North Carolina quickly
evened the match with a victory at
No. 2 singles, in which Tar Heel
Kate Pinchbeck defeated
Barnikow, 6-1, 6-4.
The Cardinal would not permit a

repeat of Saturday, though, and
claimed the next five singles match
es for the win. Tweedie-Yates again
rolled to a straight-set victory, while
Liu claimed her second win at the
top singles spot with a 6-1,6-2 victo
ry over Marlene Mejia.
The rest of the singles matches
were closely decided three-set
battles. Burdette and Anderson
both blanked their opponents in
the first set before dropping the
second set. Anderson was able to
defeat Lee Bairos 6-2 in the final
set, while Burdette downed
Aniela Mojzis, 6-0, 5-7, 7-5 for the
win. Barnes pulled out a lengthy
victory over Kendall Cline, 6-3, 3-
6, 6-3, to complete the Cardinal
dominance.
The win against a top-five oppo
nent was important in helping the
Cardinal salvage confidence head
ing into a very difficult Pacific-10
Conference season. The loss to Cal
only highlighted the level of play
that the Cardinal will see in the com
ing weeks, including a rematch with
the Bears on Feb. 22.
The Cardinal's next five dual
matches will be played at home at
Taube Family Tennis Center.
