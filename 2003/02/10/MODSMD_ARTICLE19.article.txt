# Trojans break under pressure
## Strickland, Bocage step up as volleyball sweeps USC despite Toppelâ€™s absence 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After one of its toughest losses of the
season, the No. 6 Stanford men's volleyball
team (6-6, 4-4 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) rebounded strongly with a
sweep of Southern California (3-8, 1-6
MPSF).
The Cardinal looked good from the
start, playing consistently throughout the
first game to record a solid hitting per
centage of .407 for the game.
"After the loss to Pepperdine, this was
exactly the way I wanted the team to
play," coach Don Shaw said. "We didn't
make a lot of errors and our defense was
a lot better than it had been in our previ
ous matches."
Stanford finished with 11 blocks in com
parison to six from Southern California.
The Cardinal, playing for the second
straight match without senior first-team
All-American Curt Toppel, was looking
for another player to step up. It found
that player in senior outside hitter Billy
Strickland.

"Billy was just on fire throughout the
entire match," Shaw said. "He was hit
ting the ball hard and rarely made an
error. That's the kind of play we're
going to need from him if Toppel stays
out of the lineup."
Strickland led Stanford with 20 kills,
five digs and two service aces, giving him a
phenomenal .621 hitting percentage.
In addition to the outstanding play
from Strickland, Stanford relied on senior
middle blocker Paul Bocage to punish the
Trojan defense.
"Bocage did a lot of damage," Shaw
said. "Just like he did in our match against
Long Beach State, Paul made plays when
we really needed it."
Bocage added 12 kills to the Cardinal's
total of 52.
Despite a high level of play from the
Cardinal, it did not dominate throughout
the entire match.
The Trojans had chances to even the
match in the second game after they built a
28-22 lead.
"We got way behind in the second
game," Shaw said. "So we showed [the
Trojans] a different look, which worked
well for us."
The Cardinal subbed in
sophomore middle blocker
Craig Buell and redshirt sopho
more setter Pat Bomhack for se
nior middle blocker Kyle Stra
che and freshman outside hitter
Chris Ahlfeldt.
"Our defense got better with
this lineup," Shaw said. "It was a
really different look. Bomhack
and Buell provided a great
spark."
With the second lineup, Stan
ford reeled off six straight points
to tie up the game.
After the Cardinal streak, the
two teams traded points until
Stanford was able to close out the
game with a 36-34 win.
"After coming back from the
big deficit in game two, the mo
mentum really swung our way,"
Shaw said. "From that point on,
we felt like we had control of the
match."
Stanford finished off USC in
the third game by a score of 30-
25.
"Bocage and Strickland were
really the two main guys for us
tonight," Shaw said. "But we
couldn't have pulled out the
match in such a convincing way
without the great bench produc
tion."
