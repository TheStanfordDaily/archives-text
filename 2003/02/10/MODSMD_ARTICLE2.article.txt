The Greek Housing Review
Board completed its annual re
view of Stanford's housed frater
nities and sororities last Friday,
ending Kappa Sigma's housing
probation and extending Sigma
Alpha Epsilon's probation for
three months. In addition,
Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi
were placed on housing proba
tion effective this current winter
quarter through December
2003, and Delta Delta Delta re
ceived a letter of commendation
for its compliance with housing
requirements.
"We have a commitment to
make Greek housing as produc
tive and fulfilling as it can be,"
said Co-Chair of the Review
Board and Associate Director of
Residential Education John Ju
dicki. "We hope that Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Chi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon will take this op
portunity to reevaluate their
strengths and areas for needed
improvement in order to better
the chapter, the Greek commu
nity, and Stanford."
Housed Greek chapters are
reviewed on a number of criteria
such as membership and occu
pancy, financial status and con

duct. The review board's recom
mendations are reviewed and
approved by Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camaril
lo. Review after probation can
result in the probation being lift
ed or extended â€” or a chapter
can lose its housing.
"I am really encouraged by
the progress of Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon dur
ing their probations," said se
nior Jordan Connors, Interfra
ternity Council president.
"They have grown a lot as orga
nizations and are better for it."
The review board said that
Kappa Sig's demonstrated im
provement warranted lifting its
probation, which has been effec
tive since January 2002, accord
ing to a press release.
"Kappa Sig is on their way to
being one of strongest chapters
on campus if they continue the
way they have been going," said
review boards member Joey
Greenwell, assistant director of
student activities and fraternity
advisor.
The review board said that
SAE has made "limited im
provements" and "continues to
struggle." The board extended
housing probation, effective
since last January, for three

months, to be reviewed again in
May.
"SAE has made numerous
strides as a chapter this year,"
Greenwell said. "We want to make
sure there are mechanisms in place
for sustainability; we do not want
them to go off probation and then
go back on right after."
Because of their trends in not
meeting the University's Greek
housing criteria, the review
board placed KA and Sigma Chi
on housing probation through
next December, with a formal re
view of progress to occur fall
quarter.
Sigma Chi President Ben Dey, a
junior, said they were determined
to make this a positive experience.
He said the review board's con
cerns were problems with house
management and maintenance,

lack of Residential Education pro
gramming, and a few conduct is
sues.
"I think the probation process
will improve Sigma Chi," Dey said.
"I look at the improvements that
Kappa Sig and SAE have made
while on probation and think that
we can have similar success. The
downside is that people hear that
we are on probation and immedi
ately think our house is in bad
shape, which is just false."
KA President Nathaniel Fern
hoff, a senior, said that KA was
frustrated with the timing of the
review board's decision.
"We have known we weren't
performing up to par in the past
years, but this year we've made a
lot of changes, and we thought we
had done a lot of work and im
provement," he said. "The admin
istration's problems and concerns
are from KAs of years past."
The review board's concerns in
clude bad house stewardship and
the need for increased Residential

Education programming, commu
nity service and alumni events, ac
cording to Fernhoff. He said that
while the decision was discourag
ing, he thinks KA will continue to
improve as they have been recent
ly-
Housing probation is part ot a
new process that the University in
troduced last year to keep fraterni
ties and sororities better aware of
their housing status.
"It's really to give the chapters
a heads up that they are not
meeting criteria in the way they
should and that they can ulti
mately lose their house," Green
well said. "I think Kappa Sig and
even SAE are stronger chapters
for the process, so I think hous
ing probation is working in a pos
itive way to strengthen chapters
on campus."
Dey said, "The system is a new
one, and so I think that after the
Greek community gets through
these first couple of years and
learns what it has to do, compli

ance will be less difficult."
Connors said, "The rigorous
housing review process ensures
that no Stanford fraternities or
other organizations take their
housing privileges for granted and
that they constantly seek to pro
vide rich residential experiences."
Tri Delta received a letter of
commendation from the review
board for exceeding expectations
fora housed Greek chapter.
"It's really nice to know that the
University has noticed our efforts,"
said TriDelta President Veronica
Alaniz, a junior. "I'm excited for
TriDelta and proud of the pro
gramming we have offered to our
members and the Stanford com
munity."
Senior Naveen Kabir, Inter
sorority Council president,
agreed.
"The Intersorority council con
gratulates TriDelt on doing a great
job," she said. "We are delighted to
see TriDelt commended by the
University."
