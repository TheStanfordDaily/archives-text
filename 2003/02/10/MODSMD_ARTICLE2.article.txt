The Greek Housing Review
Board completed its annual re
view of Stanford's housed frater
nities and sororities last Friday,
ending Kappa Sigma's housing
probation and extending Sigma
Alpha Epsilon's probation for
three months. In addition,
Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi
were placed on housing proba
tion effective this current winter
quarter through December
2003, and Delta Delta Delta re
ceived a letter of commendation
for its compliance with housing
requirements.
"We have a commitment to
make Greek housing as produc
tive and fulfilling as it can be,"
said Co-Chair of the Review
Board and Associate Director of
Residential Education John Ju
dicki. "We hope that Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Chi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon will take this op
portunity to reevaluate their
strengths and areas for needed
improvement in order to better
the chapter, the Greek commu
nity, and Stanford."
Housed Greek chapters are
reviewed on a number of criteria
such as membership and occu
pancy, financial status and con

duct. The review board's recom
mendations are reviewed and
approved by Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camaril
lo. Review after probation can
result in the probation being lift
ed or extended â€” or a chapter
can lose its housing.
"I am really encouraged by
the progress of Kappa Sigma
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon dur
ing their probations," said se
nior Jordan Connors, Interfra
ternity Council president.
"They have grown a lot as orga
nizations and are better for it."
The review board said that
Kappa Sig's demonstrated im
provement warranted lifting its
probation, which has been effec
tive since January 2002, accord
ing to a press release.
"Kappa Sig is on their way to
being one of strongest chapters
on campus if they continue the
way they have been going," said
review boards member Joey
Greenwell, assistant director of
student activities and fraternity
advisor.
The review board said that
SAE has made "limited im
provements" and "continues to
struggle." The board extended
housing probation, effective
since last January, for three
