## Women trounce toothless Beavers 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the Stanford women's basketball team contin
ues to execute as well as it did against the Oregon
schools this weekend, the Cardinal will be in good
shape for upcoming road games at No. 25 Wash
ington and No. 24 Arizona.
Women's Basketball

Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 71, Oregon St. 46
at Washington, Thursday, 7 p.m.

On Saturday, Stanford added some momen
tum to its Thursday night thrashing of Oregon by
taking care of business against Oregon State. Stan
ford started the game with an 8-2 run en route to a
71-46 victory over a tall Beaver squad that coach
Tara VanDerveer thought might pose some prob
lems for her team inside.
Indeed the Beavers opened the game with two
blocked shots in the paint. But Stanford's newly
tuned, more structured offense wore down Ore
gon State's league-leading defense, and the Cardi
nal shot over 50 percent for the second time in as
many games.
Oregon State's aggressive defense never trans
lated into offensive cohesion. The Beavers commit
ted a season-high 30 turnovers, many unforced,
and went long stretches without even getting a shot
off, including a possession with two airballs. The
Beavers scored only six points over die last 10 min
utes of the first half.
Stanford built up its lead slowly but surely, never
scoring more dian eight unanswered points. Eight
points from Nicole Powell sparked a 15-6 Cardinal
run to end the first half, and Stanford extended a
13-point halftime lead to 28 points on a 3-pointer
by Kelley Suminski with 8:22 left in the game.
Powell and Suminski were Stanford's offensive
catalysts all day. Powell once again single-handedly
controlled the flow of the game, scoring 24 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds. Powell has always put
up big numbers, but has never been so involved in
every aspect of the game. It is this ability to domi
nate games that has prompted pundits to place
Powell among the nation's top three players, along
with Connecticut's Diana Taurasi and Duke's
Alana Beard.
"The best thing Nicole is doing is that she is so
aware of other players," VanDerveer said. "My de
finition of a great player is they make others
around them better. It is different watching her
play this year. She is a lot more in control of what is
happening on the court.
"What she is doing diis year as opposed to last
year is she is really talking a lot more and helping
the younger players get to the right spot. She is
showing more poise."
Suminski also reasserted herself this weekend
with back-to-back double-figure scoring games for
the first time in a month. After winning the Pac-10
Player of the Week award in December, Suminski
was mired in a minor scoring slump until this week
end. Her versatility and athleticism were on display
Saturday as she handled the ball, attacked the bas
ket and nailed outside shots.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu's production, though, is
perhaps most indicative of Stanford's offensive ex-
ecution. When other players are aggres
sive and the offense runs well, Kimya
cioglu gets open shots which invariably
translate into points. She scored 11 on Sat
urday.
The Cardinal's offensive execution this
weekend was particularly impressive con
sidering it played without point guard
Susan King, who sat out with a sore broken
toe. King had been playing on the broken
toe for over a month and is questionable
for this weekend's road trip to Washing
ton.
For the second game in a row, Tara
VanDerveer used all 11 healthy players.
In particular, Freshman Krista Rappa
hahn played meaningful minutes in place

of the injured King. Rappahahn seized the
opportunity, scoring 10 points against
Oregon and four against Oregon State.
More importantly, though, Rappahahn
has proved to be a reliable substitute for
the top three guards.
"Without Susan, a lot of people got
valuable experience," VanDerveer said.
"Krista [Rappahahn] in particular had a
really good weekend. This weekend was
important for us."
Victories have come easy in die familiar
com torts of Maples pavilion — the Cardi
nal has won 23 straight home games dat
ing back to Dec. 28,2001, a winning streak
second only to Connecticut.
However, this weekend's trip to Wash
ington will reveal whether Stanford can
continue such dominance on the road,
where the Cardinal has had more difficul
ty of late. Its only two losses of the sea
son — to Tennessee and USC — have

come away from home, and the Cardinal
has won its last three road games by a com
bined six points.
"The offense is a little more structured,
and it has gotten people really focused,"
VanDerveer said. "It will help us on the
road. The thing about playing on the road
is that other teams play more confidendy
at home. It's tough."
In the regular season home stretch,
Stanford will be working on small details
that will pay off come tournament time. In
particular: cutting down on unforced
turnovers, tweaking the offense and hit
ting the offensive glass more aggressively.
"We're getting to the end here when
you really look at it, so we just want to be
playing well," VanDerveer said. "The
thing that sustains you during the tourna
ment is people enjoy playing together so
much they don't want it to end. They're
not tired, they're excited."

valuable experience," VanDerveer said.
"Krista [Rappahahn] in particular had a
really good weekend. This weekend was
important for us."
Victories have come easy in die familiar
com torts of Maples pavilion — the Cardi
nal has won 23 straight home games dat
ing back to Dec. 28,2001, a winning streak
second only to Connecticut.
However, this weekend's trip to Wash
ington will reveal whether Stanford can
continue such dominance on the road,
where the Cardinal has had more difficul
ty of late. Its only two losses of the sea
son — to Tennessee and USC — have

come away from home, and the Cardinal
has won its last three road games by a com
bined six points.
"The offense is a little more structured,
and it has gotten people really focused,"
VanDerveer said. "It will help us on the
road. The thing about playing on the road
is that other teams play more confidendy
at home. It's tough."
In the regular season home stretch,
Stanford will be working on small details
that will pay off come tournament time. In
particular: cutting down on unforced
turnovers, tweaking the offense and hit
ting the offensive glass more aggressively.
"We're getting to the end here when
you really look at it, so we just want to be
playing well," VanDerveer said. "The
thing that sustains you during the tourna
ment is people enjoy playing together so
much they don't want it to end. They're
not tired, they're excited."
If the Stanford women's basketball team contin
ues to execute as well as it did against the Oregon
schools this weekend, the Cardinal will be in good
shape for upcoming road games at No. 25 Wash
ington and No. 24 Arizona.
Women's Basketball

Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 71, Oregon St. 46
at Washington, Thursday, 7 p.m.

On Saturday, Stanford added some momen
tum to its Thursday night thrashing of Oregon by
taking care of business against Oregon State. Stan
ford started the game with an 8-2 run en route to a
71-46 victory over a tall Beaver squad that coach
Tara VanDerveer thought might pose some prob
lems for her team inside.
Indeed the Beavers opened the game with two
blocked shots in the paint. But Stanford's newly
tuned, more structured offense wore down Ore
gon State's league-leading defense, and the Cardi
nal shot over 50 percent for the second time in as
many games.
Oregon State's aggressive defense never trans
lated into offensive cohesion. The Beavers commit
ted a season-high 30 turnovers, many unforced,
and went long stretches without even getting a shot
off, including a possession with two airballs. The
Beavers scored only six points over die last 10 min
utes of the first half.
Stanford built up its lead slowly but surely, never
scoring more dian eight unanswered points. Eight
points from Nicole Powell sparked a 15-6 Cardinal
run to end the first half, and Stanford extended a
13-point halftime lead to 28 points on a 3-pointer
by Kelley Suminski with 8:22 left in the game.
Powell and Suminski were Stanford's offensive
catalysts all day. Powell once again single-handedly
controlled the flow of the game, scoring 24 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds. Powell has always put
up big numbers, but has never been so involved in
every aspect of the game. It is this ability to domi
nate games that has prompted pundits to place
Powell among the nation's top three players, along
with Connecticut's Diana Taurasi and Duke's
Alana Beard.
"The best thing Nicole is doing is that she is so
aware of other players," VanDerveer said. "My de
finition of a great player is they make others
around them better. It is different watching her
play this year. She is a lot more in control of what is
happening on the court.
"What she is doing diis year as opposed to last
year is she is really talking a lot more and helping
the younger players get to the right spot. She is
showing more poise."
Suminski also reasserted herself this weekend
with back-to-back double-figure scoring games for
the first time in a month. After winning the Pac-10
Player of the Week award in December, Suminski
was mired in a minor scoring slump until this week
end. Her versatility and athleticism were on display
Saturday as she handled the ball, attacked the bas
ket and nailed outside shots.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu's production, though, is
perhaps most indicative of Stanford's offensive ex-
ecution. When other players are aggres
sive and the offense runs well, Kimya
cioglu gets open shots which invariably
translate into points. She scored 11 on Sat
urday.
The Cardinal's offensive execution this
weekend was particularly impressive con
sidering it played without point guard
Susan King, who sat out with a sore broken
toe. King had been playing on the broken
toe for over a month and is questionable
for this weekend's road trip to Washing
ton.
For the second game in a row, Tara
VanDerveer used all 11 healthy players.
In particular, Freshman Krista Rappa
hahn played meaningful minutes in place

of the injured King. Rappahahn seized the
opportunity, scoring 10 points against
Oregon and four against Oregon State.
More importantly, though, Rappahahn
has proved to be a reliable substitute for
the top three guards.
"Without Susan, a lot of people got
valuable experience," VanDerveer said.
"Krista [Rappahahn] in particular had a
really good weekend. This weekend was
important for us."
