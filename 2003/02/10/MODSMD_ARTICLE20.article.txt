Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 71, Oregon St. 46
at Washington, Thursday, 7 p.m.

On Saturday, Stanford added some momen
tum to its Thursday night thrashing of Oregon by
taking care of business against Oregon State. Stan
ford started the game with an 8-2 run en route to a
71-46 victory over a tall Beaver squad that coach
Tara VanDerveer thought might pose some prob
lems for her team inside.
Indeed the Beavers opened the game with two
blocked shots in the paint. But Stanford's newly
tuned, more structured offense wore down Ore
gon State's league-leading defense, and the Cardi
nal shot over 50 percent for the second time in as
many games.
Oregon State's aggressive defense never trans
lated into offensive cohesion. The Beavers commit
ted a season-high 30 turnovers, many unforced,
and went long stretches without even getting a shot
off, including a possession with two airballs. The
Beavers scored only six points over die last 10 min
utes of the first half.
Stanford built up its lead slowly but surely, never
scoring more dian eight unanswered points. Eight
points from Nicole Powell sparked a 15-6 Cardinal
run to end the first half, and Stanford extended a
13-point halftime lead to 28 points on a 3-pointer
by Kelley Suminski with 8:22 left in the game.
Powell and Suminski were Stanford's offensive
catalysts all day. Powell once again single-handedly
controlled the flow of the game, scoring 24 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds. Powell has always put
up big numbers, but has never been so involved in
every aspect of the game. It is this ability to domi
nate games that has prompted pundits to place
Powell among the nation's top three players, along
with Connecticut's Diana Taurasi and Duke's
Alana Beard.
"The best thing Nicole is doing is that she is so
aware of other players," VanDerveer said. "My de
finition of a great player is they make others
around them better. It is different watching her
play this year. She is a lot more in control of what is
happening on the court.
"What she is doing diis year as opposed to last
year is she is really talking a lot more and helping
the younger players get to the right spot. She is
showing more poise."
Suminski also reasserted herself this weekend
with back-to-back double-figure scoring games for
the first time in a month. After winning the Pac-10
Player of the Week award in December, Suminski
was mired in a minor scoring slump until this week
end. Her versatility and athleticism were on display
Saturday as she handled the ball, attacked the bas
ket and nailed outside shots.
Sebnem Kimyacioglu's production, though, is
perhaps most indicative of Stanford's offensive ex-
