# Baseball falls to Seminoles in extra innings
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Cardinal (3-5) base
ball team stood just one inning
away from a series win over No. 4
Florida State (4-1) and redemption
from last weekend's drubbing by
Cal State-Fullerton.

Friday: Stanford 2, Florida State 1
Saturday: Florida State 4, Stanford 3
Sunday: Florida State 10, Stanford 8

With a three-run lead heading
into the ninth inning, the Cardinal
had just three batters to put away to
close the book on the Seminoles.
But defensive miscues put the
tying run at the plate, and a home
run sent the game into extra in
nings and a 10-8 Stanford loss in
the twelfth.
Unfortunately, what happened
in the ninth seems to be typical of
the Cardinal's last two series —
small mistakes have led to big in
nings for opposing teams.
With two losses out of three
games that could have easily gone
either way, the Cardinal is left with
many "what ifs" from the weekend
series.
"A lot of little mistakes are

adding up and costing us," senior
catcher Ryan Garko said.
"We had a lot of chances to win
the game," added junior Brian
Hall. "But we're just going to have
to keep working at it."
The silver lining to the two losses

is that, despite the disappointing re
sults, the games were hard-fought
and very close. Both the Friday and
Sunday games ran twelve innings,
and the Cardinal's Saturday and
Sunday losses were by only one and
two runs, respectively — a vast im

provement over the Fullerton Se
ries.
Also encouraging for the Cardi
nal were the eight runs scored on
Sunday, the team's highest score so
far this season and a possible indica
tion that the Stanford bats are be
ginning to heat up.
"We swung the bats much better
than we have been," coach Mark
Marquess said. "We had a couple of
chances to win the game, but it just
didn't happen. That's unfortunate,
but that's baseball."
Junior John Hudgins, the Car
dinal's Friday starter, dealt nine
nearly flawless innings, giving up
just one run in the first before shut
ting down the Seminoles for eight
consecutive innings with 10 strike
outs and no walks.
The Florida State pitching staff,
however, also held the Cardinal to
just one run, and it wasn't until the
bottom of the twelfth that an RBI
single from senior Tobin Swope
gave the Cardinal the 2-1 win. The
Seminoles were held not only score
less, but also hitless in three sensa
tional innings from Stanford fresh
man Mark Romanczuk, who
picked up the win after relieving
Hudgins.

Hurler Matt Manship and the Cardinal gave up 10 runs in a disheartening
extra-inning loss to Florida State on Sunaay in the rubber match of the three
game series. Stanford blew a three-run ninth-inning lead in the defeat.
Florida State struck back on Sat
urday, beating Stanford 4-3 and
ending the Cardinal's 11-game
winning streak at Sunken Dia
mond.
Senior Tim Cunningham
picked up his second loss of the sea
son as he allowed four hits, three
walks and two earned runs over
three-and-two-thirds innings.
Sophomore Billy Paganetti
made his pitching debut in relief
of Cunningham and held the
Seminoles hitless for three-and
one-third innings, striking out
three but giving up a run on a
wild pitch.
The Cardinal rallied in the
eighth inning with two runs to pull
within one run of the Seminoles,
but a scoreless ninth ended in a
one-run Seminole victory.
Despite the team's 3-5 record, in
the long run the Cardinal will
probably be better off for having
faced difficult opponents before
Pacific-10 Conference play begins.
Having been tested by strong
teams like Fullerton and Florida
State, the Cardinal knows its weak
nesses and can work to improve
them.
Most importandy, the players
themselves, while disappointed,
are not discouraged by these early
season struggles. No one doubts
that this year's squad has the po
tential to contend with the best
teams in the nation.
"I think that the whole team is
just a little bit tight right now,"
Hudgins said. "It's the beginning
of the season, and there's a lot of
pressure on guys to earn a spot in
the lineup.
"Nobody's really worried,
though. We all know that it's a long
season, and that we have a lot of tal
ent. As soon as we setde down a lit
tle bit and begin to play like we're
able, we're going to be really good."

ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Hurler Matt Manship and the Cardinal gave up 10 runs in a disheartening
extra-inning loss to Florida State on Sunaay in the rubber match of the three
game series. Stanford blew a three-run ninth-inning lead in the defeat.
Florida State struck back on Sat
urday, beating Stanford 4-3 and
ending the Cardinal's 11-game
winning streak at Sunken Dia
mond.
Senior Tim Cunningham
picked up his second loss of the sea
son as he allowed four hits, three
walks and two earned runs over
three-and-two-thirds innings.
Sophomore Billy Paganetti
made his pitching debut in relief
of Cunningham and held the
Seminoles hitless for three-and
one-third innings, striking out
three but giving up a run on a
wild pitch.
The Cardinal rallied in the
eighth inning with two runs to pull
within one run of the Seminoles,
but a scoreless ninth ended in a
one-run Seminole victory.
Despite the team's 3-5 record, in
the long run the Cardinal will
probably be better off for having
faced difficult opponents before
Pacific-10 Conference play begins.
Having been tested by strong
teams like Fullerton and Florida
State, the Cardinal knows its weak
nesses and can work to improve
them.
Most importandy, the players
themselves, while disappointed,
are not discouraged by these early
season struggles. No one doubts
that this year's squad has the po
tential to contend with the best
teams in the nation.
"I think that the whole team is
just a little bit tight right now,"
Hudgins said. "It's the beginning
of the season, and there's a lot of
pressure on guys to earn a spot in
the lineup.
"Nobody's really worried,
though. We all know that it's a long
season, and that we have a lot of tal
ent. As soon as we setde down a lit
tle bit and begin to play like we're
able, we're going to be really good."
