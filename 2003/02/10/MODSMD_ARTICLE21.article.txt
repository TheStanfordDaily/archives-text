# Baseball falls to Seminoles in extra innings
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Cardinal (3-5) base
ball team stood just one inning
away from a series win over No. 4
Florida State (4-1) and redemption
from last weekend's drubbing by
Cal State-Fullerton.

Saturday: Florida State 4, Stanford 3
Sunday: Florida State 10, Stanford 8

With a three-run lead heading
into the ninth inning, the Cardinal
had just three batters to put away to
close the book on the Seminoles.
But defensive miscues put the
tying run at the plate, and a home
run sent the game into extra in
nings and a 10-8 Stanford loss in
the twelfth.
Unfortunately, what happened
in the ninth seems to be typical of
the Cardinal's last two series —
small mistakes have led to big in
nings for opposing teams.
With two losses out of three
games that could have easily gone
either way, the Cardinal is left with
many "what ifs" from the weekend
series.
"A lot of little mistakes are

adding up and costing us," senior
catcher Ryan Garko said.
"We had a lot of chances to win
the game," added junior Brian
Hall. "But we're just going to have
to keep working at it."
The silver lining to the two losses

is that, despite the disappointing re
sults, the games were hard-fought
and very close. Both the Friday and
Sunday games ran twelve innings,
and the Cardinal's Saturday and
Sunday losses were by only one and
two runs, respectively — a vast im

provement over the Fullerton Se
ries.
Also encouraging for the Cardi
nal were the eight runs scored on
Sunday, the team's highest score so
far this season and a possible indica
tion that the Stanford bats are be
ginning to heat up.
"We swung the bats much better
than we have been," coach Mark
Marquess said. "We had a couple of
chances to win the game, but it just
didn't happen. That's unfortunate,
but that's baseball."
Junior John Hudgins, the Car
dinal's Friday starter, dealt nine
nearly flawless innings, giving up
just one run in the first before shut
ting down the Seminoles for eight
consecutive innings with 10 strike
outs and no walks.
The Florida State pitching staff,
however, also held the Cardinal to
just one run, and it wasn't until the
bottom of the twelfth that an RBI
single from senior Tobin Swope
gave the Cardinal the 2-1 win. The
Seminoles were held not only score
less, but also hitless in three sensa
tional innings from Stanford fresh
man Mark Romanczuk, who
picked up the win after relieving
Hudgins.

extra-inning loss to Florida State on Sunaay in the rubber match of the three
game series. Stanford blew a three-run ninth-inning lead in the defeat.
