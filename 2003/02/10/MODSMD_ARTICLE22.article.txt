# Softball wins four of five

### LEE INSINGA 
The No. 14 softball team (5-2) put to
gether a strong showing at the ASU Fiesta
Bowl Tournament, earning a 4-1 record
against talented competition.
"It was a very good weekend for us,"
coach John Rittman said. "We started hit
ting the ball a bit."
The Cardinal notched wins against No.
25 UMass-Amherst (1 -3) and UNLV (2-6)
on the first day of competition in Phoenix.
Stanford's hot start came to a halt
against an old nemesis on Saturday, when
the Cardinal fell to the No. 10 Cal State-
Fullerton Titans (6-3), the same team that
eliminated it from the NCAA Tourna
ment last season. Stanford came back to
defeat Southwest Texas State (3-6) in Sat
urday's nightcap.
Yesterday's finale saw the Cardinal de
feat the Texas Tech Red Raiders (3-7).
The tournament began on a high note

for the Cardinal, who edged UMass 2-1.
The win avenged a 3-1 loss to the Minute
women in last year's N FGA Leadoff Clas
sic.
Senior pitcher Tori Nyberg picked up
the win against UMass, improving her
record to 2-0. Nyberg threw seven strong
innings, scattering live hits and allowing
just one run in the sixth.
Friday's second game saw more strong
pitching from the Cardinal.
Freshman Laura Severson tallied the
first win of her Stanford career in an 8-0
five-inning triumph over UNLV. Sever
son shut down the Rebels in the first three
innings, with senior Maureen Le Cocq
and redshirt junior Dana Sorensen each
pitching an inning to close out the game.
The 8-0 victory duplicated the score
from last year's meeting between the
Rebels and the Cardinal.

Maureen Le Cocq was solid in relief in an 8-0 win over UNLV on Friday but got little help in
a 6-0 loss to Cal State-Fullerton on Saturday. Stanford went 4-1 on the weekend.

Clare Bodensteiner directs traffic during Stanford's convincing victory over Oregon State on Saturday. The Beavers committed 30
turnovers in the 71 -46 blowout. No. 6 Stanford takes its show on the road next weekend against the Washington schools.
A bloop single by UNLV's Brid
get Byrne in the third inning was
the Rebels' first and only hit of the
game.
The Cardinal olfense started
strong with a six-run first inning,
highlighted by a bases-loaded dou
ble by senior left fielder Cassi
Brangham that drove in three
runs. A double by sophomore
Megan Sickler capped off the rally.
Those same bats fell silent in a
tough 6-0 loss to Cal State-Fuller
ton on Saturday.
The Cardinal owned the Titans
in the regular season of 2002. The
teams met three times in February,
with the Cardinal scoring 2-1,6-1
and 1-0 victories. In May the Ti
tans had their revenge, ending
Stanford's season with a 4-1 deci
sion at the NCAA Regional in Fres
no.
There is no shame in falling to
these Titans, however. Fullerton
will certainly be a top contender
for the College World Series in
May, having already defeated top
ranked UCLA 2-0 on Feb. 1.

"I think we learned a lot from
that game, and it'll help us down
the road," Rittman said.
The Cardinal offense suc
cumbed to Fullerton's talented
hurler Jodie Cox. Cox threw her
second complete game of the Fies
ta Bowl Classic in as many days,
striking out 10 Stanford batters.
Senior second baseman Kira
Ching tallied the Cardinal's only
hit, a single in the first inning. Le
Cocq absorbed the loss in her first
decision of the season.
The Cardinal attack came back
to life for Saturday's second game.
Ching and Brangham were the
offensive stars of an 11 -0 victory
over the Southwest Texas State
Bobcats. Ching went two-for-four
at the plate with two home runs
and three runs batted in. Brang
ham continued her hot hitting in
Phoenix with a two-for-three per
formance, highlighted by a grand
slam to open the scoring in the first
inning. Junior Jessica Allister also
homered for the Cardinal.
Nyberg picked up the win
against the Bobcats, and Sorensen
followed Nyberg's strong four in
nings of work by striking out the
side in the fifth to complete the
shutout.

Sorensen's success is a welcome
sight to Cardinal fans as she works
her way back from an ACL injury
that cut short her 2002 season.
Stanford will expect more work
from Sorensen in the future as she
strives to return to her All-Ameri
can form of 2000 and 2001.
"We'll see how her body feels in
practice this week," Rittman said.
"We're definitely looking to in
crease her innings this weekend."
Nyberg was once again the win
ning pitcher in Stanford's final
game of the tournament, improv
ing to 4-0 on the season. Nyberg
threw four shutout innings before
turning the ball over to Sorensen
and Severson, who combined to
finish out the shutout.
Nyberg continues to be a domi
nant force in the circle.
"Tori did a fabulous job for us
this weekend," Rittman said.
Severson also starred offensive
ly, going two-for-three at the plate.
Ching and Allister both added
home runs to lead the Cardinal.
A 4-1 performance against
skilled competition is good prepa
ration for next weekend, when
Stanford will host its first ever pre
season tournament at Smith Fami
ly Stadium.
