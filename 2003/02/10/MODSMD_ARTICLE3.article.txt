# Health costs burden students
## Despite subsidies, care costs rise for grad students 
### VINAY JAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.

If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per

centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23

and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person
pays out-of-pocket before the insur
ance takes over. But HMOs require
seeing a single doctor for all treat
ment and referrals. The more ex
pensive PPO plans, on the other

hand, allow a person to choose from
a network of doctors.
Enrolling in private health insur
ance can be a daunting proposition.
Securing coverage sometimes takes
months and coverage can be denied
on the basis of pre-existing condi
tions. And although prices vary with
benefits, a comprehensive PPO plan
can easily cost over $ 100 a month —
even for someone who is healthy.
To help students avoid the hassle
and expense of buying insurance
from an outside provider, as well as
the risk of being denied coverage,
Stanford offers Cardinal Care. The
program is run by Health Net, a
PPO affiliated with 46,000 doctors
and 400 hospitals in California —
including Stanford Hospital and
Clinics. Last year, 77 percent of
graduate students enrolled in Car
dinal Care. But Health Net sets the
cost of its plans, and — as some
graduate students learned in the
summer of2ool — that cost can in
crease drastically from year to year.
"We thought we were being cut off"
For Mark Smith, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, the
first sign of trouble came in the form
of a letter from Cowell Student
Health Services in early July of2ool.
The letter read, in part: "Recent
ly, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
decided to exit the managed care
business effective January 1, 2002.
With over half of our dependent
health insurance members using
Stanford as their provider, we can
not continue to offer our current
HMO plans."
The letter went on to say that the
University was looking at an alterna
tive plan which would likely cost 50
to 60 percent more.
Smith's plan covered both his
wife and 3-year-old son as depen
dents. They liked being able to get
treatment at Stanford Hospital,
which offered both quality and con
venience. But the Health Net HMO
that ran Smith's plan paid Stanford
Hospital in flat monthly fees, re
gardless of the treatment it provid
ed. Because, on balance, the treat
ment cost more than the fees, the
hospital decided it couldn't afford to
keep working with the HMO.
Smith was alarmed. It seemed his
options were either to drop Cardi
nal Care and risk losing coverage at
the hospital or to pay much more for
a new PPO version of the plan —
which really wasn't an option at all

on a graduate student's stipend.
"We thought we were being cut
off," he said.
Smidi joined an effort already
being spearheaded by Wong and
two other graduate students — Ray
Rivera, a doctoral student in educa
tion, and Grace Chang, a medical
student and president of the Gradu
ate Student Council — to express
student dissatisfaction with the new
plan. The four formed the Gradu
ate Health Care Task Force, which
worked with the GSC to notify the
administration that revamping Car
dinal Care could leave many stu
dents and their families in the lurch.
The task force's work — alerting
graduate students and gathering tes
timonials from those most affected —
helped prompt the University to
offer a dependent subsidy for the
2001-2002 academic year. The sub
sidy allowed Smith to keep liis child
on Cardinal Care for another year
before switching to Healthy Families,
an insurance program sponsored by
the California government for low
and middle-income households.
The University intended the sub
sidy to be a stopgap measure. At the
time, Dr. Ira Friedman, director of
Cowell Student Health Service, said,
"We will have to develop a radically
different approach for next
year... because it will be impossible
for the University to avoid passing
on the high cost of this type of plan
for even one more year."
But the new approach proved to
be similar to the old one. The Uni
versity institutionalized the subsidy
program in September 2002 and
extended the benefits to single stu
dents. A graduate student who
earns at least $2,000 per quarter in
stipends or teaching assistantships
now receives a 50 percent subsidy; a
student earning between $1,000
and $1,999 receives a 25 percent
subsidy. A single student earning
less than that gets only an $8 sub
sidy. For students with spouses and
children, the subsidies range from
23 percent to 56 percent, depend
ing on income and the number of
dependents.
The subsidies, funded partly by
surcharges on the government
grants that fund stipends and assist
antships, cost between about $3 mil
lion to $3.5 million a year.
A national problem
"As long as you're able to get the
subsidy, this is an affordable plan,"
said Brett Rogers, a doctoral student
in classics, who qualifies fora 50 per
cent subsidy as a single student. He
pays $180 per term for his plan —
substantially less than the unsubsi

clized rate of $243 that he was pay
ing this time last year.
But within the next few years,
students like Rogers will find their
post-subsidy cost increasing, accord
ing to Wong. She said the task
force's research indicates that insur
ance rates will continue to rise be
tween 30 and 35 percent per year
into the foreseeable future.
According to Friedman, many
factors are driving up health-care
costs, and they extend far beyond
the Farm.
"The two biggest [factors] are
probably the increasing use of new
technologies and expensive new
drugs, including those marketed di
recdy to consumers," he said.
Friedman added, "Although it is
true that Cardinal Care enrollees
are relatively healthy, they do need
to use a considerable amount of ser
vices, and the biggest cost drivers
apply to them as well."
The national trend means the
University's options for reducing
costs are limited.
"This really isn't the [University]
administration's fault," said
Kendall Bronk, a doctoral student
in education.
In feet, the University itself was
taken off guard by the magnitude of
the hikes. Announcing the institu
tionalization of subsidies last April,
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, said, "We are entirely at
the mercy of the health-care indus
try. We have no control over the
dramatic rise in health-care costs
that has occurred over the past few
years, yet we must still offer health
insurance to students who can't find
coveiage elsewhere."
Friedman said that Stanford has
negotiated with Health Net for the
best rates and has also looked into

changing providers. But the steep
cost of health care in the Bay Area
has meant that, even with this year's
high fees, Health Net is still the best
value for Stanford in terms of "cost,
quality and service," he said.
Stanford's push to provide rea
sonably priced health insurance is
driven in part by a need to remain
competitive with peer institutions.
Some universities, including Caltech
and Brown, fully subsidize graduate
health insurance. I nan effort to keep
up, Stanford is looking to add dental
and vision coverage to its plan, which
some universities already offer.
To help the University deter
mine whether graduate students
want such services — and how
much they'd be willing to pay for
them — the task force conducted an
online survey last week. The survey
asked about hypothetical plans that
included dental and vision cover
age. It also gave students a chance to
make general comments about Car
dinal Care. Rivera said 1,167 of the
University's approximately 7,500
graduate students responded. He
expects to present the findings to
the Vaden Health Center this week.
According to Wong, the key in
centive for students to continue
using Cardinal Care might not be
added services, but more
subsidies — an unlikely proposition
in the immediate future, given the
red ink facing Stanford. Ironically,
Wong added, the University may
eventually be forced to increase sub
sidies to keep down its own costs.
"If subsidies don't keep pace
[with rising health insurance premi
ums], insurance will be so expensive
that students who are well will seek
out cheaper private care, leaving
only unwell students on the Univer
sity' s plan."

up, Stanford is looking to add dental
and vision coverage to its plan, which
some universities already offer.
To help the University deter
mine whether graduate students
want such services — and how
much they'd be willing to pay for
them — the task force conducted an
online survey last week. The survey
asked about hypothetical plans that
included dental and vision cover
age. It also gave students a chance to
make general comments about Car
dinal Care. Rivera said 1,167 of the
University's approximately 7,500
graduate students responded. He
expects to present the findings to
the Vaden Health Center this week.
According to Wong, the key in
centive for students to continue
using Cardinal Care might not be
added services, but more
subsidies — an unlikely proposition
in the immediate future, given the
red ink facing Stanford. Ironically,
Wong added, the University may
eventually be forced to increase sub
sidies to keep down its own costs.
"If subsidies don't keep pace
[with rising health insurance premi
ums], insurance will be so expensive
that students who are well will seek
out cheaper private care, leaving
only unwell students on the Univer
sity' s plan."

Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.

If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per

centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23

and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person
pays out-of-pocket before the insur
ance takes over. But HMOs require
seeing a single doctor for all treat
ment and referrals. The more ex
pensive PPO plans, on the other

hand, allow a person to choose from
a network of doctors.
Enrolling in private health insur
ance can be a daunting proposition.
Securing coverage sometimes takes
months and coverage can be denied
on the basis of pre-existing condi
tions. And although prices vary with
benefits, a comprehensive PPO plan
can easily cost over $ 100 a month —
even for someone who is healthy.
To help students avoid the hassle
and expense of buying insurance
from an outside provider, as well as
the risk of being denied coverage,
Stanford offers Cardinal Care. The
program is run by Health Net, a
PPO affiliated with 46,000 doctors
and 400 hospitals in California —
including Stanford Hospital and
Clinics. Last year, 77 percent of
graduate students enrolled in Car
dinal Care. But Health Net sets the
cost of its plans, and — as some
graduate students learned in the
summer of2ool — that cost can in
crease drastically from year to year.
"We thought we were being cut off"
For Mark Smith, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, the
first sign of trouble came in the form
of a letter from Cowell Student
Health Services in early July of2ool.
The letter read, in part: "Recent
ly, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
decided to exit the managed care
business effective January 1, 2002.
With over half of our dependent
health insurance members using
Stanford as their provider, we can
not continue to offer our current
HMO plans."
The letter went on to say that the
University was looking at an alterna
tive plan which would likely cost 50
to 60 percent more.
Smith's plan covered both his
wife and 3-year-old son as depen
dents. They liked being able to get
treatment at Stanford Hospital,
which offered both quality and con
venience. But the Health Net HMO
that ran Smith's plan paid Stanford
Hospital in flat monthly fees, re
gardless of the treatment it provid
ed. Because, on balance, the treat
ment cost more than the fees, the
hospital decided it couldn't afford to
keep working with the HMO.
Smith was alarmed. It seemed his
options were either to drop Cardi
nal Care and risk losing coverage at
the hospital or to pay much more for
a new PPO version of the plan —
which really wasn't an option at all

on a graduate student's stipend.
"We thought we were being cut
off," he said.
Smidi joined an effort already
being spearheaded by Wong and
two other graduate students — Ray
Rivera, a doctoral student in educa
tion, and Grace Chang, a medical
student and president of the Gradu
ate Student Council — to express
student dissatisfaction with the new
plan. The four formed the Gradu
ate Health Care Task Force, which
worked with the GSC to notify the
administration that revamping Car
dinal Care could leave many stu
dents and their families in the lurch.
The task force's work — alerting
graduate students and gathering tes
timonials from those most affected —
helped prompt the University to
offer a dependent subsidy for the
2001-2002 academic year. The sub
sidy allowed Smith to keep liis child
on Cardinal Care for another year
before switching to Healthy Families,
an insurance program sponsored by
the California government for low
and middle-income households.
The University intended the sub
sidy to be a stopgap measure. At the
time, Dr. Ira Friedman, director of
Cowell Student Health Service, said,
"We will have to develop a radically
different approach for next
year... because it will be impossible
for the University to avoid passing
on the high cost of this type of plan
for even one more year."
But the new approach proved to
be similar to the old one. The Uni
versity institutionalized the subsidy
program in September 2002 and
extended the benefits to single stu
dents. A graduate student who
earns at least $2,000 per quarter in
stipends or teaching assistantships
now receives a 50 percent subsidy; a
student earning between $1,000
and $1,999 receives a 25 percent
subsidy. A single student earning
less than that gets only an $8 sub
sidy. For students with spouses and
children, the subsidies range from
23 percent to 56 percent, depend
ing on income and the number of
dependents.
The subsidies, funded partly by
surcharges on the government
grants that fund stipends and assist
antships, cost between about $3 mil
lion to $3.5 million a year.
A national problem
"As long as you're able to get the
subsidy, this is an affordable plan,"
said Brett Rogers, a doctoral student
in classics, who qualifies fora 50 per
cent subsidy as a single student. He
pays $180 per term for his plan —
substantially less than the unsubsi

clized rate of $243 that he was pay
ing this time last year.
But within the next few years,
students like Rogers will find their
post-subsidy cost increasing, accord
ing to Wong. She said the task
force's research indicates that insur
ance rates will continue to rise be
tween 30 and 35 percent per year
into the foreseeable future.
According to Friedman, many
factors are driving up health-care
costs, and they extend far beyond
the Farm.
"The two biggest [factors] are
probably the increasing use of new
technologies and expensive new
drugs, including those marketed di
recdy to consumers," he said.
Friedman added, "Although it is
true that Cardinal Care enrollees
are relatively healthy, they do need
to use a considerable amount of ser
vices, and the biggest cost drivers
apply to them as well."
The national trend means the
University's options for reducing
costs are limited.
"This really isn't the [University]
administration's fault," said
Kendall Bronk, a doctoral student
in education.
In feet, the University itself was
taken off guard by the magnitude of
the hikes. Announcing the institu
tionalization of subsidies last April,
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, said, "We are entirely at
the mercy of the health-care indus
try. We have no control over the
dramatic rise in health-care costs
that has occurred over the past few
years, yet we must still offer health
insurance to students who can't find
coveiage elsewhere."
Friedman said that Stanford has
negotiated with Health Net for the
best rates and has also looked into

changing providers. But the steep
cost of health care in the Bay Area
has meant that, even with this year's
high fees, Health Net is still the best
value for Stanford in terms of "cost,
quality and service," he said.
Stanford's push to provide rea
sonably priced health insurance is
driven in part by a need to remain
competitive with peer institutions.
Some universities, including Caltech
and Brown, fully subsidize graduate
health insurance. I nan effort to keep
up, Stanford is looking to add dental
and vision coverage to its plan, which
some universities already offer.

"This really isn't the [University]
administration's fault," said
Kendall Bronk, a doctoral student
in education.
In feet, the University itself was
taken off guard by the magnitude of
the hikes. Announcing the institu
tionalization of subsidies last April,
Gene Awakuni, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, said, "We are entirely at
the mercy of the health-care indus
try. We have no control over the
dramatic rise in health-care costs
that has occurred over the past few
years, yet we must still offer health
insurance to students who can't find
coveiage elsewhere."
Friedman said that Stanford has
negotiated with Health Net for the
best rates and has also looked into

changing providers. But the steep
cost of health care in the Bay Area
has meant that, even with this year's
high fees, Health Net is still the best
value for Stanford in terms of "cost,
quality and service," he said.
Stanford's push to provide rea
sonably priced health insurance is
driven in part by a need to remain
competitive with peer institutions.
Some universities, including Caltech
and Brown, fully subsidize graduate
health insurance. I nan effort to keep
up, Stanford is looking to add dental
and vision coverage to its plan, which
some universities already offer.
To help the University deter
mine whether graduate students
want such services — and how
much they'd be willing to pay for
them — the task force conducted an
online survey last week. The survey
asked about hypothetical plans that
included dental and vision cover
age. It also gave students a chance to
make general comments about Car
dinal Care. Rivera said 1,167 of the
University's approximately 7,500
graduate students responded. He
expects to present the findings to
the Vaden Health Center this week.
According to Wong, the key in
centive for students to continue
using Cardinal Care might not be
added services, but more
subsidies — an unlikely proposition
in the immediate future, given the
red ink facing Stanford. Ironically,
Wong added, the University may
eventually be forced to increase sub
sidies to keep down its own costs.
"If subsidies don't keep pace
[with rising health insurance premi
ums], insurance will be so expensive
that students who are well will seek
out cheaper private care, leaving
only unwell students on the Univer
sity' s plan."

Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.

If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per

centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23

and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person
pays out-of-pocket before the insur
ance takes over. But HMOs require
seeing a single doctor for all treat
ment and referrals. The more ex
pensive PPO plans, on the other

hand, allow a person to choose from
a network of doctors.
Enrolling in private health insur
ance can be a daunting proposition.
Securing coverage sometimes takes
months and coverage can be denied
on the basis of pre-existing condi
tions. And although prices vary with
benefits, a comprehensive PPO plan
can easily cost over $ 100 a month —
even for someone who is healthy.
To help students avoid the hassle
and expense of buying insurance
from an outside provider, as well as
the risk of being denied coverage,
Stanford offers Cardinal Care. The
program is run by Health Net, a
PPO affiliated with 46,000 doctors
and 400 hospitals in California —
including Stanford Hospital and
Clinics. Last year, 77 percent of
graduate students enrolled in Car
dinal Care. But Health Net sets the
cost of its plans, and — as some
graduate students learned in the
summer of2ool — that cost can in
crease drastically from year to year.
"We thought we were being cut off"
For Mark Smith, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering, the
first sign of trouble came in the form
of a letter from Cowell Student
Health Services in early July of2ool.
The letter read, in part: "Recent
ly, Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
decided to exit the managed care
business effective January 1, 2002.
With over half of our dependent
health insurance members using
Stanford as their provider, we can
not continue to offer our current
HMO plans."
The letter went on to say that the
University was looking at an alterna
tive plan which would likely cost 50
to 60 percent more.
Smith's plan covered both his
wife and 3-year-old son as depen
dents. They liked being able to get
treatment at Stanford Hospital,
which offered both quality and con
venience. But the Health Net HMO
that ran Smith's plan paid Stanford
Hospital in flat monthly fees, re
gardless of the treatment it provid
ed. Because, on balance, the treat
ment cost more than the fees, the
hospital decided it couldn't afford to
keep working with the HMO.
Smith was alarmed. It seemed his
options were either to drop Cardi
nal Care and risk losing coverage at
the hospital or to pay much more for
a new PPO version of the plan —
which really wasn't an option at all

on a graduate student's stipend.
"We thought we were being cut
off," he said.
Smidi joined an effort already
being spearheaded by Wong and
two other graduate students — Ray
Rivera, a doctoral student in educa
tion, and Grace Chang, a medical
student and president of the Gradu
ate Student Council — to express
student dissatisfaction with the new
plan. The four formed the Gradu
ate Health Care Task Force, which
worked with the GSC to notify the
administration that revamping Car
dinal Care could leave many stu
dents and their families in the lurch.
The task force's work — alerting
graduate students and gathering tes
timonials from those most affected —
helped prompt the University to
offer a dependent subsidy for the
2001-2002 academic year. The sub
sidy allowed Smith to keep liis child
on Cardinal Care for another year
before switching to Healthy Families,
an insurance program sponsored by
the California government for low
and middle-income households.
The University intended the sub
sidy to be a stopgap measure. At the
time, Dr. Ira Friedman, director of
Cowell Student Health Service, said,
"We will have to develop a radically
different approach for next
year... because it will be impossible
for the University to avoid passing
on the high cost of this type of plan
for even one more year."
But the new approach proved to
be similar to the old one. The Uni
versity institutionalized the subsidy
program in September 2002 and
extended the benefits to single stu
dents. A graduate student who
earns at least $2,000 per quarter in
stipends or teaching assistantships
now receives a 50 percent subsidy; a
student earning between $1,000
and $1,999 receives a 25 percent
subsidy. A single student earning
less than that gets only an $8 sub
sidy. For students with spouses and
children, the subsidies range from
23 percent to 56 percent, depend
ing on income and the number of
dependents.
The subsidies, funded partly by
surcharges on the government
grants that fund stipends and assist
antships, cost between about $3 mil
lion to $3.5 million a year.
A national problem
"As long as you're able to get the
subsidy, this is an affordable plan,"
said Brett Rogers, a doctoral student
in classics, who qualifies fora 50 per
cent subsidy as a single student. He
pays $180 per term for his plan —
substantially less than the unsubsi

clized rate of $243 that he was pay
ing this time last year.
But within the next few years,
students like Rogers will find their
post-subsidy cost increasing, accord
ing to Wong. She said the task
force's research indicates that insur
ance rates will continue to rise be
tween 30 and 35 percent per year
into the foreseeable future.
According to Friedman, many
factors are driving up health-care
costs, and they extend far beyond
the Farm.
"The two biggest [factors] are
probably the increasing use of new
technologies and expensive new
drugs, including those marketed di
recdy to consumers," he said.
Friedman added, "Although it is
true that Cardinal Care enrollees
are relatively healthy, they do need
to use a considerable amount of ser
vices, and the biggest cost drivers
apply to them as well."
The national trend means the
University's options for reducing
costs are limited.
"This really isn't the [University]
administration's fault," said
Kendall Bronk, a doctoral student
in education.
In feet, the University itself was
taken off guard by the magnitude of

tionalization of subsidies last April,
