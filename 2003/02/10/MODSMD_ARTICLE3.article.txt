# Health costs burden students
## Despite subsidies, care costs rise for grad students

Health insurance is something
the young and healthy often take for
granted — unless they're in danger
oflosingit. But the skyrocketing cost
of health insurance has some Stan
ford graduate students worried
about just that possibility.
"I'm going to be at Stanford an
other four years, and I'm deeply
concerned that by the end of that
time I'm not going to be able to af
ford the University's [health] insur
ance," said Lisa Wong, a doctoral
student in biophysics.

If recent history is any indication,
Wong's concerns are well founded.
The past two years have been a time
of upheaval for Cardinal Care, Stan
ford's student health insurance
plan. I n June of 2001, Cowell Stu
dent Health Services (now Vaden
Health Center) announced that, be
ginning die following year, students
would have to pay 50 to 60 percent
more to insure their spouses and
children. After a student outcry, the
University agreed to offer a subsidy
that would reduce the increase to an
average of just over 20 percent —
still a weighty burden on a typical
graduate student's budget.
One year later, the University
again increased the cost of Cardinal
Care, this time for single students.
For 2002-2003, the cost of single
student coverage went up from
$243 to $368 per quarter, a 66 per

centjump. At the same time, the cost
of insuring dependents again rose
by about 50 to 60 percent.
There was good news, too. The
University agreed to subsidize up to
half of the incr eased cost for gradu
ate students with research or teach
ing assistant positions.
However, the subsidy doesn't
apply to students in the University's
professional schools or to master's
students without paid teaching or
research responsibilities. That fact,
along with the fear that rates will
continue to rise, is prompting some
graduate students to take action.
A scarcity of choices
Stanford requires health insurance
for all its students, graduate and un
dergraduate. Most students are
kicked off their parents' insurance
somewhere between the age of 23

and 25, so graduate students typical
ly have to enroll in their own plan.
There are two main types of
health insurance providers: health
maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and preferred provider or
ganizations (PPOs). Of the two,
HMOs typically offer cheaper fixed
rates or premiums, as well as lower
deductibles — the amount a person
pays out-of-pocket before the insur
ance takes over. But HMOs require
seeing a single doctor for all treat
ment and referrals. The more ex
pensive PPO plans, on the other
