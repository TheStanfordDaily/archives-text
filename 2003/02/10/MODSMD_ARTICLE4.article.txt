# Ballet to perform Balanchine
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After becoming one of the only groups
from a major university ever to obtain the
rights to perform the"The Four Tempera
ments," Stanford's Cardinal Ballet is
preparing to put on world-famous choreo
grapher George Balanchine's neo-classical
ballet on April 5 and 6. Balanchine's work
was showcased in the popular movie, "Cen
ter Stage," released in 2000.
Last December, the student-run ballet
group acquired the rights to present the
renowned piece to the Stanford community
and the general public. Colleen Neary, a
former dancer with the New York City Bal

let who has previously worked with Balan
chine himself, is training the group.
"This is an enormous opportunity," said
Cardinal Ballet faculty advisor Kristine El
liott. "We are being exposed to world-class
ballet and working with one of its finest per
formers."
Balanchine is considered to be one of the
greatest 20th-century choreographers and
is credited with making the transition from
classical to modern ballet.
'"The Four Temperaments' is so differ
ent from what most people think of as bal
let," said former Cardinal Ballet President
Diana Movius, a junior. "It is the opposite of

classical music and puffy tutus.
There is modern movement, loud
music and minimal costume."
Cardinal Ballet underwent a
very selective application process
to obtain the rights to the ballet.
Assisted by connections between
Elliot, Neary and the Balanchine
Trust, which presents the rights,
the Stanford group was allowed to
bypass the traditional step in the
process of performing in front of
representatives from the Trust.
The Trust also waived a royalty fee
for Cardinal Ballet to perform the

piece.
Movius attributed Stanford's
good fortune to the large size of
the group, its ability to pay Neary
$2,500 for teaching, and the Stan
ford name.
"The Trust wants to expose the
Balanchine name to the future
leaders of America," she said.
Stanford's opportunity to per
form such a large piece of the
work is rare among liberal arts
colleges. A Harvard student
group recently obtained the
rights to perform only five min
utes of the piece while Cardinal
Ballet has acquired the rights to
perform 25 minutes of the 30-
minute segment.
"We are so thrilled to be able

to perform Balanchine's work,"
said Sharon Weiner, a junior.
"The rights are hard to get.
We're very lucky â€” being able to
work with Colleen Neary is
amazing."
Neary, who is used to training
professionals, also expressed en
thusiasm about working with Car
dinal Ballet.
"Working at such a high caliber
university is proving to be a very
enlightening experience," she
said. "These are very intelligent
students, and they are picking up
the steps quickly. It's very enjoy
able for me."
The Cardinal Ballet will spend
20 hours in the dance studio each
weekend for the next two months

preparing for the show.
While tickets fora piece of this
caliber would normally cost .$3O to
$70 at a major ballet company, stu
dents will be able to view "The
Four Temperaments," along with
other compositions, for only $6.
General admission tickets will cost
$14. The Stanford Orchestra will
provide the music for the perfor
mance.
"The magnitude of this project
is unbelievable," Elliott said. "It is a
true collaboration between dance
and music, and the dancers have
shown so much growth and inter
est. They are still passionate about
ballet even with so many other
things going on in their lives. I am
very proud of them."
