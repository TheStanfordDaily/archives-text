### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The perceived political rift between the United
States and Europe is "not very real," argued Bill Em
mott, editor in chief of the London-based Economist
magazine, in his speech to a full auditorium last Fri
day at the Graduate School of Business.
Emmott, addressing the potential war with Iraq
and the United States' role in international trade and
security, discussed European-American relations in
both a short-term and long-term framework. A self
proclaimed "non-European European" and recent
author of "20/21 Vision," a book that analyzes global
politics and economics, Emmott aimed to speak from
a world perspective rather than argue from a Euro
pean or American standpoint.
With respect to short-term policy in Iraq, Emmott
spoke of a conflict over words between Europe and
the United States, but argued there was an underly
ing understanding on a course of action.
"In the trans-Atlantic debate, there is a lot more
emphasis on the speaking Rumsfeld than there is
on the acting [Secretary of State Colin] Powell,"
said Emmott, referring to the common European
reaction to Secretary of Defense Donald Rums
feld's hawkish rhetoric. "But what's actually hap
pening in policy towards Iraq is the process of an
acting Powell."
"Europeans are playing a game of reluc
tance .. . and are beginning to see the effects of their
feet-dragging," he continued, predicting that France,
one of the most outspoken European countries
against current U.S. policy towards Iraq, will vote in
favor of a U.N. resolution support
ing action in Iraq.
"France does support the goal
in Iraq; it is desirous to disarm
Saddam Hussein," Emmott said.
"It disputes the speed of the
methodology to a degree, but it
wants to make sure its role in the
Security Council is acknowledged
and that it seems to have a spot
light in world affairs."
He continued, "The bottom
line of my view is that the apparent
trans-Adantic rift is not a very real
trans-Adantic rift."
The same view permeated
Emmott's analysis of economic
relations between the United
States and Europe. Arguments
over policies like the Kyoto Pro
tocol give the appearance of a
trans-Atlantic rift, Emmott said,
but ultimately both the United
States and Europe are facing the
same question: "Will the vibran
cy of capitalism and globalism
continue to woik in the future?
And is democracy capable of reg
ulating capitalism?"
As a "paranoid optimist," Em
mott said he believes the answer is
yes. Despite threats of terrorism,
economic slowdowns, corporate
deficits and instability in emerg
ing markets like Argentina, East
Asia and Russia, "the reality is that
the world has gotten better," Em
mott said. "Globalization, technol
ogy and the spread of democracy
all provide a strong foundation
for progress."
Emmott was also optimistic
about the long-term future of the
trans-Atlantic relationship. He
does not predict that the United
States will become an imperial
power.
"America is strong enough to
lead, but not strong enough to
dominate," he said.
Emmott said that talk of U.S.
primacy and empire is an over
simplified exaggeration of eco
nomic and military prowess. He
held that the United States, like
the Japan of the 1980s, should
not be seen as the primary eco
nomic power, but rather as a part
of the balance of power in inter

national trading. And, although
the United States is the world's
most powerful military entity, its
power must be balanced with its
limited usability in a pluralistic
democracy.
"The United States, because of
the checks and balances inherent
in a democratic system, is not able
to able to exercise the great mili
tary power that it has," said Bruce
McKearn, director of Stanford's
Sloan Program, which co-spon
sored the speech with the World
Affairs Council of Northern Cali
fornia. "This is something we all
understand, but which Emmott
articulated very clearly."
Emmott did not predict a long
term conflict between Europe
and the United States over cultur
al values, but some audience
members disagreed with his
analysis.
For example, Matthew Scott, a
second-year business student from
the United Kingdom, said that he
sees a clash between the United
States' cultural values of individual
ism and materialism, as demon
strated in their education and
health care programs, and Europe's
more socially based cultural values.
Most audience members read
The Economist on a regular basis
and praised the magazine for hav
ing well-articulated arguments.
The magazine is classically liberal
in its presentation of economic af
fairs — it supports a free-market
system — but is conservative con
cerning foreign affairs and the use
of military power.
William Jacobson, chair of the
Peninsula Chapter of the World
Affairs Council, said he has friends
who have cancelled the magazine
because they said it's either too lib
eral or too conservative.
Emmott said that his goal for
the magazine is "that we should be
very hard to categorize."
He also said that, although The
Economist is construed as a very
influential magazine read around
the world, his role as a journalist is
"not to influence, but to explain
and inform our readers. With over
400,000 readers in North America
and just under 400,000 in Europe,
we're in a position to help both
sides to learn more about one an
other, but we do not seek influence
as a target in and of itself."
