# EPATT panelists share tutoring insights
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday, nearly 100 Stanford East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring tutors
joined with members from area com
munities in a panel discussion on the
challenges that tutored students face in
East Palo Alto and what tutors can do
to become more effective instructors.
"This panel is for you," said East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring head
coordinator Kesha Weekes, who
opened the panel. "It's about practi
cality — for this week, not far off down
the road. This is about real-life skills
for you to go off and apply."
EPATT is a Stanford-run commu
nity service program that connects
Stanford students with residents of
East Palo Alto.
The panel consisted of Dean of Ed
ucation Deborah Stipek; Reverend
Jim Burklo, a campus minister and
leader of Reality Check Tours, a tour
of the economic and social realities of
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto; Meleini

Talakai, a mother of children tutored
through EPATT; and two high school
students tutored by EPATT since they
were in elementary school.
Stipek began the panel with an
overview of what she deemed the criti
cal ingredients in "learning motivation"
— competence and confidence, a feel
ing of control and connection.
Stipek and the other panelists of
fered suggestions on how tutors could
put these abstract traits into practice.
Many tutors had specific questions
about how best to interact with the kids
they tutor, though most felt that they
were already unconsciously using the
basic techniques.
"Does this stuff sound familiar to
you guys?" Stipek asked when ex
plaining the importance of encourage
ment coupled with critical feedback
and received a unanimous affirmative
head nod in response.
Talakai gave a powerful testimonial
about the important role that EPATT
has played for her and her children. A
college-educated woman from Tonga,

Talakai moved to East Palo Alto,
where she has raised her five children
alone.
While she works as a nurse at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, she said that most of
her peers work as babysitters or land
scapes because they lack the education
to find any other jobs. All five ofTalakai's
children are involved with EPATT, and
Talakai praised the program.
"We [East Palo Alto parents] have
very lofty hopes for our kids, but we
often think that having them in school
is enough," she said. "I wouldn't nor
mally think that I could do something
about it. Most of us don't think it be
hooves us to help our kids, and we as
sume failures are the teacher's fault. So
you're doing the things that we don't
get to do, either because we're working
or we don't know how to help our kids.
We are pure people who struggle every
day. Most of us have two or three jobs,
trying to make ends meet. Kids are ex
posed to higher expectations by work-

ing with you. They can hope for
better lives," Talakai said.
Talakai works to send her chil
dren to private school so that they
can get a good education, go to
college and live a life she said she
does not believe they can find in
East Palo Alto.
"What I see in East Palo Alto
doesn't make me think that my
kids will be exposed to what they
need to deal with the real world
[as adults], so I have chosen to put
them in private schools," she said.
Talakai also stressed the im
portance of relating to the East
Palo Alto kids as a mentor.
"Make it clear that you don't
live in heaven," she said. "There
are more similarities than not be
tween your adolescences and
theirs. You struggled in a well-to
do household with the same
things they do."
The two high school students,
named Drizelia and Mele, also
spoke. The students have been tu
tored by EPA 11 fora combined
total of over a dozen years and are

enrolled in area private high
schools.
They gave tutors advice based
on their first-hand experiences
with EPA IT.
"Sometimes your tutors are
like, 'Oh good job' when we get a
C," said Mele. "But no, that's not
good. We want the A and need
you to tell us to get that."
Drizella emphasized the signif
icance of the tutor's relationship
to the younger student.
"I have to set an example for
my younger brothers," she said.
"So I want a tutor who's going to
guide me to the right path."
Roth stressed the difficulties
that students face in East Palo
Alto.
"I'm so lucky to be in my posi
tion [in private school] and not
have to go through what the
[other] East Palo Alto kids are deal
ing with, with drugs and pregnan
cy and failing out," Mele said.
Both girls expressed gratitude
for the EPATT program and their
tutoring experiences. Drizella
summed up the spirit of the meet
ing with her closing words.
"You all are like older brothers
and sisters. You do influence what
we do."
