# ACLU activists meet
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
.Amid a potential war with Iraq
and a legislative effort to extend the
USA Patriot Act, students from
schools around the Bay Area met on
Saturday at Stanford to discuss col
lege activist efforts supporting civil
liberties.
The forum, sponsored by the
Berkeley Student Caucus and the
Stanford Cavil liberties Union, was
run by the Northern California
branch of the American Civil Liber
ties Union. It examined how the Pa
triot Act has affected the rights of
college students and what they
could do to respond.
According to freshman John
Hamilton, president of the SCLU,
the primary goals of the conference
were to educate students about civil
liberties and to help energize stu
dents. He added that the meeting
also raised awareness of the SCLU,
which has 25 members and was
founded this year.
The conference speakers, who
talked about both historical and
contemporary situations, laid out
how civil liberties have been in
fringed upon in the past and dis
cussed the future potential for in
fringement â€” especially in light of a
war with Iraq or another terrorist at
tack. They also repeatedly high
lighted a legislative effort to extend
the Patriot Act, which was leaked to
the public on Friday, as one of the
dangers of not being vigilant about
civil liberties.
Morton Sobell, who was convict
ed of conspiracy with the Rosen

bergs during the McCarthy era and
served 18 years in prison, gave the
60 students in attendance a histori
cal perspective on the current era.
"History is continuous," he said.
"We've had attacks on the Constitu
tion frequendy."
Sobell was direct about his con
cerns.
"We have a bunch of right-wing
crazies in the White House," he said.
Benafsheh Akhlaghi spoke of her
recent work as a lawyer for registra
tion detainees in the Bay Area.
"Before, we had the red scare,"
she said. "Now we have the Middle
East and Muslim scare."
Akhlaghi underscored her expe
rience as one of the few lawyers un
dertaking pro bono work to help
students with visa delays, green
card holders questioned by the FBI
and grandparents detained due to
INS paperwork failures.
She told stories of clients who
disappeared in INS custody and
hinted at the horror stories of
those not lucky enough to know a
lawyer. Akhlaghi also explained
that the Patriot Act has made
minor paperwork issues into jail
worthy offenses.
"Are we counting leads or are we
counting heads?" she asked, ques
tioning whether investigative efforts
have targeted legitimate terror sus
pects or innocent foreigners.
Akhlaghi implored students to
become active in opposing further
civil liberties infringements.
"You're the ones who make ac
tivism 'activism,'" she said.
The audience broke up into
smaller groups for workshops, in

which ACLU representatives
talked about their experiences
fighting the Patriot Act and its im
plementation. The groups then
discussed how to educate people
about civil liberties and speak out
against the Patriot Act.
Maria Archuleta of the ACLU
gave a presentation on organizing
campus campaigns. She said that
campus police departments, li
braries and administrations were all
possible places to look for infringe
ments.
"This assault on civil liberties is
coming to a campus near you, and
it's coming soon," said Mark Schlos
berg, speaking in particular about
police monitoring of student groups
and cooperation with the FBI.
Brad Moore, a freshman, stated
that, although he was not a member
of the Stanford Civil Liberties

Union, he probably would be soon.
"Hearing my concerns spoken
by people with more authority and
more knowledge reassures me," he
said.
Students at the conference noted
that although the ACLU does not
have a position on war with Iraq,
civil liberties activism could comple
ment war protests.
"I think that war organizing and
civil liberties organizing go hand-in
hand," said Berkeley freshman
Lindsay Waggerman, who orga
nized the conference.
Although the tone of the confer
ence was not optimistic about civil
liberties, it was optimistic in terms of
campus activism.
"The future doesn't look good,"
Sobell said. "But it depends on how
many people are willing to be out
there opposing it."
