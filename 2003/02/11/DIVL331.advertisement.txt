Archaeological Excavation at El Presidio de San Francisco
.
This summer, dig into California's past by participating first-hand in archaeo
logical research at the Presidio of San Francisco! Excavate and document finds,
process artifacts, and conduct laboratory research as integral members of a re
search team based in the center of Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

The Research Project
P res idio de San Francisco was the first
Spanish-colonial settlement in the San
C * SC ° W^ S moSt remote an d isolated
Presidio housed a diverse population of set-
j tiers from present-day Northwest Mexico
3 !as well as Native Californians. The archaeo
logical site includes the architectural re
mains of the settlement's main quadrangle
and central plaza, as well as rich deposits of material culture. The surrounding
landscape contains remnants of outlying settlements and agricultural activities.
The project runs from July 7-August 22,2003, and is directed by CASA Professor
Barbara Voss. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the complex inter
actions between colonial and native populations in 18th and 19th century Califor
nia, and to trace the emergence of the City of San Francisco from its origins at the
Presidio.
