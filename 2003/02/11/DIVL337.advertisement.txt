The Earned Income
Tax Credit.
You may
have earned
it. Why
not claim it?
If you're working hard just
to make ends meet and
have one or more children
living with you, you may
qualify for the EITC. Think
of it as a reward for doing
one of life's most beautiful,
most important and most
loving jobs. Visit our Web
site or ask your tax preparer
if you qualify.
Because when it comes to
getting more for your family,
consider it done.
