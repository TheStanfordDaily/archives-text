Selah's Bed: A Novel
by Jenoyne Adams
Tuesday, February 11, 2003
7pm • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Selah Wells, a successful pho
tographer, is an emotionally
remote and sexually vora
cious woman. Though she
loves her minister husband,
Parker, she is also regularly
unfaithful to him. Adams
weaves the story of Selah's
childhood with that of her
troubled marriage. The girl
grew up with a neglectful
and promiscuous mother,
an absent father and a
grandmother who slowly
became addicted to
painkillers. Selah is raped by
a friend's brother at 13, and
her strong spirit and
precocious sexuality are
sharply reined in by this
abrupt introduction to adult
hood. As she grows up, Selah
finds a refuge from the emo
tional chaos of her youth in
photography. It gives her
power over her male subjects
and allows her to foil their
expectations by refusing to
sleep with them. Yet when
she falls in love for the first
time with one of her clients,
the tensions in her marriage
come to a head. "You read
this prose with a visceral
pleasure ... " Janet Fitch,
author of White Oleander.
