## Judge upholds city's refusal of war protest 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Citing safety
concerns in "this time of height
ened security," a federaljudge yes
terday upheld the city's refusal to
allow anti-war demonstrators to
march past the United Nations on
Saturday.
U.S. District Judge Barbara S.
Jones said the demonstrators' First
Amendment rights were not vio
lated by the city's decision to con
fine the protest to a plaza near the
U.N. complex.
"The city's restriction on
marching is not a restriction on
pure speech, but rather a restric
tion on the manner in which plain
tiff may communicate its mes
sage," Jones wrote.
The protest is being organized
by United for Peace and Justice, a
coalition that is sponsoring rallies
throughout the world on Saturday.
The coalition filed an appeal
yesterday in federal court, where
the case is expected to be heard
today or tomorrow, said Chris
Dunn, a lawyer with the New York
Civil Liberties Union.
"We are outraged that Judge
Jones did not see fit to uphold our
fundamental constitutional right of
the people to engage in peaceful
marches, ft is yet another example
of the damage that is being done to
our constitutional democracy in a
post 9-11 environment," said Leslie
Cagan, a leader of the coalition.
In her ruling, Jones noted that
the United Nations was "uniquely
sensitive among locations in New
York City because of its function,

our country's treaty obligations
and its history as a terrorist tar
get."
She said that since the Sept. 11,
2001 terrorist attack on the World
Trade Center, the city has banned
all demonstrations, parades or
other public events in front of the
United Nations.
"This policy is all inclusive,
makes no reference to the content
of the regulated speech and does
not distinguish between event or
ganizers or their views," she said.
Jones also agreed with the city's
argument that the march is ex
pected to be too large for the po
lice department to secure the land
mark.
Saying that police concerns
about security threats were "far
from theoretical," the judge noted
that the United Nations was
among five landmarks targeted by
terrorists in a failed plot in 1993. A
dozen men were convicted and
sentenced to long prison terms.
Dunn, of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, had argued that
the city was using "a theoretical
possibility something terrible is
going to happen to cancel the
right of people to participate in
peaceful protest."
South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled
to speak at the rally, said he was
puzzled by the city's action.
"I really cannot believe that a
major city in the leading democra
cy in the world can refuse people
this particular right," he said.
