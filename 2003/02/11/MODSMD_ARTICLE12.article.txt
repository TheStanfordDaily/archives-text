UNITLD NATIONS (AP) — Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said yesterday he
has invited the U.N. Security Council to
discuss humanitarian planning in case
of war in Iraq but he still hopes fora
peaceful solution.
"We are doing contingency planning
... so that we'll not be caught unpre
pared if. .. things were to go in the mil
itary way," he said. "We've had enough
experience in other crises to understand
that we should make some arrange
ments and preparations."
Annan invited the 15 council mem
bers to meet with him on Thursday, two
days before Switzerland hosts an inter
national conference in Geneva to pre
pare for the humanitarian conse
quences of a war in Iraq.
Aid organizations and all council na
tions have been invited to the weekend
meeting, but the U.S. announced yester
day it will not attend because U.N. agen
cies have made extensive preparations.
The United Nations appealed for
$37.4 million in December to get food
and other humanitarian supplies in
place in case of war in Iraq. Last week,

the United States announced a $15 mil
lion contribution. The U.N. High Com
missioner for Refugees said other coun
tries have contributed nearly $900,000
and more donations are expected.
Annan will brief the council on two
months of preparations led by Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette,
who heads a top-level U.N. group on
humanitarian coordination.
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond
has said the United Nations is con
cerned about possible shortages of food,
drinking water, winterized shelters, san
itation, and other basic services. It is also
concerned that large numbers of people
will flee their homes in the event of war,
and is assessing the dangers that the use
of different weapons would pose, in
cluding weapons of mass destruction
and land mines, he said.
One guide for humanitarian agen
cies has been the Gulf War.
Alter Iraq's August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and before the Gulf War began
in January 1991, about 700,000 people
fled Iraq and Kuwait, a large number of
them foreign workers.
