# Housing groups propose ways to reduce prices

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The government
should expand tax credits for homeowners
and create new incentives to increase the na
tion's supply of affordable housing as ways to
spur economic growth and increase home
ownership in America, housing industry
groups said yesterday.
A record 68 percent of U.S. residents owned
their homes last year, though rates are lower for
minority groups and those in lower income
brackets. For example, while the minority
homeownership rate reached a record high last
year, it still trailed the national average.

The housing coalition said implementing a
homeownership tax credit similar to the one
proposed by President Bush in his 2004 budget
would create new jobs and bring private invest
ment to economically distressed neighbor
hoods. Such a credit also would boost home
ownership rates among people of all back
grounds and income levels, the groups said.
The coalition included advocates for the
poor, as well as the National Association of
Home Builders and the Mortgage Bankers As
sociation of America.
At a news conference yesterday, they said

Congress and the president also should look at
ways to increase the number of affordable
rentals by improving several other programs
that help low- and moderate-income families.
Programs include one that gives tax credits to
residents and another that allows poor families
to use vouchers to rent private apartments.
"We shouldn't forget that what little strength
this economy has had is largely attributable to
the housing market," said coalition member
Barton Harvey, chief executive officer of The
Enterprise Foundation, which advocates af
fordable housing.
