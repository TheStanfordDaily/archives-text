During the first couple of weeks
of each quarter, Stanford stu
dents are allowed a shopping
period where they may attend
classes they are interested in taking with
out officially pre-registering.
As the Undergraduate Standards and
Policy Committee of the Faculty Senate
continues to address this important
course registration matter, we believe that
there are important advantages to stu
dents that need to be taken into account.
Because the committee only includes
three students, we feel that a comprehen
sive student survey should be taken be
fore any decisions are made.
The shopping system distinguishes
Stanford from other institutions. While in
the midst of taking final exams, students
at other colleges around the country must
also decide what classes they will take the
following term. For students trying to bal
ance their schedules, fitting in General
Education Requirements, major prereq
uisites and other requirements, the shop
ping period has proven to be a great way
to determine a manageable courseload.
But to professors trying to figure out how
many teaching assistants to hire or how
large the class will be, the shopping peri
od is filled with many uncertainties.
By attending the first few lectures, stu
dents can witness the professors' styles,
class format and workload. This provides
a valuable wav to see if the course fits both

interest and scheduling constraints. As
many students can attest, a three-unit
computer science course can be very dif
ferent from a five-unit more relaxed sem
inar.
The course shopping period also eases
the pressure of registering for courses be
fore the quarter starts. Students have a lit
tle more time to decide what to take and
can consult their advisers upon their re
turn to campus.
Nonetheless, we recognize that the
course shopping period inconveniences
faculty members and we believe that per
haps a compromise can be found. Many
classes already use the Coursework Web
site to access assignments, assign reading,
and make class announcements. We pro
pose that this Web site be used to deter
mine approximate class sizes. Students
could indicate interest in taking a class on
the Web site on the first few days of class
es, perhaps on a scale of how likely they
were to take the class, giving professors a
better idea of the size of the class.
Stanford students are already under a
lot of pressure during finals week and
treasure the somewhat worry-free breaks
in between quarters. Keeping the current
shopping period will continue to assist
students in making the best choices for
their academic careers and provided that
some form of non-binding pre-registra
tion is possible, we believe this system
could continue to work.
