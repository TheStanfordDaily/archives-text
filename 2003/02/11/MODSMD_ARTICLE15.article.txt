# Completing diversity
## 
### 
As part of Stanford's ongoing com
mitment to promoting diversity on
campus, the School of Humanities
and Sciences has appointed two of
its doctoral alumni to oversee minority re
cruitment for its graduate program.
The Diversity Action Council's timing and
selection are both ideal. Formerly managed by
a single assistant dean, the school's minority
recruitment program will now be led by two
carefully selected appointees, each of whom
has witnessed the virtues of Stanford's diverse
community firsthand. Stephanie Fryberg,
who will focus on the school's departments of
humanities and social sciences, lectures for the
Native American Community Cultural Center
and co-coordinates the Stanford Native Amer
ican Graduate Student Organization.
Joseph Brown, who will be revamping
multicultural recruitment for the school's de
partments of natural sciences, remembers
personally benefiting from Stanford's diverse
environment as one of the department's
graduate students and later in the Depart
ment of Psychology's doctoral program.
Stanford's decision to support affirmative

action in light of the University of Michigan
Supreme Court case illustrates that the Uni
versity values and actively promotes diversi
ty. These appointments represent a well
timed concentration on diversity within the
graduate community. As multiculturalism
continues to grow throughout the United
States and California in particular, Stanford's
commitment to reflecting this trend affirms
its role in promoting awareness and support
of diversity.
In focusing minority recruitment efforts
however, we hope that the new assistant deans
will also work to increase the presence of so
cioeconomic, as well as ethnic, diversity. Al
though stressing one often bolsters the other,
it is nevertheless essential to maintain a joint
commitment to both primary facets of Ameri
can, as well as global, diversity. As the Univer
sity takes this important step in promoting di
versity in the often-overlooked graduate pro
grams, it must not ignore class barriers and is
sues facing other, non-ethnically slated minori
ties. Only by keeping this in mind can the
newly anointed assistant deans address the
complete meaning of diversity.
