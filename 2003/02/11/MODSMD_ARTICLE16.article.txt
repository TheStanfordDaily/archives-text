# THE
						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## From yellow to orange 
### 
Several days ago, the
Homeland Security
Council changed the gen
eral U.S. threat level from
yellow (elevated) to orange (spe
cific and credible threats). Ail cit
izens have been warned — in the
sternest terms President Bush
could muster while still speaking
with a half-smile — to be "dili
gent, aware and alert." Accord
ing to Secretary of Defense Don
ald Rumsfeld, the threat of ter
rorism on U.S. soil is absolutely
"imminent."
As I hopped on my skateboard
in the cool mist last Friday morn
ing, I asked myself what exactly
the Bush administration expect
ed of me and all the other stu
dents on campuses across the na
tion to do. Should I dress down
and make my usual rounds
across Stanford, except this time,
stop indiscreetly by the Claw and
examine my environs for any
suspicious activities? Should I
test my lettuce wraps for biologi
cal agents before lunch?
It's painfully clear that the ad
ministration's statement came in
one ear and out the other for most
rationally thinking college stu
dents. But wait a minute — "im
minent" means "likely occur at any
moment," doesn't it? Shouldn't we
be making peace with our enemies
and flying home to be with our
families before the world ends?
As I see it, there are only three
ways the administration's state
ment can be explained:
First, "The Good Politician Sce
nario": The administration and in
telligence community is genuinely
concerned by the increased "intel
ligence chatter" over the last few
weeks and feels that common citi
zens can make a difference. By
warning the general populace,
they will be able to identify domes

tic threats more efficiently.
Second, "The Cover-My-Ass
Scenario": Being the law makers
that they are, the administration
realizes the potentially catastroph
ic political implications of a suc
cessful terrorist attack without
forewarning. Raising the threat
levels allows the tribal council to
avoid slips in percentage points
and future lawsuits. It's along the

same lines of the
"Condoleezza
Rice had al-Qaida
threats sitting on
her desk months
before Sept. 11"
argument. By
warning us now,
they can save
their asses later.

Finally,"The Cold War Revisit
ed Scenario": Find and replace all
references to "Russia" with the
phrase "worldwide fundamental
ist Islamic movement." According
to the Bush administration, there
are "impending and credible
threats" from multiple sources
that a specific group of gentlemen
— which happen to be different
from us — are out to get us. It's
U.S. or them.
By way of general knowledge,
we can rule out the "Good Politi
cian Scenario." Yes, I can believe
that there has been increased intel
ligence chatter which correlates to
the upcoming start of the Hajj. But
no, this scenario doesn't hold: I
cannot believe that warning me, a
21-year old from Stanford, will
save lives as I tackle Bin Laden's
nephew outside P.F. Chang's, as
heroic as that would be. As confi
dent as I am that the administra
tion believes in me, I don't think
the CIA needs me to watch its
back.
The "Cover-My-Ass Scenario,"
while a distinct possibility, seems

unlikely fora few reasons. First of
all, it's an enormous effort for the
administration to coordinate, just
for the recovery of a few votes ex
post facto. Second, the nature of die
language used in the warning
seems particularly strong and spe
cific, citing "the possibility of a
chemical, radiological, or biological
attack" targeting large buildings on
the East Coast. This doesn't seem
like a blanket warning to me.
And so we arrive at option three,
the "Cold War Revisited Scenario,"
which has a sliding scale of gravity.
On the more benign end on this
scale is the possibility that this
warning is little more than "the boy
who cried wolf scenario" since "all
of our emergency response teams
were already on highest alert be
fore the warning," according to
William Waugh, professor of pub
lic administration and urban stud
ies at Georgia State University in
Atlanta. Waugh, an expert on in
ternational and domestic terrorism
expressed these concerns about
the change in warning in a recent
CNN article, "We're on high alert:
Now what?" (Feb. 7)
A more disturbing possibility is
the likelihood that the administra
tion is trying to drum up support
fora war in Iraq by sending many
unwary citizens into a state of fear.
Not the average college student,
but the millions of Americans who
have been glued to their TV sets
since talk of war began months
ago. W'hile such a tactic should log
ically work to support the adminis
tration's cause, I see the long-term
effects as grim.
First, we're creating a national
enemy whose boundaries are not
clearly defined; while most college
students can accurately discern the
meaning of "fundamentalist Is
