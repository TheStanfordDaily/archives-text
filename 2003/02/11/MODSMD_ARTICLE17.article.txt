Consequences of war involve entire
world'
In his speech to the United Nations
on Feb. 5, Secretary of State Colin
Powell once again emphasized the
need for war on Iraq. And yet, many
around the world are not convinced
that such a war is necessary and legiti
mate.
By trying to establish a tie between
Iraq and al-Qaida, it appears that the
Bush administration is playing on
fears of terrorism to sell a war on Iraq.
The current political establishment
is using the same fear to curtail civil
liberties. Many legal immigrants are
afraid to exercise their right to free
speech for fear of random arrests and
deportations. We all know what hap
pened when immigrants voluntarily
registered themselves with the Immi
gration and Naturalization Service last
December. Random arrests and the re
moval of civil rights was the answer to
the goodwill of these people.
Why should the United States care.

since legal aliens are not allowed to
vote? Citizens should care because
there can be no democracy without
civil liberties. Those for and against
the war should feel free to express
themselves, regardless of their origin.
Furthermore, the U.S. government
leaders need to listen to public opinion
in other countries. They might not
care about the polls in Britain, Ger
many, France, China or Canada, but
the consequences of this war involve
the entire world. This is why the Unit
ed Nations exists and why no action
can or should be taken without its en
dorsement.

Dangerous area to bike
I am concerned about the safety on
Via Pueblo Mall, which is a road be
tween the engineering quad and the
Packard engineering building. Just
this Wednesday, there was an accident
involving a bike and a car. I happened
to pass by this area and saw that the bi
cylist was pretty badly hurt.

Over the past year, I have seen
more than two incidents involving a
bicycle and a car. I believe that noth
ing has been done to stop these types
of actions. I think it is important to
raise the level of awareness about the
high risks on this road.

Better traffic and parking planning, not
more citations
As a student who has been involved
in several bicycle accidents, the last
one being quite serious, I appreciate
the need for increased public safety
efforts and the efforts undertaken by
the officers of Stanford's Department
of Public Safety.
However, I am alarmed at the large
number of citations listed in the arti
cle "Public safety head reports stats
for 2002" (Feb. 7). About 44,000 cita
tions averages to three citations for
every person on the Stanford campus.
The number of citations for bicycle
law infractions approximates the

number of bicycles stolen. More
alarming is fact that the number
would be "much higher" if there were
more officers.
The solution, though, is not more
officers and most definitely not more
citations. Rather, the solution is to
have better traffic and parking plan
ning.
Re-engineering the traffic flow on
campus will not only improve safety,
but will also improve air quality and
make the campus more accessible.
Clearly, there are several details that
need to be worked out. Perhaps our
Provost John Etchemendy, in addition
to applauding "the best public safety
department of any university," will con
sider forming a committee to address
the root of any traffic problems pre
sent. This will allow our department of
public safety to focus its attention on
more pressing problems such as the
staggering number of bicycle thefts and
our "appalling" alcohol problem.
Also, making bicyclists stop so often
is inefficient: The momentum is lost
and has to be regained.
A new approach is needed to recti
fy the situation. I would also recom

mend that pedestrians — in addition
to all bicyclists — consider wearing
helmets.
