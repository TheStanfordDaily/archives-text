## Stanford ties UCLA 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The No. 1 UCLA women's
gymnastics team (8-1-1, 3-1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) had its worst
fear confirmed Friday night when
the results of its dual meet against
No. 8 Stanford (7-1-1, 3-0-1) were
announced.
UCLA: 197.45. Stanford:
197.45. The Bruins have met their
match.
"When you go against a great
team like UCLA, you have to be
great as well," coach Kristen Smyth
said. "Our girls stepped it up and
I'm really proud of their perfor
mance."
There are two ways UCLA
could rationalize the tie: Either
they didn't perform to their true
potential or judges gave the Cardi
nal an extra tip.
The Bruins suffered their only
loss this season at Oregon State,
forced to count an 8.750 on the bal
ance beam during a rotation rid
dled with uncharacteristic falls. Up
until that lackluster set, UCLA held
a handy lead over the Beavers.
At Stanford, however, UCLA did
not count a fall and threw huge skills
on every event, catching up with the
Cardinal on beam to seal the tie.
As for the judging, it was two
Bruins who received perfect 10s at
Burnham Pavilion, while the last 10
scored by a Cardinal was on Feb. 21,
2000. Although UCLA might like to
believe otherwise, the simple truth is
that Stanford gave the Bruins a run
for their money.
"This meet really showcased the
character of our team," senior Alissa
Cooper said." Every time UCLA put

up a high score, we answered with
an equally great performance."
The star of the night for the Car
dinal was freshman Natalie Foley,
who chalked up career highs on
every event and won the all-around
with a 39.725 —just 0.275 points
from a perfect tour de force.
Following Foley's lead, the Car
dinal showcased both its strength
and resilience for the capacity crowd
of 1,205.
"There were many opportunities
where nerves could have gotten the
better of the team, but they didn't let
anything faze them," Smyth said.
The Cardinal started the night
on the vaulting table, when Foley
and freshmen Jessica Louie and
Glyn Sweets contributed clutch per
formances. Louie's back injury,
which kept her out of competition
until Jan. 31, seemed a tiling of the
past as she scored a 9.85 at the top of
the vault lineup. Foley scored a
9.925 and Sweets' 9.95 took second
on die apparatus.
UCLA's simultaneous set on
the uneven bars was solid, ending
with former Olympian and last
year's NCAA all-around champi
on Jamie Dantzscher scoring a 10.
Combined with the steps Bruins
took on landings, UCLAcouldjust
barely keep up with Stanford's
clean execution.
The rotation ended in a tie at
49.350, marking the second-best
team score on vault in Cardinal
history.
"This week we focused on taking
care of the details in the gym,"
Smyth said. "When you work on the
details of landings, form, and execu
tion, then the big picture can also
come together."

After the second rotation, despite
UCLA junior Jeanette Antolin's 10
on vault, Stanford took a slim lead.
Foley and Sweets traded the scores
they earned on vault, tallying 9.95
and 9.925 on bars, respectively. Ju
nior Lise Leveille turned in a career

high 9.9 to push the Cardinal ahead
by 0.15.

Friday night."
That extra energy propelled
Stanford through the last two rota
tions. The always-consistent beam
lineup turned in scores ranging
from 9.825 to junior Lindsay
Wing's 9.95 while the floor exercise
saw great performances by the Car
dinal, most notably Foley's 9.95.
The Bruins made their come

score of 49.575 to catch up with
Stanford. The rally began mid-line
