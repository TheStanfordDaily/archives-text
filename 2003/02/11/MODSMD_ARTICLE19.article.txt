# Perfecting their technique by competing in the Heritage Indoor Classic
## Track prepares for big tourneys 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field
teams were fairly quiet this week
end at the Heritage Indoor Classic
in Boise, just as the national scene
was heating up.
Using this meet as a chance to
give the sprints and field events an
opportunity to perfect their tech
nique, starts and competitive
drive, the Cardinal posted three
qualifying marks for the Indoor
National Championships in
March.
Junior Ail-American Jillian Ca
marena highlighted the No. 6
Cardinal women's effort on Satur
day by posting an automatic qual
ifying distance with her third
place finish in the shot put. Ca
marena's throw of 53 feet, 10.5
inches marks the second time in
two weekends that she has
eclipsed the standard.
After missing the provisional
standard in the 200-meter dash in
her previous two outings, fresh
man Ashley Purnell eclipsed the
24-second barrier by posting a win
in 23.88 seconds. Purnell's time is
also the top in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation this season.
Her win led a 1-2-3 Stanford
sweep of the event as freshman

Jessica Pluth and the Stanford track and field squad will try to toss out the
competition in the upcoming weeks. The Cardinal will face a tough test this
weekend in Seattle at the Washington Indoor Invitational.
