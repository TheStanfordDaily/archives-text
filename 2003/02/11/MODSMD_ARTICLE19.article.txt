# Perfecting their technique by competing in the Heritage Indoor Classic
## Track prepares for big tourneys 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field
teams were fairly quiet this week
end at the Heritage Indoor Classic
in Boise, just as the national scene
was heating up.
Using this meet as a chance to
give the sprints and field events an
opportunity to perfect their tech
nique, starts and competitive
drive, the Cardinal posted three
qualifying marks for the Indoor
National Championships in
March.
Junior Ail-American Jillian Ca
marena highlighted the No. 6
Cardinal women's effort on Satur
day by posting an automatic qual
ifying distance with her third
place finish in the shot put. Ca
marena's throw of 53 feet, 10.5
inches marks the second time in
two weekends that she has
eclipsed the standard.
After missing the provisional
standard in the 200-meter dash in
her previous two outings, fresh
man Ashley Purnell eclipsed the
24-second barrier by posting a win
in 23.88 seconds. Purnell's time is
also the top in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation this season.
Her win led a 1-2-3 Stanford
sweep of the event as freshman

Jessica Pluth and the Stanford track and field squad will try to toss out the
competition in the upcoming weeks. The Cardinal will face a tough test this
weekend in Seattle at the Washington Indoor Invitational.
Jakki Bailey (24.50) placed second
and sophomore Christine
Moschella (24.74) set her season
best to take third.
"The coaching staff is really
pleased with the progress the ath
letes are making," said assistant
coach Mike Reilly. "Everyone
seems to be tuning up well and
competing well. . .we are really
excited to get everyone going and
seeing some good performances
at the MPSF Championships,
which is our focus for the indoor
season."
The Stanford women also got a
win from the 1600-meter relay
team as it improved on its season
best to claim first by nearly six sec
onds in 3 minutes, 44.70 seconds.
Freshman Nashonme Johnson

claimed second for the Cardinal in
the 400 with her season best of
56.12 seconds while junior Lind
sey Johnson and sophomore Un
dine Becker claimed third (8.49)
and fifth (8.67), respectively, in
60-meter hurdles.
Junior Leila Ben-Youssef led
three Stanford pole vaulters into
the top six. Ben-Youssef (third
tie), senior Kathleen Donoghue
(third-tie) and freshman Saman
tha Shepard (sixth-tie) all cleared
3.71 meters, but Shepard had
more misses at that height.
The Cardinal received a trio of
fourth-place finishes from the
women's field events.
Senior Kim Stone claimed
fourth in the high jump, clearing
1.65 meters, while junior Jessica
Pluth claimed fourth with a throw
of 58-1.75 in the weight throw.
Sophomore Undine Becker
jumped 17-11.75 in the long jump
for fourth, as well.

Senior Nick Welihozkiy led the
No. 3 men's team with a provi
sional qualifying throw of 65-1.50
and second-place finish in the 35
lb. weight throw. This is the third
weekend in a row that Welihozkiy
has hit the standard.
The Cardinal had four jumpers
in the top six as Milton Little
claimed second in 23-0.75 and ju
nior OJ Atogwe (22-6.50) and
freshman Joshua Hustedt (22-
2.25) both improved their season
bests to claim third and fourth, re
spectively.
Stanford's 1600-meter relay
team posted a 3:13.10 to claim a
close second behind rival Texas.
The Cardinal's time now ranks it
first in the MPSF.
Junior Justin Williams made
his season debut with a fourth
place finish in the 60-meter hur
dles after clocking at 8.06 seconds,
the third fastest time of the day, in
the preliminaries.

Freshman TJ Rushings fin
ished second in his heat and 10th
overall but improved on his sea
son best in the 200 with a 22.04.
Texas sprinters dominated the
race by putting four in the top
eight, asserting the Longhorns as
a national power in the sprints.
The Cardinal also received a
pair of fourth places from its dis
tance runners. Sophomore Justin
Romaniuk ran 1:54.15 in the 800
while freshman Sean Drake im
proved on his season best in the
mile, covering the distance in
4:17.80.

Sebes garnered a fifth place finish
for Stanford with a time of 48.23.
This event also saw the debut of
returning All-American sopho
more Curtis Goehring after suf
fering an injury during training.
He claimed ninth in 48.68 sec
onds.
The Cardinal returns to action

this Saturday in Seattle at the
Washington Indoor Invitational.
Most of the distance squad and
many on the sprint and field
squads will be in action.
After this past weekend, the
Stanford men's national class mid
dle-distance runners will have
their work cut out as four colle
giate athletes ran under 4:00 for
the mile in the Meyo Mile at Notre
Dame, including the top time in
the world this year (3:57.80) by the
Irish's Luke Watson. The Track
wire favorite for the indoor mile,
junior Don Sage, has yet to run a
qualifying time this year.
"We are looking forward to the
outdoor season and at the Pac-10
Championships," Reilly said.
"But, when it comes time for
championship competitions,
though, our athletes will be able to
put themselves in a position to do
well. I have confidence that they
will be able to challenge fora title."
