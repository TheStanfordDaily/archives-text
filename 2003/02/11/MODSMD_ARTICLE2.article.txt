# Wolfram gives new outlook

### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All natural systems, from trees to the
human mind, are so complex that humans
cannot completely understand them, said
Stephen Wolfram, creator of the computer
program Mathematica, in a lecture last night
at a packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Wolfram
discussed a new framework for studying com
plicated physical structures — an approach
that has set off a debate within the scientific
community over the validity of his claims.
In contrast to most scientists, Wolfram ar
gued that it is a set of simple rules — not nec
essarily mathematical equations — that ex
plain the components of the universe.
He described how he has devoted the last
20 years of his life to discovering this frame
work, the topic of his recent book, "A New
Kind of Science."
Wolfram, who published his first scientif

ic paper at 15 and got his doctorate from Cal
tech at 20, has not published a scientific
paper for 10 years while he has worked to
unify and extend the theory that he believes
can find fundamental rules to describe the
universe.
Wolfram said that the scientific approach
he had been taught in school was not solving
certain complex problems that he wanted to
solve, like how snowflakes were created.
"I began to wonder whether there might
be a fundamental problem with the ap
proach I was taking," he said.
Wolfram said he went back to the basics,
looking for simple rules that would explain
complex, seemingly random behavior that
conventional physics and biology could not.
He found the basic solution in a type of phe
nomena called cellular automata — a con
struct that illustrates the complexity of sim-

pie rules in visual patterns.
"[My discoveries] gradually
overturned everything I thought I
knew about science," he said.
Wolfram used his program
Mathematica, which he said was as
revolutionary as telescopes or mi
croscopes, to simulate and under
stand a variety of different cellular
automata.
Then he extended his discover
ies about complexity within sys
tems to other fields.
First, he described prime distri
butions, digits of pi and partial dif
ferential equations in mathemat
ics. Then he explained how his
ideas of simple rules leading to
complex systems related to physi
cal situations like fluid flow and
entropy.
Moving on to biology, Wolfram
laid out how he could explain one
of the inherent problems in natur
al selection, the evolution of com
plexity.
"It has never been clear why
natural selection leads to much
complexity at all," he said. "Nat
ural selection seems to be quite
good [only] on smooth parame
ters."
Wolfram said that natural se
lection does not explain why cer
tain complex structures appear
in nature as well as his theory
does.
Wolfram said he has concluded
that nature is one large computer,
inherently complex and difficult
to understand, but fundamentally
governed by simple interactions.
The complexity that results from
these systems cannot be avoided,

he said, and many fundamental
processes, especially in biology,
cannot be predicted by human in
genuity.
Wolfram moved back to
physics, where he laid out a basic
theory for how the most impor
tant properties of the universe
could be deducted from a sense of
space and time as a network of
points.
"I think that in an ultimate
model, one needs only space,"
Wolfram declared.
Like many of Wolfram's
ideas, his idea fora unified
physics — based not on tradi
tional principles but on simple
interactions between nothing
that looks like space or time — is
"something that at first seems
crazy," he said.
Wolfram emphasized what he
saw as the groundbreaking na
ture of his theory, and claimed
that his book has caused "all the
signs of a paradigm shift."
"One just needs this little rule,"
he said, referring to his theory of
computational equivalence.
"[Then] there are lots of everyday
systems that are universal."
With everything in nature
being a system of the same com
plexity, he concluded, it is only
natural that science has gone
down a narrow path and failed to
solve some of the perplexing mys
teries of life, such as the problem
of free will.
Wolfram said that these com
plexities are exacdy what he had
figured out, and he went on to hint
at why his theories solve the need
for God and explain why extrater
restrial intelligence is so hard to
find.
"My book is really just the be
ginning," he said.
