# Wolfram gives new outlook

All natural systems, from trees to the
human mind, are so complex that humans
cannot completely understand them, said
Stephen Wolfram, creator of the computer
program Mathematica, in a lecture last night
at a packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Wolfram
discussed a new framework for studying com
plicated physical structures — an approach
that has set off a debate within the scientific
community over the validity of his claims.
In contrast to most scientists, Wolfram ar
gued that it is a set of simple rules — not nec
essarily mathematical equations — that ex
plain the components of the universe.
He described how he has devoted the last
20 years of his life to discovering this frame
work, the topic of his recent book, "A New
Kind of Science."
Wolfram, who published his first scientif

ic paper at 15 and got his doctorate from Cal
tech at 20, has not published a scientific
paper for 10 years while he has worked to
unify and extend the theory that he believes
can find fundamental rules to describe the
universe.
Wolfram said that the scientific approach
he had been taught in school was not solving
certain complex problems that he wanted to
solve, like how snowflakes were created.
"I began to wonder whether there might
be a fundamental problem with the ap
proach I was taking," he said.
Wolfram said he went back to the basics,
looking for simple rules that would explain
complex, seemingly random behavior that
conventional physics and biology could not.
He found the basic solution in a type of phe
nomena called cellular automata — a con
struct that illustrates the complexity of sim-
