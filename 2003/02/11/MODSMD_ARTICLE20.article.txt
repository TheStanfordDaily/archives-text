# Dreaming of unemployment line
## 
### 
When I was a kid, I
wanted nothing so
badly as to be a pro
fessional football
player. I was going to be the quar
terback that set all the records, got
all the girls, and made the millions
and millions of dollars. When I
walked down the street, people
would point and scream and rush

me for autographs. I would be the hardest working,
most productive player in the NFL.
Then things changed. I realized that a build of
57", 160 pounds — when combined with a weak
arm — doesn't exactly have Michael Vick or Brett
Favre looking over his shoulder. I also discovered
that being the hardest working man in the business,
while rewarding in that crappy "hard work gives you
character and makes you a better person" kind of
way, is also extremely tedious. Who wants to go

through life running windsprints and doing agility
drills all day?
So for now, I've given up the whole NFL quarter
back thing, pending a massive growth spurt and the
acquisition of some physical talent. Until then, I think
I have found my new calling: fired NFL head coach.
No, I don't want to be an NFL head coach, I only
want to be fired as one. That is truly the sweetest job
in the world. To begin with, getting fired from the
NFL is a rather lucrative business these clays. Former
49ers coach Steve Mariucci, had he not had a death
wish and signed with the Detroit Lions, was eligible to
receive $2 million for being lired recently — that's $2
million for not getting the job done. I hardly ever ac
complish anything that I am supposed to do, and I
have yet to find a way squeeze a solitary dime out of it.
And it's not as if fired NFL coaches exactly have it
rough after leaving the sport. Provided that you didn't
