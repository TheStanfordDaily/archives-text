# Dreaming of unemployment line
## 
### 
When I was a kid, I
wanted nothing so
badly as to be a pro
fessional football
player. I was going to be the quar
terback that set all the records, got
all the girls, and made the millions
and millions of dollars. When I
walked down the street, people
would point and scream and rush

me for autographs. I would be the hardest working,
most productive player in the NFL.
Then things changed. I realized that a build of
57", 160 pounds — when combined with a weak
arm — doesn't exactly have Michael Vick or Brett
Favre looking over his shoulder. I also discovered
that being the hardest working man in the business,
while rewarding in that crappy "hard work gives you
character and makes you a better person" kind of
way, is also extremely tedious. Who wants to go

through life running windsprints and doing agility
drills all day?
So for now, I've given up the whole NFL quarter
back thing, pending a massive growth spurt and the
acquisition of some physical talent. Until then, I think
I have found my new calling: fired NFL head coach.
No, I don't want to be an NFL head coach, I only
want to be fired as one. That is truly the sweetest job
in the world. To begin with, getting fired from the
NFL is a rather lucrative business these clays. Former
49ers coach Steve Mariucci, had he not had a death
wish and signed with the Detroit Lions, was eligible to
receive $2 million for being lired recently — that's $2
million for not getting the job done. I hardly ever ac
complish anything that I am supposed to do, and I
have yet to find a way squeeze a solitary dime out of it.
And it's not as if fired NFL coaches exactly have it
rough after leaving the sport. Provided that you didn't


Ryan Stewart
just coach the Bengals, there is prob
ably some studio out there just
jumping at the chance of offering
your expertise on their pre-game
shows. I never have quite figured
out why the experts on these shows
are always the guys who weren't
good enough to cut it as a head
coach, but for some reason television
studios love shelling out big dollars
to get these perennial losers to tell
the winners how to win games.
The plethora of fired head coach
es in NFL-related television is prob
ably a big reason why fired head
coaches are never lambasted the way
they properly should be. I mean, a
lot of these guys werejust flat-out id
iots as coaches, but TV shows praise
diem for being such "great football
minds." Only in the NFL can you be
an enormous failure as a leader, only
to have your peers extol your virtues

around every corner. Well, only in
the NFL and as the Secretary of the
Treasury.
And for those few coaches, like
Mariucci or former Cowboys coach
Jimmy Johnson (yes, he was fired,
forget the technicalities), who were
let go despite having success with
their teams, they are elevated to
quasi-martyr status. Any subse
quent decline in the team's perfor
mance will bring about cries from
fans calling for the replacement of
the owners and the reinstatement of
the fallen hero.
What a great job to be fired from.
If you are terrible, then people will
still praise whatever pathetic virtues
you do have, while if you are great,
people will worship the ground you
walk on. And if you coached the
Bengals, please see "if you are terri
ble" above.
And, to top it all off, there is prob
ably a cool couple of million "sym
pathy" bucks in the firing process.
This contract buyout system must
have been designed by democrats

(talk about the greatest welfare sys
tem ever). We should be training all
of our poor and indigent to read the
blitz and to open up the passing
game rather than that useless crap
like literacy and not smelling bad.
Reading is only a marginally useful
skill anyway, especially as long as
there is still a market for profession
al wrestling and porn. Besides, you
read this entire column, and what
did it get you-except some mind
numbing entertainment and a
burning desire to get laid off?
From this day forward, I will de
vote myself entirely to developing a
way that I can be hired as an NFL
coach-then immediately fired. Too
bad George O'Leary already beat
me to the punch with that Notre
Dame fake-resume fiasco; that was a
stroke of genius. 1 am badly in need
of some direction in this pursuit.
Does anyone have Buddy Ryan's
telephone number?

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in eco
nomics.
