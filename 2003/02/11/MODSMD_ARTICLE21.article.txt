# Records fall at Avery
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a historic Saturday at
Avery Aquatic Center as five pool
records fell and swimmers posted
numerous NCAA championship
qualifying times. In the process of
setting three of the new records,
the No. 1 Cardinal men's swim
ming and diving team splashed
past No. 7 Southern California,
144-87, improving its record to 7-0
(3-0 in Pacific-10 action). USC's
record fell to 5-3, 2-2.
With the band playing and the
Dollies dancing, Stanford captured
wins in nine of the 11 swimming
events and swept the top three
spots in the 50, 100 and 200 yard
free and the 200 butterfly.
"The swimmers are mentally
tough and always ready to step up
and race," coach Skip Kenney said.
"They work so hard in practice,
and it really shows in competition."
The first pool record fell in the
first event, as the 400 medley relay
team of juniors Peter Marshall,
Michael Bruce and Bobby
O'Bryan and sophomore Jayme
Cramer finished in three minutes,
10.82 seconds, the second-fastest
time in the country this year.
"I have always felt that the med
ley relay is the key to a team's suc
cess," Kenney said. "To have our
medley relays swim so fast really
tells you a lot about the depth that
we have in all four strokes."
Immediately following the
relay, USC senior co-captain Erik
Vendt blew away the competition
in the 1,650 free, crushing the 19-
year-old pool record by four sec
onds and finishing almost 30 sec
onds ahead of his nearest competi

tor, junior Matt Sorlien. Vendt also
won the 200 breaststroke, out
touching Bruce 1:57.48 to 1:57.83
in a nail-biting finish.
The third pool record fell in the
200 individual medley, as sopho
more Dan Trupin finished in
1:45.69, the fastest time in the na
tion this year. The previous pool
record was set in 2002 by junior
Markus Rogan. In establishing the
new mark, Trupin also qualified
for the NCAA championship meet
in March.
"Setting the record was a great
affirmation of all of the work that
I've been doing," Trupin said.
"I've competed in the 200 IM at
each of the past three meets, which
has really allowed me to fine tune
different aspects of the race."
The Cardinal winning streak
carried to the next event, the 200
fly, as Cramer, the leader through
out the race, set the fourth pool
record of the day. His time of
1:45.58 bettered a 16-year-old
record by .12 seconds. Senior co
captain Dan Westcott and sopho
more Matt McDonald completed
the 1 -2-3 sweep for the Cardinal.
"It was a great honor to break
Anthony Mosse's pool record,"
Cramer said. "He was one of the
best swimmers in Stanford history,
and he was an Olympian in 1988. It
was great to race my teammates
Dan and Matt and to have them
push me to get that time."
USC freshman Ous Mellouli
and Rogan went head-to-head in
the 500 free, but Mellouli squeaked
by with the win. His time of 4:20.32
bettered the pool record set in
1987 by former Trojan Dan Jor
gensen. Rogan and Trupin fin
ished second and third in 4:21.07
and 4:28.31, respectively.
Stanford capped off the day
with a strong 1-2 finish in the 400
free relay. O'Bryan and Marshall
teamed with junior Scott Ransen
berg and senior co-captain John
Waters to claim the top spot in
2:57.48. The B team of Westcott,
senior Thomas Zochowski, Mc-
Donald and freshman Michael
McLean posted the second-fastest
time of 3:03.22.
In diving action, sophomore
Adam Peterson and senior Gavin
Olmstead finished 1-2 on the 1-
meter springboard. Olmstead took
top honors on the 3-meter with
303.60 points. USC sophomore
Ray Vincent placed second, and
Peterson took third.
