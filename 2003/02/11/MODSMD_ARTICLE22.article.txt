# Tennis shines without stars
## Cardinal squad depleted by injury and play in Siebel Open 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
Despite two of its top players not competing in sin
gles, the No. 7 Stanford (1-1) men's tennis team rolled
to an easy victory over Texas Christian University (4-
2) at the Taube Family Tennis Center on Saturday.
The result of the match was never in doubt as Stanford
built a 5-0 lead before coasting to a 5-2 win.
Head coach Dick Gould excused senior Ail-Ameri
can Ryan Haviland from his team duties for the day to
allow him to play in the qualifying tournament for the
Siebel Open in Sanjose. K.C. Corkery played doubles
but not singles because of nagging injuries to his shoul
der and knee.
The Cardinal dominated the play in doubles, win
ning all three matches by a two break-of-serve margin
to secure the first point of the contest.
Senior Ail-Americans David Martin and Scott Lip
sky (ranked No. 3 nationally) defeated TCU's Fabrizio
Sestini and Alex Menichini 8-4 on court number one.
On court number two, freshmen duo K.C. Corkery
and James Pade (No. 9) beat Toni Gordon and Daniel
Scholten 8-5. Sophomore Sam Warburg and junior
Carter Morris (No. 57), playing together for the first
time since October, secured a comfortable 8-4 victory
over Rafael Abreu and Jacob Martin on court three.
"Against a good opponent, it's a huge advantage to
get the doubles point," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "I'm really excited about our doubles
teams. We have a lot of guys that can play doubles well.
Carter stepped in and did a nice job."
In singles play, Stanford's top four players recorded
straight-set wins. Playing on court one, No. 15 David
Martin looked sharp in his match against Sestini (No.
104). Both players held serve to 3-3 in the first set. Mar
tin then broke Sestini's serve in the seventh game, dom
inating the rest of the match fora 6-4, 6-1 victory.
"I was getting a lot of free points off my serve," said
Martin. "When my serve is working like that, it makes
it easier on every other part of my game."
Playing on court number two, Scott Lipsky (No. 46)
took down Menichini (No. 85) 6-2,6-4.
"My serve was really working today and I was more
patient than in my last match," Lipsky said. "I was
picking the right moments to attack."
Freshman James Pade beat No. 48 Toni Gordon 6-
3, 7-6 on the third singles court. Gordon held set
points in the second set tie-breaker, but Pade with
stood the pressure and hit some great shots to win the
crucial points.
"Anytime you can get straight-set wins at the top
three singles positions, it's a good day," Whitlinger
said.
No. 52 Sam Warburg returned to the singles line
up after sitting out against Cal last weekend. He
showed no signs of his long lay-off in a solid 6-3, 6-3
win over Scolten.
"It was my first singles match in four months," War
burg said. "I was trying to be aggressive while remain
ing consistent. I think I accomplished that."
Haviland and Corkery's absence allowed Morris

and sophomore Phil Sheng the opportunity to step
into the lineup.
"It's important to get our extra guys some playing
time so that if we run into injuries down the road, they
can step in without missing a beat," Whitlinger said.
Morris and Sheng both lost, however. Morris was
edged 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 by Abreu while Sheng was outlast
ed 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 byjacopo Tezza.
TCU's lineup was unusual in that it contained three
left-handed players, whereas Martin is Stanford's only
left-hander.
"In my 17 years of coaching I can't ever remember
an opposing team having three lefties at the top of their
lineup," Whitlinger said. "Left-handed players are
more difficult because you don't see them that often."
The Cardinal returns to action this weekend with
three more matches at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter. It will face UC-Irvine (5-2,2-0) at 1:30 p.m. on Fri
day, Fresno State (3-2) at 12 p.m. on Saturday and San
Diego State (3-1) at 1:30 p.m. on Monday.

and sophomore Phil Sheng the opportunity to step
into the lineup.
"It's important to get our extra guys some playing
time so that if we run into injuries down the road, they
can step in without missing a beat," Whitlinger said.
Morris and Sheng both lost, however. Morris was
edged 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 by Abreu while Sheng was outlast
ed 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 byjacopo Tezza.
TCU's lineup was unusual in that it contained three
left-handed players, whereas Martin is Stanford's only
left-hander.
"In my 17 years of coaching I can't ever remember
an opposing team having three lefties at the top of their
lineup," Whitlinger said. "Left-handed players are
more difficult because you don't see them that often."
The Cardinal returns to action this weekend with
three more matches at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter. It will face UC-Irvine (5-2,2-0) at 1:30 p.m. on Fri
day, Fresno State (3-2) at 12 p.m. on Saturday and San
Diego State (3-1) at 1:30 p.m. on Monday.
