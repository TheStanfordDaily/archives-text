# Durante claims national spot
## 
### RICARDO ANDRADE STAFF WRITER 
Senior Dave Durante ensured
that the weekend in Las Vegas
would be a success for the Stanford
men's gymnastics squad.
By finishing third in the all
around competition at the Winter
Cup Challenge, the former Stan
ford Ail-American clinched one of
four open national team spots, be
coming Stanford's first senior na
tional team member since 1997. In
a competition featuring several
Olympic and World team mem
bers, Durante found himself
among the country's best gymnasts.
"It just came down to hitting,"
Durante said. "I was in third place
from the third event on and I knew
that if I kept hitting I had a pretty
good shot at one of the four spots."
With a solid six-for-six perfor
mance Durante also made event fi
nals on the pommel horse, rings
and parallel bars. He finished in
third place on the pommel horse,
just five-hundreths of a point away
from the national title on the event.
Durante is a fifth-year senior
who exhausted his NCAA eligibili

ty last year. He continues to train
with the Stanford club gymnastics
team while finishing his degree in
human biology. As a member of
the Senior National Team, he is el
igible to represent the United
States in international competi
tion; he hopes to use these compe
titions as a steppingstone to quali
fy for future World Championship
and Olympic teams.
Another highlight for the Cardi
nal was defending NCAA rings
champion, senior Marshall Erwin,
who entered the competition as a
ring specialist. Erwin was in second
place on the rings after the first day
of competition, but dropped to
fourth place during event finals,
with only .15 separating him from
first place.
"I was really happy about my
performance," Erwin said. "I just
wasn't happy with the score they
gave me."
Added coach Thom Glielmi:
"Marshall is definitely the strongest
guy in the country. Now it is a mat
ter of how his routine is constructed
and getting him a dismount that is
comparable to the rest of the rou
tine."

Junior Dan Gill, the varsity
team's top all-around competitor,
was unsure whether he would be
able to compete until the day of the
competition. He spent almost two
days in the hospital last week with a
wrist infection and, as a result,
missed almost a week of training.
Despite sporting a golf ball-sized
lump on his wrist, Gill competed
two events before scratching the
rest of the meet.
"It was so frustrating," Gill said.
"The goal for this competition was
to make the Senior National Team.
After the first event was a little
rough, [coach Glielmi] decided not
to risk further injur)' for the colle
giate season."
Gill will take new antibiotics this
week and says he will be ready for
competition against California this
weekend. The Stanford junior is
currendy is one of the country's top
six NCAA gymnasts on the floor,
vault, high bar and the all-around.
In another setback for the Car
dinal, senior Matt McLean was
forced to withdraw from the com
petition after a scare on his first
event. He slipped off the high bar
on his dismount and landed on his
head. Luckily, McLean walked
away with only a stiff neck but was
taken to the hospital for precau
tionary tests.
"It was a really fluke thing,"
Glielmi said. "It was too bad that he
couldn't finish the meet because I
think he was going to surprise a lot
of people. That was the biggest dis
appointment of the weekend."
Aside from the injuries, though,
the team considered this a success
ful weekend.
"I think Dave was the only guy in
the meet that went six-for-six,"
Erwin said. "That's why he was bet
ter than everyone. It was awesome.
We're really happy for him."
"I'm excited to get the opportu
nity to compete internationally for
the U.S." Durante said. "I'm going
to some training camps in the next
couple of months and can really
focus on upgrading the start values
of my routines."

withdrew after a near-serious injury when he fell off the high bar. He suffered
only a stiff neck but was taken to the hospital as a precaution.
