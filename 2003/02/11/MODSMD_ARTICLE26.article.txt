# International spotlight
## Dominica 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is the seventh in a weekly series of inter
views with international students at Stanford meant to
heighten awareness of issues of social and political impor
tance around the world.
This past weekend, the Daily sat down to dis
cuss relations between the United States
and Dominica with Kenan Zamore, a Do
minican native and a junior majoring in
human biology.
The last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized
by Europeans, the history of Dominica before its in
dependence in 1978 was marked by French and
British imperial rule. After independence, the island
elected the first female prime minister in the
Caribbean, Mary Eugenia Charles, who remained in
office for 15 years. The majority of the population is
of African descent and was originally brought over to
work as slaves on the colonial plantations. Many Do
minican natives have emigrated to other islands in
the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and the United
States due to unemployment on the island. To offset
this trend, the government has been attempting to
develop an offshore financial sector in order to di
versify the island's production base from agriculture
and tourism.
The Daily: Could you talk about your country and
describe some of its important features?
Kenan Zamore: I'm from the Commonwealth
of Dominica, not the Dominican Republic, which
some people confuse it for. Dominica is geograph
ically closer to South America, and it's an English
speaking colony in between two Francophone is
lands in the Lesser Antilles on the Windward island
chain. It's a poor country, but we are rich in other
ways. We are blessed with a rain forest and a lot of
natural beauty. We are a really communal
people — we look out for each other, and it's not
dog-eat-dog like up here. Life down there is not as
rushed. There's a more casual pace. Family values
are very important. People always take care of their
parents — whoever in the family is doing the best
financially will help take care of the parents. People
down there respect the elderly as well. There's a
genuine respect for the community. Extended
family is extremely important. People are hard

working, but it's tough down there for education. I
feel blessed for the opportunities that I've had up
here.
Environmentally, it's very green and natural. It's
the best tropical rain forest outside of the Amazon in
terms of biodiversity. There's a lot of natural reme
dies to illnesses that are still used pervasively — for
example, teas and balms. Ecotourism is what we're
trying to push right now. Dominica is different from
most Caribbean countries, which focus on the beach
es and the weather.
There's also an indigenous population down
there. These are some of the only native Caribbean
people not to be killed off by European colonization
in the Caribbean. Like up here, many of the indige
nous people still living are faced with poverty and
lack of opportunity.
Most people live in conurbations scattered across
the island. The largest one is around the capital city

of Roseau.
It's a very slow-paced life, no hustle and bustle.
One in 10,000 people down there are over 100 years
old. There's a lot less stress.
TD: What is the state of the economy in Dominica?
KZ: The thing is, there are not a lot of jobs down
there. Every year a lot of intelligent kids graduate
from high school or college. Many people finish and
there's no work for them. A lot of talent is wasted be
cause there's a lack of opportunities. It's frustrating.
There's been a lot of migration out. Almost every
one has relatives who live in the U.S. or the U.K.
These people send a lot of money down to help peo
ple out back home. I was 15 when I moved up to
Washington, D.C. I lived with relatives and worked
and went to school. Initially, it was a culture shock for
me coming up here. It's tough being away from your
family and your support network — your friends,

and everything you've ever known — especially
coming to a country as different as America. An op
portunity opened up for me and I took it. It was a bet
ter opportunity in many ways, but I still miss some as
pects of the social climate down there.
TD: How do the attitudes of people in Dominica
compare to the attitudes of people at Stanford?
KZ: You definitely learn to appreciate what you
have a lot more, not having material wealth. For
some people, living in a dorm is an inconvenience.
There are a lot of people worse off than that, and
they're twice as happy. People take a lot for granted
up here. Going to school, having money in their
pocket. It's definitely hard to get used to such mas
sive displays of wealth in this country.
I think a lot of people don't appreciate Stanford,
and it kind of kills me to hear people complain be-

cause I've seen people in such worse predicaments.
There's a lot of other places that I could see myself
at, and I'm definitely glad to be here. I think it's sad
that where you're born has so much to do with the
chances, the opportunities that you'll have in life. If
you're born in Dominica, if your family's poor,
you're not going to be able to get a good education,
and the cycle will be perpetuated. I still have a lot of
friends and family down there, and there's a joie de
vivre.
TD: Besides immigration, what are some major is
sues that are currendy affecting Dominica?
KZ: Right now, the IMF [International Monetary
Fund] is trying to get us to devalue our currency.
They've been trying to do that fora number of years
now. Through the government, the IMF imposed a
4 percent deduction from everyone's paychecks.
This has been bad for the economy because people

spend less, so less money is moving around. People
are looking to go to other places now and that weak
ens die economy even more, if people leave it. Ac
cording to the IMF, devaluation would increase
tourism spending because people would come down
and spend more. Tourists think that the Caribbean is
a beautiful place, that it's all about natural beauty.
That is true, but what is less conspicuous is that
there's an underclass there. In reality, tourism is a
seasonal industry, and it creates a lot of low-end jobs
and increases the disparity in wealth — and most ol
the tourism investment is foreign, anyway. There's
very litde money actually staying in Dominica from
tourism.
TD: What are some common experiences that
people from Dominica have when they come to the
U.S.?
KZ: It's a tough transition. Family is so important,
and you're basically ripped away from all that. Some
times people start off working at menial jobs, but the
important thing is to keep on working hard. People
come from Dominica who had relatively good jobs
back home [but] come up here and start working in
very difficult positions . My parents have definitely
sacrificed a lot.
TD: Could you talk some more about culture in
Dominica compared to culture in the U.S.?
KZ: Since there's French influence, there are still
people who speak French Creole. During the British
colonial days, they banned it from school and the
public. But there is a definite French influence on
culture and language, partly for historical reasons as
well as it being situated in between two French coun
tries. The music is a lot more vibrant as well.
My perspective on race — and race isn't really as
big of a deal in the Caribbean — [is that] it's more
about class [in Dominica]. My country is a cultural
melting pot, but it's more homogeneous racially.
People see you for your class and your family's status.
But there's a greater unity — people look past their
differences.
Up here, it doesn't even seem like people talk to
their next-door neighbors. Up here, you'll live next
door to someone and never talk to them.

by Europeans, the history of Dominica before its in
dependence in 1978 was marked by French and
British imperial rule. After independence, the island
elected the first female prime minister in the
Caribbean, Mary Eugenia Charles, who remained in
office for 15 years. The majority of the population is
of African descent and was originally brought over to
work as slaves on the colonial plantations. Many Do
minican natives have emigrated to other islands in
the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and the United
States due to unemployment on the island. To offset
this trend, the government has been attempting to
develop an offshore financial sector in order to di
versify the island's production base from agriculture
and tourism.
The Daily: Could you talk about your country and
describe some of its important features?
Kenan Zamore: I'm from the Commonwealth
of Dominica, not the Dominican Republic, which
some people confuse it for. Dominica is geograph
ically closer to South America, and it's an English
speaking colony in between two Francophone is
lands in the Lesser Antilles on the Windward island
chain. It's a poor country, but we are rich in other
ways. We are blessed with a rain forest and a lot of
natural beauty. We are a really communal
people — we look out for each other, and it's not
dog-eat-dog like up here. Life down there is not as
rushed. There's a more casual pace. Family values
are very important. People always take care of their
parents — whoever in the family is doing the best
financially will help take care of the parents. People
down there respect the elderly as well. There's a
genuine respect for the community. Extended
family is extremely important. People are hard

working, but it's tough down there for education. I
feel blessed for the opportunities that I've had up
here.
Environmentally, it's very green and natural. It's
the best tropical rain forest outside of the Amazon in
terms of biodiversity. There's a lot of natural reme
dies to illnesses that are still used pervasively — for
example, teas and balms. Ecotourism is what we're
trying to push right now. Dominica is different from
most Caribbean countries, which focus on the beach
es and the weather.
There's also an indigenous population down
there. These are some of the only native Caribbean
people not to be killed off by European colonization
in the Caribbean. Like up here, many of the indige
nous people still living are faced with poverty and
lack of opportunity.
Most people live in conurbations scattered across
the island. The largest one is around the capital city

of Roseau.
It's a very slow-paced life, no hustle and bustle.
One in 10,000 people down there are over 100 years
old. There's a lot less stress.
TD: What is the state of the economy in Dominica?
KZ: The thing is, there are not a lot of jobs down
there. Every year a lot of intelligent kids graduate
from high school or college. Many people finish and
there's no work for them. A lot of talent is wasted be
cause there's a lack of opportunities. It's frustrating.
There's been a lot of migration out. Almost every
one has relatives who live in the U.S. or the U.K.
These people send a lot of money down to help peo
ple out back home. I was 15 when I moved up to
Washington, D.C. I lived with relatives and worked
and went to school. Initially, it was a culture shock for
me coming up here. It's tough being away from your
family and your support network — your friends,

and everything you've ever known — especially
coming to a country as different as America. An op
portunity opened up for me and I took it. It was a bet
ter opportunity in many ways, but I still miss some as
pects of the social climate down there.
TD: How do the attitudes of people in Dominica
compare to the attitudes of people at Stanford?
KZ: You definitely learn to appreciate what you
have a lot more, not having material wealth. For
some people, living in a dorm is an inconvenience.
There are a lot of people worse off than that, and
they're twice as happy. People take a lot for granted
up here. Going to school, having money in their
pocket. It's definitely hard to get used to such mas
sive displays of wealth in this country.
I think a lot of people don't appreciate Stanford,
and it kind of kills me to hear people complain be-

cause I've seen people in such worse predicaments.
There's a lot of other places that I could see myself
at, and I'm definitely glad to be here. I think it's sad
that where you're born has so much to do with the
chances, the opportunities that you'll have in life. If
you're born in Dominica, if your family's poor,
you're not going to be able to get a good education,
and the cycle will be perpetuated. I still have a lot of
friends and family down there, and there's a joie de
vivre.
TD: Besides immigration, what are some major is
sues that are currendy affecting Dominica?
KZ: Right now, the IMF [International Monetary
Fund] is trying to get us to devalue our currency.
They've been trying to do that fora number of years
now. Through the government, the IMF imposed a
4 percent deduction from everyone's paychecks.
This has been bad for the economy because people

spend less, so less money is moving around. People
are looking to go to other places now and that weak
ens die economy even more, if people leave it. Ac
cording to the IMF, devaluation would increase
tourism spending because people would come down
and spend more. Tourists think that the Caribbean is
a beautiful place, that it's all about natural beauty.
That is true, but what is less conspicuous is that
there's an underclass there. In reality, tourism is a
seasonal industry, and it creates a lot of low-end jobs
and increases the disparity in wealth — and most ol
the tourism investment is foreign, anyway. There's
very litde money actually staying in Dominica from
tourism.
TD: What are some common experiences that
people from Dominica have when they come to the
U.S.?
KZ: It's a tough transition. Family is so important,
and you're basically ripped away from all that. Some
times people start off working at menial jobs, but the
important thing is to keep on working hard. People
come from Dominica who had relatively good jobs
back home [but] come up here and start working in
very difficult positions . My parents have definitely
sacrificed a lot.
TD: Could you talk some more about culture in
Dominica compared to culture in the U.S.?
KZ: Since there's French influence, there are still
people who speak French Creole. During the British
colonial days, they banned it from school and the
public. But there is a definite French influence on
culture and language, partly for historical reasons as
well as it being situated in between two French coun
tries. The music is a lot more vibrant as well.
My perspective on race — and race isn't really as
big of a deal in the Caribbean — [is that] it's more
about class [in Dominica]. My country is a cultural
melting pot, but it's more homogeneous racially.
People see you for your class and your family's status.
But there's a greater unity — people look past their
differences.
Up here, it doesn't even seem like people talk to
their next-door neighbors. Up here, you'll live next
door to someone and never talk to them.

views with international students at Stanford meant to
