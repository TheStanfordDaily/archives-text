# World social and economic forums expand horizons
## 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The last week in January saw Stanford students, fac
ulty and alumni traveling to the ideologically opposed
World Economic Forum and World Social Forum in the
equally disparate locations of Switzerland and Brazil, re
spectively.
The WEF describes itself as an independent interna
tional organization that provides a collaborative frame
work for the world's leaders to address global issues, and
is particularly focused with engaging corporate mem
bers in global citizenship.
"The WEF holds an annual meeting every January in
Davos, Switzerland, for business, political, non-govern
mental organization, civil society, academic, media and
religious leaders," said senior George Michalopoulos,
who attended the WEF. "They discuss ongoing global is
sues — for example, the theme of this year's annual
meeting was 'Building Trust,' as a step towards better
governance in all fields."
On the other hand, the WSF was formed in direct op
position to the WEF, deliberately holding its annual con
ference on the same date as the WEF. The WSF is held
in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
"The World S<x:ial Forum is a conference that was
created to counter the pro-capitalist and elitist tenden
cies of the World Economic Forum," said senior
Meghana Reddy, who attended the WSF. "The people
who started and participate in the World Social Forum
believe that corporate heads, high-level government of
ficials and other elites should not be the only ones mak
ing the decisions about the world economy but that the
people — working-class people, people of color,
women, immigrants, grassroots organizations, people
who have been traditionally marginalized by the state
and capitalism — should have a say in how the world
economy is developed since they have been the ones
most negatively impacted by capitalism."
Not many students went to the WEF, which attracts

only 2,000 — in contrast, around
200,000 attend the WSF.
However, "There were a num
ber of Stanford alumni who attend
ed the WEF — for example, [Cisco
CEO] John Chambers and Carly
Fiorina of H[ewlett] P[ackard],"
Michalopoulos said.
Notables at the WEF included
Secretary of State Colin Powell and
other political figures.
Stanford community members
who went to the conferences had
many different reasons for attending,
from prior involvement to personal
beliefs and career opportunities.
"I had actually worked for the

World Economic Forum's media
team at the European Economic
Summit in Salzburg, and they asked
me to come back to the annual
meeting," Michalopoulos said.
Senior Avinash Kaza, who at
tended the WSF, said, "The WSF is
kind of like an NGO — non-gov
ernmental organization, also
known as non-profit — summit,
and I anticipate working on global
poverty issues at an NGO in the fu
ture. The WEF is more like a busi
ness summit, with leaders from
business and government."
Even faculty had their reasons
for attending the WSF.
"I have been to many confer
ences of progressive activists over
the last few years, and this is cur
rently one of the most important
among international gatherings,"

said Todd Davies, a symbolic sys
tems lecturer.
Interestingly enough, despite the
differences between the two confer
ences, some people like President
Lula da Silva ofßraz.il attended both.
And students attending each
conference felt that they received
valuable experiences.
"There is a major disconnect be
tween the classroom and the real
world," Kaza said. "To see the ef
fects of globalization, it is necessary
to go beyond the classroom and
textbook and to actually meet and
talk with some of the people affect
ed. [Also,] many Stanford-affiliated
individuals are or will be in the posi
tion to affect the lives of the poor
across the world ... it is important
for us to see how our actions affect
the lives of others globally."
