### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The last week in January saw Stanford students, fac
ulty and alumni traveling to the ideologically opposed
World Economic Forum and World Social Forum in the
equally disparate locations of Switzerland and Brazil, re
spectively.
The WEF describes itself as an independent interna
tional organization that provides a collaborative frame
work for the world's leaders to address global issues, and
is particularly focused with engaging corporate mem
bers in global citizenship.
"The WEF holds an annual meeting every January in
Davos, Switzerland, for business, political, non-govern
mental organization, civil society, academic, media and
religious leaders," said senior George Michalopoulos,
who attended the WEF. "They discuss ongoing global is
sues — for example, the theme of this year's annual
meeting was 'Building Trust,' as a step towards better
governance in all fields."
On the other hand, the WSF was formed in direct op
position to the WEF, deliberately holding its annual con
ference on the same date as the WEF. The WSF is held
in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
"The World S<x:ial Forum is a conference that was
created to counter the pro-capitalist and elitist tenden
cies of the World Economic Forum," said senior
Meghana Reddy, who attended the WSF. "The people
who started and participate in the World Social Forum
believe that corporate heads, high-level government of
ficials and other elites should not be the only ones mak
ing the decisions about the world economy but that the
people — working-class people, people of color,
women, immigrants, grassroots organizations, people
who have been traditionally marginalized by the state
and capitalism — should have a say in how the world
economy is developed since they have been the ones
most negatively impacted by capitalism."
Not many students went to the WEF, which attracts
