investigating the relationship between the Stan
ford community and the potential war in Iraq.

The City of Palo Alto will soon join over
70 other local governments across the
United States in formally adopting a reso
lution opposed to a unilateral, pre-emp
tive military invasion of Iraq.
Voting 6-1 at a council meeting packed
with nearly 200 anti-war demonstrators
last night, the Palo Alto City Council took
the first step in registering its opposition
to war in Iraq by approving a motion that
would allow the city to formally draft a
written resolution by next week.

Palo Alto joins the cities of San Francis
co, Berkeley, Houston, Chicago and De
troit, as well as scores of other municipali
ties and counties that have spoken out
against the Bush administration's plans
for war in Iraq.
Councilmembersjim Burch and Judy
Kleinberg, who introduced the motion,
gave a list of reasons for why Palo Alto
should oppose war in Iraq.
The motion argues that neither the
country, the state of California nor the city
of Palo Alto can afford to wage war against
Iraq, and that such an action would "di
vert scarce economic resources to support
a war effort."
It also opposes an invasion due to the
"potential loss of life among the sons and
daughters of Palo Alto who are members

of the military, and oflraqi civilians."
"There is a lack of convincing evidence
that Iraq poses a credible and imminent
threat to the national security of the Unit
ed States," Kleinberg said as she intro
duced the motion last night.
The motion also speaks of a commit
ment to the principle of war as a last resort
and a need for "genuine, multilateral ac
tion sanctioned and conducted in concert
with the U.N."
According to several councilmembers,
anti-war sentiment is widespread and
popular among Palo Altans.
"As of 6:30 this evening, I have re
ceived over 130 e-mails in support of this
motion, 10 against," Kleinberg said.
It was standing room only last
night as anti-war demonstrators —
mosdy older Palo Alto residents —
filled the audience, holding up
protest signs, clapping and cheer
ing intermittently throughout the
three-hour council meeting.
About 20 members of the audi
ence stood up to voice opposition to
a war, while one lone Palo Alto res
ident cautioned that "peace equals
appeasement of Saddam Hussein."
Councilmember Victor
Ojakian cast the lone vote against
the motion.
"This motion has nothing to do
with my personal position on this
issue," he said. "I was not elected to
vote on national issues. Frankly,
there are other resolutions that I
would like to see our council work
on and pass that have more to do
with local issues."
The motion passed with six
votes out of a necessary five. Coun
cilmember Bern Beecham was ab
sent from the meeting. Mayor
Dena Mossar left abruptly before
the council was to hear the motion
and was also absent for the vote.
