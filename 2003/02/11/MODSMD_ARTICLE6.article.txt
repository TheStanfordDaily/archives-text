# Forum tackles 'good work'
## 
### MARY DAILEY PATTEE 
The lives of American citizens are in
creasingly dominated by the workplace
to the detriment of family life, a panel of
scholars concluded last night at the Au
rora Forum discussion "Doing Good
Work."
Last night's discourse, part of an in
formal series of discussions hosted by the
Department of Continuing Studies to ex
plore American ideals, featured author
and journalist Richard Rodriguez and
University of Richmond Philosophy
Prof. Joanne Ciulla. The moderator was
Stanford Humanities Center Faculty Fel
low and Philosophy Prof. Debra Satz.
The discussion on the character of the
modern American work ethic was well at
tended, but only live members of the
largely middle-aged and elderly audi
ence at Kresge Auditorium were under
graduate Stanford students.
Satz noted that Americans today work
notably more than they did in the 1950s
— and 350 more hours per year than
their European counterparts. According

to Ciulla, "So many Americans have
come to depend on jobs to be their main
source of identity, [they have become] a
substitute for the fulfillment that was
once provided by friends and family."
Alluding to Aristotelian notions of the
importance of leisure, Ciulla asserted
that "more than ever, American students
are in need of a liberal arts education be
cause it teaches them how to construc
tively use their leisure."
Ciulla's main criticism of the current
work environment is that paid employ
ment dominates American life at a time
when life should be getting easier.
"Dead is the old social compact in
which Americans were made to believe
that, if they did their job well, they
would be taken care of by their employ
ers," she said.
According to Ciulla, even companies
that offer worker benefits to their em
ployees undermine independence from
the workplace and instill fear in workers.
Ciulla noted that employees are all too

aware that if they leave the job they
lose their benefits and cited worker
insurance policies as an example.
The connection between em
ployment and fear was further
highlighted by Rodriguez, who ar
gued, "There is a silence about fail
ure in America, and it is really
deep."
He added, "I think it has some
thing to do with our own fear
about failure and the ways we
might slip."
According to Rodriguez, Amer
icans are suffering from the disso
lution of a false optimism centered
on the notion that a life of leisure
without work was possible for all
Americans.
Although both panelists criti
cized the diminution of the value

of leisure in the current American
lifestyle, neither advocated a life
devoid of work. Citing British au
thor George Orwell's work "Down
and Out in Paris and London,"
Rodriguez stated that "leisure is a
terrible prospect for those who do
not know work."
In conclusion, both panelists ac
knowledged that good work
means different things to different
people and that "good work" in its
most general sense means work
well done. Ciulla proposed that, in
the future, one must "find ways to
fit work into our leisure rather
than find ways to fit leisure into
our work."
Rodriguez summed up the
theme of the lecture and noted
that "work and leisure are not di
alectical opposites."
He added, "They are more like
concentric circles. The outer ring
is work, but leisure must necessar
ily be found within it."
