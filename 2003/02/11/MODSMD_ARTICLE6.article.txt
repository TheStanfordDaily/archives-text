# Forum tackles 'good work'

### MARY DAILEY PATTEE 
The lives of American citizens are in
creasingly dominated by the workplace
to the detriment of family life, a panel of
scholars concluded last night at the Au
rora Forum discussion "Doing Good
Work."
Last night's discourse, part of an in
formal series of discussions hosted by the
Department of Continuing Studies to ex
plore American ideals, featured author
and journalist Richard Rodriguez and
University of Richmond Philosophy
Prof. Joanne Ciulla. The moderator was
Stanford Humanities Center Faculty Fel
low and Philosophy Prof. Debra Satz.
The discussion on the character of the
modern American work ethic was well at
tended, but only live members of the
largely middle-aged and elderly audi
ence at Kresge Auditorium were under
graduate Stanford students.
Satz noted that Americans today work
notably more than they did in the 1950s
â€” and 350 more hours per year than
their European counterparts. According

to Ciulla, "So many Americans have
come to depend on jobs to be their main
source of identity, [they have become] a
substitute for the fulfillment that was
once provided by friends and family."
Alluding to Aristotelian notions of the
importance of leisure, Ciulla asserted
that "more than ever, American students
are in need of a liberal arts education be
cause it teaches them how to construc
tively use their leisure."
Ciulla's main criticism of the current
work environment is that paid employ
ment dominates American life at a time
when life should be getting easier.
"Dead is the old social compact in
which Americans were made to believe
that, if they did their job well, they
would be taken care of by their employ
ers," she said.
According to Ciulla, even companies
that offer worker benefits to their em
ployees undermine independence from
the workplace and instill fear in workers.
Ciulla noted that employees are all too
