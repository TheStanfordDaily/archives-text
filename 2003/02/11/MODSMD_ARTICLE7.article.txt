# Manzanita gets antsy OVER PEST PROBLEM
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ants are an inevitable part of life
at Stanford — and for many stu
dents at the Farm, winter quarter
and its inclement weather incites an
epic battle between man and insect
when the unwelcome pests invade
campus residences seeking shelter.
"Across the campus, I think
what we see is increasing activity for
ants," said Imogen Church, man
ager of undergraduate housing op
erations.
Church explained that tempera
ture extremes — both cold or hot
and wet or dry — tend to drive the
insects inside.
East campus, particularly Kim
ball Hall, has had severe ant prob
lems in the past — so severe that a
popular campus rumor that Man
zanita Park was built on anthills has
long been accepted as fact. Stu
dents also speak about rumors that
Kimball's contractors skimped on
construction costs without telling
the University, exacerbating the
problem. Church dispelled these
myths.
"We don't have any record of
any kind of litigation or any kind of
problems with the building of Kim
ball," Church said. "It will be one of
the last residences to come up for
renovation."
As far as anthills are concerned,
Church said, "The area where
Manzanita Park is [now] used to be
a eucalyptus grove."
Kimball was built approximately
15 years ago, through the Capital
Improvement Project. Lantana

and Castano, also residences in
Manzanita, are slightly newer and
were built about 12 years ago.
Church said the area used to be full
of temporary housing trailers.
Current Kimball residents have
had mixed experiences with the
persistent pests. Sophomore Yuka
Teraguchi said that her hall has not
had any problems this year.
"I know that the ants are still
there, because if you leave food out
side, half an hour later, it's black
with ants," Teraguchi said. "But
that doesn't happen inside the hall
anymore."
Others were unequivocal.
"I definitely think ants are a
problem here, especially in the
bathrooms" said sophomore Jenny
Zhang, " I almost always have to
share the shower with a dozen ants
or so. Also, especially on the week
ends, when no one comes in to
clean, there will be ants crawling on
the toilets, which also sometimes
means ants crawling on your butt."
Some students have become
veritable ant assassins. Sophomore
Jason Payne says that he shows no
mercy.
"I have a trash can full of about a
thousand dead ants," he said.
Ants can enter a building
through just about any opening.
Church said this includes every
thing from windows to outlets and
pipes.
The difference in the frequency
of ant infestafions could have to do
with location.
"At the beginning of the year,
