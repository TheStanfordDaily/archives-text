# Manzanita gets antsy OVER PEST PROBLEM
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ants are an inevitable part of life
at Stanford — and for many stu
dents at the Farm, winter quarter
and its inclement weather incites an
epic battle between man and insect
when the unwelcome pests invade
campus residences seeking shelter.
"Across the campus, I think
what we see is increasing activity for
ants," said Imogen Church, man
ager of undergraduate housing op
erations.
Church explained that tempera
ture extremes — both cold or hot
and wet or dry — tend to drive the
insects inside.
East campus, particularly Kim
ball Hall, has had severe ant prob
lems in the past — so severe that a
popular campus rumor that Man
zanita Park was built on anthills has
long been accepted as fact. Stu
dents also speak about rumors that
Kimball's contractors skimped on
construction costs without telling
the University, exacerbating the
problem. Church dispelled these
myths.
"We don't have any record of
any kind of litigation or any kind of
problems with the building of Kim
ball," Church said. "It will be one of
the last residences to come up for
renovation."
As far as anthills are concerned,
Church said, "The area where
Manzanita Park is [now] used to be
a eucalyptus grove."
Kimball was built approximately
15 years ago, through the Capital
Improvement Project. Lantana

and Castano, also residences in
Manzanita, are slightly newer and
were built about 12 years ago.
Church said the area used to be full
of temporary housing trailers.
Current Kimball residents have
had mixed experiences with the
persistent pests. Sophomore Yuka
Teraguchi said that her hall has not
had any problems this year.
"I know that the ants are still
there, because if you leave food out
side, half an hour later, it's black
with ants," Teraguchi said. "But
that doesn't happen inside the hall
anymore."
Others were unequivocal.
"I definitely think ants are a
problem here, especially in the
bathrooms" said sophomore Jenny
Zhang, " I almost always have to
share the shower with a dozen ants
or so. Also, especially on the week
ends, when no one comes in to
clean, there will be ants crawling on
the toilets, which also sometimes
means ants crawling on your butt."
Some students have become
veritable ant assassins. Sophomore
Jason Payne says that he shows no
mercy.
"I have a trash can full of about a
thousand dead ants," he said.
Ants can enter a building
through just about any opening.
Church said this includes every
thing from windows to outlets and
pipes.
The difference in the frequency
of ant infestafions could have to do
with location.
"At the beginning of the year,
ants were a major problem for
some people, including myself,"
said sophomore Dianna Ferrand.
"What I find strange is that my
friend, who lives on the Castano
side of Kimball [opposite Fer
rand], has open containers and
food in trash cans and has never
had ants."
Branner is currently under
renovation, and a new field was
constructed at the corner of Serra
and Campus Drive, both of
which, according to Church, re
sult in "significant ground distur
bance which is definitely some
thing that could cause more ant
activity in the area."
Residents have found that open
food containers are a sure-fire way
to attract ants, and that subsequent
invasions can be taxing.
"One time, my parents sent me a
package of food for my birthday,"
said Julian Wass. "The next day,
when I woke up, there was a 50-
foot trail of ants — beginning three
doors down the hall — leading to
my room and to my trash can. I
have never seen so many ants."

Kristina Tom also had a horror
story to share.
"I woke up to ants tickling my
hand, then found ants streaming
from three corners of my room,
to the middle, apparently attract
ed to an empty food container,"
she said. "I spent half an hour
crushing them and spraying
them. I guess it's my fault for
leaving an empty food container
out, but I do have ants around
even when I don't have food or
water out."
Residents' room-invasion stories
are not limited to the insect world,
either. Some students have report
ed run-ins with other wildlife.
"I've heard stories, at least in
Castano, where squirrels will climb
in your window," said junior Ben
Lee. "I don't know if this is one of

those urban legends, but one time a
squirrel peed on somebody's desk."
Others have had encounters
with aerial animals.
"The only other problem that's
really affected me is birds flying into
the bathroom and my room,"
Zhang said. "It's really startling, but
we just got screens put up, so I
guess the worst that could happen
is waking up to a bird-shaped dent
in our screens."
What should a resident do in
case of an ant attack? Tom suggest
ed that, "After the many ant attacks
I've had, I've found spray and wash
works really well, kills the ants and
their chemical trail."
She added, "You can control the
ants here, but you have to be metic
ulous about cleaning."
Church suggested that students
"make sure that food products are
kept stored in Tupperware or some
kind of sealed compartment, and
the same thing with drinks and liq
uids."
She added, "Keep areas
clean ... Take recycling out of the
building daily and any type of trash
where there might be food. If stu
dents are having a problem [they
can] contact their housing supervi
sor or put in a fix-it request or call
the [Housing Services] hotline."
