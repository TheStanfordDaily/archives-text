# Pre-law program bridges grad school gap
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While most students might be familiar with
melodramatic — and less-than-realistic —
Hollywood depictions of law school, few have
had the experience of seeing an actual class first
hand. To reverse this trend, the Stanford Pre-
Law Society yesterday provided pre-law under
graduates with the opportunity to attend class
es at the Stanford Law School by teaming them
up with current law students fora day.
Junior Michael Scrafford, a SPLS shadowing
program co-chair, explained that the shadow
ing program is "definitely one of the most suc
cessful events we put on."
"From what we can tell, virtually everyone
that goes to law school fora day considers it a
valuable experience," Scrafford said. "Many say
that it was very interesting or even exciting to
see how a law class is conducted, while a few de
cide that they're not as excited about law school
anymore. Everyone is always surprised by the
fact that every law student has a laptop for tak
ing notes and everyone reacts differendy to the
professors that use the Socratic method."
The Socratic method of instruction is one in
which a professor encourages participation and
calls upon students in the class to assist in an
swering questions raised by course material.
"We have 12 classes students will shadow
with about five [shadowers] per class — about

60 total," said Liz Eraker, a junior and SPLS
shadowing program co-chair. "It is one of the
most popular things [SPLS] does."
Scrafford said that the shadowing program
was first introduced during spring quarter of
last year.
"Changes that have been made primarily in
volve extending the program to more classes,
which allows more students to participate," he
said. "In the future, we would like to develop a
way to make sure more people that sign up ac
tually show up on the day of the event. About a
third of people that sign up inevitably decide
not to come, which prevents people that would
have liked to have gone from going."
"Law school professors have been very re
ceptive to helping the program grow and let
ting undergrads get a glimpse of what law
school is really like," Scrafford added.
Senior Sam Maxfield, the president of SPLS,
said that "we are really hoping to give students [an]
honest picture of law school as much as possible."
"I think one of the main goals generally is
that we want to be an information society," she
continued. "We want to show people the
process of getting into law school as well as what
that final result means — if that is the goal they
are working for, to make sure they know what
it really is."
Another component of SPLS is its under
graduate mentoring program, which Maxfield
said has about 80 participants in total, including

both mentors and those mentored.
Jacqueline Lew, a senior and SPLS mentor
ing program chair, explained that "the pro
gram is a wonderful opportunity for pre-law
students to get exposed to the law school expe
rience by networking with Stanford Law School
students in an informal environment."
"The year begins with a mentoring program
kick-off, where mentoring groups have an op
portunity to meet and get to know one another
over food," she said. "The rest of the year, the
mentoring program hosts movie nights and
study breaks to help facilitate more meetings.
We conclude with an end-of-the-year banquet."
"It was helpful and interesting," said Hanna
Chiou, a sophomore who attended the pro
gram. "I attended class not only to hear the lec
ture but also to look around the room at all die
students. The experience definitely gave me a
glimpse into what a typical law class is like."
Second-year law student Jill Ho said that she
had met with the undergraduate that she was
mentoring several times and had answered a
number of questions about law school.
"It's nice to network and meet interesting
people," she said.
Lew was optimistic about the future of the
SPLS mentoring program.
"The program has been developed entirely by
undergraduates," she said. "Student interest has
grown each successive year, most likely due to
heightened publicity efforts and word of mouth."
