The übiquity of collective
violence is one of the most
disturbing features of recent
decades.
Civil, ethnic, and religious
conflicts have erupted in many
parts of the world and
longstanding previously low
intensity conflicts have recently
developed into all out wars in
Eastern Europe, Africa,
Southeast Asia, and the Middle
East.
Americans are now facing the
possibility of going to war in
Iraq. The purpose of this three
part series is to discuss the role
of ethnographic film in
providing a window onto social
and cultural aspects of war and
post-war reconciliation in
various regions of the world.
