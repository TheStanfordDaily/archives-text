STANFORD
Early in the Civil War, slave
William Benjamin Gould fled by
boat to Union-held territory and
gained the status of "contraband of
war." Joining the U.S. Navy, he
helped win the conflict, ensuring
his permanent emancipation. As
he had learned to read and write
while still in slavery, Gould kept a
daily record of his experiences as
a newly free man. Some 140 years
later, his great-grandson, a former
chair of the National Labor
Relations Board and a Stanford
Law professor, has published his
ancestor's journal, providing
modern readers with vivid insight
into the life and thought of a man
who overcame the degradations of
slavery, actively sought his own
freedom and fought to make it
permanent, and in the end forged a
new life as a full citizen. Gould IV
provides extensive background
material through his introduction,
epilog, and copious notes to
accompany the sometimes brief
entries in the diary. An unusual
work, one of only three wartime
diaries kept by black sailors.
