## Bin Laden urges Iraqi resistance 
### 
DOHA, Qatar (AP) — A raspy voice believed
to be Osama bin Laden's urged Iraqis to carry
out suicide attacks against Americans and draw
U.S. troops into combat in Iraqi cities. U.S. offi
cials said the call broadcast yesterday proves the
world must fear Saddam Hussein's ties to the al-
Qaida terror network.
The appeal was made in a voice tape aired by
the Al-Jazeera satellite television station
throughout the Arab world and believed by
U.S. officials to be authentic. It was broadcast as
U.S. officials warned of devastating attacks
within the United States and the Persian Gulf,
where U.S. forces are massing fora possible at
tack against Iraq.
"This nexus between terrorists and states
that are developing weapons of mass destruc
tion can no longer be looked away from and ig
nored," Secretary of State Colin Powell told the
Senate Budget Committee.
Some analysts wondered at bin Laden's mo
tives for issuing a statement supporting Iraq,
given many countries' skepticism of U.S. alle
gations of Iraqi-al-Qaida links. Others worried
the recording would inflame Muslims against
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region.
On the tape, broadcast on the first day of the
Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, the speaker ad
vised Iraqis how to fight the Americans, based
on al-Qaida's experience in Afghanistan.
"We stress the importance of martyrdom op
erations against the enemy, these attacks that
have scared Americans and Israelis like never
before," the man identified as bin Laden said.
"We advise about the importance of drawing
the enemy into long, close and exhausting fight
ing, taking advantage of camouflaged positions
in plains, farms, mountains and cities," he said.
The speaker urged the Iraqis to draw Ameri
cans into urban combat, saying "the thing that
the enemy fears the most is to fight a city war."
U.S. military planners fear Saddam might

ring Baghdad with his best troops, the elite Re
publican Guard, and draw U.S. forces into
bloody street fighting where they could not use
their high-tech weapons for fear of causing
massive civilian casualties.
The speaker also told Iraqis not to worry
about American smart bombs and laser-guided
weapons because "they work on only the clear,
obvious targets." He encouraged Iraqis to use
deception techniques to neutralize American
technological superiority.
Some experts have questioned ties between
bin Laden's Islamic extremists and Saddam's
government, which nominally adheres to a
Pan-Arabic socialistic doctrine called Baathism.
In the tape, the speaker said Iraq was gov
erned by socialist infidels, including Saddam.
But he said that it was acceptable for Muslims to
fight on behalf of Iraqi "socialists" because "in
these circumstances" their interests "intersect
in fighting against the Crusaders."
U.S. counterterrorism officials in Washing
ton said the audio message was probably a real
recording of bin Laden and that a technical
analysis was planned to authenticate it. The of
ficials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,

said it was unclear when the recording was
made but said it was probably recent, given all
the attention the speaker gave to Iraq.
Yasser Thabet, a broadcast editor at Al-
Jazeera, said the station received the tape by the
same channels as previous bin Laden state
ments, but he did not give details.
Bin Laden often used Al-Jazeera to broad
cast statements during the Afghanistan war
until the elusive terrorist leader vanished after
the batde at Tora Bora in December 2001.
Al-Jazeera is not widely seen in Iraq because
few Iraqis are permitted to have satellite dishes.
However, many of them listen to foreign Arabic
language broadcasts which relayed details of
the broadcast.
There was no immediate comment from the
Iraqi government, which has repeatedly de
nied links with al-Qaida.
Bin Laden's previous statements have not
gone as far in expressing solidarity with Iraq,
officials in Washington said.
In Washington, CIA Director George J.
Tenet said intelligence information suggests al-
Qaida may launch attacks as early as this week in
the United States and on the Arabian peninsula.
