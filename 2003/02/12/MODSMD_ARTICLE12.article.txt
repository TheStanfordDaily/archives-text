# Greenspan opposes Bush's tax cut plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Feder
al Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan dealt a blow yester
day to President Bush's drive for
new tax cuts, saying he did not
believe the economy needed fur
ther stimulus and warning Con
gress to be "very careful" to keep
budget deficits from exploding.
Greenspan, who two years
ago lent critical support to
Bush's first round of $1.35 tril
lion in tax cuts, threw cold water
on the new $ 1.3 trillion package.
Bush is seeking $670 billion in
accelerated tax cuts and elimina
tion of taxes on stock dividends
as part of a stimulus program.
The rest of the package is devot
ed to making the 2001 tax cuts
permanent. They are now due
to expire after 2010.
Delivering the Fed's twice-a
year report on the state of the
economy, Greenspan said that
while war worries were weigh
ing on business investment, the
economy was poised fora signif
icant rebound once that uncer
tainty passes.
"I am one of the few people
who is still not as yet convinced
that stimulus is a desirable poli
cy," Greenspan told the panel.
He told the Senate Banking
Committee that Congress need
ed to "be very careful not to
allow deficits to get out of hand,
especially when we are going to
be running into a significant
problem starting 2010, 2012
and beyond" with demands re
tired baby boomers will be mak
ing on the Social Security and
Medicare programs.
Democrats, who have at
tacked Bush's tax-cut proposals
as too expensive and too tilted
toward the wealthy, quickly
praised Greenspan's comments.
Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., called
Greenspan's remarks "a kiss of
death" for the Bush package.
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., the
committee's top Democrat, said
Greenspan had been "clear and
unambiguous about the impor
tance of curbing deficits."
The White House sought to
limit the damage from
Greenspan's comments, noting
that he did restate his long-held
view that the current policy of
taxing dividend income twice —
once at the corporate level and
again when investors receive the
dividend payments — should be
eliminated.
However, Greenspan said
that given the worsening deficit
picture, the Bush proposal to
eliminate taxes on dividends
paid to investors, which would
cost $385 billion over 10 years,
should be paid for, either by
raising other taxes or cutting
government spending.

Greenspan urged Congress
to restore pay-as-you go rules
for budget legislation. The rules
require any increases in spend
ing on entitlement programs
such as Social Security or cuts in
taxes to be off set by spending re
ductions or tax increases else
where so the proposals do not
worsen the deficit. Greenspan
also urged Congress to put back
in place expired budget rules
that limit increases in discre
tionary spending.
Bush's tax-cuts package does
not contain any offsets to keep
the deficit from rising. Some ad
ministration officials have ar
gued that budget deficit con
cerns have been overstated.
But Greenspan said a rising
deficit can affect the economy.
"Contrary to what some have
said, it does affect long-term in
terest rates, it does have a nega
tive impact on the economy," he
said.
Republicans, who happily
pointed to Greenspan's en
dorsement of the first tax cut,
were displeased with his new re
marks. Sen. Jim Bunning, R-
Ky., complained to Greenspan,
"You are once again interjecting
yourself into matters in which
you have no business."
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer insisted the adminis
tration was pushing forward
with an aggressive sales effort
for the new tax cuts. Treasury
Secretary John Snow traveled to
Wall Street yesterday to pro
mote the administration's eco
nomic package and Bush and
Vice President Dick Cheney
scheduled a White House meet
ing with key Republican sena
tors to promote the plan.
Snow said, "We've only
begun to sell the package." He
predicted that once the dividend
proposal is more clearly under
stood it will pick up support.
"The president's proposals
are going to be very well re
ceived once they are better un
derstood," Snow told a small
group of reporters at the Trea
sury Department late yesterday.
Greenspan's comments yes
terday were in sharp contrast to
the support he provided two
years ago when he came out in
favor of Bush's first large tax cut
at a time when the government
was projecting surpluses of $5.6
trillion over the next decade, not
the record deficits now forecast.
The Fed's economic forecast
projected growth this year of 3.5
percent, up from 2.8 percent last
year, when measured from the
fourth quarter. It said inflation
would stay low and the unem
ployment rate, currently at 5.7
percent, will be around that level
at the end of the year.

while war worries were weigh
ing on business investment, the
economy was poised fora signif
icant rebound once that uncer
tainty passes.
"I am one of the few people
who is still not as yet convinced
that stimulus is a desirable poli
cy," Greenspan told the panel.
He told the Senate Banking
Committee that Congress need
ed to "be very careful not to
allow deficits to get out of hand,
especially when we are going to
be running into a significant
problem starting 2010, 2012
and beyond" with demands re
tired baby boomers will be mak
ing on the Social Security and
Medicare programs.
Democrats, who have at
tacked Bush's tax-cut proposals
as too expensive and too tilted
toward the wealthy, quickly
praised Greenspan's comments.
Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., called
Greenspan's remarks "a kiss of
death" for the Bush package.
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., the
committee's top Democrat, said
Greenspan had been "clear and
unambiguous about the impor
tance of curbing deficits."
The White House sought to
limit the damage from
Greenspan's comments, noting
that he did restate his long-held
view that the current policy of
taxing dividend income twice —
once at the corporate level and
again when investors receive the
dividend payments — should be
eliminated.
However, Greenspan said
that given the worsening deficit
picture, the Bush proposal to
eliminate taxes on dividends
paid to investors, which would
cost $385 billion over 10 years,
should be paid for, either by
raising other taxes or cutting
government spending.

Greenspan urged Congress
to restore pay-as-you go rules
for budget legislation. The rules
require any increases in spend
ing on entitlement programs
such as Social Security or cuts in
taxes to be off set by spending re
ductions or tax increases else
where so the proposals do not
worsen the deficit. Greenspan
also urged Congress to put back
in place expired budget rules
that limit increases in discre
tionary spending.
Bush's tax-cuts package does
not contain any offsets to keep
the deficit from rising. Some ad
ministration officials have ar
gued that budget deficit con
cerns have been overstated.
But Greenspan said a rising
deficit can affect the economy.
"Contrary to what some have
said, it does affect long-term in
terest rates, it does have a nega
tive impact on the economy," he
said.
Republicans, who happily
pointed to Greenspan's en
dorsement of the first tax cut,
were displeased with his new re
marks. Sen. Jim Bunning, R-
Ky., complained to Greenspan,
"You are once again interjecting
yourself into matters in which
you have no business."
White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer insisted the adminis
tration was pushing forward
with an aggressive sales effort
for the new tax cuts. Treasury
Secretary John Snow traveled to
Wall Street yesterday to pro
mote the administration's eco
nomic package and Bush and
Vice President Dick Cheney
scheduled a White House meet
ing with key Republican sena
tors to promote the plan.
Snow said, "We've only
begun to sell the package." He
predicted that once the dividend
proposal is more clearly under
stood it will pick up support.
"The president's proposals
are going to be very well re
ceived once they are better un
derstood," Snow told a small
group of reporters at the Trea
sury Department late yesterday.
Greenspan's comments yes
terday were in sharp contrast to
the support he provided two
years ago when he came out in
favor of Bush's first large tax cut
at a time when the government
was projecting surpluses of $5.6
trillion over the next decade, not
the record deficits now forecast.
The Fed's economic forecast
projected growth this year of 3.5
percent, up from 2.8 percent last
year, when measured from the
fourth quarter. It said inflation
would stay low and the unem
ployment rate, currently at 5.7
percent, will be around that level
at the end of the year.
