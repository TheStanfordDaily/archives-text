## The
						Stanford Daily Uniting against SUVs 
### 
Editorial

Americans are enamored with
cars — they reflect the
quintessential freedom of
America's wide open landscape,
symbolize status or class and reflect polit
ical leanings. Automobiles have certainly
been an important part of American his
tory. But there is one car that many peo
ple — including several Stanford student
groups — are currently rallying against:
the sports utility vehicle.
Exemplified by protesters in a recent
peace rally in San Francisco who held up
signs that said "Draft SUV drivers first,"
there is a growing national stance against
these gas-guzzling vehicles. Stanford stu
dents have recendy joined the ranks of the
movement through the student-led
"SUV SOS" campaign, which will work
with other student groups to educate fac
ulty, students and Stanford community
members on the global climate change
and foreign policy issues associated with
using an SUV. This Friday, students will
join community members in a rally
against SUVs and will head to a Hummer
dealership to protest the sales of these
massive vehicles.
What is striking to many people about
the current opposition to SUVs is that the
greater public backlash has come so late.
For many years, environmentalists fought
against SUVs. Groups like Changing the
Climate and Earth on Empty endeavored
to convince the public that SUVs had
deleterious environmental consequences.
Although not much more expensive,
and often equal to, the price of many lux
ury mid-sized cars, the current private
price of SUVs does not take into account
the significant social costs of the vehicle.
The typical SUV averages a mere 20
miles a gallon, while passenger cars may
average over 25 miles a gallon. Newer hy
brid cars such as tiie Toyota Prius and
Honda Insight have an impressive fuel ef
ficiency of up to 70 miles per gallon. SUVs
simply pale in comparison. The worst of
the lot, however, is the infamous Hum
mer. This large vehicle, which environ
mental groups have deemed "a civilian
tank," only reaches about 11 miles a gal
lon. Higher emissions released by less effi
cient cars inevitably end up in the earth's
atmosphere, contributing to environmen
tal problems such as changing global cli
mates, acid rain, higher levels of smog and
water pollution.
SUVs, while ostensibly providing a
safety cushion for the fortunate driver in
side, are dangerous to the drivers of other
vehicles in the event of a car crash. Ac

cording to recent statistics published by
PBS, a Ford Explorer is 16 times as likely
as the average family car to kill the occu
pants of another car in a collision.
Many well-meaning parents who
would like to assure their teens' safety on
the road will support the purchase of a
SUV. Unfortunately, even this peace of
mind is not guaranteed. A 1999 study by
the National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration found that SUVs
are three times as likely to roll over if in
vovled in a collision.
Furthermore, higher demands for
gasoline resulting from the booming pop
ularity of SUVs have intensified America's
dependence on foreign oil. Given the cur
rent political situation in the Middle East,
many believe that reducing this depen
dence on gasoline by using more fuel-effi
cient cars would alleviate a need for oil
from conflict-ridden regions.
Currently, one out of every four new
cars sold in the United States is an SUV,
making it the most popular type of car
sold in America. It's clear that people
would rather not part with their trea
sured SUVs: The luxury status, comfort
able seating space and off-road allure
are only some of the reasons that con
sumers continue to purchase SUVs. The
continued popularity of these vehicles is
a clear reason why education about the
negative impacts of SUVs is essential.
Many Stanford students, faculty and
community members are usually re
sponsible with their environmental
choices, yet there is a need to make the
information about SUVs more promi
nent. A quick glance around campus re
veals that there are a substantial number
of SUVs on campus, including a few
Hummers.
We support the acdons of the "SUV
SOS" campaign; rather than mounting a
personal attack on current SUV drivers,
the student groups seeks to educate the
public about these vehicles and urges po
tential customers to make the best choice.
We believe that education — not vilifica
tion —is the best tactic. Most current
SUV owners will not suddenly sell their
vehicle and trade it in fora hybrid car, but
hopefully these students can help influ
ence future car sale choices.
We are confident that students, faculty
and community members will evaluate
the costs and benefits to the environment
and society when considering their next
car purchase and will make the right
choice. SUVs are a cosdy luxury the world
can no longer afford.
