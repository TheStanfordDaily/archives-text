# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Psycho pre-madness 
### 
I live the high-life of a psycho
pre-med.l've already stud
ied 15 hours for the organic
chemistry final, but the guy
down the hall put in 20. Damn —
I better add an extra 10 just to be
safe. When grades are posted on
the Internet, I skim through the
list to determine my relative
standing in the class. If I've gotten
one too many "B"s for the quarter,
I turn to that GPA godsend, the
Online Course Guide, to unearth
grade-friendly GERs.
By nature I'm hardworking
and competitive — though the
former drives the latter, some
times I fear it's the other way
around.
I'm attentive to detail —
though others prefer the term
"anal." I have no choice: it could
be the difference between UCLA
and Creighton Medical College
(never heard of Creighton, have
you?). You can say you're pre-law
or pre-business without any at
tached stigma. But if these pre
professionals were all placed in a
set of fixed classes like pre-meds
are, they'd be just as cutthroat.
A typical pre-med conversa
tion: What are you majoring in?
Hum Bio, I say, prepared for the
next question. (His eyes squint
and nose crinkles)
Pre-med? Yeah, I mutter.
His bitter response: I used to be
one of those.
Half of each entering class is
one of those. For many freshmen,
medicine is a default profession —
it gets parents out of their hair and
garners their friends' respect. In
the ensuing years, some find their
true calling in other fields. Others
fall victim to the grind: biology,
chemistry, physics, then biochem
istry and biophysics. To the un
trained eye, Stanford ultimately

culls a group of cookie-cutter med
ical candidates, all armed with re
search experience, hospital intern
ships and inflated MCAT scores.
The competition to obtain
medical school admission has
grown so fierce that an industry
erupted to quell the pre-med's
fear of rejection. Kaplan and
Princeton Review milk this fear,

charging thou
sands of dollars
for their cram
courses. Former
admissions offi
cers exploit their
positions and
write books on
how to polish ap
plications. Stu-

dents more than willingly shell
out the bucks.
For perspective, the pre-med
experience at Stanford is not as bad
as at some other schools, or so I
hear. At Berkeley, they institute a
bell-curve-set at 10 percent "A"sin
organic chemistry classes. At Johns
Hopkins University, the legend is
that students check out and renew
books from the library just so their
peers won't have access to them.
Nevertheless, at Stanford we're still
a pack of vultures during office
hours, hovering over our defense
less TAs in search of answers.
Pre-meds aren't necessarily
under perpetual stress though.
Sometimes we come out of our
caves. But because these opportu
nities are rare, the average pre
med lives a life of extremes —
hence the binge drinking and
streaks of money burning.
Hard-core studying, hard-core
partying. There's little time for
moderation.
Whether we're headed to med
ical school or not, in high school
we were all psycho pre-meds in

spirit. Grade-conscious and deter
mined, we gritted our teeth and
took up leadership positions we'd
rather not have filled, found our
selves holed up in an extra AP
class — all for that coveted Stan
ford admissions letter. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
Robin Mamlet says professors
"want kids for whom success has
been a byproduct, not a goal."
If success hadn't been pushing
me all these years, I, for one,
wouldn't be here.
And yet the road towards prac
ticing medicine doesn't end at med
ical school graduation. There are
four years of residency, and then at
least two years (usually more) of fel
lowship. After all that, will the pre
med finally see the light? Sure, but
by then he'll be a haggard 30-year
old, having spent the bulk of his 20s
pulling 36-hour shifts in die emer
gency room.
In the back of each pre
med's mind lurks the notion
that as a doctor, he'll actively"
make a difference in people's
lives. There aren't any grand
delusions of changing the
world. Instead, it's the little
things: a patient's grateful hug,
a baby's glowing smile. Added
up over the long run, and they
apparently make the years of
sacrifice worth it.
We pre-meds are in it for the
long haul. Even though we're un
bearably meticulous right now,
it's a good thing: We'll be atten
tive doctors down the road. So
help us out — with a cup of cof
fee, a pat on the back. We'll kind
ly remember it in the distant fu
ture, when we find you on our op
erating tables.
