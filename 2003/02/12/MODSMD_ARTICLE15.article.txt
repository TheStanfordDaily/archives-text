New think tank would be fair solution
I have found the recent uprising by
students against the Hoover Institution's
hiring practices to be understandable, yet
the solution to be regretable.
It would be very challenging — if not
impossible — to have a political think
tank with no political bias at all. While I
believe that claims that the Hoover Insti
tution is conservatively biased are indeed
true, diluting the consituency of the right
wing is not the answer. To get the modern

big names and the big political thinkers,
you have to lean in some direction.

I think a much more realistic and ami
cable scenario would be for Stanford to cre
ate another think tank institution of the
same size and with liberal tendencies. This
way, hiring practices would be equal and
an academic exemption would allow for
hiring of scholars on both sides of the aisle.
In light of the recent multitude of e
mails concerning the "Hoover Petition,"
I think it is important to think of other
ways to compromise with the University.
There has to be a way to solve this with
out diluting the institution's unique —
albeit right wing — persuasive ability

with government policies. , ED RO se

West campus car in an east
parking lot: What is the harm?
I can't be alone in wondering why Stan
ford doesn't universalize the student park
ing permits into one big R category instead
of facilitating an east campus vs. west cam
pus rivalry. A and C permits make sense in
that they are standard across campus for
employees, off-campus residents and
whomever else might need to park on
campus during normal business hours.

Yet why does Stanford feel the need to dis
tinguish between EA, WE, SO or ES?
I live in Potter, located far out of the
way in Governor's Corner. Parking there
is a great inconvenience, but I'm not about
to go to Wilbur just because there are spots
open. Sometimes, though, I do need to
park on that side of campus. A few weeks
ago an officer wouldn't let me park in the
Stern parking lot to drop off a package at
Sweet Hall simply because I had a west
permit. I think that students will naturally
park as close to their respective dorms or
residences as physically possible.
Unfortunately, the way it stands
now, visiting anyone outside one's own

permit region (for 10 minutes or 10
hours) must be weighed against the
likelihood of a golden-rod yellow enve
lope that might possibly be slapped on
the windshield, a fact which must im
pact many cross-campus social interac
tions. Should dating be subject to re
gional restrictions as well? What about
meeting a friend for coffee when it's
simply too far to walk and you don't
have a bike? Even an ill-timed booty call
could run you $35. What is so danger
ous about a west campus car in an east
campus parking lot?
