# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Different interests have led to the corruption of a university 
### JOHN F. MANLEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
I took early retirement from Stanford
and left for many reasons, one of
which was that I thought Stanford
had been so corrupted by money
and power that I no longer wanted to be
here. When someone lobs a word like "cor
ruption" at a university considered one of
the best in the world, there had better be
strong, compelling evidence.
All universities face a difficult dilemma.
In order to become great, they need
money. This requires them to court people
and institutions with money and power.
Universities are loathe to offend their keep
ers. Conflict arises, however, because uni
versities are simultaneously supposed to be
special institutions. They are supposed to
uphold and teach the highest ideals. As
James B. Conant, the late President of Har
vard, once stated "He who enters a univer
sity walks on hallowed ground."
I am speaking of corruption, of course.
Not in the sense of venal individuals on the
take, but in the larger, institutional sense: a
perversion of mission.
How does Stanford measure up?
First, Stanford is the only university in
the country with its own migrant farm.
The Webb Ranch scandal was first re
vealed in 1989 after farm workers ap
proached the United Stanford Workers

Union about joining. The New York
Times and other media ran stories on the
shocking conditions at the Ranch. Stan
ford, it was revealed, had been renting
over 200 acres of prime land to the Webb
family for decades. Some Mexican fami
lies lived at the Ranch year round, but sea
sonal workers also came from Mexico to
harvest the goods sold at the fruit stand
near the junction of Interstate 280 and
Alpine Road. Other products were
brought in from other migrant farms.
Donald Kennedy, the University pres
ident at the time, announced that since
the workers at Webb Ranch were not
Stanford employees, Stanford had no
more responsibility for them than for
Macy's employees also employed on Stan
ford land.
His successor, President Gerhard
Casper, declared that Stanford could not
run Webb Ranch, stating in a Stanford
Daily article in 1993 that every "minute I
spend on these matters is a minute I do
not spend on Stanford University busi
ness" (Oct. 15).
President John Hennessy, following a
petition to Casper signed by 598 members
of the Stanford community, reaffirmed
the Kennedy-Casper policy, citing Stan
ford's obligation to use its lands for the
betterment of the University. The fact
that workers at Webb Ranch live and
work in poverty without health insurance

and other benefits came in second to the
administration's larger responsibilities.
Second, Stanford is also distinguished
by the presence of the Hoover Institu
tion, a nationally known conservative
think tank. The institution was founded
by President Herbert Hoover as a library
and archive, but beginning in 1959 with
the appointment of W. Glenn Campbell
as director, the institution raised millions
of dollars to support a politically active,
conservative think tank. The institution's
mission, as defined by Hoover, was,
among other things, "to demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx"
(Campus Report, March 7, 1990). Stu
dents and other members of the Stan
ford community have protested the
presence of a conservative think tank on
campus every decade since the 19605. A
liberal think tank would, of course, be
equally objectionable; the backers of the
institution just happen to be dominant
ly conservative.
Hoover's national prominence grew
dramatically during the presidency of
Ronald Reagan. After Hoover denied the
Political Science Department's request for
help in retaining a professor who had an
other offer, on the grounds that the de
partment had not shown Hoover suffi
cient "reciprocity," Hoover's Annual Re
ports were studied. These reports were
filled with boasts from Hoover's leaders

about the institution's central role in devel
oping the Reagan program, including
praise from Reagan for Hoover's help in his
campaign and administration. A petition
calling for an investigation of die relation
ship between Hoover's think tank and the
University led to an unprecedented vote by
the Faculty Senate calling on the Board of
Trustees fora study.
What was the administration's re
sponse? President Kennedy appointed a
committee, but instead of urging a divorce
between the two institutions he called for
closer relationships, a policy continued to
this day by Presidents Casper and Hen
nessy. Had Kennedy and the Stanford
Board of Trustees had their way, the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and
the Reagan Center for Public Policy — a
sort of super-Hoover — would today be
overlooking Lake further ce
menting Stanford's ties to policies associat
ed with President Reagan.
Years ago, when students and faculty all
over the country petitioned their universi
ties to put moral pressure on South Africa's
policy of apartheid by divesting from cor
porations doing business there, Stanford
had an opportunity to take a leadership po
sition. Instead, it set up a case-by-case re
view which ensured, at best, painfully slow
progress.
Other examples of questionable prac
tices could be mentioned. Money from the

Coe Endowment Fund, which supported
three endowed professorships, was intend
ed "to establish and maintain a Program of
American Studies designed as a positive
and affirmative method of meeting the
threat of Communism, Socialism, Collec
tivism, Totalitarianism and other Ideolo
gies opposed to the preservation of our
System of Free Enterprise" (Campus Re
port, March 7, 1990).
When Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell cited this requirement in defend
ing Herbert Hoover's statement regarding
Hoover's mission, he had a point.
Now, with the presidency of George
W. Bush, the institution is back in the
news. Stanford students are again raising
questions about its presence on campus
and its influence on national public poli
cy. Some donors to Hoover and to the
University may find these questions un
comfortable, but as long as Hoover is
known as a think tank with a bent, the
propriety of having such an institution
connected with a university will be ques
tioned. Lamentably, unless the adminis
tration frees itself from past practices
Hoover will continue here, Webb Ranch
will continue here, donations with strings
will continue here and so will the corrup
tion of an ostensibly great university.
