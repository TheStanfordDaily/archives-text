## Card hopes for big splash on Big Island 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's late September and the sun is sinking
quickly. Standing with his team scattered
around him, Stanford men's golf coach Jeff
Mitchell lays out the afternoon's agenda. He
gives a short speech, and then the team splits up
into pairs and goes about its business.
The challenge that lies before him is appar
ent in the mere structure of practice. At first,
the team gathers as a whole, sharing a sense of
unity and common purpose. Then, it's time to
split up and go separate ways, each player
working on individual trouble spots in his
game.

Mitchell acknowledges the fundamental
paradox of college golf: "Unfortunately, as a
team sport, golf is not everything that it should
be."
Although the team, which opens up its
spring season today, competes as a group, it
plays as separate individuals. However, if there
were anyone capable of mastering this para
dox, it would seem to be Mitchell.
In just his third year at the helm of the Stan
ford golf team, Mitchell is no stranger to the col
lege game. Playing for three years at Texas

Tech, he not only gained All Southwest Con
ference honors, but also a deep loyalty to his
alma mater.
After graduating in 1989, he returned as the
head coach of the Red Raiders' women's golf
team, a post that he maintained for 10 years.
Named Southwest Conference Coach of the
Year in 1994 and 1996, he became director of
both the men's and women's programs in 1998.
Mitchell finally received the ultimate honor
for his dedicated service in 2000, as he was in
ducted into the Texas Tech Sports Hall of
Fame.
This morning, Mitchell and the Cardinal
enter the 13th annual Taylor Made/Waikaloa
Intercollegiate, a three-day event that will take
place at the par-72,6,594-yard Waikaloa Kings'
Course in Kona, Hawaii. The team will try to
shake off the memory of last year's final-round
meltdown that saw the Cardinal drop from sec
ond place to a tie for 11th place overall.
As the Stanford men emerge from the win
ter offseason, they will encounter stiff competi
tion from a 26-team field packed with talent
from across the country. Texas Christian Uni
versity is the class of the group, entering play as
the No. 3 team in the country, according to the
Golfweek/Sagarin rankings. The Horned
Frogs highlighted a stellar fall season with a
pair of tournament victories, including one at
the Prestige at PGA West, where the Cardinal
finished 11th.
Besides TCU, No. 12 UCLA and No. 18
Pepperdine arrive at the Big Island with solid
fall records. Finally, No. 20 Arkansas and the
University of Nevada-Reno will look to build on
their third-place finishes at last year's event.
The Cardinal will counter with a strong line
up that blends youth and experience. Senior
Jim Seki was the unquestioned leader during
the first part of the year, and his inspired play
led to four top-10 finishes in four events, high
lighted by a second-place showing at the Win
don Memorial in October.
Although Seki struggled at last year's Taylor
Made, he brings a No. 11 ranking into this
year's tournament and should be the favorite to
capture his first individual title of the year.
Fellow senior Ron Won has been almost as
consistent. Won's four top-15 finishes in five
events solidified his place as the Cardinal's No.
2 man, and provided Seki with some much
needed support during the fall season. Won
will make his first trip to Hawaii and hopes to
build on his early success.
Senior George Downing rounds out the trio
of veterans making its way to the Aloha State.

plays as separate individuals. However, if there
were anyone capable of mastering this para
dox, it would seem to be Mitchell.
In just his third year at the helm of the Stan
ford golf team, Mitchell is no stranger to the col
lege game. Playing for three years at Texas

Tech, he not only gained All Southwest Con
ference honors, but also a deep loyalty to his
alma mater.
After graduating in 1989, he returned as the
head coach of the Red Raiders' women's golf
team, a post that he maintained for 10 years.
Named Southwest Conference Coach of the
Year in 1994 and 1996, he became director of
both the men's and women's programs in 1998.
Mitchell finally received the ultimate honor
for his dedicated service in 2000, as he was in
ducted into the Texas Tech Sports Hall of
Fame.
This morning, Mitchell and the Cardinal
enter the 13th annual Taylor Made/Waikaloa
Intercollegiate, a three-day event that will take
place at the par-72,6,594-yard Waikaloa Kings'
Course in Kona, Hawaii. The team will try to
shake off the memory of last year's final-round
meltdown that saw the Cardinal drop from sec
ond place to a tie for 11th place overall.
As the Stanford men emerge from the win
ter offseason, they will encounter stiff competi
tion from a 26-team field packed with talent
from across the country. Texas Christian Uni
versity is the class of the group, entering play as
the No. 3 team in the country, according to the
Golfweek/Sagarin rankings. The Horned
Frogs highlighted a stellar fall season with a
pair of tournament victories, including one at
the Prestige at PGA West, where the Cardinal
finished 11th.
Besides TCU, No. 12 UCLA and No. 18
Pepperdine arrive at the Big Island with solid
fall records. Finally, No. 20 Arkansas and the
University of Nevada-Reno will look to build on
their third-place finishes at last year's event.
The Cardinal will counter with a strong line
up that blends youth and experience. Senior
Jim Seki was the unquestioned leader during
the first part of the year, and his inspired play
led to four top-10 finishes in four events, high
lighted by a second-place showing at the Win
don Memorial in October.
Although Seki struggled at last year's Taylor
Made, he brings a No. 11 ranking into this
year's tournament and should be the favorite to
capture his first individual title of the year.
Fellow senior Ron Won has been almost as
consistent. Won's four top-15 finishes in five
events solidified his place as the Cardinal's No.
2 man, and provided Seki with some much
needed support during the fall season. Won
will make his first trip to Hawaii and hopes to
build on his early success.
Senior George Downing rounds out the trio
of veterans making its way to the Aloha State.

son Invitational, shooting a three-round

These old-timers will lead a
pair of sophomores, Kevin Blue

participated in last year's tour

fondness, having shot a career

The team will look to
bounce back after a disap

third-place finish at the Win

Cardinal struggled down the
