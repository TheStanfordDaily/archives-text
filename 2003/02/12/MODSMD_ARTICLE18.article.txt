# Minus stars, synchro shines together

Typically, when an athletic team
loses its two superstars at the begin
ning of the year, the team's hopes for
a successful season are dashed before
they can even take shape.
Synchronized Swimming
at Alabama Birmingham and Arizona in
Birmingham, Saturday.
Not so for Stanford's synchronized
swimming squad.
Just as the men's basketball team
successfully shook off the early depar
ture of stars Casey Jacobsen and Cur
tis Borchardt for the NBA, Stanford's
synchro team overcame the loss of its
two best swimmers to the U.S.
Olympic squad with a decisive defeat
over Alabama last Saturday.
Stanford's win at home over the
Crimson Tide, who finished third in
the nation last year, was achieved de

spite the loss of juniors Katie Norris
and Erin Dobratz, who qualified for
the U.S. Olympic squad last January.
Training with the Olympic squad
makes both swimmers ineligible for
collegiate competition.
Stanford synchro coach Shannon
Montague was not surprised by her
team's solid performance in the ab
sence of her two stars.
"Katie and Erin gave Stanford an
enormous edge in the individual rou

wish they could be a part of this colle

playing field with other top programs,
such as Ohio State and Alabama."
On an even playing field they were
indeed last Saturday, winning by an
overall team score of 90-75.
In the trio competition, freshman
Ashley McHugh, senior Stephanie
Joukoff, and junior Jennifer Kibler
swam to the haunting sounds of tribal
music on their way to first place.

Kibler and Joukoff also teamed up
to win the duet competition, notching
a score of 87.833 to music from the
movie, "The Thomas Crown Affair."
McHugh also pulled off a solo event
win in her collegiate debut, scoring an
89.3 to Spanish-themed music.
Stanford followed its big win with a
victory over Washington on Sunday.
Although Washington is not the na
tional powerhouse that Alabama is,
the win still inspired confidence in the
Cardinal.
"This weekend was a good start to
the season for us," senior Ashley En
sign said. "We performed well, but
there is definitely room for improve
ment between now and Collegiate
Nationals."
Stanford is left with slight room for
improvement for this season, howev
er, after a strong showing at Colle
giate Nationals last year. As a team,
