# No tears for Old-Balls' curtain call

The NBA All-Star Game
is always full of com -
pelling storylines and
last weekend's was no
different. But if you watched the
game on television, you would
think the only thing going on was
Michael Jordan's farewell — and
the $64,000 question of how
Mariah Carey got into that Wiz
ards jersey with her, how should
I say . . . surgically-enhanced
frame. So put on helmets be
cause I'm here to drop some
knowledge on some other as-

pects of the
game, although
Mariah's cleav
age is definitely
a worthy topic.
First, Tracy
McGr a d y
showed again
why he is cur
rendy sitting on

the throne as the single best
player in the Association. Shaq
may pick up his game come
playoff time and Steve Kerr
does have a wicked jumpshot,
but in my humble opinion, the
Orlando swingman has separat
ed himself from the pack when
it comes to his spectacular all
around game. With eyes so lazy
that the cast from "Half Baked"
is jealous, T-Mac may surprise
some people with his tenacity on
both ends of the court, but he
shouldn't. He scored at least 30
points in eight straight games
leading up to the all-star break,
and he flat out dominated the
second half on Sunday, showing
every objective spectator that
he, and not Old-Balls Jordan
(more on that later), should
have been the East player isolat
ed at the end of regulation.
It's almost funny thinking
back to how McGrady left
Toronto to get out of the shad
ow of the then heir apparent
Vince Carter. It's true that Vin
sanity was all the rage a couple
years ago, but, since then,

Carter has disappeared faster
than the Spice Girls. To make
matters worse, the Raptors play
better when he's not on the
floor, which happens to be every
other night because of his con
stant questionable ailments. The
way Vince has been going, it's
really only a matter of time be
fore he goes on the IL with
"cramps" — and I don't mean
in his calves or quads. How the
Eastern Conference voters
chose Carter over Jason Kidd —
clearly the best point guard in
basketball — baffles me, but
then again, Jesse Ventura was
voted into office not too long
ago, so electoral follies should be
put into a certain perspective.
While Sunday was Jordan's
last All-Star Game, it also
marked Yao Ming's first. And by
all accounts, it looks like the first
of many. The novelty factor
might wearing off — no longer
is he just an oversized Chinese
guy — and that's a good thing.
He can ball with the best of them
and he's only going to get better.
Soon, the NBA is going to have
to put on some kind of United
States vs. the World game dur
ing all-star weekend, and by no
means would I count out a line
up featuring Yao, Nowitzki,
Nash and Peja — although
Nowitzki would have to end his
apparent transformation into a
b-level porn star.
On Sunday, the game's MVP,
Kevin Garnett, showed just how
good he really is to a national au
dience, dropping 35 points on a
dazzling array of jumpers, dri
ves and dunks. It really is a
shame that he plays in the West
ern Conference — where you
absolutely need two bona fide
stars to be successful — because
he would just dominate the East.
Fora while, Timberwolves
swingman Wally Szczerbiak
looked he could become the
