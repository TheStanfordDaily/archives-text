## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former and possible future presi
dential candidate Gary Hart ex
plained what he perceives as Presi
dent George W. Bush's failures in the
war on terrorism and presented his
own plan fora principled foreign
policy framework in a speech yester
day afternoon at the Law School.
Hart, who was a democratic sena
tor from Colorado from 1975 to
1987, is touring the country lecturing
on various topics in preparation for
an announcement in March about
whether he will be a presidential can
didate. Hart said he is trying to fill the
"vacuum of ideas" among current
political leaders. He spoke about
both domestic and foreign policy,
oudining more failures than success
es and suggesting a way to put the
country on the right track.
"This president is not doing his

job in protecting this country," he
said. "We will be attacked and we're
not ready."
Hart, who chaired the U.S. Com
mission on National Security for the
21 st Century, said that terrorism is an
increasing threat, especially if the
United States goes to war against
Iraq. In 1999 his commission pre
dicted a terrorist attack in the United
States and called fora department of
homeland security.
Expanding his focus beyond ter
rorism, Hart said that neither Bush
nor former President Bill Clinton
had properly defined a foreign poli
cy framework that worked after the
Cold War.
"What is .. . lacking in the public
debate these days," he said, "is the
sense of what our larger purposes
are, what resources we can apply to
achieve those, and how we intend to

Gary Hart, who spoke about foreign policy and ter

apply those resources to achieve
those purposes."
"America does not possess a
grand strategy," he said, "frhere]
was a simple slogan, containment
of communism ... [but after the
fall of communism], both political
parties have failed to fill that vacu
um."
Fora decade after his 1988 pres
idential run, which ended after al
legations that he was conducting an
extra-marital affair, Hart lived in
political obscurity, practicing law
and earning a doctorate from Ox
ford University. Now Hart is at
tempting a political comeback by
applying his work in political theo
ry — studying Jeffersonian ideals
and the founding of America — to
contemporary political times.
Hart laid out eight basic points
in what he deems an essential for

eign policy framework fora post-
Cold War and post-Sept. 11 world.
He spoke of encouraging democ
racy, leveraging economic strength
to help the third world, using mili
tary power judiciously and trusting
international institutions and al
liances.
"I may be the last of the existing
idealists," Hart said.
Hart then shifted to discussing
domestic politics.
The emphasis in political dia
logue today, he argued, needs to be
more about the duties of a republic
rather than the rights of a democ
racy.
"We must earn our rights by
performance of our duties," he
said, explaining how Americans
needed to take responsibility for
their government.
Hart explained how he sees
globalization and the information
revolution setting the stage fora re
turn to Jeffersonian democracy fo
cused on civic virtue, popular sov
ereignty and a sense of the corn

mon good.
Hart noted that, because he is
not running for office now, he does
not have specific proposals on
many topics. However, he ex
pressed particular opinions about
certain issues, such as terrorism
and campaign finance.
In outlining how the United
States can return to a Jeffersonian
ideal, he discussed the need fora
drastic change in campaign fi
nance. He based his conclusion on
the notion that corruption is not
stealing money but doing anything
that is not in the national interest.
"If you use the classical defini
tion of corruption, this is a massive
ly corrupt republic," he said. "Even
post-McCain-Feingold, special in
terests run this government."
Media pundits have claimed
that Hart's aversion to fundraising
may cause him to forgo another
run for the presidency.
"Right now, there should be a
competition of ideas instead of
money," he said, explaining why

lie was talking to law students in
stead of attending a 112 undraiser.
Discussing his ideas with law stu
dents, Hart spent more time teach
ing about government — how it
should function and how past
politicians had conceived it — than
pushing his own political ideas. In
the classroom, he answered one in
quiry by walking up to the board
and drawing out the political spec
trum as he sees it. He defined his
approach as bringing the Democ
ratic party toward the future, not
toward the typical political center.
After the speech, Political Sci
ence Prof. Chip Blacker, who ad
vised Hart during his term in the
Senate and during his presidential
campaign, did not speculate on
whether Hart would run.
"I hope he decides to run,"
Blacker said. "If he runs he will
both enrich and enliven the de
bate."
Tricia Miller, a second-year law
student, said, "I think he brings a
fresh perspective to the debate."
