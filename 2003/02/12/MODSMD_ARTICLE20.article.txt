# Zimmerman en garde for Titan Games
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Joking and congenial, Iris Zimmer
man really puts you at ease. You forget
that you are talking to an Olympian and
one of the most accomplished fencers in
the nation.
Starting tomorrow, Zimmerman, a
Stanford senior and a competitor in the
2000 Summer Games, will lead the U.S.
Fencing Team into the 2003 Titan
Games, a brand-new competition held at
the 5,000-seat San Jose State Events Cen
ter.
The team will also feature three-time
Ail-American Alex Wood, a 2000 Stan
ford graduate from San Francisco. One
male and one female competitor will
represent each fencing weapon (£p£e,
foil, and sabre) and compete against

teams from Mexico, Canada, Brazil,
Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Puer
to Rico and the Philippines.
Developed by the United States
Olympic Committee, the Titan Games
will feature a "U.S. vs. the World" format
in dual and triangular meets in all of the
summer Olympics combative sports.
The venue will accommodate four fenc
ing platforms, with competition continu
ously happening on at least three plat
forms throughout the three-day event.
Team and individual winners will be
named for each sport, with the honor of
"Ultimate Titan" up for grabs.
"This is part of the USOC's campaign
of'The Olympics aren't every four years
but everyday,'" Zimmerman said about
the games. "It is used as a way for the ath
letes to get to know who their competi
tion is for Athens [Summer Games

2004J. It makes the athletes and the
sports more accessible to the public. It
also gives the athletes and the USOC ex
posure that they don't often get."
Zimmerman, a 22-year-old political
science major, will "head Team USA,"
according to the Titan Games' press re
lease. She has had a long international
fencing career, starting at age 14 when
she became the first U.S. fencer in histo
ry to win a world championship tide.
Zimmerman captured gold at the 1995
World Under-17 Championships. Since
then she has become a multiple under
-20 and under-17 world medalist, and
she finished 11th individually and fourth
with the U.S. team at the 2000 Olympic
Games. She currently captains the
women's varsity fencing team at Stan-

ford, and finished first in the
women's foil competition at the
2001 NCAA championships.
Asked about her thoughts en
tering these high-profile games,
Zimmerman said, "I am very excit
ed about this event. It gives me a
chance to show my friends and
professors what I am doing with
my life outside of school. I like the
campaign and the idea that the
Olympics are everyday, because it
is for true for me."
Wood, her former Cardinal

comrade and Titan Games
teammate, was the 1999-2000
captain of the fencing team and
a three time All-American. He is
currently ranked No. 7 in the
nation.
Other members of the U.S.
Fencing Team that will compete
this weekend include Eric Hansen
and Kristin Suchorski on £p£e,
Colin Parker and Sada Jacobson
on sabre. Both Zimmerman and
Wood are foilists, giving Stanford a
monopoly on that weapon.
Zimmerman expressed enthu
siasm at the weekend's prospects,
and its promises of promoting the
underexposed sport of fencing.
"This publicity stuff goes dou

bly for fencing, since we often
don't get any coverage," Zimmer
man said. "People always ask me if
fencing is in the Olympics, some
even try to convince me that what
I am doing is more of a dance than
a sport."
Zimmerman encouraged the
Stanford community to come and
support her and the rest of the
U.S. Fencing Team this weekend.
"I want everyone to come," she in
sisted.
Pre-sale tickets can be obtained
through Ticketmaster. Alterna
tively, the events will be delay
broadcasted on ESPN2 on March
29 from 3 - 4 p.m. (EST), and 4:30
- 5:30 p.m. (EST) on March 30.
