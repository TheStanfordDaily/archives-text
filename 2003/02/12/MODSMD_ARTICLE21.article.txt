I hate February. I hate it, I
hate it, I hate it. In terms of
sports, February offers ab
solutely nothing. Aside from
crappy Stanford Daily Sports
columns, all you get are seven
minute Raptors-Cavs highlights
on Sports Center, random Canadi
an NHL teams you never knew ex
isted filing for bankruptcy (The
Ottawa Senators are still in the
league?), and an increase in rat
ings for the Pro Bowling Tour
(that PDW is so hot right now).
And you wonder why so many
ESPN employees turn to crack.

And don't
even talk to me
about the NBA
All-Star game.
Vince
Carter, taking the
Idiot of the Week
award away from
last week's win
ner Mike Vander-

jagt, took his sweet time to hear
everyone from Tracy McGrady to
the third string ballboy yell at him
to look at his "MJ's Send-off"
script. It was painful.
Vince, next time check your
ego at the door and capitalize on
an image-enhancing favor. Be
sides, you could use the rest on the
bench. Playing 15 games so far this
season must have been very stren
uous.
Thank God this wasn't the only
story of the week. There was
Brett Hull's 700 th goal, the "Dude
you're getting a Dell" guy was
arrested for buying pot, there was
Leßron's reinstatement (how
ironic was it that the All-Star game
was played in throwback jerseys?),
but above all else, there was the
start of baseball training camp.
No, I'm not kidding, I can't wait
for baseball and spring training is
the best part of it. It's a time where
anything and

everything is possible. Think the
Tigers will win 90 games? Think
the Yankees will have an 8-day ro
tation? Think the Giants can make
it back to the Series? Now is the
time to believe it. Now is the time
to hope.
But baseball isn't about the
major leagues. It isn't about Barry
Bonds, it isn't about Roger
Clemens, and dare I say it, it isn't
about Nomar. It's about family,
it's about emotion, it's about tradi
tion, and it's about time. Baseball
certainly doesn't start with the
Major League, but sometimes, it
seems as if it ends with it.
My dad fell out with baseball
after the 1994 strike, and it almost
killed me. It was his one man
protest against a league that said
"We know you'll be back." And he
closed the door, turned off the TV
and told his kids to go play
lacrosse.
Now he's not wrong by any
means, I hated that strike, and I
was just 10 years old. But for some
reason, my brother and I found a
way to look past the strike, look
past the majors, and keep playing
the game. We gave a big middle
finger to the players' union and
the owners simultaneously, but we
kept throwing and catching.
So I made it back home last
weekend for my mom's birthday,
and aside from watching my
youngest brother do his best imita
tion of Jason Kidd (pass, pass, pass,
don't even look at the basket), and
my obligatory visit to my high
school, I got my glove and played
catch with my brother.
It was just so natural to catch
the baseball again and again and
throw it back. We live on a little hill
with a cul-de-sac, so it's not flat by
any means, but that just seems to
help the curveball. And the best

Get in the hole!
In October, freshman Kelly Husted and the Stanford women's golf team closed out the fall season with a third
place finish at the Kent Youel Invitational. Today, the Cardinal enters the final round of action at the Northrup
Grumman Regional Challenge at the Palos Verdes Golf Club. Stanford has been paced in its first tournament
of the spring season by senior Kim Rowton, whose two-round total of 153 puts her in 18th place and nine
shots behind Pepperdine's Katherine Hull atop the leaderboard. Despite the efforts of junior Angela Rho and
sophomore Wendra Liang, who recorded a hole-in-one on the 15th hole during yesterda/s rain-soaked
round, the Cardinal finished the day in 14th place, 39 shots off me lead.
