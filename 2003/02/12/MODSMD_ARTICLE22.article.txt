Rethinking RNA
A decade ago, textbooks would tell
you that DNA encodes proteins and
that RNA is simply an intermediary
step. In recent years this vision has
been radically changing. Scientists
have compelling evidence that life
probably arose first as RNA and pro
teins, before associating with DNA. Bi
ologists have been especially excited
by self-catalyzing RNAs, which unlike

DNA and common RNA, can regulate their own func
tions. A team from Harvard and Massachusetts Gener
al Hospital recently announced in Nature, the science
journal, that RNA sometimes regulates DNA function.
In their study, researchers used RNA interference to
turn genes in a worm off one by one. Preliminary evi
dence also suggests that vast portions of DNA that were
thought to be extraneous could actually be encoding
these snippets of RNA.
Champagne Superaovae
Astronomers at Lawrence Berkeley National Labo
ratory announced two weeks ago the discovery of 34
new supernovae. Supernovae are the violent deaths of
the most massive stars. The explosions are so powerful
that fora few days the star can actually illuminate more
than an entire galaxy of 100 million stars and can thus
be observed at very long distances. The team analyzed
photos of many different parts of the universe to detect
these supernovae. The goal was to understand what
the stars looked like before the explosion and discover
the mechanisms that led to the supernova.

Tree Plague Returns
A plague of insects is decimating tree life in India.
The insect, Derolus discicollis Gahenm, has resurfaced
after almost 100 years and has infected thousands of
Kherji trees in the desert state of Rajasthan. Kherji is
one of the few trees that thrive in the desert and is used
for firewood, fodder and sometimes food. The insect
larva damages the tree by depleting the sap and creat
ing long incisions that allow fungal infections to grow.
Human projects have also diminished water supply to
trees, making them more vulnerable to the disease. In
dian scientists warn that without care the problem
could soon spread to other desert trees.
Decoding Breast Cancer
Researchers at the National Cancer Institute an
nounced the discovery of a new gene for breast cancer.
The team found that a particular protein expressed by
the BASE gene was only present in cancerous cells and
salivary glands, which have the same common origin as
breasts. Cancer occurs when a cell growth regulating
gene goes haywire and cells start to multiply uncon
trollably. Scientists have identified hundreds of differ
ent genes causing breast cancer but some are more in
fluential than others. The team believes the newly dis
covered BASE gene is one of the more influential ones.
Electrical Lasers
Physicists at Harvard demonstrated that single-crys
tal nanowire can act as an effective laser when electrici
ty is passed through it. Lasers are essentially mono
chromatic light crystals that focus light until it is uni
form and does not dissipate with distance. Current
lasers are based on optics rather than electronics,
meaning they take light and not current as input. The
researchers demonstrated that passing current
through a single nano-size crystal can give monochro
matic light. The researchers say that it is essential to
learn more about the physical properties of electric
lasers before they are widely used. They predict that
applications — such as delicate laser surgery — could
be available in as little as five years.
Terror by Ricin
Bio-terrorism hit headlines again recently when
British police caught a group in London in possession
of small amounts of ricin and equipment to produce it.
Ricin is a cytotoxic present in castor oil, which is used
industrially in lipsticks paints and varnishes. Naturally
it occurs in minute quantities and is harmless, but con
centrated it can be a powerful poison. Mere skin con
tad will not cause any danger but injections can lie fatal.
There are no antitoxins available.
