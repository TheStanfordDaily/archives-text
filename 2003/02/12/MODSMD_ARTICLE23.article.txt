# DECODING HUMAN HISTORY:
## BIOTECH MEETS THE STONE ACE 
### BRONWYN BARNETT 
About 50,000 years ago, modern humans — Homo sapiens — evolved from
their less sophisticated predecessors. Today, the latest genetic technologies are
being used to isolate and date genes, which could provide anthropologists with an
additional fossil record, one that can't be seen with the naked eye.
The archaeological record, now supported by biological evidence, shows that hu
mans had existed in Africa for 50,000 years before they began acting modern. T hen
somediing happened.
Richard Klein, professor of anthropological sciences at Stanford, has made a ca
reer out of studying this change. "Suddenly, modern-looking people began to behave
in a modern way, in producing art and jewelry and doing a whole variety of other
things that they hadn't done before. And then they spread, based on that change in
behavior," he said. Some say it was a gradual, cultural change. Klein thinks they're
wrong.
"I think there was a biological change — a genetic mutation of some kind that pro
moted the fully modern ability to create and innovate," he said.
Klein will present his perspective this coming Saturday, at the annual meeting of

the American Association for the Ad-

vancement of Science in Denver.
"Nearly everybody believes
that modern humans, people
that look like you and me, orig-

inated in Africa sometime
within the last hundred
thousand years or so," Klein
said. But what happened in
the next 50 to 60,000 years
is still up in the air.
Breakthroughs in
biotechnology may soon
provide an answer. By find
ing out the rate of variation
of a gene among the current

population, geneticists can
infer the approximate date at
which only one variant existed

that is, when that particular gene evolved. The FOXP2 gene, which is involved in lan
guage, was recently isolated and dated.
It evolved "sometime between last Tuesday and 200,000 years ago," Klein said.
That estimate is highly conservative, and Klein believes it's closer to 50,000 years ago.
This could suggest that the ability to communicate, brought about by the evolution of
the FOXP2 gene, was at least one part of the change that occurred so long ago.
"There may be other genes that we can identify that all changed in some way
around 50,000 years ago. They would have to be genes involved in cognition or com
munication. If you can show that, then my idea would be, I think, widely accepted,"
he said.
What about using fossils to identify biological changes that occurred? But accord
ing to Klein, fossils do not reveal much about biological changes over the years.
"There's nothing about the outside of the skull, or even the inside, which tells you
very much about how a brain functioned. And that's a problem."
So how exactly do they find out the date of a gene?
"Every generation there are at least a small number of mistakes that are made in
copying the DNA to pass it on to the next generation," explained Alec Knight, a re
search associate in the Department of Anthropological Sciences. By counting the

number of changes, or mutations, that have occurred,
scientists can estimate a mutation rate and thus the

age of a particular gene.
"We're just at the very beginning of what could
develop into an extremely exciting new field, ac-

tually pinning down the mutations that took
place at this point in time that made us
modern human," Knight said. "That's re
ally what evolution is: a genetic change
from generation to generation," he
added.
Finding and counting the number of
variations in a gene takes an enormous
amount of work. Luigi Cavalli-Sforza,

professor emeritus of genetics at
Stanford, has been doing it since
1964, when the process was

painstakingly slow. "We take a
piece of DN A and examine it
fully. Ideally we examine it
in all individuals, it's expen
| sive and it takes time and
work," he said.
Scientists can't expect
to examine DNA from every
individual on earth, but they
do enough to find all the varia-

tions. "After a while, it's difficult
to find new types," Cavalli said.
Does Cavalli believe it was a genetic mu-

tation that brought mankind out of the Middle Stone
Age?
"I don't know. It could even be a cultural

change," he answered.
One possibility that has been considered is technological advances — he suggest
ed the invention of boats as a possible catalyst. But what gave them the ability to make
these advances? Perhaps the genes will tell.
