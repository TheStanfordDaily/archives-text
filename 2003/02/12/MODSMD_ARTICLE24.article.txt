# From Googol to Google:
## Co-founder returns 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I always wanted to be an inventor," said
L,arry Page, the co-founder of search engine
Google and former Stanford doctoral stu
dent.
Page, 30, spoke to a full auditorium of
Stanford students at the teaching center of the
Science and Engineering Quad on Friday.
His talk, entitled "Stanford and Google and
the World, Oh My!" was a humorous and in
sightful account of how the now profitable
and popular search engine came into being.
Page explained that the creation of Google
was by pure chance. After his adviser suggest
ed that Page investigate the Internet, Page
collaborated with a fellow student, Sergey
Brin, to create a system for exploring the
Web.
"We built a whole ranking system for In
ternet sites," he said. "We accidentally created
a search engine."
Brin and Page initially named their cre
ation Backßub, based on its ability to analyze
the "back links" to a Web site.
"But we realized Backßub wasn't the
world's greatest name," Page said. Instead, he
and Brin looked through Web sites and URLs
before finally stumbling across a list of very
large numbers. The word "google" was at the
top.
A friend later pointed out, however, that
the number is actually spelled "googol." But
the misspelling had two o's and ended with 'le'
so they decided to stick with it, Page said. Plus,
the Google domain name was still available.
A googol is the number one followed by
100 zeros. According to the Google Web site,
"There isn't a googol of anything in the uni
verse. Not stars, not dust particles, not atoms."
The name reflects Google's mission to orga
nize the limidess amount of information on
the Web.
Originally, the whole Cioogle system con
sisted of a dozen computers in Page's dorm
room. To save money, Page and Brin built the
computer housings out of l>ego bricks. The
early search engine could also only handle
one query every second. Beyond that, the
search took forever, Page said, because of the

system's low capacity.
Despite these limitations, Google slowly
started gaining popularity among Internet
users. Realizing that Google needed room to
expand, Page and Brin tried selling their bur
geoning creation to all of the major Internet
companies at the time. Every company
turned them down. One CEO even told them
that users didn't care about searching on the
Web.
"We were Ph.D. students," Page said. "Re
luctantly, we went on leave and we started a
company."
Google may have started out as a few com
puters, but Page and Brin were soon able to
amass over $25 million in investment money
to start their company.
"This is how we spent all of our money ini
tially," he said, "continuing in the Lego tradi
tion, we decided to build our own machines.
