Here's the bottom
line: there is such a
thing as alcoholic
hepatitis and it
doesn't involve you getting
drunk every night. All you
need is excessive consumption
and you can kiss your liver
good bye.
That doesn't mean you
should stop drinking alcohol.

It just means
you should
drink in mod
eration.
Even Shibu,
the clerk at
Ernie's Wine
and Liquor on
El Camino,
agrees. "We

like the business we get, but we
don't want students getting
hurt," he said.
Shibu gets around 100 to
120 Stanford students visiting
his store every weekend. As
suming each student purchas
es a $20 alcoholic beverage,
that's more than $2,000 of al
cohol consumed by students
alone. Good for Shibu, bad for
your liver.
So what is alcoholic hepati
tis? "I didn't even know such a
thing existed," said Robert
Sheckler, a Junior majoring in
linguistics.
Alcoholic hepatitis is a very
serious condition in which the
liver is inflamed due to the ef
fects of alcohol. It is usually a
precursor to more dangerous
conditions such as chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis. So,
consider yourself forewarned
if you are struck with alco
holic hepatitis.
The disease is very finicky in
that it can show symptoms in
some people and not others.
The clinical features of alco

holic hepatitis may include ab
dominal pain, nausea, fever,
jaundice, spider-like blood ves
sels in the vein, ascites (fluid
build-up in the abdominal cav
ity), poor appetite and fatigue.
As with any list of symptoms,
do not automatically assume
you have alcoholic hepatitis if
you meet most of the require
ments for it. Conversely, if you
fail to meet any of the specific
conditions and know yourself
to be a heavy drinker, do not
assume you are free of hazard.
Symptoms are variable so it is
best to consult your physician
fora diagnosis.
When you go to your doc
tor, he / she will perform a few
tests, which involve taking
blood samples for liver func
tion studies, electrolyte tests,
bleeding times and cellular
blood counts. An ultrasound
will elucidate the internal or
gans of the abdomen. The or
gans that need to be checked
include the liver, spleen and
kidneys.
After a few of days your doc
tor will be able to tell you if you
have alcoholic hepatitis. If you
do have it, don't panic. There
is one solution: stop drinking!
Xhere is no medication to cure
alcoholic hepatitis.
Treatment involves reduc
ing the symptoms and halting
the progression of the disease.
General measures include ab
stinence, nutritive support (vit
amin supplementation with
folic acid and thiamin) and di
etary adjustments. Specific
treatments depend on your
age, drinking history, medical
history and your willingness to
heal yourself. Although there is
