# Online software battles plagiarism at Stanford
## 
### ALI AUEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
It is becoming increasingly common for
professors and TAs at Stanford to use soft
ware and other Internet-based utilities like
Google to catch violations of the honor
code. A recent report by Duke University's
Center for Academic Integrity suggested
that cheating is increasing at universities
nationwide. The trend is sending educa
tors looking for software to catch instances
of plagiarism.
Between 1998 and 2001, Stanford's Of
fice of Judicial Affairs saw a 126 percent in
crease in violations of the honor code.
Since then the office has

been working with the
University to reverse the
trend.
As an Internet search
can be time intensive, ed
ucators have sought the
services of online anti-

plagiarism software that automatically
searches the Internet and compares a sub
mitted work to those available online. The
program gives the user a measure of the
overlap between a student's paper and
what it finds on the Web.
George Wilson, the Office of Judicial Af
fairs program coordinator, acknowledges
the efficacy of online anti-plagiarism utili
ties.
"If it comes up on the Internet, that's
good evidence that cheating has been tak
ing place," Wilson said.
Turnitin, which is arguably the world's
leading anti-plagiarism system, operates in
50 countries and checks 10,000 student pa
pers daily. The service requires a universi
ty subscription and can be costly.
If funding is unavailable, alternatives
exist. Plagiserve and the Berkeley-devel
oped Measure of Software Similarity
(MOSS) program are currendy available to
educators free of charge.
Plagiserve verifies the originality of a
student's work by comparing it to over
150,000 term papers, essays and Cliffs
Notes available in its database, which is up

dated via an Internet search algorithm that
constantly scours the Web. If a student has
plagiarized his or her manuscript from any
of over 100 online resources, the search
routine will find the source.
The MOSS program determines simi
larity between lines of computer code. Cur
rently the software is limited to common
programming languages such as C, C+ + ,
Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp and Scheme.
Communications Prof. William Woo,
who has first-hand experience with anti
plagiarism software, says online utilities are
good for checking periodicals, journals
and the like.
"To the extent that the Internet is a great
source of plagiarism, it is a

great way to catch plagia
rism," Woo said.
Despite their useful
ness, anti-plagiarism soft
ware is not foolproof.
"There are obvious coin
cidences," Woo said.

Plagiarism is not a problem unique to
schools in the United States. In Britain,
universities also subscribe to Turnitin.
According to John Barrie, the founder
of Turnitin, officials in Canada, Australia
and New Zealand are considering making
it available to all their schools, the Pasade
na Star-News said recently.
"We have to accept the fact that there is
an enormous cheating problem at most in
stitutions," Barrie said. "The problem is so
old and has gone unchecked for so long,
students have got very bold, think th ;y can
get away with it and that no computer can
catch them."
Despite the availability of anti-plagia
rism software, Woo believes the solution
lies at the classroom level.
"The first line of defense against pla
giarism is for me as a teacher to make my
expectations clear, to help students un
derstand how to do research," Woo said.
"It increases in a good way the responsi
bility of a teacher."
Whether or not software will have any
effect on the national cheating trend re
mains to be seen.
