### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
A draw last Friday concluded the six
game chess match between Garry Kas
parov and IBM's Deep Junior, setting
the final score at 3 - 3.
A sum of $300,000, in addition to the
$500,000 given to Kasparov for playing
against Deep Junior, will be shared be
tween the contenders.
"I had one item on my agenda today:
not to lose," Kasparov told the Associat
ed Press. "And a draw was a good re
sult."
The former world chess champion
was attempting to avenge his defeat in
1997 to IBM's Deep Blue, a super
computer. Deep Junior, which is soft
ware that runs on a standard PC, al
legedly uses a more sophisticated
move-selection algorithm, consider
ing only the strongest possible posi
tions in detail.
Built by two Israeli programmers,
Deep Junior beat 18 other programs in
a worldwide competition last summer.
The stakes were high in game six.
The series' five other games and his loss
in 1997 weighed heavily on Kasparov's
mind.

"Unlike a machine, I can't forget the
five previous games," Kasparov said.
"Fora human player to play under such
conditions, it's a terrible burden."
Kasparov offered a draw on the
23rd move after playing himself into a
superior position. Deep Junior turned
down the offer but presented its own
draw five moves later, which, to the
crowd's dismay, Kasparov readily ac

cepted.
Kasparov said he played better
than Deep Junior in game six and
would have pressed fora win in a sim
ilar position against a human oppo
nent. But he feared the computer
would have capitalized on even the
smallest mistake.
"The machine will never collapse,"
he said. "[Though] a human can never
be so sure."
According to Shay Bushinsky, who
co-programmed Deep Junior with
Amir Ban, the computer was no threat
to humankind, even though it was chal
lenging a human.
"Most chess officials feel that chess
programs do benefit the [chess] game,"
he said.
At age 12, the 39-year-old- Kas
parov rose to chess prominence as a
Soviet junior champion. He has held
the world's number one point system
ranking since 1984, despite occasion
al losses to humans, and has achieved
almost mythic status in the chess
world.
Deep Junior, which can process
three million chess moves per second, is
a three-time computer world champion
and hasn't lost to a human in two years.
