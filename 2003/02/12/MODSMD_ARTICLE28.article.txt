# Summit to address bio-ethics issues
## 
### CAROLINE MOORE-KOCHLACS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Is genetically modified food safe?
Should genes be patentable? What moral
claim does the human embryo have on
us? Should we use human embryos in
stem cell research and cloning? Will this
research lead to designer babies?
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the discovery of DNA, The Future of Life
Summit later this month will seek to ad
dress these questions. Hosted by Time
magazine, the summit will run from Feb.
19 until Feb. 21 in Monterey, CA
The star of the show will be Nobel
Laureate James Watson, one of the three
co-discoverers of the DNA double helix.
On April 2,1953, the science journal
Nature printed a paper from James
Watson and Francis Crick suggesting

the structure of DNA: two chains of de
oxyribose sugars and phosphate
groups attached by pairs of nitroge
nous bases. The chains are twisted to
gether in the twisted ladder shaped
"double helix."
Watson and Crick received a Nobel
Prize in 1962, along with Maurice
Wilkins for their work. Today's hot bi
ological fields of genetics and genomics
could not do their current work with
out understanding the structure of
DNA.
The event's other speakers include
evolutionary scientist Richard Dawkins,
author of "The Selfish Gene," U.S. Sur
geon General Vice Admiral Richard H.
Carmona and Bill Joy, chief scientist at
Sun Microsystems.
While most of the questions raised in
the summit will be human â€” centered,

there will be one panel relating to the big
ger ecological question titled, "And What
About the Other 9,999,999 Species?"
"The panel includes all the people you
would want to have on a biodiversity
panel," said Stewart Brand, panel mod
erator and Stanford class of 1960.
"We have no idea how many species
exist on earth. There are 1.6 million
identified. In ecology, a whole lot of our
knowledge is probably wrong because it
is based on incomplete data. Genome
analysis allows rapid discovery of new
species. Automated discovery is helping
ecology," he said.
