### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Featuring a $25,000 prize pool, the Berkeley-
Stanford 2003 Innovator's Challenge is anything
but the typical college contest. To be held on April
19 at Stanford, the event will give participants a
chance to present their engineering research.
"[lt] is a joint technology contest organized by
VERTEX, the Engineering Entrepreneurship
Club at UC-Berkeley, and BASES, the Business As
sociation of Stanford Engineering Students," said
Everett Yeh, a member of the BASES Interact
team, which is organizing the contest.
According to Yeh, I-Challenge is a showcase for
innovative research, particularly in the field of en
gineering.
"It serves as an inviting forum for the communi
ty to learn more about the research going on at
Stanford and UC-Berkeley," he said.
Since at least one member from each team must
be affiliated with their university's School of Engi
neering, Aparna Bhatnagar, vice president of the
BASES Interact team, said the contest has been re
ferred to as "The Big Game of Technology.'"
"[The] Innovators' Challenge is based primarily
on technological ingenuity and its potential to cre
ate an impact on society," Yeh said.
Prominent technologists from research labs, in
dustry and the venture capital community will
judge the challenge, he added
Former judges have included the founder of
Hotmail, Timbre Technologies, directors of Daim

lerChrysler Labs, Siemens Labs, ST Microelectron
ics, Microsoft, executives from Applied Materials,
Lockheed, Agilent, and partners from Sevin Rosen
Funds, Sofinova Ventures and Diamondhead Ven
tures.

According to the I-Challenge Web site, entries
will be judged on innovative design, impact, future
possibilities, experimental method and validity.
Yeh commented on eligibility guidelines for par
ticipation.
"The level of disclosure is no more than a public
research conference or poster session," he said.
"Sponsored projects that would not be allowed to
be shown at a public research fair or public confer
ence are not appropriate entries for this contest."
Yeh sees the competition as a unusual occasion.
"If you think you have something that is innova
tive, has potential for impact and can be developed
to the benefit of industry, [I-Challenge] is your op
portunity to show the world," he said. "[The] Inno
vators' Challenge is a rare chance for industry lead
ers at the cutting edge to assess your work and give
you their tried and true opinion."
Teams selected in the preliminary judging ses
sion will have the opportunity to showcase their
work on campus at the April 19 exhibition to a
panel of judges who will decide the winners.
Last year's winners include a capacitor-less dou
ble-gate cell technology, digital lithography for
next generation IC manufacturing and mask-less
micro-ion beam reduction lithography. Abstracts
of past winning projects and more information can
