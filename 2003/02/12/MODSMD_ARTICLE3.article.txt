### VAUHINI VARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Violence against women has implica
tions that extend far beyond the home,
said three speakers at a Stanford In Gov
ernment panel held last night as part of
this week's V-Day events.
The"V" in V-Day, a global movement
focusing on ending violence against
women, stands for "victory, vagina and
valentine."
Law School Prof. Deborah Rhode
joined with Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin and Human Biology Prof. Anne

Firth Murray to discuss the politics of do
mestic and sexual violence. Though each
speaker concentrated on the conse
quences of violence in her respective
field, they shared the view that violence
against women is a problem that spans
many academic fields.
One-third of women in the world have
been abused and 90 percent of domestic
assaults do not result in prosecution, said
the panelists.
Murray pointed out that this amounts
to an epidemic from a public health
standpoint.
She discussed the public health reper

cussions that take place when cultures
focus on violence as a means to solve
problems.
"The most powerful nation in the
world can go to war to maintain power,"
she said. "We live in a world that not only
tolerates violence, but also glorifies it in a
way."
Rhode emphasized the importance of
government action, both abroad and in
the United States.
"This is a nation that spends more on
abused animals than on abused women,"
