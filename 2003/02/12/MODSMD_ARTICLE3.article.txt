## 
### VAUHINI VARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Violence against women has implica
tions that extend far beyond the home,
said three speakers at a Stanford In Gov
ernment panel held last night as part of
this week's V-Day events.
The"V" in V-Day, a global movement
focusing on ending violence against
women, stands for "victory, vagina and
valentine."
Law School Prof. Deborah Rhode
joined with Political Science Prof. Susan
Okin and Human Biology Prof. Anne

Firth Murray to discuss the politics of do
mestic and sexual violence. Though each
speaker concentrated on the conse
quences of violence in her respective
field, they shared the view that violence
against women is a problem that spans
many academic fields.
One-third of women in the world have
been abused and 90 percent of domestic
assaults do not result in prosecution, said
the panelists.
Murray pointed out that this amounts
to an epidemic from a public health
standpoint.
She discussed the public health reper

cussions that take place when cultures
focus on violence as a means to solve
problems.
"The most powerful nation in the
world can go to war to maintain power,"
she said. "We live in a world that not only
tolerates violence, but also glorifies it in a
way."
Rhode emphasized the importance of
government action, both abroad and in
the United States.
"This is a nation that spends more on
abused animals than on abused women,"
she said.
Okin pointed out that domestic
and sexual violence have received
more attention in recent years as
the women's rights movement has
gained momentum. In the past
decade, international organiza
tions such as the United Nations
have begun acknowledging the
problem and working to alleviate
it.
Still, it is important to raise
awareness, according to sopho
more May Chiang and freshman
Kiyomi Burchill, the Stanford in
Government members who orga
nized the panel.
According to audience mem
bers, their efforts succeeded.
"It's an area that I knew very lit
tle about," said junior Ramit Sethi.
"I was interested in getting a dif
ferent perspective on the actual
academic issues surrounding
women's violence."
Chiang and Burchill proposed
the panel after attending a speech
in November by Eve Ensler, au
thor of "The Vagina Mono
logues." They were especially in
terested in discussing "the larger
impact of violence" in areas such
as law, policy, human rights and
public heal til.
"We didn't want it to be like,
'Domestic violence happens inde
pendently from other social
events,' because it doesn't," Chi
ang said.
Audience members appreciat
ed the interdisciplinary approach.
"It's really important to show
that this issue is interrelated with
health, economic and human
rights issues," said junior Margaret
Reynolds, a human biology major
focusing on women's health. "It's
great to see high-powered women
talk about these things."
