# Students to teach refugees
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seniors Kujtesa Bejtullahu and George
Michalopoulos will fly to Botswana this spring break
to learn about the Dukwi refugee camp, where they
and about 10 other students will be working this
summer. They will not provide aid or give dona
tions, but will instead teach young people how to be
leaders, start their own projects and fix problems
within their own communities.
"There's a big sense of victimization among all the
refugees [around the world]," Michalopoulos said.
"just because you're poor doesn't mean you can't
make your situation better," Bejtullahu added.
Bejtullahu and Michalopoulos are in the middle
of creating the World Refugee Academy, a program
that aims to foster leadership skills and help teach
refugees bring about positive changes in their own
refugee camps.
Bejtullahu has lived in two drastically different
environments — Kosovo's capital city Pristina,
where bombs fell outside her apartment, and Stan
ford, where she has pursued the life of a typical
American college student.
Speaking of her friends in Kosovo, Bejtullahu
said, "They had a feeling that they were really pow
erless."
In contrast, entrepreneurship and leadership are
highly valued at Stanford. Here, everyone has expe
rience planning and organizing things,
Michalopoulos said.
Bejtallahu originally gained fame for describing
her plight in Kosovo via e-mail to Finnegan Ham
mill, a high school student from Berkeley. The e
mails were read aloud in a National Public Radio se
ries, "E-mails from Kosovo," and were subsequently
picked up by numerous news outlets and quoted by
former President Bill Clinton.

This summer, a World Refugee Academy pilot pro
gram will focus on understanding and solving problems
in a 3,500-person refugee camp in Botswana. The co
ordinators plan on taking a group of approximately 10
people and creating small projects based on the needs
of the community.
They see tasks ranging from teaching about HIV
/ AIDS prevention to designing recreational facili
ties.
"When a young person comes with an idea, they
will definitely find support," Bejtullahu said, refer
ring to her experience in Kosovo and the willingness
of international donors to help build self-sustaining
community projects.
While the leaders of the World Refugee Academy
are brimming with ideas about how to teach leader
ship skills, they note that, at the moment, they have
one shortcoming: fundraising.
"We're having a little bit of difficulty there,"
Michalopoulos said.
Right now the group is keeping its options
open. Group members might receive funding
from the United Nations High Commission on
Refugees, Stanford departments or local busi
nesses, Michalopoulos said. As a voluntary stu
dent organization, all of their funding sources
must be approved by the University.
The organizers plan to use each step of the
process as a way to raise more money for the next
one. Senior Travis Tarr will film their trip over
spring break and their pilot program this summer.
Hopefully this will encourage donations, the coordi
nators said.
The coordinators said that they are enthusiastic
about planning a global event, despite challenges in
fundraising.
"As college students, we're committed," Bejtul
lahu said. "As long as we stay committed ... we can
make this program sustainable.
