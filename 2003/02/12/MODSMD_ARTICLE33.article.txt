## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 300 sophomores,
faculty members and alumni gath
ered in the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center yesterday evening
for the second of two Sophomore
Academic Dinners.
Sponsored by the Class of 2005,
the Stanford Alumni Association,
The Stanford Fund and the vice
provosts for undergraduate edu
cation and student affairs, these
dinners acquainted students with
faculty and alumni who share sim
ilar academic interests.
The 225 students who were ad
mitted to the dinner had to apply
online to reserve a spot and speci
fy their particular academic field.
Faculty, alumni and other Univer
sity representatives were scattered
over 32 tables, organized by fields
varying from art history to human
biology.
"(The dinner] is a chance for
students, faculty and alumni to talk
about their interests and passions,"
said Zach Katigiri, one of the
sophomore class presidents. "It's a
great opportunity for students."
Paul Wilkins, who is also a
sophomore class president,
thought that the dinners went "re
ally well," noting that he has gotten
"a lot of positive feedback" from
students and faculty.
Over dinner and dessert, the
discussions at each table covered
everything from faculty research
to alumni's favorite classes and ca
reer options for students. Some
alumni brought in samples of their
work to inspire students interested
in their particular fields.
The attendees listened to two
speakers, who offered advice for
those currendy trying to deter
mine their majors and careers.
Alumna Kathy Levinson, the

first speaker, talked about the im
portance of pursuing academic in
terests. She stressed "having a love
of learning for the sake of learn
ing" and praised Stanford for"the
opportunity [it] gave [her] to expe
rience all sorts of different things."
Levinson advised students to think
for themselves and follow their
academic passions.
Expanding on Levinson's mes
sage, Anthropological Sciences
Prof. William Durham encour

aged attendees to "gravitate to
wards what's exciting." He offered
encouragement to students who
are currendy struggling to find a
major by telling them never to give
up hope.
"Do things," Durham said. "Get
involved. Check it out. See how it
goes."
Students left the dinner with
mixed feelings about the night's
events.
Sophomore Tenley Bick called

the dinner "more enjoyable than
t anything else." She has already de
> clared her major and decided
i which of her academic interests to
: pursue.
"It was just nice to talk to facul
t ty members and people that had
t gone here," she said.
Joe Senn, a student interested
i in history, was a little upset that he
> got "stuck" at the feminist studies
table. "I definitely didn't rank it in
I my top three [on the online

form]," he said.
Other students thought the
dinner was just "all right." Marina
Kim called the dinner "kind of
random" but said that she enjoyed
the speakers. Beth McGregor
agreed with Kim and offered her
own insight.
"There was no meat in the ravi
oli or [in] the dinner conversa
tion," McGregor observed. She
came away from the dinner with
"no new life perspectives," al
though she hoped she would have
an "epiphany" during the event.
Some faculty, however, were
less ambivalent about the night
than some of the students were.
Scott Bukatman, assistant profes
sor of art and art history, said he
thought that the dinner was a
great opportunity to meet stu
dents, alumni and other faculty.
"I'm very glad I came," he said.
"I like the idea of catching students
who are on the edge of declaring a
major." He said he also liked being
exposed to Stanford's diverse fac
ulty.
"This is one of the few opportu
nities I have to meet faculty from
other areas," he said.
One of the dinner's coordina
tors, Natalie Siston of the Alumni
Association, called the event a big
success, saying that it allowed 20
percent of the sophomore class to
discuss their academic passions
over dinner.
"It's good to reach out and in
troduce [the students] to faculty
and alumni," she said, adding that
local alumni are "so willing to
come out."
Students left the dinner with a
packet containing the attending
alumni's contact information, vari
ous flyers from University re
sources such as the Undergradu
ate Advising Center and a free
Class of 2005 baseball cap.
