# Senate votes for online input poll
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU heavily considered whether to support
University President John Hennessy's recent declaration
in favor of affirmative action at last night's meeting of the
Undergraduate Senate. The issue carried over from last
week's meeting, and the ultimate decision was to seek
further student input.
At last week's meeting, the Senate discussed whether
to support Hennessy's statement. The proposal led to
heated debate as some senators sought to shy away from
political resolutions, while others argued that the major
ity of the constituency would support such a resolution.
At the outset of last night's discussion, ASSU President
Monica Henestroza, a senior, suggested seeking further
community input.
"It would be best to allow us to have some presence in
The Daily or other media to let everyone know that [the
resolution] will be discussed at next week's meeting,"
Henestroza said. "This would allow people to come or
contact senators for the next meeting so all ideas could
be voiced."
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez, a junior, pro
posed also conducting an online poll, which met with
some resistance.
"I think that this hodgepodge type of survey would
not give us a representative sample," said Senator Hiro
Iwonaga, a senior.
Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves reminded
the senators that, while polling the constituents is im
portant, the responsibility also rests with the senators
themselves.
"Your ultimate responsibility is to decide what is in
the best interest of the student body regardless of what
feedback you get," Graves said.
The Senate voted to conduct an online poll in the
coming week as well as run a guest editorial in The Daily.
In other matters, Rodriguez's proposed Arts Grant
Program was finally approved, with the added require
ment of a faculty advisor to help oversee projects. The
Arts Grant Program was designed to utilize the surplus
in the General Fee Reserves and will fund up to $15,000
in art projects, with each grant
ranging from $300 to $ 1,000.
The Senate also passed a bill
allowing virtual, online meetings
to handle uncontroversial bills.
"The point of online meetings
is to take care of appropriation
matters," Iwonaga said.
Additionally, Marcus
Williams was appointed as
media director of the Elections
Commission, Sunaina Sinha as
special fees director of the Elec
tions Commission, Alida Garcia
as assistant elections commis
sioner and Marvin Gaye's "Sexu
al Healing" was named the Offi
cial Jam of the Fourth Under
graduate Senate.
The Life committee of the
Senate announced the comple

tion of the Stanford Savers pro
gram and also noted its continu
ing efforts to change laundry
fees. The intention is to turn
laundry costs into a block fee per
quarter.
Another proposal was heard
involving the funding of a com
petitive dance team's trip to a
tournament out of the Under
graduate Senate's operating bud
get — currently at $1,045. The
dance team, which asked for
$150, is a branch of Sanskriti, but
is not yet funded by Sanskriti.
Some senators objected to using
Senate operating money to fund
a group — usually the role ol
general fees.
"This is not traditionally what
we spend our funding on," said
senator Brigitte Zimmerman, a
sophomore.
In the end, the bill was reject
ed by a vote of four in favor, five
against and two abstaining.
