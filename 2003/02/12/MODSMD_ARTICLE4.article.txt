# Senate votes for online input poll

### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU heavily considered whether to support
University President John Hennessy's recent declaration
in favor of affirmative action at last night's meeting of the
Undergraduate Senate. The issue carried over from last
week's meeting, and the ultimate decision was to seek
further student input.
At last week's meeting, the Senate discussed whether
to support Hennessy's statement. The proposal led to
heated debate as some senators sought to shy away from
political resolutions, while others argued that the major
ity of the constituency would support such a resolution.
At the outset of last night's discussion, ASSU President
Monica Henestroza, a senior, suggested seeking further
community input.
"It would be best to allow us to have some presence in
The Daily or other media to let everyone know that [the
resolution] will be discussed at next week's meeting,"
Henestroza said. "This would allow people to come or
contact senators for the next meeting so all ideas could
be voiced."
ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez, a junior, pro
posed also conducting an online poll, which met with
some resistance.
"I think that this hodgepodge type of survey would
not give us a representative sample," said Senator Hiro
Iwonaga, a senior.
Associate Dean of Students Morris Graves reminded
the senators that, while polling the constituents is im
portant, the responsibility also rests with the senators
themselves.
"Your ultimate responsibility is to decide what is in
the best interest of the student body regardless of what
feedback you get," Graves said.
The Senate voted to conduct an online poll in the
coming week as well as run a guest editorial in The Daily.
In other matters, Rodriguez's proposed Arts Grant
Program was finally approved, with the added require
ment of a faculty advisor to help oversee projects. The
Arts Grant Program was designed to utilize the surplus
in the General Fee Reserves and will fund up to $15,000
