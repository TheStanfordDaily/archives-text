## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mary Robinson, human rights activist and for
mer president of Ireland, will present this year's
Tanner Lectures on human values. Her first lec
ture, "Human Rights and the Ethics of Globaliza
tion," will be held today at 5:45 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium.
Benjamin Quest of the Program on Ethics in
Society explained the reasoning behind Robin
son's appoint ment.
"Her response has been fairly consistent... on

human rights and gender issues in making sure
they are part of the international dialogue," he
said. "That is why she is a great person to speak for
the Tanner Lectures on human values."
According to the Web site for the lecture series,
"appointment as a Tanner lecturer is a recogni
tion for uncommon achievement and outstanding
abilities in the field of human values."
The Tanner Lectures are co-sponsored by the
President's Office and the Program on Ethics in
Society.
Senior Assistant to the University President Jeff
Wachtel helped to coordinate most aspects of the

event.
"We promote the lectures and set up panels led
by faculty," Wachtel said. "One of the things that's
interesting is that this is a chance for students to
engage in a more academic mode with faculty
knowledgeable in this particular area."
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, one of the discus
sion leaders, explained the need for Robinson's
presence at this time.
"Ms. Robinson's lecture will hopefully serve
as a catalyst for further debate," Rhode said. "As
[Robinson] notes, the events of
9/11 have brought home the
ways in which Americans' lives
are connected to the state of
human rights and democratic
values in other nations. She fo
cuses on issues such as migra
tion, disease and environmental
degradation that require global
solutions and ethical infrastruc
tures in private and govern
mental organizations."
Robinson served as Ireland's
first female president from 1990
to 1997. As president, she advo
cated women's rights, particu
larly in her struggle to liberalize
laws prohibiting divorce and
abortion. She also linked the his
tory of the Great Irish Famine to
contemporary issues with nutri
tion and poverty in developing
nations.
From 1997 to 2002, Robin
son served as United Nations
high commissioner for human
rights. While serving as high
commissioner, she traveled to
Rwanda, South Africa, Colom
bia and Cambodia and bol
stered human rights monitor
ing in Kosovo. In 1998, she also
signed an agreement with
China supporting improve
ments in human rights.
According to sixth-year doc
toral student in political science
Anu Kulkarni, "more than any

single person, she was able to ele
vate the Office of High Commis
sioner on Human Rights as a
kind of focus point for all the dif
ferent human rights groups on a
lot of issues."
Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra
Satz commented that Robinson's
contributions extended to socioe
conomic issues as well.
"She has tried to build a
bridge between developed and
underdeveloped nations of the
world under the umbrella of
human rights violations," Satz
said.
Since her departure from the
UN, Robinson has become the di
rector of the Ethical Globaliza
tion Initiative. She continues to
advocate human rights, especial
ly as they relate to the AIDS/
HIV epidemic.
Terry Karl, human rights ac
tivist and professor of political
science, described Robinson as
"one of the foremost defenders
of human rights in the world.
She has been at the cutting edge
of thinking about how to extend
the notion of rights to protect
victims of abuses. She will criti
cize the governments of the most
powerful nations in the world,
including the United States,
when they abuse rights."
Following the lecture, a semi
nar led by Law Prof. Deborah
Rhode and Political Science Prof.
Susan Okin will be held the next
day in Conference Room A of the
Landau Economics Building at
11:30 a.m.
