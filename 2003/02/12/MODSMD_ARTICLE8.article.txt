# Physics prof's article found plagiarized
## 
### DEVON MAYLIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A vice chancellor at Kumaon University in
India resigned last week after a panel found
him guilty of plagiarizing Stanford physicist
Renata Kallosh's work on theoretical physics.
Vice Chancellor Balwant Singh Rajput, who
was accused of "deliberate and intentional" pla
giarism, continues to maintain his innocence
and said he will appeal the decision of the Indi
an government that he copied his paper.
"It feels good that justice was reestablished,"
said Kallosh, a professor of physics at Stanford
since 1990. "It is important to make this prece
dent known so people know that society
doesn't allow plagiarism."
Last spring, an anonymous person in
formed Kallosh in an e-mail message that Ra
jput had plagiarized her paper nearly verba
tim. This anonymous source told Kallosh that a
student, who co-authored the plagiarized
paper with Rajput, was to receive an interna
tional award for the paper that he had stolen.
Kallosh published "Superpotential of Black
Holes" in the Physical Review in October of
1996, while Rajput published his paper on
black holes in the Europhysics Letter in March
0f2002.
Kallosh decided to ignore the issue when
she received the anonymous tip, but later took
action when the department chair of physics at
Rajput's university was fired. Kallosh said she
believes the chair was fired for investigating Ra
jput's alleged wrongdoing.

"The first thing [Rajput] did in a position of
high power was fire [the person who was] in
vestigating," Kallosh said. "I felt, because of
this, I could not stay away from the issue and
asked friends to help me fight."
The main problem in initiating an investiga
tion was Rajput's powerful position at his uni
versity. Kallosh said she could not start an in
vestigation unless Indian President Bharat
Ratna Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam
was involved.
Calling on the president to investigate the
issue in October, Kallosh drafted a letter, which
was signed by seven Stanford physicists, in
cluding three Nobel laureates.
"A new generation of extremely talented In
dian physicists has won broad international re
spect and brought great recognition to Indian
physics," Kallosh said in her letter. "It would be
a pity if the actions of a few plagiarists should
damage the high international reputation of
Indian science."
Due to security reasons, the letter could not
be delivered. However, with the help of physics
webmaster Stewart Kramer, the letter was
scanned and placed on a Web site made by
leading Indian physicists to document Rajput's
plagiarism.
Kalam responded by organizing a panel
headed by a retired judge of the High Court
and members from the Indian National Sci
ence Academy and the University Grants Com
mission.
After its two-month investigation, the panel
completed a 150-page report which stated that

"a bare comparison of the two works, not from
the viewpoint of a hyper-technical or meticu
lous observer but from the angle of the average
reasonable reader, would reveal complete sim
ilarity, not only in all mathematical equations
and symbols, but also in the [word-by-word]
language used in the two works and the tone,
tenor and manner of expression of ideas."
While Rajput still claims that his student was
at fault, Kallosh strongly believes that Rajput
was aware and took part in the plagiarizing. As
the Web site states, this paper is not an isolated
case but one of many that has been plagiarized
in similar ways by Rajput.
"Things like this happen, but they should
not," Kallosh said. "Especially when people
[like Rajput] have such a high position."
"Plagiarism is more frequent than I think we
realize," said Stephen Shenker, professor of
physics and one of the signers of the letter.
"People are weak and many take advantage of
situations."
Shenker said that plagiarism is a difficult
problem with open dissemination of papers on
the Internet and the decline of refereeing.
"Publicity of scientific misconduct has
shown itself to be effective," he said. "The Web
site by the Indian physicists is an excellent ex
ample."
He also said that a more widely known Web
site would be effective in deterring scientific
misconduct. However, he said, there must also
be a balance between the harm from false accu-
sations and the good obtained from
citing misconduct.
Martin Blume, editor in chief of
the American Physical Society, the
publication that printed Kallosh's
1996 article, agreed that publicity is
vital in deterring scientific miscon
duct. The journal holds workshops
to work with other editors and pub
lishers of scientific journals on how
to respond to scientific misconduct.
He said that the journal discov
ers around three to four cases a
year of plagiarism but last year

found as many as 15 cases of scien
tific misconduct.
When an article is found with
any scientific misconduct, it re
mains on the Internet, but has a red
note signifying that the article has
been retracted. The journal then
rejects any other articles by the au
thor of the article with this "scarlet
letter" and contacts the author's in
stitution.
"We have to rely on institutions
to take further action," Blume said.
"The fact that in this case the head
of die university was the plagiarizer
made the case unique. So Renata
had to mobilize the heavy guns
[Nobel laureates] to sign a letter to
the President of India."

Kallosh said preventing miscon
duct from occurring is important
because it should not be tolerated in
science. However, Michael Peskin,
consultant to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center library and
group leader for theoretical physics
at SLAC, said he worries about the
cost of certain forms of control.
In theoretical physics, all papers
are downloaded onto electronic
networks. This makes it easy to pla
giarize while simultaneously mak
ing detection of plagiarism simpler
once the original paper is identi
fied.
"I am not sure if we would want
to take steps to prevent download
ing papers from the archive," said

Peskin, who also signed the letter.
"The archive allows work to be an
nounced all over the world in real
time."
He said that all papers are de
posited with time stamps that mark
when people submitted their arti
cles.
"I don't see a great danger
here," he said. "The system is self
correcting. You can cheat, but
eventually you will get caught, but
we must be vigilant."
"I didn't believe justice could be
established," Kallosh said. "The
chances were so small, it was such a
big system of corruption. But this
ruling shows that sometimes one
should fight."
