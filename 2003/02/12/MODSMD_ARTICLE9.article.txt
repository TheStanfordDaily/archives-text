# Research journal to expand
## SURJ 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After establishing itself last year as a forum for
undergraduates to publish the results of their schol
arly research, the Stanford Undergraduate Re
search Journal is anticipating a jump in student in
terest this year and has plans to expand the jour
nal's breadth.
SIJRJ is generating greater involvement from
the Stanford academic community, as indicated by
this year's increased number of submissions. After
extending the deadline last year, the journal re
ceived about 50 submissions. This year, the submis
sion deadline is earlier, and the editors are already
expecting to reach that mark before the date ar
rives.
Despite its youth, SURJ has caused a ruffle in the
research community as well, garnering attention
locally in the Bay Area and nationally at universities
all across the United States, its editors said.
"From SURJ, lots of universities have seen that
there's a need for an undergraduate research jour
nal, contacted us and are now following in our foot
steps," said Rachel Siegel, one of two SURJ editors
in chief.
"Last year, we put [SURJ] on the map," said
Grace Wu, editor of the journal's social sciences sec
tion. "This year, there will be a brand-new special
features section."
The features section, which will be added to the
journal's three existing sections — social sciences,
humanities, natural sciences and engineering —
was created this year to showcase stimulating re
search conducted outside of Stanford, including
work done by members outside of the University
community.
"We wanted to expand the reading audience
of the journal," Siegel said. "We're looking for
more general articles that anyone would un-

Stanford
Undergraduate
Research
Journal

demand."
She added, "We're focusing on publicity,
we're recruiting for more submissions, and we
want to have a wider distribution. Hopefully, we
can make the journal look more book-like, too."
SURJ is funded mainly by various Stanford
departments, with sponsors including the vice
provost for undergraduate education, the dean
of students, the Writing Center and individual
professors.
Siegel emphasizes that the journal's editors don't
have specific types of articles in mind. They look for
"fascinating, innovative topics" that would be at
tractive to all Stanford students. "We look for qual
ity of research," Siegel said.
"Clarity is also important," Wu added. "No ex
cessive flourishes."
A submission's readability is an essential re
quirement, as SURJ prides itself in being both a
serious research journal and a student-focused
publication. Its mission statement emphasizes
that it is a "peer-reviewed" academic journal
and its selection process reflects a commitment
to making articles understandable to all of cam
pus.
"The articles can be technical in their material,
but still comprehensible to the regular Stanford stu
dent," Wu said. "The goal is to enlighten students."
There will be approximately three to five articles
chosen for each section. The deadline to submit is
Feb. 21. For more information, visit surj.stan
