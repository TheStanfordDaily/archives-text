## Telemarketers blocked by bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted yesterday
to approve a national "Do-Not-Call" list intended to help
consumers block unwanted telemarketing calls.
The House voted 418-7 to allow the Federal Trade
Commission to collect fees from telemarketers to fund
the registry, which will cost about $16 million in its first
year.
"Most people have experienced it — the annoying
ring of the phone just as dinner goes to the table," said
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee and sponsor of the bill. Tauzin,
R-La., said the bill "will allow hundreds of thousands of
American citizens to enjoy the peace and quiet of their
own home."
Money for the program still needs approval in a
House-Senate compromise on a $397.4 billion spending
package for this year. Lawmakers agreed late yesterday
to retain a deal in the spending plan that would approve
money for the list without the need for additional Senate
approval or other legislation, said Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C.
"We have ensured that this sensible consumer-pro
tection registry will become a reality this year," Hollings
said. He helped develop the agreement that allows the
FTC to begin building the Do-Not-Call program when
the spending bill becomes law.
The registry's future began to appear uncertain late
Monday when Republican leaders sought to change lan
guage in the spending bill to require separate Senate ap
proval, Hollings said. The extra step could have led to
delays jeopardizing funds for the registry this year, he
said.
Hollings and several consumer groups objected to the
changes.
Nick Smith, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said there "is no doubt that Sen. Frist
supports the Do-Not-Call list and hopes that we can com
plete action by the end of the week."
In introducing the legislation, Tauzin said, "If anyone
holds this legislation up, we're prepared to give out their
home phone numbers."
