# D.C. prepares for attack
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Anti-air
craft missiles guarded Washington's
skies and Capitol police carried gas
masks yesterday as the nation mobi
lized to confront a potential terrorist
attack.
Federal, state and local governments
tightened security, anxious Americans
stockpiled food and water, and police
responded to scores of false alarms, in
cluding reports of suspicious vehicles
that shut down commuter bridges in
Washington and New York.
The nation remained under a Code
Orange "high risk" of attack status for
a sixth day, and no change was in
sight. Counter-terrorism officials said
the level of threat information point
ing to an imminent attack remained
high, but steady.
"If given the choice, al-Qaida terror
ists will choose attacks that achieve mul
tiple objectives, striking prominent
landmarks, inflicting mass casualties,
causing economic disruption and rally
ing support through shows of strength,"
CIA Director George Tenet told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
Tenet said he is worried that a new
audio message attributed to terrorist
mastermind Osama bin Laden is a pre
lude to a strike.
"He's obviously raising the confidence
of his people. He's obviously exhorting
them to do more," Tenet said. "What he's
said is often followed by an attack."
Meanwhile, a report surfaced yester
day of a new audio recording by bin
Laden in which the al-Qaida leader
purportedly predicts his own death in
an unspecified act of "martyrdom"
against the United States.
Al-Ansaar, a British-based Islamic
news agency, said it believed the 53-
minute tape, allegedly recorded earlier

this month and acquired from an
unidentified man on the Internet, was a
carefully worded last will and testament
from bin Laden.
U.S. counterterrorism officials said
they were reviewing a transcript of
the tape but could not verify its au
thenticity without hearing the actual
recording.
Fearing the worst, U.S. officials de
ployed Avenger anti-aircraft missiles
and extra radar around Washington
since President Bush's decision Friday
to raise the alert status from yellow to
orange, the second-highest level. The
Air Force has stepped up its combat air
patrols over the capital, defense offi
cials said.
FBI personnel assigned to rapid re
sponse teams that would react to any
terrorist attacks have been told to have
a bag packed for three days' deploy
ment and put on standby.
U.S. Capitol police were told to carry
gas masks at all times. They are in a
small, handheld black knapsack about
six inches long. Every officer has them,
including those in plainclothes who
provide security for leaders and in the
congressional chambers.
The weekly FBI bulletin circulated
to 17,000 law enforcement agencies
urges police to be extra vigilant for pos
sible chemical, biological and radiologi
cal attacks. The bulletin asks local offi
cials to consult a CIA handbook on how
to respond to dangerous substances
should such an attack occur.
In addition, the National Infrastruc
ture Protection Center, which assesses
and warns about threats to critical U.S.
infrastructure, issued an advisory de
scribing a heightened chance of global
computer hacking as tensions increase
with Iraq.
