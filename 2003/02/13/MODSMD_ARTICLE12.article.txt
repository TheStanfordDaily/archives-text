## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Properly evaluating OSPs 
### 
Overseas Studies decided last
week to close its Buenos Aires
and Puebla campuses because
they failed to meet program
standards.
Under its current criteria for deter
mining the success of its programs,
Overseas Studies looks at four factors —
academic content, faculty support, stu
dent interest and feasibility. We feel that
this set of criteria does not take into ac
count the differences between total-im
mersion abroad programs, like Buenos
Aires and Puebla, and those that are
based at a Stanford center, like Berlin
and Santiago.
The Overseas Studies coordinators
should develop a new set of criteria to as
sess the success of total-immersion pro
grams and, thereby, re-establish study
opportunities in Buenos Aires or Puebla.
Assessing the two kinds of programs
by the same four criteria places the total
immersion programs at an inherent dis
advantage.
First, under the academic content cri
terion, total-immersion programs are
more closely scrutinized and are some
times thought not to measure up to
Stanford's academic standards. But we
believe that Stanford should recognize
the inherent value of studying at anoth
er country's university, which cannot be
gained taking classes at a Stanford cen
ter abroad. This aspect of total-immer
sion programs should be-takea inio ac
count as a part of "academic content"
and should trump some of the distrust
Stanford has about the quality or rigor
of the foreign university's academic
program.
Second, we believe that Overseas
Studies should keep in mind that faculty
support for total-immersion programs
will understandably be lower than that
for Stanford center-based programs due
to the limited roles faculty members
have in total-immersion programs. It is
thus unreasonable to require the same
amount of faculty support for total-im
mersion programs and Stanford center
based programs. Faculty support should
be relaxed. However, if faculty support is
to remain an important criterion, op
portunities for faculty members to par
ticipate should be augmented.
Finally, Overseas Studies should
be aware that student interest for total
immersion programs will not necessarily
match that of Stanford-center based pro
grams. Language requirements for stu
dents wanting to study in total-immer

sion programs are higher than those for
students wanting to study in Stanford
center based programs. In addition,
some students hold social and cultural
reservations about enrolling in a total-im
mersion program. But the fact that fewer
students are prepared fora fully inten
sive abroad experience should not be
grounds for limiting the options of those
who are prepared.
All said and done, the fact remains
that student interest and faculty sup
port may never reach the numbers that
the more self-contained Stanford cen
ter-based programs do. But that does
not diminish the experiential value of
the total-immersion programs. Many
students, in fact, laud the value of total
immersion above the more supportive
experience available at the majority of
Stanford centers.
For all students, it is easier to enroll in
a Stanford abroad program because all
credits will count toward their degree
and all financial aid packages are applica
ble. It is also desirable to stay aligned to
the quarter system rather than having to
switch to a semester system. With the clos
ing of Buenos Aires and Puebla, many
students who want to study in a total-im
mersion environment will not study
abroad because the option will not be
available through Stanford.
We suggest that the Buenos Aires and
Puebla programs should be re-evaluated
under a new set One
campus — Santiago—t isn't sufficient to
accomodate the varying interests of
Spanish-speaking students or students
interested in studying Latin America.
While we recognize that Buenos Aires
and Puebla should not be re-opened in
their current forms, we propose that the
programs be revived according to the
new set of criteria.
Through Overseas Studies centers,
several hundred students every quarter
are able to study abroad, yet remain fully
enrolled at Stanford — an opportunity
that helps many students attain a vital
understanding of and empathy toward
institutions, governments, and cultures
foreign to their everyday lives. Over the
years, Overseas Studies has provided
thousands of students with the opportu
nity to "learn first-hand," often consid
ered the most effective learning method.
In order to continue serving Stanford
students well, we encourage Overseas
Studies to maintain its variety of abroad
programs, including total-immersion
options.
