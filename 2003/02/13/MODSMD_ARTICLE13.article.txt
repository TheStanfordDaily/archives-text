## Say what? 
### 
Everybody communicates
— it's our nature. Since
the caveman dudes
grunted their first, uh . . .
grunt, we've been on a never-end
ing quest to say something.
Before we learned how to talk,
we'd cry about being in pain,
being hungry or just needing
more attention. Now that we have
learned how to talk, we still cry
about the same things. But now
we use words.
We all have something to share.
Even me.

What I like
about writing a
column is that I
can openly es
chew fairness and
tell it like I see
it — totally par
tial, totally biased
and totally unfet
tered. My editors

don't tell me, "It's Valentine's Day,
write about love." I can write about
toenail clipping etiquette if I want
to (and possibly will in the future).
It's all about what I want to say.
Living in an age where the idea
of free speech is starting to seem
more like a joke than a constitu
tional right, I must say we are all
lucky to live on a campus where
what we say can and will be heard,
no matter what.
Of course, I'm not the only
guy with a desire to say some
thing. There are my fellow
columnists and writers here at
The Daily and there are numer
ous people writing for publica
tions on campus, all of whom

wish to share something with
someone out in the world. Print is
not the only form of communica
tion; there are other forms as
well. We talk, we e-mail, we in
stant message, we gesture, we do
all sorts of things. Who hasn't
spent hours juggling AIM win
dows when we should be study
ing or sorting through all the e
mails we get from various lists?
Communicating can sometimes
be as simple as smiling to someone
from across the room when your

eyes meet, or it can be as racy as
providing window peep shows for
the people across the courtyard.
I know. A certain girl I know
doesn't always "remember" to
close the blinds when she should.
I guess that's how she commu
nicates.
While I do not partake in exhi
bitionism, I see the point behind it.
Everyone expresses themselves
differently.
But in the end, we all want peo
ple to "get us." We want to be ac
knowledged, and the first step to
wards that is putting ourselves out
there, figuratively and literally.
Now back to me. I'm definitely
putting myself out there with this

column. I do it because I want peo
ple to hear what I want to say. Here
at Stanford, there are thousands of
us who have done great things, but
the spotlight is only so big.
Everyone was the valedictorian
or salutatorian or football-torian of
their high school. Here, we are the
talents of the world reduced to an
other face in the crowd, a 7-digit
II) number.
Writer Cyril Connolly once
said, "Better to write for yourself
and have no public, than to write

for the public and have no self."
I try to strike a balance between
the two.
While I write because I feel like
I have something to say, I also
write because I want to communi
cate with all of you out there. I
hope that some of you will e-mail
me and tell me what you think as
well.
So the next time you see a nud
ist or an exhibitionist or a colum
nist — flash them a smile. But be
careful. They might flash you
something else in return.
