## Declaring a just war? 
### SCOTTY MCLENNAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
President George W. Bush proclaimed
in his State of the Union Address last
month that the United States will "defend
the peace and confound the designs of evil
men," referring to disarming Saddam
Hussein. He assured the American public
that if it comes to war, "We will fight in a
just cause and by just means." Bush ended
the speech by asking for God's guidance.
(He repeated that theme Thursday at the
National Prayer Breakfast in Washington,
seeking guidance through "a testing time
for our country.")
Because the president appeared to be
referencing "just war" criteria that have
been articulated by the Christian Church
for almost 2,000 years, it is important to
look closely at whether they will be met in
a war against Iraq.
Just cause: First of all, is there just
cause? Traditionally this has referred to a
defensive response to grave and certain
harm to the nation. The Bush administra

tion has not made the case that either
Iraq's capacity or intention to use
weapons of mass destruction is likely,
much less certain. There is no more ade
quate evidence of an imminent attack of a
grave nature now than there was five
years ago. There are no proven high-level
Iraqi links to al-Qaida and international
terrorism targeting the United States.
Last resort: Second, are we at the point
where going to war is truly a matter of last
resort? Clearly not. We have containment
and deterrence of a regime that has been
effective for 12 years. Political and military
sanctions can be continued â€” although I
would hope we'd lift the economic embar
go that has been partially responsible fora
doubling of the death rate for small chil
dren in Iraq since 1991, according to
UNICEF. Iraq is militarily surrounded
and contained. There are U.S.-patrolled
no-fly zones. Surveillance and intelli
gence-gathering is at a high pitch. U.N.
weapon inspectors are operating
throughout the country. If we can contin
ue negotiating with a more dangerous

North Korea, why not with Iraq?
Legitimate authority: Third, does
Bush have legitimate authority to act?
The majority of Americans are against the
war without the backing of the United Na
tions, and Vietnam should have taught us
not to prosecute a war without the back
ing of the American people. The Presi
dent claims that last November's U.N. res
olution gives him all the authority needed
fora war against Iraq, but that is not the
way a majority of the Security Council
now see it. To prosecute a war without
U.N. support and without the backing of
the American public would be folly at best
and a disaster at worse.
Probability of success: Fourth, is there a
probability of success? America is strong
militarily, and Iraq is not, so we may well
be able to defeat their armed forces with
in a couple of months. But this criterion
fails when we consider how long we would
have to be tied down in Iraq in order to
win the peace. An art icle by James Fallows
