## Declaring a just war? 
### SCOTTY MCLENNAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
President George W. Bush proclaimed
in his State of the Union Address last
month that the United States will "defend
the peace and confound the designs of evil
men," referring to disarming Saddam
Hussein. He assured the American public
that if it comes to war, "We will fight in a
just cause and by just means." Bush ended
the speech by asking for God's guidance.
(He repeated that theme Thursday at the
National Prayer Breakfast in Washington,
seeking guidance through "a testing time
for our country.")
Because the president appeared to be
referencing "just war" criteria that have
been articulated by the Christian Church
for almost 2,000 years, it is important to
look closely at whether they will be met in
a war against Iraq.
Just cause: First of all, is there just
cause? Traditionally this has referred to a
defensive response to grave and certain
harm to the nation. The Bush administra

tion has not made the case that either
Iraq's capacity or intention to use
weapons of mass destruction is likely,
much less certain. There is no more ade
quate evidence of an imminent attack of a
grave nature now than there was five
years ago. There are no proven high-level
Iraqi links to al-Qaida and international
terrorism targeting the United States.
Last resort: Second, are we at the point
where going to war is truly a matter of last
resort? Clearly not. We have containment
and deterrence of a regime that has been
effective for 12 years. Political and military
sanctions can be continued â€” although I
would hope we'd lift the economic embar
go that has been partially responsible fora
doubling of the death rate for small chil
dren in Iraq since 1991, according to
UNICEF. Iraq is militarily surrounded
and contained. There are U.S.-patrolled
no-fly zones. Surveillance and intelli
gence-gathering is at a high pitch. U.N.
weapon inspectors are operating
throughout the country. If we can contin
ue negotiating with a more dangerous

North Korea, why not with Iraq?
Legitimate authority: Third, does
Bush have legitimate authority to act?
The majority of Americans are against the
war without the backing of the United Na
tions, and Vietnam should have taught us
not to prosecute a war without the back
ing of the American people. The Presi
dent claims that last November's U.N. res
olution gives him all the authority needed
fora war against Iraq, but that is not the
way a majority of the Security Council
now see it. To prosecute a war without
U.N. support and without the backing of
the American public would be folly at best
and a disaster at worse.
Probability of success: Fourth, is there a
probability of success? America is strong
militarily, and Iraq is not, so we may well
be able to defeat their armed forces with
in a couple of months. But this criterion
fails when we consider how long we would
have to be tied down in Iraq in order to
win the peace. An art icle by James Fallows
in the November issue of Atlantic
Monthly estimated Iraq would in
effect have to become our 51st
state, with a huge humanitarian
crisis, need for broad economic re
construction and call for some
50,000 to 75,000 U.S. troops for
many years to restore civil order
under fire and to defend Iraq's
borders. There would be continu
ing casualties, costs would proba
bly run in the hundreds of billions
of dollars, and that would have a
dramatic impact on providing ser
vices to U.S. citizens.
Test of proportionality: Fifth, is
it likely that greater evil will be cre
ated by going to war than by not?
If Iraq does have weapons of mass
destruction, would not this new
war run great risk of triggering the
very use of weapons of mass de
struction that we are so desperate
ly trying to prevent? Moreover, is it
not likely that such a war will infu
riate much of the Muslim world
and solidify them against us?
Certainly a war against Iraq
could stimulate more terrorism

against this country and its citizens
rather than less. The world be
comes more dangerous if the Unit
ed States is seen as an aggressor na
tion engaged in pre-emptive war.
Why should everyone else not
abandon the U.N. charter to pur
sue their own pre- emptive strikes
where they feel at risk, from Kash
mir to North Korea?
And concentrating our re
sources on a war in Iraq could well
mean that al-Qaida and related
terrorist groups, along with coun
tries like North Korea, are em
boldened as we have less resources
and less attention to pay to those
potentially greater threats.
No civilian targets: Sixth and fi
nally, would innocent men, women
and children be spared in a war
against Iraq? The United States has
precision smart bombs, but what if
we end up in door-to-door fighting
in Baghdad? What about civilian
death and suffering based on de
struction of Iraq's infrastructure,
piled on top of civilian death and
suffering under the sanctions and
embargo of the last 12 years? This is
still a devastated country that we
would in effect be finishing off, with
a huge impact on its civilian popu
lation. U.N. estimates are of
500,000 civilian casualties, directly

and indirecdy due to a war, with
some 2 million civilians displaced.
"People of good will may differ
on how to apply just war norms in
particular cases, especially when
events are moving rapidly and the
facts are not altogether clear," as the
U.S. Catholic Bishops recently put
it. Yet, here it appears that none of
the traditional requirements is met
fora war against Iraq, and they all
must be satisfied fora war to be just.
So what are we left with?
Diplomacy, inspections, intelli
gence-gathering, sanctions, con
tainment, international solidari
ty, humanitarian assistance to the
civilian population of Iraq, vigi
lance and patience. Abraham
Lincoln warned us that right
makes might, and not the other
way around.
Basic moral and spiritual values
are the lifeblood of this country,
and without them the American
way of life itself is in grave peril.
We must not go to war with Iraq.
