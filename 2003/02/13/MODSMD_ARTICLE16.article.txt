Parking lot etiquette
In a letter to the editor entitled "West
campus car in an east parking lot: What is
the harm?" (Feb. 12), Morgan Marshall
postulates the idea that the various resi
dent car permit zones should be scrapped
in favor of a campus-wide resident permit.
Marshall claims that there's no harm in a
resident parking in someone else's lot.
So, what is the harm? How about the
fact that residents who actually live in an
adjacent building have nowhere to park,
or, at best, are forced to park at the far end
of their lots? In an ideal world, there'd be
plenty of parking spaces on campus so that
both visitors and residents could park
wherever they wish. The reality, however,
is far from it. There is a severe parking
crunch on campus, particularly in the West
Campus lots around Lyman. Egregious vi
olators routinely take up parking spots that
are specifically designated for residents
simply because they prefer the conve
nience of parking close to the golf course,
tennis courts, or wherever else they might
be going, to the metered or "C" spots which
may be further away. As a result, residents
are either left with no parking or with those

spots furthest from their residence, forcing
them to lug their groceries or luggage hun
dreds of extra feet.
Although I wouldn't support eliminat
ing permit zones, it may be worthwhile to
designate a few spots all over campus as
"all permit parking." However, given that
people consistently violate current park
ing restrictions despite the availability of
metered parking, why should we believe
that providing areas for "all permit" park
ing would change anything? They'll still
park where they consider it most conve
nient.

I was delighted that The Daily took the
time to discuss the pluses and minuses of
the new undergraduate curriculum in po
litical science in the article "PoliSci stu
dents and faculty split on dept. changes"
(Feb. 6). Students who have other ideas
for improvement in our curriculum
should come see me or send them to me.
