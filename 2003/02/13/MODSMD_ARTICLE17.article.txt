# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Preparing for Valentine's Day 
### MIKEY LEE GUEST COLUMNIST 
They say ihat mothers know
best, but mine is the awful combi
nation of advice-giver cheapskate
extraordinaire.
"There's a special on a dozen
long-stemmed roses for $29.99 on
this Web site I found," she says on
the phone. "Don't waste too much
money on Valentine's Day. I know
you like that girl you're dating, but
don't get caught up in the moment."
1 can feel her knowing stare
through the hundreds of miles of
telephone cable.
"I won't, I won't," I reassuring
ly lie. "She's not even expecting
anything."
The advice not only from my
mother. 1 get a lot of advice from
people about what to do for Valen
tine's Day. My friends from the San
Francisco tell me which classy
restaurants are good. The Slanted
Door is awesome, they suggest. Or
they say, take her to the Cheesecake
Factory for elegant fun, or book the
Famalpais Room for two at the Car
nelian Room, which has, arguably,
the most romantic and breathtak
ing views of San Francisco.
My friends who are girls tell me
that even though I don't need to
really do anything big for the big
day, if I get desperate I can go to
the Bookstore and have my pick of
any Ghirardelli or Godiva choco
lates to win her over. Or a card. A
card is really good.
Finally, there are my guy
friends. First of all, these dudes
never get anything right. But even
they have advice for me.
"I think you should take her to a
classy dinner and maybe buy her a
present that's not too expensive but
is still nice." Not bad compared to
what some of them usually come up
with. 1 press them more. "That's
what everyone does," I say. "And
what kind of present fits in that cat
egory? There've gotta be hundreds

of things I could get her that might
or might not be good." As expected,
I get the retreating response: "I
don't know, man. I'm sure you can
think of something good."
Even though I do appreciate
the help, this is the one day 1 plan
for starting every Feb. 15. I go to
the mall and horde stuff from the
75 percent-off sale table for next
year (I inherited some of my
mom's genes, I guess). I have to
stop myself from buying the
chocolate, because in my shopping
delusion, I figure it won't go bad
for at least 364 more days. Espe
cially if I put it in the fridge.
Beyond the chocolate and the
sales and the ridiculously early
planning, it really ends up being
the last week that I have to
scrounge together my plan to be
Ultimate Adorable Guy. I get a few
cute digital pictures of the two of
us printed with a border and hit
up Target fora nice frame, just in
case I decide to do the framed-pic
ture thing. I make the dinner

LUIS FELIPE ADAIME/The Stanford Daily
reservation at her favorite Palo
Alto restaurant. I order roses from
Fiori flower shop at the Stanford
Shopping Center. At $4.50 a pop,
it's not so bad, and the hit from a
dozen is a discounted $50. Hell,
they even deliver for $10 more. I
have tickets for the David Gray
concert and, since I'm a thought
ful guy, silver polish for the neck
lace I gave her for Christmas that's
starting to tarnish.
Now I have all the ingredients to
make this Valentine's Day a lot
more successful than the last one
where I moped around all day
wearing my "I hate Valentine's
Day" shirt with the broken heart on
it. Guitar in hand, alarm set to roll
her out at 7 a.m. and serenade her.
My mom calls again.
"I almost forgot!" she says.
"Costco sells two dozen roses for
$12.99!"
So I cancelled my order from
Fiori. Because when it comes to
getting ready for Valentine's Day,
my mom definitely knows best.
