## Matt muses on mullets & Mo' 
### 
OK. I'm going to spend some time on a
more particular issue in the sports world.
The Avalanche, my friends, is back. I
know that all of you were just as worried
about this as I was, even if you're not from Colorado.
You saw that for the first half of the season a team
lead by Joe "The Pride of Burnaby" Sakic, Peter
"Foppa" Forsberg, and Patrick "I'll rip this closet
door off its hinges in my victory celebration" Roy
was middling, at best. And awful at worst.
The beginning of the season was nothing short of
atrocious — seven games at home before recording
a win. A free fall in the standings to fourth place in

the division — a long way to fall for
a team that isn't even used to seeing
fourth place in the conference.
But now a few things have
changed. They've swapped coach
es, held more closed door meetings
than I can count and probably done
some voodoo-type stuff that I can't
even print in this paper. How else
do you explain two straight wins

against the Red Wings?
Suddenly a team that was in the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Western Conference has put to
gether a 10-game unbeaten streak (eight wins, two
ties) — including a home and home series against
the Evil Red Menace and a head to head showdown
between Roy and Martin Broduer's Devils.
Which really brings me to the bigger theme of
this column - momentum. Good ol' Mr. Mo. You
can hear Dick Vitale warming up in the wings, al
ready talking about "Mr. Mo changing teams,
bayyy-be!" in a few weeks.
You watch sports, and you know what I'm talking
about. It's the feeling you get when you just know
the shots are going fall, the rally is going to stay
alive, that the receiver is going to get both feet in
and keep the drive going.
Of course, as a kid I was spoiled. I grew up watch
ing John Elway lead the Broncos on fourth quarter
drives pretty much every other Sunday. That man
had Mr. Mo on speed dial - it was like a late night
booty call for number seven.
"Uh hey, Mo. What's up, it's John. Yeah, I had a
fantastic time last week too. So what are you up to
tonight? You wanna come over to this sideline,
watch a movie or maybe just, uh, hang out fora bit?
Yeah, I'm at home. Great, I'll see you in a few."
Who knew that was all it took? And just like that,
he had the game.
(OK — so maybe that's not exactly the way it
went, but you get the idea.)
The point is in watching the Avalanche play now,
you see the momentum taking them along, you see
a confidence, ease, and grace to their play. Kind of
like our basketball team had after the trip to 'Zona .
. . before they reverted back to form against Ore
gon.
But they get a chance to get it back again this
week against our other Northwestern foes. The
NCAA committee makes no bones about stressing
the importance of momentum heading into the
tournament, which means it's high time to make a
run and try to snake a high seed.
I'd like to say that I'll be watching, intent on
the outcome and rooting the home team on, but


Matt Babin
I've caught the hockey bug
now. Things have gotten too
hot for me to turn away. It's
mullets, five-minute majors and
cheap, watered-down Canadian
beer for me from now until
Lord Stanley's chalice gets a
new set of names engraved on it
in June.
Why? I don't know, really. I
love the sound of skates, the
crunching of the boards, the
airhorns. I love slapshots from
the point and wristers from be
tween the circles. I love butterfly
saves, gloves dropping for fights,
and the odd man rush.
(And those twins — who
shouldn't be taken off the air just

because football season is over).
I suppose, at some part of it,
it's that hockey players are the
most like "the rest of us." They're
not athletic freaks of nature —
not taller than most doorways or
heavier than a "compact" Hertz
special. They're not all good
looking. In fact, some of them
are downright ugly.
(Exhibit A: Dallas Drake. I had
more midterms this week than
that man has teeth).
Mostly I love watching games
like Monday night against Cal
gary — Forsberg skating
around four defenders, juking
the goalie, and lighting the
lamp.
Welcome to the team, Mr. Mo.

tournament, which means it's high time to make a
run and try to snake a high seed.
I'd like to say that I'll be watching, intent on
the outcome and rooting the home team on, but

I've caught the hockey bug
now. Things have gotten too
hot for me to turn away. It's
mullets, five-minute majors and
cheap, watered-down Canadian
beer for me from now until
Lord Stanley's chalice gets a
new set of names engraved on it
in June.
Why? I don't know, really. I
love the sound of skates, the
crunching of the boards, the
airhorns. I love slapshots from
the point and wristers from be
tween the circles. I love butterfly
saves, gloves dropping for fights,
and the odd man rush.
(And those twins — who
shouldn't be taken off the air just

because football season is over).
I suppose, at some part of it,
it's that hockey players are the
most like "the rest of us." They're
not athletic freaks of nature —
not taller than most doorways or
heavier than a "compact" Hertz
special. They're not all good
looking. In fact, some of them
are downright ugly.
(Exhibit A: Dallas Drake. I had
more midterms this week than
that man has teeth).
Mostly I love watching games
like Monday night against Cal
gary — Forsberg skating
around four defenders, juking
the goalie, and lighting the
lamp.
Welcome to the team, Mr. Mo.
