### EMIL MARTINSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly all the runners on Stanford's
renowned distance squad enjoyed tremen
dous success before arriving on the Farm,
including numerous high school state
championships, Ail-American honors and
records broken.

Track and Field
at Washington Indoor Invitational, Saturday.

But one of the most promising of Stan
ford's stellar distance runners is an athlete
who never claimed a state championship as
a prep, was never named All-American, but
had the drive to join and train with the best
in the nation here on the Farm.
At the Husky Indoor Invitational on
Jan. 31, redshirt freshman Neil Davis con
firmed that he is one of the emerging stars
in collegiate running by posting an auto
matic qualifying time for the NCAA Indoor
National Championships of 13 minutes,
57.10 seconds over 5,000 meters. His time
currently ranks as the fourth fastest among
all collegians this year and eleventh in the
world.
"I felt I had the ability to run with the
top collegians," Davis said. "But I didn't
think it would happen in my freshman
year. I set my expectations on my junior or
senior year."
Davis hails from Bellermine Prep in San
Jose where he claimed fourth in the Cali
fornia state cross country meet his senior
year and seventh in the state 3200 meter
championship during track.
"My college choice came down to
Princeton or Stanford," Davis said. "With
the weather, the tradition; there isn't a bet
ter combination of academics and athletics
than here at Stanford."
Davis decided to redshirt his first year at
Stanford, allowing him to build a strong
mileage base without worrying about the
pressure of performing in races for the
Cardinal.
But during his redshirt year, Davis built
racing experience by entering meets as an

individual. The strength he gained from
training during the year culminated in an
eighth place showing in the 10,000 at the
Junior National Championships last June.
Once in a Stanford uniform this fall,
Davis competed on Stanford's varsity
squad all cross-country season, finishing
seventh at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships and placing eighth at the
West Regional Championships. As a result,
Davis was named the Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year.
"I think I surprised a lot of people,"
Davis said of his successful cross country
season. "It's an amazing feeling running on
this team, the national champions and with
the incredible athletes here."
"Neil had good success in high school
and has made the transition to our pro
gram well," said Vin Lananna, director of
cross country and track and field. "He real
ly improved his racing and training during
cross country."
Davis has had many people to look up to
at Stanford. From his coaches and his team
mates, he has gained experiences and
friendships to help boost his running.
"Adam Tenforde and Justin Romaniuk
have been big influences on me," Davis
said. "Adam always gives me positive en
couragement and training tips and advice.
Justin is my closest friend here, the guy I
spend the most time with."
Davis will be joining the squad at the
Washington Indoor Invitational this Satur
day, where he hopes to post a fast time in
the 3,000 to go with his spectacular 5,000
finish.
During the outdoor season, Davis hopes
to get under the automatic qualify ing time
of 29:00 for the 10,000 early so that he can
try other events like the 5,000 and 1,500.
"I might run at the [Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation] Championships next
week and then at indoor nationals," Davis
said. "But I am primarily focused on reach
ing a qualifying time in the 10,000 during
outdoor."
This weekend, the No. 4 men's and No.
6 women's teams will be looking for quali
fying marks for the Indoor National Cham
pionships and the MPSF Championships.

have yet to set a qualifying mark
this season. The emerging
women's sprint group, now boast
ing two nationally ranked athletes,
is also expected to post solid times.
Three freshmen, Brett Gotch
er, Rolf Steier and Peter Meindl,
will be competing in what could
be the most exciting and talented
field in 20 years at the Junior Na
tional Cross Country Champi
onships. The top six individuals
have the opportunity to race on
the U.S. team at the World Cham
pionships in March. All three Car
dinal runners are expected to
contend fora spot on the national
squad.
"The team here is just amaz

ing," Davis said. "There are so
many great people to push you.
We aren't competitive in practice,
though. We work together."
Despite his quick rise to suc
cess, Davis is humble and selfless
about his running and role on the
squad.
"I really would like to be a
leader on this team someday,"
Davis said. "Beyond that, maybe
an NCAA champion at the 10,000
in track, but I really haven't
thought that far. Just running
good times does not make me a
leader. Leadership comes with
age and experience."
And while he has come a long
way from high school, there is no
doubt that Davis will continue to
improve and mature into a leader
on the team as long as he contin
ues to live by his belief: "Everyone
just has to prove himself."
