# Gymnastics prepares to vault over Golden Bears
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is an easygoing familiarity be
tween the Stanford (1-0, 1-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) and Califor
nia (0-1, 0-1 MPSF) men's gymnastics
squads. In fact, it's not uncommon to
see the rivals out on the town together
long after a meet is over.
But don't be fooled by the cama
raderie — in competition, it's still
Stanford versus the Weenies.

"We really like hanging out with
those guys,"senior Marshall Erwin said.
"But at the same time, it was great to
beat them at the last meet. We appreci
ate the rivalry because it is nice to beat
them."
In the last decade, this piece of the
greater Stanford-Cal rivalry intensified
as both gymnastics teams developed
into national powerhouses. During this

period, the squads won five NCAA
team tides — three for the Cardinal
and two for the Golden Bears.
Last year, both teams made it to the
final day of the National Champi
onships, garnering three of the six
NCAA event champions and seven All-
America honors.
Now another chapter in the rivalry
begins as the Cardinal travels across the
bay on Friday, the second meeting of
five between the two teams this season.
The Golden Bears saw their three

year winning streak against the Cardi
nal snap at the Cardinal Open in Janu
ary, where Stanford surprised a veter
an Cal team by taking five of the six
event titles and winning the meet by
three tenths of a point. As a result, Stan
ford received its highest ranking in six
years.
But the Cardinal expects a better
prepared Cal squad this time around.
"Cal was not too happy about their
finish at the Cardinal Open,"
coach Thom Glielmi said. "I'm
sure they'll have their guns tlar
ing."
Since the victory, Stanford has
focused on adding difficulty to
routines. The team plans on con
tinuously increasing start values in
order to peak at the NCAA Cham
pionships.
"Even the guys that compet
ed at the [Winter Cup Nation
als last week] are trying to up
grade their routines," Glielmi
said. "It is important that we
make a good showing, but
we're still keeping our eye on
the prize."
As the nation's smallest roster
with only 10 athletes, the Cardinal
did not enter a full lineup on vault
and high bar at the Cardinal
Open. The team's lack of depth
will become more apparent with
junior Dan Gill's likely absence on

the rings and high bar due to a
wrist infection.
"The doctors said that there is
no risk of further injury, but he'll
heal faster if he doesn't wear his
grips," said Glielmi. "It'll definite
ly affect our team score because
he's one ofour top scorers on rings
and high bar."
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its domination on the pom
mel horse, where it beat Cal by al
most three points last meet. On
the other hand, the team will look
to improve its performance on the
parallel bars, where the squad
went one-for-six, losing to the
Bears by almost two points on the
event.
Glielmi, in his second year at
Stanford, witnessed the rivalry for
the first time last season.
"We've never been too well-re
ceived by the fans at Cal, as any
Stanford team will attest to," Gliel
mi said. "But I always enjoy mak
ing myself at home at someone
else's house.
"Though Cal is one house I'd
prefer not staying in too long."
