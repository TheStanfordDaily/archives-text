Rookie, (noun): 1. An untrained or in
experienced recruit. 2. An inexperienced
person; a novice.
Daniel Webster might have rethought
this definition if he had met Cardinal rook
ies Natalie Foley, Jessica Louie, and Glyn
Sweets. This trio of freshmen is anything
but green behind the ears, proving invalu
able to the No. 8 Stanford women's gym
nastics team (7-1-1, 3-0-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference).

Women's Gymnastics
at Washington, Friday.

"Natalie, Glyn, and Jessica have made
an immediate impact on our team," coach
Kristen Smyth said. "They are so unique
with respect to their gymnastics and per
sonalities."
After losing three athletes to graduation
and senior Abby Gair, now the undergrad
uate assistant coach while on medical red
shirt, from last year's lineup, Smyth was
looking fora recruiting class ready to fill a
big void.
"Lack of power was one of our weak
nesses last year," Smyth said. "On floor and
vault especially, the freshmen add that
extra element we need. Plus, Natalie and
Glyn have world-class routines on bars."
Foley, Louie, and Sweets had superla
tive club careers before their arrival on the
Farm. Foley was a member of the U.S.
world championship team. Louie placed

third on the vaulting table and second on
the floor exercise at the 2001 Level-10 na
tionals. Sweets was the 2002 Level-10 Ju
nior Olympic National Champion.
While competition is no stranger to this
freshman class, the collegiate schedule and
being part of a team is a new experience.
"Having a team means more support,"
Louie said. "It's great to have an external
source of motivation, which you don't have
in club competition."
"Competing in college is so much more
fun," Foley echoed. "The team truly cares
about your performance and you are push
ing yourself to contribute to a greater pur
pose."
But with that support comes an extra
burden.
"I feel a bit more pressure to perform
well in college," Sweets said. "When you
have just as much invested in your team
mates as you do in yourself, you always
want to hit."
Pressure doesn't seem to daunt these
newbies one bit. Foley has chalked up four
event titles this season and took first in the
all-around against top-ranked UCLA. Her
first-place finish on floor that evening was
the envy of the Bruins, who could not beat
her 9.95. She and junior Lise Leveille com
pete in the all-around for the Cardinal,
packing a powerful one-two punch.
They will be aided in their efforts by
Sweets, who is gearing up to join the all
around lineup by adding a floor routine to
her repertoire. Sweets won the vaulting
