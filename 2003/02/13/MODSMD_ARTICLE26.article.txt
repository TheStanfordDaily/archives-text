# Bad blood boils tonight at Maples

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
A weekend at home against the bot
tom-dwelling Washington schools is gen
erally regarded as a schedule break of
sorts for Pacific-10 Conference men's bas
ketball teams. But for No. 24 Stanford
(17-6, 8-3 Pac-10), this weekend's games
are unusually meaningful.

a
vs. Washington tonight, 7 p.m.
vs. Washington State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

On its January road trip to the Apple
State, the Cardinal needed overtime to
put away the Cougars (5-15, 0-11) and
was upset by a tenacious and talkative
Huskies squad (8-12, 3-8). That didn't sit
too well with Stanford.
"If there's any team in the Pac-10 that
I dislike the most, it's Washington,"
sophomore swingman Josh Childress
said. "They talk a lot of trash. They talk
like they're a top-notch team."

The Huskies used their speed and ath
leticism to draw the Cardinal into foul
trouble and force turnovers. Stanford
couldn't quite keep up as senior guard
Julius Barnes and junior guard Matt Lot
tich spent much of the second half on the
bench and junior forward Justin Davis sat
out due to injury.
Meanwhile, Washington guards Will
Conroy and Nate Robinson torched the
Cardinal for 32 points on 11-for-16
shooting.
"[Robinson] might be their best play
er," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "He's come in [as a freshman] and
done a fantastic job. He's full of confi
dence and he's very athletic."
Stanford itself has been buoyed by
great guard play lately, but its post play
has suffered. Center Rob Little has scored
just 13 points in the last three games.
"The last couple games, our guards
have taken the bulk of the shots, and
there's been an emphasis [in practice] on
getting the ball inside," Lottich said.
Added junior center Joe Kirchofer:

"It's not that we're playing badly, just that
there's been an imbalance."
The Huskies' backcourt of Conroy and
Robinson and the Cougars' outstanding
shooting guard Marcus Moore will com
mand a lot of attention and energy on the
defensive end from Barnes and Lottich.
And, neither the Huskies nor the Cougars
are particularly strong in the post, so Stan
ford hopes to exploit its size inside and
take some heat off of its guards.
Doug Wrenn, Washington's best big
man, averaged 19.5 points per game last
season, but this year has been a disappoint
ment, seeing his average fall to 12.8. His
lack of production has been filled by Con
roy, who leads the team with 13.3 points
per game and shoots 45.1 percent from 3-
point range, and Robinson, who chips in
12.2 points per game.
Moore, a 6-6 junior, leads the
perimeter-oriented Cougars in points
(19.3 per game), rebounds (5.9) and as
sists (4.5). The only other Cougar aver
aging double digits is quasi-point guard
Thomas Kelati, a 3-point specialist, at
10.8 ppg. Washington State launches
39.3 percent of its shots from behind
the arc.
The Cardinal isn't overlooking Wash
ington State, despite its winless confer
ence record. The Cougars held a 14-
point halftime lead in the squads' first
meeting before the Cardinal took off on
an 18-0 second-half run. The Cougars
were devastated by the loss, but Stanford
remains a little wary.
"[The team is] aware that both these
teams are capable of beating us," Mont
gomery said.
Added Lottich: "Both these teams
gave us a tough go up there ... I guess
this is a little bit of payback for us."
Despite having an ax to grind with its
foes this weekend, Stanford is glad to be
home after two weeks on the road.
"Two road trips in a row wears on
you," Kirchofer said. "It's nice to be back
home and calm down a little."
During its two weeks on the road,
Stanford won three out of four, including
an upset of top-ranked Arizona, losing
only to Oregon.
"We were pretty happy," Childress
said. "Obviously you want to capitalize in
that Oregon game, but we played hard,
worked hard, and that's all you can ask
for."
The Cardinal will take on the Huskies
tonight at 7 p.m. and the Cougars at 2
p.m. Saturday.

Sophomore forward Josh Childress is averaging eight rebounds per game to lead the No.
24 Cardinal, and admits to harboring more than a little dislike for Washington.
