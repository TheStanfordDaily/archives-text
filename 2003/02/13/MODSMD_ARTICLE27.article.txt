# Sophomore has stepped up to help the Cardinal

There he sits, just at the foot of con
crete stairs, thinking not of filling shoes
or lofty goals, but of today's ensuing prac
tice.
And as simple as that task might seem,
it's taken Rob Little a while to get to the
place that he's at now mentally — no
longer worried about successful Stanford
centers of the past and his eventual-place
in that legacy.
The Cardinal coaching staff worked
hard to lift the burden off his shoulders

early. Even before Curtis Borchardt's
early departure for the NBA was final
ized, Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery sat the 6-foot-10 center down
and told him that he didn't have to be
Borchardt.
It was an obvious statement that
meant a lot to the then-freshman from
Hampton, Va., who has been thrust into
the starting lineup much sooner than
anyone ever expected.

With the early departure of Curtis Borchardt to the NBA, Rob Little has had some big shoes
to fill. The sophomore has transformed himself from just a big body in the middle to emerg

the feel for playing in the [Pacific
10 Conference] and being a domi
nant player," Little said. "He
doesn't expect anyone to go out
there and score 30 points a game.
He just wants you to go out there
and play within yourself. He
doesn't ask anyone on the team to
do anything that they can't do."
Since Montgomery's big talk
with Little, he has averaged nine
points and six rebounds per game.
He's third in the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage, shooting 59 per
cent from the floor, and he's
scored double figures in 11 games
this season. Furthermore, he's
given Stanford an inside presence
that many feared the Cardinal
wouldn't have in the absence of
Borchardt.
From an offensive standpoint,
he's proven to be a very capable
and consistent scoring threat on
the inside. In November, he put
up a season-high 18 points to lead
Stanford in an upset over then-No.
7 Florida. And against No. 1 Ari
zona, he scored 13 points on 6-for
-10 shooting from the floor. More
over, he's a decent passer for his
size. Little and fellow sophomore
Josh Childress have nearly perfect
ed the alley-oop.
But, more importantly, it's the

little things that Little is doing
which make him a productive
member of this team. It's the
charges he takes and rebounds he
grabs that have contributed to the
surprising success that the Cardi
nal is having this season.
"The big guy moves over and
tries to take charges, and he's had
an awful lot of close [calls]," Mont
gomery said. "He probably leads
the team in charges taken and at
the same time probably leads the
team in not getting the call. Fora
guy to give up his body like that,
that's what you ask kids to do."
Adjusting to increased playing
time and a more significant role on
the floor can be a difficult transi
tion. It's been a common theme for
Cardinal players this season — not
only stepping into the spotlight,
but learning how to deal with the
glare.
And for Little, the season
hasn't been without its frustra
tions — the minutes spent on the
bench in foul trouble, the nights
when the jump-hook just doesn't
seem to fall and, from a team per
spective, the games in which it
has looked as if the Cardinal
wasn't all there mentally. Natu
rally, there have been times when
his frustrations have been more
visible than others — a sporadic
yell here or there when a call
doesn't go his way or an inadver
tent foul at an inopportune time.
Despite a strong showing at

Arizona, Little has struggled of
fensively as of late. In the last
three road games he's averaging
only four points in part because
of limited playing time due to
foul trouble.
"Some people are trying to take
away his jump hook a little bit,"
Montgomery explained. "Every
body does that. We do the same
thing when we find people who
have a favorite move we'll tell them
not to let them turn a certain way.
He's just a young player, suffering
the ups and downs of a season."
"I just think that as of late I've
hit a bump in the road," Little
added. "I've never been in this sit
uation before. But to be successful
I have to find a way to get back to
doing the little things that I was
doing before. The season's long
and Pac-lOs are tough. I think that
what I'm going through now is all
a part of me maturing and becom
ing a better player."
In spite of all the recent frustra
tions, there are also images of a
more light-hearted Little — of a
player quick to jump up and cheer
for his teammates from the side
lines, or raise his arms in an effort
to get the crowd involved. And it is
these images — of a player who is
truly looking to improve and
happy about his team's success —
that make all of the frustrating
times that much more bearable
and arguably even that much
more fulfilling.

In spite of all the recent frustra

more light-hearted Little — of a
player quick to jump up and cheer
for his teammates from the side
lines, or raise his arms in an effort
to get the crowd involved. And it is
these images — of a player who is

that make all of the frustrating

There he sits, just at the foot of con
crete stairs, thinking not of filling shoes
or lofty goals, but of today's ensuing prac
tice.
And as simple as that task might seem,
it's taken Rob Little a while to get to the
place that he's at now mentally — no
longer worried about successful Stanford
centers of the past and his eventual-place
in that legacy.
The Cardinal coaching staff worked
hard to lift the burden off his shoulders

early. Even before Curtis Borchardt's
early departure for the NBA was final
ized, Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery sat the 6-foot-10 center down
and told him that he didn't have to be
Borchardt.
It was an obvious statement that
meant a lot to the then-freshman from
Hampton, Va., who has been thrust into
the starting lineup much sooner than
anyone ever expected.
"Coach is a big believer [in the idea]
that it takes guys a year or two to really get

With the early departure of Curtis Borchardt to the NBA, Rob Little has had some big shoes
to fill. The sophomore has transformed himself from just a big body in the middle to emerg
ing as possibly the Pac-10's best true center.
the feel for playing in the [Pacific
10 Conference] and being a domi
nant player," Little said. "He
doesn't expect anyone to go out
there and score 30 points a game.
He just wants you to go out there
and play within yourself. He
doesn't ask anyone on the team to
do anything that they can't do."
Since Montgomery's big talk
with Little, he has averaged nine
points and six rebounds per game.
He's third in the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage, shooting 59 per
cent from the floor, and he's
scored double figures in 11 games
this season. Furthermore, he's
given Stanford an inside presence
that many feared the Cardinal
wouldn't have in the absence of
Borchardt.
From an offensive standpoint,
he's proven to be a very capable
and consistent scoring threat on
the inside. In November, he put
up a season-high 18 points to lead
Stanford in an upset over then-No.
7 Florida. And against No. 1 Ari
zona, he scored 13 points on 6-for
-10 shooting from the floor. More
over, he's a decent passer for his
size. Little and fellow sophomore
Josh Childress have nearly perfect
ed the alley-oop.
But, more importantly, it's the

little things that Little is doing
which make him a productive
member of this team. It's the
charges he takes and rebounds he
grabs that have contributed to the
surprising success that the Cardi
nal is having this season.
"The big guy moves over and
tries to take charges, and he's had
an awful lot of close [calls]," Mont
gomery said. "He probably leads
the team in charges taken and at
the same time probably leads the
team in not getting the call. Fora
guy to give up his body like that,
that's what you ask kids to do."
Adjusting to increased playing
time and a more significant role on
the floor can be a difficult transi
tion. It's been a common theme for
Cardinal players this season — not
only stepping into the spotlight,
but learning how to deal with the
glare.
And for Little, the season
hasn't been without its frustra
tions — the minutes spent on the
bench in foul trouble, the nights
when the jump-hook just doesn't
seem to fall and, from a team per
spective, the games in which it
has looked as if the Cardinal
wasn't all there mentally. Natu
rally, there have been times when
his frustrations have been more
visible than others — a sporadic
yell here or there when a call
doesn't go his way or an inadver
tent foul at an inopportune time.
Despite a strong showing at

Arizona, Little has struggled of
fensively as of late. In the last
three road games he's averaging
only four points in part because
of limited playing time due to
foul trouble.
