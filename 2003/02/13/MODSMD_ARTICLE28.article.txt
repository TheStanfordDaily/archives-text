# Reflections on Stanford women's basketball
## Positive progress 
### MAISY SAMUELSON 
After the women's bas
ketball team disman
tled Oregon State on
Saturday, hundreds
of young fans lined up to ask
Stanford players for auto
graphs. Every time I tried to
get a player's thoughts on Title
IX, I was interrupted by ad
miring young (mostly female)
fans seeking autographs. I
could not help but smile to my
self and think, "This is what
Title IX is all about."
Given the 4,371 fans that
flocked to see the game on Sat
urday, it is hard to believe that
just 25 years ago the women's
basketball team played in
Roble Gym, received no athlet
ic scholarships and taped its
own ankles.
Mariah Burton Nelson, a
Stanford player from 1975 to
1979, chronicled her experi
ence playing basketball at Stan
ford in an essay entitled "Es
cape from Roble: Cardinal
Women's Basketball Then and
Now."
"My first two years at Stan
ford, our basketball coach was
a kind, devoted, unpaid gradu
ate student named Gay
Coburn," Burton wrote. "Our
seasons consisted of 11, then 13

games. For uniforms, we wore
white T-shirts (draped with
dreaded red pennies for away
games) and red shorts. For
warm-ups, we wore hooded
red Stanford sweatshirts we
bought with our own money in
the bookstore. We bought our
own high-tops and taped our
own ankles. We played and
practiced in Robleâ€”which, as I
recall, is so claustrophobic that
our 20 or so fans sat on a single
bench between the sideline and
the wall."
Burton and her teammates
hounded the Athletics Depart
ment to comply with Title IXa,
the recent statute prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of
sex in educational institutions.
Their efforts paid off and by
Burton's junior year the team
moved permanently into
Maples, received uniforms and
a coach and had access to a
trainer and weight room.
By the time head coach Tara
VanDerveer arrived in 1985,
more opportunities had not yet
translated into more spectator
support or success. In the two
years prior to VanDerveer's ar
rival, the Cardinal went 5-23
and 9-18 and was lucky if 50
people showed up to watch.
