# Reflections on Stanford women's basketball
## Positive progress 
### MAISY SAMUELSON 
After the women's bas
ketball team disman
tled Oregon State on
Saturday, hundreds
of young fans lined up to ask
Stanford players for auto
graphs. Every time I tried to
get a player's thoughts on Title
IX, I was interrupted by ad
miring young (mostly female)
fans seeking autographs. I
could not help but smile to my
self and think, "This is what
Title IX is all about."
Given the 4,371 fans that
flocked to see the game on Sat
urday, it is hard to believe that
just 25 years ago the women's
basketball team played in
Roble Gym, received no athlet
ic scholarships and taped its
own ankles.
Mariah Burton Nelson, a
Stanford player from 1975 to
1979, chronicled her experi
ence playing basketball at Stan
ford in an essay entitled "Es
cape from Roble: Cardinal
Women's Basketball Then and
Now."
"My first two years at Stan
ford, our basketball coach was
a kind, devoted, unpaid gradu
ate student named Gay
Coburn," Burton wrote. "Our
seasons consisted of 11, then 13

games. For uniforms, we wore
white T-shirts (draped with
dreaded red pennies for away
games) and red shorts. For
warm-ups, we wore hooded
red Stanford sweatshirts we
bought with our own money in
the bookstore. We bought our
own high-tops and taped our
own ankles. We played and
practiced in Roble—which, as I
recall, is so claustrophobic that
our 20 or so fans sat on a single
bench between the sideline and
the wall."
Burton and her teammates
hounded the Athletics Depart
ment to comply with Title IXa,
the recent statute prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of
sex in educational institutions.
Their efforts paid off and by
Burton's junior year the team
moved permanently into
Maples, received uniforms and
a coach and had access to a
trainer and weight room.
By the time head coach Tara
VanDerveer arrived in 1985,
more opportunities had not yet
translated into more spectator
support or success. In the two
years prior to VanDerveer's ar
rival, the Cardinal went 5-23
and 9-18 and was lucky if 50
people showed up to watch.
VanDerveer left a proven
Ohio State program to try to
build something out of nothing at
Stanford. VanDerveer's father
and Tennessee coach Pat Summit
both tried to talk her out of taking
the job.
"When I left Ohio State, the
idea was that Stanford was a
graveyard job," VanDerveer told
reporter Dave Newhouse. "My
dad told me, 'Don't take it. You'll
be unemployed. It's Mission: Im
possible.' "
One of the reasons, Van-
Derveer chose to come to Stan
ford was its reputation as a school

that supported women's athlet
ics.
"Stanford was one of the lead
ers in supporting women's
sports," VanDerveer said. "It was
really exciting to be at a place
where it felt like there was respect
for women's sports."
Since arriving at Stanford,
VanDerveer has compiled a 415-
107 record, been named Coach of
the Year three times and won two
NCAA Championships. The
women's basketball team now
draws an average of 3,715 fans.
The Connecticut story is simi
lar. When Geno Auriemma ar
rived at UConn before the 1985-
86 season, the Huskies played in
the campus field house, shared a
communal locker room and drew
around 50 fans a night, most of

whom were relatives and friends.
Now the Huskies travel by
charter airplane and always sell
out home games at on-campus
Gampel Pavilion (10,027 capaci
ty) and the Hartford Civic Center
(16,294). UConn's public televi
sion ratings spike as high as 17
points, representing 10,000
households for every point. Ten
newspapers cover the team and
each game is broadcast on either
public or national television.
In the last 30 years, interest in
women's basketball as a whole has
soared with the level of play. For
18 straight years, Women's
NCAA basketball attendance has
grown, topping the 9 million
mark for the first time in history
during last season.
One year ago, the Women's

Final Four shattered all atten
dance records by drawing back
to-back sellout crowds of 29,619
for the semifinals and final.
Last week, an average of
1,226,000 households watched
the match-up between Duke and
Connecticut on ESPN2. The tele
cast was ESPN2's third most
watched college basketball game
ever, including postseason and
men's action. In Hartford,
Conn., almost 25 percent of tele
vision households tuned into the
contest.
"This Title IX [committee] dri
ves me nuts," Auriemma told re
porters after the game. "Hopeful
ly, people are watching and say,
'Why would you want to mess with
anything that can be this good?'"

The numbers point to one
conclusion: given the opportuni
ty, women are capable of putting
on a performance that fans are
willing to pay to watch.
At the recreational level, the
numbers reveal another, equally
important conclusion. Given the
opportunity, women are just as
interested in athletic competition
as men.
Growing up, VanDerveer did
not have the opportunity to play
a varsity sport in high school be
cause her school only offered in
tramural sports for girls. She
played intramural field hockey
and tennis because basketball
wasn't even offered. The justifica
tion then was that girls were not
as interested in playing sports as

men.
"I grew up loving to play bas
ketball but there were no oppor
tunities," VanDerveer said. "Title
IX has shaped my life and I have
been grateful for the opportuni
ty. I don't think it would have
happened without Title IX."
When Title IX was approved
in 1972, only 1 in 27 high school
girls played a sport. By 2000, one
in three competed at the high
school level. Many of these ath
letes came to Saturday's Stanford
win together. Now, not only do
they have the opportunity to
compete, but they have role mod
els to look up to.

Now the Huskies travel by
charter airplane and always sell
out home games at on-campus
Gampel Pavilion (10,027 capaci
ty) and the Hartford Civic Center
(16,294). UConn's public televi
sion ratings spike as high as 17
points, representing 10,000
households for every point. Ten
newspapers cover the team and
each game is broadcast on either
public or national television.
In the last 30 years, interest in
women's basketball as a whole has
soared with the level of play. For
18 straight years, Women's
NCAA basketball attendance has
grown, topping the 9 million
mark for the first time in history
during last season.
One year ago, the Women's

Final Four shattered all atten
dance records by drawing back
to-back sellout crowds of 29,619
for the semifinals and final.
Last week, an average of
1,226,000 households watched
the match-up between Duke and
Connecticut on ESPN2. The tele
cast was ESPN2's third most
watched college basketball game
ever, including postseason and
men's action. In Hartford,
Conn., almost 25 percent of tele
vision households tuned into the
contest.
"This Title IX [committee] dri
ves me nuts," Auriemma told re
porters after the game. "Hopeful
ly, people are watching and say,
'Why would you want to mess with
anything that can be this good?'"

The numbers point to one
conclusion: given the opportuni
ty, women are capable of putting
on a performance that fans are
willing to pay to watch.
At the recreational level, the
numbers reveal another, equally
important conclusion. Given the
opportunity, women are just as
interested in athletic competition
as men.
Growing up, VanDerveer did
not have the opportunity to play
a varsity sport in high school be
cause her school only offered in
tramural sports for girls. She
played intramural field hockey
and tennis because basketball
wasn't even offered. The justifica
tion then was that girls were not
as interested in playing sports as

men.
"I grew up loving to play bas
ketball but there were no oppor
tunities," VanDerveer said. "Title
IX has shaped my life and I have
been grateful for the opportuni
ty. I don't think it would have
happened without Title IX."
When Title IX was approved
in 1972, only 1 in 27 high school
girls played a sport. By 2000, one
in three competed at the high
school level. Many of these ath
letes came to Saturday's Stanford
win together. Now, not only do
they have the opportunity to
compete, but they have role mod
els to look up to.

The Stanford Daily
Ifs hard to imagine that in just 13 years Stanford women's basketball moved from wearing T-shirts in Roble Gym to
the winning the 1990 National Championship.
After the women's bas
ketball team disman
tled Oregon State on
Saturday, hundreds
of young fans lined up to ask
Stanford players for auto
graphs. Every time I tried to
get a player's thoughts on Title
IX, I was interrupted by ad
miring young (mostly female)
fans seeking autographs. I
could not help but smile to my
self and think, "This is what
Title IX is all about."
Given the 4,371 fans that
flocked to see the game on Sat
urday, it is hard to believe that
just 25 years ago the women's
basketball team played in
Roble Gym, received no athlet
ic scholarships and taped its
own ankles.
Mariah Burton Nelson, a
Stanford player from 1975 to
1979, chronicled her experi
ence playing basketball at Stan
ford in an essay entitled "Es
cape from Roble: Cardinal
Women's Basketball Then and
Now."
"My first two years at Stan
ford, our basketball coach was
a kind, devoted, unpaid gradu
ate student named Gay
Coburn," Burton wrote. "Our
seasons consisted of 11, then 13

games. For uniforms, we wore
white T-shirts (draped with
dreaded red pennies for away
games) and red shorts. For
warm-ups, we wore hooded
red Stanford sweatshirts we
bought with our own money in
the bookstore. We bought our
own high-tops and taped our
own ankles. We played and
practiced in Roble—which, as I
recall, is so claustrophobic that
our 20 or so fans sat on a single
bench between the sideline and
the wall."
Burton and her teammates
hounded the Athletics Depart
ment to comply with Title IXa,
the recent statute prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of
sex in educational institutions.
Their efforts paid off and by
Burton's junior year the team
moved permanently into
Maples, received uniforms and
a coach and had access to a
trainer and weight room.
By the time head coach Tara
VanDerveer arrived in 1985,
more opportunities had not yet
translated into more spectator
support or success. In the two
years prior to VanDerveer's ar
rival, the Cardinal went 5-23
and 9-18 and was lucky if 50
people showed up to watch.
VanDerveer left a proven
Ohio State program to try to
build something out of nothing at
Stanford. VanDerveer's father
and Tennessee coach Pat Summit
both tried to talk her out of taking
the job.
"When I left Ohio State, the
idea was that Stanford was a
graveyard job," VanDerveer told
reporter Dave Newhouse. "My
dad told me, 'Don't take it. You'll
be unemployed. It's Mission: Im
possible.' "
One of the reasons, Van-
Derveer chose to come to Stan
ford was its reputation as a school

that supported women's athlet
ics.
"Stanford was one of the lead
ers in supporting women's
sports," VanDerveer said. "It was
really exciting to be at a place
where it felt like there was respect
for women's sports."
Since arriving at Stanford,
VanDerveer has compiled a 415-
107 record, been named Coach of
the Year three times and won two
NCAA Championships. The
women's basketball team now
draws an average of 3,715 fans.
The Connecticut story is simi
lar. When Geno Auriemma ar
rived at UConn before the 1985-
86 season, the Huskies played in
the campus field house, shared a
communal locker room and drew
around 50 fans a night, most of

whom were relatives and friends.
