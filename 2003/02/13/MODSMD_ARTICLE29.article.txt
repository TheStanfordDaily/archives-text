## Husky home court could cause problems for the Cardinal tonight 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team finally got its offense
turned around last weekend.
Now the No. 6 Cardinal can
only hope it can keep the momen
tum going as it heads north fora
crucial weekend in Washington.

Stanford (19-2, 11-1 Pacific-10
Conference) will play one of its
biggest games of the season
Thursday at 7 p.m., when the
Cardinal squares off with sec
ond-place Washington (17-5, 9-
4) in a game that could seal the
Pac-10 regular season champi
onship for all intents and pur
poses.
But it won't he easy to come
out of Bank of America Arena
with a win.
The Huskies have traditional
ly played well in Seattle, and this

year is no exception. Washington
lias won all 11 of its home games
this season, marking the longest
such streak for the team since
1988.
Part of the reason Washington
plays so well at home is their fan
base. The Huskies lead the Pac
-10 in attendance with 4,515 fans
per game — and the players can
draw lots of energy from these
rambunctious crowds.
"They play with a different
confidence at home," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They play at a higher intensity.
"It just means that our team
has to play with confidence and
poise."
The Huskies will be even more
ramped up to play the top-10
Cardinal considering the miser
able weekend they had in Ari
zona.
For the fifth time in the last six
years, Washington was swept by
the Arizona schools on the road.
After losing 79-66 to Arizona and
then 62-56 to Arizona State, the
Huskies found themselves mired
in their first losing streak of the
season and dropped out of the
top-25 for the first time in two
weeks.
After that weekend in the
desert, the gap between the

The matchup between Stanford junior Nicole Powell and Washington's Giu
liana Mendiola may determine me outcome of toniaht's game, when the No.
6 Cardinal faces what may be its toughest test of the Pac-10 season. The
Huskies are a perfect 11 -0 at home this year.
Huskies and the Cardinal bal
looned to two and a half games.
For some reason, the Huskies'
biggest strength became its
biggest problem last weekend.
Washington entered the Ari
zona trek leading the Pac-10 in
scoring with 78.2 points per
game.
But the Huskies managed only
66 and 56 points, respectively, ac
counting for two of their lowest
point totals of the season.
Meanwhile, Stanford had no
such problems, starting with its
easy 85-54 victory over Oregon
—one of the Cardinal's most
complete games of the season.
Stanford shot a season-high
56.4 percent from the field,
turned the ball over a season-low
11 times and got both sophomore
guard Kelley Suminski (20
points) and forward Azella Perry
man (14 points, 8 rebounds) back
on track.
The Cardinal then duplicated
the effort two days later against
Oregon State — this time on the

defensive end — forcing 30
Beaver turnovers and limiting its
opponent to only 36.2 percent
shooting from the field in a 72-48
win.
"Last weekend was really im
portant for us," VanDerveer said.
"We executed better, got out run
ning and showed we weren't just
a one-dimensional team."
The back-to-back blowout situ
ations also allowed VanDerveer to
play her reserves for more ex
tended minutes, something that
may help Stanford down the road.
With the uncertainty of the
NCAA Tournament — whether
it be unexpected foul trouble or
fatigue from escaping a press —
Stanford could possibly have to
turn to its bench for important
minutes in March.
"It's nice that we have players
that can accept their roles," Van-
Derveer said.
There's another thing that will
help the Cardinal in a month.
Stanford has come from be
hind in the second half eight
times this season, and seems to
have a knack for coming up with
the big play at just the right time.
(Kansas State, Oregon and
UCLA come to mind.)

"People are just fearless," Van-
Derveer said. "We've made plays
with this team that we've never
made before.
"And now that we've made
these plays in games, and not in
practice, we know we can make
them again in any situation."
Stanford played without red
shirt sophomore and starting
point guard Susan King last
week.
King was held out with a sore
broken little left toe — she had
been playing with the injury
since early January — but is list
ed as probable for this week
end's games.
The Cardinal also will play
against winless Washington State
(0-21,0-13) on Saturday at 1 p.m.
in Pullman.

JORDY MONT-REYNAUD/The Stanford Daily
The matchup between Stanford junior Nicole Powell and Washington's Giu
liana Mendiola may determine me outcome of toniaht's game, when the No.
6 Cardinal faces what may be its toughest test of the Pac-10 season. The
Huskies are a perfect 11 -0 at home this year.
Huskies and the Cardinal bal
looned to two and a half games.
For some reason, the Huskies'
biggest strength became its
biggest problem last weekend.
Washington entered the Ari
zona trek leading the Pac-10 in
scoring with 78.2 points per
game.
But the Huskies managed only
66 and 56 points, respectively, ac
counting for two of their lowest
point totals of the season.
Meanwhile, Stanford had no
such problems, starting with its
easy 85-54 victory over Oregon
—one of the Cardinal's most
complete games of the season.
Stanford shot a season-high
56.4 percent from the field,
turned the ball over a season-low
11 times and got both sophomore
guard Kelley Suminski (20
points) and forward Azella Perry
man (14 points, 8 rebounds) back
on track.
The Cardinal then duplicated
the effort two days later against
Oregon State — this time on the

defensive end — forcing 30
Beaver turnovers and limiting its
opponent to only 36.2 percent
shooting from the field in a 72-48
win.
"Last weekend was really im
portant for us," VanDerveer said.
"We executed better, got out run
ning and showed we weren't just
a one-dimensional team."
The back-to-back blowout situ
ations also allowed VanDerveer to
play her reserves for more ex
tended minutes, something that
may help Stanford down the road.
With the uncertainty of the
NCAA Tournament — whether
it be unexpected foul trouble or
fatigue from escaping a press —
Stanford could possibly have to
turn to its bench for important
minutes in March.
"It's nice that we have players
that can accept their roles," Van-
Derveer said.
There's another thing that will
help the Cardinal in a month.
Stanford has come from be
hind in the second half eight
times this season, and seems to
have a knack for coming up with
the big play at just the right time.
(Kansas State, Oregon and
UCLA come to mind.)

"People are just fearless," Van-
Derveer said. "We've made plays
with this team that we've never
made before.
"And now that we've made
these plays in games, and not in
practice, we know we can make
them again in any situation."
Stanford played without red
shirt sophomore and starting
point guard Susan King last
week.
King was held out with a sore
broken little left toe — she had
been playing with the injury
since early January — but is list
ed as probable for this week
end's games.
The Cardinal also will play
against winless Washington State
(0-21,0-13) on Saturday at 1 p.m.
in Pullman.

The Stanford women's basket
ball team finally got its offense
turned around last weekend.
Now the No. 6 Cardinal can
only hope it can keep the momen
tum going as it heads north fora
crucial weekend in Washington.

Women's Basketball
at Washington, tonight, 7 p.m.
at Washington State, Saturday, 1 p.m.

Stanford (19-2, 11-1 Pacific-10
Conference) will play one of its
biggest games of the season
Thursday at 7 p.m., when the
Cardinal squares off with sec
ond-place Washington (17-5, 9-
4) in a game that could seal the
Pac-10 regular season champi
onship for all intents and pur
poses.
But it won't he easy to come
out of Bank of America Arena
with a win.
The Huskies have traditional
ly played well in Seattle, and this

year is no exception. Washington
lias won all 11 of its home games
this season, marking the longest
such streak for the team since
1988.
Part of the reason Washington
plays so well at home is their fan
base. The Huskies lead the Pac
-10 in attendance with 4,515 fans
per game — and the players can
draw lots of energy from these
rambunctious crowds.
"They play with a different
confidence at home," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They play at a higher intensity.
"It just means that our team
has to play with confidence and
poise."
The Huskies will be even more
ramped up to play the top-10
Cardinal considering the miser
able weekend they had in Ari
zona.
For the fifth time in the last six
years, Washington was swept by
the Arizona schools on the road.
After losing 79-66 to Arizona and
then 62-56 to Arizona State, the
Huskies found themselves mired
in their first losing streak of the
season and dropped out of the
top-25 for the first time in two
weeks.
