# Trustees raise tuition and housing rates
## Increases will help remedy deficits from economic downturn 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to the current economic
slowdown, the Stanford Board of
Trustees announced yesterday
that it will raise die 2003-04 tuition
and housing rates by 4.8 percent
for undergraduate students.
Undergraduate tuition will be
fixed at $28,564, a 5 percent in
crease from the current figure of
$27,204. In addition, the typical
undergraduate room rate will be
raised from $4,450 to $4,702 and
the average board rate will be
$4,347, up from this year's $4,230.
"Given the downturn in the
economy, this year is a challenging
one," said Board of Trustees Chair

Isaac Stein. "Despite mounting
economic pressures, we have kept
the overall rate of increase slightly
below last year's increase."
According to Stein, the jump in
rates will be coupled with budget
cuts in other areas to improve the
University's financial situation.
"A tuition increase is an in
evitable result of a deficit budget,"
Stein said. "But we're trying to
make it as small as possible."
According to Stein, the Board
of Trustees sets new rates every
year. The process of re-fixing the
rates takes place over a period of
several months, during which
the University considers the
charges at other institutions as
well as alternative cuts and finan
cial aid figures.
Stein underscored the impor
tance of ensuring that students
are not prohibited from attend
ing Stanford due to increased
enrollments costs.

"One of our core principles is to
maintain our admission levels,"
Stein said. "Our intention is to
allow everyone who can attend
Stanford to do so if they have
demonstrated financial need."
The change will lead to an ex
pansion of financial aid to com
pensate for the raised rates. He
also noted that the number of fam
ilies who need aid has increased
due to the weak economy.
Stein did not predict any
change in admissions as a result of
the rate increases, since Stanford is
one of only a few private universi
ties in the nation with a need-blind
admission policy.
Need-blind institutions disre
gard students' financial situations
during admission processes.
Even with the raised rates, tu
ition will still only cover 60 percent
of the total amount that the Uni
versity pays to educate each un
dergraduate student.

Rates increased for graduate
students, as well.
Tuition for terminal graduate
students currently writing their
dissertations increased 50 percent
over the prior rate to $4,950 for
three quarters.
Part-time graduate students
will now pay $18,567, which is
65 percent of that paid by full
time students.
Although graduate charges are
different for each school, the aver
age increase in tuition was set at 5
percent. However, students at the
Graduate School of Business will
be paying $36,252 in tuition, an in
crease of 8.9 percent over the cur
rent amount.
"We are very aware that [the
tuition increases are] a burden on
students and their families," Stein
said. "We are working very hard
to make the increase as small as
possible in order to reduce that
burden."
