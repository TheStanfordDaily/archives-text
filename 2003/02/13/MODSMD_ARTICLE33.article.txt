### 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) —
Teresa Phillips' first game as coach
of Tennessee State's men's basket
ball team will be one for the record
books.
Phillips, the school's athletic di
rector, will become the first
woman to coach a men's Division I
college basketball team when the
Tigers play at Austin Peay in
Clarksville, Tenn., tonight.
Phillips suspended interim
coach Hosea Lewis for one game
Tuesday and announced she
would coach the team a day after
19 players were ejected following a
brawl between Tennessee State
and Eastern Kentucky.
It's believed to be the first time
that a woman will coach male play
ers in a major team sport.
There are plenty of men coach
ing women's college basketball
teams. Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma has won three NCAA

titles and two out of the last three.
But the only women to ever serve
as coaches fora men's Division I
team were assistants: Bernadette
Locke at Kentucky and Stephanie
Ready at Coppin State.
Phillips coached the Tennessee
State women to a 212-189 record
from 1989-2000. She took over a
program that had been 2-25 and
went 12-14 in her first season.
The Tennessee State men are
in an even worse state of affairs
than Phillips' early teams. The
Tigers are 2-20 and 0-11 in the
Ohio Valley Conference and
previously dealt with coaching
turmoil this season. Nolan
Richardson 111, the son of for
mer Arkansas coach Nolan
Richardson, resigned Jan. 8, two
weeks after Phillips suspended
him indefinitely for bringing a
gun into the school's gym.
Richardson admitted he got the

gun out of his car during an ar
gument with Lewis, who was
then his assistant. Phillips hired
Lewis as interim coach upon
Richardson's resignation.
Monday night's brawl broke
out with 8:13 to play in the Tigers'
89-72 loss at Eastern Kentucky.
Eastern's Shawn Fields had the
ball when a hard foul was called on
TSU's Cedric Bryson, prompting
players from both benches to run
onto the floor.
Fields, Bryson and Eastern's
Kenyatta Dix and Champ Slaugh
ter were ejected for fighting, while
nine players from both teams were
ejected for leaving the bench. The
rest of the players who were in
when the fight started also were
ejected.
The game resumed with only
four players on each side; Ten
nessee State finished with three
players after one fouled out.
