### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last week, Earl Dowling arrived at
Stanford from lowa State to assume the
newly formed position of associate dean
and director of financial aid — a post
that the University hopes will bolster its
ability to financially support its students.
Dowling, who spent the past 15 years
directing lowa State's $200 million stu
dent assistance program, will report to
Robin Mamlet, the dean of admission
and financial aid.
"The position of Associate Dean and
Director of Financial Aid was created
because we believe that financial aid is of
critical import to the University, and, as
such, merits having a director of nation
al stature who will lead us both within
Stanford and on a national level with is
sues relevant to financial aid," Mamlet
said. "This position is typical of institu
tions like ours."
Admission and financial aid are sepa
rate offices, and Dowling will be director
of financial aid. As such, he places an
emphasis on student services.
"I'm focusing on how the financial
aid staff can improve already good busi
ness practices," Dowling said. "It's my
responsibility to anticipate the needs of
Stanford students."
One of Dowling's areas of interest is
modernizing student aid programs. At

lowa State, he developed technical
changes to make the department more
student-friendly. While he does not
yet have any concrete plans for Stan
ford, he is thinking about ways to im
prove student access to resources
using technology.
Watching his sons grow up playing
video games helped clue Dowling in to
the technological focus of today's college
students.
"[My sons] progressed through Nin
tendo, Atari and Playstation — at an
early age, this is what they did," he said.
"They're more comfortable with those
mediums than their parents."
He wants to use communication tech
nology to make financial aid information
more available to students at all times.
"My college-age children are begin
ning their day when I am going to bed,"
Dowling said. "We need to find ways to
serve our students when they want to be
served, 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Human staffing is unrealistic.
Let's look at ways we can serve these stu
dents using technology," he said.
Mamlet said she sees Dowling as a
key member of her senior staff.
"I am particularly excited about
Earl Dowling's appointment," she
said. "He is smart, loves Stanford and
is committed to access and to need
blind admission."
Dowling spoke of himself as a resource,

particularly for need-blind admissions.
"With need-blind admissions I'll
have the opportunity to interact with
parents of newly admitted Stanford
students in helping them understand
financial aid and arrange financing,"
he said.
Even more, he sees himself as a re
source for the entire community. He
wants to continue community outreach
from the financial aid office.
"There will be the opportunity using
financial aid to make families aware that
aid is available," he said. "Maybe not
even Stanford families — especially
families of low income students. For ex
ample, two staff members are visiting a
high school in San Jose and presenting
financial aid programs in Spanish and
English. This certainly meets my defini
tion of how we can serve the communi
ty," he said.
Mamlet outlined Dowling's many
accomplishments.
"He is a national leader in the field,
has experience working at both the state
and federal level as an advocate for stu
dent aid, has a proven track record in
helping fundraise for financial aid and
also with working collaboratively with a
number of offices across an institution
so as to provide the best service to stu
dents," she said. "On top of that, he is
recognized as a great
manager / boss to his own staff,
and is just plain fun to work with."
Dowling was chosen by the Uni
versity after a year-long, nation

wide search.
In response to rumors that
Dowling's appointment might be
connected to plans for Mamlet to
accept a position at another uni
versity, Mamlet reiterated her
commitment to Stanford.
"I have no intention of leav
ing Stanford," Mamlet said. "I
love it here."
