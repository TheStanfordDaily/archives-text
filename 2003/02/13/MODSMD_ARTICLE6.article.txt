# Frosh clustering worries RFs

### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Potential changes in freshman housing
may bring dramatic changes in the role of res
ident fellows — many of whom say they are
concerned that proposals to cluster freshmen
in a complex of dorms may diminish faculty
student interaction by bringing non-faculty
staff into residences and lowering the RF-to
student ratio.
While all plans remain tentative, proposals
have ranged from a modification in RF duties
and programming to a reduction of the num
ber of RFs in freshman dorms.
As the University is exploring the logistics
of concentrating incoming freshman stu
dents into a large, single-class complex com
prised of Wilbur and Stern Halls, the Office
for Student Affairs said it is also taking the op
portunity to evaluate the staff structure with
in freshman dorms.
"As the needs of students have changed
and as the opportunities that we provide un
dergraduates have so greatly expanded, it is
clear to me that success as an RF is harder
than ever to achieve," said John Bravman,
vice provost of undergraduate education.
"Our response should be to bring more re
sources to bear so that RFs can spend more
time in their role as educators within the res
idence system."
While staff reorganization could make ad
ditional resources available for dorm pro
gramming, many RFs are worried about other
possible ramifications of freshman clustering.
"There are ways of implementing cluster
ing that could bolster the resident fellow's

role as adviser and mentor and there are ways
that could diminish it," said Stephen Sted
man, an RF at Larkin in Stern Hall.
According to Stedman, one idea
pitched in conjunction with clustering is
replacing RFs in Stern and Wilbur with
live-in advisers, tutors, resident deans and
staff members from Counseling and Psy
chological Services.
"If that were to happen, then the change
would revolutionize the role of RFs from
being a friend, mentor and adviser to a man
ager keeping track of 15 to 20 RAs, HPACs
and PHEs," Stedman said.
The change would expand the RF-to-stu
dent ratio from the current one for every 90
students to approximately one for adviser 270.
"I think that if the ratio is broadened, stu
dents will lose the opportunity to have valu
able personal connections with their RFs,"
said senior Sarah Kitchell, a college assistant
at the Freshman / Sophomore College. "I
don't think that CAPS counselors and other
advisers could build the same type of intel
lectual atmosphere that exists in the dorms
right now."
Many freshman students agreed that
RFs serve an important purpose in unify
ing the social and academic aspects of resi
dence life.
"The RFs are good influences and role
models," said freshman David Simpson.
In some dorms, RFs coordinate book
clubs, hold brownie nights and organize stu
dent excursions to off-campus events, accord
ing to freshman Caitlin Sanford.

Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall are the residence sites that will probably house the new freshman
cluster if the proposed project is implemented.
She added that they also extend
friendship as well as personal and
academic advice to students.
"As a research university with a
large number of undergraduates,
it is often difficult for students to
access faculty members in such a
way," said ASSU President Monica
Henestroza, a senior. "Some facul
ty members do not prioritize
teaching, fewer prioritize advising
and mentoring.

"I think Stanford would bene
fit from investing resources in
strengthening the RF program
rather than moving toward
structural changes that could
even further reduce faculty-stu
dent interaction."
"Stanford's residential edu
cation system is very strong, but
it can be improved," Stedman
said. "The bottom line for any
proposed changes should be
whether they increase the inter
action between students and
faculty and promote the cre
ation of strong, vibrant residen
tial communities."
