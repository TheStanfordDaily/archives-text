# Univ. approves BCSC request for expansion
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to a University
wide petition and a proposal sub
mitted by the Black Community
Services Center last December, the
Stanford administration recendy
approved an increase in space for
the BCSC, allotting it an additional
2,500 square feet that will cost ap
proximately $1 million to com
plete.
The additional space will almost
triple the size of the current BCSC
structure and will be added be
tween the existing building and the
Harmony House.
According to the BCSC, a possi
ble design idea would be to con
struct a new building connected to
the current center by courtyards,
but there is no concrete design
plan, as an architect has not yet
been hired.
Thom Massey, assistant dean of
at the Graduate Life Of
ficer; was very enthusiastic about the
project.
"It's been a long time coming,"
Massey said. "Students have really
been catalysts in making this hap
pen. They got the provost and
president over here, [both of
whom] recognized that the space
we have is insufficient."
Provost John Etchemendy said,
"This was entirely my decision
based on President [John] Hen
nessy's and my visit to the center."
"We both felt that the cur
rent space was inadequate," he
continued. "But the center
must still raise the money to
fund the project."
According to Etchemendy, the
BCSC will be assisted by the Office
of Development in constructing a
fundraising plan. Work with Capi
tal Planning — which handles all
University construction — and the
University architect will not start
until at least $50,000 has been
raised, and construction will not
begin until the entire estimated
cost has been raised.

Figueroa, a junior, said the costs
will have to be funded by gifts from
alumni and other donors.

"We're very hopeful about
being able to raise this money be
cause of the tremendous support
we have from alumni," Figueroa
said. "We definitely appreciate the
response we've received from the
administration, given the current
state of budget cuts. They recog
nize that this is a high priority for
the student body — a very valid
and legitimate request. We're very
appreciative of the University's co
operation."
According to the BCSC, ways to
use the additional space depend
on the architect's plans, but possi
ble ideas include additional meet
ing space, storage space, a multi
purpose room, conference rooms,
a computer cluster, a reference li
brary, a counseling room, a
kitchen or performance and re
hearsal space.
The current BCSC building
serves the University's 597-student
black undergraduate community
and f pccupies 1,401 square feet of
space, including 680 square feet of
meeting space. Currendy, all gath
erings that include more than 20
people have to be held outside of
the BCSC in locations such as Uja
maa or El Centro Chicano.
Since 1967, when the BCSC was
established, the black student pop
ulation has grown from 1 percent
of the campus population to
around 10 percent in 2002.
"A larger BCSC for the Stan
ford black community is some
thing that has been long over
due," said junior Kevin Dious,
Black Student Union co-chair.
"We are truly excited and we look
forward to working with the
provost and vice provost to final
ize the expansion of the BCSC.
We appreciate all of the support
from the entire Stanford commu
nity for our cause."
Second-year civil and environ
mental engineering coterminal
student Ajama Kitwana said, "I've
worked on a lot of campaigns with
different provosts — this is a very
progressive administration in
terms of really trying to make
things happen." He added, "In
stead ofjust saying they support di
versity, which everyone says,
they're genuinely trying to assist us.
We are very grateful."
