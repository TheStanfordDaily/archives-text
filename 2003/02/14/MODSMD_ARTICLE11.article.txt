"Oil, War and Terrorism" protest today
Stanford students and community members will protest "socially ir
responsible gas guzzling" in White Plaza at noon today followed by a
protest at the Hummer dealership in Burlingame.
Protest organizers will address the influence of U.S. oil demands on
foreign policy and the Middle East.
"Diplomatic and military actions by the U.S. to protect our domestic
dependence on oil have played a role in the increasing anti-American
sentiment abroad," said protest organizers.
There will be a focus on SUV oil use and carbon dioxide emission and
the need to utilize technology that allows vehicles to go further on a gal
lon of gas.
"The United States has 5 percent of the world's population, but pro
duces almost a third of all greenhouse gases from automobiles," orga
nizers said.
Daniel Pearl Memorial Journalism Internship
awarded
The Daniel Pearl Memorial Journalism Internship was awarded toju
nior Vauhini Vara yesterday.
The 10-week long internship will take place with The Wall Street
Journal in Hong Kong this summer. The annual internship was estab
lished this year in memory of Pearl, who was murdered by Pakistani mil
itants while working in Karachi last January.
Vara, an international relations major and economics minor, was cho
sen out of 20 applicants by a Wall Street Journal assistant editor.
"The Wall Street Journal emphasizes good writing and reporting,"
Vara said. "I am really excited to work fora paper that does that." The
internship will allow Vara to combine her interests in business and in
ternational relations. Last summer Vara had a business journalism in
ternship at the Denver Post.
"So many other amazing people applied," Vara said. "I am really sur
prised and excited."
"Noise Floor" exhibition opens
"Noise Floor," an exhibition on sound-installations by visiting Aus
tralian art sculptor Nigel Helyer, opened in the Stanford Art Gallery this
week.
The show includes three works and a web project. "Seed" is an inter
active sonic minefield where participants use mine detectors to listen to
the content, "Chant" presents sound delivered through Bronze Bud
dhas, and "Host" is an installation with live crickets and DVD projec
tions.
" 'Seed' is a sonic installation that metaphorically collides our agricul
tural lexicon of the minefield with the narratives of the Old Testament
and the contemporary disasters of military and ideological conflict,"
Helyer said. The landmines emit Arabic music overlaid with voices in
Arabic and English.
" 'Seed' proposes a place of complexity and ambiguity within which to
contemplate the simplistic and unilateral position of current military and
political events," he said. "It is after all sobering to consider that the death
toll inflicted by landmines is equivalent to the appalling destruction of
the World Trade Center, repeated five times each year."
The show will remain in the gallery through March 2. There will be a
special lecture on Feb. 27 by Helyer, who is a visiting artist in the Art and
Art History Department.
"Fast for Peace" participants to speak
1 his Sunday there will be a presentation on "The Spirituality of Fast
ing and Its Relationship to Peace" in connection with a talk on "Reflec
tions on a Journey to Iraq."

York this September. The guest speakers are Jim Barnett, a Dominican
Priest and social justice activist who ministered in El Salvador during the
war and in Honduras, and Sheila Provencher, who participated in a del
egation to Iraq in December.
I he event will provide important insight and understanding to the
Fast for Peace that will be initiated on campus if the war starts," said Glo
ria Jones, staff of the Catholic Community at Stanford and organizer of
the lecture. "It will also provide first-hand information about the state,
spirit and reality of the people in Iraq at this time from a non-govern
mental perspective."

Architects for Peace Project and the Dominican Sisters of Mission San
Jose. The talk begins at 6 p.m. in Tresidder Oak East.
