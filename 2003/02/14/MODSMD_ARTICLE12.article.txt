## Bush asks for support from U.N. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — On the eve
of a showdown over Iraq, President
Bush said yesterday that the United Na
tions must help him confront Saddam
Hussein or "fade into history as an inef
fective, irrelevant, debating society."
As Bush issued his call for unity, the
administration said Americans should
be prepared for"a fairly long-term
commitment" in Iraq if the United
States goes to war.
Secretary of State Colin Powell told
the House Budget Committee he had
no estimate of the cost of war with Iraq.
But he did say he thought Iraq should
be able to adjust quickly afterward — in
contrast to the slow pace of recovery in
Afghanistan.
"I would hope that it would be a
short conflict and that it would be di
rected at the leadership, not the soci
ety," he said. Iraq has an effective bu
reaucracy, rich oil resources and a de
veloped middle class, the secretary of
state said.
The flurry of events laid the ground
work for Friday, when U.N. weapons
inspectors are to report to the Security
Council on whether Iraq is complying
with orders to disarm. Bush is expected
to quickly follow up with a request fora
U.N. resolution authorizing force.
However, the top U.N. nuclear
weapons inspector said yesterday that
inspections should continue.
"We're still in midcourse, but we are

moving forward, and I see no reason for
us to bring the inspection process to a
halt," Mohamed Elßaradei said in an
interview with The Associated Press as
he drafted his report on a flight from
Vienna, Austria, to New York.
Also reporting to the council will be
Hans Blix, who heads the hunt for
Baghdad's biological and chemical
weapons.
"I'm optimistic that free nations will
show backbone and courage in the face of
true threats to peace and freedom," the
president told cheering sailors during a
visit to Mayport Naval Station in Florida.
"I believe when it's all said and done,
free nations will not allow the United
Nations to fade into history," he said.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic law
makers questioned whether Bush's

focus on Iraq could hurt the broader
war against terrorists, particularly
Osama bin Laden's network suspected
in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"The clear and present danger that
we face in our country is from terrorism
and from al-Qaida," said House Demo
cratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California
as lawmakers heard testimony from
Powell, Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard Myers,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Stall".
Pelosi said it is important that "we
don't take our eye off that ball."
Republican Sen. John McCain of Ari
zona, in a speech the White House
pointed to, said Saddam could spring
"like a jack-in-the-box" against the
United States and could not be simply
contained as some Bush critics say.
