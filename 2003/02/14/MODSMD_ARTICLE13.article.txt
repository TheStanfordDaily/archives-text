# Terrorism prosecution on the rise since Sept. 11
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prose
cutions of terrorism cases have increased
tenfold since the Sept. 11 attacks as author
ities expanded the types of crimes included,
Justice Department records show.
During the year that began 19 days after
the attacks on New York and Washington,
federal prosecutors charged 1,208 individ
uals with crimes they classified as related to
terrorism or international security, com
pared with just 115 the previous year, ac
cording to records obtained by Syracuse
University's Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse (TRAC).
Nearly half of the terrorism prosecu
tions last year were initiated by investiga
tors from the Social Security Administra
tion and the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service. The two agencies had just two
such cases the previous year. Many of the
new cases arose from the terrorism pre
vention efforts aimed at illegal aliens and
airport workers with fake Social Security
numbers.
Justice Department officials refused to
comment directly on the TRAC data, but
Attorney General John Ashcroft said in an
Associated Press interview Wednesday that
prevention of new terrorist attacks has been
the government's top priority since Sept.
11. He claimed "monumental progress" in
achieving that goal.
Prevention "is more important than
prosecution," he said. "But very frequently
these priorities do not compete, they com
plement. In many instances prosecution
has been a real aid to our prevention effort
by helping generate valuable intelligence."
But Senate Finance Committee Chair
man Charles Grassley, R-lowa, said the
data "raises more questions than answers."

"We can't take someone's word that ter
rorism is being prevented. The Congress
and public need proof," Grassley said.
The FBI, which initiated almost three
quarters of all terrorism-related prosecu
tions in 2001, accounted for less than a
third of the cases last year. But the number
of terrorism charges based on FBI investi
gations still increased from 84 in 2001 to
377 last year.
The expansion of crimes considered
terrorism-related also resulted in lower
prison sentences, on the average, for the
394 individuals convicted in terrorism
cases last year.
The median jail term for those 394 was
just two months, down from 21 months for
the 41 individuals convicted in terrorism
related cases in 2001.
The median sentence for terrorism con
victions initiated by the INS was just one
month, while half the sentences for such
convictions in cases started by Social Securi
ty investigators was just two months. For
convictions stemming from FBI investiga
tions, in contrast, the median sentence was
12 months.
Since Sept. 11, prosecutors declined to
pursue just a third of the terrorism-related
cases brought to them, compared with
two-thirds the previous year. Prosecutors
also decided whether to prosecute such
cases five times faster last year than in
2001, when they took, on average, nearly
a year to decide.
The focus on terrorism prevention and
prosecution doesn't appear to have
drained resources away from other federal
law enforcement activities, as many experts,
including Ashcroft, predicted shortly after
Sept. 11.
