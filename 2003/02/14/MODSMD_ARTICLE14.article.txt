## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Our hats off to Haas 
### 
Many students reluctantly choose
not to pursue careers in public
service because such work is often
synonymous with low-pay or no
pay. At a time when Stanford students are look
ing for full-time employment or summer in
ternships, we laud the Haas Center for Public
Service for providing students with opportuni
ties to engage in public service work without
having to worry about their financial stabilities.
Each year, the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice offers fellowships that enable students to
spend a summer or up to a year in communi
ties around the world to make a difference, fn
the past, students have used their fellowships
to provide AIDS education to women in
Ghana or develop sustainable agriculture in
Mongolia.
We acknowledge the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service as a valuable resource for students.
And we applaud the many students who strive
to make positive contributions to their com
munities. Thanks.
As Stanford, along with the rest of the coun

try, prepares for National Civic Engagement
Week, which begins on Tuesday, we would
also like to challenge everyone at Stanford to
take a moment to think about how each and
every one of us has a responsibility to one an
other and to our community.
Yes, it's true. You too can make a differ
ence.
You can start out at the Haas Center for
Public Service, but don't stop there. When it
comes to public service and civic engagement
at Stanford, the possibilities really are endless.
Whether you participate in a day-long ser
vice event or tutor weekly for four years, serv
ing others is one of the most important aspects
of a quality education.
When you are considering jobs for the sum
mer or next year, think twice before passing up
a public service opportunity. Perhaps the pay
check won't be big but the rewards will be.
President Emeritus Donald Kennedy once
said, "Our society needs the grand ventures,
and the grand ventures need you."
We agree.
