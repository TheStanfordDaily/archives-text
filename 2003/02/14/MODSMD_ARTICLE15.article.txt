# Be my Valentine

Happy Valentine's Day, Stanford.
As a holiday which portents nei
ther a three-day weekend nor
even a Stanford Dining Special
Event, Valentine's Day too often warrants
nothing but complaints — either from grip
ing single females or from financially and cre
atively broke boyfriends wielding chalky
candy hearts.
But instead of joining in and rehashing the
issue of Stanford's (dating) deficit, we would like
to offer you alternative, more soothing thoughts
on the True Meaning of Valentine's Day.
Remember when the day meant fun?
Think back to your elementary school days.
On the big Feb. 14, you waded through
your own exclusive hoard of cards from Clif-

ford the Big Red Dog, Beavis and Butthead,
or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles while
nibbling away at chocolate and candy. Back
then, the biggest problem you might have had
was a stomachache from eating too much
candy.
You didn't have to worry about having that
one special sweetheart, because you always
had two - mom and dad. For them you
painstakingly labored to create masterpieces
out of construction paper, doilies, Elmer's
glue and safety scissors. Even without reserva
tions at a fancy restaurant or a shiny, expen
sive gift, they were always impressed.
The point is, Valentine's Day was a holiday
— not a deadline or chore. So why not rekin
dle those good times this year?
