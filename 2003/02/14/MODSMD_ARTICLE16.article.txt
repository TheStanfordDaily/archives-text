ASSU asks for student response to
University's affirmative action statement
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate is
currently considering a statement in pub
lic support of President Hennessy's recent
endorsement of affirmative action. In a
Jan. 23 presentation to the Faculty Senate,
Hennessy said, "[lt is] appropriate to reaf
firm our commitment to diversity. We re
main committed to affirmative action as a
practical and appropriate means to
achieve such diversity."
The Faculty Senate endorsed this state
ment unanimously, and the University
plans to collaborate with other institutions
to submit an amicus brief before the
Supreme Court to support the legality of
affirmative action.
The undergraduate Senate seeks
input to create an appropriate, con
structive response to Hennessy's state
ment and is conducting an informal poll
available at http://assu.stanford.edu/aa.
In addition to submitting feedback, vis
itors will be able to view the original Fac
ulty Senate presentation and the pro
posed ASSU Undergradua',.t Senate

statement.
A bill in support of Hennessy's state
ment shall be presented on Tuesday, Feb.
18 at 7 p.m. in room 90 of the Law School.
Stanford undergraduates are encouraged
to attend, and to submit any additional
comments in advance to
senate@assu. Stanford .edu.
THE ASSU UNDERGRADUATE SENATE

No war can ever be 'just'
Scotty McLennan's latest guest col
umn entitled "Declaring a just war?"
(Feb. 13) is, at best, disingenuous.
McLennan's central premise is that the
war against Iraq would be unjust ac
cording to the Christian definition of a
just war.
And yet, McLennan's list of objections
to this war reads like a list of objections
to ANY war. To make matters worse,
they have all been used before with dis
astrous consequences. In 1938, Ger
many appeared to be militarily con
tained by the French Maginot line and
the non-aggression pact with the Sovi
ets, and politically pacified by the an
nexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia.

At the time, going to war to stop German
expansionism meant no certainty of suc
cess, high civilian casualties and did not
appear to be a matter of last resort, es
pecially given the "concessions" extract
ed by British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain at Munich Appeasement
seemed the obvious solution and this led
the world to heretofore unimaginable
tragedy.
If we have learned any lesson from
1938, appeasement is never the answer to
aggression by a ruthless dictator. I have
tremendous respect for McLennan if his
opposition to this war is a result of his op
position to all war. Otherwise, it appears
disingenuous because no war can ever
truly satisfy the "just war" principles he
stated.
Finally, McLennan's claim that the ma
jority of Americans are against this war is
either ignorant or dishonest. The latest
Gallup poll (Feb. 7-9) finds that 63 percent
of Americans support an invasion of Iraq.
Both ABC News and Opinion Dynamics
polls put this number at 67 percent.
Where is this "majority" that McLennan
speaks of?
