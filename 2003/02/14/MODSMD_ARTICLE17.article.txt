## Home improvement 
### 
I love Stanford just as much as
the next guy. Many of us
could have gone to any top
university, but we all chose to
come here. We all believed then,
and hopefully still believe now,
that Stanford is the best.
Most aspects of Stanford life are
awesome, but a lot of things just
suck. And if we don't encourage a
dialogue about both the strengths
and shortcomings of our Stanford
experience, then the things that
we don't like will never get better.
We need to maintain a critical stu
dent body that is constantly work
ing to make this place rock even
more than it already does.
Sometimes 1 feel that Stanford
students are afraid to say anything
bad about our country club of a
school. Sure, it's OK to criticize
Stern Dining or Econ 102A, but we
don't criticize real things, the ev
eryday issues we talk about late at
night with only our roommates.
A central problem that I've no
ticed at Stanford is that not only do
we fail to acknowledge important
issues but also we often fail to ac
knowledge each other.
The greatest thing about Stan
ford is the students. What makes
this place so enriching is the fact
that all these special and interest
ing people are brought together.
We are our biggest asset — in the
future we will be the CEOs, profes
sors and New York Times colum
nists. We have so much to learn
from one another and should
strive to make real connections
with our peers.
We take shots together at par
ties. We cheer for the same team at

sporting events. We work for
hours on problem sets in study
groups. But how often do we talk
about our fears, insecurities, val
ues and beliefs? Religion. Our par
ents. Our future goals (deeper
than grad school plans). When was
the last time you seriously talked
about any of these topics?
When we fail to discuss pro
found personal issues with each

other, we under
mine the value of
our student
body. College is a
time when we
are still forming
our belief sys
tems. Talking to
others will only
broaden our

perspectives and introduce us to
what other people — of different
ethnic, socioeconomic and reli
gious backgrounds — believe.
But how can we expect to have
these kinds of conversations when
we can't even acknowledge each
other around campus? There is
nothing that irritates me more than
when I flash an innocuous half
smile to someone that I kind of
know, only to have that person turn
the other way. I feel more comfort
able talking to a random woman at
Safeway than I do to some of my
peers. I think this is really sad.
It's common knowledge that
after being at Stanford fora couple
of quarters, everyone starts to
know everyone else. You may
meet someone in person for the
first time but you know that he set
the curve on the Chem 33
midterm, or that she passed out at

Cedro's Strew Your Roommate. If
you haven't hooked up with him,
your drawmate probably has.
You just can't fall into anonymi
ty anymore.
Since most of us already know
each other — at least by face — it's
time for us to take the next step.
Don't be afraid of the guy down
the hall, don't be afraid of your
peers, don't be afraid of people.
Make the first move and congratu
late the girl who scored the win
ning goal at the soccer game. Or
talk to the guy you had I-Hum sec
tion with way back in the day.
The same goes for me. You're
reading my column, you see my
picture, and you might see me
around campus. I'm the girl stum
bling across the Quad in her stilet
tos. Oh wait, I'm not Carrie Brad
shaw. But it's sure fun to pretend I
am with this neat little column of
mine.
I'll probably write some contro
versial things in the next couple of
months — some of it you might
think is true, some of it you might
think is stupid. If you think I'm an
idiot, tell me. If you like what I say,
tell me. Talk to me and, more im
portantly, talk to one another.
Talk to your roommate or your lab
partner. The point is, if you have
an opinion about something, talk
about it.
Saying that you want to change
something about Stanford isn't
treason; if anything it shows your
dedication and commitment to
making this a better place.

tion with way back in the day.
The same goes for me. You're
reading my column, you see my
picture, and you might see me
around campus. I'm the girl stum
bling across the Quad in her stilet
tos. Oh wait, I'm not Carrie Brad
shaw. But it's sure fun to pretend I
am with this neat little column of
mine.
I'll probably write some contro
versial things in the next couple of
months — some of it you might
think is true, some of it you might
think is stupid. If you think I'm an
idiot, tell me. If you like what I say,
tell me. Talk to me and, more im
portantly, talk to one another.
Talk to your roommate or your lab
partner. The point is, if you have
an opinion about something, talk
about it.
Saying that you want to change
something about Stanford isn't
treason; if anything it shows your
dedication and commitment to
making this a better place.

Think I'm full of it?
