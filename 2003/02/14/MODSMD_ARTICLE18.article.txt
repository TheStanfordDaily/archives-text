## Barnes leads Cardinal to 78-69 victory over Washington 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
OK. . .so maybe Julius Barnes re
ally is a shooting guard at heart —
even though he won't admit it.
The 6-foot-1 Stanford starting
point guard continued his quest to
redefine the term "true point
guard," as he led the Stanford men's
basketball team in scoring with 29
points and helped the No. 24 Cardi
nal (18-6, 9-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
to a 78-69 victory over Washington
(8-13, 3-9 Pac-10) at Maples Pavilion
last night.
"Everyone always likes to say that
I'm a natural [shooting guard], but
I'm too small to be a natural two. I'm
a scoring point guard," Barnes ex
plained. "It's just that in this system
the point guard is used to only pass
the ball and most of the scoring
comes from the wing players."
However, with each "breakout"
shooting performance that he puts
together, the "true point guard"
rhetoric becomes harder and harder
to sell.
Stanford opened the game in
strong offensive form. The Cardinal
went on an early 12-4 run, led by
sophomore swingman Josh Chil
dress, who scored seven points in the
first five minutes of play. He finished
with 11 points and a game-leading
eight rebounds. In the first half, the
Cardinal shot 75 percent from be
hind the arc and 45 percent from the
field.
The Huskies quickly closed the
deficit, though. Washington forward
Doug Wrenn proved effective early.
He scored the Huskies' first 10
points of the game and accounted
for 42 percent of their total first half
offense. He finished the half with 16
points off 7-of-9 shooting from the
field.
Furthermore, he scored from a
variety of spots on the floor — sink

ing tough 15-footers and creating
lay-ups from the post. More impor
tantly, however, his offensive play
kept Washington within striking dis
tance.
"I felt like early on that [the
Huskies] weren't quite ready to play
and then Doug Wrenn just went off
and was scoring kinda at-will,"
Montgomery said.
After the early Stanford run,
Washington dropped back into a
zone which got the Cardinal stand
ing around offensively.
"They went into that zone and we
got stagnant," Montgomery said.
"We just stood [around] and kinda
one-pass-shot-the-ball and basically
our body language changed."
During that time period, the
Huskies, who were at one point
down by 12, went on a 20-7 run to
close the half and jogged into the
locker room with a 38-35 lead.
Even worse for the Cardinal, the
Washington run saw Husky point
guard Nate Robinson rediscover his
offensive groove. The 5-foot-9 point
guard, who had been kept quiet in
the game's early minutes, finished
with 10 first half points off 5-for-7
shooting from the field.
After trading baskets back and
forth for the opening 10 minutes of
the second half the score was tied 52-
52. Sophomore center Rob Little
then scored a bucket in the post to
jump-start a 19-7 Cardinal run. On
Washington's next possession, a
much more mobile Justin Davis took
his second charge of the game.
Davis' defensive stop was the first of
many for Stanford during that nine
minute stretch.
The charge ignited Stanford (and
Barnes, in particular) offensively.
The "true point guard" showed that
he had some scoring left in him com
ing off his 33-point performance


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Julius Barnes led the No. 24 Cardinal to an 9-point win over Washington,
scoring 21 of his 29 points in the second half.
Sunday in Corvallis, Ore.
During the run, Barnes scored
13 points, including three
straight 3-pointers, bringing the
crowd to its feet and extending
Stanford's lead to 13 with 7:20
left to play.
And that was all she wrote, as
Washington didn't make another
significant run.
"It's tough to lose games like
that down the stretch," said a dis
appointed Wrenn. "Everybody
keeps talking about 'next year,
next year' but some of these guys
don't have another year."
In addition to Barnes' offen
sive explosion, the Cardinal
made a concerted effort to get the
ball inside. Little finished the
game with 12 points off 6-for-9
shooting from the field, while
Davis managed nine points and
six boards.
"That's a good win for us,"
Montgomery said. "It's our ninth
[conference winj and that puts us
in pretty good shape."
Stanford will face unranked
Washington State on Saturday.
The Cougars will be playing with
out junior guard Marcus Moore
who is out for the season due to
recent surgery to remove bone
chips from his right ankle. Tipoff
is set for 2 p.m.

first five minutes of play. He finished
with 11 points and a game-leading
eight rebounds. In the first half, the
Cardinal shot 75 percent from be
hind the arc and 45 percent from the
field.
The Huskies quickly closed the
deficit, though. Washington forward
Doug Wrenn proved effective early.
He scored the Huskies' first 10
points of the game and accounted
for 42 percent of their total first half
offense. He finished the half with 16
points off 7-of-9 shooting from the
field.
Furthermore, he scored from a
variety of spots on the floor — sink

ing tough 15-footers and creating
lay-ups from the post. More impor
tantly, however, his offensive play
kept Washington within striking dis
tance.
"I felt like early on that [the
Huskies] weren't quite ready to play
and then Doug Wrenn just went off
and was scoring kinda at-will,"
Montgomery said.
After the early Stanford run,
Washington dropped back into a
zone which got the Cardinal stand
ing around offensively.
"They went into that zone and we
got stagnant," Montgomery said.
"We just stood [around] and kinda
one-pass-shot-the-ball and basically
our body language changed."
During that time period, the
Huskies, who were at one point
down by 12, went on a 20-7 run to
close the half and jogged into the
locker room with a 38-35 lead.
Even worse for the Cardinal, the
Washington run saw Husky point
guard Nate Robinson rediscover his
offensive groove. The 5-foot-9 point
guard, who had been kept quiet in
the game's early minutes, finished
with 10 first half points off 5-for-7
shooting from the field.
After trading baskets back and
forth for the opening 10 minutes of
the second half the score was tied 52-
52. Sophomore center Rob Little
then scored a bucket in the post to
jump-start a 19-7 Cardinal run. On
Washington's next possession, a
much more mobile Justin Davis took
his second charge of the game.
Davis' defensive stop was the first of
many for Stanford during that nine
minute stretch.
The charge ignited Stanford (and
Barnes, in particular) offensively.
The "true point guard" showed that
he had some scoring left in him com
ing off his 33-point performance


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Julius Barnes led the No. 24 Cardinal to an 9-point win over Washington,
scoring 21 of his 29 points in the second half.
Sunday in Corvallis, Ore.
During the run, Barnes scored
13 points, including three
straight 3-pointers, bringing the
crowd to its feet and extending
Stanford's lead to 13 with 7:20
left to play.
And that was all she wrote, as
Washington didn't make another
significant run.
"It's tough to lose games like
that down the stretch," said a dis
appointed Wrenn. "Everybody
keeps talking about 'next year,
next year' but some of these guys
don't have another year."
In addition to Barnes' offen
sive explosion, the Cardinal
made a concerted effort to get the
ball inside. Little finished the
game with 12 points off 6-for-9
shooting from the field, while
Davis managed nine points and
six boards.
"That's a good win for us,"
Montgomery said. "It's our ninth
[conference winj and that puts us
in pretty good shape."
Stanford will face unranked
Washington State on Saturday.
The Cougars will be playing with
out junior guard Marcus Moore
who is out for the season due to
recent surgery to remove bone
chips from his right ankle. Tipoff
is set for 2 p.m.

OK. . .so maybe Julius Barnes re
ally is a shooting guard at heart —
even though he won't admit it.
The 6-foot-1 Stanford starting
point guard continued his quest to
redefine the term "true point
guard," as he led the Stanford men's
basketball team in scoring with 29
points and helped the No. 24 Cardi
nal (18-6, 9-3 Pacific 10 Conference)
to a 78-69 victory over Washington
(8-13, 3-9 Pac-10) at Maples Pavilion
last night.
"Everyone always likes to say that
I'm a natural [shooting guard], but
I'm too small to be a natural two. I'm
a scoring point guard," Barnes ex
plained. "It's just that in this system
the point guard is used to only pass
the ball and most of the scoring
comes from the wing players."
However, with each "breakout"
shooting performance that he puts
together, the "true point guard"
rhetoric becomes harder and harder
to sell.
Stanford opened the game in
strong offensive form. The Cardinal
went on an early 12-4 run, led by
sophomore swingman Josh Chil
dress, who scored seven points in the
first five minutes of play. He finished
with 11 points and a game-leading
eight rebounds. In the first half, the
Cardinal shot 75 percent from be
hind the arc and 45 percent from the
field.
