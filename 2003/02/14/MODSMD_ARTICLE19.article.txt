This time, the big men won.
No. 24 Stanford (18-6, 9-3 Pacific-10 Conference) proved
too strong fora quick but undersized Washington team (8-
13, 3-9) last night at Maples Pavilion, avenging its January
loss to the Huskies with a 78-69 win.
After clawing its way to a 52-52 tie with 11 minutes left in
the game, Washington ran out of gas, and the Cardinal rode
a renewed defensive effort and dominant rebounding to a
comfortable margin of victory.
The highlight reels may focus on senior guard Julius
Barnes' 29 points, but it was the Cardinal's big men who
sealed the deal. Stanford locked down on the offensive and
defensive glass in the second half, controlling the ball for 86
straight seconds late in the game, courtesy of three offensive
rebounds, before 6-8 Mike Jensen — Washington's tallest
starter — finally regained possession for the Huskies.
In the second half, Stanford outrebounded Washington
by a stunning 20-7 margin, including 10 offensive boards.
In the first half, though, Washington's quickness and fresh
legs kept pace with the Cardinal. Diminutive point guard
Nate Robinson parlayed a variety of high-arcing lay-ups in 10
first-half points on 5-7 shooting, off guard Curtis Allen scored
nine on 3-5 shooting, and junior forward Doug Wrenn used
a variety of clever moves to post 16 first-half points on 7-9
shooting.
"Washington is quick," Stanford head coach Mike Monto
gomery said. "Curtis Allen and Nate Robinson consistently
split us and got inside and shot those floaters, and they didn't
miss many."
The Cardinal also had trouble holding on to the ball in the
first half, as the Huskies used their speed and quick hands to
force turnovers. Despite their size disadvantage, the Huskies
managed to grab the same number of first-half rebounds as
Stanford (14).
Washington finished the first half on a 22-7 run, as Robin
son and Allen slashed to the basket and Wrenn frustrated the
Cardinal big men.
"These were the best minutes we've had on the road [this
season]," Washington head coach Lorenzo Romar said.
Junior forward Justin Davis explained: "I played real pas
sive on Wrenn, and the coaches got on me about that."
However, Stanford learned a few lessons in its Jan. 18 loss
at Washington, and in the second half, they wore down the
