This time, the big men won.
No. 24 Stanford (18-6, 9-3 Pacific-10 Conference) proved
too strong fora quick but undersized Washington team (8-
13, 3-9) last night at Maples Pavilion, avenging its January
loss to the Huskies with a 78-69 win.
After clawing its way to a 52-52 tie with 11 minutes left in
the game, Washington ran out of gas, and the Cardinal rode
a renewed defensive effort and dominant rebounding to a
comfortable margin of victory.
The highlight reels may focus on senior guard Julius
Barnes' 29 points, but it was the Cardinal's big men who
sealed the deal. Stanford locked down on the offensive and
defensive glass in the second half, controlling the ball for 86
straight seconds late in the game, courtesy of three offensive
rebounds, before 6-8 Mike Jensen — Washington's tallest
starter — finally regained possession for the Huskies.
In the second half, Stanford outrebounded Washington
by a stunning 20-7 margin, including 10 offensive boards.
In the first half, though, Washington's quickness and fresh
legs kept pace with the Cardinal. Diminutive point guard
Nate Robinson parlayed a variety of high-arcing lay-ups in 10
first-half points on 5-7 shooting, off guard Curtis Allen scored
nine on 3-5 shooting, and junior forward Doug Wrenn used
a variety of clever moves to post 16 first-half points on 7-9
shooting.
"Washington is quick," Stanford head coach Mike Monto
gomery said. "Curtis Allen and Nate Robinson consistently
split us and got inside and shot those floaters, and they didn't
miss many."
The Cardinal also had trouble holding on to the ball in the
first half, as the Huskies used their speed and quick hands to
force turnovers. Despite their size disadvantage, the Huskies
managed to grab the same number of first-half rebounds as
Stanford (14).
Washington finished the first half on a 22-7 run, as Robin
son and Allen slashed to the basket and Wrenn frustrated the
Cardinal big men.
"These were the best minutes we've had on the road [this
season]," Washington head coach Lorenzo Romar said.
Junior forward Justin Davis explained: "I played real pas
sive on Wrenn, and the coaches got on me about that."
However, Stanford learned a few lessons in its Jan. 18 loss
at Washington, and in the second half, they wore down the
Huskies.
"Last game, at their place, they
were quicker to the ball, we
couldn't box out, and the were
beating us down the court because
of that," freshman point guard
Jason Haas said. "Tonight we did a
better job at boxing out and getting
back on defense."
Romar noted a different reason
for the Huskies' slower tempo this
game.
"They made shots," he said.
"When the ball goes in the basket,
you can't get out and run."
Despite its quickness, Washing
ton found itself unable to stop

Barnes, who got open look after
open look en route to 29 points on
9-18 shooting, including 6-12 be
hind the arc.
"What Julius does is — and we
talked about this [in practice] — he
continues to back up," Romar said.
"At 21 feet you put your hand out,
and at 23 feet, you're thinking,
okay, I'll just sit back and contain
him, but he's still looking to shoot
it."
Barnes' starring role was set up
by a strong supporting cast,
though.
"They outrebounded us in the
second half by a large margin,"
Romar said. "[Then] they went in
side to [sophomore center Rob]
Little and Davis and that helped
break the game open."
Davis played 25 minutes, his

most extended action since return
ing from a knee injury, and collect
ed six boards and nine points.
" Justin gave us a lift with some
hustle plays," Montgomery said.
"He got a couple charges, which
were huge."
The Cardinal interior also
slowed the Husky guards late in the
game, as Washington appeared
tired.
While Allen and Robinson fin
ished with strong lines, guard Will
Conroy — the Huskies' leading
scorer this season at 13.3 points per
game — managed just two points
in the game on l-for-6 shooting.
"Their quickness is not some
thing you can change, "Mont
gomery said. "[But] I thought we
played better defense in the second
half."
