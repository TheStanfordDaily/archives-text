# Card looks for a confidence boost

Usually in mid-February, the
Stanford baseball team can grab
its checklist and run down its
items fairly quickly.

Whoops. Usually, the Cardinal
(3-5) get to shower February with
sound bytes detailing the confi
dence built by beating top compe
tition early in the season and how
those wins help it barrel straight
into the conference schedule.
With five losses in its last six
games, the 2003 Stanford squad is
in unfamiliar territory heading
into its annual non-conference
match up with Fresno State this

weekend at Sunken Diamond.
"We've been fortunate in past
years to win against top caliber
teams early in the season," coach
Mark Marquess said. "But when
you play good teams and you don't
win big spots or you make a couple
of mistakes. . .there's a good
chance you're going to get beat.
And that's what we've done this
year."
The No. 11 Cardinal hosts the
Bulldogs (1-3) in the midst of a
seven-game homestand that began
with a series loss to No. 3 Florida
State last weekend and will con
clude with a single game on Mon
day against Nevada. The four
game stretch against two oppo
nents far below the talent level that
Fullerton and Florida State
brought to the table gives Stanford
an opportunity to gain important
momentum as it heads towards
next weekend's highly anticipated
road series against defending na
tional champion No. 4 Texas.
Until Sunday's series Finale

against the Seminoles, a 10-8
extra-inning loss, the Cardinal's
woes had been mainly due to a
lack of timely production at the
plate. The hits have come for
Stanford this season — the Cardi
nal have out-hit opponents 83-59
thus far — they just haven't come
at the right times.
"We're just leaving a ton of
guys on base," Marquess said. "It's
just one of those things. You'd
love to be critical, but we've really
hit the ball well. We just haven't
put our hits together."
Avefaging 4.6 runs per game
will not get the job done against
top-10 competition but may be
enough to topple Fresno State, es
