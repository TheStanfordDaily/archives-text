# Card looks for a confidence boost

Usually in mid-February, the
Stanford baseball team can grab
its checklist and run down its
items fairly quickly.

Whoops. Usually, the Cardinal
(3-5) get to shower February with
sound bytes detailing the confi

tition early in the season and how
those wins help it barrel straight
into the conference schedule.
With five losses in its last six
games, the 2003 Stanford squad is
in unfamiliar territory heading
into its annual non-conference
match up with Fresno State this

weekend at Sunken Diamond.
"We've been fortunate in past
years to win against top caliber
teams early in the season," coach
Mark Marquess said. "But when
you play good teams and you don't
win big spots or you make a couple
of mistakes. . .there's a good
chance you're going to get beat.
And that's what we've done this
year."
The No. 11 Cardinal hosts the
Bulldogs (1-3) in the midst of a
seven-game homestand that began
with a series loss to No. 3 Florida
State last weekend and will con
clude with a single game on Mon
day against Nevada. The four
game stretch against two oppo
nents far below the talent level that
Fullerton and Florida State
brought to the table gives Stanford
an opportunity to gain important
momentum as it heads towards
next weekend's highly anticipated
road series against defending na
tional champion No. 4 Texas.
Until Sunday's series Finale

against the Seminoles, a 10-8
extra-inning loss, the Cardinal's
woes had been mainly due to a
lack of timely production at the
plate. The hits have come for
Stanford this season — the Cardi
nal have out-hit opponents 83-59
thus far — they just haven't come
at the right times.
"We're just leaving a ton of
guys on base," Marquess said. "It's
just one of those things. You'd
love to be critical, but we've really
hit the ball well. We just haven't
put our hits together."

da State rallies rather than an of
fensive onslaught.
"Most games are won and lost
in three or four big spots fora
pitcher in a game," Marquess
said. "Can you stem the flow? Can
you get the big out when you
need it? You just have to really
put it together and do it at the
right time."
That problem aside, most of
Stanford's encouraging signs
have come on the mound. Se
nior ace John Hudgins struck
out 10 batters, a career high, in a
nine-inning performance to
help the Cardinal to a 2-1, 12-in
ning win last Friday night. As
Stanford's top starter this sea

son, Hudgins is now 1-0 with a
2.57 ERA and, most important
ly, he has compiled 19 strikeouts
against just one walk in his three
starts.
"I thought Hudgins' outing
[against Florida State] was as
good as a Jeremy Guthrie or a
Jason Young for pitching nine
quality innings against a tough
opponent in February," Mar
quess said.
Relieving Hudgins in that con
test was freshman hurler Mark
Romanczuk, who took the ball for
three innings without allowing a
run to earn his first collegiate vic
tory. Romanczuk has allowed just
one hit in 5 1/3 innings this season
and should play an increasingly
larger role for Stanford as the
weeks pass.
Sophomore Billy Paganetti,
who did not throw a single pitch

for Stanford in 2002, also record
ed a positive outing for the Cardi
nal in Saturday's 4-3 loss. Pa
ganetti retired the first seven bat
ters he faced and allowed just one
run on no hits in his first Stanford
appearance.
Starting tonight, the Cardinal
must continue those trends and
take advantage of a Fresno State
squad that in many ways is start
ing over in 2003. The Bulldogs
have a new coach after 34-year
veteran Dick Bennett retired last
season, five new starters in the
field and a brand new starting ro
tation.
Fresno State has hit just .172
in its First four games and should
provide just the type of catalyst
the Cardinal need as they pre
pare to take on three more top
-10 opponents in the coming
month.

Whoops. Usually, the Cardinal
(3-5) get to shower February with
sound bytes detailing the confi
dence built by beating top compe
tition early in the season and how
those wins help it barrel straight
into the conference schedule.
With five losses in its last six
games, the 2003 Stanford squad is
in unfamiliar territory heading
into its annual non-conference
match up with Fresno State this

weekend at Sunken Diamond.
"We've been fortunate in past
years to win against top caliber
teams early in the season," coach
Mark Marquess said. "But when
you play good teams and you don't
win big spots or you make a couple
of mistakes. . .there's a good
chance you're going to get beat.
And that's what we've done this
year."
The No. 11 Cardinal hosts the
Bulldogs (1-3) in the midst of a
seven-game homestand that began
with a series loss to No. 3 Florida
State last weekend and will con
clude with a single game on Mon
day against Nevada. The four
game stretch against two oppo
nents far below the talent level that
Fullerton and Florida State
brought to the table gives Stanford
an opportunity to gain important
momentum as it heads towards
next weekend's highly anticipated
road series against defending na
tional champion No. 4 Texas.
Until Sunday's series Finale

against the Seminoles, a 10-8
extra-inning loss, the Cardinal's
woes had been mainly due to a
lack of timely production at the
plate. The hits have come for
Stanford this season — the Cardi
nal have out-hit opponents 83-59
thus far — they just haven't come
at the right times.
"We're just leaving a ton of
guys on base," Marquess said. "It's
just one of those things. You'd
love to be critical, but we've really
hit the ball well. We just haven't
put our hits together."

da State rallies rather than an of
fensive onslaught.
"Most games are won and lost
in three or four big spots fora
pitcher in a game," Marquess
said. "Can you stem the flow? Can
you get the big out when you
need it? You just have to really
put it together and do it at the
right time."
That problem aside, most of
Stanford's encouraging signs
have come on the mound. Se
nior ace John Hudgins struck
out 10 batters, a career high, in a
nine-inning performance to
help the Cardinal to a 2-1, 12-in
ning win last Friday night. As
Stanford's top starter this sea

son, Hudgins is now 1-0 with a
2.57 ERA and, most important
ly, he has compiled 19 strikeouts
against just one walk in his three
starts.
"I thought Hudgins' outing
[against Florida State] was as
good as a Jeremy Guthrie or a
Jason Young for pitching nine
quality innings against a tough
opponent in February," Mar
quess said.
Relieving Hudgins in that con
test was freshman hurler Mark
Romanczuk, who took the ball for
three innings without allowing a
run to earn his first collegiate vic
tory. Romanczuk has allowed just
one hit in 5 1/3 innings this season
and should play an increasingly
larger role for Stanford as the
weeks pass.
Sophomore Billy Paganetti,
who did not throw a single pitch

for Stanford in 2002, also record
ed a positive outing for the Cardi
nal in Saturday's 4-3 loss. Pa
ganetti retired the first seven bat
ters he faced and allowed just one
run on no hits in his first Stanford
appearance.
Starting tonight, the Cardinal
must continue those trends and
take advantage of a Fresno State
squad that in many ways is start
ing over in 2003. The Bulldogs
have a new coach after 34-year
veteran Dick Bennett retired last
season, five new starters in the
field and a brand new starting ro
tation.
Fresno State has hit just .172
in its First four games and should
