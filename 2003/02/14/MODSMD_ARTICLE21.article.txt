# Loss to the Huskies hard to swallow
## 
### MARUEEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With just under six minutes to go
in last night's matchup against
Washington, Stanford women's bas
ketball head coach Tara Van-
Derveer emptied out her bench.
Unfortunately the freshmen and re
serves weren't entering to close out
another Stanford blowout, rather
they entered the game to prevent
the Cardinal starters from the threat
of injury in a game already well out
of Stanford's control.
As the final buzzer sounded, die
Cardinal found itself in a position it
hadn't been in a very long time â€”
down 24 points. The Huskies 92-68
win handed Stanford its worse Pacif
ic- 10 Conference loss since 1991.
"[I am] furious," said Van
derveer. "It is not about losing. I just
felt our team missed the opportuni
ty to play much better. There was a
defeatist attitude. It wasn't an in
spired effort."
Washington head coach June
Daugherty had a slighdy different
take on the evening's contest. Espe
cially after two road losses at Arizona
and Arizona State last weekend, a
win over the No. 6 Cardinal might
be just what her team needed to as
sure itself a spot among the Pac-10
elite.
"Pretty fun stuff," she said. "I
think it makes a statement. We beat
a very good team."
While everyone expected the
Huskies to be draining 3-pointers,
even the most spirited Washington
fan could have predicted the dam
age the team would do from beyond
the arch.
The team hit an astounding 13 3-
pointers, with eight different players
on the roster coming up big from
downtown.
"All year we have been in the top
of the country in scoring, field-goal
percentage, I wasn't too concerned
about the offense," said Daugherty.
"We were able to get some good
looks."
Junior Giulianna Mendiola set
the tone for Washington, leading
the team with a 4-for-5 mark from
the 3-point line, 20 points and seven
assists. Junior center Andrea Lalum

chipped in 14 points for die Huskies,
while senior Loree Payne added 13.
But while Washington's 3-point
offense was detrimental, its defense
proved devastating to the Cardinal.
From the opening tip the Huskies
showed a fierceness that was defi
nitely absent from dieir earlier stint
in Palo Alto.
At the Farm, the Cardinal out-re
bounded the Huskies 53-26, de
stroying dieir opportunities for criti
cal second-chance baskets, and al

lowing themselves to overcome what
would otherwise have been consid
ered a poor shooting night.
Last night Washington grabbed
37 boards to the Cardinal's 28, an
impressive feat especially consider
ing the Huskies 54.7 percent field
goal percentage.
While the main event was the
showdown between two of the Pac
10's best teams, an entertaining side

leaders in 3-pointers per game and 3-point percentage.
