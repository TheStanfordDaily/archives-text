# Loss to the Huskies hard to swallow
## 
### MARUEEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With just under six minutes to go
in last night's matchup against
Washington, Stanford women's bas
ketball head coach Tara Van-
Derveer emptied out her bench.
Unfortunately the freshmen and re
serves weren't entering to close out
another Stanford blowout, rather
they entered the game to prevent
the Cardinal starters from the threat
of injury in a game already well out
of Stanford's control.
As the final buzzer sounded, die
Cardinal found itself in a position it
hadn't been in a very long time â€”
down 24 points. The Huskies 92-68
win handed Stanford its worse Pacif
ic- 10 Conference loss since 1991.
"[I am] furious," said Van
derveer. "It is not about losing. I just
felt our team missed the opportuni
ty to play much better. There was a
defeatist attitude. It wasn't an in
spired effort."
Washington head coach June
Daugherty had a slighdy different
take on the evening's contest. Espe
cially after two road losses at Arizona
and Arizona State last weekend, a
win over the No. 6 Cardinal might
be just what her team needed to as
sure itself a spot among the Pac-10
elite.
"Pretty fun stuff," she said. "I
think it makes a statement. We beat
a very good team."
While everyone expected the
Huskies to be draining 3-pointers,
even the most spirited Washington
fan could have predicted the dam
age the team would do from beyond
the arch.
The team hit an astounding 13 3-
pointers, with eight different players
on the roster coming up big from
downtown.
"All year we have been in the top
of the country in scoring, field-goal
percentage, I wasn't too concerned
about the offense," said Daugherty.
"We were able to get some good
looks."
Junior Giulianna Mendiola set
the tone for Washington, leading
the team with a 4-for-5 mark from
the 3-point line, 20 points and seven
assists. Junior center Andrea Lalum

chipped in 14 points for die Huskies,
while senior Loree Payne added 13.
But while Washington's 3-point
offense was detrimental, its defense
proved devastating to the Cardinal.
From the opening tip the Huskies
showed a fierceness that was defi
nitely absent from dieir earlier stint
in Palo Alto.
At the Farm, the Cardinal out-re
bounded the Huskies 53-26, de
stroying dieir opportunities for criti
cal second-chance baskets, and al

lowing themselves to overcome what
would otherwise have been consid
ered a poor shooting night.
Last night Washington grabbed
37 boards to the Cardinal's 28, an
impressive feat especially consider
ing the Huskies 54.7 percent field
goal percentage.
While the main event was the
showdown between two of the Pac
10's best teams, an entertaining side

leaders in 3-pointers per game and 3-point percentage.
show was the showdown of two of
the conference's best players: Wash
ington's Mendiola and Stanford ju
nior Nicole Powell. Powell, the 2002
Pac-10 Player of the Year, is receiv
ing significant competition from
Mendiola if she hopes to repeat the
tide.
Mendiola is currendy averaging a
conference-leading 5.4 assists, in ad
dition to sitting at No. 2 scoring, and
No. 5 in rebounds.
While the Husky junior put up
big statistics for Washington this
evening, Powell didn't exacdy con
cede defeat. She chipped in a team
leading 20 points for the Cardinal, in
addition to her eight rebounds and
four assists. In addition, Powell was

able to come in and tally some big
plays, including back-to-back 3-
pointers to rally die Cardinal at die
end of the first half .
"She's a good player; obviously
she's very good," said Daugherty of
the Stanford forward. "She's so
lengthy at 6-foot-2 and very strong
about going to die boards."
But at the end of the evening in
dividual performances were far
from Powell's mind.
"There were so many things we
just didn't do as a team," she said.
"There were so many negatives we
couldn't overcome. I just hope we
come out and learn from all the
things we didn't do well."
Stanford travels to Pullman on
Saturday for another Pac-10 contest
against Washington State. The
Cougars tallied Uiere first win of the
season last night widi a win over Cal
ifornia.
