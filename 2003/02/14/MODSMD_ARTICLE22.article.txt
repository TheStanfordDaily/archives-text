## Shaw goes for 500 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you want to find out what the defin
ition of success in athletics is, asking
men's volleyball coach Don Shaw would
be a good place to start.

Men's Volleyball
vs. Long Beach State, tonight, 7 p.m.
vs. UC San Diego, Saturday, 7 p.m.

His 19-plus years of head coaching ex
perience includes 16 seasons with the
Cardinal women and he has amassed a
total of 499 wins and a winning percent
age of .819.
On Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavil
ion, Shaw will be shooting for his 500 th
win, as the No. 7 Cardinal (6-6, 4-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
takes on No. 6 Long Beach State (7-6, 3-
5 MPSF). On Saturday, the team is pitted
against UC-San Diego (3-8, 0-7 MPSF).
In his tenure with the women's pro
gram, Shaw compiled an .863 winning
percentage (440-70), ranking him as the
winningest coach in NCAA history.
The list of Shaw's accolades is seeming
ly endless, including four NCAA champi
onships, 10 conference championships
featuring a run of six straight from 1994-
1999 and National Women's Coach of the
Year honors in 1991 and 1997.
In tandem with Fred Sturm, Shaw
turned a completely unknown Stanford
program into a national volleyball pow
erhouse.
"The most challenging part [of my
coaching career] was when I had just start
ed here," Shaw said. "Fred Sturm, who
had hired me, and I were the only coaches
for the men's and the women's teams. So
the challenge was training two teams on a
year-round basis. In those days you were
really flying by the seat of your pants."
Shaw came on at Stanford in 1980 as

an assistant coach to Sturm for both the
men's and women's team.
After the two shared duties in 1984
and 1985, Shaw went solo with the
women's team in 1986. Even with all the
past success, he can still remember Stan
ford volleyball's growing pains.
"I've been very fortunate that there
are a lot of things to celebrate along the
way," Shaw said. "We weren't always get
ting all those wins. [The men's team]
went through a stretch that I can remem
ber where at one time we lost 24 or 25 out
of 26 matches and it was with a team that
played really hard, never gave up. We
gave it everything we had every night
and it was like every night we walked out
of that gym totally exhausted from giving
our all, but we still couldn't come up with
any wins."
When asked about his most memo
rable win, he cannot help but mention his
national championships, but also fondly
describes a game that he considers a
turning point in his career.
"I'll remember the first time [the
women's team] beat Pacific," Shaw said.
"They were a real power in women's vol
leyball in the 1980s. They were the North
ern California power and at that time that
we beat them, we were in Maples, we
didn't even have all the bleachers out and
we won 17-15 in the fifth game. Just a
knock-down drag-out unbelievable match
and I remember finally winning that
game and beating those guys. I remember
that win as one that made our program
feel very legitimate."
Reaching 500 wins is a milestone that
Shaw will cherish, but his best moments
in coaching have come when he is able to
reflect upon his impact on his players'
lives.
"The key thing is when a player who
has been in the program comes back and
says 'thanks' later on," Shaw said. "I think
that's what really makes you feel good.
