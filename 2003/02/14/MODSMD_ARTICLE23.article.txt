### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Cardinal women's swim
ming and diving team (7-2, 3-1 Pac-10)
heads up to Berkeley on Saturday for its
last in a slew of Pacific-10 meets and with
the hopes of tallying a win against its
cross-bay rivals, the Golden Bears. How
ever, defeating Cal could prove a lot eas
ier said than done.

at No. 9 California, Saturday, 12 p.m.

According to coach Richard Quick,
No. 9 California (8-2,3-1 Pac-10) is one of
a pair of challenging teams in the confer
ence, and it will take a feat of strength
from the Stanford women to pull out a
victory.
The ability to defeat California is defi
nitely within the Cardinal team. That was
proven two weekends ago when the team
united in an amazing frenzy of spectacu
lar swimming to overtake the tough
Southern California swimmers.
But though the Trojans are a deeper
team than the Bears, Cal boasts a swim
mer that, at the beginning of the season,
Quick called "probably the best swimmer
in the NCAA, maybe one of the best the
NCAA has ever seen."
That swimmer, junior Natalie Cough
lin, holds American records in the 100-
yard butterfly and the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke.
Coughlin's consistent dominance will
makes it crucial for the Cardinal team to

snap up the second and third place fin
ishes in order to maintain a higher team
score.
Stanford will be relying as usual on
their most consistent swimmers to rack
up victories. Junior Tara Kirk, sopho
more Lacey Boutwell, and freshmen
Dana Kirk and Kristen Caverly are con
sistently coming through with wins.
The Cardinal will also be hoping to dis
play the same depth in each race that it

showed in the dual meet with the Los An
geles teams. That is going to require re
peats of some stellar performances from
sophomores Kirsten Gilbert, Amy Wagn
er and Tami Ransom.
No matter the outcome of this final
regular-season meet, the two teams will
have a chance to face off again in another
two weeks, when all of the Pat-10 teams
meet up for conference championships
in Washington.
