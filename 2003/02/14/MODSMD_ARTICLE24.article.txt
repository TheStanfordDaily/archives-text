# Softball to host tough foursome
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the No. 14 Stanford
softball team (5-2) will host its own tour
nament here on the Farm for the first
time in the history of the program.

Softball
Stanford Invitational Tournament, today vs.
Penn State, 3:30 p.m., Saturday vs. Missouri,
1:15 p.m., Sunday, TBA.

"We are very excited to host our first
Stanford Invitational," coach John
Rittman said. "We are also really excited
to have four outstanding teams partici
pating in the tournament, including
some schools with a lot of tradition. It
should be a really neat weekend for soft
ball."
The three teams that will be joining
the Cardinal in this weekend's invitation
al are Penn State, Missouri (4-1), and
Kentucky (1-4).
Stanford heads into this weekend
eager to duplicate its strong performance
at last week's ASU Fiesta Bowl.
The competition will begin in a pool
play format this afternoon. The teams
will then be seeded and battle each other
until the championship Sunday at noon.
And, although Stanford is the only na
tionally ranked squad featured in the in
vitational, the Cardinal knows that it will

need to perform its best in order to take
the tide.
The Cardinal will begin its hunt for
the championship Friday in a face-off
against Penn State.
The last time the two teams took the
field together was last winter at the
Speedline Invitational in Florida where
the Nittany Lions put up quite a fight be
fore falling to the Cardinal.
This year's Penn State team is untest
ed as the Stanford Invitational will serve
as its season opener. Returning senior
Gina P>ianchini is expected to be the Nit
tany Lion to watch out for at the plate, but
the Stanford staff will be ready.
Senior pitcher Tori Nyberg leads the
Cardinal into this weekend having
recorded four starts and four wins so far
this season. She has allowed just one
earned run in 22 innings on the rubber.
Stanford fans can also count on seeing
junior Dana Sorensen more and more as
the season progresses, as the Ail-Ameri
can eases back into the circle following a
medical redshirt season.
"We are going to gradually increase
Dana's innings," Rittman said. "She will
probably get a couple of starts this week
end. We are going to monitor her and
make sure she is healthy. We don't want
to overuse her early on, so you will see
her pitch a little bit more this weekend."
Also expected to pitch for the Cardinal
this weekend are senior Maureen

LeCocq and freshman Laura Severson.
This deep Stanford staff will be chal
lenged later in the day by a Kentucky
team eager to steal a win from the Cardi
nal.
Kentucky is coming off of a disap
pointing weekend at the Florida Interna
tional Fun & Sun Classic in which it fin
ished with a 1-4 record. The Wildcats de
feated the host school 3-2, but fell twice to
Illinois State and Georgia.
Rachel Friberg held the hot bat for
Kentucky last weekend, as she hit .357
with a double, home run and four RBI.
Friberg's was not the only hot bat this
past weekend, as Stanford's offense came
alive at the plate as well. The entire Car
dinal lineup contributed to the 4-1 per
formance while down in Arizona.
"We were a lot more aggressive at the
plate this weekend," Rittman said. "We
weren't getting as deep in to counts. We
did get shut down in one game against
Fullerton, but I think we bounced back
well. I was really impressed with the way
our kids battled at the plate and made ad
justments."
Freshman shortstop Lauren Lappin
led the Cardinal at the plate last week
end, going 9-for-17 (.529) in five games
and scoring four runs.
Lappin was accompanied by the rest
of the Cardinal bats when they exploded
against SW Texas, as senior sec
ond baseman Kira Ching hit two
long balls and finished 2-for-4
with three RBI. Senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham recorded a
grand slam against the Bobcats
and junior catcher Jessica Allister
also hit a solo shot.
Ching and Allister then contin
ued their hot hitting with home
runs on Sunday versus Texas
Tech.
Trying to tame this aggressive
Stanford offense will be task of the
Missouri Tigers tomorrow at 1:15
p.m.
"We are going to try to get our
selves to play and worry about
what we need to do, rather than
focus on our opponents," Rittman
said.
Missouri will try and get some
revenge from the Cardinal as they
travel out west following a 4-1
showing at the Auburn Invitation
al last weekend. The Tigers beat
Mercer, Tennessee Chattanooga
twice and split with Auburn.
The Tigers are led at the plate
by Rachael McGinnis who is hit
ting .500 with four doubles and a
triple.

softball team (5-2) will host its own tour

medical redshirt season.
"We are going to gradually increase
Dana's innings," Rittman said. "She will
probably get a couple of starts this week
end. We are going to monitor her and
make sure she is healthy. We don't want
to overuse her early on, so you will see
her pitch a little bit more this weekend."
Also expected to pitch for the Cardinal
this weekend are senior Maureen

LeCocq and freshman Laura Severson.
This deep Stanford staff will be chal
lenged later in the day by a Kentucky
team eager to steal a win from the Cardi
nal.
Kentucky is coming off of a disap
pointing weekend at the Florida Interna
tional Fun & Sun Classic in which it fin
ished with a 1-4 record. The Wildcats de
feated the host school 3-2, but fell twice to
Illinois State and Georgia.
Rachel Friberg held the hot bat for
Kentucky last weekend, as she hit .357
with a double, home run and four RBI.
Friberg's was not the only hot bat this
past weekend, as Stanford's offense came
alive at the plate as well. The entire Car
dinal lineup contributed to the 4-1 per
formance while down in Arizona.
"We were a lot more aggressive at the
plate this weekend," Rittman said. "We
weren't getting as deep in to counts. We
did get shut down in one game against
Fullerton, but I think we bounced back
well. I was really impressed with the way
our kids battled at the plate and made ad
justments."
Freshman shortstop Lauren Lappin
led the Cardinal at the plate last week
end, going 9-for-17 (.529) in five games
and scoring four runs.
Lappin was accompanied by the rest
of the Cardinal bats when they exploded
against SW Texas, as senior sec
ond baseman Kira Ching hit two
long balls and finished 2-for-4
with three RBI. Senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham recorded a
grand slam against the Bobcats
and junior catcher Jessica Allister
also hit a solo shot.
Ching and Allister then contin
ued their hot hitting with home
runs on Sunday versus Texas
Tech.
Trying to tame this aggressive
Stanford offense will be task of the
Missouri Tigers tomorrow at 1:15
p.m.
"We are going to try to get our
selves to play and worry about
what we need to do, rather than
focus on our opponents," Rittman
said.
Missouri will try and get some
revenge from the Cardinal as they
travel out west following a 4-1
showing at the Auburn Invitation
al last weekend. The Tigers beat
Mercer, Tennessee Chattanooga
twice and split with Auburn.
The Tigers are led at the plate
by Rachael McGinnis who is hit
ting .500 with four doubles and a
triple.
