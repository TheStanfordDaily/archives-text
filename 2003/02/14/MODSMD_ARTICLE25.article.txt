# Wrestling closes out season this weekend
## PENSON REFLECTS ON HIS STANFORD CAREER 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Asked to recall the most memorable
moment of his Stanford wrestling career,
fifth-year senior Harold Penson pauses for
a few seconds before reminiscing.
"That would have to be my first varsity
match here against Oregon," Penson said.
"I won it against a senior and that's special
to me because now I'm a senior. I just have
to keep in mind what I did as a freshman
to another senior."

Indoor Wrestung
vs. UC-Davis, tonight, 7 p. m.
vs. Fresno State, Sunday, 7 p.m

The Richmond Heights, Ohio native
has posted over 50 wins since then and can
add to that total tonight as Stanford (3-10,
1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) plays host to
UC-Davis at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal closes out its regular season
against conference foe Fresno State on
Sunday, also at home.
After recording just four wins his fresh
man year, Penson piled up 17 and 18 wins
in his sophomore and junior seasons, re
spectively, as quietly as his soft-spoken de
meanor. In this, his final season, he has
grappled with his heightened role as a tri
captain and as the lone senior on the team,
in addition to opponents on the mat.
"I guess I have felt some pressure just in
the fact that this is my last year and 1 want
to go out right," Penson said. "I also want
to be able to take on the leadership re
sponsibilities that being a fifth-year senior
entails. I'm not a very vocal guy so I'm try
ing to find other ways to lead; on the mat,

in practice or just talking to the guys one
on-one."
By contrast, Penson is an adept and
avid listener, donning headphones during
warm-ups before every match to take in a
variety of tunes.
"A lot of times in the past it's been Nas
and Jay-Z," Penson said. "I play their ri
valry songs back to back and try to get hype
off of that. Sometimes I'll slow it down and
listen to some jazz or some Sam Cooke, de
pending on the mood. But recently it's
been Jay-Z and whatnot."
Whatever it's been of late, it's worked.
Following a slow start to the season, Pen
son has returned to leadership-type form
down the stretch with two straight dual
meet wins and a third-place finish at the All
Cal Invitational.
His performance at the All Cal was par
ticularly impressive, as he earned a major
decision over Bakersfield's Matthew Mon
tiero in the third-place match after losing
to him earlier in the day.
After spending the past two years at 184
pounds, Penson entered this season at 184
pounds. He credits his success in the sec
ond-half of the season to readjusting to the
weight he started at his freshman year.
"I've gotten used to being a 174-pounder
again," Penson said. "At 184,1 always felt a
little sluggish. Once I got acclimated at 174
I felt lighter on my feet and more in attack
mode."
I he change has translated to more
wins, including many in the biggest way. A
team-leading six of Penson's 14 wins have
been in the form of a pin this season.
In his five years on the Farm, Penson
has witnessed his fair share of wrestlers
come and go, but isn't wrapped up in the
emotion one might think would come with

wrestling in his final two home meets.
"I'm not really thinking about that as
pect so much," Penson said. "Since I'm the
only senior, there's no real final-goodbye
feeling. I'm on a team with a bunch of
young guys who have a lot to look forward
to. And I look forward to their future, too,
so I'm not really looking back right now."
Some of those young guys will also try to
close out the regular season with a couple
of wins, including freshman Shawn
Ritzenthaler who has started all season at
heavyweight.
Meanwhile, redshirt sophomore Matt
Gently, a veteran by the team's standards,
enters the weekend with a 25-5 record and
looks to continue his dominance over Pac
-10 opponents in dual meets. He has not lost
to a conference opponent in a dual meet
since the first bout of his freshman year.
Fellow 2002 NCAA qualifiers junior
Nathan Peterson and sophomore Brad
Metzler look to wrap up successful regular
seasons with a couple more wins and head
into the postseason with some momen
tum.
After Sunday, Penson and the Cardinal
will enjoy a two-week break before the Pac
-10 Championships, to be held March 2-3
in Boise, Idaho.
"Performing well at Pac-10s is extreme
ly important to me but I'm in no way look
ing past these two dual meets," Penson
said. "They'll help gauge my future per
formance at the Pac-10s and my readiness
to go on to nationals."
It's often said that it's not how you start,
but how you finish. This weekend, Penson
has the opportunity, and would like noth
ing more than, to end his collegiate dual
meet career exactly how he began it more
than four years ago: with a win.

Senior Harold Penson looks to improve on his 14 wins this season — three of which have
come in dual meets — as the wrestling team closes out its regular season at home
Asked to recall the most memorable
moment of his Stanford wrestling career,
fifth-year senior Harold Penson pauses for
a few seconds before reminiscing.
"That would have to be my first varsity
match here against Oregon," Penson said.
"I won it against a senior and that's special
to me because now I'm a senior. I just have
to keep in mind what I did as a freshman
to another senior."

Indoor Wrestung
vs. UC-Davis, tonight, 7 p. m.
vs. Fresno State, Sunday, 7 p.m

The Richmond Heights, Ohio native
has posted over 50 wins since then and can
add to that total tonight as Stanford (3-10,
1-5 Pacific-10 Conference) plays host to
UC-Davis at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal closes out its regular season
against conference foe Fresno State on
Sunday, also at home.
After recording just four wins his fresh
man year, Penson piled up 17 and 18 wins
in his sophomore and junior seasons, re
spectively, as quietly as his soft-spoken de
meanor. In this, his final season, he has
grappled with his heightened role as a tri
captain and as the lone senior on the team,
in addition to opponents on the mat.
"I guess I have felt some pressure just in
the fact that this is my last year and 1 want
to go out right," Penson said. "I also want
to be able to take on the leadership re
sponsibilities that being a fifth-year senior
entails. I'm not a very vocal guy so I'm try
ing to find other ways to lead; on the mat,

in practice or just talking to the guys one
on-one."
By contrast, Penson is an adept and
avid listener, donning headphones during
warm-ups before every match to take in a
variety of tunes.
"A lot of times in the past it's been Nas
and Jay-Z," Penson said. "I play their ri
valry songs back to back and try to get hype
off of that. Sometimes I'll slow it down and
listen to some jazz or some Sam Cooke, de
pending on the mood. But recently it's
been Jay-Z and whatnot."
Whatever it's been of late, it's worked.
Following a slow start to the season, Pen
son has returned to leadership-type form
down the stretch with two straight dual
meet wins and a third-place finish at the All
Cal Invitational.
His performance at the All Cal was par
ticularly impressive, as he earned a major
decision over Bakersfield's Matthew Mon
tiero in the third-place match after losing
to him earlier in the day.
After spending the past two years at 184
pounds, Penson entered this season at 184
pounds. He credits his success in the sec
ond-half of the season to readjusting to the
weight he started at his freshman year.
"I've gotten used to being a 174-pounder
again," Penson said. "At 184,1 always felt a
little sluggish. Once I got acclimated at 174
I felt lighter on my feet and more in attack
mode."
I he change has translated to more
wins, including many in the biggest way. A
team-leading six of Penson's 14 wins have
been in the form of a pin this season.
In his five years on the Farm, Penson
has witnessed his fair share of wrestlers
come and go, but isn't wrapped up in the
emotion one might think would come with

wrestling in his final two home meets.
"I'm not really thinking about that as
pect so much," Penson said. "Since I'm the
only senior, there's no real final-goodbye
feeling. I'm on a team with a bunch of
young guys who have a lot to look forward
to. And I look forward to their future, too,
so I'm not really looking back right now."
Some of those young guys will also try to
close out the regular season with a couple
of wins, including freshman Shawn
Ritzenthaler who has started all season at
heavyweight.

Gently, a veteran by the team's standards,
