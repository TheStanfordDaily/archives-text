# 'Vagina Monologues' opens
## V-day play will discuss gender 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In honor of "V-Day," a global movement to stop
violence against women, a cast of 20 Stanford grad
uate and undergraduate students will perform Eve
Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues" today and to
morrow, coinciding with Valentine's Day.
The performances will take place tonight at 8
p.m. and on Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium.
The Obie award-winning "The Vagina Mono
logues" explores women's experiences with their
sexuality — and their vaginas. Ensler's play inspired
the birth of V-Day, an event celebrated on Valen
tine's Day on 1,000 college campuses worldwide.
Stanford's show is a benefit performance spon
sored by V-Day, a non-profit corporation that aims
to put an end to rape, battery, incest and female gen
ital mutilation.
Senior Kendra Arimoto, director of this year's
"The Vagina Monologues," highlighted the impor
tance of V-day's date.
"V-Day takes place on February 14th to show that
Valentine's Day is about more than giving gifts,"
Arimoto said.
She explained that the V in "V-Day" has a host of
different meanings: it stands for vagina, victory, vio
lence-free and Valentine's. On its Web site, the V-
Day organization describes its mission as "victory
over violence" — a time when women will no longer
be sexually abused.
This year marks the fifth anniversary of V-Day at
Stanford. In honor of the occasion, the Women's
Community Center has hosted a number of educa
tional campaigns to promote awareness about do
mestic assault. These include the establishment of a
University-wide rape-free zone and the Silent Wit
ness Campaign. The "witnesses" are 20 life-sized fig
ures bearing written true stories of abuse on their
chests.
Arimoto stressed the necessity of V-Day at places
like Stanford.
"The lack of knowledge on college campuses is
truly scary," she said. "Our aim this week is to define
questions concerning sexual abuse and violence as
well as to start providing answers. I really do believe

that we will arrive at answers."
She pointed out that V-day isn't just for women.
"We're trying to make it clear that violence is an
issue in different types of relationships," she said.
"The educational campaigns we've set up are meant
to appeal to a wide group of people."
"Vagina Week" will draw to a close with the per
formances of "The Vagina Monologues" in Kresge.
Theater-goers will first pass through the Vagina Art
Gallery in the lobby.
Freshman Natalie Ruiz is looking forward to Fri
day night's performance.
"I went to see Eve Ensler's talk this fall, and after
hearing her speak, I was interested to see more,"
Ruiz said. "Before going to the talk, I'd heard of'The
Vagina Monologues,' but I didn't know what they

were about. Ensler performed a section of the play
and it was hilarious."
Arimoto said the audience is an integral part of
the show.
"I would say that the audience is 60 to 70 per
cent a part of the performance," she said. "At first,
they're always reluctant to get involved. But then
you start to feel the energy. By the end they're
practically screaming. It's amazing to see and hear
the change."
"The Vagina Monologues" is intended fora di
verse group of people.
"You'd think it would be a room full of women,"
Arimoto said. "But it attracts a diverse audience.
Old and young, male and female — you see every
body. My dad saw it last year and so did my 14-year

old brother."
Arimoto, who acted in " Ihe Vagina Mono
logues" last year, said that the show helps actors
find their voice.
"You don't realize how much is going on in peo
ple's lives," she said.
Audience members also walk away changed.
"There are always people who come up after the
show ind ask a lot of questions," Arimoto said.
" 'The Vagina Monologues' are a great way to start
conversations."
Though she is happy with what V-Day at Stan
ford has done so far, Arimoto still does not think
that the true mission has been achieved.
"I feel like we're making progress, but there's
still a lot to be accomplished," she said.
