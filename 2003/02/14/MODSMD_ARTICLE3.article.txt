# Protest marches to Hoover
## Students rally against War on Iraq and Hoover hiring policies 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cheering demonstrators, many of them bearing
signs including, "No War On Iraq" and "Resist the
State," occupied White Plaza yesterday, as over 100
students, faculty and community members gathered
to protest the potential U.S. war with Iraq.
The speakers and performers — most of whom
were professors or representatives of student activist
groups — also criticized other international and do
mestic policies of the U.S. government. They also an
nounced the results of a meeting earlier that morning
between University President John Hennessy and
students to discuss Stanford's relationship with the
Hoover Institution.
Following the rally, demonstrators marched to
Hoover — which has been criticized for what its de
tractors call a partisan hiring policy and its influence

on the Bush administration's cuirent policies — and
taped petitions to the door. The petitions called for
the University to sever its relationship to the institu
tion if Hoover fails to change its hiring policy. Hen
nessy said he doesn't think that the hiring policy is po
litical and that he will not change University relations
with Hoover.
"All these [pro-war, conservative] ideas come out of
die Hoover Institution," said sophomore Caroline
Picker, the rally's emcee and a member of SEAS and
the Stanford Coalition for Peace and Justice. "It's
something to remember — as Stanford students we're
in a unique place ... We have the opportunity to at
tack the ideas, the intellectual force behind the anti-af
firmative action movement, the current war in Iraq,
the idea that communism is a malignant ideology."
Picker encouraged attendees to also go to the anti
war protest in San Francisco this Sunday and said that,
if the United States attacks Iraq, student activists will
hold a demonstration at 3 p.m. on that day in the Main
Quad.
