# Protest marches to Hoover
## Students rally against War on Iraq and Hoover hiring policies 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Cheering demonstrators, many of them bearing
signs including, "No War On Iraq" and "Resist the
State," occupied White Plaza yesterday, as over 100
students, faculty and community members gathered
to protest the potential U.S. war with Iraq.
The speakers and performers — most of whom
were professors or representatives of student activist
groups — also criticized other international and do
mestic policies of the U.S. government. They also an
nounced the results of a meeting earlier that morning
between University President John Hennessy and
students to discuss Stanford's relationship with the
Hoover Institution.
Following the rally, demonstrators marched to
Hoover — which has been criticized for what its de
tractors call a partisan hiring policy and its influence

on the Bush administration's cuirent policies — and
taped petitions to the door. The petitions called for
the University to sever its relationship to the institu
tion if Hoover fails to change its hiring policy. Hen
nessy said he doesn't think that the hiring policy is po
litical and that he will not change University relations
with Hoover.
"All these [pro-war, conservative] ideas come out of
die Hoover Institution," said sophomore Caroline
Picker, the rally's emcee and a member of SEAS and
the Stanford Coalition for Peace and Justice. "It's
something to remember — as Stanford students we're
in a unique place ... We have the opportunity to at
tack the ideas, the intellectual force behind the anti-af
firmative action movement, the current war in Iraq,
the idea that communism is a malignant ideology."
Picker encouraged attendees to also go to the anti
war protest in San Francisco this Sunday and said that,
if the United States attacks Iraq, student activists will
hold a demonstration at 3 p.m. on that day in the Main
Quad.

Jon Fetter-Vorm, with Jason Glick in the background, passionately yells out cries against the war on Iraq as
demonstrators march toward the Hoover Institution yesterday afternoon.
Senior Calvin Miaw, co-coordina
tor of the SCPJ, estimated that 150
people in all attended the rally, with
no more than 120 present at one
time. This was significandy smaller
than the turnout of nearly 400 fora
similar rally on Jan. 17. During the
speeches, the normal business of
White Plaza continued, with student
groups hawking Valentine's Day
roses and tickets for the Viennese
Ball.
Among the speakers was Assoc.
Drama Prof. Rush Rehm, who criti
cized the concept of "regime change,"
which has been offered as a justifica
tion for the potential war.
"The truth is that the United States
has been involved in regime change
in my memory, in my lifetime," he
said. "And in every single place I can

point to where the United States
backed regime change, the result has
been a horrific cost on the civilian
population."
Rehm also exhorted attendees to
remain hopeful and determined.
"So, we must stop this war," he said.
"We must not sit back like so many
academics I know and talk about,
'Well, it's inevitable, it's going to hap
pen here,' and they all sort of take their
bets when it's going to happen. What
we have to do is assume that we can
stop this war. And it is our job to stop
it, to make sure that war is the last re
sort."
Laura Avina, a representative
from MEChA, said that the real war is
being fought as much at home as it is
abroad.
"So where is the real war?" she
said. "The war against Iraq Is a smoke
screen for wars against organized
labor, reproductive rights, education,
civil liberties, trade. It is only in recog
nizing the other war zones, the other

struggles that this movement right
here will get stronger and include
more people."
The last faculty member to speak
before the march to Hoover was His
tory Prof. Claybome Carson. Much of
his speech emphasized the long-term
nature of the anti-war struggle.
"Our resistance must go beyond
the current policies of war," he said.
"Those of you who do not have gray in
your hair... do not have memories of
Vietnam... You must know that this
crisis lias deep roots, and we're unlike
ly to confront the deeper problems of
American foreign policy with this rally
or even with the series of rallies that are
planned for the next few weeks.
"Instead, we must recognize that ef
fective resistance to the greatest pur
veyor of violence in the world today will
require long-term resistance, will re
quire activists who are long-distance
runners. Activists who see that the so
called 'war on terrorism' has already re
sulted in long-term damage to the

cause of building a world in which
peace and justice coexist."
Carson, who is the director of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project,
added, "During this time we need to
listen to the wisdom of Martin Luther
King. Not because he spoke out
against the Vietnam War but because
he recognized that [when] speaking
about the Vietnam War, you had to
address these deeper issues that led to
the war in Vietnam."
He concluded by paraphrasing
speeches by King, simply replacing
the word "communism" in the origi
nal speeches with "terrorism."
"Terrorism is a judgment against
our failure to make democracy real
and follow through on die revolutions
we [the United States and other West
ern nations] initiated," he said. "Our
only hope in the world lies in our abil
ity to recapture the revolutionary spir
it and go out in a sometimes-hostile
world declaring eternal hostility to
poverty, racism and militarism."

here will get stronger and include
more people."
The last faculty member to speak
before the march to Hoover was His
tory Prof. Claybome Carson. Much of
his speech emphasized the long-term
nature of the anti-war struggle.
"Our resistance must go beyond
the current policies of war," he said.
"Those of you who do not have gray in
your hair... do not have memories of
Vietnam... You must know that this
crisis lias deep roots, and we're unlike
ly to confront the deeper problems of
American foreign policy with this rally
or even with the series of rallies that are
planned for the next few weeks.
"Instead, we must recognize that ef
fective resistance to the greatest pur
veyor of violence in the world today will
require long-term resistance, will re
quire activists who are long-distance
runners. Activists who see that the so
called 'war on terrorism' has already re
sulted in long-term damage to the

cause of building a world in which
peace and justice coexist."
Carson, who is the director of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project,
added, "During this time we need to
listen to the wisdom of Martin Luther
King. Not because he spoke out
against the Vietnam War but because
he recognized that [when] speaking
about the Vietnam War, you had to
address these deeper issues that led to
the war in Vietnam."
He concluded by paraphrasing
speeches by King, simply replacing
the word "communism" in the origi
nal speeches with "terrorism."
"Terrorism is a judgment against
our failure to make democracy real
and follow through on die revolutions
we [the United States and other West
ern nations] initiated," he said. "Our
only hope in the world lies in our abil
ity to recapture the revolutionary spir
it and go out in a sometimes-hostile
world declaring eternal hostility to
poverty, racism and militarism."
Cheering demonstrators, many of them bearing
signs including, "No War On Iraq" and "Resist the
State," occupied White Plaza yesterday, as over 100
students, faculty and community members gathered
to protest the potential U.S. war with Iraq.
The speakers and performers — most of whom
were professors or representatives of student activist
groups — also criticized other international and do
mestic policies of the U.S. government. They also an
nounced the results of a meeting earlier that morning
between University President John Hennessy and
students to discuss Stanford's relationship with the
Hoover Institution.
Following the rally, demonstrators marched to
Hoover — which has been criticized for what its de
tractors call a partisan hiring policy and its influence

on the Bush administration's cuirent policies — and
taped petitions to the door. The petitions called for
the University to sever its relationship to the institu
tion if Hoover fails to change its hiring policy. Hen
nessy said he doesn't think that the hiring policy is po
litical and that he will not change University relations
with Hoover.
"All these [pro-war, conservative] ideas come out of
die Hoover Institution," said sophomore Caroline
Picker, the rally's emcee and a member of SEAS and
the Stanford Coalition for Peace and Justice. "It's
something to remember — as Stanford students we're
in a unique place ... We have the opportunity to at
tack the ideas, the intellectual force behind the anti-af
firmative action movement, the current war in Iraq,
the idea that communism is a malignant ideology."
Picker encouraged attendees to also go to the anti
war protest in San Francisco this Sunday and said that,
if the United States attacks Iraq, student activists will
hold a demonstration at 3 p.m. on that day in the Main
Quad.


CHRISSY MINYARD/ The Stanford Daily
Jon Fetter-Vorm, with Jason Glick in the background, passionately yells out cries against the war on Iraq as
demonstrators march toward the Hoover Institution yesterday afternoon.
Senior Calvin Miaw, co-coordina
tor of the SCPJ, estimated that 150
people in all attended the rally, with
no more than 120 present at one
time. This was significandy smaller
than the turnout of nearly 400 fora
similar rally on Jan. 17. During the
speeches, the normal business of
White Plaza continued, with student
groups hawking Valentine's Day
roses and tickets for the Viennese
Ball.
Among the speakers was Assoc.
Drama Prof. Rush Rehm, who criti
cized the concept of "regime change,"
which has been offered as a justifica
tion for the potential war.
"The truth is that the United States
has been involved in regime change
in my memory, in my lifetime," he
said. "And in every single place I can

point to where the United States
backed regime change, the result has
been a horrific cost on the civilian
population."
Rehm also exhorted attendees to
remain hopeful and determined.
"So, we must stop this war," he said.
"We must not sit back like so many
academics I know and talk about,
'Well, it's inevitable, it's going to hap
pen here,' and they all sort of take their
bets when it's going to happen. What
we have to do is assume that we can
stop this war. And it is our job to stop
it, to make sure that war is the last re
sort."
Laura Avina, a representative
from MEChA, said that the real war is
being fought as much at home as it is
abroad.
"So where is the real war?" she
said. "The war against Iraq Is a smoke
screen for wars against organized
labor, reproductive rights, education,
civil liberties, trade. It is only in recog
nizing the other war zones, the other

struggles that this movement right
here will get stronger and include
more people."
