# We dare you... not to see this movie
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
In the past three years the Ameritjia,'
movie-going public lias been bombarded by a
string of big-budget comic book adaptations.
First we had "X- Men" with a band of outqsft
genetic mutants. Next came the ridiculously
successful "Spiderman," featuring a geneti
cally mutated spider bite victim. Now, in
evitably, comes the genetically mutated
tice a pattern?) blind man of vigilante justice:
"Daredevil."
I have difficulty judging these
adaptations of tightly clad do-gooders as bigh
art. In other words, "Daredevil" ain't no
"American Beauty." Sadly, Mark Steven
Johnson, who directed and wrote the movie,
doesn't agree.
For those who never spent a significant
portion of their childhood nose-first in
pulpy pages of 25-cent superhero adven
tures, Daredevil (Ben Affleck) is the vigilante
protector of the downtrodden. Injured dur
ing childhood in a tragic mishap involvi i ig a
forklift and numerous barrels of muled?
waste, he lost his eyesight but gained height
ened awareness in his other senses, including
a novel radar power that lets him "see" his

surroundings.
Paradoxically, Daredevil is a very human
superhero. He masquerades as lawyer Matt
Murdoch by day, has trouble paying his bills
and keeps a cabinet full of Vicodin and Per
codan to dull the pain of fighting crime. In
this movie (the first of an almost-assuredly
franchise) Daredevil is searching for the elu
sive Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), his
archnemesis, while Jailing in love with the

beautiful Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner),
daughter of a local billionaire.
Overall, "Daredevil" joins the crowded
ranks of movies that are funny without mean
ing to be. The movie spends its first half-hour
in a sequence of flashbacks trying to develop
the main character into a realistic and apa
thetic person _ as if blindness could do for Ben
Affleck what it did for A1 Pacino in "Scent of a
Woman."

However, the
movie does take
on a whimsical
lighthearted
ness on occa-

sion. By far die best scene ot the film is the fan
ciful fight between Matt and Elektra (who
happens to be a kung fu expert) on a school
playground where each kick and karate chop
plays like a wink at the audience.
At other times, the scale tips too far in the
whimsy direction. Everything about King
pin's henchman Bullseye, performed by a
lackluster Colin Farrell, is completely ridicu
lous. Johnson introduces his evil nature by
having him kill, in chronological order, a bar
room denizen with a half-dozen paperclips, a
grandmotherly airline passenger with a
peanut and a security guard with a pencil.
While the characters that they play are hol
low, both Garner and Duncan are perfect
choices for their respective roles. Duncan in
particular is the epitome of muscle bound
fury that die Kingpin embodies. It's a good
thing the film'? cre?tors had the courage to be
col^rbiind.
I expect in the end that this movie will
make a lot of money, but don't contribute to
the downfall of American cinema by throwing
your buck in.
