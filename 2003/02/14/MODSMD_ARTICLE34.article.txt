# Same old stunts from Chan
## 
### ERICK FLORES 
In China, Jackie Chan is the
country's version ofTom Hanks.
In America, however, he
couldn't act to save his life. Any
body that tells you they're going
to see one of his movies to get a
quality dose of filmmaking is ei
ther a fan of his overseas flicks or
someone without any prior film
experience.
Most of us pay money to see a
Jackie Chan film because we love
to see him kick villain ass with his
sometimes comedic, sometimes
serious and always astounding
martial arts skills / stunts, always
choreographed and performed
by himself without much appar
ent difficulty. Of course, we can't
help but also laugh at the usual
American one-liners that seem so
odd coming from his mouth.
David Dobkin's "Shanghai
Knights" is no exception to the
rule. In this sequel to 2000's
"Shanghai Noon," Chon Wang
(Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Ban
non (Owen Wilson) partner up
again as two Americans from the
old west who, in late 19th-centu
ry England, are on the hunt for
the guy who has killed Chon's fa
ther and stolen the great Imper
ial Seal of China. He also has ul
timate plans for destruction and
domination.
Parading through the streets

of Great Britain as foreigners,
the comedic duo make sure to
point out all of the traditional

jokes that have come to

characterize the
British — bad

teeth, worse
weather and the
old attempts to get
a reaction out of
Royal Guards.
With this type of
obvious humor, the
movie has no real

moments of thigh-slapping, gut
busting laughter, but it does
manage to get a few chuckles out
of its viewers.
The finer comedy comes not
only from the bickering between
the two leads, who try to outdo
each other and label the other
the sidekick, but also from their
sheer oddness as a couple.
Chan's Chon is serious, honor
able, focused and always has a
plan. On the other hand, Wil
son's Roy is playful, cocky, sleazy
and the embodiment of every
thing that is all-American igno
rance. A college frat boy type
who loves the sound of his own
voice, Roy refers to Natives as
"savages," says Indians and Chi
nese are the same and says he
loves the Chinese because their
"occupations sound cooler."
The very thing that makes the
movie funny is also its biggest

problem. While Jackie Chan
movies are not yet tired, they're

/ ' /
becoming awfully for
mulaic: Mismatch
Chan with his ex-

treme opposite (see Chris

Tucker in "Rush
Hour" or even worse,
Jennifer Love Hewitt
in"The Tuxedo"),
take him out of his na
tive China in ex
change fora foreign
country, have him

beat down evil-doers, and add a
few lines of comedy here and
there.
Of course, "Shanghai
Knights" does put a spin on a few
things. Chon's sister Lin (Fann
Wong), a girl whose butt-kicking
skills are on par with Chan's, gets
romantically involved with Roy.
And Chan gets to do a series of
fighting scenes in new contexts,
including two especially funny
and elaborate sequences, one in a
hotel revolving door and the
other on the streets of London's
merchant markets, to the tune of
Gene Kelley's "Singing in the
Rain."
But unless you're a huge Jack
ie Chan fan, I would recommend
waiting for "Knights" to be re
leased on video. Or, if you own
"Rush Hour,"just pop that in the
VCR and push play. If you've
seen one, you've seen 'em all.
