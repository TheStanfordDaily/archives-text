# Intermission plays matchmaker:
## Blind dates galore! Mediated by Jennie Kim 
### 
Before they met, Nastassia thought Jonathan was blade. All that and
more gets cleared up real quick at the Treehouse.
Jonathan: I picked Nastassia up in front of Building 460 and was immediately impressed
by her sense of style — fashionable yet unique, with high heels and a sash around her
waist.
Nastassia: After trying to meet five times (all unsuccessful), Jonathan Beard walked to my
work on Friday. He wore a red sweater with a lime green collared shirt underneath. He
had brownish / reddish hair and a wide grin on his face.
Jonathan: While I was excited for the date, and I believe Nastassia was too, the only time
we could find to get together was fora brief lunch. So, we went to just about the most ro
mantic place you could ever wish for on campus — everybody's favorite Treehouse.
Nastassia: We walked over to the Treehouse together, and talked (mosdy) about music.
The mood was... well, it was the

Treehouse. It was loud and greasy,
and we had to move our chairs every
couple of minutes so that the busboy
could get die trash can past our
table.
Jonathan: The conversation was
good; I found Nastassia easy to talk
to and interesting to listen to. Sur
prisingly; though, we didn't have
much time for lunch, the mood wa.>
still fairly relaxed and easygoing.
Nastassia: Jonathan's passion for
music and talent for the instruments
he plays is astounding. What was
most captivating about Jonathan
was his voice. I have heard him sing
in the past and had mistaken him for
a black man. Jonathan is definitely
blessed with an amazing voice for
R&B.
Jonathan: Perhaps most interesting
was simply that Nastassia and I were
probably about to meet soon any
way, through other circumstances.
Nastassia: Our date lasted no
longer than 45 minutes, and from
the limited time that we spent to
gether, I gathered that he is a truly
nice guy with aspirations that are re
freshingly eclectic from what other
students plan to pursue at Stanford.

He's 6'8," she's 5'8." They'd have some
freakishly tall children.
Sheila: We decided to go to University Cafe for dinner,
which was my suggestion since he said he wasn't picky.
Josh: I wanted to go to Sundance, but the place she picked
was fine.
Sheila: I tripped getting out of the car! It was sooo embar
rassing. He was nice enough to help me up... after he fin
ished laughing.
Josh: That was the funniest thing when she fell. I think her
shoe got stuck, but man, I've never seen anyone fall like diat.
Sheila: He was wearing a blue sweater with stripes and jeans.
His shoes matched his outfit; it was a nice touch.
Josh: She had on a red top, black pants. I thought she was
real cute.
Sheila: Josh is good looking. Nice and tall. I knew who he was
before the date, of course, but I didn't think it made that
much of a difference. I used to play basketball too, in junior
high.
Josh: We talked basketball fora while, she played forward
once, but that was back when she was 12.
Sheila: It took me a while to decide what to order. I finally
chose the chicken stir-fry and my favorite smoothie of all
time: raspberry-lemon. Josh had soup and a sandwich.
Josh: She kept going on and on about the smoothie, so I fi
nally tasted it. It was good.
Sheila: He's really mellow, so it was cool just hanging out with
him. We kept a pretty steady conversation going, I feel like I
probably asked him a lot of questions.
Josh: I was sitting in an uncomfortable chair during dinner. I
kept moving around.
Sheila: He told me about his traveling for basketball and
everything. It seemed pretty intense. He only got to be home
three days over Christmas vacation, but he wasn't complain
ing. I guess that's just how it is. He seems like he's content.
Josh: She's pretty chill, easy to talk to and everything. The
food was good too.
Sheila:lt was nice of him to pay for me, but he didn't have to.

Josh: I paid while she was in the bathroom.
Sheila: Afterwards, he came over to Suites, and we all
hung out with my roommates. We watched "Sweet
Home Alabama." I felt bad that we didn't plan ahead or
we would've picked a less girly movie, but all the rest of
us really wanted to watch it.
Josh: Yeah, the movie was OK. It was kind of funny, but
I probably wouldn't have watched it by myself or any
thing.
Sheila: I think Reese won him over in the end. Next up:
"Legally Blonde 2!" It was like hanging out with a
friend. He was very polite; he didn't try anything.
Jbsh: I'd hang out with Sheila again, yeah. She's a cool
girl.
Sheila: We exchanged numbers and hugged goodbye.
It was a fun night.

Erik: I picked Vauhini up on the
street. Out on the corner of Campus
Drive and Mayfield.
I spotted her leaning against one of the
blue campus 9-1-1 towers. What a
looker, let me tell ya. Anyway, it was
cold out, so I thought I would get her
in my car as soon as possible.
Vauhini: He was wearing a short
sleeved polo shirt with a t-shirt under
neath. His look screamed SEX.
Erik: I think she was wearing pants.
Vauhini: Three words: Thank you, In
termission.
Erik:Vauhini really liked the bread
they served us. She actually never
looked at me when we were talking
and kept staring at the bread. I don't
even think I got a piece. When she
asked the waiter to bring us our third
serving of bread, I excused myself and
went to the men's room to cry. After I
composed myself, I went back to our
table and sat down. A few minutes later
I thought Vauhini was getting a little
footizzle-wizzle going but she was actu
ally just trying to reach a piece of bread
she dropped under the table. With her
feet. On the floor. Under the table.
And you guessed it: she ate it. "This
bread is good," she said.

Vauhini: We had dinner at the California Cafe. They had great bread.
Erik: Well, Vauhini is all business. She was telling me about her aspirations to join the CIA and become a spy
in France. She thinks the whole being a journalist thing is just so she'll have a cover when she's spying on the
French socialists.
Vauhini: He told me about his passion for broadcast journalism and wife abuse, so we had a lot in common,
except that I'm more interested in print journalism. Mostly, I tried to get him to share cruel gossip about mu
tual acquaintances. Guys love that, I've heard, but it didn't really fly with him.
Erik: Our waiter couldn't take the pictures, but that's why he's a waiter and not a photographer. Actually, when

we were walking back to my car in the parking lot outside the restaurant,
Vauhini tried to get in someone else's car. A couple that was walking be
hind us was also returning to their car (a dark green BMW 7-series —
what Stanford kid drives a BMW 7-series?), and the man unlocked the
car with his remote key. Vauhini took this opportunity to nearly let her
self into the car before I stopped her. She told me she thought it was my
car, but I think she was just trying to get away from me.

Vauhini: I enjoyed the date, though I had the vague feeling at the end
that my advances made him uneasy. Anyway, I learned that not all PHEs
and / or Asians are techie majors!

Erik: It's good to know there are people like Vauhini at Stanford. Obvi
ously, besides being attractive, she has ambition and talent. A girl like Vauhini
shouldn't be single. Wait, she was single, right?

Stop in the name of love:
Vauhini and Erik get it on.
