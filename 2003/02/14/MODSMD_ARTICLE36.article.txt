# Choreography, music make this ballet hip

### TIFFANY LEE 
Even if you're not a big
fan of the ballet, these two
dances are definitely worth a
try. The choreographies are
superb, the dancing is amaz
ing and the complementary
musical choices are excellent.

The first piece, "Dances at a
Gathering" is a collection of
small flirtatious scenes pre-

formed to various Chopin
Waltzes, Mazurkas and

Nocturnes. The scenery
is sparse, in fact nonexis-

tent, except fora sky
blue covered wall as a
backdrop. But this sparse

scenery is all that is needed
since the grace, beauty and ele-

gance of the ballet dancers are
enough to carry the show. The only
criticism I have for this piece is the
length of the performance, which
I feel can be shortened just a bit.
First performed by the New York
City Ballet in 1969, "Dances at a
Gathering" features the choreog
raphy of Jerome Robbins, a bril
liant choreographer who also did

the choreography for the movie "West Side Story."
Each of the 10 dancers, who together dance an hour
long piece composed of 20 short vignettes, have amaz
ing stamina, grace, and acrobatic talent. Yuan Yuan Tan
and Yuri Possokhov perform a series of especially

breathtaking lifts, some of which end

with Tan being held
horizontally over

/
Possokhov's head
and others where
she is completely re-

versed with her head inches
above the ground. Despite the dif
ficulties of these

lifts, the audience never gets a
sense that the dancers are any-

where close
to being tired.

I was also really
impressed by the duet

between Pascal Molat
and Possokhov. The

dance was a sort of show
down, with one dancer doing

a set or moves and being mimic
ked by the other. Despite the
clashing of horns between these
two dancers on the stage, there is
a lighthearted attitude that per
vades throughout their perfor
mance that makes it incredibly en
joyable.
"Elite Syncopations" was the
perfect piece to follow the com
paratively more traditional
"Dances at a Gathering" — it re-

ally didn't resemble a ballet so much as a cabaret.
Set to a collection of Scott Joplin as well as other rag
time tunes, this piece is set in a dance hall, complete
with bentwood chairs and an onstage orchestra. The
costumes fit the atmosphere of this piece perfectly, with

The choreographies
speak for themselves,
but the San Francisco
ballet dancers provide
the attitude and style
that make these two
ballets a must see.

the painted-on bodysuits of tuxes,
neon colored tops and striped
pants.
Choregraphed by Sir Kenneth
MacMillan and first preformed by the
Royal Ballet in 1974, the piece is a bit
ballet and a lot of attitud and humor.
My favorite vignette from this perfor
mance is the duet done to Joseph

Lamb's "The Alaskan Rag" preformed by Muriel Maffre
and James Sofranko. This may have been one of the most

comic sequences of both pieces
combined.
Throughout this sequence, the
two "try" to perform various ballet
moves and lifts, but because of the
gargantuan size of Maffre,
Sofranko struggles to hold her up.
In reality, Sofranko is only a bit
taller than Maffre, but a combina
tion of the pointe shoes and the
costuming makes Maffre seem
much taller, thereby providing the
comic element. This vignette is
only a sampling of the comedy and
expressive energy of "Elite Synco
pations."
These two pieces, although
they draw from the moves and
techniques of a traditional ballet,
definitely come with a modern

edge, making it accessible even to those who know very
little about the ballet. The choreographies speak for
themselves, but the San Francisco ballet dancers pro
vide the attitude and style that make these two ballets a
must see.
