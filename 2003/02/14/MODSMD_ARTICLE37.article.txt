The first sound of crying from a new
born can be a rich, even happy sound that
signals fresh life, full of potential. Flux-ca
pacitor forward a few months to frayed
nerves and baggy eyes. The bawling doesn't
stop, and everything seems to make the
child cry. A sleep-impaired mind is

demoted to a weary proba
bilistic machine, functioning A
only to STOP THE CRY-1
ING. And nothing stops the ¥
crying. And the crying goes

on constantly. UGH. OK, so
maybe die experience of the Ail-American
Rejects' new self-titled album doesn't feel
quite like that, but it's only by a matter of de
grees.
By now you've heard that sweet-and
sour-low-calorie-Diet-Weezer-with-lemon
hit "Swing Swing" by the Ail-American Re
jects. It's an addictive adolescent sadness
song, strangely upbeat, with a Dashboard-
Confessional-paved path to teenage ears.
The first time around, it's strangely fun to
wallow in this track's tuneful sorrow. The
initial listening impression is good, bring
ing hope that this song is a mournful
"Pinkerton"-esque beacon, hinting at a ris

ing power-pop powerhouse. The musical
skills and catchy gimmicks are here, invok
ing dreams of a surprisingly mature outfit
in today's emo-indulgence scene. But the
rest of the album shatters the anticipation,
and soon it sets in: These kids ain't too
bright, and all they do is cry.
In a recent interview, newly-sought
after frontman Tyson Ritter explains his

muse: "I had a
rough relation
ship, and this was
written when it
sucked. I liked this
other chick, so

that's what the second verse is about,
moving on to a hotter chick ... no I'm
just kidding. Moving on to another girl,
or just moving on." Right. Snap back to
reality, the hope in these guys is gone.
Though the remainder of the album is a
decent pop-rock experience, the variety
of rock gimmicks and hooks is just not
enough to make up for the incessant self
pity. The mix of bells, synth and pulsing
guitar highlights track 10, "Happy End
ings." But for God's sake, even a song
called "Happy Endings" turns out to be a
teary over-dramatic goodbye.
It's not inherendy bad for rock stars to

mourn: Great rock singers have eulogized
tragically lost romances with emotional
richness and complexity. It's just that the
lyrics and the tone of these Rejects are so
forced, self-important and shallow. It
hurts me to see someone blow their own
problems way out of proportion, especial
ly with a Gading-gun of hyperbolic lost
love cliches: "My heart will bleed"; "Your
love was everything"; "Can I find a way to
carry on again?"
It's agonizing to imagine that conversa
tion in which two attractive girls tell Nick
and Tyson that they like "sensitive guys
who are man enough to cry." I kept wait
ing for the wry smile or sarcastic sense of
humor to come around. "Oh yeah, that
girl turned out to be a bitch." Or "Hey, I
got some perspective-enhancing sleep this
weekend and my problems just aren't that
bad." C'mon, how aboutjust a measly non
sulk song? Nope. The Rejects' mourning
effectively conveyed anguish to me
through their music, just in a slightly dif
ferent flavor: disappointment and annoy
ance.
The lasting impression of this record
seems to indicate why these guys are so
damn sorrowful. The great, tuneful first
impression rakes in the adoration. But

soon they're clingy, needy, self-pitying,
repetitive and shallow. Not the greatest
formula for romantic success, last I
checked. But go ahead and get hooked
on this, if it grabs you. Just know that the
shelf-life of this record is extraordinarily
short, and replay value is non-existent,
except maybe to facilitate your next post
break-up brooding session. Just to prove
that whining isn't contagious, a glimmer
of hope: The melodic toolbox of pop
rock talent is there, and perhaps we can
hope that these cry-babies still have time
to develop more complex emotions.
