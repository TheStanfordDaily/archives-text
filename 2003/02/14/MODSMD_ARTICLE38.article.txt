# Put The Walkmen in your Discman, man
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
OK, it's 2003 and by now I'm pretty inured to the idea
that the time period between every two Radiohead al
bums is reserved for us to go retro and celebrate anachro
nisms with a pious fervor. Then, when the cash stops com
ing and the charts go-a-bummin', we collapse back into
our rocking chairs and eat soggy marshmallows and flash
silly grins and talk smack about rock'n'roll. Personally, I
love garage rock, and I'm not applying to the back-lash
brigade anytime soon, but here's a little secret: Nothing
goes out of date faster than an anachronism.
And that's why The Walkmen, with their

"we're gonna get sued by Sony" namesake, are
the sort of visionaries we need to ensure that /
rock'n'roll is well represented at its annual II
inquest. Don't look at me — it's these New I
Yorkers who bring it up on the song "We've

Been Had" ("Don't care
much for the go-go or the
retro image I see so often
telling me to keep trying")
before grabbing additional
brownie points for deni
grating the mod haircut.
Another great band called
Pavement posed the ques
tion years ago — "Darling,
why don't you go and cut
your hair?" and I'm just
dying to see it in practical
application.
The Walkmen are star
tling mainly because they
use the quadratic of garage
guitars, upright piano, duc
tile vocals and tight drum
ming to solve the problem of
sounding ethereal and
ragged all at once. Like cer
tain pieces by their superb
Brit contemporaries, Clinic,
this outfit is into what I like
to call limbo rock, an ap-

proach that is meditative without being menacing. Make
no mistake, on "Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Is
Gone," The Walkmen don't swagger. They shimmer.
"We've Been Had," for ex
ample, sounds like a watery Christmas carol played on a

piano before the drums kick in,
shepherded by Hamilton Lei
thauser's plaintive, scratchy vo
cals: A quick consultation with
my playlist confirms that this is
the catchiest, dreamiest song

I've heard in a while.
On the whole, the songs are successful because they
feature indulgent hooks suspended in a saw-dust atmos
phere: This, people, is a band unafraid of aiming for God
from the garage. Leithauser's voice, meanwhile, is a
phlegm-filled salutation to Bono and Thom Yorke, and
lie's jaded sufficiently to be cool.
Harking from the front, "Wake Up," issues jerky gui
tars, softens them with a slow piano drone and achieves
stratospheric heights that recall U2. The slowed and be
witching chord sequence circles Leithauser's soaring ex
halations in the chorus, lending the song an unexpected
solemnity. The wonderfully titled "Revenge Wears No
Wristwatch" is dense with clanging drum choreography
and insouciant singing, but never blocks out the ethereal
feel of this album. The title track, meanwhile, features di
verse instrumentation (violins, organs) and soft Sigur-Ros
style verses that climb onto simmering guitars.

Most of the faults on
this album — especially the
jarring guitars on the last
few songs — are simply an
insurance against polish,
and on an album that ex
plores its formula this com
prehensively, almost in
significant. So, while the
critical fraternity fattens up
on stocked-up Velvet-Un
derground hooks, and stri
dently pushes rip-off acts
like The Libertines, we're
piling up the evidence that
originality can and does
work. In any case, my trini
ty of up-and-coming rock
bands is complete: The
Walkmen, Clinic and The
Liars are guaranteed a per
manent place on my
playlist. And now I'm only
waiting for the time when
it'll be The Walkmen who
sue Sony.
