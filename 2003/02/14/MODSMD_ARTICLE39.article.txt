# Ditch your emotional baggage this Valentine's Day
## 
### 
Ah, Valentine's Day is here again, a holiday marked by
commodified displays of affection, overpriced roses and
major self-esteem issues. No other day has the power of
Feb. 14 to make a single person feel like shit. Roxy won
ders if this trend is indicative of something bigger — a se
vere epidemic affecting college students nationwide —
serial monogamy. So, whether or not you have a Valen
tine, it's the ideal time of the year for this columnist to get
serious and issue a public health bulletin.
Please answer the following:
1. Have you had two or more long-term (four or more
months) relationships in the past year?
2. Do you rarely stay single for more than two months
straight?
3. Are you actively seeking a boyfriend or girlfriend?
4. Do you tend to replace your exes instead of fully
getting over them?
If you answered yes to two or more of the above ques
tions, you have probably been infected. Serial
monogamy is spreading through the halls of Stanford as
we speak, and the symptoms are fairly easy to detect.
Victims suffer from acute delusions — most notably, the

perceived need to couple. Healthy individuals know the
truth. Kidneys, Internet connection, dental floss: all these
things are needs, having a boyfriend or girlfriend is not.
You may wonder what the deleterious effects of serial
monogamy are anyway. Sure, it seems harmless to jump
from one boyfriend / girlfriend to another, but the actu
al damage from relationship hopping is trickily perva
sive and far-reaching. Serial monogamy is marked by lin
gering relationship ghosts: unresolved issues from pre
vious relationships fucking up your current one.
It isn't psychologically healthy to rebound unthink
ingly. Often, you aren't ready to move on, and a single
memory recalled or awkward run-in experienced can
leave you undone. It's the old afraid-to-be-alone com
plex rearing its ugly head, and it sure as hell isn't fair to
the other person, who may very well be into you for real,
for the long haul and deserves to be more to you than the
equivalent of human therapy.
Another, less emotionally driven, cause of serial
monogamy is simple, persistent horniness. The patient
justifies his or her desire to receive regular play by label
ing an otherwise random hookup as the laeginning of

something serious. Roxy sees this as deceptive, limiting
and just plain lazy. Your hormones can't power a full
fledged, meaningful relationship; God knows this
columnist has tried!
Whether driven by the need to recover quickly from
a past relationship or by the need to get laid, serial
monogamy ends up in the devaluation of all relation
ships to come. Victims suffer from impaired vision: They
focus on finding a boyfriend or girlfriend rather than
seeing individuals for who they are.
If you suspect that you or someone you love has con
tracted serial monogamy, don't panic — it's not too late!
In order to recover, the sufferer must confront the issues
that ended previous relationships. Meditation, journal
ing, group discussion and catharsis are all possible meth
ods. Above all, do not relapse and recouple! Serial
monogamy is highly contagious and can infect your un
witting partner with your fuckedupness. Be strong, stay
single, and you CAN make it through.
