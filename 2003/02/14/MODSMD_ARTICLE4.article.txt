# Robinson speaks on human rights
## Thursday: Poor governmental control and AIDS plague Africa 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
In her second lecture last night, former president of
Ireland and human rights activist Mary Robinson spoke
about "The Challenge of Human Rights Protection in
Africa" to nearly 300 people in Kresge Auditorium.
"I would like to focus on how the notion of shared
responsibilities for the realization of human rights
could be applied to the part of the world that to date
has been most excluded from the potential benefits
of globalization," Robinson said, referring to Africa.
"Clearly there is some overlap, in that the human
rights approach in tackling the HIV/AIDS pan
demic which I outlined yesterday has particular ap
plication in many countries in Africa."
Although her five-year term as high commission
er for human rights for the United Nations ended in
2002, Robinson still continues to push for stopping
human rights violations in Africa, which she said
have severe repercussions on both social and eco
nomic development.
She focused on Africa as an example in illustrat
ing her point that human rights are essential for sus
taining success and peace in a nation. According to
Robinson, obstacles ranging from corruption to
male dominance currently prevent people from ful
filling these ideals. These shortcomings sometimes
contribute or cause public unrest, which ultimately
pulls the nation away from achieving democratic val
ues and fulfilling even the most basic of human val
ues.
"Indeed, some of the key challenges at the heart of
development — including the demands of democra
tization, governance and accountability, the elimina
tion of discrimination against women and enhancing
their role in male-dominated societies, combating cor
ruption, terrorism and other forms of criminality
[and] enhancing judicial re
forms— require not only leader
ship and resources, but also a legal
response," Robinson said.
Moreover, this responsibility of
leadership and human rights ad
vocating lies not only with lawmak
ers and professional leaders, but
also with churches, parliaments,
businesses and every sector of civil
society.
"Many of the worst human
rights violations in Africa are a re
sult of failures in governments at
the local and national level," said
Robinson. "But there lacks a con
cern at the international level."
"The stumbling block most gov
ernments face is a lack of capacity
to make the far-reaching changes
and adaptations needed," added
Robinson. "That capacity has been
weakened further in some coun

tries by the obligation to imple
ment the sometimes ill-advised ad
justment policies advocated by the
international financial institu
tions."
Exacerbating problems at the
governmental level is the
HIV / AIDS epidemic.
"Last year, the United Nations
AIDS program projected that of all
15-year-olds in the worst-afflicted
African nations — Botswana,
Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe and
South Africa — half or more will
die of AIDS," Robinson said.
"AIDS has cut life expectancy in
Botswana from 71 years to 35
years and in Zimbabwe from 70
years to 36."
Robinson said that, despite the
events of Sept. 11, people should
still try to stop human rights abuses
and promote the assurance of basic
human rights such as health care.
"The question we need to an
swer is this: how can these initia
tives be developed and dramatical
ly scaled up, not over 10 or 20

years, but now?" she said. "How
c an this happen in the context of
poverty, disease, debt, conflict and
the displacement of millions of
people across the continent?"
Robinson suggested that every
one should bridge the cultural
gaps that divide nations from one
another and often cause ethnic vi
olence.
She alluded to the human
genome project in concluding that
all humans share a common
"human spirit."
"We all constitute one human
family," she said, quoting from a
project titled "Tolerance and Di
versity: A Vision for the 21 st Centu
ry"
"Instead of allowing diversity
of race and culture to become a
limiting factor in human ex
change and development, we
must refocus our understanding,
discern in such diversity the po
tential for mutual enrichment
and realize that it is the inter
change between great traditions

of human spirituality that offers
the best prospect for the persis
tence of the human spirit itself ."
A brief question-and-answer
session followed the lecture.
Student reaction reflected the
idealistic visions Robinson ex
pressed.
"It was good to see that ac
tivism for human rights in an
area of the world which is so often
neglected, despite the political
focus elsewhere," said senior
William Bowen.
"Despite everything she's seen
and witnessed, she speaks with
hope about the future," said ju
nior Sagar Chandaria. "It's quite
inspiring."
An analyst from the Commit
tee on Human Research at UC-
San Francisco, however, dis
agreed with the students.
"I was disappointed that the
effects, influences, etc. of the
'tribal' society wasn't ap
proached," said Fred Hendrick
son.
