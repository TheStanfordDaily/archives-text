In her second lecture last night, former president of
Ireland and human rights activist Mary Robinson spoke
about "The Challenge of Human Rights Protection in
Africa" to nearly 300 people in Kresge Auditorium.
"I would like to focus on how the notion of shared
responsibilities for the realization of human rights
could be applied to the part of the world that to date
has been most excluded from the potential benefits
of globalization," Robinson said, referring to Africa.
"Clearly there is some overlap, in that the human
rights approach in tackling the HIV/AIDS pan
demic which I outlined yesterday has particular ap
plication in many countries in Africa."
Although her five-year term as high commission
er for human rights for the United Nations ended in
2002, Robinson still continues to push for stopping
human rights violations in Africa, which she said
have severe repercussions on both social and eco
nomic development.
She focused on Africa as an example in illustrat
ing her point that human rights are essential for sus
taining success and peace in a nation. According to
Robinson, obstacles ranging from corruption to
male dominance currently prevent people from ful
filling these ideals. These shortcomings sometimes
contribute or cause public unrest, which ultimately
pulls the nation away from achieving democratic val
ues and fulfilling even the most basic of human val
ues.
"Indeed, some of the key challenges at the heart of
development â€” including the demands of democra
tization, governance and accountability, the elimina
tion of discrimination against women and enhancing
their role in male-dominated societies, combating cor
ruption, terrorism and other forms of criminality
