# This girl tours — with the whole family!

### PETER KAZANJY 
So, exacdy why is Kasey Chambers tour
ing? Her solo debut, "The Captain" came out
in mid 1999 to vast critcal acclaim, and her
sophomore offering, "Barricades and Brick
walls," hit shelves in the United States back in
April. To date, the Australian songstress has
sold some 600,000 albums worldwide.
She's not touring in support of "Barri
cades," since that tour happened

1 1
last year. She's not debuting
new material in the shows, at ,
least not enough to call this a
"teaser tour." She's touring
because for Chambers and the

rest of her band / family (more to
follow), touring is an end unto itself. She
tours because touring is what she does so
well.
In fact, her whole family comes along for
the ride. After bumming a smoke off of some
one who turned out to be Kasey's brother /
producer / manager, Nash, as he exited the
tour bus, I wryly asked, "No smoking on the
bus in California?" He replied, "Nah, mate
(nojoke), there's babies up there." Kasey tours
with her brother, mother (merchandiser / oc
casional bass), father (lead guitar / backup vo
cals), husband (moral support), infant child,
sister-in-law, infant nephew and the rest of her
band.
Her dad was the first opener with some

lyP *★★★☆

solo acoustic work, consisting mainly of odes
to beer, TV dinners and missed romantic
rendezvous of his itinerant youth. Her

brother also joined the show, mounting the
stage with Kasey and Dad to play guitar on
"If I Needed You," along with Mom, who
abandoned her post at the T-shirt table to
play a bass exactly as tall as she was.
Besides the family aspect of the show,
Chambers makes it clear that there's very little

else in the world she'd
rather be doing that night
than rocking out in front
of you. At one point, she
stopped the show to re
mark, "This is really weird

that we're at the Filmore. I mean, I have a
DVD of Tom Petty, and he was standing right
here [points to a spot on the ground]! I can tell
you that I'm stoked about that."
Limited in part by the number of band
members (two other guitarists besides her
self, a bassist and the drummer), the finer
studio points of some songs had to be

dropped, like the occassional fiddle,
mandolin and piano accompani
ments. Recognizing the reality of

this, Chambers did best when
sticking to big guitar tunes.

The "Barricades" title track
opened the show and blew
the album version right out
of the water. The richness of

the guitar was a near simulacrum of the
fuzzy twang off Petty's "Mary Jane's Last
Dance" and filled the hall to the brim.
The big guitar continued with "Freight
Train" (a Fred Eaglesmith cover), Lucinda
William's "Change the Locks" and Cham
bers' "Runaway Train" and "Crossfire" to
end the first encore. But this isn't to say
bombast was the rule.
Despite the foot stomping and head shaking
that accompanied the growlier pieces, more
.i•..l i _ r r !

plaintive ones had as much of an impact.
"Not Pretty Enough" was the best

/ o
sing-along, and tlie most emo
tionally charged song of the

evening was neither
honky-tonk nor Cham-
If T

bers own. In a sec
ond, unplanned
and final encore,
A

Chambers' and her single acoustic made Iris
DeMent's "No Time to Cry" come to life; at
once treating the audience to some true
mournful beauty and masterfully letting them
down easy at the end of an otherwise raucous
evening. It was the greatest evidence that not
only does Chambers love playing live, but it
loves her.
