### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Challenging audience members to consider how
globalization can serve as an ethical force in the
world, former president of Ireland and human
rights activist Mary Robinson addressed a packed
Kresge Auditorium Wednesday night in the first of
two Tanner Lectures on human values.
In her speech, "Human Rights and the Ethics of
Globalization," Robinson explored the role of glob
alization in bolstering rights and what can be done
to remedy its negative outcomes.
In introducing the former president, University
President John Hennessy expressed admiration for
Robinson's work, describing her as a "passionate ad
vocate for human rights .. . unwavering in her ad
herence to her principles."
Her accomplishments include 20 years as a sena
tor in Ireland, seven years as the president of Ire
land and four years as the United Nations high com
missioner for human rights.
As Ireland's first female president, Hennessy
noted that Robinson acted as an advocate for liberal
and human rights causes, especially women's rights.
In her position at the U.N., Robinson traveled to
Rwanda, South Africa, Colombia and Cambodia,
working to strengthen the monitoring of human
rights.
Robinson is currently the director of the Ethical
Globalization Initiative, for which she continues to
advocate human rights — especially as they relate to
HIV / AIDS and migration.
In her lecture, Robinson mentioned that the
choice to make the words "ethical" and "globaliza
tion" adjacent to one another was an effort to chal
lenge skeptics to ask "why not?"
She began her lecture with the image of "soft
wax," borrowed from Yeats, which
she said symbolizes the current po
litical situation.
"For all the hardships :md dan
gers of our particular political mo
ment, there is that element of the
pliable and possible about it, if we
can change our minds and our
hearts about what needs to be done
and our responsibility to do it," she
said.
Robinson defined globalization
"at its simplest level as the increas
ing integration of economic, politi
cal and cultural activity across the
world."
Noting that economic globaliza
tion is rooted in competition be
tween people, corporations and
countries, she asked, "How do we
shift at least part of the emphasis
from competition to cooperation?"
According to Robinson, human

security, a current concern for
Americans, is now also a point of con
nection among nations and peoples.
"What happens in one region
has impacts in others, and no re
gion or country is immune," she
said.
Robinson stated that the com
mon language of "respect and soli
darity" is needed to promote dia
logue and progress on the issue of
security.
Robinson proceeded to discuss
the negative aspects of globaliza
tion. She cited a "gap in account
ability" due to the power shift from
the public to the private sector.
However, she also addressed
positive aspects of globalization, in
cluding its role in "fostering
transnational networks of advo
cates."
"From this perspective, global
ization has been of enormous help
in the cause of human rights and
women's empowerment," Robin
son added.

Citing AIDS as part of the "dark
side" of globalization, Robinson
asked, "how can human rights
help us to address the extent of our
shared responsibility for this glob
al catastrophe?"
"We know that those countries
which have had most success in
controlling the spread of AIDS
have been those where govern
ments have taken a human rights
approach," Robinson said. She
added that these countries have
done so by "encouraging public
discussion and public education,
freedom of expression and assem
bly, and taking steps to protect
those who come forward for test
ing and treatment."
According to Robinson, the
growing community of illegal im
migrants — like the growing com
munity of AIDS patients — is in
need of human rights protection.
"A rights approach means rec
ognizing that asylum seekers and
refugees who might move illegally

still have a right to be protected
under international law," she said.
"Equally, it ensures that persons
who have been trafficked are seen
as victims and not as offenders."
Robinson ended her Wednes
day talk by touching on the topic of
her lecture last night — Africa.
"Is there an international re
sponsibility for supporting coun
tries in need of help to build their
own national structures to ensure
the protection of human rights?"
she asked.
