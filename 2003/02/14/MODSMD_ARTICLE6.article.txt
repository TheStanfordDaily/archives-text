# Daily Exclusive: An interview with Mary Robinson
## U.S. POLICY AND U.N. ETHICS Robinson expands on global policies 
### SAMEER AHMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday morning, Mary Robinson, the former
president of Ireland and also the U.N. high commis
sioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002, sat down
with The Daily fora 30-minute interview to discuss
her current work with the newly established Ethical
Globalization Initiative, why the United States pres
sured her to leave the United Nations, human rights
concerns with Africa, the potential war in Iraq and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Daily: As the head of the Ethical Globalization

Initiative, how do you think human rights activists can
ensure that ethical and moral issues are in the debate
over globalization? What do you think Stanford stu
dents can do regarding this issue?
Mary Robinson: I'm trying to . . . take human
rights out of its box and say the human rights values
and the process of holding governments to account
ability is relevant to the wider issues of globalization.
We're trying to focus on a few issues ... like attacking
HIV/AIDS . . . [and] issues of migration. How come
we accept the world to have a free exchange of goods
and services and capital but [have] so many barriers to
people?...
What can universities, what can students do? I
think we just need to engage more
in linking human rights, democra
cy and development, helping de
veloping countries to do it, but also
doing it in our own countries. . . .
I'm also very keen that the United
States would come closer to the in
ternational agenda on human
rights ... where the two streams of
human rights — civil and political
rights, and economic, social and
cultural rights — are regarded as
equally important... I think in the
U.S. there is a cultural sense that
civil and political rights are real
human rights and economic, social
and cultural rights are political as
pirations.

Ifear greatly that a war at this stage,
certainly from a human rights perspective,
has a lot of unforeseeable consequences.

TD: Regarding your talk on
human rights protection in Africa,
how do you think these issues can
become a greater agenda in the
United States, not only on a politi
cal level but also on an academic
and local level?
MR: When I was [U.N.] high
commissioner, a part of my man
date ... was to monitor the way in
which African countries were ful
filling their human rights obliga
tions. And very often they were in
the dark. There were violations.
There was conflict. They were not
progressively implementing the
various rights, etc., and I felt it was
important to do that... but we also
have to be more supportive.
When I was talking about
[human rights in Africa] a few
years ago, I had a sense that there
wasn't a sense of connection be
tween [the issue and] the United
States, and indeed the citizens of
the United States. There was focus
on other issues — the Middle East,
now North Korea. But I think that
the human insecurity in our world
today is making the real point of
interconnectedness that it's impor
tant also to the future of the Unit-

Ed States, government and people,
that we don't have failed states in
Africa . . . that [we don't have
Africans who] reach a certain level
[of prosperity] and then . . . know
that there is another world that
they will never be able to attain and
who are potentially open to be ma
nipulated to violence, to acts of ter
rorism and soon ...
TD: Another hot issue on the
Stanford campus is the situation
with Iraq. From a human rights
standpoint, what are your particular
views regarding the potential war?
MR: Ive been trying to ap
proach the [conflict with Iraq] from
a human rights perspective, and I
was very concerned as high com
missioner about the situation of
human rights in Iraq. Saddam
Hussein has been violating rights

of the citizens, and he has been ma
nipulating the sanctions to make
the situation even worse. But it
troubled me that the sanctions
were capable of that kind of manip
ulation. So it wasn't a very good
human rights situation, and,
frankly, we didn't care enough
over the years about the acute suf
fering of the Iraqi people.
UNICEF would report on it; the
WHO would report on it; my office
was trying to draw attention within
the U.N. system, and politically
there wasn't really that concern.
[The] question has to be asked:
How come the very widespread
support and empathy that was
there toward the United States im
mediately after the attacks of 9/11,
how has that somehow dissipated
so much? How come more than
half the peoples of the world do
not want a war against Iraq under
present circumstances? And I
think that the switch from a focus
on al-Qaida and a focus from ad
dressing acts of terrorism to almost
inevitability of a war on Iraq has re
ally impacted very negatively on
world opinion ...
My own view is that that there is
more we can do [to prevent a war].

I think the political focus now, with
the political support behind the in
spections, is dramatically changing
the situation . . . The Arab coun
tries in the region are putting great
pressure on Saddam Hussein.
Maybe he'll be persuaded to leave
quietly if he gets some kind of
amnesty. Maybe we can have a per
manent monitoring presence
that's much more effective than
containment...
I fear greatly that a war at this
stage, certainly from a human
rights perspective, has a lot of un
foreseeable consequences, espe
cially if it's a war without that glob
al legitimacy of the Security Coun
cil framework.
TD: The Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has also been an important
topic on college campuses, and
during your role as U.N. high
commissioner, you dealt with this
issue a lot. What is your perspec
tive on the situation now?
MR: ... It's desperately impor
tant that we address it for the sake
of the two peoples, the Palestinians
and Israelis. I have consistently
condemned suicide attacks on civil
ians, and I'm also deeply con
cerned, particularly now, about the
actual humanitarian situation of
the Palestinian population. We
know that the [United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency] ... is run
ning out of money [to assist the
Palestinians], and the attention is
elsewhere — Afghanistan under
standably, and maybe now Iraq,
but you can't have several million
people starving in a very contained
context, where already there has
been too much bloodletting. We
have to give it more political atten
tion. To me it's the priority to bring
our world back together again.
TD: The credibility of the Unit
ed Nations has always been ques
tioned over the years. Many peo
ple claim that the human rights
agenda usually succumbs to secu
rity and other interests. From your
role at the United Nations, do you
think this statement is valid?
MR: 1 must say that working
within the U.N. and giving leader
ship on human rights, I sort of felt
that the U.N. fits Winston
Churchill's notion of democracy:
"It's the worst system except for all
the others."
The U.N. undoubtedly needs to
strengthen itself in the area of
human rights. First of all, with re

sources — it did shock me when I
took my job as high commissioner
that the budget of the U.N. allo
cates less than 2 percent to all of
the work in human rights, and
that's still the case ...
But having worked for five
years within the system, I'm ab
solutely convinced that our global
izing, interconnected world needs
the United Nations, that the Unit
ed States, as the superpower which
has the power to act alone, very
much needs the United Nations
for moral legitimacy in order to
avoid the perception that might is
right...
We're in a very dangerous mo
ment right now with this situation
over Iraq. Rifts have opened up
between Europe and the United
States, which I deeply regret... I
think it's time that we come to
gether and say it's more important

I always find it very troubling that we didn't
care enough about what is sometimes called
collateral damage. In my view, people are
not collateral damage; they are people.

that we find the common ground
in addressing real threats to [the
U.S.], but also internationally.
TD: It has widely been reported
that the Bush administration op
posed the extension of your term
as high commissioner. Why did
you leave your post at the U.N.?
MR: The term of high commis
sioner is a four-year term, and it
can be renewed once. Before the
end of the four years, I actually in

dicated that 1 wouldn't be seeking
another term ... I was then per
suaded by [U.N. Secretary-Gener
al] Kofi Annan himself and by
grassroots human lights people to
continue fora further year . . .
When the terrible attacks took
place on 9 / 11, and I saw the diffi
cult aftermath we just talked
about, I felt I'm not somebody who
leaves a position when things get
even tougher. I indicated quietly
to the secretary-general that if he
wanted to have me stay on for the
end of the term — for another
three years — I would be certainly
open to consider that, and he said
he would consult [with other mem
bers of the United Nations]. And
obviously when he consulted [with
the United States], he got the view,
"No, she's too critical."
I think it was the criticism of the
prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, the
use of immigration law, [and] con
cern about the extent of the
[death] toll of civilians in
Afghanistan. I always find it very
troubling that we didn't care
enough about what is sometimes
called collateral damage. In my
view, people are not collateral
damage; they are people. And the
Afghan civilians, the families who
were killed or who had family
members killed were as innocent
as those civilians who were in the
Twin Towers, and I subscribe to
the Universal Declaration that we
are equal in dignity and worth,
and yet there was a great tribute
and honoring of those people who
were killed in the Twin Towers.
We didn't even want to know how
many [died] or what [their] names
were or what the circumstances
were of the Afghan civilians. I had
to be a voice for them because they
had no voice otherwise.
I think for these reasons 1 was an
uncomfortable presence. I think
the U.S. was the dominant [factor
for pressuring me to leave the U.N.]
because, even though I was critical
of countries like China and Russia,
they assured me that they would be
happy to see me continue.

Afghan civilians, the families who
were killed or who had family
members killed were as innocent
as those civilians who were in the
Twin Towers, and I subscribe to
the Universal Declaration that we
are equal in dignity and worth,
and yet there was a great tribute
and honoring of those people who
were killed in the Twin Towers.
We didn't even want to know how
many [died] or what [their] names
were or what the circumstances
were of the Afghan civilians. I had
to be a voice for them because they
had no voice otherwise.
I think for these reasons 1 was an
uncomfortable presence. I think
the U.S. was the dominant [factor
for pressuring me to leave the U.N.]
because, even though I was critical
of countries like China and Russia,
they assured me that they would be
happy to see me continue.

Former Irish President Mary Robinson discusses her views on ethics and
global policies with The Daily yesterday.
Yesterday morning, Mary Robinson, the former
president of Ireland and also the U.N. high commis
sioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002, sat down
with The Daily fora 30-minute interview to discuss
her current work with the newly established Ethical
Globalization Initiative, why the United States pres
sured her to leave the United Nations, human rights
concerns with Africa, the potential war in Iraq and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Daily: As the head of the Ethical Globalization

Initiative, how do you think human rights activists can
ensure that ethical and moral issues are in the debate
over globalization? What do you think Stanford stu
dents can do regarding this issue?
Mary Robinson: I'm trying to . . . take human
rights out of its box and say the human rights values
and the process of holding governments to account
ability is relevant to the wider issues of globalization.
We're trying to focus on a few issues ... like attacking
HIV/AIDS . . . [and] issues of migration. How come
we accept the world to have a free exchange of goods
and services and capital but [have] so many barriers to
people?...
What can universities, what can students do? I
think we just need to engage more
in linking human rights, democra
cy and development, helping de
veloping countries to do it, but also
doing it in our own countries. . . .
I'm also very keen that the United
States would come closer to the in
ternational agenda on human
rights ... where the two streams of
human rights — civil and political
rights, and economic, social and
cultural rights — are regarded as
equally important... I think in the
U.S. there is a cultural sense that
civil and political rights are real
human rights and economic, social
and cultural rights are political as
pirations.

Ifear greatly that a war at this stage,
certainly from a human rights perspective,
has a lot of unforeseeable consequences.

TD: Regarding your talk on
human rights protection in Africa,
how do you think these issues can
become a greater agenda in the
United States, not only on a politi
cal level but also on an academic
and local level?
MR: When I was [U.N.] high
commissioner, a part of my man
date ... was to monitor the way in
which African countries were ful
filling their human rights obliga
tions. And very often they were in
the dark. There were violations.
There was conflict. They were not
progressively implementing the
various rights, etc., and I felt it was
important to do that... but we also
have to be more supportive.
When I was talking about
[human rights in Africa] a few
years ago, I had a sense that there
wasn't a sense of connection be
tween [the issue and] the United
States, and indeed the citizens of
the United States. There was focus
on other issues — the Middle East,
now North Korea. But I think that
the human insecurity in our world
today is making the real point of
interconnectedness that it's impor
tant also to the future of the Unit-

Ed States, government and people,
that we don't have failed states in
Africa . . . that [we don't have
Africans who] reach a certain level
[of prosperity] and then . . . know
that there is another world that
they will never be able to attain and
who are potentially open to be ma
nipulated to violence, to acts of ter
rorism and soon ...
TD: Another hot issue on the
Stanford campus is the situation
with Iraq. From a human rights
standpoint, what are your particular
views regarding the potential war?
MR: Ive been trying to ap
proach the [conflict with Iraq] from
a human rights perspective, and I
was very concerned as high com
missioner about the situation of
human rights in Iraq. Saddam
Hussein has been violating rights

of the citizens, and he has been ma
nipulating the sanctions to make
the situation even worse. But it
troubled me that the sanctions
were capable of that kind of manip
ulation. So it wasn't a very good
human rights situation, and,
frankly, we didn't care enough
over the years about the acute suf
fering of the Iraqi people.
UNICEF would report on it; the
WHO would report on it; my office
was trying to draw attention within
the U.N. system, and politically
there wasn't really that concern.
[The] question has to be asked:
How come the very widespread
support and empathy that was
there toward the United States im
mediately after the attacks of 9/11,
how has that somehow dissipated
so much? How come more than
half the peoples of the world do
not want a war against Iraq under
present circumstances? And I
think that the switch from a focus
on al-Qaida and a focus from ad
dressing acts of terrorism to almost
inevitability of a war on Iraq has re
ally impacted very negatively on
world opinion ...
My own view is that that there is
more we can do [to prevent a war].

I think the political focus now, with
the political support behind the in
spections, is dramatically changing
the situation . . . The Arab coun
tries in the region are putting great
pressure on Saddam Hussein.
Maybe he'll be persuaded to leave
quietly if he gets some kind of
amnesty. Maybe we can have a per
manent monitoring presence
that's much more effective than
containment...
I fear greatly that a war at this
stage, certainly from a human
rights perspective, has a lot of un
foreseeable consequences, espe
cially if it's a war without that glob
al legitimacy of the Security Coun
cil framework.
TD: The Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has also been an important
topic on college campuses, and
during your role as U.N. high
commissioner, you dealt with this
issue a lot. What is your perspec
tive on the situation now?
MR: ... It's desperately impor
tant that we address it for the sake
of the two peoples, the Palestinians
and Israelis. I have consistently
condemned suicide attacks on civil
ians, and I'm also deeply con
cerned, particularly now, about the
actual humanitarian situation of
the Palestinian population. We
know that the [United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency] ... is run
ning out of money [to assist the
Palestinians], and the attention is
elsewhere — Afghanistan under
standably, and maybe now Iraq,
but you can't have several million
people starving in a very contained
context, where already there has
been too much bloodletting. We
have to give it more political atten
tion. To me it's the priority to bring
our world back together again.
TD: The credibility of the Unit
ed Nations has always been ques
tioned over the years. Many peo
ple claim that the human rights
agenda usually succumbs to secu
rity and other interests. From your
role at the United Nations, do you
think this statement is valid?
MR: 1 must say that working
within the U.N. and giving leader
ship on human rights, I sort of felt
that the U.N. fits Winston
Churchill's notion of democracy:
"It's the worst system except for all
the others."
The U.N. undoubtedly needs to
strengthen itself in the area of
human rights. First of all, with re

sources — it did shock me when I
took my job as high commissioner
that the budget of the U.N. allo
cates less than 2 percent to all of
the work in human rights, and
that's still the case ...
But having worked for five
years within the system, I'm ab
solutely convinced that our global
izing, interconnected world needs
the United Nations, that the Unit
ed States, as the superpower which
has the power to act alone, very
much needs the United Nations
for moral legitimacy in order to
avoid the perception that might is
right...
We're in a very dangerous mo
ment right now with this situation
over Iraq. Rifts have opened up
between Europe and the United
States, which I deeply regret... I
think it's time that we come to
gether and say it's more important

I always find it very troubling that we didn't
care enough about what is sometimes called
collateral damage. In my view, people are
not collateral damage; they are people.

that we find the common ground
in addressing real threats to [the
U.S.], but also internationally.
TD: It has widely been reported
that the Bush administration op
posed the extension of your term
as high commissioner. Why did
you leave your post at the U.N.?
MR: The term of high commis
sioner is a four-year term, and it
can be renewed once. Before the
end of the four years, I actually in

dicated that 1 wouldn't be seeking
another term ... I was then per
suaded by [U.N. Secretary-Gener
al] Kofi Annan himself and by
grassroots human lights people to
continue fora further year . . .
When the terrible attacks took
place on 9 / 11, and I saw the diffi
cult aftermath we just talked
about, I felt I'm not somebody who
leaves a position when things get
even tougher. I indicated quietly
to the secretary-general that if he
wanted to have me stay on for the
end of the term — for another
three years — I would be certainly
open to consider that, and he said
he would consult [with other mem
bers of the United Nations]. And
obviously when he consulted [with
the United States], he got the view,
"No, she's too critical."
I think it was the criticism of the
prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, the
use of immigration law, [and] con
cern about the extent of the
[death] toll of civilians in
Afghanistan. I always find it very
troubling that we didn't care
enough about what is sometimes
called collateral damage. In my
view, people are not collateral
damage; they are people. And the
Afghan civilians, the families who
were killed or who had family

about, I felt I'm not somebody who
leaves a position when things get
even tougher. I indicated quietly
to the secretary-general that if he
wanted to have me stay on for the
end of the term — for another
three years — I would be certainly
open to consider that, and he said
he would consult [with other mem
bers of the United Nations]. And
obviously when he consulted [with
the United States], he got the view,
"No, she's too critical."
I think it was the criticism of the
prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, the
use of immigration law, [and] con
cern about the extent of the
[death] toll of civilians in
Afghanistan. I always find it very
troubling that we didn't care
enough about what is sometimes
called collateral damage. In my
view, people are not collateral
damage; they are people. And the
Afghan civilians, the families who
were killed or who had family
members killed were as innocent
as those civilians who were in the
Twin Towers, and I subscribe to
the Universal Declaration that we
are equal in dignity and worth,
and yet there was a great tribute
and honoring of those people who
were killed in the Twin Towers.
We didn't even want to know how
many [died] or what [their] names
were or what the circumstances
were of the Afghan civilians. I had
to be a voice for them because they
had no voice otherwise.
I think for these reasons 1 was an
uncomfortable presence. I think
the U.S. was the dominant [factor
for pressuring me to leave the U.N.]
because, even though I was critical
of countries like China and Russia,
they assured me that they would be
happy to see me continue.

Former Irish President Mary Robinson discusses her views on ethics and
global policies with The Daily yesterday.
Yesterday morning, Mary Robinson, the former
president of Ireland and also the U.N. high commis
sioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002, sat down
with The Daily fora 30-minute interview to discuss
her current work with the newly established Ethical
Globalization Initiative, why the United States pres
sured her to leave the United Nations, human rights
concerns with Africa, the potential war in Iraq and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Daily: As the head of the Ethical Globalization

Initiative, how do you think human rights activists can
ensure that ethical and moral issues are in the debate
over globalization? What do you think Stanford stu
dents can do regarding this issue?
Mary Robinson: I'm trying to . . . take human
rights out of its box and say the human rights values
and the process of holding governments to account
ability is relevant to the wider issues of globalization.
We're trying to focus on a few issues ... like attacking
HIV/AIDS . . . [and] issues of migration. How come
we accept the world to have a free exchange of goods
and services and capital but [have] so many barriers to
people?...
What can universities, what can students do? I
think we just need to engage more
in linking human rights, democra
cy and development, helping de
veloping countries to do it, but also
doing it in our own countries. . . .
I'm also very keen that the United
States would come closer to the in
ternational agenda on human
rights ... where the two streams of
human rights — civil and political
rights, and economic, social and
cultural rights — are regarded as
equally important... I think in the
U.S. there is a cultural sense that
civil and political rights are real
human rights and economic, social
and cultural rights are political as
pirations.

Ifear greatly that a war at this stage,
certainly from a human rights perspective,
has a lot of unforeseeable consequences.

TD: Regarding your talk on
human rights protection in Africa,
how do you think these issues can
become a greater agenda in the
United States, not only on a politi
cal level but also on an academic
and local level?
MR: When I was [U.N.] high
commissioner, a part of my man
date ... was to monitor the way in
which African countries were ful
filling their human rights obliga
tions. And very often they were in
the dark. There were violations.
There was conflict. They were not
progressively implementing the
various rights, etc., and I felt it was
important to do that... but we also
have to be more supportive.
When I was talking about
[human rights in Africa] a few
years ago, I had a sense that there
wasn't a sense of connection be
tween [the issue and] the United
States, and indeed the citizens of
the United States. There was focus
on other issues — the Middle East,
now North Korea. But I think that
the human insecurity in our world
today is making the real point of
interconnectedness that it's impor
tant also to the future of the Unit-

Ed States, government and people,
that we don't have failed states in
Africa . . . that [we don't have
Africans who] reach a certain level
[of prosperity] and then . . . know
that there is another world that
they will never be able to attain and
who are potentially open to be ma
nipulated to violence, to acts of ter
rorism and soon ...
TD: Another hot issue on the
Stanford campus is the situation
with Iraq. From a human rights
standpoint, what are your particular
views regarding the potential war?
MR: Ive been trying to ap
proach the [conflict with Iraq] from
a human rights perspective, and I
was very concerned as high com
missioner about the situation of
human rights in Iraq. Saddam
Hussein has been violating rights

of the citizens, and he has been ma
nipulating the sanctions to make
the situation even worse. But it
troubled me that the sanctions
were capable of that kind of manip
ulation. So it wasn't a very good
human rights situation, and,
frankly, we didn't care enough
over the years about the acute suf
fering of the Iraqi people.
UNICEF would report on it; the
WHO would report on it; my office
was trying to draw attention within
the U.N. system, and politically
there wasn't really that concern.
[The] question has to be asked:
How come the very widespread
support and empathy that was
there toward the United States im
mediately after the attacks of 9/11,
how has that somehow dissipated
so much? How come more than
half the peoples of the world do
not want a war against Iraq under
present circumstances? And I
think that the switch from a focus
on al-Qaida and a focus from ad
dressing acts of terrorism to almost
inevitability of a war on Iraq has re
ally impacted very negatively on
world opinion ...
My own view is that that there is
more we can do [to prevent a war].

I think the political focus now, with
the political support behind the in
spections, is dramatically changing
the situation . . . The Arab coun
tries in the region are putting great
pressure on Saddam Hussein.
Maybe he'll be persuaded to leave
quietly if he gets some kind of
amnesty. Maybe we can have a per
manent monitoring presence
that's much more effective than
containment...
I fear greatly that a war at this
stage, certainly from a human
rights perspective, has a lot of un
foreseeable consequences, espe
cially if it's a war without that glob
al legitimacy of the Security Coun
cil framework.
TD: The Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has also been an important
topic on college campuses, and
during your role as U.N. high
commissioner, you dealt with this
issue a lot. What is your perspec
tive on the situation now?
MR: ... It's desperately impor
tant that we address it for the sake
of the two peoples, the Palestinians
and Israelis. I have consistently
condemned suicide attacks on civil
ians, and I'm also deeply con
cerned, particularly now, about the
actual humanitarian situation of
the Palestinian population. We
know that the [United Nations Re
lief and Works Agency] ... is run
ning out of money [to assist the
Palestinians], and the attention is
elsewhere — Afghanistan under
standably, and maybe now Iraq,
but you can't have several million
people starving in a very contained
context, where already there has
been too much bloodletting. We
have to give it more political atten
tion. To me it's the priority to bring
our world back together again.
TD: The credibility of the Unit
ed Nations has always been ques
tioned over the years. Many peo
ple claim that the human rights
agenda usually succumbs to secu
rity and other interests. From your
role at the United Nations, do you
think this statement is valid?
MR: 1 must say that working
within the U.N. and giving leader
ship on human rights, I sort of felt
that the U.N. fits Winston
Churchill's notion of democracy:
"It's the worst system except for all
the others."
The U.N. undoubtedly needs to
strengthen itself in the area of
human rights. First of all, with re

sources — it did shock me when I
took my job as high commissioner
that the budget of the U.N. allo
cates less than 2 percent to all of
the work in human rights, and
that's still the case ...
But having worked for five
years within the system, I'm ab
solutely convinced that our global
izing, interconnected world needs
the United Nations, that the Unit
ed States, as the superpower which
has the power to act alone, very
much needs the United Nations
for moral legitimacy in order to
avoid the perception that might is
right...
We're in a very dangerous mo
ment right now with this situation
over Iraq. Rifts have opened up
between Europe and the United
States, which I deeply regret... I
think it's time that we come to
gether and say it's more important

I always find it very troubling that we didn't
care enough about what is sometimes called
collateral damage. In my view, people are
not collateral damage; they are people.

that we find the common ground
in addressing real threats to [the
U.S.], but also internationally.
TD: It has widely been reported
that the Bush administration op
posed the extension of your term
as high commissioner. Why did
you leave your post at the U.N.?
MR: The term of high commis
sioner is a four-year term, and it
can be renewed once. Before the
end of the four years, I actually in

dicated that 1 wouldn't be seeking
another term ... I was then per
suaded by [U.N. Secretary-Gener
al] Kofi Annan himself and by
grassroots human lights people to
continue fora further year . . .
When the terrible attacks took
place on 9 / 11, and I saw the diffi
cult aftermath we just talked
about, I felt I'm not somebody who
leaves a position when things get
even tougher. I indicated quietly
to the secretary-general that if he
wanted to have me stay on for the
end of the term — for another
three years — I would be certainly
open to consider that, and he said
he would consult [with other mem
bers of the United Nations]. And
