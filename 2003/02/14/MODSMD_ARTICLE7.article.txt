# Valentine's breeds creativity

### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's Valentine's Day on the Farm, and
though the holiday has some students
scrambling for traditional flowers and
candy, many boyfriends, girlfriends and
singletons all over campus have more
unique plans in mind.
The most popular events include Mixed
Company's annual "Love Sucks!" tribute to
Valentine's Day bitterness held in the
Toyon lounge — no dates are allowed — as
well as Jammix, where students can waltz,
swing or even polka the night away. Tickets
to Viennese Ball will be sold all night long at
the event, which starts tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Roble Dance Studio.
A notable addition to Stanford's Valen
tine's lineup is LARP, a live-action, role
playing game during which people are as
signed characters and act out various situa
tions.
"[LARP] is kind of a huge, extravagant
improvisational theater event," said
freshman Max Etchemendy, who plans to
attend with other members of the Stan

ford Gaming Society. "This one of course
will have a Valentine's Day theme, no
doubt with more sinister and supernatur
al twists than you can shake a stick at. I
doubt it will be very romantic, but I might
be proven wrong."
Those with significant others are also
opting for originality this year. While some
write poetry for one another or plan to
scout for the perfect dessert shop during
their evening out, others plan to use tech
nology to express their emotions.
"There is a certain guy I'm talking to,
and we often study together," said fresh
man Laura Surma. "He told me once he
liked my study music, so I'rn burning him a
CD of his own."
With romance in the air, some dorms
have their own special plans. This morning
the gentlemen at Freshman / Sophomore
College, dressed in formal attire, awoke
each FroSoCo latly with a rose and invited
her to a special Valentine's Day breakfast at
Ricker Dining Hall, where they were sere
naded by the Mendicants. Other dorms had

similar events.
When it comes to fine dining,
transportation can be a stum
bling block on Valentine's Day.
Students with cars find it much
easier to escape to fancy down
town restaurants and concerts.
One such student, sophomore
Emmy Davis, is even going to
Los Angeles to spend the
evening at the Phish concert
with friends.
"V-day is supposed to be about
love, right?" Davis said. "Well, I
don't have a valentine but I do love
Phish. It's going to be a great time
despite my being single."
In fact, romance doesn't seem
to be the primary concern for
many students who view Valen
tine's Day as a way to express all
forms of love, especially friend
ship.
"I've enjoyed Valentine's Day
every year, whether I was in a rela
tionship or not," said senior Tom
Whitnah. "I've always done things
like plan romantic adventures and
buy flowers for my platonic friends
because I think when two people
are sentimental or romantic by na
ture, there's no reason they should
limit this nature to non-platonic
relationships."
Sophomore Nancy McKeown
agreed with Whitnah.
"I like the idea behind Valen
tine's Day, and don't think show
ing that you care should be limited

to your significant other," she said.
McKeown added, "As for Stan
ford, 1 think we manage to find
stuff to do, so we're not totally bit
ter."
Freshman Marie Cannizzaro
said, "I think that Valentine's Day
is just like everything else at Stan
ford — if you choose to believe the
myths about the desolate dating at
mosphere, then that's what you
will find."
For most students, bitterness
resides in the combination of the
financial problems the holiday
often presents and the interfer
ence of academic concerns.
"I like the day, I'm just not
going to spend money foolishly on
it," said sophomore Rafer Willen
berg. "Besides, I really don't have
that much money to spare."
Etchemendy said, "Forget ro
mantic love — I'm more con
cerned about my professor's lack
of purely platonic love, as demon
strated by the two midterms they
have so heartlessly assigned for the
14th."
Despite rumors that Stanford is
only breeding grounds for Valen
tine's Day desolation, the campus
will be alive with serenading a cap
pella groups, students distributing
candy and roses, as well as a host of
alternative events.
"I love the holiday, as much as
I used to complain about it," said
junior Tracy Williams. "I think it
gives people a great chance to
hope that even if nothing hap
pens the rest of the year, V-day
could be the day when some
thing does."

"There is a certain guy I'm talking to,
and we often study together," said fresh
man Laura Surma. "He told me once he
liked my study music, so I'rn burning him a
CD of his own."
With romance in the air, some dorms
have their own special plans. This morning

similar events.
When it comes to fine dining,
transportation can be a stum
bling block on Valentine's Day.
Students with cars find it much
easier to escape to fancy down
town restaurants and concerts.
One such student, sophomore
Emmy Davis, is even going to
Los Angeles to spend the
evening at the Phish concert
with friends.
"V-day is supposed to be about
love, right?" Davis said. "Well, I
don't have a valentine but I do love
Phish. It's going to be a great time
despite my being single."
In fact, romance doesn't seem
to be the primary concern for
many students who view Valen
tine's Day as a way to express all
forms of love, especially friend
ship.
"I've enjoyed Valentine's Day
every year, whether I was in a rela
tionship or not," said senior Tom
Whitnah. "I've always done things
like plan romantic adventures and
buy flowers for my platonic friends
because I think when two people
are sentimental or romantic by na
ture, there's no reason they should
limit this nature to non-platonic
relationships."
Sophomore Nancy McKeown
agreed with Whitnah.
"I like the idea behind Valen
tine's Day, and don't think show
ing that you care should be limited

to your significant other," she said.
McKeown added, "As for Stan
ford, 1 think we manage to find
stuff to do, so we're not totally bit
ter."
Freshman Marie Cannizzaro
said, "I think that Valentine's Day
is just like everything else at Stan
ford — if you choose to believe the
myths about the desolate dating at
mosphere, then that's what you
will find."
For most students, bitterness
resides in the combination of the
financial problems the holiday
often presents and the interfer
ence of academic concerns.
"I like the day, I'm just not
going to spend money foolishly on
it," said sophomore Rafer Willen
berg. "Besides, I really don't have
that much money to spare."
Etchemendy said, "Forget ro
mantic love — I'm more con
cerned about my professor's lack
of purely platonic love, as demon
strated by the two midterms they
have so heartlessly assigned for the
14th."
Despite rumors that Stanford is
only breeding grounds for Valen
tine's Day desolation, the campus
will be alive with serenading a cap
pella groups, students distributing
candy and roses, as well as a host of
alternative events.
"I love the holiday, as much as
I used to complain about it," said
junior Tracy Williams. "I think it
gives people a great chance to
hope that even if nothing hap
pens the rest of the year, V-day
could be the day when some
thing does."
