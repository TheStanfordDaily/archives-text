It's Valentine's Day on the Farm, and
though the holiday has some students
scrambling for traditional flowers and
candy, many boyfriends, girlfriends and
singletons all over campus have more
unique plans in mind.
The most popular events include Mixed
Company's annual "Love Sucks!" tribute to
Valentine's Day bitterness held in the
Toyon lounge — no dates are allowed — as
well as Jammix, where students can waltz,
swing or even polka the night away. Tickets
to Viennese Ball will be sold all night long at
the event, which starts tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Roble Dance Studio.
A notable addition to Stanford's Valen
tine's lineup is LARP, a live-action, role
playing game during which people are as
signed characters and act out various situa
tions.
"[LARP] is kind of a huge, extravagant
improvisational theater event," said
freshman Max Etchemendy, who plans to
attend with other members of the Stan

ford Gaming Society. "This one of course
will have a Valentine's Day theme, no
doubt with more sinister and supernatur
al twists than you can shake a stick at. I
doubt it will be very romantic, but I might
be proven wrong."
Those with significant others are also
opting for originality this year. While some
write poetry for one another or plan to
scout for the perfect dessert shop during
their evening out, others plan to use tech
nology to express their emotions.
"There is a certain guy I'm talking to,
and we often study together," said fresh
man Laura Surma. "He told me once he
liked my study music, so I'rn burning him a
CD of his own."
With romance in the air, some dorms
have their own special plans. This morning
the gentlemen at Freshman / Sophomore
College, dressed in formal attire, awoke
each FroSoCo latly with a rose and invited
her to a special Valentine's Day breakfast at
Ricker Dining Hall, where they were sere
naded by the Mendicants. Other dorms had
