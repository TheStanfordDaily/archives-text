# Act of intolerance prompts University response
## 
### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN 
Dean of Students Marc Wais sent out an e
mail to most campus lists the first week of Feb
ruary detailing a reported act of racism and in
tolerance. The e-mail described a Jan. 25 inci
dent in which four female students were ha
rassed by what they say could be as many as 10
individuals while rafting on Lake Lagunita.
In the e-mail Wais called the incident "trou
bling due to the threatening and intimidating
circumstances, coupled with the racist com
ments."
In the e-mail, Wais also wrote, "These peo
ple apparently thought that the Stanford stu
dents were Latina" — a comment that several
students have found offensive and insensitive.
"People who didn't know [that] the students
Marc Wais was referring to were us remarked,
'How callous and flippant the one-line state
ment was,' " sophomore Alexa Aulie, one of the
students on the raft, said.
Many of the four Stanford undergraduates
were Latinas. On Jan. 25, the students said they
were speaking in Spanish and listening to Latin
music. However, once they lowered the music,
the students on the raft heard what sophomore
Ariel Sklar called "degrading" and "intimidat
ing" racist comments, spoken with what Aulie
said was "English and very broken Spanish,
probably what they had heard from TV."
The group on shore grew from two individ

uals to about 10 over a period of about an hour
and a hall. It is unclear whether they were Stan
ford students.
Sophomore Man I layman said they ignored
the "hostile and obnoxious" comments from the
group. These comments included the phrases
"We're calling immigration" and "Go back to
Mexico." Wais did not repeat these comments in
the e-mail, but described them as "racist."
"I seriously felt physically threatened," said
sophomore Angela Bunch. "I was scared. We
didn't want to go to the shore while they were
still there because they had waited for so long.
They were getting more hyped up as they wait
ed,"
Sklar added, "I felt scared. I don't think I
have ever been scared on the Stanford campus
before."
Upon returning to their residence, sopho
more Luis Gonzalez, a neighbor, said the stu
dents were "upset" and "looked shaken."
The students reported the incident to Vice
Provost Gene Awakuni about a week later. He
called such behavior "unacceptable." He later
referred them to Wais.
Aulie said she was not reassured by her
subsequent meeting with Wais. She said,
"Dean Wais asked if it was possible if they
thought we were EPA kids, that if we had spo
ken in English it would have diffused the situ
ation sooner."
After having discussed the situation with

Wais, the students said they felt discouraged.
"Is the basis of respect an English-speaking
Stanford student?" asked Aulie.
Wais said his statements were taken out of
context and refused to respond to the allega
tions of insensitivity.
"It creates a story that isn't a story, in my
opinion," he said.
Wais added that he had no indication that
his comments upset the students and that they
had not approached him about the e-mail.
Wais asserted that his primary concern was
for the students' safety and well-being. He of
fered them assistance, as per University policy,
saying that he was "very distressed to hear
about the racist nature of the verbal comments
directed at the students."
As dean of students, Wais' duties include no
tifying the campus community of acts of intol
erance and providing follow-up support to vic
tims, as well as referring them to other campus
resources.
Last year at Stanford, there were 40 acts of in
tolerance reported to the Dean of Students Of
fice. This academic year there have been 12 such
acts; last year at this time there were 20, Wais
said, indicating a decrease in acts of intolerance.
Stanford's official protocol for acts of intoler
ance defines them as "conduct that adversely
targets an individual or group on the basis of
sex, race, color, disability, religion,
sexual orientation and / or nation
al / ethnic origin." The protocol
also states that Stanford is "com
mitted to the ongoing education of
its faculty, staff and students to
prevent and respond to acts of in
tolerance."
The harassed students said they
feel the student body needs to be
better educated on how to re
spond to such acts.
"Things can be done to teach
people about these things and to
expose people to different ideas,"
said Bunch.
Hayman said, "We didn't know

the procedure, most people don't.
.. Stanford's policy for reporting
hate incidents needs to be clearly
outlined and publicized, then inte
grated into residential education."
"It should be common knowl
edge and it's not," she added. "If
we had immediately known
what steps to take when this inci
dent happened, then the kids
who did this could have been
confronted immediately. They
wouldn't have gotten away with
what they did."
According to University poli
cy, anyone who is either the vic
tim or a witness to an act of intol
erance or racism is encouraged to
report it to the Vice Provost for
Campus Relations (723-3484), or
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs (725-1808).
