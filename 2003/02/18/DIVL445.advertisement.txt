Blumberg's career has been
a pursuit of inherited varia
tion and susceptibility to dis
ease. His research has taken
him all over the world and,
because sharing hypotheses
and data is vital to it, has led
him to work with many
diverse individuals and
groups. His discovery of the
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)result
ed from epidemiological
studies in different cultures.
He tells the HBV story in a
lively manner, with touches
of humor, imparting that
among the many spin-offs
from that research has been
the "sensational" control of
a type of liver cancer, and
raising such questions as
whether HBV affects the sex
ratio of births. Obviously,
further research on viral
causes of cancer may prove
to be of considerable value.
The Nobel Prize-winning
author has written for both
scientists and nonscientists.
