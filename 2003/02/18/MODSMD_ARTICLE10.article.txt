# Blizzard covers Northeast, causes fatalities
## 
### 
(AP) â€” The worst blizzard in seven
years shut down much of the Northeast
yesterday with blinding, windblown
snow that piled up as much as 4 feet
deep and left more than a quarter of a
million homes and businesses shivering
without power.
At least 21 deaths had been blamed
on the storm system since it charged out
of the Plains during the weekend, pil
ing snow in the Ohio Valley, producing
mudslides and floods in the southern
Appalachians, and making layers of ice

that snapped trees and power lines.
The storm was headed for New Eng
land, where Massachusetts expected up
to 2 feet of snow and minor coastal
flooding.
Airports for Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York largely
shut down, stranding thousands of pas
sengers trying to leave and get into the
region. Amtrak's north-south service
was halted between Washington and
Richmond, Va., and regional bus ser
vice stopped in many areas.

The holiday meant there were few
commuters, but police from Kentucky
to Massachusetts pleaded with mo
torists to stay home and some counties
banned nonessential travel so they
could clear the roads.
"This is going to be days worth of
cleanup," said Maryland Highway Ad
ministration spokesman David Buck.
The western tip of Maryland was
buried, with 49 inches of snow in Gar
rett County on top of 30-foot drifts left
by earlier storms. Area roads, some sur

rounded by 12-foot-high walls of snow,
"look like canals," said Garrett County
state highway supervisor Paul Mcln
tyre.
Among the many travelers stranded
by the storm, few were as far from home
as Lynn Anderson of Belfast, Ireland.
"It's turned into a complete night
mare," said Anderson, who arrived in
Philadelphia on Sunday hoping to go to
Williamsburg, Va., but had to stay
overnight in a downtown Philadelphia
hotel.
