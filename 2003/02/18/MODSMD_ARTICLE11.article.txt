## The 						Stanford Daily Helpful advice 
### 
Editorial

Academic advising for students, both
graduate and undergraduate, is an
essential part of a student's scholar
ly growth and success. The Daily
reported last week the strengths and flaws of
graduate student advising — that while
most graduate students develop strong,
comfortable and long-lasting relationships
with their advisers, some have admitted to
transferring departments or to having their
research funding cut off due to conflicts with
their advisers.
While the role of an academic adviser
differs for graduate and undergraduate
students, we are reminded — in light of
the aforementioned report — that the
undergraduate advising system at Stan
ford falls short of meeting some of its in
tended goals. As this year's freshmen pass
the midway point of their first year at
Stanford, we take a moment to evaluate
the current undergraduate advising sys
tem and offer a few suggestions, particu
larly concerning the roles of the academic
adviser, peer academic adviser and head
peer academic coordinator for freshman
students.
Each incoming freshman is assigned an
academic adviser — a faculty member, staff
member, research associate or graduate stu
dent — who serves until the student de
clares a major. Each academic adviser is as
signed to advise six to eight freshmen; the
responsibilities of the academic adviser in
clude helping the student adjust to the Stan
ford environment and providing both aca
demic and personal guidance.
During a freshman's fall quarter, the
academic adviser's involvement in selecting
courses is particularly important. Current
ly, the University registrar places a regis
tration hold on freshmen to prevent enroll
ment in classes before meeting with their
academic advisers; the hold is lifted at 1
p.m. on the first day that advisers can meet
with students. We believe that this policy,
which only affects fall quarter registration,
provides the right amount of structure and
flexibility for freshmen. Upon their arrival
to Stanford, most freshmen do not have a
clear idea of which classes or subjects they
should take; in many cases it is important
that students identify their interests early
so that they begin taking important intro
ductory courses. Even among those who
initially have a clear idea of what they want
to study, many change their minds.
We feel that freshmen have much to gain
from consulting an academic adviser prior
to enrolling in University courses for the
very first time. Academic advisers can often
provide insight into classes, professors and
majors that is not found in the Bulletin —
based on feedback from past students or
from the experiences of other advisers. We
encourage both advisers and freshmen ad
visees to meet regularly — not just during

the beginning of fall quarter.
However, we recognize that some stu
dents feel that academic advisers are not
very familiar with or knowledgeable of
their academic pursuits. While some stu
dents are matched with an academic ad
viser whose academic or research interest
is similar to their own — a student inter
ested in economics may be assigned to an
economics professor — others are not
Even though we understand the in
evitability of this situation — for instance,
many professors or graduate students are
often busy as teachers or as teaching assis
tants for classes and advising upperclass
men students who have declared their
majors — we feel that academic advisers
should be, first and foremost, the gateway
to the myriad of resources on campus for
freshmen.
We understand that academic advisers
won't always know all the answers to all
the questions, but we expect them to know
where the answers can be found. Whether
it is directing the freshmen to the Career
Development Center to inquire about
summer internship opportunities or ar
ranging a meeting with a department
chairperson, we believe that an academic
adviser should be the starting point for
any freshman looking to best utilize the
opportunities offered at an elite research
university.
But unfortunately, many students cur
rently view the academic advising system
as nothing more than a free meal (at a
restaurant or at the adviser's home) every
quarter. We feel that the Undergraduate
Advising Center, which runs academic ad
vising, must do a better job in attracting
and retaining freshmen to the program
— in the sense that they are made aware
of the great resource academic advisers
can play. It may mean that the center
sponsors more events for advisers and ad
visees to meet — aside from one-on-one
meetings.
And on the part of the academic advisers,
we feel that they must prove themselves to be
a valuable resource to their advisees during
the first initial, mandatory meeting. Advisers
should find out what their advisees' interests
— academic and otherwise — are and how
those interests can flourish at Stanford. Each
advisee should leave that meeting having
scheduled a second meeting or arranged a
system of communication. Consistent com
munication — e-mail is usually the most
convenient — is key to developing a rela
tionship from which the freshmen can truly
benefit.
The academic advising system at Stanford
has potential to be an invaluable resource for
freshmen. But we also believe that the sys
tem as is does not fulfill its goal of connecting
students with educational opportunities
on campus.

academic adviser — a faculty member, staff
member, research associate or graduate stu
dent — who serves until the student de
clares a major. Each academic adviser is as
signed to advise six to eight freshmen; the
responsibilities of the academic adviser in
clude helping the student adjust to the Stan
ford environment and providing both aca
demic and personal guidance.
During a freshman's fall quarter, the
academic adviser's involvement in selecting
courses is particularly important. Current
ly, the University registrar places a regis
tration hold on freshmen to prevent enroll
ment in classes before meeting with their
academic advisers; the hold is lifted at 1
p.m. on the first day that advisers can meet
with students. We believe that this policy,
which only affects fall quarter registration,
provides the right amount of structure and
flexibility for freshmen. Upon their arrival
to Stanford, most freshmen do not have a
clear idea of which classes or subjects they
should take; in many cases it is important
that students identify their interests early
so that they begin taking important intro
ductory courses. Even among those who
initially have a clear idea of what they want
to study, many change their minds.
We feel that freshmen have much to gain
from consulting an academic adviser prior
to enrolling in University courses for the
very first time. Academic advisers can often
provide insight into classes, professors and
majors that is not found in the Bulletin —
based on feedback from past students or
from the experiences of other advisers. We
encourage both advisers and freshmen ad
visees to meet regularly — not just during

the beginning of fall quarter.
However, we recognize that some stu
dents feel that academic advisers are not
very familiar with or knowledgeable of
their academic pursuits. While some stu
dents are matched with an academic ad
viser whose academic or research interest
is similar to their own — a student inter
ested in economics may be assigned to an
economics professor — others are not
Even though we understand the in
evitability of this situation — for instance,
many professors or graduate students are
often busy as teachers or as teaching assis
tants for classes and advising upperclass
men students who have declared their
majors — we feel that academic advisers
should be, first and foremost, the gateway
to the myriad of resources on campus for
freshmen.
We understand that academic advisers
won't always know all the answers to all
the questions, but we expect them to know
where the answers can be found. Whether
it is directing the freshmen to the Career
Development Center to inquire about
summer internship opportunities or ar
ranging a meeting with a department
chairperson, we believe that an academic
adviser should be the starting point for
any freshman looking to best utilize the
opportunities offered at an elite research
university.
But unfortunately, many students cur
rently view the academic advising system
as nothing more than a free meal (at a
restaurant or at the adviser's home) every
quarter. We feel that the Undergraduate
Advising Center, which runs academic ad
vising, must do a better job in attracting
and retaining freshmen to the program
— in the sense that they are made aware
of the great resource academic advisers
can play. It may mean that the center
sponsors more events for advisers and ad
visees to meet — aside from one-on-one
meetings.
And on the part of the academic advisers,
we feel that they must prove themselves to be
a valuable resource to their advisees during
the first initial, mandatory meeting. Advisers
should find out what their advisees' interests
— academic and otherwise — are and how
those interests can flourish at Stanford. Each
advisee should leave that meeting having
scheduled a second meeting or arranged a
system of communication. Consistent com
munication — e-mail is usually the most
convenient — is key to developing a rela
tionship from which the freshmen can truly
benefit.
The academic advising system at Stanford
has potential to be an invaluable resource for
freshmen. But we also believe that the sys
tem as is does not fulfill its goal of connecting
students with educational opportunities
on campus.
