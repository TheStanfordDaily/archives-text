# LYING IN THE GRASS
## You fighting the war 
### 
So we're on the verge of war
with Iraq again. George W.
will finally complete the
tasks his father left unfin
ished a decade earlier: topple Hus
sein, free the Kurds and introduce
Baghdad to democracy. But right
before we barge through the palace
walls, suppose Saddam gets desper
ate and lobs a couple of chemical
stinkers over Tel Aviv. Israel natu
rally retaliates in kind, and the
United States soon finds itself em
broiled in a much-larger Middle
East conflict. All of a sudden, a
blindfolded George W. is pulling
your number out of a hat.
Please report to boot camp first
thing in the morning.
The initial hope is that any con
flict can be peacefully resolved
through mediation by the United
Nations or a neutral third-party.
But if the crazy despot is deaf then
we must resort to force. And that's
where the young people of America
come in. The propaganda machine
revs up its engine and starts pervad
ing our ideological core with catchy
mantras. It is our civic duty, they tell
us. It is highly honorable to defend
democracy against the invasion of
communism, fascism or any of the
other slew of authoritarian "-isms."
Still, do we, the young people,
really want to go to war?
In countries like Taiwan and
Singapore, a mandatory service pe
riod guarantees that it's not a ques
tion of "if," but "when." Because
those nations' sovereignty is under
ever-present threat, the young men
there accept military training as
part of their youth. But as members
of the world's only superpower, we
have the luxury of only having to
tackle the "if' part.
I wish things were simply a mat
ter of right vs. wrong.
World War II was clearly good

against evil, so the American people
formed a consensus in backing the
government's decisions. The Viet
nam War's aims, however, were far
less defined. Only after years of
massive protests and mounting
body counts did we pull ourselves
out of those malaria-infested jun
gles. And that is what I fear: not an
other Vietnam per se, but another
war with nebulous objectives and a

murky rationale.
If young peo
ple are to be sent
overseas, then we
should be as sup
portive of the war
efforts as the peo
ple who signed the
declarations into
official legislation.

Instead of reveling in the ROTG's
abolishment at Stanford, we hope to
witness its resurrection. Instead of
obeying directives in a Pavlovian
fashion, any policy that affects us is
first hashed-out in the pits of public
opinion.
We're aware of the realities of
war. Even though we're armed
with high-tech gadgetry, it's still far
more like "Saving Private Ryan"
than "Rambo." Some may get the
anonymity of launching a toma
hawk missile from a mile away, but
the majority will still see close com
bat, maybe even peering into the
enemy's eyes before firing a bullet
in his chest. And regardless of what
all the blind patriots say, there is lit
tle practical value in an honorable
death.
Yet death is still better than hav
ing your loved ones living out their
days under a suffocating hegemo
ny. If there is such a justifiable war,
let it define Generation Y, so that
at the very least, history will re
member us as the Second Greatest
Generation.

But if we're questioning every
thing, from the time we enlist to the
moment we're parachuting out of
the airplane, then it's wiser to dodge
conscription. There's no shame in it,
and you can still get elected presi
dent. During Vietnam, Clinton was
busy smoking (but not inhaling), all
while worrying about how draft
dodging would affect his political fu
ture. George W., as a member of the
Texas Air National Guard, was
staving off cattle invasion.
Sadly, any draft will only widen
the gap between the haves and
have-nots. After graduating from
college, the rich can pursue a
seven-year doctoral degree and a
law degree after that. If the rich
have a say (and they do), any con
flict will be a proxy-war fought not
with citizens of other countries, but
with America's own economically
disadvantaged.
Of course, at Stanford, we're
blessed with both wealth and edu
cation. And it looks like no conflicts
in the near future will compromise
our rights to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness â€” though we
still may be drafted nevertheless.
So how would you dodge?
Watch TV until you're legally
blind? Claim you've always been a
pacifist? Crossing over to Canada
used to be the method of choice,
but things might be a little more
difficult now that it's unofficially
the 51st state. Fortunately there's
also Mexico. That'll certainly be a
sight: U.S. patrol guards who once
shined their headlights on Mexi
can migrants, are now flagging
young American men down as
they desperately flee south of the
border, to the new promised land.

"No drafts " is an anagram of Stanford.
Convince him it's purely coincidental at
