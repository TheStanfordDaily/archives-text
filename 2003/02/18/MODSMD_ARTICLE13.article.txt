Engaging in national issues
This week (Feb. 16-22) has been desig
nated National Civic Engagement Week
on college and university campuses across
the country. The week of activities and
events is being sponsored by Campus
Compact, an organization of university
presidents committed to encouraging civic
engagement and community involvement
among students. Stanford is an active
member of Campus Compact and many
campus student groups have come togeth
er to organize a series of events on our
campus this week.
I encourage our students and the entire
Stanford community to participate in cam
pus events connected to National Civic En
gagement Week. Today's edition of The
Daily includes an insert with more infor
mation on the week's events and activities.
In this time of momentous national debate
and increasing international tension, it is
important we remain collectively engaged
and participate with others to find mean
ingful and long-lasting solutions to build
stronger communities and a better world.

Affirmative action is racist
Individuals should be judged on their
actions, not on circumstances beyond their
control.
Any way you slice it, affirmative action is
racist; it perpetuates the superstition that
melanin affects a person's character and
abilities.
An admissions policy free from racism is
no barrier to true diversity, or to even the
superficial varieties thereof. Economically
disadvantaged applicants of all colors
should be judged by their efforts in spite of
their situations, not by their poverty or
pigmentation itself.
"I have a dream that my four little chil
dren will one day live in a nation where
they will not be judged by the color of their
skin but by the content of their character."
Imagine that.

A Valentine's Day tradition
for everyone
I was disappointed — but not sur
prised — by the heteronormativity of the
Feb. 14 article, "Valentine's breeds cre
ativity." In an article ostensibly covering
creativity on campus, I was frustrated to

see that the article only portrayed the very
socially acceptable relationships and tra
ditions. The article neither represented
creativity nor did it acknowledge the di
versity of identities and ways of loving on
this campus.
Despite the presence of a significant
lesbian, gay and bisexual community on
campus, this group continues to be
marginalized on a campus where a het
erosexual assumption dominates the so
cial environment. The article, for exam
ple, highlights the Stanford tradition for
men in a dorm to rise early, dress up, and
roll out the women with flowers and
breakfast. However fun and heartwarm
ing this tradition may seem, it carries a
powerful message: Valentine's Day is
conceived as holiday for patriarchal het
erosexual relationships.
This perpetuates gender inequality and
the invisibility of the lesbian, gay and bi
sexual community. Many dorms this year
made the effort to express that everyone
is equally welcome in all dorm activities.
Arroyo, Okada and Francos, amongst
others, decided to have staff and upper
class residents roll out straight men,
straight women and this often-forgotten
community as well. These activities were
much more "creative" than those in the
Freshman / Sophomore College, but
were completely ignored in the article.

This Valentine's day, Stanford men
were taking their boyfriends out, women
were sending flowers and cards to other
women and some people found them
selves feeling left out because they don't
identify as traditionally male or female.
Thank goodness some progressive staff
members and individuals were doing their
part on campus to include those the article
in The Daily unfortunately excluded.

Holding Robinson accountable
I am sorry that the interview conducted
with Mary Robinson was incomplete (Feb.
14). The Durbin Conference on Human
Rights that she chaired became a water
shed event for the anti-Semites of the 21st
century. Robinson failed not only the Jews
who were caricatured as hook-nosed Nazis
and not allowed to speak in their own de
fense, but also other oppressed groups for
which she had no time left over to defend.
Robinson should also be held accountable
for the waves of European and Canadian
anti-Semitism that followed the Durbin
conference.
