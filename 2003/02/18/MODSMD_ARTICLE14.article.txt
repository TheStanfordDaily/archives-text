## Cougars get dunked 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Everyone was all smiles after the No.
24 Stanford men's basketball team (19-
6, 10-3 Pacific-10 Conference) defeated
Washington State (5-17, 0-13 Pac-10)
72-54 on Saturday.

Men's Basketball
Saturday: No. 24 Stanford 72, Washington
State, 54
at USC, Thursday, 7:30 p.m.

Even junior Tyler Besecker who hit
two free throws (his fourth and fifth
points of the season) with a little over a
minute left to play, smiled. Even fresh
man walk-on Carlton Weatherby who
scored his first points this season on a 3-
point shot that he banked in with 14
seconds remaining in the game. Even
senior team manager turned team
member Olatunde Sobomehin, who
failed to score, but was fouled on a put
back after grabbing an offensive re
bound with 1:23 left to play.
And especially junior forward Justin
Davis, who celebrated his return to the
Cardinal starting lineup (and his free
dom from the knee brace) with 21
points, 10 boards and two blocks in
only 22 minutes of play, had something
to smile about.
This performance, this offensive
outburst by Davis, has been a long time
coming. For awhile, it seemed as if
flashes of those pearly whites were part
of a distant Stanford past and it might
be too early to speculate but his show
ing Saturday suggests the obvious.
Heeee's baa-ack.
"Justin responded very well," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery of Davis who tallied his first
double-double since Dec. 30 and his
first start since Jan. 5. "[He] was huge.
He kept taking it at them."
"If I come with a lot of energy then
the rest of the team follows," Davis
added. "I'm like a catalyst— [my ener
gy] just spreads."
Furthermore, Davis' offensive pres
ence relieves a lot of pressure on fellow
big man Rob Little inside and on senior

point guard Julius Barnes and junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich out on the
perimeter. With Davis returning as an
effective member of the Cardinal's of
fensive unit, the rest should receive less
attention from opposing defenses.
"I think what Justin gives us is an
other guy to go to inside," Montgomery
said. "Ideally, if you're [playing] a good
team you're going to have to pick your
poison. Guard me here, I'm going to
hurt you there. Guard me there, I'm
going to hurt you here and that's what
makes good teams. If you have a weak
ness, good teams will find it and exploit
it."
Washington State played Stanford
evenly for the first 15 minutes of the
game as the Cardinal had six turnovers
in that stretch. After Cougar guard
Cedrick Hughey hit a pair of free
throws to tie the game at 23-23, Stan
ford went on a 12-4 run to close the half
up by eight points.
Washington State guard Jerry Mc-
Nair scored 14 of the Cougar' 27 first
half points. The 6-foot-2 senior was suc
cessful against a variety of Stanford de
fenders — consistently hitting tough
shots with a hand in his face as the Car
dinal opted to play Washington State
man-to-man for the majority of the
game.
McNair's first half-scoring prowess
could not be upheld for the entire
game, however. The Cardinal, which
managed nine second-half steals,
stepped it up on the defensive end,
holding the Cougars scoreless for the
opening six minutes of the half and
without a single field goal for the first
seven minutes, as Stanford went on an
11-4 run.
The run, which sparked the crowd
with two impressive dunks — the first,
a Davis slam off a Stanford miss and,
the second, a Sports Center-worthy
one-handed Childress dunk in transi
tion — put the Cardinal up by 19 and
the game out of reach, as Washington
State failed to mount a counterattack.
"[We had a] pretty good second
half," Montgomery said. "Sometimes
when you're not really threatened with
the guy beating you, you tend to gam

ble a little more. Guys were a little bit
quicker in terms of getting their hands
on some balls. But that's not going to
happen every game."
In the meantime, Montgomery
seems pretty satisfied with the position
his team is in right now.

"We've got 19 in the bank and 10 in the
league and we've got a lot of improving
that we can do — that's the good news,"
Montgomery said. "We needed that
[win]. Now it gets really tough for us —
down at the L.A.'s and then the Ari
zona's and Gal back here [at Maples]."
