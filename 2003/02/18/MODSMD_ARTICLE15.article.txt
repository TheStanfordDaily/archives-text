# Baseball goes four for four

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two straight weekends of ego-bruis
ing losses, No. 10 Stanford men's baseball got
just what it needed over the holiday weekend
with four straight victories to carry it into a
highly anticipated matchup at defending
champion No. 4 Texas beginning Friday.
The Cardinal (7-5), two games over .500
for the first time this season since its 2-0 start,
continued to ride strong pitching perfor
mances this weekend against Fresno State (1 -
6) and Nevada (4-6).
This time, however, Stanford added the
clutch hitting it had missed in both its previ
ous series to complete a holiday sweep.
With yesterday's win, head coach Mark
Marquess became the 21st coach in NCAA
history with 1,100 wins in his career.
Friday night against the Bulldogs, senior
ace John Hudgins continued to impress with
an outstanding performance on the hill in a
4-1 Cardinal win in which he carried a no-hit
ter into the eighth inning.
"I knew we really needed this win
tonight," Hudgins said. "That was my main
focus, but in the sixth and seventh inning I
started to get my eye on the prize. I thought

I was going to get it, but baseball is a funny
game."
Hudgins now has 28 strikeouts against
just three walks this season, a remarkable
ratio fora pitcher quietly emerging as next in
a recent line of dominant Stanford aces.
Most of Hudgins's work came during a 1 -
0 ball game, but Stanford broke it open a bit
with a pair of runs in the seventh. Freshman
John Mayberry Jr. sealed the win in the
eighth with a two-out home run to left.
Saturday, senior catcher Ryan Garko
blasted a two-run homer in the eighth to ef
fectively end a scare from Fresno State and
give Stanford a 5-2 victory.
Senior left-hander Tim Cunningham left
the game in the third inning after just 54
pitches, but junior David O'Hagan and two
freshmen carried the load the rest of the way,
shutting out the Bulldogs and preserving the
win.
Marquess was also pleased with freshmen
relievers Kodiak Quick and Mark Ro
manczuk. While Quick retired the only bat
ter he faced on strikes, Romanczuk contin
ued his early-season dominance with shutout
innings in the eighth and ninth to earn his

second save of the series.
After 1 1/3 innings of scoreless
relief yesterday against Nevada,
Romanczuk's numbers shine off
the stat sheet: 9 1/3 innings in five
appearances, a 2-0 record, two
saves, three hits, no runs and 12
strikeouts.
"Mark Romanczuk has shown
great poise early in his career,"
Marquess said yesterday.

Senior Ryan McCally continued
the strong Cardinal pitching
streak on Sunday with his first ca
reer complete game, carrying a
shutout into the ninth before sur
rendering two runs in a 7-2 Stan
ford win.
Yesterday against Nevada,
Marquess picked up his 1100 th
win in dramatic fashion after
sophomore Danny Putnam's two
out RBI single scored Mayberry to
break a 4-4 tie in the eighth inning.
"I was just trying not to do too
much," Putnam said. "Obviously it
feels good to come through in a big

spot like that."
The clutch hit held up when
Romanczuk finished the ninth and
gave the Cardinal the 5-4 win, its
fourth in a row.
"We've had a lot of great talent
at Stanford, and I've been very for
tunate," said Marquess of his mile
stone achievement. "It's nice but
there are more important things
right now."
There surely are. The Cardinal

national champions beginning Fri
