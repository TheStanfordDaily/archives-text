# Offense sparked by inside game

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
For much of the season, the No. 24 Stanford men's
basketball team has relied on its high-scoring back
court. On Saturday, senior point guard Julius Barnes
and junior shooting guard Matt Lottich combined for
4-of-19 shooting and didn't hit a single 3-pointer, but
the Cardinal was still able to cruise to a comfortable 72-
54 win over Washington State.
The Cardinal (19-6, 10-3 Pacific-10 Conference) did
this by outclassing the hard-working but hapless
Cougars (5-17, 0-13) with a dominant inside game.
Stanford's frontcourt players hit 21 of the team's 26
field goals and accounted for as many points as the en
tire Washington State roster.
"Obviously, our advantage was inside," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Julius and Matt weren't on
their game, but a lot of that was due to Washington
State's defense."
Junior forward Justin Davis was the game's domi
nant player, scoring 21 points, grabbing 10 boards, and
even going 7-of-9 from the free-throw line. Stanford,
following through on the goal made in practice last
week of restoring inside-outside balance to the offense,
made a consistent, concerted effort to get Davis the ball
in the low post.
"Especially when your shots aren't going down, it's a
luxury to have multiple weapons," Barnes said.
Sophomore swingman Josh Childress had another
solid game, posting 15 points and eight rebounds.
"Josh was consistent," Montgomery said. "Some
times you don't notice, but he shows up with 15 and 8."
Sophomore center Rob Little only played 10 min
utes due to foul trouble, contributing four points, but
Davis picked up the slack.
"Justin responded well," Montgomery said. "I think
Rob would have responded well if he could have stayed
in the game. I think he got a lot of tough calls."
The Cougars maximized on the foul calls their
perimeter-oriented offense was able to get, hitting all
18 of their free throws. Cardinal-killer shooting
guard Jerry McNair racked up 21 points and point
guard Thomas Kelati contributed 13. However,
missing all night for the Cougars was any semblance
of an inside game as their starting frontcourt tallied
a mere six points on l-of-13 shooting. Their reserve
big men did no better, shooting l-of-10 from the
floor.
"They just need some more size," Childress said.
