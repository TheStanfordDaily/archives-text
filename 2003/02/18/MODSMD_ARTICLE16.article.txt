# Offense sparked by inside game
## 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
For much of the season, the No. 24 Stanford men's
basketball team has relied on its high-scoring back
court. On Saturday, senior point guard Julius Barnes
and junior shooting guard Matt Lottich combined for
4-of-19 shooting and didn't hit a single 3-pointer, but
the Cardinal was still able to cruise to a comfortable 72-
54 win over Washington State.
The Cardinal (19-6, 10-3 Pacific-10 Conference) did
this by outclassing the hard-working but hapless
Cougars (5-17, 0-13) with a dominant inside game.
Stanford's frontcourt players hit 21 of the team's 26
field goals and accounted for as many points as the en
tire Washington State roster.
"Obviously, our advantage was inside," head coach
Mike Montgomery said. "Julius and Matt weren't on
their game, but a lot of that was due to Washington
State's defense."
Junior forward Justin Davis was the game's domi
nant player, scoring 21 points, grabbing 10 boards, and
even going 7-of-9 from the free-throw line. Stanford,
following through on the goal made in practice last
week of restoring inside-outside balance to the offense,
made a consistent, concerted effort to get Davis the ball
in the low post.
"Especially when your shots aren't going down, it's a
luxury to have multiple weapons," Barnes said.
Sophomore swingman Josh Childress had another
solid game, posting 15 points and eight rebounds.
"Josh was consistent," Montgomery said. "Some
times you don't notice, but he shows up with 15 and 8."
Sophomore center Rob Little only played 10 min
utes due to foul trouble, contributing four points, but
Davis picked up the slack.
"Justin responded well," Montgomery said. "I think
Rob would have responded well if he could have stayed
in the game. I think he got a lot of tough calls."
The Cougars maximized on the foul calls their
perimeter-oriented offense was able to get, hitting all
18 of their free throws. Cardinal-killer shooting
guard Jerry McNair racked up 21 points and point
guard Thomas Kelati contributed 13. However,
missing all night for the Cougars was any semblance
of an inside game as their starting frontcourt tallied
a mere six points on l-of-13 shooting. Their reserve
big men did no better, shooting l-of-10 from the
floor.
"They just need some more size," Childress said.
"It's just something that they're
lacking."
While the Cougars relied on
screens, motion and one-on-one
play to try to get jump shots for
their guards, Stanford had the
luxury of going to the post or cre
ating off the dribble. The Cougars
didn't knock down a field goal
until Kelati drained a long 3-
pointer 6:30 into the first half, and
Stanford had 13 second-half
points before Washington State
scored its first points of the half
with 14:12 remaining.
Even better for the Cardinal is
that, although the strong interior
play didn't aid the Cardinal guards
much on Saturday, it bodes well for
the future.
"That's going to make it a lot
easier for guys to drive," Childress
said.
Barnes added, "If we can estab
lish a post presence early in the
game, it will open things up for us

on the outside."
While Stanford is clawing for
position atop the conference,
Washington State is still gunning
for its first Pac-10 victory.
"I've got to commend [Cougar
head coach] Paul Graham," Mont
gomery said. "Those kids have re
ally hung together in a lot of situa
tions where you lose your players,
and they don,t stay together."
The easy win against a Washing
ton State team that took Stanford to
overtime when the squads met in
Pullman in January, gave the Cardi
nal a chance to reflect on the differ
ences between a losing team and a
winning team in a conference that is
talented from top to bottom.
"I think that they play really
hard, but winning is ultimately an
attitude," Childress said, pointing
to how the Cougars had hung with
both Arizona schools last weekend
before falling apart late. "You have
to think you can win, know that
you can win."
