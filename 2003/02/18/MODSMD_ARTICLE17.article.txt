### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Thursday night the Cardinal
left Seattle pretty disappointed.
Falling prey to the sharp-shooting
Huskies in its worst conference loss in
12 years, the Stanford women's basket
ball team knew that they had some
things to work on.

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 6 Stanford 84, Washington
St. 41
vs. USC, Thursday, 7 p.m.

What a difference a day of practice
makes. The Cardinal returned to the
court Saturday, drowning Washing
ton State 84-41 in Pullman.
A glance through the statistics be
gins to give an indication of the bal
anced offense and team defense exe
cuted by the Cardinal. Watching just a
few minutes of Saturday's game makes
anyone question how Stanford suf
fered a 24-point loss just two days ear
lier.
"They have an inside and outside
attack," said Washington State head
coach Sherri Murrell. "When you try
to take away the inside they hit you
from the outside. They just got too

many players. They are a good team
and deserved rightly so to win this
game."
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was glad to see her team re
sponded to the challenges placed be
fore them.
"We came off of a very disappoint
ing loss at Washington." said
VanDerveer. "We knew we were going
to have to play well. It was very excit
ing. I was glad to see the team effort
that we did."
The 3-point arc that all but de
stroyed the Cardinal on Thursday
night was a little bit more friendly to its
shooters Saturday afternoon. The
Stanford women hit their first six shots
from downtown, igniting a scoring run
that put them ahead 32-11 with just
under 10 minutes to play in the first
half.
"You don't get ranked No. 6 with
out good shooters," Murrell said.
"They didn't play well at University of
Washington. We knew they were
going to come out strong. Tara [Van-
Derveer] gets her team's ready."
In the run sophomore Sebnem
Kimyacioglu lit it up from outside, hit
ting three 3-pointers and a two-point
field goal with her foot just over the line.
Kimyacioglu finished the half and the

game, with a 6-for-6 shooting perfor
mance, including 4-for-4 from beyond
the 3-point line, good fora game-high
16 points. In addition the guard added
three rebounds and a pair of assists.
"They were leaving me open, and
they had a small girl on me so it was
easy to look over her," said Kimya
cioglu. "I think as a team we were more
aggressive. It is a credit to our team for
pressuring, dishing, screening, finding
open people."
While Kimyacioglu led the way, she
was far from the only show
in town. Sophomore Kelley Suminski
hit a pair of 3-pointers on the
initial surge, ending the day with 12
points in just 19 minutes.
Freshman Krista Rappahahn tal
lied a career high, scoring 11 points,
including a perfect 4-for-4 from the
free throw line
"We worked basically all day yester
day on our defense," VanDerveer said.
"Maybe they felt they had to buck
those shots down because they didn't
get a chance to do it yesterday."
While the shooters definitely domi
nated the highlight reel, it was the Car
dinal defense that allowed for the of
fensive success.
Stanford limited the Cougars
leading scorer, Bianca McCall to
just three points in Saturday's con
test, as Washington State shot just
over 24 percent from the field as a
team. In addition, the Cardinal
quick hands knocked away 13
steals in the contest.
But one of the greatest high
lights of Saturday's game, was the
opportunity to stray from the cus
tomary seven-player rotation and

give each of the 12 players on the
Cardinal roster a chance to step up
in a game situation.
Junior forward Katie Denny
came off the bench to tally a
game-high eight rebounds, while
freshman Clare Bodensteiner
slashed through the lane tallying
eight points in front of a host of
fans from her hometown of Ru
pert, Idaho.
The Cardinal returns to action
this week at Maples Pavilion for
tough games against UCLA and
Southern California, before
rounding out the regular season
with a road trip to Arizona.
