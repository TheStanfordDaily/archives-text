## 
### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a weekend of firsts for the Stan
ford softball program and the team's
young 2003 season.
This weekend the No. 14 Cardinal
softball team (10-2) hosted a tourna
ment on the Farm for the first time in
the history of the program and won its
first tournament title of the season.
After waiting this long to host a tour
ney, the team did not waste any time to
begin its onslaught when it squared off
Friday afternoon against Penn State (1-
4).

Freshman shortstop Lauren
began the charge immediately in the
Cardinal's first at bat with a lead off sin
gle, but Stanford would not be able to
make it count and Lappin was left on
base.
Penn State threatened to score first its
next time up when it got on base with
back-to-back singles, but Stanford
hurler senior Tori Nyberg shut the Nit
tany Lions down before any damage was
done.
The Cardinal would not be held off
any longer as it posted its first run of the
game in the second inning when senior
first baseman Maureen LeCocq drove in

freshman center fielder Catalina Morris
on a double to right.
Nyberg would then send three Nit
tany Lions back to the dugout striking
out the side — two swinging and one
looking.
Stanford would strike again in the
third, tacking on another run when
Penn State walked senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham with the bases loaded.
Then in the bottom of the fourth the
Cardinal bats would get hot as the of
fense exploded, scoring four runs off of
five hits, highlighted by back-to-back
RBI doubles by senior second
baseman Kira Ching and junior
catcher Jessica Allister.
Both pitchers would continue
to shut down the opposite side for
the final three innings of the game,
ending the game with a 6-0 Cardi
nal victory.
Stanford's lineup would then
carry its rally into the second game
of the day against the Kentucky
Wildcats.
Stanford came out and scored
two runs in the top of the first
against Kentucky after Lappin
started the game the same way she
had the first. But, this time the
Cardinal would not wait to post its
first run as Ching would double to
drive in Lappin before scoring
herself off of Allister's sacrifice fly
to right field.
Stanford added three more
runs in the second, led by Allister's
two-RBI double to left center scor
ing junior Michelle Thiry and
sophomore right fielder Meghan
Sickler.
The Wildcats would not have
more luck in the third inning when
the Cardinal widened the gap to
the game's final score of 8-0.
LeCocq got the start and
pitched two innings, getting her
first win of the season before fresh
man Laura Severson stepped in to
close out the shutout, striking out
three and giving up just one hit.
Sickler and Thiry led Stanford of
fensively, going a perfect 2-for-2 at
the plate. Lappin added two more
hits, finishing 4-for-7 on the day.
Stanford returned to the field
for its last game of pool play Satur
day afternoon against Missouri.
Nyberg led the 5-2 victory over
the Tigers and posted her sixth

victory of the season to add to her
untarnished record.
Lappin served as the trigger
again when she set off the 112 irst Car
dinal rally by singling to left and
driving in Morris and Sickler to
push Stanford ahead 2-0. The Car
dinal continued to recreate past
success at the plate as Ching and
Allister combined again to add a
run to the Stanford lead. Allister
singled to center and drove in
Ching who singled and stole sec
ond to put herself in scoring posi
tion.
Missouri, the only team to post

a run against the Cardinal in pool
play, rallied back, scoring two runs
in the top of the fourth. But, it
would not change anything as the
Cardinal answered back by ex
tending its lead off of a double by
Bendig down the left field line to
score Morris and Sickler.
Nyberg shut down the Tigers
for the remainder of the game and
the Cardinal took the win 5-2 with
Lappin finishing at the plate hav
ing gone a perfect 3-3.
The Stanford squad would not
get much rest before returning to
the field to take on Penn State for

the second time in the weekend —
but this time behind two-time Ail-
American junior Dana Sorensen in
the circle starting her first game
since Feb. 2, 2002.
Sorensen did not miss a beat in
her first start of the season as she
notched eight strikeouts and al
lowed just three hits in seven in
nings of work.
The Cardinal offense was not as
successful this time around, doing
just enough to claim the 2-1 victo
ry and place itself in the champi
onship game.
In the title game, Stanford took
on Kentucky once again and
proved its dominance by beating
the Wildcats for the second time in
the weekend. Nyberg and
Sorensen both graced the rubber
to help the Cardinal take the
championship by striking out 13
and claiming the win.
In this win, Stanford had a new
leader at the plate in Thiry. Stan
ford got the offense going in the
bottom of the second when
LeCocq led off with a base hit to left
field. Then Thiry stepped into the
box and drove a clutch double to
center, scoring Shook and Morris
for the Cardinal's first two runs of
the game.
The rally was not over as Lap
pin followed with a deep single to
score Thiry fora 3-0 Stanford lead.
In the bottom of the fourth
Thiry would strike again when she
sent a solo home run over the
fence to put Stanford up 4-0.
Kentucky would attempt a come
back in the fifth when the Wildcats
put together three consecutive in
field singles, but Sorensen would
successfully end the attack, only al
lowing a single run.
Both sides would remain silent
for the remainder of the game,
and the Cardinal finished on top
for the fifth time in the weekend
with a 4-1 victory.

ting wins against Penn State on Friday, Missouri on Saturday and Kentucky
in the finals of the tournament on Sunday.
It was a weekend of firsts for the Stan
ford softball program and the team's
young 2003 season.
This weekend the No. 14 Cardinal
softball team (10-2) hosted a tourna
ment on the Farm for the first time in
the history of the program and won its
first tournament title of the season.
After waiting this long to host a tour
ney, the team did not waste any time to
begin its onslaught when it squared off
Friday afternoon against Penn State (1-
4).

Freshman shortstop Lauren
began the charge immediately in the
Cardinal's first at bat with a lead off sin
gle, but Stanford would not be able to
make it count and Lappin was left on
base.
Penn State threatened to score first its
next time up when it got on base with
back-to-back singles, but Stanford
hurler senior Tori Nyberg shut the Nit
tany Lions down before any damage was
done.
The Cardinal would not be held off
any longer as it posted its first run of the
game in the second inning when senior
first baseman Maureen LeCocq drove in

freshman center fielder Catalina Morris
on a double to right.
Nyberg would then send three Nit
tany Lions back to the dugout striking
out the side — two swinging and one
looking.
Stanford would strike again in the
third, tacking on another run when
Penn State walked senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham with the bases loaded.
Then in the bottom of the fourth the
Cardinal bats would get hot as the of
fense exploded, scoring four runs off of
five hits, highlighted by back-to-back
RBI doubles by senior second
baseman Kira Ching and junior
catcher Jessica Allister.
Both pitchers would continue
to shut down the opposite side for
the final three innings of the game,
ending the game with a 6-0 Cardi
nal victory.
Stanford's lineup would then
carry its rally into the second game
of the day against the Kentucky
Wildcats.
Stanford came out and scored
two runs in the top of the first
against Kentucky after Lappin
started the game the same way she
had the first. But, this time the
Cardinal would not wait to post its
first run as Ching would double to
drive in Lappin before scoring
herself off of Allister's sacrifice fly
to right field.
Stanford added three more
runs in the second, led by Allister's
two-RBI double to left center scor
ing junior Michelle Thiry and
sophomore right fielder Meghan
Sickler.
The Wildcats would not have
more luck in the third inning when
the Cardinal widened the gap to
the game's final score of 8-0.
LeCocq got the start and
pitched two innings, getting her
first win of the season before fresh
man Laura Severson stepped in to
close out the shutout, striking out
three and giving up just one hit.
Sickler and Thiry led Stanford of
fensively, going a perfect 2-for-2 at
the plate. Lappin added two more
hits, finishing 4-for-7 on the day.
Stanford returned to the field
for its last game of pool play Satur
day afternoon against Missouri.
Nyberg led the 5-2 victory over
the Tigers and posted her sixth

victory of the season to add to her
untarnished record.
Lappin served as the trigger
again when she set off the 112 irst Car
dinal rally by singling to left and
driving in Morris and Sickler to
push Stanford ahead 2-0. The Car
dinal continued to recreate past
success at the plate as Ching and
Allister combined again to add a
run to the Stanford lead. Allister
singled to center and drove in
Ching who singled and stole sec
ond to put herself in scoring posi
tion.
Missouri, the only team to post

a run against the Cardinal in pool
play, rallied back, scoring two runs
in the top of the fourth. But, it
would not change anything as the
Cardinal answered back by ex
tending its lead off of a double by
Bendig down the left field line to
score Morris and Sickler.
Nyberg shut down the Tigers
for the remainder of the game and
the Cardinal took the win 5-2 with
Lappin finishing at the plate hav
ing gone a perfect 3-3.
The Stanford squad would not
get much rest before returning to
the field to take on Penn State for

the second time in the weekend —
but this time behind two-time Ail-
American junior Dana Sorensen in
the circle starting her first game
since Feb. 2, 2002.
Sorensen did not miss a beat in
her first start of the season as she
notched eight strikeouts and al
lowed just three hits in seven in
nings of work.
The Cardinal offense was not as
successful this time around, doing
just enough to claim the 2-1 victo
ry and place itself in the champi
onship game.
In the title game, Stanford took
on Kentucky once again and
proved its dominance by beating
the Wildcats for the second time in
the weekend. Nyberg and
Sorensen both graced the rubber
to help the Cardinal take the
championship by striking out 13
and claiming the win.
In this win, Stanford had a new
leader at the plate in Thiry. Stan
ford got the offense going in the
bottom of the second when
LeCocq led off with a base hit to left
field. Then Thiry stepped into the
box and drove a clutch double to
center, scoring Shook and Morris
for the Cardinal's first two runs of
the game.
The rally was not over as Lap
pin followed with a deep single to
score Thiry fora 3-0 Stanford lead.
In the bottom of the fourth
Thiry would strike again when she
sent a solo home run over the
fence to put Stanford up 4-0.
Kentucky would attempt a come
back in the fifth when the Wildcats
put together three consecutive in
field singles, but Sorensen would
successfully end the attack, only al
lowing a single run.
Both sides would remain silent
for the remainder of the game,
and the Cardinal finished on top
for the fifth time in the weekend
with a 4-1 victory.
