### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a weekend of firsts for the Stan
ford softball program and the team's
young 2003 season.
This weekend the No. 14 Cardinal
softball team (10-2) hosted a tourna
ment on the Farm for the first time in
the history of the program and won its
first tournament title of the season.
After waiting this long to host a tour
ney, the team did not waste any time to
begin its onslaught when it squared off
Friday afternoon against Penn State (1-
4).

Freshman shortstop Lauren
began the charge immediately in the
Cardinal's first at bat with a lead off sin
gle, but Stanford would not be able to
make it count and Lappin was left on
base.
Penn State threatened to score first its
next time up when it got on base with
back-to-back singles, but Stanford
hurler senior Tori Nyberg shut the Nit
tany Lions down before any damage was
done.
The Cardinal would not be held off
any longer as it posted its first run of the
game in the second inning when senior
first baseman Maureen LeCocq drove in

freshman center fielder Catalina Morris
on a double to right.
Nyberg would then send three Nit
tany Lions back to the dugout striking
out the side â€” two swinging and one
looking.
Stanford would strike again in the
third, tacking on another run when
Penn State walked senior left fielder
Cassi Brangham with the bases loaded.
Then in the bottom of the fourth the
Cardinal bats would get hot as the of
fense exploded, scoring four runs off of
five hits, highlighted by back-to-back
