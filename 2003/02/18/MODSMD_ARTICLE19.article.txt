# Card knocks Cal out of the pool
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The California Bears may have
been able to best Stanford in foot
ball, but in women's swimming
and diving, No. 7 Cal didn't have
the depth to come out on top of the
No. 8 Cardinal.

Stanford divers took first, sec
ond and third in both the 1-meter
and 3-meter events, which turned
out to be the most critical factor in
the 154-146 win over Cal.
Sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal
recorded a score of 278.55 in 1-
meter and a score of 313.35 in the
3-meter to claim tremendous wins
in both of the events.
In the 1-meter, freshman Katie
Berglund scored 260.625 points to
clinch the second-place spot, and
senior McKenze Murphy racked
up 257.325 points for third.
Murphy also finished second
behind Rosenthal in the 3-meter
competition with a score 0f293.42.

Sophomore Lauren Donovan
rounded out the Cardinal diving
sweep with her third-place score of
281.925.
"[The meet] was a total team ef
fort," coach Richard Quick said.
"But the biggest factor was the div
ing team."
The Stanford swimmers com
bined to win seven of their 14
races, including a huge win in the
400-yard freestyle relay. Fresh
man Dana Kirk and sophomores
Lacey Boutwell, Tami Ransom,
and Sarah Jones teamed up to win
the event with a time of 3 minutes,
22.52 seconds. Ransom swam an
outstanding starting leg of the
race, in which the team ended with
a time more than 3 seconds faster
than their season-best.
Kirk also recorded an individ
ual win for the Cardinal in the
freestyle, even though the butter
fly is her specialty stroke.
"We figured we couldn't beat
[Cal American record holder] Na
talie Coughlin in the butterfly
events." Quick said.
The coaching staff then made a
last-minute strategy decision and
pulled Kirk from the 100 fly, plac-

ing her in the 500 freestyle. She
came through for the team and
won with a time of 4:56.01. Kirk
also turned up two key second
place finishes in the 200 free and
200 fly.
Dana Kirk's sister, junior Tara
Kirk, added to her winning streaks
in both breaststroke events. She
has yet to lose in the 200 breast this
season and is undefeated in the 24
times she has raced in the 100 in
the NCAA.
Freestyle specialist Boutwell
also added two individual wins to
the team score. She recorded times
of 23.45 and 50.35 to claim victory
in the 50 and 100 freestyle events,
respectively.
Freshman Kristen Caverly won
the 200 individual medley with a
time of 2:00.87, which at that point
in the meet, gave the Card the lead
in the team score. She also took
second in the 200 back.
Cal swimmers put in many no
table performances including Ju
nior Coughlin, who swept both of
the butterfly events, as expected,
and won the 200 free. Freshman
Helen Silver garnered wins in both
backstroke events.
