## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Sunday in San Francisco,
around 200,000 people carrying anti
war banners and placards filled the
streets, adding their numbers to the
hundreds of thousands marching in
cities across the globe in what has been
described as the largest preemptive
anti-war action in history.
Protesters and organizers hoped that
the rally would prove to policy makers in
Washington that the majority of the
American public opposes war in Iraq.
According to Todd Chretien, a
member of the San Francisco State Uni
versity Students Against War, 20,000
students from campuses around the
Bay Area were in attendance.
"The point is not just to march, but
to build links between schools, share
organizing ideas and take the experi
ence back to our campuses to make the
majority anti-war sentiment even
more obvious and powerful," Chre
tien said.

Freshman David Kilner, a member
of Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice, hoped that the rally would
"show people overseas that there are
plenty of Americans who are firmly
against war and that our government
does not speak for us."
Stanford groups represented, or af
filiated with anti-war organizing, in
cluded the Society for Environmental
Action at Stanford, Young Communist
League, Resistance Art and Social
Protest, MEChA and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition. A bus left cam
pus at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning,
though many students found their
own means of transportation and met
up with campus organizers in the city.
No special effort was made to wear
Stanford clothing. However, accord
ing to Andres Bayani, a member of
SCPJ, many students did attend wear
ing Stanford paraphernalia to "let
everyone know that there are Stanford
students opposed to the war and orga
nizing to prevent it."
The march began at 11 a.m. at

Justin Herman Plaza and from there
moved up Market Street to the Civic
Center where the actual rally was set
to begin at 2 p.m. A wide variety of
people and age groups were repre
sented: parents with young children,
aging hippies, clean-cut college stu
dents, veterans, grandparents and
many others.
Signs and fliers included state
ments like "Stop the war in Iraq,"
"No war for oil," "Bombs make or
phans and terrorists," "Blessed are
the peace-makers," "Latinos contra
la Guerra" and "Mission of peace."
Though energetic and very vocal,
with drum beats and yells filling the air,
protesters remained peaceful. Some vi
olence and vandalism did break out in
the late afternoon, but overall, accord
ing to Kilner, the rally was "all very
peaceful and very inspiring."
A wide variety of individuals spoke
at the rally itself. Political figures in
cluded individuals such as Congress
woman Barbara Lee (D-Ca.) and San
Francisco mayoral candidate Tom

Amiano. Lee stated that she was intro
ducing a resolution against force in
Iraq and to repeal the USA Patriot Act.
"We stand for peace," Lee said.
"We don't want our money squan
dered. We want schools [and] hous
ing for veterans."
Soon after, David Harris, a nation
ally renowned activist and 1966-1967
Stanford student body president who
was imprisoned for refusing to serve
in the Vietnam War, said, "The cur
rent policy spreads terror rather than
stopping it." Me added, "Occupation
is like painting a bulls-eye on our na
tion's chest."
People from all over the world were
represented at the rally, and many
participants beyond the current Stan
ford students who were at the rally had
ties to the Farm.
Former Stanford student Pradeep
Nararaj was pleased to see that so many
people had turned out, though he said
he didn't really think die rally would af-

still Bush says yes," he said.
Tom and Margaret Burton,
residents of Marin, Calif., were
pleased at the number and variety
of protesters, but were having dif
ficulties finding their grandson,
current Stanford junior Chris An
drews. The Burtons were "proud
to be constituents of Barbara
Lee," the one member of Con
gress who voted against the Patri
ot Act and authorizing President
George W. Bush to take unilater
al action.
"Going without the U.N. is
counter to all reason," Tom Burton
said. "We are dependent on them.
A preemptive strike is both arro
gant and ignorant."
Stanford history Prof. Joel
Beinin, who attended the rally, felt
that "The majority of campus opin
ion is surely against a war unsanc

tioned by the UN."
Not everyone on the streets was
against the war, however. One
young man came dressed in a gas
mask and army camouflage in sup
port of military intervention. Pro
war activities are being planned by
groups such as the Stanford Col
lege Republicans who are, accord
ing to sophomore Joe Fairbanks,
the current president of the group,
"continuing pro-war activities
through educating the campus
about the facts of the situation
rather than the one-sided rhetoric
you hear at rallies."
Fairbanks commented, "Anti
war rallies only draw those who are
already die-hard pacifist, pro-Sad
dam or anti-American or anti-Is
raeli. With their meaningless
spreading of propaganda and un
justified rhetoric, these anti- war
rallies serve little purpose ... Some
of the protesters have good points
to make, but they are being over
shadowed by extremists who want
nothing more than to their spread
an anti-American message."

Tom and Margaret Burton,
residents of Marin, Calif., were
pleased at the number and variety
of protesters, but were having dif

"Going without the U.N. is
counter to all reason," Tom Burton
said. "We are dependent on them.
A preemptive strike is both arro

Stanford history Prof. Joel
Beinin, who attended the rally, felt
that "The majority of campus opin

Not everyone on the streets was
against the war, however. One

war activities are being planned by
groups such as the Stanford Col

ing to sophomore Joe Fairbanks,
the current president of the group,
"continuing pro-war activities
through educating the campus
about the facts of the situation
rather than the one-sided rhetoric
you hear at rallies."
Fairbanks commented, "Anti
war rallies only draw those who are
already die-hard pacifist, pro-Sad
dam or anti-American or anti-Is
raeli. With their meaningless
spreading of propaganda and un
justified rhetoric, these anti- war
rallies serve little purpose ... Some
of the protesters have good points
to make, but they are being over
shadowed by extremists who want
nothing more than to their spread
an anti-American message."
This Sunday in San Francisco,
around 200,000 people carrying anti
war banners and placards filled the
streets, adding their numbers to the
hundreds of thousands marching in
cities across the globe in what has been
described as the largest preemptive
anti-war action in history.
Protesters and organizers hoped that
the rally would prove to policy makers in
Washington that the majority of the
American public opposes war in Iraq.
According to Todd Chretien, a
member of the San Francisco State Uni
versity Students Against War, 20,000
students from campuses around the
Bay Area were in attendance.
"The point is not just to march, but
to build links between schools, share
organizing ideas and take the experi
ence back to our campuses to make the
majority anti-war sentiment even
more obvious and powerful," Chre
tien said.

Freshman David Kilner, a member
of Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice, hoped that the rally would
"show people overseas that there are
plenty of Americans who are firmly
against war and that our government
does not speak for us."
Stanford groups represented, or af
filiated with anti-war organizing, in
cluded the Society for Environmental
Action at Stanford, Young Communist
League, Resistance Art and Social
Protest, MEChA and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition. A bus left cam
pus at 9 a.m. on Sunday morning,
though many students found their
own means of transportation and met
up with campus organizers in the city.
No special effort was made to wear
Stanford clothing. However, accord
ing to Andres Bayani, a member of
SCPJ, many students did attend wear
ing Stanford paraphernalia to "let
everyone know that there are Stanford
students opposed to the war and orga
nizing to prevent it."
The march began at 11 a.m. at

Justin Herman Plaza and from there
moved up Market Street to the Civic
Center where the actual rally was set
to begin at 2 p.m. A wide variety of
people and age groups were repre
sented: parents with young children,
aging hippies, clean-cut college stu
dents, veterans, grandparents and
many others.
Signs and fliers included state
ments like "Stop the war in Iraq,"
"No war for oil," "Bombs make or
phans and terrorists," "Blessed are
the peace-makers," "Latinos contra
la Guerra" and "Mission of peace."
Though energetic and very vocal,
with drum beats and yells filling the air,
protesters remained peaceful. Some vi
olence and vandalism did break out in
the late afternoon, but overall, accord
ing to Kilner, the rally was "all very
peaceful and very inspiring."
A wide variety of individuals spoke
at the rally itself. Political figures in
cluded individuals such as Congress
woman Barbara Lee (D-Ca.) and San
Francisco mayoral candidate Tom

Amiano. Lee stated that she was intro
ducing a resolution against force in
Iraq and to repeal the USA Patriot Act.
"We stand for peace," Lee said.
"We don't want our money squan
dered. We want schools [and] hous
ing for veterans."
