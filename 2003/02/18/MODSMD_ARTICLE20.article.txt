Seattle was unkind to Stanford women's athletics
this weekend.
The night after the Huskies shocked the Cardi
nal women's basketball team, the No. 14 Washing
ton women's gymnastics team (6-3, 2-2 Pacific-10
Conference) edged No. 8 Stanford (7-2-1, 3-1-1)
196.775 to 196.750, ending Stanford's undefeated
streak in conference meets.

vs. Arizona St., Friday, 7:30 p.m.

But, try as they might, the Huskies could not
mush Stanford's optimism.
"Even though we didn't win the meet, I think we
proved to ourselves that we can compete well on
the road," junior Lindsay Wing said. "We hit 23 for
24 routines and had a great meet on floor, which is
something that we've really been working on."
The Cardinal's night began on the uneven bars,
where Wing took fourth with a season-high 9.900.
Freshman Glyn Sweets and junior Caroline
Fluhrer were on Wing's heels, both scoring a 9.875
and tying for fifth as Stanford notched its second
highest team score on the bars for the season.
The vaulting table saw junior Kendall Beck
score a 9.875, good for third place, and freshman
Natalie Foley and junior Lise Leveille tied for
eighth with scores of 9.8.
"I thought we started off just a little slow on bars
and vault, but floor and beam were probably the
best I've seen this team do," coach Kristen Smyth
said. "We've been struggling on those two events
and needed to prove to ourselves that beam and
floor are just as strong as our other events. "
Heading into the last two rotations behind by
0.725, the Cardinal would not be snowed by the
Huskies. "As the pressure mounted, so did our en
ergy and momentum," Smyth said.
Leveille and junior Shelly Goldberg paced the
Cardinal's efforts on floor, tying for third with
scores of 9.875 as Stanford began to close the gap.
Fluhrer followed up her strong execution on bars
with a 9.85 on floor to take fifth place.
After tabbing season-high team scores on the
first two events, Washington was alarmed in the
face of the Cardinal threat. As Stanford went
through its show-stopping floor lineup, the

Huskies' nerves led to two falls on the balance
beam, giving the Cardinal a chance heading into
the final rotation.
"Our beam team was truly phenomenal," Smyth
said. "Glyn had a beautiful performance and Lise
stuck her double-pike dismount oil beam. It's the
toughest dismount off beam and she is the only one
in the country to execute it now."
Washington led by one-tenth of a point as Stan
ford's beam lineup began performing. The Cardi
nal showed its resiliency as Wing won the event with
a 9.95 and Leveille placed second, just 0.025 behind
her teammate.
Leveille's efforts landed her fourth-place in the
all-around competition with a 39.350 â€” her sec
ond-best all-around score of the season.
Now halfway through its season, the Cardinal
stands at the top of the Pac-10 conference and con
tinues to add depth to its lineups while its rivals find
their rosters riddled with injuries.
"We're at a really good position given the time of
year," Smyth said. "We need to land and execute bet
ter. But we're continuing to build and the girls are
healthy and increasing difficulty on their routines."
