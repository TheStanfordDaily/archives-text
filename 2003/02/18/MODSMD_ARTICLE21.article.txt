# AIDS funding doesn't reach far enough

Eight thousand people die every day from AIDS.
More than 40 million people worldwide are infected
with HIV, and whole societies will suffer and crumble
unless prevention is combined with treatment. Unfortu
nately, access to effective HIV/AIDS medicines is re
stricted by income. In his State of the Union address last

month, President Bush resolved to
commit $15 billion over five years to
combat international AIDS. While this
is a promising step in the right direc
tion, it doesn't reach nearly far enough.
What has this to do with civic en
gagement? Everything. Chances are
we would have heard no such an
nouncement on Jan. 28 had thou
sands of activists across the nation not
been crying out about the United

States' meager response to the pandemic. This was
Bush's attempt to pacify' his outspoken opposition,
who refuse to be silent. We are far from done — 38.8
percent of the adult population of Botswana is infect
ed. On April 12, Stanford will be making its voice
heard through participation in the Student Global
AIDS Walk: A Call to Action — students across 10
cities will unite and walk to advocate and raise funds
for international AIDS treatment. Join us, we will
make our voices heard.
