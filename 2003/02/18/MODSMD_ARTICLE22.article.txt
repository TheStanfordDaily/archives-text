# 'Sustainable change can only come from the bottom up'
## 
### 
My social activism is rooted in the message of love
found in the Christian gospels. This philosophy moti-

vates my present work with Street
Forum, Night Outreach and the
quickly growing anti-war efforts. My
privileged status as a University-edu
cated woman demands that I give
myself in service to my community
here in the United States and in all
the world, now and after graduation.
Latin American liberation theolo
gians have called us to adopt a pref-

erential option for the poor, which prioritizes the
needs of society's most marginalized and excluded.
Huge inequality governs our world; we must make a
change and listen to those who suffer the most, for
real, sustainable change can only come from the bot
tom up.
In the quest for social justice, anger and self-right
eousness will not sustain us. We can only work fora
better world if we adopt a spirit of humility and love
for one another.
