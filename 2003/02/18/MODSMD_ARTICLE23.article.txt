# 'Democracy is built on participation
## 
### 
We are tremendously lucky to live in the United
States of America today. We have freedoms, rights
and privileges that people in many other countries

can only dream about. Since 1776,
thousands of Americans have sacri
ficed their lives to secure these free
doms for us. Through civic engage
ment, we students can guarantee that
these liberties live on. We can also
honor the memories of those who
died by working to make America
even better. Democracy, after all, is
built on participation. Even if you are

not an elected officeholder, you can still have a signif
icant impact in resolving today's important issues.
No particular topic is most important; pick the one
that you have the greatest interest in. There is a
tremendously wide range, from the war against ter
rorism to tax policy to environmental conservation.
Anyway, your advocacy will be most effective if the
topic is one that you truly care about. Your educated
view will certainly add something constructive to the
dialogue.
