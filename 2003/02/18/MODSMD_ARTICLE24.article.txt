# 'A complete overhaul of the government'
## 
### 
Our civic engagement and political activism must be
taken outside of the boundaries set by the government,
for within those boundaries you have no voice. You
cannot simply oppose the administration's stance and
expect the government to listen to the people it "rep
resents." As in the '60s, individuals had to perform
outside of the scope of what was allowed and risk legal
ramifications for their voices to be heard. Today, now
that some of those means have been made legal, they
tend to be less potent and we need to return to those
strategies. In short, the re-initiation of nonviolent, pas
sive, but most importantly, disruptive behaviors, such
as strikes, sit-ins, critical-mass activities. Unfortunately,
in our "democracy," the voice of the people is only
heard when the wheels of our self-serving government
are adversely affected and negatively impacted.
However, in the long run, continually adapting is
only a topical ointment to suppress symptoms, not treat
the disease. What is truly needed is a long overdue Con
stitutional Convention adapting our government and
Constitution to the 21 st century. That, along with a com
plete overhaul of the government — doing away with
lifetime politicians, political families and the such. Only
then, will the people once again truly play a part in our
government's domestic policies and foreign relations.
