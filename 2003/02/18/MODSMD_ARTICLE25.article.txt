# Civic week on campus
## Week to include panels, talks and a tour of East Palo Alto 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
This is the first of a monthly series of special
projects, each devoted to examining in
depth a specific issue of importance to the
Stanford community. If you have any
ideas or suggestions for future special pro
jects, please e-mail Projects Editor Anthony
Ha at acha@stanford.edu.

From panels featuring University
administrators and faculty to student
led tours through East Palo Alto, the
events of National Civic Engagement
Week are aimed at encouraging Sum
ford students to become more active in
the community.
"[Hopefully,] we will get all these stu
dents pumped up about it and highlight
the good work that students do," said ju
nior Stephen Chan, the event's facilita
tor. "Maybe we will make students more
civically engaged, and we can better un
derstand across all of our institutions of
higher learning how it is that we can ed
ucate students."
Chan, a Haas public service fellow,
said the week's activities are part of the
"Raise Your Voice: A Week of Action"

countrywide campaign by Campus
Compact.
According to its Web site, Campus
Compact is a "national coalition of more
than 860 college and university presi
dents committed to the civic purposes of
higher education" and works to pro
mote community service that develops
"citizenship skills and values."
"[Campus Compact] brought 10 stu
dents together [over the summer] to see
what this campaign could look like," he
said. "We started developing a frame
work fora way that this campaign could
look. Part of what they envisioned was
that they would launch the campaign
this week â€” there are at least 200 other
campuses doing this."
Chan said that last quarter he invited
about 80 on-campus groups to attend a
meeting about being involved with the
planning of National Civic Engagement
Week. In the end, eight groups decided
to participate.
"We have taken up the cause of Na
tional Civic Engagement Week at Stan
ford because we believe that it directly

pertains to our committee's goals," said
sophomore Bonnie Johnson, director
of Stanford In Government's Campus
Awareness Committee.
Chan said he has been planning with
other student groups since the begin
ning of the year.
Dean of Students Marc Wais ex
plained that his office provided funding
for the week's events on the behalf of the
president, provost and vice provost for
student affairs.
"I believe this initiative supports the
University's efforts in preparing both
leaders and citizens of the world who we
expect will influence all aspects of
human endeavor," Wais said.
Nadinne Cruz, director of the Haas
Center for Public Service, will moderate
a forum today at noon in the Oak West
Lounge of Tresidder Union featuring
Hennessy and former ASSU President
Matt Brewer, a senior, who will explore
the civic responsibility of the University.
"Not knowing what a Stanford or
ASSU president can or cannot do by sim
ple exercise of his or her authority means
that expectations can bring disappoint
ment," Cruz said. "There can also some
times be simple miscommunications be
tween the president and those who want

him or her to act on a particular issue.
'I"he dialogue ... hopefully [will] clarify
some of those issues."
Henestroza, a senior, explained that
ASSU members helped coordinate the
forum.
"The ASSU recognizes the impor
tance of civic engagement," she said.
[The ASSU] itself wouldn't be as effective
in advocating for students were it not for
those students who choose to get in
volved as committee representatives,
graduate student council members, ex
ecutive aides, etc."
Later this evening there will be a
panel exploring whether students are
politically apathetic and why young
people should care about politics.
History Prof. A1 Camarillo, a panelist
at the discussion, said he will address
why it is important for students to be
civically engaged early in their lives.
"This event will afford an opportu
nity for faculty and students to discuss
some issues fundamental to the
preservation of democracy in the 21st
century and to the welfare of our local
communities," he said. "We often
don't talk enough about what it means
to be a citizen participant in American
society."
