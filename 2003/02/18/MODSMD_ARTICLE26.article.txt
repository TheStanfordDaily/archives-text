# At Stanford, engagement transcends service
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Demonstrations against war with
Iraq, rallies against SUVs and speech
es praising Roe vs. Wade are all forms
of civic engagement — but so are
Camp Kesem, Night Outreach and
Ravenswood Reads. Examining the
ways Stanford students arecivically en
gaged demonstrates that "engage
ment" can extend beyond community
service and also pertains to viewing
conduct in business, or even daily life,
from a socially responsible perspective
Amelia DeLaPaz, a sophomore,
came across East Palo Alto Tennis and
Tutoring by accident. She saw younger
children following Stanford students
to class and learned (hat the children
were shadowing their tutors during
the day at Stanford.
Soon enough, DeLaPaz became a
tutor coordinator for EPA IT and
started recruiting other tutors from
around campus. Her involvement in
creased her commitment to service
and broadened her career path.
"I feel like I've been given a lot, and
I want to give back," she said.
Senior Rene Patnoud found his way
to give back through his saxophone ex
perience. Marina Kim, a sophomore,
found her niche in social entrepre
neurship and is now president of FU
SION, the Future Social Innovators
Network. Piotr Kosicki, also a sopho
more, became editor in chief of the
Stanford Review, making his contribu
tion by encouraging others to be en
gaged from a conservative perspective.
The resources are there, students
emphasized, and there is no shortage
of student groups energized about

problems that face Stanford, the Hay
Area and the world. It's not difficult to
become civically engaged, they said,
but students frequently take time find
ing their place or have the wrong im
pression of what it means to be civical
ly engaged.
"The culture here is busy," said se
nior JessicaJenkins. "There's pressure
to succeed while students are here.
Some students haven't had the expo
sure to the idea that service can be a
meaningful part of their academic ex
perience. There's not enough aware
ness of the different opportunities."
"It feels like oftentimes we do a lot of
armchair analysis," said senior Kali
Stanger. "We don't see ourselves as
people who can cause change."
But some involved students would
argue that they can and do effect posi
tive change. Recent anti-war protests
have drawn hundreds of people hop
ing to influence national policy. Many
champion environmental issues on
campus and in the surrounding areas.
Alternative Spring Break opens up stu
dents' eyes to issues from I lawaii to
rural North Dakota, and projects like
Street Forum, a newspaper dedicated
to poverty issues and homelessness,
emerge from that awareness.
'A link between faith and activism 1
Junior Ryan I lunter spent last sum
mer in Los Angeles with a program he
found through Inter Varsity, a campus
Christian fellowship. He tutored stu
dents in first through ninth grade and
lived in East Los Angeles.
"It was mostly a process of learning
about how Christianity deals with is
sues involving social justice," he said.
"It was a revelation for me to discover

that Christ has elevated these sort of
justice things."
Hunter joined Inter Varsity as a
freshman and said he first started to
understand the connection between
Christianity and social justice when he
took a trip to low-income areas in Oak
land. Poverty was not something that
had been discussed often in his subur
ban, white, upper-middle-class neigh
borhood in Ceorgia.
" This is something that Jesus cared
about," he said. "He called us to feel
very strongly about it as well."
I lunter said he sees faith as a perfect
connection to service, and it makes the
service more meaningful to him.
"From a Christian perspective,
there's . .. hope for change," he said.
"[ With service] you get a bigger picture
of what God can do."
Jenkins, editor in chief of Street
Forum, noticed a similar connection to
service coming from a Catholic per
spective.
"The gospel message is central to
what I do — humility and love," she
said. "I'm trying to show people a link
between faith and spirituality and ac
tivism."
Changing minds and policies
Jenkins said she knows that activism
involves linking service, education and
awareness in important ways. Though
Street Forum grew out of Night Out
reach — a project that serves the local
homeless community — it has become
its own publication designed to in
crease awareness about the pressing is
sues of poverty that don't make the
front page of mainstream newspapers.
Street Forum has one goal in com
mon with a recent anti-SUV rallv, anti

war protests, and even the Stanford
Review — encouraging students and
others to think about broader goals
and a world that is larger than Stan
ford.
"We try to at least educate students
here; mostly give them a different per
spective," said sophomore Joe Fair
banks, president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans.
Junior Noah Barish related that,
though a recent protest against SUVs
drew only about 25 people, it was suc
cessful because it made people more
conscious of the issue.
"There are not that many ways you
can change the minds of thousands of
people at once . . . you just have to start
clipping away at it," Barish said.
Stanger related how, over the past
year, she's felt the mood of the campus
transform over the issue of war with
Iraq.
"I really feel that times have
changed Stanford and that has
changed me," she said. "Being so
pissed off this year and being influ
enced by my peers made me realize I
want more of a role in society."
'Serendipitous' involvement
Some students come to Stanford
knowing they want to be involved in
community service, campus politics or
some other form of civic engagement,
while others stumble into opportuni
ties that fit them.
Patnoud, a saxophonist who is now
the chair of Stanford Alliance for Ser
vice Through the Arts, said he was not
particularly active with community ser
vice as a freshman because he was too
busy. But one day during his
sophomore year a friend asked
him if he could substitute fora
tutor and help with a local music
tutoring program.
" I went that day and went every
time for the next few years," he
said. "It changed my outlook on
the role of service. [Before tutor
ing,] I saw service as something
you did because it was the moral
thing to do. But you get to a point
where you want to do it."
"You really have to match the
activity with the person," Patnoud
continued, emphasizing that, for
him, musical tutoring was a per
fect fit. "It's pretty serendipitous
whether someone gets involved."
"For too many people, commu
nity service is what they had to do
to get into Stanford," he added.
"The problem is not fully under
standing what community service
can do in their lives."
Kim noted that her work with
FUSION connects different com
munities, like the Graduate School
of Business and business-minded
undergraduates, to community
service.
"Because [social entrepreneur
ship] is broader, it attracts many
different types of people," she
said. "It attracts traditional service
communities . .. and those inter
ested in using business or technol
ogy for social change."
'Justice — it's a lifestyle'
Diverse forms of civic engage
ment have varying effects on stu
dents, from drastically altering ca
reer paths to simply changing an
outlook on life. DeLaPaz now
wants to join the Peace Corps; Kim
is looking to work in socially con
scious business; Jenkins is apply
ing for public service fellowships in
the United States and volunteer
opportunities in Latin America;
and Fairbanks would like to work
in public policy.

"Justice isn't the sort of thing
you do once a week at a tutoring
program — it's a lifestyle."
Hunter said,
"[Social activism] has been a re
ally enriching component of my
education — it would have really
paled without it," Jenkins said.
Kim added, "It's definitely not
an 'either / or' to be civically en
gaged."
While it's not an either/or, it
may have broad or narrow im
pacts. A choice to not be involved,
students pointed out, isjust as seri
ous as a choice to be involved.
"I think all types of students
have some reason to want to get
engaged in the community and
world outside," said sophomore
fim Telleen-Lawton, president of
the Campus Greens. "I doubt that
there are very many students on
campus that just don't care about
the things that are happening in
the world at all."

knowing they want to be involved in
community service, campus politics or
some other form of civic engagement,
while others stumble into opportuni
ties that fit them.
Patnoud, a saxophonist who is now
the chair of Stanford Alliance for Ser
vice Through the Arts, said he was not
particularly active with community ser
vice as a freshman because he was too
busy. But one day during his
sophomore year a friend asked
him if he could substitute fora
tutor and help with a local music
tutoring program.
" I went that day and went every
time for the next few years," he
said. "It changed my outlook on
the role of service. [Before tutor
ing,] I saw service as something
you did because it was the moral
thing to do. But you get to a point
where you want to do it."
"You really have to match the
activity with the person," Patnoud
continued, emphasizing that, for
him, musical tutoring was a per
fect fit. "It's pretty serendipitous
whether someone gets involved."
"For too many people, commu
nity service is what they had to do
to get into Stanford," he added.
"The problem is not fully under
standing what community service
can do in their lives."
Kim noted that her work with
FUSION connects different com
munities, like the Graduate School
of Business and business-minded
undergraduates, to community
service.
"Because [social entrepreneur
ship] is broader, it attracts many
different types of people," she
said. "It attracts traditional service
communities . .. and those inter
ested in using business or technol
ogy for social change."
'Justice — it's a lifestyle'
Diverse forms of civic engage
ment have varying effects on stu
dents, from drastically altering ca
reer paths to simply changing an
outlook on life. DeLaPaz now
wants to join the Peace Corps; Kim
is looking to work in socially con
scious business; Jenkins is apply
ing for public service fellowships in
the United States and volunteer
opportunities in Latin America;
and Fairbanks would like to work
in public policy.

"Justice isn't the sort of thing
you do once a week at a tutoring
program — it's a lifestyle."
Hunter said,
"[Social activism] has been a re
ally enriching component of my
education — it would have really
paled without it," Jenkins said.
Kim added, "It's definitely not
an 'either / or' to be civically en
gaged."
While it's not an either/or, it
may have broad or narrow im
pacts. A choice to not be involved,
students pointed out, isjust as seri
ous as a choice to be involved.
"I think all types of students
have some reason to want to get
engaged in the community and
world outside," said sophomore
fim Telleen-Lawton, president of
the Campus Greens. "I doubt that
there are very many students on
campus that just don't care about
the things that are happening in
the world at all."

Demonstrations against war with
Iraq, rallies against SUVs and speech
es praising Roe vs. Wade are all forms
of civic engagement — but so are
Camp Kesem, Night Outreach and
Ravenswood Reads. Examining the
ways Stanford students arecivically en
gaged demonstrates that "engage
ment" can extend beyond community
service and also pertains to viewing
conduct in business, or even daily life,
from a socially responsible perspective
Amelia DeLaPaz, a sophomore,
came across East Palo Alto Tennis and
Tutoring by accident. She saw younger
children following Stanford students
to class and learned (hat the children
were shadowing their tutors during
the day at Stanford.
Soon enough, DeLaPaz became a
tutor coordinator for EPA IT and
started recruiting other tutors from
around campus. Her involvement in
creased her commitment to service
and broadened her career path.
"I feel like I've been given a lot, and
I want to give back," she said.
Senior Rene Patnoud found his way
to give back through his saxophone ex
perience. Marina Kim, a sophomore,
found her niche in social entrepre
neurship and is now president of FU
SION, the Future Social Innovators
Network. Piotr Kosicki, also a sopho
more, became editor in chief of the
Stanford Review, making his contribu
tion by encouraging others to be en
gaged from a conservative perspective.
The resources are there, students
emphasized, and there is no shortage
of student groups energized about

problems that face Stanford, the Hay
Area and the world. It's not difficult to
become civically engaged, they said,
but students frequently take time find
ing their place or have the wrong im
pression of what it means to be civical
ly engaged.
"The culture here is busy," said se
nior JessicaJenkins. "There's pressure
to succeed while students are here.
Some students haven't had the expo
sure to the idea that service can be a
meaningful part of their academic ex
perience. There's not enough aware
ness of the different opportunities."
"It feels like oftentimes we do a lot of
armchair analysis," said senior Kali
Stanger. "We don't see ourselves as
people who can cause change."
But some involved students would
argue that they can and do effect posi
tive change. Recent anti-war protests
have drawn hundreds of people hop
ing to influence national policy. Many
champion environmental issues on
campus and in the surrounding areas.
Alternative Spring Break opens up stu
dents' eyes to issues from I lawaii to
rural North Dakota, and projects like
Street Forum, a newspaper dedicated
to poverty issues and homelessness,
emerge from that awareness.
'A link between faith and activism 1
Junior Ryan I lunter spent last sum
mer in Los Angeles with a program he
found through Inter Varsity, a campus
Christian fellowship. He tutored stu
dents in first through ninth grade and
lived in East Los Angeles.
"It was mostly a process of learning
about how Christianity deals with is
sues involving social justice," he said.
"It was a revelation for me to discover

that Christ has elevated these sort of
justice things."
Hunter joined Inter Varsity as a
freshman and said he first started to
understand the connection between
Christianity and social justice when he
took a trip to low-income areas in Oak
land. Poverty was not something that
had been discussed often in his subur
ban, white, upper-middle-class neigh
borhood in Ceorgia.
" This is something that Jesus cared
about," he said. "He called us to feel
very strongly about it as well."
I lunter said he sees faith as a perfect
connection to service, and it makes the
service more meaningful to him.
"From a Christian perspective,
there's . .. hope for change," he said.
"[ With service] you get a bigger picture
of what God can do."
Jenkins, editor in chief of Street
Forum, noticed a similar connection to
service coming from a Catholic per
spective.
"The gospel message is central to
what I do — humility and love," she
said. "I'm trying to show people a link
between faith and spirituality and ac
tivism."
Changing minds and policies
Jenkins said she knows that activism
involves linking service, education and
awareness in important ways. Though
Street Forum grew out of Night Out
reach — a project that serves the local
homeless community — it has become
its own publication designed to in
crease awareness about the pressing is
sues of poverty that don't make the
front page of mainstream newspapers.
Street Forum has one goal in com
mon with a recent anti-SUV rallv, anti

war protests, and even the Stanford
Review — encouraging students and
others to think about broader goals
and a world that is larger than Stan
ford.
"We try to at least educate students
here; mostly give them a different per
spective," said sophomore Joe Fair
banks, president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans.
Junior Noah Barish related that,
though a recent protest against SUVs
drew only about 25 people, it was suc
cessful because it made people more
conscious of the issue.
"There are not that many ways you
can change the minds of thousands of
people at once . . . you just have to start
clipping away at it," Barish said.
Stanger related how, over the past
year, she's felt the mood of the campus
transform over the issue of war with
Iraq.
"I really feel that times have
changed Stanford and that has
changed me," she said. "Being so
pissed off this year and being influ
enced by my peers made me realize I
want more of a role in society."
