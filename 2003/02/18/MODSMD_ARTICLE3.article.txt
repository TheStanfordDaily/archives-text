### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Diplomats from South Korea, Japan, China, Rus
sia and the United States convened at Stanford on
Friday and Saturday for the panel "North Korea:
New Challenges, New Solutions," where they dis
cussed the implications of North Korea's develop
ing nuclear weapons and made policy recommen
dations for participating nations.
The two-day conference, the first of its kind pre
sented by the Korean Studies Program, consisted of
four panels titled "Continuity and Change in North
Korea," the "Legacy of Kim Dae-Jung and Inter-
Korea Relations," "Multi-lateral Collaboration,"
and "Policy Recommendations."
Among the 90 intellectuals and diplomats who
participated in this invite-only conference were
commander in chief of the United Nations' Repub
lic of Korea / United States Combined Forces and a
former prime minister of South Korea.

Sociology Prof. Ci-Wook Shin, who came up with
the idea of an international panel, organized it with
Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto and Michael
Armacost, a visiting professor at the Institute for In
ternational Studies. Shin is acting director of the Asia /
Pacific Research Center and director of the Korean
Studies Program.
According to Shin, the United States has only two
options in its relationship with North Korea: a pre
emptive strike or renegotiation.
"The United States has wasted a lot of time," Shin
said. "It could have done something earlier, probably
before the end of last year. But now it's already Feb
ruary . .. If they are going to renegotiate anyway, it's
better to do it sooner than later ... The Bush admin
istration has lost direction. Its hands are tied up with
Iraq. That's why I think it's a very difficult situation."
This conference, which was hosted by A / PARC, the
fnstitute for International Studies, Stanford University
and Korea's Dong A-Ilbo newspaper, was co-sponsored
by the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in

San Francisco, the Dong Yang Group, Hanhwa (a
chemical company) and Korea Development Bank.
The format of the panels allowed the diplomats
and other prominent representatives from each of the
five countries to present their thoughts, which were
followed by input from experts and a few observers.
During the first panel, "Continuity and Change in
North Korea," B.C. Koh from the Institute for Far
Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University, emphasized
the persistence of former North Korean President Kim
II Sung's ideals in current President Kim Jong Il's
regime and the notion of Chuch'e Sasang, or "ideolo
gy of self-reliance," on which North Korea depends.
"I think the Bush administration made a serious
tactical error when it ruled out serious talks with
North Korea," Koh said.
In response to proposals for economic and other
policy changes in North Korea, Chung-In Moon of
Yonsei University said that the United States "needs to
talk to North Korea. Trying to im
pose on the North Korean regime
several changes won't work."
The second panel, "Legacy of
Kim Dae-Jung and Inter-Korea
Relations," focused more on the
legacy of the "Sunshine Policy"
and the importance of continu
ing an engagement policy with
North Korea.
Some policy recommendations
suggested during the second panel
included South Korea's need to
deal with North Korean refugees,
and involvement by non-govern
mental organizations, especially in
the realm of human rights.
"Multi-lateral Collaboration,"
the theme of the third panel, called
for the United States to encourage
more multilateral cooperation on
the part of Japan, China and Rus
sia. Representatives from those
countries expressed their opposi

tion to a nuclear North Korea.
"Policy Recommendations," the
fourth panel, yielded several pro
posed strategies. The panelists said
that maintaining an alliance be
tween South Korea and the Unit
ed States is essential for success in
any policy toward North Korea.
Moreover, they need to agree on a
"red line," a set limit on what they
can allow North Korea to do.
"At this point, we have no com
mon understanding of a 'red
line,' " Shin said.
The other two policy recom
mendations included the United
States' need to negotiate with
North Korea before exercising
any possible military action and
the need fora quick resolution.
The panelist agreed that North
Korea is determined to develop
and possess nuclear weapons,
rather than provide lip service to a
non-nuclear defense policy or bar
gain with others.
"1 think North Korea will keep
pressing until the United States
comes to the table," Shin said.
