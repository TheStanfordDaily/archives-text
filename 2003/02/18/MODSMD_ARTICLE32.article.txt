# 'Bubble' mentality not unique to Stanford
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
The notion that the Stanford
campus forms a "bubble," insu
lating its inhabitants from social
and political issues beyond the
confines of Campus Drive, has
for years influenced perceptions
of students' civic engagement.
References to the Stanford bub
ble crop up in house meetings,
ASSU forums, and the mission
statements and even names of
student groups.
Opinion is divided on whether
the bubble is a myth or reality —
most locate the truth somewhere
in between. But a quick search on
Google revealed that concerns of
insularity are not unique to the
Farm: There is also a"Yale bub
ble," a "UCLA bubble" and even a
"Berkeley bubble."

The consensus among student
leaders is that obstacles to civic en
gagement — such as overcommit
ment, geographical isolation and
political disenfranchisement —
exist in varying degrees at all col
leges. But, they say, that's no ex
cuse for apathy.
"The things that take up our
time here sometimes compete
with our ability to focus on the na
tional news, and that's under
standable," said ASSU President
Monica Henestroza, a senior. "But
a lot of Stanford students are
going to be leaders when they
leave, so it's important that they
are knowledgeable about what's
going on in the world."
Sophomore Hunter Hargraves,
ASSU chief of stalTand chair of last
last fall's Get Out the Vote cam
paign, agreed.
"I think [the bubble mentality]
is something that's not just at
Stanford," he said. "It's
typical of other campuses. It al
ways requires a little extra work to
look beyond your academic ef
forts and gather up the motiva
tion to participate."
Junior Stephen Chan, coordi
nator of National Civic Engage
ment Week at Stanford, noted that
while the academic focus at re
search universities does not lend it
self to civic involvement, "Stanford
students are definitely more en
gaged than [those at] most univer
sities across the nation."
Drawing a distinction between
involvement and engagement,
Chan argued that many of Stan
ford's numerous student groups
neglect to relate their activities to
broader themes of civic responsi
bility.
"We're busy, and maybe we're a
little bit internally focused," he
said. "There isn't [enough of] a
movement to see, 'What are the so
cietal implications of what we're
doing?' " Chan pointed to pre
professional societies as examples
of groups that get caught up in the
minutiae of "MCATs and LSATs"

and miss out on chances to tackle
issues of social and political import.
Everyone The Daily inter
viewed agreed that resources and
opportunities for involvement
abound at Stanford, though per
ceptions differed on the extent to
which those resources are proper
ly utilized.
"I think Stanford has lots of op
portunities to be civically engaged
and definitely encourages it, but I
don't know how focused [the en
couragement] is," said sophomore
Amelia Del^aPaz.
"There are almost more groups
than people," added sophomore
Marina Kim, president of the Fu
ture Social Innovators Network.
Several students praised the
Haas Center for Public Service as
an excellent starting point for in
volvement in issues and activities
pertinent to the community out
side Stanford. Henestroza said
the center's reputation was one
reason she decided to attend the
University.
"Our community centers and
Haas Center probably encourage
involvement more [than the re
sources available at other
schools]," Henestroza said.
"Brown is the only one I can think
of that would be comparable."
Why, then, does Stanford's rep
utation for apathy and insularity
persist?
"Stanford is isolated, especially
if you compare it to urban
schools," Henestroza offered.
"Our geographical location makes
it so that, if you want to, you can ig
nore your position in the broader
community."
Hargraves admitted, "To some
degree, there's always going to be
that little bit of apathy .. . When
you're at a university that asks you
to do so much academically, the
pressure to go out and be political
ly active is going to be hard no mat
ter what.
"There needs to be a conscious
awareness by every Stanford stu
dent that they have the resources

to be aware and they have the op
portunities to be involved, and it's
just a matter of choosing: 'What do
I want to get involved in?' "
For many, that is the hard part.
The array of opportunities can be
daunting, so students must priori
tize the one or two endeavors that
most inspire them.
Henestroza pointed out that
many students are more in
volved than they give each other
credit for.
"Often, people don't see what
others are doing," she said. "The
person who you live next door to
might be the person who's in
charge of Night Outreach, but you
might not know that because
you're busy doing environmental
advocacy."
The pressure on Stanford stu
dents to maintain the appearance
of casual Californians may play
into this perception.
"[Student engagement] is never
in your face," said senior Kali
Stanger. "Maybe it has to do with
how we're so laid back — you can
get caught up in that."
Many agree with Stanger that,
post-Sept. 11 and with war loom
ing, students' responsibility to pay
attention to issues beyond the day
to-day academic grind may be
come unavoidable.
"Very few of us are inspired
enough by general ideas to spend
our time doing things that are con
ceptually interesting, so often it's a
personal thing, a specific thing that
motivates us," Henestroza said.
Hargraves added, "People in
my class and most people at Stan
ford, they didn't expect a college
experience that would be marked
by so much drama in the interna
tional community. To me, that has
opened most people's eyes in
terms of exploring new ways to be
involved in political activism. I
think we've seen a huge change
even in the past year."
