### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford Board of Trustees decided to
giant membership to Wendy Munger, Class of
1972, at its winter quarter meeting last Tuesday.
Munger previously served as a corporate
lawyer and, according to the trustees, an "active
civic volunteer" in Southern California. She re
ceived her bachelor's in English from Stanford
and a law degree from the UCLA Law School.
"The most important [qualification] is (hat
she is a long-time dedicated volunteer for Stan
ford," said Board Chair Isaac Stein. "The num
ber one attribute that we look for is commitment
to the institution.
"Stanford produces many talented alumni," he
continued. "We look for people who are from dif
ferent parts of the country; California is an area
from where we have a great many."
Munger has worked for the University's
Campaign for Undergraduate Education and
was on a special gifts committee for the 25th re
union of her Stanford class.
The University's Founding Crant allows the
board to have a maximum membership of 35
trustees and places the board in charge of manag
ing Stanford's endowment and properties.
Stein explained that potential members are fre
quently recommended to the board by other orga
nizations and individuals.
"We solicit from many different sources," Stein
said. "We have a nominating committee that is con
tinuously maintaining a review."
In regards to additional appointments to the
board, Stein commented, "We have 33 â€” I sus
pect that we will fill one more opening, but that's
up to the trustees to decide."
Stein expressed satisfaction with the board's de
cision to make Munger a trustee.
" I think Wendy is a very talented individual," he
said. "She will bring her commitment and skills to
the benefit of Stanford."
