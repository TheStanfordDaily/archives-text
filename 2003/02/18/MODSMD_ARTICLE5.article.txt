# Students ponder fasting for peace
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Sheila Provencher was a graduate stu
dent at Notre Dame, she read a magazine article
about the effects of economic sanctions on the peo
ple oflraq. The plight of the Iraqi people touched
her heart, she said, and although she was a student
with limited time and resources, Provencher did
what little she could to reach out to them.
She cut out the photo of an Iraqi baby suffering
from malnutrition and kept him in her prayer
book. She spent the 40 days of Lent eating only the
rations allowed to the Iraqi people — flour, sugar,
tea, rice, a few beans and sometimes a bit of pow
dered milk or cheese.
"I did what I could where I was," Provencher said.

"And then the little things grew to bigger things."
Now a full-time activist, Provencher recently
participated in a 28-day water-only fast for peace
on the streets of New York last September and
went on a mission to Iraq in December.
On Sunday, she spoke at Stanford with Father
Jim Barnett on their experiences fasting on the
streets of New York and visiting Iraq. Their
speeches demonstrated "a deep conviction and
hope that there must be another way than war,"
said Sister Gloria Jones, who organized the event
on behalf of the Catholic Community at Stanford.
Senior Jessica Jenkins is planning a student Fast
for Peace to take place at Stanford in the coming
weeks. About 20 students from diverse organiza
tions and religions have expressed interest in being
involved in the fast.
"It would be beneficial for people on campus to
see the level of conviction we have about non-vio
lence," Jenkins said.
At Sunday's presentation, Provencher advised in
terested students and community members in atten
dance to commit several small actions on a daily basis.
"Whether it's calling a congressman, e-mailing a
senator, praying and fasting ... do what you can,
where you are — that's how I started," she said.
Barnett discussed his decision to join the fasting
effort as a means of showing frustration with the
U.S. government's use of force.
" 'There must be another way' is a kind of
mantra, a kind of plea, which developed among us
[people of the Dominican order of the Catholic
Church]," Barnett said. "We looked at what was
happening [the violent response to Sept. 111, and
we said, 'There must be another way.' "
That conviction led to the September fast in New
York. Although the fast began with just four peo
ple— Barnett, Provencher and two other Domini
cans — a Web site was created to publicize the fast and
drew 65,(KM) hits from over 39 countries, including
Iraq. New York police estimated 1 (),()()() people saw
the banner for the fast everyday, and 100 people

stopped by to talk or pray each day.
One such passerby, a homeless
man named Francisco, would pray
with the group each day, and at the
end of the month, he joined a resi
dential program, Provencher said.
When the program had a family
day, she said, "He actually invited
us to come because he said, 'I told
them that you were my family.' "
Provencher presented the
sounds, faces and stories of the peo
ple she met in Iraq. She told a story
of her visit to Basrah, an area of Iraq
that has been repeatedly bombed by
the United States since 1991, where
she met a 26-member family living
under one roof. Although one of his
children had been killed and anoth
er had his hand mangled by bombs,

the father of the family ran out to
Provencher and said, "Welcome,
this is your home."
She also related the fear that
she felt upon visiting a shelter
where 400 women and children
had died in a "smart bomb" attack
during the Gulf War in 1991.
"1 was scared because . . . 1
didn't know if it was part of the past
or the future," Provencher said.
"But I thought, This is unaccept
able,' and I wished that our gov
ernment officials could stand there
and realize that it's not just collat
eral damage, it's an unacceptable
sacrifice of brothers and sisters."
She added, "My prayer is that
as we work for peace, we do not
deny the crisis but seek other
ways. That we remember the
hope and act in celebration of the
light that is there; that we remem
ber those people who literally
danced in the darkness. We need
to dance with them."

as we work for peace, we do not
deny the crisis but seek other
ways. That we remember the
hope and act in celebration of the
light that is there; that we remem
ber those people who literally
danced in the darkness. We need
to dance with them."
