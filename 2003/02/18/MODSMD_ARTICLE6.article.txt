### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Holding signs that asked "Did your car start this war.-'"
and chanting slogans such as "SUV SOS," a group of
about 20 students protested sport utility vehicles ai the
Hummer dealership in Burlingameon Friday.
The students, joined by a few mothers from "Don't Be
Fueled — Mothers 'Gasroots' Campaign" and some con
cerned citi/ens, tried to attract the attention oi passing
cars and pedestrians.
"This is an awareness-raising campaign," said Josh
Bushinsky, a senior earth systems major and one of the co
ordinators of the protest. 1 his affects everyone.
The protest began with a rally in White Plaza at noon, at
tracting a crowd of around 50 students. Jonathan Neril, a se
nior majoring in international relations, delivered a speech
outlining the connections between environmental degrada
tion, terrorism, war with Iraq and SUVs — popular vehicles
that have been increasingly criticized for their low fuel-effi
ciency and the subsequent political and environmental
repercussions. The group joining him was comprised of stu
dents from a variety of organizations, including Stanford
Bike Adv(x:ates, Students for Environment Action at Stan
ford and the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice.
"We're representing a much greater number of con
cerned Stanford students," Bushinsky said.
Neril was succeeded by several spoken-word artists
who elaborated on the theme of SUVs as inefficient, dan
gerous and imperialistic vehicles. Students identified the
"thick black blood" of oil and"the road-bound arms
race" that SUVs cause.
