# Students protest the 'axles of evil'
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Holding signs that asked "Did your car start this war.-'"
and chanting slogans such as "SUV SOS," a group of
about 20 students protested sport utility vehicles ai the
Hummer dealership in Burlingameon Friday.
The students, joined by a few mothers from "Don't Be
Fueled — Mothers 'Gasroots' Campaign" and some con
cerned citi/ens, tried to attract the attention oi passing
cars and pedestrians.
"This is an awareness-raising campaign," said Josh
Bushinsky, a senior earth systems major and one of the co
ordinators of the protest. 1 his affects everyone.
The protest began with a rally in White Plaza at noon, at
tracting a crowd of around 50 students. Jonathan Neril, a se
nior majoring in international relations, delivered a speech
outlining the connections between environmental degrada
tion, terrorism, war with Iraq and SUVs — popular vehicles
that have been increasingly criticized for their low fuel-effi
ciency and the subsequent political and environmental
repercussions. The group joining him was comprised of stu
dents from a variety of organizations, including Stanford
Bike Adv(x:ates, Students for Environment Action at Stan
ford and the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice.
"We're representing a much greater number of con
cerned Stanford students," Bushinsky said.
Neril was succeeded by several spoken-word artists
who elaborated on the theme of SUVs as inefficient, dan
gerous and imperialistic vehicles. Students identified the
"thick black blood" of oil and"the road-bound arms
race" that SUVs cause.

Senior lan Monroe, an earth systems major, promotes biking
and protests SUVs at Friday's anti-SUV rally in White Plaza.
"There is a direct cohnection
between over-consumption of oil
and war with Iraq," said sopho
more Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, one
of the spoken-word artists.
"We want people to know that
their choices make a difference,"
Bushinsky said.
At the dealership, students walked
around an intersection chanting
"Osama B. loves your SUV" and car
rying signs witii slogans like "Aban
don your axles of evil."
The students did attract a few
honks from cars and caused some
people to slow down and read
their signs, but overall the rally did
not draw too much attention from
people passing by.
Standing on the steps of the
Hummer dealership — where, to
the disappointment of the protest
ers, there was only a Corvette
sports car and a Monte Carlo
sedan, not a Hummer H2 SUV —

students repeated the message
they gave in White Plaza.
During the protest, the owners
of the Hummer dealership tried to
kick the protesters off their steps
by repeatedly setting off the
alarms in their displayed cars.
"This is a piece of a larger move
ment," said Lauren Klein Mayes, a
mother who joined the protest.
"Detroit has hoodwinked us to
make us think fSUVs] are safe and
[car companies] have used it to get
their businesses out of the red. It's
a really emotional issue."
Student demands were as varied
as the groups that supported the
protest, but the groups were united
in an eflort to show that there is a de
mand lor more fuel-efficient vehi
cles and to educate the public about
the problems posed by SUVs.
"If you switch from a normal
car to an SUV, it's equivalent to
leaving a light bulb on for 28
years —it makes a difference,"
Bushinsky said.
"When we fill up at the gas sta
tion, we fund terror and oppres
sion," Neril said.
