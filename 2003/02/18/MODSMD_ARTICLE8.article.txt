## Stampede kills 21 in nightclub 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) â€” It was a chaotic scene: Hun
dreds of screaming people stumbling down the stairs of
an illegally operated nightclub, gasping for air and
stepping on bodies, only to find themselves trapped at
the bottom trying to escape through a single exit.
At least 21 people were killed and 57 injured in the
stampede early yesterday at the crowded E2 night
club, authorities said. There were reports that as
many as 500 people were crammed into the second
floor club when someone sprayed Mace or pepper
spray to quell a fight about 2 a.m.
A judge ordered the owners to close their second
floor club last July because of safety violations, includ
ing failure to provide enough exits, city officials said
yesterday. A judge had denied a request by the own
ers to reopen.
"The owner knows damn well that he is not to open
that second-floor facility," said Fire Commissioner
James Joyce. City officials said they plan to go to court
as early as Tuesday to seek criminal contempt charges
against the owner.
Witnesses described a frenzied scene of some peo
ple trying to climb through the ceiling, while others
were trampled in the frantic rush for an exit, their
faces and bodies flattened against the glass front door.
Some people fainted on the club floor; others were
coughing and crying, blindly groping for any way out.
"People were being trapped underneath you ... so
we're actually standing on people's heads and we didn't
even know it," said Amishoov Blackwell, a 30-year-old
patron. "It was just bodies laying everywhere."
Joyce also scaled down the number of people in
the club to about 500; earlier, the fire department
had estimated as many as 1,500 people were on the
second floor.
Police Superintendent Terry Hillard said investi
gators were trying to sort out conflicting stories about
the source of the Mace or pepper spray and obtain
videotape from inside the club. Witnesses said the
spray may have come from the club's security guards
trying to break up a fight between at least two women.
"We will get to the bottom of this," he said. "Right
now our investigation is at full tilt."
Witnesses said some people were stomped on;
victims suffered crushing chest and head injuries.
By yesterday evening only seven of the injured re
mained hospitalized. Most of the dead were in their
20s or early 30s.
