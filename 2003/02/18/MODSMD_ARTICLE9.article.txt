BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — An American U-2 sur
veillance plane made its first flight over Iraq yester
day in support of the current U.N. inspection mis
sion, marking another concession by Saddam Hus
sein's regime to stave off a U.S.-led attack.
Meanwhile, Iraqi state television broadcast
scenes of Iraqi troops in maneuvers to defend the
country from a possible U.S. attack. State television
also said Saddam praised last weekend's anti-war
protests, singling out those in Italy, Spain and
Britain whose governments support the strong U.S.
position against Baghdad.
The U-2 flight took place only one week after
the United Nations and Baghdad broke an im
passe that had kept the reconnaissance plane
grounded since the start of inspections in No
vember.
The Iraqis agreed to allow U-2 flights last week,
fulfilling a major demand by U.N. inspectors seek
ing to determine if Iraq still harbors weapons of
mass destruction.
"At 11:55 a.m., a U-2 surveillance plane entered
Iraqi airspace and reconnoitered several areas of
Iraq and left Iraqi airspace at 4:15 p.m.," the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "The recon
naissance operation lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes."
Baghdad is under strong pressure from the Unit
ed States to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors
or face attack. The United States and Britain reject
Iraqi claims to have abandoned all weapons of mass
destruction.
