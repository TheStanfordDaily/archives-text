Author and magazine editor Cole
guides readers on an introspective
"quest for the answers to life's
fundamental questions" via the
simple but often laborious process
of living truthfully. Cole imparts
wisdom without self-righteousness
when describing her current
successes as well as the
transformation she underwent
following a failed marriage,
abortion, miscarriage and years
of drug and alcohol abuse. In an
intelligent, confessional writing
style, she methodically presents her
information, which covers an
extensive range: from rediscovering
spirituality and honoring the
physical body, to assessing one's
work environment and developing
healthy friendships. To emphasize
the need for an ongoing dialogue
with one's self, she prescribes
journal writing; and each chapter
ends with thought-provoking
questions as well as tips for
meditation and prayer. Cole
underscores her theme of living an
authentic, empowered life by way of
anecdotes; exercises to analyze and
overcome fears, release grudges,
and understand the impact and
importance of one's words; as well
as inspirational quotes from the
likes of Thoreau, Nelson Mandela
and Bertram! Russell.
