### 
DAEGU, South Korea (AP) —
Kim Ho-keun, a 68-year-old
grandfather, was about to get off
the crowded subway when an ex
plosion knocked him to the floor.
He awoke in darkness minutes
later, gasping for breath and des
perate to escape a fiery attack that
killed at least 124 people yester
day.
Struggling to call for help, Kim
feared the worst until he heard a
rescue worker's voice.
"I couldn't see him, but I saw
his flashlight, so I grabbed his
hand," Kim said from his hospital
bed, tubes supplying him with
oxygen. "It was then that I
thought to myself: I'm going to
live."
Kim was one of the fortunate in
Daegu, South Korea's third
largest city.
The fire started about 10 a.m.
when a man lit a container of flam
mable liquid and tossed it. The
blaze incinerated two six-car sub
way trains, killed at least 124 peo
ple and injured 145, one-third of
them seriously.
Today, authorities said about
300 people were also reported
missing but added that the num
ber was greatly inflated.
"That doesn't mean that all of
them were killed yesterday," said
disaster official Koo Bon-kun.
"People just report their family
members who did not return
home."

Also today, forensic experts
gathered scorched human re
mains for identification as rescuers
returned for one last effort to
search for the missing.
"People could have hidden to
escape the smoke, last night we did
a final search but we have found
nothing," Daegu Mayor Cho Hae
nyoung told reporters.
A suspect who police say has a
history of mental illness was under
interrogation. Police said they did
not know what motivated the at
tack or what substance the attacker
used to start the blaze.
The fire began in one train at a
station, igniting seats and spread
ing to another train as it pulled in,
officials said. More people died in
the second train because many of
the doors failed to open, trapping
passengers.
YTN TV news channel report
ed the second train arrived four
minutes after the fire started. It
was not clear why the second train
was not warned of the lire or di
verted from the station.
Many bodies were burned be
yond recognition. Officials said
they would have to wait for I)NA
tests to confirm the number of
dead, which could take weeks.
Other people died of asphyxia
tion on the train platform. One
man said his missing daughter
called by mobile phone to say
there was a fire and the subway
door wasn't opening.
