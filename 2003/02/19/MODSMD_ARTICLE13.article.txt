# Wrong organs given to transplant patient

### 
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) —A 17-year-old girl
lay near death yesterday after mistakenly re
ceiving a heart and lung transplant from a
donor with the wrong blood type, and hospi
tal officials held out little hope of finding a new
set of organs in time.
Jesica Santillan's condition steadily deterio
rated after the botched operation Feb. 7. She
suffered a heart attack Feb. 10 and a seizure
on Sunday, and was in critical condition with
a machine keeping her heart and lungs going.
"Right now my daughter is between life
and death. She could die at any moment," her
mother, Magdalena Santillan, said in Spanish
through an interpreter. "My daughter needs
a transplant of a heart and lungs to survive.
It's the only hope that we have because the
doctors made an error."
A family friend said the girl has only a few
days left.
The girl has type O-positive blood but was
given organs from a donor with type-A blood
during the operation at Duke University Hos
pital.

Hospital spokesman Richard Puff said he
could not specify how the mistake was made.
But he said that the hospital stall believed the
organs were compatible and that compatibili
ty had been confirmed.
Jesica's body was rejecting the organs be
cause of the different blood types. Antibodies in
her blood attacked the organs as foreign objects.
Puff said the girl is a candidate for another
transplant and "we remain hopeful that will
happen." But he said the hospital can do little
to improve her odds.
"We're going through the usual system of
transplant agencies. That's all we can do,"
he said.
Jesica remained on the national waiting list
kept by the United Network for Organ Shar
ing. Spokeswoman Anne Paschke said the na
tional organ procurement group cannot specif
ically search fora heart and lungs for Jesica.
"Unfortunately, there are very few organs
available," Paschke said. The organs not only
have to be the right blood type, they have to be
the right size to lit into the girl's chest cavity.

Mack Mahoney, the family friend, said Jesi
ca is small for her age — 5-foot-2 and 85
pounds — and any donated organs would
probably come from a child.
"We have a good chance of saving this
child's life if we find a donor in the next cou
ple of days," he said.
In the meantime, he said, the life-support
apparatus was hurting Jesica, raising the dan
ger of bleeding, stroke and kidney damage.
Jesica, who is from a small town near
Guadalajara, Mexico, needed the transplant
because a heart deformity kept her lungs from
getting oxygen into her blood. Mahoney said
she would have died within six months with
out a transplant.
The donated organs were flown in from
Boston. They were sent with paperwork cor
rectly listing the donor's type-A blood, said
Sean Fitzpatrick of the New England Organ
Bank, which sent the organs.
The hospital's chief executive, Dr. William
Fulkerson, said it was still investigating how
the mistake happened.
