# Millions stolen in Belgian diamond heist
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) â€”
Thieves emptied more than 100
vaults at a diamond trading center
in what officials said might be the
largest theft ever in Antwerp, the
gem trading capital of the world.
Authorities were still trying
yesterday to determine the
amount of the loss from the cellar
of a building that houses dozens
of gem trading companies in a
city that has been a center of the
trade in precious stones since the
16th century.
The thieves bypassed heavy se

curity to steal the diamonds from
123 of 160 vaults in the cellar of the
Antwerp Diamond Center over
the weekend. The loss was dis
closed Monday.
Previously, the largest theft on
record in Antwerp occurred in
1994, when thieves cleaned out
five vaults in the Diamond Center,
fora loss of $4.55 million. Two Is
raelis and another man from
Brazil were convicted in that theft
but their case is on appeal.
The total in the weekend bur
glary was likely to be much larger,

said Youri Steverlynck, a
spokesman for the High Dia
mond Council, which regulates
the gem trade.
"We are certainly talking about
many millions," Steverlynck said.
The Diamond Center, in the
heart of Antwerp's historic gem
district, has extremely heavy secu
rity including surveillance cameras
and round-the-clock guards for
the vaults. There was no sign of
forced entry in the weekend
break-in so authorities suspect an
inside job.

"Interrogations of people work
ing at the center are ongoing," said
Leen Nuyts, a magistrate from the
city prosecutor's office.
The thieves dropped some pre
cious stones, suggesting they were
in a great rush, but Nuyts said it
still would have taken hours to
empty so many vaults.
More than half of world dia
mond production, either rough or
polished, passes through Antwerp
and local officials feared the theft
would hurt the city's image as a
trading center.
