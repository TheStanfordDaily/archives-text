The recent plagiarism of Stan
ford physics professor Renata
Kallosh's paper "Superpoten
tial of Black Holes" by former
Kumaon University Vice Chancellor Bal
want Singh Rajput has demonstrated
that, far from occurring solely in class
rooms, misconduct occurs at the highest
levels of academia. This recent case of un
abashed plagiarism was both executed
and permitted by professionals who can
claim no ignorance of academic and pro
fessional ethics.
Astonishingly, this is not an isolated in
cident in the field: The editor of the jour
nal that originally published Kallosh's
paper has said that the publication deals
with multiple instances of plagiarism

of a highly competitive field; the pursuit

students report they consider cheating to

These arguments are justified by short
sighted statements such as the beliefs that
no one is hurt by the cheating or that stu
dents may be held at experience a disad
vantage if everyone else cheats. These
seemingly insignificant acts of academic
misconduct are reinforced in academic
environments wherein punishment is in
frequent and faculty receive little admin
istrative support for disciplining cheaters.

highest standards of conduct within the
academic community. As a research insti
tution, Stanford's primary occupations in
clude the production and dissemination
of new knowledge. Scholars and profes
sionals are responsible for managing this
knowledge so that it serves the end of im
proving society and the human condition.
The academic community thrives
owing to a sort of mutual trust and re
spect: Researchers publish their work to
add to the public domain of knowledge
and information so that others may build
on their research.
Any abridgement of this trust and re
spect inhibits the core mission of this in
tellectual community. A culture of mis
trust within academia would inhibit the
free exchange of ideas and render the
critical tradition ineffective, ultimately re
stricting knowledge from serving noble
ends outside the university.
The other party to this relationship of
mutual trust and respect is the students.
Regrettably, several studies have revealed
alarming increases in the amount of
cheating occurring at college campuses,

a lot of academic misconduct activity, how
ever, risks a devaluation of its reputation
and the degrees it offers.
The Honor Code and the Fundamen
tal Standard protect Stanford from
diminution of its reputation, contempt of
its principles and devaluation of a Stan
ford degree. For several decades, the ad
ministration, faculty and students have
labored to develop a fair and robust
Honor Code that will uphold these stan
dards. As final exams approach, we urge
all Stanford students and faculty to re
flect on the spirit of the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard: No short
term gain by cheating is more valuable
than the long-term benefits of being as
sociated with an institution whose activi
ties are governed by eminent standards
of academic conduct. Furthermore, it is
also imperative that all Stanford students
and faculty recognize that these acts of
misconduct are evident in the academic
world and that the Stanford community
ought to set an example of responsible
and honorable academic performance to
the larger society.
