## Questioning car culture 
### 
We live in a car-ob
sessed culture, where
vehicles are a symbol
of wealth, a symbol of
status, a symbol of freedom.
Cars are cherished objects. Who
hasn't looked longingly at that new
Viper zipping down El Camino?
Fora moment, we envision our
selves as that driver, talking on his
cellphone and telling his stockbro
ker to buy a few hundred shares of
a Fortune-500 company.
We all secretly desire to be that
guy. But watching him pass by from
inside the Shopping Express Mar
guerite Bus won't get us any closer
to that reality.
Is it important to have such nice
cars?
I don't think so. I don't under
stand why someone would spend
tens of thousands of dollars more
fora Mercedes Benz when a
Honda, for example, would work
just the same. Is it important to
flash our money around in the
new Lexus ? To some people, it is
critical. Fora few, that is the only
reason for being here at Stanford:
to make a lot of money, buy a nice
car, own an overpriced home and
win the trophy wife.
For people who hold this sort
of mentality, using public transit
is never considered as an option.
Public transit is looked down
upon. And for those who have be
come used to the convenience of
driving cars, using public transit is
rarely considered.
But using public transit is more
important than ever today.
The United States may go to

war for oil — so is
it not important
to conserve a bit
these days? Sure,
we may do the
whole political
college-kid thing
and go to the City
to protest the war,
but if we're driv
ing a gas-guzzler,

the blood is on our hands as well.
On the flip side, using public tran
sit lessens our dependency on oil,
lessens the strain on a city's road
and maintenance budget and
lessens the amount of pollutants

"We may do the whole
political-college-kid
thing and protest the
war, but if we're driving
a gas-guzzler, the blood
is on our hands as
well"

released into the atmosphere.
Going down this road (no pun
intended), is it really necessary to
drive Hummers? I mean, there's
a waiting list for these things! Un
less these drivers enjoy road trips
to the Arctic on the weekends (like
Leßron James apparently), I
doubt they need one. These new
street-legal Hummers are the

next phase of our SUV-obsessed
culture. What's next? The Ford
Panzer Tank?
As a freshman, I was originally
upset by the fact that I would not
be able to bring a car to campus.
But now I see it more as a blessing
than a burden. Not having a car is
the greatest thing that has hap
pened to me. 1 save a crapload of
money and I don't have to deal
with the stress of traffic, trying to
find parking on campus and driv
ing in general.
Some students, especially
freshmen, say that without a car
there's no way to get off campus.
Sure there is — the Palo Alto
Caltrain Depot is a popular spot
used by all the transit systems in
the Peninsula.
But while I encourage people to
make use of public transit, I'm not
asking people to give up their cars
for good — as a Californian, that
would be blasphemy.
What I am asking is that we
take a look at what drives us to
buy the bigger cars or the nicer
cars. Is it fora sense of security? I
doubt it, since SUVs have proved
to be bigger killers than regular
sized cars. Is it for status? It's hard
for me to envy someone who must
park his car at the back of the lot
or use a tarp to cover it. Is it to as
sert individuality? I can think of
better, less expensive ways, to do
that. What is it?
It's a question we must ask our
selves.
