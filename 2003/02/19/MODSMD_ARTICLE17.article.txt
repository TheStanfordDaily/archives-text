legacy admissions benefit Stanford
As the ASSU Senate decides whether to
endorse President Hennessey's letter sup
porting affirmative action, many are call
ing into question the practice of legacy ad
missions. Often, arguments against affir
mative action are met with questions as to
why a process based on ethnicity is receiv
ing so much criticism while a process
based on family history, wealth or connec
tions is receiving little or no attention.
Before the legacy issue can be tack
led publicly, we need some hard num
bers that can prove statistically that
legacy students are enjoying an advan
taged admissions process. While it is
true that legacy students have a higher
admission rate, the philosophy upon
which affirmative action is based pre
dicts that this is true — children from
economically advantaged families
(which alumni tend to be) will perform
better academically than the average
person. This may be part of a support
ing argument for affirmative action,
but it is not an argument against legacy
students.
Furthermore, a disproportionate

number of minority students receive fi
nancial aid at Stanford and alumni funds
provide much of this aid. Thus, it's ap
propriate to consider something: If the
child of a rich alumnus takes the place of
someone academically more deserving of
admission, the donation this brings to
Stanford may pay for someone else's — in
some cases several people's — under
graduate education.
So by ending weighted legacy admis
sions, we may very well keep a small
number of undeserving people from
getting into Stanford. But at the same
time, we may be closing Stanford's
doors to deserving students for whom
necessary aid is now unavailable — and
many of those students will be ethnic
minorities, simply because at this lime,
these minorities receive a greater
amount of financial aid per person than
non-minorities.
Finally, defending an argument by at
tacking another argument is simply falla
cious. The fairness of affirmative action
and legacy admission are two separate is
sues, and the existence of one does not
necessarily justify the other.

Link between anti-Semitism and
anri-lsraeli sentiment?
I just wanted to make a comment about
the Stanford Israel Alliance advertise
ment in the Feb. 18 edition of The Daily.
I don't want to be too political about
this, but I hope that the Stanford Israel Al
liance also supports Palestine's right to
exist as a state. I thought I should point
out that this advert unfortunately — and
I hope accidentaly — appears to draw a
link between anti-Israeli sentiment and
anti-Semitism.
Anti-Semitism is a form of racism and I
hope that all students at Stanford recog
nize that racism in any form is a bad thing.
Anti-Israeli sentiment, however, has
nothing to do with racism, but is simply
disagreeing with the actions of Israel as a
whole (i.e. the actions of the Israeli gov
ernment). I hope that at Stanford there is
a sufficient mix of political views and that
every one of the world's government s has
opponents here. I personally disagree
with the governmental policies of many
countries, including those of the United
States, the United Kingdom (where I
come from) and Israel.

Surprised over paid advertisements
I was pleasantly surprised to find that
The Daily agreed to publish a petition
signed by over 1500 students expressing
support for "Israel's right to exist as a Jew
ish state, and as a democracy within safe
and secure borders" in the Feb. 18 issue.
Yet, something struck me as odd. I no
ticed at the top of the petition that The
Daily made it clear that it was a paid ad
vertisement, not an all-together surprising
nor disappointing fact.
Then, I turned the page to a picture
about a woman named Rebecca, who (or so
the box explains) was conceived by rape,
and just because of that didn't deserve to be
executed (i.e. by abortion.) Funny, I
thought. There was no paid advertisement
announcement at the top of this box. 1 can
only conclude that being anti-abortion (or
Pro-Life, as some view it) is the official opin
ion of The Stanford Daily.

Editors Note: The Daily's advertising policy
states that "Any material having the appear
ance of editorial material may be identified as
'/'aid Advertising' at The Daily's sole discre
tion" Because me advertisement was a full
page, across from the Opinions section — a

space sometimes reserved for special editorial
projects — it was necessary to emphasize that
the advertisement was just that. Furthermore,
the "Feminists for Life" advertisement did not
need to be identified in the same, manner — it
appeared next to other advertisements on a news
page and would not be mistaken for editorial
material produced by The Daily.

'Affirmative action is a means of
addressing institutional racism'
The purpose of affirmative action is
not to judge individuals as Robbie Su
states in his letter (Feb. 18), but rather, it
is a policy treated to address the inequali
ties in American society. Let us not con
fuse a supposedly "racist" policy with the
real disparities in opportunity it rectifies.
At the core of any affirmative action
policy, from additional recruitment ef
forts in underrepresented communities,
to the much maligned use of quotas, is
the recognition that educational in
equalities exist. What is "merit" or a "fair
chance" when access to Advanced Place
ment classes, SA T prep courses and ex
tracurricular activities all depend on
where one lives and by extension, eco
nomic status? For some, the odds are
