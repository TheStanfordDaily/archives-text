# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Support necessary for Israel; transcends faith, nationality 
### MORRIS COHEN AVI YOTAM STANFORD ISRAEL ALLIANCE 
Tuesday's Stanford Daily fea
tured a full-page advertisement
containing the names of more
than 1,500 Stanford students.
These students willingly signed a petition
supporting Israel's right to a peaceful and
secure future and condemning worldwide
terrorism.
Many students, when signing the peti
tion, asked "I agree with this, but why are
you bothering to do this right now?" Any
one who follows the events in the Middle
East knows that this is a very chaotic time
for the whole region. Whatever happens,
it is imperative that we, as Americans or as
students in America, stand up for the val
ues we believe in: freedom, democracy
and peace.
The people of the Middle East deserve
a fair voice in their government. They de
serve civil rights for people of different re

ligions and ethnicities. They deserve a fair
chance to improve their lives.
There is one country in the entire re
gion that stands for these democratic prin
ciples: Israel. And today, many Stanford
students join students from dozens of uni
versities across the country in declaring,
loud and clear, "We stand for Israel, and
we stand for peace!" Never will we allow
the Middle East's only democratic state to
fall at the hands of those who wish little
more than its total destruction.
It's also important to understand
what this petition is not about. It does not
endorse a particular American or Israeli
government. It does not endorse a spe
cific political resolution. It does not en
dorse war in Iraq, an unrelated issue. It
simply endorses the notion that two par
ties, when genuinely interested in a con
structive peace, can reach that goal and
that Israel is ready and waiting fora part
ner. This peace by definition must in
clude a secure Israel and a productive

U.S.-Israel relationship. It does not in
clude terrorism.
A wide variety of campus group leaders
have signed this petition — not necessar
ily as a group endorsement of the petition,
but as individuals — including leaders of
the Campus Democrats, College Republi
cans, Stanford Review, Stanford Progres
sive, ASSU, Stanford Civil Liberties
Union, Greek life and more.
Support for Israel is not a conservative
issue or a liberal issue. It is not a Jewish
issue. That is why our Congress, by an in
credibly overwhelming margin, has re
peatedly stated America's desire to work
with leaders in the region to make sure Is
rael's security is guaranteed, so the region
can move closer to peace.
Supporting Israel is the one positive
way to support peace in the region. The
next time you hear someone harshly criti
cizing Israel, stop and think. What are
they trying to accomplish? Destruction or
construction? While we believe the bulk of

Israel's neighbors have remained preoc
cupied with one thing — destroying Israel
— advocates of Israel are focused on con
structing peace and constructing free
democracy. Israel, being a democracy, has
a wide variety of opinions, but all agree on
the power of building, not destroying, as
the path to peace.
Consider the fact that Israel has been
forced to fight numerous wars, has been
isolated by all its neighbors, has had to ab
sorb millions of refugees, and yet despite
this, in a span of 55 years, Israelis have
built their beloved country from the ashes,
into a place where desert becomes forest,
where technology and scientific research
thrive, with a world-renowned symphony
orchestra, where there exists the region's
most progressive women's rights and sex
ual freedom, political and religious free
dom and multiethnic representation in
Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. Ironically,
Israel is one of the only countries in the
Middle East where an Arab woman can

vote.
The petition concludes with the line
"We share the desire for peace and pros
perity for all peoples of the Middle East."
The importance of this line cannot be
overemphasized. The success Israel has
had can easily be extended. We feel that a
productive U.S.-Israel relationship is die
absolute best way to demonstrate to the
entire region that even in those countries
where dictators rule the land and eco
nomic growth is stilled there is a model for
success. A model for democracy. A model
for peace. Israel. We pray for the day that
all peoples of the Middle East find their
way to hope and peace, instead of anger
and devastation.
Let's build peace through construction,
not destruction.
