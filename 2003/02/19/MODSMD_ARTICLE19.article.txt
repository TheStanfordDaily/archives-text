It took two tries, but before the weekend was over,
Don Shaw had vic tory number 500 of his collegiate
head coaching career under his belt.
"[5OO wins] is nice, but really, the more wins you ac
cumulate just means the older you've gotten and the
longer you've been around," Shaw said. "It'sjust nice
to have a career that long."

Friday: No. 6 Long Beach State def. No. 7 Stanford 27-30,

Stanford def. UC-San Diego 30-24, 34-32, 31-33, 30-24

The Stanford men's volleyball team (7-7, 5-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) split matches
this weekend with No. 6 Long Beach State (8-6, 4-5
MPSF) and UC-San Diego (3-10, 0-9 MPSF).
The Cardinal fell 3-1 to Long Beach on Friday
night and topped UCSD by the same score on Satur
day.
"I'm just happy we were able to get a split out of the
weekend," Shaw said. "I was still frustrated and dis
appointed after [Friday] night's match. It was a tough
loss and I'm glad we were able to bounce back like we
did."
The Cardinal got off to a quick start on Friday
night with a 30-27 victory in game one of the match.
But the match took a turn Long Beach's way in the
second game on a bizarre point.
"We were pretty ahead in game two," Shaw said.

"We had blocked a ball and it bounced off of one of
their guys' feet and we started celebrating and the ref
never blew the whistle and they ended up winning
that rally and it seemed that after that they played
with more confidence."
After that point, Long Beach won the second game
32-30 to even the match and then never looked back.
"I think [that play] really sparked Long Beach,"
Shaw said. "We didn't respond to them upping their
level of play."
In the loss, senior middle blocker Billy Strickland
and senior opposite hitter Will Curtis led Stanford
with 17 kills apiece. Sophomore setter Kevin Hansen
was the high-man for assists, finishing with 62.
The Cardinal came back strong on Saturday night
with a convincing 30-24 game one win against the
Tritons.
Stanford kept the pressure on UCSI) throughout
the match to come away with the four game win (30-
24, 34-32,31-33,30-24).
" I think our blocking was really on tonight," Strick
land said. "It was our game plan to get on Jim Waller
and I think we did a pretty good job of that, I think we
kept him below his season percentage. We slowed
down their middles enough to stay competitive."
The Cardinal held the Tritons'junior opposite hit
ter Waller to a 0.125 hitting percentage, but he still
finished the match with 23 kills.
"We did a really good job defensively tonight,"
Shaw said. "We played well against a scrappy team.
UCSD's really going to make you earn all your points."
