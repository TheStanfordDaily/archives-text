# Bookstore double-bills many customers
## Students face additional financial difficulties due to computer errors 
### SAMEER AHMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, the Stanford Bookstore
acknowledged that it accidentally
charged customers twice for purchases
made with credit or debit cards on Jan.
7, a day when hundreds of students pur
chased their winter quarter textbooks
from the Bookstore.
Most of those affected received the

initial charge soon atter Jan. 7 and the
second charge sometime last week.
According to a press release, the
Bookstore is taking steps to reverse the
incorrect charges, which resulted from a
computer error. Nonetheless, many stu
dents who were double-charged faced
additional financial difficulties over the
weekend, including overdraft fees,
which will not be automatically reversed
by any action the Bookstore takes.
David Peterson, director of stores at
the Bookstore, stated that customers
who paid with Visa or MasterCard
should have had their second charges al
ready reversed in their bank accounts.
Customers who used Discover, Aineri

can Express or other credit or debit
cards should see the changes within a
few days.
"A problem with the Bookstore's
computer software caused the double
billing," Peterson said. "In the computer
system that we have, the switch didn't
flip for the transactions [on Jan. 7]. We
have since fixed the problem."
While he could not say for certain, Pe
terson did not think the computer error
affected every customer who paid with a
credit or debit card on Jan. 7.
Many students began noticing the
problem this past weekend, thanks in

part to a mass e-mail sent out by
sophomore Melissa Burns.
"On Friday, 1 checked my on
line statement and noticed a sec
ond charge from the Bookstore
identical to a charge I made in
early January," Burns said. "I
then asked a friend about it, and
he said the same thing happened
to him."
Burns then sent an e-mail out
to a few dorm lists about the issue,
and within hours, over 50 stu
dents had responded to her that
they had been double-charged.
Burns estimates that the dou
ble-charging could affect hun
dreds or even thousands of Book
store customers.
"I researched that, on a busy
day, the Bookstore receives about
6,500 transactions per day and
that 58 percent of their transac
tions are by credit or debit card,"
she said. "So this could affect thou
sands of us. And it probably affect
ed around $100,000."
Many students were also con
cerned by the way the Bookstore
staff responded to the problem.
"The Bookstore staff was really
unhelpful," said Burns, who went
to the Bookstore on Sunday
morning. "The people at the
Bookstore were aware of the situ
ation, but what struck me as really
odd is that no one would take re
sponsibility for it. They kept say
ing I had to talk to their 'head
honcho,' and he wasn't there. It
was very disorganized and unpro
fessional."
Junior Andres Restrepo was
also upset that the Bookstore's
upper-management wasn't avail
able this weekend to answer his
questions about the double
charges.
"I think it's egregiously unpro
fessional and irresponsible of the
director [of the Bookstore] to kick
back and enjoy his three-day
weekend while thousands of his
customers are struggling to find
money to pay for double charges
and overdraft fees," he said. "He
should have been at the store all
weekend, working on a way to
solve the problem and to inform
the campus of this error, or al least

remaining at the store in case peo
ple wanted to talk to him about the
problem."
According to Peterson, the
Bookstore addressed the problem
to the best of its abilities.
"As soon as the Bookstore re
ceived notification, immediate ac
tion was taken to rectify the situa
tion," he said. "We have let people
know [about the problem] when
they come into the store. And the
next step is sending out a press re
lease, which we did also. We will
also have a copy of the press re
lease at Customer Service."
The double-charging has had
serious financial effects on many
students.

When Restrepo went to the
Wells Fargo bank Friday after
noon to deposit his paycheck, the
bank informed him that his ac
count was at negative $210 be
cause of the Bookstore's double
charge and the accompanying
overdraft fee.
Sophomore Malcolm Murdock
found out that his checking ac
count was empty and had to get a
cash advance on his credit card to
get money out of the ATM.
"I was charged a total of $28 by
my bank [for having insufficient
funds in my account] and then an
other $20 fora returned check,"
added sophomore Sam Deputy.
" The whole affair was really frus

trating."
Peterson said that the Book
store is willing to assist any cus
tomer that has been affected fi
nancially because of the error, in
cluding those who have had to pay
overdraft fees; customers can e
mail the Bookstore at
stanford@bkstr.com with con
cerns about overdraft fees or
other financial issues.
Some students think the Book
store should do more to resolve
the situation.
"It'd be nice if the Bookstore
would give us a big discount the
next time we buy their ridiculous
ly overpriced books," Murdock
said. "It's the least they could do to
apologize for all this confusion."
The double-charging error
resembles a similar incident that
occurred in September 1998,
when the Bookstore double
charged around 400 customers
but did not notify them of the
mistake. Alter a police investiga
tion, the Bookstore eventually
reached a negotiated settlement
with the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney. The settlement
called for the Bookstore to re
verse all incorrect credit card
charges and to pay $10,000 to
the University.
"[The September 1998] prob
lem occurred under different
management," Peterson said.
"When that problem occurred,
the Bookstore didn't do anything
proactively. This time we took ac
tion immediately to correct the
error. That's the difference."
According to Peterson, the
Bookstore has not been contacted
by the police regarding the issue.
Both the Stanford Police De
partment and Dean of Students
Marc Wais were unaware of the
problem.
Some students believe the po
lice and the University should get
involved in the issue.
"I think there is a definite prob
lem with how this situation is
being resolved," said junior Matt
Sorlien. "Somebody, the police
and the University, needs to gel
involved, at least to let the man
agers of the Bookstore realize that
just because they are operating on
a college campus doesn't mean
they can screw with people and
then take there time in giving my
money back."

Junior Andres Restrepo was
also upset that the Bookstore's
upper-management wasn't avail
able this weekend to answer his
questions about the double
charges.
"I think it's egregiously unpro
fessional and irresponsible of the
director [of the Bookstore] to kick
back and enjoy his three-day
weekend while thousands of his
customers are struggling to find
money to pay for double charges
and overdraft fees," he said. "He
should have been at the store all
weekend, working on a way to
solve the problem and to inform
the campus of this error, or al least

remaining at the store in case peo
ple wanted to talk to him about the
problem."
According to Peterson, the
Bookstore addressed the problem
to the best of its abilities.
"As soon as the Bookstore re
ceived notification, immediate ac
tion was taken to rectify the situa
tion," he said. "We have let people
know [about the problem] when
they come into the store. And the
next step is sending out a press re
lease, which we did also. We will
also have a copy of the press re
lease at Customer Service."
The double-charging has had
serious financial effects on many
students.

When Restrepo went to the
Wells Fargo bank Friday after
noon to deposit his paycheck, the
bank informed him that his ac
count was at negative $210 be
cause of the Bookstore's double
charge and the accompanying
overdraft fee.
Sophomore Malcolm Murdock
found out that his checking ac
count was empty and had to get a
cash advance on his credit card to
get money out of the ATM.
"I was charged a total of $28 by
my bank [for having insufficient
funds in my account] and then an
other $20 fora returned check,"
added sophomore Sam Deputy.
" The whole affair was really frus

trating."
Peterson said that the Book
store is willing to assist any cus
tomer that has been affected fi
nancially because of the error, in
cluding those who have had to pay
overdraft fees; customers can e
mail the Bookstore at
stanford@bkstr.com with con
cerns about overdraft fees or
other financial issues.
Some students think the Book
store should do more to resolve
the situation.
"It'd be nice if the Bookstore
would give us a big discount the
next time we buy their ridiculous
ly overpriced books," Murdock
said. "It's the least they could do to
apologize for all this confusion."
The double-charging error
resembles a similar incident that
occurred in September 1998,
when the Bookstore double
charged around 400 customers
but did not notify them of the
mistake. Alter a police investiga
tion, the Bookstore eventually
reached a negotiated settlement
with the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney. The settlement
called for the Bookstore to re
verse all incorrect credit card
charges and to pay $10,000 to
the University.
"[The September 1998] prob
lem occurred under different
management," Peterson said.
"When that problem occurred,
the Bookstore didn't do anything
proactively. This time we took ac
tion immediately to correct the
error. That's the difference."
According to Peterson, the
Bookstore has not been contacted
by the police regarding the issue.
Both the Stanford Police De
partment and Dean of Students
Marc Wais were unaware of the
problem.
Some students believe the po
lice and the University should get
involved in the issue.
"I think there is a definite prob
lem with how this situation is
being resolved," said junior Matt
Sorlien. "Somebody, the police
and the University, needs to gel
involved, at least to let the man
agers of the Bookstore realize that
just because they are operating on
a college campus doesn't mean
they can screw with people and
then take there time in giving my
money back."

Many customers who purchased items with a credit and debit card on Jan. 7
were double-billed due to a computer error. The Bookstore staff said that the
charges have been reversed for almost all affected accounts.
Yesterday, the Stanford Bookstore
acknowledged that it accidentally
charged customers twice for purchases
made with credit or debit cards on Jan.
7, a day when hundreds of students pur
chased their winter quarter textbooks
from the Bookstore.
Most of those affected received the

initial charge soon atter Jan. 7 and the
second charge sometime last week.
According to a press release, the
Bookstore is taking steps to reverse the
incorrect charges, which resulted from a
computer error. Nonetheless, many stu
dents who were double-charged faced
additional financial difficulties over the
weekend, including overdraft fees,
which will not be automatically reversed
by any action the Bookstore takes.
David Peterson, director of stores at
the Bookstore, stated that customers
who paid with Visa or MasterCard
should have had their second charges al
ready reversed in their bank accounts.
Customers who used Discover, Aineri

can Express or other credit or debit
cards should see the changes within a
few days.
"A problem with the Bookstore's
computer software caused the double
billing," Peterson said. "In the computer
system that we have, the switch didn't
flip for the transactions [on Jan. 7]. We
have since fixed the problem."
While he could not say for certain, Pe
terson did not think the computer error
affected every customer who paid with a
credit or debit card on Jan. 7.
Many students began noticing the
problem this past weekend, thanks in

part to a mass e-mail sent out by
sophomore Melissa Burns.
"On Friday, 1 checked my on
line statement and noticed a sec
ond charge from the Bookstore
identical to a charge I made in
early January," Burns said. "I
then asked a friend about it, and
he said the same thing happened
to him."
Burns then sent an e-mail out
to a few dorm lists about the issue,
and within hours, over 50 stu
dents had responded to her that
they had been double-charged.
Burns estimates that the dou
ble-charging could affect hun
dreds or even thousands of Book
store customers.
"I researched that, on a busy
day, the Bookstore receives about
6,500 transactions per day and
that 58 percent of their transac
tions are by credit or debit card,"
she said. "So this could affect thou
sands of us. And it probably affect
ed around $100,000."
Many students were also con
cerned by the way the Bookstore
staff responded to the problem.
"The Bookstore staff was really
unhelpful," said Burns, who went
to the Bookstore on Sunday
morning. "The people at the
Bookstore were aware of the situ
ation, but what struck me as really
odd is that no one would take re
sponsibility for it. They kept say
ing I had to talk to their 'head
honcho,' and he wasn't there. It
was very disorganized and unpro
