# Bookstore double-bills many customers
## Students face additional financial difficulties due to computer errors 
### SAMEER AHMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, the Stanford Bookstore
acknowledged that it accidentally
charged customers twice for purchases
made with credit or debit cards on Jan.
7, a day when hundreds of students pur
chased their winter quarter textbooks
from the Bookstore.
Most of those affected received the

initial charge soon atter Jan. 7 and the
second charge sometime last week.
According to a press release, the
Bookstore is taking steps to reverse the
incorrect charges, which resulted from a
computer error. Nonetheless, many stu
dents who were double-charged faced
additional financial difficulties over the
weekend, including overdraft fees,
which will not be automatically reversed
by any action the Bookstore takes.
David Peterson, director of stores at
the Bookstore, stated that customers
who paid with Visa or MasterCard
should have had their second charges al
ready reversed in their bank accounts.
Customers who used Discover, Aineri

can Express or other credit or debit
cards should see the changes within a
few days.
"A problem with the Bookstore's
computer software caused the double
billing," Peterson said. "In the computer
system that we have, the switch didn't
flip for the transactions [on Jan. 7]. We
have since fixed the problem."
While he could not say for certain, Pe
terson did not think the computer error
affected every customer who paid with a
credit or debit card on Jan. 7.
Many students began noticing the
problem this past weekend, thanks in
