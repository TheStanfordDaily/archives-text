# Sub-par performance on Big Island
## Slow start dooms men 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After almost three months of
preparation and offseason train
ing, this was not the way the Stan
ford men's golf team wanted to
begin its spring season.
Participating in the 13th annu
al Taylor Made/Waikoloa Inter
collegiate, the Cardinal played 54
holes during the three-day event,
which wrapped up on Friday. Un
fortunately, the team's 21-over
par 877 for the tournament was
only good enough to net a 21st
place finish in the field of 26. Pacif
ic-10 Conference rival UCLA took
top team honors, firing a 20-
under-par 836.
Hawaii has not been kind to the
Cardinal. Last year's event saw the
team stage a meteoric drop from
the top of the leaderboard, even
tually finishing in 11th place over
all. The Cardinal carded the worst
team round of the tournament on
the final day and fell swiftly out of
contention.
Yet, there was still cause for op
timism coming into this year's
event. Last year's disaster did not
include senior Ron Won, who has
been one of this season's most im
portant contributors.
Furthermore, senior Jim Seki,
who struggled on the Big Island
last year, has reached new heights
during the current campaign and
brought a No. 11 ranking into this
event.
Finally, sophomore Kevin Blue
was returning to the site of his ca
reer-low 69 in last year's opening
round.
However, fate seemed once

again to conspire against the Cardi
nal. Though the event has tradi
tionally been played on the
Waikoloa Kings' Course, the large
size of this year's field forced teams
to split time between the Kings' and
its sister track, the Beach Course.
"We played a practice round,
but I don't think we were able to
really get to know the [Beach
Course] well enough," coach Jeff
Mitchell said. "This is mostly our
own fault. It takes confidence to
perform. If you aren't positive
about your club and your decision,
it is difficult to make a good
swing."
The Cardinal was once again
hampered by a slow start, a prob
lem that has gradually developed
into a theme this season.
A 13-over-par 301 in the open
ing round instantly threw the team
into catch-up mode. Although the
Stanford men grew stronger as the
tournament progressed, they had
already spotted the top teams
more than 30 strokes after the first
two rounds.
Although he recorded his worst
finish of the year (and his first out
of the top 10), Seki still led the
team, carding a 2-under-par 212
for the event, good enough to tie
him for 16th place individually.
Much like Mitchell, Seki point
ed the finger at a lack of prepara
tion:
"A few of us had played there
previously, so we knew what to ex
pect, yet we still played far below
how we should have. That shows
that we're not doing the correct
things in preparation."

Sophomore Kevin Blue and the Stanford golf team finished 21 st at the Tay
lor Made/Waikoloa Intercollegiate in Kona, Hawii last weekend.
Fellow senior George Down
ing epitomized the slow-start
phenomenon. Downing strug
gled through the first round at
the Kings' Course, shooting a 6-
over-par 78. He then came back
strong, turning in two consecu
tive season-low rounds with back
to-back 70s. Unfortunately, he
was only able to move up to 54th
place overall.
Perhaps the biggest surprise
was the play of Won. After being
the model of consistency during
the fall, Won got off to a rough
start in Hawaii and never recov
ered. An opening round of 79 set
the tone fora difficult week, Won
finished the event at 12 over par,
tied for 98th place.
Sophomores Fat Phillips and
Blue did not fare much better.
Blue played steadily, but was
never able to turn in a spectacular
round, finishing tied for 75th
place at 8 over par. Phillips, on the

other hand, seemed to have the
most trouble on the Beach, shoot
ing a 6-over-par 76 en route to a tie
for 115 th place.
While the Cardinal looked lost
in unfamiliar territory, UCLA ap
peared right at home. The Bruins,
ranked No. 9 in the latest
Sagarin/Golfweek poll, will likely
jump in the rankings after a su
perb performance in which they
edged No. 3 Texas Christian by
just two strokes.
Although the key to UCLA's
victory was consistency, the story
of the week was the team's most in
consistent player. Alter firing a
lackluster 77 in his opening
round, junior Roy Moon turned
around and lit up the Beach
Course on Thursday, shooting an
8-under-par 62, the low round of
the tournament and the best of
Moon's career.
Despite this discouraging re
sult, Seki sees no reason to panic.
"What we do have in our favor
is that there is a tomorrow," Seki
said. "We do have that opportuni
ty, but we have to take advantage
of it and turn it around."

ing a 6-over-par 76 en route to a tie
for 115 th place.
While the Cardinal looked lost
in unfamiliar territory, UCLA ap
peared right at home. The Bruins,
ranked No. 9 in the latest
Sagarin/Golfweek poll, will likely
jump in the rankings after a su
perb performance in which they
edged No. 3 Texas Christian by
just two strokes.
Although the key to UCLA's
victory was consistency, the story
of the week was the team's most in
consistent player. Alter firing a
lackluster 77 in his opening
round, junior Roy Moon turned
around and lit up the Beach
Course on Thursday, shooting an
8-under-par 62, the low round of
the tournament and the best of
Moon's career.
Despite this discouraging re
sult, Seki sees no reason to panic.
"What we do have in our favor
is that there is a tomorrow," Seki
said. "We do have that opportuni
ty, but we have to take advantage
of it and turn it around."
After almost three months of
preparation and offseason train
ing, this was not the way the Stan
ford men's golf team wanted to
begin its spring season.
Participating in the 13th annu
al Taylor Made/Waikoloa Inter
collegiate, the Cardinal played 54
holes during the three-day event,
which wrapped up on Friday. Un
fortunately, the team's 21-over
par 877 for the tournament was
only good enough to net a 21st
place finish in the field of 26. Pacif
ic-10 Conference rival UCLA took
top team honors, firing a 20-
under-par 836.
Hawaii has not been kind to the
Cardinal. Last year's event saw the
team stage a meteoric drop from
the top of the leaderboard, even
tually finishing in 11th place over
all. The Cardinal carded the worst
team round of the tournament on
the final day and fell swiftly out of
contention.
Yet, there was still cause for op
timism coming into this year's
event. Last year's disaster did not
include senior Ron Won, who has
been one of this season's most im
portant contributors.
Furthermore, senior Jim Seki,
who struggled on the Big Island
last year, has reached new heights
during the current campaign and
brought a No. 11 ranking into this
event.
Finally, sophomore Kevin Blue
was returning to the site of his ca
reer-low 69 in last year's opening
round.
However, fate seemed once

again to conspire against the Cardi
nal. Though the event has tradi
tionally been played on the
Waikoloa Kings' Course, the large
size of this year's field forced teams
to split time between the Kings' and
its sister track, the Beach Course.
"We played a practice round,
but I don't think we were able to
really get to know the [Beach
Course] well enough," coach Jeff
Mitchell said. "This is mostly our
own fault. It takes confidence to
perform. If you aren't positive
about your club and your decision,
it is difficult to make a good
swing."
The Cardinal was once again
hampered by a slow start, a prob
lem that has gradually developed
into a theme this season.
A 13-over-par 301 in the open
ing round instantly threw the team
into catch-up mode. Although the
Stanford men grew stronger as the
tournament progressed, they had
already spotted the top teams
more than 30 strokes after the first
two rounds.
Although he recorded his worst
finish of the year (and his first out
of the top 10), Seki still led the
team, carding a 2-under-par 212
for the event, good enough to tie
him for 16th place individually.
Much like Mitchell, Seki point
ed the finger at a lack of prepara
tion:
"A few of us had played there
previously, so we knew what to ex
pect, yet we still played far below
how we should have. That shows
that we're not doing the correct
things in preparation."

Sophomore Kevin Blue and the Stanford golf team finished 21 st at the Tay
lor Made/Waikoloa Intercollegiate in Kona, Hawii last weekend.
Fellow senior George Down
ing epitomized the slow-start
phenomenon. Downing strug
gled through the first round at
the Kings' Course, shooting a 6-
over-par 78. He then came back
strong, turning in two consecu
tive season-low rounds with back
to-back 70s. Unfortunately, he
was only able to move up to 54th
place overall.
Perhaps the biggest surprise
was the play of Won. After being
the model of consistency during
the fall, Won got off to a rough
start in Hawaii and never recov
ered. An opening round of 79 set
the tone fora difficult week, Won
finished the event at 12 over par,
tied for 98th place.
Sophomores Fat Phillips and
Blue did not fare much better.
Blue played steadily, but was
never able to turn in a spectacular
round, finishing tied for 75th
place at 8 over par. Phillips, on the

other hand, seemed to have the
most trouble on the Beach, shoot
ing a 6-over-par 76 en route to a tie
for 115 th place.
