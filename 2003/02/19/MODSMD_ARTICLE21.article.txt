### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Friday night's 24-11 loss to UC-Davis
at Burnham Pavilion didn't sit well with
the Stanford wrestling team, as the Car
dinal closed its regular season out at
home two nights later with an inspired
performance against heavily favored
Fresno State.

WRESTUNG
Friday: UC-Davis 24, Stanford 11
Sunday: Fresno State 16, Stanford 15

While its bid for an upset fell just short
in a 16-15 loss to the Bulldogs, Stanford
(3-12, 1-6 Pacific-10 Conference) came
away with increased confidence heading
into the Pac-10 Championships to be
held March 2 and 3 in Boise, Idaho.
"Anytime you can come off of an ugly
loss against a much better team, you
have to feel good about that," coach
Steve Buddie said. "I think our guys
made some mental adjustments tonight

that they weren't making on Friday
night. At this level, everyone's training
the same, so the psychological edge is re
ally the difference."
While the bright spots from Friday's
loss to the Aggies were few and far be
tween, redshirt freshman Larry
Ozowara tallied the first dual meet win of
his career while Stanford's lone senior,
Harold Penson and redshirt sophomore
Matt Gentry earned wins as well.
Fresno State (13-4) came to Stanford
winners of nine straight dual meets, the
most recent coming earlier in the day
against No. 10 Arizona State.
The streak appeared in jeopardy in
the early going as Cardinal junior
Nathan Peterson recorded a near fall to
jump out to a 5-1 lead after two periods
in the first match of the evening. Peter
son won the bout 8-3, bringing his sea
son victory total to 16.
Redshirt sophomore Brad Metzler,
who returned to action from injury, split
his two matches this weekend. The tri
captain lost to nationally ranked Urijah

Faber 9-3 on Friday before scoring a 4-0
win over Fresno State's Joe Stuart at 133
to give Stanford a 6-0 lead.
At 141, junior Brendon Fox main
tained the Stanford momentum in one
of the most exciting matches of the week
end. Trailing 2-0 after an early take
down, Fox rebounded to knot the score
at 2-2 in the final period and earn a take
down of his own for the 4-2 decision.
"I am excited to get the win because I
have been having a very rough year,"
Fox said. "In the last couple weeks I feel
like I have been improving by leaps and
bounds so to get that win was important
to build a little momentum for the Pac
-10s."
The Cardinal dropped its first match
of the evening at 149, as sophomore
Scott I'olley's best efforts fora comeback
victory were thwarted by the Bulldogs'
Casey Olson in a 5-3 decision.
The marquee matchup of the night
came at 157, with Gentry squaring off


MATT SAYIES/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Matt Gentry avenged a loss to Fresno State's Jim Medeiros earlier in the season with
a 6-4 decision in the Cardinal's 16-15 loss to the Bulldogs at Burnham Pavilion on Sunday.
against Jim Medeiros. Medeiros, a
30-match winner defeated Gentry
12-4 at the All Cal Invitational ear
lier this month. In the rematch,
Gentry seized a 5-1 lead and held
off Medeiros for the 6-4 decision.
"It was sweet revenge getting to
beat him after losing two weeks
ago," Gentry said. "Losing to him
was really frustrating because I
had beaten him four times last sea
son, so I was hungry for the win
tonight."
Coupled with his major decision

victory against UC-Davis, Gentry
improved his dual meet winning
streak to 12 matches, which will
carry over into next season.
At 184, Penson scored five take
downs en route to an 11-3 major
decision over UC-Davis' Bryan
Bachar on Friday night and was
poised to go out in style in his final
match in front of the home fans on
Sunday.
The four-year starter wasted no
time in taking control of the match,
putting Fresno State's Sean Sheets
on his back and recording a near
fall less than 10 seconds into the
first period. Penson would record
another near fall in the frame and
led 7-0 before Sheets scored a sin

gle point.
Sheets made things interesting,
getting as close as 8-6 with an es
cape in the second period but Pen
son recorded another takedown
and earned a point for riding time
in an 11-7 victory.
Penson's win put Stanford up
15-6 with three bouts to go, but the
Bulldogs would deny the Cardi
nal's upset bid with wins at 184,
197 and 285 pounds.
Even in defeat, the Cardinal
made great strides on Stinday.
After being pinned by their respec
tive Fresno State opponents in less
than a minute at the All Cal,
Ozowara hung tough in a 14-5 de
feat and Ritzenthaler dropped a

narrow 5-2 decision to close the
meet.
"They're young guys who are
still learning and they're making
improvements every single time
they hit the mat, which is very im
portant to me," Buddie said. "It's
been a frustrating year, both for
me and for the guys. I think we're
finally turning some corners."
Despite the loss, Fox and Gen
try agreed it was a positive perfor
mance to build off of in the next
two weeks.
"I think that losing the dual
wasn't as important as the mood of
the team," Fox said. "We were out
wrestling hard trying to make
things happen and it showed."
