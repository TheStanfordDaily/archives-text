# Turning to sports in trying times
## 
### 
We're about to in
vade Iraq, North
Korea's a mess,
the terror alert
has been raised to its highest
level yet and a space shuttle ex
ploded not too long ago, killing
seven heroes of the utmost
character. And what am I wor-

ried about
most: whether
Louisville cov
ered the spread
against Mar
quette and if
Tim Duncan
grabbed
enough re
bounds to vault

me into first place in my frater
nity's fantasy basketball league.
I am pathetic.
A couple days ago, I was
talking with a friend and we
couldn't help but get to the
sheer gravity of today's "cur
rent events." Sure, there have
always been tragedies occur
ring somewhere in the world
and major political decisions
have been made every single
day of our lives. But I seriously
don't think that there has ever
been a time during our gener
ation when so many things of
such consequence have been
taking place at the same time.
So why was I sitting around
all weekend watching college
basketball, arena football, the
World Series of Poker, profes
sional bowling, the Westminster

Dog Show and whatever other
"sports programming" our
great networks had to offer?
Is there something specifi
cally wrong with me, or did
most people watch highlights
of Kobe Bryant dropping 51 on
the Nuggets instead of Colin
Powell outlining key American
policy on "Meet the Press?"
Is Stuart Scott that much
more entertaining than Wolf
Blitzer? If Wolf said, "The U.N.
just passed Resolution 1441.
Booyah!", would I watch more
CNN and less Sportscenter?
Why do I care so much
about whether Trista is going
to pick Charlie or Ryan
tonight? (In case you're won
dering, it's only a matter of
time before "competitive dat
ing" supplants hockey as the
fourth major sport in America,
so any talk about "The Bache
lorette," "Elimadate" or "Dis
missed" is fully allowed under
the heading of sportswriting.)
If the Department of
Homeland Security outlined
terror alerts in a captivating
rose ceremony, would I turn
off the "Andl Streetball Tour"
in favor of Fox News?
Do I ignore reports about
Hans Blix just because he can't
throw a fastball 95 miles per
hour? Is the search for the
"smoking gun" simply not as
important as the 49ers' quest

1 am in class something like 15
hours a week, I write this oh-so
meaningful column once a week
and I play way too many hours of
beer pong for my liver to ade
quately handle. Outside of those
time commitments, it is pretty
clear that I dedicate way too much
of my time to the world of sports.
I consider myself a pretty intel
ligent person but stepping back
now to look at myself from afar, I
really can't understand how my
constant attention to espn.com
does me any good. In 10 years,
will I really care whether Bracke
tology had Texas as the No. 1
seed in the East rather than a No.
2 seed in the South?
Over the years, if I were to
have otherwise used all of the
brainpower that I wasted on
meaningless statistics, sports
records and trivia questions, I
honestly think I could have
found a cure for cancer or some
thing of the sort.
I follow the Mets, Giants and
Knicks with a fanatical zeal that
Zacarias Moussaoui would be
jealous of, I've studied the
spreads of NFL games for count
less more hours than I have ever
put in for an econ exam and I
can rally for kegs and eggs before
a football game anytime but can't
consistently get up for my 9 a.m.
class if my life depended on it.
Is this normal? Am I a freak?
On second thought, don't an
swer that.
I've pretty much been ob
sessed with sports ever since I
can remember. The first song I
ever learned was "Meet the
Mets" and I basically learned

how to read by checking boxs
cores. Even my first real memory
is of sports: being at a Met game
when my hero Lenny Dykstra hit
a walk-oft home run.
So what has now made me
want to grapple with this issue?' 1
I honestly do think that there
is more going on in the world
right now than at any other point
in my life. Or at least, the serious
stuff is more "in your face." Un
like in most countries, our gener
ation in America has never even
seen a real war before. War and
terrorism has been an everyday
reality for millions of people
throughout the generations, but
maybe when it hits your country
and, in my case, your city, it
serves as a little bit of a wakeup
call. Or maybe it's just the simple
process of growing up, maturing
and realizing that there's more
to life than a last-second field
goal or a killer changeup.
I mean, 1 don't still collect
baseball cards or play make-be
lieve sporting events around
the house (I swear). So I have
already progressed in some
sense.
But I think it's pretty safe to
say that I've still got a way to go.
I'd love to psychoanalyze my
self some more on paper for
every one of my readers to see,
but for the sake of my already
damaged pride, I'm going to stop
here.
Plus, ESPN2 is about to replay
one of Leßron James' high
school games and Trista just
went on "Access Hollywood."
Maybe I'll just watch one in
stead of switching back and
forth. See, I'm improving al
ready.

CNN and less Sportscenter?
Why do I care so much
about whether Trista is going
to pick Charlie or Ryan
tonight? (In case you're won
dering, it's only a matter of
time before "competitive dat
ing" supplants hockey as the
fourth major sport in America,
so any talk about "The Bache
lorette," "Elimadate" or "Dis
missed" is fully allowed under
the heading of sportswriting.)
If the Department of
Homeland Security outlined
terror alerts in a captivating
rose ceremony, would I turn
off the "Andl Streetball Tour"
in favor of Fox News?
Do I ignore reports about
Hans Blix just because he can't
throw a fastball 95 miles per
hour? Is the search for the
"smoking gun" simply not as
important as the 49ers' quest

1 am in class something like 15
hours a week, I write this oh-so
meaningful column once a week
and I play way too many hours of
beer pong for my liver to ade
quately handle. Outside of those
time commitments, it is pretty
clear that I dedicate way too much
of my time to the world of sports.
I consider myself a pretty intel
ligent person but stepping back
now to look at myself from afar, I
really can't understand how my
constant attention to espn.com
does me any good. In 10 years,
will I really care whether Bracke
tology had Texas as the No. 1
seed in the East rather than a No.
2 seed in the South?
Over the years, if I were to
have otherwise used all of the
brainpower that I wasted on
meaningless statistics, sports
records and trivia questions, I
honestly think I could have
found a cure for cancer or some
thing of the sort.
I follow the Mets, Giants and
Knicks with a fanatical zeal that
Zacarias Moussaoui would be
jealous of, I've studied the
spreads of NFL games for count
less more hours than I have ever
put in for an econ exam and I
can rally for kegs and eggs before
a football game anytime but can't
consistently get up for my 9 a.m.
class if my life depended on it.
Is this normal? Am I a freak?
On second thought, don't an
swer that.
I've pretty much been ob
sessed with sports ever since I
can remember. The first song I
ever learned was "Meet the
Mets" and I basically learned

how to read by checking boxs
cores. Even my first real memory
is of sports: being at a Met game
when my hero Lenny Dykstra hit
a walk-oft home run.
So what has now made me
want to grapple with this issue?' 1
I honestly do think that there
is more going on in the world
right now than at any other point
in my life. Or at least, the serious
stuff is more "in your face." Un
like in most countries, our gener
ation in America has never even
seen a real war before. War and
terrorism has been an everyday
reality for millions of people
throughout the generations, but
maybe when it hits your country
and, in my case, your city, it
serves as a little bit of a wakeup
call. Or maybe it's just the simple
process of growing up, maturing
and realizing that there's more
to life than a last-second field
goal or a killer changeup.
I mean, 1 don't still collect
baseball cards or play make-be
lieve sporting events around
the house (I swear). So I have
already progressed in some
sense.
But I think it's pretty safe to
say that I've still got a way to go.
I'd love to psychoanalyze my
self some more on paper for
every one of my readers to see,
but for the sake of my already
damaged pride, I'm going to stop
here.
Plus, ESPN2 is about to replay
one of Leßron James' high
school games and Trista just
went on "Access Hollywood."
Maybe I'll just watch one in
stead of switching back and
forth. See, I'm improving al
ready.

We're about to in
vade Iraq, North
Korea's a mess,
the terror alert
has been raised to its highest
level yet and a space shuttle ex
ploded not too long ago, killing
seven heroes of the utmost
character. And what am I wor-

ried about
most: whether
Louisville cov
ered the spread
against Mar
quette and if
Tim Duncan
grabbed
enough re
bounds to vault

me into first place in my frater
nity's fantasy basketball league.
I am pathetic.
A couple days ago, I was
talking with a friend and we
couldn't help but get to the
sheer gravity of today's "cur
rent events." Sure, there have
always been tragedies occur
ring somewhere in the world
and major political decisions
have been made every single
day of our lives. But I seriously
don't think that there has ever
been a time during our gener
ation when so many things of
such consequence have been
taking place at the same time.
So why was I sitting around
all weekend watching college
basketball, arena football, the
World Series of Poker, profes
sional bowling, the Westminster

Dog Show and whatever other
"sports programming" our
great networks had to offer?
Is there something specifi
cally wrong with me, or did
most people watch highlights
of Kobe Bryant dropping 51 on
the Nuggets instead of Colin
Powell outlining key American
policy on "Meet the Press?"
Is Stuart Scott that much
more entertaining than Wolf
Blitzer? If Wolf said, "The U.N.
just passed Resolution 1441.
Booyah!", would I watch more
CNN and less Sportscenter?
Why do I care so much
about whether Trista is going
to pick Charlie or Ryan
