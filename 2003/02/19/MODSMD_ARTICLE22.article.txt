# Turning to sports in trying times

We're about to in
vade Iraq, North
Korea's a mess,
the terror alert
has been raised to its highest
level yet and a space shuttle ex
ploded not too long ago, killing
seven heroes of the utmost
character. And what am I wor-

ried about
most: whether
Louisville cov
ered the spread
against Mar
quette and if
Tim Duncan
grabbed
enough re
bounds to vault

me into first place in my frater
nity's fantasy basketball league.
I am pathetic.
A couple days ago, I was
talking with a friend and we
couldn't help but get to the
sheer gravity of today's "cur
rent events." Sure, there have
always been tragedies occur
ring somewhere in the world
and major political decisions
have been made every single
day of our lives. But I seriously
don't think that there has ever
been a time during our gener
ation when so many things of
such consequence have been
taking place at the same time.
So why was I sitting around
all weekend watching college
basketball, arena football, the
World Series of Poker, profes
sional bowling, the Westminster

Dog Show and whatever other
"sports programming" our
great networks had to offer?
Is there something specifi
cally wrong with me, or did
most people watch highlights
of Kobe Bryant dropping 51 on
the Nuggets instead of Colin
Powell outlining key American
policy on "Meet the Press?"
Is Stuart Scott that much
more entertaining than Wolf
Blitzer? If Wolf said, "The U.N.
just passed Resolution 1441.
Booyah!", would I watch more
CNN and less Sportscenter?
Why do I care so much
about whether Trista is going
to pick Charlie or Ryan
tonight? (In case you're won
dering, it's only a matter of
time before "competitive dat
ing" supplants hockey as the
fourth major sport in America,
so any talk about "The Bache
lorette," "Elimadate" or "Dis
missed" is fully allowed under
the heading of sportswriting.)
If the Department of
Homeland Security outlined
terror alerts in a captivating
rose ceremony, would I turn
off the "Andl Streetball Tour"
in favor of Fox News?
Do I ignore reports about
Hans Blix just because he can't
throw a fastball 95 miles per
hour? Is the search for the
"smoking gun" simply not as
important as the 49ers' quest
