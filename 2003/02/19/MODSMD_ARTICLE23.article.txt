# Short-handed gymnasts fall to Bears
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The issue of depth confronting the under
manned Stanford men's gymnastics team reared
its ugly 112 lead again as California avenged its early
season loss to the Cardinal at Haas Pavilion in
Berkeley.
Despite the very generous scores given to
both teams by the judges, Stanford (1-1) was un
able to match its season-high score of 212.75,
falling to the Golden Bears 218.175-210.850.

"Some guys didn't quite show up mentally,"
coach Thorn Glielmi said. "But it is a learning ex
perience and I think they learned from it."
The team competed with an incomplete line
up on vault and high-bar, but was helped by ju
nior Dan Gill's decision to compete in the all
around competition. Gill was contemplating
scratching some events to speed recovery from a
wrist infection, but he decided to enter and
wound up finishing third.
Stanford fell behind Cal after the first event of
the competition and never caught up. Starting on
the pommel horse, the team hit only two of the six
routines performed.
Senior Cade Raggio, the nation's top-ranked
gymnast on the pommel horse, took top honors
by hitting a clean set widi a score of 9.650.
In the floor exercise, freshman Sean Doolan
performed his first impact routine for Stanford
with a solid score of 9.1. Gill was the only other
Cardinal who managed not to fall, scoring a 9.3
— good enough for second place.
The squad seemed to gain a little momentum
on the still rings, where five of the six Stanford
gymnasts hit solid routines. The highlight of the
lineup, and arguably of the competition, was
Marshall Erwin's winning routine. Aside from a
brief struggle on a strength combination and a
small leg split at the end of the routine, Erwin im
proved his execution significantly from his
NCAA-winning ring routine last season.
"Marshall's routine continues to improve
every meet," Glielmi said. "His score alone im

proves the team score by 1.5 points."
The Cardinal was unable to carry its mo
mentum into the next two events, the high-bar
and rings. For the second consecutive meet, se
nior Paul O'Leary was the only Stanford gym
nast who hit his parallel bars routine, scoring a
9.1 and garnering second-place honors behind
the Bear's NCAA parallel bars champion Cody
Moore.
The high bars didn't treat the Cardinal much
better, but sophomore Kelly performed a
beautiful toe-on layout Tkatchev release for an
8.7, and Cill performed three release moves fora
9.425, only .05 points shy of first place.
The Cardinal saved its best performance of
the day for last, on the vault, where it hit all five
vaults performed. Senior Matt Mclean took a
small step on his big one-and-a-half twisting
Kasamatsu, scoring a 9.3, his best score of the

night.
Gill, the defending NCAA Champion in the
event, slipped his hand on the vaulting table, ef
fectively taking off with one hand, but still man
aged to complete two twists with good form in the
air.
His clean landing on this unusual vault gar
nered him a 9.3, which tied McLean for second
place.
When asked to explain the many uninspired
performances by both teams, Glielmi said: "If you
want an excuse, there's always one out there. I
told the guys that if someone is going to beat us,
that we make them earn it."
The Cardinal will look to rebound this Satur
day at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion against Air
Force. The meet will run in conjunction with the
No. 8 women's gymnastics competition against
No. 7 Arizona State.
