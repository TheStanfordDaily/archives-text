# Tennis nets three wins
## 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While President's day weekend provided
most students with a mid-quarter breather,
the No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team (4-1)
had no such luxury as its dual-match season
kicked into high gear. The Cardinal had a
busy weekend at the Taube Family Tennis
Center, recording three victories in four
days.

Men's Tennis
Friday: No. 7 Stanford def. UC-lrvine 7-0
Saturday: Stanford def. Fresno State 6-1
Monday: Stanford def. San Diego State 6-1

Stanford dominated UC-Irvine (6-3) on
Friday, Fresno State (3-4) on Saturday and
San Diego State (2-3) on Monday. The Car
dinal won 23 of 26 matches.
The weekend was just what the Cardinal
needed to build some momentum before
traveling to Louisville this Thursday to de
fend its National Team Indoor title.
"This was a great weekend for us," asso
ciate head coach John Whitlinger said. "I
thought we played really well. Everyone bat
tled and was competitive."
Against UC-Irvine, Stanford won all
three doubles matches to secure the first
point of the match and eventually blank the
Anteaters 7-0.
In an important match to solidify their
No. 3 national doubles ranking, senior All-
Americans David Martin and Scott lipsky
edged No. 11 Johnathan Endrikat and
Brian Morton 9-7 on court one. In the sec
ond doubles match, sophomore Sam War
burg and senior Ail-American Ryan Havi
land defeated Zoran Korac |r. and Sean
O'Connor. On court three, junior Carter

Morris and sophomore Phil Sheng, playing
together for the first time, won easily 8-3
over the Anteaters' Greg Biorkman and
VVkwesi Williams.
Stanford won five of the six singles
matches in straight sets. No. 15 Martin sat
out the singles to give junior Joe Kao the
chance to play in his first dual match of the
year. Kao capitalized on the opportunity,
grinding out a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory against
Peter Surapol.
"I was really happy to see Joe get in there
and get a win," Whitlinger said.
Against Fresno State, the Cardinal scored
a 6-1 victory. The threat of rain forced the
singles matches to be played prior to the
doubles so that there would be a better
chance of completing the match. But the
rain never arrived as Stanford won the top
five singles matches in straight sets.
For the second straight day, Haviland led
the way with a victory at the top singles posi
tion. He defeated the Bulldogs' Hector Al
mada 7-5,6-3.
The Cardinal's lone loss came at the sixth
singles position by Sheng, who lost 6-3, 6-7,
6-4 to Sergiu Modoc. Leading 4-3 in the
final set, Sheng's left quadriceps muscle
began to cramp and it hindered him for the
remainder of the match.
"I got off to a shaky start, but then came
back," Sheng said. "I got so pumped up
when I broke his serve to go up in the third
[set] that I started to cramp. Everything was
going my way at that point. The match was
within my grasp."
Even t hough the team match was already
decided by the time the doubles matches
began, the Cardinal continued to play ex
cellent tennis. ITie pair of Warburg and

Brian Morton 9-7 on court one. In the sec
ond doubles match, sophomore Sam War
burg and senior Ail-American Ryan Havi
land defeated Zoran Korac |r. and Sean
O'Connor. On court three, junior Carter

Morris and sophomore Phil Sheng, playing
together for the first time, won easily 8-3
over the Anteaters' Greg Biorkman and
VVkwesi Williams.
Stanford won five of the six singles
matches in straight sets. No. 15 Martin sat
out the singles to give junior Joe Kao the
chance to play in his first dual match of the
year. Kao capitalized on the opportunity,
grinding out a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory against
Peter Surapol.
"I was really happy to see Joe get in there
and get a win," Whitlinger said.
Against Fresno State, the Cardinal scored
a 6-1 victory. The threat of rain forced the
singles matches to be played prior to the
doubles so that there would be a better
chance of completing the match. But the
rain never arrived as Stanford won the top
five singles matches in straight sets.
For the second straight day, Haviland led
the way with a victory at the top singles posi
tion. He defeated the Bulldogs' Hector Al
mada 7-5,6-3.
The Cardinal's lone loss came at the sixth
singles position by Sheng, who lost 6-3, 6-7,
6-4 to Sergiu Modoc. Leading 4-3 in the
final set, Sheng's left quadriceps muscle
began to cramp and it hindered him for the
remainder of the match.
"I got off to a shaky start, but then came
back," Sheng said. "I got so pumped up
when I broke his serve to go up in the third
[set] that I started to cramp. Everything was
going my way at that point. The match was
within my grasp."
Even t hough the team match was already
decided by the time the doubles matches
began, the Cardinal continued to play ex
