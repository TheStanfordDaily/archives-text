# Feminizing the male coaching ranks
## 
### 
History was made on Feb. 13 in
men's college basketball. But
on the day before Valentine's
Day, this historic moment
owes its place in history to a woman.
Teresa Phillips, the athletic director at
Tennessee Suite University, became the
first woman to coach in a men's Division I
game. Filling in for suspended interim
coach Hosea Lewis for one game, Phillips
assumed the coaching duties as her Tigers
lost to Austin Peay 71 -56.
Despite TSU's 17th consecutive loss,
several players asked for Phillips to stay
around and help with practice following
Lewis's reinstatement given (sadly) that
the 15-point loss was their best perfor
mance of the conference season.
I would like to congratulate Phillips for
breaking the barrier and showing that a
woman can get the job done in a man's
game. Though her team did lose, the fact
that the players felt that they owed their
best performance to their new coach is a

shining testament to
Phillips's one-game stint.
I am of the opinion
that having women as
coaches in men's sports is
long overdue. Who is
better suited to get a
bunch of testosterone
filled males to jump
through luxjps, take di-

rections without question and spend
countless hours working on improving
their physical physiques than a woman?
And with the increasing tendency of
many of today's high-profile athletes to be
thrust into the spotlight before their matu
rity levels are able to cope with such scruti
ny, female coaches could add that element
of maternal comfort and guidance that
male coaches, try as they might, just can't
match. Somehow a hearty ass-slap and a
sharp "come on, suck it up" are just no
match fora heartfelt hug and a loving "it's
gonna be all right. I'm here for you."

Which is not to intimate that female
coaches would be pushovers for their male
players. If my experience with Stanford
girls has taught me anything it's that
women can be every bit as cold, blindly am
bitious and oblivious to male bullshit as
their male counterparts.
Despite these advantages that female
head coaches possess over males, 1 do still
see several glaring disadvantages for
women wishing to enter the profession.
Being a head coach fora men's sport
may very well be the one and only profes
sion for women in which being extraordi
narily hot will actually hinder your ability
to find employment. Because if you are a
very attractive woman surrounded by a
bunch of 20 and 21-year old males, I can
guarantee that everything you say is going
in one ear and out the other.
And God help you if you come to prac
tice in those short little coaching shorts of
