# Zimmerman leads national team to victory
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The atmosphere surrounding
this weekend's Titan Games was
positively chaotic. Olympic-level
boxing, wrestling, judo, karate,
taekwondo, weightlifting, shot-put
and fencing all took place simulta
neously under one roof at San Jose
State's Event Center, in a dizzying
circus of sporting mayhem. Yet
despite all the surrounding dis
tractions, Stanford fencer and
2000 Olympian Iris Zimmerman
remained intensely focused and
helped lead Team USA to victory
during the two-day fencing com
petition.
The senior thrived in the week
end's fast-paced and ultra-com
petitive environment.
The Titan Games' scoring for
mat allows for each fencer in the
relay event to score as many touches
as possible in a four-minute bout.
The score then accumulates so that
each new bout inherits the collective
score of previous teammates

through the six-person relay.
On Friday night, the fencing
competition opened with Team
USA soundly defeating the Pan
American all-star team, 64-44.
The Pan American team was
composed of six athletes from
Canada, Chile, Puerto Rico, Mex
ico, and Brazil, and had a good
start in the first two matchups be
tween epeeists, when the score
stood at an even 15-15. In the
third bout, however, foilist Alex
Wood, a 2000 Stanford graduate,
pulled the U.S. ahead, score 16-
24. Zimmerman then added to
the lead by finishing her bout 35-
22. The male and female sabrists
for the U.S., Colin Parker and
Sada Jacobson, clinched the win
in the final two bouts.
The round-robin action contin
ued on Saturday afternoon, with
the Pan Asian team being narrow
ly defeated by both the Pan Amer
ican and U.S. teams, 48-43 and 56-
50 respectively.
The U.S. fell behind early in the
match to the Pan Asian team and

the score was tied 25-25 following
Zimmerman's bout, fourth in the
six-person relay. The two U.S.
sabrists then eked ahead for the
close victory and ensured U.S.
placement in the final held later
that evening.
Team USA faced a much
stronger Pan American team in
the final gold medal match. En
ergized by their upset against the
favored Pan Asian team, the Pan
American team was beating the
U.S. following the first three
bouts, which were against both
American epeeists as well as
foilist Wood. Zimmerman
turned Team USA's fortunes
around, however, with her cru
cial bout in which she made up
her team's four-point deficit and
handed her last two teammates a
precarious 25-24 lead. With
Team USA leading for the first
time of the lst-place competi
tion, Parker and Jacobson fenced
strongly against the Pan Ameri
can sabrists, who were much
fiercer than they had been the

day before, and finished the
evening with a 50-42 victory for
Team USA, final score 50-42.
"I told myself to just take it one
touch at a time. I was trying to even
the score and once I did that, to sur
pass her and give our team some
breathing room. I wanted to give
Colin [Parker] confidence going
into his next match," Zimmerman
told reporters after the match.
"When Iris brought the match
back, it gave us positive energy
going into the match," Parker re
turned. "This format was so exhila
rating and we fed off the energy of
the packed crowd."
The win this weekend bodes well
for the U.S. at next summer's
Olympic Games, yet Team USA un
deniably has work to do if it wants to
improve upon 2000's 4th place fin
ish and actually reach the podium.
Zimmerman has decided to take
time off this spring to work towards
that end.
