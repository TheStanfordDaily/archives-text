The Red Planet
The first Mars orbiters in the
1970s returned pictures of dry river
beds — evidence that liquid oceans
existed in the distant past on the
planet. The most accepted theory for
this is that a billion years ago, the
greenhouse effect was stronger on
Mars and allowed for liquid water to
exist. But a newer model, published
in Science in December 2002, argues
that Mars was never warm enough

from greenhouse gases. Instead, that model suggests
that an asteroid 50 to 350 kilometers in diameter hit
Mars. The energy dissipated following the collision
melted significant amounts of water — similar to
heat added to a 112 rozen ball of ice. The huge craters on
Mars support this argument, although most are con
siderably older than the predicted age of the oceans.
Deep Blue Sea
Ever wondered how sharks can trace a single drop
of blood from almost a mile away? A study from the
University of California San Francisco suggests that a
clear jelly under the shark's skin detects minute
changes in seawater temperature. The animal then
uses this information to track prey. The actual gel is a
mixture of glycoproteins filling hundreds of elec
trosensory canals, called ampullae. To study the gel,
researchers collected samples from fish that died re
cently in aquariums, heated them and measured the
voltage. They found that changes of less than a thou
sandth of a degree induced a voltage detectable by the
ampullae.

Soft Drugs Lead to Hard
A study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that children who smoked
marijuana were five times as likely to consume hard
er drugs than those who did not. The study used 311
sets of Australian twins, where one sibling had
smoked pot before the age of 17 and the other did
not. The authors controlled as many factors as possi
ble — economic background, family environment
and genetic makeup — to assess whether pot can
cause biochemical changes that encourage further
drug-taking behavior. The study was unable to reach
definitive conclusions but it did suggest that social fac
tors (i.e. friends, experimentation) might be involved.
A Catalytic Conversion
More automobiles are cruising our streets than ever
before. Thankfully, vehicular pollution has not in
creased so much, as modern cars release between 95
and 99 percent less hazardous gases than a generation
ago. These gases include carbon monoxide and
smog-forming vapors like unburned hydrocarbons
and nitrogen oxides. Catalytic converters — thin
layers of metal catalyst bound to a ceramic, honey
comb support — are largely responsible for the re
duced emissions. The metal is usually platinum, pal
ladium or rhodium. These materials are expensive,
but only a small layer is needed. The catalytic con
verter transforms pollutants into substances more
friendly to the environment.
Evolution Algorithms
Integrate the power of computers with the poten
tial of biology. With that premise, researchers have
been busy refining so-called genetic algorithms,
which are essentially computerized versions of evolu
tion. A problem is modeled as a set of rules and input
data, which is fed into the algorithm. On that basis
and using some randomness, the algorithm produces
"individuals" over the course of many "generations."
At the end, the best individual is selected as a solution
to the problem. Genetic algorithms are starting to
produce significant results — they have been used
to reproduce inventions such as antennas and gener
al-purpose controllers. With more computing power,
researchers say that genetic algorithms may become a
valuable tool in the human discovery process.
Very Small Heart Tools
A Swiss team has used nano-technology to monitor
the heart. The scientists built an array of cantilevers
coated with protein antibodies. Each cantilever was
0.5 millimeters long, 0.1 millimeters wide and 500
nanometers thick. Physicians could use the array to
monitor protein concentration near the heart much
more accurately than current methods that rely on ra
dioactive labeling. Such measurements will allow
quicker and easier diagnosis of heart attacks. Al
though the nano-apparatus performed successfully in
solution, human trials are some time away.
