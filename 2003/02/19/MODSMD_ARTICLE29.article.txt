# A 						geek's paradise:
## New technology for work and play 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The following computer products will help you with both work and play. Here
are reviews for Apple's G4 Power Book laptop, Roxio's CD / DVD authoring soft
ware, Adobe's PageMaker desktop publishing suite and Maxis' Sim City 4.
Apple recently released a new line of Powerßook laptops. The Daily looked at,
the 1 GHz G4 model with a 15.1" screen. The first thing 1 noticed about the com
puter is its sleek design. It's hard to believe that Apple can pack so much into such
a small unit.
As the laptop powered up, the screen showed a very sharp picture of the desk
top, which is essential for multimedia use. Featuring a wide screen format, the
Powerßook allows users to view several images or documents side-by-side.
This was also useful when I tried to do some video editing. Not only did the
computer have enough speed and memory to effortlessly keep up with the task,
but I was also impressed with the rich sound the laptop speakers produced.
Once the video was completed, the G4 Powerßook was ready to produce a
DVD of my work: the 15-inch and 17-inch models feature a Super Drive DVD
writer. The DVD writer works well in conjunction with a digital camcorder, al
lowing you to create home videos, edit them and then play them on any standard
DVD player. The Fire Wire port on the Powerßook makes connecting the cam
era a snap and all the G4 models allow you to view computer output on your TV.
Unfortunately, I encountered several compatibility issues when trying to con
vert from Mac to PC format. However, this is an artifact of the platforms and not
the fault of this laptop in particular. While the difficulties are annoying, Apple is
not to blame for the problems.
Using my PC, creating CDs and DVDs was not as simple. Though I was using
a top-end 2 GHz laptop with 512 MB of memory, almost every program I tried
would ruin CDs I attempted to burn. The programs claimed the computer was

not supplying information
quickly enough to the
CD burner.

Luckily, I had Roxio's
Easy CD Creator 5.1 Plat
inum. After a snappy in-

stallation, the program
performed flawlessly —
not a single disk was wasted.

The software also had a very
intuitive interface and
proved that extensive func-

tionality does not necessarily
lead to confusing menus.
When the program starts, it

presents a screen that allows
you to choose the kind of pro
ject you want to create. You can

J /
write music, data, photo, video
CDs, DVDs and copy disks.
Once you make a selection, it

brings up the appropriate screen,
and you're set to go. Easy CD Cre
ator lets you produce professional-

ly-sounding music CDs with options like
cross-fading, which fades the end of one
song into the beginning of the next.
But the feature I found most valuable
was "buffer underrun prevention." Select
ing this box on the "Record" screen means
that if the CI) burner is writ ing data to the
CD faster than the computer can provide
it, the burner will slow down to a slower
speed to allow the computer to catch up.
This fixed the issue all the other programs
were having when they ruined CDs.
Roxio released Easy CD 8c DVD Cre
ator 6 Digital Media Suite yesterday, but a
copy was not available for review by press
time. The new version features additional
DVD authoring options.
In terms of desktop publishing, <
Adobe continues to demonstrate that it
deserves its industry-leading reputation
Adobe's release of PageMaker 7.0 builds upon the successes of previous Page-
Maker versions and offers useful new features.

When you first start the program, it presents you with a wide assortment of
templates that make the process of creating documents very simple. At the same
time, the simple interface actually allows a surprising level of customization. This
program is prefect fora wide range of applications, from creating a flier fora
school event to producing a professional business publication.
New features allow easier conversion between related applications. For exam
ple, version 7.0 can import Adobe Photoshop images directly. This saves time and

doesn't require multiple versions of the original. It can also place Microsoft
Word documents into publications, which is useful for creating newslet
ters or pamphlets. Initially, I had a problem placing foreign language

II /' I I o o o o
documents, hut saving the files in an earlier version of Word fixed the
issue.
Overall, Adobe PageMaker 7.0 balances ease of use with ad-

vanced functionality, creating a product that is practical for educa
tional, personal, and business uses.
As far as names ero, SimCitv 4 is more than iust an update to Sim-

City 3000. The newest incarnation of Maxis' city simulation allows
you to control details at a level not seen before in this genre.
If you place a school, you can adjust the amount of funding for
education as well as for busing. Each setting changes various as-

— — o o o
pects of the game and how the school interacts with its surround
ings.
When I first started the game, I was stunned by the graphics
quality. Individual buildings were rendered in 3-D and people

and cars populate the streets. The realism is extraordinary.
But the updates are not just visual: Multiple new modes have
been added to the game. "God mode" allows you to drop

you can create a

Clearly, these hardware and software tools will keep
you productive, or offer an entertaining diversion from your work.
