University President John Hen

Matthew Brewer discussed the
inner-workings of University leader
ship yesterday at a lunch forum
called "Understanding Our Institu
tion," kicking off Stanford's celebra
tion of Civic Engagement Week. The
week is currently being celebrated on
200 college campuses nationwide.
"I think this type of forum is very
important because it brings togeth
er aspiring student leaders and
University leaders all to the same
table to exchange recipes for imple
menting successful change," said
Brewer, a senior. "When it comes to
implementing c hange, a lot of the

process is vague and hazy to the av
erage student and dialogues like
this lend more visibility to the
process."
Yesterday's discussion was a
combined effort between the ASSU,
which provided funding for the
program, and the other political or
ganizations on campus, including
the Stanford NAACP, die Stanford
Democrats, the Stanford Republi
cans and the Campus Greens.
"All these groups that would not
normally be in contact with one an
other are given a forum to talk to
each other," said junior Stephen
Chan, the event facilitator for Civic
Engagement Week. "Hopefully
thev will continue to talk after this

civic engagement and university life during a lunchtime talk yesterday.
week is over and maybe work collec
tively toward more effective meth
ods of engaging their fellow stu
dents."
According to Chan, it is critical
for students to understand Univer
sity politics and the structures of the
administration and student govern
ment, which was the focus of yester
day's panel.
The discussion began when
moderator, Nadinne Cruz, director
at the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, asked both Brewer and Hen
nessy to dispel common myths con
cerning the authority of the Univer
sity and ASSU presidencies.
Both Brewer and Hennessy took
this opportunity to shatter the au
thoritarian image of their positions
by explaining their limitations and
describing the established system of
checks and balances within the Uni
versity.
"The ASSU tackles many issues
through committees, and people
are nominated to sit on these com
mittees and make balanced deci
sions," Brewer said.
Hennessy said that similar forces
were at play in running the Stanford
as a whole.
"In research and curriculum, the
University is largely faculty-gov
erned," he said. "In any leadership
role, you learn how to deal with a di

verse group of people and also learn
how to make difficult decisions. I
rarely make a decision where some
community of individuals wouldn't
be opposed to the decision."
Several students representing
the Coalition for Labor Justice
asked Hennessy pointed questions
regarding Stanford's living wage
policy during the question-and-an
swer session.
"Certainly we have the responsi
bility to be the best employer we can
possibly be within the constraints of
conducting the University in a fi
nancially responsible manner,"
Hennessy said. "It raises a complex
system of trade-off s that requires us
to balance the costs of wages across
the entire University [and] consider
the impact on financial aid and the
impact on future generations."
The students from the coalition
expressed disappointment in Hen
nessy's remarks.
"I definitely wasn't satisfied with
his responses," said Lauren Mason,
a coalition member who first ad
dressed the issue to Hennessy. "I
feel like the issue of labor policy is
being ignored at Stanford. We un
derstand it would take a lot of finan
cial sacrifice, but we believe it is more
important to advocate a better qual
ity of life for workers than to pad our
pockets."
Concerning the coalition mem
bers' remarks, Chan said, "Every
student had a right to be there and
a right to be heard, and I think in
side, University administrators

want students to challenge them."
Hennessy reacted similarly to the
coalition members' questions.
"I think dialogue is at the foun
dation of any democratic society,
and engaging in that dialogue with
in the university setting is part of be
coming an engaged citizen," he
said.
In addition to labor issues, stu
dents asked questions ranging from
the University's need-blind admis
sion policy and financial situation to
its stance on affirmative action and
diversity.
"Stanford's president is also a
member of the Board of
Trustees and is therefore
charged with the long-term
health of the University," Hen
nessy said. "The biggest chal
lenge in this regard is looking to
the future and ensuring that
Stanford will be here for future
generations of students and fac
ulty."
Both Brewer and Hennessy ex
pressed their hopes that the mes
sage of Civic Engagement Week
would be increased student involve
ment in leadership activities as well
as a heightened sense of political
awareness.
"All of us here are future lead
ers," Brewer said. "But when you
call yourself a future leader, at some
point you must become a current
leader, and I think ultimately the
university experience is teaching us
how to do that in a very diverse en
vironment."
