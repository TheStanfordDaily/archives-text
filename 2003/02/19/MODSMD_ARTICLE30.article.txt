# Towards a super highway:
## SLAC helps set data transfer record 
### TANIA ROJAS 
Listen up Internet down-loaders,
file-sharers and computer aficionados!
Does the prospect of downloading
I)VI) movies, music files and computer
programs around the globe in minutes
sound too good to be true?
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SI AC) was one of several insti
tutions that were recently awarded a
data-transfer speed record by Inter
net 2, a group of 200 universities col
laborating worldwide for innovative
Internet technology. The team trans
ferred 6.7 gigabytes of data from Sun
nyvale, Calif., to Amsterdam in the
Netherlands in less than a minute.
That's about four hours of DVD-quali
ty movies traveling 7,000 miles in less
than 60 seconds.
The project was carried out by an in
ternational team of scientists from
SLAC, Caltech, the National Institute
for Nuclear Physics and High Energy
Physics in Amsterdam, and the Faculty
of Science of the Universiteit van Ams
terdam They were able to beat the pre
vious transfer speed record established
in 2000 by a team of scientists from Mi
crosoft, Qwest and University of Wash
ington and the Information Sciences
Institute.
"We actually thought we could beat
it," said Les Cottrell, assistant director
of SLAC Computer Services. "We were

excited about the collaboration."
The team used technology provid
ed by StarLight, Teragrid,
Netherlight, a $1 million equipment
loan from Cisco Systems, network and
bandwidth supplied by Level 3 Com
munications, as well as 16 high-speed
PCs from Caltech.
The team connected a circuit of
high-speed routers in Sunnyvale,
Calif., Chicago, 111., and Amsterdam,
where they successfully sent 923
megabytes of data per second for 58
seconds.
"This shows that you can actually
achieve these types of speeds on the
networks that are currently available,"
Cottrell said. "All we have done is to
show that it's possible. The technology
is there already."
Cottrell believes the technology will
be useful in a number of scientific
fields, including high energy nuclear
physics, astronomy and the Human
Genome Project. "The immediate
needs for such speeds .. . will supplant
shipping truck or plane-loads of data
between collaborating sites and will en
able scientists to share the data in hours
rather than in days," Cottrell said.
He sees the field of high-energy
physics using this technology in the
next year or two. "This speed will be
able to ship not just one terabyte (1,000
gigabytes) per day but maybe 10 ter
abytes, or the same amount of data 10

times as quickly, enabling people to get
at data more quickly," said Cornell.
He hopes that J he new break
through will also benefit the medical
community.
"[Doctors] don't have these kinds of
speeds available over long distances.
Imagine doctors scattered about the
globe sharing a scan of a patient," Cot
frell said.
In the long run, multi-media com
panies tan benefit from the fast speeds

of data transfers.
"Just think what it will do to the
video industry being able to ship two
DVDs in a minute," Cottrell said.
How do Stanford students feel
about being able to download files in
such a short time in the future?
"I would definitely download more
things in greater quantities," said one
freshman and avid file-sharing pro
gram user. "Limewire is kind of slow,
but if it was faster that would be great."

The team of scientists transferred the equivalent of four hours of DVD-quality movies
from Sunnyvale, Calif, to Amsterdam in the Netherlands in less than a minute, beat
ing the previous record set in 2000.
