# Health 101: get pierced

Thinking about getting a body pierc
ing? Read on if you want informa
tion on how to be safe with the pro
cedure.
There are just as many places to be
pierced as there are reasons to make holes in
your body. However, not every place poses
the same amount of risk and liability. That is
why it is important to get pierced by some
one who is licensed and has experience. Do
not let your roommate pierce your ear (or
other body part) unless you want to risk in-

fection or severe damage
such as paralysis.
Infections can arise from
using dirty instruments, hav
ing bad technique and not
taking care of the new open
wound. The use of dirty in
struments can cause prob
lems that range from minor
swelling to hepatitis, tetanus

and HIV. Excessive bleeding can also occur
because of the inability for the blood to coagu
late.
Other severe damage can occur from irri
tating, puncturing or severing a nerve or tis
sue.
According to Body Exotic, a piercing store
in San Jose, if your tongue is pierced in the
wrong place, you can experience numbness
or even loss of taste. You can get partial facial
paralysis if a facial nerve gets pinched by an
eyebrow ring that is too close to the bridge of
your nose. For those getting tongue rings,
there is possible dental damage caused by
swelling and infection of the tongue. You can
also chip your tooth as well as choke on loose
jewelry.
An aesthetic problem that can occur from
improper use, placement and care of pierc
ings is the development of keloids. Keloids are
thick scarring that develop around the pierc
ing site. At times, skin growing over the pierc
ings can lead to severe infections.
Keloids are more severe forms of scarring.
Dr. Wong, a dermatologist at Aesthetic and
Laser Dermatology in Palo Alto, pointed out
that hypertrophic scars can form whenever
the skin is traumatized by a piercing. "These
are different than keloids in that hypertrophic
scars gradually go down while keloids swell
up, get hard and rarely go down. You would
have to treat it with surgery or injections.
Going to a cheap place to get pierced could
also mean gett ing stuck with cheap jewelry. If
the jewelry is too thin or too heavy then the
body may reject it. If the jewelry has a small di
ameter then it can cut off circulation and cause

pain. The only type of jewelry that can be used
is surgical stainless steel (300 series). After
your piercing heals, you can switch to other
materials such as gold, titanium, acrylic and
niobium.
Also, make sure your piercer does not use a
piercing gun. Piercing guns cannot be steril
ized properly and are less accurate than nee
dles. They can also cause a lot of damage be
cause they crush the tissues that are pierced.
The most common places to get pierced in
clude the ear, nose, tongue and navel. Risks
and healing times vary for each area.
Ear
If you want to get an ear piercing, your
safest bet would be to get one on your earlobe.
Your earlobe contains a good amount of fat
that will be safe to pierce, unlike the cartilage
on top of your ear. Also, piercings in the carti
lage of the upper ear can easily become infect
ed because of pressure applied while sleeping
and bacteria in hair. Ear cartilage piercings do
not heal as quickly as ear lobe piercings.
Whereas a typical ear lobe piercing heals in six
to eight weeks, a hole in the cartilage will heal
in four months to a year.
Nose
The nasal septum takes six to eight months
to heal. The nasal bridge takes eight to 10
weeks to heal. The nostril takes two to four
months. Take your pick. Just make sure your
piercer does not use a gun. The downside of
nose piercings is that there can be a lot of
swelling since the nose is a heavily vascular
ized area.
Tongue
There are risks of numbing your tongue
for good if your piercer does not know what
he or she is doing. Piercers at Body Exotic
stress that a piercer needs to have a good
grasp of human anatomy to be able to bypass
nerves and veins effectively. And they also said
that if you feel your tongue going numb while
they are piercing, make them stop because
chances are they are doing something wrong.
Because of the tongue's vast amount of
blood supply, it takes only four weeks fora
piercing to heal. The downside is that there is
a lot of swelling that can become annoying.
Another downside is that you must abstain
from having oral contact with another person
until the piercing heals. Otherwise, you can
get infections. The same advice goes for ab
staining from alcohol, spicy foods and hot liq
uids.

Navel
If you like to wear tight clothes and want a
navel piercing, ask yourself if you can deal
with oversized shirts for at least four months,
while the healing takes place. If tight clothes
are worn, moisture will collect around the
pierced site and an infection will occur if there
is no air circulation. Also, you must stay away
from public pools and spas.

If you accept all the risks and pleasures that
come out of getting pierced, then make sure
you do it wisely. Here are a few suggestions:
Make sure your piercer is licensed and prac
tices safeguards to ensure your health and
safety, watch to make sure your piercer uses
disposable needles and he or she throws them
away in biohazard containers after using them
and ask that your piercer informs you of pos
sible risks and hazards on any type of piercing
job.
You must make sure you take care ol your
piercing as well. Wash your hands before
touching or cleaning the pierced area. Use
warm water on the piercing before twisting it
in place or removing crusty skin. Do not use
antibacterial ointments on any piercings be
cause they will not allow the area to be aerat
ed. Use a saline solution to rinse off the soap
and crusty discharge. Lastly, dry the area with
a paper towel or napkin. Remember to keep
the area clean and follow any specific guide
lines given by your piercer.
Piercings are great to look at â€” but only if
they are clean and not infected. So practice
good hygiene when it comes to getting a hole
in your body, and you'll be one step closer to
good health.

Getting a navel piercing means that you'll have
to deal with wearing oversized shirts for at least
four months afterwards, to allow air to circulate
around the piercing.
