# Dolly the cloned sheep put to death

LONDON, England (AP) —
Dolly the cloned sheep was put to
death Friday, after premature
aging and disease marred her
short existence and raised ques
tions about the practicality of copy
ing life.
The decision to end Dolly's life
at age 6 — about half the life ex
pectancy of her breed — was
made because a veterinarian con
firmed she had a progressive lung
disease, according to the Roslin In
stitute, the Scottish lab where she
was created and lived.
"We must await the results of
the post-mortem on Dolly in order
to assess whether her relatively
premature death was in any way
connected with the fact that she
was a clone," said Richard Gard
ner, a professor of zoology at Ox
ford University and chair of the
Royal Society working group on
stem cell research and therapeutic
cloning.
"If there is a link, it will provide
further evidence of the dangers in
herent in reproductive cloning
and the irresponsibility of anybody
who is trying to extend such work
to humans."
lan Wilmut, the leader of the
team that created Dolly, said it was
unlikely her illness was attribut
able to being a clone.
"The most likely thing is an in
fection which causes a slow pro
gressive illness and for which there
isn't an effective treatment," he
said. "Sadly, we have had that in
some of the sheep on the farm, so
that's the most likely explanation,
but we don't know."
The institute's Dr. Harry Grif
fin said Dolly had suffered from a
virus-induced lung cancer that
was also diagnosed in the past few
months in other sheep housed
with Dolly.
"The most likely thing is she
caught it from that sheep and it's
an unfortunate result of having to
be housed in order to give her se
curity and so that we could observe
her," Wilmut said.
"Clearly, the whole group are

very upset and sad."
Griffin said that Dolly had been
coughing for about a week before
the vet came Friday afternoon and
conducted a CT scan.
She was born July 5, 1996, in a
research compound of the Scottish
institute, and the achievement of
her creation — announced Feb.
23, 1997 — created an interna
tional sensation.
Researchers had previously
cloned sheep from fetal and em
bryonic cells, but until Dolly, it was
unknown whether an adult cell
could reprogram itself to develop
into a new being.
The Dolly breakthrough
heightened speculation that
human cloning inevitably would
become possible. But one of the
biggest fears was that Dolly might
have been born prematurely old.
It was feared that using adult
genetic material to make a clone
might produce an animal whose
cells were already aged. On the
other hand, scientists hoped the
genetic clock might be "wound
back" to its starting point.
Dolly, a Finn Dorset sheep
named after the singer Dolly Par
ton, bred normally on two occa
sions with a Welsh mountain ram
called David, first giving birth to
Bonnie in April 1998 and then to
three more lambs in 1999.
The births were good news,
showing that clones can repro
duce.
But in 1999, scientists noticed
that the cells in Dolly's body —
cloned from the breast cell of a 6-
year-old adult ewe — had started
to show signs of wear more typical
of an older animal.
Then in January 2002, her cre
ators announced she had devel
oped arthritis at the relatively early
age of 5 1/2 years, stirring debate
over whether cloning procedures
might be flawed.
Some geneticists said the find
ing showed that researchers could
not manufacture copies of animals
without the original genetic blue
print eventually wearing out.
