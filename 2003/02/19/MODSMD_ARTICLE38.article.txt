# Study focuses on grade inflation

### FRANCINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some beg, some plead, some even flirt with their
professors — all in the name of getting an "A." But for
Stanford students, achieving those top grades might
not be so hard after all, according to a recent grade in
flation study at Duke University.
Stuart Rojstaczer, a professor of environmental sci
ence at Duke, claims that universities throughout the
nation — including Stanford — employ grade infla
tion to award greater numbers of students with high
er grades.
" The 'C' grade has gone the way of the nickel
candy bar," Rojstaczer said.
He stated that students are more likely than ever to
achieve top marks.
With data from 34 colleges, Rojstaczer compiled a
database of grade-point averages dating back to the
1960s and published the information on his Web site,
www.Gradelnflation.com. The findings show that
grade inflation has occurred at all institutions,
whether large or small, public or private.
According to Rojstaczer's database, Stanford stu
dents graduating in 1968 averaged a GPAof 3.04. By
1992, that figure increased to 3.44.
"The average CPAs are so high, it's difficult to dis
tinguish between those who are exceptional and those
who are merely good," Rojstaczer said. "As a result,
the higher grades have been devalued."
A similar phenomenon is hitting high schools, as
well. A recent UCLA survey of college freshman sup
ported Rojstaczer's findings and claimed that, while
just over 15 percent of first-year college students car
ried A averages in high school, the portion was 44 per
cent by 2001.
However, homework hours have hit an all-time
low, the report stated. Nearly 85 percent of high
school seniors spend 10 hours per week or less on
homework.
Rojstaczer said that, aside from devaluation, grade
inflation disadvantages those who have graduated
from institutions employing fairer methods of stu
dent evaluation.
"It's speculation of course," Rojstaczer said. "But a
Stanford student with a GPA of 3.6 percent, for ex

ample, would probably have a better chance of get
ting employment than a student with a similar GPA
from an institution where assessment is stricter."
Michael Kirst, a professor of education, said that
such'findings do not necessarily apply to Stanford.
"The students here are not in any real trouble,"
Kirst said. "They work hard and have been well-pre
pared for higher education. Many of them deserve
the high grades."
Education Prof. Edward Haertel agreed that Rojs
taczer's findings should not overly concern Stanford
students.
"On average [Stanford students] are producing a
higher quality of work and studying harder," Haertel
said.
However, he acknowledged that methods of as
sessment differed between each University depart
ment.
At Stanford, courses are graded based on a variety
of models, including criteria-based assessment and
the traditional grading curve.
Elliot Eisner, professor of child education, said that
drawing conclusions from Rojstaczer's findings
would be hard without further analysis. However,
students who fulfill the conditions of the grading
models should be awarded the grades they deserve.
"If students are doing well academically and the
quality of work is high, then receiving the high grades
is sensible," Eisner said.
Among students, there are mixed feelings con
cerning grade inflation at Stanford.
"I feel it's pretty much true," said junior Julie
Hwang. "There are lots of good students, but the
grades are always bumped up to compensate for the
grading curves."
Andrew Marienberg, a sophomore, expressed dis
agreement with Hwang's point of view.
"It is not really easy to get an 'A.' " he said. I think
the grades accurately reflect how well you know the
material."
Regardless how severe grade inflation at Stanford
and other institutions actually is, Rojstaczer maintains
that it undeniably exists.
"Grading is like a currency and it has been deval
ued," he said. "We need a new coin — a new way of
assessing students."
