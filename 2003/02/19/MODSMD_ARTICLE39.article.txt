# Professor talks politics
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Luis Fraga is an associate professor of political
science whose research interests including voting
rights policy and urban politics and policy. He will
be teaching a class this spring on "Civic Capacity
and Urban Youth," and spoke yesterday in a panel
about political involvement as part of Civic En
gagement Week. The Daily sat down with Fraga to
talk about the class, as well as larger issues of civic
engagement at Stanford and in the United States.
The Daily: What do you think are some ways we
could be utilizing youth to increase civic engage
ment?

7 would like to see how much we might
learn if we provide better mechanisms of
socialization for youth so that they become
more accustomed to civic engagement

Luis Fraga: What I'm trying to do in the class is to
address the issue of civic engagement from the per
spective of future civic participants. One can focus
on trying to modify our current structure of partic
ipation by focusing on adults; I would like to see
how much we might learn and how challenging the
issues are if we try to think of trying to provide bet
ter mechanisms of socialization for youth, so that
they become more accustomed to civic engagement
as youth, with the hope that they might then be
more able to make informed choices about the type
of civic engagement they want to focus on as adults.
TD: Could you talk a little bit about how you see the
political atmosphere at Stanford?
LF: I would say pretty typical of a highly selective
institution. Some students are politically engaged,
very directly politically engaged with issues of the
outside world, some not. Everyone's very much fo
cused on their own individual responsibilities as
students and faculty. I've been encouraged to see
the level of interest in what's happening and may
happen further in the Middle East by some of our
students, but I wouldn't take that as a gauge of
overall University student interest.

"Civic engagement is a nice way of en
tring into a thoughtful discussion about
how much... Americans take an inter
est in issues outside of themselves

TD: Could you talk a little about the general de
cline of civic engagement in the United States?
LF: Well, this is a controversial conclusion. Not
everyone agrees that there has been a systematic
decline in civic engagement. Civic engagement is a
nice way of entering into a thoughtful discussiorr
about how much .. . Americans as residents and
citizens take an interest in issues outside of them
selves as individuals and their individual families. I
think that that's a healthy discussion to have in any
democratic society, however limited the democra
cy might be. Americans, in terms of voting patterns
and other measures of participation in civic
affairs — organization membership, as an example
— have some of the lowest rates of any society in
what we might agree is the developed world in rea
sonably democratic societies ... I would certainly
say that, to the extent that such limited participa
tion is highly correlated with class and race and eth

nicity, it is not healthy for the society to have low
levels of participation, when those who tend to par
ticipate least tend to be individuals of lower income
and lesser education.
TD: What do you think that the administration and
students can do to increase civic engagement.-'
Fraga: I'm not sure that any university wants a very
high level of civic engagement among students on
its campus if it leads to subsequent criticism of uni
versity policy or practice. It seems to me that any in
stitution wouldn't want to do that, the university
being no exception. However, [I think] the univer
sity has a responsibility, should its students express
an interest in engaging in activity of this sort, to
make sure that they are fully educated and fully
aware of what the reality is. That's hard for univer
sities to do ... So the university has a responsibility
to train its students to be fully able to engage civi
cally, but not necessarily to engage with the univer
sity in that particular fashion. It's a judgment that
the university has to make. Certainly, [Stanford] is
very supportive in faculty teaching courses on just
about anything they want that is of appropriate
academic caliber, scholarly caliber.
Among students ... I think among one of the
main things that can be done is for students to take
more responsibility to engage in discussions of the
issues of the day in their private moments with
their classmates and with their dormmates and
roommates. To make it part of the custom, in addi
tion to having one's down time and private time . ..
to also have a commitment to some public time to
learn about issues of the day. Students do that all

"The university has a responsibility to
train its students to be fully able to
engage civically..

the time and have done that all the time and some
dorms have organized programs to do that... It
would be nice if this became part of the accepted
and traditional culture.
I D: That's all the questions that I have. Is there
anything you want to add?
Fraga: If you look at public opinion polls that track
[Americans' faith in public officials] over the period
of the '80s and '90s, one sees a steady decline. I get
very concerned about what the implications are of
fewer and fewer citizens trusting public authority
and those who hold it, because if there is a major
issue of concern that arises, it seems to me there
isn't any other entity to address it other than those
who hold public authority. But, if we don't trust
them, then we have a very low set of expectations as
to what it is that they can accomplish. I see this as a
potential downward spiral to make those who are
politically and economically comfortable to with
draw from accepting responsibility to try to en
hance opportunity for those who might be much
less politically and economically comfortable.
TD: Do you think that at the same time there has to
be a certain balance between trusting governmen
tal figures and also having a healthy skepticism of
the things that they say?
Fraga: Provided our expectations do not drop so
low that the distrust leads to a lowering of expecta
tions of what it is people can d 0.... [Skepticism
is]questioning, it's asking, it's finding out. Distrust,
it seerns to me, is a more systematic lowering of ex
pectations: "I don't care what they say, I don't be
lieve them." And one decides that everyone is
telling half-truths and therefore there's no reason
for you to try to influence who may be
there . .. That I see as something that in the long
term cannot be healthy for any society.

engagement at Stanford and in the United States.
The Daily: What do you think are some ways we
could be utilizing youth to increase civic engage
ment?

7 would like to see how much we might
learn if we provide better mechanisms of
socialization for youth so that they become
more accustomed to civic engagement

Luis Fraga: What I'm trying to do in the class is to
address the issue of civic engagement from the per
spective of future civic participants. One can focus
on trying to modify our current structure of partic
ipation by focusing on adults; I would like to see
how much we might learn and how challenging the
issues are if we try to think of trying to provide bet
ter mechanisms of socialization for youth, so that
they become more accustomed to civic engagement
as youth, with the hope that they might then be
more able to make informed choices about the type
of civic engagement they want to focus on as adults.
TD: Could you talk a little bit about how you see the
political atmosphere at Stanford?
LF: I would say pretty typical of a highly selective
institution. Some students are politically engaged,
very directly politically engaged with issues of the
outside world, some not. Everyone's very much fo
cused on their own individual responsibilities as
students and faculty. I've been encouraged to see
the level of interest in what's happening and may
happen further in the Middle East by some of our
students, but I wouldn't take that as a gauge of
overall University student interest.

"Civic engagement is a nice way of en
tring into a thoughtful discussion about
how much... Americans take an inter
est in issues outside of themselves

TD: Could you talk a little about the general de
cline of civic engagement in the United States?
LF: Well, this is a controversial conclusion. Not
everyone agrees that there has been a systematic
decline in civic engagement. Civic engagement is a
nice way of entering into a thoughtful discussiorr
about how much .. . Americans as residents and
citizens take an interest in issues outside of them
selves as individuals and their individual families. I
think that that's a healthy discussion to have in any
democratic society, however limited the democra
cy might be. Americans, in terms of voting patterns
and other measures of participation in civic
affairs — organization membership, as an example
— have some of the lowest rates of any society in
what we might agree is the developed world in rea
sonably democratic societies ... I would certainly
say that, to the extent that such limited participa
tion is highly correlated with class and race and eth

nicity, it is not healthy for the society to have low
levels of participation, when those who tend to par
ticipate least tend to be individuals of lower income
and lesser education.
TD: What do you think that the administration and
students can do to increase civic engagement.-'
Fraga: I'm not sure that any university wants a very
high level of civic engagement among students on
its campus if it leads to subsequent criticism of uni
versity policy or practice. It seems to me that any in
stitution wouldn't want to do that, the university
being no exception. However, [I think] the univer
sity has a responsibility, should its students express
an interest in engaging in activity of this sort, to
make sure that they are fully educated and fully
aware of what the reality is. That's hard for univer
sities to do ... So the university has a responsibility
to train its students to be fully able to engage civi
cally, but not necessarily to engage with the univer
sity in that particular fashion. It's a judgment that
the university has to make. Certainly, [Stanford] is
very supportive in faculty teaching courses on just
about anything they want that is of appropriate
academic caliber, scholarly caliber.
Among students ... I think among one of the
main things that can be done is for students to take
more responsibility to engage in discussions of the
issues of the day in their private moments with
their classmates and with their dormmates and
roommates. To make it part of the custom, in addi
tion to having one's down time and private time . ..
to also have a commitment to some public time to
learn about issues of the day. Students do that all

"The university has a responsibility to
train its students to be fully able to
engage civically..

the time and have done that all the time and some
dorms have organized programs to do that... It
would be nice if this became part of the accepted
and traditional culture.
I D: That's all the questions that I have. Is there
anything you want to add?
Fraga: If you look at public opinion polls that track
[Americans' faith in public officials] over the period
of the '80s and '90s, one sees a steady decline. I get
very concerned about what the implications are of
fewer and fewer citizens trusting public authority
and those who hold it, because if there is a major
issue of concern that arises, it seems to me there
isn't any other entity to address it other than those
who hold public authority. But, if we don't trust
them, then we have a very low set of expectations as
to what it is that they can accomplish. I see this as a
potential downward spiral to make those who are
politically and economically comfortable to with
draw from accepting responsibility to try to en
hance opportunity for those who might be much
less politically and economically comfortable.
TD: Do you think that at the same time there has to
be a certain balance between trusting governmen
tal figures and also having a healthy skepticism of
the things that they say?
Fraga: Provided our expectations do not drop so
low that the distrust leads to a lowering of expecta
tions of what it is people can d 0.... [Skepticism
is]questioning, it's asking, it's finding out. Distrust,
it seerns to me, is a more systematic lowering of ex
pectations: "I don't care what they say, I don't be
lieve them." And one decides that everyone is
telling half-truths and therefore there's no reason
for you to try to influence who may be
there . .. That I see as something that in the long
term cannot be healthy for any society.
Luis Fraga is an associate professor of political
science whose research interests including voting
rights policy and urban politics and policy. He will
be teaching a class this spring on "Civic Capacity
and Urban Youth," and spoke yesterday in a panel
about political involvement as part of Civic En
gagement Week. The Daily sat down with Fraga to
