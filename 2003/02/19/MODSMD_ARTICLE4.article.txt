# ASSU senators endorse affirmative action policy
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Affirmative action — specifically Univer
sity President John Hennessy's recent dec
laration in support of it — was the major
issue for last night's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting. Culminating many weeks
of debate on the subject, the Senate passed
a resolution endorsing Hennessy's state
ment with 11 senators voting for the resolu
tion, none voting against it and one senator
abstaining.
In past weeks, the possibility of address
ing the affirmative action issue, made cur
rent by the U.S. Supreme Court case in
volving the University of Michigan, had
been repeatedly debated in the Senate. Last
week, the Senate decided to elicit communi
ty responses by inviting students to take an
online poll or come to last night's meeting

and voice their opinions.
However, the online poll was compro
mised to an extent when the results were in
fluenced by responses from students out
side of Stanford after sophomore Joe Fair
banks, a writer for The Stanford Review
and co-president of (he Stanford College
Republicans, posted a link to the poll on a
conservative Web site. The ASSU poll had
no safeguard to keep people outside of
Stanford from voting or to prevent people
from voting multiple times.
However, some senators lelt the poll was
still useful.
"The poll was something we voted on —
we all knew that it wouldn't be fan accurate]
statistical representation of the state of [the]
community," said senator Josh Shipp, a
sophomore. "1 think the poll was effective in
what it was meant to do, and that is
[to] solicit input."
Before discussion began on the
resolution, ASSU President Moni
ca Henestroza, who arrived late
due to illness, gave a brief presen
tation on the issues at stake. Hene
stroza outlined the history of affir
mative action, from the 1978 Re
gents of the University of Califor
nia v. Bakke case — which de
clared quotas unconstitutional but
affirmed the legality of considering
race and ethnicity as factors — to
the recent University of Michigan
case. In this case, protests were
brought against the point system
of admissions, in which race is al
lotted a certain number of points
in favor of admission. Michigan
claims that these policies are aimed
to achieve a critical mass of under
represented students, while those
against the policies challenge them
as discriminatory and unconstitu
tional.
In light of President George
W. Bush's statement against af
firmative action, Hennessy is

sued a statement reading, "We
remain committed to affirmative
action, to the importance of di
versity broadly defined, and to
the principles set forth in the
Supreme Court's 1978 decision
in the Bakke case as practical
and appropriate means to
achieve such diversity."
An amicus curae, or friend of
the court, brief was filed recently
on behalf of Stanford and other
peer institutions supporting affir
mative action in higher educa
tion.
After the Senate presentation last
night, open comments were heard
from the roughly 60 people — sen
ators, students and community
members — who had come to the
meeting. Many of the senators ini
tially questioned the role of t he Sen
ate in passing this bill.
"I myself support affirmative
action, but I'm not sure if the Sen
ate is in the place of taking a stand
like this for the student body," said
Senator Joey Natoli, a sophomore.
Other community members
had different concerns.
"I think that by responding to
something that [Hennessy] did we
are compromising our own indepen
dence," said senior Sumir Meghani.

Some questioned the authority
of the senators to pass political res
olutions.
"Most of you [senators] ran on
campaign platforms that did not in
clude affirmative action," Fairbanks
said. "If you adopt this resolution
because you think that you have the
power to make political opinions,
where is your opinion on Iraq, or
other hot button political issues?"
Still others encouraged further
discussion.
"I think that the Senate should
acknowledge that there is a diversi
ty of opinion and embrace the di
versity of students," said sopho
more class co-President Paul
Wilkins.
However, as the meeting con
tinued, more points in favor of the
bill were raised. As far as the legiti
macy of Senate involvement,
ASSU bylaws were cited as only
prohibiting Senate activity in "mat
ters not directly affecting Stanford
students."
"This is a bill to endorse Presi
dent Hennessy's statement," said
senator Howie Chiou, a sopho
more. "It has affirmative action
stuff in it, but it also has a lot of stuff
in it about Stanford and how it af
fects us."

Added Senator Sarah Schul
man, a sophomore, "It is our job to
stand up for issues, especially the
divisive ones."
Many other students offered
their support for Senate action.
"Diversity is important and is a
way of life at this University," said
senior Crystal Maglio. "I think to
not support this would not support
how things are here at Stanford."
Added freshman Theresa John
son, "When I elect people, I want
them to represent me totally, not
just on a specific issue. You do have
the autonomy to make this deci
sion."
In the end, the senators voted
for the bill, with amendments
noting that the Senate encour
ages students to form and voice
their own opinions. A letter will
be sent to Hennessy noting the
ASSU support for his statement.
In other business, the Elec
tions Commission will hold an in
formational meeting for all
prospective candidates in the up
coming election in Terman 353
this Thursday. Also, all general
fee requests need to be in within
the next two weeks, as further re
quests will be cut off due to de
creasing funds.
