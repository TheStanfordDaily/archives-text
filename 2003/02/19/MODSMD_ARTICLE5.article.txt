# Students debate merits of affirmative action decision
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student opinion concerning affirma
tive action does not seem as uniform as the
nearly unanimous vote last night by the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate to pass a res
olution supporting University President
John Hennessy's statement reaffirming
the use of race as a factor in admission de
cisions would imply.
"I think that affirmative action is neces
sary in some form, for students have over
come obstacles and difficulties to get into
an institution like Stanford," said senior
Anne Cortina. "But it should be done in a
way that doesn't appear to disadvantage
others."
Sophomore Ryan Wisnesky supports a
merit-based admissions process.
"Any judgment of a person based on
the color of their skin is shallow and even
racist," he said.
A junior who wanted to remain anony

mous disagreed. He argued that universi
ties should be allowed to judge applicants
in any ways necessary to choose their in
coming classes.
"The admissions process is completely
subjective to begin with," he said. "They
have been given the authority to choose
the best applicants. Universities have al
ways been in the business of social engi
neering and they should be allowed to
pursue this.
"The University goal is to create a di
verse group of national leaders and this is
an admirable goal. Top universities have
95 percent graduation rates and it is these
students who go on to become national
leaders. These policies help us create a
more egalitarian society," he concluded.
The officers of the various political
groups had extremely polarized views on
the issue of affirmative action.
"Admissions officers are encouraged
to indulge racist stereotypes
rather than combat them; this is
why affirmative action as a com
prehensive policy is doomed to
failure," said Piotr H. Kosicki,
editor in chief of The Stanford
Review.
"Labeling students according to
demographic classifications re
trenches stereotypical assump
tions and begets commensurate
behavior. All applications should
be considered equally, and diver
sity should be revealed through
ideas and presentation, not
through demographic nomen
clature."
Stanford NAACP President
David Lytle, a junior, argued,
"The point of affirmative action is
to recognize that there are these
discrepancies and to attempt to
even the playing field so that we
uphold on the basic tenements of
this country 'All men are created
equal.' "
Despite strong support for
Hennessy's statement among
members of the ASSU Seriate,

many students disapproved of the
Senate passing the resolution.
Sophomore Will Hudson,
chief financial officer of the Col
lege Republicans, said, "What
was passed tonight by the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate is both
depressing from the point of view
of those persons in favor of true
equality and those interested in a
student government whose role
in the community is more re
sponsible."
He continued, "By endorsing
President Hennessy's letter, the
Undergraduate Senate has also
endorsed the point system used
by Michigan, and this point sys
tem is both illegal and contrary to
the stated purpose of Stanford's
admission criteria. The Senate's
insensitivity to this issue is, in my
opinion, irresponsible and an
abuse of the Stanford undergrad
uate community's faith in the
Senate."
Wisnesky said, "I thought that
the ASSU was supposed to be [an J
apolitical body, and I am con
cerned when I see that this not
the case."
But many students in the Stan
ford community have mixed
opinions about affirmative action.
