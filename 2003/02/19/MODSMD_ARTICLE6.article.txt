Emphasizing that he was speaking not as an aca
demic, but as a Jewish person, Religious Studies
Prof. Arnold Eisen addressed an audience largely
comprised of Jewish community members last night
about issues personally important to him.
"I am not here to replicate a classroom environ
ment," Eisen said in his opening remarks in Kimball
Lounge. "I have no intention of striving for objec
tivity or balance. I am here to talk about issues that
1 care about, issues that really matter to me."
According to Eisen, Jewish people cannot survive
without a Jewish state.
"All major figures of Zionism came to this con
clusion," he said. "And unfortunately they were cor
rect. The Holocaust proves this beyond the shadow
of a doubt."
Eisen asserted his conviction that "were it not for
Israel, small Jewries that exist around the world
today would not exist." He continued, "Were it not
for Israel, the Jewish community could not have
picked itself up in the 1950s after the devastation of
the Ilolocaust. The bottom line is that I am not will
ing to entertain any notion of not having a Jewish
state. 1 want to live in the world, and I want to live
in it as a Jew, and I question my ability to live in the
world, let alone thrive in it, without Israel."
Nevertheless, Eisen said he detests the line of
thinking in which Jewish people are encouraged to
support Israel as "an insurance policy" — a safe
guard against anti-Semitism in the United States —
because it devalues the "unique blessing" that is the
United States and teaches Jews to
value Israel for the wrong rea
sons.
Eisen readily acknowledged
that understanding the history of
Israel and of Judaism itself is not
uncomplicated.
"It is a struggle, and it involves
a lot of wrestling," he said. "It is a
voyage of discovery that you em
bark on. It enriches your life, it
makes it deep, it makes you
weighty, but it also makes your
life very difficult because it makes
you take life so seriously."
According to Eisen, the future
of Israel will likewise involve
struggle. Eisen is an advocate of a
Jewish democratic state in which
religion will be separate from the
government. Yet, he recognized
that, "Israel has serious internal
challenges and we can't avoid
them." In order to have a work
ing democratic state in Israel,
Eisen said he believes that it is
necessary to accept criticisms of

"I want to live in the
world, and I want to live
in it as a Jew y and I ques
tion my ability to live in
the world, let alone thrive
in it, without Israel"

Judaism in Israel.
"Israel is a human project and,
like all human projects, it has its
failures," he said. However, he
said he does not believe that these
mistakes undermine the justifica
tion fora Jewish sovereign state.
Despite his strong convictions
about Israel and Judaism, Eisen
stated that he values criticisms
from colleagues and students
alike. Quoting from John Stuart
Mill's essay "On Liberty," Eisen
encouraged the audience to en
gage in dialogue and respect op
posing opinions.
Making an example of his rela
tionship to History Prof. Joel

Beinin, whose opinions on Israel
he said directly contradict his
own, Eisen stated "Even though
our views are pretty much dia
metrically opposed, it doesn't
mean that I respect him any less."
Being a Jewish supporter of Is
rael should "never make you
afraid for one second that you
have to shut down your mind,"
he said.
The discussion, titled "A Con
versation on Connecting with Is
rael," was co-sponsored by Hillel
and the Stanford Israel Alliance.
Senior Tali Golan, co-president
of the Stanford Israel Alliance,
stated that the intended purpose
of the discussion was to engage
students and educate people who
are "struggling with how to grap
ple with what is currently going
on in Israel."
Some students felt that the
program was educational.
"A lot of these questions were
ones that I hadn't thought about
before," said senior Henry Tows
ner, who said that the idea of a de
mocratic, secular Jewish state was
interesting, but added that he
wasn't convinced in its practicality.
