whether public universities can consid

selective law schools to speak up about
the impact the case will have at law
schools throughout the country," said
Stanford law student Alexis Karteron.
"These schools provide a gateway to
positions of power in our society that
cannot be replicated in any other way.
Highly selective law schools have a
public mission to educate leaders for
all of society."
