# Law students submit amicus brief to Supreme Court

### ANN CHIN 
The Black Law Students Associa
tions of Stanford, Harvard and Yale
Law Schools submitted an amicus brief
to the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday
that defended the University of Michi
gan Law School's affirmative action
policy, which will be reviewed in Grut
ter v. Bollinger this spring. The case is
being billed as the most important af
firmative action case since the 1978 Re
gents of the University of California v.

Bakke, which established lhat universi
ties could employ race in making ad
missions decisions but could not estab
lish racial quotas.
Fifty-four other higher education
associations took a similar stance to
that of the Stanford, Harvard and
Yale BLSAs in a brief filed last Friday.
The BLSAs are chapters of the Na
tional Black Law Students Association,
a nonprofit organization aimed at pro
moting the professional needs and
goals of black law students. They began

writing the friend-of-the-court brief in
December to alert the Supreme Court
of the profound implications of the af
firmative action case, which will decide
whether public universities can consid
er race as a factor at all in making ad
missions decisions.
Although the University of Michi
gan is a public school, the BLSAs felt
that the outcome of the case would
have drastic effects on private univer
sities as well.
"It was important for students at

selective law schools to speak up about
the impact the case will have at law
schools throughout the country," said
Stanford law student Alexis Karteron.
"These schools provide a gateway to
positions of power in our society that
cannot be replicated in any other way.
Highly selective law schools have a
public mission to educate leaders for
all of society."
The use of affirmative action poli-
cies in graduate admissions ad
dress vastly different challenges
than those of undergraduate ad
missions, representatives from
BLSAs said. Admissions to top
graduate and professional
schools tend to provide more op
portunities for leadership in
legal, political and social spheres.
In fact, eight of the nine Supreme
Court justices that will decide the
Michigan case earned their de
grees from Stanford, Harvard or
Yale law schools.
The brief argues that main
taining racial diversity is essential
for people to feel that they have
equal access to the judicial system
and other areas of influence. Mi
norities are still disproportion
ately represented in underprivi
leged communities, and the Uni

versity of Michigan therefore be
lieves that encouraging diversity
in its schools qualifies as a com
pelling interest and justifies its
current policies.
"Affirmative action is critical to
the mission of law schools and to
having a meaningful representa
tion of historically disadvantaged
minorities at the most competi
tive law schools," said Yale Law
student Travis Leßlanc.
"Removing race from consid
eration at highly selective schools
would impose the figurative glass
ceiling on the progress of minor
ity communities," he explained.
"Like most Americans, I eager
ly look forward to the day when
universities and employers no
longer need to consider race as
one factor in the admission or hir
ing of prospective students or em
ployees," he added afterwards.
"However, today, we have not
progressed enough to justify a de
parture from affirmative action."
