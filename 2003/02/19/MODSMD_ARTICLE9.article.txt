Freshman Rocio Cardenas wasn't expect
ing to greet a team of 15 traje tie charro-clad
mariachi singers sporting guitars, violins,
flutes, trumpets and guitarrones outside her
door last Friday night.
"I was completely shocked," a bewildered
Cardenas said afterwards. "I have no idea
how my friend in Texas found out about this.
My guess is the Internet."
In honor of Valentine's Day, two Stan
ford University singing groups, the Mendi
cants and Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford,
traveled all over campus to serenade
boyfriends, girlfriends, dormitories and de
partment meetings. Everything went re
markably well — barring the occasional
screaming baby and one mysterious door
slamming incident.
The three standard songs in the Mendi
cants' Valentine repertoire were "Hooked on
a Feeling," "Dream Lover" and "Brown-Eyed
Girl" — or "Blue-eyed girl," with advanced
warning. Their most popular package in
cludes one song, a rose and a Polaroid photo.
They traditionally sing from 6 a.m. to mid
night.
Mariachi Cardenal performed "Cuando
Saiga la Luna," "Serenata Huasteca" and
"Cien Arios" wearing the customary traje de
charro.
Sophomore Graham Anderson-Dana, di
rector of the Mendicants, described how
many of the group members were exhausted
when they began their 18-hour singing
marathon.
"We got to Roble at 5:15 a.m. to prepare
fora 6 o'clock show," Anderson-Dana ex
plained. "Two of the guys had pulled all
nighters for work."

Junior lan Hepworth, business manager
of the Mendicants, pointed out that the morn
ing can be "a logistical nightmare." When en
tire dorms are asleep, climbing in through
bathroom windows and banging on doors are
often a necessity.
In the past, the Mendicants have had to
face other logistical disasters — members
with Valentine's Day mid-terms, five-hour
chemistry labs and 9 a.m. I-Hum sections.
This year, one Mendicant had to dash off to a
track meet in Seattle at 9:20.
"We made him sing the solo to "Brown
Eyed Girl" for three hours straight before he
left," Anderson-Dana said. "He saved our
voices that morning."
The Mariachis have also had their share of
worries.
"We were so lucky it didn't rain this year,"
said Linda Hodes-Villamar. "If it had rained,
we would have had to do all our perfor
mances inside. We had tuners and did need
to tune the wood instruments a couple of
times throughout the day. But no broken
strings — that happened today in rehearsal.
Marisol Castillo, a flautist in Mariachi Car
denal, griped about the clothing.
"The trajes were really constraining and
the high heel boots were so uncomfortable,"
she said. "I was so tired afterwards I couldn't
feel my feet."
All of the hard work paid off in the end.
Undergraduates, graduate students and fac
ulty alike enjoyed the performances of the two
groups. Those serenaded frequently joined in
singing, or in the case of Mariachi Cardenal,
danced along.
"We serenaded the third floor of Okada
and by the end had all the guys singing,"
Hodes-Villamar said. "It wasn't anything too
complicated —just la la la la la. But it was hi

larious."
When Mariachi Cardenal serenaded one
professor under her balcony, her response
was "Happy Valentine's Day forever," Castil
lo said.
Cardenas also enjoyed her serenade.
"It was something I'd always wanted," she
said. "My dad serenaded my mom when they
were going out and I thought it sounded so
sweet."
One Mendicant alum orchestrated a spe
cial production. He wrote a song for his girl
friend and had the background played over a
loud-speaker in Wilbur Dining Hall as he per
formed the solo. The Mendicants joined in
singing and, along with audience members
eating lunch, handed her roses.
Both groups added last-minute perfor
mances to their already full schedules —
Mariachi Cardenal sang until 1:30 a.m. in
stead of midnight and the Mendicants gave
an impromptu performance to a tourist
group.
"I think we might have recruited a couple
of guys for next year," Hepworth joked.
Exhausted, hoarse and cranky, members
of Mariachi Cardenal and the Mendicants
opted not to celebrate after the Valentine's
Day serenading was over.
"Most of us just crashed," Hepworth said.
Both groups are now gearing up for Par
ents' Weekend Performances. Hodes-Villa
mar emphasized that last Friday's singing has
helped strengthen group unity.
"It got all of us excited about the rest of the
year," she said.
Hepworth agreed that serenading
brought the Mendicants closer together.
"As long and exhausting as it is, it's a bond
ing experience. And every year we've man
aged to avoid a fist fight," Hepworth added,
laughing.
