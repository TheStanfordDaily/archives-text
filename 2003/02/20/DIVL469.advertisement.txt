Gunshots in My Cook-Up: Bits and
Bites from a Hip-Hop Caribbean Life
by Selwyn Seyfu Hinds
Thursday, February 20, 2003
7pm • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
As a former editor-in-chief of
hip-hop magazine the Source
and a fan since he was a
nine-year-old living in
Guyana, Hinds knows hip-hop
as well as any journalist
around. This account is part
memoir, part behind the
music: we get days in the life
of Puffy, Lauryn Hill at the
Grammys and guerrilla tour
ing with the Wu-Tangs.
We get Hinds's writerly
woodshedding at Princeton
and the Village Voice, the rise
of the Source, sweaty clubs in
Brooklyn and the escalation
of the East Coast-West Coast
feud until two of rap's super
stars, Tupac and Biggie Smalls,
are lost. An excellent story
teller, Hinds can write with
equal intensity about his little
brother's aspiration to be an
MC, hiring an intern to go
through "the Wack Box" or
hurtling down the highway
with Raekwon and Ghostface.
Even though he knows it's
business, Hinds's book works
because he still believes in the
power of this new, brash and
still-not-fully charted art: this
is a fan's memoir first, and a
journalist's chronicle second.
