### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To teach students about their
role in social movements and alter
natives to war, Martin Luther King
Jr.'s message of nonviolent protest
was applied to the contemporary
anti-war movement at a vigil for
peace and justice last night.
During the ceremony, present
ed by the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Papers Project and Bay Area Vet
erans for Peace, a packed Memor
ial Church listened to a dramatic
reading based on King's writings,
speeches and sermons that was
written by History Prof, and Pa
pers Project Director Clayborne
Carson. Aldo Billingslea, an assis
tant professor of acting and per
formance studies at Santa Clara
University, performed the read
ings.
Officially entitled "A Time to
Break the Silence: Martin Luther
King, Jr. on War and Peace," the
event was produced by Reverend
Bob Herhold, a veteran who
served in World War II as an army
chaplain and who stood alongside
King during the 1965 Selma-
Montgomery March.
"Thank you for your devotion
to justice and peace in a time when
it is so desperately needed," said
Dean of Religious Life Scott
McLennan in his opening address.
Social activist Joan Baez, a per
sonal acquaintance of King who
has worked for peaceful protest
since the 19605, then performed a
song for the audience from the
civil rights movement.
Afterwards, Billingslea per
formed a variety of readings, rang
ing from sermons to autobio

graphical statements, in the char
acter of King.
According to the event's coordi
nators, readings were specifically
selected to show the relevance of
King's pacifism to the potential
war in Iraq.
"The choice today is no longer
between violence and nonvio
lence, it is between nonviolence
and nonexistence," Billingslea
read. "We must find an alternative
to war and destruction."
Many parallels were drawn be

tween the current situation and
the war in Vietnam, which King
preached strongly against.
"A time comes when silence is
betrayal," Billingslea read to a
cheering audience. "And that time
has come for us."
The performance attacked is
sues relevant to both Vietnam and
Iraq, including the protection of
overseas investments and the pro
liferation of weapons of mass de
struction.
The readings conveyed thecen

tral theme of nonviolent protest,
invoking the methods of the civil
rights movement.
"The nonviolent approach
doesn't immediately change the
heart of the oppressor," Billingslea
said. "[But] unarmed troops and
unconditional love will have the
last word."
Billingslea received a standing
ovation following his emotional
performance
"Veterans for Peace come from
all ages and all directions," said
Harlow Williams, a marine corps
veteran from Vietnam who cur
rently resides in Palo Alto. "I want
to educate young people so they
don't end up like I did."
Both Williams and George
Johnson, a navy veteran from
Vietnam, became involved in the
coordination of last night's pro
gram to prevent the nation's youth
from suffering through the atroci
ties that they witnessed during
their military careers.
"You don't have to have blood
on your hands to participate in
killing people," Johnson said.
"Looking at the leaders who
mislead us makes me furious,"
Williams said, "I think [President
George W. Bush] is proposing pre
meditated murder."
McLennan added, "I think it is
critical that we listen to the words
of a great prophet of the times like
King. They're more relevant in
this time than ever."
The event was attended by stu
dents, faculty, veterans and fami
lies from the University and sur
rounding communities. Contribu
tions were collected for the Papers
Project, Veterans for Peace and
Habitat for Humanity.
