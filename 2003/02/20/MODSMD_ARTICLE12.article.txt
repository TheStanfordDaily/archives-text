Student coalition puts ad protesting war in New
York Times
Almost 400 students and faculty from eight California law schools
placed an anti-war advertisement in the New York Times last week.
"The basic point of the ad was to contrast the Bush administration's
domestic and international actions in the war on terrorism with the val
ues of civil liberties and international law that we learn in law school,"
said Stanford law student Shirin Sinnar. "And to point to how far this ad
ministration has gone in betraying all those principles."
The campaign was initiated by the UC-Berkeley Law School, which
recruited support at Stanford and other California law schools. The
$18,000 advertisement was funded through student and faculty dona
tions.

Harpsichord recital at Memorial Church Monday
On Monday, sophomore Mahan Esfahani will perform solo works on
the harpsichord in a Memorial Church side gallery at 8 p.m.
"Stanford student recitals featuring the harpsichord are far and few
between," Esfahani said. "The harpsichord is occasionally used in an ac
companiment setting."
The harpsichord was the premier keyboard instrument of the Re
naissance, Baroque and Early Classical periods. The concert will feature
little-heard works by English Renaissance composers William Byrd and
John Munday, Dutch composer Jan Pieterzsoon Sweelinck, French
opera composer Jean-Philippe Rameau, along with well-known com
posers such as J.S. Bach.
"The harpsichord can be a very powerful and moving instrument,"
Esfahani said. "It's all done in the fingers; elbows are not moved and the
performer essentially stays stationary while the fingers do the work."
The harpsichord has a smaller keyboard than a piano and the strings are
plucked with quills instead of hammers.
Esfahani is coached by Stanford harpsichord lecturer Elaine Thorn
burgh, a noted Bay Area performer. He is also involved in the newly
found Stanford Monteverdi Collegium, a group of instrumentalists and
singers performing on 17th-century instruments. They will have an in
augural concert in Memorial Church on March 8.
University water flushing to begin Tuesday
Starting next Tuesday, the Stanford water department will begin
flushing the water pipes around campus. The flushing is an annual op
eration to clean out sediment and maintain proper pipe functions.
"Flushing the mains may cause some slight but temporary reduction
in water pressure and possible water discolorations," said Tracy Inge
brigtsen of Facilities Operations. "These are aesthetic water quality con
cerns; the water remains safe to drink." If residents experience effects of
the flushing, Ingebrigtsen advised them to open taps until the water
runs clear.
Residents of Escondido Village and Mirrielees experienced changes
in water taste in January when the pipes were flushed to remedy water
quality complaints. According to Ingebrigtsen, the water taste change
was due to a new water supply and the fact that the water had been sit
ting idle in the pipes.
"It started to taste bad, like someone had been soaking nails," said
sophomore Mirrielees resident Ruth Costa. Routine drinking water
monitoring was conducted in the area and showed compliance with
drinking water standards.
"This is a standard operating procedure by all water departments,"
Ingebrigtsen said. "Cleaning the mains on a regular basis ensures that
the disinfectant, the chlorine, can work more effectively."
For sophomore Babar Rana, a Mirrielees resident, the water taste was
not a big deal. He was more worried about what the water department
might add to the water in response to other students' complaints about
the taste.
"I've drunk water slimy with elephant urine and hippo droppings,"
he said. "I was worried what horrible chemicals the health department
might pour into the pipes."
"The taste of the stagnant water was significantly different from our
normal water taste," Ingebrigtsen said. "Since the flushing of the stag
nant water through our system we have not received any additional
complaints."
According to Ingebrigtsen, the campus drinking water disinfectant
will change from chlorine to chloramines next November.
