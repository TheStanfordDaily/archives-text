## Israeli workers receive gas masks 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli
authorities began supplying gas
masks to an estimated 300,000 for
eign workers yesterday in case a
U.S. offensive prompts an Iraqi
missile attack on Israel, and school
children jumped out windows in a
nationwide air-raid drill.
Israel has made extensive
preparations fora possible Iraqi
attack with chemical or biologi
cal weapons. In the 1991 Gulf
War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles
equipped with conventional
warheads at Israel, causing ex
tensive damage but relatively
few casualties.
At Jerusalem's Netivot Hayim
high school, car tires were set on
fire to simulate a missile strike. An

air raid siren wailed as screaming
students ran from classrooms
brandishing their gas masks —
along with backgammon boards
and dice to keep themselves occu
pied in the "safe rooms."
Two students, splattered with
fake blood and covered with ban
dages, were evacuated on stretch
ers from the school by members of
the school's rescue team. Soldiers
from Israel's Home Command
fought a strong wind to keep an es
cape chute steady as a teenager
dove head first into the chute, out a
third-floor window.
Firefighters used a crane to
evacuate "wounded" stranded on
the school's roof.
In the school's two bomb shel

ters, many students did not appear
to be familiar with the gas masks.
Still, they posed with Education
Minister Limor Livnat for pictures.
"The education system is ready,
the schools are ready, and school
will continue as usual," she said.
"The kids need to study for their
exams."
A dozen students out of the 260
at the school are part of the desig
nated rapid response emergency
team, trained in first aid and in
charge of keeping order.
Tne army's home front com
mand yesterday published ad
dresses across Israel where foreign
workers can get the masks fora
payment of a $20 fee and a further
$20 refundable deposit.
