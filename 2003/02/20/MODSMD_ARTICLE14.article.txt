OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) â€” City officials have
agreed to pay nearly $ 11 million and implement re
forms to settle civil rights lawsuits brought by more
than 100 people who claimed they were victimized
by a group of rogue police officers.
The lawsuits alleged the officers kidnapped and
beat suspects in the summer of 2000. To settle the
suit, Oakland will pay $10.9 million to the 119
plaintiffs who say the city and police department
encouraged or ignored the abuse.
"We had clients who really endured the unen
durable .. . and were patient all these years waiting
for justice to be done," said Jim Chanin, one of the
attorneys who represented the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson ap
proved the settlement Jan. 22 afier 18 months of
negotiations. The settlement was under seal until

Tuesday night.
"We did not bury our heads in the sand," City At
torney John Russo said. "We acknowledged freely
our faults, and we've worked arm in arm toward
fixing the problem rather than hiding from or
denying the problem."
Some of the changes proposed for the Oakland
Police Department include establishing a hot line to
report police abuse and internal affairs investiga
tions. An outside monitor will be named to a five
year term to ensure the reforms are implemented.
Police Chief Richard Word said the changes
will create "an environment in which supervisors
and managers know they're going to be held ac
countable."
He added: "It wasn't easy. We yelled and had
words exchanged, but we worked this out."
