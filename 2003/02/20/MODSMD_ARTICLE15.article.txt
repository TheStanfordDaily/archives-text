# Presidential hopefuls enter race

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Only
a scorecard will help the voters sort
through the growing field of pres
idential hopefuls as one Democrat
announced his candidacy yester
day and two others filed papers to
create exploratory committees.
The current count is eight with the
prospect of more joining the race
in the coming weeks.
On the day Missouri Rep. Dick
Gephardt announced his bid, for
mer Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley-
Braun and Ohio Rep. Dennis
Kucinich filed formal papers with
the Federal Election Commission
that will allow them to raise
money fora possible campaign.
They join five candidates who
have either announced or filed

with the FEC: former Vermont
Gov. Howard Dean, North Car
olina Sen. John Edwards, Massa
chusetts Sen. John Kerry, Con
necticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and
the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Political observers said the
crowded field also makes it diffi
cult for the Democrats to put forth
a single message, especially in con
trast to the one voice coming from
the White House.
"It creates a kind of mass confu
sion in which it's much harder for
the party to coalesce around one
candidate. It takes a lot longer to
sharpen the debate," said Norman
Ornstein, an analyst at the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute.
Speaking to reporters yester

day, Moseley-Braun, 55, described
herself as a "peace dove and a bud
get hawk." She criticized the Bush
administration for its push for war
against Iraq, arguing that the poli
cy had alienated allies and "frit
tered away" the good will overseas
that the nation had engendered
after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11. She also called Bush's pro
posed tax cuts and budget deficits
"a wimpy tax policy," using an in
sult often directed at Bush's father.
Moseley-Braun served one
term in the Senate, losing her bid
for re-election in 1998. She was
criticized for splitting an inheri
tance from her mother that
should have gone to reimburse
Medicaid.
