## The
						Stanford Daily Combatting intolerance 
### 
Editorial

While we are certainly aware
about the many crimes
motivated by hate, intoler
ance or prejudice commit
ted around the world, we sometimes for
get that the Stanford campus — a place
where diversity and tolerance are cele
brated — is not immune to these kinds of
transgressions.
On Jan. 25, while peacefully rafting
on Lake Lagunita and listening to
music, a group of four Stanford female
students became victims of an act of in
tolerance. The students said that a
group of unidentified individuals gath
ered on the shore and began to shout
racist remarks. For an hour and 30 min
utes, the four female students tried to ig
nore the threatening comments, but
grew apprehensive as they waited for
their aggressors to leave so that they
could report the incident.
It is certainly not the first time that
an act of intolerance has occurred at the
Farm. The campus has been witness to
many hate crimes over its long history,
ranging from offensive graffiti to hate
e-mails sent to students following the
Sept. 11 attacks. In 2001, the Office of
Student Affairs, led by Asst. Dean of
Students and Multicultural Educator
Tommy Lee Woon, developed and in
stituted the Protocol for Addressing
Acts of Intolerance and Threats to the
Community. The protocol defined a se
ries of systematic steps for responding
to acts of intolerance that took place on
campus or that were directed at Stan
ford students and faculty.
Although the Fundamental Standard
holds students to an institutional honor
code, it was seen as "inadequate as a
means for preventing or addressing the
impact of random and anonymous acts
of intolerance," according to the proto
col. The protocol was thus developed to
educate the staff of the Office of Student
Affairs to prevent, detect and manage
acts of intolerance on campus in a struc
tured and operative manner.
One of the key points of the protocol
was to establish a series of prevention
strategies to avoid these harmful acts
from ever taking place. These strategies
include promoting awareness among the
staff of the Office of Student Affairs about
the guidelines of the protocol, making
clear and visible affirmations of respect
and tolerance in the classrooms and in
the resiciences, providing and teaching
options for addressing conflicts between

students or groups and routinely review
ing the protocol and reporting to the
community any acts of intolerance, re
minding students and faculty to be aware
of such situations.
While these principles for preven
tion have been fairly effective in insti
tuting an atmosphere of tolerance and
acceptance on campus, individuals
outside of the campus do not neces
sarily adhere to such values. When
these individuals step onto campus
grounds, such as the group that
shouted insults across the lake to the
students on that fateful January day,
students may not be adequately pre
pared to deal with such attacks. After
the incident, some of them reported
that they "didn't know about the pro
tocol," and were unsure about what to
do after the incident.
The prevention strategies outlined in
the protocol have been well-thought out
and developed, but, unfortunately, their
implementation has not been complete.
Aside from a few discussions and presen
tations in freshman dorms during Orien
tation week, acts of intolerance and how
to manage them are not often discussed
within the Stanford community. In order
for the protocol to serve its purpose, stu
dents need to be aware that it exists and
that it defines the specific resources avail
able to victims or witnesses to an act of in
tolerance.
We propose that the OlFice of Student
Affairs, in conjunction with Residential
Education and the community centers,
develop workshops and education pro
grams to increase awareness both about
acts of intolerance in and outside of cam
pus, as well as how to effectively manage
such acts when they do take place. These
workshops need to be offered to students
of all years — including graduate stu
dents —to insure that everyone feels
safe or, at the very least, prepared, for
such unfortunate acts. While holding
discussions on these issues may be un
comfortable, it is necessary to ensure that
students are conscious about these acts
and will know how to appropriately react
during a threatening situation.
By instituting workshops and discus
sions, we hope that students and faculty
will engage in an ongoing dialogue to ac
complish the intended goal of the proto
col: to make community members aware
of and equipped to manage acts of intol
erance, both during their time at Stan
ford and after their departure.
