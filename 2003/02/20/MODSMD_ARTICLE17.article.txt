# THE

## One-sided conversations 
### 
It's funny how the isolation we
find in our own lives some
times manifests itself on a
global level.
Wednesday afternoon I re
ceived the call. Friday morning I
met with the rest of my family.
Dark shades, dark suits, gray sky.
Dirt shoveled on the casket and my
grandmother's life came to its sym
bolic end.
Bertha, my grandmother, was
never there for me growing up; no
phone calls, birthday parties or
babysitting. More than 30 years
ago her husband died, she turned
cold.
1 didn't cry at the funeral. What
struck me the most, however, was
the sad wisdom I found in the con
versation I had with my father as
we walked back to our car.
"I remember Bertha," he said,
"as a different woman than the one
I had come to know over the last
30 years. I'm not thinking back to
yesterday; I'm thinking back to
1970, before the pain of my fa
ther's death changed the way she
approached life altogether. The
Bertha we mourned today had
passed away years ago."
All I know is that the sadness,
constant cynicism and pain that
my grandmother exuded during
my entire lifetime is something
that no human being should ever
have to experience. In the guise of
books and nightly news, she re
placed genuine human contact
with a one-sided conversation.
On my way home, I crossed
over the Golden Gate Bridge and
glanced over to my right to notice
the brilliant San Francisco skyline
illuminating the night. In the
midst of all that hustle and bustle,
how many people were living their
lives as a one-way conversation?
Regardless of financial status or
the number of friends in one's so

cial circle, how many people out
there are speaking only to them
selves?
How many out there are speak
ing of what needs to be done? It's
this approach to life that I feel is
often lacking in the whirlwind
world we live in today, where I tra
verse the globe in days, but never
really have to engage myself in di
alogue with others.
When this nation was founded,

the masses crowd
ed together, not
under the banner
of self-interest,
but rather as part
of a collective
voice that cried
out for the neces
sity of a nation
that engages in

conversation and dialogue. Differ
ent voices, different ethnicities, we
all know the story.
But today, I feel that more often
than not, U.S. foreign policy in
creasingly resembles a one-sided
conversation.
On one hand, I see that there
are many reasons to justify this.
Yes, we are the most powerful na
tion in the world. Yes, we do hold
freedom and justice as ideals. Yes,
we are acting in the name of world
stability and peace.
But stop fora moment. I believe
that the reason we have become so
divisibly torn over the last half year
is that no one is certain of the de
sires and motivations of t he actors
making the decisions.
Why does Washington really
want to go to war?
Pro-War: It's because politi
cians want what's best for the Unit
ed States and for the world —
peace and the elimination of ter
rorism.
Anti-War: We don't think Iraq
is a serious threat for the United

States, but somehow secondary in
terests have become tangled into
our foreign policy.
And so the question remains —
is Washington approaching the
world through conversation or
declaration? To what extent
should France, Germany and the
rest of world opinion affect our
policy goals at the opening of the
21st century? If we're creating a
new precedent of proactive diplo
macy, we'd better be damn self
confident.
This is perhaps the heaviest
question all of us must grapple
with right now, and I for one
haven't made up my mind.
But one thing that is clear for
me now is that the sad, cruel and
intolerable one-sided conversation
trickles down from Washington to
campus, and we can begin to
change it by changing ourselves.
Had the White House's inten
tions been clear to both U.S. citi
zens and the world, perhaps we
could have garnered the United
Nation's support for our actions.
Had international dialogue and
consensus been higher priority is
sues during the 2000 elections,
perhaps foreign affairs would have
been emphasized in both the Gore
and Bush campaigns. Perhaps
after Sept. 11, a better-connected
United States would have received
unconditional support from many
more nations around the world.
Had I known the extent of the
animosity that much of the world
harbors toward the U.S. at what
are perceived to be only self-moti
vated actions, perhaps I would
have begun conversing with oth
ers more last year.
But both my grandmother
and I — though just two-hours
away — were having one-sided
