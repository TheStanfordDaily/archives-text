'Anti-Semitism is still alive and
well in this world today 7
I completely disagree with Thomas
Taylor's letter to the editor, "Link between
anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment?"
(Feb. 19), which makes the claim that anti-
Israel sentiment is "simply disagreeing
with the actions of Israel as a whole."
To be critical of Israeli policy does not
mean that one is "anti-Israel." A person
can disagree with particular policies of the
Israeli government or the Israeli Defense
Forces, yet still agree that the Jewish state
of Israel should exist and support the fu
ture of that state and its people.
"Anti-Israel" sentiment is the idea that
Israel never had the right to exist in the
first place and the rejection of its exis
tence today. In many instances, "anti-Is
rael" feelings are truly a projection of
anti-Semitic opinions. Is it not racism to
deny one people the same right to self
determination that other groups are af
forded?
At one of the largest anti-Israel rallies in
Washington D C. in April 2002, many of
the speakers called for the elimination of
Israel. One representative from a national

Muslim organization felt that Israel should
never have been created and that it should
be destroyed and said, "We need to bring
Palestine back to 1947!" and "Israel must
go!" (Anti-Defamation League archives).
This is more than mere criticism of Israel.
It is an attack against Jews and the right of
the Jewish people to have a state.
By using Taylor's logic, am I also to as
sume that when my peers at San Francisco
State University were confronted last year
all over campus with anti-Israel posters
reading, "Palestinian Children Meat:
Slaughtered According to Jewish Rites
Under American Licensing," that this was
just legitimate criticism of Israel and not
an assault on Jews? How about when the
site of new dorms at UC - Santa Barbara
was defiled with graffiti which included
the phrases: "Anti Zion/Nuke Israel,"
"God Hates Jews" and "Burn the Torah"
(AI)L archives)?
Do not be mistaken. Anti-semitism is
still alive and well in this world today, even
in America. In many instances, although
not all, it is taking the form of anti-Israel
protest. Stanford students should recog
nize this fact and not simply excuse all anti-
Israel attitudes as legitimate when many
are based on bigotry.

Advertisement signers should 'support
the many Israeli peace advocates'
It's too bad that the Stanford Israel Al
liance's advertisement in The Daily (Feb.
18), which supported Israel's light to exist
within safe and secure borders, didn't also
support a similar right for Palestinians. I
wonder how many of those who signed the
advertisement are aware that three million
Palestinians are currently confined behind
checkpoints and roadblocks, unable to
travel between villages, or go to work or to
school, or tend their crops, or in many
cases even get to a hospital. How many of
the signers know that the Israeli army has
destroyed whole sections of Hebron,
Nablus, Jenin, and other cities, or that
thousands of Palestinians have been kept
under curfew for months on end without
adequate food or water?
The signers of the advertisement are
right to condemn Palestinian terrorism,
but I wonder if they know that Israel rou
tinely uses U.S.-made Apache helicopter
gunships to bombard crowded civilian
neighborhoods. On Tuesday, the day the
advertisement appeared in The Daily, fire
from Israeli tanks and helicopters killed 11
people in Gaza City. Israeli troops recent
ly fired flechette tanks shells, which ex
plode into thousands of razor-sharp steel

darts, into a soccer field where children
were playing. In January alone, 72 Pales
tinians were killed by Israeli gunfire, most
of them unarmed civilians and 24 of them
children. In the past two years the dead
have included United Nations relief work
ers, doctors, ambulance drivers, teachers,
the young and the old.
If the signers of the advertisement truly
want Israel to survive as a secure democra
cy, they should support the many Israeli
peace advocates who work together with
Palestinians to replant olive trees and re
build homes that have been demolished.
The Israelis who work for peace want a se
cure Israel for their children as much as
any of those who signed the advertisement.
That is why they call on their government
to stop trying to rule by force over another
people and end the occupation.

' Advising is a two-way street 7
The challenges cited in the editorial
"Helpful advice" (Feb. 18) are shared by
the advising community and the sugges
tions made are worthy of exploration. We
in the Undergraduate Advising Center
applaud The Daily's acknowledgement of

the importance of fostering successful ad
visor-advisee relationships and the key
role that these can play in helping to accli
mate freshmen to their new academic mi
lieu.
Through the training and support pro
vided to academic advisors, the UAC both
promotes and enables student connec
tions to the multitude of educational op
portunities at Stanford. Most of our volun
teer academic advisors are dedicated to
making every attempt to ensure the aca
demic success of their advisees. Of course,
no one advisor — whether faculty, staff, or
peer — can know everything about the
myriad of options of courses, majors and
research interests. That is why we assem
ble a team of advisors and peer advisors
for each freshman cohort and supplement
it with professional advisors in the UAC
and an extensive array of expanded advis
ing programs.
While it is a primary obligation of advi
sors to assist their advisees in linking to,
and taking advantage of, campus re
sources, there is a concomitant obligation
of students to seek out and cultivate con
tacts with their advisors and to follow
through on recommendations provided
by advisors. Advising is a two-way inter
