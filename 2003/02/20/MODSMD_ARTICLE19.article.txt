'Anti-Semitism is still alive and
well in this world today 7
I completely disagree with Thomas
Taylor's letter to the editor, "Link between
anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment?"
(Feb. 19), which makes the claim that anti-
Israel sentiment is "simply disagreeing
with the actions of Israel as a whole."
To be critical of Israeli policy does not
mean that one is "anti-Israel." A person
can disagree with particular policies of the
Israeli government or the Israeli Defense
Forces, yet still agree that the Jewish state
of Israel should exist and support the fu
ture of that state and its people.
"Anti-Israel" sentiment is the idea that
Israel never had the right to exist in the
first place and the rejection of its exis
tence today. In many instances, "anti-Is
rael" feelings are truly a projection of
anti-Semitic opinions. Is it not racism to
deny one people the same right to self
determination that other groups are af
forded?
At one of the largest anti-Israel rallies in
Washington D C. in April 2002, many of
the speakers called for the elimination of
Israel. One representative from a national

Muslim organization felt that Israel should
never have been created and that it should
be destroyed and said, "We need to bring
Palestine back to 1947!" and "Israel must
go!" (Anti-Defamation League archives).
This is more than mere criticism of Israel.
It is an attack against Jews and the right of
the Jewish people to have a state.
By using Taylor's logic, am I also to as
sume that when my peers at San Francisco
State University were confronted last year
all over campus with anti-Israel posters
reading, "Palestinian Children Meat:
Slaughtered According to Jewish Rites
Under American Licensing," that this was
just legitimate criticism of Israel and not
an assault on Jews? How about when the
site of new dorms at UC - Santa Barbara
was defiled with graffiti which included
the phrases: "Anti Zion/Nuke Israel,"
"God Hates Jews" and "Burn the Torah"
(AI)L archives)?
Do not be mistaken. Anti-semitism is
still alive and well in this world today, even
in America. In many instances, although
not all, it is taking the form of anti-Israel
protest. Stanford students should recog
nize this fact and not simply excuse all anti-
Israel attitudes as legitimate when many
are based on bigotry.

Advertisement signers should 'support
the many Israeli peace advocates'
It's too bad that the Stanford Israel Al
liance's advertisement in The Daily (Feb.
18), which supported Israel's light to exist
within safe and secure borders, didn't also
support a similar right for Palestinians. I
wonder how many of those who signed the
advertisement are aware that three million
Palestinians are currently confined behind
checkpoints and roadblocks, unable to
travel between villages, or go to work or to
school, or tend their crops, or in many
cases even get to a hospital. How many of
the signers know that the Israeli army has
destroyed whole sections of Hebron,
Nablus, Jenin, and other cities, or that
thousands of Palestinians have been kept
under curfew for months on end without
adequate food or water?
The signers of the advertisement are
right to condemn Palestinian terrorism,
but I wonder if they know that Israel rou
tinely uses U.S.-made Apache helicopter
gunships to bombard crowded civilian
neighborhoods. On Tuesday, the day the
advertisement appeared in The Daily, fire
from Israeli tanks and helicopters killed 11
people in Gaza City. Israeli troops recent
ly fired flechette tanks shells, which ex
plode into thousands of razor-sharp steel

darts, into a soccer field where children
were playing. In January alone, 72 Pales
tinians were killed by Israeli gunfire, most
of them unarmed civilians and 24 of them
children. In the past two years the dead
have included United Nations relief work
ers, doctors, ambulance drivers, teachers,
the young and the old.
If the signers of the advertisement truly
want Israel to survive as a secure democra
cy, they should support the many Israeli
peace advocates who work together with
Palestinians to replant olive trees and re
build homes that have been demolished.
The Israelis who work for peace want a se
cure Israel for their children as much as
any of those who signed the advertisement.
That is why they call on their government
to stop trying to rule by force over another
people and end the occupation.

' Advising is a two-way street 7
The challenges cited in the editorial
"Helpful advice" (Feb. 18) are shared by
the advising community and the sugges
tions made are worthy of exploration. We
in the Undergraduate Advising Center
applaud The Daily's acknowledgement of

the importance of fostering successful ad
visor-advisee relationships and the key
role that these can play in helping to accli
mate freshmen to their new academic mi
lieu.
Through the training and support pro
vided to academic advisors, the UAC both
promotes and enables student connec
tions to the multitude of educational op
portunities at Stanford. Most of our volun
teer academic advisors are dedicated to
making every attempt to ensure the aca
demic success of their advisees. Of course,
no one advisor — whether faculty, staff, or
peer — can know everything about the
myriad of options of courses, majors and
research interests. That is why we assem
ble a team of advisors and peer advisors
for each freshman cohort and supplement
it with professional advisors in the UAC
and an extensive array of expanded advis
ing programs.
While it is a primary obligation of advi
sors to assist their advisees in linking to,
and taking advantage of, campus re
sources, there is a concomitant obligation
of students to seek out and cultivate con
tacts with their advisors and to follow
through on recommendations provided
by advisors. Advising is a two-way inter
change. Advisors and advisees are encour
aged to clarify mutual expectations early
on in the advising relationship.
The UAC, through both its profession
al advising staff and its network of volun
teer academic advisors and peer advisors
and mentors, provides a wide assortment
of programs, workshops and events —
most taking place in the dorm — that go
far beyond the perfunctory once-a-quar
ter meal that the editorial cites.
While we are proud of our current ef
forts and recent accomplishments, the
UAC, and the University at large, is con
stantly seeking to advance the advising sys
tem by implementing innovations gener
ated by faculty, staff, and — most impor
tantly— students. We continually assess
our programs and services and have just
completed our annual survey of freshmen.
Assessment results have been increasingly
positive in recent years, not only for the
programming we provide, but for the one
to-one experiences that most freshmen
have with their advisors and peer advisors.
On the specific issue highlighted in your
editorial, over 75 percent of the survey re
spondents from the class of 2006 ex
pressed satisfaction with their advisors' as
sistance in referring them to helpful Uni
versity resources and promoting contact
with faculty outside of class.
Interested students are welcome at any
time to meet with UAC staff to discuss con
cerns or offer suggestions for improve
ment or email us your thoughts at under
grad-advising@stanford.

Driving less can reduce U.S.
oil dependence
Those involved in the growing cam
paign against sport-utility vehicles — as
evidenced by the advertisements linking
SUVs to terrorism and war and Friday's
"SUV SOS" march by Stanford students to
a I lummer dealership in Burlingame —
should be mindful to critically examine
the connections between general vehicle
use and oil demand, as well as bolstering
anti-SUV arguments with a consideration
of alternatives.
Indeed, the use of SUVs in places that
don't require them troubles me. The con
sequences include the endangerment of
other drivers and the increased use of oil.
/Mas, though, SUVs represent only the
most extreme manifestation of a culture
that engenders the overuse of any type of
vehicle. Well before the advent of SUVs,
the United States' reliance on automobiles
fostered an obsession with Middle Eastern

oil. the OPEC crises of the 1970s testify to
this. To say that SUVs are a cause for war
in Iraq, as many have hinted, is thus diffi
cult to substantiate. Rather, the American
car culture and attendant oil dependence
offer a possible explanation fora U.S. rush
into war — but this would likely be the
case even without SUVs on the road.
We must recognize that reality as we
rally to lessen our oil dependence. The
struggle should include visible denuncia
tions of SUVs when they are unnecessary,
as Friday's protest accomplished. But let
us not overlook, for example, the promo
tion of hybrid cars and fuel cell technology.
The most difficult struggle may take place
at the foundation of our car culture, and it
could require a shift in values. Little no
ticed, but of dire importance, are the per
sonal and municipal ways of weaning our
selves off unnecessary use of any type of
automobile. Individually, we can choose to
carpool, walk and take public transit. On a
municipal level, we can promote carshare
programs, traffic-calming measures and
urban planning that places residences
near workplaces and commercial areas.
The infrastructure and tendencies of
our nation make this a tough road to hoe,
but it may well contain an important key to
a U.S. free from oil dependence. Until the
day when we all drive hybrid and fuel cell
automobiles, simply driving less is perhaps
our best hope.

United States needs to secure
national security worldwide
Global dominance is a perilous state. At
the same time that the American economy
buttresses global economic production,
growth, and, therewith, global well being
and the envisagement of a better tomor
row, the crosshairs lower. National securi
ty issues extend further beyond this na
tion's border than any other — the extent
of reach compelled by I he needs of this
country and, more cynically, governmen
tal objectives, but no less motivated by the
needs of our friends.
America is perceived hypocritically for
its absent actions, not in relation to their di
rect contradiction of public values, but
rather in relation to their capacity to un
dertake profound acts. Nothing is expect
ed of, nor nothing asserted about, Russia,
Germany or France, three of Iraq's five
largest trading partners. /Ml openly c hal
lenge American foreign policy, all the
while seeking to maintain economic ad
vantages engendered by American reso
luteness.
Appeasement of those beyond civility
and integrity does not equally apportion
the risk. Continental Europe does not fear
retaliation, for these countries know re
sponse will be directed towards America or
Israel. Europeans accept their blanket se

curity so provided, but do not consider the
implications for the United States, nor the
potential catastrophic effects on global
markets and human well being, if the un
thinkable happens. Former Prime Minis
ter Neville Chamberlain sought peace in
our time, anticipating the horrors of war,
but was no less supportive of former Prime
Minister Winston Churchill when efforts
were marshaled. Peace is the dream of the
strike of midnight on New Year's Eve; his
tory suggests its inaccessibility, reason sug
gests its adverseness.
Why do I support war? Because the
cowing of morally clear democratic power
is the greatest endangerment to world se
curity. I pray force is unrequired, but re
treatment from duty ensures harsher ap
plication later.
America applies her power for two rea
sons — economic and moral.
Mistakes in application are inevitable,
but the successes in Korea (1950-1953),
the Suez Crisis (1956), Panama (1991), So
malia (1993) and, more contentiously,
Kuwait (1991) and Bosnia (1993, 1998) at
test to the benefits of the application of
American foreign power. To conclude, I
quote a speech, that is transparent in
moral clarity, that should become, un
flinchingly, the sole basis of American for
eign policy:
"Let every nation know, whether it
wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any
price, bear any burden, meet any hard
ship, support any friend, oppose any foe to
assure the survival and the success of liber
ty." (John F. Kennedy Inauguration
Speech January 20, 1961]

The Bush administration's 'criminalization
of ethnic, sexual, religious and intellectual
minorities' should be stopped
The Bush administration has not gone
far enough in confronting the imminent
threat of the North Korean crisis. It has re
cently come to light that North Korea not
only has the ability to develop real
weapons of mass destruction, but also
posses the ballistic missile capacity (the
Taepo Dong 2 missile) to deliver them
anywhere on America's West Coast.
The Bush administration should begin
a program of mass registration and
surveillance — similar to those currently
in effect for Middle-Easterners, South
Asians and immigrants from associated
countries — on individuals from affected
Asian regions of concern. This program
should include: the immediate registra
tion and/or re-registration of all immi
grants and citizens by federal agents with
the possibility of prison detention of indef
inite length; and the suspension of the civil
liberties and privacy already authorized by
the USA Patriot Act. Immigrants and de
scendants of immigrants from the follow

iiig countries should be put under scruti
ny: North Korea; South Korea (because of
the known popular sympathies for the
North Korean cause); China and Japan
(because of the large and active population
of Korean immigrants in those areas); and
other countries on the Pacific Rim.
The possible infiltration of the Asian
community by hostile elements of influ
ence is reason enough to consider the like
ly possibility that such peoples are a threat
to American national security.
In the case of people of Middle Eastern
and South Asian descent, the threat is, of
course, latent terrorist cells prepared to
carry out acts of violence against American
citizens. The threat from immigrants from
affected Asian regions of concern could be
even more significant. It is well known that
the Taepo Dong 2 missile, though it has the
range to reach California, has not been test
ed. Therefore its long-range guidance ca
pabilities are unrefined. With the addition
of mobile homing beacons worn by infiltra
tors from the areas of concern, accuracy
can be greatly enhanced. Thus, the de
struction of major cities on the West Coast
is a real possibility. In addition, we cannot
rule out violent acts of aggression against
American interests on domestic soil.
It is therefore evident that citizens and
immigrants from the affected Asian re
gions pose an immediate threat to Ameri
can national security. The American gov
ernment should begin the implementa
tion of the programs outlined here and
other tactics so abominable and secretive
that they have not been described or
shown in this letter.
This "absurdist" letter now seems plau
sible to be the voice of the Bush adminis
tration, given both its recent actions and
comments made by Homeland Security
Subcommittee Chair and Representative
from North Carolina, Howard Coble, who
supported the internment of Japanese
during World War 11. But this letter is writ
ten not simply to the Asian community on
campus, who might find in it real reason to
be concerned. It is written to anyone who
may not have been able to understand the
nature of the shocking, criminal and hys
terical acts the American government has
perpetrated on the Middle Eastern and
South Asian populations of this country.
If you found, while reading this letter,
the sinking feeling of disgust or revulsion
and recognize in it what has already taken
place, ask yourself how it is possible to mo
bilize this political intuition to undertake
acts of resistance against what is currently
being done. This letter is a call for solidar
ity amongst everyone who sees no end to
the criminalization of ethnic, sexual, reli
gious and intellectual minorities that the
Bush administration has been advocating.
When we lift our heads to hear the call for
sanity, we will recognize that we are consti
tutive of a powerful majority.
