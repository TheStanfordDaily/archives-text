# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Bush's 'x' war needs a better explanation 
### ALADDIN NASSAR GUEST COLUMNIST 
Governments love to declare war on
just about anything — be it communism,
drugs, poverty, or terrorism — it doesn't
really matter as long as we are in a"state of
war." You can call them the "x-wars,"
where "x" is the "enemy du jour" — the
government's prime choice of today's
focus. How else do you get to run over civil
liberties, distract the masses from real is
sues and push people around like sheep?
Democracies are very difficult to manage
under public scrutiny, so the public's eyes
must be directed to look elsewhere.
Under t he pretext of war and national
security, anything goes to protect the
greatest democracy on earth. And in safe
guarding America the government's way,
we lose the very essence of what America
is all about, inching closer and closer to a
dictatorship in disguise. The irony is how
easily we let that happen in exchange for
a delusional security the government can
never provide, but can only undermine.
And once people are willing to trade
some of their freedoms in exchange for
security, they automatically enslave
themselves to the power hungry.
Benjamin Franklin summed it up so
eloquently by saying: "Those who are
ready to sacrifice freedom for security,
will ultimately lose both." The founding
fathers knew from their experience in
Europe how governments abuse power.
The people's right to bear arms and form
militias is testimony to the intent to curb
that abuse. Dare anyone form a militia
nowadays under the national security's
guillotine ? I rest my case.
To create the popular "demand" for
the government's mandate on people,
people are led to believe they are in con
stant danger. And if they forget, the gov
ernment changes the color-coded terror

alerts from one obscure color to another,
not that anyone would know what to do
with a color like "orange," and here goes
$38 billion down the drain — yet another
government bureaucracy called the
Homeland Security.
Ideally it is best to drag the "x-wars" to
the second term elections. George W.
Bush learned from Daddy a hard lesson
— a war ended one year before the elec
tions might allow people to remember the
economy's batl news. We went from a bud
get surplus of $236 billion in the year
2000, to more than $300 billion in deficit
this year and counting, so America will
have to go to war until 2004, November
2004 to be specific.
And even if Bush loses the second term
elections in 2004, why can't he retire super
rich at the expense of the U.S. economy?
Ken Lay, Enron's former CEO and Bush's
buddy, cashed out before Enron's col
lapse, so why can't Bush? With oil prices at
record highs due to the Venezuelan
strikes, and the impending war on Iraq
that can only increase the oil prices, the
Bush family is set for life. Of course, dur
ing the "war on terrorism" and in the in
terest of "national security," no one dares
to question this blatant conflict of interest.
And with the defense and oil industries
lobbying for war to replenish the weapons
inventory and make even more money,
there is too much money at stake to let
anyone expose the grand scheme. Least of
all the mass media rolling over like "Tick
le Me Elmo" unwilling to risk its cozy rela
tionship with the government, in ex
change for the government's turning its
"blind eye" to the media's mega mergers
and the privilege to fly on Air Force One
— the public may never get exposed to the
motivations behind those "x-wars" — a
vivid example of how "ignorance is bliss."
On the foreign policy front, it is inter
esting how we have become what America

lbught against in its Revolutionary War
from the British. One would think the
country that fought colonialism will never
succumb to becoming a colonial power,
but that is where we are heading. As an
Egyptian American who has traveled
throughout much of the world with a keen
interest in world history and social behav
ior, I find it very interesting how the "Ma
trix" exists in every society, shaping how
people think and the kind of questions
they can ask. It is extremely difficult to see
the "Matrix" from within and it becomes
clear only when you step out of it.
The main difference I noticed between
Americans and the rest of the world, is how
we delude ourselves into thinking there is
no "Matrix" in America — that only hap
pens to third world countries. So, let me
ask some unpopular questions about the
U.S. "Matrix" and you be the judge:
1. Wasn't it the U.S. government that
armed Saddam Hussein with the most so
phisticated chemical and biological
weapons that we want to rid him of today?
Wasn't it the very same Donald Rumsfeld,
Reagan's special convoy to Iraq in 1983,
who facilitated these deals? Wasn't it
America that provided Saddam with finest
grade of anthrax that only the U.S. and the
former Soviet Union could manufacture
at that time? | Refer to the Washington
Post's Issue of Dec. 29, 2002, "U.S. Had
Key Role in Iraq Buildup".]
2. Where was the U.S. in 1987, when
Saddam used chemical weapons on the
Kurds in Halabjah? Isn't it a bit too late to
come 16 years later and say "We feel for
you, and we came to liberate you"? Could
that have any thing to do with the U.S.
strangling Europe's, Japan's and China's
oil supplies? As Noam Chomsky states in
his book: "Rogue States — the Rule of
Force in World Affairs," the United States
government wants to replace a disobedi
ent dictator with an obedient one as it did

in many other countries.
3. Is it really true that terrorists are
against American democracy and freedom
as Bush claims? If that was true, how come
many European countries like Norway,
Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Bel
gium, with no less democracies and free
doms, are never targets of terrorism? Does
America really want democracy and free
dom for the third world?
Did you know the U.S. overthrew gov
ernments for some banana plantations in
Central America? Or that the United
States lost to Nicaragua at the World
Court for illegally mining its harbors with
explosives in 1984? It is about time Amer
icans took a very close look at the U.S. for
eign policy, its negative effects on the
world and how it ultimately undermines
American security.
4. The U.S. government wants us to be
lieve that the war on Iraq, or for that mat
ter, America's military spending and for
eign policy since WWII, is to protect
America's freedom, jobs and the economy.
Do they really? Are Americans much bet
ter off than the Swiss who have virtually no
military spending? Does war really save
American jobs? Do you know how many
jobs America lost to its competitors abroad
this past year alone? [Check out the Busi
ness Week issue of Feb. 3, 2003, "Global
ization Goes White Collar — Is Your Job
Next?"]
5. So, how do governments make use of
wars? Wars give a macho "kick-butt"
image to a questionable president that half
the country thought was a clown. Wars
help distract the masses from sex (Clinton)
and political (Nixon) scandals. Wars help
people lose focus of real issues. A case in
point is how easily most Americans have
forgotten two of the worst financial disas
ters in U.S. corporate history: Enron and
Worldcom. We lost a big part of a trillion
dollars in assets between Enron, World

com and the increased budget deficit in
the last two years, and we already forgot
about it. Works like a charm !
6. Bush says North Korea and Iraq are
quite different cases, but did you ever ask
why? Did you know that Daddy represent
ed the Carlyle Group's, the Defense Con
glomerate's entrance into the South Kore
an market, paving Carlyle's way for buy
outs of Korea's KorAm Bank and Mer
cury, a telecommunications equipment
company, with big commissions at stake?
For the big business deal to be successful,
stability between North and South Korea
is crucial and hence the marked difference
between North Korea and Iraq.
Not to mention that North Korea does
not sit on the third-largest oil reserve in
the world. [Refer to the Red Herring's Ar
ticle of the Dec. 2001 issue, "Carlyle's Way.
Making a Mint Inside the Iron Triangle of
Defense, Government, and Industry," at
http://www.redherring.com/mag/issueloB
/947.htm1. Read in that article the Carlyle
Group's interesting relationship with the
Bin Laden family and Bush Sr.'s associa
tion with Carlyle. The Red Herring says:
"Or consider that U.S. president George
W. Bush is in a position to make budgetary
decisions that could pad his father's bank
account."]
Is there any hopfc the masses will awak
en from their deep sleep and put a stop to
greedy war lords, not much different from
their Afghani counterparts, looking only
after their own interests, before we snow
ball the world into Armageddon? History
insists on repeating itself, so 1 guess we will
have to learn the hard way that: what goes
around, comes around.
