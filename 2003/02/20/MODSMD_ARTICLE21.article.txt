## The 						voice of Sunken Diamond Calling the strikes 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball media guide
will tell you that there are just four se
niors on this year's team. One glance
into the press box on a game day at
Sunken Diamond will show you a fifth
— and he's even enjoyed more play
ing time than the other four during
his career.
Senior Chad Goldberg, a fourth
year broadcaster for KZSU Radio on
campus, has been a fixture on the air
as the voice of the Cardinal since his
freshman year at Stanford. Now he
ranks as one of the most recognizable
faces at Sunken Diamond after elevat
ing the levels of professionalism and
quality of KZSU's sports coverage
during his undergraduate career.
"The radio broadcasts are a critical
part of our program because we have
so many fans that can't come to the
games," said coach Mark Marquess.
"Stanford baseball fans really appreci
ate the great job that Chad does, and I
think he's been a great asset to our
program."
Long gone are the early days when
his first attempt at a home run catch
phrase, "the sweet sound of alu
minum," made Goldberg a freshman
celebrity in the corridors of Branner
Hall. He has made tremendous
strides throughout his tenure at the
mic and now consistently turns out
professional-grade broadcasts over
the air and on the Internet for the
roughly 90 percent of Cardinal base
ball games that he covers.
"I first thought that having a home
run call was critical," Goldberg said.
"But I realized that in the end it wasn't
very necessary. I think 'the sweet
sound of aluminum' may be a little
passe at this point."
Goldberg may have tried to make
his mark early with a catch phrase, but
over time he began to understand that
the broadcasting idols of his youth —
John Gordon, Al Michaels and Mike
Patrick — did not rely on gimmicks
but on hard work, attention to detail
and consistent improvement.
Becoming part of that elite group
of sports broadcasters was not on
Goldberg's mind when he attended a
KZSU meeting in the fall of 1999. He
said he only wanted to give himself a
chance to get on the air and possibly
position himself fora spot on the base

ball broadcasting team in future years.
But when one of the students slated
to cover baseball that season for KZSU
decided to stop out of school, the
sports managers at the station chose
Goldberg to be the regular color com
mentator for the Cardinal. He earned
the spot with his solid performances
on KZSU's weekly Sports Zoo, and in
February of2ooo he made the first ap
pearance in what has become a fine
collegiate radio career.
"I think he's really grown as an an
nouncer, and I've gotten a lot of com
pliments about the job he does," Mar
quess said.
Compliments were certainly not
flying Goldberg's way after his March
2, 2000 broadcast at Sunken Dia
mond. In the fifth inning, a bunt
fouled off Cardinal senior Andy
Topham's bat and came lofting to
wards Goldberg in the press box.
What Stanford player Brian Hall
dubbed "the most catchable pop-up
ever" was too much for the former
Minnesota high school shortstop to
handle, and the ball bounced off his
hands and onto the concrete walkway
in front of the press box.
"It was probably one of the five
most embarrassing moments of my ca
reer," Goldberg said. "I just wish that
after all these years, the media would
just let it go."
Fortunately for Cardinal fans and
for Goldberg, the highlights of his
broadcasts have far outweighed the
low points. Though Marquess speaks
to Goldberg before each Stanford
baseball broadcast for the coach's
show, the coach himself has heard the
senior live on the air just once in Gold
berg's four-year career at KZSU.
Almost three months after the foul
ball gaffe in a regional postseason
game against Alabama, umpires eject
ed Marquess for arguing after a bases
loaded walk in the sixth inning cut the
Stanford lead to 3-2. One pitch later,
the veteran coach had to listen to
Goldberg deliver the action — a grand
slam that put the Crimson Tide
ahead, 6-3.
"It's a lot more nervous listening on
the radio than being there," Marquess
said. "But he paints a real good pic
ture of what's going on in the game. I
was trying to peak out of my blinds to
see it, but I couldn't. But I could hear
him."
The Cardinal stormed back to win

that game, 8-6, with a five-run ninth
inning that Goldberg called "one of
the greatest moments I've witnessed
at Sunken Diamond."
That's not to say he wasn't in the
hot seat. "While I was on the air, some
body passed me a note in the press box
after the ejection that said, 'Nine
(Marquess) is listening.'
That definitely made me nervous,
but I'm happy that in the end Coach
Marquess got to hear me call the
comeback rather than suffer through
a playoff loss."
While the public policy major will
be graduating after winter quarter,
he'll remain as Stanford's lead baseball
voice for the remainder of the 2003
season. The veteran of three College
World Series attended a three-day

minor league baseball conference in
December, scouring the leagues for
broadcasting openings for this sum
mer.
Goldberg is still unsure of his sum
mer plans with several opportunities
still floating around, but he says he
hopes to become part of the broad
casting business by 2004 at the latest.
Whether fans someday hear him
calling World Series games for the
Minnesota Twins or his broadcasting
days come to a close this June, Gold
berg's mark on Stanford baseball will
be indelibly stamped on all who lis
tened to his calls — and even those
that didn't.
Said Marquess: "He's definitely
been a big part of Stanford baseball,
and he's going to be missed."

ate the great job that Chad does, and I
think he's been a great asset to our
program."
Long gone are the early days when
his first attempt at a home run catch
phrase, "the sweet sound of alu
minum," made Goldberg a freshman
celebrity in the corridors of Branner
Hall. He has made tremendous
strides throughout his tenure at the
mic and now consistently turns out
professional-grade broadcasts over
the air and on the Internet for the
roughly 90 percent of Cardinal base
ball games that he covers.
"I first thought that having a home
run call was critical," Goldberg said.
"But I realized that in the end it wasn't
very necessary. I think 'the sweet
sound of aluminum' may be a little
passe at this point."
Goldberg may have tried to make
his mark early with a catch phrase, but
over time he began to understand that
the broadcasting idols of his youth —
John Gordon, Al Michaels and Mike
Patrick — did not rely on gimmicks
but on hard work, attention to detail
and consistent improvement.
Becoming part of that elite group
of sports broadcasters was not on
Goldberg's mind when he attended a
KZSU meeting in the fall of 1999. He
said he only wanted to give himself a
chance to get on the air and possibly
position himself fora spot on the base

ball broadcasting team in future years.
But when one of the students slated
to cover baseball that season for KZSU
decided to stop out of school, the
sports managers at the station chose
Goldberg to be the regular color com
mentator for the Cardinal. He earned
the spot with his solid performances
on KZSU's weekly Sports Zoo, and in
February of2ooo he made the first ap
pearance in what has become a fine
collegiate radio career.
"I think he's really grown as an an
nouncer, and I've gotten a lot of com
pliments about the job he does," Mar
quess said.
Compliments were certainly not
flying Goldberg's way after his March
2, 2000 broadcast at Sunken Dia
mond. In the fifth inning, a bunt
fouled off Cardinal senior Andy
Topham's bat and came lofting to
wards Goldberg in the press box.
What Stanford player Brian Hall
dubbed "the most catchable pop-up
ever" was too much for the former
Minnesota high school shortstop to
handle, and the ball bounced off his
hands and onto the concrete walkway
in front of the press box.
"It was probably one of the five
most embarrassing moments of my ca
reer," Goldberg said. "I just wish that
after all these years, the media would
just let it go."
Fortunately for Cardinal fans and
for Goldberg, the highlights of his
broadcasts have far outweighed the
low points. Though Marquess speaks
to Goldberg before each Stanford
baseball broadcast for the coach's
show, the coach himself has heard the
senior live on the air just once in Gold
berg's four-year career at KZSU.
Almost three months after the foul
ball gaffe in a regional postseason
game against Alabama, umpires eject
ed Marquess for arguing after a bases
loaded walk in the sixth inning cut the
Stanford lead to 3-2. One pitch later,
the veteran coach had to listen to
Goldberg deliver the action — a grand
slam that put the Crimson Tide
ahead, 6-3.
"It's a lot more nervous listening on
the radio than being there," Marquess
said. "But he paints a real good pic
ture of what's going on in the game. I
was trying to peak out of my blinds to
see it, but I couldn't. But I could hear
him."
The Cardinal stormed back to win

that game, 8-6, with a five-run ninth
inning that Goldberg called "one of
the greatest moments I've witnessed
at Sunken Diamond."
That's not to say he wasn't in the
hot seat. "While I was on the air, some
body passed me a note in the press box
after the ejection that said, 'Nine
(Marquess) is listening.'
That definitely made me nervous,
but I'm happy that in the end Coach
Marquess got to hear me call the
comeback rather than suffer through
a playoff loss."
While the public policy major will
be graduating after winter quarter,
he'll remain as Stanford's lead baseball
voice for the remainder of the 2003
season. The veteran of three College
World Series attended a three-day

minor league baseball conference in
December, scouring the leagues for
broadcasting openings for this sum
mer.
Goldberg is still unsure of his sum
mer plans with several opportunities
still floating around, but he says he
hopes to become part of the broad
casting business by 2004 at the latest.
Whether fans someday hear him
calling World Series games for the
Minnesota Twins or his broadcasting
days come to a close this June, Gold
berg's mark on Stanford baseball will
be indelibly stamped on all who lis
tened to his calls — and even those
that didn't.
Said Marquess: "He's definitely
been a big part of Stanford baseball,
and he's going to be missed."

Senior Chad Goldberg has become a familiar voice to Cardinal baseball fans. He
hopes to enter into the field of professional broadcasting at the conclusion of this
year's season.
The Stanford baseball media guide
will tell you that there are just four se
niors on this year's team. One glance
into the press box on a game day at
Sunken Diamond will show you a fifth
— and he's even enjoyed more play
ing time than the other four during
his career.
Senior Chad Goldberg, a fourth
year broadcaster for KZSU Radio on
campus, has been a fixture on the air
as the voice of the Cardinal since his
freshman year at Stanford. Now he
ranks as one of the most recognizable
faces at Sunken Diamond after elevat
ing the levels of professionalism and
quality of KZSU's sports coverage
during his undergraduate career.
"The radio broadcasts are a critical
part of our program because we have
so many fans that can't come to the
games," said coach Mark Marquess.
"Stanford baseball fans really appreci
ate the great job that Chad does, and I
think he's been a great asset to our
program."
