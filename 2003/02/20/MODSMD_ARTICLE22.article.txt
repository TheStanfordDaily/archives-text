# Liu plays major role

### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Playing the No. 1 singles position
for the No. 5 tennis team in the na
tion would be somewhat fazing to
most freshmen. But, after consider
ing Amber Liu's past accomplish
ments, it is obvious why she has rev
eled in this opportunity.

Women's Tennis
vs. Rice, today, 1:30 p.m.

Although she battled injuries
early in the year, Liu fought to a 7-3
singles record in tough singles tour
naments. Perhaps she contributed
the most at the ITA All-American
Championships in October, during
which she finished with a 5-1 record
while advancing to a competitive
main draw.
"The individual tournaments
during the fall gave me a chance to
see how I compared to the top colle
giate players out there," Liu said.
"Some of the tournaments were a
little tough because I was out with a
hamstring injury for part of the fall,
so I couldn't practice much before
some of the tournaments. I am still
happy to have had some strong per
formances, though."
Playing against the very best
players on the best teams in the na
tion provides Liu with the opportu
nity for constant improvement, but
also means that she cannot take any
opponent lightly and must perform
at her highest level in every match.
"It is very tough to play No. 1 —
every match you have to be mental
ly focused and ready to play," Liu
said. "The No. 1 s at every school are
tough players, so you have to be

ready to get out there and fight."
Liu has not only excelled in sin
gles, however, as her play in doubles
has steadily improved since Septem
ber. Liu and fellow freshman Alice
Barnes have provided the Cardinal
with a solid No. 2 doubles squad,
posting a 3-1 record in the presea
son despite the little time the fresh
men had to adjust to each other's
style of play.
"I really enjoy playing with Alice,
since she is one of my better friends
on the team," Liu said. "It was a lit
tle tough at first playing together
since it's our first time being part
ners, but we are improving with
each match and I think we will be a
strong team by end of the season."
Liu's credentials in her career
prior to joining the Cardinal squad
are quite impressive. She won the
USTA Girls' 18 Super National
Hard Court Championships, the
top 18-and-under tournament in
the country, in 2001. A result of this
victory was an automatic birth in the
2001 U.S. Open. She was defeated
in the first round by Eleni Daniili
dou, 6-3,6-3, but earned a great ex
perience in the process.
"The more big matches and
tournaments you play, the better
you get," Stanford coach Lele
Forood said. "You have a little more
presence in the big matches when
you're used to playing in things like
Grand Slam tournaments, so I think
it will help her a lot."
Due to her accomplishments
away from the Farm, she was
ranked No. 1 in 18-and-under sin
gles in the 2002 USTA Junior Final
Ranking and is currently ranked
No. 390 in the world at age 18.
After amassing a full repertoire

of accomplishments as a junior, Liu
picked Stanford fora variety of rea
sons.
"I chose to come to Stanford be
cause I think it's a very well-round
ed school — Stanford allows its stu
dents to excel both academically
and athletically," Liu said. "The
strong academic standing of the
school in addition to its top tennis

program was definitely a large fac
tor in my decision."
Forood added, "She was the na
tional champion two summers ago,
so obviously she was a great find and
a great match, especially for Stan
ford; she had the option to come last
year but she decided to come this
year instead and is a huge addition
to our program."
