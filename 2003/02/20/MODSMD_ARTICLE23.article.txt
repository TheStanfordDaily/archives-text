# Muddled views of fan support

/ / -w- Tp"eah baby! He's a prime time player, a
\ / diaper dandy, a super scintillating
sensation baby!" You may think this
.JL is Dick Vitale talking about J.J. Red
dick, Matt Grunfeld, or even Carmelo Anthony. You
might think he's even talking about Le√üron. But
you would be wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong.
This is, verbatim, what Dick Vitale said about me
last Saturday night, going into the biggest contest of
my Stanford career.
Or it's what he would have said, had he been at
Kappa Sigma's mudwrestling party. There I was, in
all my earthly splendor, decked out to the gills in my

"Bailers" mudwrestling getup. I was
lookin' like a bailer, what with my
Air Force Ones, a Casey "Stanford
Basketball Jesus" Jacobsen jersey
and a white Nike headband.
Someone get me a scholarship.
So there I was, ready to enter the
pit after the "Gladiators" exited.
The four of us bailers stood above
the mud, ready to bellyflop in, when

things started to go very wrong. The fans, obviously
excited by my extreme good looks, supreme style
and beautiful hair, grew boisterous.
So, in a page out of the Ohio State student body
playbook, a large man dressed in Stanford Football
clothing (you complete the
picture) pushed me into the pit.
However, as predicted by his terrible arm-tack
ling throughout the 2-9 season, I did not go into the
pit, but was instead shoved into my ballin' teammate,
redshirt freshman middleweight Mike Albanese.
My cheekbone met Albanese's forehead at an
angle and velocity so severe that I was immediately
placed on the Injured Reserve, and was forced to sit
out the remainder of the match.
It was my moment to take part in the glory, the
splendor, the excitement of a collegiate athletic
event, all to be ruined by a wacky fan rushing the
field and ruining what should have been my proud
est moment.
Needless to say, this brought about a catharsis
within me.
I have always been the bandwagon leader for
those that encouraged fans to rush the field after an
important win. I've rushed the field before: the past
two years as the men's soccer team made it to the
elite eight, when Stanford basketball beat Xavier this
year, and when Cal football beat Washington a few
years back (youthful indiscretion, I'm sorry to say).
I've been on a team that has gotten rushed a few
times as well: when my high school soccer team won
state section, when we beat our rivals for the first
time in 16 years, and when I made the game winning
touchdown catch in the state finals, only to get
crushed in the endzone and blow out both my knees,
eliminating any prospects of an NFL career.
OK, so I've never played padded football in my

life, but that's not the point. The
point is, every time I have rushed
the field, or been rushed as a
player, it has been an exhilarating
experience. The players live for
the fans, the fans live lor the play
ers, and the symbiotic relation
ship doesn't get any sweeter than
when the fans and players can
show their mutual appreciation
for one another after an exhilarat
ing, emotionally draining and
memorable performance.
But "no no no" says the admin
istration (whom 1 shall refer to as
"The Man" for the rest of the col
umn). The Man says, "No, John
and Jane Q. Student, you are not
allowed to appreciate the players,
go sit in your seat. But be sure to
donate to Stanford Athletics!"
First he doesn't allow club

teams in varsity sports, then he
shuts down IM basketball on Pres
ident's Day, and now he, and
other administrations across the
country won't let students rush
the field.
I understand his argument:
people can get hurt. In the con
fusion, mass hysteria and alco
holic intake inherent in college
crowds, someone is liable to get
hurt and the university is liable
in a lawsuit.
But to that I say, just look at
the fans that watch Stanford ath
letics and rush the court: the
"Behind the net club"in soccer
and the "6th Man Club"for bas
ketball are by and large Stanford
students.
We were accepted by the insti
tution to provide a diverse com
munity of smart, quirky and
benevolent people. If a university
cannot provide a forum fora stu
dent body to congratulate and
celebrate each other's achieve

merits, it has far bigger problems
than potential lawsuits.
So there I was, muddy, throb
bing and angry, pissed that the
fans had rushed the field and
shown improper class. But you
know, maybe mudwrestling isn't
exactly an athletic event, and
maybe due to the debauchery on
the court, it was foreseeable that
there would be audience partici
pation. A big mudpit isn't exactly
a proper forum for fan-athlete in
teraction anyway.
But overall, I'll chalk it up to
the fact that the Stanford football
player behaved poorly because he
probably has never enjoyed the
feeling of fans rushing the field. A
2-9 season and a 10-foot fence
around the field doesn't exactly
afford a lot of fan support.
