# Tennis to compete in Lexington tourney

### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Blue grass, Colonel Sanders,
thoroughbred racing and Daniel
Boone. It's the middle of February
and that can mean only one thing
for the No. 7 Stanford men's tennis
team (4-1) â€” a trip to Kentucky to
take part in the National Men's
Team Indoor Championships.
The prestigious 16-team event,
which runs today through Sunday,
is the only national team tourna
ment until the NCAA champi
onships in May. The Indoors will
give the Cardinal a chance to prove
itself a contender for NCAAs.
"I'm really excited about going
to this tournament," head coach
Dick Gould said. "We can play with
anybody, but it's time to stop think
ing about it and to go out and prove
it."
"I'm looking forward to it," se
nior Ail-American Scott Lipsky said.
"I honestly think we're playing real
ly well as a team right now, so this is
a good time for us to go see how we
stack up against the top teams in the
country."
If history is any indicator, the
Cardinal has a good chance of
bringing home the trophy on Sun
day. Since the event was inaugurat
ed in 1973, Stanford has won 12
times, including a victory last year.
Stanford and UCLA are the only
schools to win the tournament since
1990.
Why has the Cardinal been so
successful at the Indoors in years
past?

"Dick and I preach an attacking,
serve-and-volley style of play, which
is better suited to faster indoor
courts," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "During fall quar
ter, we make sure every one of our
players works on serve-and-volley
ing so that they'll feel comfortable
doing it in a match."
While Gould agrees that the Car
dinal's style is more conducive to
faster-paced courts, he believes this
advantage is tempered by the
weather factor.
"A lot of the other non-California
teams have played all of their
matches indoors so far, so that puts
us at a litde bit of a disadvantage,"
Gould said.
The only thing for sure is that if
the Cardinal is to defend its title, it
will have to fight through an ex
tremely difficult draw. In the first
round, Stanford takes on the No. 11
Kentucky (5-2) Wildcats.
"We've lost to Kentucky in this
tournament probably more than to
any other team," Gould said. "They
come out hard and strong with all
their fans there. It's certainly not a
gimme match."
Kentucky demonstrated to the
Cardinal what a tough opponent it
will be when it narrowly lost to No.
1 UCLA, 4-3, on Tuesday.
In addition, today's match will
give senior Ail-American Ryan Hav
iland the chance to avenge his 6-4,
5-7,6-1 semifinal loss to Kentucky's
Jesse Witten in last year's NCAA sin
gles championships.
