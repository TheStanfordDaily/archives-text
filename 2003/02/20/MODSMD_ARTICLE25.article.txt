# Track and Field heads to Idaho
## Cardinal will look to ride the strength of sprinters to victory 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
This weekend will be the first
true test for the young, talented
and hungry Stanford track and
field program. So far this season,
the squad has not entered a
scored meet that crowns a team
champion. That will change as
both the men's and women's
teams are vying for titles at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championships on Friday
and Saturday.
Coming into the meet as the
top-ranked team in the MPSF, the
No. 6 men's team is riding its vic
tory in the outdoor Pacific-10
Championships last spring. Re
turning most of the competitors

from that team and bringing in a
stellar recruiting class, the men's
squad is looking to win its first
MPSF title since 2000.
The No. 7 women's squad faces
stiff competition in the MPSF â€”
mainly from No. 6 UCLA, No. 16
Oregon and defending champion
No. 18 Arizona. With the stellar
sprint squad that has been assem
bled on the Farm to complement
the strong distance and field pro
grams, however, the women are
in great shape to steal the title.
"With our depth through all
events, there's no way we couldn't
be one of the teams in the title
chase," said junior Lindsey John
son, Stanford's top hurdler this
season. "The sprint squad will
definitely be a part of this. We will
be bringing in points throughout
the sprints and jumps."
Scoring for the weekend will
follow the standard procedure:
10 points for first, eight for sec
ond, six for third and then one

point less for each subsequent
place through eighth.
In the sprints, the story of the
year for both the men's and
women's squads is the recruiting
classes.
Freshmen Jakki Bailey and
Ashley Purnell have both posted
provisional qualifying times for
the NCAA Championships in the
60-meter and 200-meter dashes,
respectively. Bailey's time of 7.35
seconds in the 60 ranks her first in
the MPSF and 10th in the nation.
Purnell is also ranked first in the
MPSF with her 23.88 in the 200
and 17th in the nation.
For the men, freshman TJ
Rushing is currently ranked
eighth in the MPSF for the 60 and
sixth in the 200 with times of 6.89
and 21.83, respectively.
These talented freshmen will
be joined in the sprints by several
experienced upperclassmen.
