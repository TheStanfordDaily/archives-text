# Track and Field heads to Idaho
## Cardinal will look to ride the strength of sprinters to victory 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
This weekend will be the first
true test for the young, talented
and hungry Stanford track and
field program. So far this season,
the squad has not entered a
scored meet that crowns a team
champion. That will change as
both the men's and women's
teams are vying for titles at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championships on Friday
and Saturday.
Coming into the meet as the
top-ranked team in the MPSF, the
No. 6 men's team is riding its vic
tory in the outdoor Pacific-10
Championships last spring. Re
turning most of the competitors

from that team and bringing in a
stellar recruiting class, the men's
squad is looking to win its first
MPSF title since 2000.
The No. 7 women's squad faces
stiff competition in the MPSF â€”
mainly from No. 6 UCLA, No. 16
Oregon and defending champion
No. 18 Arizona. With the stellar
sprint squad that has been assem
bled on the Farm to complement
the strong distance and field pro
grams, however, the women are
in great shape to steal the title.
"With our depth through all
events, there's no way we couldn't
be one of the teams in the title
chase," said junior Lindsey John
son, Stanford's top hurdler this
season. "The sprint squad will
definitely be a part of this. We will
be bringing in points throughout
the sprints and jumps."
Scoring for the weekend will
follow the standard procedure:
10 points for first, eight for sec
ond, six for third and then one

point less for each subsequent
place through eighth.
In the sprints, the story of the
year for both the men's and
women's squads is the recruiting
classes.
Freshmen Jakki Bailey and
Ashley Purnell have both posted
provisional qualifying times for
the NCAA Championships in the
60-meter and 200-meter dashes,
respectively. Bailey's time of 7.35
seconds in the 60 ranks her first in
the MPSF and 10th in the nation.
Purnell is also ranked first in the
MPSF with her 23.88 in the 200
and 17th in the nation.
For the men, freshman TJ
Rushing is currently ranked
eighth in the MPSF for the 60 and
sixth in the 200 with times of 6.89
and 21.83, respectively.
These talented freshmen will
be joined in the sprints by several
experienced upperclassmen.
Johnson's 8.44 in the 60-meter
hurdles is second in the MPSF
and .01 seconds shy of the NCAA
provisional qualifying standard.
"As competitors, we're always
looking for victories and points,"

Johnson saicl. "But I'll also be
shooting for an NCAA standard
in the hurdles."
In the men's sprints, sopho
more Nick Sebes is ranked fifth in
both the 200 and 400, while ju
nior Justin Williams enters with
the fourth-fastest time in the 60
hurdles (8.03).
The Stanford squad will be led
by veterans on the jumps. Senior

Milton Little is ranked first in the
MPSF in the men's longjump with
a distance of 24 feet, 6 1/4 inches.
Senior Kim Stone leads the women
with a high jump of 5-10.5, which
ranks her 10th in the nation.
Sensational junior Jillian Ca
marena will look to defend her in
door shot put title at the MPSF
Championships. Camarena is
currently ranked eighth in the na

tion and is set to compete against
UCLA's Jessica Cosby, the de
fending outdoor national cham
pion in the event.
For the men, senior Nick Weli
hozkiy is ranked 12th in the na
tion in the weight throw with his
NCAA qualifying toss of 66-7
1/4. His throw ranks him third in
the MPSF.
The nationally recognized dis
tance squad looks to dominate all
its events. The men's squad is
ranked one through four in the
mile, 3,000 and 5,000. Junior
Steve Loughlin is expected to lead
the men's squad in the mile while
seniors Seth Hejny and Louis Lu
chini have posted the fastest times
in the 3,000 and 5,000, respec
tively.
In the 800, sophomore Evan
Fox has the second-fastest time in
the MPSF and is .19 seconds off
the NCAA provisional qualifying
standard.
The women have two of the
top four times in the 800 and four
of the top five in the mile and
3,000. Senior Lauren Fleshman,
the defending indoor NCAA
Champion in the 3,000 has the
top time in the mile and second in
the 3,000. Freshman Alicia Craig
holds the top 3,000 time. Senior
Malindi Elmore is second in the
mile and fourth in the 3,000 and
800. All three women are ranked
nationally in the mile and 3,000.
The greatest challenges to the
women's distance squad are ex
pected to be UCLA stars Alejan
dra Barrientos and defending
outdoor 1,500-meter champion
Lena Nilsson.
"I have been very pleased with
the performances of our sprint
ers, jumpers, and throwers." said
Vin Lananna, director of cross
country and track and field. "Our
distance runners are very good
on the national level, and they
should be able to score significant
points in the 800 and up.
"If we combine all event areas
it will net some good results for
the team standings for the men
and women."
