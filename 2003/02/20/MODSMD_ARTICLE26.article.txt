Arizona last Saturday.

Stanford 84, UAB 80, Arizona 62

Stanford (4-0) finished with 84
team points, topping the Blazers'
80, while Arizona finished a distant
third with 62 points.
Due to surprising pool condi
tions, the Stanford squad was forced
to quickly change its routines.
Whereas most synchro pools are
continuously deep, the UAB pool
slopes from shallow to deep, which
affected the Cardinal's original
swimming patterns.
"The meet this week was defi

nitely closer because of the unfor
tunate pool circumstances," Stan
ford synchro coach Shannon Mon
tague said. "Since we had to
change our routines at the last
minute, we did not perform as well
as we could have."
Despite the circumstances, the
pressure of competing against UAB
in their home waters did not affect
these aqua-vixens in the least.
Freshman Ashley McHugh, senior
Stephanie Joukoff, and junior Jen
nifer Kibler once again dominated
the trio competition, performing
their routine to rhythmic tribal
music. Kibler and Joukofl took first
place in the duet match, scoring an
88.3.
Stanford's duet and trio squads
kept the Wildcats off the board by
taking third place in their respective
matches.
Swimming to Spanish tunes,
McHugh also placed second in the
solo event, scoring an 88.0.

The Stanford squad took a dom
inating first place in the team event
with a score of 91.5. This impressive
mark clinched the victory for Stan
ford, its second over UAB this sea
son.
"I was really happy with the way
we adjusted to the circumstances,"
sophomore Sheila Sadovnik said.
"Although it wasn't our cleanest
win, we still performed well and de
feated two top-notch teams."
The details of synchronized
swimming do not tend to make the
spodight. The Stanford squad has a
cut-and-dry scoring system with
which it must contend. Each team is
allowed six routines total in an over
all match, and only two teams from
each school can participate in the in
dividual competitions.
Stanford has two trio squads, two
duets, one solo and one team squad.

"This coming-home meet on
