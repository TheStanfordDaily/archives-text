### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Representatives of the Stu
dents of Color Coalition gath
ered yesterday in White Plaza to
inform the community about
the results of a Tuesday meeting
with Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Gene Awakuni and Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet on the subject of
on-campus diversity.The stu
dents praised the University's
continued endorsement of affir
mative action policies but em
phasized the need for further
action to promote diversity in
students' economic background
and sexual orientation.
The students opened the

event by expressing their ap
proval of University President
John Hennessy's recent declara
tion of support for affirmative
action and the ASSU's resolu
tion to endorse Hennessy's an
nouncement.
"I think [the resolution] was a
much needed show of support
for affirmative action," said
sophomore Khalilah Karim.
"It's one thing for the faculty to
show their support and another
fora student delegation to rec
ognize that diversity doesn't just
benefit Stanford, but also soci
ety as a whole."
The discussion then turned
to the next steps that the Uni
versity should take to facilitate
other forms of diversity.
Many of the student leaders
stressed that prospective queer
students can be turned off to the
University if placed in a homo
phobic environment while visit
ing. They suggested including a

checkbox on the application
that will allow admits to request
a "queer-friendly" Room Host.
"At the end of this week, Vice
Provost Awakuni is going to let
us know if ProFros can room
with a queer-friendly RoHo,"
said senior Kuusela Hilo, a
member of SOCC.
Coalition members also en
couraged the University to work
toward a more socioeconomical
ly diverse student body.
The members suggested that
the admissions committee re
cruit Native American students
who live on reservations instead
of in the usual urban "target
areas."
There was also a concern that
low-income students are under
represented at Stanford. The
University's statistics show that
50 percent of the student body
is on financial aid, but not all of
these students necessarily come
