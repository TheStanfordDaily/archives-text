# No.9 women look to regain winning form
## 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last season, the Stanford women's
basketball team suffered two late-sea
son collapses — first to Arizona State in
the Pac-10 Tournament and then to
third-seeded Colorado in the Sweet 16.
These falters "came too late in the
season for us to learn from them," ac
cording to Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
So this time around, the headmaster
is doing all she can to avoid another
cram session.

Women's Basketball
vs. USC, tonight, 7 p.m.
vs. UCLA, Saturday, 12 p.m.

After Stanford was blown out by
Washington last week, VanDerveer
wanted to make sure her team took in
as much as possible.
"We've got to have people come out
and play with Tournament intensity,"
VanDerveer said. "When we've had
that back-against-the wall [situation],
we've played really well, but for some
reason, we've been in a little bit of a lull
lately."
For No. 9 Stanford (20-3, 12-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference), the getting-out-of
the-so-called-lull begins this weekend
with a pair of games against its neigh
bors to the south to close out the home
portion of the regular season.
The Cardinal will look for revenge
on Thursday at 7 p.m. against South
ern California (12-13, 7-7), the team
that snapped Stanford's 28-game Pac
-10 winning streak with a 75-72 victory
in Los Angeles on Jan. 26. And then in
a nationally broadcast game Saturday
at noon, Stanford will square off against
fourth-place UCLA (14-8,9-5).
Refocusing will be the key for the
Cardinal, which needs to find a way to
regroup from its worst Pac-10 loss in 12
years, 92-68, to the Huskies.
"They were on a mission," Van-
Derveer said. "But I don't see it affect
ing things in the big scheme.
" Wejust have to finish well. That can

make up for playing poorly in Wash
ington."
With a game-and-a-half lead on the
I luskies, Stanford must win three of its
last four games to clinch the Pac-10 reg
ular-season title, which amounts to
nothing more than a No. 1 seed in the
second annual Pac-10 Tournament the
second weekend of March.
But to get back on track, the Cardi
nal will have to regain the killer instinct
that seemed to be missing last week.
For the first time all season, Van-
Derveer noticed what she called a "de
featist" attitude permeating the team.
(Stanford did, however, follow up the
loss with a convincing 84-41 win over
lowly Washington State.)
Stanford has come from behind sev
eral times in the second half this year —
most notably against Arizona after trail
ing by as much as 12 —but was inexplic
ably unable to duplicate the same effort
against the Huskies.
"We just didn't have the fight and
determination we've had all year long."
VanDerveer said.
The same could describe the first
half Stanford played against the Tro
jans in late January.
USC shot a season-best 61 percent
from the field en route to a season-high
49 points and led by 14 at halftime.
Stanford then went on a 15-1 run
over the first 5:21 of the second half
and eventually tied the game at 50.
Later in the game, the Cardinal took its
only lead, 60-58, on two free-throws
from Nicole Powell with 6:12 remain
ing, but didn't make plays down the
stretch.
But Trojan junior guard Rometra
Craig, a transfer from Duke, did just
that; she scored nine of her 19 points in
the last six minutes to overshadow Pow
ell's 37 points and 15 rebounds.
"[Craig] was the one who hurt us the
most last time we played," VanDerveer
said. "She fits the USC style because
she's so aggressive and so physical on
the perimeter."
Craig will have to have a similar
game against the Cardinal this time
around since the Trojans are somewhat

short-handed.
Junior Jessica Cheeks, the steady
USC point guard, decided to sit out the
rest of the season for "personal rea
sons." And preseason All-America can
didate Aisha Hollans just returned four
days ago from an MCL injury and
played only 12 minutes in the Trojans'
loss to Arizona.
Adversity is nothing new for USC,
who opened the season 1-5 in playing
the second-toughest non-conference

schedule in the country and has faced
an uphill climb all winter long.
And although the Trojans currently
sit in fifth place in the Pac-10, their de
sire is to build on the momentum
they've been establishing—USC has
won six of its last eight conference
games — and translate that into a Pac
-10 Tournament championship.
"If we can get Hollans back at 100
