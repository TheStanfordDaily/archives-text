# Trip to L.A. not the chore of years past

How fitting a stage Los Angeles
provides for the No. 21 Cardinal
men's basketball team, which now
finds itself at the beginning of the
Pacific-10 Conference season's
end.

Men's Basketball
at USC, tonight, 7:30 p.m.
at UCLA, Saturday, 2 p.m.

The same old characters will be
present, of course, although the
storylines have been somewhat
changed.
There's Southern California
(10-11, 5-7 Pac-10) and coach
Henry Bibby playing the humbled
bully who, despite stringing to
gether three victories over Ore
gon, UCLA and UNLV, faltered
like so many others before him, in
Arizona. The Trojans finished the
rough desert trip with two 29-plus
point losses.
There's also Steve Lavin's Bru
ins starring as the conference un
derachievers who have searched
long and hard for victory this sea
son but come up empty-handed
more often than not. Light of
UCLA's (5-16,2-10 Pac-10) 1 6 loss
es this season have been by less than
five points and five of those close
calls came during Pac-10 play.
And don't forget Stanford (19-
6, 10-3 Pacific 10 Conference), as
suming the role of the perennial
underdog despite a top-25 nation
al ranking.
There are similarities between
these three teams. All are "suffer
ing" through rebuilding years, al
though Stanford has had more
success than the others.
"The teams have all lost a lot of
key players," Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery said "We lost a cou
ple to the Draft. USC and UCLA
[both] lost key players."
For example, both L A. teams,

like Stanford, have had to rely
heavily on the play of younger
players. The Trojans start four
sophomores and a junior (Desmon
Farmer) while Jason Kapono is the
only senior in the Bruins' starting
lineup, which also includes three
sophomores and a freshman.
Subsequently, what can't be ig
nored is how different a trip to Los
Angeles feels for Pac-10 teams this
time around.
This year, trips to USC and
UCLA have not been as traumatiz
ing for teams as in years past. In
Pac-10 play, USC is 3-2 at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena while UCLA
remains 0-5 at Pauley Pavilion.
A year ago, USC was bullying the
Cardinal without remorse. The
Trojans intimidated Stanford into
turnover after turnover and two de
moralizing losses â€” one at Maples
Pavilion and the other in the first
round of the Pac-10 Tournament.
This season, speculation as to
whether or not USC will even make
the NCAA Tournament exists.
"We're a very young basketball
team," Bibby said. "We are im
proving. We just haven't [been in]
the situations all year where we
could close all those games, but
that comes with maturity. For us,
to get to [the NCAA tournament] is
something in itself ."
And while last season's Bruin
team didn't represent the same
opposing threat as UCLA squads
of years past, the Bruins were, at
Ihe very least, a late-season com
petitor for the Pac-10 title. This
season, UCLA is currently in ninth
place, one game behind Washing
ton meaning that if the Pac-10
tournament were to start today,
the Bruins would not be a partici
pant.
"Well, I think, this year there's
been a multitude of factors which
have led to the type of season we're
having," Lavin laments. "One of

Junior forward Justin Davis played sparingly in the Cardinal's last contest
with Southern California as it was his first game back from a knee injury. His
impact should be much greater tonight wnen No. 21 Stanford will look for
him to dominate his post matchup with Rory O'Neill.
