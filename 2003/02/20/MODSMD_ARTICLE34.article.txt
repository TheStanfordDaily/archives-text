# Freshman duo helps fill void at guard slot
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Susan King hobbled by a broken toe, fresh
men Krista Rappahahn and Clare Bodensteiner have
suddenly become more important in coach Tara Van-
Derveer's rotation.
King is not 100 percent but will keep playing on
the foot unless the pain becomes unbearable.
"Susan is not healthy," VanDerveer said. "She
hasn't practiced all week except a little bit yesterday
on offense."
King's injury has propelled Rappahahn and Bo
densteiner to the front of the bench and into the role
of primary back-ups to guards Kelley Suminksi and
Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
Rappahahn and Bodensteiner both started out the
year auspiciously — scoring 21 and 15 points respec
tively in Stanford's first two exhibition games. Rappa
hahn showed off her shooting range by burying three
3-pointers in her first performance in front of the
Maple's crowd, while Bodensteiner fearlessly at
tacked the basket and crashed the boards.
Once the season started, however, it became clear
that VanDerveer was not comfortable giving the
freshmen meaningful minutes during close games.
After playing a combined 75 minutes in the first two
exhibition games, the two freshmen logged only 21
minutes in the first two regular-season games — both
tight wins for the Cardinal.
She never questioned their mental toughness,
though. With 43 seconds left against Kansas State,
VanDerveer choose Rappahahn to shoot free throws
for King, who was injured on the foul call. Rappa
hahn knocked down four free throws in the final
minute to seal the victory for Stanford.
"We knew [Rappahahn] was going to make them,"
VanDerveer said after the game. "We have confi
dence in her."
With All-American candidate Nicole Powell side
lined for the first nine games of the season, Van-
Derveer reluctantly contracted her rotation to six
players during close games.
"We need to make it a seven or eight-player rota
tion," she commented earlier in the season.The play
ing time of the freshmen was squeezed further upon
Powell's return. As a result, neither Rappahahn nor
Bodensteiner logged a single minute during the
team's road trip to the Oregon schools.
