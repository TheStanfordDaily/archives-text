# Freshman duo helps fill void at guard slot
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Susan King hobbled by a broken toe, fresh
men Krista Rappahahn and Clare Bodensteiner have
suddenly become more important in coach Tara Van-
Derveer's rotation.
King is not 100 percent but will keep playing on
the foot unless the pain becomes unbearable.
"Susan is not healthy," VanDerveer said. "She
hasn't practiced all week except a little bit yesterday
on offense."
King's injury has propelled Rappahahn and Bo
densteiner to the front of the bench and into the role
of primary back-ups to guards Kelley Suminksi and
Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
Rappahahn and Bodensteiner both started out the
year auspiciously — scoring 21 and 15 points respec
tively in Stanford's first two exhibition games. Rappa
hahn showed off her shooting range by burying three
3-pointers in her first performance in front of the
Maple's crowd, while Bodensteiner fearlessly at
tacked the basket and crashed the boards.
Once the season started, however, it became clear
that VanDerveer was not comfortable giving the
freshmen meaningful minutes during close games.
After playing a combined 75 minutes in the first two
exhibition games, the two freshmen logged only 21
minutes in the first two regular-season games — both
tight wins for the Cardinal.
She never questioned their mental toughness,
though. With 43 seconds left against Kansas State,
VanDerveer choose Rappahahn to shoot free throws
for King, who was injured on the foul call. Rappa
hahn knocked down four free throws in the final
minute to seal the victory for Stanford.
"We knew [Rappahahn] was going to make them,"
VanDerveer said after the game. "We have confi
dence in her."
With All-American candidate Nicole Powell side
lined for the first nine games of the season, Van-
Derveer reluctantly contracted her rotation to six
players during close games.
"We need to make it a seven or eight-player rota
tion," she commented earlier in the season.The play
ing time of the freshmen was squeezed further upon
Powell's return. As a result, neither Rappahahn nor
Bodensteiner logged a single minute during the
team's road trip to the Oregon schools.
It's hard fora player to con
tribute when not given the op
portunity to play, so for both
freshmen the relevant statistic is
minutes played. Rappahahn av
erages 3.2 points per game in
11.4 minutes of action, while Bo
densteiner averages 2.9 points in
6.9 minutes.
"It is difficult to gain momen
tum, but you just have to go out
and play the best you can because
there is nothing you can do about
it," Bodensteiner said. "It's harder
to get into the groove of the
game."
Both Rappahahn and Boden
steiner were stars in high school,
but neither is complaining about a
reduced role since joining the Car
dinal. They simply contribute as
much as possible, even if those
contributions come during prac
tice.
"Right now, I am just trying
to work hard everyday in prac
tice and help [guard Sebnem
Kimyacioglu] and Susan out
with whatever they need to
make them better prepared for
the games," Bodensteiner said.
"During the games, you have to
be ready."
"If I get in there it's great but I
want to do whatever my coaches
and teammates need," Rappa
hahn said. "You're happy to get in
there when you can."
As a point guard, the transition
has been rockier for Bodensteiner.
"Clare is playing a harder posi
tion," VanDerveer said. "Playing
point guard is like a high school
player going to quarterback in col
lege. It takes more time, but Clare
has a phenomenal attitude and
work ethic."
Bodensteiner's high intensity
level was clear from watching her

recklessly crash the boards during
the first exhibition game. This
ceaseless effort will help her over
come too many freshman mis
takes.
As an off-guard with less deci
sion-making responsibility, Rap
pahahn has fulfilled her limited
role remarkably well of late. With
King sidelined in Stanford's home
games against the Oregon schools
two weeks ago, Rappahahn
chipped in 10 points and 7 re
bounds in 22 minutes.
When Powell left the game
early in the first half with three
fouls, Rappahahn scored five
points to spark a 25-6 Stanford
run.
"That might have been the key
— being able to go to the bench
and having Krista respond that
way," VanDerveer said after the
game. "She came in and got to the
free-throw line, took the ball inside
and played well defensively."
Rappahahn was rewarded
with 16 minutes of playing time
against Oregon State the same
weekend and continued to play
solidly.
"Without Susan, a lot of people
got valuable experience," Van-
Derveer said. "Krista in particular
had a really good weekend. This
weekend was important for us."
The progress of sophomores
Azella Perryman, Kimyacioglu
and Chelsea Trotter is evidence
that both Rappahahn and Bo
densteiner will have the opportu
nity to be impact players in the
future, as each sophomore has
contributed significantly more
than she did as a freshman. Ex
perience is the difference.
"Sophomores have adapted to
the physicality and tempo of the
game," explains Bodensteiner.
"For the most part it is mental and
knowing that you have been
through a year and there is noth
ing their going to ask you to do
that vou can't do."
