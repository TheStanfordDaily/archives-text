Ebony Hoffman is the con
summate professional. She im
parts the kind of outward confi
dence that forces people to take
her seriously. She boasts an in
ternational pedigree that any
successful player would he jeal
ous of. And, most importantly,
she's lived up to the big-time
billing she confronted after en
tering college as a top-Five
prospect.
But none of the above has
translated into much success tor

her Southern California team
over the last three years.
The Trojans finished below
.500 in Hoffman's freshman year
but put together a better season
last winter-making an appear
ance in the Postseason Women's
NIT â€” and hopes were high for
an even bigger improvement
this season.

ward has seen just more of the
same.
USC, currently fifth in the
l'ac-10, seems destined for yet
