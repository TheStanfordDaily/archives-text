## Ebony hoffman 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ebony Hoffman is the con
summate professional. She im
parts the kind of outward confi
dence that forces people to take
her seriously. She boasts an in
ternational pedigree that any
successful player would he jeal
ous of. And, most importantly,
she's lived up to the big-time
billing she confronted after en
tering college as a top-Five
prospect.
But none of the above has
translated into much success tor

her Southern California team
over the last three years.
The Trojans finished below
.500 in Hoffman's freshman year
but put together a better season
last winter-making an appear
ance in the Postseason Women's
NIT — and hopes were high for
an even bigger improvement
this season.
But the 6-foot-2 junior for
ward has seen just more of the
same.

Junior Ebony Hoffman has lived up to her blue-chip recruit status, but the
Trojan women have been unable to provide her with the supporting cast
necessary to reach the NCAA Tournament.
another disappointing absence
from the NCAA Tournament, bar
ring a hot stretch by the Trojans in
the Pac-10 Women's Tournament.
That's not Hoffman's fault,
though.
Entering tonight's game, the
versatile forward sits in the confer
ence top-10 in four of the five
major categories: 16.0 points
(sixth), 10.0 rebounds (second),
2.56 steals (third) and 1.16 blocks
(fourth). She also leads her team in
three-point field goal percentage,
shooting at a .383 clip (18-of-47).
"She is probably the closest
thing we have to a go-to-player,"
USC coach Chris Gobrecht said.
"Ebony is probably our rock —
she's been real steady."
Go toe-to-toe with Hoffman in
side, and you might think she's re
ally a rock. She plays with an inten
sity that's tough to match at times.
"She plays aggressively and

she's really competitive," Stan
ford's Nicole Powell said. "It's al
ways a difficult matchup."
The much-heralded Trojan
forward didn't become a difficult
matc hup overnight, however.
Growing up in Harbor City,
Calif., Hoffman always dreamed of
lacing it up with her older brother.
The problem was, he played
with all his guy friends and
wouldn't let her play.
So she just had to develop a seri
ous toughness and unmatched skill
— and then he let her onto the
court.
But Hoffman is not just known
for her offensive prowess. Stat
junkies should be a bit baffled by
that steals figure — since when
does a post player average close to
three steals a game? But it's just a
given in Hoffman's mind.
"People make the mistake that
since I'm 6'2, I'm slow," Hoffman
said. "Guards throw these little
lofty passes and don't expect that
I can get out there to get them.
It's all about awareness and court
sense — I can feel what people

are going to do before they even
do it."
You wonder how that kind of
sixth sense would translate onto an
even bigger stage.
Hoffman has had her chance to
put her game to the test overseas.
In the summer of 2000 (before
she enrolled at USC), she played on
the USA Women's Junior World
Championship Qualifying Team in
Argentina wiih a select group of su
perstars — including Powell —
under legendary coach and UConn
head man Geno Auriemma.
That go around, Hoffman aver
aged only 6.8 points and 5.6 re

bounds in five games as primarily a
screener, passer and rebounder.
Alter having shoulder surgery
in the summer of 2001, Hoffman
rejoined the squad this summer
and had a much different impact.
The junior averaged a team
leading 13.3 points and 8.8 re
bounds in leading her squad to a
gold-medal finish in Brazil.
The three-year progression
just underscores how far Hoff
man has come since she came to
USC as one of the most highly
touted prospects in the nation
from California high school pow
erhouse Narbonne.

"She's learned how to package
what she's good at," Gobrecht said.
"Ebony always had power and ex
plosiveness, but she's learned fun
damentals and the mental part of
the game."
As USC continues to struggle,
and Hoffman continues to im
prove, she can't help looking ahead
to a future in the YVNBA.
"I've always strived to get to the
highest level," she said. "That's
how I've built my career."
But she hasn't forgotten about
her team in the least.
Hoffman decided not to play
with the U.S. Junior team this com

ing summer because she wanted to
work on her game to get better for
next year.
And the much-maligned Gob
recht can only promise things will
improve.
"We have yet to have all the
pieces in place," she said. "We've al
ways been missing something.
"We feel like next year, we
might be able to give Ebony a com
plete team. We will be that much
older and wiser and the recruiting
class is the most solid class we've
ever brought here."
It's about time the professional
gets to be in her element.

"We have yet to have all the
pieces in place," she said. "We've al

ever brought here."
It's about time the professional
gets to be in her element.
Ebony Hoffman is the con
summate professional. She im
parts the kind of outward confi
dence that forces people to take
her seriously. She boasts an in
ternational pedigree that any
successful player would he jeal
ous of. And, most importantly,
she's lived up to the big-time
billing she confronted after en
tering college as a top-Five
prospect.
But none of the above has
translated into much success tor

her Southern California team
over the last three years.
The Trojans finished below
.500 in Hoffman's freshman year
but put together a better season
last winter-making an appear
ance in the Postseason Women's
NIT — and hopes were high for
an even bigger improvement
this season.
But the 6-foot-2 junior for
ward has seen just more of the
same.
USC, currently fifth in the
l'ac-10, seems destined for yet


JASON CHAN/The Daily Trojan
Junior Ebony Hoffman has lived up to her blue-chip recruit status, but the
Trojan women have been unable to provide her with the supporting cast
necessary to reach the NCAA Tournament.
another disappointing absence
from the NCAA Tournament, bar
ring a hot stretch by the Trojans in
the Pac-10 Women's Tournament.
That's not Hoffman's fault,
though.
Entering tonight's game, the
versatile forward sits in the confer
ence top-10 in four of the five
major categories: 16.0 points
(sixth), 10.0 rebounds (second),
2.56 steals (third) and 1.16 blocks
(fourth). She also leads her team in
three-point field goal percentage,
shooting at a .383 clip (18-of-47).
"She is probably the closest
thing we have to a go-to-player,"
USC coach Chris Gobrecht said.
"Ebony is probably our rock —
she's been real steady."
Go toe-to-toe with Hoffman in
side, and you might think she's re
ally a rock. She plays with an inten
sity that's tough to match at times.
"She plays aggressively and

she's really competitive," Stan
ford's Nicole Powell said. "It's al
ways a difficult matchup."
The much-heralded Trojan
forward didn't become a difficult
matc hup overnight, however.
Growing up in Harbor City,
Calif., Hoffman always dreamed of
lacing it up with her older brother.
The problem was, he played
with all his guy friends and
wouldn't let her play.
So she just had to develop a seri
ous toughness and unmatched skill
— and then he let her onto the
court.
But Hoffman is not just known
for her offensive prowess. Stat
junkies should be a bit baffled by
that steals figure — since when
does a post player average close to
three steals a game? But it's just a
given in Hoffman's mind.
"People make the mistake that
since I'm 6'2, I'm slow," Hoffman
said. "Guards throw these little
lofty passes and don't expect that
I can get out there to get them.
It's all about awareness and court
sense — I can feel what people

are going to do before they even
do it."
You wonder how that kind of
sixth sense would translate onto an
even bigger stage.
Hoffman has had her chance to
put her game to the test overseas.
In the summer of 2000 (before
she enrolled at USC), she played on
the USA Women's Junior World
Championship Qualifying Team in
Argentina wiih a select group of su
perstars — including Powell —
under legendary coach and UConn
head man Geno Auriemma.

aged only 6.8 points and 5.6 re
