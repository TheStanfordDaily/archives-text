# Affirmative action opponents make their point
## One Cookie At A Time 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a controversial af
firmative action protest by the
UCLA Bruin Republicans on
Feb. 3, the Stanford College
Republicans are planning to
hold their own Affirmative Ac
tion Bake Sale later this month.
The UCLA bake sale fea
tured discriminatory pricing in
which black, Latina and Native
American female students
were charged 25 cents fora
cookie; black, Latino and Na
tive American males were
charged 50 cents; white fe
males were charged $1; and
white males and all Asian
Americans were charged $2
per cookie.
"The sale was intended to
drive home to students the ab
surdity of deciding college ad
missions by race through the
pricing structure of the cookies
we were selling," said Bruin
Republicans Chair Andy Jones,
a senior.

The Stanford College Re
publicans' version of the event
should be held sometime in the
next week in White Plaza.
Sophomore Joe Fairbanks,
co-president of the Stanford
group, said, "The UCLA event
was extremely well-orchestrat
ed and hit the nail on the head,
showing how patently absurd
affirmative action is. Hopeful
ly, when students see our bake
sale, they will realize how
ridiculous, racially divisive and
un-American affirmative ac
tion is."
Jones got the idea for hold
ing the bake sale from the New
Mexico State College Republi
cans over a year ago. However,
at the time he felt that the affir
mative action issue was settled
in California through Proposi
tion 209, which prohibited dis
crimination or preferential
treatment to any individual or
group in public employment,
public education, or public
contracting on the basis of race,
sex, color, ethnicity, or national
origin.
The University of Michigan
Supreme Court case seems to
have made the issue fresh again.
In this case, the Supreme Court
will decide if race can continue to
play a part in college admissions.
The case is expected to be decid
ed by June.
The Bruin bake sale was met
with "screams of anger, laughter
and curses," Jones said. As for

counteraction, he said, "Subse
quently, four members of the
African Student Union attended
our meeting and set up an eighth
week debate on affirmative ac
tion with us." He added, "There
were also some angry commu
nists assaulting our table to ask
what we were doing to end social
injustice. When informed that
this was not our job, but that of
the government whom we pay
thousands in taxes, they seemed
to become angrier."
The Stanford Democrats did
not think much of the Bruin
event. Senior Josh Benson, vice
president of the Stanford Democ
rats and editor in chief of the

Stanford Progressive, called the
event "useless grandstanding."
"Like most student conserva
tives, their need for attention is
surpassed only by their need for
new ideas," he said. "I wonder
how many got in through the af
firmative action of having a rich
alumni dad?"
The Democratic student
group is not planning any affir
mative action awareness events.
Senior Heather Hargreaves, a
president of the Stanford De
mocrats, said, "The Stanford De
mocrats are interested in the
topic of affirmative action and we
are following the news.
However, we feel that most stu

dents on campus have seen the
benefits of Stanford's affirmative
action policies," she continued,
"and thus are being educated di
rectly in some of the advantages of
affirmative action."
She concluded, "We do recog
nize that there are different
views out there, and we are will
ing to listen to them. But the ac
tions of the Bruins are not con
ducive to effective communica
tion. I hope that students see the
UCLA incident as what it really
is, a ridiculous ploy to gain at
tention by a club that probably
has little membership in the lib
eral environment of a college
campus."
