The soft piano music floats through Memorial
Church as approximately 30 worshippers bow their
heads in silent prayer. Eventually, the piano crescen
dos into a familiar melody, heads are lifted, and grad
ually everyone begins to sing "Shout to the Lord," a
popular Christian worship song.
The first Mini All-Campus Praise took place on
Sunday, Feb. 9 at 7 p.m., and will continue to take
place at Memorial Church every second Sunday of the
month. The event is sponsored by United in Christ, a
group representing different Christian fellowships
that meet on a regular basis to plan events for the Stan
ford Christian community.
All-Campus Praise, which takes place once a quar
ter, has been run by the UIC for years. But when the
Office for Religious Life offered to let UIC use Memo
rial Church once a month, members of UIC were
thrilled. Seeing the offer as an opportunity for inter
fellowship worship and prayer, they began planning
the first Mini All-Campus Praise.
