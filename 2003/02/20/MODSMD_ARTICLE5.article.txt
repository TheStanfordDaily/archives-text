The soft piano music floats through Memorial
Church as approximately 30 worshippers bow their
heads in silent prayer. Eventually, the piano crescen
dos into a familiar melody, heads are lifted, and grad
ually everyone begins to sing "Shout to the Lord," a
popular Christian worship song.
The first Mini All-Campus Praise took place on
Sunday, Feb. 9 at 7 p.m., and will continue to take
place at Memorial Church every second Sunday of the
month. The event is sponsored by United in Christ, a
group representing different Christian fellowships
that meet on a regular basis to plan events for the Stan
ford Christian community.
All-Campus Praise, which takes place once a quar
ter, has been run by the UIC for years. But when the
Office for Religious Life offered to let UIC use Memo
rial Church once a month, members of UIC were
thrilled. Seeing the offer as an opportunity for inter
fellowship worship and prayer, they began planning
the first Mini All-Campus Praise.

UIC, was pleased by the cooper
ation between her group and the
Stanford community's religious
leaders.
"Reverend Scotty McLennan
and Reverend Joanne Sanders

have been supportive of our efforts
to build unity among Christians at
Stanford," she said. "Last quarter,
Reverend Scotty supported us in
organizing a 24-hour prayer room
in the Old Union Clubhouse."
Putting on the Mini All-Campus
Praise was a united effort, accord
ing to Cyrus. One Christian fellow
ship helped with the music, people
from another put up lliers and sent

out e-mail messages.
The Mini All-Campus Praise
differs from the All-Campus
Praise because it only happens
once a month and is intended to
be informal.
"We have a chance to break off
into smaller groups and pray for
each other," Cyrus said. "It's so
good for us to get together like this,
we're supposed to — as Christians

we're family."
Freshman Alex Carter, who at
tended Mini All-Campus Praise,
appreciated the inter-fellowship
opportunity.
"I thought the whole thing was
really awesome, especially the last
part when we broke off into small
groups and had the opportunity
to pray with people we didn't al
ready know,"he said.
