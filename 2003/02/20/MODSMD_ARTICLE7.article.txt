# Software switch could cause Draw changes
## Changes in Draw could result in an increasingly automated process 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Prompted by the renovation of
housing assignment software,
Residential Education is consider
ing potential Draw guideline
changes that would impact resi

dence selection for both current
and incoming students.
Currently, the University
uses an automated Draw system
called Network for Student In
formation, which stores hous
ing application and assignment
information submitted via
Axess.
Because the software only
runs on the Stanford mainframe,
which will no longer be used
after December, the University
must develop a new housing as

signment system.
"As part of our effort to put this
new system in place, we are also
looking at whether it might be
possible and desirable to change
some of the rules which govern
the housing Draw," said Todd
Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
One such change would be the
elimination of the two-tier draw
method.
"In determining how to build
the new housing assignment sys

tem, another question we might
consider is whether it might be
possible to change the two-tier as
signment system so that students
could go on-line and pick their
room directly," Benson said.
Currently, the Draw is com
prised of a general housing draw
followed by an in-house draw
during which students go to their
assigned house and choose their
individual room.
Similarly, graduate students
are assigned to a particular resi
dence type and then to a particu
lar room by their local residence
staff.
This system would be altered
so that students could select their
room directly, without first choos
ing a house.
Resident Fellows expressed
mixed feelings about the proba
ble change, citing both benefits
and drawbacks.
"It will mean the end of the in
house-draw," said David Beaver,
an RF at Arroyo.
"The in-house draw is the first
opportunity for new residents to
meet each other and to meet the
staff in their new residence. It is
vital to the process of building up
a community for the following
year."
RFs play a large role in resolv
ing housing conflicts that arise as
a result of the draw and have a dif
ferent perspective on the process
as permanent fixtures in on-cam
pus residences.
"The goal of residential educa
tion is not to be streamlined but to
be a community with common ed
ucational and cultural goals,"
Beaver said.
"The places with the best draw
numbers are often among the
places with the least dorm spirit.
Something's got to be wrong with
that."
Despite the extra efficiency
promised by the new system, the
lack of personal contact that could
possibly result is a prominent con
cern among students.
"I think when people are de
ciding where they want to live, the
community and identity of the
house they will live in is a more
important consideration than a
particular room setup," said se
nior Ellen Chang, a college assis
tant in the Freshman / Sopho
more College.
"It seems like it will remove a
lot of the uncertainty about
whether or not you'll get into
your house of choice," said junior
Nicholas Chan, also a CA.
"But there is something cool
about seeing all of your residents
for the first time at in-house
draw."
Another major change being
discussed is the implementation

of a "premier" year in the Draw so
that undergraduates might be
guaranteed one year when they
will have a Draw number between
one and 1,000.
According to Beaver, this
change could cause several prob
lems. With increased turnover
through the Row and other pop
ular houses, nobody will be able to
spend two years in the most cov
eted housing, he said.
"I predict there will be just as
many people glad that they were
guaranteed something they actu
ally wanted in their preferred
year as there will be who are peev
ed that they don't get two pre
ferred years," Beaver said.
The changes remain tentative
and Residential Education is
seeking a broad range of student
feedback before the new system is
put into effect.
So far, the University has
found one company that makes
housing assignment software that
allows students to pick their
rooms directly on the Web.
The company was invited to
campus to give a demonstration
and company representatives
presented their system to two stu
dent focus groups comprised of
both undergraduate and gradu
ate students.
"Feedback was generally
mixed," Benson said. "Graduate
students tended to favor the idea
more than undergrads, but both
were less favorably disposed to
letting students pick their rooms
online if it meant there was only a
limited window of time for each
student to make his or her assign
ment."
Residential Education has also
consulted with student represen
tatives from the Graduate Hous
ing Advisory Committee for addi
tional feedback.
According to Benson, it is like
ly that a student housing assign
ment policy committee will be es
tablished consisting of both grad
uate and undergraduate students
to advise the University adminis
tration on policy questions that
may arise if the new housing soft
ware is implemented.
"The actual cost of running the
new system won't be much differ
ent than the cost of running the
current [Network and Student
Information] system," Benson
said.
He added that"additional
funds will be required to put the
new system in place."

new system won't be much differ
ent than the cost of running the
current [Network and Student
Information] system," Benson
said.
He added that"additional
funds will be required to put the
new system in place."
Prompted by the renovation of
housing assignment software,
Residential Education is consider
ing potential Draw guideline
changes that would impact resi

dence selection for both current
and incoming students.
Currently, the University
uses an automated Draw system
called Network for Student In
formation, which stores hous
ing application and assignment
information submitted via
Axess.
Because the software only
runs on the Stanford mainframe,
which will no longer be used
after December, the University
must develop a new housing as

signment system.
"As part of our effort to put this
new system in place, we are also
looking at whether it might be
possible and desirable to change
some of the rules which govern
the housing Draw," said Todd
Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
One such change would be the
elimination of the two-tier draw
method.
"In determining how to build
the new housing assignment sys

tem, another question we might
consider is whether it might be
possible to change the two-tier as
signment system so that students
could go on-line and pick their
room directly," Benson said.
Currently, the Draw is com
prised of a general housing draw
followed by an in-house draw
during which students go to their
assigned house and choose their
individual room.
Similarly, graduate students
are assigned to a particular resi
dence type and then to a particu
lar room by their local residence
staff.
This system would be altered
so that students could select their
room directly, without first choos
ing a house.
Resident Fellows expressed
mixed feelings about the proba
ble change, citing both benefits
and drawbacks.
"It will mean the end of the in
house-draw," said David Beaver,
an RF at Arroyo.
"The in-house draw is the first
opportunity for new residents to
meet each other and to meet the
staff in their new residence. It is
vital to the process of building up
a community for the following
year."
RFs play a large role in resolv
ing housing conflicts that arise as
a result of the draw and have a dif
ferent perspective on the process
as permanent fixtures in on-cam
pus residences.
"The goal of residential educa
tion is not to be streamlined but to
be a community with common ed
ucational and cultural goals,"
Beaver said.
"The places with the best draw
numbers are often among the
places with the least dorm spirit.
Something's got to be wrong with
that."
Despite the extra efficiency
promised by the new system, the
lack of personal contact that could
possibly result is a prominent con
cern among students.
"I think when people are de
ciding where they want to live, the
community and identity of the
house they will live in is a more
important consideration than a
particular room setup," said se
nior Ellen Chang, a college assis
tant in the Freshman / Sopho
more College.
"It seems like it will remove a
lot of the uncertainty about
whether or not you'll get into
your house of choice," said junior
Nicholas Chan, also a CA.
"But there is something cool
about seeing all of your residents
for the first time at in-house
draw."
Another major change being
discussed is the implementation

of a "premier" year in the Draw so
that undergraduates might be
guaranteed one year when they
will have a Draw number between
one and 1,000.
According to Beaver, this
change could cause several prob
lems. With increased turnover
through the Row and other pop
ular houses, nobody will be able to
spend two years in the most cov
eted housing, he said.
"I predict there will be just as
many people glad that they were
guaranteed something they actu
ally wanted in their preferred
year as there will be who are peev
ed that they don't get two pre
ferred years," Beaver said.
The changes remain tentative
and Residential Education is
seeking a broad range of student
feedback before the new system is
put into effect.
So far, the University has
found one company that makes
housing assignment software that
allows students to pick their
rooms directly on the Web.
The company was invited to
campus to give a demonstration
and company representatives
presented their system to two stu
dent focus groups comprised of
both undergraduate and gradu
ate students.
"Feedback was generally
mixed," Benson said. "Graduate
students tended to favor the idea
more than undergrads, but both
were less favorably disposed to
letting students pick their rooms
online if it meant there was only a
limited window of time for each
student to make his or her assign
ment."
Residential Education has also
consulted with student represen
tatives from the Graduate Hous
ing Advisory Committee for addi
tional feedback.
According to Benson, it is like
ly that a student housing assign
ment policy committee will be es
tablished consisting of both grad
uate and undergraduate students
to advise the University adminis
tration on policy questions that
may arise if the new housing soft
ware is implemented.
"The actual cost of running the
new system won't be much differ
ent than the cost of running the
current [Network and Student
Information] system," Benson
said.
He added that"additional
funds will be required to put the
new system in place."
