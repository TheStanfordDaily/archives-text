# Software switch could cause Draw changes
## Changes in Draw could result in an increasingly automated process

Prompted by the renovation of
housing assignment software,
Residential Education is consider
ing potential Draw guideline
changes that would impact resi

dence selection for both current
and incoming students.
Currently, the University
uses an automated Draw system
called Network for Student In
formation, which stores hous
ing application and assignment
information submitted via
Axess.
Because the software only
runs on the Stanford mainframe,
which will no longer be used
after December, the University
must develop a new housing as

signment system.
"As part of our effort to put this
new system in place, we are also
looking at whether it might be
possible and desirable to change
some of the rules which govern
the housing Draw," said Todd
Benson, director of Housing As
signment Services.
One such change would be the
elimination of the two-tier draw
method.
"In determining how to build
the new housing assignment sys

tem, another question we might
consider is whether it might be
possible to change the two-tier as
signment system so that students
could go on-line and pick their
room directly," Benson said.
Currently, the Draw is com
prised of a general housing draw
followed by an in-house draw
during which students go to their
assigned house and choose their
individual room.
