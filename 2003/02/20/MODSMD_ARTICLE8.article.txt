# El Centro incurs budget cuts
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to the University's current budget
shortfall, El Centro Chicano has been asked
to significantly reduce its Guiding Concilio
fund, a request that was initially interpreted
by some students as a targeting of the center
by University administrators.
In an e-mail sent out to several on-cam
pus group lists, the sender claimed El Centro
was "under attack" and that the proposed
budget cuts would be as high as 50 percent.
However, an explanatory e-mail later sent
by El Centro's leadership clarified that "El
Centro is not being attacked or targeted by

the administration."
"No budget decisions have yet been
made," said Provost John Etchemendy.
"Every single unit on campus has been
asked to return funds from their current
year's budget and also to plan for next year
under a differing and smaller budget sce
narios," he continued. "The Guiding Con
cilio received a similar request," he added,
referring to the portion of El Centro's bud
get that is used to fund Chicano events on
campus.
ASSU President Monica Henestroza, a se
nior, said that the cuts would not be as dras-
tic as some had anticipated.
"I do not expect it to be 50 per
cent," she said.
Director of El Centro Chicano
Frances Morales said that "initial
ly there was some concern" at the
center when the budget cuts were
requested.
"But when we looked at the Uni
versity as a whole," she said, "we
wanted to help the University go
through this budget crisis."
Morales also explained that El
Centro's Guiding Concilio fund is
only a portion of its overall budget.
"In 1991, during the Universi
ty's budget cuts, there was an office
to the President on Chicano af
fairs," she said. "When that office
closed, there was a commitment to
continue that funding through pro
grams for the community."
Morales stressed that the Con
cilio fund is not part of El Centro's
base funding.
"We seek renewal [for the Guid
ing Concilio fund] on a three-year
basis," she stated. "It is not tied to
our base budget. It is from the
Provost's Office to support ongoing
programs in the Chicano commu
nity and new additions."
According to Morales, the
money is distributed to various stu
dent groups that apply for funding
each quarter.
"(There is] an advisory board to
make decisions regarding the fund
ing," she said.
El Centro's Web site described
the makeup of the advisory board
as a representation of the different

constituencies in the community.
Sophomore Emanuel Pleitez,
one of El Centro's program coordi
nators, said that Ballet Folklorico,
Mariachi Cardenal, Stanford Soci
ety of Chicano latino Engineers
and Scientists, and Stanford latino
Law Students Association are
among the groups considered for
funding from the Guiding Concilio.
Pleitez described "a range" of re
actions to the news of the budget cut
requests.
"Some were very infuriated," he
said.
Sophomore Gabriela Arvizu,
who also works at El Centro, agreed
with Pleitez. She described the ini
tial reaction to the potential budget
cuts as "panicked."
"A lot of these organizations
need the funds; we can't supply

[them]," she said. "We need the
funds."
However, Arvizu emphasized
the faith she and others place in El
Centro's leadership and noted that
the situation now "seems to be
under control."
Other community centers will
likely have to adjust their budgets as
well.
Director of the Black Community
Service Center Jan Barker Alexan
der explained, "[although] we have
not yet been asked to cut a specific
fund," the University has requested
that everybody "tighten their belt."
Similarly, John Pearson, direc
tor of Bechtel International Center,
anticipated upcoming budget cuts.
"We will be giving some funds
back this year," he said. "I don't
know how much."

Despite initial concern on a student email list that the El Centro budget will
likely be cut, staff members said that this is only a small part of a special fund
that may be reduced.
