# Despite downward economic trends
## Hospital reports budget surplus 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite an economic slowdown and two consecutive
years of losses, Stanford Hospital & Clinics earlier this
month reported a net profit of $12.5 million for fiscal
year 2002.
As recently as last April, a loss of up to $10 million
was expected.
Stanford Hospital 8c Clinics President and CEO
Martha Marsh said she is optimistic that the hospital
will earn about the same net income this fiscal year.
The hospital's profit goes into its fund balance, used
to pay for supplies, equipment and new capital for hos
pital program development.
She said that the positive financial year would prior
itize new capital. Money will also go to completing the
new Cancer Center, expected to open next year.
"I'm very excited about making the hospital prof
itable [in the] long-term to be able to fund programs in
the future and be successful," Marsh said.
" The management team that is here has really been
focusing on making the hospital successful financially
and has been working hard to do so," Marsh said. "Em
ployees and physicians have really helped us to make
those changes effective."
Marsh took on her position last April and made
changing the hospital's finances a priority for the hos
pital's future.
Focusing on the hospital's costs helped to improve
its finances, Marsh said. The hospital reduced supply
costs by working with doctors and nurses to identify the
best supply vendors and then negotiate contracts with
a limited number of them.
She also looked to make work How and manage
ment improvements to increase efficiency. Marsh said
that improved productivity decreased the need for
adding staff and refilling vacated positions. The hospi
tal also renegotiated its contracts for things such as
medical devices.
"We are so pleased to be able to put Stanford back
on a strong financial footing so we
can reinvest in new programs and
serv ices for patients and their fami
lies," Marsh said.
Reported losses in years prior
accompanied efforts to merge with
and then separate Stanford's facili
ties from the University of Califor
nia-San Francisco Medical Center.
According to Marsh, the hospi
tal lost about $20 million in 2001.
She said that both UCSE and Stan
ford had felt that there were strate
gic advantages to the merger but
that unexpected short-term addi
tional expenses proved too much
for either to absorb.
Marsh noted that the effects of
the merger are still being felt and
that continued management and
strategic adjustments are needed.
She commented that the eco
nomic downturn has continued to
create a volatile health-care envi
ronment, affecting patients' insur
ance and diminishing state and
federal support through
Medicare programs.
However, Marsh said that Stan
ford Hospital is doing well in spite

of this and its performance is com
parable to other hospitals.
"We do things other hospitals
don't do," Marsh said. "Our out
standing service and procedures
will carry us going forward."
The hospital's positive finances
also affected contract negotiations
with Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 715 earlier this
fall, according to SEIU Local 715
Staff Director Greg Bullman.
Hospital support employees,
including nursing assistants, lab
technicians, housekeepers and
other support stall, represented by
SEIU staged a one-day strike in
November after their contract ex
pired. Outstanding issues includ
ed wages, seniority and other
staffing concerns.
The Stanford Hospital's finan
cial turnaround was known in early
August when the two groups began
negotiations to renew a contract
that expired in November. Bull
man said that this made a fair wage
increase and the union's other de
mands feasible.
Subcontracting was also an
issue according to SEIU, since it
was concerned about loss of jobs.
Marsh said that subcontracting is
used as a cost-saving device if
something can be done more effi

ciently and effectively.
A contract was settled in De
cember that included an average
wage increase of 21 percent over
the next three years, the establish
ment of a step-pay system that
gives credit for years of service and
a commitment to training for
workers who lost jobs due to sub
contracting, Bullman said.
However, Marsh said the union
strike and the hospital's positive fi
nances last year are not related.

She said the hospital looks at fair
compensation and market-based
compensation to see what employ
ees should be paid in relation to
the market.
"Really what we look at is em
ployees being paid at a competitive
rate, and that's the driving force,"
Marsh said. "Obviously, to pay
people competitively, it makes a
difference if we are doing well fi
nancially, but the strike was a dif
ferent set of issues."

According to Marsh, the hospi
tal lost about $20 million in 2001.
She said that both UCSE and Stan
ford had felt that there were strate
gic advantages to the merger but
that unexpected short-term addi
tional expenses proved too much
for either to absorb.
Marsh noted that the effects of
the merger are still being felt and
that continued management and
strategic adjustments are needed.
She commented that the eco
nomic downturn has continued to
create a volatile health-care envi
ronment, affecting patients' insur
ance and diminishing state and
federal support through
Medicare programs.
However, Marsh said that Stan
ford Hospital is doing well in spite

of this and its performance is com
parable to other hospitals.
"We do things other hospitals
don't do," Marsh said. "Our out
standing service and procedures
will carry us going forward."
The hospital's positive finances
also affected contract negotiations
with Service Employees Interna
tional Union Local 715 earlier this
fall, according to SEIU Local 715
Staff Director Greg Bullman.
Hospital support employees,
including nursing assistants, lab
technicians, housekeepers and
other support stall, represented by
SEIU staged a one-day strike in
November after their contract ex
pired. Outstanding issues includ
ed wages, seniority and other
staffing concerns.
The Stanford Hospital's finan
cial turnaround was known in early
August when the two groups began
negotiations to renew a contract
that expired in November. Bull
man said that this made a fair wage
increase and the union's other de
mands feasible.
Subcontracting was also an
issue according to SEIU, since it
was concerned about loss of jobs.
Marsh said that subcontracting is
used as a cost-saving device if
something can be done more effi

ciently and effectively.
A contract was settled in De
cember that included an average
wage increase of 21 percent over
the next three years, the establish
ment of a step-pay system that
gives credit for years of service and
a commitment to training for
workers who lost jobs due to sub
contracting, Bullman said.
However, Marsh said the union
strike and the hospital's positive fi
nances last year are not related.

She said the hospital looks at fair
compensation and market-based
compensation to see what employ
ees should be paid in relation to
the market.
"Really what we look at is em
ployees being paid at a competitive
rate, and that's the driving force,"
Marsh said. "Obviously, to pay
people competitively, it makes a
difference if we are doing well fi
nancially, but the strike was a dif
ferent set of issues."
