# Student Affairs does not plan reshuffling
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Dean of Students Marc Wais
prepares to leave for New York
University in March, University ad
ministrators have stated that there
are few immediate plans for change
at Stanford upon his departure.
"Whenever people leave ... it
gives the organization an opportu
nity to rethink things," Wais said,
adding that Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni is
going to lead that process.
"I plan to spend time in consul
tation with the stall in Student Af
fairs and the Dean of Students Of
fice in order to explore the current
structure and consider possible op
tions for the future," Awakuni said.
However, Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John
Bravman said, "I don't think [a re
organization] is going to happen."
At NYU, Wais will be assuming
a role similar to the vice provost for
student affairs, overseeing hous
ing, dining and the athletic de
partment.
"fhe portfolio is much larger
[than dean of students]," Wais
said. "I'll be able to have a much
broader impact."
Wais will be managing around
400 full-time and part-time em
ployees. He noted that the admin
istrative challenges will be com
pletely different at NYU, especial
ly in a time of heightened national
security.
"I'm moving from the epicen
ter of a possible earthquake to the
epicenter of a possible terrorist at
tack," he said.
Wais' first major plan is to work
on creating a system of resident
fellows in the NYU dorms. He will
live in a dorm and hopes to en
courage other faculty to do the
same.
"[l'll be] trying to enhance the
intellectual climate of the resi
dences," he said.
He did acknowledge that, with
a position higher in the adminis
tration, it will be harder to make
contact witli students, which is

what he considers to be the best
part of his job.
"I can't believe I've been here
seven and a half years," he said. "It
underscores how much fun I've
had."
With Wais' departure, one pos
sible change in administrative
structure could be a rearrange
ment of the Dean of Students Of
fice, something which already oc
curred just last year.
When Awakuni arrived last
year from Columbia, the first
major visible change was the cre
ation of a new office of Dean of
Freshmen and Transfer Students.
Julie Lythcott-Haims, former as
sistant to University President John
Hennessy, took on this position in
August last year. She has especially
enjoyed extending the focus on
new students past New Student
Orientation, which she runs.
"As far as I can tell, the [dean of
freshmen and transfer students]
position is indeed filling a void on
campus," she said.
Lythcott-Haims, under her
other title of Assistant Vice
Provost, also supervises the Career
Development Center and the
Haas Center for Public Service,
two organizations that were previ
ously under the jurisdiction of the
dean of students.
Some students have questioned
whether freshmen and transfer
students necessarily connect to the
Haas Center, but Bravman noted
that her role makes as much sense
as many other administration divi
sions.
"A lot of people do stufi beyond
their titles," said Bravman, who is
also a professor of materials sci
ence and engineering and dean of
Freshman / Sophomore College.
"The CDC under her leader
ship has tried to extend its reach to
freshmen," Wais added, noting
that freshmen need to get involved
in service and career development
early.
Lythcott-Haims added, "Criti
cal connections must be made in
the first year if those connections
are to be meaningful."
