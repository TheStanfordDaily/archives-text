# New organs found for teenage girl
## 
### 
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — With
perhaps only hours left to live, the
17-year-old girl mistakenly given a
heart and lungs with the wrong
blood type was miraculously hand
ed another chance yesterday after
doctors — against all odds — lo
cated another set of organs.
Surgeons rushed to transplant
the new heart and lungs intoJesica
Santillan, whose relatives feared
she would be dead by the week
end. She was in critical condition
after the four-hour operation, and
doctors warned it was too early to
say whether she would pull
through.
"She's as critical as a person
could be," Dr. Duane Davis said at
Duke University Hospital.
The Mexican teenager with O
positive blood had waited nearly

three years fora transplant. But in
a mistake that still has not been
fully explained, Duke surgeons
gave her organs from a donor with
type A blood on Feb. 7.
Her body rejected the new or
gans and she suffered a stroke
and had to be put on life support.
Her doctors had held out little
hope of finding a new heart and
lungs in time to save her life, in
part because of her blood types
and because she is so small at 5-
foot-2 and 85 pounds that any or
gans would probably have to
come from a child - and child
donors are rare.
lit new organs were found late
Wednesday.
Lloyd Jordan of Carolina
Donor Services said the donor
family had requested anonymity.

He said the donation was not "di
rected" — that is, the family did
not specifically request that the or
gans be given to Jesica.
"So far, so good," said Renee
McCormick, a spokeswoman fora
charity raising money for Jesica's
care. "Her parents feel some relief
right now. Everyone is incredibly
hopeful and we're just so pleased,
so thankful."
Doctors said Jesica's body suf
fered damage while on she was on
life support.
Jesica and her family moved
from a small town near Guadala
jara, Mexico, to the United States to
get a transplant because a heart de
formity kept her lungs from getting
oxygen into her blood. Doctors said
she would have died within six
months without the transplant.
