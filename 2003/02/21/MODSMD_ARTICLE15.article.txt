WASHINGTON (AP) — A Florida computer
engineering professor and seven other men were
charged yesterday with overseeing and financing
the Palestinian Islamic jihad terrorist group, which
has been blamed for killing more than 100 people
in Israel and adjacent territories.
The University of South Florida professor, 45-
year-old Sami Amin Al-Arian, and three other U.S.
residents were arrested after the 50-count indict
ment was returned by a federal grand jury in
Tampa, Fla. The indictment describes Al-Arian as
the Islamic Jihad's U.S. leader, head of a terrorist
cell in Tampa and secretary of the group's council.

Attorney General John Ashcroft said the indict
ment sends a message: "We will hunt down the sup
pliers of terrorist money, we will shut down their
sources and we will ensure that both terrorists and
their financiers meet the same swift, certain justice
of the United States of America."
Shortly after his arrest in Tampa, Al-Arian told
reporters, "It's all about politics." On forced leave
from the university, he has publicly rejected the
idea that he has ties to terrorism.
His attorney, Nicholas Matassini, said after a
court hearing, "He's a political prisoner right now
as we speak."
