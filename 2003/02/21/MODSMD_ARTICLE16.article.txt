## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Celebrating black culture 
### 
In February, the events of Black History
Month recognize and honor the con
tributions blacks have made and the
struggles they have had in our country.
At Stanford, Black History Month is instead
called Black Liberation Month — to empha
size the role blacks played and will play in the
present and future of American society.
Black History Month — the basis for
Black Liberation Month — evolved out of
Carter Woodson's idea fora "Negro Histo
ry Week" in 1926. At the time, Woodson was
working to have more black American his
tory included in American history books.
Woodson chose February as the appro
priate time for celebration because it in
cludes the birthdays of two men who fought
for the rights of blacks — Frederick Dou
glass and Abraham Lincoln. Other notable
February dates include: the birth of W.E.B.
Dußois, founder of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People
(1868); the passage of the 15th Amendment,
which granted blacks the right to vote
(1870); the founding of the NAACP (1909);
the Greensboro, N.C. sit-in at Woolworth's
(1960); and the death of Malcolm X (1965).
As a part of Black Liberation Month at
Stanford, many groups — including the
Black Student Union, the Black Graduate
Student .Association and the Black Commu
nity Services Center — have organized

events ranging from speakers and alumni
student activities to performances.
Organizers of Black Liberation Month
stress that the events are open to all mem
bers of the Stanford community, and we
echo their call. Stanford students pride
themselves on being a diverse group of stu
dents who celebrate one another's achieve
ments and value one another's differences.
We all claim to be open-minded. But Stan
ford, like any sub-population of America, is
not free from racism and prejudice. Black
Liberation Month is an invaluable opportu
nity for members of the Stanford communi
ty to learn about and respect one another.
The events will help facilitate dialogue and
promote understanding, which will reduce
the racism and ignorance that feed our prej
udiced attitudes and behaviors.
In discussing Black Liberation Month,
it is important to note that it is not only
blacks who benefit from the accomplish
ments those who fought for civil rights.
We all gain from equality of rights. We
can all be inspired by Jesse Jackson, Mal
colm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. We
can all be moved by the words of Maya
Angelou, Toni Morrison and Alice Walk
er. We can all thank Miles Davis, Duke
Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald for their
contributions to jazz.
This is a month we should all celebrate.
