# United for student space
## 
### 
The results are in: Student space re
mains the No. 1 priority for an
outstanding number and array of
student-run organizations.
The ASSU recently launched the Volun
teer Student Organization Feedback pro
ject, an outreach inquiry for identifying var
ious student groups' top concerns. Respon
dents identified availability, cost and quality
of student space as areas needing the most
improvement. Too often, finding — and
securing — space for group meetings or
campus events proves very difficult.
Students and the ASSU have long rallied
for the reconstruction of Tresidder Union as
the solution to the lack of student space on
campus. Although the expansion and im
provement of a student union is certainly
desirable as a long-term solution to the
dearth of student space, the option would
still leave current student groups with
nowhere to go.
Moreover, even the most heavenly
Tresidder imaginable could never fully ad

dress all student space issues — the most
pressing problems do not result from spa
tial, but rather bureaucratic, limitations.
The University gives priority to faculty
when it comes to using classroom space; fac
ulty can arbitrarily refuse to allow groups to
meet in classrooms or auditoriums, even
during hours when those areas are largely
unused.
Another problem facing many student
groups is the fees charged by the Universi
ty to use space. Per-event reservations
through Tresidder Meeting Services and
Stanford Events and Services exact fees far
exceeding quarterly budgets for some
smaller groups.
In its ongoing campaign to increase stu
dent space on campus, we believe that the
ASSU should provide a clear vision, behind
which all students can unite. Looking at the
Black Community Services Center's recent
victory in acquiring more space, we believe
that a collective student body effort is key to
securing more student space.
