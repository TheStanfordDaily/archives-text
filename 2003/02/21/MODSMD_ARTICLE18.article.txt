# ANIMAL FARM
## Meet the parents 
### 
This weekend our campus
transforms. On every
street corner and behind
every palm tree rests a
Stanford Parent. Decked out in
Stanford garb from the Bookstore,
it is clear that this must be. . . . Par
ent's Weekend.
Welcome to all the parents out
there, trying to get a feel for what
it's like to be a student at Stanford.
1 can't speak for the parents.
Thankfully I'm not a mother yet.
But I asked both my mom and dad
what Parent's Weekend means to
them — what they enjoy the most,
how it makes them feel. I got an in
teresting response.
"We like the classes."
Those hour-long lectures of
fered specifically to parents,
taught by the superstar faculty re
ally invigorate Mr. and Mrs. Cic
cone — neither of whom have
been in school for 30 years. They
get really excited when these fa
mous people whom they've read
about in the newspapers come to
life on stage in Cubberley.
Their answer was not really
what 1 expected. And maybe their
response shows the difference be
tween how parents and students
view college education.
For my peers and me, classes
are obviously very important.
That's why we are here — to at
tend lectures and sections and
pump out problem sets. /Ml fora
degree that says "Leland Stanford
Junior University" on it.
But when I really think about it,
the times I learn the most aren't
when I'm in a lecture hall. Yeah, I
do come out of some lectures
starstruck. But the Stanford expe
rience transcends the classroom. I

don't live in a classroom, I live in a
dorm.
And what my parents fail to see
is that our living situations are cen
tral to our intellectual growths.
ResEd (Residential Education
for those of you who don't know
Stanford Speak) works to provide
a healthy, fun atmosphere that is
conducive to learning. And it's al
ways trying to improve the
system — that's

why you just
filled out that
ridiculous ResEd
survey with 24
parts.
Reme mb e r
the first time you
called your dorm
home? You

probably freaked out; I know I
did. But that's what it becomes —
a place where you eat, sleep, so
cialize and party. The bonds you
form with your housemates are so
strong that these people know
things about you that even your
parents don't and probably
shouldn't.
During Parent's Weekend my
freshman year, people in my
house sent out some funny e-mails
to the dormlist asking that we
don't reveal certain secrets to their
parents. One guy asked that no
one mention his tattoo. And who
can forget the obligatory sweep
through before the parents come
in your room — taking down all
(he inappropriate pictures, hiding
the half-full bottle of vodka.
ResEd also establishes a sup
portive academic environment
within the dorm. Resident assis
tants, head peer academic coor
dinators, resident tutors and

other student staff members give
their residents information and
advice ranging from selecting
courses to research opportuni
ties. These people give up their
time to get us through our days.
For some freshmen, this may be
the only connection to upper
classmen they have.
Faculty liaisons live in the
dorms as well. Under our current
system, dorm-dwellers live with
Resident Fellows — incredible fac
ulty members who make it their
top priorities to develop personal
connections with students. They
mentor, teach, chat, befriend, or
even stay out of your life if you
want them to.
Think of all the lessons you
learn by living with other students
and faculty. How to deal with a
random roommate. How to be tol
erant of people you don't like.
How to eat dinner with a professor
and *gasp* talk about something
other than a research paper.
But despite the fact that the
dorm is such an integral part of my
life, my dad doesn't want to come
in when lie visits Stanford. F le feels
uncomfortable. He says he doesn't
want to intrude, that no one wants
him there. He's the dad, he's too
old to be in there with a bunch of
kids.
I can never understand that.
How can he not want to see my
home?
But I guess that's what the dif
ference is. To my parents, my
dorm is just the place where I keep
my stuff. To me, it's at the heart of
mv Stanford education.

courses to research opportuni
ties. These people give up their
time to get us through our days.
For some freshmen, this may be
the only connection to upper
classmen they have.
Faculty liaisons live in the
dorms as well. Under our current
system, dorm-dwellers live with
Resident Fellows — incredible fac
ulty members who make it their
top priorities to develop personal
connections with students. They
mentor, teach, chat, befriend, or
even stay out of your life if you
want them to.
Think of all the lessons you
learn by living with other students
and faculty. How to deal with a
random roommate. How to be tol
erant of people you don't like.
How to eat dinner with a professor
and *gasp* talk about something
other than a research paper.
But despite the fact that the
dorm is such an integral part of my
life, my dad doesn't want to come
in when lie visits Stanford. F le feels
uncomfortable. He says he doesn't
want to intrude, that no one wants
him there. He's the dad, he's too
old to be in there with a bunch of
kids.
I can never understand that.
How can he not want to see my
home?
But I guess that's what the dif
ference is. To my parents, my
dorm is just the place where I keep
my stuff. To me, it's at the heart of
mv Stanford education.
