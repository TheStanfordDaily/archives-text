'Palestinian people live on'
Instead of responding directly to the
guest column "Support necessary for Is
rael; transcends faith, nationality" (Feb.
19), I would like to highlight the most im
portant issue in this conflict.
Who lived in the country the authors
call Israel before its creation? There was a
people, a culture, a society: there was
Palestinian life existing in peace. This
great democracy the authors call Israel is
responsible for arguably the worst hu
manitarian crisis and injustice in the 21st
century and is continuing to this day. The
Palestinian refugee disaster is the most
enduring largest refugee problem the
world has seen.
Israel is responsible for the occupation
of the Palestinian people and the denial of
their human rights. To this day there is a
humanitarian crisis in the West Bank and
Gaza. Why shall we support Israel, a coun
try that is responsible for these great injus
tices?
Despite all of this, the Palestinian peo
ple live on. Tonght we will have a booth at
the International Gala at the Alumni Cen
ter. We will be representing Palestine as a

nation with a culture, a people, a society
that will live on.

Petition attacked anti-Semitism,
not Palestine
Regarding Thomas Taylor's letter to
the editor, "Link between anti-Semitism
and anti-Israeli sentiment?" (Feb. 19), I
would like to point out that the petition
sponsored by the Stanford Israel Alliance,
which appeared in Tuesday's Daily, was
not about Palestine. The 1,500 students
who signed the document were simply
and unequivocally expressing their sup
port for the existence of the state of Israel.
I would venture to guess most Stanford
students — myself and many of the other
signers included — support the creation
of a democratic Palestine that will exist in
peace and prosperity alongside its neigh
bor. This just belief reflects the sentiment
in Israel, where a vast majority supports
the peaceful, two-state solution. Sadly, this
is not a belief shared by many of Israel's
detractors, both here on campus and
across the world.While Israelis recognize
the rights of both peoples to independence

and statehood, many anti-Israel activists —
those arguing for "peace and justice" —
consistently deny Israel's very right to
exist. The anti-Zionist belief, which states
that all people have the right to sell-deter
mination except the Jews, is thus essential
ly anti-Semitic. It is this very sort of racism
which the petition is attacking.

College Republicans' bake sale needs to
'improve its accuracy'
The Stanford College Republicans' pro
posed Affirmative Action Bake Sale, report
ed in "Affirmative action opponents make
their point one cookie at a time" (Feb. 20),
would charge white men and Asian Ameri
cans $2 fora cookie while charging less to
white women and members of other mi
nority groups. The goal is to show that af
firmative action is "absurd" and "un-Amer
ican." It's a clever stunt. But I have one sug
gestion that might improve its accuracy. Be
fore selling the cookies at their proposed
prices, the Stanford Republicans should
give their customers money with which to
buy the cookies: $2 to white men, $ 1.50 to
Asian Americans, $1.25 to black and Lati
no men, $1 to white women, 80 cents to

Latina women, and 50 cents to Native
Americans. This wages reflect the relative
levels of income among these groups in
the United States today, and demonstrates
the kinds of continuing inequities that af
firmative action is meant to reduce. Per
haps what's "un-American" is not affirma
tive action, but a society in which women
and minorities still earn far less than white
men do.

Discrimination is not 'purely a
racial phenomenon'
I applaud the Stanford College Re
publicans' willingness to take a stand
against a policy they oppose, as reported
in "Affirmative Action opponents make
their point, one cookie at a time" (Feb.
20). But I believe their proposed bake
sale does not illustrate the entire issue. In
opposing affirmative action, they are op
posing a discriminatory system of treat
ment based on an "absurd" factor. If this
is so, then they should widen their bake
sale to include cookies that arc 25 cents
for legacy students and alumni, $1 for
those who are not; 50 cents for those from
geographically underrepresented re

gions, $2 from those who are not; $1 for
those who attended prep schools and
$ 1.50 for those who did not.; and 5 cents
for those born to famous parents and $2
for those no(.
Coming from a certain geographical
region, having a certain talent or having
a family friend on the board of trustees
are factors just as arbitrary (or "absurd")
as one's race but still influential in the col
lege admissions process. Do these factors
necessarily determine our level of intelli
gence or right to admission? No.
It is admirable that the Stanford Col
lege Republicans are fighting for their vi
sion of what the world should be. But I
hope that they do not see discrimination
as a purely racial phenomenon; in reality,
discrimination in the college admissions
process falls along a variety of categories.
If the Stanford College Republicans wish
to fight unfair policies of discrimination,
they must broaden their scope to include
the many different discriminations that
exist in our country. Focusing on one type
of discrimination while ignoring the rest
will not bring us any closer to the ideals
upon which our country was founded.

Parents should be informed about
'areas in which Stanford can do
better'
I would like to address this let
ter to all the parents who are on
campus for Parents' Weekend.
Welcome to Stanford Universi
ty. Over the course of the week

end, you will no doubt be im
pressed by the many resources
Stanford has to offer its students.
From world-class professors to
dazzling labs, undergraduate re
search grants to student-run orga
nizations, Stanford distinguishes
itself as an academic institution.
One other way Stanford sets
itself apart from other universi
ties is through the presence of
the Hoover Institution. The
Hoover Institution is widely re
garded in media publications
such as The Economist as a con

servative think tank; indeed, it
is the only major research insti
tution at the University whose
mission statement contains an
overt political goal. Because of
the explicit political bias of the
institution, the integrity of (he
University as a setting free from
institutional orthodoxy is tar
nished. Prof. Emeritus John
Manley wrote a Daily guest col
umn, "Different interests have
led to the corruption of a uni
versity" (Feb. 12), that the
Hoover Institution reflects a

"perversion of [the Univesity's]
mission" for just this reason.
So, while you are here, 1 en
courage you to get to know not
only the parts of Stanford we
should all be proud of but also
those areas in which Stanford can
do better.
Other student concerns include
issues of socio-economic diversity
among the student body, the Uni
versity's commitment to affirma
tive action, the lack of adequate
student space for community cen
ters and the role of student partic
ipation in formulating campus
labor policy.
You have sacrificed much to help
us get here, and you deserve to

know much more about this Uni
versity than you might to find in the
official Parents' Weekend guide.

Clarifying Stanford's intolerance
protocol
I am writing to applaud The
Daily's editorial, "Combatting in
tolerance" (Feb. 20). I agree with
The Daily that Stanford is not in
sulated from acts of intolerance
and that we must do more to ed
ucate the campus community
about such acts. However, I

would like to clarify two points in
the editorial. First, Stanford has
not "been witness to many hate
crimes over its long history." The
overwhelming majority of the re
ported acts of intolerance do not
rise to the level of a hate "crime"
although they are disturbing and
hurtful to many in our communi
ty. This is an important distinc
tion. Second, Stanford has a na
tionally recognized response pro
tocol that provides immediate
and, when appropriate, continu
ing support to targeted victims of
reported acts of intolerance.
