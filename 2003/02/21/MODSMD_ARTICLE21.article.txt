# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Blind support for Israel contradicts democratic values 
### NAEL FAKHRY KAREEM GHANEM GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Wednesday's column by Avi Yotam and
Morris Cohen ("Support for Israel neces
sary; transcends faith, nationality") was
unsettling fora number of reasons. Yotam
and Cohen say that support for Israel
should transcend nationality and faith.
Their argument — that those who do not
support Israel are opposed to democracy
and freedom — is deeply offensive at the
most fundamental level.
Americans should not fall for the claim
that Israel is a democracy like the United
States. To begin with, Israel is a Jewish
state where state preference goes to Jews
over all others. Often, it is claimed that Is
rael gives voting rights to its Arab minori
ty. This is only nominally true.
The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspa
per, reported on Jan. 3 that the Israeli gov
ernment attempted to prevent two Arab-
Israeli citizens from running in the most
recent elections. This is nothing new, as the
government limited the political participa
tion of Arabs during the military rule of
1949 to 1966. In the United States, even
when we disagree with the perspectives of
others, we allow those perspectives to be
heard. That is the essence of democracy.
Not only is Israel not a true democracy,

it is neither a bastion of freedom nor a pro
moter of peace. It illegally occupies the
Golan Heights, Chebaa Farms, East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip — all in violation of countless U.N.
resolutions. Under the Israeli occupation
— which is currently in its 35th year —
Palestinians are denied access to certain
roads that may only be used by Jews.
Moreover, in 1983, the Israeli govern
ment's Kahan Commission found current
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon indirectly re
sponsible for the massacre of hundreds
(possibly thousands) of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon's Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps in 1982.
And despite all of this, Israel — a nation
whose population is about three-quarters
the size of New York City's — is the biggest
recipient of U.S. foreign aid, expected to
rake in a whopping $2.9 billion in U.S. tax
payer money in 2003 in addition to $2 bil
lion in loan guarantees. The Christian Sci
ence Monitor reports that, adjusted to
2001 dollars, Israel has cost U.S. taxpayers
$240 billion since 1973.
To put these numbers in perspective,
President Bush recently pledged to spend
about $3 billion per year on the 29 million
Africans who currently have HIV or AIDS.
This huge discrepancy is made possible
because Americans are bombarded with
false reasons as to why the relationship be

tween the U.S. and Israel is a sacred one
that must be nurtured and maintained well
into the future. Take, for example, the hol
low rhetoric employed in the Stanford Is
rael Alliance's column that Israel is a myth
ical place "where desert becomes forest."
Those of us who fail to be seduced by
such language will recall that only 3.7 per
cent of Israel's territory is actually covered
by forest — it's in the Middle East, after
all. More importantly though, we are
among many who remember that long
before Israel existed, a Palestinian Arab
majority had inhabited the land for cen
turies and produced a vibrant and pro
ductive society.
It is interesting that Yotam and Cohen
mention the right of Arab women to vote in
Israel. Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Lebanon,
Syria, Egypt, Iran, Tunisia, Sudan,
Yemen, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey are also
examples of Middle Eastern nations where
women can and do vote. As that list shows,
however, voting rights do not always trans
late into real political power.
Israeli Arabs face job discrimination
that is perfectly legal under Israeli law. For
example, Israeli employers are allowed to
require military service of prospective em
ployees. Most Israeli Arabs, however, can
not serve in the Israeli military, making
them ineligible for many jobs. Arabs have
faced discrimination in obtaining state ser

vices such as education grants for the same
reason. In Israel today, Arabs are poorer
and have less access to health services,
eduction and state support than their fel
low citizens who are Jewish.
Unequivocally and without question,
Israel's people have a right to live free of
terror and violence. But morality de
mands that we affirm that Palestinians
share the same right. Too often, though,
whether in the case of Israel or in the case
of other corrupt regimes like those of
Egypt or Saudi Arabia, we have been will
ing to turn a blind eye to anti-democratic
governments when it seems easy to do so.
The current situation in the Israeli-occu
pied territories shows this to be a disas
trous policy.
The Bush administration's negligence
in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict over the past two and a half years has
essentially given the Sharon government a
green light to send in Israeli troops armed
with the most advanced American military
hardware — all a gift of U.S. taxpayers —
in order to attack Palestinians. The Israel
Defense Forces (a disingenuous name if
ever there were one) frequently demolish
es Palestinian homes in an effort to humil
iate and intimidate.
The Israeli Committee Against House
Demolitions estimates that since Septem
ber 2000, nearly 5,500 homes have been

destroyed in the West Bank alone, leaving
tens of thousands homeless. In case any
one thought Israel's campaign against the
Palestinians was truly a "war on terror,"
the Washington Post reports that about
1,800 Palestinians have died, compared to
about 700 Israelis over the last 29 months.
How many of these 2,500 people do you
think were terrorists and how many were
innocent civilians?
As Americans who believe in democra
cy and freedom, we should all support
regimes that embody these noble princi
ples. Unfortunately, Israel does not de
serve to be considered as a democratic
ally. To say this is not anti-American or
anti-democratic, and most certainly, not
anti-Semitic.
Those of us who sincerely believe in the
possibility of peace in the Middle East will
not be bullied into silence by sloganeers
who proclaim, "You're either with us or
with the terrorists." It is belief in die truth,
not blind support for Israel, which tran
scends faith and nationality.
