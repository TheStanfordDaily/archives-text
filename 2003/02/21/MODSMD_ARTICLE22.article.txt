# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## ASSU should not endorse affirmative action 
### HENRY TOWSNER GUEST COLUMNIST 
The majority, probably the vast majori
ty, of Stanford students support affirma
tive action. But does that mean that the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate should have
officially endorsed it on behalf of the stu
dent body?
The main argument in favor is that,
since many students feel strongly about
the issue, and since it is clearly a student
issue, the ASSU should support affirma
tive action because it furthers the will of the
students. But that doesn't really follow:
We all know that an endorsement from
the ASSU will have no impact on a
Supreme Court decision, so the will of the
students doesn't really get furthered at all.
There is still some benefit from passing the

resolution — the political benefit of speak
ing together with the people the ASSU
represents, the moral benefit of speaking
up fora just position (assuming one does
support affirmative action) and the gener
al benefit of adding the ASSU's voice to a
chorus which might have more impact
than any one voice in particular.
Those are all nice things, but they need
to be balanced against the substantial costs
of passing a resolution. First and foremost,
plenty of students do not support affirma
tive action. The ASSU is a democratic sys
tem, which means the majority can over
ride them, but it's not a majoritarian system
— the minority has rights which deserve
protection. When the ASSU issues a state
ment on behalf of the student body, it com
pels speech from those who disagree.
There is a balance to be struck between the

desires of the many and the rights of the
few, but the ASSU needs to strike a balance,
not run thoughtlessly towards the majority.
Even for those who support the reso
lution, there is a cost. Almost no one,
probably including the 11 people who
voted for the resolution, agrees with it en
tirely. In order to make a single statement
on behalf of the student body, the ASSU
will have to sacrifice the nuances of ev
eryone's view. Of course, this happens
with any collective statement, including
every time someone signs a petition. But
with a petition, students can decide for
themselves whether it does a good
enough job of expressing their own
views. With a resolution, the ASSU makes
one decision, for all of us.
The ASSU needs to take the dissenting
minority seriously and weigh the substan

tial harm done to them against the benefit
to the majority. Rather than trying to be
the student voice, taking a specific stand
on controversial issues and alienating stu
dents without helping anyone, the ASSU
should be the student megaphone, finding
ways to make it easier for students to speak
their own opinions. It should bring politi
cians to campus, not just to tell us things,
but to listen to us. It should provide
groups with support — not just money,
but organizational resources, to help them
organize. It should challenge the Office of
Student Activities to stop harassing politi
cally active groups of every ideological
stripe.
These ideas are out there — the current
president and vice president ran on this
very promise — but instead of following
through, the ASSU has delivered yet an

other resolution whose only effect is to
drive away the student body.
The students who want to see the ASSU
get involved are right about one thing: the
ASSU shouldn't be limited to issues every
one agrees on. It should get involved with
every issue important to students, no mat
ter how controversial. But it can do that
without pretending to speak for everyone.
The Associated Students are a democracy,
but as any activist will tell you, democracy
isn't about electing people and then sitting
back while they fix things. It's about hav
ing the opportunity, the right and the obli
gation to help fix things yourself.
