painfully obvious that (he No. 21
Stanford men's basketbal team

Thursday: Stanford 73, USC 67
at UCLA, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Fact: The Cardinal is 9-2 in
games in which the outcome was
decided by six points or less.
And last night's 73-67 Cardinal
victory over unranked USC was no
different.
It was a high-scoring first halt de
spite both teams' decision to go zone
defense. USC jumped to an early
five-point lead with nine minutes
left to play in the half. Senior point
guard Julius Barnes, who struggled
from the field early, then scored a
slicing lay up through traffic to
bring the Cardinal back within
three. The resulting 10-4 Stanford
run culminated at just below the
five minute mark, when Stanford
sophomore Josh Childress forced a
Desmon Farmer turnover and fin
ished with a fast break slam bring
ing the score to 30-29.
The teams played each other
evenly for the rest of the half and
went into the locker room at the
break with the score tied, 38-38.
Justin Davis led the Cardinal
with 11 first-hall points on 3-for-5
shooting from the field and 5-for-6
shooting from the charity stripe.
The opening of the second half
saw more of the same, as neither
team was able to string together any

offensive runs.
USC scored easy layups, capital
izing on fast break opportunities
which resulted from quick outlet
passes. The Trojans scored 14
points off turnovers and 11 fast
break points. Stanford, on the other
hand, was forced to take a more me
thodical approach to scoring due to
the Trojan fullcourt press and zone.
The Cardinal took 61 shots to
USC's 76, but managed to finish
with a higher shooting percentage
in every offensive category.
The biggest story of the game,
however, was Stanford's struggle to
rebound the ball defensively as the
Trojans grabbed 22 offensive re
bounds — 15 in the second half
alone — and scored 16 second
chance points.
"We were having a hard time on
the offensive glass, granted we were
playing small," Montgomery said.
"But we were really struggling."
Stanford finally put a run to
gether with three minutes left to
play when Davis was fouled in the
act of shooting a reverse layup. He
made the shot and the free throw,
breaking the 65-65 tie and putting
Stanford up by one.
The Davis 3-point play was fol
lowed 40 seconds later by a clutch 3-
pointer by Matt Lottich, extending
the Cardinal lead to four.
With 28 seconds remaining in
the game and the Cardinal up by
two, Trojan center Rory O'Neil
used his last foul on Stanford sopho
more Nick Robinson in order to
stop the clock. The foul, USC's
10th, put Stanford in the double
bonus and Robinson capitalized by
hitting both to put the Cardinal up

by four, 71-67.
"Once again, everything kind of
fell into place when we needed it
to," Montgomery said. "Nick's free
throws were huge [because] that
made it a two-possession game."
On the opposite end, after run

ning 15 seconds off the clock, (JSC's
Errick Craven missed a contested
three-pointer and Childress
grabbed the rebound. He quickly
outleted the ball to Davis who

extended Stanford's lead to four.
