# Baseball gears up to mess with Texas

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
They say everything's bigger
in Texas, ancl this weekend at
Disch-Falk Field in Austin, that
adage will certainly hold true.
Starting this afternoon, the
No. 10 Cardinal heads to the
Lone Star State to renew its rival
ry with the defending national
champions, No. 4 Texas, in a
three-game series that will mark
the teams' 12th, 13th and 14th
meetings in the past three sea
sons.
Stanford (7-5) enters the series
riding a season-high four-game
winning streak. The Longhorns
(11-1) are off to their best start
since 1995, and intent on defend
ing their home turf in what has
become one of college baseball's

best rivalries.
"We've played them five times
in the past two years in the post
season alone, so it's turned into a
real big rivalry," coach Mark Mar
quess said.
Until last season's College
World Series, the Cardinal had
gotten the better of Texas in re
cent meetings. In the 2001
Sunken Diamond regional, Stan
ford knocked off the Longhorns
in back-to-back Sunday games
while facing elimination in order
to advance to the super regional
round.
The first of those two games
saw Stanford scratch out a 1 (Win
ning, 10-9 win by overcoming a
nearly disastrous three-run,
game-tying homer by Texas's Ben
King in the ninth. Four hours
later, the Cardinal edged the
Longhorns 4-3.
Last season, the Longhorns re
turned the favor, twice defeating
the Cardinal and keeping Stan
ford out of the national champi
onship game for the first time in
three years.
So, will revenge be on the
minds of the Cardinal players?
"It's easy to say that, but I don't
think that's the case," Marquess
said. "We've got a different team
this year with new guys in new
roles."
While their coach may play
down the revenge angle, last
year's losses in Omaha are well re
membered by the Cardinal play
ers. Junior Sam Fuld said before
the season even began, he
couldn't wait for the trip to Texas
and a chance to take on the team
that ended the Cardinal's nation
al title hopes last year.
The focal point of this week
end's marquee matchup will be
the talented pitching staffs of both
squads.
Texas boasts impressive depth
on the mound — even by Stan
ford's standards — and Long
horns head coach Augie Garrido
will hold his ace, Justin Simmons,
for tomorrow's game instead of
today's 12:30 p.m. tilt.
Instead, Texas's Danny
Muegge will set out against Stan
ford junior John Hudgins today.
Muegge recorded just eight ap
pearances last season after trans
ferring from community college
but now finds himself at the top
of the Longhorns' rotation.
Hudgins, whose brilliant outings

thus far have kept Stanford
afloat, brings a 28-to-3 strikeout
to-walk ratio into this after
noon's contest.
In today's series opener, Hud
gins will need to cuff a much-im
proved Longhorns lineup that is
batting .333 as a team thus far. The
Longhorns also have remarkable
speed and have notched 14 triples
and stolen an incredible 31 of 37
bases in just 12 games.
Simmons, a junk-throwing
lefty that threw a 10-inning
shutout of the Cardinal last year
at Sunken Diamond, had his best
start of the season last week and
will be a tough match-up for to
morrow's Stanford starter, senior
Ryan McCally.
McCally fills in for senior Tim
Cunningham, who Marquess
said suffered a broken pinky
after his start last Saturday and
will be unavailable for the next
few weeks, perhaps until the end
of March.
While Sunday's starters are still
undecided, two relievers in par

ticular should factor heavily into
the series this weekend. Texas's
sophomore closer, Huston Street,
finished last season with a 4-1
record, 14 saves and a mind-bog
gling 0.96 ERA in 47 innings. His
2003 start has been slow, but Car
dinal batters will surely remem
ber the electric fastball that froze
them in Omaha last season.
Cardinal freshman Mark Ro
manczuk's hot start mirrors that
of Street's 2002 campaign, as the
right-hander has not allowed a
run and has yielded just three hits
in his 9 2/3 innings this season.
One final advantage for the
Cardinal this weekend may be its
experience early this season
against high-caliber teams, such
as Cal State Fullerton and Florida
State, despite losing five of those
six games. Though the Long
horns return many players from
last year's national championship
squad, their opponents so far this
year have been far inferior to the
Stanford team they host this
weekend.

Junior centerfielder Sam Fuld gets up after diving into first. Fuld currently
ranks fifth on Stanford's all-time batting average list with a .355 lifetime
mark and hopes his bat stays hot as the Cardinal takes on Texas this week
end.
