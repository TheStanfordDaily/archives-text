# Softball heads South

### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While proud Stanford parents
arrive on the Farm this weekend,
the moms and dads of the No. 12
Stanford softball team (10-2) will
be following their daughters to
Columbus, Ga.
The NFCA LeadofFClassic, the
most competitive preseason tour
nament in collegiate softball, will
host 24 teams — 19 of which
fought their way to NCAA postsea
son play in 2002.
The Cardinal promises to be
challenged this weekend as it takes
the field with No. 3 Nebraska (9-1),
North Carolina (5-3), and South
ern Mississippi (4-3).

The Nebraska Cornhuskers
travel to Georgia having moved
lip a spot in the national rankings
and lost just one matchup so far
this season to top-ranked UCLA.
But the Cardinal just jumped for
ward two spots in the nation's top
-25 and is coming off winning the
title at the first-ever Stanford Invi
tational.
Leading the charge for the
Cornhuskers at the plate is Lisa
Wangler, batting .411 on the sea
son, with five home runs. Nebras
ka hurler Summer Tobias is
recording a perfect 4-0 record in
the circle.
Although the Cornhuskers are
the only other ranked team in the
Cardinal pool, the squads from
North Carolina and Southern Mis
sissippi will be out to show that
they can compete against a Pacific
-10 Conference powerhouse.
North Carolina arrives this
weekend having yet to face a team
from the West Coast. Tiffany
Tolleson of UNC will try to contin
ue her success in the box — she
currently boasts a .526 batting av
erage
Working to shut down the Tar
Heel bats will be Stanford seniors
Tori Nyberg and Maureen
LeCocq, junior Dana Sorensen,
and freshman Laura Severson.
The four-woman Cardinal stall is
undefeated in its last eight games,
and two-time All American
Sorensen has yet to produce any
thing but a Stanford victory after
returning from a medical redshirt.
Trying to change the luck of
this dominant Stanford stall will be
the Lady Eagles of Southern Mis
sissippi. The leading hot bats for
Southern Miss are held by Sarah
Boyd and Amanda Brown who are
hitting .450 and .389, respectively.
But if the Stanford bats are as
productive as they were last week
end, the Lady Eagles better come
out ready to play.
Leading the Cardinal at the
plate is freshman lead-off hitter
and shortstop Lauren Lappin.
Lappin is batting a team high .543
with seven RBI so far in her 12-
game collegiate career.
