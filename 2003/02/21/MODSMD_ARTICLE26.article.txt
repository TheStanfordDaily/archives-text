# Women of Troy fail to contain Powell
## 
### NATHAN KURZ EDITORIAL STAFF 
After surviving one of its worst halves of
the season, the the Stanford women's bas
ketball team knew it had to make a few ad
justments to defeat the University of
Southern California.

Women's Basketball
Thursday: No. 8 Stanford , USC
vs. UCLA, Saturday, 12 p.m.

The easiest decision of all was the most
important in the end.
Stanford got junior All-American
Nicole Powell more involved offensively.
Powell, held to only four points in the
first half, scored 18 after intermission and
added 16 rebounds and eight assists, lift
ing No. 9 Stanford (21-3, 13-2 Pacific-10

Conference) to a 63-55 victory over USC
(12-14, 7-8).
"I just tried to make sure 1 was aggres
sive," Powell said. She was named one of
20 finalists for the Naismith Player of the
Year award earlier this week. "We ran
some different things on offense in the sec
ond half, [too]."
With Stanford's win and second-place
Washington's surprise 100-86 loss at Ore
gon State, the Cardinal clinched a tie for its
third-straight Pac-10 Conference Champi
onship. It is Stanford's 12th such title in the
brief 17-year history of the conference.
But after shooting a woeful 36.9 per
cent from the field — Stanford's worst
shooting day since losing at Tennessee in
mid-December — the Cardinal owed
Powell a big thank-you for her second-half
rescue effort.
With the game deadlocked at 33 early

in the second half, Powell nailed a 3-point
er from the top of the key to put the Car
dinal ahead for good. Two possessions
later, she followed up a T'Nae Thiel miss
with a put-back and a 3-point play.
The Trojans eventually pulled within
51-47 with 7:37 remaining, but that only
signaled Powell to pull out the dagger on
the next possession.
With the shot clock at three, the junior
forward took an out-of-bounds pass, drove
furiously towards the hoop, pulled up just
inside the key, and nailed a mid-range
leaner as the shot clock expired.
After that, USC folded and Stanford's
Pac-10 reign survived yet another year.
Such an ending seemed impossible
after watching the first 10 minutes of the
contest.
USC soared ahead 12-2 after only four
minutes — hitting a 3-pointer here, con
verting a transition basket there. Stanford
seemed sluggish, starting the game 4-for
-21 from the field.
USC eventually stretched the lead to as
much as 15 behind a 3-2 zone that put the
Cardinal out of sync.
But the Trojans saw all that momentum
they had built go down the drain in one cu
rious moment.
As sophomore Kelley Suminski nailed
her only 3-pointer of the game coming off
a screen from Susan King, Trojan guard
Aisha Hollans was whistled fora blocking
foul on the screener, King.
The sophomore point guard then con
verted both free throws— sealing a live
point possession — to pull Stanford within
six and get the Maples Pavilion crowd
rocking for the first time all evening.
That play catalyzed a 15-0 run for the
Cardinal, turning what had appeared to
be a blowout into a tight affair.
"Wejust had to find our rhythm," Sum
inski said. "Wejust started a little slow, but
after we settled down, we picked it up.
"That should be a goal of ours, the next
game, to come out strong from the very be
ginning."
USC coach Chris Gobrecht was less
than thrilled with the foul call to say the
least.
"112 low can you have something happen
afterwards, count the shot, and then in
retro, [add] the free-throws?" she asked.
And her rant on the officiating didn't
stop there.
She also faulted the three-man crew for
singling out leading scorer Ebony Hoff
man—putting her in foul trouble during
most of the second half—in what wasclear-

When asked if that absence was
what changed the complexion of
the game, Gobrecht laughed sar
castically and jeered: "We'll all be
taking some ice baths tonight for
the bruises."
