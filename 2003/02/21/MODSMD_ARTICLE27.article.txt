It used to be a horse and now it's a
table.
But this isn't a story about taxidermy
gone awry.
The introduction of the vaulting table
is the biggest change in gymnastics
equipment since the introduction of —
you guessed it — the vaulting horse.
The table, which bears an uncanny re
semblance to a tongue, effectively triples
the size of the gymnast's target.
The No. 12 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team (1-1, 1-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) and the No. 8 Stan
ford women (7-2-1,3-1-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) have been trying to adjust to the
new apparatus without missing a step.
In fact, Stanford boasts the first NCAA
champion on the vaulting table. Junior
Dan Gill, whose 2001 campaign culmi
nated in Ail-American honors on the old
horse, won the NCAA vault title last year
after revamping his vault to suit the
wider table.
"The table allows for safer training

and higher difficulty vaults," said men's
coach Thom Glielmi.
Though unanimously considered an
improvement in men's gymnastics, the
transition to the table is more complicat
ed for women, who now travel an addi
tional three feet just to clear the appara
tus.
Missing the horse used to be a worry
for many gymnasts, especially on
Yurchenko-style vaults — a round-oil
back handspring onto the equipment
performed by seven of the Cardinal
women — where the athlete cannot see
their target during takeoff.
"The new table is great for power ath
letes because they don't have to worry
about controlling their energy to hit a
smaller mark," women's assistant coach
Larissa Fontaine said. Fontaine should
know — she won the 1998 NCAA vault
ing championship, marking the Farm's

first women's national title.
"The table has made the diffi
culty of vaults skyrocket at the col
legiate level," Fontaine added.
"The result is that vault has be
come much more of a power event
than it used to be for women."
The change has helped junior
Lise Leveille, the Lady Cardinal's
top all-arounder. After not com
peting on vault last season, Lev
eille is finding her groove on the
table in 2003.
"Now I can go all out on all my

vaults without worrying about
control or missing the horse, and
that let's me focus on my tech
nique to execute a more precise
vault," Leveille said.
Another Cardinal woman un
fazed by the change is junior
Kendall Beck, who hopes to repeat
the first team All-America honors
she earned on the apparatus in
2002.
"It took a while to get used to
the new equipment, especially be
cause it's so much longer than the
old vault," Beck said. "I think the
table will make collegiate competi
tion harder, because now athletes
will have to do something extra to
distinguish themselves."

The Stanford gym program
looks to earn two wins this week
end as they square-off in a co-ed
meet at Maples Pavilion: The men
face off with the Air Force (0-3, 0-
2) as the women challenge No. 8
Arizona State (5-3, 2-3).
The men are looking to re
bound from their loss to California
last week. The team shouldn't
have too much trouble against the
17th-ranked Air Force Academy;
in a sport where scores have three
significant digits, the Falcon's
highest team score is a whopping
14 points lower than Stanford's
lowest team score this season.
The small men's squad com
pete without senior Cade Raggio,

the nation's top-ranked gymnast
on the pommel horse. Raggio is
out this weekend due to wrist in
flamation.
"At this point in the season it is
best if he rests his wrists for
NCAAs," said Glielmi. "It gives the
freshmen a great oportunity to
step in."
The match-up against the Sun
Devils also brings women's head
coach Kristen Smyth face-to-face
with the squad she coached before
her arrival on the Farm. ASU
holds a 14-4 lead in the all-time se
ries against Stanford, but those
losses have come from the Sun
Devils' last four matchups against
the Cardinal.
