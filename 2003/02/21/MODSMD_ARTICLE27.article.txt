It used to be a horse and now it's a
table.
But this isn't a story about taxidermy
gone awry.
The introduction of the vaulting table
is the biggest change in gymnastics
equipment since the introduction of —
you guessed it — the vaulting horse.
The table, which bears an uncanny re
semblance to a tongue, effectively triples
the size of the gymnast's target.
The No. 12 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team (1-1, 1-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) and the No. 8 Stan
ford women (7-2-1,3-1-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) have been trying to adjust to the
new apparatus without missing a step.
In fact, Stanford boasts the first NCAA
champion on the vaulting table. Junior
Dan Gill, whose 2001 campaign culmi
nated in Ail-American honors on the old
horse, won the NCAA vault title last year
after revamping his vault to suit the
wider table.
"The table allows for safer training

coach Thom Glielmi.
Though unanimously considered an
improvement in men's gymnastics, the
transition to the table is more complicat
ed for women, who now travel an addi
tional three feet just to clear the appara
tus.
Missing the horse used to be a worry
for many gymnasts, especially on
Yurchenko-style vaults — a round-oil
back handspring onto the equipment
performed by seven of the Cardinal
women — where the athlete cannot see
their target during takeoff.
"The new table is great for power ath
letes because they don't have to worry
about controlling their energy to hit a
smaller mark," women's assistant coach
Larissa Fontaine said. Fontaine should
know — she won the 1998 NCAA vault
ing championship, marking the Farm's
