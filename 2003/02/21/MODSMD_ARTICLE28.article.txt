### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With first-team All-American Curt Top
pel out of commission due to a strained ab
dominal muscle, the No. 9 Stanford men's
volleyball team (7-7, 5-5 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) has taken on a new look.

vs. UCLA, Saturday, 7 p.m.

While the impact has been major for
everyone, it may have hit sophomore David
Vogel the hardest, as he moves from his
usual spot at libero to outside hitter.
"A libero's job is to control the defensive
part of the game and the backcourt," Vogel
said. "It's a pretty difficult position because
you obviously can't attack, can't serve, so
you have to stay really focused while pass
ing and playing defense."
With the move to outside hitter, Vogel
takes on more responsibility by transform
ing into more of an attacker.
While the transition gives Vogel a
chance to display his offensive skills, it also
highlights which parts of his game need the
most improvement.
"I've got to work on my blocking right

now," Vogel said. "Especially left side
[blocking]. Left side is really important be
cause their best hitter will be hitting against
me, so I'm working on my hand positioning
and my timing."
Blocking improvements have become a
trend for the Cardinal as the team recorded
a season high in blocking in its last win over
UC-San Diego.
Because of the offensive responsibilities
associated with the position, the move to
outside hitter has tested Vogel's shot-mak
ing capabilities.
"[l've been] trying to work on different
shots, like a line shot or a deep angle shot,"
said Vogel. "But really, just being smart is
what I've got to work on and also what I'm
pretty good at. Being able to recognize and
see the other court and see what's going on
and see the block and being able to put
smart shots on the floor."
While Toppel remains out of the lineup,
the Cardinal will need to rely on its depth
this weekend when it takes on No. 3 UC-
Irvine (13-3,6-3 MPSF) and UCLA (7-7, 4-
6 MPSF).
"It's become more of a unified effort,"
Vogel said. "It's shifted not just me but our
