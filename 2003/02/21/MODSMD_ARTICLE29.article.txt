the Taube Family Tennis Center.

Women's Tennis
Thursday: No. 5 Stanford 7, Rice 0

The No. 5 Cardinal (4-1) looked sharp
in its first match after a two-week break
from competition. Freshman Amber Liu
led the charge at the top singles spot with
*a 6-1, 6-1 win over Blair DiSesa, while
Alice Barnes cruised to a 6-3, 6-0 victory
over an overmatched Jeri Gonzales at No.
4 singles. Liu and Barnes also teamed up
for an 8-3 defeat of Gonzales and Karen
Chao at No. 2 doubles.
Junior Lauren Barnikow and sopho
more Erin Burdette secured the doubles
point with an 8-2 win over Lauren Archer
and DiSesa. Barnikow then handed a loss
Archer, 6-0, 6-2 at No. 2 singles, while
Burdette's precise passing shots over
powered Chao's serve-and-volley game
with a 6-1, 6-1 victory at No. 3 singles.
Junior Emilia Anderson easily routed
Yasmin Fisher, 6-1, 6-0 at No. 5 singles,
while her doubles partner, sophomore
Story-Tweedie Yates, beat Erika Villalo
bos, 6-1, 6-1 at No. 6 singles. The two
completed a Cardinal doubles sweep of
the Owls with an 8-4 defeat of Fisher and
Villalobos.

The doubles sweep was integral be
cause Stanford lost the doubles point
when rival California defeated the Cardi
nal 4-3 in the Team Indoor Champi
onships.
But Rice offered more competition for
Stanford than the unequal scores dictat
ed. Most points were hard fought but
ended with winners from the Cardinal.
The win was important as the Cardinal
begins its conference season this Satur
day, with a rematch against No. 4 Califor
nia (4-1).
"It would be great to come out and win
convincingly [against Cal] to show them
and the nation that our last meeting was
not our best tennis," Barnikow said.

The loss to nemesis Cal was difficult
for the squad to take because the Bears
had not defeated the Cardinal since Feb
ruary 27, 1999. But a victory will not be
easy, as Cal boasts one of the top lineups
in the nation, headed by junior Raquel
Kops-Jones and senior Christina Fusano.
"Losing to them a few weeks ago didn't
leave a very good taste in any of our
mouths, and we have been waiting ever
since we stepped off the plane from Madi
son to get them here on our home courts
and show them how good we really can
be," Anderson said.
