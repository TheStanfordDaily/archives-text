# Res Ed queries alcohol use
## 
### VAUHINI VARA STAFF WRITER 
For the most part, this year's residential
education survey was similar to last
year's — except for one significant change.
This time, along with the usual questions on
staff performance and residential life, a
large portion of the survey was dedicated to
questions on alcohol-related issues.
The Office of Residential Education ad
ministers the annual survey to gauge stu
dent satisfaction with various aspects of res
idential education. Typically, questions
deal with relatively non-controversial topics
— for example, the importance of "intellec
tual vitality" in a dorm, the usefulness of
computer clusters and the approachability
of resident advisors.
But this year, many students were taken
aback by the 11 questions on alcohol use
and campus culture regarding alcohol,

such as "If you do drink, when did you
begin drinking alcohol socially?","What ef
fect does the use of alcohol have in your
house?" and "What would realistically keep
you from drinking excessively on a Friday
or Saturday night?"
Freshman Adrienne Clark expressed
skepticism about how much Res Ed can do
to change drinking habits.
"It's a part of student culture to drink,"
she said.
Clark felt uncomfortable with the word
ing of parts of the survey, including one
multiple-choice question that asked, "What
do you see as the biggest problem associat
ed with alcohol use in your house?" The an
swer choices included, "people getting
sick," "inappropriate sexual behavior" and
"violent behavior," among other options.
"It assumed that the consequences of al-
cohol use are all negative," she
said. "It assumed that people who
drink will do it out of control. 1
haven't seen that in my friends,
and they all drink."
This year, Clark's freshman
year, many students have per
ceived the University as being
more stringent in enforcing alco
hol policy than it has been in the
past. Three fraternities and the
Stanford Band were all on alcohol
probation. While addressing the
Faculty Senate earlier this month,
Director of Public Safety Laura
Wilson referred to Stanford's alco
hol problem as "appalling" and ex
pressed a commitment to dealing
with the problem through law en
forcement.

Junior Casey Goodman was
wary of Res Ed's goal in asking the
questions.
"I thought it was an invasion of
privacy," she said. "I was kind of
iffy about it."
But according to Josh Schiller,
assistant director of Residential
Education, the survey actually
resulted from student concerns
about excessive alcohol use and a
lack of alternatives to drinking
on weekends. Schiller said the al
cohol-related portion of the sur
vey simply aims to determine if
more students share those con
cerns.
Jane Camarillo, director of Res
idential Education, pointed out
that Res Ed already stresses alcohol
safety through staff training and
other means.
"We hope that this next oppor
tunity to get input from students
will help us to further understand

what students confront in their
lives in the residences," she said.
Junior Ami Shah recognized
the University's desire to learn
about students' drinking habits,
given the Stanford's relatively lax
alcohol policy.
"Stanford's approach is that
they're giving us responsibility for
our own alcohol use, so it makes
sense that they would try to gauge
drinking," she said. "It's the only
way for them to know."
Still, she questioned the sur
vey's effectiveness.
"I don't think they'll get accu
rate answers," she said. "People
aren't going to say, 'Oh, I drink
every night.'"
Indeed, several students said
that they did not answer the survey
questions truthfully— out of ap
prehension about possible reper
cussions, or because they saw the
questions as an invasion of privacy

or simply because it would take too
much time.
But Schiller felt that student
feedback could, in fact, give Res Ed
a clearer picture of the effect of al
cohol use in residences, as well as
the success of residential staff in ed
ucating students about alcohol use.
"Given (he student concerns
about a lack of alternatives to
drinking alcohol, Res Ed is also in
terested in hearing ideas generat
ed by students about what those al
ternatives could be," he said.
To that end, the survey asked
what could be done to keep stu
dents from drinking excessively on
weekends.
Clark's reaction to that question
was unequivocal. She didn't com
plete that part of the survey, but
she said later that she would like to
tell Res Ed not to make any more
changes. "You've done enough,"
she said. "Don't get worse."
