What do you get when you put two
undefeated teams, a 104-year-old rival

NCAA rules normally allow only 18 to
20 athletes on a team to travel to away
meets — the only exception is made for
main rivals in conference. This will allow

the complete Cardinal roster to travel
across the bay for this final dual meet of

With Pac-10 and NCAA champi
onships just weeks away, the Stanford
athletes recently began tapering their
training regimen in preparation for the
all-important postseason. Kenney has
been systematically reducing their prac
tice yardage, allowing the swimmers to
recuperate and rest for the champi
onship meets.
