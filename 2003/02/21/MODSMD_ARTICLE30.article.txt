What do you get when you put two
undefeated teams, a 104-year-old rival
ry, and the fastest swimmers in the coun
try together in one place?
A highly-anticipated dual meet.
The excitement begins tomorrow in
Berkeley, where the No. 1 Cardinal (7-0,
3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) will challenge
No. 3 California (5-0,3-0) for the distinc
tion of remaining the only undefeated
team in the conference. Although Stan-

ford leads the dual meet series against
the Golden Bears 91-13, head coach Skip
Kenney expects a fast meet with tough
competition.
"There are more top athletes in the
country on these two teams than on any
other combination," Kenney said.
NCAA rules normally allow only 18 to
20 athletes on a team to travel to away
meets — the only exception is made for
main rivals in conference. This will allow

the complete Cardinal roster to travel
across the bay for this final dual meet of
the season.
With Pac-10 and NCAA champi
onships just weeks away, the Stanford
athletes recently began tapering their
training regimen in preparation for the
all-important postseason. Kenney has
been systematically reducing their prac
tice yardage, allowing the swimmers to
recuperate and rest for the champi
onship meets.
For the duration of the season,
the swimmers will focus on resting
their bodies and increasing their
speed in the water.
"Speed comes from rest," Ken
ney said. "This is the reason that the
guys get up at six in the morning all
winter and jump in this cold pool
— so they can rest at the end of the
season. You work hard all year and
now it's time to rest hard."
Stanford's meet against Cal falls
during the taper most years, which
always increases the level of compe
tition.
"I am expecting some fast times
from these guys," Kenney said.

"They have some extra rest behind
them, and it is always exciting to
travel to someone else's backyard. 1
think that getting out of the com
fort of your home pool really raises
the level of competition."
The Golden Bears, led by 2002
Olympic gold medalist Anthony
Ervin and All-American Alex Lim,
should challenge the Cardinal in
the 400 free relay and the sprint
events. Cal's 400 free relay is cur
rently ranked No. 1 in the country,
and the team boasts a strong sprint
core in the 50 and 100 free as well
as the 100 back, 100 fly and 100
breast.
Erv in, Cal's top sprint freestyler,
was the runner-up in the 50 free at
the 2002 NCAA championships.
But Cardinal senior Randall Bal
has posted times this season in the

50 and 100 free faster than Frvin's
performances this year.
"Everyone really wants to win
this meet — it would be nice for
the seniors to finish up their dual
meet careers with a win," senior
Dan Westcott said. "We are all
shooting for season-best times and
several of us are looking for our
best unshaven times."
If history repeats itself, Stanford
should have no trouble overpower
ing its rivals — the Cardinal's last
lost to Cal occurred in 1991. No
matter what the outcome this week
end, however, the swimmers have
their sights set on bigger things.
"Our main focus heading into
this weekend is swimming well at
Cal, but we also have the Pac-10
and NCAA championships on our
minds," senior John Waters said.
