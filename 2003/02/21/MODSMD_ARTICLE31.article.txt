# No. 1 water polo takes on America's best
## 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Ii will be a homecoming of sorts
tomorrow at Avery Aquatic Center,
as three distinguished women's
water polo alums return to the site
of their past glory. But at 5:30 p.m.
the reunion will transform into the
sport's ultimate showdown when
the No. 1 Cardinal (5-0) hosts the
U.S. National Team.

Women's Water Polo
vs. US National Team, Saturday, 5:30
p.m.

This time last year, Margie Din
geldein, Ellen Estes and Kate Pettit
were gearing their Stanford team
up fora successful run at the na
tional championship game. To
morrow they will see the mighty
Cardinal as they have never before:
as an opponent. It will be the first
time that a college team has met the
national team in the regular season.
"It'll be a lot of fun to play against
our old teammates," senior captain
Nicole Huszcz said. "[They] are
outstanding players and it's great
that they're able to continue play
ing now that they're clone with
school. They were excellent role
models last year, so hopefully we'll
step up and use what they taught us
to give them a challenging game."
The graduated seniors and the
rest of the national team find them
selves in the unfamiliar role of un
derdogs, largely because of the ab
sence of their top goalie and goal
scorer. These two players will be in
the pool, but as representatives of
Stanford, not the United States.
Both goalie Jackie Frank and fel
low senior Brenda Villa served on
the national team in the offseason,
playing an integral part in forging
the squad's silver medal finish at the
2002 FINACup in Perth, Australia.
Frank led the team in saves while
Villa provided most of the offense

as the top scorer in the tournament
with nine goals.
Stanford will do all it can to ex
ploit the offensive and defensive
holes in the national team left by
Villa and Frank's absence.
While the Cardinal will face stiff
competition when the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation confer
ence season begins Feb. 28, it will be
heavily favored in every match this
season, and the national team may
be the only foe able to truly match
Stanford's talent. Thus the women
are excited to discover just how far
they have come in this young sea
son.
"Ever since we heard that we'd
have the opportunity to play such
high-caliber water polo against
water polo's best, we've been ex
tremely motivated and excited,"
sophomore Hannah Luber said.
Stanford coach John Tanner
may have to reign in the balanced
attack he has used against collegiate
opponents this season. The Cardi
nal's wealth of talent affords Fan
ner the opportunity to spread play
ing time widely, and 13 different
players have scored this season.
Villa leads with nine goals while
Luber has six, and these two will
lead the charge tomorrow.
Regardless of whether the grad
uates teach their former team
mates a lesson in experience or
Stanford's depth and energy pre
vail, the match will provide a
chance to watch what may be the
most competitive women's water
polo played in the nation this year.
The women hope that it establishes
a tradition of top-flight colleges
squaring off against international
opponents.
"I think these types of games will
be beneficial for both teams," Frank
said. "The national team gets to
have some more game experience
against some different players,
while Stanford gets to play against
one of the top teams in the world."
