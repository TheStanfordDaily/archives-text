# International spotlight
## Botswana 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is the eighth in a weekly series of inter
views with international students at Stanford meant to
heighten awareness of issues of social and political impor
tance around the world.
Thaala Montsi is a sophomore computer sci
ence major from Botswana, a country lo
cated in the center of southern Africa.
Botswana gained its independence from
Great Britain in 1966 and has since developed into
one of the most politically and economically stable
countries on the continent. While it is the largest ex
porter of gemstone diamonds in the world and is
home to numerous game parks and a rich diversity of
wildlife, Botswana also has one of the highest rates of
HIV infection in the world. Since coming to Stanford,
Monsti has gotten involved with the AIDS Treatment
Access Initiative and organized walk-a-thons to fund
AIDS prevention and treatment centers in Africa.
The Daily interviewed Montsi about the current
state of her country and how it has been affected by
the AIDS epidemic.
The Daily: Could you give a brief overview of your
country?
Thaala Montsi: Unlike most of our neighboring
countries, we have a stable political climate [and] a
very fast-growing economy. In fact, we've got the
strongest currency in Africa, which makes us very at
tractive to a number of investors and researchers.
People are pouring in there right now because there
is a great deal of opportunity, because it's kind of the
island of hope among all the other African countries.
Unfortunately, despite all this good fortune, we are
basically the center of the global AIDS pandemic. Sta
tistics say that about 33 percent of our population is
HIV positive, which hits home because the rhetoric
and the reality are heavily present and are looming
over what should be a very hopeful situation.
Especially looking just above us in Zimbabwe at
the terrible things that are happening there with Mu
gabe and the land reallocation and what-have-you,
one would think that we would be really progressing
far and fast. But the struggles that we're facing in the
context of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa really mean
that, although we've taken many steps forward, it
brings us many steps back.
I went home for the first time after one and a half
years this past Christmas, and it was a bittersweet ex
perience because, when you think of all the people
who you say goodbye to before you leave ... when
you arrive you must see everybody and greet them,
and when you leave you must go to everybody and
get their blessing. And many of the people who I had
last seen one and a half years ago when I left are
dead, and it's really directly related to the discourse

of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. We are literally
dying — our country is dying.
It's such a beautiful place. I miss that so much, es
pecially living in these urban situations here. We
have a very interesting mix of cultures and technolo
gies and urban and rural coexisting side-by-side . ..
It's the small things that I had really forgotten about
that I found so endearing going back, because there
are so many pieces of our indigenous culture that are
still preserved, unlike many of our neighboring
countries that are under cultural imperialism.
TD: Is urban or organized violence relatively rare, then?
TM: I wouldn't say rare. Recently the crime rate is
coming up. I don't know the official reasons why, but
the talk is that, especially with the situation in Zim
babwe, we're getting a lot of illegal immigrants pour
ing in from Zimbabwe, Zambia and neighboring re-

gions, which causes a lot of problems for us. Cur
rently, the way the government is dealing with it is
deporting these people in huge trucks.
Another reason, again related to AIDS — because
most, if not all, of our social problems have some con
nection to AIDS — is because AIDS, being a disease
spread by people, is increased gready by migrant
populations. These illegal immigrants come in on
temporary passes of several weeks, and they're mov
ing up and down in between [Zimbabwe and
Botswana], which leads to all sorts of high-risk behav
ior because of the kinds of jobs they're involved [with]
in our homes. Generally, the women are domestic
workers and many of the men are all involved in the
informal sector. Many of the immigrants are involved
in some sort of sex work, whether fully commercially,
or to survive in a relationship in which one partner
provides sex in exchange for essential resources . . .
And back to violent crime, one of the saddest ones
is that right now, because the situation is pretty dire
with 33 percent of our population being HIV posi
tive, there's a huge rally encouraging people to test.
Everywhere on the radio you'll hear about AIDS —
on the TV, on the posters, in the newspapers. Every
where there's this constant bombardment of "test
now, stay safe" or what-have-you — but there's still
an incredible stigma.
The crimes that I've witnessed affecting people
greatly at home are crimes related to — say, a guy

tests and finds himself HIV positive. It's not that un
common that he should kill himself, kill his wife, kill
his baby. And that's the end of that. In fact, my moth
er attended two funerals last week with that same
theme. It's really unfortunate that — as far as violent
crimes, there aren't all that many — but that domes
tic crime is not that common. Again related to the
AIDS situation, because there aren't very many ef
fective medical interventions and little to no access to
anti-retroviral drugs and what-have-you. It leaves
you with a very hopeless situation if you're a PWA (a
person living with AIDS).
And this again relates to why it's so important
being in a place where there are the resources to
make a difference, to engage with whatever oppor
tunity is available to do so. If you ask any young per
son in school, they're involved in some kind of AIDS
activity. They have this group called PACT [Peer Ap
proach to Counseling by Teens] which has a chapter

in almost every high school and junior high school
across the country . . . It's a day-to-day reality for us.
You can't talk about Botswana and life and being a
young person without the context of AIDS.
TD: Do you think the younger generations are get
ting the message about taking preventive measures
against AIDS?
TM: Here's the jingle: "A-B-C: Abstain, Be Faithful,
Condomize." Now the rhetoric is great, and every
body knows the information — live-year olds will
sing along to the song. But unfortunately, practical
ly, the process of changing behavior through things
like that is very difficult. But I think it is slowly and
surely getting through. They have a lot of centers
coming up right now with free testing, with the
newest technologies, where you can get the test re
sults in several hours, unlike the previous several
months. Some of them are funded by the Gates foun
dation — they have fantastic programs there. So
again, like I'm saying, everyone you speak to will
know something about the disease.
But there's still this incredible stigma . . . Giving
the voice of youth power as far as deciding what leg
islation does by way of helping us, helping us engage
in our challenges. Botswanan youth are very vocal.
The university is known for its strikes . . . But unfor
tunately it's hard to be heard because they don't

often have these youth representation opportunities
in the places where it matters. So you find a lot of peo
ple with a lot to say but no opportunity to say it.
TD: Could you talk some more about the activities
that you're involved with here related to AIDS?
TM: Last quarter, 1 came across this group called
AIDS Treatment Access Initiative .. . [part of] The
Call to Action project [which] has over 250 sites in 17
different countries in the developing world, many of
which are in Africa, many of which I've lived [in], like
South Africa, Zimbabwe and the like. And all the
money that's raised from these walk-a-thons will go
directly to these centers, not just for treatment, but
also for family health and other kinds of intervention.
This, to me, is such a light of hope because looking
at home and look at the kinds of intervention in our
highly resource-limited situations, there's very little
you can do effectively. So this program allows me
here, remote from my home, to be able to have a pos
itive effect that could save a life . . .
The initiative is two-fold: basically to raise funds
for the treatment, but also an educational cam
paign about the global pandemic, which is very
close to my heart, because my own country is real
ly the epicenter. Statistically, we're the worst-hit
country as far as the AIDS pandemic goes ... I left
home feeling so hopeless. I got here, and a profes
sor in African Studies asked me, "Do you think
there's hope for Africa?" Realistically, I wanted to
say no, because the money isn't there to provide the
treatment or to sustain other medical and social in
terventions and prevention measures . . . There
are just so many incredible challenges that we're
fighting with alongside the AIDS pandemic, like
poverty, like education, primary health care — just
day-to-day life is a challenge.
And when the professor asked me, I wanted to say
"no," because so often you feel so hopeless. Hut then
you go home and you see people laughing, people
are still having fancy wedding celebrations and
slaughtering a cow and taking the whole day to bleed
it and chopping it up according to our rituals, and
singing and dancing and the vibrancy and the life . . .
There really is hope ... So when we're talking
about fighting AIDS, we're really not fighting against
something, we're fighting for life ... I flew halfway
across the world because this is one of the top institu
tions globally. My scholarship from my government
gave me the latitude to decide where and what I
wanted to study, and I chose Stanford because this a
fantastic [university] of incredible resources and in
credible opportunity. And this is what I'm coming to
get for my country: hope.

far and fast. But the struggles that we're facing in the
context of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa really mean
that, although we've taken many steps forward, it
brings us many steps back.
I went home for the first time after one and a half
years this past Christmas, and it was a bittersweet ex
perience because, when you think of all the people
who you say goodbye to before you leave ... when
you arrive you must see everybody and greet them,
and when you leave you must go to everybody and
get their blessing. And many of the people who I had
last seen one and a half years ago when I left are
dead, and it's really directly related to the discourse

of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. We are literally
dying — our country is dying.
It's such a beautiful place. I miss that so much, es
pecially living in these urban situations here. We
have a very interesting mix of cultures and technolo
gies and urban and rural coexisting side-by-side . ..
It's the small things that I had really forgotten about
that I found so endearing going back, because there
are so many pieces of our indigenous culture that are
still preserved, unlike many of our neighboring
countries that are under cultural imperialism.
TD: Is urban or organized violence relatively rare, then?
TM: I wouldn't say rare. Recently the crime rate is
coming up. I don't know the official reasons why, but
the talk is that, especially with the situation in Zim
babwe, we're getting a lot of illegal immigrants pour
ing in from Zimbabwe, Zambia and neighboring re-

gions, which causes a lot of problems for us. Cur
rently, the way the government is dealing with it is
deporting these people in huge trucks.
Another reason, again related to AIDS — because
most, if not all, of our social problems have some con
nection to AIDS — is because AIDS, being a disease
spread by people, is increased gready by migrant
populations. These illegal immigrants come in on
temporary passes of several weeks, and they're mov
ing up and down in between [Zimbabwe and
Botswana], which leads to all sorts of high-risk behav
ior because of the kinds of jobs they're involved [with]
in our homes. Generally, the women are domestic
workers and many of the men are all involved in the
informal sector. Many of the immigrants are involved
in some sort of sex work, whether fully commercially,
or to survive in a relationship in which one partner
provides sex in exchange for essential resources . . .
And back to violent crime, one of the saddest ones
is that right now, because the situation is pretty dire
with 33 percent of our population being HIV posi
tive, there's a huge rally encouraging people to test.
Everywhere on the radio you'll hear about AIDS —
on the TV, on the posters, in the newspapers. Every
where there's this constant bombardment of "test
now, stay safe" or what-have-you — but there's still
an incredible stigma.
The crimes that I've witnessed affecting people
greatly at home are crimes related to — say, a guy

tests and finds himself HIV positive. It's not that un
common that he should kill himself, kill his wife, kill
his baby. And that's the end of that. In fact, my moth
er attended two funerals last week with that same
theme. It's really unfortunate that — as far as violent
crimes, there aren't all that many — but that domes
tic crime is not that common. Again related to the
AIDS situation, because there aren't very many ef
fective medical interventions and little to no access to
anti-retroviral drugs and what-have-you. It leaves
you with a very hopeless situation if you're a PWA (a
person living with AIDS).
And this again relates to why it's so important
being in a place where there are the resources to
make a difference, to engage with whatever oppor
tunity is available to do so. If you ask any young per
son in school, they're involved in some kind of AIDS
activity. They have this group called PACT [Peer Ap
proach to Counseling by Teens] which has a chapter

in almost every high school and junior high school
across the country . . . It's a day-to-day reality for us.
You can't talk about Botswana and life and being a
young person without the context of AIDS.
TD: Do you think the younger generations are get
ting the message about taking preventive measures
against AIDS?
TM: Here's the jingle: "A-B-C: Abstain, Be Faithful,
Condomize." Now the rhetoric is great, and every
body knows the information — live-year olds will
sing along to the song. But unfortunately, practical
ly, the process of changing behavior through things
like that is very difficult. But I think it is slowly and
surely getting through. They have a lot of centers
coming up right now with free testing, with the
newest technologies, where you can get the test re
sults in several hours, unlike the previous several
months. Some of them are funded by the Gates foun
dation — they have fantastic programs there. So
again, like I'm saying, everyone you speak to will
know something about the disease.
But there's still this incredible stigma . . . Giving
the voice of youth power as far as deciding what leg
islation does by way of helping us, helping us engage
in our challenges. Botswanan youth are very vocal.
The university is known for its strikes . . . But unfor
tunately it's hard to be heard because they don't

often have these youth representation opportunities
in the places where it matters. So you find a lot of peo
ple with a lot to say but no opportunity to say it.
TD: Could you talk some more about the activities
that you're involved with here related to AIDS?
TM: Last quarter, 1 came across this group called
AIDS Treatment Access Initiative .. . [part of] The
Call to Action project [which] has over 250 sites in 17
different countries in the developing world, many of
which are in Africa, many of which I've lived [in], like
South Africa, Zimbabwe and the like. And all the
money that's raised from these walk-a-thons will go
directly to these centers, not just for treatment, but
also for family health and other kinds of intervention.
This, to me, is such a light of hope because looking
at home and look at the kinds of intervention in our
highly resource-limited situations, there's very little
you can do effectively. So this program allows me
here, remote from my home, to be able to have a pos
itive effect that could save a life . . .
The initiative is two-fold: basically to raise funds
for the treatment, but also an educational cam
paign about the global pandemic, which is very
close to my heart, because my own country is real
ly the epicenter. Statistically, we're the worst-hit
country as far as the AIDS pandemic goes ... I left
home feeling so hopeless. I got here, and a profes
sor in African Studies asked me, "Do you think
there's hope for Africa?" Realistically, I wanted to
say no, because the money isn't there to provide the
treatment or to sustain other medical and social in
terventions and prevention measures . . . There
are just so many incredible challenges that we're
fighting with alongside the AIDS pandemic, like
poverty, like education, primary health care — just
day-to-day life is a challenge.
And when the professor asked me, I wanted to say
"no," because so often you feel so hopeless. Hut then
you go home and you see people laughing, people
are still having fancy wedding celebrations and
slaughtering a cow and taking the whole day to bleed
it and chopping it up according to our rituals, and
singing and dancing and the vibrancy and the life . . .
There really is hope ... So when we're talking
about fighting AIDS, we're really not fighting against
something, we're fighting for life ... I flew halfway
across the world because this is one of the top institu
tions globally. My scholarship from my government
gave me the latitude to decide where and what I
wanted to study, and I chose Stanford because this a
fantastic [university] of incredible resources and in
credible opportunity. And this is what I'm coming to
get for my country: hope.

Editor's Note: This is the eighth in a weekly series of inter
views with international students at Stanford meant to
heighten awareness of issues of social and political impor
tance around the world.
Thaala Montsi is a sophomore computer sci
ence major from Botswana, a country lo
cated in the center of southern Africa.
Botswana gained its independence from
Great Britain in 1966 and has since developed into
one of the most politically and economically stable
countries on the continent. While it is the largest ex
porter of gemstone diamonds in the world and is
home to numerous game parks and a rich diversity of
wildlife, Botswana also has one of the highest rates of
HIV infection in the world. Since coming to Stanford,
Monsti has gotten involved with the AIDS Treatment
Access Initiative and organized walk-a-thons to fund
AIDS prevention and treatment centers in Africa.
The Daily interviewed Montsi about the current
state of her country and how it has been affected by
the AIDS epidemic.
The Daily: Could you give a brief overview of your
country?
Thaala Montsi: Unlike most of our neighboring
countries, we have a stable political climate [and] a
very fast-growing economy. In fact, we've got the
strongest currency in Africa, which makes us very at
tractive to a number of investors and researchers.
People are pouring in there right now because there
is a great deal of opportunity, because it's kind of the
island of hope among all the other African countries.
Unfortunately, despite all this good fortune, we are
basically the center of the global AIDS pandemic. Sta
tistics say that about 33 percent of our population is
HIV positive, which hits home because the rhetoric
and the reality are heavily present and are looming
over what should be a very hopeful situation.
Especially looking just above us in Zimbabwe at
the terrible things that are happening there with Mu
gabe and the land reallocation and what-have-you,
one would think that we would be really progressing
far and fast. But the struggles that we're facing in the
context of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa really mean

spread by people, is increased gready by migrant
populations. These illegal immigrants come in on
temporary passes of several weeks, and they're mov
ing up and down in between [Zimbabwe and
Botswana], which leads to all sorts of high-risk behav
ior because of the kinds of jobs they're involved [with]
in our homes. Generally, the women are domestic
workers and many of the men are all involved in the
informal sector. Many of the immigrants are involved
in some sort of sex work, whether fully commercially,
or to survive in a relationship in which one partner
provides sex in exchange for essential resources . . .
And back to violent crime, one of the saddest ones
is that right now, because the situation is pretty dire
with 33 percent of our population being HIV posi
tive, there's a huge rally encouraging people to test.
Everywhere on the radio you'll hear about AIDS —
on the TV, on the posters, in the newspapers. Every
where there's this constant bombardment of "test
now, stay safe" or what-have-you — but there's still
an incredible stigma.
The crimes that I've witnessed affecting people
greatly at home are crimes related to — say, a guy

tests and finds himself HIV positive. It's not that un
common that he should kill himself, kill his wife, kill
his baby. And that's the end of that. In fact, my moth
er attended two funerals last week with that same
theme. It's really unfortunate that — as far as violent
crimes, there aren't all that many — but that domes
tic crime is not that common. Again related to the
AIDS situation, because there aren't very many ef
fective medical interventions and little to no access to
anti-retroviral drugs and what-have-you. It leaves
you with a very hopeless situation if you're a PWA (a
person living with AIDS).
And this again relates to why it's so important
being in a place where there are the resources to
make a difference, to engage with whatever oppor
tunity is available to do so. If you ask any young per
son in school, they're involved in some kind of AIDS
activity. They have this group called PACT [Peer Ap
proach to Counseling by Teens] which has a chapter

in almost every high school and junior high school
across the country . . . It's a day-to-day reality for us.
You can't talk about Botswana and life and being a
young person without the context of AIDS.
TD: Do you think the younger generations are get
ting the message about taking preventive measures
against AIDS?
TM: Here's the jingle: "A-B-C: Abstain, Be Faithful,
Condomize." Now the rhetoric is great, and every
body knows the information — live-year olds will
sing along to the song. But unfortunately, practical
ly, the process of changing behavior through things
like that is very difficult. But I think it is slowly and
surely getting through. They have a lot of centers
coming up right now with free testing, with the
newest technologies, where you can get the test re
sults in several hours, unlike the previous several
months. Some of them are funded by the Gates foun
dation — they have fantastic programs there. So
again, like I'm saying, everyone you speak to will
know something about the disease.
But there's still this incredible stigma . . . Giving
the voice of youth power as far as deciding what leg
islation does by way of helping us, helping us engage
in our challenges. Botswanan youth are very vocal.
The university is known for its strikes . . . But unfor
tunately it's hard to be heard because they don't

often have these youth representation opportunities
in the places where it matters. So you find a lot of peo
ple with a lot to say but no opportunity to say it.
TD: Could you talk some more about the activities
that you're involved with here related to AIDS?
TM: Last quarter, 1 came across this group called
AIDS Treatment Access Initiative .. . [part of] The
Call to Action project [which] has over 250 sites in 17
different countries in the developing world, many of
which are in Africa, many of which I've lived [in], like
South Africa, Zimbabwe and the like. And all the
money that's raised from these walk-a-thons will go
directly to these centers, not just for treatment, but
also for family health and other kinds of intervention.
This, to me, is such a light of hope because looking
at home and look at the kinds of intervention in our
highly resource-limited situations, there's very little
you can do effectively. So this program allows me
here, remote from my home, to be able to have a pos
itive effect that could save a life . . .
The initiative is two-fold: basically to raise funds
for the treatment, but also an educational cam
paign about the global pandemic, which is very
close to my heart, because my own country is real
ly the epicenter. Statistically, we're the worst-hit
country as far as the AIDS pandemic goes ... I left
home feeling so hopeless. I got here, and a profes
sor in African Studies asked me, "Do you think
there's hope for Africa?" Realistically, I wanted to
say no, because the money isn't there to provide the
treatment or to sustain other medical and social in
terventions and prevention measures . . . There
are just so many incredible challenges that we're
fighting with alongside the AIDS pandemic, like
poverty, like education, primary health care — just
day-to-day life is a challenge.
And when the professor asked me, I wanted to say
"no," because so often you feel so hopeless. Hut then
you go home and you see people laughing, people
are still having fancy wedding celebrations and
slaughtering a cow and taking the whole day to bleed
it and chopping it up according to our rituals, and
singing and dancing and the vibrancy and the life . . .
There really is hope ... So when we're talking
about fighting AIDS, we're really not fighting against
something, we're fighting for life ... I flew halfway
across the world because this is one of the top institu
tions globally. My scholarship from my government
gave me the latitude to decide where and what I
wanted to study, and I chose Stanford because this a
fantastic [university] of incredible resources and in
credible opportunity. And this is what I'm coming to
get for my country: hope.
