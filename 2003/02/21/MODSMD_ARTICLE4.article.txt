# Civics explored with OSU
## Undergrads take part in a high-tech political conference at Wallenberg Hall 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
Yesterday afternoon, eight undergradu
ates discussed civic engagement during a
high-tech video conference with students
from Oklahoma State University. Totaling
about 20 students, the conference partici
pants explored issues of political and com
munity involvement in American youth.
The participants were excited by the
chance to access the technology in Wallen
berg Hall, which they were able to use for
free. Use of a video conference room nor
mally costs $400 an hour.
Summer Stowe, a Raise Your Voice rep
resentative from OSU, moderated the dis
cussion. She began by asking the students
what they thought when they heard the

word "politics." This led to a discussion of
whether students felt the "political process
worked for them."
An OSU student said the political
process was not close enough to home and
that politicians often looked out only for
their own interests.
"A lot of politicians don't seem to care
about anything but money," said Stanford
senior Melanie Curtin.
"The people who get to the top had to do
something to get there," said Stanford
sophomore Marina Kim.
Many of the Stanford students described
the "Stanford bubble" and the sense of iso
lation they feel.
"I feel like 1 got distanced from politics
and the world in general," said Stanford
freshman Jon Sanders of coming to college.
"Voting didn't press as hard."
Junior Stephen Chan, working with
the Haas Center for Public Service and
the Raise Your Voice campaign, ques-
tioned whether the reason for
such low student participation in
politics — only 28 percent of 18-
to 24-year olds voted in the last
election, according to a recent
survey cited by Stowe — was due
to apathy or lack of availability.
Most students thought that there
were many opportunities to vote
at Stanford.
"The voting booths are right on
campus," said sociology cotermi
nal student Jenny Wu. "It doesn't
get any closer than that."
The two groups talked about
ways of increasing student involve
ment in politics, focusing on stu
dents who already actively volun
teer in the community and how to
increase those students' interest in
more political activities. In the
end, they came back to reaching
out to the average college student.
"You see the same people for

causes each time," said senior Jeb
Ory. "[We need] to try to move out
and get more people involved."
Several OSU students empha
sized that college should be about
more than getting a degree or par
tying.
"I see a lot of people in the
dorm chilling out fora couple
years," one student said. "People
are willing to listen to [college stu
dents.] It's a big waste of time to sit
and watch reality television all day
long."
Still, freshman JF Schnapper-
Casteras was concerned about
pushing politics too hard.
"You run the risk of alienating
people," he said.
They concluded that outreach
needs to move beyond a core
group of people and into the com
munity, if only by starting conver
sations with friends.
Schnapper-Casteras thought
the video conference was a begin
ning and wanted to continue the
conversation.
"It was great to talk to a differ

ent part of the country, to know
how much we had in common," he
said. "II we had more of these, we
could really start something."
Chan found the event reward
ing but difficult to coordinate

around students' busy class
schedules.
"It's hard with midterms this
week," Chan said. "I told people
they needed to have the entire
hour and a half block free."
