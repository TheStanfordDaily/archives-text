# Russell makes dark blue mess
## POLICE ACADEMY 
### ERICK FLORES 
Every now and then come those movies that leave
their mark on American cinema. They break new
ground and raise the bar for all future directors, actors,
writers and music composers. They are the masterpieces
that remind us why we keep paying 10 bucks for admis
sion and die films that will eventually take their place in
our DVD collections.
And then there are die movies dial suck on every level
possible. You curse die filmmakers as criminals and remind
yourself of that new (11) you've been wanting diat must now
be put on hold because you've just been set back 10 bucks.
Some of these p<x>r excuses for ait might at least be laugh
ably horrible. But then there are those like "Dark Blue" that
are so awful, you get past the comedy all too quickly and are
left to cringe and squirm until the end credits start rolling
(unless you're not an Intermission reviewer, in which case,
SAVE YOURSELF AND WALK OUT EARLY!).
In this pile of crap from Ron Shelton ("Tin Cup" and
"Bull Durham"), Kurt Russell plays die non-descript and
forgettable cop Eldon Perry in the midst of the Rodney
King verdict and sulisequent I jOs Angeles ric >ts <>112 1992. The
big twist and shock — gasp — is diat cops can be crooked
and use their power for evildoing, like murder and drug
trafficking (breathe a sigh of relief; at least they're not giving
out speeding tickets).
Perry gets caught up in the corruption of his daily job,
unable to reconcile die allegiance he owes his dead father's
shady partner and the duties he should uphold as a public
servant An archetype for the typical mid-life crisis, he is an

all-around failure on the
verge of a breakdown; he's
an alcoholic, an absent fa
ther, and a husband en
route to becoming an ex.
What "Dark Blue" tries to

Dark Blue
Dir. Ron Shelton

depict is a story of redemption, in which Perry looks to find
meaning in at least salvaging his dignity as a cop.
This has all been done before at the movies and much
lx.'tter for that matter. When any soil of genre movie Ls
made — the heist flick, the mafia movie, the teen film — it's
necessary t< > pr< wide ar 1 interesting spin < >n the c >rdinary for
mula in order to separate yourself from what's common.
Last year's 'Training Day"was by no means an excellent ex
ample of 61m noir, but this cops-gone-bad story had its shit
together: a passable script, good direction and better acting.
With "Dark Blue," you just wish the movie could have
gone straight to TNT or Lifetime, not only to save you the
ticket or the rental but also to give you the liberty to change
the channel at will. The action and violence are pitiful and
overwhelmingly gratuitous. "Shit" and "fuck" are the best
exchange of dialogue the writers could come up with to
create cop credibility. Even t he trumpet music that tries to
be "The Godfather" ends up sounding more like the score
fora soft-core porn flick.
Like his character seeking validation, Russell is desper
ately trying tojumpstart a waning acting career. This film is
definitely a step in the wrong creative direction for all who
had a hand in making it. By its end, you'll consider Russell's
pairing with girlfriend Goldie Hawn in the '80s "Over
lx)ard" to lx* Oscar-quality.
