# Keep this man out of the family

My boyfriend thinks "wife" is the ugliest word in the
English language. That's because it sounds like "wipe,"

as in "wipe your ass," which is one thing
you could do with Tony Parsons' new
novel, "Man and Wife."
Parsons' hero is Harry Silver, a
young, divorced Londoner trying to be
a good father to his son Pat while build-

Tony Parsons
Man and Wife

ing a new family with his bride Cyd and
her daughter Peggy. Being a divorced dad is hard,
being a stepdad is harder and to top it off, Harry's ex
wife Gina wants to take Pat with her to America.
Harry's troubles force him to mature as a husband, a
father and a man, while discovering what is really im
portant to him.
Sounds like Oprah's Book Club fodder, but Tony
Parsons is no softie. He's a former rock journalist who
covered the likes of The Clash and The Sex Pistols. To
live up to these credentials he injects "Man and Wife"
with some hipness, in the form of a coke-addicted
buddy for Harry and lots of adultery for everyone.
The blend of nice and naughty works about as well
as sticking a pair of Oakleys on Mr. Rogers.
We get Harry waxing poetic about marriage one
minute and shamelessly chasing ass the next. Parsons
tries to splice Harry's two sides together by claiming
that he really just wants what's best for his son. He only

goes after the hot young Kazumi, we are
supposed to believe, because she takes such
beautiful, sensitive photographs of Pat.
Of course, Harry's lust for Kazumi isn't

the only tiling standing in
the way of his familial bliss.
There's also his mother's
recent diagnosis with
breast cancer, the smarmy
coworker who keeps hit

ting on Cyd and his coke
fiend friend's explosive nosebleeds.
Maybe these circumstances are supposed
to make us sympathize with Harry, to blame
him a little less for the fact that his marriage
goes south almost the minute he leaves the
church. Or maybe we're supposed to pity
him as a confused guy searching for old
fashioned family values in a mixed-up
world. But we don't.
The playboy with a heart of gold can be
endearing and believable — Nick Hornby

did it well in "About a Boy." But Harry just seems like
an amalgam of corny earnestness — "Does every man
feel that his bride is the most beautiful girl in the
world?" — and gutless irresponsibility — "She had a
way of making me forget things. Like i he fact that I was
married." Not someone I'd want to spend 340 pages
with, much less a lifetime.

Parsons does his best writing in scenes like that of
a little French girl declaring her vegetarianism at
McDonald's — scenes untainted by platitudes
about marriage and commitment or by Harry's
lame soul-searching. Get rid of man, get rid of wife,
and Parsons might have a pretty sweet little novella
called "And."



"Help! He's holding
me hostage under this
umbrella!"
