# "Slaughter" slays all preconceptions
## 
### JESSICA JOFFE 
For those of you who may not he fa
miliar with the intricacies of a sport I
like to call American football, the
'slaughter rule' (reserved for amateur
competition) decrees that a game be
called when one team gets ahead of
the other by 45 points. Only applica
ble in the second half, it is designed to
end games in which there is no longer
any real competition —to prevent
teams from "running up the score"
and demoralizing their opponents.
The term is uttered only once dur
ing the course of "The Slaughter
Rule," which was released on DVD
Feb. 18. Its significance lies off the
field rather than on. Grace is a neces-

sary component of any relationship, but it is in conspic
uous absence among the film's subjects (as in our own,
no doubt). Only as things are really falling apart do the
characters eventually learn and move out beyond the
world of routine in which they have literally been
frozen.
The story's reluctant hero, Roy (suffused with a tacit
self-possession by the angelic Ryan Gosling), has been
ousted from the school's football team for not being
angry enough. He is a talented player, but he does not
know passion. He has grown up without an under
standing of intimacy, and although he is forthright and
gentle, he has not quite learned to trust himself or oth
ers enough to be truly honest. Select shots of the beauti
fully unforgiving landscape remind us that this is a trait
of his environment: It is designed to alienate, not pro
tect. Even in summer, it seems as though a thin crust of
ice covers the grass: The film suggests that football, with
the heated violence of its physical interactions, is the
only way to come up against it.
Along comes Gideon, the local odd-bod (played
gruffly but with unnecessary gravity by David Morse)
determined to become Roy's ersatz-father / mother /
coach. He likes the word trust, but enjoys hitting other
people over the head with it even more; in actuality, he
understands the word's meaning no better than those
he attempts to instruct. For Gideon, the mother-hen
without a brood, the fatherless child, Roy, poses as the
perfect project. Naturally, Roy will have none of it. He
wants to make his own decisions — not limited to his
consumption of beer and sex — but he gets pulled
along somehow and the resultingjourney, leaving bod
ies and cracked hearts in its wake, only narrowly escapes
real tragedy before either of them can learn what got
them there in the first place.
"The Slaughter Rule" is a brave film — resolutely
un-hip in its refusal to seek recourse in the cynicism and
self-ironic wit that has characterized the latest crop of
coming-of-age flicks, usually featuring handsome
young men who are genuinely thrown oft by the fact
that adulthood comes without a handbook. (Oddly,
these films seldom feature youftg women, whose grace
ful transition into adulthood — and everything else for
that matter — is universally accepted and admired.)
But then "The Slaughter Rule" isn't simply a coming
of-age flick, although its protagonist is a high school
student trying to get his head around your regular as
sortment of adolescent dilemmas. Nor is it a football
movie, although most of its scenes are set on a football
field or in a locker room. Neither is it a gay film, al
though its emphasis on the ambiguous homoeroticism
of its male relationships is pretty clear.
"The Slaughter Rule'"s appeal lies in the fact that it is
all of these things and much more — that it doesn't
kowtow to an audience by providing it with a proscrip
tive category within which it fits, nor does it take advan

"They want to know what
the poster Is on the bus
passing by. The photo and
the sentence. If they don't
have that, then they don't
know what to do with the
film."

"[Malick] is very intelli
gent, very gentle and very
aware. He is also slightly
distracted by the world and
can easily digress into the
plant or bird life around
you: Whatever happens to
be in the surroundings."

of white bread — easily digestible and
minimally sustaining. The film's re
flective camera demands of the audi
ence a thoughtful patience as it takes
time to move between its subjects and
the Montana landscape, allowing fora
natural development of character and
story largely unseen since the charac
ter-driven pictures of the '70s.
Recently "The Slaughter
Rule'"s writer/director twins Andrew

and Alex Smith took some time to
speak with Intermission. A veritable candy-store of dou
ble MA.sand M.F.As (still a rarity amongst their con
temporaries), their original footsteps in the film indus
try were of the writing sort. They independently sat
down to write "The Slaughter Rule" in response to a
similar situation that occurred during their own child
hood. But the film has taken a somewhat less-than-glo
rious decade to go from paper to celluloid, where it has
only been scheduled to remain fora few weeks before its
DVD release. Highlights of the process included the di
rector jumping ship (thankfully forcing the Smiths into
the role themselves), constant conflicting interests on
behalf of their producers, taking the film to favorable re
ceptions at more than 30 festivals in the last year and still
failing to garner enough faith to keep it on screens for
more than a few scant weeks.
The problem, as Andrew says, lies in the fact that a
film which cannot be readily categorized has no market
value.
"They want to know what the poster is on the bus
passing by," he said. "The photo and the sentence. If
they don't have that, then they don't know what to do
with the film."
Advertising plays a central role, if not the central role
in filmmaking — if your distribution company doesn't
have the money to advertise, your film will come and go
unnoticed. "We wanted to make a strong film, not a
'type' film. But the studios and the public won't take it
on that level: They always want a specific angle. We
wanted the proof of its quality to be in the film itself."
As far as many critics are concerned, the proof is
there. While the Smiths' concerns and frustrations are
an intrinsic element of the industry and will likely
never change, their work has elicited enough positive
response for both to be busy working on a number of
other projects. Two of these are stories again influ
enced by real events and people. A very important fig
ure in the life of Alex Smith has been Terrence Malick
(director of "Badlands," "Days of Heaven" and "Thin
Red Line") who became his mentor while he was study
ing at the University of Texas at Austin. Alex describes
their relationship as having been enormously educa
tional.
"He is very intelligent, very gentle and very aware.
He is also slightly distracted by the world and can easily
digress into the plant or bird life around you: Whatever
happens to be in the surroundings."
These distractions are of course what make Malick's
work so inimitable. Alex wrote a screenplay for Malick in
1995, but asked whether his mentor has seen "The
Slaughter Rule," with its distinctly Malick-like qualities,
he was unsure.
Here's hoping that "The Slaughter Rule" signals the
advent of a new breed of thoughtful, complex and hon
est films, and Malick would be wise to get his hands on a
copy soon.


Ah, football. The perfect metaphor for life.

only way to come up against it.
Along comes Gideon, the local odd-bod (played
gruffly but with unnecessary gravity by David Morse)
determined to become Roy's ersatz-father / mother /
coach. He likes the word trust, but enjoys hitting other
people over the head with it even more; in actuality, he
understands the word's meaning no better than those
he attempts to instruct. For Gideon, the mother-hen
without a brood, the fatherless child, Roy, poses as the
perfect project. Naturally, Roy will have none of it. He
wants to make his own decisions — not limited to his
consumption of beer and sex — but he gets pulled

"The Slaughter Rule" is a brave film — resolutely
un-hip in its refusal to seek recourse in the cynicism and
self-ironic wit that has characterized the latest crop of
coming-of-age flicks, usually featuring handsome
young men who are genuinely thrown oft by the fact
that adulthood comes without a handbook. (Oddly,
these films seldom feature youftg women, whose grace
ful transition into adulthood — and everything else for
that matter — is universally accepted and admired.)
But then "The Slaughter Rule" isn't simply a coming
of-age flick, although its protagonist is a high school
student trying to get his head around your regular as
sortment of adolescent dilemmas. Nor is it a football
movie, although most of its scenes are set on a football
field or in a locker room. Neither is it a gay film, al
though its emphasis on the ambiguous homoeroticism
of its male relationships is pretty clear.
"The Slaughter Rule'"s appeal lies in the fact that it is
all of these things and much more — that it doesn't
kowtow to an audience by providing it with a proscrip

of white bread — easily digestible and
minimally sustaining. The film's re
flective camera demands of the audi
ence a thoughtful patience as it takes
time to move between its subjects and
the Montana landscape, allowing fora
natural development of character and
story largely unseen since the charac
ter-driven pictures of the '70s.
Recently "The Slaughter
Rule'"s writer/director twins Andrew

and Alex Smith took some time to
speak with Intermission. A veritable candy-store of dou
ble MA.sand M.F.As (still a rarity amongst their con
temporaries), their original footsteps in the film indus
try were of the writing sort. They independently sat
down to write "The Slaughter Rule" in response to a
similar situation that occurred during their own child
hood. But the film has taken a somewhat less-than-glo
rious decade to go from paper to celluloid, where it has
only been scheduled to remain fora few weeks before its
DVD release. Highlights of the process included the di
rector jumping ship (thankfully forcing the Smiths into
the role themselves), constant conflicting interests on
behalf of their producers, taking the film to favorable re
ceptions at more than 30 festivals in the last year and still
failing to garner enough faith to keep it on screens for
more than a few scant weeks.
The problem, as Andrew says, lies in the fact that a
film which cannot be readily categorized has no market
value.
"They want to know what the poster is on the bus
passing by," he said. "The photo and the sentence. If
they don't have that, then they don't know what to do
with the film."
Advertising plays a central role, if not the central role
in filmmaking — if your distribution company doesn't
have the money to advertise, your film will come and go
unnoticed. "We wanted to make a strong film, not a
'type' film. But the studios and the public won't take it
on that level: They always want a specific angle. We
wanted the proof of its quality to be in the film itself."
As far as many critics are concerned, the proof is
there. While the Smiths' concerns and frustrations are
an intrinsic element of the industry and will likely
never change, their work has elicited enough positive
response for both to be busy working on a number of
other projects. Two of these are stories again influ
enced by real events and people. A very important fig
ure in the life of Alex Smith has been Terrence Malick
(director of "Badlands," "Days of Heaven" and "Thin
Red Line") who became his mentor while he was study
ing at the University of Texas at Austin. Alex describes
their relationship as having been enormously educa
tional.
"He is very intelligent, very gentle and very aware.
He is also slightly distracted by the world and can easily
digress into the plant or bird life around you: Whatever
happens to be in the surroundings."
These distractions are of course what make Malick's
work so inimitable. Alex wrote a screenplay for Malick in
1995, but asked whether his mentor has seen "The
Slaughter Rule," with its distinctly Malick-like qualities,
he was unsure.
Here's hoping that "The Slaughter Rule" signals the
advent of a new breed of thoughtful, complex and hon
est films, and Malick would be wise to get his hands on a
copy soon.


Ah, football. The perfect metaphor for life.


"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling some teen angst."
For those of you who may not he fa
miliar with the intricacies of a sport I
like to call American football, the
'slaughter rule' (reserved for amateur
competition) decrees that a game be
called when one team gets ahead of
the other by 45 points. Only applica
ble in the second half, it is designed to
end games in which there is no longer
any real competition —to prevent
teams from "running up the score"
and demoralizing their opponents.
The term is uttered only once dur
ing the course of "The Slaughter
Rule," which was released on DVD
Feb. 18. Its significance lies off the
field rather than on. Grace is a neces-

sary component of any relationship, but it is in conspic
uous absence among the film's subjects (as in our own,
no doubt). Only as things are really falling apart do the
characters eventually learn and move out beyond the
world of routine in which they have literally been
frozen.
The story's reluctant hero, Roy (suffused with a tacit
self-possession by the angelic Ryan Gosling), has been
ousted from the school's football team for not being
angry enough. He is a talented player, but he does not
know passion. He has grown up without an under
standing of intimacy, and although he is forthright and
gentle, he has not quite learned to trust himself or oth
ers enough to be truly honest. Select shots of the beauti
fully unforgiving landscape remind us that this is a trait
of his environment: It is designed to alienate, not pro
tect. Even in summer, it seems as though a thin crust of
ice covers the grass: The film suggests that football, with
the heated violence of its physical interactions, is the
only way to come up against it.
