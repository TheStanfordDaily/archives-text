# This steamy show sizzles

Someone once said that any technology advanced enough
will seem like magic to the beholder. In other words, lowly
critics who haven't seen much theater (such as yours truly)
will be easily amused. It's quite possible that this simple-mind
ed reviewer was merely caught up in the wonders of song and
dance of a typical live performance.
But for an hour and a half in Roble Theater this past Sun
day, 1 witnessed magic of some sort. The cast of "Lulu," a joint
production of the Bent Spoon Dance Company, Stage One
Productions and Theater Q, vvas going through its first com
plete run-through. That they managed to impress without
the aid of their costumes, lighting, or even music director
Emily Greble's five piece jazz band is a testament to the
strengths of the production and director Ed Iskandar.
Choreographer Rebecca Whitehurst stars as the title char
acter, Lulu, a smoldering temptress and sweet Svengali who
racks up quite a list of dead or tormented lovers in the course
of her life. I have to confess that a single uninformed viewing
of the show left me a little hazy on specific plot points, but suf
fice it to say that we'll encounter a manic lover (Dan Fink as
Dr. Schoen), a lesbian countess (Val Sinckler) and even Jack
the Ripper (Jonathan Kaplan) before it's all over. Meredith
Kendall as The Fiancee and Jordan Kaplan as The Owner
round out the principal cast.
The immediately striking feature of "Lulu" is that it is en
tirely sung, featuring no spoken lines of dialogue whatsoever.
Franz Wedekind's play has already been interpreted as an
opera and a film (1928's "Pandora's Box"), but this "Lulu" is
a sly reincarnation that utilizes the bombastic musical styles of
jazz and cabaret to flaunt its themes.
What might have seemed gimmicky in concept is actually
cjuite convincing in execution, in no small part due to White
hurst's choreography; not only do the game principals move
about with sinuous grace, but the backup dancers also add a

valuable amount to the performance, highlighting action and
interpreting key moments without appearing the slightest bit
obtrusive to the main characters.
And the music itself is no snooze either — the marketing
for "Lulu" trumpets it as a "Chicago" meets "Cabaret" ex
travaganza, and those who are drawn in by this promise won't
be disappointed. Most of the songs do tend to be of the show
stopping variety — grand, yet with lyrics full of modern ver
nacular. These rousing numbers, along with the unllappabil
ity ol the cast were already enough to evoke images of smoky
jazz dens and shadowy lounge singers at the rehearsal I wit
nessed. Theater connoisseur or no, the show will be some
thing to see when it moves into full costume, instrumentation
and lighting at its true home in Dinkelspiel; one can only
imagine the ensuing splendor of Iskandar's concoction.

"Lulu" will be playing at Dinkelspiel Auditorium on February 22,
23, 24 at Bpm with a matinee on February 23 at 2 pm. Tickets are
$9 for students, $15 general admission.
