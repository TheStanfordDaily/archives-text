# Want to sing with LiP Kim? You can duet!

### NASTASSIA LOPEZ 
The famous Dire Straits refrain, "I
want my MTV," echoed Saturday at San
Francisco's Metreon Theater, where Bay
Area kids lined up to get their "kicks for
free" as well as a chance to perform with
their favorite artists.
MTV is currently holding open audi
tions across America fora new series,
"Duets." In San Francisco, I met fans
awaiting their turn to sing, play the key
board or bang on some drums in front of
a panel ofjudges. The contestants were in
structed to perform a song by artists like
Usher and LiF Kim and were then given
an opportunity to perform another song
of their own choice. The contestants
ended by telling the judges (and the cam
era) why they should be the ones picked to
meet their favorite artist. Contestants
deemed talented enough by the judges
get a chance to star in the show and per
form a duet with their favorite musician.
"The show is taking the biggest fans of
these artists who are also talented and
putting them in a recording studio with
the artist so that they can actually record
with them and work with their vocal
coaches," said "Duets" producer Terence
Michael. "It's like the ultimate fora fan
who happens to be talented."

"Duets" has already lined up music
celebrities like LiF Kim, B2K, Blink 182
and Vanessa Carlton. Usher will debut on
the show's pilot episode, along with his
biggest fan, who spent the day at Usher's
private house and recorded in his studio.
Most of the contestants came from the

Oakland area. The demographics ranged
from men in their early 20s to single
mothers who brought their kids into the
auditioning room while they sang.
Contestants were ushered one-by-one
into a small studio where a camera and
two judges awaited them. They stated

their names and then sang their selection
karaoke-style. Following their perfor
mance, the judges asked them questions
like, "What makes you Lil' Kim's biggest
fan?" and "What would you do if you got
to spend the day with Blink 182?"
One such contestant responded enthu
siastically to the camera: "Hey Lil' Kim!
What's up, girl? If you and I got to spend
the day together — girrrrl, you know
we'd be shoppin'!"
Other contestants were there to "prove
themselves" to family and friends. "I'm
sick of everyone calling me 'zero,'" said a
21-year-old girl auditioning from Hay
ward
By not showcasing any egregiously un
talented singers and refraining from of
fensive criticism, "Duets" takes pride in
being a more sympathetic "American
Idol." After spending an afternoon with
these eager contestants, it's amazing
how seemingly simple it is to receive a
chance to be on M'rV's new reality tele
vision show. Even with a sub-par voice,
contestants with charisma made the cut —
it all came down to charming the judges
and being comfortable with the camera.
MTV's "Duets" will debut on April 21.
If anyone is interested in auditioning for
the show, MTV's scouts will return to the
Bay Area in early March.
