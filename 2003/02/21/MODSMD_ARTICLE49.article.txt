# Rap debut lives up to the hype
## 
### CONNELL HANDFORD 
Forget any comparisons you've heard, 'cuz
hype like this just hasn't happened yet. This
ain't Pac or 8.1.G. hype. This ain't even Em
inem hype. This is some Leßron-type hype.
Case in point: Every music store I went to was
sold out within a couple days of its release. And
Palo Alto ain't exactly "urban," feel me?
50 Cent's mass appeal seems to be largely
based off his rags-to-riches story and the ap
parent realism he relates in his rhymes. They
say what doesn't kill you only makes you
stronger, and as far as 50's promotion goes,
that saying rings true ... literally. Everybody
and their mama knows by now that 50 took
nine shots a couple years back, one of which
went through his jaw and is responsible for that
southern drawl that has become his signature
sound. Yeah. Try that on for street credibility.
Thugs don't really buy albums though, so this
much hype can't be based on street cred alone.
There is that one other thing that has put 50's
name on the tip of everyone's tongue . .. or
two, actually: Dr. Dre and Eminem.
Still, can an artist with so much marketing
hype really stand up to it all when it's time to
pop that disc into your player? Or those MP3s
in your playlist?
Best believe it. The thing that works best
about this album is the fact that there are really
no surprises. 50 Cent is a self-proclaimed
gangsta's gangsta, and he spends the whole
album reminding you of that fact.
On a Dre production, "Heat," the beat itself
is a mixture of gun cocks and blasts. Oh, and in
case you forgot how 50 handles beef, he re
minds you that he will make your "brain hop
out the top/ like Jack in the Box." The imagery
is horrifying and hilarious at the same time,
which is indicative of 50's braggadocious
rhymes throughout. See, 50 manages to spit
the same tales of gun play, drug trafficking and

general mayhem that you'll hear from nearly
every gangster rapper since the genre started
circa NWA, yet he does it in a refreshing way
due to his sense of humor and lyrical wit. He
even manages to poke fun at his own brush
with death on the bonus track "U Not Like
Me," saying, "From the last shootout, I got a
dimple on my face / It's nothin'... I could go
after Mase fan-base."
When 50's team of producers (including
lesser-known beat creators such as Rob Tewlow

and SixFigga)

is providing
him with a j
sonic back-1
drop as

nice as that

50 Cent
> Get Rich or Die Tryin'

displayed on most of the cuts on the album, it's
hard not to get your nod on. Just check the cer
tified bangers, "What up Gangsta?" and "Like
My Style," as well as the you-can't-go-five-min
utes-without-hearin'-that hit, "In Da Club."
But there are some things you should not ex
pect when purchasing this album. Don't expect
complex rhyme schemes or thought-provoking
lyrical wizardry. Don't expect an Eminem
album, though he shows up nicely on two cuts
("Patiently Waiting" and "Don't Push Me"). And
don't expect massive levels of consistency, either,
as 50 goes from supreme misogynist ("P.1.M.P.")
to sensitive thug ("21 Questions") in the span of
four songs. 50 Cent is clearly not the savior of
hip-hop, and this is not an album absent of flaws.
Still, there's something inevitably irresistible
about an underdog laughing in the face of long
odds, and that makes 50's twisting of war stories
into comedic shenanigans so endearing. Fur
thermore, there's something to be said about
honesty and artistry, which is why the average
Paly High kid probably feels he can relate more
easily to this album than the studio gangsters 50
scorns in his now-legendary "Wanksta."
All of this basically equals one thing: mar

ketability. The album is titled right, as 50's view
of the American dream is easily deciphered
through his slurred speech. I guess that half ex
plains why he's destined to see bank with this
album, since despite his close call, he ain't dead
yet. 50 speaks on that sentiment nicely on
"Many Men (Wish Death)" when he discusses
his would-be-killer:
"In the Bible it says 'what goes around,
comes around'/ Almost shot me, three weeks
later he got shot down. / Now it's clear that I'm
here fora real reason / 'Cuz he got hit like I got
hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'!"
Now that, my friends, is gangsta!

even manages to poke fun at his own brush
with death on the bonus track "U Not Like
Me," saying, "From the last shootout, I got a
dimple on my face / It's nothin'... I could go
after Mase fan-base."
When 50's team of producers (including
lesser-known beat creators such as Rob Tewlow

and SixFigga)

is providing
him with a j
sonic back-1
drop as

nice as that

50 Cent
> Get Rich or Die Tryin'

displayed on most of the cuts on the album, it's
hard not to get your nod on. Just check the cer
tified bangers, "What up Gangsta?" and "Like
My Style," as well as the you-can't-go-five-min
utes-without-hearin'-that hit, "In Da Club."
But there are some things you should not ex
pect when purchasing this album. Don't expect
complex rhyme schemes or thought-provoking
lyrical wizardry. Don't expect an Eminem
album, though he shows up nicely on two cuts
("Patiently Waiting" and "Don't Push Me"). And
don't expect massive levels of consistency, either,
as 50 goes from supreme misogynist ("P.1.M.P.")
to sensitive thug ("21 Questions") in the span of
four songs. 50 Cent is clearly not the savior of
hip-hop, and this is not an album absent of flaws.
Still, there's something inevitably irresistible
about an underdog laughing in the face of long
odds, and that makes 50's twisting of war stories
into comedic shenanigans so endearing. Fur
thermore, there's something to be said about
honesty and artistry, which is why the average
Paly High kid probably feels he can relate more
easily to this album than the studio gangsters 50
scorns in his now-legendary "Wanksta."
All of this basically equals one thing: mar

ketability. The album is titled right, as 50's view
of the American dream is easily deciphered
through his slurred speech. I guess that half ex
plains why he's destined to see bank with this
album, since despite his close call, he ain't dead
yet. 50 speaks on that sentiment nicely on
"Many Men (Wish Death)" when he discusses
his would-be-killer:
"In the Bible it says 'what goes around,
comes around'/ Almost shot me, three weeks
later he got shot down. / Now it's clear that I'm
here fora real reason / 'Cuz he got hit like I got
hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'!"
Now that, my friends, is gangsta!
