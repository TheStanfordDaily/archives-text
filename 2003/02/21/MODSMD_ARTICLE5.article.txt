# Parents descend upon Stanford
## 
### JULIE LEIN 
Today the University expects to be
inundated with nearly 2,800 family
members for Parents' Weekend, one
of the few opportunities each the year
for students to see family — or simply
escape from the monotony of dining
hall food.
Organizers anticipate that this
year's crowd will he right on par with
last year's high attendance and will in
clude visitors from 18 countries and 49
states. Along with Reunion Homecom
ing, Commencement, Admit Weekend
and Orientation, Parents' Weekend is
one of Stanford's "Big 5" events.
Freshmen's parents comprise half
of the attendees, with 20 percent for
sophomores and 15 percent for each
juniors and seniors — a decline that
leaves many wondering whether Par
ents' Weekend is geared more toward
freshmen parents than the families of
upperclassmen.
"My parents have always loved Par
ents' Weekend," said senior Allison
Lee. "This will be their third year at
tending. They even wanted to come
last year, even though I was abroad in
Berlin."
There are some obvious differences
in Parents' Weekend for freshmen par
ents, as it is one of the first opportuni
ties for Stanford families to truly catch
a glimpse of undergraduate life on
campus.
Andrea Silton, mother of freshman
Shari Ilsen, explained, "I helped
move her in and saw her room bar
ren. Now, it's the first time I get to see
her room after she's really made it
into her own. It's also my first look
into her social and academic life on
campus."
In attempts to appeal to seniors'
parents, Ryan Foley, Parents' Week
end coordinator, has introduced a new
event called Brunch on the Bay. The

students themselves are sponsoring
this Sunday activity, which will be a
highlight for seniors and their parents.
Much of the appeal of Parents'
Weekend, at least from the parents'
perspective, is found in classes. On
both Friday and Saturday, families

may sit in on special lectures on topics
ranging from sleep and ethics to neu
rology and economics.

lecturer in Italian, is one of the fea-

warmly received by parents in
the past, and she enjoys lecturing

"The response [to my lecture]

But classes are not the only
thing to do. Parents' Weekend
has always aimed at showing
what daily life is like on campus.

Other events include receptions
with Provost John Etchemendy,
Vice Provost for Undergradu

and Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lyth
cott-Haims. President John
Hennessy is also scheduled to
give an address on Friday after
noon that will include a ques
tion and answer session.
The Stanford Parents' Club is
also inviting families to attend
the Entertainment Extravagan
za! to be held Saturday after
noon. The show features the a
cappella group Mixed Company,
the Fine Line jazz ensemble, the
Stanford Savoyards and Jam
Pac'd.
Parents will also have the op
portunity to visit the various
community centers on campus
and eat lunch in their sons' and
daughters' dining halls. Cam
pus tours, athletic games, reli
gious services and a play are
also planned.
Many students, however, will
not have visitors this weekend.
"For me, at least it's an opportu
nity to get some better food from
the dining hall," said senior Sara
Wampler, who did not express
much sadness about her own
family's absence from Parents'
Weekend. "Or, if I'm really
lucky, I'll just latch on to one of
my friend's families and get them
to pay for dinner."
