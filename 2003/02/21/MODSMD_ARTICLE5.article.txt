# Parents descend upon Stanford
## 
### JULIE LEIN 
Today the University expects to be
inundated with nearly 2,800 family
members for Parents' Weekend, one
of the few opportunities each the year
for students to see family — or simply
escape from the monotony of dining
hall food.
Organizers anticipate that this
year's crowd will he right on par with
last year's high attendance and will in
clude visitors from 18 countries and 49
states. Along with Reunion Homecom
ing, Commencement, Admit Weekend
and Orientation, Parents' Weekend is
one of Stanford's "Big 5" events.
Freshmen's parents comprise half
of the attendees, with 20 percent for
sophomores and 15 percent for each
juniors and seniors — a decline that
leaves many wondering whether Par
ents' Weekend is geared more toward
freshmen parents than the families of
upperclassmen.
"My parents have always loved Par
ents' Weekend," said senior Allison
Lee. "This will be their third year at
tending. They even wanted to come
last year, even though I was abroad in
Berlin."
There are some obvious differences
in Parents' Weekend for freshmen par
ents, as it is one of the first opportuni
ties for Stanford families to truly catch
a glimpse of undergraduate life on
campus.
Andrea Silton, mother of freshman
Shari Ilsen, explained, "I helped
move her in and saw her room bar
ren. Now, it's the first time I get to see
her room after she's really made it
into her own. It's also my first look
into her social and academic life on
campus."
In attempts to appeal to seniors'
parents, Ryan Foley, Parents' Week
end coordinator, has introduced a new
event called Brunch on the Bay. The

students themselves are sponsoring
this Sunday activity, which will be a
highlight for seniors and their parents.
Much of the appeal of Parents'
Weekend, at least from the parents'
perspective, is found in classes. On
both Friday and Saturday, families

may sit in on special lectures on topics
ranging from sleep and ethics to neu
rology and economics.
