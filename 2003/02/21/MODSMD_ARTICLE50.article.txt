# 'Thursday' makes great listening for any given day

### JENNIE KIM 
With the release of his live CD, "Any Given
Thursday," John Mayer has cemented his status as
the Next Big Thing in a long line of scruffy-around
the-edges, guitar-playing, Reef-wearing, singer/
songwriters that fall under the broad umbrella of
Dave Matthews. Having a strong live performance
base is requisite for artists in this category, and
Mayer delivers on this double disc effort.
Of the 15 tracks, only four are not from his ex

cellent prior release, "Room for

Squares." There isn't very
much difference between the
two albums, but the lack of
contrast doesn't necessarily

John Mayer
i Any Given Thursday

take away from "Any Given

Thursday." Of the made-under studio versions,
"Back to You" especially benefits from Mayer's
impromptu elaborations, giving the song a de
lightful impetuousness that the studio version
doesn't convey.
Also, "Your Body is a Wonderland," besides
being one of the best songs written with the ex
press purpose of getting laid, is soulful and seduc
tive live. In the same vein, the previously unre
leased "Comfortable" is a charming ode to sub
lime love that is perfect in its imperfection. Com
paring his current "so flawless" squeeze to the one
that got away, Mayer tells his ex, "Our love was
comfortable and so broken-in" and laments, "I
want you back."
Of the other three previously unreleased tracks,
"Message in a Bottle" is my favorite. An ideal com
bination of steady guitar beats with simple vocals,

the song is about seeking for something bigger, as
Mayer labels himself a castaway and croons, "I'll
send an S.O.S. to the world /1 hope that someone
gets my message in a botde."
Mayer is great at crafting superficially introspec
tive, safely quirky lyrics in the style of Ben Harper
and Jack Johnson (I still wonder what merits a
"bubbly toe"). "Why Georgia" is perhaps the penul
timate quasi-pensive reflection for college students
everywhere. In it, Mayer asks the banner question
for twenty-somethings about life: "Am I living it

right?" Tinkered slightly from the
studio version, Mayer adds a
catchy intro to transition into the
song in performance; although the
body of the song remains nearly
identical to the polished version,

save for the chanting of the crowd and occasional
curse word thrown in on the sly.
The live aspect lends itself to loads of guitar
based instrumentals, which Mayer does well,
though not spectacularly, on this CD. I've never
been an avid fan of these 11 minute-long instru
mentals — I have a suspicion that most of the in
strumental asides in the live DMB-esque genre are
added to satisfy the artist's vanity.
As a whole, this album is great mood music, per
fect for road trips, group study sessions and, if
you're so fortunate, getting laid. For die-hard
Mayer fans with "Room for Squares" and "Inside
Wants Gut" already in heavy rotation, "Any Given
Thursday" would be a welcome addition. It's a solid
live album for those who enjoy such variety but
serves more like a companion piece to "Room for
Squares" than a separate entity.



Oh, that John Mayer is so dreamy .. . and blurry
