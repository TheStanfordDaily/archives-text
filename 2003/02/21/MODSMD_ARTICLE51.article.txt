# New, but not improved, Folk Implosion disappoints
## 
### WILL OREMUS 
There is something to be said for unbri
dled self-expression, art as exploration of
the soul. For over a decade, indie icon Lou
Barlow's various projects have inspired
would-be songwriters to pour their guts
into the composition (if popular music.
But popular music is supposed to be lis
tenable at a bare minimum and, ideally, a
cathartic experience for someone other
than the artist himself. Barlow's latest ef
fort, "The New Folk Implosion," falls short
of this standard.
After a three-year hiatus, the erstwhile
Dinosaur Jr. bassist and Sebadoh front
man enlisted drummer Russell Pollard
and guitarist Imaad Wassif to revive Folk
Implosion in the wake of original collabo
rator John Davis's departure. Barlow and
Davis had scored an unlikely hit in 1995
with "Natural One," a catchy yet creepy
single from the "Kids" soundtrack, and
the duo's last album, "One Part Lullaby,"
drew praise from critics for its inventive

and well-crafted
pop tunes.
Yet both "One
Part Lullaby" and
the last, self-titled,
Sebadoh album
sold slowly and left
Barlow wondering,
in his own words,
"What the hell is
this for? Why do I
want to share this
pain with people?"
Listening to his
new album, I won
dered the same
thing.
Relentlessly
gloomy, "The New

Folk Implosion" is too consistent for its
own good. As the album drones on, com
plex song structures and competent gui
tar work are drowned out by the monoto-

Ny of Barlow's drugged
vocals. Fhe throbbing
dance beats and elec
tronic tomfoolery that
hooked listeners on
Folk Implosion's early
work are missing from
the band's new incarna
tion, replaced by Se
badoh drummer Russ
Pollard's mechanistic
stick work.
Barlow has never

Folk Implosion
The New Folk
Implosion

made fun music, but "The
New Folk Implosion" is so mirthless that
sitting through it is a chore. Perhaps this is
intended — Barlow claims that the album

mirrors his personal struggles with addic
tion — but it's hard to imagine why anyone
would want to listen to the aural equivalent
of heroin withdrawal.
The first song, "Fuse," sets an uneasy
tone, its searing guitars and anxious
rhythm providing an anguished back
drop for Barlow's listless intonations
about "the end of everything." The
equally dark "Brand of Skin" features a
delicate interlude that foreshadows the
acoustic singer-songwriter stylings of
"Pearl," the only pretty song on the
album.
The pretentiously misspelled "Releast"
restores the angst, which continues unabat
ed until the last track. "Easy" is supposed to
be the post-detox payoff, and indeed it
brings a sense of relief, mainly because it
means the disc is almost at an end. The first
time I heard Barlow sing the last line, "the
fight is over for now," I nearly shouted, "It's
about damn time!"


"Shadow puppets are neat!"
