### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
This is the first of a two-part series where Roxy expounds on
the glory of geek sex.
To some, the words "geek" and "sex" may be mu
tually exclusive, never even to appear in the same
sentence. But this girl knows that on Stanford cam
pus, the Land of a Thousand Geeks, geeks having
sex and sexy geeks abound.
Take it from Roxy: Fine-ass geeks exist aplenty on
this campus! 1 spot them all over the place — in my
classes, by Annenberg / Cummings (don't ignore
those art geeks!), by Terman, by the science and en
gineering quad on a warm spring day. Admittedly, I
do have a soft spot in my heart for geeks, as I do for
most kinds of men: carpenters, motorbike racers,
chefs ... but I digress.
Geeks have enjoyed a relatively recent renais
sance but are still under-appreciated, by and large.
Girls, do your cargo pant-wearing, Ultimate-playing
beaus get bored when you want to watch "Donnie
Darko," or discuss that amazing exhibit you saw at
Cantor last week? Boys, why not ask out that girl
whose eyes DON'T glaze over when you go to Fry's
for the millionth time? Isn't it just adorable how she
can fix your computer and understand CSIO7 better
than you ever could?
Convinced? Want to be a part of the action? Want
a geek of your own to objectify and sexualize in all
sorts of delightful ways? I've identified a few key
geek hangouts for you geek fens just getting started:
1. Moonbeans Cafe: Here you'll find geeks of all
kinds: History Geeks, Art Geeks, Archaeology Geeks

and so on. The variety is nice and, be
cause of its close proximity to Meyer
and Green Library, you can pretend
to yourself that you're studying — all
while enjoying the view.
2. Science and Engineering Quad:
An embarrassment of geekly riches.
You have your TCSEQ, your Gates
building, your Packard — need I say
more? Hanging out here and not
bumping into a geek would be akin to
swimming in the ocean with your
mouth open without drinking any
water. And, as always, having class
here is a good excuse to hang around.
3. Second Floor, Sweet Hall: The
king of all geek hookups. Hey, it's not
ALL suffering and UNIX machines.
Being Roxy Sass, I've had some non-
CS-related fun here; unless you
count the CS major I was having it

with. He was red-eyed and sleepy but perked up
very quickly when I pulled him away from his com
puter into the basement of Sweet Hall. One random
room, one happy CS student with a preemptive
erection and one Roxy equals one hell of a fabulous
time (and incidentally, the best cunnilingus I've ever
had. Who knew his quick mind and quick fingers
translated into such quick tongue?)
Go to it, girls and boys! There are scrumptious
geeks to be found everywhere, at every library desk,
in every dorm, under every rock and log. Geeks of
every major, every race and creed and blood type!
This column, in fact, is dedicated to the astounding
ly foxy, Ewan McGregor-look-a-like geek who I see

around Terman. I saw him in a sports uniform wip
ing sweat off his forehead, which immediately gave
me the idea for this week's column. God bless you,
mystery geek!
And finally, when you snag your chosen geek,
don't forget to take some time out of your busy Stan
ford lives, so he or she can spend some time telling
you all about the integral of e to the x, if you know
what I mean. Sorry, dear readers, I just had to say it.
