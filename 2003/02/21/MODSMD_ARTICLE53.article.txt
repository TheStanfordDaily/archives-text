# Stanford students revive 'Vagina'
## 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
/ Women are worried about their vaginas; that is,
'according to "The Vagina Monologues." The play

celebrates the power and mystery of the vagina and
was performed by Stanford students this weekend in

support of V-Day, an organization that funds grassroots
workshops to prevent violence against women and

[girls. Stanford students and community members

flocked to Kresge Auditorium, filling it to capacity for
\ three shows this weekend.

The Stanford production remained remarkably
true to the original off-Broadway, Obie Award

(the off-Broadway Tony Award) winning
show, written by women's activist Eve Ensler.
I For the student-produced and directed show,

two monologues — one based on the prob
| lems faced by Native American women living

on reservations and one musical number —
Iwere added. To create the monologues,

over 200 women, representing a diverse
i range of ages and social, economic, racial,

religious and political backgrounds,
were interviewed about their vaginas,
answering the seemingly silly questions
of what their vaginas would wear if they
could get dressed or what they would
say if they could talk. Out of these an-

swers sprung the monologues; some are individual stories, some collaborations on
a common theme, but all are based on interviews with real people.
Though the monologues covered a wide variety of topics, from orgasms and
periods to sexual assault and genital mutilation, they did so without falling victim
to the usual cliched opinions and messages. The actresses performed with passion,
and the monologues remained original and sincere, which lent a subtle poignan
cy to the more serious and even disturbing stories.
These upsetting monologues were mixed in with lighthearted anecdotes, like
one mention of a "happy vagina fact" — the vagina is the only organ designed sole
ly for pleasure. Also in the mix were monologues addressing serious problems
through the use of humor, especially concerning the problem of women being ei
ther totally uninformed about or disgusted by their own vaginas.
It was hard to laugh at anything after the monologue describing the systematic
rape of women as a tactic of war in Bosnia and Kosovo. I have never heard silence
so profound fill a large auditorium as when the climax of that piece was reached.
The transition back to comedic interpretations of sex after that moving perfor
mance was lost on me, and I was unable to crack a smile for the next few minutes
of comedy. It was reassuring to know that I was not the only one in the audience
who felt that way.
Each monologue brought up a different provocative issue concerning women's
health, rights or individual life experience. The intimate atmosphere of acoustic
guitar, plush couches and girls wearing all black with red feather boas gave the au
dience a sense of comfort. Knowing that everyone there was happy to celebrate the
vagina allowed not only for the show to begin with an interactive vagina chant but
also for almost five minutes of orgasm impressions and a reclamation of the word
"cunt" by the audience doing the wave across Kresge while yelling out "CUNT!"
In the end, the audience all agreed that the cunt wave was back by popular de
mand.
