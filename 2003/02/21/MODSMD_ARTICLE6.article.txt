# Teach for America offers an alternative to grads

While students receive a high-cal
iber education at Stanford, sometimes
the last thing on their minds come
graduation is teaching. Nonetheless,
organizations like Teach For Ameri
ca, a nation-wide program which
seeks to bridge the disparity between
affluent schools and schools with
fewer resources, find that Stanford
students are among their most consis
tent participants.
l each for America Bay Area Re

cruitment Director Renee Purdy said
that, in the past, Stanford was in the top
20 schools that contributed teachers to
this program.
The deadline to apply to be a TFA
teacher for the upcoming year is today.
According to Sarah Almy, a gradu
ate student at the School of Education
and campus liaison for TFA, the pro
gram is "an amazing opportunity to
make a significant impact straight out
of college."
After majoring in political science at
Boston College, Almy applied for TFA

and taught special education fourth
and fifth-graders in 1 fouston. After fin
ishing her two-year commitment, she
stayed on another year to work in the
regional office. Her involvement gave
her insight into the challenges and is
sues faced by the nation's educational
system.
"[The organization has] very much
helped me focns on what I wanted to
do," Almy said. "I started to meet peo
ple so dynamic and dedicated [and felt
privileged] to become a part of that net
work of individuals."

Many TFA alumni establish valuable
connections and go on to impact the
educational system through teaching,
administration and policy work.
The program seeks graduates of all
majors. Almy felt her leadership roles
in college increased her creativity in
planning lessons and her strong liberal
arts background allowed her to "open
up [her] students' minds." She added
that the ongoing training, as well as the
summer preparation, facilitated her
teaching.
Senior Ryan Stewart, Stanford
campus campaign coordinator,
said, "[TFA] is a challenging expe
rience you get better with as time
goes on."
On why he decided to apply,
Stewart said, "I wanted the oppor
tunity to be unconventional... to
do something I'd really enjoy
doing and to give back ... It's a
national movement for social
change."
The application process is ex
tremely rigorous. It consists of an
uploaded resume, a personal
statement and a 500 word essay.
This is followed by interviews. Ap
plicants need not be credentialed
and there is no set standard num
ber of applicants accepted. The
onset of the program saw 500
corps members in 6 regions.
Today there are over 6,000 alum
ni and 2,500 teachers on the job.
This year, 1,700 applicants were
accepted and the program hopes
to place about 2,000 in 18 regions
this application period.
Among those accepted, the av

erage GPA is a 3.5 and about 89
percent held some sort of leader
ship position in college. Applicants
must have a cumulative GPA of
2.5, a bachelor's degree by late
June and be U.S. citizens, nation
als or lawful permanent residents.
"[We] are good at looking at the
applicants holistically," Purdy
said. "In the short run, we're look
ing for outstanding individuals
who will go up and beyond in the
classrooms. Second, we're looking
for leaders in all fields .. . who are
going to take this experience with
them . . . and address the achieve
ment gap."
In addition to changing partici
pants' perspectives, TFA can also
aid them in the graduate school
admissions and employment. Cer
tain businesses and organizations
consider TFA alumni strong can
didates, and some graduate
schools even offer two-year defer
rals to students who join TFA,
knowing that people with these
skills often bring unique experi
ence and insight. TFA teachers
may also receive a yearly Ameri-
Corps education award of $4,725
that can be used to pay back stu
dent loans or for future education.
