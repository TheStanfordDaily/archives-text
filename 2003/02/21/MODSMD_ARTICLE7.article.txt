## Shall we dance? 
### JESSICA WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hundreds of balls take place in Vi
enna during the season of Fasching,
the seven weeks between New Year's
Eve and the beginning of Lent. Every
year, although they are worlds away
from Vienna, students at Stanford
have the opportunity to participate in
the magic of ballroom dancing.
Tonight marks the 26th annual Vi
ennese Ball, which will be held at the
Hyatt Regency in Burlingame from 8
p.m. to 2 a.m. Up to 450 couples are
expected to attend.
Started at Stanford University in
1977, when students returning
from the Stanford-in-Vienna pro
gram organized the first Viennese
Ball on campus in Toyon Hall, the
Ball has grown so popular that it was
moved off campus five years ago to
accommodate increased demand

for tickets.
Tickets cost $75 per couple for stu
dents and $95 per couple for faculty,
staff, alumni and the public. The tick
et price covers an afternoon tea, an
Austrian dinner, the ball itself and
Austria Week. Austria Week is the
week right before the Viennese Ball
where ballroom dancing lessons are
given, beginning with the Congress
of Vienna Waltz on Valentine's Day
and ending with the I leuriger Abend
on Thursday evening.
According to Freshman Jessica
Luo, who is on the Austria Week
Committee, the lessons are very pop
ular among those who plan to attend
the Viennese Ball.
"There have been close to 100
people who show up for lessons each
night," she said. "Generally they are
around two hours long and are

taught by students from the Vien
nese Opening Committee."
The Viennese Opening Com
mittee is selected at the beginning of
fall quarter based on applicants'
ballroom dancing abilities. They are
responsible for choreographing the
dance for the ball's opening cere
monies and teaching ballroom
dancing during Austria Week.
Many of the students who do at
tend the ball have taken social danc
ing lessons with Richard Powers of
the Drama Department.
Sophomore Eric Cheung, who is
taking a social dance class this quar
ter, is attending his first Viennese
Ball tonight.
"1 think it will be a really exciting
event for everyone," he said. "There
are going to be people who are real
ly good and also some people
who've never taken social dance be
fore and just want to go because it 'll
be fun. So with the music, dancing
and all the other performances, I
think it'll be a lot of fun."
Senior Qi Lin, co-head of the
Opening Committee, said a great
deal of work goes into planning the
ball, beginning spring quarter of the
preceding year, when the heads for
the Steering Committee and other
committees are chosen.
"Tiflanv Lee, the other co-head of

the [Opening] Committee, and I
each spent about 10 to 15 hours a
week these last two quarters plan
ning events, practices and working
on the choreography itself ," Lin said.
"Over the summer we spent about
four to six hours a week together lay
ing things out for this year."
This year's ball will feature the
Opening Ceremony with a ballet
performance and a waltz exhibition
in the tradition of the Viennese
Opera Ball. For those who are not
too busy dancing, there are perfor
mances every 20 minutes through
out the night.
Senior Eric Lai, publicity chair for
Viennese Ball, was in charge of ticket
sales and the creation and production
of FUCKS ads, fliers, T-shirts, posters
and commemorative wine glasses for
the event. When asked about his ex
pectations for the Viennese Ball after
all his hard work, he responded,
"Tonight marks the culmination of a
journey that started back in April
2002. I'm kx)king forward to every
moment of it , and I think each of the
1,000 people attending will have a
great time."
Junior Andrea Christenson, the
Viennese Ball chair, echoed Lai's
thoughts on the upcoming ball.
"I am really looking forward to
it," she said. "I can't wait to see all
of our planning come together,
and I love the atmosphere of the
ball itself. It's a very unique event,
and is definitely one of my favorite
Stanford traditions."
