Hundreds of balls take place in Vi
enna during the season of Fasching,
the seven weeks between New Year's
Eve and the beginning of Lent. Every

from Vienna, students at Stanford
have the opportunity to participate in
the magic of ballroom dancing.
Tonight marks the 26th annual Vi
ennese Ball, which will be held at the
Hyatt Regency in Burlingame from 8
p.m. to 2 a.m. Up to 450 couples are
expected to attend.

1977, when students returning
from the Stanford-in-Vienna pro

Ball on campus in Toyon Hall, the
Ball has grown so popular that it was

Tickets cost $75 per couple for stu
dents and $95 per couple for faculty,
staff, alumni and the public. The tick
et price covers an afternoon tea, an
Austrian dinner, the ball itself and
Austria Week. Austria Week is the
week right before the Viennese Ball
where ballroom dancing lessons are
given, beginning with the Congress
of Vienna Waltz on Valentine's Day
and ending with the I leuriger Abend
on Thursday evening.

the Viennese Ball.

people who show up for lessons each
night," she said. "Generally they are
around two hours long and are
