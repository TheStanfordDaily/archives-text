# Senate votes to renew two IDPs
## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, the Faculty Senate
voted unanimously to renew two existing inter
disciplinary programs: the Program in Mathe
matical and Computational Sciences and the
Program in Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies.
The senate must review each interdisciplinary
program's academic merit and vote to renew it, in
this case fora period of five years.
Should a program fail to achieve the senate's
approval, the opportunity to obtain a degree in
the program disappears. The executive commit
tee of the non-renewed interdisciplinary program
is no longer allowed to nominate candidates for
bachelor's degrees, master's degrees or honors
certification.
In addition to reauthorizing existing pro
grams, the senate is also the final word on ap
proving each new interdisciplinary program.
The Committee for the Review of Under
graduate Majors or the Committee on Graduate
Studies must concur with the deans of the in
volved schools of study and the interdisciplinary
program directors to formally recommend reau
thorization of an interdisciplinary program. The
committee then presents a comprehensive re
port on the program to the senate and requests
its approval.
Neither program under review yesterday met
any opposition by senate members. Both will be
extended to August 2009, when the senate must
again vote to reauthorize them.
The Committee for the Review of Undergrad
uate Majors also discusses departmental majors
along with those offered by interdisciplinary pro
grams. It reviewed four departments last year and
will review an additional six this coming year.
