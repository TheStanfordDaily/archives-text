## Israeli offensive intensifies 
### 
BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip (AP) — Is
rael's week-old military offensive against Is
lamic militants in the Gaza Strip intensified
yesterday, and six Palestinians were killed
and 28 wounded in a raid on a Palestinian
town from which homemade rockets have
been fired at Israeli communities.
Two more Palestinians and an Israeli sol
dier were killed elsewhere in Gaza.
In response to yesterday's army assault,
Hamas militants fired three more short
range Qassam rockets from Beit Hanoun,
and one hit near a strip mall in the Israeli
town of Sderot, about 700 yards away. The
rocket caused some panic but no injuries.
Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz
said the military would maintain "relent
less" pressure on Islamic militants in Gaza
to halt the rocket fire. The offensive began
Feb. 17, a day after a Hamas attack on an Is
raeli tank killed four soldiers in Gaza. Since
then, 32 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier
have been killed in Gaza.
In Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
moved closer to establishing a new govern
ment as he signed up his first coalition part
ner — the National Religious Party that op
poses Palestinian statehood and advocates
Jewish settlement expansion in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
With the NRP as an ally, it appeared un
likely Sharon would freeze settlement con
struction, a key requirement of a U.S.-
backed "road map" to Palestinian statehood
by 2005. The coalition deal also appeared to
have ended Sharon's efforts of bringing in
the moderate Labor party, which was
trounced in a Jan. 28 election.
A third party, the secular Shinui, also is
expected to join a Sharon-led coalition, giv
ing him a slim 61-seat majority in the 120-
member parliament.
The army raid of Beit Hanoun began be
fore dawn yesterday and troops were still
there after nightfall.
In the past 29 months of fighting, sol
diers repeatedly entered Gaza towns and
cities but usually withdrew after a few hours.
Beit Hanoun has been targeted 10 times so
far, and troops once remained for three
days. By contrast, Israel reoccupied all but
one West Bank town in the summer.
Brig. Gen. Zvika Fogel, an area com

mander, refused to say how long the mili
tary operation in Beit Hanoun would last.
"We will end it when we have achieved our
objectives," he told Israel TV.
In Beit Hanoun, soldiers blew up the
homes of five suspected Islamic militants
yesterday. When soldiers approached one of
the targeted buildings, home to followers of
the militant Islamic Jihad, residents hurled
hand grenades and opened fire — the first
incident of armed resistance to a house de
molition. The residents surrendered after
four hours, and soldiers blew up the house.
Throughout the day, troops exchanged
fire with small groups of masked gunmen in
camouflage dress and fired from tank
mounted machine guns toward dozens of
stone-throwers, including children.
In all, six Palestinians were killed in Beit
Hanoun, including two stone throwers,
ages 17 and 20, a farmer and a policeman
who had participated in a gun battle.
Two border guards were found dead
near their post, hospital doctors said. Both
had knife marks, besides bullet wounds,
and one had no eyeballs, the doctors said,
suggesting the corpses had been mutilated.
Capt. Sharon Feingold, an Israeli army
spokeswoman, denied the charges. "We
target Palestinians who target our soldiers,
and we use various means to do this," she
said. "I reject any allegations that the bod
ies were mutilated."
An army officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the military used a flechette
shell to kill the two, referring to a shell that
explodes into thousands of lethal darts.
Twenty-eight Palestinians were wound
ed in the lighting, three of them seriously,
doctors said.
Several hours after the Israeli incursion,
Hamas fired three Qassam rockets from
Beit Hanoun. One fell near a strip mall in
Sderot.
Mofaz told the weekly Cabinet meeting
yesterday that he ordered the military to
make every effort to stop the rocket fire, ac
cording to a Cabinet statement. Mofaz "em
phasized that Hamas in Gaza has suffered a
string of painful blows this week and spoke
of Israel's intention to keep up the relentless
pressure on the Hamas infrastructure," the
statement said.
