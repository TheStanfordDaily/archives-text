CHICAGO (AP) —One nightclub
was evacuated early yesterday and an
other was forced to cancel a show after
fire inspectors descended on bars and
concert halls across the nation in re
sponse to two nightclub tragedies in the
span of a week.
In Chicago, where 21 people were
trampled at the E2 nightclub Feb. 17, in
spectors evacuated the second floor of a
club yesterday after finding overcrowd
ing, blocked exits and other problems.
A rock band competition planned
for Salem, Ore., was canceled after an
inspection there revealed the venue
didn't meet fire and building codes.
And other cities, including Dallas

and Kansas City, Mo., put more inspec
tors on duty and kept them out until the
early hours Saturday and Sunday,
when clubs are most crowded.
The flurry of inspections closely fol
lowed the deaths of 97 people late
Thursday in a West Warwick, R. 1.,
nightclub, where a rock band's py
rotechnics ignited the ceiling tiles and
quickly engulfed the nightclub and its
trapped patrons in flames.
Fire officials across the country said
yesterday that they were finding club
goers almost everywhere were more
aware of their surroundings than usual
and more willing to report problems.
"We've seen a sharp increase in the

number of reported overcrowdings,"
even though most didn't prove to be
problems, said Brian Humphrey, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire
Department.
More people than usual also called
Chicago authorities to complain about
clubs there, said Chief Kevin MacGre
gor, a department spokesman.
It was a complaint that led police to
the Rive Gauche nightclub yesterday.
"We found a number of life safety is
sues that required closing down the sec
ond floor of this club,"he said. "We will
be writing up violations on the building,
and they've got to comply before we let
them reopen."
