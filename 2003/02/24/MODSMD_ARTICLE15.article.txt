## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial No war without U.N. 
### 
The Bush administration plans to
present a new war resolution to
the United Nations Security
Council this week — one that
would authorize the use of military force
against Iraq. For the resolution to pass,
nine of the 15 Security Council members
must vote in favor and none of the five
permanent members —Britain, China,
France, the United States and Russia —
must veto it.
Currently China, France, Germany,
Russia and Syria are opposed to a new res
olution authorizing force against Iraq.
Britain, Bulgaria and Spain are in favor.
Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexi
co and Pakistan are undecided.
We still oppose, as we wrote a month ago,
any preemptive U.S.-led strike on Iraq
without direct consent from the United Na
tions. But unfortunately, as the Bush ad
ministration is steadfastly gathering sup
port fora new resolution, a war with Iraq
seems imminent.
A war with Iraq will have severe conse
quences around the world and nation.
While the Bush administration prepares
for an American attack, we urge members
of the Stanford community to carefully
consider the price of such an attack.
According to The New York Times, sev
ered Bush administrators have said that Pres
ident George W. Bush hopes to persuade
nine members to support the resolution and
then to confront France, Russia or China
with the challenge of vetoing the will of the
majority. Over the weekend, Bush met with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
and spoke to Mexican President Vicente Fox
and (Chilean President Ricardo Lagos in tele
phone calls. Bush would be wise to consider
other viewpoints, like that of former U.N.
Commissioner Mary Robinson.
When the former Irish President spoke
at Stanford last week, she said, "My own
view is that that there is more we can do
[to prevent a war]. I think the political
focus now, with the political support be
hind the inspections, is dramatically
changing the situation."
On Friday, U.N. Weapons Inspector
Hans Blix said that Iraq must start de
stroying all of its .\1 Samoud 2 missiles and
any illegally imported engines for use in
rockets within a week. Bush — concerned
that if Hussein complies, France will, once
again, argue that weapons inspections is
working — has said, in response, that
even if Iraq complies and decides to de
stroy long-range weapons, "that's just the
tip of the iceberg."
But if Saddam Hussein begins to get rid
of a few weapons now, Bush should give

him more time. Every American war in
the past century has resulted in civilian ca
sualties, and a war with Iraq will not be
any different. Thus, the question before
us now is whether such unintended
deaths are necessary or justified.
What we fear most, however, is that the
Bush administration will go to war even
without the consent of the U.N. Security
Council. We ask the president now to be
mindful of Robinson, who noted in her
talk that in "our globalizing, interconnect
ed world, the United States, as the super
power which has the power to act alone,
very much needs the United Nations for
moral legitimacy in order to avoid the
perception that might is right."
Moreover, in Bush's attempt to receive
U.N. Security Council consent fora war
with Iraq, we are concerned that he may
be bullying other countries into passing
the resolution. In meeting with world
leaders, we hope that Bush, too, recog
nizes that might is not right. Americans
often wonder why there are anti-Ameri
can sentiments around the world. An
American war with Iraq without U.N. Se
curity Council consent would give those
people yet another reason to be angry to
ward the United States. The possibility of
the United States going to war with Iraq
has pitted countries against one another;
without a doubt, the political implications
of going to war will be serious.
In both of the lectures that she gave at
Stanford, Robinson emphasized that Amer
icans live in a globalized world, in which ac
tions taken by one country had worldwide
impact. Thus it is the U.S. government's re
sponsibility to be mindful of the growing
antiwar sentiments around the world; the
effects of America's war with Iraq will ex
tend far beyond U.S. boundaries.
Robinson said that the "respect and sol
idarity" are needed to promote dialogue
and progress on the issue of security. We
believe that the Bush administration
should respect the international commu
nity's call for peace and the rights of the
many Iraqi civilians whose lives may be in
danger. We believe that the Bush admin
istration should stand in solidarity with
the U.N. Security Council and not act
alone in its desire to declare war.
We laud and appreciate the groups that
were involved in bringing Robinson to
Stanford. We have all been challenged to
think of ourselves as members of a global
community and as such, all of us at Stan
ford should be informed on the issues at
stake and continue to stand united to pre
vent a war that would be costly — and we
don't mean just financially.
