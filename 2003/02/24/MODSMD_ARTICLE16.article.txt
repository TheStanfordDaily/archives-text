# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Let's make peace tonight 
### 
We were worried that
we would have trou
ble coming up with
topics we could both
agree on, especially if we ever
wanted to tackle politics. One of us
is the communications director for
the Stanford Democrats and the
other one is a Republican, plain
and simple. Miraculously enough,
we are both anti the anti-Hoover
Institution movement.
After reading this column, it will
be clear that members of the Stan
ford Coalition for Peace and Jus
tice should throw down their peti
tions (into recycling bins of course)
and lovingly embrace every
Hoover Institution Fellow they
see, as they would embrace a poor,
oppressed Iraqi child.
The anti-Hoover Institution
movement's only leg to stand on is
its assertion that the Hoover Insti
tution's hiring policy is not in line
with University requirements be
cause it allegedly promotes politi
cal bias. The thrust of the Hoover
Institution's political slant,
whether we are talking about its
mission statement or its hiring pol
icy, is a pro-limited government
stance. This statement should not
be confused with something to the
effect of "you must be to the right
of Hitler to set foot in the building"
or even, "you have to be a Repub
lican to work here."
The Hoover Institution admin
istrators understand this distinc
tion and have managed to diversi
fy the composition of their fellows:
25 percent of them are registered
Democrats.
The Hoover Institution does
not have control over its fellows'
political views or actions. Hoover
Fellow William Perry served as
one of Clinton's defense secre
taries; more recently, Nobel Lau
reate Douglass North signed a pe
tition in opposition to the new
Bush tax cut.
While we're on the subject, the

Hoover Institution boasts three
Nobel Prize winners, bringing
some of the most brilliant ac adem
ic minds to our campus. No aca
demic department has more
Nobel Prize winners.
The Hoover Institution pro
vides many other unique resources
to the Stanford community. The
Hoover Archives is the envy of

many of c>ur peer institutu>ns. Even
the anti-Hoover Institution
protesters probably recognize the
invaluable collection of the Hoover
Archives. However, their naive de
mand for the books to stay, but for
the Hoover Institution Fellows to
go, is about as likely to be granted
as the innocent freshman's request
fora senior girl's number at Full
Moon on the Quad. As founder
1 lerbert Hoover said, "This institu
tion is not, and must not be, a mere
library."
Critics single out the Political
Science Department as a particu
lar victim of the "corrupting" in
fluence of the Hoover Institution.
It seems as though Hoover's oppo
nents cannot see the forest
through the trees. It is difficult to
argue that these professors are
anything but reputable, engaging
and strong assets from whom stu
dents can learn. Anyone who has
taken a class from Hoover Institu
tion Fellow Morris Fiorina should
realize that it is narrow-minded to
discount the contributions he has
brought to the field of political sci
ence through his research and to
Stanford's undergraduates
through his classes (hundreds of
PoliSci 2 students can't be wrong).

Indeed, there is no area that
demands scholars from all ends of
the political spectrum as much as
the science of politics. Even if you
don't buy our claim that Hoover
Institution Fellows aren't fascist
dictator pigs, it should make
sense to you that when studying
politics, there should be a dia
logue between liberals and con
servatives, not the left-wing
monologue for which some of you
so desperately chant.
Besides, what's fun about argu
ing with someone who agrees
with you?
Perhaps the most important
reason for the anti-Hoover Institu
tion protesters to desist would be
that the movement is harming
other, more pressing issues they
support. The radicalism of the
anti-Hoover Institution protests
cuts into the efficacy of the anti
war movement —an issue we
should all debate.
Chanting "Whose war?
Hoover's war!" diverts attention
from the real issue: whether or not
it should be America's war. Anti
lloover Institution protesters jus
tify their cry with the fact that
seven Hoover Institution Fellows
sit on the Defense Policy Board.
However, using this data to ex
trapolate some shadow govern
ment conspiracy via the Hoover
Institution sounds a little crazy.
Just because University Presi
dent John I lennessy was willing to
meet with the anti-Iloover Institu
tion protesters a week and a half
ago should not give these students
hope that their dreams will ever
come true. Their demand is so
outrageous we can't believe Hen
nessy even dignified their request
fora meeting.
It stands to reason, then, that
the anti-Hoover Institution
protesters ought to make love, not
war, and here's why: As Hoover


Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi

himself stated, "The overall mis
sion of this institution is to recall
the voice of experience against the
making of war." Doesn't this dec
laration sound eerily familiar to
what the primary objective of the
SCPJ would be?
Can you guess whose overarch
ing purpose is "to convey to the
public, the media, lawmakers and
others an understanding of im
portant public policy issues and to
promote vigorous dialogue?"
The answer is the Hoover In
stitution, but doesn't it sound an
awful lot like what those opposing
the institution have been doing?
And really, what's the differ
ence between a group that wants
to limit government actions and
another one that wants to over
throw it altogether?
So it makes sense that since
anti-Hoover Institution protesters
and Hoover Institution Fellows
both dislike the government, they
should join together in the face of
their common enemy and unite
their efforts in the name of peace,
justice and the American way.

ment? Tell us about it akendall@stan

Fellow William Perry served as
one of Clinton's defense secre

While we're on the subject, the

Hoover Institution boasts three
Nobel Prize winners, bringing
some of the most brilliant ac adem
ic minds to our campus. No aca
demic department has more
Nobel Prize winners.
The Hoover Institution pro
vides many other unique resources
to the Stanford community. The
Hoover Archives is the envy of

many of c>ur peer institutu>ns. Even
the anti-Hoover Institution
protesters probably recognize the
invaluable collection of the Hoover
Archives. However, their naive de
mand for the books to stay, but for
the Hoover Institution Fellows to
go, is about as likely to be granted
as the innocent freshman's request
fora senior girl's number at Full
Moon on the Quad. As founder
1 lerbert Hoover said, "This institu
tion is not, and must not be, a mere
library."
Critics single out the Political
Science Department as a particu
lar victim of the "corrupting" in
fluence of the Hoover Institution.
It seems as though Hoover's oppo
nents cannot see the forest
through the trees. It is difficult to
argue that these professors are
anything but reputable, engaging
and strong assets from whom stu
dents can learn. Anyone who has
taken a class from Hoover Institu
tion Fellow Morris Fiorina should
realize that it is narrow-minded to
discount the contributions he has
brought to the field of political sci
ence through his research and to
Stanford's undergraduates
through his classes (hundreds of
PoliSci 2 students can't be wrong).

Indeed, there is no area that
demands scholars from all ends of
the political spectrum as much as
the science of politics. Even if you
don't buy our claim that Hoover
Institution Fellows aren't fascist
dictator pigs, it should make
sense to you that when studying
politics, there should be a dia
logue between liberals and con
servatives, not the left-wing
monologue for which some of you
so desperately chant.
Besides, what's fun about argu
ing with someone who agrees
with you?
Perhaps the most important
reason for the anti-Hoover Institu
tion protesters to desist would be
that the movement is harming
other, more pressing issues they
support. The radicalism of the
anti-Hoover Institution protests
cuts into the efficacy of the anti
war movement —an issue we
should all debate.
Chanting "Whose war?
Hoover's war!" diverts attention
from the real issue: whether or not
it should be America's war. Anti
lloover Institution protesters jus
tify their cry with the fact that
seven Hoover Institution Fellows
sit on the Defense Policy Board.
However, using this data to ex
trapolate some shadow govern
ment conspiracy via the Hoover
Institution sounds a little crazy.
Just because University Presi
dent John I lennessy was willing to
meet with the anti-Iloover Institu
tion protesters a week and a half
ago should not give these students
hope that their dreams will ever
come true. Their demand is so
outrageous we can't believe Hen
nessy even dignified their request
fora meeting.
It stands to reason, then, that
the anti-Hoover Institution
protesters ought to make love, not
war, and here's why: As Hoover


Alexander Kendall & Elizabeth Madjlessi

himself stated, "The overall mis
sion of this institution is to recall
the voice of experience against the
making of war." Doesn't this dec
laration sound eerily familiar to
what the primary objective of the
SCPJ would be?
Can you guess whose overarch
ing purpose is "to convey to the
public, the media, lawmakers and
others an understanding of im
portant public policy issues and to
promote vigorous dialogue?"
The answer is the Hoover In
stitution, but doesn't it sound an
awful lot like what those opposing
the institution have been doing?
And really, what's the differ
ence between a group that wants
to limit government actions and
another one that wants to over
throw it altogether?
So it makes sense that since
anti-Hoover Institution protesters
and Hoover Institution Fellows
both dislike the government, they
should join together in the face of
their common enemy and unite
their efforts in the name of peace,
justice and the American way.

We were worried that
we would have trou
ble coming up with
topics we could both
agree on, especially if we ever
wanted to tackle politics. One of us
is the communications director for
the Stanford Democrats and the
other one is a Republican, plain
and simple. Miraculously enough,
we are both anti the anti-Hoover
Institution movement.
After reading this column, it will
be clear that members of the Stan
ford Coalition for Peace and Jus
tice should throw down their peti
tions (into recycling bins of course)
and lovingly embrace every
Hoover Institution Fellow they
see, as they would embrace a poor,
oppressed Iraqi child.
The anti-Hoover Institution
movement's only leg to stand on is
its assertion that the Hoover Insti
tution's hiring policy is not in line
with University requirements be
cause it allegedly promotes politi
cal bias. The thrust of the Hoover
Institution's political slant,
whether we are talking about its
mission statement or its hiring pol
icy, is a pro-limited government
stance. This statement should not
be confused with something to the
effect of "you must be to the right
of Hitler to set foot in the building"
or even, "you have to be a Repub
lican to work here."
The Hoover Institution admin
istrators understand this distinc
tion and have managed to diversi
fy the composition of their fellows:
25 percent of them are registered
Democrats.
The Hoover Institution does
not have control over its fellows'
political views or actions. Hoover
