Supporting both Israel and Palestine
Ever since posting a copy of the Stanford
Israel Alliance's petition outside my door,
half a dozen passers-by have asked to join
the list of signatories. Like the hundreds of
Stanford students who had already signed
the petition, they came from a variety of
ethnic and social backgrounds and, like the
others, they harbored differing political
views. As they were signing the petition, I
chatted with those students and despite
their differences, all six agree on one thing:
a two-state solution and an independent
Palestine.
These students recognized that declar
ing their support for Israel did not mean
withdrawing it from the Palestinian cause.
They recognized that Israel's existence as
a "Jewish state, and as a democracy within
safe and secure borders," as described on
the petition, did not preclude the exis
tence of a Palestinian state as safe, secure
and (hopefully) democratic as its neigh
bor. And, like Stanford students, the over
whelming majority of Israelis support a
two-state solution.
Similarly, one can actively support the

Palestinian cause without questioning Is
rael's right to exist. One can disagree with
many things Israel's government does
without believing that the nation should
be eradicated. I hope that, as a result of the
Stanford Israel Alliance's petition, more
pro-Palestinian campus activists will see
things this way.

Women's rights not protected in Israel
I would like to applaud Nael Fakhry
and Kareem Ghanem's guest column,
"Blind support for Israel contradicts
democratic values" (Feb. 21). It exposed
the true nature of Israel with high objec
tivity and accuracy. I would like to add an
other point to the column regarding the
presumed women's rights that are grant
ed in Israel. In Israel, many women, espe
cially from Eastern Europe, are treated as
commodities — bought and sold by pimps
and traffickers for thousands of dollars
and held in debt slavery just go to Google
and type "Israel," "slavery" and "prostitu
tion" and you will get numerous links to
reports about the status of women in Is
rael. I hope Avi Yotam and Morris Cohen,

who wrote the guest column, "Support
necessary for Israel; transcends faith, na
tionality," will base their next article on
compelling reasons rather than fanciful
imagination and empty slogans.

Israel 'doing a better job
supporting democracy'
The guest column "Blind support for
Israel contradicts democratic values,"
written by Nael Fakhry and Kareem
Ghanem, makes a number of solid points
about Israel's treatment of Arabs and
about the imbalance of U.S. financial sup
port for Israel when compared to our
other charitable givings. All the same, the
authors' own argument contradicts some
of their more sweeping claims.
Fakhry and Ghanem claim that "Israel
[is] not a true democracy" and that in"the
case of Israel or in the case of other corrupt
regimes like those of Egypt or Saudi Ara
bia, we have been willing to turn a blind eye
to anti-democratic governments."
However, almost all of the authors'
sources are actually Israeli. In making their
arguments, Fakhry and Ghanem cite the

Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, the
Israeli government's Kahan Commission
and The Israeli Committee Against I louse
Demolitions. If Fakhry and Ghanem can
produce any examples in which an Egyp
tian or Saudi governmental commission,
national newspaper or nonprofit group
has defended Israelis in a similar manner,
it would certainly bolster the equivalence
they draw between Israel on one hand and
Saudi Arabia and Egypt on the other — al
beit more by giving credit to the latter two
than "antidemocratic" tarnish to Israel.
If, on the other hand, Israel is a flawed
but fundamentally liberal and democratic
society — with institutions willing and free
to stand up for the interests of those whom
many perceive as enemies — then it cer
tainly seems to be doing a better job of sup
porting the noble principles of democracy
and freedom than anyone else in the area.

Arabs, Jews given equal
political rights in Israel
Nael Fakhry and Kareem Ghanem's
guest column, "Blind support Ibr Israel
contradicts democratic values" (Feb. 21),

was both inaccurate and disingenuous.
Their account of Israeli-Arabs being pre
vented from running for office and from
serving in the army is somewhat erroneous.
Israel's parliamentary government sys
tem gives an Arab a greater voice in Israel
than he or she would have in America's
electoral system. Having as little as 3 per
cent of the vote gives any party the right to
sit in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,
while in America any viable candidate for
office must belong to one ol the two main
parties. Several Arabs have served as mem
bers of the Knesset.
In Fakhry and Ghanem's guest col
umn, they wrote, after having researched
a Jan. 3 Jerusalem Post, that "the Israeli
government attempted to prevent two
Arab-Israeli citizens from running in the
most recent elections." What Fakhry and
Ghanem fail to convey, however, is that
the two citizens, Azmi Bishara and Ahmed
Tibi, were incumbent members of the
Knesset. The two were in court not be
cause they were Arabs, but because they
had been accused of supporting the Pales
tinian attacks in the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West
Hank and Gaza Strip. They were accused
of violating Israel's incitement law,
which stipulates that a Knesset
member may not engage in incite
ment against the state of Israel or
publicly deny its right to exist as a
democratic state.
This law applies equally to Jews
and Arabs. Although both Tibi and
Bishara had publicly praised Is
rael's enemies and had even made
a public appearance with the
Hezbolla terrorist group, the court
ruled that both were eligible to run
for office. In the end, when elec
tions were held, both Tibi and
Bishara won seats in the Knesset.
Israel, like any democracy (in
cluding our own), is not perfect.
Minorities in Israel sometimes
face discrimination, much as they
do in this country. But Israel main
tains an utmost commitment to
democracy and human rights,
even at a cost to its own security,
and it does so in the face of a brutal
and unrelenting assault by its sur
rounding neighbors that daily call
for its destruction. I could only
wish that more countries in the
world were just a little like Israel.

'Racism remains a huge part of
life in the United States'
I am writing to express my ap
preciation for University President
John Hennessy's statement in sup
port of affirmative action in light of
the fact that the University of
Michigan's admissions policies,
which take into consideration race
and ethnicity, will be reviewed by
the U.S. Supreme Court. Judging
prospective students according to
the same yardstick — one that
privileges those already privileged
by accident of birth — maintains
inequality, even if the intention is
to overcome it.
When it is the subject of news
programming or special docu
mentaries, racism is all too often
portrayed as a problem of retro
spection, consigned to a distant
past disconnected from the pre
sent — as if we had passed
through and beyond the racist
phase of U.S. history.
Yet, as last week's excellent
forum on affirmative action
(part of the National Civic En
gagement Week programming)
demonstrated, racism remains a
huge part of life in the United
States. By attaching Stanford's
name to the defense of policies
protecting and promoting in
clusion and diversity on univer

honored the Stanford commu
nity and others around the

country in the struggle for so

Study on grade inflation based
on dubious data
While universities across the na
tion, including Stanford, may be
experiencing grade inflation, a
brief examination of Duke Prof.
Stuart Rojstaczer's study, featured
in "Study focuses on grade infla
tion" (Feb. 19), reveals serious
doubts about the data used in the
study. The article mentions that,
according to Rojstaczer's study,
Stanford students' average grade
point averages was 3.04 in 1968
and rose to 3.44 by 1992.
Our first point is that it is mis
leading to suggest that there was a
steady trend upward in GPAs. A
visit to Rojstaczer's Web site listed
in the article reveals that the aver
age GPA at Stanford was 3.04 in
1908 but jumped to 3.43 in
1972 — nearly half a grade point
in just five years. While the aver
age GPA fluctuated within a nar
row band from 1972 to 1992,
these trends hardly support a
claim of grade inflation; from
1972 to 1992, grades stayed virtu
ally flat. A better question to ask
might be: "What happened in
1972?"

Our second and more impor
tant point is that the numbers
themselves are highly suspect.
Curious about how such a large
jump might have occurred be
tween 1068 and 1972, we exam
ined the original Stanford data
listed on Rojstaczer's Web site.
We found that the original source
document listed grades for both
graduate and undergraduate
courses. Since grades in graduate
classes tend to be higher than
those in undergraduate classes,
we suspected that this might have
caused a bias in the results.
Through e-mail correspondence
with Rojstaczer, we established
that: 1. Despite claims on his Web
site that his results only include
undergraduate classes, the num
bers for Stanford include gradu
ate classes and 2. He seems to
have, if not deliberately, grossly
misread what is a very simple
table.
Although anybody can make
careless mistakes, we believe this
revelation raises troubling ques
tions about the objectivity of this
study. At a minimum, the numbers
provided by Rojstaczer about Stan
ford and reported in The Daily are
highly misleading. An artificially
inflated average GPA figure will
hurt Stanford undergraduates by
diminishing the value of their
hard-won grades.
We hope that Rojstaczer will be
more cautious in the future. While

it may be important to combat
grade inflation, it is even more cru
cial to ensure accuracy and fairness
in the presentation of such conse
quential data.

Anti-Bush graffiti undermine
efforts to enact policy changes
I would like to address this let
ter to the people responsible for
painting anti-Bush graffiti on
many of the stop signs across cam
pus last weekend:
While many of the policies of
the Bush administration leave a lot
to be desired, your illegal actions
have only succeeded in undermin
ing and discrediting those of us
who are legitimately seeking to
enact policy changes.
There is a difference between
"getting the word out" and simple
defacement of public property.
What you did was the latter. By
forcing this university to divert
valuable funds to graffiti removal,
the only message you are sending
out is that there are members of
the left unwilling or unable to be
have like civilized adults.

Our first point is that it is mis

in just five years. While the aver

these trends hardly support a

1972 to 1992, grades stayed virtu

1972?"

Our second and more impor

themselves are highly suspect.
Curious about how such a large
jump might have occurred be
tween 1068 and 1972, we exam
ined the original Stanford data
listed on Rojstaczer's Web site.
We found that the original source
document listed grades for both
graduate and undergraduate
courses. Since grades in graduate
classes tend to be higher than
those in undergraduate classes,
we suspected that this might have
caused a bias in the results.
Through e-mail correspondence
with Rojstaczer, we established
that: 1. Despite claims on his Web
site that his results only include
undergraduate classes, the num

ate classes and 2. He seems to
have, if not deliberately, grossly
misread what is a very simple
table.
Although anybody can make
careless mistakes, we believe this
revelation raises troubling ques

study. At a minimum, the numbers
provided by Rojstaczer about Stan
ford and reported in The Daily are
highly misleading. An artificially
inflated average GPA figure will
hurt Stanford undergraduates by
diminishing the value of their
hard-won grades.
We hope that Rojstaczer will be
more cautious in the future. While

it may be important to combat
grade inflation, it is even more cru

Anti-Bush graffiti undermine
efforts to enact policy changes
I would like to address this let
ter to the people responsible for
painting anti-Bush graffiti on
many of the stop signs across cam
pus last weekend:
While many of the policies of
the Bush administration leave a lot
to be desired, your illegal actions
have only succeeded in undermin
ing and discrediting those of us
who are legitimately seeking to
enact policy changes.
There is a difference between
"getting the word out" and simple
defacement of public property.
What you did was the latter. By
forcing this university to divert
valuable funds to graffiti removal,
the only message you are sending
out is that there are members of
the left unwilling or unable to be

Supporting both Israel and Palestine
Ever since posting a copy of the Stanford
Israel Alliance's petition outside my door,
half a dozen passers-by have asked to join
the list of signatories. Like the hundreds of
Stanford students who had already signed
the petition, they came from a variety of
ethnic and social backgrounds and, like the
others, they harbored differing political
views. As they were signing the petition, I
chatted with those students and despite
their differences, all six agree on one thing:
a two-state solution and an independent
Palestine.
These students recognized that declar
ing their support for Israel did not mean
withdrawing it from the Palestinian cause.
They recognized that Israel's existence as
a "Jewish state, and as a democracy within
safe and secure borders," as described on
the petition, did not preclude the exis
tence of a Palestinian state as safe, secure
and (hopefully) democratic as its neigh
bor. And, like Stanford students, the over
whelming majority of Israelis support a
two-state solution.
Similarly, one can actively support the

Palestinian cause without questioning Is
rael's right to exist. One can disagree with
many things Israel's government does
without believing that the nation should
be eradicated. I hope that, as a result of the
Stanford Israel Alliance's petition, more
pro-Palestinian campus activists will see

Women's rights not protected in Israel
I would like to applaud Nael Fakhry

the true nature of Israel with high objec

other point to the column regarding the
presumed women's rights that are grant

cially from Eastern Europe, are treated as
commodities — bought and sold by pimps
and traffickers for thousands of dollars
and held in debt slavery just go to Google
and type "Israel," "slavery" and "prostitu

Israel 'doing a better job
supporting democracy'
The guest column "Blind support for
Israel contradicts democratic values,"
written by Nael Fakhry and Kareem
Ghanem, makes a number of solid points
about Israel's treatment of Arabs and
about the imbalance of U.S. financial sup
port for Israel when compared to our
other charitable givings. All the same, the
authors' own argument contradicts some
of their more sweeping claims.
Fakhry and Ghanem claim that "Israel
[is] not a true democracy" and that in"the
case of Israel or in the case of other corrupt
regimes like those of Egypt or Saudi Ara
bia, we have been willing to turn a blind eye
to anti-democratic governments."
However, almost all of the authors'
sources are actually Israeli. In making their
arguments, Fakhry and Ghanem cite the

Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, the
Israeli government's Kahan Commission
and The Israeli Committee Against I louse
Demolitions. If Fakhry and Ghanem can
produce any examples in which an Egyp
tian or Saudi governmental commission,
national newspaper or nonprofit group
has defended Israelis in a similar manner,
it would certainly bolster the equivalence
they draw between Israel on one hand and
Saudi Arabia and Egypt on the other — al
beit more by giving credit to the latter two
than "antidemocratic" tarnish to Israel.
If, on the other hand, Israel is a flawed
but fundamentally liberal and democratic
society — with institutions willing and free
to stand up for the interests of those whom
many perceive as enemies — then it cer
tainly seems to be doing a better job of sup
porting the noble principles of democracy
and freedom than anyone else in the area.

Arabs, Jews given equal
political rights in Israel
Nael Fakhry and Kareem Ghanem's
guest column, "Blind support Ibr Israel
contradicts democratic values" (Feb. 21),

was both inaccurate and disingenuous.
Their account of Israeli-Arabs being pre
vented from running for office and from
serving in the army is somewhat erroneous.
Israel's parliamentary government sys
tem gives an Arab a greater voice in Israel
than he or she would have in America's
electoral system. Having as little as 3 per
cent of the vote gives any party the right to
sit in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,
while in America any viable candidate for
office must belong to one ol the two main
parties. Several Arabs have served as mem
bers of the Knesset.
In Fakhry and Ghanem's guest col
umn, they wrote, after having researched
a Jan. 3 Jerusalem Post, that "the Israeli
government attempted to prevent two
Arab-Israeli citizens from running in the
most recent elections." What Fakhry and
Ghanem fail to convey, however, is that
the two citizens, Azmi Bishara and Ahmed
Tibi, were incumbent members of the
Knesset. The two were in court not be
cause they were Arabs, but because they
had been accused of supporting the Pales
tinian attacks in the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West
Hank and Gaza Strip. They were accused
of violating Israel's incitement law,
which stipulates that a Knesset
member may not engage in incite
ment against the state of Israel or
publicly deny its right to exist as a
democratic state.
This law applies equally to Jews
and Arabs. Although both Tibi and
Bishara had publicly praised Is
rael's enemies and had even made
a public appearance with the
Hezbolla terrorist group, the court
ruled that both were eligible to run
for office. In the end, when elec
tions were held, both Tibi and
Bishara won seats in the Knesset.
Israel, like any democracy (in
cluding our own), is not perfect.
Minorities in Israel sometimes
face discrimination, much as they
do in this country. But Israel main
tains an utmost commitment to
democracy and human rights,
even at a cost to its own security,
and it does so in the face of a brutal
and unrelenting assault by its sur
rounding neighbors that daily call
for its destruction. I could only
wish that more countries in the
world were just a little like Israel.

'Racism remains a huge part of
life in the United States'
I am writing to express my ap
preciation for University President
John Hennessy's statement in sup
port of affirmative action in light of
the fact that the University of
Michigan's admissions policies,
which take into consideration race
and ethnicity, will be reviewed by
the U.S. Supreme Court. Judging
prospective students according to
the same yardstick — one that
privileges those already privileged
by accident of birth — maintains
inequality, even if the intention is
to overcome it.
When it is the subject of news
programming or special docu
mentaries, racism is all too often
portrayed as a problem of retro
spection, consigned to a distant
past disconnected from the pre
sent — as if we had passed
through and beyond the racist
phase of U.S. history.
Yet, as last week's excellent
forum on affirmative action
(part of the National Civic En
gagement Week programming)
demonstrated, racism remains a
huge part of life in the United
States. By attaching Stanford's
name to the defense of policies
protecting and promoting in
clusion and diversity on univer

honored the Stanford commu
nity and others around the

country in the struggle for so

Knesset. The two were in court not be
cause they were Arabs, but because they
had been accused of supporting the Pales
tinian attacks in the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West
Hank and Gaza Strip. They were accused
of violating Israel's incitement law,
which stipulates that a Knesset
member may not engage in incite
ment against the state of Israel or
publicly deny its right to exist as a
democratic state.
This law applies equally to Jews
and Arabs. Although both Tibi and
Bishara had publicly praised Is
rael's enemies and had even made
a public appearance with the
Hezbolla terrorist group, the court
ruled that both were eligible to run
for office. In the end, when elec
tions were held, both Tibi and
Bishara won seats in the Knesset.
Israel, like any democracy (in
cluding our own), is not perfect.
Minorities in Israel sometimes
face discrimination, much as they
do in this country. But Israel main
tains an utmost commitment to
democracy and human rights,
even at a cost to its own security,
and it does so in the face of a brutal
and unrelenting assault by its sur
rounding neighbors that daily call
for its destruction. I could only
wish that more countries in the
world were just a little like Israel.

'Racism remains a huge part of
life in the United States'
I am writing to express my ap
preciation for University President
John Hennessy's statement in sup
port of affirmative action in light of
the fact that the University of
Michigan's admissions policies,
which take into consideration race
and ethnicity, will be reviewed by
the U.S. Supreme Court. Judging
prospective students according to
the same yardstick — one that
privileges those already privileged
by accident of birth — maintains
inequality, even if the intention is
to overcome it.
When it is the subject of news
programming or special docu
mentaries, racism is all too often
portrayed as a problem of retro
spection, consigned to a distant
past disconnected from the pre
sent — as if we had passed
through and beyond the racist
phase of U.S. history.
Yet, as last week's excellent
forum on affirmative action
(part of the National Civic En
gagement Week programming)
demonstrated, racism remains a
huge part of life in the United
States. By attaching Stanford's
name to the defense of policies
protecting and promoting in
clusion and diversity on univer
sity campuses, Hennessy has
honored the Stanford commu
nity and others around the

country in the struggle for so
cial justice.

Study on grade inflation based
on dubious data
While universities across the na
tion, including Stanford, may be
experiencing grade inflation, a
brief examination of Duke Prof.
Stuart Rojstaczer's study, featured
in "Study focuses on grade infla
tion" (Feb. 19), reveals serious
doubts about the data used in the
study. The article mentions that,
according to Rojstaczer's study,
Stanford students' average grade
point averages was 3.04 in 1968
and rose to 3.44 by 1992.
Our first point is that it is mis
leading to suggest that there was a
steady trend upward in GPAs. A
visit to Rojstaczer's Web site listed
in the article reveals that the aver
age GPA at Stanford was 3.04 in
1908 but jumped to 3.43 in
1972 — nearly half a grade point
in just five years. While the aver
age GPA fluctuated within a nar
row band from 1972 to 1992,
these trends hardly support a
claim of grade inflation; from
1972 to 1992, grades stayed virtu
ally flat. A better question to ask
might be: "What happened in
1972?"

Our second and more impor
tant point is that the numbers
themselves are highly suspect.
Curious about how such a large
jump might have occurred be
tween 1068 and 1972, we exam
ined the original Stanford data
listed on Rojstaczer's Web site.
We found that the original source
document listed grades for both
graduate and undergraduate
courses. Since grades in graduate
classes tend to be higher than
those in undergraduate classes,
we suspected that this might have
caused a bias in the results.
Through e-mail correspondence
with Rojstaczer, we established
that: 1. Despite claims on his Web
site that his results only include
undergraduate classes, the num
bers for Stanford include gradu
ate classes and 2. He seems to
have, if not deliberately, grossly
misread what is a very simple
table.
Although anybody can make
careless mistakes, we believe this
revelation raises troubling ques
tions about the objectivity of this
study. At a minimum, the numbers
provided by Rojstaczer about Stan
ford and reported in The Daily are
highly misleading. An artificially
inflated average GPA figure will
hurt Stanford undergraduates by
diminishing the value of their
hard-won grades.
We hope that Rojstaczer will be
more cautious in the future. While

it may be important to combat
grade inflation, it is even more cru
cial to ensure accuracy and fairness
in the presentation of such conse
quential data.

Anti-Bush graffiti undermine
efforts to enact policy changes
I would like to address this let
ter to the people responsible for
painting anti-Bush graffiti on
many of the stop signs across cam
pus last weekend:
While many of the policies of
the Bush administration leave a lot
to be desired, your illegal actions
have only succeeded in undermin
ing and discrediting those of us
who are legitimately seeking to
enact policy changes.
There is a difference between
"getting the word out" and simple
defacement of public property.
What you did was the latter. By
forcing this university to divert
valuable funds to graffiti removal,
the only message you are sending
out is that there are members of
the left unwilling or unable to be
have like civilized adults.

Supporting both Israel and Palestine
Ever since posting a copy of the Stanford
Israel Alliance's petition outside my door,
half a dozen passers-by have asked to join
the list of signatories. Like the hundreds of
Stanford students who had already signed
the petition, they came from a variety of
ethnic and social backgrounds and, like the
others, they harbored differing political
views. As they were signing the petition, I
chatted with those students and despite
their differences, all six agree on one thing:
a two-state solution and an independent
Palestine.
These students recognized that declar
ing their support for Israel did not mean
withdrawing it from the Palestinian cause.
They recognized that Israel's existence as
a "Jewish state, and as a democracy within
safe and secure borders," as described on
the petition, did not preclude the exis
tence of a Palestinian state as safe, secure
and (hopefully) democratic as its neigh
bor. And, like Stanford students, the over
whelming majority of Israelis support a
two-state solution.
Similarly, one can actively support the

Palestinian cause without questioning Is
rael's right to exist. One can disagree with
many things Israel's government does
without believing that the nation should
be eradicated. I hope that, as a result of the
Stanford Israel Alliance's petition, more
pro-Palestinian campus activists will see
things this way.

Women's rights not protected in Israel
I would like to applaud Nael Fakhry
and Kareem Ghanem's guest column,
"Blind support for Israel contradicts
democratic values" (Feb. 21). It exposed
the true nature of Israel with high objec
tivity and accuracy. I would like to add an
other point to the column regarding the
presumed women's rights that are grant
ed in Israel. In Israel, many women, espe
cially from Eastern Europe, are treated as
commodities — bought and sold by pimps
and traffickers for thousands of dollars
and held in debt slavery just go to Google
and type "Israel," "slavery" and "prostitu
tion" and you will get numerous links to
reports about the status of women in Is
rael. I hope Avi Yotam and Morris Cohen,

who wrote the guest column, "Support
necessary for Israel; transcends faith, na
tionality," will base their next article on
compelling reasons rather than fanciful
imagination and empty slogans.

Israel 'doing a better job
supporting democracy'
The guest column "Blind support for
Israel contradicts democratic values,"
written by Nael Fakhry and Kareem
Ghanem, makes a number of solid points
about Israel's treatment of Arabs and
about the imbalance of U.S. financial sup
port for Israel when compared to our
other charitable givings. All the same, the
authors' own argument contradicts some
of their more sweeping claims.
Fakhry and Ghanem claim that "Israel
[is] not a true democracy" and that in"the
case of Israel or in the case of other corrupt
regimes like those of Egypt or Saudi Ara
bia, we have been willing to turn a blind eye
to anti-democratic governments."
However, almost all of the authors'
sources are actually Israeli. In making their
arguments, Fakhry and Ghanem cite the

Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, the
Israeli government's Kahan Commission
and The Israeli Committee Against I louse
Demolitions. If Fakhry and Ghanem can
produce any examples in which an Egyp
tian or Saudi governmental commission,
national newspaper or nonprofit group
has defended Israelis in a similar manner,
it would certainly bolster the equivalence
they draw between Israel on one hand and
Saudi Arabia and Egypt on the other — al
beit more by giving credit to the latter two
than "antidemocratic" tarnish to Israel.
If, on the other hand, Israel is a flawed
but fundamentally liberal and democratic
society — with institutions willing and free
to stand up for the interests of those whom
many perceive as enemies — then it cer
tainly seems to be doing a better job of sup
porting the noble principles of democracy
and freedom than anyone else in the area.

Arabs, Jews given equal
political rights in Israel
Nael Fakhry and Kareem Ghanem's
guest column, "Blind support Ibr Israel
contradicts democratic values" (Feb. 21),

was both inaccurate and disingenuous.
Their account of Israeli-Arabs being pre
vented from running for office and from
serving in the army is somewhat erroneous.
Israel's parliamentary government sys
tem gives an Arab a greater voice in Israel
than he or she would have in America's
electoral system. Having as little as 3 per
cent of the vote gives any party the right to
sit in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,
while in America any viable candidate for
office must belong to one ol the two main
parties. Several Arabs have served as mem
bers of the Knesset.
In Fakhry and Ghanem's guest col
umn, they wrote, after having researched
a Jan. 3 Jerusalem Post, that "the Israeli
government attempted to prevent two
Arab-Israeli citizens from running in the
most recent elections." What Fakhry and
Ghanem fail to convey, however, is that
the two citizens, Azmi Bishara and Ahmed
Tibi, were incumbent members of the
Knesset. The two were in court not be
cause they were Arabs, but because they
had been accused of supporting the Pales
tinian attacks in the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West
Hank and Gaza Strip. They were accused
of violating Israel's incitement law,
which stipulates that a Knesset
member may not engage in incite
ment against the state of Israel or
publicly deny its right to exist as a
democratic state.
This law applies equally to Jews

a public appearance with the
Hezbolla terrorist group, the court
ruled that both were eligible to run
for office. In the end, when elec
tions were held, both Tibi and
Bishara won seats in the Knesset.
