Supporting both Israel and Palestine
Ever since posting a copy of the Stanford
Israel Alliance's petition outside my door,
half a dozen passers-by have asked to join
the list of signatories. Like the hundreds of
Stanford students who had already signed
the petition, they came from a variety of
ethnic and social backgrounds and, like the
others, they harbored differing political
views. As they were signing the petition, I
chatted with those students and despite
their differences, all six agree on one thing:
a two-state solution and an independent
Palestine.
These students recognized that declar
ing their support for Israel did not mean
withdrawing it from the Palestinian cause.
They recognized that Israel's existence as
a "Jewish state, and as a democracy within
safe and secure borders," as described on
the petition, did not preclude the exis
tence of a Palestinian state as safe, secure
and (hopefully) democratic as its neigh
bor. And, like Stanford students, the over
whelming majority of Israelis support a
two-state solution.
Similarly, one can actively support the

Palestinian cause without questioning Is
rael's right to exist. One can disagree with
many things Israel's government does
without believing that the nation should
be eradicated. I hope that, as a result of the
Stanford Israel Alliance's petition, more
pro-Palestinian campus activists will see
things this way.

Women's rights not protected in Israel
I would like to applaud Nael Fakhry
and Kareem Ghanem's guest column,
"Blind support for Israel contradicts
democratic values" (Feb. 21). It exposed
the true nature of Israel with high objec
tivity and accuracy. I would like to add an
other point to the column regarding the
presumed women's rights that are grant
ed in Israel. In Israel, many women, espe
cially from Eastern Europe, are treated as
commodities — bought and sold by pimps
and traffickers for thousands of dollars
and held in debt slavery just go to Google
and type "Israel," "slavery" and "prostitu
tion" and you will get numerous links to
reports about the status of women in Is
rael. I hope Avi Yotam and Morris Cohen,

who wrote the guest column, "Support
necessary for Israel; transcends faith, na
tionality," will base their next article on
compelling reasons rather than fanciful
imagination and empty slogans.

Israel 'doing a better job
supporting democracy'
The guest column "Blind support for
Israel contradicts democratic values,"
written by Nael Fakhry and Kareem
Ghanem, makes a number of solid points
about Israel's treatment of Arabs and
about the imbalance of U.S. financial sup
port for Israel when compared to our
other charitable givings. All the same, the
authors' own argument contradicts some
of their more sweeping claims.
Fakhry and Ghanem claim that "Israel
[is] not a true democracy" and that in"the
case of Israel or in the case of other corrupt
regimes like those of Egypt or Saudi Ara
bia, we have been willing to turn a blind eye
to anti-democratic governments."
However, almost all of the authors'
sources are actually Israeli. In making their
arguments, Fakhry and Ghanem cite the

Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, the
Israeli government's Kahan Commission
and The Israeli Committee Against I louse
Demolitions. If Fakhry and Ghanem can
produce any examples in which an Egyp
tian or Saudi governmental commission,
national newspaper or nonprofit group
has defended Israelis in a similar manner,
it would certainly bolster the equivalence
they draw between Israel on one hand and
Saudi Arabia and Egypt on the other — al
beit more by giving credit to the latter two
than "antidemocratic" tarnish to Israel.
If, on the other hand, Israel is a flawed
but fundamentally liberal and democratic
society — with institutions willing and free
to stand up for the interests of those whom
many perceive as enemies — then it cer
tainly seems to be doing a better job of sup
porting the noble principles of democracy
and freedom than anyone else in the area.

Arabs, Jews given equal
political rights in Israel
Nael Fakhry and Kareem Ghanem's
guest column, "Blind support Ibr Israel
contradicts democratic values" (Feb. 21),

was both inaccurate and disingenuous.
Their account of Israeli-Arabs being pre
vented from running for office and from
serving in the army is somewhat erroneous.
Israel's parliamentary government sys
tem gives an Arab a greater voice in Israel
than he or she would have in America's
electoral system. Having as little as 3 per
cent of the vote gives any party the right to
sit in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament,
while in America any viable candidate for
office must belong to one ol the two main
parties. Several Arabs have served as mem
bers of the Knesset.
In Fakhry and Ghanem's guest col
umn, they wrote, after having researched
a Jan. 3 Jerusalem Post, that "the Israeli
government attempted to prevent two
Arab-Israeli citizens from running in the
most recent elections." What Fakhry and
Ghanem fail to convey, however, is that
the two citizens, Azmi Bishara and Ahmed
Tibi, were incumbent members of the
Knesset. The two were in court not be
cause they were Arabs, but because they
had been accused of supporting the Pales
tinian attacks in the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West
Hank and Gaza Strip. They were accused
