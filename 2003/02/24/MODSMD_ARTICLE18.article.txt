Saturday: Stanford 79, UCLA 61
at Arizona, Thursday, 6 p.m.

ference regular season champions,
after Saturday's 79-61 victory over
UCLA.
Three months ago, junior
Nicole Powell's season was in jeop
ardy due to a back injur)', and nei
ther Susan King and Chelsea Trot
ter had played in more than a year.
Adversity only makes success
sweeter.
"It was great for our team to win
the Pac-10 regular season champi
onship at home and give our fans
something to celebrate," Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal has its eye on a
bigger prize, though.
"It's not the same as a regional
championship or a national cham

pionship, but you have to win your
conference to get where you want
to go," Powell said.
In the first meeting of the sea
son between the two teams, Powell
hit the game-winning bucket in the
final seconds to give Stanford an
80-78 win over the Bruins in Los
Angeles. On Saturday, the Cardi
nal never trailed and built up a 20-
point first-half lead.
In contrast to Thursday's game
against Southern California, in
which the Cardinal trailed by as
many as 15 points in the first half,
Stanford began this game with a
23-6 run in the first 10 minutes.
"I thought we started well,"
VanDerveer said. "Azella [Perry
man] in particular really gave us a
great boost in the first half. She
came in and did a great job for us."
VanDerveer started Trotter,
who has been solid all season, in
place of Perryman.
When asked about the lineup
change, VanDerveer responded,
"In a lot of ways Azella is a fresh
man, because she didn't play really
at all last year. She was playing a bit
inconsistently. Chelsea is playing
more consistently, and Chelsea

gives us our best low-post presence.
It lit a lire under Azella, which I
think is good."
Perryman answered with eight
points, all in the first half.
UCLA opened the game play
ing zone defense — not a good
strategy against a team that shoots
and rebounds as well as the Cardi
nal does. Stanford quickly adjust
ed to the zone by attacking the
middle, kicking the ball out to
open shooters and crashing the of
fensive glass. As a result, the Cardi
nal shot 54.4 percent in the first
half and out-rebounded the Bru
ins 40-27 on the game.
Sophomore Kelley Suminski hit
two 3-pointers early and took the
ball to the basket more than she
has all season. She finished the
game with 20 points.
After a mid-season slump in
January, Suminski is hitting her
stride at the right time. She scored
just 6.5 points per game in the
month of January, but has aver
aged 15 points in the last six
games.
