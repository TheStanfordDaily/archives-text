ference regular season champions,
after Saturday's 79-61 victory over
UCLA.
Three months ago, junior
Nicole Powell's season was in jeop
ardy due to a back injur)', and nei
ther Susan King and Chelsea Trot
ter had played in more than a year.
Adversity only makes success
sweeter.
"It was great for our team to win
the Pac-10 regular season champi
onship at home and give our fans
something to celebrate," Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal has its eye on a
bigger prize, though.
"It's not the same as a regional
championship or a national cham

pionship, but you have to win your
conference to get where you want
to go," Powell said.
In the first meeting of the sea
son between the two teams, Powell
hit the game-winning bucket in the
final seconds to give Stanford an
80-78 win over the Bruins in Los
Angeles. On Saturday, the Cardi
nal never trailed and built up a 20-
point first-half lead.
In contrast to Thursday's game
against Southern California, in
which the Cardinal trailed by as
many as 15 points in the first half,
Stanford began this game with a
23-6 run in the first 10 minutes.
"I thought we started well,"
VanDerveer said. "Azella [Perry
man] in particular really gave us a
great boost in the first half. She
came in and did a great job for us."
VanDerveer started Trotter,
who has been solid all season, in
place of Perryman.
When asked about the lineup
change, VanDerveer responded,
"In a lot of ways Azella is a fresh
man, because she didn't play really
at all last year. She was playing a bit
inconsistently. Chelsea is playing
more consistently, and Chelsea

gives us our best low-post presence.
It lit a lire under Azella, which I
think is good."
Perryman answered with eight
points, all in the first half.
UCLA opened the game play
ing zone defense — not a good
strategy against a team that shoots
and rebounds as well as the Cardi
nal does. Stanford quickly adjust
ed to the zone by attacking the
middle, kicking the ball out to
open shooters and crashing the of
fensive glass. As a result, the Cardi
nal shot 54.4 percent in the first
half and out-rebounded the Bru
ins 40-27 on the game.
Sophomore Kelley Suminski hit
two 3-pointers early and took the
ball to the basket more than she
has all season. She finished the
game with 20 points.
After a mid-season slump in
January, Suminski is hitting her
stride at the right time. She scored
just 6.5 points per game in the
month of January, but has aver
aged 15 points in the last six
games.

her teammates, especially All-
American candidate Powell, who
finished the game with 24 points,
nine rebounds, five assists and
four steals in 39 minutes of play.
At one point in the first half,
Stanford made three straight 3-
pointers. On the following play,
freshman Krista Rappahahn was
fouled on a fourth 3-point attempt
and made three free throws. Just
as UCIA was gaining some offen
sive rhythm, the Cardinal scored
12 points in less than two minutes.
"They have a lot of weapons,
and they like to play at home," said
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier.
"They can rattle off a bunch of
points in two minutes."
UCLA's already-stagnant of
fense suffered further when explo
sive guard Nikki Blue was forced
to the bench after picking up her
second personal foul just eight
minutes into the game.
Sensing the game slipping
away, Olivier put Blue back in with
eight minutes left in the first half
and UCLA trailing 32-12.
Blue immediately hit a 3-point
er, and UCLA's offense finally
began to gain some momentum.
The Bruins scored 14 points in the
last six minutes of the first period
but still trailed 46-29 at halftime.
In the second half, UCLA
switched to an aggressive man-to
man defense, and it made all the dif
ference. fhe Cardinal scored only
six points in the first seven minutes
of the second half and allowed the
Bruins to whittle the deficit down to
six with eight minutes to play.

A McDonald's Ail-American
and top recruit out of high school
last year, Blue exhibited the
swagger to match her prodigious
talent and seemed to enjoy
putting on a show in front of the
biggest Maples crowd of the sea
son. She scored 23 points, pulled
down eight rebounds, dished out
four assists, stole the ball four
times and tried to show off her
leaping ability when the ball got
stuck between the rim and the
backboard.
However, when UCLAnarrowed
the deficit to six points, it was the
more experienced Powell who took
over. She scored 10 points in die last
eight minutes, including a spinning
drive through three defenders that
resulted in a three-point play and
put the game out of reach.
The Cardinal travels to Arizona
this week to take on No 25 Arizona

ference regular season champions,
after Saturday's 79-61 victory over
UCLA.
Three months ago, junior
Nicole Powell's season was in jeop
ardy due to a back injur)', and nei
ther Susan King and Chelsea Trot
ter had played in more than a year.
Adversity only makes success
sweeter.
"It was great for our team to win
the Pac-10 regular season champi
onship at home and give our fans
something to celebrate," Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal has its eye on a
bigger prize, though.
"It's not the same as a regional
championship or a national cham

pionship, but you have to win your
conference to get where you want
to go," Powell said.
In the first meeting of the sea
son between the two teams, Powell
hit the game-winning bucket in the
final seconds to give Stanford an
80-78 win over the Bruins in Los
Angeles. On Saturday, the Cardi
nal never trailed and built up a 20-
point first-half lead.
In contrast to Thursday's game
against Southern California, in
which the Cardinal trailed by as
many as 15 points in the first half,
Stanford began this game with a
23-6 run in the first 10 minutes.
"I thought we started well,"
VanDerveer said. "Azella [Perry
man] in particular really gave us a
great boost in the first half. She
came in and did a great job for us."
VanDerveer started Trotter,
who has been solid all season, in
place of Perryman.
When asked about the lineup
change, VanDerveer responded,
"In a lot of ways Azella is a fresh
man, because she didn't play really
at all last year. She was playing a bit
inconsistently. Chelsea is playing
more consistently, and Chelsea

gives us our best low-post presence.
It lit a lire under Azella, which I
think is good."
Perryman answered with eight
points, all in the first half.
UCLA opened the game play
ing zone defense — not a good
strategy against a team that shoots
and rebounds as well as the Cardi
nal does. Stanford quickly adjust
ed to the zone by attacking the
middle, kicking the ball out to
open shooters and crashing the of
fensive glass. As a result, the Cardi
nal shot 54.4 percent in the first
half and out-rebounded the Bru
ins 40-27 on the game.
Sophomore Kelley Suminski hit
two 3-pointers early and took the
ball to the basket more than she
has all season. She finished the
game with 20 points.
After a mid-season slump in
January, Suminski is hitting her
stride at the right time. She scored
just 6.5 points per game in the
month of January, but has aver
aged 15 points in the last six
games.
Suminski got a lot of help from

ular season championship with two games remaining on the schedule.
her teammates, especially All-
American candidate Powell, who
finished the game with 24 points,
nine rebounds, five assists and
four steals in 39 minutes of play.
At one point in the first half,
Stanford made three straight 3-
pointers. On the following play,
freshman Krista Rappahahn was
fouled on a fourth 3-point attempt
and made three free throws. Just
as UCIA was gaining some offen
sive rhythm, the Cardinal scored
12 points in less than two minutes.
"They have a lot of weapons,
and they like to play at home," said
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier.
"They can rattle off a bunch of
points in two minutes."
UCLA's already-stagnant of
fense suffered further when explo
sive guard Nikki Blue was forced
to the bench after picking up her
second personal foul just eight
minutes into the game.
Sensing the game slipping
away, Olivier put Blue back in with
eight minutes left in the first half
and UCLA trailing 32-12.
Blue immediately hit a 3-point
er, and UCLA's offense finally
began to gain some momentum.
The Bruins scored 14 points in the
last six minutes of the first period
but still trailed 46-29 at halftime.
In the second half, UCLA
switched to an aggressive man-to
man defense, and it made all the dif
ference. fhe Cardinal scored only
six points in the first seven minutes
of the second half and allowed the
Bruins to whittle the deficit down to
six with eight minutes to play.

A McDonald's Ail-American
and top recruit out of high school
last year, Blue exhibited the
swagger to match her prodigious
talent and seemed to enjoy
putting on a show in front of the
biggest Maples crowd of the sea
son. She scored 23 points, pulled
down eight rebounds, dished out
four assists, stole the ball four
times and tried to show off her
leaping ability when the ball got
stuck between the rim and the
backboard.
However, when UCLAnarrowed
the deficit to six points, it was the
more experienced Powell who took
over. She scored 10 points in die last
eight minutes, including a spinning
drive through three defenders that
resulted in a three-point play and
put the game out of reach.
The Cardinal travels to Arizona
this week to take on No 25 Arizona
and Arizona State.
