# Baseball takes two tough wins in Texas

Exorcising some demons from
Omaha, where Stanford's 2002
College World Series stint came to
an end at the hands of Texas, the
No. 10 Cardinal exited the Lone
Star State with a series win over
the No. 4 Longhorns.
Rain on Friday forced the

teams to play a Saturday double
header, which Stanford swept
with scores of 11-7 and 8-7.
"This was a big day for us," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess of
the Cardinal's two Saturday wins.
"We started to swing the bats bet
ter today than we have been earli
er this year."
In Saturday's first game, the
Cardinal offense hammered
Texas starter Danny Muegge for
four runs in the top of the first in
ning, providing an immediate
cushion for the Cardinal starter,
junior John Hudgins.
Hudgins delivered seven in
nings of solid work, allowing four
runs while striking out eight for
his diird win of the season.
While Hudgins held the Long
horn bats at bay, the Cardinal col
lected 17 hits, its highest tally so
far this season.
Many of Stanford's previous
games have been marked by of
fensive sluggishness, and lighting

up a quality team like Texas after
some early-season struggles was a
huge accomplishment that bodes
well for the rest of the year.
"It was really big for us to win
this doubleheader against a very
good team like Texas," junior
Carlos Quentin said. "We had a
little something to prove after
starting out a little slow this sea
son. We wanted to show that we
could play some top-notch base
ball."
To that end, Quentin certainly
did his part, going 5-for-6 and
belting three doubles in game
one.
Freshman John Mayberry, Jr.
had three hits of his own, includ
ing a triple, to extend his hitting
streak to seven games. Mayberry
has gotten a hit in all but one of the
Cardinal's 15 games this season.
Stanford senior Ryan McCally
started Saturday's second game
and with a 5-2 Cardinal lead in the
filth was replaced by freshman
lefty Mark Romancz.uk.
Despite giving up four inns in
three innings, Romanczuk
earned the win to move to 3-0 for
the season. Senior Ryan Garko
and juniors Quentin, Sam Fuld
and Brian Hall all had two-hit
games to lead the Stanford of
fense.
Freshman Matt Manship, a
San Antonio native, dealt one
and-two-thirds innings of score
less pitching in front of the home
state crowd to earn the save.
"This is a game I've been look
ing forward to," Manship said. "It
feels great to get a pair of wins in one
day against a great team."
All good things must come to an
end, and the Cardinal's high times
ceased on Sunday.
The Longhorns put up the same
score they had in the previous two
games, but this time their seven runs
were more than enough. The Car
dinal offense was able to cross the
plate only once in the 7-1 loss.
With the Cardinal's usual second
starter, senior Tim Cunningham,
out with injury, using McCally in
game two created a dilemma over
who would start Sunday's game.
Stanford junior Jonny Dyer — a
Texas native — took the loss in his
first collegiate start after allowing
two runs in three innings.
The Cardinal felt the effects of

Cunningham's absence, as none of
die five pitchers used in Sunday's
game were able to stop the Long
horns from scoring.
The Stanford offense on Sunday
was stronger than its one run would
indicate: The problem wasn't get
ting hits, but getting them at the
light times. The Cardinal had just
three fewer hits than Texas but
stranded eight runners.
"The difference in [Sunday's]
game was that Texas got the big hit
when they had runners on base, and
we didn't," Marquess said.
The Cardinal's six-game win
ning streak was snapped on Sun
day, but in the 38 meetings be
tween Stanford and Texas, the
Cardinal still maintains its slight
edge over the Longhorns with a
15-12-1 series record.
Next weekend marks the begin
ning of Pacific-10 Conference play,
as the Cardinal meets perennial
rival Southern California at
Sunken Diamond.
