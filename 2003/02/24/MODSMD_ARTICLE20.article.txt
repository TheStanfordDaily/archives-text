LOS ANGELES—Alter practice
at Pauley Pavilion on Friday after
noon, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery stood before his
team, huddled at center court.
With Cardinal alum Jarron Collins
sitting on the sidelines, in a pavilion
lined with 11 national champi
onship banners and on a court
where every scuff mark exists as a
little piece of basketball history,
Montgomery had his team's full at
tention.

vs. Arizona State, Thursday, 7 p.m.

"There's not a lot of teams left
that are still playing for some
thing," said Montgomery in an at
tempt to focus his team before Sat
urday afternoon's matchup against
a struggling UCLA team. "We
are."
And he couldn't be more right.
Because of the Cardinal's two
win weekend in Los Angeles, in
cluding Saturday's 93-84 victory
over the Bruins (and UCLA's
Thursday upset over California),
Stanford finds itself tied with Cal
(19-6, 12-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
in second place and two games be
hind No. 1 Arizona (21-2,13-1 Pac
10) heading into the Cardinal's
final full week of conference play.
"To come down to L.A. and
sweep and be in the position that
we're in is really a tribute to these
kids," Montgomery said.
This scenario, this last-minute
race for the Pac-10 title, is even
more interesting in light of the fact

that the Arizona schools are due to
visit the Bay Area this weekend,
and Cal, 12-0 at Haas Pavilion, still
must travel to Maples before the
regular season is over.
Like the Cardinal, the Bruins
(6-17, 3-11 Pac-10) had something
to play for. Although they're not
competing fora Pac-10 title, UCLA
is fighting for the eighth and final
spot in the Pac-10 tournament.
In other words, the game was
important for all involved and con
sequently the Bruins didn't make it
easy on Stanford.
The start of the game was very
similar to the two teams' last meet
ing a month ago. The Cardinal
opened in a 1-1-3 zone and the
Bruins opted to slow the game's
pace by running a "throw-away"
motion, designed to take seconds
oft'the shot clock.
However, UCLA's offensive
game plan failed to produce early,
as Stanford opened the game on an
11-2 run, which included two back
to-back 3-pointers from junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich.
Lottich, who scored nine first
half points on 3-of-3 shooting from
behind the arc, was sidelined with
nine minutes left to play when he
cut his lip in a collision with a Bruin
and was forced to leave the game.
Four stitches were needed at half
time to stop the bleeding.
Lottich's exit signaled the Bru
ins' offensive revival. UCLA quickly
closed a deficit that was once as big
as 16 points to finish the half on a
14-5 run, bringing the score to 44-
39 in favor of the Cardinal.

a better first-half shooting perfor

mance. The Cardinal shot 64 per
cent from the field and went 6-for
-9 from behind the 3-point arc —
making the meager five-point half
time lead seem even more surpris
ing.
"We had to score a lot of points
because we had trouble defend
ing," Montgomery said. "We could
not get them stopped."
In the second half, the pace re
mained up-tempo. Out of the locker
room, UCLA senior shooting guard
Jason Kapono hit two consecutive
three-pointers to put the Bruins up
by one, 45-44. Stanford sophomore
Josh Childress answered with a two
point field goal, setting in motion a
9-0 Cardinal run.
Every time Stanford seemed to
pull away, however, the Bruins
calmly answered, keeping the
game within striking distance at all
times and making fora tension
filled ending.
UCLA's poise garnered praise
from Montgomery and his team.
"I actually feel like UCIA has a
chance to win the Pac-10 tourna
ment," Montgomery said. "What
ever turmoil they've had to deal
with I think they've put behind
them. I think they're playing with
confidence. There's not a lot for
them to lose."
With nine minutes left to play,
UCIA forward Andre Patterson
tied the game at 63-63 with a slam
dunk. Senior point guard Julius
Barnes was then fouled by Ryan
Walcott and hit two free throws to
put Stanford back in the lead.
The Cardinal continued the

trend of remaining poised down
the stretch, going 17-for-18 from
the charity stripe. Moreover,
Barnes turned in, arguably, his best
all-around performance to date.
Playing in front of his friends and
family, the senior point guard
scored a game-high 27 points and
dished out seven assists to complete
his career 4-0 at Pauley Pavilion.
With 44 seconds left, Stanford
still hadn't put the game away. Ray
Young hit a deep 3-pointer from
the top of the key to move the Bru
ins back within four, 88-84. The
basket would be UCLA's last, how
ever, as Barnes went 4-for-4 from
the free-throw line to seal the game
and his place amongst other Stan
ford notables.
"To be able to go undefeated at
Pauley throughout my career is
something 1 wanted," Barnes said.
"People like Mike [McDonald], Jar
ron, Jason [Collins], Tony [Giovac
chini], they had achieved that feat. I
wanted to be up there with them."

LOS ANGELES—Alter practice
at Pauley Pavilion on Friday after
noon, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery stood before his
team, huddled at center court.
With Cardinal alum Jarron Collins
sitting on the sidelines, in a pavilion
lined with 11 national champi
onship banners and on a court
where every scuff mark exists as a
little piece of basketball history,
Montgomery had his team's full at
tention.

Men's Basketball
Saturday: Stanford 93, UCLA 84
vs. Arizona State, Thursday, 7 p.m.

"There's not a lot of teams left
that are still playing for some
thing," said Montgomery in an at
tempt to focus his team before Sat
urday afternoon's matchup against
a struggling UCLA team. "We
are."
And he couldn't be more right.
Because of the Cardinal's two
win weekend in Los Angeles, in
cluding Saturday's 93-84 victory
over the Bruins (and UCLA's
Thursday upset over California),
Stanford finds itself tied with Cal
(19-6, 12-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
in second place and two games be
hind No. 1 Arizona (21-2,13-1 Pac
10) heading into the Cardinal's
final full week of conference play.
"To come down to L.A. and
sweep and be in the position that
we're in is really a tribute to these
kids," Montgomery said.
This scenario, this last-minute
race for the Pac-10 title, is even
more interesting in light of the fact

that the Arizona schools are due to
visit the Bay Area this weekend,
and Cal, 12-0 at Haas Pavilion, still
must travel to Maples before the
regular season is over.
Like the Cardinal, the Bruins
(6-17, 3-11 Pac-10) had something
to play for. Although they're not
competing fora Pac-10 title, UCLA
is fighting for the eighth and final
spot in the Pac-10 tournament.
In other words, the game was
important for all involved and con
sequently the Bruins didn't make it
easy on Stanford.
The start of the game was very
similar to the two teams' last meet
ing a month ago. The Cardinal
opened in a 1-1-3 zone and the
Bruins opted to slow the game's
pace by running a "throw-away"
motion, designed to take seconds
oft'the shot clock.
However, UCLA's offensive
game plan failed to produce early,
as Stanford opened the game on an
11-2 run, which included two back
to-back 3-pointers from junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich.
Lottich, who scored nine first
half points on 3-of-3 shooting from
behind the arc, was sidelined with
nine minutes left to play when he
cut his lip in a collision with a Bruin
and was forced to leave the game.
Four stitches were needed at half
time to stop the bleeding.
Lottich's exit signaled the Bru
ins' offensive revival. UCLA quickly
closed a deficit that was once as big
as 16 points to finish the half on a
14-5 run, bringing the score to 44-
39 in favor of the Cardinal.
Stanford couldn't have asked for
a better first-half shooting perfor

mance. The Cardinal shot 64 per
cent from the field and went 6-for
-9 from behind the 3-point arc —
making the meager five-point half
time lead seem even more surpris
ing.
"We had to score a lot of points
because we had trouble defend
ing," Montgomery said. "We could
not get them stopped."
In the second half, the pace re
mained up-tempo. Out of the locker
room, UCLA senior shooting guard
Jason Kapono hit two consecutive
three-pointers to put the Bruins up
by one, 45-44. Stanford sophomore
Josh Childress answered with a two
point field goal, setting in motion a
9-0 Cardinal run.
Every time Stanford seemed to
pull away, however, the Bruins
calmly answered, keeping the
game within striking distance at all
times and making fora tension
filled ending.
UCLA's poise garnered praise
from Montgomery and his team.
"I actually feel like UCIA has a
chance to win the Pac-10 tourna
ment," Montgomery said. "What
ever turmoil they've had to deal
with I think they've put behind
them. I think they're playing with
confidence. There's not a lot for
them to lose."
With nine minutes left to play,
UCIA forward Andre Patterson
tied the game at 63-63 with a slam
dunk. Senior point guard Julius
Barnes was then fouled by Ryan
Walcott and hit two free throws to
put Stanford back in the lead.
The Cardinal continued the

trend of remaining poised down
the stretch, going 17-for-18 from
the charity stripe. Moreover,
Barnes turned in, arguably, his best
all-around performance to date.
Playing in front of his friends and
family, the senior point guard
scored a game-high 27 points and
dished out seven assists to complete
his career 4-0 at Pauley Pavilion.
With 44 seconds left, Stanford
still hadn't put the game away. Ray
Young hit a deep 3-pointer from
the top of the key to move the Bru
ins back within four, 88-84. The
basket would be UCLA's last, how
ever, as Barnes went 4-for-4 from
the free-throw line to seal the game
and his place amongst other Stan
ford notables.
"To be able to go undefeated at
Pauley throughout my career is
something 1 wanted," Barnes said.
"People like Mike [McDonald], Jar
ron, Jason [Collins], Tony [Giovac
chini], they had achieved that feat. I
wanted to be up there with them."
