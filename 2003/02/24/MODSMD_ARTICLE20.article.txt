# No trouble 'Bruin' in Pauley for Cardinal
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELESâ€”Alter practice
at Pauley Pavilion on Friday after
noon, Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery stood before his
team, huddled at center court.
With Cardinal alum Jarron Collins
sitting on the sidelines, in a pavilion
lined with 11 national champi
onship banners and on a court
where every scuff mark exists as a
little piece of basketball history,
Montgomery had his team's full at
tention.

Men's Basketball
Saturday: Stanford 93, UCLA 84
vs. Arizona State, Thursday, 7 p.m.

"There's not a lot of teams left
that are still playing for some
thing," said Montgomery in an at
tempt to focus his team before Sat
urday afternoon's matchup against
a struggling UCLA team. "We
are."
And he couldn't be more right.
Because of the Cardinal's two
win weekend in Los Angeles, in
cluding Saturday's 93-84 victory
over the Bruins (and UCLA's
Thursday upset over California),
Stanford finds itself tied with Cal
(19-6, 12-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
in second place and two games be
hind No. 1 Arizona (21-2,13-1 Pac
10) heading into the Cardinal's
final full week of conference play.
"To come down to L.A. and
sweep and be in the position that
we're in is really a tribute to these
kids," Montgomery said.
This scenario, this last-minute
race for the Pac-10 title, is even
more interesting in light of the fact

that the Arizona schools are due to
visit the Bay Area this weekend,
and Cal, 12-0 at Haas Pavilion, still
must travel to Maples before the
regular season is over.
Like the Cardinal, the Bruins
(6-17, 3-11 Pac-10) had something
to play for. Although they're not
competing fora Pac-10 title, UCLA
is fighting for the eighth and final
spot in the Pac-10 tournament.
In other words, the game was
important for all involved and con
sequently the Bruins didn't make it
easy on Stanford.
The start of the game was very
similar to the two teams' last meet
ing a month ago. The Cardinal
opened in a 1-1-3 zone and the
Bruins opted to slow the game's
pace by running a "throw-away"
motion, designed to take seconds
oft'the shot clock.
However, UCLA's offensive
game plan failed to produce early,
as Stanford opened the game on an
11-2 run, which included two back
to-back 3-pointers from junior
shooting guard Matt Lottich.
Lottich, who scored nine first
half points on 3-of-3 shooting from
behind the arc, was sidelined with
nine minutes left to play when he
cut his lip in a collision with a Bruin
and was forced to leave the game.
Four stitches were needed at half
time to stop the bleeding.
Lottich's exit signaled the Bru
ins' offensive revival. UCLA quickly
closed a deficit that was once as big
as 16 points to finish the half on a
14-5 run, bringing the score to 44-
39 in favor of the Cardinal.
Stanford couldn't have asked for
a better first-half shooting perfor

Junior Justin Davis was limited to seven points before fouling out in Saturday's
win over UCLA, but hot-shooting guards Julius Barnes ana Matt Lottich com
bined for 47 points as the Cardinal outgunned the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion.
