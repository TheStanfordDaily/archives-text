# Men's gymnasts soar over Eagles at Maples
## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The score implied that the Stanford
men's gymnastics team improved only
two falls from their meet at California last
week. But the fact is, the team was twice as
good this time around.
Hitting exactly twice as many routines
this time against the Air Force Academy,
the team's 211.5 points in this tightly
judged meet don't reflect the improve
ment over their 210.85 performance at
Cal. Though far from perfect, the men
easily adjusted to the soft, shaky floor of
Maples Pavilion and looked like they were
actually enjoying the competition.
"I'm happy the guys showed up —
there was no comparison with the Cal
meet," coach Thorn Glielmi said. "The
judging was extremely tight, but that's
what they're going to encounter at re
gional and nationals."
Competing alongside the women's
team, the men's scores contrasted with the
women's much-higher scores because of

the different scoring systems used by the
sports. The men are scored using the
Olympic rules of the International Gym
nastics Federation, while the women are
scored with NCAA rules.
The men's team easily defeated the Air
Force Academy, though that wasn't coach
Thom Glielmi's main focus of the night.
"Although Air Force didn't challenge
us, gymnastics is really a competition
against oneself," Glielmi said. "The thing I
feel that we still need to work on is closing
the deal by hitting the last event."
The team's biggest improvement was
on the parallel bars, where the men final
ly showed some consistency by hitting five
of the six routines they performed. Fresh
men Sean Doolan and Nate Downs, up
first in the lineup, set the tone for the team
on the event by hitting good routines with
stuck dismounts.
With a win on parallel bars, Downs fi
nally had a big night as a member of the
Cardinal, hitting all four of his routines
and taking second on the pommel horse
and third on the high-bar.

"Nate redeemed himself from his last
meet," Glielmi said. "Sean also stepped it
up on parallel bars."
The freshmen could have used more
help on the pommel horse, since they
were the only gymnasts who didn't fall on
their routines. It was a disappointing meet
on the pommel horse for both teams, as se
nior Marshall Erwin's missed routine was
good enough for first place.
Krwin dominated the only other event
he competed in, the still rings, winning it
by almost a full point over the competi
tion. Even with a big step on the dismount,
the defending NCAA ring champion easi
ly garnered the meet's biggest score with a
9.7.
Also highlighting the rings was the re
turn of sophomore Daniel Torres- Range),
who competed for the first time since
being out with a stress fracture on his back.
Despite only performing three routines in
practice since returning from his injury,
Torres-Range) looked comfortable in his

tions.
The men looked their best on
the floor and vault, where junior
Dan Gill hit his best routines of the
night. Gill seemed poised fora
huge night by sticking a beautiful
double-twisting double back flip
mount on the floor exercise, en
route to a 9.55 and top honors on
the event. Gill also won the vault,
the high bar and the all-around
competition.
With their own victory sealed,
the women's team joined the men
near the high bar to cheer them on
in their last event, as Gill and senior
Paul O'Leary caught their full
twisting double back flip release
move — a skill which currently
holds the sport's highest "Super E"
difficulty rating on high bar.
The Cardinal now prepares for
its last home meet of the season in
Burnham Pavilion on Saturday, a
five-way meet against California,
Nebraska, Michigan and Wash
ington.
