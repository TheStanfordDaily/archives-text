### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Blame Canada.
That thought may have been running
through the No. 7 Arizona State women's
gymnastics team's mind as the Sun Devils
(5-4, 2-4 Pacific-10 Conference) lost to No.
8 Stanford (8-2-1,4-1-1) 197.200-196.850.
Leading the charge for the Cardinal was
junior Lise Leveille — a 2000 Canadian
Olympian — who won the all-around with
a career-high 39.725, just 0.275 points
away from a perfect tour de force.
"Lise had a fantastic evening on all the
events," coach Kristen Smyth said. "She
and Lindsay Wing really gave exceptional
performances against ASU."
Leveille tied for top honors on all four

events and now has 11 first-place finishes
on the season.
Friday's meet was a highly anticipated
conference matchup. Arizona State was
coming off a close loss to top-ranked UCLA
— where the Sun Devils notched their
highest team score ever — and No. 12
Washington had just snapped Stanford's
in-conference undefeated streak.
But the Cardinal was more than ready
to get back on the winning track, and the
1,075 fans at Maples Pavilion could tell.
"We were pretty fired up going into this
meet,"junior Lindsay Wing said. "We start
ed off really strong on vault and had a lot of
stuck landings on bars, which is something
that we have been trying to improve on."
Stanford took an early lead with a su
perlative set on the vaulting table, which

saw Leveille, freshmen Glyn Sweets and
Natalie Foley, and junior Kendall Beck
each score a 9.900. The foursome tied for
first, and the team score of 49.450 now
stands in the Cardinal record books as the
team's all-time top performance on the ap
paratus.
Sweets, who performed in the all
around for the first time in cardinal and
white, performed a beautiful bars routine
but put her hands down on her dismount,
scoring a 9.45. Wing stepped up right af
terwards to post a 9.925, tying teammate
Leveille's score to share the bars title.
The perpetually reliable beam team also
did not disappoint on Friday, as the team
score of 49.575 tied the Cardinal's best
ever performance in the event. After an
uncharacteristic fall from Foley, Leveille

and Wing showcased the Cardinal's re
silience again, each posting a 9.950 to split
the beam title.
As the last rotation began, Stanford led
by 0.9 and seemed to have the win locked
UP
"It's hard to not finish a meet on a
strong note, and we did not end strongly
on floor," Smyth said. "For our fans and
ourselves, we need to start and end strong.
We have to hit all four events in one night,
and we need to start doing that to the best
of our ability."
The floor exercise would be the only
event on which the Sun Devils outscored
Stanford, as the Cardinal was forced to
count a fall. The win appeared to be slip
ping away as Leveille began her perfor
mance to end the meet.

Her 9.950 was just what Stanford need
ed to take the win by 0.3.
"Lindsay and Lise were stepping in
when there was a miss in front of them,"
Smyth said. " They competed so well and
covered each other and the team."
Another highlight of the meet was the
incorporation of new athletes into the floor
lineup.
"Incorporating Jessica Louie and Glyn
into the floor lineup was good, as they will
he great contributors on floor and will add
to our depth on that event," Wing said.
Smyth continued, "Adding to the line
ups is what it's going to take to compete on
the last day of the year. We want to have
everyone competing and experienced in
competition for nationals, so we're build
ing in the right direction."
