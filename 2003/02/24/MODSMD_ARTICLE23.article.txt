The Cardinal began its attack
Friday afternoon against the Tar
Heels of North Carolina. The two
teams squared off amidst the poor
weather and lasted five innings be
fore the game was postponed until
Saturday clue to rain.
Stanford's bats wasted little time
on Friday as freshman center field
er Catalina Morris knocked her first
career home run in the bottom of
the first. The Cardinal continued to
utilize the long ball in the bottom of
the second when senior first base
man Maureen LeCocq sent a shot
out of the park to left center field for
a two-run homer.
Tar Heel pitcher Cry stal Cox set
tled down following the second and
held the Cardinal to a three-run ad
vantage before the rain sent both
teams home with two innings re
maining.

Stanford returned to the field to
face North Carolina and seal its lead
Saturday morning. LeCocq closed
out the game for Sorensen and kept
the shutout.
Cox, however, remained unable
to tame the Cardinal bats as the
Stanford lineup doubled its lead,
posting three runs and making the
score 6-0.
Freshman shortstop Lauren
Lappin began the rally with a dou
ble down the right field line. Morris
walked to place runners on first and
second just in time for senior second
baseman Kira Ching to double and
score Lappin. Junior catcher Jessica
Allister then kept the rally going
with a single to center field, driving
in the final two runs of the game.
Immediately following the victo
ry the Cardinal took the field
again — this time against the
Southern Mississippi Lady Eagles.
Cardinal senior pitcher Tori Ny
berg started the battle against
Southern Miss and successfully shut
down the Lady Eagles for the first
four innings of the game.
This time around the Cardinal
bats also remained silent for the first
four innings before the game was
delayed for 40 minutes due to rain.
Upon returning to the field,
LeCocq started off the offense for
the Cardinal with the first hit of the
game in the top of the fifth. Senior
left fielder Cassi Brangham then
laid down a sacrifice bunt, putting
LeCocq in scoring position. Sopho
more right fielder Meghan Sickler
continued the rally with a base hit,
putting runners on first and third.
Junior pinch-hitter Michelle Thiry
followed with a clutch single
through the left side, pushing the
first run of the game across the
plate.
The combination of an infield
error and a single to left by Morris
drove in the final run of the game.
Sorensen took over in the circle
for Nyberg in the bottom of the fifth
and pitched through the sixth be
fore a second rain delay that pushed
the final inning to Sunday morning
when the Cardinal would finish off
the 2-0 victory.
Then came the Cardinal's tough
est challenge so far this season —
the No. 3 Nebraska Cornhuskers.
The game was worthy of a
matchup between two of college
softball's best teams.
The margin of victory was as
close as it can get — it was the differ

ence of one hit and one run — both
of which took place in the first at-bat
of the game.
Nyberg stepped on the rubber
for what promised to be a pitcher's
duel and was greeted by a lead-off
home run by Kim Ogee.
This run would be the first and
only one of the game.
The Cardinal attempted a come
back in the bottom of the second
with a Brangham two-out single.
Thiry would follow with a single of
her own, placing Brangham on
third, but the Huskers would shut
down the Stanford offense before
any damage was done.
This charge would be the last of
the game by the Cardinal, leaving
Nyberg with her first loss of the sea
son.
The elimination round that was
intended to follow the Nebraska-
Stanford duel never took place, as
the rain returned to end competi
tion for the weekend.
'Hie Cardinal will have a chance
to shine again this weekend back on
the Farm for the first-ever Stanford
Classic.
