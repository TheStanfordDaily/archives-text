The Cardinal began its attack
Friday afternoon against the Tar
Heels of North Carolina. The two
teams squared off amidst the poor
weather and lasted five innings be
fore the game was postponed until
Saturday clue to rain.
Stanford's bats wasted little time
on Friday as freshman center field
er Catalina Morris knocked her first
career home run in the bottom of
the first. The Cardinal continued to
utilize the long ball in the bottom of
the second when senior first base
man Maureen LeCocq sent a shot
out of the park to left center field for
a two-run homer.
Tar Heel pitcher Cry stal Cox set
tled down following the second and
held the Cardinal to a three-run ad
vantage before the rain sent both
teams home with two innings re
maining.

Stanford returned to the field to
face North Carolina and seal its lead
Saturday morning. LeCocq closed
out the game for Sorensen and kept
the shutout.
Cox, however, remained unable
to tame the Cardinal bats as the
Stanford lineup doubled its lead,
posting three runs and making the
score 6-0.
Freshman shortstop Lauren
Lappin began the rally with a dou
ble down the right field line. Morris
walked to place runners on first and
second just in time for senior second
baseman Kira Ching to double and
score Lappin. Junior catcher Jessica
Allister then kept the rally going
with a single to center field, driving
in the final two runs of the game.
Immediately following the victo

again â€” this time against the
Southern Mississippi Lady Eagles.
