# SSE closes Flicks To Go

### GOHAR GALYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Student Enterprises closed
Flicks to Go Last last week after only two
years in operation. SSE made the decision
after it conducted extensive analysis and col
lected data from student surveys, which led
them to conclude that continuing Flicks to
Go would not be profitable.
SSE, the business division of the ASSU,
declined to release the specific data on the
costs of Flicks to Go and the revenue it gen
erated over the past two years.
SSE Projects Director Kyle Alisharan, a
senior, said that before opening Flicks to Go,
SSE did thorough research to establish the
need fora video rental service on campus.
Alisharan said that recent feedback from stu
dent surveys and the general trend in the

movie-rental industry were two of the salient
reasons for closing Flicks to Go.
"The video rental business made sense
for the time when it was started because
movies were so expensive [$25-$ 100] that
people would usually only buy kids' movies
that would be watched several times," said
senior Athena von Oech, manager of Flicks
to Go. "Renting was pretty much the only
feasible option for most people."
The increase in the popularity and acces
sibility of DVDs are other reasons for the re
cent decreases in on-campus video rentals.
Because DVDs are fairly cheap to purchase,
many students are collecting movies and
lending them to one another. In addition to
borrowing movies, students are also copying
the DVDs, thus eliminating the need to rent.

Flicks To Go liquidated its stock of videos last weekend after two years in operation. SSE man
agers cited the increased usage of DVDs, and movie piracy, as main causes.
