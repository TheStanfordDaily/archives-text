# SSE closes Flicks To Go
## 
### GOHAR GALYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Student Enterprises closed
Flicks to Go Last last week after only two
years in operation. SSE made the decision
after it conducted extensive analysis and col
lected data from student surveys, which led
them to conclude that continuing Flicks to
Go would not be profitable.
SSE, the business division of the ASSU,
declined to release the specific data on the
costs of Flicks to Go and the revenue it gen
erated over the past two years.
SSE Projects Director Kyle Alisharan, a
senior, said that before opening Flicks to Go,
SSE did thorough research to establish the
need fora video rental service on campus.
Alisharan said that recent feedback from stu
dent surveys and the general trend in the

movie-rental industry were two of the salient
reasons for closing Flicks to Go.
"The video rental business made sense
for the time when it was started because
movies were so expensive [$25-$ 100] that
people would usually only buy kids' movies
that would be watched several times," said
senior Athena von Oech, manager of Flicks
to Go. "Renting was pretty much the only
feasible option for most people."
The increase in the popularity and acces
sibility of DVDs are other reasons for the re
cent decreases in on-campus video rentals.
Because DVDs are fairly cheap to purchase,
many students are collecting movies and
lending them to one another. In addition to
borrowing movies, students are also copying
the DVDs, thus eliminating the need to rent.

Flicks To Go liquidated its stock of videos last weekend after two years in operation. SSE man
agers cited the increased usage of DVDs, and movie piracy, as main causes.
"The dorms provided a perfect
vehicle tor sharing movies," said
von Oech. "I am a senior now, and
when I was a freshman, our RAhad
several DVDs, but no one else was
actively building DVD libraries. 1
talk to freshmen now and they are
having a very different
experience â€” they say if they ever
want to watch a movie, they walk
down the hall and pick one from
the several people who own them.
Why rent from an outside rental
business when you have your own
tree rental service within the
dorm?"
In addition to DVDs, file sharing
and downloading movies also
helped cripple Flicks to Go.
"Continuing FTG is like being in
the music industry right before
Napster," Alisharan said.

Besides sharing DVDs and
downloading movies, more stu
dents are also borrowing movies
from Green Library.
"Customer feedback indicated
that the large selection of free
videos at Green library made paid
rentals from FI G an undesirable
alternative," said current SSE CEO
David Endelman.
The problems which plagued
Flicks to Go are indicative of the
video renting industry as a whole.
"Several articles that have come
out in the last month have discussed
how poorly Blockbuster is doing,"
von Oech said. "One particular ti
tled 'DVD Killed the Video Star'
discussed that Blockbuster was fi
nally getting beaten.
"All the problems Blockbuster
was facing, we were dealing with to
a greater extent because nowhere
else in the United States are people
downloading and burning as much
as on college campuses," she con
tinued.

During the beginning of winter
quarter, Flicks to Go implemented
tlie dorm pass program where each
student in the dorm would pay $1
but would be able to check out un
limited number of movies during
the quarter. Alisharan said the peo
ple seemed interested in the pro
gram, but when it came time to pur
chase, students did not follow
through.
Endelman made the final deci
sion to close down Flicks to Go,
which held a liquidation sell this
weekend for its stock of videos.
Nonetheless, the Flicks to Go staff is
still working.
"We will all be working on tying
up all the loose ends of the business
and writing a detailed report on the
business for SSE to consult in the fu
ture when they are making deci
sions about enterprises," von Oech
said.
While Flicks to Go was not as suc
cessful as SSE had hoped, the de
velopment and implementation of

the business plan for Flicks to Go
and the decision to close it demon
strates how SSE gives students
training with operating a business.
"The whole experience that we
had with FTG exemplifies the pur
pose of SSE," Alisharan said. "One
of the greatest things about SSE,
which is also one of the things that
makes it most challenging, is that
we're operating in a real market
place with discerning consumers
exchanging real money trying to
create real value. There is no safety
net. Although FTG didn't workout,
our other businesses are doing well.
All of SSE was able to learn from this
experience, which will allow us to
create better businesses."
Stanford Student Enterprises
was established in 1996 by then fi
nancial manager John Hall. Today,
SSE has an $8 million endowment
and operates several businesses in
cluding Flicks, the Stanford Store,
the Stanford Directory and the Un
official Guide to Stanford.
