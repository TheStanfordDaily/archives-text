# Stanford alums lead Team USA over Card
## 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Stanford women's water polo pro
gram fell victim to its own success on Satur
day. The No. 1 Cardinal (5-1) lost to the
U.S. national team 7-3, with 2002 Cardinal
graduates Ellen Estes, Kate Petit, and
Margie Dingledein helping to lead the na
tional team to victory.
Although Estes, Petit and Dingledein
may have felt like fish out of water playing
against their alma mater's team, it didn't
show as Estes and Petit scored three of the
seven against Stanford.
The national team played a physical
game, forcing nine ejection fouls for Stan
ford when the Cardinal became more ag
gressive on defense. Those 6-on-5 opportu
nities led to four of the national team's
seven goals.
" The U.S. national team is clearly one of
the best teams in the world, and that makes
us play our best," Stanford coach John fan
ner said. "They capitalized on our mistakes
and on fast breaks. This matchup taught us
a lot that will help during our season."
The Farm's alumnae stepped up in the
first period to take advantage of Cardinal
sophomore Hannah Luber's ejection foul.
With 2:49 left in the quarter, Estes scored
with an assist from Dingledein during the 6-

on-5. Stanford's scoring efforts were
thwarted as national team goalie Nicolle
l'ayne recorded four saves during the first
seven minutes.
Team USA's Heather Moody barely beat
the buzzer to score again and widen the gap
to 2-0 at the end of the first quarter.
"The game was on an entirely different
level than collegiate water polo. The na
tional team plays a lot more physical, and
we felt pressure in every area of the game,"
senior Julie Gardner said. "1 think we did a
great job getting open on the counter-at
tack. We just need to work on putting our
shots away."
The national team won the sprint to start
the second quarter, but Stanford junior and
national team member Brenda Villa
blocked Team USA's first attempt. Fifty sec
onds into the period, Gardner made sure
the Cardinal wasn't out for the count, as her
picture-perfect lob over l'ayne cut the
deficit to one.
"Julie had a great game," Tanner said.
"She's a very physical player, a real leader
on defense and has an unbelievably feel for
the game. She really delivered for us."
Stanford's defense turned it up a notch
in the second period, swarming for steals,
but also suffering three ejections. Estes and
Moody repeated their first-quarter efforts
by notching one each for the national team,

Moody's occurring during a 6-on-5.
Villa had a chance when Team USA suf
fered an ejection with 3:14 left, but her shot
was tipped out. Sophomore Kelty Luber
tallied Stanford's second point with 2:09 left
to bring the Cardinal within two.
But the national team's second buzzer
beater of the night left the crowd with a
sense of deja vu and the score at 5-2 head
ing into halftime.
The third period was scoreless and saw
Cardinal senior goalkeeper Jackie Frank
record four saves and clutch blocks to shut
down Team USA's threat. Stanford
couldn't score on its second 6-on-5 of the
evening, as Villa's wrap-around shot was
blocked.
Kelty Luber's second counter-attack
goal of the evening gave the Cardinal a
chance, as Stanford found itself behind by
two with 3:32 remaining in the fourth quar
ter.
But Villa and junior Wendy Watkins'
numerous efforts to close the gap were shut
down by the national team's blocks and
steals. With 2:28 left, Gardner's third deft
attempt was squelched with a block as a
Team USA's defense flocked to stifle Stan
ford's offense.
Team USA managed to add two more
goals in the last 1:03 to seal the win — one
by Kate Petit and the other by Catharine

von Schwarz, who scored after drawing an
ejection against Stanford.
The historical matchup marked the first
time a collegiate team and the national team
met in competition during the regular sea
son.
"This was such an incredible opportuni
ty for us to play against a talented team,"
Gardner said. "I think it's going to give us a
big advantage in our upcoming games —
playing against teams that are better is

what makes you stronger."
Stanford looks to continue its title de
fense and undefeated streak against colle
giate foes next week, when it hosts confer
ence rivals UCIA and UC-Santa Barbara,
hoping to apply lessons learned from Sat
urday's duel.
"We practice with the idea to put our
selves in the position to play fora champi
onship, and I think we're in a good position
right now to reach that goal," Tanner said.

we felt pressure in every area of the game,"
senior Julie Gardner said. "1 think we did a
great job getting open on the counter-at
tack. We just need to work on putting our
shots away."
The national team won the sprint to start
the second quarter, but Stanford junior and
national team member Brenda Villa
blocked Team USA's first attempt. Fifty sec
onds into the period, Gardner made sure
the Cardinal wasn't out for the count, as her
picture-perfect lob over l'ayne cut the
deficit to one.
"Julie had a great game," Tanner said.
"She's a very physical player, a real leader
on defense and has an unbelievably feel for
the game. She really delivered for us."
Stanford's defense turned it up a notch
in the second period, swarming for steals,
but also suffering three ejections. Estes and
Moody repeated their first-quarter efforts
by notching one each for the national team,

Moody's occurring during a 6-on-5.
Villa had a chance when Team USA suf
fered an ejection with 3:14 left, but her shot
was tipped out. Sophomore Kelty Luber
tallied Stanford's second point with 2:09 left
to bring the Cardinal within two.
But the national team's second buzzer
beater of the night left the crowd with a
sense of deja vu and the score at 5-2 head
ing into halftime.
The third period was scoreless and saw
Cardinal senior goalkeeper Jackie Frank
record four saves and clutch blocks to shut
down Team USA's threat. Stanford
couldn't score on its second 6-on-5 of the
evening, as Villa's wrap-around shot was
blocked.
Kelty Luber's second counter-attack
goal of the evening gave the Cardinal a
chance, as Stanford found itself behind by
two with 3:32 remaining in the fourth quar
ter.
But Villa and junior Wendy Watkins'
numerous efforts to close the gap were shut
down by the national team's blocks and
steals. With 2:28 left, Gardner's third deft
attempt was squelched with a block as a
Team USA's defense flocked to stifle Stan
ford's offense.
Team USA managed to add two more
goals in the last 1:03 to seal the win — one
by Kate Petit and the other by Catharine

von Schwarz, who scored after drawing an
ejection against Stanford.
The historical matchup marked the first
time a collegiate team and the national team
met in competition during the regular sea
son.
"This was such an incredible opportuni
ty for us to play against a talented team,"
Gardner said. "I think it's going to give us a
big advantage in our upcoming games —
playing against teams that are better is

what makes you stronger."
Stanford looks to continue its title de
fense and undefeated streak against colle
giate foes next week, when it hosts confer
ence rivals UCIA and UC-Santa Barbara,
hoping to apply lessons learned from Sat
urday's duel.
"We practice with the idea to put our
selves in the position to play fora champi
onship, and I think we're in a good position
right now to reach that goal," Tanner said.
