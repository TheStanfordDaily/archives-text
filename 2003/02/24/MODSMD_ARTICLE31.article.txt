# Tennis avenges only loss in 6-1 win over Cal
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was not a slight breeze that
defeated California at the Taube
Family Tennis Center on Satur
day. It was a Cardinal tidal wave
that swept the Bears off the
court.
No. 5 Stanford (5-1, 1-0 Pacific
-10 Conference) kicked olf the Pa
cific-10 Conference season in re
sounding style with a 6-1 throttling
of No. 4 Cal (5-2, 0-1 Pac-10). In
doing so, the Cardinal avenged a
bitter 4-3 loss to the Bears at the
Team Indoor Championships two
weeks ago.
The scores, especially in dou
bles, were not indicative of just
how close the individual points re

ally were, however. Tension was
apparent on every toss of the ball
and every swing of the racket as
both Pac-10 superiority and rival
bragging rights were at stake.
The Cardinal began the match
on a different note than it did dur
ing the last Cal match by winning
the crucial doubles point.
The team of junior Lauren
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette, ranked eighth national
ly, upset the fourth-ranked Cal
duo of Raquel Kops-Jones and
Christina Fusano, 8-2. Later, the
freshman tandem of Alice Barnes
and Amber Liu beat Jieun Jacobs
and Jody Scheldt 8-4 to secure the
point.
"After winning the doubles
point you go into singles thinking

that you only need to win three out
of the six matches, so that definite
ly takes a little pressure off the
team," Barnikow said. "It gives us
a mental advantage and some
room for error."
Barnes said, "We knew the dou
bles point would be very impor
tant, as Cal takes great pride in
their doubles, and we thought it
would rock them a little if we took
the point. Last time we played Cal,
Amber and I got off to a very bad
start in our match and couldn't re
ally recover, so we made sure we
were focused from the very first
ball."
Propelled by the captured dou
bles point, the Cardinal sprang
into singles action confident and
determined.
A powerful Kops-Jones, No. 12
in the nation, tied the dual match
at one apiece with a 6-1,6-2 defeat
of Amber Liu at the top singles
spot. But junior Emilia Anderson
quickly responded by dismantling
Scheldt, 6-2, 6-3.
"I came out very focused and
ready to play, and I was especially
motivated because I had lost to the
same girl at Indoors a few weeks
ago," Anderson said. "I knew how
to play my opponent â€” 1 also real
ly tried to stick to a solid game plan
and not stray from it even if she hit
a few winners here and there."
Sophomore Story Tweedie-
Yates put the Cardinal up 3-1
shortly thereafter with a 6-4, 6-3
straight-set victory over Nicole
Havlicek.
While Stanford needed one of
three remaining points necessary
for the victory, the large home
crowd began congregating
around the No. 4 singles court to
watch Barnes battle Jacobs.
Following her 6-3 first set victo
ry, Barnes served for the match
after taking a 5-4 lead in the seesaw
second set. But Jacobs broke back
at 5-4, and Barnes could not hold

serve at 6-5 in a game that lasted
nearly 10 minutes and drew roars
from bystanders. Eventually,
though, Barnes prevailed in the
tiebreaker, and the upset of Cal
was complete.
"I think the crowd helped me
stay focused, they were really loud
today which is just how I like it,"
Barnes said. "They helped me to
forget about the two match points
that I lost at 6-5 and just concen
trate on the tiebreak; I really want
ed to win in two sets because I
thought it might help to take some
of the pressure off the other girls
still playing."
Immediately after Barnes' win,
Burdette won her No. 3 singles
match over Fusano. The hard
serving Burdette rebounded from
a frustrating first set to defeat Fu
sano 1-6, 6-3, 6-2.
The final match was a three-set
clash between Barnikow and
Catherine Lynch at the No. 2 sin
gles spot. Barnikow shot out to a 6-
2 first-set lead, but Lynch drew
even by angling winners from be
hind the baseline and gained a 3-6
second-set advantage. Barnikow's
ground strokes proved too strong
for Lynch, especially from the
forehand side, and she captured
the last set 6-4 to bring the final
match score to 6-1 in favor of Stan
ford.
The crowd, swelled by a rush of
Parents' Weekend attendees,
aided the Cardinal throughout the
match.
"The home crowd was awe
some and really helped me to keep
pushing myself in the third set."
Barnikow said. "In the past two
years I don't remember having
that big of a crowd and it being as
enthusiastic and vocal as it was
today."
Stanford will look to continue
its dominance of this five-match
homestand when it takes on Pep
perdine today at 1:30 p.m.
