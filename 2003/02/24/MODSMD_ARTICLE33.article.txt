## Stanford beats UC-Irvine on Friday before falling to UCLA 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a Friday-night upset win
over No. 3 UC-Irvine (14-4, 7-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) the No. 9 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (8-8, 6-6 MPSF) was
gearing up fora much-needed
weekend sweep, but No. 11 UCIA
(9-7, 6-6 MPSF) had something
else in mind.
On Friday, the Anteaters took
the opening game and led the Car
dinal 29-27 in the second when
Stanford came back to win the
match in four games.
"We got some help from
[Irvine]. They made some errors
when we were on the verge of
being out of here in three," coach
Don Shaw said. "But we snapped
out of it, got a couple of big plays
and we were able to continue that
momentum all the way through
the match."

The Cardinal had big play all
around, but saw particular effi
ciency from sophomore middle
blocker Craig Buell who racked up
14 kills for spectacular hitting per
centage of .824.
After erasing two game points
in the second game, the momen
tum swung Stanford's way and
they never looked back.
"You get a little bit of confi
dence when you win that one
game," Shaw said. "And it carries
through. I just think we did good
job defensively."
The Cardinal out-dug the
Anteaters 52-35. with sophomore
setter Kevin Hansen leading the
way with 12 digs.
Sophomore outside hitter
David Vogel, senior middle block
er Billy Strickland and freshman
libero Jeremy Jacobs also con
tributed significantly on the defen
sive end finishing with 11,10 and
10 digs, respectively.
"That backcourt defense was
the difference in the match," Shaw
said. "We didn't outblock them,
but the balls we didn't block, we
dug. We kept more balls in play
than they did."

Offensively, the team was more
than solid as Strickland and senior
opposite hitter Will Curtis led the
way with 17 kills apiece.
However, the team did not
have the same rhythm on Satur
day night.
In a match that lasted only one
hour and 20 minutes, the Cardinal
finished with an extremely low
.194 hitting percentage.
After taking a 30-19 beating in
game two of the match, in which
the Cardinal had only a .069 hit
ting percentage, coach Shaw
switched out the lineup with the
hope of curbing the Bruin mo
mentum.
Seldom-used freshman outside
hitter Ben Redely came in and pro
vided a spark off the bench,
recording six kills in the process.
The different look was not
enough and Stanford trailed the
entire third game, ultimately los
ing 30-26.
Sophomore outside hitter
Jonathan Acosta was strong for the
Bruins, finishing with 12 kills and
7 digs, both match-highs.
Paul Bocage was the high-man
for Stanford, compiling 11 kills.
