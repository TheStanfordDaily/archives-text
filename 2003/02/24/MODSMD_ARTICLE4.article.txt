### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN 
Last Friday marked the one
year anniversary of the death of
The Wall Street Journal reporter
and Stanford alumnus Daniel
Pearl, Class of 1985.
Memorial services were recent
ly held throughout the world in
New York, Los Angeles, Toronto,
London, Paris and Jerusalem to
commemorate Pearl, who was The
Journal's South Asia bureau chief.
Pearl was killed in Karachi, Pak
istan after being abducted in Janu
ary 2002 while writing a story
about Richard Reid, who was
hilled "the shoe bomber." On Feb.
21,2002, the State Department re
vealed that Pearl was dead after it
received a videotape from his kid
nappers that documented his exe

cution. Three men were later sen
tenced to life imprisonment and
one man to death for the kidnap
ping and murder of Pearl.
"Journalism is no longer a priv
ileged profession, in the sense
that journalists were once thought
to possess a certain amount of
immunity," said Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, who taught
Pearl when he was a communica
tion major at Stanford. "It's made
journalism a much more danger
ous profession, which means that .
. . wliat the public will know will he
managed by both our government
and our enemies."
