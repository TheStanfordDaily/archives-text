Stanford has joined MIT
and other organizations in fil

"friends of the court" brief filed
last week focused on the impor

fields.
Other groups to sign the
brief include DuPont, IBM and

of Michigan's policy of using
race as a factor in making ad

missions decisions. Stanford has

cases, which represent the most
substantial suits challenging af
firmative action since the 1978
Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke, which elim
inated the use of racial quotas
but allowed schools to consider
race as one factor among many
in admissions policies.

and MIT brief, U.S. businesses
depend on higher education to

engineers representing the di
versity of the country — a task
they feel to be especially impor
tant, considering the U.S. econ
omy's interrelationship with
countries all across the world.
"Amici assert that diversity
(broadly defined and including
racial and ethnic diversity) is in
fact absolutely essential to the
advancement of science and en
gineering — in part for the
