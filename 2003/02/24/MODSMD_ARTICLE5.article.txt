# Stanford files brief in U-Mich. case
## 
### JULIE LEIN 
Stanford has joined MIT
and other organizations in fil
ing an amicus curiae brief with
the Supreme Court in favor of
the University of Michigan's af
firmative action policies. The
"friends of the court" brief filed
last week focused on the impor
tance of using race and ethnici
ty as factors in college admis
sions policies to increase diver
sity in science and engineering
fields.
Other groups to sign the
brief include DuPont, IBM and
the National Academy of Sci
ences and Engineering. The 30-
page document stresses the
need for diversity both in insti
tutions of higher learning and
in the job market.
Grutter v. Bollinger and
Gratz v. Bollinger, which will be
heard before the Court in early
April, challenge the University
of Michigan's policy of using
race as a factor in making ad

missions decisions. Stanford has
considerable interest in the two
cases, which represent the most
substantial suits challenging af
firmative action since the 1978
Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke, which elim
inated the use of racial quotas
but allowed schools to consider
race as one factor among many
in admissions policies.
According to the Stanford
and MIT brief, U.S. businesses
depend on higher education to
produce a pool of scientists and
engineers representing the di
versity of the country — a task
they feel to be especially impor
tant, considering the U.S. econ
omy's interrelationship with
countries all across the world.
"Amici assert that diversity
(broadly defined and including
racial and ethnic diversity) is in
fact absolutely essential to the
advancement of science and en
gineering — in part for the
same reasons that it is important
for higher education generally,
but also fora host of other reasons
peculiarly related to these fields,
and to their critical world role,"
the brief states. "And minorities
are even more under-represent
ed in science and engineering
fields than in others."
Stanford and MIT are joined
in supporting the University of
Michigan's policies by 300 organi
zations in more than 60 amici cu
riae. Other affirmative action sup
porters include over 100 universi
ties, 63 multinational companies,
a dozen states and numerous
Congressional members and mili
tary leaders.
They face considerable opposi
tion, including an amic us brief by

the Bush administration in favor
of the plaintiffs' position challeng
ing the legality of considering
race in admissions decision.
Stanford's amicus curiae
claims that diversity would be sig
nificantly diminished by the pro
hibiting race from being a factor
in admissions decisions. "The
Shape of the River," a book cited
in the Stanford and MIT brief, ar
gues that less than 2 percent of
students entering the most com
petitive schools would be African
Americans if universities were
race blind.
"Overwhelming empirical evi
dence supported by over a centu
ry of scientific research unrelated
to concerns over racial diversity
indicates that a university's com
plex educational goals and insti
tutional mission cannot be
achieved solely by relying on ob
jective criteria such as standard
ized test scores," the brief states.

"Race, national origin and ethnic
ity, along with other considera
tions, are sometimes relevant in
this assessment of an individual
because they can provide a social
and cultural context in which to
understand an individual's ac
complishments and life experi
ence."
Before filing the brief, Univer
sity President John Hennessy
made a statement establishing
the University's support of affir
mative action to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"The consideration of race and
ethnicity as one factor among
many in that admission process is
consistent with our history as an
institution and our belief that the
next generation of leaders must
reflect the strengths and talents of
all our nation's citizens," Hen
nessy said in his statement.
Both the Faculty Senate and
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate

passed resolutions in support of
! iennessy's stance.
Critics of the University of
Michigan's policies claim that af
firmative action is reverse dis
crimination. They contest the
University of Michigan policies as
violations of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amend
ment and Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act. The plaintiffs and Jus
tice Department say that race
neutral admissions and a diverse
student body are not mutually ex
clusive. They propose an alterna
tive for current affirmative action
with the percentage plan, already
practiced in Texas, Florida, and
California. This system allows a
fixed percentage in each graduat
ing class admission to a state uni
versity.
The University of Michigan
claims that the percentage plan is
more analogous to the quota sys
tem struck down in Bakke.

ry of scientific research unrelated
to concerns over racial diversity
indicates that a university's com
plex educational goals and insti
tutional mission cannot be
achieved solely by relying on ob
jective criteria such as standard
ized test scores," the brief states.

"Race, national origin and ethnic
ity, along with other considera
tions, are sometimes relevant in
this assessment of an individual
because they can provide a social
and cultural context in which to
understand an individual's ac
complishments and life experi
ence."
Before filing the brief, Univer
sity President John Hennessy
made a statement establishing
the University's support of affir
mative action to the Faculty Sen
ate.
"The consideration of race and
ethnicity as one factor among
many in that admission process is
consistent with our history as an
institution and our belief that the
next generation of leaders must
reflect the strengths and talents of
all our nation's citizens," Hen
nessy said in his statement.
Both the Faculty Senate and
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate

passed resolutions in support of
! iennessy's stance.
Critics of the University of
Michigan's policies claim that af
firmative action is reverse dis
crimination. They contest the
University of Michigan policies as
violations of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amend
ment and Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act. The plaintiffs and Jus
tice Department say that race
neutral admissions and a diverse
student body are not mutually ex
clusive. They propose an alterna
tive for current affirmative action
with the percentage plan, already
practiced in Texas, Florida, and
California. This system allows a
fixed percentage in each graduat
ing class admission to a state uni
versity.
The University of Michigan
claims that the percentage plan is
more analogous to the quota sys
tem struck down in Bakke.
