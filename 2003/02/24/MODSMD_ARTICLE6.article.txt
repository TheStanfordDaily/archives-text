# Ruling against affirmative action would cause policy changes in admissions
## 
### MATT ZAFRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While Stanford has tiled an amicus curiae brief
with the University of Michigan in support of its pol
icy of considering race as a factor in admissions deci
sions, a ruling by the Supreme Court that bars such
policies would force Stanford to follow suit and sub
stantially affect the admissions process.
"The real issue is the ramifications of a ruling that
undercuts Bakke," said University President John
Hennessy, referring to the 1978 University of Cali
fornia Regents v. Bakke case where the Supreme
Court banned the use of racial quotas in admissions
decisions. The case, however, allowed for race to be
a factor in admission.
Hennessy continued, "If [the Court] simply
rule[s] that the University of Michigan's specific
technique is impermissible, there will be little or no
effect. If they rule that the Bakke decision is uncon
stitutional, the effect will be significant, since this
could prevent us from considering
race as a factor in admissions.
"We must, of course, abide by tfie
law," Hennessy said. "Right now,
Bakke is the guiding principle. If
that changes, our policy must
change, although our position
might still be that considering race as
one factor is beneficial."
The two Michigan cases, Gratz v.
Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger,
have hearings scheduled for April 1.
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet indicated that a
ruling against the University of
Michigan could result in a change in
the composition ofthe student body,
similar to what has happened at sev
eral University of California schools.
"If Bakke is limited in any signifi
cant wav, our ability to achieve the

scope of diversity we do now would
be severely jeopardized, and thus
the University's excellence sadly di
minished," Mamlet said.
Since 1997, when California
passed Proposition 209, which ellec
tively ended affirmative action by
barring state schools from consider
ing race in admissions, the number
of black and Hispanic students at
UC-Berkeley has dropped substan
tially while Asian-American and
white enrollment lias increased.
"Although our efforts to attract
and enroll a diverse class could cer
tainly be hindered if (he Supreme
Court rules against the University of
Michigan, so much depends on the
nuances of the ruling," Mamlet con
tinued. "It would be premature to
try to imagine how this ruling will
come out.
Mamlet added, "I continue to be
proud of the clear and forceful pub
lic stand that Stanford has taken on
behalf of affirmative action."
