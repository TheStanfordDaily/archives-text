# Signees question use of Pro-Israel ad
## Stanford Israel Alliance releases statement explaining petition 
### VAUHINI VARA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Israel Alliance released a
statement yesterday clarifying its use of a
petition supporting "Israel's right to exist
as a Jewish state" after some signees
claimed they were unaware of or dis
agreed with the group's plan to send the

petition to members of Congress.
The petition, which was signed by over
1,500 students, ran as an advertisement
last Tuesday in The Stanford Daily. After
the ad ran, sophomore Avi Yotam, who
helped coordinate the effort to circulate
the petition, wrote in an e-mail to SIA that
the ad would be sent to "every single con
gressperson in California, with an at
tached letter that asks the congressperson
fora comment about Stanford's strong
pro-Israel sentiment."
Since the was e-mail was sent, many stu
dents wh< > signed the petition objected to its
being used to characterize Stanford as hav

ing "strong pro-Israel sentiment" and have
discussed their understanding of the peti
tion on dorm e-mail lists.
The alliance's public statement was
written by three board members of SLA
and appears on its Web site. The 350-
word statement clarifies the organiza
tion's intent in creating a petition, states
what the organization plans to do with the
petition and apologizes to students who
did not know that the petition would be
used for.
Senior Tali Golan, co-president of the
SIA, said that the students involved
in gathering signatures were en
couraged to be open about the
meaning and purpose of the peti
tion, as well as its future uses.
Nonetheless, many students
said that they did not know when
they signed the petition that their
names would be used as evidence
of "strong pro-Israel sentiment"
and said that they felt such a char
acterization could be misleading.
Some added that they felt misled
by the alliance representatives who
approached them.
"Do I support a free Israel?" said
sophomore Courtney Smith. "Yes.
But does the petition prove a 'strong
Pro-Israel sentiment,' at Stanford?
I'm not sure."
Freshman Danny Cullenward
signetl the petition because he read
it as a moderate statement for peace.
But he feels that the Israeli govern
ment should also take responsibility
for establishing peace.
"Simply stating my preference to
not see Israel wiped off the face of
the earth in a bloody war does not
mean I want to support a govern
ment wishing to do just that to the
Palestinians," he said.
Smith and Cullenward said that
they probably would not have
signed the petition if they had
known how it would be used.
Golan wrote in the alliance's
statement that the petition had "no
hidden meaning."
"The statement 'We support Is

rael's right to exist as a Jewish state'
represents the belief that Israel is
needed as a homeland for the Jew
ish people," she said. "This does not
imply that there should not be a
Palestinian state. The two are not
mutually exclusive."
The petition did not mention the
Palestinians.
While some students said that
they felt misled, sophomore
Jenny Lee said that when she
asked an alliance representative
how the petition would be used,
he was open to questions and an
swered honestly, mentioning that
signatures might be sent to Con
gress in the future.
When Lee told him that she was
not interested, he reacted politely.
"He was really cool about it; he
wasn't angry," she said. "He just
said, 'Oh, I understand. Thank you
for your time.'"
declined to sign the petition
because she did not feel knowledge
able enough about the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict.
"I didn't feel comfortable signing
something that I had no knowledge
about," she said. "There are so many
issues going on in the Middle East
that it's hard to pick sides. It's hard to
say that you support only one group,
especially if you know that that group
may be doing things that you don't
particularly agree with."
The petition included the signa
tures of some students involved in
campus politics, such as ASSU Pres
ident Monica Henestroza and Stan
ford Progressive Editor in Chief
Josh Benson, both seniors.
Benson said that he agreed with
t he petition and understood the im
plications of signing it.

"In both the text and the way it
was presented to me, it appeared in
tended not to make a major contro
versial statement, but simply to head
oft what's been some growing anti-
Semitism in this debate: the idea
that Israel is, by definition, an illegit
imate and recist state,"he said. "The
petition said no more and no less

and I believe that is precisely how it
was presented in The Daily."
Benson said that the purpose of
circulating a petition is to present it
to the public.
"That you could sign a petition
without realizing what the basic pur
pose of a petition is â€” that's ridicu
lous," he said.
