# Signees question use of Pro-Israel ad
## Stanford Israel Alliance releases statement explaining petition 
### VAUHINI VARA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Israel Alliance released a
statement yesterday clarifying its use of a
petition supporting "Israel's right to exist
as a Jewish state" after some signees
claimed they were unaware of or dis
agreed with the group's plan to send the

petition to members of Congress.
The petition, which was signed by over
1,500 students, ran as an advertisement
last Tuesday in The Stanford Daily. After
the ad ran, sophomore Avi Yotam, who
helped coordinate the effort to circulate
the petition, wrote in an e-mail to SIA that
the ad would be sent to "every single con
gressperson in California, with an at
tached letter that asks the congressperson
fora comment about Stanford's strong
pro-Israel sentiment."
Since the was e-mail was sent, many stu
dents wh< > signed the petition objected to its
being used to characterize Stanford as hav

ing "strong pro-Israel sentiment" and have
discussed their understanding of the peti
tion on dorm e-mail lists.
The alliance's public statement was
written by three board members of SLA
and appears on its Web site. The 350-
word statement clarifies the organiza
tion's intent in creating a petition, states
what the organization plans to do with the
petition and apologizes to students who
did not know that the petition would be
used for.
