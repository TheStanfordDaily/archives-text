# DUI crash triggers pre-dawn alarms
## 
### SAMEER AHMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford student was arrested early yesterday
morning for driving under the influence after his
vehicle hit a fire hydrant and flipped over on Cam
pus Drive near Roth Way. As a result of the acci
dent, campus water levels decreased, causing 1 1 fire
alarms to go off across campus.
The student, a 20-year-old junior, was arrested
yesterday at 3:30 a.m. He was taken to the Santa
Clara County Main Jail Complex in San Jose and
was released at 2:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon.
While the Stanford Police Department reported a
minor injury at the scene, neither the student nor
his one passenger received medical treatment.
The student was returning to Stanford from an
off-campus party at Sugary, one of about a dozen
Palo Alto "Dead Houses" rented to Stanford stu
dents by a local real estate owner. When the student
made it back on campus, he was driving near a con
struction site on the west side of campus when he lost
control of the car, drove through a chain-link fence,
hit a fire hydrant and flipped the car upside down.
"We did have an accident last night which in
volved someone driving under the influence," said
Lt. Hilary Karp of the Stanford Police Department.
"We did not investigate the situation. It was investi
gated by the California Highway Patrol, because
under California law, any incident involving an in
jury that happens on private property — which
Stanford is — has to be dealt with by the California
Highway Patrol."
When California Highway Patrol officers arrived
at the scene, they detained the student and charged
him with driving under the influence.
Anne Dowd, residence dean for the Row, said the
University would probably not take any further dis
ciplinary action.
"[Residence deans] always follow up with stu
dents anytime the Stanford police is involved in an
investigation [of themj," she said. "We try and sup
port the students involved and try to meet with
them. In DUI cases, we usually
don't take any more disciplinary
action."
Soon after the student drove
"into the fire hydrant, 11 on-cam
pus fire alarms, including those
in Roble Hall and Mirrielees,
went off from 4:31 a.m. to 6:13
a.m.
"It is not uncommon fora
sudden outflow of water from a
fire hydrant to cause this behav
ior," said Bruce Martin, battal
ion chief at the Palo Alto Fire De
partment. "No damage was
done [where the fire alarms
went off]. The systems were
reset, and the firemen went
home."
Mirrielees residents were

upset witli the amount of time it
took the Fire Department to
shut off the alarm.
"It took about 45 minutes for
the Fire Department to come
and stop the tire alarm," said
sophomore Rania Elton. "It was
annoying that it took so long for
the alarm to stop. I didn't think
it was a big deal though, because
I lived in Mirrielees last year,
and the fire alarm would go off a
lot in the middle of the night."
But Karp said that, given the
situation, there was little the Fire
Department could do to re
spond quicker.
"If a whole bunch of fire
alarms were going off at the
same time, it would take a while
to fix all of them, because [the
Fire Department] probably only
sent out one ffire] engine be
cause it wasn't a Fire emer
gency," Karp said.
