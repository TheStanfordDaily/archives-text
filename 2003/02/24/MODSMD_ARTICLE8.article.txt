A Stanford student was arrested early yesterday
morning for driving under the influence after his
vehicle hit a fire hydrant and flipped over on Cam
pus Drive near Roth Way. As a result of the acci

alarms to go off across campus.

hit a fire hydrant and flipped the car upside down.

Lt. Hilary Karp of the Stanford Police Department.
"We did not investigate the situation. It was investi

Highway Patrol."
When California Highway Patrol officers arrived
at the scene, they detained the student and charged
him with driving under the influence.
Anne Dowd, residence dean for the Row, said the
University would probably not take any further dis
ciplinary action.
"[Residence deans] always follow up with stu
