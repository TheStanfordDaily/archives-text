A Stanford professor was honored last
week by the National Academy of Engineer
ing with one of engineering's foremost awards
for his pioneering work on the Global Posi
tioning System (GPS).
Bradford Parkinson, a 68-year-old Stan
ford emeritus professor of aeronautics and
astronautics, and co-winner Ivan Getting,
were awarded the $500,000 Charles Stark
Draper Prize for developing GPS, a naviga
tion technology that accurately pinpoints lo
cations on earth through the use of satellites
and transmitters. The award is considered
the engineering equivalent of the Nobel
Prize.
"Many of engineering's great achieve
ments become so much a part of our lives that
they are taken for granted," said NAE presi
dent William Wulf. "I think that, without
question, GPS is destined for this distinction."
Wulf added that the achievement places
Parkinson and Getting in the same ranks as
the creators of the microchip, jet engine, fiber
optics and the Internet.
Harnessing the power of 24 orbiting satel
lites, GPS devices can pinpoint the exact posi
tion of virtually any place on earth. Originally
designed for military use, GPS has long been
used by the armed forces for navigation and
control of military aircraft, missiles and satel
lites, as well as the movement of ground
troops.
Yet the technology is also found today in
everything from cars, boats and planes to
farm machinery, cell phones and laptops.
"We all embraced a vision," Parkinson said.
"But we couldn't foresee at the time how pop
ular it would become."
Wulf added: "GPS is a transformative tech
nology that has significant implications in our
time. This award is a recognition and celebra
tion of the work they have done."
Parkinson first became involved in the De
partment of Defense GPS program in 1972,
having earned his doctoral degree in aero
space and astronautics from Stanford six
years before.
Now a professor emeritus in the School of
Engineering at Stanford, Parkinson continues
to improve the accuracy of GPS.
Parkinson is also co-principal investigator
at the Stanford-based Gravity Probe B pro
gram. Funded by NASA, researchers are at
tempting to validate Einstein's General Theo
ry of Relativity using orbiting gyroscopes.
In accepting the award, Parkinson paid
homage to the teams of?ftgineers with whom
he worked over the years.
"This is a metaphor for so many things that
we as a society take for granted — telephones,
automobiles, airplanes, the World Wide
Web," he said. "All of those things were done
by teams of engineers who were largely
anonymous."

Those who know him personally howev
er, maintain that Parkinson played a crucial
and irreplaceable role in the development of
GPS.
"None of this would have happened with
out his direct involvement," said Bruce l'eetz,
vice president for technology at Trimble Nav
igation in Sunnyvale, where Parkinson was
acting president and chief executive officer in
the late 19905. "His leadership skills really
helped bring this utility into existence by en
suring the involvement of people at all levels."

Robert Cannon, professor emeritus of
aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford,
shared a similar opinion.
"Parkinson is great at integrating teams of
people, and he's really the person who
brought it all together," he said.
The significance of GPS cannot be under
estimated, Peetz added.
"GPS will prove to be extremely valuable in
years to come," he said. "It will affect us in that
everyday way that we take for granted, much
like we treat microprocessors today."

California farmers are just one of many groups of people who have benefited from the work of Stan
ford Prof. Emeritus Bradford Parkinson. Parkinson and Ivan Getting were recognized by the Nation
al Academy of Engineering for their development of the now-übiqitious Global Positioning System.
