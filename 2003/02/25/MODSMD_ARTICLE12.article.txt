# Many students drawn by entrepreneurship
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the depressed economy
has turned many graduating col
lege students to entrepreneur
ship, Stanford students in the
past and present have not need
ed this impetus to forge into the
business world.
A recent article in Newsweek
reported that with the faltering
economy, college students are
increasingly turning toward self
employment rather than trying
to find a job in the deflated job
market. However, Stanford stu
dents involved in business orga
nizations on campus said that
the University already has a
wide variety of organizations
that support and promote entre
preneurship.
One major campus organiza
tion concerned with this topic is
the Business Association of Stan
ford Engineering Students. The
group has two annual business
plan competitions: the E-chal
lenge, which offers a $40,000
prize, and, the Social E-chal
lenge, which offers a $20,000
prize.
One recent entrepreneurial
success story was the encryption
start-up identicrypt.com, con
ceived and created by Stanford
students, which won the BASES E
challenge and now has a Silicon
Valley start-up company.
"At Stanford, I got started in
entrepreneurship through
BASES," said management sci
ence and engineering coterminal
student Rajit Marwah. "The first
BASES event I attended was an
Entrepreneurial Thought Lead
ers Session, which brings world
class founders, entrepreneurs,
executives, venture capitalists
and authors to the School of En
gineering . . . The enthusiasm,
intelligence and vision of these
thought leaders were intoxicating
and I wanted to learn to dream
big like them and turn those
dreams into reality."
Marwah now heads the series
and recruits its speakers.

"A lot of Stanford students
have a dream of starting their
own company one day, not for
the sake of hitting it rich, but to
be in control of their own destiny
and change the world," he said.
"The bottom line is that Stanford
offers a variety of resources for
students interested in entrepre
neurship."
Of particular interest to many is
social entrepreneurship.
"Social entrepreneurship, broadly
defined, is the merging of the busi
ness and social sectors; it is either
for profit or nonprofit [and it] has
a mission of creating social im
pact," said Marina Kim, a sopho
more who is leading the BASES
Social E-Challenge. "Basically
you're bringing together the cre
ativity, vision and passion of entre
preneurship and also just putting
that to try and solve social prob
lems."
She added, "You don't have to
make a choice between making a
difference [and] making a profit,"
she said.
The University has a variety of
resources dedicated to social en
trepreneurship.
"Stanford is the leading univer
sity with the trend of social entre
preneurship," Kim said. "There
are classes in the undergraduate
[curriculum] and Business School,
which pretty much they don't have
anywhere else."
Seniors Kujtesa Bejtullahu and
George Michalopoulos have un
dertaken a "global" entrepreneur
ship enterprise.
"At the start of last fall, we start
ed with the idea of creating a
school for talented refugee youth,
where they would go fora couple
of years and then continue their
education at top universities,"
Michalopoulos said.
Their "turning point" in the
progress of the project was meet
ing in Geneva, Switzerland, with
members of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees,
who offered their support and
asked them to work in one of their
