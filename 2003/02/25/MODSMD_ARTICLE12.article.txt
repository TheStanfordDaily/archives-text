# Many students drawn by entrepreneurship
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the depressed economy
has turned many graduating col
lege students to entrepreneur
ship, Stanford students in the
past and present have not need
ed this impetus to forge into the
business world.
A recent article in Newsweek
reported that with the faltering
economy, college students are
increasingly turning toward self
employment rather than trying
to find a job in the deflated job
market. However, Stanford stu
dents involved in business orga
nizations on campus said that
the University already has a
wide variety of organizations
that support and promote entre
preneurship.
One major campus organiza
tion concerned with this topic is
the Business Association of Stan
ford Engineering Students. The
group has two annual business
plan competitions: the E-chal
lenge, which offers a $40,000
prize, and, the Social E-chal
lenge, which offers a $20,000
prize.
One recent entrepreneurial
success story was the encryption
start-up identicrypt.com, con
ceived and created by Stanford
students, which won the BASES E
challenge and now has a Silicon
Valley start-up company.
"At Stanford, I got started in
entrepreneurship through
BASES," said management sci
ence and engineering coterminal
student Rajit Marwah. "The first
BASES event I attended was an
Entrepreneurial Thought Lead
ers Session, which brings world
class founders, entrepreneurs,
executives, venture capitalists
and authors to the School of En
gineering . . . The enthusiasm,
intelligence and vision of these
thought leaders were intoxicating
and I wanted to learn to dream
big like them and turn those
dreams into reality."
Marwah now heads the series
and recruits its speakers.

"A lot of Stanford students
have a dream of starting their
own company one day, not for
the sake of hitting it rich, but to
be in control of their own destiny
and change the world," he said.
"The bottom line is that Stanford
offers a variety of resources for
students interested in entrepre
neurship."
Of particular interest to many is
social entrepreneurship.
"Social entrepreneurship, broadly
defined, is the merging of the busi
ness and social sectors; it is either
for profit or nonprofit [and it] has
a mission of creating social im
pact," said Marina Kim, a sopho
more who is leading the BASES
Social E-Challenge. "Basically
you're bringing together the cre
ativity, vision and passion of entre
preneurship and also just putting
that to try and solve social prob
lems."
She added, "You don't have to
make a choice between making a
difference [and] making a profit,"
she said.
The University has a variety of
resources dedicated to social en
trepreneurship.
"Stanford is the leading univer
sity with the trend of social entre
preneurship," Kim said. "There
are classes in the undergraduate
[curriculum] and Business School,
which pretty much they don't have
anywhere else."
Seniors Kujtesa Bejtullahu and
George Michalopoulos have un
dertaken a "global" entrepreneur
ship enterprise.
"At the start of last fall, we start
ed with the idea of creating a
school for talented refugee youth,
where they would go fora couple
of years and then continue their
education at top universities,"
Michalopoulos said.
Their "turning point" in the
progress of the project was meet
ing in Geneva, Switzerland, with
members of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees,
who offered their support and
asked them to work in one of their
camps.
"Our plan as it stands today is
to go to the UNHCR's Dukwi
refugee camp in Botswana and
work with youth [to] confront the
problem of inactivity, idleness
and boredom that [plague]
refugee camps around the
world . . . Stanford has been in

credibly influential in this whole
process," Michalopoulos said.
"First, we have been able to put
together a great team, paired
with incredibly supportive faculty
advisors such as [Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education] John
Bravman and [Management Sci
ence and Engineering Prof.]
Tom Byers."
According to some Stanford
students, finding a local job has
been a struggle.
"The job market is pretty bad.

Really bad, actually. About the
worst ever seen in Silicon Valley,"
said Garry Tan, president of Asia-
Pacific Student Entrepreneurship
Society. "All my job interviews are
all elsewhere in the country —
none in the Bay Area."
Kim concurred with this
evaluation.
"Venture capital has pretty
much shriveled up and died," she
said. "Student entrepreneurs
have to be incredibly creative in
how they get funding . . . They

have to look towards alternative
sources. People who are working
on projects here tend to be grad
uate students who have technolo
gy and patents, so they are more
likely to get venture capital —
undergrads have a very, very
tough time of it."
However, Kim said she sees an
upside to the depressed economy.
"Because of the economy it's
harder for entrepreneurs to get
funding, so on one hand it's harder
to get funding, [but on the other

hand] it's taking up the quality and
sophistication of the projects to get
funding — which means they'll be
better companies and last longer,"
she said.
Kim is also leading Youth Ven
ture, an organization that is trying
to involve underclassmen in social
entrepreneurship by providing 10
$1,000 grants to freshmen and
sophomores.
Other campus entrepreneurial
opportunities for students include
the Stanford Asia Technology Ini

dative, which provides funding for
students to do high-tech intern
ships in Asia while learning about
entrepreneurship.
As for an increase in Stanford's
entrepreneurial activities, most
students say there was never a lack
in the first place.
"Students are finding that this is
a viable career option," Kim said.
"[Stanford students] think big and
they want to make a big difference,
and I would say that has a lot to do
with the Stanford mentality.

BASES event I attended was an
Entrepreneurial Thought Lead
ers Session, which brings world
class founders, entrepreneurs,
executives, venture capitalists
and authors to the School of En

Marwah now heads the series

"A lot of Stanford students
have a dream of starting their
own company one day, not for
the sake of hitting it rich, but to
be in control of their own destiny
and change the world," he said.
"The bottom line is that Stanford
offers a variety of resources for
students interested in entrepre
neurship."
Of particular interest to many is
social entrepreneurship.
"Social entrepreneurship, broadly
defined, is the merging of the busi
ness and social sectors; it is either
for profit or nonprofit [and it] has
a mission of creating social im
pact," said Marina Kim, a sopho
more who is leading the BASES
Social E-Challenge. "Basically
you're bringing together the cre
ativity, vision and passion of entre
preneurship and also just putting
that to try and solve social prob
lems."
She added, "You don't have to
make a choice between making a
difference [and] making a profit,"
she said.
The University has a variety of
resources dedicated to social en
trepreneurship.
"Stanford is the leading univer
sity with the trend of social entre
preneurship," Kim said. "There
are classes in the undergraduate
[curriculum] and Business School,
which pretty much they don't have
anywhere else."
Seniors Kujtesa Bejtullahu and
George Michalopoulos have un
dertaken a "global" entrepreneur
ship enterprise.
"At the start of last fall, we start
ed with the idea of creating a
school for talented refugee youth,
where they would go fora couple
of years and then continue their
education at top universities,"
Michalopoulos said.
Their "turning point" in the
progress of the project was meet
ing in Geneva, Switzerland, with
members of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees,
who offered their support and
asked them to work in one of their
camps.
"Our plan as it stands today is
to go to the UNHCR's Dukwi
refugee camp in Botswana and
work with youth [to] confront the
problem of inactivity, idleness
and boredom that [plague]
refugee camps around the
world . . . Stanford has been in

credibly influential in this whole
process," Michalopoulos said.
"First, we have been able to put
together a great team, paired
with incredibly supportive faculty
advisors such as [Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education] John
Bravman and [Management Sci
ence and Engineering Prof.]
Tom Byers."
According to some Stanford
students, finding a local job has
been a struggle.
"The job market is pretty bad.

Really bad, actually. About the
worst ever seen in Silicon Valley,"
said Garry Tan, president of Asia-
Pacific Student Entrepreneurship
Society. "All my job interviews are
all elsewhere in the country —
none in the Bay Area."
Kim concurred with this
evaluation.
"Venture capital has pretty
much shriveled up and died," she
said. "Student entrepreneurs
have to be incredibly creative in
how they get funding . . . They

have to look towards alternative
sources. People who are working
on projects here tend to be grad
uate students who have technolo
gy and patents, so they are more
likely to get venture capital —
undergrads have a very, very
tough time of it."
However, Kim said she sees an
upside to the depressed economy.
"Because of the economy it's
harder for entrepreneurs to get
funding, so on one hand it's harder
to get funding, [but on the other

hand] it's taking up the quality and
sophistication of the projects to get
funding — which means they'll be
better companies and last longer,"
she said.
Kim is also leading Youth Ven
ture, an organization that is trying
to involve underclassmen in social
entrepreneurship by providing 10
$1,000 grants to freshmen and
sophomores.
Other campus entrepreneurial
opportunities for students include
the Stanford Asia Technology Ini

dative, which provides funding for
students to do high-tech intern
ships in Asia while learning about
entrepreneurship.
As for an increase in Stanford's
entrepreneurial activities, most
students say there was never a lack
in the first place.
"Students are finding that this is
a viable career option," Kim said.
"[Stanford students] think big and
they want to make a big difference,
and I would say that has a lot to do
with the Stanford mentality.
While the depressed economy
has turned many graduating col
lege students to entrepreneur
ship, Stanford students in the
past and present have not need
ed this impetus to forge into the
business world.
A recent article in Newsweek
reported that with the faltering
economy, college students are
increasingly turning toward self
employment rather than trying
to find a job in the deflated job
market. However, Stanford stu
dents involved in business orga
nizations on campus said that
the University already has a
wide variety of organizations
that support and promote entre
preneurship.
One major campus organiza
tion concerned with this topic is
the Business Association of Stan
ford Engineering Students. The
group has two annual business
plan competitions: the E-chal
lenge, which offers a $40,000
prize, and, the Social E-chal
lenge, which offers a $20,000
prize.
One recent entrepreneurial
success story was the encryption
start-up identicrypt.com, con
ceived and created by Stanford
students, which won the BASES E
challenge and now has a Silicon
Valley start-up company.
"At Stanford, I got started in
entrepreneurship through
BASES," said management sci
ence and engineering coterminal
student Rajit Marwah. "The first
BASES event I attended was an
Entrepreneurial Thought Lead
ers Session, which brings world
class founders, entrepreneurs,
executives, venture capitalists
