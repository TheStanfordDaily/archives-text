### 
NEW YORK (AP) —CBS
News' Dan Rather said hard
work and luck helped him land
his interview with Saddam
Hussein yesterday — the Iraqi
leader's first interview with a
foreign television journalist in
12 years.
CBS posted a report about
the interview on its Web site yes
terday afternoon, saying Sad
dam has challenged President
Bush to a live debate on their na
tions' differences.
It's the biggest interview
"get" of the year in television
news, one all the national news
organizations had been seeking.
Reached by telephone in Bagh
dad, Rather credited his execu
tive producer, Jim Murphy, and
foreign desk staffer Ana Real for
their work in securing it.
"It was a lot of hard work,
some team play and, yes, some
luck," he said.
Rather reported on the inter
view yesterday on the "CBS
Evening News." The full inter
view is to air in prime time to
morrow, on "60 Minutes II."
Rather has interviewed Sad
dam once before, in 1990. CBS
News also ran excerpts earlier
this month from Saddam's in
terview with Tony Benn, a re
tired British lawmaker who has
become a peace activist.
The anchorman was in Iraq

yesterday, hoping to secure the
interview, and was told at 8 a.m.
EST that Saddam was ready.
After two hours spent going
through security, Rather and
Murphy met Saddam.
Rather said the fact of his pre
vious Saddam interview proba
bly helped him secure this one.
Competitor Peter Jennings of
ABC News also interviewed Sad
dam in 1990, while NBC's Tom
Brokaw has not.
"We made a point of saying to
him that we keep our word,"
Rather said. "We do what we say
we will do and won't do what we
say we won't do. They came out
of that with the experience that
we are who we say we are."
CBS acknowledged that for
mer U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, who is promi
nent in the global anti-war
movement and met with Sad
dam on Sunday, put in a good
word for Rather in helping se
cure the interview.
Clark has known Rather fora
long time, said CBS News
spokeswoman Sandra Genelius.
In a competitive situation seek
ing an interview, journalists call
on many resources, she said.
Rather did not anticipate any
criticism from supporters of a po
tential war with Iraq who might
be upset that he's talking with the
nation's potential enemy.
