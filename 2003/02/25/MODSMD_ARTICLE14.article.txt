ANKARA Turkey (AP) — Turkey's Cabinet
agreed yesterday to host tens of thousands of
U.S. combat troops fora possible Iraq war, a cru
cial step in realizing an American strategy' that
calls fora two-front attack that would surround
and divide the forces of Saddam Hussein.
Eoreign Minister Yasar Yakis said Turkish
and U.S. officials are still negotiating the agree
ment and that a vote by parliament — which
could come as early as today — could be de
layed until the terms are finalized.
Washington has been pressing Turkey to
approve the deployment. U.S. ships are waiting
off the coast of Turkey to unload supplies for
the 4th Infantry Division, which would lead an
armored thrust from Turkey into northern
Iraq if there is a war.
Turkey's public is overwhelmingly against a
war and there has been strong opposition
among legislators to allowing U.S. troops to use
their territory to launch an attack.
However, the deputy chairman of the Justice
and Development Party, which has a large ma
jority, said he expected parliamentary approval.
The Cabinet motion calls on parliament to
allow the deployment of U.S. troops and au
thorize Turkish soldiers to enter Iraq.
The negotiating deadlock was broken late
last week, when Washington offered Turkey $5
billion in aid and $ 10 billion in loans to cushion

the Turkish economy from the effects of war,
diplomats said.
Washington wants to use Turkey to open a
northern front in a war in Iraq, a strategy that
would divide the Iraqi army between an ar

mored attack in the north and a thrust from the
Persian Gulf.
Tens of thousands of Turkish troops are
expected to cross into northern Iraq if there
is a war.
