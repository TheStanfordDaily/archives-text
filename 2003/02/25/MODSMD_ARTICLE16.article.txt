Editorial

Doctors at Duke University Hospi
tal delivered grim news on Satur
day: Jesica Santillan — an opti
mistic 17-year-old who only a few
days ago believed she would receive a life
saving transplant— had died. Santillan
was the unfortunate victim of a medical
mishap in which she received a heart and
lung transplant of the wrong blood type
and then had to undergo a second trans
plant, which proved to be unsuccessful.
Her death is a reminder that even prac
titioners of one of the most highly esteemed
professions, medicine, can make irre
versible mistakes. Doctors that make such
mistakes are not entirely at fault. Today,
most physicians are overworked and face
intense pressure from a demanding health
care system. Even the most caring practi
tioners can make an error.
Yet this does not absolve the medical
community from ignoring these problems.
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released

a striking report, "To
Err Is Human: Build
ing a Safer Health Sys
tem," which reported
that medical errors in
hospitals resulting in
deaths were estimated
to be between 44,000
and 98,000 per year.
The numbers are
surprising not only

because they are high, but also because,
unlike the media frenzy that brought light
to this distressing recent heart and lung
transplant case, most Americans are not
aware of the many mistakes made by the
medical community. This lack of commu
nication and admittance of responsibility
illustrates a significant lack of important
ethical discussion among physicians.
Santillan's death — along with the many
medical errors that prove to be ultimately
fatal — are reminders that doctors and sci
entists bear an immense responsibility on
their shoulders. As breakthrough medical
research continues to provide major scien
tific and technological advances that
promise to revolutionize the field of
medicine, all citizens must at the same time
remember that even the most flawless sci
entific theory can be botched at the hands of
an overworked or fatigued medical profes
sional. Humans are fundamentally imper
fect, yet in order to overcome mistakes, it is
necessary to directly address them.
The Duke University Hospital physi
cians and administrators are currently de
veloping a policy to prevent ovgan trans
plant errors from happening in the future,

"For pre-med students — and for the
future patients of these aspiring doc
tors — discussing and assessing ethi
cal issues in medicine should be an
important consideration."

but the tact remains that many of the deci
sions made throughout Santillan's case
have been questionable. For example,
while most people agree that the hospital
made a grievous error in the first trans
plant, some question whether Santillan
should have received a second transplant
over a patient who might have been higher
on the next waiting list. Doctors made a de
cision in the short, critical window of time
Santillan's doctors had before her body
mounted a serious immune response to
the organs, but perhaps more people
would have felt better about the choices
had these types of ethical issues been dis
cussed beforehand and if a structured pol
icy existed for the compensation of medical
blunders.
Obviously, not every scenario can be an
ticipated, but certainly in this case the mat
ter of error retribution should have been
previously addressed. Moreover, the public
needs to be made aware of hospital policies

so that patients can ex
pect a certain course of
treatment. A doctor
patient relationship re
lies on trust and com
munication, and cur
rent and future physi
cians must address the
inevitable in order to
gain the full trust of
their patients.

Each year, nearly 50 percent of incom
ing Stanford freshmen consider taking
the pre-med track. While many students
eventually decide to pursue other inter
ests and other majors, there are still a sub
stantial number of students on campus
that will go on to apply and matriculate in
a medical school. For these students —
and for the future patients of these aspir
ing doctors — discussing and assessing
ethical issues in medicine should be an im
portant consideration. We urge students
to become aware of and consider ethical
issues as they pursue their academic and
professional careers — both by taking
classes that address these matters and by
taking the initiative to investigate current
medical practices and mistakes.
We are confident that Stanford stu
dents will one day make excellent doctors
and we hope that they will take these im
portant ethical discussions and experi
ences along with them into their practice.
Medicine will never be perfect, but by
learning from past mistakes and address
ing these difficult ethical questions, at least
as a society, we can be sure that we are
doing our best.
