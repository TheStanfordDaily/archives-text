# LYING IN THE GRASS
## AIM-less Addictions 
### 
You think your roommate
is a weirdo? My previous
one had only three peo
ple on his Yahoo instant
messenger buddy list. For no ap
parent reason, his brother and the
German guy were almost always
blocked, leaving only one buddy
active: himself. Nevertheless, he
was signed on without fail, as if he
feared losing his presence in the
online world.
I'd crack jokes at his expense,
but really, I wasn't much better off
— in the other room, AOL Instant
Messenger, AIM, would be run
ning at the very moment I'd be
making fun of him. Hypocritical
indeed.
AIM is no longer a casual chan
nel of communication. It's a valid
addiction, right up there with
money and porn. A pleasurable
vice, AIM eats away at your pre
cious time while contributing to
the diminishment of your mental
and physical faculties (like
mommy said, you should be exer
cising and reading Plato). I'm a
certified addict. I love the endor
phin surge after kicking somebody
off my list. Hell, 1 have to sign off to
ensure my online counter doesn't
start running on into days. Fortu
nately, some of my friends are ad
dicts also — I can go on at 5 a.m.
and find a sympathetic buddy who
shares my addiction.
AlM's become too entrenched
in college culture to merely be la
beled a social phenomenon. It has
single-handedly improved typing
speeds and replaced the television
as the primary source of procrasti
nation. Nerds, with our hopefully
sharper wit, finally have an arena
where we can outperform jocks.
And through drunken confession
als, it's become a portal where we
can spill out any long-harbored

emotions — and where our best
friends, with a flurry ofcutting and
pasting, can follow right along.
I'd even go so far as to say that
AIM, with its unique lexicon (Y
aren't u LOL? I wasj/k about ur gf)
and etiquette rules (who will IM
whom first?), should be consid
ered an institution.
Part of AlM's allure is the sense
of individualism and anonymity it

bestows upon its
millions of users.
Each screen name
is unique, a com
bination of mean
ingful words and
numbers —or at
least a compro
mise with the
AOL database

that hasn't already been stolen.
The user gets to select the text font
(her online voice) and ponder a
profile that is simultaneously en
tertaining and reflective of her life
values.
The user also has sole control
over whom he wants to chat with.
Some buddy lists max out at a 100-
plus, their owners utilizing them as
veritable social barometers. Others
prefer secret societies, carefully
adding and deleting buddies to
their heart's content. Or they
straddle the fence, using two dif
ferent screen names.
This is the best bet. One name
can remain public, nakedly ex
posed for everybody's viewing
pleasure. The other acts as an un
dercover alter ego, the one where
the user can spy on others and
check who's on without the embar
rassment of signing off after one
minute. He just has to make sure
his secret screen names remain
clandestine that he doesn't
form any super-exclusive lists.
Trust me, friends whom don't

make it and find out will get pissed
oft.
AIM is often the easiest way to
keep in touch with friends and al
lows you to pester an acquaintance
that you'd feel awkward calling.
There's nary a formality; nor is
there a feeling of remembered
consequence, as with writing an e
mail. Vet as these virtual ties
strengthen, the real-time interac
tions, the true yardstick of friend
ship, weaken. Sure, the other guy's
a riot to chat with online. But if you
pass by him in the Quad and can't
keep up a minute-long conversa
tion, should he really be consid
ered a friend?
When we're looking to place
blame for this insidious waste of
time, we can find the culprit right
at the top: ex-AOL president
Stephen Case, multi-billionaire
and monopoly-builder extraordi
naire. We thought we were so
conniving, downloading AIM
without pulling a single penny
from our pockets. But all along,
Case knew that we would get
hooked, shooting up whenever
we turned on our computers. And
from all the advertising on AIM,
he's still making truckloads of
money along the way.
After Bell invented the tele
phone, skeptics of the time warned
that human interaction would take
a turn for the worse. Fortunately,
their beliefs proved false. If any
thing, we've become more social as
a result. I hope the current critics,
harping online communication as
the newest social isolator, will also
be wrong. But the telephone
didn't come equipped with per
sonalized buddy icons.

Tell me your screen name at
rfeng@stanford.edu. I promise to IM
you first.
