Peace rally attendees are not
'anti-American'
In a the "200,000 gather to protest war
against Iraq" article that appeared in The
Daily on Feb. 18, the president of the Stan
ford College Republicans was quoted as
saying, "Anti-war rallies only draw those
who are already die-hard pacifist, pro-
Saddam or anti-American or anti-Israeli."
As citizens of the United States, who care
deeply for the well being of all the people of
our country as well as those of other coun
tries, we find it appalling to be called "anti-
American" or "pro-Saddam" for the mere
fact that we attended a rally aimed to en
courage peace and nonviolent behavior.
What's more we find such comments to
be very misrepresentative of what the peace
rally represented. Those of us who attend
ed the rally are dissatisfied with the present
actions of our government, but that does
not imply in any logical way that we are
"anti-American" or "pro-Saddam." In fact,
having personally attended the rally, we ob
served a strong feeling of "Americanism."
As U.S. citizens who embrace peace and
view war only as the very last resort we find
it offensive when people say that we are

spreading "an anti-American message."
Can we not be both peaceful and Ameri
can? We sincerely hope so.

Need fora 'balanced perspective'
With regards to the article "Signees ques
tion use of Pro-Israel ad," (Feb. 24) I would
like to echo the sentiments of Jenny Lee and
Josh Benson. The Stanford Israel Alliance
representative who asked me to sign the pe
tition told me up front that the petition
would be printed in the Daily and probably
sent to members of Congress. The petition
even stated very clearly that the names in
the petition would appear in print.
Those who felt misled by The Daily ad
vertisement most likely did not read
through the petition, and the alliance
should not be blamed for this.
Furthermore, I must question the in
tent behind The Daily's article on the pro-
Israel petition, considering that The Daily
has never bothered to investigate how the

anti-war protests may have misled stu
dents. I know several students, who are
both anti-war and pro-Israel, who attend
what is advertised as a protest against war
with Iraq, only to encounter speakers who
attack Israel and the U.S.-Israel relation
ship. Although protesting war with Iraq
has remained the primary purpose of
these protests, the attempts by some to
completely intertwine this issue with the
Israel-Palestinian debate have made the
anti-war, pro-Israel students feci uncom
fortable at these rallies.
With the numerous protests that have
occurred, one wonders why The Daily has
never focused on how the protests could
possibly mislead people, instead devoting
an article to how a single pro-Israel peti
tion supposedly deceived students. Per
haps this can be traced to The Daily's own
unflinching support for the anti-war
movement. In the future, I hope that The
Daily provides a more balanced perspec
tive, regardless of its own viewpoints.

Stanford Rugby shows true
sportsmanship
Few people traveled to Berkeley on

Saturday to watch the rugby match for
the Scrum Axe, and it was unfortunate.
Who won was never seriously in ques
tion, but the big news was that the
ridicule Stanford had endured about the
match was put soundly to rest. The audi
ence was stunned into thoughtful silence
at the sight of Stanford's First XV play
ing courageously.
Losing a lopsided match in rugby is
not like losing one in tennis or swim
ming. It's brutal, it's painful, and it's no
fun.
Yet the Stanford side fought on re
lentlessly. Nobody hung their heads;
nobody yelled lamely encouraging
things to each other; nobody looked
plaintively to the stands for the encour
agement that wasn't there. And I didn't
see a single player leave for injuries.
They just kept at it, tackling, driving
and picking themselves up time and
time again. Rugby dynasties come and
go, and there's no telling when Stan
ford's will rise to national number one
again, but I think on Saturday we saw
the beginning. Great job, guys. You
brought honor to yourselves and the
University and the entire rugby com
munity is proud of you.
