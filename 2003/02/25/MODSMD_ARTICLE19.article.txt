# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Campaign seeks to separate politics from Hoover Institution 
### CALVIN MIAW KATE SKOLNICK STANFORD COMMUNITY FOR PEACE JUSTICE 
We would like to thank Alex Kendall
and Elizabeth Madjlessi for taking the time
to address the ongoing campaign to re
form the Hoover Institution. We will reply
to their points on the issue.
First, Kendall and Madjlessi concede
that the institution adopts a pro-limited
government stance in its mission state
ment and its hiring practices (which the
mission statement guides). They do not
see this stance as problematic, however,
because it does not translate into screening
potential candidates according their party
affiliation ("you have to be Republican to
work here") or according to extreme
right-wing views ("you must be to the right
of Hitler to set foot in this building").
Although we agree that the institution's
political goal of limited government does
not exclude fellows because of their party
membership 01 because they are not ex
treme right-wingers, we contend that the
institution's stance on limited government
does have some political significance. A
quote from the "Founding Principles" sec
tion of the Hoover Institution's 2000 An
nual Report says:

"Evaluating and advancing sensible
market-based solutions to public policy
problems is an underpinning of the phi
losophy of Hoover scholars, who will con
tinue to advance the principles of private
enterprise and economic freedom for
decades to come."
The problem, as we see it, is that the in
stitution takes into account an individual's
political views as one factor among many
(including academic merit) in its appoint
ment process. A scholar who declares him
self or herself against the principle of lim
ited government will have a harder time
getting appointed to a Hoover Fellowship
than a scholar of equal achievement who is
sympathetic to the institution's political
goals. On a university campus, this should
not be the case. It is a violation of academ
ic freedom, as we have stated on these
pages before.
Ihe columnists then claim that
" Hoover does not have control over its fel
lows' political views or beliefs." We have
never claimed to the contrary. Kendall
and Madjlessi then cite one fellow's oppo
sition to the Bush tax plan as evidence of
diversity of opinion within Hoover. This
is entirely compatible with the existence of
institutional bias. For instance, if Hoover
required fellows to be members of the
Democratic Party, we would recognize

this without question as inappropriate in
stitutional bias. However, on a specific
issue we would nonetheless expect a
range of opinions.
However, we do charge that the
Hoover Institution provides institutional
support for research with political goals.
The introduction to the 2000 Annual Re
port describes one research initiative as a
scholarly effort that will "ensure that
mankind will not again be tempted by the
false Utopian promises of this malignant
ideology [of communism]." This is as in
appropriate for the University to officially
sponsor as a research initiative that hopes
to convince mankind of the accuracy of
communist ideology.
Furthermore, our campaign is mistak
enly characterized as an effort to kick
Hoover Institution off campus, while re
taining the archives. Our first and foremost
demand has always been that Hoover
change its mission statement. We too rec
ognize the institution as a tremendous re
source and would not like to lose it. Howev
er, if Hoover is unwilling to eliminate its ex
plicit political goals, we do not feel that it has
a place on campus. As to the question of the
archives, I would merely like to indicate
that the Hoover library and archives exist
ed for 48 years before the institution was es
tablished in 1959. Retaining possession,

then, does not seem inconceivable.
Kendall and Madjlessi also discuss the
issue of the Hoover Institution's influence
upon academic departments with a large
number of faculty who hold joint appoint
ments at Hoover. Morris Fiorina's creden
tials and teaching ability are praised as well as
those of the other joint appointees, and this
constitutes their counterargument to any al
legation of "corrupting" influence via the
practice of joint appointments. Of course,
none of us has ever impugned any of the
joint appointees' credentials. All of them un
dergo the same scrutiny in the hiring process
as any other faculty appointment. The issue
of joint appointments is complicated and we
are still pursuing it. To us, though, it does not
seem unreasonable to state that the depart
ment may be influenced because it can use
the institution's resources to acquire and re
tain faculty that Hoover would also appoint
as fellows. The actual influence in terms of
the department's intellectual profile is still
under consideration.
The authors also assert that we "desper
ately chant" fora "left-wing monologue"
within the department. No member of SCPJ
recalls ever chanting for an absence of de
bate; indeed, our discussion list has recently
seen vigorous discussion among supporters
and opponents of a pre-emptive strike.
Perhaps the most important point in the

column is the relationship between a cam
paign to reform the Hoover Institution and
the anti-war movement. In the past, we
have incorrectly stated that there are seven
members on the 31-person Defense Policy
Board that advises Rumsfeld — there are
actually eight. Although we defend the
right of individuals at the University to help
formulate policy, we assert that the involve
ment of Hoover Fellows in the formulation
of war policy is not a coincidence. It is pre
cisely to those institutions that promote lim
ited government that the administration
would look to for ideological support in de
signing its policy, whether international or
domestic. Of course, you need not take our
word for it — the Feb. 13 Economist article
"The Charge of the Think-Tanks" draws
the same conclusion.
We thus do not feel that the "radicalism"
of the Hoover campaign reduces the "effi
cacy" of the anti-war movement. Efficacy is
about effecting change, and we feel that the
Hoover campaign provides an opportunity
for students to concretely change the struc
tures that connect them to war policy.

tinue to advance the principles of private
enterprise and economic freedom for
decades to come."
The problem, as we see it, is that the in
stitution takes into account an individual's
political views as one factor among many
(including academic merit) in its appoint
ment process. A scholar who declares him
self or herself against the principle of lim
ited government will have a harder time
getting appointed to a Hoover Fellowship
than a scholar of equal achievement who is
sympathetic to the institution's political
goals. On a university campus, this should
not be the case. It is a violation of academ
ic freedom, as we have stated on these
pages before.
Ihe columnists then claim that
" Hoover does not have control over its fel
lows' political views or beliefs." We have
never claimed to the contrary. Kendall
and Madjlessi then cite one fellow's oppo
sition to the Bush tax plan as evidence of
diversity of opinion within Hoover. This
is entirely compatible with the existence of
institutional bias. For instance, if Hoover
required fellows to be members of the
Democratic Party, we would recognize

this without question as inappropriate in
stitutional bias. However, on a specific
issue we would nonetheless expect a
range of opinions.
However, we do charge that the
Hoover Institution provides institutional
support for research with political goals.
The introduction to the 2000 Annual Re
port describes one research initiative as a
scholarly effort that will "ensure that
mankind will not again be tempted by the
false Utopian promises of this malignant
ideology [of communism]." This is as in
appropriate for the University to officially
sponsor as a research initiative that hopes
to convince mankind of the accuracy of
communist ideology.
Furthermore, our campaign is mistak
enly characterized as an effort to kick
Hoover Institution off campus, while re
taining the archives. Our first and foremost
demand has always been that Hoover
change its mission statement. We too rec
ognize the institution as a tremendous re
source and would not like to lose it. Howev
er, if Hoover is unwilling to eliminate its ex
plicit political goals, we do not feel that it has
a place on campus. As to the question of the
archives, I would merely like to indicate
that the Hoover library and archives exist
ed for 48 years before the institution was es
tablished in 1959. Retaining possession,

then, does not seem inconceivable.
Kendall and Madjlessi also discuss the
issue of the Hoover Institution's influence
upon academic departments with a large
number of faculty who hold joint appoint
ments at Hoover. Morris Fiorina's creden
tials and teaching ability are praised as well as
those of the other joint appointees, and this
constitutes their counterargument to any al
legation of "corrupting" influence via the
practice of joint appointments. Of course,
none of us has ever impugned any of the
joint appointees' credentials. All of them un
dergo the same scrutiny in the hiring process
as any other faculty appointment. The issue
of joint appointments is complicated and we
are still pursuing it. To us, though, it does not
seem unreasonable to state that the depart
ment may be influenced because it can use
the institution's resources to acquire and re
tain faculty that Hoover would also appoint
as fellows. The actual influence in terms of
the department's intellectual profile is still
under consideration.
The authors also assert that we "desper
ately chant" fora "left-wing monologue"
within the department. No member of SCPJ
recalls ever chanting for an absence of de
bate; indeed, our discussion list has recently
seen vigorous discussion among supporters
and opponents of a pre-emptive strike.
Perhaps the most important point in the

column is the relationship between a cam
paign to reform the Hoover Institution and
the anti-war movement. In the past, we
have incorrectly stated that there are seven
members on the 31-person Defense Policy
Board that advises Rumsfeld — there are
actually eight. Although we defend the
right of individuals at the University to help
formulate policy, we assert that the involve
ment of Hoover Fellows in the formulation
of war policy is not a coincidence. It is pre
cisely to those institutions that promote lim
ited government that the administration
would look to for ideological support in de
signing its policy, whether international or
domestic. Of course, you need not take our
word for it — the Feb. 13 Economist article
"The Charge of the Think-Tanks" draws
the same conclusion.
We thus do not feel that the "radicalism"
of the Hoover campaign reduces the "effi
cacy" of the anti-war movement. Efficacy is
about effecting change, and we feel that the
Hoover campaign provides an opportunity
for students to concretely change the struc
tures that connect them to war policy.

We would like to thank Alex Kendall
and Elizabeth Madjlessi for taking the time
to address the ongoing campaign to re
form the Hoover Institution. We will reply
to their points on the issue.
First, Kendall and Madjlessi concede
that the institution adopts a pro-limited
government stance in its mission state
ment and its hiring practices (which the
mission statement guides). They do not
see this stance as problematic, however,
because it does not translate into screening
potential candidates according their party
affiliation ("you have to be Republican to
work here") or according to extreme
right-wing views ("you must be to the right
of Hitler to set foot in this building").
Although we agree that the institution's
political goal of limited government does
not exclude fellows because of their party
membership 01 because they are not ex
treme right-wingers, we contend that the
institution's stance on limited government
does have some political significance. A
quote from the "Founding Principles" sec
tion of the Hoover Institution's 2000 An
nual Report says:

"Evaluating and advancing sensible
market-based solutions to public policy
problems is an underpinning of the phi
losophy of Hoover scholars, who will con
tinue to advance the principles of private
enterprise and economic freedom for
decades to come."
The problem, as we see it, is that the in
stitution takes into account an individual's
political views as one factor among many
(including academic merit) in its appoint
ment process. A scholar who declares him
self or herself against the principle of lim
