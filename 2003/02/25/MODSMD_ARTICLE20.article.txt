## Tennis not satisfied with fifth 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford men's ten
nis team (6-2) took away a mixed
bag of feelings from this past week
end's USTA/ITA National Team
Indoor Championships in
Lousiville, Ky. The Cardinal beat
two highly ranked opponents and
finished in a tie for fifth place, but
it failed to reach the tournament's
semifinals for the first time in
seven years.
"Overall, we have an OK feeling
coming out of this tournament,"
associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "Any time we go
to a tournament like this and don't
win it, it's disappointing. But it's
early in the season and we've got a
long way to go. Now the guys know
where the bar is set, so we can work
towards that."
The beginning of the tourna
ment was auspicious for the Cardi
nal. Stanford trounced No. 9 Ken
tucky (6-3) 4-0.

pionships, La Jolla, Friday-Sunday

Stanford quickly won the dou
bles point to take a 1-0 lead. On
court one, senior Ail-Americans
David Martin and Scott Lipsky
(N0.3) cruised to an 8-4 victory
while freshmen KC Corkery and
James Fade (No. 9) won 8-5 on
court three.
In singles, the Cardinal over
whelmed the Wildcats. Martin (No.
15), Corkery (No. 50) and sopho
more Sam Warburg (No. 52) post
ed convincing straight-set victories
at the second, fourth and sixth line
up positions, respectively. Senior
Ail-American Ryan Haviland, Lip
sky and Fade did not finish their
matches because once one team tal
lies four points in the team tourna
ment format, the remaining match
es do not finish.
"We were really good against
Kentucky," Whitlinger said. "Our

four, five and six guys gave one of
the best performances I've ever
seen. They were dominating."
Stanford's next match was a
completely different story. In Fri
day's quaterfinal, the Cardinal lost
decisively to No. 3 Baylor (9-1), 4-0.
The Cardinal lost the doubles
point for the first time all year.
Warburg and senior All-American
Ryan Haviland lost 8-3 on court
two while Corkery and Fade lost 8-
4 on court three.
Baylor's daunting singles lineup
features three players ranked
among the top 23 in the country, in
cluding No. 1 Benedikt Dorsch.
Martin played Dorsch evenly to 5-5
in the first set, but Dorsch con
trolled the remainder of the match,
eventually winning 7-5,6-1.
James Fade and Sam Warburg
also suffered straight-set losses.
Fade lost to Baylor's Reiner Neu
rohr 6-4,6-1 and Warburg lost 6-3,
6-0 to Ivor Lovrak.
