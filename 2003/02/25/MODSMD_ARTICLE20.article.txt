## Tennis not satisfied with fifth 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford men's ten
nis team (6-2) took away a mixed
bag of feelings from this past week
end's USTA/ITA National Team
Indoor Championships in
Lousiville, Ky. The Cardinal beat
two highly ranked opponents and
finished in a tie for fifth place, but
it failed to reach the tournament's
semifinals for the first time in
seven years.
"Overall, we have an OK feeling
coming out of this tournament,"
associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "Any time we go
to a tournament like this and don't
win it, it's disappointing. But it's
early in the season and we've got a
long way to go. Now the guys know
where the bar is set, so we can work
towards that."
The beginning of the tourna
ment was auspicious for the Cardi
nal. Stanford trounced No. 9 Ken
tucky (6-3) 4-0.

pionships, La Jolla, Friday-Sunday

Stanford quickly won the dou
bles point to take a 1-0 lead. On
court one, senior Ail-Americans
David Martin and Scott Lipsky
(N0.3) cruised to an 8-4 victory
while freshmen KC Corkery and
James Fade (No. 9) won 8-5 on
court three.
In singles, the Cardinal over
whelmed the Wildcats. Martin (No.
15), Corkery (No. 50) and sopho
more Sam Warburg (No. 52) post
ed convincing straight-set victories
at the second, fourth and sixth line
up positions, respectively. Senior
Ail-American Ryan Haviland, Lip
sky and Fade did not finish their
matches because once one team tal
lies four points in the team tourna
ment format, the remaining match
es do not finish.
"We were really good against
Kentucky," Whitlinger said. "Our

four, five and six guys gave one of
the best performances I've ever
seen. They were dominating."
Stanford's next match was a
completely different story. In Fri
day's quaterfinal, the Cardinal lost
decisively to No. 3 Baylor (9-1), 4-0.
The Cardinal lost the doubles
point for the first time all year.
Warburg and senior All-American
Ryan Haviland lost 8-3 on court
two while Corkery and Fade lost 8-
4 on court three.
Baylor's daunting singles lineup
features three players ranked
among the top 23 in the country, in
cluding No. 1 Benedikt Dorsch.
Martin played Dorsch evenly to 5-5
in the first set, but Dorsch con
trolled the remainder of the match,
eventually winning 7-5,6-1.
James Fade and Sam Warburg
also suffered straight-set losses.
Fade lost to Baylor's Reiner Neu
rohr 6-4,6-1 and Warburg lost 6-3,
6-0 to Ivor Lovrak.

At the National Team Indoors last weekend, 46th-ranked senior Scott Lipsky posted a singles win at the No. 3 spot,
lifting the Cardinal to a 4-2 win over Texas A&M and fifth overall.
"My singles opponent was tall
and powerful and his style of play is
completely suited to an indoor sur
face," Warburg said. "Everything
he was hitting was coming through
the court low and quick, and I was
pretty much scrambling the entire
match. It was super frustrating."
Warburg's frustration was em
blematic of the feelings of the en
tire team.
"Baylor's a very good team,"
Whitlinger said. "We got beat pret
ty good. It was an eye-opener be
cause we played so well the day be
fore. II we played them again down
the road, I have absolute confi
dence that we could beat them."
Baylor lost to eventual champi
on Illinois in the semifinals. Illinois
will replace UCLA as the nation's
new No. 1 when the new rankings
are released today.
On Saturday, Stanford beat the
No. 18 Texas A&M (6-5) Aggies 4-
2 in a consolation match to tie for
fifth place.

Perhaps feeling the aftereffects
of the Baylor loss, Stanford began
the match by losing the doubles
point for the second straight day.
But the Cardinal recovered, win
ning at singles positions three
through six.
"The match against Texas
A&M was an important win,"
Whit linger said. "To leave
Louisville with two wins instead of
one is a big difference."
One thing the tournament ac
complished was to reveal to the
Cardinal what it needs to work on
to improve.
"VVe have some question marks
coming out of this tournament,"
Whitlinger said. "Going in, we felt
like our doubles was one of our big
ger strengths, but that went belly
up. That's why La Jolla is coming
up at the right time. VVe need the
doubles practice."
The Cardinal will send four
tandems to compete in the Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament this
weekend in Lajolla, Ca. But before
that, Stanford returns to action
today against unranked Utah (3-4)
at the Tan be Family Tennis Center
at 1:30 p.m.
