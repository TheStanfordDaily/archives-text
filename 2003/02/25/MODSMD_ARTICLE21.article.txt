# Women crowned MPSF champs

### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
How does a track team cap off a stellar
season during which five school records
have been broken and 12 athletes have met
at least the provisional qualifying times for
the NCAA Indoor National Champi
onships?
It's simple. Just dethrone one of the most
dominant track programs in recent history
behind a balanced attack from the sprint,
field and distance squads.
And that's exactly what the No. 7 Stan
ford women did to No. 3 UCLA this week
end at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Indoor Championships. The No. 6
men's team, competing without several of
its top middle-distance and distance run
ners, still managed second behind UCLA's
nationally recognized men's squad.
"The women maximized all possibilities
in the meet," said Yin Lananna, director of
cross country and track and field. "I believe
we were able to score in every event in which
we had entered an athlete. The men were
equally impressive in most areas and much
improved in the sprints and hurdles."
The women's squad received five first
place finishes while the men had three.
The distance squad led the men as junior-
Louis Luchini claimed victories in the 3,000
and 5,000 with times of 8 minutes, 12.21
seconds and 14:13.13, respectively, while
leading a 1-3-4-5-7 finish in the 5,000 that
resulted in 27 valuable points for the Cardi
nal.
"Luchini was outstanding, holding off
late charges by Robert Cheseret of Arizona
in the 3k and 5k," Lananna said.
Junior Seth Hejny claimed the mile title
in 4:05.29.
In the women's 5,000, redshirt freshman

Alicia Craig and senior Lauren Fleshman
cruised to a 1-2 finish in the fourth
(16:05.24) and fifth (16:05.27) fastest times
in the nation this year.
"Coach Lananna wanted us to run the
race similar to a workout," Craig said. "And
that's exactly how it felt: conservative, ag
gressive and controlled. It made such a dif
ference having Lauren to work with
throughout the race."
Sophomore Jeane Goff continued a stel
lar indoor season with a victory in the 3,000
(9:40.40) while senior Malindi Elmore
claimed first in the mile in 4:42.00.
Both teams received support from the
field squads as well as Jillian Camarena won
the shot put over defending national cham
pion Jessica Crosby of UCLA. Her throw of
55 feet, 6.50 inches is third in the nation.
And seniors Milton Little and Nick Weli
hozkiy hit the provisional mark in the long
jump and weight throw with their respec
tive second and third-place finishes.
"I hope my distance will take me to the
NCAAs," Welihozkiy said. "It's difficult and
sometimes bittersweet when you throw a
season best and do not win. Which would be
better? In this case, I have to go with the sea
son best, and I am satisfied with that for this
past weekend."
The women also got a pair of second
place finishes from junior Jessica Pluth in
the weight throw and sophomore Undine
Becker in the longjump.
Freshman Jakki Bailey led the women's
sprint team with a second-place finish in the
60 (7.49) and a fourth-place finish in the 200
(24.13). She was followed closely by team
mates freshmen Ashley Purnell and
Chauntae Bayne in both events.
In the 400, freshman Nashonme John-

also a part of the winning 1,600-
meter relay team that included
Bayne, Purnell and sophomore
Christine Moschella.
Senior Milton Little posted a
6.88 60-meter and finished sixth to
break freshman TJ Rushing's week
old school record. Rushing re

sponded with sixth place, 21.72 sec
ond 200-meter that put him at No.
2 all time in the school record books.
Sophomore Nick Sebes placed
fourth in the 400-meter in 48 flat.

and six women who have met the
automatic standards in eight
events either as an individual or as
part of a relay. An additional six.
