### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
If the performance of the No. 1 Cardinal men's
swimming team last Saturday against No. 3 California
is any indication of what is likely to happen in the post
season, the team should be in perfect position to cap
ture the national title at the NCAA Championships
next month. In the process of overpowering its rival
173-112, Stanford (8-0, 4-0 Pacific-10) swam away
with five pool records and a wealth of impressive in
dividual accomplishments.

The Cardinal won 11 of the 15 events and estab
lished new pool records at Cal in the 100 and 200
back, the 100 and 200 breast and the 200 individual
medley.
"We are definitely excited about the outcome of
the meet," senior co-captain Dan Westcott said. "It's
always been a fast meet, with both teams competing at
a very high level. Cal took some liberties and the
coaches ran the meet to their liking â€”they had a
huge crowd and ran the show exactly how they want
ed to. 1 think that as a team, though, we really came in
prepared and stepped up to the challenges they cre
ated."
Junior Peter Marshall opened the meet with a win
and a record in the 100 back, bettering the existing
pool record set in 1995 by Stanford swimmer Brian
Retterer. Marshall's time 0f46.25 seconds was an au
tomatic qualifying time for the NCAA championships.
