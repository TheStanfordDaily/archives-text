## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
If the performance of the No. 1 Cardinal men's
swimming team last Saturday against No. 3 California
is any indication of what is likely to happen in the post
season, the team should be in perfect position to cap
ture the national title at the NCAA Championships
next month. In the process of overpowering its rival
173-112, Stanford (8-0, 4-0 Pacific-10) swam away
with five pool records and a wealth of impressive in
dividual accomplishments.

The Cardinal won 11 of the 15 events and estab
lished new pool records at Cal in the 100 and 200
back, the 100 and 200 breast and the 200 individual
medley.
"We are definitely excited about the outcome of
the meet," senior co-captain Dan Westcott said. "It's
always been a fast meet, with both teams competing at
a very high level. Cal took some liberties and the
coaches ran the meet to their liking —they had a
huge crowd and ran the show exactly how they want
ed to. 1 think that as a team, though, we really came in
prepared and stepped up to the challenges they cre
ated."
Junior Peter Marshall opened the meet with a win
and a record in the 100 back, bettering the existing
pool record set in 1995 by Stanford swimmer Brian
Retterer. Marshall's time 0f46.25 seconds was an au
tomatic qualifying time for the NCAA championships.

In its meet against Cal, Stanford recorded six pool records, including two by junior Michael Bruce in the 100 and
200-meter breaststroke.
In the second event, the 100
breast, junior Michael Bruce fin
ished in 54.70 and stunned the
crowd with another pool record.
Bruce also broke his own 2001
record in the 200 breast, touching
in 1:58.40 for the win.
Sophomore Dan Trupin fin
ished the 200 IM in 1:45.98 to
break a record set in 1989 by Cal's
Ron Karnaugh. Trupin also broke
the same record two weeks ago at
home against Southern California
when he clocked in at 1:45.69.
Stanford completed a 1 -2-3 sweep
in the event, as junior Markus
Rogan and Bruce touched in 1:46.
92 and 1:48.83.
The fifth record on the day set
by the Cardinal fell to senior Dan
Westcott. His time of 1:42.36 in
the 200 back bettered a time set in
1997 by USC's Lenny Krayzel
burg, who later went on to win the
100 and 200-meter backstroke at
the 2000 Olympic games.
Senior Randall Bal also had a
brush with Olympic history this
weekend, as he outtouched Cal's
Anthony Ervin, a 2000 gold
medallist, for the win in the 50
free. Both had sub-20 second per
formances, but Bal's time of 19.75
clinched the win for the Cardinal.
Stanford junior Matt Sorlien
picked up a pair of wins in the 500
and 1,000 free over Cal's Ryan
Lean. Sorlien's time of 4:24.96 in

the 500 was five seconds faster
than Lean's, and his time in the
1,000 put him 11 seconds ahead of
the rest of the competition.
"I thought we were awesome,"
head coach Skip Kenney said.
"We've had a plan all year and we are
exactly where we need to lx\ VVe
seem to be in great position as we
head into the championship season."
Cal only claimed wins in four
events on Saturday, outswim
ming Stanford in the 100 lly, the
100 free and the 400 free relay.
The Golden Bear's top diver, se
nior Nic Bartolotta, also claimed
a win in the 3-meter diving com
petition.
Despite the Cardinal's domi
nance throughout the majority of
the meet, Cal managed to set two
records of its own. Cal freshman
Michael Cavic swam to victory in
the 100 fly in 46.10, bettering the
previous pool record by .5 sec
onds. In addition, Cal's 400 free
relay team of Duje Draganja, Jens
Thiele, Ervin and Cavic proved
that it deserves the No. 1 ranking
in the nation, as it swam a fast
2:54.02 to top Stanford by over
three seconds.
In the diving portion of the
competition, sophomore Adam
Peterson scored 318.225 points
and edged Bartolotta on the 1-
meter springboard for the win. Se
nior Gavin Olmstead placed third
with 293.4 points. Bartolotta
avenged his loss on the 3-meter
however, as he outscored Peterson

If the performance of the No. 1 Cardinal men's
swimming team last Saturday against No. 3 California
is any indication of what is likely to happen in the post
season, the team should be in perfect position to cap
ture the national title at the NCAA Championships
next month. In the process of overpowering its rival
173-112, Stanford (8-0, 4-0 Pacific-10) swam away
with five pool records and a wealth of impressive in

The Cardinal won 11 of the 15 events and estab
lished new pool records at Cal in the 100 and 200
back, the 100 and 200 breast and the 200 individual
medley.
"We are definitely excited about the outcome of
the meet," senior co-captain Dan Westcott said. "It's
always been a fast meet, with both teams competing at
a very high level. Cal took some liberties and the
coaches ran the meet to their liking —they had a
huge crowd and ran the show exactly how they want
ed to. 1 think that as a team, though, we really came in
prepared and stepped up to the challenges they cre
ated."
Junior Peter Marshall opened the meet with a win
and a record in the 100 back, bettering the existing
pool record set in 1995 by Stanford swimmer Brian
Retterer. Marshall's time 0f46.25 seconds was an au
tomatic qualifying time for the NCAA championships.

brush with Olympic history this
weekend, as he outtouched Cal's
Anthony Ervin, a 2000 gold
medallist, for the win in the 50
