# Ego-driven Kobe is no Mike part II
## 
### 
With his 41-point performance in Sun
day's victory over Seattle, Kobe Bryant
tied Michael Jordan for the second most
consecutive games scoring at least 40
points. During his scoring rampage, Bryant has been
putting up monster numbers that defy belief. But
when you look at the ends to which Bryant has gone
to ensure that his streak remains intact, it's not so
much unbelievable as sickening.
I tuned in to the Lakers-Rockets game last week
with about five minutes to play. The Lakers had a
comfortable lead- I then watched as Bryant pro
ceeded to almost single-handedly blow the lead by
forcing up bad shot after bad shot without even the
slightest hint of passing the ball. The Rockets came
back to tie the game and send it into overtime.
Overtime was more of the Kobe show, and double
overtime proved to be no different . In all, I watched

about 15 minutes of the game, and
I can only recall two non-Kobe
shots in that span. Yes, two. In over
a quarter's worth of basketball.
Although his effort in overtime
bailed out his effort in regulation
and proved to be the difference in
the game (that and a ridiculous foul
call on Yao), I'm still hard-pressed
to label his streak anything more

than egotism on ephedrine. I will never be one to
extol the virtues of the evil Lakers, but on a tearri
with good shooters like Robert Horry, Derek Fish
er and Brian Shaw, for Kobe to take every single
shot is absurd.
In the win over Seattle, Kobe got so caught up in
his own greatness that his coach accused him of chas-i
ing the 40 points so badly that he was cutting the
Lakers' chances at the end of the game. And cut the
chances he did, as he had to put up 34 shots from the
field and 16 free throws to get his 40 points, which
makes his outing considerably less impressive. It's
like winning the ring toss at the fair, but spending
$80 to do it-
After the game, he qualified his selfishness by say
ing that the crowd was really into it and the opponents
were trying so hard to stop it that he went away from
the team philosophy to meet the personal challenge.
Not quite an airtight defense of his actions — he's
lucky they won the game. If that had been Mark Mad
sen forcing up 34 shots, I doubt that the public would
have been so forgiving.
Though I despise his selfish attitude in both games,
there is a fundamental difference between the two
that makes me hate the Seattle performance marked
ly more. That reason goes by the name of Shaquille
O'Neal. He was unavailable for the Rockets matchup,
but was back in the lineup against Seattle.
Shaq is made for games against teams like Seattle.
They have absolutely no one who could even fathom
guarding him. If Shaq pulled a Kobe-esque one-on
five shooting rampage against the Sonics, he would
score 75 points. As it was, he scored 27 points and
grabbed 17 boards despite Kobe's best imitations of a
basketball blackhole.
The simple fact of the matter is that Kobe is a
great basketball player, but he's not nearly as great
as he would believe himself to be. While his one-!
man performances may eke out victories here and
there, he is not capable of putting a team on his back
and elevating it to elite status. And though he makes
it seem as if he gladly awaits the opportunity, he
should be happy that he has a 7-foot, 3-inch, 300-
pound force of nature to whom he gets to play sec
ond fiddle, because life as a one-man team isn't as
rewarding as one might think. Just ask Allen
son, Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady (all of
whom I would rate higher than Kobe).
As a side note, I find it insulting to some of the great
team players in this league that Kobe is getting so


Ryan Stewart
much hype about being an MVP
candidate. How could anyone in
good conscience vote for someone
as the most valuable player when

they admittedly almost cost their
team a victory for the sake of mov
ing into second place in some mar
ginal statistical category?
Does Kobe deserve more MVP
consideration that a guy like Dirk
Nowitzki, whose team has the best
record in the NBA? Kobe certainly
is leagues below players like Tim

Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris
Webber, and Jason Kidd. It is a
shame that gaudy numbers and a
me-first attitude are what win
awards, because Ben Wallace
should certainly get a long hard
look at that trophy. And it's too bad
that LA has a few 100 many power
forwards, because I would love the

opportunity to see Madsen try to
put up 34 shots in a game.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and just as he predicted be
fore the season began, the Mavericks
still have the best record in the MBA.

there is a fundamental difference between the two
that makes me hate the Seattle performance marked
ly more. That reason goes by the name of Shaquille
O'Neal. He was unavailable for the Rockets matchup,
but was back in the lineup against Seattle.
Shaq is made for games against teams like Seattle.
They have absolutely no one who could even fathom
guarding him. If Shaq pulled a Kobe-esque one-on
five shooting rampage against the Sonics, he would
score 75 points. As it was, he scored 27 points and
grabbed 17 boards despite Kobe's best imitations of a
basketball blackhole.
The simple fact of the matter is that Kobe is a
great basketball player, but he's not nearly as great
as he would believe himself to be. While his one-!
man performances may eke out victories here and
there, he is not capable of putting a team on his back
and elevating it to elite status. And though he makes
it seem as if he gladly awaits the opportunity, he
should be happy that he has a 7-foot, 3-inch, 300-
pound force of nature to whom he gets to play sec
ond fiddle, because life as a one-man team isn't as
rewarding as one might think. Just ask Allen
son, Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady (all of
whom I would rate higher than Kobe).
As a side note, I find it insulting to some of the great
team players in this league that Kobe is getting so

much hype about being an MVP
candidate. How could anyone in
good conscience vote for someone
as the most valuable player when

they admittedly almost cost their
team a victory for the sake of mov
ing into second place in some mar
ginal statistical category?
Does Kobe deserve more MVP
consideration that a guy like Dirk
Nowitzki, whose team has the best
record in the NBA? Kobe certainly
is leagues below players like Tim

Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris
Webber, and Jason Kidd. It is a
shame that gaudy numbers and a
me-first attitude are what win
awards, because Ben Wallace
should certainly get a long hard
look at that trophy. And it's too bad
that LA has a few 100 many power
forwards, because I would love the

opportunity to see Madsen try to
put up 34 shots in a game.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and just as he predicted be
fore the season began, the Mavericks
still have the best record in the MBA.
