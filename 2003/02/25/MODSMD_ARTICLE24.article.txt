AKRON, Ohio (AP) Leßron
James lifted the framed No. 23 jer
sey high above his head.
No one could question how or
why he got it.
The nation's top player, who
jeopardized his career by accept
ing two gift jerseys, had his high
school jersey retired Monday
night during a postgame cere
mony following Akron St. Vin
cent-St. Mary's 90-43 win over
Firestone.
James didn't play in the hastily
scheduled game. He had to sit out
as part of a two-game suspension
he received for accepting two
"throwback'" sports jerseys for
free from a Cleveland clothing
store last month.
Following the game, James was
given a framed replica of his white
green-and-gold home jersey that
will permanently hang in the
school's gymnasium after his grad
uation in June.
"It's unimaginable,'" James
said. "It's great. It's not just all me,
I feel like my teammates were a
part of that, too. On the other side
of that jersey, it should say team
mates, because they helped me get
to this point.'"
Before receiving the jersey,
James and a crowd of 3,500 at
Akron's Rhodes Arena watched a
video tribute of the 18-year-old
player, whose rise to superstar
dom began a year ago when he ap
peared on the cover of Sports Il
lustrated.
James and his mother, Gloria,
stood arm-in-arm at halfcourt as
the video played overhead.
"The time just flew by," James
said. "Looking up there at my fresh
man year, seeing how little I was."
St. Vincent-St. Mary coach Dru
Joyce II also noted how quickly
James' celebrated career has
passed.
"All eight years Hew by," said
Joyce, who also coached James in

A\U. "It's been great. To see that
little kid grow into what he has be
come, is very special. I'm trying to
savor every moment."
Although his jersey has been re
tired, James isn't done wearing it.
St. Vincent-St. Mary (18-1),
ranked No. 1 by USA Today, will
begin a quest for its third state title
in four years with a first-round
tournament game Friday.
"I'll be ready," James said.
James, who is expected to be
the first overall pick in this year's
NBA draft, fidgeted in his seat
during Monday's first quarter
while his teammates struggled
without him.
But as St. Vincent-St. Mary
began to pull away with a 27-1 run
in the second quarter, James re
laxed enough to check for any text
messages on his pager.
James sat out his school's Feb.
2 game against Canton Mckinley
after the Ohio High School Ath
letic Association stripped him of
his eligibility for accepting the
retro jerseys — valued at $845. A
few days later, a judge reinstated
James but ordered him to sit out a
second game at the school's dis
cretion.
St. Vincent-St. Mary's chose the
regular-season finale Sunday
against Toledo Scott, but it was
canceled because of bad weather.
The Toledo school was unable to
make the trip for Monday's game,
so St. Vincent-St. Mary asked Fire
stone if it would be interested in
playing.
If Firestone hadn't agreed,
James may have had to sit out St.
Vincent-St. Mary's first-round
playoff game Friday against either
Kenmore or Buckeye.
James' case will be heard again
March 5 before Summit County
Court Judge James Williams, who
could overturn the OHSAA's ruling
and give the sch<x)l back the forfeit it
was assessed as part of James' penalty.
