# Poor health care plagues grads

### VINAY JAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford graduate students lack dental
and vision insurance and are failing to get rou
tine checkups, according to a survey conducted
earlier this month by the Graduate Health Task
Force.
Of the 1,1 (>7 students who responded to the
online survey, 78 percent said they were not en
rolled in dental insurance and 17 percent said
they had not had a dental checkup in the past
two years.
Although three-fourths of the respondents
said they wore glasses or contact lenses, only 9
percent said they had vision insurance. Well
over half of the respondents —61 percent —
said they had not had an eye exam within the
past year, while 30 percent said they had not
had one in the past two years.
Respondents cited cost as the main factor
keeping them from purchasing vision or dental
insurance or from enrolling in Cardinal Care,
t he University's health insurance program.
Cardinal Care offers no dental or vision ben
efits.
The survey was intended to gauge student
demand for such benefits, said medical student
Grace Chang, co-chair of the Graduate Student
Council and a member of the task
forte.
Ray Rivera, a member of the
task force and a doctoral candidate
in education, said that two-thirds
of respondents said they would be
willing to pay as much as $50 more
per quarter for dental coverage,
while the same proportion said
they would pay up to $ 15 more for
vision benefits.
The Task Force has been work
ing to expand the scope of Cardinal
Care and to reduce the cost of the
plan for students by securing addi
tional subsidies from the Universi
ty. Currently, Stanford students re
ceiving stipends or fellowships are
eligible for up to a 50 percent sub
sidy toward the cost of Cardinal
Care. But all others — about 30
percent of Stanford graduate stu
dents — must pay the full amount,
minus a token subsidy.
The survey found that even
among respondents who receive
no subsidy, 81 percent favored
adding dental benefits to Cardinal
Care and 56 percent favored
adding both dental and vision ben
efits.
The task force is recommend
ing that the University at the very
least add dental coverage to Cardi
nal Care and increase subsidies to

relieve students of the extra tost.
But lia Friedman, director of
the Vaden Health Center, said
that may not be possible.
"With insurance rates going up
steeply in the Hay Area, it is a
difficult decision to add benefits,"
he said.
Chang, however, said that

University President John Hen
nessy has reluctantly agreed to
examine the task force's propos
al. Chang spoke with Hennessy
on Friday.
"Although he (Hennessy) was
against it in the beginning, after
much discussion, he agreed to look
into the possibility of expanding

the subsidy program and also
adding denial coverage," Chang
said.
Besides recommending the ex
pansion of benefits and subsidies,
the task force urged the University
to do a better job of publicizing the
fact that Cardinal Care covers eye
or hearing exams with a $10 stu
dent co-payment, something
which — according to the
survey — many graduate students
do not know.
The task force points out that
graduate student health insur
ance at Stanford is more expen
sive and less comprehensive than
similar programs at many peer
institutions. This year's Cardinal
Care premium for students not
receiving any stipend or fellow
ship is $1,440 per year. In con
trast, the Caltech program fully
funds health insurance for all of
its graduate students. At DC-
Berkeley, graduate students pay
only $556 a year for personal
medical coverage that includes
dental benefits.
According to Rivera, the task
force has already presented a pre
liminary version of the survey re
sults to Friedman and Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni.
It intends to discuss the findings
with Provost John Etchemendy as
soon as possible.
Rivera added that the task force
plans to eventually publish the full
results of the survey.
