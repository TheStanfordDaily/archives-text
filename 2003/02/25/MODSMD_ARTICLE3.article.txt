### VINAY JAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford graduate students lack dental
and vision insurance and are failing to get rou
tine checkups, according to a survey conducted
earlier this month by the Graduate Health Task
Force.
Of the 1,1 (>7 students who responded to the
online survey, 78 percent said they were not en
rolled in dental insurance and 17 percent said
they had not had a dental checkup in the past
two years.
Although three-fourths of the respondents
said they wore glasses or contact lenses, only 9
percent said they had vision insurance. Well
over half of the respondents —61 percent —
said they had not had an eye exam within the
past year, while 30 percent said they had not
had one in the past two years.
Respondents cited cost as the main factor
keeping them from purchasing vision or dental
insurance or from enrolling in Cardinal Care,
t he University's health insurance program.
Cardinal Care offers no dental or vision ben
efits.
The survey was intended to gauge student
demand for such benefits, said medical student
