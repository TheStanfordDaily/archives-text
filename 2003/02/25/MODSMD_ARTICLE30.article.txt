## 'Mitzvah Day SPARKS VOLUNTEERISM 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dozens of Stanford students,
both Jewish and not, participat
ed in "Mitzvah Day" on Feb. 9.
Due to the success of that en
deavor, the Jewish Leadership
Council has expanded its com
munity service plans.
According to sophomore
Arielle Cahill, an organizer of
the event and head of the coun
cil's social action committee,
Mitzvah means "good deeds" in
Hebrew. She explained how
Mitzvah Day's emphasis on
community service made it rele
vant to the entire Stanford com
munity, even though it was
sponsored jointly by several
Jewish student groups.
"Everyone seemed to really
enjoy it and want to participate
in further events," Cahill said.
"It was a good springboard for
further service events."
She also stressed the signif
icance community service
may have for students of all
backgrounds as a reason for
inviting non-Jewish students
to participate.
"We think it's a really great
thing to get the message out
about how important service is to
Judaism, but also we're keeping
in mind that other groups share
that same sentiment," Cahill
said.
Mitzvah Day kicked off at
noon with a bagel brunch at the
CoHo. While the brunch is a
monthly event sponsored by the
Jewish Leadership Council, it
helped to draw in volunteers and
allowed them to get to know each
other before heading off to work
for Mitzvah Day. About 75 vol
unteers attended the event.
Most of the students at the
brunch headed to Old Union
Courtyard to make peanut but
ter and jelly sandwiches for the
homeless. Many of the partici

pants met at the Haas Center to
take vans to one of their respec
tive volunteering sites.
The sandwich-making was
the largest activity, drawing
about 30 to 50 volunteers,
many of whom were members
of the Stanford women's crew
team. It was organized by
Neged Ra'av, a Jewish commu
nity service group that also co
sponsored the day's activities.
The group, whose name means
"against hunger" in Hebrew,
works on many issues related to
hunger and homelessness.
Another regular volunteering
group that worked with Mitzvah
Day's organizers was the Magic
Oaks program. The volunteers
helped weed around the oak
trees in the Foothills, as the or
ganization has been doing re
cently during its regular Satur
day morning service time.
Some students signed up to
help sort through donations at
the Haven Family House in
Menlo Park, an organization
that provides transitional hous
ing.
The fourth volunteering op
portunity took students to a
nursing center in Palo Alto to
visit elderly residents and make
Valentine's Day cards with
them. Due to its popularity, this
is expected to become a month
ly event.
Since this was the first Mitzvah
day, Cahill was excited about the
turnout, especially among non-
Jewish students.
"We had people fill out eval
uations, and everyone seemed
to really enjoy it and wanted to
participate in further events,"
Cahill said.
So much so that the social ac
tion committee meets tonight to
discuss further service events.
"I think a lot of the people
who came out have new motiva
tion to participate in service ac
tivities," Cahill said.
