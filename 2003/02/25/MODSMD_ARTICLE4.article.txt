# Pres. addresses state of ASSU
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ASSU President Monica Hen
estroza and Graduate Student
Council Chair Grace Chang de
livered a joint State of the Associ
ation address last night, dis
cussing this year's accomplish
ments and plans for the future.
Some of the major issues
Henestroza highlighted were
administrative accountability,
communication with students
about the ASSU's function, aca
demics, the cost of living, com
munity center funding and stu
dent space initiatives.
"The goal is to let everyone
know what the association has
been up to and what the elected
representatives have been doing
this year," Henestroza said.
The State of the Association
address is given every year dur
ing winter quarter.
Traditionally only the ASSU
president gives the address, but
this year Chang talked about
graduate issues, while Hene
stroza spoke about undergradu
ate and general ASSU issues.
Henestroza began by laying
out the structure of the ASSU,
which consists of service projects
(such as the Stanford Concert

Network), the Constitutional
Council (which functions as the
ASSU's judicial branch), the
Graduate Student Council, the
Nominations Commission, Stan
ford Student Enterprises and the
Undergraduate Senate.
Some of the cost of living pro
jects included a bid by SSE to
break the Stanford Bookstore's
monopoly on cap and gown
sales. While the bid failed, the
pressure resulted in lower pric
ing by the Bookstore.
Additionally, dining and laun
dry prices were addressed re
peatedly. The ASSU Nomina
tions Commission created a Din
ing Committee to work on im
proving the pricing and flexibili
ty of student meal plans.
"We have reached a compro
mise within the dining commit
tee to offer a new plan for under
graduates, with 10 meals a
week," said Senator Sarah Schul
man, a sophomore.
Schulman will be presenting
this bill fora new meal plan at
tonight's Senate meeting, as well
as tackling the laundry issue.
Schulman is attempting to
change laundry services, which
are currently outsourced by the
University, to be handled in
house. Under the proposed

plan, students would pay a block
fee for use of University laundry
machines at the beginning of the
quarter. This would then allow fi
nancial aid, for those students
who are eligible, to extend to
laundry as well.
Regarding administrative ac
countability, Henestroza cited in
creased communication with the
Board of Trustees and other
high-level administrators, in
cluding GSC dinners as well as
separate town hall meetings with
University President Hennessy
and Provost Etchemendy. The
town hall meeting with
Etchemendy will be taking place
tomorrow.
Chang addressed major grad
uate student issues, including the
proposed Graduate Community
Center, health care, academics
and housing.
The Graduate Community
Center, designed by members of
the GSC and Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee, is already
included in the General Use Per
mit and the Capital Improve
ment Plan, but the provost is un
certain about its priority relative
to other fundraising efforts.
"We're looking for people who

would help us in this endeavor, be
cause graduate students are under
served in building community — a
lot of them feel isolated," Chang
said.
Health care was another major
concern, as costs for Cardinal Care
rose 50 percent last year. The GSC
is seeking to increase benefits to in
clude dental and vision, as well as
increase subsidies to cover more
graduate students.
In terms of graduate academic
issues, Chang noted attempts to
solve problems in the adviser-stu
dent relationship. Currently there
are few mechanisms for conflict
management, despite the impor
tance of advising.
"[This relationship] is primary
fora graduate student in terms of
his or her career in the future,"
Chang said.
Subcommittees have been
formed to address these issues and
conduct surveys throughout the
campus.
In terms of housing, the GSC
seeks more stability, allowing grad
uate students to automatically
renew housing assignments. Also,
Chang noted attempts to extend
EcoPass, which provides free public
transportation to Stanford employ
ees, graduate and undergraduate
students. Chang noted that this
would ease commuting problems.
Another major improvement
that Henestroza cited concerns the
placement of students on search
committees.

"We now have students includ
ed on search committees for the
new ombudsperson; the director of
multicultural education and associ
ate dean of students; vice provost
and dean of research and graduate
policy," Henestroza said.
Additionally, a Housing Services
and Facilities Advisory Committee
and a Subcommittee for Advising
on the Implementation of a New
Housing Software are in the
process of being created.
Other issues included concerns
over possible community center
budget cuts. Henestroza advised
continuing advocacy for community
centers as well as diversifying
fimdraising efforts to provide more
security.
The Campaign for Student
Space was also a topic, as a letter will
be sent to administrators advocat
ing increased space for the Black
Community Services Center, a new
student union, an interfaith center,
and an expanded LGBT-CRC.
The need fora better student union
was emphasized in particular, as
many other peer institutions — in
cluding Princeton, Columbia, and
Cornell — have recently improved
their student centers.
"There's concern among the
student population that [Tresid
der] Union doesn't quite match
up," Henestroza said. "It's not com
petitive enough, and it doesn't
bring enough community."
Henestroza closed the meeting
by encouraging students to be
more involved in a variety of ways.
"We need strong student
leaders, leaders who will be able
to put in time, leaders who will
be dedicated.''

change laundry services, which
are currently outsourced by the
University, to be handled in
house. Under the proposed

plan, students would pay a block
fee for use of University laundry
machines at the beginning of the
quarter. This would then allow fi
nancial aid, for those students
who are eligible, to extend to
laundry as well.
Regarding administrative ac
countability, Henestroza cited in
creased communication with the
Board of Trustees and other
high-level administrators, in
cluding GSC dinners as well as
separate town hall meetings with
University President Hennessy
and Provost Etchemendy. The
town hall meeting with
Etchemendy will be taking place
tomorrow.
Chang addressed major grad
uate student issues, including the
proposed Graduate Community
Center, health care, academics
and housing.
The Graduate Community
Center, designed by members of
the GSC and Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee, is already
included in the General Use Per
mit and the Capital Improve
ment Plan, but the provost is un
certain about its priority relative
to other fundraising efforts.
"We're looking for people who

would help us in this endeavor, be
cause graduate students are under
served in building community — a
lot of them feel isolated," Chang
said.
Health care was another major
concern, as costs for Cardinal Care
rose 50 percent last year. The GSC
is seeking to increase benefits to in
clude dental and vision, as well as
increase subsidies to cover more
graduate students.
In terms of graduate academic
issues, Chang noted attempts to
solve problems in the adviser-stu
dent relationship. Currently there
are few mechanisms for conflict
management, despite the impor
tance of advising.
"[This relationship] is primary
fora graduate student in terms of
his or her career in the future,"
Chang said.
Subcommittees have been
formed to address these issues and
conduct surveys throughout the
campus.
In terms of housing, the GSC
seeks more stability, allowing grad
uate students to automatically
renew housing assignments. Also,
Chang noted attempts to extend
EcoPass, which provides free public
transportation to Stanford employ
ees, graduate and undergraduate
students. Chang noted that this
would ease commuting problems.
Another major improvement
that Henestroza cited concerns the
placement of students on search
committees.

"We now have students includ
ed on search committees for the
new ombudsperson; the director of
multicultural education and associ
ate dean of students; vice provost
and dean of research and graduate
policy," Henestroza said.
Additionally, a Housing Services
and Facilities Advisory Committee
and a Subcommittee for Advising
on the Implementation of a New
Housing Software are in the
process of being created.
Other issues included concerns
over possible community center
budget cuts. Henestroza advised
continuing advocacy for community
centers as well as diversifying
fimdraising efforts to provide more
security.
The Campaign for Student
Space was also a topic, as a letter will
be sent to administrators advocat
ing increased space for the Black
Community Services Center, a new
student union, an interfaith center,
and an expanded LGBT-CRC.
The need fora better student union
was emphasized in particular, as
many other peer institutions — in
cluding Princeton, Columbia, and
Cornell — have recently improved
their student centers.
"There's concern among the
student population that [Tresid
der] Union doesn't quite match
up," Henestroza said. "It's not com
petitive enough, and it doesn't
bring enough community."
Henestroza closed the meeting
by encouraging students to be
more involved in a variety of ways.
"We need strong student
leaders, leaders who will be able
to put in time, leaders who will
be dedicated.''
ASSU President Monica Hen
estroza and Graduate Student
Council Chair Grace Chang de
livered a joint State of the Associ
ation address last night, dis
cussing this year's accomplish
ments and plans for the future.
Some of the major issues
Henestroza highlighted were
administrative accountability,
communication with students
about the ASSU's function, aca
demics, the cost of living, com
munity center funding and stu
dent space initiatives.
"The goal is to let everyone
know what the association has
been up to and what the elected
representatives have been doing
this year," Henestroza said.
The State of the Association
address is given every year dur
ing winter quarter.
Traditionally only the ASSU
president gives the address, but
this year Chang talked about
graduate issues, while Hene
stroza spoke about undergradu
ate and general ASSU issues.
Henestroza began by laying
out the structure of the ASSU,
which consists of service projects
(such as the Stanford Concert

Network), the Constitutional
Council (which functions as the
ASSU's judicial branch), the
Graduate Student Council, the
Nominations Commission, Stan
ford Student Enterprises and the
Undergraduate Senate.
Some of the cost of living pro
jects included a bid by SSE to
break the Stanford Bookstore's
monopoly on cap and gown
sales. While the bid failed, the
pressure resulted in lower pric
ing by the Bookstore.
Additionally, dining and laun
dry prices were addressed re
peatedly. The ASSU Nomina
tions Commission created a Din
ing Committee to work on im
proving the pricing and flexibili
ty of student meal plans.
"We have reached a compro
mise within the dining commit
tee to offer a new plan for under
graduates, with 10 meals a
week," said Senator Sarah Schul
man, a sophomore.
Schulman will be presenting
this bill fora new meal plan at
tonight's Senate meeting, as well
as tackling the laundry issue.
Schulman is attempting to
change laundry services, which
are currently outsourced by the
University, to be handled in
house. Under the proposed
