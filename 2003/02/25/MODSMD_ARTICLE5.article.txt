# Time concerns and eating disorders lead to
## NUTRITION NIGHTMARES 
### FRANCINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With precious little time or money, Stan
ford students increasingly rely on fast food
and microwaves to satiate their hunger â€”
forgetting nutrition, health and low fat con
tent, and saying hello to popcorn, chips and
candy bars galore.
"Nutrition should be a top priority for
every student," said Vivian Crisman, a nu
tritionist at the Vaden Health Center.
"Without a well-balanced diet, students
have no stamina and their concentration
levels drop."
According to recent statistics, 40 percent
of the students seen by Crisman are "disor
dered eaters." Often these students eat too
little and infrequently, or they overeat in
order to compensate for meals they may have
skipped earlier in the day.
"It's really all about making time for eating
and learning to eat well on the run," Crisman
said.
According to Crisman, college students
tend to consume foods that are too high in
fat, salt and calories and low in fiber. A
healthy diet integrates the major food groups
in the right amounts.

New nutritional guidelines established by
the Food and Drug Administration recom
mend a dietary intake according to the "food
pyramid." At the base are carbohydrates,
such as potatoes, whole wheat bread and
Hour, which should be eaten six to 11 times a
day.
1 he pyramid also suggests vegetables (3 to
5 servings), fruit (2 to 4 servings), dairy (2 to
3 servings) and protein (2 to 3 servings). The
protein group includes meat, poultry, fish,
dry beans, eggs and nuts. Pats should be
eaten in trace amounts.
Alcohol, cigarettes, coffee and birth con
trol pills can all deplete the body of essential
vitamins and minerals, so supplements are
also advisable, Crisman said.
Snacking, often seen by many students as
a poor alternative to the "square-meal" is also
advocated by Crisman as beneficial to health.
"Active snacking every three hours speeds
up the metabolism, which is better for the
body," she said. "It is really not healthy to ig
nore hunger. Everyone should listen to their
body's cues."
Although most students at Stanford prefer
healthy eating, many feel that there is little
