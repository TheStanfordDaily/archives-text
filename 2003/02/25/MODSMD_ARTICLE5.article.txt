# Time concerns and eating disorders lead to
## NUTRITION NIGHTMARES 
### FRANCINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With precious little time or money, Stan
ford students increasingly rely on fast food
and microwaves to satiate their hunger â€”
forgetting nutrition, health and low fat con
tent, and saying hello to popcorn, chips and
candy bars galore.
"Nutrition should be a top priority for
every student," said Vivian Crisman, a nu
tritionist at the Vaden Health Center.
"Without a well-balanced diet, students
have no stamina and their concentration
levels drop."
According to recent statistics, 40 percent
of the students seen by Crisman are "disor
dered eaters." Often these students eat too
little and infrequently, or they overeat in
order to compensate for meals they may have
skipped earlier in the day.
"It's really all about making time for eating
and learning to eat well on the run," Crisman
said.
According to Crisman, college students
tend to consume foods that are too high in
fat, salt and calories and low in fiber. A
healthy diet integrates the major food groups
in the right amounts.

New nutritional guidelines established by
the Food and Drug Administration recom
mend a dietary intake according to the "food
pyramid." At the base are carbohydrates,
such as potatoes, whole wheat bread and
Hour, which should be eaten six to 11 times a
day.
1 he pyramid also suggests vegetables (3 to
5 servings), fruit (2 to 4 servings), dairy (2 to
3 servings) and protein (2 to 3 servings). The
protein group includes meat, poultry, fish,
dry beans, eggs and nuts. Pats should be
eaten in trace amounts.
Alcohol, cigarettes, coffee and birth con
trol pills can all deplete the body of essential
vitamins and minerals, so supplements are
also advisable, Crisman said.
Snacking, often seen by many students as
a poor alternative to the "square-meal" is also
advocated by Crisman as beneficial to health.
"Active snacking every three hours speeds
up the metabolism, which is better for the
body," she said. "It is really not healthy to ig
nore hunger. Everyone should listen to their
body's cues."
Although most students at Stanford prefer
healthy eating, many feel that there is little
time to either prepare meals or
eat regularly.
"I'm eating well, but usually
only twice a clay," said freshman
Mark. Thompson.
Physical fitness is also hard to
fit into a hectic regime.
"1 have little time to exercise,
but that's a product of the Stan
ford lifestyle," said senior
Michael Woods.
Irregular eating patterns and
fast-paced schedules may also
lead to more extreme eating dis
orders like anorexia, binge eating
and bulimia.
According to Naomi Brown,
a counselor at Vaden, between
10 and 20 percent of all stu
dents across campuses nation
wide have an eating disorder.

Brown believes this figure may
in fact be higher, due to the
large number of cases that go
unreported.
Statistics show that more
women than men have eating dis
orders, though this figure may be
distorted.
"Over the years, eating disor
ders have become such a femi
nized illness that men simply
don't come forward," Brown
explained.
Counseling and Psychological
Services has seen an increasing
number of males seeking coun
seling for eating disorders, ac
cording to recent figures.
There are also greater reported
incidences of eating disorders
among Stanford athletes, Brown
said. Gymnasts, runners, body
builders, rowers, wrestlers and
swimmers are all required to
maintain a specific body-mass to
fat ratio.

"Sometimes when athletes
need to meet the criteria, they be
come overly obsessive with calo
rie-counting and fat content,"
Brown stated.
In many cases of eating disor
ders, there is no one particular
factor that has caused the condi
tion. Those who are perfection
ists by nature, or an overempha
sis on weight and appearance,
are among those at greatest risk.
Brown said.
Junior Rebby Allen, director
of the Wellness and Depression
Group at The Bridge, agreed
that eating disorders are often
extremely complex.
"Each case is very individual
ized," Allen said. "Some like to at
tract more attention to themselves
by becoming smaller and more
vulnerable. Others like to take
control in their lives, by denying
themselves food. Others have
weight issues, but all involve a very

extreme psychological situation."
Recent figures from The
Bridge show that approximately
5 percent of calls received are
from those suffering an eating
disorder, "though this is by no
means representative of the real
picture," Allen stated.
One of the largest concerns is
that, after freshman year, there
are relatively few ways to check if
someone living off campus has an
eating disorder.
Another concern is the on
campus availability of laxatives,
used frequently by bulimics to
expel food from their bodies.
Allen said she knew of someone
who would consume an entire
box of laxatives each day.
"Having a severe eating disor
der can cause problems that will
last the rest of your life," Allen
said. "It's important that we all
learn how to take care of ourselves
and to eat properly."
