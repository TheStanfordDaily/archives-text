# Alumni flock to Peace Corps

Peace Corps Director Gaddi Vasquez
recently recognized Stanford University as
one of the nation's highest producers of
Peace Corps volunteers. The University
ranks 10th, with a total of 32 graduates
currently serving in 24 different countries
around the world.
Vasquez applauded Stanford's contri
bution to her organization's coterie of
"grassroots ambassadc >rs."
"For most people in the world, the first
American they ever meet will be a Peace
Corps volunteer," Vasquez said. "So it is
particularly important for us to recognize
those institutions that foster ideals of ser
vice and cultural understanding and en
courage graduates to serve the cause of
world peace."
Since the program's founding in 1961,
more than 1,280 Stanford graduates have
volunteered in I0. r > different countries
around the world.

Candice Tong, who graduated from
Stanford in 1998 and is currently working
as a research associate at UC-San Francis
co, spent two years teaching science, math
and English to secondary school students
in the rural Omusati region of northern
Namibia.
"During those two years in Namibia, I
learned so much," she said. "I learned new
languages and cultures. I learned about
finding a sense of home anywhere iti the
world. I only wish that I was able to help
my community and teach [them] as much
as they taught me."
Tong lived with a host family consisting
of the principal of the school, her husband
and their nine children on a rural farm
stead with no electricity, running water or
telephone access.
"They quickly adopted me as a daugh
ter and a sister," she said. "Living with my
host family for two years was a highlight of
my Peace Corps serv ice."
Rosie Garza, a Peace Corps volunteer
who is currently in the masters program in

international policy studies at Stanford,
said that the Peace Corps has three objec
tives in sending Americans abroad: to give
people abroad a better sense of what
Americans are like, to give Americans a feel
for different cultures and peoples and to
provide third world countries with the
technical assistance necessary for their de
velopment.

Garza spent two years teaching
chemistry at an all-girls government
boarding school in rural Tanzania.
She, like Tong, lacked all the mod
ern features of U.S. society such as
running water, electricity and other
conveniences.
Her motives for joining the
Peace Corps were a mix of enthusi
asm and desire for personal growth.
"In college I was very idealistic —
a kind of'save the world' type," she
said. "I went in with the mentality
that 1 really wanted to help people
and do something for the world.

"What I realized, after two and
a half years in Tanzania, is that by
joining the Peace Corps, you re
ceive so much more personally
than what you contribute to your
community. It's more about inter
acting with people of other cul
tures and having them get to know
an American personally — giving
them a different perspective from
what they see on CNN or what
they read about in the paper."
Garza's adventures in western
Africa read like a prototypical
Hollywood screenplay about a
traveler in foreign lands. Her trek
from the city to her village in
volved a five-hour bus ride over
jarring dirt roads while goats
stared placidly from the bus aisle

and random babies situated them
selves on her lap.
Daily life in the village was just as
interesting. Garza woke up to the
crow of a rooster each morning and
went for an early run with a group
of schoolgirls singing patriotic songs
in Swahili.
"It's what you see on the Discov
ery Channel — the wide open
plains, the acacia trees, the giraffes
in the background," she said.
While volunteers generally enjoy
their experience, they are certainly
not immune to the dangers of rural
life.
Tong, for instance, experienced
moments of helplessness when a
civil war in Angola began spilling
across the Namibian border. Due to

poor communications, she was left
uninformed and unable to reach
the administrative staff.
"There were moments like those
when I felt the lack of communica
tion interfering with my safety," she
said.
Tragedy hit very close to home
for Garza when a friend from her
training was trampled to death by
an elephant. Another friend from
her training group died of asphyxi
ation while sleeping.
"Obviously, the risks are big —
the medical risks, the safety risks,"
she said. "But Peace Corps does
everything in their power to miti
gate those risks. Peace Corps takes
really, really good care of their vol
unteers."
