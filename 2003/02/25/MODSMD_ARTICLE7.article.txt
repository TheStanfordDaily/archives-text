Peace Corps Director Gaddi Vasquez
recently recognized Stanford University as
one of the nation's highest producers of
Peace Corps volunteers. The University
ranks 10th, with a total of 32 graduates
currently serving in 24 different countries
around the world.
Vasquez applauded Stanford's contri
bution to her organization's coterie of
"grassroots ambassadc >rs."
"For most people in the world, the first
American they ever meet will be a Peace
Corps volunteer," Vasquez said. "So it is
particularly important for us to recognize
those institutions that foster ideals of ser
vice and cultural understanding and en
courage graduates to serve the cause of
world peace."
Since the program's founding in 1961,
more than 1,280 Stanford graduates have
volunteered in I0. r > different countries
around the world.

Candice Tong, who graduated from
Stanford in 1998 and is currently working
as a research associate at UC-San Francis
co, spent two years teaching science, math
and English to secondary school students
in the rural Omusati region of northern
Namibia.
"During those two years in Namibia, I
learned so much," she said. "I learned new
languages and cultures. I learned about
finding a sense of home anywhere iti the
world. I only wish that I was able to help
my community and teach [them] as much
as they taught me."
Tong lived with a host family consisting
of the principal of the school, her husband
and their nine children on a rural farm
stead with no electricity, running water or
telephone access.
"They quickly adopted me as a daugh
ter and a sister," she said. "Living with my
host family for two years was a highlight of
my Peace Corps serv ice."
Rosie Garza, a Peace Corps volunteer
who is currently in the masters program in

international policy studies at Stanford,
said that the Peace Corps has three objec
tives in sending Americans abroad: to give
people abroad a better sense of what
Americans are like, to give Americans a feel
for different cultures and peoples and to
provide third world countries with the
technical assistance necessary for their de
velopment.
