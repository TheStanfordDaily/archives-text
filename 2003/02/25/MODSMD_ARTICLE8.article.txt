# SOCC to rally in Washington
## Students of Color Coalition plans to raise money for D.C. rally in support of affirmative action 
### VAUHINI VARA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Students of ('.olor Coalition
will travel to an April 1 rally in Washington,
DC. to show that students of all ethnic
groups care about affirmative action policy.
The group plans to raise $5,550 to send
11 students — including 16 black students,
12 Chicano / Latino students, eight Asians,
three Native Americans and two white stu
dents— to the rally, where they will join
thousands of high school and college stu
dents from around the country.
Sophomore Khalilah Karim, who repre
sents the Black Student Union in the coali
tion, pointed out that affirmative action ben
efits more than just a few minority groups.
All women benefit from affirmative action,

she said, as well as some Asian minority
groups. For example, Stanford is one of
many universities that consider Filipinos an
underrepresented minority.
Sophomore Eric Shih, co-chair of the
Stanford Asian American Activism Coalition,
stressed the need for Asian students to ex
press support of affirmative action. Shih said
it frustrates him when affirmative action op
ponents claim that Asians agree with them.
"It places us unwillingly against other
communities of color and masks our equal
dedication to overturning the dominant sys
tem and history of advantage," he said. "The
supposed progress of Asian-Pacific Ameri
cans has been made at the expense of other
groups, ultimately as a strategy for the con
tinued oppression of all people of color."
Similar local rallies will take place on the
same day, but the trip's organizers feel that it
is important to travel to Washington to ex
press solidarity with activists around the
country and support Stanford's commit-
merit to diversity, as expressed by
President Hennessy in a statement
defending affirmative action.
"This in no way diminishes the
significance of local grassroots ef
forts," Shih said.
The group's efforts extend be
yond the rally itself. While they are
in Washington, the Stanford stu
dents also plan to speak with stu
dents at local high schools that
Stanford recruiters do not typically
visit, Karim said. They will also
meet with students from George
town, Howard and George Wash
ington universities to discuss the
climate on their campuses regard

I his is not the first time that
Stanford students have traveled to

Washington to rally in support of a
cause. Junior lan Slattery, a mem
ber of the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, traveled to
Washington last year fora three
day event organized as the
"Colombia Mobilization."
Slattery said he found it impor
tant to protest at the national event
"to help build growing discontent"
on a large-scale level.
"I saw the building of bridges
between different social justice
movements to be extremely impor
tant in order to promote the over
all efficacy of such movement s," he
said.
Slattery supported the coali
tion's decision to travel to Wash
ington.
"I believe a huge turnout in
I). C.in support of affirmative ac
tion, coupled with effective en
gagement witli the main criticisms
of the policy, can be extremely ben
eficial," he said.
