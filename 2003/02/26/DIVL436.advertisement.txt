All Else Equal:
Are Public and Private Schools Different?

Is there really a discernable difference
between the education provided by
public and private schools? Is it true, as
advocates of voucher plans assert, that
market-driven education results in
improved educational practices, greater
parental involvement, and heightened
student achievement? Not necessarily.
Though advocates of school
privatization have, in the past, produced
compelling evidence to support their
claims of private school superiority and
campaigns for state voucher programs,
other, equally compelling, studies have
repeatedly shown that socio-economics
plays the defining role in determining
student achievement regardless of the
type of school. Having parsed the many
studies on voucher plans, Rothstein,
Carnoy, and Beneviste have concluded
that, within similar socio-economic
environments, there s very little
difference between the public school
system and its private counterpart.
Inner-city private schools, most of which
are Catholic, suffer from the same
problems neighboring public schools
have including large class sizes,
unqualified teachers, outdated curricula,
lack of parental involvement, and
stressful family and community
circumstances. Straightforward and
authoritative, ALL ELSE EQUAL
challenges us to reconsider vital policy
decisions and rethink the issues facing
our current educational system.
