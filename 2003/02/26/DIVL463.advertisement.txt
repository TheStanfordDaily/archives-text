How to protect yourself
• Be cautious when accepting drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)
from strangers. If you accept a drink, make sure it is from an
unopened container and that you open it yourself.
• Do not drink from open beverage sources like punch bowls or
pitchers.
• Do not put your drink down and leave it unattended.
• Be aware of your surroundings. If you see a friend who is "too
intoxicated" for what they have taken, leave immediately.
• Always go out with a group of friends and watch out for each
other.
• Trust your instincts. If you feel ill or think something is wrong, get
help immediately.
