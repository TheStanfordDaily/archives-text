## War will strain troop resources 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army's top gen
eral said yesterday a military occupying force fora
postwar Iraq could total several hundred thou
sand soldiers.
Iraq is "a piece of geography that's fairly signifi
cant," Gen. Eric K. Shinseki said at a hearing of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. And he said any
postwar occupying force would have to be big enough
to maintain safety in a country with "ethnic tensions
that could lead to other problems."
In response to questioning by Sen. Carl Levin of
Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee,
Shinseki said he couldn't give specific numbers of the
size of an occupation force but would rely on the rec
ommendations of commanders in the region.
At the White House, meanwhile, President Bush
kept up pressure on Saddam Hussein and the United
Nations.
He predicted that Saddam would try to "fool the
world one more time," by revealing the existence of
weapons that he has previously denied having. But
the president insisted the only way the Iraqi leader
could avoid war was "full disarmament. The man has
been told to disarm. For the sake of peace, he must
completely disarm."
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he be
lieves Iraq has chemical and biological weapons
that are "more lethal and dangerous today than
they would have been in '91, but I don't know that
for sure."
Addressing the conservative Hoover Institute,
Rumsfeld noted that Iraq sent some of its warplanes
out of the country during the 1991 Gulf War, and he
suggested Saddam might do the same with weapons
in the current situation.

Pentagon officials have said that U.S. forces massed
in the region number about 200,000, about half of
them Army.
Responding to concerns raised by the committee
chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., Shinseki and
Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air Force chief of staff, said
some of their forces, particularly special operations
troops, were being stretched thin by the demands
made on them. In addition to the buildup in Iraq,
special forces have been deployed in the Afghanistan
region, the Philippines and Colombia.

U.S. military officials said American warplanes
bombed surface-to-surface missile systems in north
ern and southern Iraq on yesterday and also attacked
surface-to-air missiles in southern Iraq.
The U.S. planes struck the missile systems because
they threatened coalition forces that are enforcing no
lly zones and assembling in Kuwait fora possible war
with Iraq, military statements said. The strikes were
the most extensive on a single day since the U.N. Se
curity Council in November passed its latest resolu
tion demanding that Iraq disarm.
