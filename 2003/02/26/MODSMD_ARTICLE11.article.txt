# Global warming plan under fire

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Scientists advising the
White House on President Bush's plan for 10 more
years of research into global warming criticized the
idea yesterday as too unfocused to deal adequately
with the potential threats.
"They didn't set the hard priorities," said Michael
Prather, a climate expert at the University of Califor
nia, Irvine. "We've had a decade of global climate
change research. From the scientists' point of view, we
have a pretty good idea of what is happening."
Prather, part of a panel convened by the National
Academy of Sciences, said the scientists' biggest worry
is that the White House goal of reducing uncertainty,
while admirable, will take too long.
In a report issued yesterday, the academy panel
noted that Earth's surface warmed by about 1.1 de
grees Fahrenheit over the 20th century, which caused
"melting glaciers and ice caps, sea-level rise, extended
growing seasons and changes in the geographical dis
tributions of plant and animal species."
Because Earth responds so slowly to changes in the
levels of warming gases, the report said, environmen
tal impacts from global warming will continue during
the 21st century and beyond.
The White House's research approach "lacks most
elements of a strategic plan" because it has no clear
guiding vision or specific timetable for what should be
accomplished, the report said.
"Future science must also focus on more applied
research that can directly support decision-making,"
wrote Thomas Graedel, a Yale University professor.
When Congress created the U.S. Global Change
Research Program in 1990, it said the government
must create a 10-year research plan and update it
every three years. That has not been done until now.
