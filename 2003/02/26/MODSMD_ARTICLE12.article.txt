## The 						Stanford Daily Campus deserves care 
### 
Editorial

Over the weekend, nearly 3,000
Stanford parents, siblings and rela
tives had ample opportunity to
enjoy one of the most architectural
ly diverse campuses in the country. Indeed,
Stanford's architectural history is a tale of nu
merous reinventions of a master plan, aimed at
expressing a new identity of a university
emerging into a renowned institution. On
nearly every campus tour, someone perceives
the spirit of this history, asking the student
guide articulately about a building's architect
or construction.
However, throughout many portions of the
tour, an astute observer cannot help but notice
a few areas of neglect. As the tour group mean
ders towards the center of campus, near the foot
of the Main Quad steps, one stands on a mag
nificent plane, with an eastward view of Palm
Drive. Flanking the steps to the Main Quad and
extending in orthogonal directions is an im
pressive balustrade, upon which once-beautiful
ornamental urns stand. Sadly, some of these
urns are missing their handles or leaning at
some grimly acute angle while seemingly bal
anced upon a cracked base.
Any good campus tour ends, of course, at
the Bookstore with plenty an opportunity to
pick up some Stanford regalia. Before enter
ing the Bookstore, however, one might re
fresh oneself, and pick up some atmosphere,
by sitting on any one of the curvilinear con-

Crete benches surrounding the Claw. Now,
there are two things one could notice about
the benches: They form a lovely quatrefoil
around the sunken court containing the Claw,
and their entire surfaces, whether disfigured,
pitted, or simply chipped, are coated in a pati
na of foul-looking grime and are most unwel
come for any sitting.
Among other restorations, the University
ought to repair the ornamental urns on the
balustrade facing Serra Mall and the concrete
benches along the perimeter of the Claw.
These two areas of campus require immediate
attention. When buildings seem to be need
lessly painted every year, it is not unreason
able to ask that some of it be used fora reno
vation.
The University ought to present its best
face to visitors. While some might notice prop
erly maintained balustrades or benches, near
ly everyone will notice the flaws or signs of ne
glect. Failure to care for such architectural de
tails gives these areas a shabby, debasing ap
pearance, one which doubtless impresses visi
tors unfavorably and fails to represent the true
beauty of the campus.
Properly caring for these and other archi
tectural features around the campus not only
reinforces in the minds of visitors the excel
lence they expect of Stanford, but also pre
serves both the history of the University and
the tales that are encoded in these features.
