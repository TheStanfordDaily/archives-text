Imagine walking into your
earth systems class and find
ing all the desks in the room
emblazoned with the Arco
company logo, or watching a slide
show in psychology where drug
companies advertise on every
fourth slide. It may seem ludicrous
to us, but to students in cash
strapped school districts, this type
of crass commercialism may soon
be coming to classrooms every
where.
Thanks to the California bud
get crisis, many schools are losing
large portions of their operating
budgets. In addition to the enact
ed and proposed cuts that school
districts are facing, Gov. Gray
Davis has proposed a plan to take
roughly 75 percent of all money
generated from property taxes
from "basic aid" school districts —
districts which already receive a
much smaller amount of the edu
cation budget than others due to
their location in affluent areas.
Many of these districts depend on
property taxes for operating
funds. The Palo Alto Unified
School District alone is facing a 25
percent reduction of its entire
budget.
This is where the advertising
comes in.
Basic aid districts are currently
seeking to make up for the losses
by turning to companies — as a re
sult of the sponsorship, companies
will generously pump cash back
into the schools — at a price.
Many school districts already
have sponsors. Ever wondered
why you couldn't find a Coca-Cola
drink in high school? Your school
was probably in a contract with
Pepsi, much like mine was. Our
dance team once performed to
Britney Spears' "Joy of Pepsi" song
during a pep rally. They even
brandished Pepsi cans at one point

in the routine.
Some schools are considering
selling their name rights. Our
younger siblings might one day be
going to Kinko's Kennedy Ele
mentary School, or Starbucks Roo
sevelt junior High.
Today, we live in a society that is
inundated in advertisements. We

can't turn around
without seeing an
advertisement for
Old Navy or Mc-
Donald's or Nike
somewhere. As
adults we are
used to this, and
we at least have
the ability to
choose services or

products based not solely on ad
vertisements, but on experience as
well.
Still, our familiarity with brand
names and jingles speaks much
about how advertisements have
been ingrained in our daily lives.
Who doesn't know the words to
the Mentos song, or how many
licks it takes to get to the center of
a Tootsie Pop?
For the generation coming up,
the fusion of education and com
mercialism can have some drastic
effects that our society might not
be completely aware of.
By targeting the young and im
pressionable (not to mention the
older and impressionable), com
panies have a foot in the classroom
door and can begin developing
brand awareness and brand loyal
ty with the grade school set. This
has been shown to discourage ex
perimentation with other prod
ucts and plant the seeds fora con
sumption-based society, which
may lead to addiction and health
problems, among other things.
In a time when they are still
constructing perceptions about

the world, young people will be
bamboozled into believing the
false images that advertisements
propagate: Only cool, hip second
graders shop at Gap Kids; you're
no one unless you drink Kool-Aid.
Oh, yeah!
A culture of materialism will
spring up among this age group,
which in turn opens the door for
feelings of inadequacy based on
what the media tells them they
must have in order to be "cool."
For kids that don't ascribe to
what is "cool" or whose parents
would rather not purchase the
products, self-esteem issues as
sociated with inadequacy can de
velop, leading to a host of other
problems.
And all of this will be happen
ing at a younger age than ever
before.
Even worse, just how adver
tisers can influence the content
of programs they sponsor, so
could they influence school cur
riculum.
Imagine if Exxon was a school
sponsor? We could just "gloss"
over the whole Exxon Valdez oil
spill thing in history class.
This example may seem pre
posterous, but it's not far from
what happens in the television in
dustry. Before we know it, fourth
graders everywhere will know the
atomic weight of bolognium.
While I think it is important for
school districts to raise funds dur
ing the financial crisis, there must
be alternatives to youth-targeted
advertising in the classroom. We
can't compromise our education
fora quick buck.
