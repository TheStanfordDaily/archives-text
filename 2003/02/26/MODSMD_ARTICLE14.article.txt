University has acted
inconsistently regarding recent crimes
I have two concerns regarding the Feb.
24 article in The Daily "DUI crash triggers
pre-dawn alarms." The first is regarding
Resident Dean Anne Dowd's assertion in
the article that Stanford does not usually
take action against students arrested for
DUI. I certainly do not want the student to
have to go through anything more than he
already will in the legal system, but given
the University's actions in another crimi
nal incident earlier this year, I am con
fused as to the administration's policies on
taking additional actions against students
charged with crimes.
The University fired several staff mem
bers from Columbae last quarter and re
moved them from University housing
after they were caught stealing books from
the Stanford Bookstore. That harmless
crime involved a negligible amount of
stolen goods. In this weekend's case, a stu
dent caused significant amounts of dam
age and inconvenienced many around
campus and quite easily could have killed
people. Yet Dowd's comments made it
sound like the University plans to do noth

ing. The recklessness of drunk driving —
especially when the level of intoxication
was such that damage on and off campus
(The Daily failed to report that the driver
took out a picket fence near the site of the
party before making it to campus) result
ed, with many dire consequences thank
fully avoided — should elicit at least as
much of the University's response as the
stealing of a few textbooks. Either that, or
the University should admit there was an
overreaction in the Columbae case.
I also hope this incident wakes the Uni
versity up to some of the repercussions of
tightening its alcohol policy on campus,
which raises the risk of more incidents like
this one — with potentially worse out
comes. Increasing restrictions on alcohol
on campus will likely force more students
to go off campus to drink, both locally and
well away from Stanford.
I certainly do not condone drinking
and driving as a reasonable option for stu
dents who do such. But it would be naive
for the University to ignore that 18-to-22-
year-olds can be remarkably stupid and
that I)UI incidents, both those that get
caught and those that don't, will signifi
cantly increase if the alcohol policy on
campus gets more strict.
Shuttles to San Francisco and even Palo
Alto might help, but unless those shuttles

run all night and cover a broad area, they
will be of only limited use in preventing
students from driving while intoxicated.
Saturday's incident occurred in resi
dential Palo Alto away from any current
Stanford shuttle routes and well after any
shuttles would be running anyway. And
increased educational events about drunk
driving would seem to be of little good —
it's not like Stanford students aren't al
ready well aware of the risks involved, as
reaction to this weekend's incident among
my friends and others around campus has
shown.
If the thinking behind tightening the
alcohol rules on campus is that it will in
crease student safety, then perhaps some
more assessments about the dangers of in
creased student drinking off campus need
to be made.

Residential Education responds to
concerns about disciplinary consequences
Ezra Callahan sent me his letter to The
Daily prior to publication, and 1 would like
to respond concerning some of the facts in
the article and in the letter .The information
in the article was somewhat misleading in

only stating what might take place as it re
lates to a violation of the residence agree
ment (the document that the residence
deans enforce) and other University disci
plinary actions that might result from a
DUI incident. Let me share with you some
of those details.
First, the University takes incidents that
endanger students very seriously and, as
Callahan indicated from his own observa
tions in this incident, driving under the in
fluence of alcohol may have tragic conse
quences. The student involved was ex
tremely fortunate that tragedy did not result
from irresponsible decisions and behavior.
Recalling a precedent-setting case of 1985
involving drunk driving by a student, then
Stanford President Donald Kennedy stated
that "the charge against [the student who
was the subject of the Fundamental Stan
dard complaint] is that he drove a car in the
condition and in a manner inconsistent with
the rights and welfare of others on this cam
pus in violation of the University 'law' — the
Fundamental Standard; that his conduct
also constituted a citable offense according
to the California penal code is coincidental;
it does not immunize a student from institu
tional accountability."
As it relates to disciplinary consequences,
driving under the influence of alcohol on
campus may result in a formal complaint

being filed with the Office of Judicial Affairs
under the Fundamental Standard. Such a
complaint will trigger an automatic investi
gation by the Office of Judicial Affairs. I am
not at liberty to speak about any specific stu
dent case, however, each case is evaluated
individually and it is not uncommon fora
residence dean to file a complaint to Judi
cial Affairs for its review.
While residence deans would not be
acting on a violation of the residence
agreement as it relates to driving under
the influence, a dean may act on a report
of a violation of the alcohol policy (under
the legal drinking age) in a case of DUI.
The sanctions in these cases could be as se
vere as loss of housing depending on the
circumstances of the case and any other
history of similar misconduct.
Lastly, students arrested for DUI
will have their case adjudicated
through the criminal justice system. A
case of DUI generally results in a min
imum of probation and alcohol educa
tion.
Please rest assured that the Univer
sity does takes what it believes to be ap
propriate action based on individual
circumstances.

First, the University takes incidents that
endanger students very seriously and, as
Callahan indicated from his own observa
tions in this incident, driving under the in
fluence of alcohol may have tragic conse
quences. The student involved was ex
tremely fortunate that tragedy did not result
from irresponsible decisions and behavior.
Recalling a precedent-setting case of 1985
involving drunk driving by a student, then
Stanford President Donald Kennedy stated
that "the charge against [the student who
was the subject of the Fundamental Stan
dard complaint] is that he drove a car in the
condition and in a manner inconsistent with
the rights and welfare of others on this cam
pus in violation of the University 'law' — the
Fundamental Standard; that his conduct
also constituted a citable offense according
to the California penal code is coincidental;
it does not immunize a student from institu
tional accountability."
As it relates to disciplinary consequences,
driving under the influence of alcohol on
campus may result in a formal complaint

being filed with the Office of Judicial Affairs
under the Fundamental Standard. Such a
complaint will trigger an automatic investi
gation by the Office of Judicial Affairs. I am
not at liberty to speak about any specific stu
dent case, however, each case is evaluated
individually and it is not uncommon fora
residence dean to file a complaint to Judi
cial Affairs for its review.
While residence deans would not be
acting on a violation of the residence
agreement as it relates to driving under
the influence, a dean may act on a report
of a violation of the alcohol policy (under
the legal drinking age) in a case of DUI.
The sanctions in these cases could be as se
vere as loss of housing depending on the
circumstances of the case and any other
history of similar misconduct.
Lastly, students arrested for DUI
will have their case adjudicated
through the criminal justice system. A
case of DUI generally results in a min
imum of probation and alcohol educa
tion.
Please rest assured that the Univer
sity does takes what it believes to be ap
propriate action based on individual
circumstances.

University has acted
inconsistently regarding recent crimes
I have two concerns regarding the Feb.
24 article in The Daily "DUI crash triggers
pre-dawn alarms." The first is regarding
Resident Dean Anne Dowd's assertion in
the article that Stanford does not usually
take action against students arrested for
DUI. I certainly do not want the student to
have to go through anything more than he
already will in the legal system, but given
the University's actions in another crimi
nal incident earlier this year, I am con
fused as to the administration's policies on
taking additional actions against students
charged with crimes.
The University fired several staff mem
bers from Columbae last quarter and re
moved them from University housing
after they were caught stealing books from
the Stanford Bookstore. That harmless
crime involved a negligible amount of
stolen goods. In this weekend's case, a stu
dent caused significant amounts of dam
age and inconvenienced many around
campus and quite easily could have killed
people. Yet Dowd's comments made it
sound like the University plans to do noth

ing. The recklessness of drunk driving —
especially when the level of intoxication
was such that damage on and off campus
(The Daily failed to report that the driver
took out a picket fence near the site of the
party before making it to campus) result
ed, with many dire consequences thank
fully avoided — should elicit at least as
much of the University's response as the
stealing of a few textbooks. Either that, or
the University should admit there was an
overreaction in the Columbae case.
I also hope this incident wakes the Uni
versity up to some of the repercussions of
tightening its alcohol policy on campus,
which raises the risk of more incidents like
this one — with potentially worse out
comes. Increasing restrictions on alcohol
on campus will likely force more students
to go off campus to drink, both locally and
well away from Stanford.
I certainly do not condone drinking
and driving as a reasonable option for stu
dents who do such. But it would be naive
for the University to ignore that 18-to-22-
year-olds can be remarkably stupid and
that I)UI incidents, both those that get
caught and those that don't, will signifi
cantly increase if the alcohol policy on
campus gets more strict.
Shuttles to San Francisco and even Palo
Alto might help, but unless those shuttles

run all night and cover a broad area, they
will be of only limited use in preventing
students from driving while intoxicated.
Saturday's incident occurred in resi
dential Palo Alto away from any current
Stanford shuttle routes and well after any
shuttles would be running anyway. And
increased educational events about drunk
driving would seem to be of little good —
it's not like Stanford students aren't al
ready well aware of the risks involved, as
reaction to this weekend's incident among
my friends and others around campus has
shown.
If the thinking behind tightening the
alcohol rules on campus is that it will in
crease student safety, then perhaps some
more assessments about the dangers of in
creased student drinking off campus need
to be made.

Residential Education responds to
concerns about disciplinary consequences
Ezra Callahan sent me his letter to The
Daily prior to publication, and 1 would like
to respond concerning some of the facts in
the article and in the letter .The information
in the article was somewhat misleading in

only stating what might take place as it re
lates to a violation of the residence agree
ment (the document that the residence
deans enforce) and other University disci
plinary actions that might result from a
DUI incident. Let me share with you some
of those details.
