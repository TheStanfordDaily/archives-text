## Cardinal heads to nationals 
### DAN TARON 
Stanford's synchronized swimming
squad qualified for Collegiate Nation
als last weekend, topping four teams
over the course of two days and assert
ing its dominance in the West.
The weekend began with a Saturday
meet against Michigan, Washington,
Arizona and the University of Incar
nate Word. The Cardinal easily defeat
ed all four teams, notching an overall
score of 90 points, which dwarfed the
55 scored by second-place Incarnate
Word.
The Cardinal's Saturday effort was
spearheaded by senior Stephanie
Joukoff, junior Jennifer Kibler and
freshman Ashley McHugh. The three
swimmers' dominance began with a
trio performance, which featured a
risky "throw" move at the beginning,
where McHugh was lifted out of the
water and thrown gracefully into the
air. The perfect execution of this move,
combined with the sound technical
performance over the remainder of
routine, earned the trio first place over
Stanford's second trio. Incarnate Word
and Michigan followed in third and
fourth, respectively.
Joukoff and Kibler continued to
lead the Cardinal in the duet competi
tion, using unusually long and difficult
"figures" to top Stanford's second duet
as well as duets from Washington and
Incarnate Word. "Figures" indicate
that the swimmers are upside down un
derwater, with their legs moving syn
chronously above the water.
Mcllugh rounded out Stanford's
dominant performance with a narrow
win in the solo competition, defeating

two Incarnate Word soloists as well as
one Arizona soloist. McHugh's routine
featured several exquisitely performed
"rockets," which involved her starting
in an upside-down position under
water then using her arms to propel
herself out of the water, feet-first.
"I was really focused on hitting those
rockets," McHugh said. "I think our
whole team was focused today, and
that's why we executed so well."
While Kihler, Joukoff, and McHugh
led Stanford's charge on Saturday, the
return of freshman Cassidy Ramage
was another major highlight for the
Cardinal. Ramage entered the season
with four stress fractures in her back
and returned Saturday to make a
major contribution in a trio perfor
mance as well as with the overall team.
"My back's not at 100 percent yet,

but it's definitely getting better," Ram
age said. "It affects me a little in prac
tice, but during the meet I just try to
forget it."
Ramage's return is viewed by her
coaches as another major piece of the
championship puzzle that Stanford is
steadily putting together this season.
"It has been a big challenge to rehab
her back," assistant coach Shannon
Montague said. "[Ramage] is essential
to the success of our team at Collegiate
Nationals."
With Ramage back in form and the
team at full momentum, Stanford was
able to defeat Arizona and Washington
in the Western Regionals meet on Sun
day.
Kibler, Joukoff and McHugh led the
Cardinal again with another win in the
trio event, swimming the same routine.

McHugh also swam the same routine to
notch first place in the solos.
In the duet competition, however, it
was sophomore Sheila Sadovnik and
junior Joanne Taylor leading the way
for Stanford, defeating Joukoff and Ki
bler on their way to first place.
Finally, Stanford won the team com
petition as well, easily outpacing the
Huskies and Wildcats.
The win in the Western Regionals
Sunday demonstrated Stanford's
depth and qualified the Cardinal for
Collegiate Nationals.
"We are very proud with the perfor
mance of our routines," head coach
Heather Olson said. "We still have a
month left to prepare for Collegiate
Nationals. We are in great shape and
on the way to winning the Champi
onship."
