# The
						sport of the brave
## Table tennis ups the ante 
### 
I'm always looking for my big break. I'm always
looking fora get-rich-quick scheme, a way to
become famous, a way to become the next
prodigy. I want to be the best, the MVP, the All-
Star. This summer, that chance, that opportunity,
that sport... was table tennis.
Ping pong to recreational players, table tennis
has been a lifelong passion of mine. In all seri-

ousness, I'm no slouch at table
tennis, also known as "The
Sport of the Gods." I was the
best player in my high school,
winning six straight matches to
win a March Madness-style
tournament. In fact, even after a
lifetime of playing soccer and
baseball, and four years of play-'
ing golf in high school, I'd go so

far to say that table tennis is my best sport. I
know, it's sad.
So this summer, after I got to the point where I
could basically beat anyone I faced, I decide J that
this was my ticket to superstardom.
I was going to be the next young stud to rise up
the table tennis ranks.
In all honesty, I wasn't exactly sure if there were
"ranks" for me to rise up, or if I could really be called
a "young stud," but that's not the point.
Anyway, in my fame and fortune-driven goal, I
decided to step it up to the next level, so I went to the
local table tennis club. Again, I had no idea that there
was a local table tennis club, but you'd be surprised
with what you can find on public access infomercials.
(On a side note, I own 12 New and Improved Pasta
Pots. Each has a collander in the lid! What more do
you need in life?)
So I entered the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle
School Gym in Sausalito and witnessed table tennis
nirvana. There were five beautiful Harvard tables
with taut nets, perfect legs and impeccable paint. My
ears were inundated with the sweet, hollow sound of
celluloid on formica.
It was clear by the serious lack of a female pres
ence and intense friendliness shown to me by the
members of the club that they didn't get a lot of visi
tors. Rut they were all very nice and invited me to
play in a couple matches.
1 should have walked out of the dmrs right there.
I would still have my dream and my pride intact. But
no, I'm not that bright.
