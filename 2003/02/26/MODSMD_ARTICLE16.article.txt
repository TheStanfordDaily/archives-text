# The 						sport of the brave
## Table tennis ups the ante 
### 
I'm always looking for my big break. I'm always
looking fora get-rich-quick scheme, a way to
become famous, a way to become the next
prodigy. I want to be the best, the MVP, the All-
Star. This summer, that chance, that opportunity,
that sport... was table tennis.
Ping pong to recreational players, table tennis
has been a lifelong passion of mine. In all seri-

ousness, I'm no slouch at table
tennis, also known as "The
Sport of the Gods." I was the
best player in my high school,
winning six straight matches to
win a March Madness-style
tournament. In fact, even after a
lifetime of playing soccer and
baseball, and four years of play-'
ing golf in high school, I'd go so

far to say that table tennis is my best sport. I
know, it's sad.
So this summer, after I got to the point where I
could basically beat anyone I faced, I decide J that
this was my ticket to superstardom.
I was going to be the next young stud to rise up
the table tennis ranks.
In all honesty, I wasn't exactly sure if there were
"ranks" for me to rise up, or if I could really be called
a "young stud," but that's not the point.
Anyway, in my fame and fortune-driven goal, I
decided to step it up to the next level, so I went to the
local table tennis club. Again, I had no idea that there
was a local table tennis club, but you'd be surprised
with what you can find on public access infomercials.
(On a side note, I own 12 New and Improved Pasta
Pots. Each has a collander in the lid! What more do
you need in life?)
So I entered the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle
School Gym in Sausalito and witnessed table tennis
nirvana. There were five beautiful Harvard tables
with taut nets, perfect legs and impeccable paint. My
ears were inundated with the sweet, hollow sound of
celluloid on formica.
It was clear by the serious lack of a female pres
ence and intense friendliness shown to me by the
members of the club that they didn't get a lot of visi
tors. Rut they were all very nice and invited me to
play in a couple matches.
1 should have walked out of the dmrs right there.
I would still have my dream and my pride intact. But
no, I'm not that bright.


Spencer Porter
I decided to play a couple match
es against them.
Plain and simple, I was out of
my league in my first match.
Maybe it was nerves, maybe a lack
of preparedness, but I attribute it
to the fact that the man I played
noticed my Stanford T-shirt and
noted that all of his children ap

plied but none got in. He was
avenging thin envelopes that I had
very little to do with. I can't com
pete against fatherly devotion.
I stumbled through my first
match scoring all of one point, a
service error by the dude I was play
ing. I was in shambles. Every shot
my opponent hit had spin on it that
would have had him burned at the
stake in the 1600s. I would dive to
my left only to see the ball jump
right, rush the table for the drop
shot only to have it jump at my face;

suffice it to say, it was comical.
Thankfully, this was the club's
best player, and even though he
wiped the lloor with me, I wasn't to
tally out of my league. 1 came back
and won my next two matches
against guys who obviously did not
like losing to a newcomer who says
"hella tight" more times than is so
cially acceptable.
In my final match of the
evening, I felt it was polite to take
on the president of the club, a
charming British fellow in his six

ties. Alter getting my confidence
boosted by my previous two wins
against quality opponents, I was
feeling pretty good about going up
against a graying Paul McCartney
look-alike.
God, was I wrong.
It wasn't that he had overpower
ing stuff, or wicked spin, but he
would just hit everything back to
me. I would smash the crap out of
the ball, but he anticipated my shot
what seemed like three seconds in
advance and would simply return

it. Smash-return, smash-return,
smash-return. It was the most frus
trating game I ever played — he
got in my head faster than the latest
Avril song. (He was a skSer boi, she
said see you later boy, he wasn't
good enough for her.)
After dropping the second and
third games to him (table tennis is
best of five), I tried outthinking him.
Guess what — that didn't work, ei
ther. I felt like I was in Star Wars,
having the force used against me in
cruel and unusual ways.

So after dropping my final
match to the fifth Beatle, I packed
up my stuff and my short-lived
table tennis career. Maybe I'll come
out of retirement, maybe I won't.
As for now, 1 guess I'll just keep my
eyes open for my next break
through sport.
I really have got to start playing
badminton.

through sport.
I really have got to start playing

I'm always looking for my big break. I'm always
looking fora get-rich-quick scheme, a way to
become famous, a way to become the next
prodigy. I want to be the best, the MVP, the All-
Star. This summer, that chance, that opportunity,
that sport... was table tennis.
Ping pong to recreational players, table tennis
has been a lifelong passion of mine. In all seri-

ousness, I'm no slouch at table
tennis, also known as "The
Sport of the Gods." I was the
best player in my high school,
winning six straight matches to
win a March Madness-style
tournament. In fact, even after a
lifetime of playing soccer and
baseball, and four years of play-'
ing golf in high school, I'd go so

far to say that table tennis is my best sport. I
know, it's sad.
So this summer, after I got to the point where I
could basically beat anyone I faced, I decide J that
this was my ticket to superstardom.
I was going to be the next young stud to rise up
the table tennis ranks.
In all honesty, I wasn't exactly sure if there were
"ranks" for me to rise up, or if I could really be called
a "young stud," but that's not the point.
Anyway, in my fame and fortune-driven goal, I
decided to step it up to the next level, so I went to the
local table tennis club. Again, I had no idea that there
was a local table tennis club, but you'd be surprised
with what you can find on public access infomercials.
(On a side note, I own 12 New and Improved Pasta
Pots. Each has a collander in the lid! What more do
you need in life?)
So I entered the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle
School Gym in Sausalito and witnessed table tennis
nirvana. There were five beautiful Harvard tables
with taut nets, perfect legs and impeccable paint. My
ears were inundated with the sweet, hollow sound of
celluloid on formica.
It was clear by the serious lack of a female pres
ence and intense friendliness shown to me by the
members of the club that they didn't get a lot of visi
tors. Rut they were all very nice and invited me to
play in a couple matches.
1 should have walked out of the dmrs right there.
I would still have my dream and my pride intact. But
no, I'm not that bright.

I decided to play a couple match
es against them.
Plain and simple, I was out of
my league in my first match.
Maybe it was nerves, maybe a lack
of preparedness, but I attribute it
to the fact that the man I played
noticed my Stanford T-shirt and
noted that all of his children ap

plied but none got in. He was
avenging thin envelopes that I had
very little to do with. I can't com
pete against fatherly devotion.
I stumbled through my first
match scoring all of one point, a
service error by the dude I was play
ing. I was in shambles. Every shot
my opponent hit had spin on it that
would have had him burned at the
stake in the 1600s. I would dive to
my left only to see the ball jump
right, rush the table for the drop
shot only to have it jump at my face;

suffice it to say, it was comical.
Thankfully, this was the club's
best player, and even though he
wiped the lloor with me, I wasn't to
tally out of my league. 1 came back
and won my next two matches
against guys who obviously did not
like losing to a newcomer who says
"hella tight" more times than is so
cially acceptable.
In my final match of the
evening, I felt it was polite to take
on the president of the club, a
charming British fellow in his six

ties. Alter getting my confidence
boosted by my previous two wins
against quality opponents, I was
feeling pretty good about going up
against a graying Paul McCartney
look-alike.
God, was I wrong.
It wasn't that he had overpower
ing stuff, or wicked spin, but he
would just hit everything back to
me. I would smash the crap out of
the ball, but he anticipated my shot
what seemed like three seconds in
advance and would simply return

it. Smash-return, smash-return,
smash-return. It was the most frus
trating game I ever played — he
got in my head faster than the latest
Avril song. (He was a skSer boi, she
said see you later boy, he wasn't
good enough for her.)
After dropping the second and
third games to him (table tennis is
best of five), I tried outthinking him.
Guess what — that didn't work, ei
ther. I felt like I was in Star Wars,
having the force used against me in
cruel and unusual ways.

So after dropping my final
match to the fifth Beatle, I packed
up my stuff and my short-lived
table tennis career. Maybe I'll come
out of retirement, maybe I won't.
As for now, 1 guess I'll just keep my
eyes open for my next break
through sport.
I really have got to start playing
badminton.
