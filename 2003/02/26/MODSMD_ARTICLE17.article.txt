# Awarding the shameful, sad
## 
### 
Whether it's rappers wearing throw
back jerseys, athletes trying to be
musicians or Anna Kournikova
popping up next to (or under) En
rique Iglesias in a music video, it's clear that
sports and music have a lot in common. So, in
honor of Sunday's Grammy Awards, I've tried to
bring some of these comparisons to light, compil
ing my own list of quasi-awards for athletes based
on their musical second cousins.
To speed vtp the proceedings, I'm going to go

ahead and thank God for (he
whole shebang at the outset, so
each of the recipients doesn't
have to.
The first award of the
evening is the 50 Cent Award
for Unbelievable and Unsur
passed Hype, and the winner is
everyone's favorite 18-year-old
über-phenom, Leßron James.

Getting more national attention than the
weapons inspection process, Leßron has become
a household name months before he will un
doubtedly be the No. 1 pick in June's N BA draft.
His games are on Pay-Per-View, he single-hand
edly sells out 20,000-seat arenas and his choice of
automobiles made headlines in the New York
Times. Shaq, AI and countless other stars have al
ready gone to see him play, trying to check out
whether he is in fact the second coming of a No.
23 who used to wear red and black — much like
the millions that have already been drawn in by
Tupac's possible heir apparent, 50 Cent. No
doubt, in June, you'll be seeing Leßron mouth
the words, "My flow, my show brought me the
dough ..."
The second trophy goes to last year's Anaheim
Angels, and it is the Avril Lavigne Award for What
the Hell is she Doing or Performing at the Gram
mys. Much like the whiny, faux-punk pop tart
that somehow stole five nominations and a per
forming gig, the Anaheim Angels somehow go
into spring training as the current world champi
ons of baseball. How, I have no idea — as Kid


Ma< levine
Rock said, "only God knows why." Although,
if I were you, I'd put some serious loot down
that the Angels don't even make the playoff's,
let alone get near another ring anytime soon.
And, what's worse, 1 honestly think they'll go
down in the category of the 1997 Florida
Marlins and Milli Vanilli as the most dubious
success stories of all time — although it may
not be lair to put old Rob and Fabrice in the
same bunch as Avril, the Angels and Wayne
Huizenga's half-season rotisserie squad.
The next piece of hardware is the Fred
Durst Award for Pure Rage and Auger, and
the winner is the recently traded Gary Pay
ton. Dealt last week after 13 amazing but
highly volatile years as a Seattle Supersonic,
Payton has been on an absolute tear all
week, ripping apart Sonics owner Howard
Schultz for trading him. By no means has
The Glove ever been quiet — his trash-talk
ing skills are the stuff of legends. But the
trade to Milwaukee has definitely brought
Payton's venom to a new level, much like
Limp Bizkit's frontman, who just released a
song called "Just Drop Dead," supposedly
in response to Britney Spears playing him
after they hooked up.
The honorable Pete Rose is the recipient
of the night's next award, the Ol' Dirty Bas
tard Award for Trying to Jumpstart a Ca
reer while Suspended/Incarcerated. For
Pete, it's all pretty simple. Admit to betting
on baseball, which everyone knows you did,
and you'll probably get into Cooperstown.
For ODB, the path to recovery is just as obvi
ous, although maybe a little more difficult —
stop smoking crack and stay out of jail.

Hie second-to-last award goes to English
soccer star David Beckham and is the I am
Embarrassed to Actually Like you, but I Do
Award. I seriously can't believe that I'm
putting this down on paper — it must have
been the mid-column shots ofJager — but I
do somehow like Timberlake's new music.
Likewise, I can't find it in me to hate Beck
ham, although he is married to a Spice Girl
and exudes all the qualities one might asso
ciate with a, how can I put it, baby cat.
The last award of the evening is my per
sonal favorite: the Michael Jackson Award
for Absolute Insanity and Complete Discon
nection from Reality. As should be pretty
obvious, there is only one athlete on earth
capable of taking home such an honor, and
that is Mike Tyson. Watching Jacko serious
ly say things like "and then we woke up at
dawn and went in the hot air balloon . .
can only be matched in the world of sports
(or anywhere for that matter) by Iron Mike
and his constant reality / horror show.
Chewing opponents' ears, getting half of
his face tattooed just days before a fight and
spewing enough ridiculous quotes to fill up
every page of The Daily, Tyson entertains us
in a way only the Kingof Pop knows. And that
should not go unnoticed or unappreciated.
In fact, Tyson is the proud recipient of a
lifetime achievement award.
Mike's actually not here tonight to ac
cept, so on his behalf, I will close by reading
one of my favorite quotes by the honoree,
uttered in a post-fight interview in 2000:
"I'mjust ferocious. I want your heart. I want
to eat your children. Praise be to Allah."
I couldn't have said it better myself .

if I were you, I'd put some serious loot down
that the Angels don't even make the playoff's,
let alone get near another ring anytime soon.
And, what's worse, 1 honestly think they'll go
down in the category of the 1997 Florida
Marlins and Milli Vanilli as the most dubious
success stories of all time — although it may
not be lair to put old Rob and Fabrice in the
same bunch as Avril, the Angels and Wayne
Huizenga's half-season rotisserie squad.
The next piece of hardware is the Fred
Durst Award for Pure Rage and Auger, and
the winner is the recently traded Gary Pay
ton. Dealt last week after 13 amazing but
highly volatile years as a Seattle Supersonic,
Payton has been on an absolute tear all
week, ripping apart Sonics owner Howard
Schultz for trading him. By no means has
The Glove ever been quiet — his trash-talk
ing skills are the stuff of legends. But the
trade to Milwaukee has definitely brought
Payton's venom to a new level, much like
Limp Bizkit's frontman, who just released a
song called "Just Drop Dead," supposedly
in response to Britney Spears playing him
after they hooked up.
The honorable Pete Rose is the recipient
of the night's next award, the Ol' Dirty Bas
tard Award for Trying to Jumpstart a Ca
reer while Suspended/Incarcerated. For
Pete, it's all pretty simple. Admit to betting
on baseball, which everyone knows you did,
and you'll probably get into Cooperstown.
For ODB, the path to recovery is just as obvi
ous, although maybe a little more difficult —
stop smoking crack and stay out of jail.

Hie second-to-last award goes to English
soccer star David Beckham and is the I am
Embarrassed to Actually Like you, but I Do
Award. I seriously can't believe that I'm
putting this down on paper — it must have
been the mid-column shots ofJager — but I
do somehow like Timberlake's new music.
Likewise, I can't find it in me to hate Beck
ham, although he is married to a Spice Girl
and exudes all the qualities one might asso
ciate with a, how can I put it, baby cat.
The last award of the evening is my per
sonal favorite: the Michael Jackson Award
for Absolute Insanity and Complete Discon
nection from Reality. As should be pretty
obvious, there is only one athlete on earth
capable of taking home such an honor, and
that is Mike Tyson. Watching Jacko serious
ly say things like "and then we woke up at
dawn and went in the hot air balloon . .
can only be matched in the world of sports
(or anywhere for that matter) by Iron Mike
and his constant reality / horror show.
Chewing opponents' ears, getting half of
his face tattooed just days before a fight and
spewing enough ridiculous quotes to fill up
every page of The Daily, Tyson entertains us
in a way only the Kingof Pop knows. And that
should not go unnoticed or unappreciated.
In fact, Tyson is the proud recipient of a
lifetime achievement award.
Mike's actually not here tonight to ac
cept, so on his behalf, I will close by reading
one of my favorite quotes by the honoree,
uttered in a post-fight interview in 2000:
"I'mjust ferocious. I want your heart. I want
to eat your children. Praise be to Allah."
I couldn't have said it better myself .

Did Mac just say he likes Justin Timberlake? Nah,
couldn't have read that right. E-mail him at

Stanford women's rugby play
er Leslie Johnson struggles to
win the ball during a line-out
vs. rival California last week
end. The Cardinal won the
match, 60-5.
Whether it's rappers wearing throw
back jerseys, athletes trying to be
musicians or Anna Kournikova
popping up next to (or under) En
rique Iglesias in a music video, it's clear that
sports and music have a lot in common. So, in
honor of Sunday's Grammy Awards, I've tried to
bring some of these comparisons to light, compil
ing my own list of quasi-awards for athletes based
on their musical second cousins.
To speed vtp the proceedings, I'm going to go

ahead and thank God for (he
whole shebang at the outset, so
each of the recipients doesn't
have to.
The first award of the
evening is the 50 Cent Award
for Unbelievable and Unsur
passed Hype, and the winner is
everyone's favorite 18-year-old
über-phenom, Leßron James.

Getting more national attention than the
weapons inspection process, Leßron has become
a household name months before he will un
doubtedly be the No. 1 pick in June's N BA draft.
His games are on Pay-Per-View, he single-hand
edly sells out 20,000-seat arenas and his choice of
automobiles made headlines in the New York
Times. Shaq, AI and countless other stars have al
ready gone to see him play, trying to check out
whether he is in fact the second coming of a No.
23 who used to wear red and black — much like
the millions that have already been drawn in by
Tupac's possible heir apparent, 50 Cent. No
doubt, in June, you'll be seeing Leßron mouth
the words, "My flow, my show brought me the
dough ..."
The second trophy goes to last year's Anaheim
Angels, and it is the Avril Lavigne Award for What
the Hell is she Doing or Performing at the Gram
mys. Much like the whiny, faux-punk pop tart
that somehow stole five nominations and a per
forming gig, the Anaheim Angels somehow go
into spring training as the current world champi
ons of baseball. How, I have no idea — as Kid
