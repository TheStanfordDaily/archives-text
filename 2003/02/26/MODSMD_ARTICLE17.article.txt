# Awarding the shameful, sad

### 
Whether it's rappers wearing throw
back jerseys, athletes trying to be
musicians or Anna Kournikova
popping up next to (or under) En
rique Iglesias in a music video, it's clear that
sports and music have a lot in common. So, in
honor of Sunday's Grammy Awards, I've tried to
bring some of these comparisons to light, compil
ing my own list of quasi-awards for athletes based
on their musical second cousins.
To speed vtp the proceedings, I'm going to go

ahead and thank God for (he
whole shebang at the outset, so
each of the recipients doesn't
have to.
The first award of the
evening is the 50 Cent Award
for Unbelievable and Unsur
passed Hype, and the winner is
everyone's favorite 18-year-old
über-phenom, Leßron James.

Getting more national attention than the
weapons inspection process, Leßron has become
a household name months before he will un
doubtedly be the No. 1 pick in June's N BA draft.
His games are on Pay-Per-View, he single-hand
edly sells out 20,000-seat arenas and his choice of
automobiles made headlines in the New York
Times. Shaq, AI and countless other stars have al
ready gone to see him play, trying to check out
whether he is in fact the second coming of a No.
23 who used to wear red and black — much like
the millions that have already been drawn in by
Tupac's possible heir apparent, 50 Cent. No
doubt, in June, you'll be seeing Leßron mouth
the words, "My flow, my show brought me the
dough ..."
The second trophy goes to last year's Anaheim
Angels, and it is the Avril Lavigne Award for What
the Hell is she Doing or Performing at the Gram
mys. Much like the whiny, faux-punk pop tart
that somehow stole five nominations and a per
forming gig, the Anaheim Angels somehow go
into spring training as the current world champi
ons of baseball. How, I have no idea — as Kid
