# Nothing Little about Stanford's track success
## Track and Field travels to the Pac-10 Indoor Invitational in Seattle 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Few long jumpers in Stanford histo
ry have been as successful as senior Mil
ton Little has been during his Stanford
career. He ranks second on the indoor
school record list (7.58 meters) and
fifth on the outdoor (7.80).

Track and Field
at Pac-10 Indoor Invitational, Friday and
Saturday.

"Rarely have I witnessed a more
dramatic improvement from an ath
lete than Milton Little has had," said
Vin Lananna, director of cross country
and track and field.
Little was integral in the men's upset
Pacific-10 Gonference victory in 2002
by claiming the long jump title and
competing in the 200 and as a part of
the 1,600-meter relay team. In 2001
Little claimed 10th at the NCAA
Championships.
This is an impressive resume for any
athlete, let alone a walk-on who only
long jumped for one year in high
school.
"It's been a good experience and I
appreciate the opportunities that this
program gives me," Little said. "Initial
ly, it was difficult, but I wanted to make
the travelling team, and now people
are usually surprised at my results con
sidering I was a walk-on."
During his sophomore year, Little
had a breakthrough season with his
personal best and NCAA qualifying
mark of 25 feet, 7.25 inches. He went
on to place third at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
"I was mad about my third-place
finish. I had a bad day, but it's kept me
more focused since then," Little said.
Last year, Little entered the Pac-10
Championships ranked third and
came away with Stanford's first long
jump title since 1991. His victory
helped the Cardinal claim its second
consecutive Pac-10 Championship.
"I had problems integrating my

sprint speed with my jump technique,"
Little said. "When you go faster, it is
harder to get the height and form cor
rect, and I was fighting that a little last
year.
"All season I wanted to hit eight me
ters (26-3). 1 constantly thought about
it and was never happy. At Pac-lOs, I
just concentrated on the win."
His ability to bring in clutch per
formances and points for the Cardi
nal at big meets has made Little a
team leader, and his desire to learn
and improve have made him a
coach's dream.
"Milton is a motivated, diligent, and
hard-working athlete, and he has capi
talized on every opportunity that he
has had," Lananna said. "His actions
and words embody all that athletic
competition at the college level should
be."
This year, Little has been working
on staying focused and remaining on
top of everything in his athletic and
academic life.
"Things are really starting to come
together this season," Little said. "I've
had a good experience working with
Coach Floreal, and he gives me great
advice on life and staying out of trou
ble."
His efforts this season led to a run
ner-up finish at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Championships last
weekend, where he posted an NCAA
provisional mark of 24-10.50, which is
also No. 2 on Stanford's all-time indoor
list.
Meanwhile, he works in two labs on
campus and is finishing up his major in
biology.
"At times it's difficult to get it all
done," Little said. "It's all about how
you adjust. You have to stay on top of
your stuff, academically and athletical-
This spring, Little is looking to de
fend his outdoor Pac-10 title and re
turn to the NCAA Championships in
June. And with his level-headed atti
tude, the sky may be the limit.
"I've had so many people who have
influenced me, like Coach Floreal and
high jumper Michael Ponikvar. They
tell me to put everything in perspec
tive, and things won't always go the way
I want. They help me stay focused on
my goals.

"Breaking eight meters would be
nice, but I just want to have some fun
and go for the wins."
This weekend the track team re
turns to Seattle for the Pac-10 Invita
tional. Although most of the squad will

begin training for the outdoor season,
Little will be long jumping to hit the au
tomatic qualifying mark. In addition,
some of men's distance runners and
the 1,600-meter relay teams will also be
looking for qualifying times.
