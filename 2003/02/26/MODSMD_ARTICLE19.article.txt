### Deformed Frogs 
Are human activities disrupting
the ecosystem? According to a
study on amphibians published in
Scientific American, the answer is
yes. Since the mid-1990s over 60
species of" frogs, toads and sala
manders on four continents have
turned up with deformities. In
some species as many as one
fourth of the animals are disfig-

ured. Scientists believe that increased ultraviolet
radiation, contaminated water and parasitic in
fections are possible causes. Disfigured animals
also tend to have less fitness — they do not hunt
for food as efficiently and are more susceptible to
predators. That is partly responsible for declin
ing levels of the amphibian population. Andrew
Blaustein, one of the scientists involved in the
study, believes that "the phenomenon observed
in amphibians is probably also occurring in other
species."
Chocolates are good for you?
So you stuffed yourself to death with chocolates
on Valentine's? Well, the American Chemical So
ciety will tell you that chocolate (in moderation)
has some health benefits after all. Scientists be
lieve that chocolate contains polyphenols, which
can prevent bad cholesterol from accumulating

in the arteries. A
study from Uni-

versity of Scranton
showed that choco-

late can reduce bad
cholesterol by 10

percent and the

risk of heart at
tack by 20 per
cent. Other com-!
pounds found in

chocolates are an-

tioxidants, which are also found in green tea and
bread crust. Antioxidants are believed to help
fight cancer. The darker the chocolate, the more
antioxidant it has.
Mission to Mars
The Columbia disaster will probably postpone
spaceflight missions for quite some time. After
the Challenger disaster in 1986, NASA spent al
most three years improving its shuttles. Nonethe
less, the 2004 budget request of $ 15.5 billion sent
to Congress reaffirms the agency's commitment
to space exploration. NASA's planned missions
include a telecommunications satellite to orbit
Mars by the end of the decade and a manned mis
sion to the red planet within 10 years. Propo
nents of spaceflight argue there is much to be
learned from spaceflight that cannot be done on
Earth. As of now, though, NASA's top priority is
to investigate the causes of Columbia's failure
and prevent future disasters.
Gene for Abnormal Heartbeat
Two teams of Chinese scientists announced earli
er this month in the journal Science that they had
discovered the gene causing familial auricular fib
rillation, a common form of arrhythmia (abnor
mal heartbeat). Auricular fibrillation affects about
one percent of adults below 40, rising to 2.3 per
cent for those above 40 and up to 5 percent for
adults over the age of 65. Studying the protein en
coded by the gene can provide a greater under
standing of the pathology behind the arrhythmia.
According to Chen Yihan, one of the team's lead
ers, "the discovery is an important step in fur
thering research in the life sciences in China."
Better Solar Cells
UC-Santa Barbara scientists have developed a
new type of device for use in solar cells. The re
searchers developed a device with a high internal
quantum efficiency, which means they release
more electrons for the photons they absorb. The
key was separating the light-absorption and
charge-carrier transport processes. About 10 per
cent of electrons released can be harnessed for
electrical power. A higher electron density trans
lates into more power. The physicists believe this
alternative is more cost-efficient than current sil
icon-based devices.
Women suffer more from heart attack
According to the American Heart Association,
heart attack is the number one killer for both men
and women in the U.S. — but it kills more women
than men. In the last 20 years, the number of
men dying from heart disease has dropped from
510,000 to 440,000 whereas that for women has
increased from 490,000 to 510,000. There ap
pear to be two main reasons for this trend. First,
surveys have found that most physicians believe
that heart disease has a greater effect on men, so
patients are treated based on this premise. Sec
ond, there are differences in how different gen
ders experience heart disease. Post-menopause
women are more vulnerable to heart disease be
cause of reduced estrogen levels. Further,
women who smoke are more at risk.
