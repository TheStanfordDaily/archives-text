# Black judges talk politics at panel
## 
### FRANCINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of eminent legal experts dis
cussed judicial politicization last night at an
event hosted by the Stanford Black Law Stu
dents Association.
Around 80 students came to hear the
opinions of four black judges who reside in
state, federal and appellate courts. The
panel, organized as part of Black Liberation
Month, was moderated by Stanford Vice
Provost and former judge LaDoris Cordell.
Introducing the event, Law School Dean
Kathleen Sullivan stressed the importance of
having an independent judiciary. Yet she ac
knowledged such a task is made difficult by
external pressures.
"Neutral judgment is extremely impor
tant, but politics are not absent from the ju
diciary process," she said.
Among the issues of key concern were the

process of judicial election, fundraising for
election campaigns and the divulgence of
personal opinion.
"I hate mixing politics with judging," said
Justice James Graves of the Mississippi
Supreme Court, who ran in a contested elec
tion in 1991.
"I enjoyed campaigning, going to church
es and community activities, but I was un
comfortable with having to raise money,"
said Graves, who estimated that his cam
paign cost approximately $25,000.
He added that the majority of contribu
tions came from lawyers who he would later
come into contact with in court. Yet Graves
was adamant that such payments would not
influence his professional work.
"I never, ever, made a decision based on
who gave what to me," he said.
Judge Theodore McKee of the Third Cir
cuit Court of Appeals described his experi
ence of campaigning as, "one of the most

miserable years of my life."
He accepted donations mostly from
lawyers lor his 1984 election campaign, but,
like Graves, maintained that no money was
accepted in return for spec ial treatment.
"II you think you're buying access or favor
by giving me a contribution, then you're
spending your money foolishly," McKee
stated.
Aside from fundraising issues, judicial
elections placed added pressure on judges to
make the "right decisions," said Judge Teri
Jackson of the San Francisco Superior Court.
"Judges should make decisions based on
the merits of the case, not what's popular in
the community," Jackson stated. "I'm con
cerned when politics comes into the court
room and judges are having to look over
their shoulders."
Graves added that the selection process is also

subject to political decision-making.
" There is nothing more political
than being appointed," Graves
said. "I had to call on politicians, be
cause it took influence from people
like that to get there."
McKee shared similar senti
ments, stating that, "anyone who
says merit selection is not political
is naive, a damn fool or a damn
liar."
Referring to a recent case,
Cordell asked the panel il it was ad
visable tor judges to openly state
their private opinions on legal or
political issues. Known as Republi
can Party of Minnesota v. White, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June
that candidates for state judgeships
are allowed to reveal their political
leanings.
"You have to lie very cautious about
what you say publicly," responded

Judge Sharon Chat man of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court.
Graves suited that he idways ap
plies the law regardless of his per
sonal opinion.
"The integrity of my decision
should not be questioned," Graves
said. "I think it would be inappro
priate if I made certain rulings
based only on my personal opin
ions."
In response to the evening,
Dawn Smalls, a third-year law stu
dent, said such events are important
for the black student community at
Stanford.
"The African-American commu
nity as a whole still has a long way to
go," Smalls said. "But the panel are
a shining example of what we can
achieve."
Cordell shared a similar view,
stating that the panel, "served as a
motivator for every one who wants
to go into the judiciary," but espe
cially for minorities who remain un
derrepresented in the judicial sys
tem.
