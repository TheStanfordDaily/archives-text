# Pen and computer finally unite in Tablet PCs
## Doodling Gone Digital 
### JONATHAN THAW EDITORIAL STAFF 
Class notes that you can't find. Class notes that are
totally illegible. Classes where all you want to do is
doodle. The solution to these age-old student prob
lems may be close at hand. It comes in the form of the
Tablet PC, a slimmed-down laptop with a screen you
can write on with a special pen. Could this be the be
ginning of the end for the trusty $ 1.99 Stanford
branded spiral-bound notebook?
Microsoft introduced its version of the Tablet PC
to great fanfare last November. Although there have
been brave attempts to develop a PC that you can
write on in the past, they've always been a flop. Go
Corporation was among the first pioneers of pen
computing in 1991 with its EC) Tablet PC. Apple's
Newton personal ciigital assistant, launched in 1993,
faired no better, in part because its handwriting
recognition wasn't up to snuff.
Now, Microsoft and its partners, which include
big names like Compaq, Acer, Toshiba and Fujit
su, hope that the time of the Tablet PC has final
ly come.

In theory, the new generations of Tablet PCs
should be just as easy to use as pen and paper
and offer several advantages over their spiral-

bound cousins. Tablet PCs should be able to
recognize your handwriting, provide an effi
cient way of storing and sorting different sets
of notes and allow you to search through
these notes fora specific keyword. They

should also allow you to do all the things
you can do on a regular laptop, like surf
ing the Web, writing Word documents
and sending e-mail. A new version of
Windows, Microsoft's Windows XP
Tablet Edition, is designed to take care
of all this.

First, the good news. Writing on
Tablet PCs is a lot of fun. They come with
a special magnetic-tipped pen, which
allows you to write while resting your
hand on the screen. A new application
called Windows Journal mimics a

notebook, into which you can write to
your heart's delight. If you make a
mistake, just score out what you've
written and write it again. There are dif-

ferent colors and thicknesses of pen and a
highlighter that, unlike the real life version,
will never run out.

Notes are saved in separate files, but one of
the most useful features is to be able to search for
certain keywords in dozens of different notes. So if
you're looking for some obscure lecture note writ
ten sometime last year, just enter the word you're
looking for and the Tablet will do its best to find it,
assuming that it can read your hand writing in the
first place.
Reliable handwriting recognition has long been

the holy grail of pen computing. While Palm PDAs
require users to learn a unique way of writing the al
phabet called Graffiti, Tablet PCs are designed to
read your handwriting as you write it. To convert
handwriting into text, you just select the text using a
button on the pen that doubles as a right-hand mouse
button, and ask it to copy the text. Although the
handwriting recognition can work surprisingly well,
the accuracy depends on how consistent your writing
is. If the software doesn't recognize a word you've
written, you have to go through an infuriating and
cumbersome process to correct it.
Thankfully, Microsoft seems to agree that the
Tablet's handwriting recognition is just not good
enough to rely on all the time: All Tablet PC models
come with a keyboard, which either detaches or folds
back behind the screen.
Tablet PCs can also do most of the things you can
do with a regular laptop. They are powerful

enough to run Microsoft Office
and have built in WiFi

wireless connections, allowing you to surf the Web
and watch streaming video in many areas ol the Stan
ford campus. They also come with fairly decent hard
drive sizes, typically 20 to 30 megabytes.
Communication Prof. Fred Turner said he would
prefer students to be taking notes on Tablet PCs
rather than have their heads buried in a laptop. "It
reduces the sound from typing keys, which is annoy
ing," he said.
Turner also believes that writing rather than typ
ing maintains more contact between people in a
group. When you type, you tend to look at the lap
top's screen, while writing allows you to be more in
teractive and maintain contact with a group or class,
he said.
But it seems unlikely that Tablet PCs will replace
students' trusty pen and paper, or even conventional
laptops any time soon.
"I don't see that many advantages over a laptop,"
Turner said. "And you can type faster than you can
write by hand."
There are also points when using a pen to input
data becomes a real pain, like filling in online forms,
Web addresses or passwords. If you're not using

the keyboard, the easiest way to do this is to call
up a virtual onscreen keyboard and tap in the
letters. But you'll need the patience of a saint
if you're trying to type long web addresses.
Tablet PCs also cost several hundred dollars

more than regular, more powerful laptops.
The cheapest Tablet PC, the Compaq TCIOOO,
costs $1,700, while the top-of-the-line Toshiba
Protege 3500 costs $2,300. Meanwhile, the
cheapest Dell laptops, although bulky and non
pen-friendly, start at a mere $700.

"I expect the Tablet PC to meet with a cer
tain amount of success — maybe 5 percent of lap
top sales — but nothing like what Microsoft envi
sions," said David Pogue, technology columnist for
The New York Times in an e-mail correspon
dence.

"It's too expensive, the handwriting
recognition doesn't work, and the hy
brid 1 - i

laptops are much more prone to
breakage," he added.
Although Pogue thinks
that wealthier college kids
might invest in Tablet PCs,
he says that a $500 drop in

price would be a start in making
the PC's more successful.
While a few Tablet

PCs will undoubtedly
crop up in classes
over the coming

months, it seems like
the $ 1.99 Stanford note
book will be with us for
some time yet.

some time yet.


The Compaq TCI 000 Tablet PC has a Transmeta 1 GHz processor, a 10.4-inch color
screen, 256M8 SDRAM and a 30-60GB hard disk. The detachable keyboard folds
back behind the screen when not in use. While there's no CD or DVD drive in the Tablet
itself, a CD-DVD drive is included in the optional docking station. Photo courtesy of

Class notes that you can't find. Class notes that are
totally illegible. Classes where all you want to do is
doodle. The solution to these age-old student prob
lems may be close at hand. It comes in the form of the
Tablet PC, a slimmed-down laptop with a screen you
can write on with a special pen. Could this be the be
ginning of the end for the trusty $ 1.99 Stanford
branded spiral-bound notebook?
Microsoft introduced its version of the Tablet PC
to great fanfare last November. Although there have
been brave attempts to develop a PC that you can
write on in the past, they've always been a flop. Go
Corporation was among the first pioneers of pen
computing in 1991 with its EC) Tablet PC. Apple's
Newton personal ciigital assistant, launched in 1993,
faired no better, in part because its handwriting
recognition wasn't up to snuff.
Now, Microsoft and its partners, which include
big names like Compaq, Acer, Toshiba and Fujit
su, hope that the time of the Tablet PC has final
ly come.

In theory, the new generations of Tablet PCs
should be just as easy to use as pen and paper
and offer several advantages over their spiral-

bound cousins. Tablet PCs should be able to
recognize your handwriting, provide an effi
cient way of storing and sorting different sets
of notes and allow you to search through
these notes fora specific keyword. They

should also allow you to do all the things
you can do on a regular laptop, like surf
ing the Web, writing Word documents
and sending e-mail. A new version of
Windows, Microsoft's Windows XP
Tablet Edition, is designed to take care
of all this.

First, the good news. Writing on
Tablet PCs is a lot of fun. They come with
a special magnetic-tipped pen, which
allows you to write while resting your
hand on the screen. A new application
called Windows Journal mimics a

notebook, into which you can write to
your heart's delight. If you make a
mistake, just score out what you've
written and write it again. There are dif-

ferent colors and thicknesses of pen and a
highlighter that, unlike the real life version,
will never run out.

Notes are saved in separate files, but one of
the most useful features is to be able to search for
certain keywords in dozens of different notes. So if
you're looking for some obscure lecture note writ
ten sometime last year, just enter the word you're
looking for and the Tablet will do its best to find it,
assuming that it can read your hand writing in the
first place.
Reliable handwriting recognition has long been

the holy grail of pen computing. While Palm PDAs
require users to learn a unique way of writing the al
phabet called Graffiti, Tablet PCs are designed to
read your handwriting as you write it. To convert
handwriting into text, you just select the text using a
button on the pen that doubles as a right-hand mouse
button, and ask it to copy the text. Although the
handwriting recognition can work surprisingly well,
the accuracy depends on how consistent your writing
is. If the software doesn't recognize a word you've
written, you have to go through an infuriating and
cumbersome process to correct it.
Thankfully, Microsoft seems to agree that the
Tablet's handwriting recognition is just not good
enough to rely on all the time: All Tablet PC models
come with a keyboard, which either detaches or folds
back behind the screen.
Tablet PCs can also do most of the things you can
do with a regular laptop. They are powerful

enough to run Microsoft Office
and have built in WiFi

wireless connections, allowing you to surf the Web
and watch streaming video in many areas ol the Stan
ford campus. They also come with fairly decent hard
drive sizes, typically 20 to 30 megabytes.
Communication Prof. Fred Turner said he would
prefer students to be taking notes on Tablet PCs
rather than have their heads buried in a laptop. "It
reduces the sound from typing keys, which is annoy
ing," he said.
Turner also believes that writing rather than typ
ing maintains more contact between people in a
group. When you type, you tend to look at the lap
top's screen, while writing allows you to be more in
teractive and maintain contact with a group or class,
he said.
But it seems unlikely that Tablet PCs will replace
students' trusty pen and paper, or even conventional
laptops any time soon.
"I don't see that many advantages over a laptop,"
Turner said. "And you can type faster than you can
write by hand."
There are also points when using a pen to input
data becomes a real pain, like filling in online forms,
Web addresses or passwords. If you're not using

the keyboard, the easiest way to do this is to call
up a virtual onscreen keyboard and tap in the
letters. But you'll need the patience of a saint
if you're trying to type long web addresses.
Tablet PCs also cost several hundred dollars

more than regular, more powerful laptops.
The cheapest Tablet PC, the Compaq TCIOOO,
costs $1,700, while the top-of-the-line Toshiba
Protege 3500 costs $2,300. Meanwhile, the
cheapest Dell laptops, although bulky and non
pen-friendly, start at a mere $700.

"I expect the Tablet PC to meet with a cer
tain amount of success — maybe 5 percent of lap
top sales — but nothing like what Microsoft envi
sions," said David Pogue, technology columnist for
The New York Times in an e-mail correspon
dence.

"It's too expensive, the handwriting
recognition doesn't work, and the hy
brid 1 - i

laptops are much more prone to
breakage," he added.
Although Pogue thinks
that wealthier college kids
might invest in Tablet PCs,
he says that a $500 drop in

price would be a start in making
the PC's more successful.
While a few Tablet

PCs will undoubtedly
crop up in classes
over the coming

months, it seems like
the $ 1.99 Stanford note
book will be with us for
some time yet.
