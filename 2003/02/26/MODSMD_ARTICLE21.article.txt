# Building a better bug
## Robots inspired by the common roach 
### BRONWYN BARNETT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cockroaches may not be man's best
friend, but from a biological standpoint,
they do have their redeeming qualities.
Their speed, stability and versatility have
propelled cockroaches out of garages
and pantries and into the laboratories of
biologists and mechanical engineers
who are studying their anatomy, with
the hope of building robots with similar
capabilities.
The Sprawl Robots Program at Stan
ford's Center for Design Research is one
of the few laboratories that designs and
manufactures biomimetic hexapedal ro
bots — biomimetic because they mimic
biology, and hexapedal because they
have six legs.
"[lnsect legs are] very sophisticated
complex mechanisms," said Jonathan
Clark, a graduate student in mechanical
engineering, who helps develop Sprawl
Robots. "What we've done is try to cap
ture the essence of what they do in a sim
ple mechanical structure."
The typical Sprawl Robot is a little
larger than an adult's hand, though
there are many prototypes of various
sizes. With pistons thrusting the legs, sev
eral different types of plastics comprising
their bodies, valves and actuators to con
trol the movements, all encasing motors
and electrical wires, these robots look
anything but simple. Motors control the

angle of the legs, which in turn makes
the robot accelerate or decelerate.
With amusing names like Sprawlita,
Sprawley Davidson and Porta-Sprawl,
these contraptions look like something
out of a science fiction film, which is fit
ting, considering the creatures they are
based on.
So why cockroaches?
"Cockroaches are very interest ing be
cause they're very hard to kill," Clark
said. They can travel at speeds of up to
50 body-lengths per second — much
faster than humans, proportionally
speaking. Their brains and eyes may not
be as sophisticated, but their legs take up
much of the slack, which is one reason
for their fortitude.
"When roaches are running on
rough terrain, they don't really think
about it... they just run," Clark said. "If
their foot doesn't land where they want
it to, it's all caught up in their suspension
system."
So far, the engineers have succeeded
in imitating the "mechanical intelli
gence" of a roach's legs. It takes just
seven lines of computer code to instruct
a robot to run.
"[The robot]just runs, and if it hits an
obstacle, it just rolls with it and keeps
going, which is a very different approach
than traditional legged robots," Clark
said.
Another approach that sets Sprawl
Robots apart is a novel manufacturing

technique, called Shape Deposition
Manufacturing. With the manufactur
ing, different materials are layered and
shaped before another layer is added,
ensuring greater precision and overall
quality. A softer, more flexible substance
can be embedded inside a stiffer one —
all encasing functional parts, such as mo
tors and electrical wires — to create a
working hip joint or other mechanism.
"We can build it tough and we can
build it small, which would be very diffi
cult to create using traditional [manufac
turing] methods," Clark said.
According to Clark, "one of the big
problems, generally speaking, with
building robots, is that they tend to fall
apart." With SDM, however, a robot's

"downtime is much, much less than
[would be] had we done it via traditional
manufacturing techniques," he added.
So what uses do these robots have?
"Legged robots, in general, are very
appealing because they have the poten
tial to go places that wheeled vehicles
can't," Clark said. "Wheeled vehicles are
incredible ... but they work the best on
an artificial surface."
Since there is still a "significant por
tion of the earth that we can't get to with
[a] Honda Civic," legged robots could
prove very important, he said.
"There's great promise for legged ve
hicles," Clark added. The robots can help
