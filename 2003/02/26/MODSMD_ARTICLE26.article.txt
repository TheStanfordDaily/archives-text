# Summit probes the future of life

### CAROLINE MOORE-KOCHLACS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Walking into the Future of Life Summit
last Wednesday, 1 found myself in a world
of biological progress. Posters of Time
magazine science covers hung from the
ceiling as a crowd mingled and checked in.
Excitement and conversation tilled the be
ginning of the summit, hosted by Time to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of James
Watson and Francis Crick's discovery of
the structure of DNA.
I began with a tutorial on nanotechnol
ogy and nanomedicine led by Ralph C.
Merkle of the Foresight Institute. Merkle
excitedly predicted nanodevices that
would clean out arteries, correct DNA, di
gest bacteria and supply oxygen. I lis goal,
echoed by several speakers during the
summit, is to get to the point where science
is extending the average human lifespan
by one year, every year.
The summit continued onstage as
James Watson was interviewed by ABC
News Correspondent Robert Krulwich.
Dinner followed. Conversation picked
up as the group of about 350 speakers,
participants, and journalists got to know
each other. Eight great minds from
Richard Dawkins of Oxford to Caroline
Kovac from IBM Life Sciences took the
podium and predicted scientific advances
in the next 10 years, primarily medical, fo

t using on individual therapy and cures.
Conversations shifted to how distant
these future medical advances are, at a
time when America had been on orange
alert fora week and a half and last week's
news brought daily tragedy from around
the world. Monday: Chicago, Tuesday:
South Korea, Wednesday: Iran. Thursday
would follow with Rhode Island.
Thursday was a 14-hour day. Panels of
experts talked about topics ranging from
genetically modified foods to designer ba
bies. The biodiversity panel painted a
bleak picture for the future. Edward O.
Wilson from Harvard said that excluding
major extinctions in recent times, one out
of one million species becomes extinct
each year. The impact of humans has
caused the rate to increase to 1,000 out of
one million each year.
Yet when asked if they were optimists,
the panel responded positively. As
Thomas Lovejoy of the H.John Heinz 111
Center put it,"I have to be. No point in
just moaning."
Embryonic stem cell research pro
duced the most heated debate. Daniel
Callahan from the Hasting Center sug
gested that there was no obligation to do
embryonic stem cell research, causing
James Watson to shout into the micro
phone from the audience, "That's crap!"
After the expected moment of stunned si
lence following a 74-year-old Nobel laure

ate shouting the word "crap," about half
the audience broke into applause. The ap
plause was repeated a few minutes later
when a high school teacher from Florida
said that not using the leftover embryos
from in vitro fertilization for research
would be "immoral."
But the conference left room for casual
conversions. My favorite conversations
were with high school teachers. I loved
their excitement because they were not
only star-struck but also could not wait to
tell their students about their experiences
when they got back to school. 1 watched
one gather the autographs of all the speak
ers to put up in her classroom.
Friday brought two topics that every
one had been waiting for: biowarfare and
lifespan.
Raymond Zilinskas, director of the
Chemical and Biological Weapons Non
proliferation Program at Monterey Insti
tute of International Studies, gave a break
down of the biological weapons program
in the USSR during the Cold War. There
were more than 45 biowarfare institutes
and production facilities.
Zilinskas said that all of Iraq's biological
weapons and production could fit in half
of one of the larger USSR facilities. He
suggested that the best defense against
biowarfare is to strengthen international
conventions and instill ethics in scientists.
Finally, what to do with all this medical

progress if biological weapons don't get to
us first? A panel titled, "Lifespan: How
long? How fun?" explored this issue.
About a third of the audience believed
they would live to be 100. Raymond
Kurzweil, noted futurist, claimed that he
would live to 1,000.
"I'm very touched by your faith in
progress," responded Baroness Susan
Greenfield of Oxford.
There was general agreement that ex
pected lifespan would increase significant
ly enough to change social structure.

Greenfield suggested that a woman
could freeze her eggs when she was young
and become sterilized, then pick when she
has a child. Kurzweil and Jaron Lanier,
who coined the term "virtual reality,"
agreed that in the future folks would
spend a lot of time in virtual reality.
The final question to the panel: "What
are the central core of human values?"
Lanier answered, "Faith that the per
son in front of us really exists. Once you
have identified someone as real, try to be
kind."
