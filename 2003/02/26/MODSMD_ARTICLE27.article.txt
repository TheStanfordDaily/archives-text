# Health 101: date rape drugs
## 
### 
According to a Universi
ty of Ohio study, some
2,400 cases of rape na
tionwide involve the
use of date rape drugs such as
Rohypnol and GHB. And these
are only the cases where the vic
tims were able to identify that
they were raped and reported it.
Last weekend, I met a victim of
date rape drugs. Her story is up
setting, but I hope that her
tragedy becomes a lesson.
Three years ago, Christy (not
her real name) was invited to a

house party in
her hometown
of Dallas, Texas.
She was 21 back
then and de
scribed herself
as an avid club
ber and raver.
She was not
naive to the

words "GHB", "ecstasy" and
"date rape drugs." But she was
naive in thinking that she could
never be a victim. That night she
found out, never say never.
Christy does not recall how it
happened or who did it to her.
All that she remembers is waking
up the next morning in her car
with her clothes torn off. She no
ticed that she felt extremely
hung-over even though she had
no alcoholic beverages because
she was planning to drive herself
home after the party.
"I had been around drugs and
such, and had heard enough sto
ries to realize at that moment in
the car t hat I was a victim of date
rape with some drug," Christy
recalled.
Christy did not tell anyone be
cause she was afraid of "the po
lice, family and friends." Howev
er, she did go to the doctor and
got herself checked for HIV and
other conditions. Luckily, she did
not end up with any life-threat
ening disease, but she has had to
live with the fact that she has been
raped.
"And that is the hardest part
— knowing that someone used
me and dumped me like trash in
my car," Christy said. "I wish I
could have protected myself
somehow, I don't like being the
victim."
Christy could have protected
herself had she gone to the party
with a friend. She could have also
thought twice before accepting a
soda from a stranger who
showed interest in her. "It must
have been the drink, I. should
have not accepted it."
Date rape drugs are danger
ous and are becoming more com
mon because of the ease of their
administration and use. Two of
the most common date rape
drugs are GHB and Rohypnol.
Both of them are illegal in the
United States but readily avail
able from different sources.
Rohypnol is smuggled into
the United States from Mexico
and Colombia, the two produc
tion sites used by HofTman-
Laßoche, the main manufactur
er of Rohypnol. In other coun
tries Rohypnol is a legal pre

anesthetic drug and prescription
sleeping pill.
Sold legally in health food
stores until 1990 as a bodybuild
ing drug, GHB is now illegal but
it is being produced in "street
labs," consisting of bathtubs or
kitchen sinks. GHB is manufac
tured from common household
cleaning materials like drain
cleaner and caustic soda. There is
a narrow margin between a dose
that can give you a "high" and
one that can kill you.
GHB
GHB is easily mistaken for
water because it is usually found
in small clear plastic bottles, eye
drop bottles and even Gatorade
bottles. It has a very salty and
soapy taste so rapists mix it into
drinks that are bitter, such as al
cohol or cranberry juice. A victim
cannot tell if GHB has been
slipped into her drink because
GHB is odorless and clear. Taste
would be the only way to detect it,
if possible. Once mixed with a
drink, GHB takes 10 to 20 min
utes to have an effect. GHB can
produce drowsiness, nausea,
seizures, severe respiratory de
pression, amnesia, hypotonia,
vomiting and even death. GHB's
dosage is difficult to regulate and
when mixed with alcohol, the ef
fects are unpredictable and very
dangerous.
Rohypnol
Rohypnol produces a sedative
effect, amnesia, muscle relax
ation and slowing of psychomo
tor responses. Sedation usually
occurs 15 to 20 minutes after it is
taken and lasts for several hours.
Rohypnol is used as a date rape
drug. People around the country
have been raped after the drug
was slipped into their drinks by
an attacker. The drug has no
odor or taste so victims do not re

alize what is happening. After 10
minutes of ingestion, the victim
may feel disoriented and nause
ated as well as simultaneously too
hot or too cold. She can have
trouble speaking and moving
and will eventually pass out. Vic
tims have no memory of what
happened to them while under
the influence of the drug. More
over, they cannot tell if they were
sexually assaulted or drugged be
cause the drug metabolizes
quickly and is undetectable 72
hours after ingestion.
New technology
Drink Safe Technology has
created drink testing strips and
coasters that work like litmus
paper strips. The strips are small
and can fit in your pocket. They
can be used discreetly. The prob
lem is that it is not effective for
drinks that contain milk or creme
products.
Furthermore, the manufac
turers of Rohypnol have refor
mulated the drug to make it
more detectable. When put in a
light-colored drink, Rohypnol
will turn the beverage bright
blue. If it is put in a dark colored
beverage, the beverage will ap
pear cloudy. The new Rohypnol
will also dissolve more slowly and
form small chunky pieces.
But it will take some time for
the new Rohypnol to hit the
streets. Until then, be smart
about what you do and be realis
tic about the risks you impose on
yourself in any situation.
"Don't think it can't happen to
you just because you're in a fa
miliar environment. I didn't
think it could happen, but it did."
I wish someone would have
told Christy that three years ago.

ty of Ohio study, some
2,400 cases of rape na
tionwide involve the
use of date rape drugs such as
Rohypnol and GHB. And these
are only the cases where the vic
tims were able to identify that
they were raped and reported it.
Last weekend, I met a victim of
date rape drugs. Her story is up
setting, but I hope that her
tragedy becomes a lesson.
Three years ago, Christy (not
her real name) was invited to a

house party in
her hometown
of Dallas, Texas.
She was 21 back
then and de
scribed herself
as an avid club
ber and raver.
She was not
naive to the

words "GHB", "ecstasy" and
"date rape drugs." But she was
naive in thinking that she could
never be a victim. That night she
found out, never say never.
Christy does not recall how it
happened or who did it to her.
All that she remembers is waking
up the next morning in her car
with her clothes torn off. She no
ticed that she felt extremely
hung-over even though she had
no alcoholic beverages because
she was planning to drive herself
home after the party.
"I had been around drugs and
such, and had heard enough sto
ries to realize at that moment in
the car t hat I was a victim of date
rape with some drug," Christy
recalled.
Christy did not tell anyone be
cause she was afraid of "the po
lice, family and friends." Howev
er, she did go to the doctor and
got herself checked for HIV and
other conditions. Luckily, she did
not end up with any life-threat
ening disease, but she has had to
live with the fact that she has been
raped.
"And that is the hardest part
— knowing that someone used
me and dumped me like trash in
my car," Christy said. "I wish I
could have protected myself
somehow, I don't like being the
victim."
Christy could have protected
herself had she gone to the party
with a friend. She could have also
thought twice before accepting a
soda from a stranger who
showed interest in her. "It must
have been the drink, I. should
have not accepted it."
Date rape drugs are danger
ous and are becoming more com
mon because of the ease of their
administration and use. Two of
the most common date rape
drugs are GHB and Rohypnol.
Both of them are illegal in the
United States but readily avail
able from different sources.
Rohypnol is smuggled into
the United States from Mexico
and Colombia, the two produc
tion sites used by HofTman-
Laßoche, the main manufactur
er of Rohypnol. In other coun
tries Rohypnol is a legal pre

anesthetic drug and prescription
sleeping pill.
Sold legally in health food
stores until 1990 as a bodybuild
ing drug, GHB is now illegal but
it is being produced in "street
labs," consisting of bathtubs or
kitchen sinks. GHB is manufac
tured from common household
cleaning materials like drain
cleaner and caustic soda. There is
a narrow margin between a dose
that can give you a "high" and
one that can kill you.
GHB
GHB is easily mistaken for
water because it is usually found
in small clear plastic bottles, eye
drop bottles and even Gatorade
bottles. It has a very salty and
soapy taste so rapists mix it into
drinks that are bitter, such as al
cohol or cranberry juice. A victim
cannot tell if GHB has been
slipped into her drink because
GHB is odorless and clear. Taste
would be the only way to detect it,
if possible. Once mixed with a
drink, GHB takes 10 to 20 min
utes to have an effect. GHB can
produce drowsiness, nausea,
seizures, severe respiratory de
pression, amnesia, hypotonia,
vomiting and even death. GHB's
dosage is difficult to regulate and
when mixed with alcohol, the ef
fects are unpredictable and very
dangerous.
Rohypnol
Rohypnol produces a sedative
effect, amnesia, muscle relax
ation and slowing of psychomo
tor responses. Sedation usually
occurs 15 to 20 minutes after it is
taken and lasts for several hours.
Rohypnol is used as a date rape
drug. People around the country
have been raped after the drug
was slipped into their drinks by
an attacker. The drug has no
odor or taste so victims do not re

alize what is happening. After 10
minutes of ingestion, the victim
may feel disoriented and nause
ated as well as simultaneously too
hot or too cold. She can have
trouble speaking and moving
and will eventually pass out. Vic
tims have no memory of what
happened to them while under
the influence of the drug. More
over, they cannot tell if they were
sexually assaulted or drugged be
cause the drug metabolizes
quickly and is undetectable 72
hours after ingestion.
New technology
Drink Safe Technology has
created drink testing strips and
coasters that work like litmus
paper strips. The strips are small
and can fit in your pocket. They
can be used discreetly. The prob
lem is that it is not effective for
drinks that contain milk or creme
products.
Furthermore, the manufac
turers of Rohypnol have refor
mulated the drug to make it
more detectable. When put in a
light-colored drink, Rohypnol
will turn the beverage bright
blue. If it is put in a dark colored
beverage, the beverage will ap
pear cloudy. The new Rohypnol
will also dissolve more slowly and
form small chunky pieces.
But it will take some time for
the new Rohypnol to hit the
streets. Until then, be smart
about what you do and be realis
tic about the risks you impose on
yourself in any situation.
"Don't think it can't happen to
you just because you're in a fa
miliar environment. I didn't
think it could happen, but it did."
I wish someone would have
told Christy that three years ago.
