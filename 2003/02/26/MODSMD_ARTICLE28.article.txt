# Technology redefines art of war

### FRANCINE MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As conflict in the Persian Gulf
seems increasingly likely, the U.S.
military is launching a technologi
cal revolution in communications
and weaponry. The battlefield it
seems, has gone digital.
"We've really gone through the
looking-glass here," said John Ar
quilla, associate professor of de
fense analysis at the Naval Post
graduate School in Monterey,
Calif., speaking last week at Stan
ford. "We are beginning to cultivate
war in a way that will allow us to
fight more humanely," he said.
Digital technology has greatly
advanced communications capa
bility on the battlefield. "We are
only powerful to the degree in
which we connect with others,"
said Arquilla, who added that in
telligence means power in times of
conflict.
Computers, software and wire
less communications have revolu
tionized the way data is gathered
and processed. Using a system
known as Force XXI Battle Com
mand Brigade and Below or
FBCB2, army units will be able to
access topographical maps in 2-1)
or 3-D that will allow them to see
the entire battlefield. Blue dots de
pict friendly troops, while red dia
monds signal the enemy.
Such technology has been used
by the military to increase target ef
ficiency, while protecting troops
from "friendly fire" accidents. In
the Persian Gulf War of 1991,
friendly fire resulted in the deaths

of 35 U.S. soldiers and the wound
ing of 72 others, according to De
partment of Defense statistics.
Two navy ships in the Gulf em
ploy similar technology, such as the
Area Air Defense Commander Ca
pability System, which provides a
computerized friend-or-foe picture
of the battlefield.
Global Positioning System de
vices are also advantageous for the
military. "All of a sudden you have
information that you never had be
fore," said Robert Cannon, emeri
tus professor of aeronautics and as
tronautics at Stanford. "GPS pro
vides extreme precision and accu
racy," he added.
Used most recently in Bosnia
and Afghanistan, GPS determines
the exact location and movement of
hostile troops positioned miles
away. Communications between
forces on the ground, surveillance
systems and satellites using GPS can
also be applied to confirm the loca
tion of enemy targets.
Although such technology exist
ed during the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, fewer than 10 percent of
bombs dropped were precision
guided "smart bombs," according
to military estimates. Today, more
than 75 percent of bombs use GPS.
Such weapons strike with deadly
accuracy, according to Martin Li
bicki, senior policy analyst at RAND
Corporation.
"GPS bombing will certainly be
come the norm," Libicki said.
"The significance of having such
precision in military intelligence
and maneuvers cannot be under
estimated."

According to Libicki, greater
precision-bombing and increased
communication will ultimately
mean less dependence on ground
troops, less collateral damage and
fewer casualties.
Such devices do not come cheap,
however. According to Dan Goure,
a defense analyst with the Lexing
ton Institute in Arlington, Va., ap
proximately $40 billion is spent by
the military on communications de
vices per year. But he believes that
such investment is justified.
"What would the alternative be
— carrier pigeons?" Goure said.
"Without question, such technolo
gy is vital. The money is well
spent."
Yet critics also point to the vari
ous drawbacks of such technology.
Like commercial computers, the
military systems are just as suscepti
ble to crashing. Lack of bandwidth
also means that "real-time" move
ments of enemy units are some
times delayed by minutes.
GPS devices are vulnerable to
problems too. "There are situations
under which the system will not
work," admitted Cannon, referring
specifically to crowded, urban set
tings in which tall buildings can
block signals. GPS is also susceptible
to jamming by the enemy.
Yet Goure says that such tech
nology will revolutionize military
warfare. "The system might be vul
nerable to jamming," admitted
Goure, "but the advantages at this
point really do outweigh the disad
vantages. Digital technology has
great implications on both an offen
sive and defensive scale."
