# Grad students seek tax exemptions
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Graduate students from all over the
country, including Stanford, converged on
Washington, D.C., last Thursday as part of
a larger effort to convince U.S. legislators
to return graduate student scholarships to
their previous tax-exempt status.
The Winter Lobbying Day was spon
sored by the National Coalition of Gradu
ate Students For An Affordable and Acces
sible Education, a group that claims the

current taxes on graduate student scholar
ships and stipends create significant finan
cial hardship and may even place graduate
education out of reach for those of lower
income.
"We have just returned from our
largest and hopefully most successful
lobby day to elate," said Alik Widge, a doc
toral student in robotics at Carnegie Mel
lon University, in a letter to the campaign's
supporters. Widge is the legislative con
cerns chair for the National Association of
Graduate-Professional Students, one of

the lead organizations in the coalition. 11c
estimated that more than 80 students
from over 40 universities participated in
the lobbying day.
"Moreover, in the past few weeks, we
have seen unprecedented support from
the university community," Widge added.
This support includes efforts by the
University's Graduate Student Council.
