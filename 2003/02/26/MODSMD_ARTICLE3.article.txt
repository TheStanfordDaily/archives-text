# Grad students seek tax exemptions
## 
### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Graduate students from all over the
country, including Stanford, converged on
Washington, D.C., last Thursday as part of
a larger effort to convince U.S. legislators
to return graduate student scholarships to
their previous tax-exempt status.
The Winter Lobbying Day was spon
sored by the National Coalition of Gradu
ate Students For An Affordable and Acces
sible Education, a group that claims the

current taxes on graduate student scholar
ships and stipends create significant finan
cial hardship and may even place graduate
education out of reach for those of lower
income.
"We have just returned from our
largest and hopefully most successful
lobby day to elate," said Alik Widge, a doc
toral student in robotics at Carnegie Mel
lon University, in a letter to the campaign's
supporters. Widge is the legislative con
cerns chair for the National Association of
Graduate-Professional Students, one of

the lead organizations in the coalition. 11c
estimated that more than 80 students
from over 40 universities participated in
the lobbying day.
"Moreover, in the past few weeks, we
have seen unprecedented support from
the university community," Widge added.
This support includes efforts by the
University's Graduate Student Council.
Council member Surya P. Singh, a doc
toral student in mechanical engineering,
said that the GSC first became in
volved in the campaign through
its association with NAGPS. Me
added that representatives from
the University have gone to
Washington, D.G. and lobbied
for the tax exemption on three
occasions.
"We feel that reinstating the
stipend tax exemption will allow
more students to partake in pro
fessional and graduate studies
who would not otherwise find it fi
nancially feasible to do so and will
allow a better quality of life for stu
dents overall," Singh said.
According to Widge, the national
campaign began two years ago,
growing from one of his own ideas.
"It seemed like a good way to
support graduate and professional
students that was in keeping with
the tax-cutting philosophies of the
current Congress and the Bush ad

ministration," he said. "The coali
tion got started as I contacted my
friends in other organizations,
eventually coming into contact with
University of California Student As
sociation and, through them,
NAGPS."
According to the coalition's Web
site, all graduate student stipends
were tax exempt until tax reform
efforts in 1986. The coalition claims
that graduate students currently
lose $ 100 to $200 of t heir stipends a
month to federal income taxes.
NAGPS President Anika Sandy, a
master's student in education ad
ministration and policy at Howard
University, said current federal tax
laws are unfair because they are
based on an inaccurate picture of the
expense of a graduate education.
"It is imperative that our gov
ernment consolidate the differ
ences between what is listed as the
'real cost' to attend graduate
school and what is listed as the 'ex
penses' to attend," Sandy said.
"The real cost is far greater and
much closer to the reality of the

expenses students incur."
Stanford graduate students may
find this situation exacerbated by the
relatively high cost of living in the
cities neighboring the University.
"Do you think it is easy to sup
port a family, sometimes includ
ing several small children, in Palo
Alto on less than $15,000 a year?"
said David Patel, a Stanford doc
toral student in political science.
"One student in my department is
teaching at a college in San Jose to
help support his family, instead of
doing his own research and ad
vancing [toward] graduation.
Other students support family
members or parents."
The GSC is not the only organi
zation at Stanford supporting the
current campaign.
"Stanford University also sup
ports the fundamental idea,"
Singh said. He noted that Univer
sity administrators have been ad
vising the council on likely con
tacts in Congress. "[The GSC]
plans to coordinate our efforts
with those of the University."

Singh said he did not go to Wash
ington, D.C., but is involved in the cam
paign. He claimed that both parties ap
peared to be receptive to the idea.
"Of the three representatives
who represent the Stanford cam
pus, Senator [Diane] Feinstein ID-
Calif.] was the most supportive of
the idea," Singh said. "It would
help if students contacted her of
fice and expressed their views."
Echoing Singh's perceptions,
Widge said that the coalition will be
focusing its efforts on convincing a
few members of Congress who seem
most likely to sponsor a bill for the
coalition, including Feinstein. Widge
said that although it was highly likely
that the campaign would eventually
succeed, he could not predict when
that success would come.
"There has never been this
kind of broad-based support be
fore," he said. "I cannot give you
a precise timetable. We'd like to
get it passed by the end of this
Congress, but many factors —
most notably the prospect of war
— could affect that."
