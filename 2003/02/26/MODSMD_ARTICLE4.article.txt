# Program offers student discounts
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
.After a short hiatus, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate has reintro
duced the Stanford Saver Program,
which offers students discounts at
area businesses to make off-campus
establishments more accessible.
Small wallet-sized cards were re
cently stuffed underneath dormito
ry doors to announce the return of
this program, designed to help alle
viate the cost of living at Stanford.
The Senate began the program a
few years ago to promote relations
between students and local compa
nies. The Senate's objective in devel
oping the plan was to encourage
Stanford students to explore off
campus businesses and restaurants.

Due to the expensive nature of Sili
con Valley, many students who are
already financially inhibited by tu
ition costs are unable to patronize
off-campus establishments.
Kllie Martin and Joey Natoli, both
sophomores from the Bay Area who
are familiar with the region's high
cost of living, wanted to alleviate the
monetary burdens facing students in
their off-campus ventures and
worked together to revive the aban
doned Stanford Saver Program.
"There are so many incredible
and diverse places nearby," said
Natoli, Seriate Student Life Com
mittee chair. "It's a shame many
students don't go out much be
cause they worry about the cost.
This is a very, very expensive area,
so we knew that this program had

to be continued to help students."
Martin and Natoli contacted
area businesses at the beginning of
last summer to ask if they wanted to
participate. The response was im
pressive. Thirty-eight companies,
ranging from restaurants to book
stores to car rental agencies, chose
to partake. Each business agreed to
offer a fixed discount, ranging from
5 percent to 20 percent and displays
a sticker in its store window to iden
tify it as a member of the Stanford
Saver Program. To receive the dis
count, students must simply show a
valid SU11) card.
Martin said that the discounts
are meant to both broaden stu
dents' horizons while giving them
access to their perennial favorite
businesses, like pizza restaurants.
"Discounts at lesser known
places like Suraj Indian Cuisine are
useful because they hopefully cre
ate an incentive for students to ex
plore a wider variety of off-campus
restaurants and stores than they
would otherwise," she said. "Peo
ple have tolcl me that they check
out the list of businesses offering
discounts before they select a place
to eat out."
The Senate oversees the pro
gram and claims that student feed
back has been very positive.
"Students really like this pro
gram," Natoli said. "We're saving
them money on food and that's some
thing every student appreciates."
Freshman Mike Silva agreed, cit
ing the expense of attending a private
univei'sity and the cost of the upscale
community surrounding Stanford as
drains on student pocketbooks.
"A dollar here and a dollar there
really adds up," he said in response
to the program. "Receiving dis
counts would make going off cam
pus not only more affordable, but
also more attractive, allowing me to
experience life beyond the campus
boundaries."
Martin and Natoli stressed that
there is no catch to this program â€”
no one-time fee nor any other such

ly profit by gaining business they may
not have had if students had not been
offered these discounts.
Additionally, the businesses get free
advertising throughout the Stanford
community, as they are publicized as
being student-friendly and presenting
price cuts to Stanford students.
The wallet-sized cards list the
participating businesses and make
students more aware of the compa
nies, but showing the card is not
necessary to receive the discount.

"The Saver Cards are simply in
tended to provide students with a re
minder of which businesses are most
friendly to Stanford students," Mar
tin said. "We hope that students will
consult their cards when they need a
haircut or want to know where to get
a reasonably priced meal."
Though the ASSU was unable
to distribute the cards to every dor
mitory on campus, it has enough
cards for the entire undergraduate
population. Martin encouraged
students to pick one up from the
ASSU oflice if they are interested.
