# ASSU senators recommended a 10-meal dining plan and laundry plan
## Senate addresses cost of living 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Major initiatives to introduce a flat per-quarter
laundry fee and expand dining plan options were
recommended by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night. The proposals, brought by Senator Sarah
Schulman, a sophomore, were the result of signifi
cant assessments of student needs and communica
tions with the University.
Both resolutions are part of the ASSU's attempt to
address cost-of-living issues on campus. The dining hall
proposal came from the Stanford Dining Committee,
while the laundry plan resulted from communication
between Schulman and Student I lousing Services.
Specifically, Schulman put forth a bill to support
the Stanford Dining Committee's recommendation to
introduce a 10-meal, 35-point per week plan option.
"We felt it was really important for students to

have increased flexibility when it comes to their meal
plan options," said Schulman, who worked with the
committee on the proposal.
Currently, the lowest-priced meal plan includes
14 meals, many of which are unused by students
with busy schedules. Roughly 750 students are ex
pected to benefit from the 10-meal plan option.
However, because of the introduction of the 10-
meal plan, there will be a $17 fall quarter increase in
the 14, 12-flex, and regular dining plans, as well as a
$27 per quarter increase in the lite plan. These price
increases are in addition to 3 percent price increases
in all plans for next year.
The resolution to support the new meal plan passed
by a vote of 12 in favor, zero against and one abstaining.
A letter will be sent to the committee noting the Senate's
support for the recommended meal plan changes.
