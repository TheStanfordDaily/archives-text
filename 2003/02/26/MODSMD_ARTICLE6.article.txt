# ASSU senators recommended a 10-meal dining plan and laundry plan
## Senate addresses cost of living 
### MORGAN SPRINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Major initiatives to introduce a flat per-quarter
laundry fee and expand dining plan options were
recommended by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night. The proposals, brought by Senator Sarah
Schulman, a sophomore, were the result of signifi
cant assessments of student needs and communica
tions with the University.
Both resolutions are part of the ASSU's attempt to
address cost-of-living issues on campus. The dining hall
proposal came from the Stanford Dining Committee,
while the laundry plan resulted from communication
between Schulman and Student I lousing Services.
Specifically, Schulman put forth a bill to support
the Stanford Dining Committee's recommendation to
introduce a 10-meal, 35-point per week plan option.
"We felt it was really important for students to

have increased flexibility when it comes to their meal
plan options," said Schulman, who worked with the
committee on the proposal.
Currently, the lowest-priced meal plan includes
14 meals, many of which are unused by students
with busy schedules. Roughly 750 students are ex
pected to benefit from the 10-meal plan option.
However, because of the introduction of the 10-
meal plan, there will be a $17 fall quarter increase in
the 14, 12-flex, and regular dining plans, as well as a
$27 per quarter increase in the lite plan. These price
increases are in addition to 3 percent price increases
in all plans for next year.
The resolution to support the new meal plan passed
by a vote of 12 in favor, zero against and one abstaining.
A letter will be sent to the committee noting the Senate's
support for the recommended meal plan changes.
The laundry program proposal
suggests implementing a flat per-quar
ter fee that students would pay for un
limited access to laundry machines.
"Currently the laundry pro
gram is outsourced to a compa
ny â€” a for-profit company," Schul
man said. "Stanford feels that if
they take the laundry in-house they
can reduce a lot of the costs in the
long run, and they're better
equipped to handle the mainte
nance on a day-to-day basis."
In this plan, students would be
charged a per-quarter laundry fee,
roughly estimated to be $20 for the
first year of implementation. Prices
in later years would be lower due to
the initial costs of purchasing laun
dry machines. The fee would make
laundry free at the point-of-access,
allowing students to do more loads,
which would hopefully reduce
overstuffing of laundry machines.
Additionally, the fee structure
would allow financial aid packages
to cover laundry for those students
who qualify.
"Cornell and Princeton both
have this system and it works fabu

lously apparently," Schulman said.
The laundry proposal was passed
by a vote of 12 in favor, zero opposed
and one abstaining.
In other business, the Senate ap
pointed Keenon DeVaughn, Kevin
Gao, Hunter Hargraves and Lily Liu
as undergraduate members of the
Nominations Commission. The Sen
ate also appointed Connie Chen,
Ajani Husbands, Jina Hyun, Orlando
Lara and Josh Shipp to the ASSU Arts
Grant Oversight Board to administer
the new Arts Grant Program.
Financial Manager Dave Endel
man also announced that a Web site is
under development for checking ac
count balances online, which would
be available to the financial managers
of groups with ASSU accounts.
The Campaign for Student
Space showed continuing progress.
"We have 97 signatures for the
Campaign for Student Space, so we are
3 signatures short of our target 100,"
said Senator Joey Natoli, a sophomore.
Finally, ASSU President Monica
Henestroza, a senior, reminded sen
ators of tonight's Town Hall Meet
ing with Provost John Etchemendy.
"In years past, when the ASSU
has organized town halls, a lot of
changes have come about, a lot of
important discussions have
emerged," Henestroza said.
