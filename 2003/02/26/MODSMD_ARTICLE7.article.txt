# Survey explores undergrad life
## 
### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University, along with al
most 30 other institutes of higher
education, is conducting a com
prehensive survey of its student
body to evaluate the undergradu
ate experience at Stanford and
how it compares to peer institu
tions.
Last Tuesday, students re
ceived an e-mail from Provost
John Etchemendy informing
them of a survey that would be ad
ministered soon. Two days ago, a
second e-mail, sent out by Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, confirmed that the sur
vey was now online and gave each
student a personal link that pro
vides access to the survey.
"The survey is administered at
most of the colleges and universi
ties who are members of the Con
sortium on Financing Higher Ed
ucation, a group of prestigious pri
vate colleges and universities,"
Etchemendy said.

Initially, some students were
suspicious of both e-mails and
doubted their authenticity, espe
cially because of the joking lan
guage of the Etchemendy e-mail.
The beginning of the e-mail read,
"This is your Provost speaking.
Now don't tell me you didn't know
yon had a Provost, because it will
hurt my feelings."
Also, the e-mails were sent from
an Mi l server and the survey was
also on an MIT server, confusing
the issue further.
In response, Director of Institu
tional Research RanaGlasgal said,
"Provost Etchemendy really did
write that letter, and it's definitely
a legitimate survey." She contin
ued, "It was hoped that a message
from the provost to students
would lend this survey the credi
bility it deserves and show that the
administration, at the highest
level, is serious about getting feed
back and paying attention."
Etchemendy emphasized the
survey's importance as well.
"The results of surveys like this

are extremely important to the
University, so we can see where we
need improvement, what we are
doing well and how we are doing
relative to other prestigious col
leges and universities in the coun
try," he said. "I think we provide
the best undergraduate education
in the country, but we didn't get
there without paying attention to
our students' feedback about their
Stanford experience."
The survey's questions cover
broad topics such as study habits,
advising, extra-curricular involve
ment, time spent on classwork, ex
perience in residences, the use of a
student center, skill development
since high school and the financial
situations of students. The survey
also contains Stanford-specific
questions about access to financial
aid information, the Honor Code
and stress induced by academic or
social concerns.
Student reaction to the survey
has been mixed. While some stu
dents believe that the issues in the
survey are important, others have
various complaints, ranging from
a lack of specificity in answers to in
correct time frames.
"I appreciated the survey's
thoroughness; most of the Univer
sity's aspects were covered," said
sophomore Courtney Smith.
"[But] I'm also surprised that
every question applies only to the
current academic year, as my ex
periences this year and last have
been vastly disparate."
Many students complained
about the wording of questions
and the choices for answers.
"I thought that some of the
questions were too vague," said

sophomore Emily Wood. "For ex
ample, the question about
whether or not you've questioned
certain things, like your opinion
on other races, doesn't leave
room for explanation, and 1 had
no idea if my answer would be in
terpreted in a negative or positive
way. I think my main issue with it
was that some of it seemed to be
geared at getting responses that
the survey makers wanted and
not at fully getting to understand
what student life is like."
Freshman Gem Chien said the
possible answers for multiple
choice questions were too limiting.
"There was no option for me to
choose to accurately describe the
real answer to the questions
asked," Chien said. "I finished the
survey very frustrated and dissatis
fied because hardly any of my an
swers were right."

This year marks Stanford's
first in participating in the
COFHE survey.
"It's a brand-new survey this
year," Glasgal said. "In the past,
COFHE had offered another sur
vey, but we didn't participate be
cause we didn't feel like it reflected
our concerns. This year, however,
the survey has been redesigned to
more closely address our needs, so
we decided to take part."
Etchemendy encouraged more
students to take the survey.
"Students should participate
because this is your University,"
he said. "Even if changes that re
sult from the survey don't directly
benefit you, as future alumni you
will always have a stake in the
quality of the education provided
by the University. Among other
things, if Stanford became
mediocre, it would devalue your

Stanford degree."
Many students have already
filled out the survey.
"More than 1,500 Stanford stu
dents have filled it out on the first
day already, so that's a good start,"
Glasgal said. "That's about 23 per
cent, and we certainly hope the
trend continues. Some of our peers
are getting over 80 percent re
sponse rates, and we'd love to have
a rate like that. It would be great.
The survey closes March 9, and we
should have preliminary results
two to four weeks after that."
Students who take the survey
are eligible for prizes.
"We got a PDA from the book
store, gift certificates to the book
store and lunch with [Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid] Robin
Mamlet, as well as some photo
books about Stanford donated by
the provost," Glasgal added.

student center, skill development
since high school and the financial
situations of students. The survey
also contains Stanford-specific
questions about access to financial
aid information, the Honor Code
and stress induced by academic or
social concerns.
Student reaction to the survey
has been mixed. While some stu
dents believe that the issues in the
survey are important, others have
various complaints, ranging from
a lack of specificity in answers to in
correct time frames.
"I appreciated the survey's
thoroughness; most of the Univer
sity's aspects were covered," said
sophomore Courtney Smith.
"[But] I'm also surprised that
every question applies only to the
current academic year, as my ex
periences this year and last have
been vastly disparate."
Many students complained
about the wording of questions
and the choices for answers.
"I thought that some of the
questions were too vague," said

sophomore Emily Wood. "For ex
ample, the question about
whether or not you've questioned
certain things, like your opinion
on other races, doesn't leave
room for explanation, and 1 had
no idea if my answer would be in
terpreted in a negative or positive
way. I think my main issue with it
was that some of it seemed to be
geared at getting responses that
the survey makers wanted and
not at fully getting to understand
what student life is like."
Freshman Gem Chien said the
possible answers for multiple
choice questions were too limiting.
"There was no option for me to
choose to accurately describe the
real answer to the questions
asked," Chien said. "I finished the
survey very frustrated and dissatis
fied because hardly any of my an
swers were right."

This year marks Stanford's
first in participating in the
COFHE survey.
"It's a brand-new survey this
year," Glasgal said. "In the past,
COFHE had offered another sur
vey, but we didn't participate be
cause we didn't feel like it reflected
our concerns. This year, however,
the survey has been redesigned to
more closely address our needs, so
we decided to take part."
Etchemendy encouraged more
students to take the survey.
"Students should participate
because this is your University,"
he said. "Even if changes that re
sult from the survey don't directly
benefit you, as future alumni you
will always have a stake in the
quality of the education provided
by the University. Among other
things, if Stanford became
mediocre, it would devalue your

Stanford degree."
Many students have already
filled out the survey.
"More than 1,500 Stanford stu
dents have filled it out on the first
day already, so that's a good start,"
Glasgal said. "That's about 23 per
cent, and we certainly hope the
trend continues. Some of our peers
are getting over 80 percent re
sponse rates, and we'd love to have
a rate like that. It would be great.
The survey closes March 9, and we
should have preliminary results
two to four weeks after that."
Students who take the survey
are eligible for prizes.
"We got a PDA from the book
store, gift certificates to the book
store and lunch with [Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid] Robin
Mamlet, as well as some photo
books about Stanford donated by
the provost," Glasgal added.
The University, along with al
most 30 other institutes of higher
education, is conducting a com
prehensive survey of its student
body to evaluate the undergradu
ate experience at Stanford and
how it compares to peer institu
tions.
Last Tuesday, students re
ceived an e-mail from Provost
John Etchemendy informing
them of a survey that would be ad
ministered soon. Two days ago, a
second e-mail, sent out by Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, confirmed that the sur
vey was now online and gave each
student a personal link that pro
vides access to the survey.
"The survey is administered at
most of the colleges and universi
ties who are members of the Con
sortium on Financing Higher Ed
ucation, a group of prestigious pri
vate colleges and universities,"
Etchemendy said.

Initially, some students were
suspicious of both e-mails and
doubted their authenticity, espe
cially because of the joking lan
guage of the Etchemendy e-mail.
The beginning of the e-mail read,
"This is your Provost speaking.
Now don't tell me you didn't know
yon had a Provost, because it will
hurt my feelings."
Also, the e-mails were sent from
an Mi l server and the survey was
also on an MIT server, confusing
the issue further.
In response, Director of Institu
tional Research RanaGlasgal said,
"Provost Etchemendy really did
write that letter, and it's definitely
a legitimate survey." She contin
ued, "It was hoped that a message
from the provost to students
would lend this survey the credi
bility it deserves and show that the
administration, at the highest
level, is serious about getting feed
back and paying attention."
Etchemendy emphasized the
survey's importance as well.
"The results of surveys like this

are extremely important to the
University, so we can see where we
need improvement, what we are
doing well and how we are doing
relative to other prestigious col
leges and universities in the coun
try," he said. "I think we provide
the best undergraduate education
in the country, but we didn't get
there without paying attention to
our students' feedback about their
Stanford experience."
The survey's questions cover
broad topics such as study habits,
advising, extra-curricular involve
ment, time spent on classwork, ex
perience in residences, the use of a
student center, skill development
since high school and the financial
situations of students. The survey
also contains Stanford-specific
questions about access to financial
aid information, the Honor Code
and stress induced by academic or
social concerns.
