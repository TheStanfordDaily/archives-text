# Survey explores undergrad life

### WAYNN LUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University, along with al
most 30 other institutes of higher
education, is conducting a com
prehensive survey of its student
body to evaluate the undergradu
ate experience at Stanford and
how it compares to peer institu
tions.
Last Tuesday, students re
ceived an e-mail from Provost
John Etchemendy informing
them of a survey that would be ad
ministered soon. Two days ago, a
second e-mail, sent out by Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni, confirmed that the sur
vey was now online and gave each
student a personal link that pro
vides access to the survey.
"The survey is administered at
most of the colleges and universi
ties who are members of the Con
sortium on Financing Higher Ed
ucation, a group of prestigious pri
vate colleges and universities,"
Etchemendy said.

Initially, some students were
suspicious of both e-mails and
doubted their authenticity, espe
cially because of the joking lan
guage of the Etchemendy e-mail.
The beginning of the e-mail read,
"This is your Provost speaking.
Now don't tell me you didn't know
yon had a Provost, because it will
hurt my feelings."
Also, the e-mails were sent from
an Mi l server and the survey was
also on an MIT server, confusing
the issue further.
In response, Director of Institu
tional Research RanaGlasgal said,
"Provost Etchemendy really did
write that letter, and it's definitely
a legitimate survey." She contin
ued, "It was hoped that a message
from the provost to students
would lend this survey the credi
bility it deserves and show that the
administration, at the highest
level, is serious about getting feed
back and paying attention."
Etchemendy emphasized the
survey's importance as well.
"The results of surveys like this

are extremely important to the
University, so we can see where we
need improvement, what we are
doing well and how we are doing
relative to other prestigious col
leges and universities in the coun
try," he said. "I think we provide
the best undergraduate education
in the country, but we didn't get
there without paying attention to
our students' feedback about their
Stanford experience."
The survey's questions cover
broad topics such as study habits,
advising, extra-curricular involve
ment, time spent on classwork, ex
perience in residences, the use of a
student center, skill development
since high school and the financial
situations of students. The survey
also contains Stanford-specific
questions about access to financial
aid information, the Honor Code
and stress induced by academic or
social concerns.
Student reaction to the survey
has been mixed. While some stu
