# War film series will finish up tomorrow

### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the United States moves toward war
with Iraq, the Cultural and Social Anthropol
ogy Department's three-week film series
"Documenting War," designed to examine
the impact of war and the media's role in its
portrayal, winds to a close today.
The program's final installment, "Regret to
Inform" by Barbara Sonneborn, will by shown
at 4 p.m. in Building 100, Room 11 l-O.
Asst. GASA Prof. Matthew Kohrman ex
plained that the series was sponsored by his
department and organized by the CASA un
dergraduate committee, which he chairs.
"We had a film series last year on religious
fundamentalism," he said. "It was designed to
help people think in a critical manner about
that topic in light of September 11."
Kohrman said that this year, given the
probability of war with Iraq, the department
put together the series of documentary films
and brought both experts and filmmakers to
lead subsequent discussions.
"We wanted to highlight for students the
social, political and moral consequences of war
in ways that weren't overly abstract,"
Kohrman said. "Film is an incredibly palpable
medium."
Narquis Barak, a CASA visiting lecturer
from Harvard, chose the films and booked the
panelists.
"The idea was to bring together anthropol
ogists and documentarians to provide a plat
form for discussion on issues in America with
the impending war and various ways war is
documented," she said. "I wanted to give stu
dents a sense of historical context. What can
we learn from other wars?"
Each of the three films was scheduled to be
followed by a discussion led by an anthropolo
gy scholar and three filmmakers.
"The discussions have been marvelous, in
part because anthropologists usually work

with texts and filmographers in visual formats,
so technically we're coming from very differ
ent directions," Kohrman said.
According to Barak, the discussion after the
first film, "Videograms of a Revolution" by
Harun Farocki, focused on the takeover of the
state television station during the Romanian
revolution, which allowed dissenting views to
reach Romanians.
"[We] also talked about the Gulf War when
the military was in control [of the media], in
contrast to Vietnam when the military had lit
tle control," she said.
The second session, held last Thursday, fo
cused on war suffering and ethnic coexistence
and featured Sirnone Bitton's film, "The
Bombing."
"Parents on both sides lose children during
war — the imagery was so potent," Barak said.
"The Gulf War coverage [in contrast] was re
ally sterile. To what extent do we become dis
tanced from the actual repercussions of war
from that kind of coverage?"
Kohrman was the discussion leader for the
second session.
"We hoped that students would be open to
letting themselves think about the intimate
consequences of military conflict and that's
something we don't get that much of in media
representations," he said.
"And in all likelihood, we won't be getting
that in media representation if the United
States goes to war," Kohrman continued.
What we're likely to get are snippets, highly
sensational, from a fairly limited array of
genre [and] quite constrained by commer
cial imperatives."
According to a CASA flier, today's film, "Re
gret to Inform," is about memory and recon
ciliation. Barak said that she will direct the fol
lowing discussion toward the question of "to
what extent memory is constructed different
ly here and in Vietnam?"
Student reaction has been very positive
thus far.

"The panelists were noteworthy and obvi
ously had a great deal of an academic back
ground in the topics covered," said senior
Charu Gupta.
"The event is very relevant to issues in
America because it addresses issues of repre
sentation in the media and the way the
media molds news and creates history,"
Gupta said.
"With questions regarding the current situ
ation in Iraq, it is important for students and
faculty to consider the reliability of the media
that they encounter and to question the origin
of their own beliefs."
Senior and sociology coterminal student
Diana Reddy agreed.
"The panelists provided cool film theory in
sight and I thought it was really helpful to be
able to reflect on the movie with professors."
However, despite the enthusiasm of both
students and faculty, the turnout for the film
series has been very low.
"We had less of a turnout than we had
hoped," Kohrman said. "It's a little confound
ing and disturbing that there wasn't more in
terest. I think students missed out on some
thing quite special."
Barak commented, "Maybe [students] are
too caught up in their own lives."
She also suggested that perhaps students
were too inundated with war imagery that
they "don't want to deal with it again as an ex
tracurricular."
Both Kohrman and Barak suggested that
those students truly interested in politics were
involved at an activist level and were not inter
ested in mere discussions.
"I believe that turnout was low because of
the timing and because undergraduate stu
dents are not as familiar with the CASA de
partment," Gupta said.
Reddy had another thought.
"The turnout was low because most Stan
ford students are apathetic corporate
whores."

"We had a film series last year on religious
fundamentalism," he said. "It was designed to
help people think in a critical manner about
that topic in light of September 11."
Kohrman said that this year, given the
probability of war with Iraq, the department
put together the series of documentary films
and brought both experts and filmmakers to
lead subsequent discussions.
"We wanted to highlight for students the
social, political and moral consequences of war
in ways that weren't overly abstract,"
Kohrman said. "Film is an incredibly palpable
medium."
Narquis Barak, a CASA visiting lecturer
from Harvard, chose the films and booked the
panelists.
"The idea was to bring together anthropol
ogists and documentarians to provide a plat
form for discussion on issues in America with
the impending war and various ways war is
documented," she said. "I wanted to give stu
dents a sense of historical context. What can
we learn from other wars?"
Each of the three films was scheduled to be
followed by a discussion led by an anthropolo
gy scholar and three filmmakers.
"The discussions have been marvelous, in
part because anthropologists usually work

with texts and filmographers in visual formats,
so technically we're coming from very differ
ent directions," Kohrman said.
According to Barak, the discussion after the
first film, "Videograms of a Revolution" by
Harun Farocki, focused on the takeover of the
state television station during the Romanian
revolution, which allowed dissenting views to
reach Romanians.
"[We] also talked about the Gulf War when
the military was in control [of the media], in
contrast to Vietnam when the military had lit
tle control," she said.
The second session, held last Thursday, fo
cused on war suffering and ethnic coexistence
and featured Sirnone Bitton's film, "The
Bombing."
"Parents on both sides lose children during
war — the imagery was so potent," Barak said.
"The Gulf War coverage [in contrast] was re
ally sterile. To what extent do we become dis
tanced from the actual repercussions of war
from that kind of coverage?"
Kohrman was the discussion leader for the
second session.
"We hoped that students would be open to
letting themselves think about the intimate
consequences of military conflict and that's
something we don't get that much of in media
representations," he said.
"And in all likelihood, we won't be getting
that in media representation if the United
States goes to war," Kohrman continued.
What we're likely to get are snippets, highly
sensational, from a fairly limited array of
genre [and] quite constrained by commer
cial imperatives."
According to a CASA flier, today's film, "Re
gret to Inform," is about memory and recon
ciliation. Barak said that she will direct the fol
lowing discussion toward the question of "to
what extent memory is constructed different
ly here and in Vietnam?"
Student reaction has been very positive
thus far.

"The panelists were noteworthy and obvi
ously had a great deal of an academic back
ground in the topics covered," said senior
Charu Gupta.
"The event is very relevant to issues in
America because it addresses issues of repre
sentation in the media and the way the
media molds news and creates history,"
Gupta said.
"With questions regarding the current situ
ation in Iraq, it is important for students and
faculty to consider the reliability of the media
that they encounter and to question the origin
of their own beliefs."
Senior and sociology coterminal student
Diana Reddy agreed.
"The panelists provided cool film theory in
sight and I thought it was really helpful to be
able to reflect on the movie with professors."
However, despite the enthusiasm of both
students and faculty, the turnout for the film
series has been very low.
"We had less of a turnout than we had
hoped," Kohrman said. "It's a little confound
ing and disturbing that there wasn't more in
terest. I think students missed out on some
thing quite special."
Barak commented, "Maybe [students] are
too caught up in their own lives."
She also suggested that perhaps students
were too inundated with war imagery that
they "don't want to deal with it again as an ex
tracurricular."
Both Kohrman and Barak suggested that
those students truly interested in politics were
involved at an activist level and were not inter
ested in mere discussions.
"I believe that turnout was low because of
the timing and because undergraduate stu
dents are not as familiar with the CASA de
partment," Gupta said.
Reddy had another thought.
"The turnout was low because most Stan
ford students are apathetic corporate
whores."
