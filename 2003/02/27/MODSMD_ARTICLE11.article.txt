# SSE to help student found new business
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Student Enterprises is
offering one Stanford student with
an entrepreneurial spirit the op
portunity to found a business in
the 2003-2004 academic year. Still
in the process of being designed,
the business will pair students with
local families to offer services such
as tutoring, bartending and mov
ing.
Employees of the student en
terprises are working now to come
up with the general framework for
the business.
"We have done preliminary
plan development and researched
the market," said Business Devel
opment Manager Joseph Shapiro,
a senior. "We need an entrepre
neur to turn the idea into reality."
SSE CEO David Endelman,
Class of 2002, added that trans
forming an idea into reality is not
always an easy task.
"This requires persistence,
salesmanship and an ability to
adapt to the changing needs of the
business as it grows," he said.
While this particular manageri
al position is new, the project fol
lows the spirit of the student enter
prises, which is the business
branch of the ASSU.
"All the businesses we offer now
were start-ups at one time," said
Development Director Grace Ko,
a junior. "Bazaar, Flicks To Go
and the Stanford Store are just a
few examples."
Shapiro agreed.
"SSE's current businesses all
began from a driven student with
a great idea," he said. "Seventy
five years ago, ASSU started on
campus movie showing; now,
that's FLiCKS."
Ko said that next year would be
a "test run"and that the plans are
still subject to change.
"Tutoring will be the first ser
vice offered to community mem
bers and we hope moving and bar

tending will follow," she said.
"We're still developing the idea
and there are a lot of directions we
can go with this."
Freshman Solina Tith has been
a key contributor to the project.
Applicants for this managerial
position must submit a cover let
ter, resume and several short es
says to the student enterprises by
March 7.
Endelman emphasized that ap
plicants from all backgrounds are
welcome.
"SSE gladly hires from all acad
emic majors and highly values a
candidate's creativity, innovative
ideas and business intuition," he
said.
Shapiro added that the position
is not restricted to those who have
past experience.
"All students [who will be at
tending Stanford next year] are
encouraged to apply," he said.
"Competitive applicants will
demonstrate motivation, dedica
tion to the business and excite
ment for entrepreneurship."
Ko noted that the selected can
didate should have strong leader
ship skills.
"The entrepreneur should be
organized, enthusiastic and pas
sionate about providing service to
the Stanford community," she
said.
Shapiro estimated the position
would require working 10 to 15
hours per week.
"The person should be willing
to put a large amount of time into
the project," Ko said. "The posi
tion is equivalent to being CEO of
a small company."
Shapiro said the student enter
prises would offer the entrepre
neur a "competitive stipend."
"Compensation is based both
on a quarterly salary and on a
bonus package that might include
profit-sharing," Endelman said.
Shapiro added, "We're all excit
ed about it. There's been a really
positive response so far."
