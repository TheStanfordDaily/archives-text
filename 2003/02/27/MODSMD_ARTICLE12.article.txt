## Design selected for World Trade Center site 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —A cluster of
sloping, angular buildings with a
1,776-foot spire that would be the
tallest in the world was chosen yester
day as the blueprint to redevelop the
World Trade Center site, The Associat
ed Press has learned.
Architect Daniel Libeskind's design
beat a plan by an international design
team known as THINK, which envi
sioned two 1,665-foot latticework tow
ers straddling the footprints of the orig
inal towers, said a source familiar with
the selection. An official announcement

is expected tomorrow.
The choice of the soaring design,
which pays homage to the year Ameri
ca declared its independence, was
made by a committee of representatives
from the Lower Manhattan Develop
ment Corp., the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey and the offices of
the governor and mayor.
Both Gov. George Pataki and Mayor
Michael Bloomberg favored the Libe
skind plan, an important factor in the
decision, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

LMDC Chairman John Whitehead
telephoned Libeskind with the news,
the source said, telling the architect his
"vision has brought hope and inspira
tion to a city still recovering from a ter
rible tragedy."
Libeskind, who is based in Berlin,
declined comment. The source said he
told the LMDC chairman that being se
lected is "a life-changing experience."
Deciding what to do with the 16-acre
site in Lower Manhattan has been
wrenching at times. Relatives of the
nearly 2,800 people who died at ground

zero called for memorials with a sense of
respect and grace, while business offi
cials and others said the city cannot af
ford to lose too much office space.
The Libeskind design called for 70
stories of offices, with airy "gardens of
the world" beckoning tourists above of
fice level. It included five starkly geo
metrical towers and several smaller cul
tural buildings.
The plan, which may be revised, also
called fora Park of Heroes, and a
memorial encompassing the footprints
of the fallen towers.
