# D.C. swamped by calls

WASHINGTON (AP) —Anti-
war protesters traded marching
shoes for phones, fax machines
and computers yesterday as part
of a "virtual march" on the na
tion's capital.
Senators, regardless of their
position on a war with Iraq, were
barraged with calls, as was the
White House. Outside calls to De
mocratic and Republican Senate
offices could not be completed be
cause of busy circuits.
"We will let our fingers do the
marching and demand that our
voices be heard," said Tom An
drews, the national director for
Win Without War, the group that
organized the protest.
Andrews said about 400,000
people had registered through the
group's Web site for the call-in
campaign.
"Well over 1 million phone calls
were made in just eight hours by
people from every state in the
country" yesterday, he said.

"Every senator's office and the
White House switchboard re
ceived at least two and often more
calls per minute."
White House spokeswoman
Ashley Snee said the switchboard
received "a lot of calls" yesterday,
though she didn't have figures.
Asked how the White House
viewed the calls, she said: "It's a
useful tool for people to express
their views, but it's not objective or
scientific or a way to measure pub
lic sentiments."
The office of Sen. Dick Durbin,
D-111., received more than 800
calls in a nearly four-hour span
yesterday morning, about twice
the number of calls it usually re
ceives. Durbin has opposed unilat
eral action in Iraq.
Durbin's spokesman Joe
Shoemaker also said his office
had received 18,000 e-mails
since Tuesday afternoon, more
than five times the number it
typically gets.
