# Anti-piracy technology found;
## Officials close down Web site 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The government has
seized a Web site that helped people bypass anti
piracy technology to play illegal copies of popular
video games.
The site, iSONEWS.com, was seized as part of a
plea agreement by David M. Rocci, 22, of Blacks
burg, Va. In December 2002, Rocci pleaded guilty in
U.S. District Court to conspiring to import, market
and sell devices known as modification chips.
The chips are designed to get around copyright
protections built into game consoles such as the Mi
crosoft Xbox and Sony Play Station 2. Once installed,
the chips allow the user to play pirated games on the
consoles.
The government assumed control of Rocci's do
main name and Web site this week and posted in
formation on the site about Rocci's case as well as in
formation about illegal copyright activity.
The Web site had been used to market mod chips
and offered listings of available pirated games. It had
over 100,000 registered users and claimed to receive
over 140,000 hits each day.
Some Internet groups were concerned about the
free speech implications of the government seizing
Web sites and domain names.
"It's a far-reaching and radical approach in light
of previous Supreme Court decisions that empha
sized the importance of the First Amendment on the
Internet," said David Sobel, general counsel for the
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washing
ton. "Unfortunately it appears to be a new law en
forcement tactic."
"It adds insult to injury for the government to re
place the existing content on a Web site with new
government-approved content," he said. "This
could be equivalent to the death penalty in the con
text of free speech on the Internet."
Marc Zwillinger, an anti-piracy attorney, said pri
vate companies have seized control of public Web
sites in civil cases.
