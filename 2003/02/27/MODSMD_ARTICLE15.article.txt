## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Pomp and speaker-stance 
### 
In a few days, the Commencement speak
er for this year's ceremony could be an
nounced. Last September, the senior
class presidents asked members of the
graduating class to nominate candidates to de
liver the speech.
About 450 nominations were submitted and
the list of the top 20 nominees was given to
University President John Hennessy. It is like
ly that Hennessy has already selected the
speaker and that his or her name will be re
vealed soon.
In the past, some seniors have not reacted
positively to the speaker announcement. In
2001, graduating seniors voiced disapproval
over the selection of Carly Fiorina, the CEO of
Hewlett-Packard. Criticism focused on the fact
that she was not a public figure and not in
volved with international affairs or human
rights.
Last year, the selection of National Security
Adviser Condoleezza Rice — a former Univer
sity provost — sparked even more cries of
protest. Students said that Rice, as a Republi
can, had endorsed and helped enact policies
that went against a majority of Stanford stu
dents' beliefs.
We hope that Hennessy and the senior
class presidents have kept these criticisms in
mind in reaching their decision. But, more
importantly, we hope that students remember
that the decision to select one Commence
ment speaker — out of the 450 nominees —

must be an agonizing one. There is no single
person who could possibly make the entire
student body happy.
That said, many of the 20 nominees would
make an excellent choice for this year's Com
mencement speaker. They are: Maya An
gelou, Bono, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter,
Gerhard Casper, Bill Clinton, Bill Cosby, Gray
Davis, John Elway, Rudy Giuliani, the Dalai
Lama, Nelson Mandela, Conan O'Brien, San
dra Day O'Connor, Colin Powell, William
Rehnquist, Sally Ride, Alejandro Toledo, Cor
nell West and Tiger Woods.
Almost every nominee on the list has the
key qualities that make fora successful Com
mencement speaker — intelligence, a sense of
humor, good public speaking skills, notable
life experiences and the potential to give the
Class of 2003 necessary advice for the future.
And students should be pleased with this list as
well, as it is one they helped form.
For many seniors, Commencement can
be an emotional and scary event. Unlike
high school graduation, where most grad
uates knew that Stanford was waiting in
the fall, this ceremony marks less certain
ty. An ideal graduation speaker will reas
sure students about what lies ahead, as
well as motivate them to accept new chal
lenges.
VVe eagerly anticipate the announcement
of this years' speaker and hope the decision is
better received than in past years.
