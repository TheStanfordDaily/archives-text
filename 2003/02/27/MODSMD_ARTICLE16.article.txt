# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Irrationalize this 
### 
It's been almost a year since
I've visited my birthplace,
the Middle East. Since I re
turned, over 419 Israelis and
1,032 Palestinians have lost their
lives, and tension as thick as blood
continues to permeate a region the
size of Los Angeles county. I'd like
to share my thoughts from that
week-long trip and how it changed
my perspective on the Middle East
conflict. A different time, a differ
ent place, but it's surprising how
much hasn't changed.
Some might say it's a little irra
tional to voluntarily miss a week of
classes just days before finals; some
might point out that missing class
es to spend a week in Israel is even
slightly more irrational. But as I
flew home from a political confer
ence for college leaders held in Is
rael, I struggled to find signs of
hope in what has become the
world's never-ending conflict.
The trip was organized as a se
ries of meetings with the political
big-guns of a wounded nation. Our
schedule included briefings by the
U.S. ambassador to Israel, Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations,
the mayor of Jerusalem, editors of
newspapers, CNN spokespersons,
one of Ariel Sharon's policy advi
sors and Israel's deputy foreign
minister. These meetings shared a
common thread: the people
sought to convey a sense of a ratio
nal solution to the crises.
But Israel — a country in which
an hour's car ride can take you
from Starbucks and Mercedes
dealerships to sand dunes and
Bedouin tribe lands — needs any
thing but a rational solution.
It took me four days of meet
ings to realize that it is the "irra
tional essence" of the Middle
East — that which is not contained
within rational political rhetoric

that we so often hear — wherein
the hope for peace resides. I was
lucky enough to have found two
pieces of so-called "irrational" wis
dom that resonate hope in the
heart of a collapsing Middle East.
I discovered the first piece of ir
rational hope as I visited survivors
of terrorist attacks at a Jerusalem
hospital. After having an intense
discussion with suicide bombing

victims — one ol
whom lost several
friends in an at
tack a month ear
lier, not to men
tion an arm and a
piece of his crani
um — I learned
the fate of the sui
cide bombers who

actually live through their deadly
missions. I was shocked to learn
that these terrorists receive the
same medical treatment as the Is
raelis they attempt to kill, right
down to the ambulances, doctors
and wards — sometimes even
sleeping in the same overcrowded
rooms as their victims.
There simply is no rational ex
planation why the very doctors
whose lives are at risk with each
visit to Sbarro pizzeria are paid by
Israel to save the lives of terrorist
bombers. But such is life in Israel,
and in the end it is irrationality
that leads to such beautiful irony.
For me, the fact that a state choos
es to care for both those who are
victimized and those who victimize
provides a glimpse of hope.
Perhaps if we are irrational to
save the life of a terrorist, we ought
to be irrational enough to one day
put our guns down, ease our road
blocks and forget our religious
convictions long enough to start
over again — but this time for real.
The second piece of hope I

found in Israel that week came at a
most irrational time from a most
unsuspected source. On the last
night of our trip, several of us de
cided to climb to the roof to view
the sunset. The burdened city of
Jerusalem to our north — now
just a sea of faint street lights —
was surrounded by Palestinian
controlled Bethlehem and Beit
Jala and the Israeli-controlled
neighborhood of Gilo. From the
darkness we heard the faint cry of
the Muslim call to prayer emanat
ing from the tops of mosque
minarets just a few hundred me
ters away, interspersed with the
sound of machine gun lire.
With all the idealism and inno
cence a college student could
muster, someone glanced out into
the night and asked: "What if we
just climbed that hill (between
Jerusalem and Bethlehem) and lit
a bonfire? We'll all stand there and
I bet you we could get 10 Palestini
ans to stand there next to us. It'll
get picked up by CNN and we'll
start a movement."
The irrationality of the sugges
tion made me laugh softly under
my breath, but his intentions
turned my thoughts suddenly in
ward. How many out there — on
both sides of the green line — feel
the same way? How many are ready
to stop conveying opinion through
bloodshed and turn to diplomacy?
And fora moment, I was sure
there was a way to work around
our religion and our leaders and
to connect as people with no com
mon ground except for the shared
opinion that peace must be real
ized. I cling to this irrationality in a
world where Israeli civilians die
while drinking lattes, and Pales
tinian citizens continue to be born

more valuable than life.
1 am irrational with respect to
myself as well, for I write about for
giveness after a Hamas terrorist
claimed the life of a member of my
family in Jerusalem just months

before I arrived in Israel. In a re
gion where a clay without death is
an anomaly, I look not to the polit
ical rhetoric but to the silence in
between — the irrational impulse
to forgive amidst warfare — as the
rational solution to the conflict
that won't seem to disappear.

For me, the fact that a state choos
es to care for both those who are
victimized and those who victimize
provides a glimpse of hope.
Perhaps if we are irrational to
save the life of a terrorist, we ought
to be irrational enough to one day
put our guns down, ease our road
blocks and forget our religious
convictions long enough to start
over again — but this time for real.
The second piece of hope I

found in Israel that week came at a
most irrational time from a most
unsuspected source. On the last
night of our trip, several of us de
cided to climb to the roof to view
the sunset. The burdened city of
Jerusalem to our north — now
just a sea of faint street lights —
was surrounded by Palestinian
controlled Bethlehem and Beit
Jala and the Israeli-controlled
neighborhood of Gilo. From the
darkness we heard the faint cry of
the Muslim call to prayer emanat
ing from the tops of mosque
minarets just a few hundred me
ters away, interspersed with the
sound of machine gun lire.
With all the idealism and inno
cence a college student could
muster, someone glanced out into
the night and asked: "What if we
just climbed that hill (between
Jerusalem and Bethlehem) and lit
a bonfire? We'll all stand there and
I bet you we could get 10 Palestini
ans to stand there next to us. It'll
get picked up by CNN and we'll
start a movement."
The irrationality of the sugges
tion made me laugh softly under
my breath, but his intentions
turned my thoughts suddenly in
ward. How many out there — on
both sides of the green line — feel
the same way? How many are ready
to stop conveying opinion through
bloodshed and turn to diplomacy?
And fora moment, I was sure
there was a way to work around
our religion and our leaders and
to connect as people with no com
mon ground except for the shared
opinion that peace must be real
ized. I cling to this irrationality in a
world where Israeli civilians die
while drinking lattes, and Pales
tinian citizens continue to be born

It's been almost a year since
I've visited my birthplace,
the Middle East. Since I re
turned, over 419 Israelis and
1,032 Palestinians have lost their
lives, and tension as thick as blood
continues to permeate a region the
size of Los Angeles county. I'd like
to share my thoughts from that
week-long trip and how it changed
my perspective on the Middle East
conflict. A different time, a differ
ent place, but it's surprising how
much hasn't changed.
Some might say it's a little irra
tional to voluntarily miss a week of
classes just days before finals; some
might point out that missing class
es to spend a week in Israel is even
slightly more irrational. But as I
flew home from a political confer
ence for college leaders held in Is
rael, I struggled to find signs of
hope in what has become the
world's never-ending conflict.
The trip was organized as a se
ries of meetings with the political
big-guns of a wounded nation. Our
schedule included briefings by the
U.S. ambassador to Israel, Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations,
the mayor of Jerusalem, editors of
newspapers, CNN spokespersons,
one of Ariel Sharon's policy advi
sors and Israel's deputy foreign
minister. These meetings shared a
common thread: the people
sought to convey a sense of a ratio
nal solution to the crises.
But Israel — a country in which
an hour's car ride can take you
from Starbucks and Mercedes
dealerships to sand dunes and
Bedouin tribe lands — needs any
thing but a rational solution.
It took me four days of meet
ings to realize that it is the "irra
tional essence" of the Middle
East — that which is not contained
within rational political rhetoric

that we so often hear — wherein
the hope for peace resides. I was
lucky enough to have found two
pieces of so-called "irrational" wis
dom that resonate hope in the
heart of a collapsing Middle East.
I discovered the first piece of ir
rational hope as I visited survivors
of terrorist attacks at a Jerusalem
hospital. After having an intense
discussion with suicide bombing

victims — one ol
whom lost several
friends in an at
tack a month ear
lier, not to men
tion an arm and a
piece of his crani
um — I learned
the fate of the sui
cide bombers who

actually live through their deadly
missions. I was shocked to learn
that these terrorists receive the
same medical treatment as the Is
raelis they attempt to kill, right
down to the ambulances, doctors
and wards — sometimes even
sleeping in the same overcrowded
rooms as their victims.
There simply is no rational ex
planation why the very doctors
whose lives are at risk with each
visit to Sbarro pizzeria are paid by
Israel to save the lives of terrorist
bombers. But such is life in Israel,
and in the end it is irrationality
that leads to such beautiful irony.
For me, the fact that a state choos
es to care for both those who are
victimized and those who victimize
provides a glimpse of hope.
Perhaps if we are irrational to
save the life of a terrorist, we ought
to be irrational enough to one day
put our guns down, ease our road
blocks and forget our religious
convictions long enough to start
over again — but this time for real.
