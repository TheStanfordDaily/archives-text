Despite Buenos Aires, Puebla closure,
OSP introduces three new programs
I completely agree with The Daily's edi
torial, "Properly evaluating OSPs" (Feb.
13), which pointed out that Overseas Stud
ies should maintain a variety of programs
abroad, including total immersion options.
In fact, the variety of Overseas Studies of
ferings has increased significantly over the
past two years, including the introduction
of three new kinds of programs.
First, we introduced Overseas Semi
nars last year (patterned after Sophomore
College). The five, three-week-long semi
nars held last September provided 75 out
of 400 student applicants with a unique
opportunity to immerse themselves in fas
cinating topics and locales that are simply
not available on campus or via other uni
versity programs. We are offering 10 sem
inars this coming September. These semi
nars again ofler topical content and in
clude "Healing and Religion in India,"
"Community Reconstruction and Devel
opment in Post-Apartheid South Africa,"
and "Alpine Archeology in the Alps,"
among others. Overseas Studies received
500 applications for the 130 slots available.

Second, we have introduced a 'common
theme' activity, exemplified by Overseas
Studies' World War II courses and work
shop, which were held last March in Berlin
and will be repeated this March. Eighty
five students participated last year, and we
expect similar attendance this year.
Third, we have just introduced our first
topical program in Australian Coastal
Studies. The program will focus on ma
rine biology and ecology of the Great Bar
rier Reef and the coastal rainforest and
Australia's culture and history. This pro
gram will take place this coming fall quar
ter. Sixty-five students applied for the 48
slots available. Although this program
does not involve immersion in a different
language, students will interact with Aus
tralian students while spending most of
the quarter in three field research stations.
Our decision to develop these new pro
grams was based on two key considera
tions: truly compelling content and strong
student interest. It is easy to imagine nu
merous compelling content programs, but
if student interest is low there is obviously
no point in implementing them.
This combination of compelling con
tent and strong student interest must and
will remain our criteria for establishing
new programs (and also for re-evaluating
existing ones). Why should numbers of

students be so important? The reasons
are costs and manpower. Although it
would be wonderful to have a large num
ber of diverse programs and program
types to meet every student desire, be
cause our financial resources and Over
seas Studies' ability to organize, imple
ment and manage programs are limited,
we must be quite selective. Given our re
sources, we can probably handle at most
a dozen programs and a dozen overseas
seminars every year, with a combined ca
pacity to accommodate up to 850 stu
dents per year.
It is for that reason that we were com
pelled to close the Buenos Aires and
I'uebla programs. The number of stu
dents attending these programs has de
clined over the years to only four and six,
respectively, for this academic year. Clos
ing these barely attended programs will
enable us to replace them with alternatives
that are at least as compelling (hopefully
even more compelling) and that generate
greater student participation. It simply
makes no sense to have programs — total
immersion or any other type — if students
choose not to participate.

University funds should be directed
to academics, residential life — not
campus maintenance
The Daily's editorial, "Campus de
serves care" (Feb. 26), which advocated
the allocation of University funds to im
prove the ornamental urns on the
balustrade facing Serra Mall and the
concrete benches along the perimeter of
the Claw seems, at best, an unnecessary
use of such a editorial space and, at
worst, a message antithetical to the con
cerns of many Stanford students. It
seems peculiar that a publication that,
earlier this year, published an article
with the headline "University faces
deficit" would ask that part of Stanford's
already-tight budget go to improving
features of our campus that contribute
nothing to the University's academic or
residential mission.
While a well-maintained and aestheti
cally pleasing campus may be a nice luxu
ry and may indeed, "reinforce in the
minds of visitors the excellence they ex
pect of Stanford," this is a misguided goal
in times of budget deficit. When spend
ing in certain areas must be cut, our focus
should necessarily be on those aspects of
the University which create the excel
lence to which the editorial refers — aca

demies and, since we are a primarily resi
dential campus, residences. Most of the
"needless painting" to which the editorial
alludes is done on academic and residen
tial buildings, which constitute the frame
work of our residential campus and
shouldn't be neglected for aesthetically
pleasing public areas.
In short, it would be nice to have all the
areas of our campus perfectly maintained
for both the Stanford community and vis
itors, but in a time of budgetary constraint
we must focus on the "bread and butter" of
a residential university — the academic
and residential infrastructure as well as the
programs they house.

Nutrition classes offered spring quarter
I would like to thank The Daily for
the article, "Time concerns and eating
disorders lead to nutrition nightmares"
(Feb. 25). Although complaints of poor
student nutrition are common and eat
ing disorders receive much attention,
I've found that basic education about
nutrition is hard to find at Stanford. No
wonder students don't eat well,
considering the standard igno
rance surrounding such terms
as "blood sugar" and "partially
hydrogenated" and such con
cepts as "good vs. bad fats" and
"the debatable importance of
proteins."

In response to the lack of op
portunities to learn about general
nutrition at Stanford, senior
Emily Howell and I will offer a 1-
unit nutrition class through the
Athletics/Recreation Department
this spring quarter. Both students
and community members are
welcome.

and "Alpine Archeology in the Alps,"
among others. Overseas Studies received
500 applications for the 130 slots available.

Second, we have introduced a 'common
theme' activity, exemplified by Overseas
Studies' World War II courses and work
shop, which were held last March in Berlin
and will be repeated this March. Eighty
five students participated last year, and we
expect similar attendance this year.
Third, we have just introduced our first
topical program in Australian Coastal
Studies. The program will focus on ma
rine biology and ecology of the Great Bar
rier Reef and the coastal rainforest and
Australia's culture and history. This pro
gram will take place this coming fall quar
ter. Sixty-five students applied for the 48
slots available. Although this program
does not involve immersion in a different
language, students will interact with Aus
tralian students while spending most of
the quarter in three field research stations.
Our decision to develop these new pro
grams was based on two key considera
tions: truly compelling content and strong
student interest. It is easy to imagine nu
merous compelling content programs, but
if student interest is low there is obviously
no point in implementing them.
This combination of compelling con
tent and strong student interest must and
will remain our criteria for establishing
new programs (and also for re-evaluating
existing ones). Why should numbers of

students be so important? The reasons
are costs and manpower. Although it
would be wonderful to have a large num
ber of diverse programs and program
types to meet every student desire, be
cause our financial resources and Over
seas Studies' ability to organize, imple
ment and manage programs are limited,
we must be quite selective. Given our re
sources, we can probably handle at most
a dozen programs and a dozen overseas
seminars every year, with a combined ca
pacity to accommodate up to 850 stu
dents per year.
It is for that reason that we were com
pelled to close the Buenos Aires and
I'uebla programs. The number of stu
dents attending these programs has de
clined over the years to only four and six,
respectively, for this academic year. Clos
ing these barely attended programs will
enable us to replace them with alternatives
that are at least as compelling (hopefully
even more compelling) and that generate
greater student participation. It simply
makes no sense to have programs — total
immersion or any other type — if students
choose not to participate.

University funds should be directed
to academics, residential life — not
campus maintenance
The Daily's editorial, "Campus de
serves care" (Feb. 26), which advocated
the allocation of University funds to im
prove the ornamental urns on the
balustrade facing Serra Mall and the
concrete benches along the perimeter of
the Claw seems, at best, an unnecessary
use of such a editorial space and, at
worst, a message antithetical to the con
cerns of many Stanford students. It
seems peculiar that a publication that,
earlier this year, published an article
with the headline "University faces
deficit" would ask that part of Stanford's
already-tight budget go to improving
features of our campus that contribute
nothing to the University's academic or
residential mission.
While a well-maintained and aestheti
cally pleasing campus may be a nice luxu
ry and may indeed, "reinforce in the
minds of visitors the excellence they ex
pect of Stanford," this is a misguided goal
in times of budget deficit. When spend
ing in certain areas must be cut, our focus
should necessarily be on those aspects of
the University which create the excel
lence to which the editorial refers — aca

demies and, since we are a primarily resi
dential campus, residences. Most of the
"needless painting" to which the editorial
alludes is done on academic and residen
tial buildings, which constitute the frame
work of our residential campus and
shouldn't be neglected for aesthetically
pleasing public areas.
In short, it would be nice to have all the
areas of our campus perfectly maintained
for both the Stanford community and vis
itors, but in a time of budgetary constraint
we must focus on the "bread and butter" of
a residential university — the academic
and residential infrastructure as well as the
programs they house.

Nutrition classes offered spring quarter
I would like to thank The Daily for
the article, "Time concerns and eating
disorders lead to nutrition nightmares"
(Feb. 25). Although complaints of poor
student nutrition are common and eat
ing disorders receive much attention,
I've found that basic education about
nutrition is hard to find at Stanford. No
wonder students don't eat well,
considering the standard igno
rance surrounding such terms
as "blood sugar" and "partially
hydrogenated" and such con
cepts as "good vs. bad fats" and
"the debatable importance of
proteins."

In response to the lack of op
portunities to learn about general
nutrition at Stanford, senior
Emily Howell and I will offer a 1-
unit nutrition class through the
Athletics/Recreation Department
this spring quarter. Both students
and community members are
welcome.

Despite Buenos Aires, Puebla closure,
OSP introduces three new programs
I completely agree with The Daily's edi
torial, "Properly evaluating OSPs" (Feb.
13), which pointed out that Overseas Stud
ies should maintain a variety of programs
abroad, including total immersion options.
In fact, the variety of Overseas Studies of
ferings has increased significantly over the
past two years, including the introduction
of three new kinds of programs.
First, we introduced Overseas Semi
nars last year (patterned after Sophomore
College). The five, three-week-long semi
nars held last September provided 75 out
of 400 student applicants with a unique
opportunity to immerse themselves in fas
cinating topics and locales that are simply
not available on campus or via other uni
versity programs. We are offering 10 sem
inars this coming September. These semi
nars again ofler topical content and in
clude "Healing and Religion in India,"
"Community Reconstruction and Devel
opment in Post-Apartheid South Africa,"
and "Alpine Archeology in the Alps,"
among others. Overseas Studies received
500 applications for the 130 slots available.

Second, we have introduced a 'common
theme' activity, exemplified by Overseas
Studies' World War II courses and work
shop, which were held last March in Berlin
and will be repeated this March. Eighty
