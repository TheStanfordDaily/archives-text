# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Supporting queer marriage legalization 
### JESSE EVANS VIRGINIA SOLOMON GUEST COLUMNISTS 
The Queer-Straight Social and Political
Alliance and another queer activist stu
dent group, Querillas, are co-sponsoring
an event today at noon in White Plaza to
support Freedom to Marry Day. Marriage
is a political institution; federal law offers
many benefits and incentives to married
couples that aren't extended to other rela
tionships. These include tax breaks, hous
ing services, hospital visitation rights, in
heritance rights, insurance coverage and
the ability to make decisions for sick or oth
erwise incapacitated partners, according
to the Freedom to Marry Collaborative.
The exclusion of non-marital relation
ships from these services prioritizes and le
gitimizes heterosexual relationships over
non-heterosexual relationships, nuclear
families over extended families and histor
ical patriarchy over equality.
YVe have significant critiques of mar
riage as an institution. We want no part of
normalizing and privileging any one spe
cific type of relationship, which is what the
extension of rights to married couples, but
not to other relationships, works to do.
Since many other types of relationships
exist in our society, it is our responsibility
to grant them the same possibility to foster
a healthy functioning family that we grant
to traditional families.
We aren't simply asking for benefits

that will enhance the lives of same-sex re
lationships. In addition to these types of
relationships, the government should not
discriminate against heterosexual rela
tionships that refuse to enter into the insti
tution of marriage for reasons of ideology
or practicality. We want the government
to enable a family to operate as a unit
whether it is run by a married man and
woman, two women, two men, an unmar
ried woman and man, a grandmother and
an aunt or any other combination of rela
tives, lovers or friends constituting the
household.
While marriage legitimizes a very spe
cific type of relationship, it also enforces a
binary that only allows for male or female
identification. There isn't space for alter
native identification in marriage. A trans
gendered person who has not had his oi
lier birth certificate changed, for example,
is forced to marry based on his or her state
assigned gender. In the same way that we
demand non-discrimination for these dif
ferent ways of identifying in housing, in
the workplace, or in school admissions, we
demand that the government not discrim
inate against these ways of identifying in
granting family status and the associated
benefits to relationships.
Freedom to Marry Day is about grant
ing all families access to the benefits that
will enable them to function, about taking
a stand against heteronoi mativity and tra
ditional gender roles and hierarchies and
making sure that we aren't ignoring mem

bers of our society and culturejust because
they might not fit into a model of marriage
that doesn't accurately reflect what may or
may not be the best way to structure fami
lies in the first place.
You may be wondering what Stan
ford's stake, and consequently its role, is
in this situation. After all, Stanford is an
institution of education and research, not
an organization dedicated to promoting
alternative social structures. The recent
decision by the ASSU and University
President John Hennessy to support
using affirmative action in college admis
sions shows Stanford's interest in issues
that directly affect its ability to function as
a university.
Queer marriage legalization is not
much different from affirmative action.
In the same way that Stanford is a better
institution with affirmative action, it
would be a better institution with queer
marriage legalization. Stanford has a
long history of being on the vanguard of
queer rights. In addition to its domestic
partners policy, the LGBT-CRC is one of
the few centers of its kind in the country
to have a full-time staff, and it also has one
of the largest operating budgets for cen
ters of its kind.
Stanford's domestic partners policy, as
published in the course bulletin, provides
services that have historically been avail
able only to married students to same-sex
partners. The University's policy has
served as a model for universities across

the country. Stanford invests time and
money into this policy to continue to at
tract the best students, staff and faculty
members, regardless of their family struc
ture. If queer marriage were legalized on
the state level, however, it would ease the
burden on Stanford to provide these ser
vices in absence of government support.
An extension of marriage benefits be
yond traditional male-female identified
relationships would also ensure that all
families have access to as many of the gov
ernment-funded financial securities and
benefits programs that opposite-sex cou
ples enjoy. Thus, the financial and person
al burdens that are often placed on fami
lies who deserve legal recognition but can
not obtain it would decrease.
If domestic partners policy benefits
weren't considered to be taxable income,
unlike marriage benefits, queer low-in
come students could more easily afford to
attend Stanford. .Also, a new faculty mem
ber trying to get a second-parent adoption
for their partner's child could choose their
post based on the quality of the university
and not the state and municipality's
record on same-sex second-parent adop
tions.
What can Stanford students do to
change the current marriage legalization?
We encourage everyone to attend today's
demonstration in White Plaza at 12 p.m.
The event, Stanford's first Freedom to
Marry Day, will include performances
from the Leland Stanford Junior March

ing Baud and will culminate in three dif
ferent mock marriage ceremonies be
tween two same-sex and one opposite-sex
couples, performed by the associate dean
of Religious Life.
We will also be passing out petitions to
request that the ASSU sign onto Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund's na
tional petition for queer marriage legaliza
tion. This is our chance to join other
schools like Harvard and the University of
Colorado in the light for equality. It is also
an opportunity to sign the petition as indi
viduals, to put added strength behind our
resolve. Our moral support is not nearly
enough to win this battle; we need to use
all of our resources.
We strongly urge people to come eat
our wedding cake and to have their voices
heard by the ASSU, the courts and our
elected officials. While you're there, we
also encourage you to pick up an "I Sup
port Queer Rights" or "I Support Queer
Marriage" sign for your door. And if
you're really having a good time, QSSFA is
holding a wedding reception to celebrate
the three marriages at 9 p.m. tonight in
Tresidder Cypress North.

and not the state and municipality's
record on same-sex second-parent adop
tions.
What can Stanford students do to
change the current marriage legalization?
We encourage everyone to attend today's
demonstration in White Plaza at 12 p.m.
The event, Stanford's first Freedom to
Marry Day, will include performances
from the Leland Stanford Junior March

ing Baud and will culminate in three dif
ferent mock marriage ceremonies be
tween two same-sex and one opposite-sex
couples, performed by the associate dean
of Religious Life.
We will also be passing out petitions to
request that the ASSU sign onto Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund's na
tional petition for queer marriage legaliza
tion. This is our chance to join other
schools like Harvard and the University of
Colorado in the light for equality. It is also
an opportunity to sign the petition as indi
viduals, to put added strength behind our
resolve. Our moral support is not nearly
enough to win this battle; we need to use
all of our resources.
We strongly urge people to come eat
our wedding cake and to have their voices
heard by the ASSU, the courts and our
elected officials. While you're there, we
also encourage you to pick up an "I Sup
port Queer Rights" or "I Support Queer
Marriage" sign for your door. And if
you're really having a good time, QSSFA is
holding a wedding reception to celebrate
the three marriages at 9 p.m. tonight in
Tresidder Cypress North.

Jesse Evans is senior majoring in feminist stud
ies. Virginia Solomon is a senior majoring in
feminist studies and studio art. Both are mem
bers of the Queer/Straight Social and Political
Alliance. Jesse can be reached at
jesse.exians@stanford.edu and Virginia can be
reached at vsolomon@stanford.edu.
The Queer-Straight Social and Political
Alliance and another queer activist stu
dent group, Querillas, are co-sponsoring
an event today at noon in White Plaza to
support Freedom to Marry Day. Marriage
is a political institution; federal law offers
many benefits and incentives to married
couples that aren't extended to other rela
tionships. These include tax breaks, hous
ing services, hospital visitation rights, in
heritance rights, insurance coverage and
the ability to make decisions for sick or oth
erwise incapacitated partners, according
to the Freedom to Marry Collaborative.
The exclusion of non-marital relation
ships from these services prioritizes and le
gitimizes heterosexual relationships over
non-heterosexual relationships, nuclear
families over extended families and histor
ical patriarchy over equality.
YVe have significant critiques of mar
riage as an institution. We want no part of
normalizing and privileging any one spe
cific type of relationship, which is what the
extension of rights to married couples, but
not to other relationships, works to do.
Since many other types of relationships
exist in our society, it is our responsibility
to grant them the same possibility to foster
a healthy functioning family that we grant
to traditional families.
We aren't simply asking for benefits

that will enhance the lives of same-sex re
lationships. In addition to these types of
relationships, the government should not
discriminate against heterosexual rela
tionships that refuse to enter into the insti
tution of marriage for reasons of ideology
or practicality. We want the government
to enable a family to operate as a unit
whether it is run by a married man and
woman, two women, two men, an unmar
ried woman and man, a grandmother and
an aunt or any other combination of rela
tives, lovers or friends constituting the
household.
While marriage legitimizes a very spe
cific type of relationship, it also enforces a
binary that only allows for male or female
identification. There isn't space for alter
native identification in marriage. A trans
gendered person who has not had his oi
lier birth certificate changed, for example,
is forced to marry based on his or her state
assigned gender. In the same way that we
demand non-discrimination for these dif
ferent ways of identifying in housing, in
the workplace, or in school admissions, we
demand that the government not discrim
inate against these ways of identifying in
granting family status and the associated
benefits to relationships.
Freedom to Marry Day is about grant
ing all families access to the benefits that
will enable them to function, about taking
a stand against heteronoi mativity and tra
ditional gender roles and hierarchies and
making sure that we aren't ignoring mem

bers of our society and culturejust because
they might not fit into a model of marriage
that doesn't accurately reflect what may or
may not be the best way to structure fami
lies in the first place.
You may be wondering what Stan
ford's stake, and consequently its role, is
in this situation. After all, Stanford is an
institution of education and research, not
an organization dedicated to promoting
alternative social structures. The recent
decision by the ASSU and University
President John Hennessy to support
using affirmative action in college admis
sions shows Stanford's interest in issues
that directly affect its ability to function as
a university.
Queer marriage legalization is not
much different from affirmative action.
In the same way that Stanford is a better
institution with affirmative action, it
would be a better institution with queer
marriage legalization. Stanford has a
long history of being on the vanguard of
queer rights. In addition to its domestic
partners policy, the LGBT-CRC is one of
the few centers of its kind in the country
to have a full-time staff, and it also has one
of the largest operating budgets for cen
ters of its kind.
Stanford's domestic partners policy, as
published in the course bulletin, provides
services that have historically been avail
able only to married students to same-sex
partners. The University's policy has
served as a model for universities across

the country. Stanford invests time and
money into this policy to continue to at
tract the best students, staff and faculty
members, regardless of their family struc
ture. If queer marriage were legalized on
the state level, however, it would ease the
burden on Stanford to provide these ser
vices in absence of government support.
An extension of marriage benefits be
yond traditional male-female identified
relationships would also ensure that all
families have access to as many of the gov
ernment-funded financial securities and
benefits programs that opposite-sex cou
ples enjoy. Thus, the financial and person
al burdens that are often placed on fami
lies who deserve legal recognition but can
not obtain it would decrease.
If domestic partners policy benefits
weren't considered to be taxable income,
unlike marriage benefits, queer low-in
come students could more easily afford to
attend Stanford. .Also, a new faculty mem
ber trying to get a second-parent adoption
for their partner's child could choose their
post based on the quality of the university
and not the state and municipality's
record on same-sex second-parent adop
tions.
