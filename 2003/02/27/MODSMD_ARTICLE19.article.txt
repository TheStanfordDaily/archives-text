## Women go fish for Pac-10 title 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swim
ming and diving team has won 14
Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships â€” and the Pac-10
Championship has only existed for
16 years.

Women's Swimming and Diving
at Pac-10 Championships, Federal
Way, Wa., Thursday to Saturday.

Noting this past domination in
conference, it's an understatement
to say that there is a lot of pressure
on the team to claim the top spot in
the challenging Pac-10.
Despite the pressure of the situ
ation, the word "exciting" was
most commonly chosen by the
Stanford athletes to describe their
feelings on this year's champi
onship.
"I think this team is confident, I
think that we have a lot of energy,
and I feel like we're ready to go."

said junior Tara Kirk.
The No. 8 Cardinal (8-2, 4-1
Pac-10) will need that enthusiasm,
as its squares off this weekend
against rivals in arguably the best
swimming and diving conference
in the NCAA.
"It's not going to be like in past
years, when Stanford has just
walked in and won. The champi
onship title will be out there for
many teams," Kirk said.
Aside from the pressure to win
as a team, this meet is the last
chance for swimmers to qualify for
nationals. For Kirk and others, in
cluding freshmen Dana Kirk and
Kristen Caverly, qualifying times
for nationals have already been at
tained.
Among those that swimming
coach Richard Quick expects to at
tain their qualifying times this
weekend are sophomores Lacey
Boutwell, Amy Wagner, Tami
Ransom, Evins Cameron and
Kirsten Gilbert, as well as fresh
men Laura Davis and Ashley Daly.

"But with competition like this,
the biggest thing to do is relax and
let your best performers come
out." Quick said. "I think it has to
be a meet where everyone in the
entire lineup swims very well for
three straight days."
The Cardinal divers also have
individual marks to hit, as the Pac
-10 Championships are their op
portunity to qualify for the NCAA
Zone meets, which are in turn the
qualifying meets for nationals.
"We're never been as prepared
for Pac-lOs as other teams are, be
cause we have so much pressure
and responsibility on us at Zones,"
diving coach Rick Schavone said.
Sophomore springboard diver
Ashlee Rosenthal noted that the
most crucial part of Pac-lOs is the
ability to see the competition all at
once.
"The competition that we see at
Zones will be at this meet, so it's a
good indication of what Zones will

Junior Tara Kirk hopes to lead Stanford to its 15th Pac-10 championship this weekend. The Cardinal is also looking
for more NCAA qualifying times as the all-important postseason begins.
be like," Rosenthal said.
All of the members of the div
ing team have been working hard
and changing technique in
preparation for the conference
title meet.
Rosenthal has stood out on the
team all season with several top
three finishes, and her coach
hopes to see her capture top-three
spots at this weekend's meet.
Sophomore Lauren Donovan is
expected to build on her recent

stellar performance against Cal.
Senior McKenze Murphy is what
Schavone calls a "solid competi
tor" and the expectations of her
are also very high. Freshman
Michaela Skloven lias made more
mechanical changes to her diving
than any of her teammates, and
the coaching staff believes that she
is a better diver now than she's
ever been.
Echoing the sentiments of her
coach, Rosenthal believes that the
team as a whole is prepared.
"We're focused and concentrating
on the end of the season. This
meet should tell us where we
stand."
