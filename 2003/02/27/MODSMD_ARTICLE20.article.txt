men's tennis team (7-2).
By the time he stepped onto
campus last September, the
freshman from Manhattan
Beach, Calif, had already trav
eled around the world on the
professional tennis tour. He de
ferred his acceptance to Stan
ford fora year in order to give
the pro tour a try while still re
taining his amateur status.
"My parents were very sup
portive of the idea," Corkery

said. "I decided that I might not
have another opportunity like
this again, to travel around the
world and play tennis without
anything else to worry about."
Looking back, does Corkery
feel he made the right choice?
"It was a really positive expe
rience. I've played more tennis
in the past year than I had in my
whole life," Corkery said.
He attained career-best world
rankings of No. 401 in doubles
and No. 493 in singles at the end
of 2002 by winning three dou
bles tournaments and reaching
two singles finals.
During his year-long odyssey,
Corkery found that he missed
being in school.
"I was a little apprehensive
about whether I could cut it aca
demically at such a prestigious
university as Stanford, especially

after a year of not doing any
thing academic," Corkery said.
"But at the same time, I was ex
cited to learn again."
While most college freshmen
must adjust to greater amounts
of freedom, the opposite is true
of Corkery.
"When he was on the tour, he
was doing it all alone," coach
Dick Gould said. "He didn't have
a coach with him or his family.
Last year, he could wake up
whenever he wanted, practice
whenever he wanted and in any
way he wanted. And then all of a
sudden comes the regimented
and structured environment of
college .... He's made the ad
justment very well."
Corkery has thrived at Stan
ford since his arrival. During fall
tournament play, he went 8-3 in
singles and 7-2 in doubles with fel
low freshman James Pade. He was

rewarded with a No. 50 national
singles ranking while he and Fade
are ranked No. 9 in doubles.
Since the dual-match season
began in early February, Cork
ery has continued his strong
play, recording a 6-1 singles
record. During National Team
Indoor Championships, he did
not lose a singles match.
"He's a very intelligent play
er," Gould said. "He's solid fun
damentally. He's got a good feel
for the game, for attacking and
setting up points. He really un
derstands tennis and the concept
of playing tactically."
Corkery's talent was dis
played Tuesday as he demol
ished Utah's Daniel Lohff 6-0, 6-
0 at the second singles position.
Stanford dominated the dual
match, not losing a single set en
route to a 7-0 victory over un
ranked Utah (4-5).
Corkery and Pade will lead
the charge this weekend as Stan
ford enters four pairs in the Pa
cific Coast Men's Doubles Cham
pionship in Lajolla, Ca.
