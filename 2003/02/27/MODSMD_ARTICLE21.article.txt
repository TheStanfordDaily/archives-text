# Card has an ace up its sleeve

Although Stanford is ripe with international di
versity, there is only one international player on
the women's tennis team. Freshman Alice Barnes,
who hails from Cambridge, U.K., is currently No.
13 in the nation and has helped propel Stanford
(5-1, 1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) to a No. 3 ranking
in the country.

at Oregon, Saturday.

No stranger to success as a prep, Barnes finished
as the top girls 16-and-under player in Britain in
1999 and 2000. She also competed in Junior Wim
bledon for four years, advancing to the third round
in 2002.
Barnes has had no trouble fitting in on Stanford's
courts due to her prowess as a junior.
"With considerable tournament experience in
cluding playing a lot internationally, it is much easier
to come in to a new environment like college tennis
and perform well immediately and not find it too
daunting," coach Lele Forood said.
Barnes decided that she wanted to continue her
junior successes in a higher level of competition,
eventually joining a very deep Stanford recruiting
class that included fellow freshmen Amber Liu, Joan
na Kao and Jessica Leek.
"I knew that I wanted to continue playing tennis
after my junior career, but I was also certain that I
didn't want to turn pro and completely sacrifice my
education," Barnes said. "University in England
wasn't an option because the standard of tennis there
is very low."
Barnes set a Stanford career as her first choice, a
goal that seemed highly likely considering that two of
her siblings also played collegiate tennis in the U.S.
"Stanford tennis's reputation is well known, even
in England, and I felt privileged to be given the op
portunity to become a part of such a wonderful tradi
tion," Barnes said.
Victories and hard work as a junior have trans
formed into collegiate success for Barnes. The fresh
man finished the fall season with a 10-2 record in sin
gles and was ranked No. 13 in the ITAfall rankings.
She also fought her way into the final of the challeng
ing Omni Hotels Northwest Regional before losing to
Raquel Kops-Jones of California.
Her individual success in tournaments has not af
fected her overall goals or marred her dedication to
the team, however.
"All I can think about for now is making sure that

[the juniors] leave college with four NCAA rings, then
I'll fix us on trying to help [the sophomores] get four
— then maybe I'll think about what to do after col
lege," Barnes said.
In (he spring season, Barnes has been a perfect 6-
0 after assuming the No. 4 singles spot for the Cardi
nal. In addition, she and Liu have posted a 5-1 record
in doubles as Stanford's No. 2 pairing.
The only blemish on both her doubles record
and the Cardinal's overall record was a 4-3 loss to
