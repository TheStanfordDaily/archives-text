# Getting leid: Matt's adventures in Hawaii
## 
### 
When you land at the
Honolulu airport,
you step off the
plane and walk
down a covered breezeway to
wards the baggage claim. Palm
trees rise up next to you, fronds
rustling in the wind and coconuts
dangling overhead. The control
tower bears a bright red neon
sign — "Aloha! Welcome to Par
adise."
(What were you expecting me
to start with, some joke about get

ting leid as soon as you touch
down?)
It's a sight that my teammates
on the Stanford Men's Ultimate
Team (S.M.U.T.) and I got to see
when we arrived in Hawaii late in
the evening on Valentine's Day.
(OK, maybe that joke would
have been appropriate, after all.)
We were in Oahu to compete
in the 16th-annual Kaimana
Klassik, a three-day tournament
composed of club teams from the
continental U.S., Hawaii and

Australia.
For four days
and three nights
we slept on the
beach, woke up
by going fora
swim in the
sparkling waters
of the Pacific,
then walked 10

minutes through the trees to the
fields to eat a breakfast of fresh is
land fruit and bagels. We played
at the foot of Ko'olau mountains

— cliffs thousands of feet tall that
rise straight up out of the valley
floor.
Tough, eh?
Of course, it wasn't all fun and
games.
Wait a minute — actually it
was.
Saturday morning we awoke
as the second seed in the tourna
ment, ready to face our alumni
team in the first pool play game.


Matt Babin
Calling themselves "Highway 17"
due to the inclusion of some older
players from Santa Cruz, their
veteran wisdom outdueled our
young athleticism and they es
caped with the win. We turned
up our intensity later that day,
taking down the Shakkah Bred
dahs (a Maui team) and losing a
close game to the Grey Tide, a
team of Santa Barbara alums.
Saturday night found us back
at the fields after an afternoon
bodysurfing session, ready to
party it up with Oahu's finest.
The Kona brewery was kind
enough to leave a truck full of
Longboard Lager and Fire Rock
Red Pale Ale parked on the fields
for the weekend, making boat

racing just that much easier.
Following a hula presentation
by children from the local school
(who luckily escaped before
things got really out of hand), the
night disintegrated into Kona
beer, dancing . . . and a few ine
briated veterans with a set of hair
clippers. I won't go into details to
protect the innocent (and the
guilty), but suffice to say that I
now look quite different from
that picture The Daily still puts
next to my articles.
My style was referred to as The
Double Hemisphere. Strange as
it was, it still couldn't hold a can
dle to The Mr. T, The Target or
The Wolverine. Chances are if
you see someone this week with a
really messed up haircut or a
freshly shaven head, he's on the
ultimate team.
The haircuts were the talk of
the tournament the next day, even

as we marched to a quarterfinal
matchup against The Doughboys,
a mix of old players from San
Diego / Australia / Great Britain.
A close game throughout, Stan
ford Bloodthirsty emerged victo
rious in the end.
The competition, while intense
during the game, was relaxed
after the final score as we engaged
in Australian waffle tossing (and
mostly beer drinking) with our
opponents after the game.
Monday morning found us
matched up against Highway 17
in the semifinals. Though we had
improved from our first game
against them, we still went down
in defeat. There was only one
thing with which we could com
fort ourselves with —we were
leaving the next day for Kauai.
Because really, what else com
forts you like a beach house with
a hot tub and a view of hump

backs bleaching in the ocean
swells? We hiked miles in the Na
Pali Coast, we surfed in Hanalei
Bay, we swam beneath waterfalls,
we snorkeled in Anahol'a and
spent hours picking free fruit at a
guava plantation. We ran into
James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) at
Safeway and the captain of the
first Stanford Ultimate team on
the beach.
It was a surreal week — and
not just because I caught myself
working on problem sets on the
beach ... or even because my
sleep schedule is still jumbled up
from the red eye.
It was, in the fewest words -
No Ka Oi.
The Very Best.

Economics and Italian who wants to

now look quite different from
that picture The Daily still puts
next to my articles.
My style was referred to as The
Double Hemisphere. Strange as
it was, it still couldn't hold a can
dle to The Mr. T, The Target or
The Wolverine. Chances are if
you see someone this week with a
really messed up haircut or a
freshly shaven head, he's on the
ultimate team.
The haircuts were the talk of
the tournament the next day, even

as we marched to a quarterfinal
matchup against The Doughboys,
a mix of old players from San
Diego / Australia / Great Britain.
A close game throughout, Stan
ford Bloodthirsty emerged victo
rious in the end.
The competition, while intense
during the game, was relaxed
after the final score as we engaged
in Australian waffle tossing (and
mostly beer drinking) with our
opponents after the game.
Monday morning found us
matched up against Highway 17
in the semifinals. Though we had
improved from our first game
against them, we still went down
in defeat. There was only one
thing with which we could com
fort ourselves with —we were
leaving the next day for Kauai.
Because really, what else com
forts you like a beach house with
a hot tub and a view of hump

backs bleaching in the ocean
swells? We hiked miles in the Na
Pali Coast, we surfed in Hanalei
Bay, we swam beneath waterfalls,
we snorkeled in Anahol'a and
spent hours picking free fruit at a
guava plantation. We ran into
James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) at
Safeway and the captain of the
first Stanford Ultimate team on
the beach.
It was a surreal week — and
not just because I caught myself
working on problem sets on the
beach ... or even because my
sleep schedule is still jumbled up
from the red eye.
It was, in the fewest words -
No Ka Oi.
The Very Best.
