# Getting leid: Matt's adventures in Hawaii
## 
### 
When you land at the
Honolulu airport,
you step off the
plane and walk
down a covered breezeway to
wards the baggage claim. Palm
trees rise up next to you, fronds
rustling in the wind and coconuts
dangling overhead. The control
tower bears a bright red neon
sign — "Aloha! Welcome to Par
adise."
(What were you expecting me
to start with, some joke about get

ting leid as soon as you touch
down?)
It's a sight that my teammates
on the Stanford Men's Ultimate
Team (S.M.U.T.) and I got to see
when we arrived in Hawaii late in
the evening on Valentine's Day.
(OK, maybe that joke would
have been appropriate, after all.)
We were in Oahu to compete
in the 16th-annual Kaimana
Klassik, a three-day tournament
composed of club teams from the
continental U.S., Hawaii and

Australia.
For four days
and three nights
we slept on the
beach, woke up
by going fora
swim in the
sparkling waters
of the Pacific,
then walked 10

minutes through the trees to the
fields to eat a breakfast of fresh is
land fruit and bagels. We played
at the foot of Ko'olau mountains

— cliffs thousands of feet tall that
rise straight up out of the valley
floor.
Tough, eh?
Of course, it wasn't all fun and
games.
Wait a minute — actually it
was.
Saturday morning we awoke
as the second seed in the tourna
ment, ready to face our alumni
team in the first pool play game.
