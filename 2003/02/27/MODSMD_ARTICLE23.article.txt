### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Almost half of the Stanford
men's gymnastics team will com
pete at home for the last time this
Saturday in an all-important meet
featuring four of the nation's top
ten teams.

Men's Gymnastics
vs. Michigan, Cal ( Washington and
Nebraska, Saturday, 7 p.m.

Competing with the country's
smallest roster, the Cardinal finds
itself ranked eighth thanks in part
to graduating seniors Marshall
Erwin, Matt McLean, Paul
O'Leary, and Cade Raggio, who
represent as many as 22 of the
team's 36 possible routines.
"They add an important dimen
sion of experience to the team," ju
nior Dan Gill said. "It's comforting
to know you can count on some
guys to hit when it matters. They
know their role and are always
ready to go."
A perfect home record, a chance
to avenge a recent loss to Cal and
an opportunity to improve the
Cardinal's Regional Qualifying
Score are at all stake on Senior
Night as the men take on No. 4 Cal
ifornia, No. 5 Michigan, No. 9 Ne

braska and Washington.
"A lot of people are coming,"
O'Leary said. "I know it'll be the
most fun of any home meet I've
ever had."
As one of the graduating se
niors, O'Leary accounts for five of
the team's routines this season.
Originally a walk-on to the Stan
ford squad, O'Leary improved
dramatically his sophomore year to
become a team leader and a legiti
mate national contender on sever

al events.
Also performing for the last time
at home is McLean, one of Stan
ford's two all-arounders. McLean
started the season in breakout lash
ion with a perfect six-for-six perfor
mance at the Cardinal Open.
Known for his powerful vault and
clean execution on all events,
McLean has garnered eight top
three finishes so far this season.
The team is hoping fora final
home performance from Raggio,

who has been the nation's top
ranked gymnast on the pommel
horse all season long. Raggio, con
sidered one of the cleanest gym
nasts in the world, didn't compete
against the Air Force Academy last
week because of inflammation in
his wrists.
Finally, the team also looks for
another dominating performance
from Erwin on rings. He is one of
the strongest gymnasts in the
country and every routine he's
competed on the event has easily
taken first place in collegiate com
petition. The two-time All-Ameri
can has improved his execution
significantly this season as he pre
pares to defend his NCAA title on
the apparatus.
"We'll miss them," Gill said.
"Come spring quarter it'll be pretty
lonely in the gym."
With Raggio and sophomore
Daniel Torres-Ran gel's return to
competition, coach Thom Glielmi
said this might be the first time the
team will compete its full lineup.
The Cardinal will need all the
help they can get against the strong
competition. Enjoying their
"spring" break in sunny California,

week.
"With Michigan there, practice
felt a lot like training camp this
week," O'Leary said. "We know
what they're doing and they know
what we're doing and we want to
intimidate each other as much as
possible."
Gill added, "We're at an intensi
ty peak. We're adding new skills
and making routines more difficult
to make us uncomfortable so we'll
be ready for NGAAs."
After splitting their first two
meetings this season with Cal, the
team is especially motivated to
squelch the Golden Bears this time
around.
"Cal is still the team to beat,"
Glielmi said.
With only three regular-season
meets left in the schedule, the
team needs its best score of the
season to improve its Regional
Qualifying Score, which is deter

mined by averaging the team's
best home-meet score and top two
scores on the road. The teams
with the top 12 RQS at the end of
season earn a berth to the NCAA
Championships.
"It'll be a good show from all the
strong teams participating," Gliel
mi said. "We'll see some of the best
gymnastics in the country this
weekend."
