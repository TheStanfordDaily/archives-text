For the No. 19 Stanford basket
ball team, it has been a season of
surprises, of exceeding expecta
tions and of a little bit of luck.

Men's Basketball
vs. Arizona St., tonight, 7 p.m.
vs. No. 1 Arizona, Saturday, 4 p.m.

After the win over No. 11 Xavier
early in the season, the Stanford
Sixth Man Club incredulously
rushed the court. An upset of Flori
da and a convincing win over Con
zaga caused the Stanford faithful to
scratch their brows all the more fu
riously. A Pacific-10 Conference
season that has seen the Cardinal
(21-6) race to a 12-3 mark — a full
two games better than a year ago —
has the Farm positively perplexed.
"Sure, we have beaten lots of
good teams," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery, whose team
was picked to finish seventh in the
conference's preseason poll. "I
don't know if surprise is a good
word, because as you go into each
game you say 'If we do this, this
and this, we can win.' But when
you start stacking them up, we
have definitely won more than our
share."
Whether pundits can admit it or
not, Montgomery's hodge-podge
roster is more than a fortuitous un
derdog — it is a legitimate ball
club. And going into this week
end's games against Arizona State
(17-8, 9-5 Pac-10) and No. 1 Ari

zona (21-2, 13-1) the Cardinal is
still in a position to capture a con
ference title.
While all season the under
manned Stanford team has pros
pered in the unfamiliar role of un
derdog, if there is one thing that is
familiar to Montgomery and his
squad, it is the pressure that comes
toward the end of the season.
"In the last six or seven years, we
have been in a position where we
have had to win to win the confer
ence, or had to win to get second,"
Montgomery said. "If you are
going to be in that position in the
last two weeks it is always going to
be critical."
Stanford's first challenge is
tonight's matchup with a talented
Arizona State squad that rests in
fourth place in the Pac-10, largely
due to the play of freshman for
ward Ike Diogu.
Averaging 18.6 points per
game, Diogu has established him
self not only among the confer
ence's best post players, but as one
of the premiere first-year players
in the nation.
"[Diogu has] got really good
field inside, and he really knows
how to secure the ball and shield
himself and all that kind of stuff,"
Montgomery said.
In its first meeting, the Cardinal
pulled out a 58-57 win in Tempe,
largely due to effective use of the
zone defense in the second half to
contain Diogu.

dress had 21 points, including a
put back with 40 seconds remain
ing to secure the win for the Cardi
nal.
However, both teams have ma
tured since that first meeting, and
one thing that comes with having a
freshman star is that it takes a little
while fora team to become fully ad
justed to what he can do. Not only
has Diogu gotten more experience
in the college game, but his team
mates are more aware of how to in
tegrate his enormous talent into
their game plan.
While the Sun Devils have large
ly relied on fresh blood to beef up
their roster, it is hard to discuss the
talent of Arizona without mention
ing their abundance of experience.

"1 think Arizona's success you
can put on a lot of people," Mont
gomery said. "Hut having a fifth
year senior in Rick Anderson, and
Luke Walton and Jason Gardner
— two premiere fourth year play
ers — has been huge for them."
But while Anderson, Walton
and Gardner have provided the
poise and consistency that keeps a
team at the top of the national
rankings, lately it has been the play
of sophomores Salim Stoudamire
and Channing Frye that has pro
vided an offensive spark.
Frye especially has been invalu
able for Arizona in the past few
weeks. The center has averaged 19
points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.8
blocked shots over the last five
games.
"He's gotten aggressive on de
fense and lias made the basket area
his, antl if anyone is coming in
there to score, he's going to chal

lenge it," Arizona coach Lute Olson
said "He's really, really stepping his
game up."
To have any chance at the con
ference title, Stanford will have to
quell Channing's fiery streak Satur
day. If the Wildcats tall to No. 21
California tonight and Stanford gets
by ASU, then Saturday's contest will
be for first place in the Pac-1().
But neither team will be sur
prised by the Cardinal this time
around.
