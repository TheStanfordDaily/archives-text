### MIKEY LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Provost John Etchemendy discussed
queer issues, faculty diversity and finan
cial aid concerns last night at an ASSU
Town Hall, designed to give students the
opportunity to interact with high-level
administrators.
The program's agenda was tailored to
address issues that Etchemendy was in
volved with in the University.
"[Etchemendy] oversees VPSA, which
the LGBT-CRC falls under," said sopho
more Hunter Hargraves, ASSU chief of
staff and also a student staff member at
the Lesbian / Gay / Bisexual / Transgen

Council, we added faculty diversity [to
the town hall agenda]. As provost, he

was queer issues, ranging from a new

questions addressed as well as the quality

of the answers.
"I was impressed by the way the ASSU
framed the issues as well as the desire on
the part of the administration to support
LGBT students," he said.
Etchemendy then addressed faculty
diversity issues, specifically responding to
ASSU President Monica Henestroza's in
troduction, which pointed out the short
falls in the faculty diversity.
"The statistics are daunting," said
Henestroza, a senior. "Eighty-five per
cent of faculty are white and 78 percent
are male whereas 3 percent are Latino, 3
percent are black, 10 percent are Asian or
Asian-American and less than 1 percent
are Native American."
Etchemendy responded, "We've
made progress, but the progress is ago

different backgrounds have different in-
