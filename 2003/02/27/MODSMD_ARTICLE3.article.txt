### MIKEY LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Provost John Etchemendy discussed
queer issues, faculty diversity and finan
cial aid concerns last night at an ASSU
Town Hall, designed to give students the
opportunity to interact with high-level
administrators.
The program's agenda was tailored to
address issues that Etchemendy was in
volved with in the University.
"[Etchemendy] oversees VPSA, which
the LGBT-CRC falls under," said sopho
more Hunter Hargraves, ASSU chief of
staff and also a student staff member at
the Lesbian / Gay / Bisexual / Transgen
der Community Resources Center. "Be
cause he established the Diversity Action
Council, we added faculty diversity [to
the town hall agenda]. As provost, he
writes the budget, which is why we dis
cussed financial aid."

The first topic discussed at the meeting
was queer issues, ranging from a new
venue for the LGBT-CRC, whether the
University provides adequate support for
queer students and the possibility of cre
ating a queer studies program.
"Building is expensive around here,"
Etchemendy said about creating more
space, a hot topic among Stanford's com
munity. "But I think the community cen
ters should expand. Will it happen with
in the next four years? Probably not, to be
honest with you."
Regarding institutional support of
queer issues, he said, "I would think and
hope that most advisers are queer-friend
ly. Stanford is really at the forefront of
these issues. We have to be one of the first
universities that has offered benefits to
domestic partners."
LGBT-CRC Director Ben Davidson
said he was pleased with the quality of the
questions addressed as well as the quality

of the answers.
"I was impressed by the way the ASSU
framed the issues as well as the desire on
the part of the administration to support
LGBT students," he said.
Etchemendy then addressed faculty
diversity issues, specifically responding to
ASSU President Monica Henestroza's in
troduction, which pointed out the short
falls in the faculty diversity.
"The statistics are daunting," said
Henestroza, a senior. "Eighty-five per
cent of faculty are white and 78 percent
are male whereas 3 percent are Latino, 3
percent are black, 10 percent are Asian or
Asian-American and less than 1 percent
are Native American."
Etchemendy responded, "We've
made progress, but the progress is ago
nizingly slow." He added, "People from
different backgrounds have different in-

sights and I believe that if you have
better diversity, you will have bet
ter [perspectives] and we will be a
stronger institution."
Henestroza commended
Etchemendy's creation of the Di
versity Action Council in 2001.
As for student financial aid,
Etchemendy said he was confident
that Stanford is competitive with
other programs.
"We are very competitive with

schools like Harvard and Prince
ton," he said. "However, we do fall
short in the area of need-blind ad
missions for international stu
dents. While we are absolutely
committed to need-blind admis
sions for undergraduates, we
don't have enough money to do
the same for international stu
dents."
Etchemendy added that, be
cause the University has a need
blind policy, it has been chal
lenging to provide aid for the
increasing number of families
who need ii due to the lagging
economy.
