# Operation Bracketville
## Stanford already owns the Pac-10, but needs wins for a high NCAA seed 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team faces a sort of no-win (or no-lose)
situation this weekend — depending
on which way you look at it.

Having clinched its third straight
Pacific-10 Conference title, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-3, 14-2 Pac-10) has al
ready secured the No. 1 seed in the
Pac-10 tournament starting next Fri
day.
Stanford is the best team in the Pac
-10, and no matter what happens in the
conference tournament next week,
Stanford will be headed to the land of
Bracketville.
But right now, Stanford is entered
in the seeding game. It's that sort of
ambiguous time when only losses can
hurt yon and wins don't necessarily
help you — unless somebody else
loses.
So the Cardinal finds a way to re
spond to the challenge of staying fo
cused this weekend in the Southwest.
Thursday, the Cardinal will play a

rough road game at No. 24 Arizona
(18-7, 11-5). But things don't necessar
ily get any easier Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford travels to Tempe to
face off against always-pesky Arizona
State (14-11, 6-10).
Coming out of the desert with a
sweep to conclude the regular season
should only help the Cardinal jockey
fora higher seed in the forthcoming
NCAA Tournament, but nothing's as
sured.
Of course, losing either one of those
games would be detrimental to the
team's psyche and momentum head
ing into the postseason.
That's why the Cardinal is trying to
stay focused and take this trip serious
ty-
"Having won in some way takes
away a little bit of your edge," said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer,
who was named a finalist for the Nai
smith Women's College Basketball
Coach of the Year Award earlier this
week. "We're looking to go down and
play well.
"We've got to use this to get the best
seed we can get for the Tournament."
And it's a more dangerous situation
than at first glance.
The Wildcats are playing with
everything to lose — they sit in third
place in the conference, one game be
hind Washington. Arizona could tie
the Huskies if they win out —and
would clinch second place outright

with a Washington loss to Wash
ington State.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils are
playing with nothing to lose. They
head into the weekend entrenched
in seventh place and seem destined
to play a tough first-round confer
ence tournament game.
But Charli-Turner Thome's
team has enough talent to pull
things together next weekend, and
their momentum could begin with
an upset victory over Stanford.
"I actually think this is a hard
trip for us," VanDerveer said. "At
this point, it's all about executing
and doing the right thing."
So taking all that into considera
tion, it seems like no one — not ju
nior Nicole Powell, not aching
sophomores Chelsea Trotter or
Susan King — will be getting a
substantial amount of time off this
weekend.
"You know, it always sounds
good on Wednesday, but when
you get into that game, you want to
do as well as you can," VanDerveer
said. "You have a responsibility to
compete, but we don't want to
overuse anyone."
And that's why VanDerveer
mentioned that sophomore guard
Kelley Suminski might get a little
bit of rest. (Suminski is a little bit fa
tigued from what VanDerveer calls
the "wear and tear" of the college
season.)
As a result, VanDerveer said she
expects to use both freshman
guards — Krista Rappahahn and
Clare Bodensteiner — more ex
tensively this weekend. The Stan
ford coach also hopes to get both
little-used posts Shelley Nweke
and Sara McGee some game time
— especially against the Wildcats'
freshman sensation, Shawntinice
Polk.
That doesn't mean they'll stop
her, though. The 6-foot-5 center
leads the Wildcats with 17.5 points
and leads the Pac-10 in rebound
ing (10.9 rpg) and field goal per
centage (.618).
It was Polk's inability to convert
shots down the stretch that helped
host Stanford close out a come
from-behintl 82-74 victory in the
opening weekend of Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal trailed by as many as
13 points before forging a furious
second-half comeback — without
the superstar Powell, too.
But the Cardinal will have its
Naismith Award candidate this
time, and that's a good thing.
Powell, a Phoenix native, loves
playing in her home state. In her
previous two trips to Arizona, she
has averaged 20 points, 9.8 re
bounds and 4.5 assists.
That's just food for thought at
this point, though.
There are bigger things ahead
for the Cardinal.
"What we've demonstrated to
the rest of the Pac-10 is that we're
the most consistent winners," Van-
Derveer said. "But we want to do a
better job on the road and win the
tournament. We've got our chal
lenges ahead of us."

sophomores Chelsea Trotter or
Susan King — will be getting a
substantial amount of time off this
weekend.
"You know, it always sounds
good on Wednesday, but when
you get into that game, you want to
do as well as you can," VanDerveer
said. "You have a responsibility to
compete, but we don't want to
overuse anyone."
And that's why VanDerveer
mentioned that sophomore guard
Kelley Suminski might get a little
bit of rest. (Suminski is a little bit fa
tigued from what VanDerveer calls
the "wear and tear" of the college
season.)
As a result, VanDerveer said she
expects to use both freshman
guards — Krista Rappahahn and
Clare Bodensteiner — more ex
tensively this weekend. The Stan
ford coach also hopes to get both
little-used posts Shelley Nweke
and Sara McGee some game time
— especially against the Wildcats'
freshman sensation, Shawntinice
Polk.
That doesn't mean they'll stop
her, though. The 6-foot-5 center
leads the Wildcats with 17.5 points
and leads the Pac-10 in rebound
ing (10.9 rpg) and field goal per
centage (.618).
It was Polk's inability to convert
shots down the stretch that helped
host Stanford close out a come
from-behintl 82-74 victory in the
opening weekend of Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal trailed by as many as
13 points before forging a furious
second-half comeback — without
the superstar Powell, too.
But the Cardinal will have its
Naismith Award candidate this
time, and that's a good thing.
Powell, a Phoenix native, loves
playing in her home state. In her
previous two trips to Arizona, she
has averaged 20 points, 9.8 re
bounds and 4.5 assists.
That's just food for thought at
this point, though.
There are bigger things ahead
for the Cardinal.
"What we've demonstrated to
the rest of the Pac-10 is that we're
the most consistent winners," Van-
Derveer said. "But we want to do a
better job on the road and win the
tournament. We've got our chal
lenges ahead of us."
The Stanford women's basketball
team faces a sort of no-win (or no-lose)
situation this weekend — depending
on which way you look at it.

at Arizona St., tonight, 6 p.m.
at No. 24 Arizona, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Having clinched its third straight
Pacific-10 Conference title, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-3, 14-2 Pac-10) has al
ready secured the No. 1 seed in the
Pac-10 tournament starting next Fri
day.
Stanford is the best team in the Pac
-10, and no matter what happens in the
conference tournament next week,
Stanford will be headed to the land of
Bracketville.
But right now, Stanford is entered
in the seeding game. It's that sort of
ambiguous time when only losses can
hurt yon and wins don't necessarily
help you — unless somebody else
loses.
So the Cardinal finds a way to re
spond to the challenge of staying fo
cused this weekend in the Southwest.
Thursday, the Cardinal will play a

rough road game at No. 24 Arizona
(18-7, 11-5). But things don't necessar
ily get any easier Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford travels to Tempe to
face off against always-pesky Arizona
State (14-11, 6-10).
Coming out of the desert with a
sweep to conclude the regular season
should only help the Cardinal jockey
fora higher seed in the forthcoming
NCAA Tournament, but nothing's as
sured.
Of course, losing either one of those
games would be detrimental to the
team's psyche and momentum head
ing into the postseason.
That's why the Cardinal is trying to
stay focused and take this trip serious
ty-
"Having won in some way takes
away a little bit of your edge," said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer,
who was named a finalist for the Nai
smith Women's College Basketball
Coach of the Year Award earlier this
week. "We're looking to go down and
play well.
"We've got to use this to get the best
seed we can get for the Tournament."
And it's a more dangerous situation
than at first glance.
The Wildcats are playing with
everything to lose — they sit in third
place in the conference, one game be
hind Washington. Arizona could tie
the Huskies if they win out —and
would clinch second place outright

Sophomore Azella Perryman and the No. 9 Cardinal women's bas
ketball team put on a show for the home crowd last weekend.
with a Washington loss to Wash
ington State.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils are
playing with nothing to lose. They
head into the weekend entrenched
in seventh place and seem destined
to play a tough first-round confer
ence tournament game.
But Charli-Turner Thome's
team has enough talent to pull
things together next weekend, and
their momentum could begin with
an upset victory over Stanford.
"I actually think this is a hard
trip for us," VanDerveer said. "At
this point, it's all about executing
and doing the right thing."
So taking all that into considera
tion, it seems like no one — not ju
nior Nicole Powell, not aching
