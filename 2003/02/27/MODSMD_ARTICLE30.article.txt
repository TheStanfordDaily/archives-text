## Stanford already owns the Pac-10, but needs wins for a high NCAA seed

The Stanford women's basketball
team faces a sort of no-win (or no-lose)
situation this weekend — depending
on which way you look at it.

at No. 24 Arizona, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Having clinched its third straight
Pacific-10 Conference title, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-3, 14-2 Pac-10) has al
ready secured the No. 1 seed in the
Pac-10 tournament starting next Fri
day.
Stanford is the best team in the Pac
-10, and no matter what happens in the
conference tournament next week,
Stanford will be headed to the land of
Bracketville.
But right now, Stanford is entered
in the seeding game. It's that sort of
ambiguous time when only losses can
hurt yon and wins don't necessarily
help you — unless somebody else
loses.
So the Cardinal finds a way to re
spond to the challenge of staying fo
cused this weekend in the Southwest.
Thursday, the Cardinal will play a

rough road game at No. 24 Arizona
(18-7, 11-5). But things don't necessar
ily get any easier Saturday afternoon,
when Stanford travels to Tempe to
face off against always-pesky Arizona
State (14-11, 6-10).
Coming out of the desert with a
sweep to conclude the regular season
should only help the Cardinal jockey
fora higher seed in the forthcoming
NCAA Tournament, but nothing's as
sured.
Of course, losing either one of those
games would be detrimental to the
team's psyche and momentum head
ing into the postseason.
That's why the Cardinal is trying to
stay focused and take this trip serious
ty-
"Having won in some way takes
away a little bit of your edge," said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer,
who was named a finalist for the Nai
smith Women's College Basketball
Coach of the Year Award earlier this
week. "We're looking to go down and
play well.
"We've got to use this to get the best
seed we can get for the Tournament."
And it's a more dangerous situation
than at first glance.
The Wildcats are playing with
everything to lose — they sit in third
place in the conference, one game be
hind Washington. Arizona could tie
the Huskies if they win out —and
would clinch second place outright
