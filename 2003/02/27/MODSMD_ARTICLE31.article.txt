## Josh childress: THE CARD'S NO. 1 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Josh Childress came into Stan
ford with a top-rate billing.
"The future," some called
him.
"A new era," others said.
But that doesn't mean that he
hasn't had his share of ups and
downs.
That doesn't mean that the
transition from high school star
dom to collegiate prominence
has been easy.
After beginning his freshman
year as a starter for the Cardinal,
Childress was later moved to the
bench for the sake of team chem
istry, a move that the 6-foot-8
freshman wasn't accustomed to.
And all he learned from tak
ing a seat was that he didn't want
to be there much longer.
"[Coming off the bench]
wasn't hard. It was just a lot dif
ferent. I just wasn't used to that at
all. I'd much rather start," he says
now with a laugh.
But last year, he wasn't smil
ing about it all that much. In fact,
mentally he was a much different
player, although his on-court de
meanor has since altered.
Last season, if Childress
missed a shot or made a mistake
early in the game, his body lan

guage completely changed. Sud
denly the smiley, confident Mc-
Donald's /\ll-American ran up
and down the court with the look
of defeat in his eyes, at times
seeming as if the weight of expec
tation (from himself and others)
had finally gotten the best of him.
"The hardest part about last
year was staying confident and
staying motivated," Childress ex
plained. "You kinda get discour
aged and you get down on your
self. But you just have to work
through that though."
But all of that doesn't take
away from the fact that it is his jer
sey on sale now, draped lankily
over store mannequins, a name
less back with just the No. 1 to
identify.
Because whether he knows it
or not — he is Stanford's ambas
sador now.
The first to be called out dur
ing starting lineup announce
ments and the only one who jogs
all the way over to the opposing
team's bench to shake the other
coach's hand before the start of
the game.
Like every great diplomat,
Childress' strongest asset is that
he can impact a game in a host of
different ways. He's probably


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore forward Josh Childress has hung around the Farm for only
two years, but already has lived up to his status as Stanford's first Mc
donald's Ail-American.
Stanford's most complete player —
the definitive swingman who con
sistently puts up numbers in every
major statistic al category.
The figures don't lie.
He's second on the team in scor
ing with 14 points per game. He's
second in the Pacific-10 Conference
(and first on his team) in rebound
ing with eight boards per game. He
leads his team in both steals and
blocks. And with at least five games
still remaining in his sophomore
year, he's already become Stan
ford's 13th all-time blocker.
"Josh has been really steady for
us," Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "He has gotten
stronger and he's much more ca
pable."

Further, he's drawing some of
the Pac-lO's toughest matchups de
fensively. This weekend he'll guard
Arizona's Luke Walton if Stanford
opts to go man and next weekend
against California he'll draw the
Pac-lO's leading scorer in Joe Shipp.
The combination of his athletic
prowess with a quiet grace trans
lates into an interesting duality in
his game — he's a capable leaper
with the ability to bring the crowd
to its feet at any moment, who
mixes in important, but unmemo
rable, mid-range jumpers and easy
layups in transition— making his
ability to sneak onto a stat sheet
exist as both his blessing and his
curse.
So many of the things he does on
the court go unnoticed — a strong
defensive rebound followed by a
quick outlet pass leads to an easy
Stanford layup, or a touched ball
leads to a Cardinal steal.

But, more importantly, he
seems to understand the rhythm of
the game, understands that it's not
all about slam dunks and deep 3-
pointers. His mid-range jumper is
much improved from last season
and his finger roll is becoming a
patented move.
"He has got those quick moves
where he steps away and shoots the
ball," Montgomery said. "He
doesn't look to get into people be
cause he isn't strong enough. The
fact that he is a little bit thin means
he has learned how to get open and
get shots."
And yet there's still room for im
provement — still weight left to
gain in the offseason and a jump
shot to perfect. Still there are more
hands left to shake and games left
to win. And, most importantly,
there's still time for him to mature
into the player that he is capable of
becoming.
