## Josh childress: THE CARD'S NO. 1 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Josh Childress came into Stan
ford with a top-rate billing.
"The future," some called
him.
"A new era," others said.
But that doesn't mean that he
hasn't had his share of ups and
downs.
That doesn't mean that the
transition from high school star
dom to collegiate prominence
has been easy.
After beginning his freshman
year as a starter for the Cardinal,
Childress was later moved to the
bench for the sake of team chem
istry, a move that the 6-foot-8
freshman wasn't accustomed to.
And all he learned from tak
ing a seat was that he didn't want
to be there much longer.
"[Coming off the bench]
wasn't hard. It was just a lot dif
ferent. I just wasn't used to that at
all. I'd much rather start," he says
now with a laugh.
But last year, he wasn't smil
ing about it all that much. In fact,
mentally he was a much different
player, although his on-court de
meanor has since altered.
Last season, if Childress
missed a shot or made a mistake
early in the game, his body lan

guage completely changed. Sud
denly the smiley, confident Mc-
Donald's /\ll-American ran up
and down the court with the look
of defeat in his eyes, at times
seeming as if the weight of expec
tation (from himself and others)
had finally gotten the best of him.
"The hardest part about last
year was staying confident and
staying motivated," Childress ex
plained. "You kinda get discour
aged and you get down on your
self. But you just have to work
through that though."
But all of that doesn't take
away from the fact that it is his jer
sey on sale now, draped lankily
over store mannequins, a name
less back with just the No. 1 to
identify.
Because whether he knows it
or not â€” he is Stanford's ambas
sador now.
The first to be called out dur
ing starting lineup announce
ments and the only one who jogs
all the way over to the opposing
team's bench to shake the other
coach's hand before the start of
the game.
Like every great diplomat,
Childress' strongest asset is that
he can impact a game in a host of
different ways. He's probably

Sophomore forward Josh Childress has hung around the Farm for only
two years, but already has lived up to his status as Stanford's first Mc
