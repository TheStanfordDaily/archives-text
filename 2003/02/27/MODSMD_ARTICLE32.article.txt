# Dodd is ASU baller trapped in a skater's body
## Point guard Kyle Dodd has been the Sun Devil's sixth man and sparkplug this season 
### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
When the Stanford men host Arizona State
tonight, Cardinal fans will have their last op
portunity to witness perhaps the most
strangely talented players in the Pacific-10
Conference.
Sun Devil point guard Kyle Dodd isn't just
the Pac-lO's runaway leader in assist-to
turnover ratio. The 6-foot, 175-pound senior
reserve is also a 47-percent shooter from 3-
point range and to the continual surprise of
those seeing him for the first time, one of the
best slam-dunk artists in the country.
"That's always been one of my favorite
things, to see people's reactions the first time

[they see me dunk]," he said. "People are al
ways like, 'Geez, where did that come from?'
They think I'm this little skater-surfer from
California."
Dodd is one of many surprises on an Ari
zona State team that has come together this
season under coach Rob Evans, thanks in
large part to its talented senior core and su
perstar freshman Ike Diogu.
"I think Coach Evans has done a good job
of getting not only good players hut good
people in here," Dodd said. "Anytime you get
talented players like we had come in this year
fas freshmen], it's an instant impact, and it
helps that we've finally got a little age on our
team."
Like Arizona State as a whole, Dodd has
stepped up his game from last year, when he
struggled with his shot, shooting 13.8 percent
from 3-point range and 34 percent from the
field. This year, Dodd is shooting 53 percent
from the field, well above the 38 percent he
averaged his first three seasons.

"I was lacking confidence last year, so I just
got myself back in the gym and shot more,"
I)odd said. "It was mental. I was hesitating,
second-guessing myself, taking a second to
think before 1 shot, and you can't do that."
His improved marksmanship hasn't
tempted Dodd to stray from his role as a true
point guard, however. This season, in fact, he
has more assists (78) than shots taken (68).
Dodd's focus on passing the ball has cer
tainly paid dividends. His unfathomable
4.59:1 assist-to-turnover ratio more than
doubles the 2.15:1 posted by the runner-up
â€” Stanford junior guard Matt Lottich.
"It really gets to me when I turn the ball
over," he said. "I've always prided myself on
just running the team and taking care of the
ball."
Dodd is also expected to do some exciting
things with the ball in this year's ESPN slam
dunk contest.

Senior guard Kyle Dodd's vast improvement mirrors that of his Sun Devil
squad.
"They said it's looking pretty
good for me to be there," Dodd
said of discussions between
Evans and ESPN. "I've got a nice
little routine that I do."
Although he'd be free to
showcase his skills on ESPN,
Dodd hasn't always been so
lucky. While playing in a sum
mer league last year, he received
a technical foul for doing a 360-
degree dunk.
"They gave me a showboating
technical because they said I was
trying to show up the other
team," Dodd said. "I thought
that was kind of weak."
A broadcasting major, Dodd
has lately been thinking about
going into coaching after his ca
reer as a player comes to a close.
"Especially your senior year,
you get a chance to kind of think
about your career, and it seems
weird without having college
basketball in my life," he ex
plained.
Playing for the much-ad
mired Evans has given Dodd a
model coach to emulate.
"He's one of those guys that
has a nice mix of giving you free
dom to play but then he also is
very disciplined," Dodd said.
"He does a really good job of
helping us grow up, not just on
the basketball court, but in life."
For now, though, Dodd is just
worried about trying to contain
Stanford senior guard Julius
Barnes and deal with the hostile
Maples Pavilion crowd.
"We're both southern Califor
nia guys, so I've played against
him fora while, [and] that's al
ways a challenge because he's so
quick and explosive," he said.
As for the Sixth Man Club?
"Anytime you have a good
student section, it makes a big
difference," Dodd said. "They
get there early and start on you
early. It's fun."
