# Nicole Powell holds the power to keep Stanford
## Rising to the top 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With eight seconds remaining in the first half
against UCLA, on Saturday, Nicole Powell drove
into two defenders, used her body to create space,
elevated and missed a relatively easy seven foot
jumper. Missing the shot was beside the point.
Rather, it was the ease with which Powell created a
shot for herself that was remarkable.
The ability to create your own shot is a neces
sary, but not sufficient, element of being a great
player, but it is an ability that Powell has in abun
dance. Powell's versatility allows her to create any
shot she wants. The 6-foot-2 forward can post up
anyone on the block and handles the ball well
enough to play point guard. If a defender sloughs
off, Powell will bury a 3-pointer (at 48-percent clip
in the last nine games).
Reporters are having a hard time coming up
with new ways to describe how good Nicole Pow
ell is. So, in the pressroom a few weeks ago, they
asked head coach Tara VanDerveer for some
help.
"My definition of a great player is they make
others around them better," VanDerveer re
sponded. "It is different watching Nicole play this
year. She is a lot more in control of what is hap
pening on the court and more aware of her team
mates."
It's hard to believe that just a month and a half
ago, Powell, couldn't bend down to tie her own
shoelace due to a bulging disk in her back and was
uncertain if she would even play this season.
Without their Ail-American, the Cardinal sur
prised many by winning eight out of nine games,
including victories over No. 2 Kansas State and
No. 21 Arizona.
With the team playing so well in her absence,
Powell commented that she wasn't sure what her
role was going to be with the Cardinal.
As Powell regained her Ail-American form, the
rest of the team struggled to produce offensively,
culminating in a 75-72 loss at Southern California
in which Powell scored 34 points and no one else
managed more than 10.
Recently though, Powell's role on the team has
been obvious — she is the leader and go-to player.
Powell scored 23 points and hit the game-winning
basket in Stanford's first meeting against UCLA.

She carried a sluggish team to victory over Cali
fornia and scored 18 points in the second half
against USC to help Stanford overcome a 15-point
deficit. She has scored in double figures in every
game that hasn't been a blowout for her team.
When UCLA narrowed Stanford's lead six
points with eight minutes to play, Powell's ability to
create shots made the difference. She drove from
the top of the key into a wall of three defenders
and deftly spun around them fora 3-point play,
made two free throws and hit a 3-pointer to help
Stanford preserve the victory.
"She can play with anyone in the country,"
VanDerveer said after Saturday's game.
So why do Diana Taurasi from Connecticut
and Alana Beard from Duke get all the attention?
Why, two weeks after calling the Pac-10
"under-recognized," did ESPN.com proclaim
Taurasi and Beard as the leading (and essentially
only) candidates for the Wade Trophy honoring
the best women's basketball player in the country?
Statistically, Powell matches up respectably
with Taurasi and Beard despite not playing as
many minutes in her first games back from in
jury. Powell averages 16.7 points, 9.5 re
bounds, 3.6 assists toTaurasi's 16.7 points, 6.3
rebounds and 4.8 assists. Beard has a slightly
meatier stat line of 23 points, 7 rebounds and
3.4 assists.
Winning is the only thing that separates
Taurasi, Beard and Powell in their careers so far.
Taurasi has not allowed her team lose all year and
Beard led her team to the Final Four last year,
while Powell has not been past the Sweet 16 in her
two years at Stanford.
"Great players put their teams on their backs
and carry them to championships," VanDerveer
said.
Powell has already carried her team to the Pac
-10 championship and should pick up her second
Pac-10 Player of the Year Award.
So when the team lined up to cut down the net
after the championship-clinching game on Satur
day, it was fitting that it let Powell go last and re
ceive the appreciation from the crowd that she de
served.
But, to be considered in the same category as
Taurasi and Beard, Powell will have to cut down
another set of nets in March — and the fans will
roar even louder.

points with eight minutes to play, Powell's ability to
create shots made the difference. She drove from
the top of the key into a wall of three defenders
and deftly spun around them fora 3-point play,
made two free throws and hit a 3-pointer to help
Stanford preserve the victory.
"She can play with anyone in the country,"
VanDerveer said after Saturday's game.
So why do Diana Taurasi from Connecticut
and Alana Beard from Duke get all the attention?
Why, two weeks after calling the Pac-10
"under-recognized," did ESPN.com proclaim
Taurasi and Beard as the leading (and essentially
only) candidates for the Wade Trophy honoring
the best women's basketball player in the country?
Statistically, Powell matches up respectably
with Taurasi and Beard despite not playing as
many minutes in her first games back from in
jury. Powell averages 16.7 points, 9.5 re
bounds, 3.6 assists toTaurasi's 16.7 points, 6.3
rebounds and 4.8 assists. Beard has a slightly
meatier stat line of 23 points, 7 rebounds and
3.4 assists.
Winning is the only thing that separates
Taurasi, Beard and Powell in their careers so far.
Taurasi has not allowed her team lose all year and
Beard led her team to the Final Four last year,
while Powell has not been past the Sweet 16 in her
two years at Stanford.
"Great players put their teams on their backs
and carry them to championships," VanDerveer
said.
Powell has already carried her team to the Pac
-10 championship and should pick up her second
Pac-10 Player of the Year Award.
So when the team lined up to cut down the net
after the championship-clinching game on Satur
day, it was fitting that it let Powell go last and re
ceive the appreciation from the crowd that she de
served.
But, to be considered in the same category as
Taurasi and Beard, Powell will have to cut down
another set of nets in March — and the fans will
roar even louder.

Junior forward Nicole Powell has become the Pac-10's most dominant play
er and a contender for National Player of the Year, but she needs postseason
success to cement her name among college basketball's elite.
