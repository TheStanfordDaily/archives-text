Thirteen years after she was raped, Katie Koestner
still remembers the dress she was wearing on what she
describes as "the worst night of [her] life." Addressing
a crowd of approximately 300 students last night in
Kresge Auditorium, Koestner shared her experience
with date rape when she was a freshman at the Col
lege of William and Mary.
She explained that the incident occurred when she
invited a male friend into her room after a dinner
date.
Koestner said that she resisted his advances and
spent the whole night awake and scared in the dorm
room. She was raped early the next morning after the
young man assured her that she would be safe.
However, Koestner stressed that she "didn't come
to Stanford to tell a story."
"You knew the end of the story before the first
word I spoke," Koestner said.
She then asked the audience, "What would each of
you be willing to do to have one day without rape?"
Koestner emphasized the ideals of responsibility,
communication, and respect among students in a col
lege community. She advised the students that "90
percent of rape cases include drugs and / or alcohol."
"tf you didn't open the can of water yourself,
maybe you shouldn't drink it," Koestner said. "If you
put it down and don't watch it, don't pick it up again."
Students reacted positively to the event.
"I was very moved by what Katie had to say the way
she said it," said senior Naveen Kabir, the Inter-
Sorority Council president and an organizer of the
event."The talk was very engaging. You could hear a
pin drop in the audience. After the events of last quar
ter [when a Stanford student was charged with sexu
al assault], the meeting was very salient."
Koestner asserted that "I am not going to do this
[speaking] forever." She added, "I know I'm not
going to stop rape â€” I don't want your pity."
To the men, Koestner asserted, "If men like you
take a stand, other men will stand with you"
She told the women to "be strong for yourself."
