## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thirteen years after she was raped, Katie Koestner
still remembers the dress she was wearing on what she
describes as "the worst night of [her] life." Addressing
a crowd of approximately 300 students last night in
Kresge Auditorium, Koestner shared her experience
with date rape when she was a freshman at the Col
lege of William and Mary.
She explained that the incident occurred when she
invited a male friend into her room after a dinner
date.
Koestner said that she resisted his advances and
spent the whole night awake and scared in the dorm
room. She was raped early the next morning after the
young man assured her that she would be safe.
However, Koestner stressed that she "didn't come
to Stanford to tell a story."
"You knew the end of the story before the first
word I spoke," Koestner said.
She then asked the audience, "What would each of
you be willing to do to have one day without rape?"
Koestner emphasized the ideals of responsibility,
communication, and respect among students in a col
lege community. She advised the students that "90
percent of rape cases include drugs and / or alcohol."
"tf you didn't open the can of water yourself,
maybe you shouldn't drink it," Koestner said. "If you
put it down and don't watch it, don't pick it up again."
Students reacted positively to the event.
"I was very moved by what Katie had to say the way
she said it," said senior Naveen Kabir, the Inter-
Sorority Council president and an organizer of the
event."The talk was very engaging. You could hear a
pin drop in the audience. After the events of last quar
ter [when a Stanford student was charged with sexu
al assault], the meeting was very salient."
Koestner asserted that "I am not going to do this
[speaking] forever." She added, "I know I'm not
going to stop rape — I don't want your pity."
To the men, Koestner asserted, "If men like you
take a stand, other men will stand with you"
She told the women to "be strong for yourself."
Kate Koestner has been an out
spoken date-rape survivor and
sexual assault prevention advocate
since 1990. She appeared on the
June 3, 1991 cover ofTime maga
zine and in 1993 completed a pro
ject with HBO entitled "No Visible
Bruises: The Katie Koestner
Story."

Koestner has presented her
program, called "No / Yes," at over
700 colleges, high schools and mil
itary institutions in 47 states and in
ternationally. She spoke at Stan
ford four years ago.
"I haven't given much thought
to the issue before tonight," said
junior Nic Kanaan. "I have talked
about it in a hypothetical sense, but
hearing the words from a real per
son emphasized the gravity of the
problem."
He added, "She brought up is

sues that we tend to ignore into the
playing field."
The event was sponsored by a
coalition of groups including the
Inter-Fraternity Council, Inter-
Sorority Council, the Office of Stu
dent Activities, the Women's Com
munity Center and Cardinal
Council. An honorarium was
given to Koestner's foundation to
make the event possible.
Judging from student reac
tions, the planning and funding
that went into the event was worth

while.
"I have never been as touched
by a speaker at Stanford as I was by
Katie Koestner this evening," said
senior Alexandra Michalko. "I
cannot imagine the courage it
must take to revisit the experience
of date rape by talking about it in a
room full of strangers."
She added, "Rape is the least
reported crime in the country, and
speeches like Koestner's serve to
raise awareness in the community
about prevention and support."
