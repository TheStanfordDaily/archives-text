# Universities to track sex offenders
## Federal law requires registration with campus police 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
By September, sex offenders af
filiated with any college or univer
sity campus in the United States
must be registered with campus
police, in accordance with the fed
eral Campus Sex Crimes Preven
tion Act.

The act, which was passed in
2000 and went into effect on last
October, requires that local au
thorities keep a publicly accessible
list of sex offenders enrolled,
working or volunteering at a col
lege or university.
Sex offenders are already re
quired to be publicly registered
with state and county police de
partments.
The aim of the act is to create a
safer environment for college
communities.
According to the Vaden Health
Center, 20 percent of all college

women and a smaller percentage
of men are estimated to have been
raped, though the vast majority of
these assaults are carried out by
peers. Last year, seven sexual of
fense cases were reported to Stan
ford, according to the Stanford
Report.
"It's really hard to say what the
impact [of the Campus Sex Crimes
Prevention Act] will be," said Of
fice of General Counsel attorney
Jennifer Westerlind. "Some of
these laws that are well intentioned
sometimes seem to have no im
pact. It certainly is an attempt to
make people feel safer."
California was the first state to
enact legislation in compliance
with the act, and Stanford current
ly meets its requirements as well.
"Stanford has been in compli
ance with other campus security
acts for decades, and this one has
been complied with also," Wester
lind said.
Student reactions to the new
law were mixed.
"I feel safe here, but if [a list of
sex offenders on campus] were
publicly disclosed, then at least
people who wanted to be on guard
could look at it," said sophomore
Lisa Singer.
Some students questioned
whether the law will be effective.
"Awareness has shown to be an
effective way of preventing the
most heinous forms of sexual as
sault, though often times very few
people take advantage of the in
formation available to them," said
freshman John Hamilton, the
president of the Stanford Civil Lib
erties Union.

Senior Greg Packnett ques
tioned the law's ethical implica
tions.
"If police already know about
the sex offenders, I don't know if it
makes it any safer for us to know
about them as well," he said. "I
don't like the stigma the law at
taches to people."
Hamilton pointed out the im
portance of balancing the privacy
of offenders with the need to pro
tect other members of society.
"It is important to keep every
body's rights in mind in discussing
this act — the rights of those at risk
for sexual assault and the privacy
of those who have been convicted
and released," he said.
According to Westerlind, the
act was once questioned to be in
conilict with the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act.
That act protects the rights of
students and maintains that
there are only certain kinds of
directory information that a
school can disclose without per
mission.
However, the Department of
Education determined that the
new act does not violate student
rights, Westerlind said. In this
case, institutions have the right to
disclose information without the
student's consent.
