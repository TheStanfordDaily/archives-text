# Week focuses on overseas options
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid increased student interest in studying
abroad and a job market that favors international ex
perience, students explored overseas options all this
week as part of World Opportunities Week.
A joint endeavor by the Career Development
Center, Overseas Studies and the Overseas Re
source Center, the annual program consists of a
series of events designed to inform Stanford stu
dents about educational, career and internship
prospects abroad.
Today's events at the CDC include a panel at noon
on studying abroad through Stanford and a panel on
international careers in public service at 4 p.m. To
morrow there will be an information session at noon
on Child Family Health International, a public service
organization.
Kristin Conner, a career counselor at the Career
Development Center and an organizer of the pro
gram, said that World Opportunities Week has been
held for over 10 years and was developed in response
to the growing popularity of international experi
ences among University students.
" There is a strong interest among Stanford stu
dents in going abroad," Conner said, "whether for ca
reer aspirations, study or simply to travel, [or to] de
velop skills in the areas of broader cultural under
standing, communication, adaptability, flexibility and
possibly other languages."
She also stressed the increasing importance of in
ternational study in today's job market.
"If a student's goal is for an international career, he
or she will want to get started now in going abroad, as
many international career fields prefer prior abroad
experience," Conner said. "Even if a student's ulti
mate goal is not a long-term international career,
going abroad strengthens a resume and is looked
upon highly by domestic employers also."
She added, "But beyond academic or career bene
fits, many students tell me that going abroad has
changed their lives in more personal ways, seeing the
world from a different perspective."
However, studying abroad is not the only option
for students interested in gaining
international experience while in
college.
Conner said that the CDC
wants to highlight other opportu
nities during this week, since
many students are unaware of the
numerous public service
prospects overseas, which include
internships, volunteer work and
service-learning projects.
"College study abroad pro
grams are really a once-in-a-life
time opportunity" said freshman
Sarah Carroll. "I'm definitely hop
ing to study abroad my junior
year, because I think immersion in
another culture would be incredi
bly enriching.
"Bust I know some of my
friends don't think they can fit a
quarter abroad into their academ
ic careers," she continued. "These
information programs that talk
about service corps and interna
tional careers are especially help
ful for them."
