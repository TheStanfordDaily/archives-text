# Stanford Federal Credit Union endows position
## 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, the Board of
Trustees approved the Stanford
Federal Credit Union Professor
ship, making the SFCU only the
second credit union to ever endow
a professorship at a university.
Though endowed professor
ships are typically established in
honor of a person affiliated with
the University, the SFCU decided
to endow the position to commem
orate the long-standing relation
ship between the SFCU and the
University community.
"Stanford University is our pri
mary sponsor and we felt it was
time to give back to the Universi
ty," said John Davis, president and

CEOoftheSFCU.
Davis noted that the credit
union has been in business with
the University for over 40 years.
Timothy R. Warner, chair of
the SFCU and vice provost for
Budget and Auxiliaries Manage
ment, suggested the idea of en
dowing a professorship to the
SFCU board of directors. The pro
posal passed by 69 percent among
its voting members.
Davis said that the endow
ment's only stipulation was that
the position must be tilled by an in
dividual whose work would "focus
on public service and the better
ment of the community."
Although the SFCU is a fiscal
entity, its board of directors did
not specify that the professorship

has to be in a field related to the
work of the credit union.
The position will be created
within the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
"The needs of the University
were made to be known in [that
school]," Davis said.
Although Isaac Stein, chair of
the Board of Trustees, said there
is no deadline for filling the posi
tion, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Sharon Long has al
ready begun a search fora suit
able candidate.
The professorship cost the
SFCU $1.5 million dollars, along
with a $1.5 million in matching
funds from the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation.
The endowment was approved

Feb. 18 by the Board of Trustees
after the SFCU pledged an annual
$300,000 for the next two years.
Economics Prof. Avner Greif,
the Bowman Family Endowed
Professor in Humanities and Sci
ences, explained that the main
benefit of an endowed professor
ship is not necessarily financial
but rather the resulting three-way
connection between the sponsors,
the professor and the University.
"It is a vote of confidence by
the University and a nice encour
agement one can get towards
your research," Greif said of
being awarded an endowed pro
fessorship. "It provides a link be
tween the sponsor and yourself
and also exposes a different as
pect of the University."
