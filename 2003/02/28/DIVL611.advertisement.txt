tutoring, advising, and discussion leading. Ordinarily, awards are made each year to:
• A senior faculty member (associate or full professor) or a senior lecturer
• A junior faculty member or member of the teaching staff
• A teaching assistant (undergraduate or graduate student)
THE LLOYD W. DINKELSPIEL AWARDS recognize distinctive and exceptional contributions to Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford. The contribution may be made for such activities as curriculum design, program development, advising
excellence, residential education, committee leadership, or extracurricular education. Ordinarily, awards are made
each year to:
• Two graduating seniors
• A faculty or staff member with ten or more years of service to Stanford
• A faculty or staff member with less than ten years of service to Stanford
THE KENNETH M. CUTHBERTSON AWARD recognizes exceptional contributions of all types to Stanford University,
including administrative, professional, or educational. These might include unusually distinguished and continuous
service to the University, uncommon inventiveness in meeting broad institutional objectives, or exceptional creativity in
discharging a particular responsibility. Ordinarily, one award is made each year.
WHO MAY NOMINATE? Any member of the Stanford community may nominate for one or more of these awards.
Students are especially encouraged to nominate anyone who has made a special contribution to their education.
WHEN TO NOMINATE. Nominations must be received by April 1, 2003.
HOW TO NOMINATE. Write a letter to the Subcommittee on University and Departmental Honors, c/o Office of the
Registrar, Old Union Room 135, Stanford, CA 94305-3005. The letter may be brief, but to be effective must clearly
explain why the candidate is deserving of the award. In general, nomination packages consisting of multiple letters
(perhaps three to ten) and supporting documentation are most successful, but individual nominations are also most
welcome. Because of the care that normally goes into producing a nomination, they will be active for two years.
SELECTION PROCESS. Nominations are reviewed by a committee of faculty, staff, and students who may also gather
additional information from the nominees' colleagues. All Awards are presented at the University Commencement
Ceremony. A list of previous winners is available at http://registrar.stanford.edu/awards/.
