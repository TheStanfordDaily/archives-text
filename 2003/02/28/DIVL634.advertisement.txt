Wondering what the immigration issues might be?

Then this seminar is for you!
Coming To Canada
Thursday, March 6, 2002
10am - 12pm
Assembly Room • Bechtel International Centre
Over the past year the Stanford Canadian Club and the Bechtel International Centre have received numerous
questions relating to Canadian visa and immigration issues. As a way to respond to these questions, the two
organizations have invited an immigration officer from the Canadian consulate in Los Angeles to speak at
Stanford. The officer will give a short presentation and will be available afterwards to field questions.
Some of the topics that will be covered include:
• Tourist Visas
• Student Visas (Graduate/Post-Doctorate)
• Networking options with universities across Canada
• Working in Canada
• Immigration to Canada
At the end of the seminar the immigration officer will have a drawing for two tickets to that night's
hockey game between the San Jose Sharks and the Montreal Canadiens.
Questions? Contact Mohammed Badi (mbadi@stanford.edu).
Sponsored by the Stanford Canadian Club, the Bechtel International Centre, and the
Canadian Consulate in Los Angeles
