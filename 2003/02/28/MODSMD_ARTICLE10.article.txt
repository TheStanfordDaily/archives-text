# Group plans war strike
## 
### KATHERINE KELMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Coalition of Students
Against the War held a town hall
meeting in Kimball Hall yester
day night to plan a student strike
expressing opposition to the po
tential war with Iraq. The March
5 strike will coincide with similar
strikes on over 200 college and
high school campuses across the
nation and the world.
The event is coordinated by
the National Youth and Student
Peace Coalition's "Books not
Bombs" campaign. The coali
tion's press release states that the
campaign aims to "demonstrate
[students'] collective opposition to
the Bush administration's plans
fora pre-emptive, unilateral war
in Iraq and call for better-funded
and more accessible schools."
"We are reclaiming our educa
tional experience because govern
ment policies affect us directly in
terms of decreased money and re
search," said Stanford Asian Amer
ican Activism Coalition co-chair
Eric Shih, a sophomore. "Our

main goal is to show that there are
costs to the war and that, despite
the administration's efforts to dis
tance people from the war, there's
a direct effect on students."
Organizers said these effects
include decreased funding, less
money for research and a decline
in opportunities for low-income
students.
Stanford student groups par
ticipating in the strike seek to
allow a forum for students to
protest the war and its negative ef
fects on their education. Striking
students will not attend classes on
March 5, but will inform profes
sors of their participation in the
strike and ask for their support.
After receiving e-mails from
the coalition, over 50 professors
have already agreed to cancel
their classes if there is organized
faculty and student support.
Twenty-four have endorsed the
strike and eight have agreed to
cancel class.
The strike will begin at 9:30
a.m., with participants collecting
in time for the 10:00 a.m.-class
crowd. Teach-ins about the war's

effect on education, speeches
and press conferences will take
place around noon in the Main
Quad as an alternative to sched
uled classes.
Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion member Kate Raven de
scribed the strike as an "act of soli
darity with students across na
tions." She said the strike will at

tract world attention to the second
U.N. resolution to be proposed by
the U.S. and British governments,
which will be discussed in the
United Nations after March 7.
The demands of the coalition's
campaign, in addition to averting
military action in Iraq, include
