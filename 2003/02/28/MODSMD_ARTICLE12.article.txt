Director's cut of Cannes award-winning film to
premiere
The Bay Area premiere of Robert M. Young's film "Alambrista!"
will take place this Saturday at McCaw Hall in the Arrillaga Alumni
Center. The film, which translates to "The Fence Cutter" describes
the journey of a young, undocumented Mexican immigrant in the
United States.
This particular screening is the director's cut of the movie, which was
produced by History Prof. A1 Camarillo as well as Harvard Latin Amer
ican Studies Prof. David Carrasco and San Francisco State University
Raza Studies Prof. Jose Cuellar. Cuellar also contributed a new sound
track to the movie with his conjunto band, Sus Tiburones del Norte.
"This film is the centerpiece of an artistic and intellectual recovery
process that two of my colleagues and I directed over the past two years,"
Camarillo said.
The project was funded by a $240,000 grant from the Ford Founda
tion to produce the revised film and new soundtrack. A volume of orig
inal essays and a DVD of the film will be released by the University of
New Mexico Press in the fall.
The event will begin at 6:30 p.m. with a performance by Cuellar and
his band and will run until 10 p.m. Tickets are $ 10 for general admission
and $5 for students.
Computer Science chair honored
Hector Garcia-Molina, chair of the Computer Science Department,
was recently elected to the National Academy of Engineering. Such an
election is one of the highest honors that an engineer can receive and is
a recognition of exceptional accomplishments. Garcia-Molina was cited
in particular for his contributions to the field of distributed information
systems.
Garcia-Molina's election brings the number of Stanford academy
members to 82. The academy itself aims to promote technological ad
vance by coordinating the knowledge of the nation's top engineers. The
total number of members is 2,138 in the United States and 165 foreign
associates.
Battle of the Bands
What began in 1991 as a Phi Kappa Psi rush event is now a major des
tination for campus bands. The 13th Annual Phi Psi Battle of the Bands
will take place Saturday from 9 p.m to 1 a.m. in Toyon's lounge. The
event has a wide draw of concertgoers; 1,000 are expected throughout
the night.
"Many musicians have said that battle is by far their favorite show of
the year," said sophomore James Poole, Battle of the Bands XIII com
mittee chair. At no other time do so many Stanford students come to
gether with the sole purpose of enjoying and celebrating Stanford cam
pus music."
The show this year will be co-sponsored with the ASSU and the Stan
ford Concert Network. The prizes for winning bands include gift cer
tificates, KZSU live primetime airtime in mid-March and general expo
sure. The Music Department, KZSU, SCN and CRAM will all contribute
judges.
