## Lawmakers worried over image of U.S. 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senators
urged the Bush administration yesterday
to move aggressively in raising the image
of the United States abroad, particularly
among Muslim countries.
Lawmakers increasingly have become
concerned about rising anti-American
ism and say they have seen it firsthand in
their travels overseas. That has made it
difficult to win support for military action
against Iraq, and, some tear, could swell
the ranks of terrorist organizations.
At a Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee hearing on Bush administration's pub
lic diplomacy efforts, the panel's top De
mocrat, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,
said the "enormous good will and energy"
the United States received after the Sept.
11 attacks "has been squandered."
The committee's chairman, Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said "Americans
are troubled by examples of virulent
anti-American hatred in the Islamic
world and they are frustrated by public
opinion in allied countries that seems in
creasingly ready to question American
motives or blame American actions fora
host of problems."
Charlotte Beers, undersecretary of
state for public diplomacy, agreed that
the problems were great. "The gap be
tween who we are and how we wish to be
seen and how we are in fact seen, is fright
eningly wide," she said.
She cited efforts under way to boost
the U.S. image, including cultural ex
changes and television broadcasts, such
as a documentary on Muslim life in the

United States that was widely aired in the
Islamic nations.
Kenneth Tomlinson, who overseas
U.S. broadcasts overseas as chairman of
the Broadcasting Board of Governors,
said the United States' Radio Sawa net
work in the Middle East has been success
ful in attracting a young Arab audience
with its mix of music and news.
He called the planned creation of an
Arabic-language television network "the

most important public diplomacy initia
tive of our time."
But setting up the network will cost
$62 million, Tomlinson said. He said
President Bush has requested $30 billion
for the project in next year's budget.
Lugar questioned whether that could
take too long in getting the station oper
ating, and suggested it be included in a
midyear spending bill that will likely in
clude billions to fund an Iraqi war.
