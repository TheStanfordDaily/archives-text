# N. Korea starts up reactor
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —By restarting
its nuclear reactor, North Korea is sending
a message that it has the capability and is
prepared to produce plutonium fora for
midable nuclear arsenal.
But nuclear experts said yesterday the
real test is if the Koreans start up a process
ing facility next door where plutonium
would be extracted from the used fuel, or
from thousands of used fuel rods that have
been in storage since the mid-19905.
Over time, the 5-megawatt reactor at
North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex
could produce enough plutonium for three
warheads every two years, U.S. experts
said. The processing facility could separate
enough plutonium fora warhead a month
as long as plutonium were available.
"They're saying, 'Look were starting
things up . . . and we're going to produce
more plutonium,'" said David Albright,

president of the Institute for Science and
International Security, who has closely fol
lowed North Korea's nuclear weapons pro
gram over the years.
While the North Korean government
has asserted its startup of the reactor was to
produce electricity, U.S. officials — as well
as private nuclear experts — scoffed at such
claims, saying the small reactor at Yongby
on eats up as much power as it produces. A
typical commercial U.S. power reactor is
1,000 megawatts.
"The only reason to operate a reactor
like this is to produce spent fuel that can
then be turned into plutonium for
weapons," State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said yesterday.
So far, according to U.S. officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity, there is
no evidence North Korea has taken the
next step and begun processing plutonium.
