# New flight checks to be tested
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The govern
ment is getting ready to test a new risk-de
tection system that would check back
ground information and assign a threat
level to everyone who buys a ticket fora
commercial flight.
The system, ordered by Congress after
the Sept. 11 attacks, will gather much more
information on passengers. Delta Air Lines
will try it out at three unidentified airports
beginning next month, and a comprehen
sive system could be in place by the end of
the year.
Transportation officials say a contractor
will be picked soon to build the nationwide
computer system, which will check such
things as credit reports and bank account
activity and compare passenger names with
those on government watch lists.
Advocates say the system will weed out

dangerous people while ensuring law-abid
ing citizens aren't given unnecessary scruti
ny-
Critics see a potential for unconstitution
al invasions of privacy and for database
mix-ups that could lead to innocent people
being branded security risks.
There also is concern that the govern
ment is developing the system without re
vealing how information will be gathered
and how long it will be kept.
"We may be creating a massive surveil
lance system without public discussion,"
said Barry Steinhardt, an American Civil
Liberties Union director.
Transportation officials say CAPPS II —
Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening
System — will use databases that already
operate in line with privacy laws and won't
profile based on race, religion or ethnicity.
