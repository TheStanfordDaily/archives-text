## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Listening is key to peace 
### 
During the past six weeks, The
Daily has received several guest
columns and many letters con
cerning the Israel-Palestine con
flict. These submissions indicate that stu
dents are actively engaging in open debates,
just as one expects in an intellectual com
munity. But there is an essential element
missing from these exchanges: listening to
one another.
For example, when members of the
Stanford community wrote last week, they
criticized and attacked each point — no
matter how small — raised by the "other
side." By focusing on the flaws of individ
ual arguments, all failed to see the larger
picture. Neither the Israeli nor the Pales
tinian sympathizers seem to realize that
they have more in common than they
think: nearly everyone shares the desire
for peace.
It is clear that peaceful conflict resolu

tion in present-day
Israel will not be pos
sible without some
compromise on each
side. But a resolution

volved cannot accept. Furthermore, com
promise only stands a chance if people
move beyond the stage of pointing fingers.
The first step in resolving this conflict
needs to be a deconstruction of the de
bate's oppositional terminology. Essen
tially, this can only be accomplished
through a breakdown of the "we" versus
"them" mentality that invades most dis
cussions. Dismantling this divisive mental
ity means that one can no longer consider
Israeli and Palestinian goals as mutually
exclusive, a viewpoint that should be
manifested in all campus debates.
Stanford is free from the pressures of
daily life in Israel. Because of this fact, each
of us has a responsibility to redefine the con
text of this conflict and start talking about a
compromise.
Using recent guest columns and let
ters published in The Daily as a point of
analysis, one might conclude that both
critics and supporters of the Israeli
state make good claims. The members
of an academic institution have an obli
gation to learn from new information.
Personal investment in one side of a
cause does not preempt the worth of
continuing to learn about all details
surrounding it.
While continuing to listen to one an-

other, the challenge becomes "how does
one not frame the Israel-Palestine conflict
diametrically?" First, everyone can ques
tion his or her own processing of the in
formation. When you read opinions on
the Israel-Palestine conflict, does your gut
immediately and negatively react to the
comments? Or do you think, "What does
that person know or consider that I never
have?" Are you able to think "we" and in
clude the "them"?
Secondly, everyone on campus can get
involved in groups that are fostering in
teraction between Israelis and Palestini
ans in non-competitive, peaceful settings.
One does not need to be Israeli or Pales
tinian, Jewish or Muslim.
Students who do not have personal ties to
Israel or Palestine may be under the false as
sumption that the conflict in the Middle East
does not and will not affect them. As U.S. tax
payers, everyone at Stanford should have a
say in where his or

her money goes. And
as members of a glob
id community, when
and how this conflict
is resolved will affect
everyone.
Having estab

lished the impor
tance of becoming informed about and in
volved in the issues surrounding the con
flict in the Middle East, everyone should
remain open-minded in participating in
these discussions. If you are entering the
dialogue for the first time, can you enter it
and refrain from choosing sides? Can you
identify any common grounds and invent
ways to provide for their contrasting
needs?
Student groups on campus that pro
vide for such open discussions include
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice, the Muslim Student Awareness
Network and the Stanford Israel Al
liance. Part of SCPJ's mission is to "pro
mote respect and justice for people of all
races, ethnicities, nationalities, and reli
gions." Also consider MSAN, which
hopes to promote understanding of is
sues concerning Muslims and Muslim na
tions, and SIA, which stresses that peace
can be achieved while keeping the Israeli
nation intact.
In this critical time, members of the
Stanford community must support these
student groups and any others in their
endeavors to transfer the heat of the Is
raeli-Palestinian debate or the indiffer
ence of excluded voices into construc
tive, inclusive alliances.
