## Do you appreciate the arts? 
### 
All the students I've ever
talked to have felt that
the arts at Stanford are
grossly underappreciat
ed and underfunded.
While some "mainstream" art
forms — like hip-hop dance and
pop a cappella — enjoy great
popularity on campus, many
other forms of artistic expres
sion go unnoticed. Perfor
mances and exhibit showings, by
their very nature, don't draw the
large audiences that spectator
sports do. Even so, attendance is
far too low.
Where the biggest challenge
lies for the arts is in attaining cold,
hard cash. Not enough resources
exist for students of the arts, and so
not enough opportunities enable
them to explore their creativity
and talents.
Standard art classes at Stan
ford are notorious for their wait
ing lists — if you aren't an art
major, you have a tough time of
getting into Photo I or Design I.
There is just too low of a supply
and too much of a demand for
these classes.
At such a pre-professional
school, students know that the op
portunity cost of studying the arts
is high. If engineering and econ
majors criticize their peers in the
English Department for their
"worthless" major, then is there
any hope for the arts?
When virtually every depart
ment at Stanford is incredibly
strong, wouldn't it make sense to
build up our arts program? II
Yale has one of the top drama
schools in the nation, and Har
vard can attract students such as
Yo-Yo Ma, then why can't we
make our arts programs bigger
and stronger?
Fortunately, there are groups
on campus who do recognize this

problem and are doing something
about it.
An Art Affair, which will take
place in April, will bring together
great examples of student art on
campus. Hopefully this event will
raise awareness and appreciation
of the subculture of creativity that
only occasionally shows its face on
our campus.
The ASSU is in the beginning

stages of its first
big initiative for
granting re
sources to the
arts. The Arts
Grants Pro
gram will allo
cate a total of
$15,000 (a
"surplus" from

unused special fees money), to
student artists, musicians, ac
tors and dancers. Up to $1,000
will be awarded to each group
or individual.
These students must demon
strate that they will give back to the
Stanford community by working
on a project. These projects can
range from a public mural to a per
formance on campus.
ASSU President Monica Hene
stroza said that the overwhelming
number of applications to the ad
visory board alone shows the in
terest in this program and the
void that it lills. She is confident
that this program will be a success.
So keep your eye out for appli
cations and projects in the next
couple of months.
But the Arts Grants Program
cannot single-handedly amelio
rate the funding problem for the
arts. Private donorship is severely
lacking for the arts. The Athletics
Department is so strong in part be
cause of the huge amount of re
sources it possesses. These re
sources are used to build state-of

the-art facilities and to attract stu
dent athletes with partial or full
scholarships.
llie arts lack this patronage.
But some incredible individu
als have made the arts their pri
ority when donating to Stanford.
Helen and Peter Bing come to
mind immediately.
Among other things, the
Bings give money the Overseas
Studies programs, allowing stu
dents to attend cultural events
and go on field trips. While I was
at Stanford in Santiago, I went to
the ballet, the opera, Pablo Neru
da's house and cultural centers
run by the indigenous people of
Chile — all thanks to the buck of
the Bings.
There are ways that the Univer
sity can help support the arts at
Standard. Many sporting events
on campus are free with a valid
SUII), but almost all music and
drama performances charge an
admission fee. Since this is the
groups' only source of revenue, it
is understandable that they must
charge, but this wouldn't be a
problem if more University fund
ing went to the arts.
In addition, dorm sponsored
trips to art events would raise
awareness and show students the
incredible amount of talent and ef
fort put into the arts at Stanford.
The lack of support for the
arts must be addressed on cam
pus. We must increase aware
ness of the talent we possess and
make sure that resources are
available for students to use. We
must work to make our campus,
which borders on acultural at
times, to become a more creative
and expressive environment for
its students.

to? Tell me at cciccone@skmford.edu
