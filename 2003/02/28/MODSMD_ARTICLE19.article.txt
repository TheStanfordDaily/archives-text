# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Hoover's political bias acceptable 
### BENN EIFERT GUEST COLUMNIST 
This Hoover Institution battle won't
go away.
In their guest column, "Campaign
seeks to separate politics from Hoover In
stitution" (Feb. 25), Calvin Miaw and Kate
Skolnick note that one Hoover Institution
research initiative is self-described as a
scholarly effort to "ensure that mankind
will not again be tempted by the false
Utopian promises of this malignant ideolo
gy [of communism]." Miaw and Skolnick
then argue that such a research program
is as inappropriate for sponsorship within
a university-affiliated institution as a pro
communist research program.
One might, in turn, point to the Center
for Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law, which "seeks to promote in
novative and practical research to assist
developing countries and transitioning so
cieties in the design and implementation
of policies to foster democracy, to promote

balanced and sustainable growth, and to
advance the rule of law" (http://cddrl.stan
ford.edu/about/).
Moving away from views on the merits
of the different research programs — I
tend to think that the Hoover Institution's
program is of little value, but this does not
preclude its legitimacy as a research initia
tive at a university-sponsored
institution — one might be inclined to
think that Miaw and Skolnick's logic
should lead them to oppose the Center for
Democracy, Development and the Rule of
Law's affiliation with the University, on
the basis of its clear ideological support for
democracy. Scholars who profess authori
tarian or totalitarian ideologies are highly
unlikely to receive research appointments
at the center, due to its clearly and formal
ly stated institutional objectives.
Some members of the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice with whom I
have spoken respond by attempting to
draw some sort of distinction between nor
mative political support for democracy

and normative political support for com
munism, which seems to be to be prob
lematic at a basic logical level. Both are si
multaneously ideas and systems of politi
cal organization; any academic center
which actively promotes either takes a
normative stance on political ideas. Per
haps one might argue that universities
should maintain exclusively positive schol
arship, because normative scholarship im
plies supporting a set of ideas or beliefs
which are often political in nature.
However, I doubt that SCPJ would be
in favor of such a proposal, and I certain
ly am not. I approve of the fact that Stan
ford and its afliliated institutions are ac
tively involved in normative concerns, in
cluding the center's formal role in the
promotion of democracy and account
able governance worldwide. Centers and
research programs in public interest law
likewise explicitly focus on normative
concerns such as minority rights, civil
