# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Hoover's political bias acceptable 
### BENN EIFERT GUEST COLUMNIST 
This Hoover Institution battle won't
go away.
In their guest column, "Campaign
seeks to separate politics from Hoover In
stitution" (Feb. 25), Calvin Miaw and Kate
Skolnick note that one Hoover Institution
research initiative is self-described as a
scholarly effort to "ensure that mankind
will not again be tempted by the false
Utopian promises of this malignant ideolo
gy [of communism]." Miaw and Skolnick
then argue that such a research program
is as inappropriate for sponsorship within
a university-affiliated institution as a pro
communist research program.
One might, in turn, point to the Center
for Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law, which "seeks to promote in
novative and practical research to assist
developing countries and transitioning so
cieties in the design and implementation
of policies to foster democracy, to promote

balanced and sustainable growth, and to
advance the rule of law" (http://cddrl.stan
ford.edu/about/).
Moving away from views on the merits
of the different research programs — I
tend to think that the Hoover Institution's
program is of little value, but this does not
preclude its legitimacy as a research initia
tive at a university-sponsored
institution — one might be inclined to
think that Miaw and Skolnick's logic
should lead them to oppose the Center for
Democracy, Development and the Rule of
Law's affiliation with the University, on
the basis of its clear ideological support for
democracy. Scholars who profess authori
tarian or totalitarian ideologies are highly
unlikely to receive research appointments
at the center, due to its clearly and formal
ly stated institutional objectives.
Some members of the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice with whom I
have spoken respond by attempting to
draw some sort of distinction between nor
mative political support for democracy

and normative political support for com
munism, which seems to be to be prob
lematic at a basic logical level. Both are si
multaneously ideas and systems of politi
cal organization; any academic center
which actively promotes either takes a
normative stance on political ideas. Per
haps one might argue that universities
should maintain exclusively positive schol
arship, because normative scholarship im
plies supporting a set of ideas or beliefs
which are often political in nature.
However, I doubt that SCPJ would be
in favor of such a proposal, and I certain
ly am not. I approve of the fact that Stan
ford and its afliliated institutions are ac
tively involved in normative concerns, in
cluding the center's formal role in the
promotion of democracy and account
able governance worldwide. Centers and
research programs in public interest law
likewise explicitly focus on normative
concerns such as minority rights, civil
rights and human rights and are
less inclined to hire right-wing
legal scholars who oppose affir
mative action and international
human rights conventions than
scholars who better fit their stated
normative missions.
Normative concerns of this na
ture are fundamentally political.
The institution is wasting its
money trying to convince us all
that communism is dead — who's
listening that's not already con
vinced? But if we regard the basic
existence of a normative political

idea in the institution research
program as antithetical to Univer
sity-sponsored scholarship, with
out extending that logic to every
other center, institute and depart
ment on campus, then 1 see only
hypocrisy.
SCPJ's position has another sig
nificant problem. Its core argu
ment, as I understand it, is that the
institution is characterized by an in
stitutional bias towards a particular
set of political beliefs, in the form of
a set of principles written into its
mission statement, which in turn
may affect the selection of scholars.
Other University departments,
which have no such principles es
tablished in similar foundational
documents, may have various de
grees of political bias in one direc

lion or the other. But due to its
non-institutional nature, that bias
is either considered tolerable or
even acceptable. However, schol
ars who study the nature of institu
tions emphasize the duality of for
mal and informal institutions —
the former enshrined in rules and
formal structures, the second en
shrined in norms and informal re
lationships.
The presence of a rule can be
meaningless if social norms ensure
noncompliance with the rule.
Likewise, where formal institu
tional rules are absent, informal in
stitutions take their place. SCPJ's
claim that the institution is charac
terized by institutional political
bias while other academic depart
ments are not is simply not true.
What is true is that the institution
maintains a formal principle re
garding its commitment to limited
government while other academic
departments maintain no such for
mal principle.
However, the informal institu
tional bias undergirded by strong
social norms is every bit as strong,
or stronger, in other academic
departments. The likelihood that
a program like Feminist Studies
or a department like Cultural

and Social Anthropology would
hire a highly accomplished schol
ar who happened to be conserva
tive is probably on par with, or
less than, the likelihood that the
institution would hire a social sci
entist who is a registered member
of the Green Party (which, by the
way, it has).
Formal principles and state
ments are only one part of a com
plex story of institutional bias. If
SCPJ proposes that all institution
al bias in academic departments
and centers be eliminated, such an
undertaking would require a sort
of political affirmative action pro
gram in every academic depart
ment and a tight administrative
balancing act. This seems to be im
practical and undesirable.
SCPJ's arguments exhibit a
number of logical and conceptual
flaws. In the end, it would seem
that its political agenda, which in
many ways I share, drives its con
clusions about the legitimacy of the
connections between Stanford and
the institution.

plies supporting a set of ideas or beliefs
which are often political in nature.
However, I doubt that SCPJ would be
in favor of such a proposal, and I certain
ly am not. I approve of the fact that Stan
ford and its afliliated institutions are ac
tively involved in normative concerns, in
cluding the center's formal role in the
promotion of democracy and account
able governance worldwide. Centers and
research programs in public interest law
likewise explicitly focus on normative
concerns such as minority rights, civil
rights and human rights and are
less inclined to hire right-wing
legal scholars who oppose affir
mative action and international
human rights conventions than
scholars who better fit their stated
normative missions.
Normative concerns of this na
ture are fundamentally political.
The institution is wasting its
money trying to convince us all
that communism is dead — who's
listening that's not already con
vinced? But if we regard the basic
existence of a normative political

idea in the institution research
program as antithetical to Univer
sity-sponsored scholarship, with
out extending that logic to every
other center, institute and depart
ment on campus, then 1 see only
hypocrisy.
SCPJ's position has another sig
nificant problem. Its core argu
ment, as I understand it, is that the
institution is characterized by an in
stitutional bias towards a particular
set of political beliefs, in the form of
a set of principles written into its
mission statement, which in turn
may affect the selection of scholars.
Other University departments,
which have no such principles es
tablished in similar foundational
documents, may have various de
grees of political bias in one direc

lion or the other. But due to its
non-institutional nature, that bias
is either considered tolerable or
even acceptable. However, schol
ars who study the nature of institu
tions emphasize the duality of for
mal and informal institutions —
the former enshrined in rules and
formal structures, the second en
shrined in norms and informal re
lationships.
The presence of a rule can be
meaningless if social norms ensure
noncompliance with the rule.
Likewise, where formal institu
tional rules are absent, informal in
stitutions take their place. SCPJ's
claim that the institution is charac
terized by institutional political
bias while other academic depart
ments are not is simply not true.
What is true is that the institution
maintains a formal principle re
garding its commitment to limited
government while other academic
departments maintain no such for
mal principle.
However, the informal institu
tional bias undergirded by strong
social norms is every bit as strong,
or stronger, in other academic
departments. The likelihood that
a program like Feminist Studies
or a department like Cultural

and Social Anthropology would
hire a highly accomplished schol
ar who happened to be conserva
tive is probably on par with, or
less than, the likelihood that the
institution would hire a social sci
entist who is a registered member
of the Green Party (which, by the
way, it has).
Formal principles and state
ments are only one part of a com
plex story of institutional bias. If
SCPJ proposes that all institution
al bias in academic departments
and centers be eliminated, such an
undertaking would require a sort
of political affirmative action pro
gram in every academic depart
ment and a tight administrative
balancing act. This seems to be im
practical and undesirable.
SCPJ's arguments exhibit a
number of logical and conceptual
flaws. In the end, it would seem
that its political agenda, which in
many ways I share, drives its con
clusions about the legitimacy of the
connections between Stanford and
the institution.

This Hoover Institution battle won't
go away.
In their guest column, "Campaign
seeks to separate politics from Hoover In
stitution" (Feb. 25), Calvin Miaw and Kate
Skolnick note that one Hoover Institution
research initiative is self-described as a
scholarly effort to "ensure that mankind
will not again be tempted by the false
Utopian promises of this malignant ideolo
gy [of communism]." Miaw and Skolnick
then argue that such a research program
is as inappropriate for sponsorship within
a university-affiliated institution as a pro
communist research program.
One might, in turn, point to the Center
for Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law, which "seeks to promote in
novative and practical research to assist
developing countries and transitioning so
cieties in the design and implementation
of policies to foster democracy, to promote

balanced and sustainable growth, and to
advance the rule of law" (http://cddrl.stan
ford.edu/about/).
Moving away from views on the merits
of the different research programs — I
tend to think that the Hoover Institution's
program is of little value, but this does not
preclude its legitimacy as a research initia
tive at a university-sponsored
institution — one might be inclined to
think that Miaw and Skolnick's logic
should lead them to oppose the Center for
Democracy, Development and the Rule of
Law's affiliation with the University, on
the basis of its clear ideological support for
democracy. Scholars who profess authori
tarian or totalitarian ideologies are highly
unlikely to receive research appointments
at the center, due to its clearly and formal
ly stated institutional objectives.
Some members of the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice with whom I
have spoken respond by attempting to
draw some sort of distinction between nor
mative political support for democracy

and normative political support for com
munism, which seems to be to be prob
lematic at a basic logical level. Both are si
multaneously ideas and systems of politi
cal organization; any academic center
which actively promotes either takes a
normative stance on political ideas. Per
haps one might argue that universities
should maintain exclusively positive schol
arship, because normative scholarship im
plies supporting a set of ideas or beliefs
which are often political in nature.
However, I doubt that SCPJ would be
in favor of such a proposal, and I certain
ly am not. I approve of the fact that Stan
