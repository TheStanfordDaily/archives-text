Students strike in protest of war with Iraq
This letter is addressed to all Stanford
professors and graduate student instructors.
The Coalition of Students Against War
is organizing a student strike on Wednes
day, March 5, in protest of a preemptive
strike against Iraq. This one-day event,
called Hooks Not Bombs, is being coordi
nated with over 200 campuses nationwide
in conjunction with the National Youth
and Student Peace Coalition.
We are asking students to pledge not to
attend classes on March 5 and instead ed
ucate themselves at one of the many events
that we are sponsoring throughout the
day. In addition to movies, music, spoken
word and a keynote address at noon, we
are holding small teach-ins on various sub
jects related to the possible war.
We hope that you excuse your students'
absences from class on March 5, so that they
may attend the various educational events.
We also ask you to direct your teaching
and discussion to the issues surrounding a
possible war with Iraq that are relevant to
your curriculum.
Please support this nationwide effort to
engage students in this important dia

logue and educate the University c ommu
nity about the consequences of war.

'Think carefully before a
preemptive strike'
The role and place of the Hoover In
stitution at Stanford is again the subject of
vehement debate. I would like to address
two points regarding the guest column,
"Campaign seeks to separate politics
from Hoover Institution" (Feb. 25).
