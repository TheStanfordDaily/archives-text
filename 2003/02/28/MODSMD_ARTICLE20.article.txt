Students strike in protest of war with Iraq
This letter is addressed to all Stanford
professors and graduate student instructors.
The Coalition of Students Against War
is organizing a student strike on Wednes
day, March 5, in protest of a preemptive
strike against Iraq. This one-day event,
called Hooks Not Bombs, is being coordi
nated with over 200 campuses nationwide
in conjunction with the National Youth
and Student Peace Coalition.
We are asking students to pledge not to
attend classes on March 5 and instead ed
ucate themselves at one of the many events
that we are sponsoring throughout the
day. In addition to movies, music, spoken
word and a keynote address at noon, we
are holding small teach-ins on various sub
jects related to the possible war.
We hope that you excuse your students'
absences from class on March 5, so that they
may attend the various educational events.
We also ask you to direct your teaching
and discussion to the issues surrounding a
possible war with Iraq that are relevant to
your curriculum.
Please support this nationwide effort to
engage students in this important dia

logue and educate the University c ommu
nity about the consequences of war.

'Think carefully before a
preemptive strike'
The role and place of the Hoover In
stitution at Stanford is again the subject of
vehement debate. I would like to address
two points regarding the guest column,
"Campaign seeks to separate politics
from Hoover Institution" (Feb. 25).
First, I am the only member of
the Stanford community who
knew former U.S. President Her
bert Hoover. Hoover established
the Hoover Institution to study
war, revolution and peace â€” in
order to avoid the first two and
promote the third. Hoover, a
Quaker and a pacifist, viewed for
mer British Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill as a warmonger.
The irony is that Hoover is now
the target of attacks because of its
close ties with the Pentagon. Its
mission has changed.
I listen dispassionately to the
speeches of the two parties which
now monopolize (or should I say
duolize?) control of our great
country. 1 listened to a speech
given yesterday by U.S. Senator
Dianne Feinstein at the Center
for National Policy in Washing
ton, D.C. It was one of the best
speeches I have ever heard: fac
tual, well documented and deliv
ered in a statesmanlike way
(sorry: statespersonlike). My
judgment is not based on the fact

that she was critical of the Pen
tagon's policies.
My proposal is that Stanford or
ganize a debate between Feinstein,
who is a Stanford alumna, and a
representative of the Hoover
group affiliated with the Pen
tagon. Such a matchup could be
the present equivalent of the Lin
coln-Douglas debates. Slavery was
the burning issue in those days.
Now it is war or peace. Feelings
ran high then, they do now.
A historical note: Feinstein
warned against preemptive
strikes, recalling that President
George W. Bush used the expres
sion in a speech he gave at West
Point last year. It occurred to me
that the attack on Fort Sumter was
a preemptive strike. The South
followed Lincoln's speeches care
fully and decided that if he were
elected president he would attack
the South. He was elected, and the
South replied with Fort Sumter.
The moral is: Think carefully be
fore making a preemptive strike.
Beware the Ides of March.
