# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Practices of affirmative action are suspect 
### JAEWON "SAMUEL" KANG DAVID YAU GUEST COLUMNISTS 
When confronted, proponents of affir
mative action in college admissions will
usually cite one of the following three rea
sons to defend their position. First, it re
pairs the damage caused by the systematic
repression of certain groups in our na
tion's history, specifically blacks, Native
Americans and women. Second, affirma
tive action corrects for imbalances in soci
ety that unfairly privilege some individu
als over others. And third, it increases
campus diversity. Even if we believe these
are worthy justifications for affirmative ac
tion (which can be the topic of another de
bate altogether), the current implementa
tion of affirmative action is inconsistent
and only poorly realizes its goals.
In our nation's history, blacks, Native
Americans and women have suffered par
ticularly extreme cases of oppression. This
oppression has left a legacy of injustice that
still adversely affects these people today.
However, the group that should be held
accountable for undoing this legacy is the
group that was historically responsible for,
and also most benefited by, that oppres
sion.
Thus if a university decides preferen
tially to accept applicants of the above
mentioned groups, then the only people
who should have to forfeit admissions

spots are white males. Special provisions
should not be made for any other groups,
neither beneficial nor detrimental. Cur
rently, however, affirmative action helps
Chicano / Latino-American applicants
even though they cannot claim the same
level of historical maltreatment in tfie
United States that members of the other
aforementioned groups can. Conversely,
affirmative action at many colleges hurts
Asian-American applicants even though
they played no role in oppressing the
aforementioned groups.
Some assert that, in addition to the "big
three" victims of the most extreme op
pression, other groups such as Chicano /
Latino Americans should benefit from af
firmative action because they have also
been discriminated against at some point
in oui nation's history. But by this stan
dard, we should include less-publicized
groups such as applicants of Irish descent
from New England (because of the severe
anti-Irish prejudice during the 1800s), ap
plicants of Japanese descent from Califor
nia (because of internment during World
War II) and almost every applicant of Chi
nese descent (because of America's in
volvement in the Opium War). It is hypo
critical that Irish-American applicants
(whom we lump with other whites) and
Asian-American applicants are actually
hurt by affirmative action policies when
they have arguably suffered as much dis
crimination as Chino / Latino Americans.

An argument for excluding some op
pressed groups from affirmative action
programs is that these groups are no
longer perceived to be disadvantaged by
their past. Such notions outline the second
stated goal of affirmative action: helping
achieve social equity. Under this premise,
the admissions process tries to take into ac
count the fact that some applicants have
access to more educational opportunities
than others. However, to measure the
number of opportunities available to an
applicant, the best indicator is not race but
family income.
Though various forms of discrimina
tion still exist, studies show that the socioe
conomic status of a student's family is
more influential than race in attaining aca
demic success. Since this is the case, the ad
missions criteria should consider family
income and the educational background
of parents more significantly than race. In
stead, we continue to correlate opportuni
ty with the wrong factor. For instance, be
cause Asian Americans are sizably repre
sented at many universities, affirmative ac
tion places together all Asian Americans,
including poor Asian Americans who, like
poor blacks or poor Latino/Hispanic
Americans, lack educational opportuni
ties.
Finally, aside from issues of social equi
ty, many people justify race considerations
as a means of increasing campus diversity.
While this reasoning may sound nice, it

rests on a Hawed assumption. Being in a
place of higher learning, we want a diver
sity of ideas rather than of physical ap
pearances. Most students would probably
agree that while race is a decent indicator
of physical appearance, it is at best a very
loose indicator of a person's ideas. Why,
then, do proponents insist that a racially
diverse university is an intellectually di
verse community?
Suppose a university's motive is to di
versify the ideas of the student body
through varied cultural backgrounds.
Then the application process should di
rectly assess an applicant's relationship
with his or her culture through essays or
surveys. Otherwise, admissions personnel
are effectively assuming that students of
one ethnicity will have a cultural back
ground different from students of other
ethnicities. Are we to believe that third- or
fourth-generation immigrant children
who have lived in the United States since
birth, and who have almost no connection
to their cultural heritage, somehow add
diversity to a school just because they are
of a certain race? As absurd as it may seem,
universities actually endorse this logic by
touting statistics that show the size of "un
derrepresented" minorities. Is a school
truly diverse if it has students of many eth
nicities but they all share similar ideas?
A university interested in promoting di
versity needs to take into account a com
prehensive list of factors during its admis

sions process, such as an applicant's family
income, political alignment or maybe even
favorite genre of music, as well as cultural
background. Relying on race to increase
campus diversity thoughtlessly discrimi
nates against applicants for being "over
represented," even though the ideas they
may offer are underrepresented.
Last week, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate passed a resolution endorsing affir
mative action by an 11-0 vote count (one
senator abstained). While it is likely that
the senators were actually endorsing the
principles of affirmative action rather than
its practices, we cannot ignore the latter.
Although society may believe in the virtues
of diversity and social equity, race-based
admissions policies are not the best way to
achieve either.
Too often, we have knee-jerk reactions
to controversial issues like affirmative ac
tion because political correctness pervades
our consciousness; no one wants to sound
like a racist arguing against diversity or a
bigot stymieing social equity. Our hope is
that students and administrators are criti
cally examining affirmative action policies,
assessing not only principles but practices
as well.
