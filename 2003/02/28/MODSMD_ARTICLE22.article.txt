Thursday: No. 19 Stanford 88, Arizona
State 77
vs. No. 1 Arizona, Saturday, 4 p.m.

And, California lost — to the one
team Stanford didn't want it to.
The Golden Bears, who were 12-0
at Haas Pavilion before last night,
couldn't manage to pull off an upset
over No. 1 Arizona to allow the Car
dinal (and themselves) a shot at a
piece of the Pac-10 regular season
title.
"When the buzzer went off I start
ed to think about [Arizona, wonder
ing] what was going on in that game"
admitted Stanford point guard
Julius Barnes who led all scorers with
29 points in last night's matchup.
"We got to watch a little bit of the end
of it. Obviously, we were rooting for
Cal but they didn't get it done."
Ironic, isn't it? Or poetic justice
perhaps? Maybe that's what you get
cheering for Cal.
That said, the victory was an im
pressive one for Stanford, which shot
65.4 percent from the field in the
first half. The game opened in ex
plosive fashion, as Cardinal forward
Justin Davis, who finished with a

game-high 11 rebounds, scored on a
one-handed slam off a Stanford miss
to account for the game's first field
goal.
After trading baskets (and fouls)
for the opening five minutes of play,
Sun Devil guard Curtis Millage hit a
3-pointer to give ASU its first lead of
the game, which began a 7-0 Sun
Devil-run.
The Cardinal quickly countered
though. Ike Diogu was whistled for
his second foul, putting Stanford
into the bonus and junior center Joe
Kirchofer on the line. Kirchofer hit
both free throws bringing the score
to 13-16 in favor of the Sun Devils.
The free throws opened up a 14-0
Cardinal run.
"I thought the first half our de
fense wasn't as solid as it had to be to
beat a team like Stanford on the
road," said Arizona State head coach
Rob Evans. "I was not satisfied with
the way we played."
After an ASU miss, on the other
end, sophomore swingman Josh
Childress drained a 3-pointer from
the top of the key to tie the game at
16-16.
Barnes quickly followed Chil
dress' lead by hitting two consecutive
3-pointers, the second of which was
from out deep over Sun Devil guard
Kyle Dodd.
Following another ASU miss,
sophomore shooting guard Dan
Grunfeld hit an open 17-footer to
bring the score to 24-16. A Curtis
Millage drivingjump shot ended the
Cardinal run.
Despite aggressive Sun Devil


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
Senior guard Julius Barnes glides to the basket for two of his game-high 29 points despite
the efforts of Arizona State's Kyle Dodd last night. The Sun Devils had no answer for
Barnes' inside-outside attack in the Cardinal's 88-77 victory at Maples Pavilion.
man-to-man pressure, Stanford
went into the locker room at half
time up by 12 points, with the
score resting at 48-36 off 17-for
-26 shooting from the field, in
cluding 16 points from Barnes
and 12 from sophomore swing
man Josh Childress.
"Julius had another great
game and Josh chipped in too,"
Montgomery said. "The second
half they came back at us
[though]. Thank goodness we
had a little bit of a lead, a little
bit of a cushion so that we could
put it back up into double-dig
its."
In the second half, the Sun
Devils had a few opportunities to
overtake the Cardinal but never
capitalized. Stanford couldn't
seem to put ASU away as the Sun

Devils (or, more precisely, Diogu)
kept coming up with different
ways to stay in the game.
Five minutes into the second
half, Diogu completed a 3-
point-play after being fouled by
Matt Lottich. The free throw
brought the Sun Devils back
within four.
Stanford answered, however.
In the next seven minutes, the
Cardinal went on a 16-7 run,
which included 3-pointers by both
Childress and Barnes. Childress
would finish with an impressive 19
points and seven boards.
Diogu was ASU's only source
of offense during that time. He
scored all seven of the Sun Devil's
points in that stretch.
With 3:27 left to play, howev
er, Diogu was whistled for his
fifth foul while guarding Rob
Little in the post. The 6-foot-8
freshman center from Garland,
Texas was forced to leave the
game after scoring 26 points off

10-for-14 shooting from the
field.
Diogu's exit signaled the end
of ASU's run as the Sun Devils
managed only three field goals in
his absence.
"It was a win we needed,"
Montgomery said. "The kids real
ly fought. Arizona State is quick,
they're aggressive and they've got
some really good players."
All of the positive things that
Stanford did, however, can't
take away from what the night
could have been — a solid Car
dinal victory over a very good
basketball team, setting up what
would have been one of the
biggest games in Stanford histo
ry, played in front of a national
ly televised audience against the
nation's best team.
"We'll take [the win]," said a
not-so enthusiastic Montgomery.
"Now we have to get ready for
Saturday."
Saturday's tipoff against the

Wildcats is set for 4 p.m. The
game will be televised on ABC.
