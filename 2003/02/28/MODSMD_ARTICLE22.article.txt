Thursday: No. 19 Stanford 88, Arizona
State 77
vs. No. 1 Arizona, Saturday, 4 p.m.

And, California lost — to the one
team Stanford didn't want it to.
The Golden Bears, who were 12-0
at Haas Pavilion before last night,
couldn't manage to pull off an upset
over No. 1 Arizona to allow the Car
dinal (and themselves) a shot at a
piece of the Pac-10 regular season
title.
"When the buzzer went off I start
ed to think about [Arizona, wonder
ing] what was going on in that game"
admitted Stanford point guard
Julius Barnes who led all scorers with
29 points in last night's matchup.
"We got to watch a little bit of the end
of it. Obviously, we were rooting for
Cal but they didn't get it done."
Ironic, isn't it? Or poetic justice
perhaps? Maybe that's what you get
cheering for Cal.
That said, the victory was an im
pressive one for Stanford, which shot
65.4 percent from the field in the
first half. The game opened in ex
plosive fashion, as Cardinal forward
Justin Davis, who finished with a

game-high 11 rebounds, scored on a
one-handed slam off a Stanford miss
to account for the game's first field
goal.
After trading baskets (and fouls)
for the opening five minutes of play,
Sun Devil guard Curtis Millage hit a
3-pointer to give ASU its first lead of
the game, which began a 7-0 Sun
Devil-run.
The Cardinal quickly countered
though. Ike Diogu was whistled for
his second foul, putting Stanford
into the bonus and junior center Joe
Kirchofer on the line. Kirchofer hit
both free throws bringing the score
to 13-16 in favor of the Sun Devils.
The free throws opened up a 14-0
Cardinal run.
"I thought the first half our de
fense wasn't as solid as it had to be to
beat a team like Stanford on the
road," said Arizona State head coach
Rob Evans. "I was not satisfied with
the way we played."
After an ASU miss, on the other
end, sophomore swingman Josh
Childress drained a 3-pointer from
the top of the key to tie the game at
16-16.
Barnes quickly followed Chil
dress' lead by hitting two consecutive
3-pointers, the second of which was
from out deep over Sun Devil guard
Kyle Dodd.
Following another ASU miss,
sophomore shooting guard Dan
Grunfeld hit an open 17-footer to
bring the score to 24-16. A Curtis
Millage drivingjump shot ended the
Cardinal run.
Despite aggressive Sun Devil

Senior guard Julius Barnes glides to the basket for two of his game-high 29 points despite
the efforts of Arizona State's Kyle Dodd last night. The Sun Devils had no answer for
Barnes' inside-outside attack in the Cardinal's 88-77 victory at Maples Pavilion.
