For 37 minutes last night, Stanford weathered
the storm. Then, after Arizona State pulled within
six points of the lead, sophomore center Rob Little

27, 30 (points). He's a fine basketball player."
Diogu got to the free-throw line nine times, in
cluding a trio of 3-point plays.
"He baited us a couple times, getting those and-
