# As Ike goes, so go the 'Devils

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
For 37 minutes last night, Stanford weathered
the storm. Then, after Arizona State pulled within
six points of the lead, sophomore center Rob Little
drew Sun Devil center Ike Diogu's fifth foul. It was
smooth sailing the rest of the way for the Cardinal.
Prior to Diogu's foul-out, the Sun Devils had put
together an 11-4 run; after his disqualification, Stan
ford promptly went on a 12-5 run.
"We were making a pretty good run," Diogu said.
"I just made some bad decisions and they cost us."
Before fouling out, Diogu fought his way to 26
points on 10-for-14 shooting despite seeing repeat
ed double- and triple-teams.
"He's tough," Montgomery said. "I thought we
did a pretty good job considering the circum
stances."
Not so good, though, that the Cardinal didn't
make a special effort to knock Diogu out of the
game.
"Certainly when he got three fouls and four fouls,
we made an effort to go down to him," Montgomery
said. "I thought Rob's play on the fifth foul was a
great play he lifted him [up in the air] and that was
critical."
Diogu is no stranger to intense defense, and the
freshman is used to fighting through a crowd to get
his buckets.
"I wouldn't say they were any more aggressive
than any other team I've faced," Diogu said of the
defensive strategy Stanford used against him.
"Every game we've played we've seen double
and triple-teams," Arizona State head coach Rob
Evans said. "We've had some trouble making shots
outside, so people lock in on him and he still gets 26,
27, 30 (points). He's a fine basketball player."
Diogu got to the free-throw line nine times, in
cluding a trio of 3-point plays.
"He baited us a couple times, getting those and-
ones," Little said. "He's really
good at doing it and drawing
contact."
However, while Diogu filled up
the stat sheet, it was Little's work
manlike contribution that fueled
the Cardinal's victory.
Despite guarding one of the
Pac-10's best players, Little didn't
pick up his first foul until well into
the second half and played 31 min
utes â€” time on the court made all
the more important because of ju
nior forward Justin Davis' foul
trouble.
"Finally, I got to stay in a com
plete game without getting in too
terrible of foul trouble," Little said.
"It's always good to bang with a
guy your size."
Montgomery posited that the 6-
8, 250-pound Diogu was a good
matchup for the 6-10, 275-pound
Little.
"Rob's big, but Diogu's always
around the basket," Mont

gomery explained. "[Little] was
able to just stand in there. When
we put Justin on him, Diogu just
turned on him and scored over
the top of him."
Little also contributed on of
fense, throwing in several jump
hooks over Diogu. Early in the
game, before senior guard Julius
Barnes exploded for 29 points,
Stanford went to the low post on
possession after possession.
"They defended our perimeter
very well," Montgomery said. "But
we didn't force it, and [the guards]
kept their poise."
Little commanded the ball
down low, scoring eight first-half
points on 4-of-7 shooting.
"We had a talk after the UCLA
game, and [Little] told me that he
wanted the ball a little more,"
Barnes explained. "As a point
guard and a senior, I respected
that, so 1 figured it was my duty to
go down and give him the ball as
much as I could when he was
open."
Arizona State looked helpless
down low in the first half, and
Stanford converted a number of

easy looks in shooting 65 percent
from the field in the first half.
The Sun Devils also struggled
on the boards. Despite having
outrebounded 10 of its past 12
opponents by an average of 7.1
rebounds per game, Arizona
State lost the rebounding battle,
37-30.
When the teams met in
Tempe on Feb. 1, Stanford won,
58-57, and held Diogu to 16
points on 5-of-12 shooting. De
spite Diogu's improved effort
this time around, though, the
Sun Devils' defensive laxity
proved their undoing
"In the first half, our defense
was not as solid as it needed to be
for us to win on the road against a
team like Stanford," Evans said.
"We had a couple seniors who
didn't show up."
Diogu was just one of three Ari
zona State post players to foul out
in a closely officiated game during
which 52 fouls were called, one
for every 46 seconds of play.
"It was a hard-fought game,
just like we expected," Mont
gomery said.
