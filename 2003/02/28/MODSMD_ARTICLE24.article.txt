The story is starting to get a little old for the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Go play a talented team on their home floor.
Start the game shooting poorly and turn the
ball over.

Women's Basketball
Thursday: No. 9 Stanford 64, No. 24 Arizona 79
at Arizona State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Let the other team's star players get hot.
And for the third time this season, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Conference) fol
lowed this perilous trail — but came up empty
in a 79-64 loss to Arizona in Tucson.
"We had opportunities in this game," Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer said. "[But] Ari
zona played really well and was aggressive and
physical."
Stanford's four-game winning streak over
the Wildcats came to an end, while Arizona (19-
7, 12-5) won their 12th-straight home game —
the second-longest such streak in program his
tory.
The Wildcat's inside-out duo of sophomore
Dee Dee Wheeler and freshman Shawm inice
Polk killed the Cardinal for the second straight
time.
Back in late December, Wheeler and Polk
combined for 33 points in Arizona's game at
Maples.
But Polk missed a few key shots down the
stretch as Stanford was able to hold on fora 82-
74 victory.
"We let down a lot that first game," Polk said.
"I took the first loss at Stanford personally."
Boy did she ever.
So she and Wheeler one-upped themselves,
and the rest of the Wildcats were able to make
the effort stand up this time.

Sophomore Azella Perryman drives on Arizona's Krista Warren during
the second half of the Wildcats' 79-64 upset of the No. 9 Cardinal. Stan
ford closes out its Pac-10 regular season at Arizona State on Saturday.
The reigning Pac-10 freshman
of the year, Wheeler led all scorers
with 26 points, including four 3-
pointers, made all six of her free
throws and added four steals and
four rebounds.
Polk — the assured winner of
that conference award this season
— finished with her school-record
19th double-double of the season.
She scored 23 points and pulled
down 11 rebounds, and chipped
in with five blocks and three assists.
Polk's 11 rebounds gave her
283 for the season — tying her for
the single-season school record for
rebounds held by Tonee Buntin in
the early '80s.
Both junior Nicole Powell and
Chelsea Trotter finished double
doubles; Powell scored 18 points
and 10 rebounds while Trotter
had 11 points and 13 rebounds.
Kelley Suminski also added 12
points, but il wasn't nearly enough
to help overcome a disastrous
night all around.
Stanford shot 36.5 percent
from the field — including only
10-31 in the first half—for their
second-worst shooting perfor
mance of the season.
The Cardinal made only six of

22 shots from beyond the arc,
which meant 3-point gunner Seb
nem Kimyacioglu was off.
The sophomore guard, who
had 19 points in the Cardinal's
previous win over the Wildcats,
was only 2-9 from the field for 6
points.
"Our guards did an excellent
job guarding the three," Polk said.
"We worked at contesting that shot
in practice all week."
The Cardinal also turned the
ball over 20 times — one too many
for VanDerveer.
"We had too many turnovers
and made too many poor deci
sions," she said.
And it didn't help that Powell
had one of her poorest games of
the year.
Sure, she was the Cardinal's
leading scorer, but it took her 17
shots to net 18 points. (Powell went
5-for-17 from the field.) And she
fouled out for the first time this
season — meaning her aggressive
ness under the basket was causing
her more harm than providing
help.
"Nicole got defended well,"
VanDerveer said. "She put a lot of
pressure on herself.
"She's a competitor. I know
she'll bounce back against Arizona
State."
Arizona jumped out to a 28-14
lead in the in first 10 minutes as

Polk got going early. She scored 12
points in that first portion of the
first half, with an array of baseline
moves, nifty hooks and short
jumpers.
Meanwhile, Stanford started
the game 7-for-26 from the field as
Arizona built the lead to as much as
16.
The Cardinal closed within 13
by halftime, and in the first two
minutes of the second half, it
seemed like Stanford was going to
tie the game up in a hurry.
Nicole Powell made a free
throw, Susan King nailed a 3-
pointer, and Powell had a driving
layup.
All of a sudden, the Cardinal
was within seven points at 37-30.
A minute later, tragedy struck.
Powell got tangled up behind
the play and aggravated a left
ankle injury.
After she left the game, Arizona
was able to stretch its lead into dou
ble-digits again.
Powell eventually returned, but
the Cardinal could get no closer
than six points the rest of the way.
Suminski nailed a 3-pointer
with five minutes left, but Wheeler
answered back with a trey of her
own to quell the last Stanford
hopes of a rally.
The Wildcats nailed 9-of-10
free throws down the stretch to
seal the victory and balloon the

lead to 15.
Stanford will play its last regu
lar-season game of the season Sat
urday at Arizona State. From
there, it's on to the Pac-10 tourna
ment.
Hopefully it won't be the same
old road story all over again.
"A game like this will help us in
the tournament," VanDerveer
said." I hope we play Arizona again
next weekend.''

Meanwhile, Stanford started
the game 7-for-26 from the field as
Arizona built the lead to as much as
16.
The Cardinal closed within 13
by halftime, and in the first two
minutes of the second half, it
seemed like Stanford was going to
tie the game up in a hurry.
Nicole Powell made a free
throw, Susan King nailed a 3-
pointer, and Powell had a driving
layup.
All of a sudden, the Cardinal
was within seven points at 37-30.
A minute later, tragedy struck.
Powell got tangled up behind
the play and aggravated a left
ankle injury.
After she left the game, Arizona
was able to stretch its lead into dou
ble-digits again.
Powell eventually returned, but
the Cardinal could get no closer
than six points the rest of the way.
Suminski nailed a 3-pointer
with five minutes left, but Wheeler
answered back with a trey of her
own to quell the last Stanford
hopes of a rally.
The Wildcats nailed 9-of-10
free throws down the stretch to
seal the victory and balloon the

lead to 15.
Stanford will play its last regu
lar-season game of the season Sat
urday at Arizona State. From
there, it's on to the Pac-10 tourna
ment.
Hopefully it won't be the same
old road story all over again.
"A game like this will help us in
the tournament," VanDerveer
said." I hope we play Arizona again
next weekend.''

The story is starting to get a little old for the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Go play a talented team on their home floor.
Start the game shooting poorly and turn the
ball over.

Women's Basketball
Thursday: No. 9 Stanford 64, No. 24 Arizona 79
at Arizona State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Let the other team's star players get hot.
And for the third time this season, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Conference) fol
lowed this perilous trail — but came up empty
in a 79-64 loss to Arizona in Tucson.
"We had opportunities in this game," Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer said. "[But] Ari
zona played really well and was aggressive and
physical."
Stanford's four-game winning streak over
the Wildcats came to an end, while Arizona (19-
7, 12-5) won their 12th-straight home game —
the second-longest such streak in program his
tory.
The Wildcat's inside-out duo of sophomore
Dee Dee Wheeler and freshman Shawm inice
Polk killed the Cardinal for the second straight
time.
Back in late December, Wheeler and Polk
combined for 33 points in Arizona's game at
Maples.
But Polk missed a few key shots down the
stretch as Stanford was able to hold on fora 82-
74 victory.
"We let down a lot that first game," Polk said.
"I took the first loss at Stanford personally."
Boy did she ever.
So she and Wheeler one-upped themselves,
and the rest of the Wildcats were able to make
the effort stand up this time.

Sophomore Azella Perryman drives on Arizona's Krista Warren during
the second half of the Wildcats' 79-64 upset of the No. 9 Cardinal. Stan
ford closes out its Pac-10 regular season at Arizona State on Saturday.
The reigning Pac-10 freshman
of the year, Wheeler led all scorers
with 26 points, including four 3-
pointers, made all six of her free
throws and added four steals and
four rebounds.
Polk — the assured winner of
that conference award this season
— finished with her school-record
19th double-double of the season.
She scored 23 points and pulled
down 11 rebounds, and chipped
in with five blocks and three assists.
Polk's 11 rebounds gave her
283 for the season — tying her for
the single-season school record for
rebounds held by Tonee Buntin in
the early '80s.
Both junior Nicole Powell and
Chelsea Trotter finished double
doubles; Powell scored 18 points
and 10 rebounds while Trotter
had 11 points and 13 rebounds.
Kelley Suminski also added 12
points, but il wasn't nearly enough
to help overcome a disastrous
night all around.
Stanford shot 36.5 percent
from the field — including only
10-31 in the first half—for their
second-worst shooting perfor
mance of the season.
The Cardinal made only six of

22 shots from beyond the arc,
which meant 3-point gunner Seb
nem Kimyacioglu was off.
The sophomore guard, who
had 19 points in the Cardinal's
previous win over the Wildcats,
was only 2-9 from the field for 6
points.
"Our guards did an excellent
job guarding the three," Polk said.
"We worked at contesting that shot
in practice all week."
The Cardinal also turned the
ball over 20 times — one too many
for VanDerveer.
"We had too many turnovers
and made too many poor deci
sions," she said.
And it didn't help that Powell
had one of her poorest games of
the year.
Sure, she was the Cardinal's
leading scorer, but it took her 17
shots to net 18 points. (Powell went
5-for-17 from the field.) And she
fouled out for the first time this
season — meaning her aggressive
ness under the basket was causing
her more harm than providing
help.
"Nicole got defended well,"
VanDerveer said. "She put a lot of
pressure on herself.
"She's a competitor. I know
she'll bounce back against Arizona
State."
Arizona jumped out to a 28-14
lead in the in first 10 minutes as

Polk got going early. She scored 12
points in that first portion of the
first half, with an array of baseline
moves, nifty hooks and short
jumpers.
Meanwhile, Stanford started
the game 7-for-26 from the field as
Arizona built the lead to as much as
16.
The Cardinal closed within 13
by halftime, and in the first two
