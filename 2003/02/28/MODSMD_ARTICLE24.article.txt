The story is starting to get a little old for the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Go play a talented team on their home floor.
Start the game shooting poorly and turn the
ball over.

Thursday: No. 9 Stanford 64, No. 24 Arizona 79
at Arizona State, Saturday, 2 p.m.

Let the other team's star players get hot.
And for the third time this season, the No. 9
Cardinal (22-4, 14-3 Pacific-10 Conference) fol
lowed this perilous trail — but came up empty
in a 79-64 loss to Arizona in Tucson.
"We had opportunities in this game," Stan
ford coach Tara VanDerveer said. "[But] Ari
zona played really well and was aggressive and
physical."
Stanford's four-game winning streak over
the Wildcats came to an end, while Arizona (19-
7, 12-5) won their 12th-straight home game —
the second-longest such streak in program his
tory.
The Wildcat's inside-out duo of sophomore
Dee Dee Wheeler and freshman Shawm inice
Polk killed the Cardinal for the second straight
time.
Back in late December, Wheeler and Polk
combined for 33 points in Arizona's game at
Maples.
But Polk missed a few key shots down the
stretch as Stanford was able to hold on fora 82-
74 victory.
"We let down a lot that first game," Polk said.
"I took the first loss at Stanford personally."
Boy did she ever.
So she and Wheeler one-upped themselves,
and the rest of the Wildcats were able to make
the effort stand up this time.
