# Wrestling ready to take its best shot
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
If you had one shot, or one opportu
nity, to seize everything you ever want
ed — one moment — would you cap
ture it or just let it slip?
Eminem's lyrical question will be an
swered this Sunday and Monday, as the
Stanford wrestling team heads to the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships
in Boise, Idaho and the Cardinal hopes
the answer is the former rather than
the latter.
One shot. That's what a year's worth
of training and four months of grueling

Wrestung
at Pac-10 Championships in Boise, Idaho,
Sunday and Monday

competition has come down to for the
10 Stanford grapplers who will com
pete at lhe two-day, double-elimination
tournament.
"I think we're ready," coach Steve
Buddie said. "We worked very hard and
we're peaking at the right time. You ba
sic ally have to put together the best two
or three matches of your season and
you're on your way to Kansas City."
Kansas City's Kemper Arena is
home to this year's NCAA Champi

onships, to be held March 20 to 22.
Last year's squad set a high postsea
son precedent for this year's group,
qualifying four for the NCAAs. Three
of those qualifiers — sophomores Matt
Gentry and Brad Metzler and junior
Nathan Peterson — will look to make it
two straight years.
Seeds at each weight class, which are
determined mainly by a formula and fi
nalized at a coaches meeting, will be an
nounced the day before the tourna
ment. The top four finishers in each
weight class plus three wildcards quali-
fy for NCAAs.
At 125, Peterson will look to
build on his recent success, after
closing out the season by winning
live of seven dual meets and plac
ing second at the All Cal Invita
tional. The junior finished tied for
second on the team with 16 wins.
Tri-captain Brad Metzler put
together an impressive 13-3 sea
sonal 133, including a 6-1 mark in
dual meets, despite having his time
limited due to injury. Metzler and
several other Cardinal wrestlers
nursing injuries benefited from
the two-week break.
"I think our team overall is
healthy," Buddie said. "The
toughest part of these two weeks is,
you need to get guys healthy but
you also need to be training hard
er than everyone else. It's the deli
cate balance between pushing,
pushing, pushing and knowing
when to rest."
Gentry, who should garner the
No. 1 seed, is coming off a 6-4 de
cision over Fresno State's Jim
Medeiros. Last season's Pac-10
Newcomer of the Year has fol
lowed up his strong freshman
campaign with a 27-5 record to
this point, including a perfect 12-0
record in dual meet competition.
In addition to its three NCAA
veterans, the Cardinal has seven
other wrestlers with the chance to
qualify for the first time at Pac-10s.
Penson, Stanford's lone senior,
will look to close out his storied
Stanford career with an NCAA bid
at 174. Like Peterson, Penson got
hot in the second half of the season
to finish with 16 wins, including
two in his final two home meets,
and a team-leading six pins.
Qualifying would be extra spe
cial for Stanford junior Brendon

Fox and sophomore Scott Polley,
who grew up just miles away from
Kansas City in Missouri and
Kansas, respectively.
At 141, Fox will make his sec
ond postseason appearance after
closing out his season with a 5-2
decision over Fresno State's Gar
rett Spooner. The win pushed his
record to 5-12.
"It's been a weird year because I
feel like I'm a better wrestler than
my record shows me to be," Fox
said. "I don't think I'm respected
by a lot of the other wrestlers in the
Pac-10 and I can use that, in my
mind, as motivation. All it takes is
seven minutes."
Polley, who started the season
on a tear, finished with 11 wins and
two falls. He will be up against one
of the strongest weight classes in
the Pac-10 at 149.
Junior John Garfinkel, who
competed at Pac-10s last season at
165, will enter the weekend as

Stanford's representative at 184,
while sophomore Garrett John
ston makes his first postseason ap
pearance at 165.
"John was willing to go to Pac
10s wherever the team needed
him," Buddie said. "Garrett's lost a
lot of close matchups and I think
he's ready to break out any
minute."
Freshmen Larry Ozowara (197)
and heavyweight Shawn Ritzen
thaler will also get their first taste of
Pac-10 tournament competition
this Sunday. The duo combined
for 14 wins this season and Ritzen
thaler recorded three falls.
If the team's 3-12 record and in
dividual and collective triumphs
and trials haven't been thrown out
the proverbial window by now,
they will be by the time the team
hits the mat Sunday morning.
"The fun of this tournament is
that the surprise factor is just
huge," Buddie said.
