# USC back on the Farm
## Card faces early Pac-10 test 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal baseball team
owns a No. 9 national ranking. It also owns a
streak of six wins in its last seven games. And
if you look at last year's results, it owns the
Southern California Trojans.

vs. No. 16 USC, Friday 6 p.m., Saturday arid
Sunday 1 p.m.

After a 2002 campaign that saw Stanford
win a remarkable seven of eight games over
traditional rival USC, the No. 16 Trojans (5-
6) come into Sunken Diamond this weekend
fora non-conference series beginning
tonight with something to prove.
Stanford (9-6) ended the season of head
coach Mike Gillespie's squad last year at
Sunken Diamond with a Super Regional
sweep of the Trojans, putting the finishing
touches on one of the more one-sided years
in the history of the old Six-Pac rivalry.
The Cardinal won all five games that were
decided by two or fewer runs, exhibiting the
mental edge that characterized Stanford's
approach to each series with USC in 2002.
This season, however, the Trojans en
tered the year poised to regain their place

atop (he Pacific-10 Conference. Given a No.
6 preseason ranking and picked to win the
Pac-10 by coaches in January, USC hoped to
bounce back from a year that ranked as a dis
appointment in Los Angeles despite reach
ing the Super Regional round.
Of course, when you are the winner of 12
national titles â€” "more than twice as many
as any other school," as every Trojan base
hall release proudly states anything other
than finishing the year in Omaha doesn't
quite cut it.
Against a difficult early-season schedule,
ihe Trojans started the year 5-2 but have
dropped four games in a row, including a
ihree-game sweep last weekend at the hands
of No. 8 Baylor. With top starter Anthony
Reyes struggling with elbow soreness and
out for last week's and this week's series,
USC could be headed for more of the same
inconsistency that plagued the team last
year.
While the Trojans were suffering three
defeats by a combined four runs in Waco,
Texas, Stanford continued its hot stretch by
taking two of three against the defending na
tional champions, No. 6 Texas, in Austin.
Led by senior ace John Hudgins, whose
