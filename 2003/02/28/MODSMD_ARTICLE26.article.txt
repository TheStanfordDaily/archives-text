# USC back on the Farm
## Card faces early Pac-10 test 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal baseball team
owns a No. 9 national ranking. It also owns a
streak of six wins in its last seven games. And
if you look at last year's results, it owns the
Southern California Trojans.

Baseball
vs. No. 16 USC, Friday 6 p.m., Saturday arid
Sunday 1 p.m.

After a 2002 campaign that saw Stanford
win a remarkable seven of eight games over
traditional rival USC, the No. 16 Trojans (5-
6) come into Sunken Diamond this weekend
fora non-conference series beginning
tonight with something to prove.
Stanford (9-6) ended the season of head
coach Mike Gillespie's squad last year at
Sunken Diamond with a Super Regional
sweep of the Trojans, putting the finishing
touches on one of the more one-sided years
in the history of the old Six-Pac rivalry.
The Cardinal won all five games that were
decided by two or fewer runs, exhibiting the
mental edge that characterized Stanford's
approach to each series with USC in 2002.
This season, however, the Trojans en
tered the year poised to regain their place

atop (he Pacific-10 Conference. Given a No.
6 preseason ranking and picked to win the
Pac-10 by coaches in January, USC hoped to
bounce back from a year that ranked as a dis
appointment in Los Angeles despite reach
ing the Super Regional round.
Of course, when you are the winner of 12
national titles — "more than twice as many
as any other school," as every Trojan base
hall release proudly states anything other
than finishing the year in Omaha doesn't
quite cut it.
Against a difficult early-season schedule,
ihe Trojans started the year 5-2 but have
dropped four games in a row, including a
ihree-game sweep last weekend at the hands
of No. 8 Baylor. With top starter Anthony
Reyes struggling with elbow soreness and
out for last week's and this week's series,
USC could be headed for more of the same
inconsistency that plagued the team last
year.
While the Trojans were suffering three
defeats by a combined four runs in Waco,
Texas, Stanford continued its hot stretch by
taking two of three against the defending na
tional champions, No. 6 Texas, in Austin.
Led by senior ace John Hudgins, whose
astonishing 36 strikeouts against just four

Junior Carlos Quentin's scorch
ing weekend in Austin, during
which he went 8-for-12 with four
doubles, two RBI and a stolen
base, jumped his average a whop
ping .084 points to second on the
team at .370. Quentin reaches base
half the time he steps to the plate,
walking 11 times and getting hit by
the pitch four and would certainly
have better power numbers if he
actually saw more pitches over the
plate.
Aiding Quentin in leading the
Stanford offense is senior Ryan
Garko, who continues his steady
production at the plate by batting
.300 and leading the team with
four home runs and 15 RBI.
Instrumental in the Cardinal's
recent success has been head coach

Mark Marquess's decision to start
three freshmen infielders John
Mayberry Jr. at first base, Chris
Lewis at second and Jed Lowrie at
third in each of the last seven
games.
Each of the Stanford newcom
ers has made just one error in the
field, and while Lewis' struggles at
the plate may eventually drag him
out of the starting lineup, the other
two have felt right at home at the
collegiate level.
Mayberry is tied for second on
the team with two home runs and
has racked up a Stanford-leading
three triples, and Lowrie's five
doubles are second only to
Quentin on the squad.
With USC's Reyes out for
tonight's 7 p.m. contest, fans will
not get to see what could have been
yet another electric pitching
matchup at Sunken Diamond be
tween the two schools' aces.
But that doesn't mean one of
those special nights won't occur
without him. Reyes' replacement
tonight, the Trojans' Brian Ban
nister, is 2-1 with a 1.93 ERA in his
four appearances this season and

along with Hudgins could help
lull scoreboard operator Joe Ritzo
to sleep with zero after zero.
Tomorrow afternoon, senior
Ryan McCally will face off against
USC lefthander Fraser Dizard.
McCally must rebound from his
worst outing of the season in game
two of last Saturday's double
header with the Longhorns to shut
down the Trojans, while Dizard's
4.50 ERA seems ripe fora Cardinal
pounding.
Due to senior Tim Cunning
ham's hand injury, the Cardinal
starter for Sunday's series finale
remains up in the air. Cillespie will
send out lefty Bobby Paschal, who
recorded his first complete game
since 2001 in a loss last weekend at
Baylor.
With three conference games
between the two schools set for
early May, this weekend's series is
just the half of it. If at Sunken Dia
mond the Cardinal can add to its
impressive run of wins over the
Trojans that began last season,
Marquess and his team won't be
able to get down to Los Angeles
soon enough.

vs. No. 16 USC, Friday 6 p.m., Saturday arid
Sunday 1 p.m.

After a 2002 campaign that saw Stanford
win a remarkable seven of eight games over
traditional rival USC, the No. 16 Trojans (5-
6) come into Sunken Diamond this weekend
fora non-conference series beginning
tonight with something to prove.
Stanford (9-6) ended the season of head
coach Mike Gillespie's squad last year at
Sunken Diamond with a Super Regional
sweep of the Trojans, putting the finishing
touches on one of the more one-sided years
in the history of the old Six-Pac rivalry.
The Cardinal won all five games that were
decided by two or fewer runs, exhibiting the
mental edge that characterized Stanford's
approach to each series with USC in 2002.
This season, however, the Trojans en
tered the year poised to regain their place

atop (he Pacific-10 Conference. Given a No.
6 preseason ranking and picked to win the
Pac-10 by coaches in January, USC hoped to
bounce back from a year that ranked as a dis
appointment in Los Angeles despite reach
ing the Super Regional round.
Of course, when you are the winner of 12
national titles — "more than twice as many
as any other school," as every Trojan base
hall release proudly states anything other
than finishing the year in Omaha doesn't
quite cut it.
Against a difficult early-season schedule,
ihe Trojans started the year 5-2 but have
dropped four games in a row, including a
ihree-game sweep last weekend at the hands
of No. 8 Baylor. With top starter Anthony
Reyes struggling with elbow soreness and
out for last week's and this week's series,
USC could be headed for more of the same
inconsistency that plagued the team last
year.
While the Trojans were suffering three
defeats by a combined four runs in Waco,
Texas, Stanford continued its hot stretch by
taking two of three against the defending na
tional champions, No. 6 Texas, in Austin.

Senior pitcher Ryan McCally will try to shut down the Trojans in the second game of the three

Junior Carlos Quentin's scorch
ing weekend in Austin, during
which he went 8-for-12 with four
doubles, two RBI and a stolen
base, jumped his average a whop
ping .084 points to second on the
team at .370. Quentin reaches base
half the time he steps to the plate,
walking 11 times and getting hit by
the pitch four and would certainly
have better power numbers if he
actually saw more pitches over the
plate.
Aiding Quentin in leading the
Stanford offense is senior Ryan
Garko, who continues his steady
production at the plate by batting
.300 and leading the team with
four home runs and 15 RBI.
