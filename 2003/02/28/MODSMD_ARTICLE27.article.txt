the first-ever Stanford Classic
today and Saturday.

Softball
vs. No. 12 Georgia, No. 21 Texas
A&M, Long Beach State, today-Sun
day, Stanford Classic

The Cardinal was a less-than
hospitable host in the first ever
tournament held at Stanford earli
er this month, sending each team
home with at least one loss on the
way to claiming the Stanford Invi
tational title.
The Cardinal enters this week
end's play coming off of a 2-1 per
formance at last weekend's NFCA
Leadoff Classic, including a tough
1-0 loss to No. 3 Nebraska. The
strong showing nudged Stanford

up one spot in the latest USA
Today Top 25 poll.
Juniors catcher Jessica Allister
and pitcher Dana Sorensen were
named to the Leadoff Classic .All-
Tournament team.
Allister led the Cardinal of
fense, batting .429 for the week
end and racking up a double and
two RBI. Allister starred behind
the plate as well, foiling five out of
six stolen base attempts.
Sorensen shined in the circle over
the weekend, picking up the win
against North Carolina with five
strong innings. Sorensen was also
dominant in the loss to Nebraska,
pitching five perfect innings in relief
while striking out 11 Cornhuskers.
A few other top performers for
the Cardinal went unrecognized.
Freshman shortstop Lauren Lap
pin has batted .457 in the young
season. Senior pitcher Tori Ny
berg leads the staff with seven wins
and has only one walk in 45 in-

nings pitched.
The Cardinal will get more op
portunities to excel against this
weekend's competition: Long
Beach State, No. 12 Georgia and
No. 21 Texas A&M.
While it is the only unranked
team in the field, Long Beach State
(6-5) is well-tested against interna
tional competition, having twice
beaten the Canadian national
team in a tournament earlier this
month.
Lauren Johnson and Lindsey
Knoff will be the top threats from
the 49ers. Johnson has accumulat
ed a .412 batter average with three
home runs.
Knoff leads the pitching stall
with a 5-2 mark, including six
complete games and three
shutouts.
49ers coach Pete Manarino will
be looking to collect his 700 th ca
reer win at the Classic.
Georgia brings a gaudy 18-1
record to the West Coast, but is just
1-1 in its two games against ranked
competition.
The Cardinal will have to con
tend with Georgia's talented lead
off-hitter Nicole Barber, who is
batting .477 for the season with 31
hits and 23 runs scored.
The Bulldogs also bring with
them a duo of talented hurlers.
Lacey Gardner and Michelle
Green own ERAs of 0.18 and 0.28,
respectively and have combined
fora 17-1 record.
The only meeting in the teams'
history came at the 2000 Fiesta
Bowl Tournament with Stanford
defeating Georgia 8-3.
Texas A&M (12-6) rounds out
the field. The Aggies are 10-1 at
home this year but have not en
joyed similar success on the road,
going only 2-5.
A&M is led by senior catcher Se
lena Collins. Collins hits at a .378
clip, with six home runs and 16
RBI.
The Aggies' staff ace, junior Jes
sica Slataper, brings a 1.60 ERA
into the tournament. Slataper has
struck out 67 batters in only 57 in
nings pitched.
The Classic opens with Long
Beach squaring off against A&M at
11 a.m.
The Cardinal will compete in
back-to-back games against the
49ers and Georgia beginning at
3:30. Stanford then faces Texas
A&M at 1:15 on Saturday.
The teams begin elimination
play later Saturday afternoon, and
the Classic will conclude with a
consolation and a championship
game on Sunday.
