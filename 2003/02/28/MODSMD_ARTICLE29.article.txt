"Arizona hasn't lost at home yet, but this is our last
Pac-10 matchup," sophomore Mandy Delgado said.
"We are ready to take the show on the road and prove
that we can be a great team anytime and any place."
With the postseason just around the corner, the
road trip will be a good indicator of what's to come for
Stanford at regionals and NCAAs.
"Arizona is a strong team, getting healthier and can
put one of their top teams out on the floor against us,"
coach Kristen Smyth said. "The way the rankings are
lining up, we may face them again at regionals, so this
weekend will be a good test."
Leading the Cardinal's charge in Tucson are ju
niors Lise Leveille and Lindsay Wing. Leveille per
forms on all four events every weekend for Stanford.
Her career-high 39.725 against No. 4 Arizona State
has garnered her a No. 5 national ranking in the all
around.
Wing is ranked second on the balance beam with
an average of 9.943, but her consistency gives her a
chance to pull the top rank out from under UCLA's
Kate Richardson over the seven meets so far this sea
son, Wing has scored two 9.975 sand three 9.95s on
the apparatus. Stanford is also enjoying the luxury
this season of a healthy roster, letting Smyth take full
advantage of the squad's depth on every event and
ensure that everyone gets experience as the back-to
back nights of nationals approach.
"Before the home stretch, we're trying to rest peo
ple and get everyone involved," Smyth said. "We in
corporated Jessica Louie and Glyn Sweets on floor last
week and we're getting more depth on bars with
Kendall Beck practicing her routine."
As Stanford looks to collect a win on the road, Ari
zona will be fighting back, having last beaten the Car
dinal in Tucson in 1999. Last year, Stanford won the
dual meet against Arizona, but the Wildcats came
roaring back to finish second while Stanford took
third at the 2002 Pac-lOs.
Stanford is coming off a huge meet against Arizona
State, which saw the Cardinal rewrite its record book,

posting new all-time top performances as a team on
the vaulting table and balance beam. But there
are still a few notches to be made, especially on the
floor exercise, and the Cardinal hopes to improve its
No. 18 ranking on the apparatus tonight with a show
stopping set of routines.
"We need to focus on the things in our control, and
we especially want to start and end strong on the
road," Smyth said. "If we do everything in our power,
I believe we can compete against anyone in the coun
try.
"We've had a great workout this week with new
found energy, and I'm looking for the team to carry
that over to Arizona."
