# Rally calls attention to queer marriage
## QSSPA celebrates weddings and educates campus on gay rights issues 
### JULIE LEIN 
Four couples walking down the aisle,
wedding cake, I lie Stanford Band and a
large group of spectators marked die
first annual "Stanford Freedom to
Marry Rally," held yesterday at noon in
White Plaza. Sponsored by the Queer
Straight Social Political Alliance, the
rally was intended to raise campus
awareness of political discrimination
against queer people.
"One of the main purposes of this sym
bolic ceremony is to eradicate many of the
misconceptions floating around about
queer marriage" said senior Jesse Evans,
one of die coordinators of die event.
"Hawaii did not legalize same-sex mar
riage. Civil union is not the same as mar
riage. And domestic partnership pre

eludes many legal rights."
Between tlie wedding ceremonies,
spectators could read informational
lliers, sign a nationwide petition and lis
ten to a personal speech by QSSPA speak
er Charlie Rose. Rose discussed his own
dream to wed and have a family. Unfor
tunately, he noted, same sex-marriage is
recognized in only two countries — the
Netherlands and Belgium.
In 1996, Congress passed the Defense
of Marriage Act, confining the legal defi
nition of marriage to a union between a
man and woman.
There are 28 states that explicitly pro
hibit marriage of any two people of the
same sex. Similar legislation is pending in
six more states.
Currently, Vermont is the only state
where civil union, or marriage without
the license, is permitted between indi
viduals of the same sex. A civil union
does not carry over to other states, and
it is legally distinct from marriage,
which grants couples special status
under federal law.

"It's a large and pervasive social in
justice," said junior Noah Perez, a spec
tator at the rally. "Queer people are the
last minority group that haven't re
ceived full legal rights in the eyes of the
government."
In March 2000, California passed
Proposition 22, narrowing the definition
of marriage to exclude same sex couples.
AB 1338, a proposal to grant civil unions
to same sex partners, was tabled in Janu
ary 2002.
There are a handful of prospects for
expanding queer rights, with cases pend
ing in Massachusetts and New Jersey for
the constitutional right to marry. As of
now, California residents are given the
option to pay and register as domestic
partners. Although denied the many
benefits of legal marriage, partnership
confers recognition and possibilities of
adoption.
I lannah Leslie, of QSSPA, admitted

However, she said thai it is rele

the Stanford community.
"If the state of California legal
ized marriage regardless of the
gender of the participants, Stan

ford would no longer need a sepa
rate policy of domestic partner
benefits for partners of faculty and
staff," she said. "The current poli
cy, though a model for other insti
tutions, falls short of the full equal
ity the law would provide, and
adds complications for those con
sidering teaching here."
More wedding festivities were
held later yesterday evening in
