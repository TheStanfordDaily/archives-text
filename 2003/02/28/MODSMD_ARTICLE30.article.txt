The No. 9 men's volleyball team
has split matches with its oppo
nents for three straight weekends.
The last time the Cardinal came
away with a sweep of wins was the
weekend of Jan. 31, when it
squared off against Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Stanford (8-8,6-(i Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) hopes to
come away with another sweep
when it faces the same two teams,
No. 6 Northridge (11-5,7-4 MPSF)
on Friday at 7 p.m. and No. 14
UCSB (5-12, 2-9 MPSF) on Satur
day at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

"We need to be prepared to play
another tough couple of matches
and sustain that high level of en
thusiasm that we had against Irvine
last week," coach Hon Shaw said.
"We weren't able to sustain that the
next night against UCLA. It was an
embarrassing night. We're going to
try to redeem ourselves and play
better this weekend."
Stanford's early-season victories
over the Matadors and the Gau
chos came with senior Ail-Ameri
can opposite hitter Curt Toppel.
This time, however, the Cardinal

will have to rely on other offensive
weapons, as Toppel remains side
lined with an abdominal strain.
The Cardinal's win over UCSB
was a hotly contested match that
took five games and lasted almost
three hours. Two yellow cards were
tossed over the course of the match,
one in the direction ofShaw.
"UCSB is a team that as the sea
son gets into the second half now,
the pressure's on them to win some
matches," Shaw said. "[They need
to win | so they can get back into the
hunt for the playoffs. Right now
they're out of the top eight, so
they're going to l>e fired up."
UCSB currently sits in l()th
