# Volleyball hoping for clean sweep

### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 men's volleyball team
has split matches with its oppo
nents for three straight weekends.
The last time the Cardinal came
away with a sweep of wins was the
weekend of Jan. 31, when it
squared off against Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Stanford (8-8,6-(i Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) hopes to
come away with another sweep
when it faces the same two teams,
No. 6 Northridge (11-5,7-4 MPSF)
on Friday at 7 p.m. and No. 14
UCSB (5-12, 2-9 MPSF) on Satur
day at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

vs. UC-Sanla Barbara, today, 7 p.m.
vs. Cal State Northridge, Saturday, 8
p.m.

"We need to be prepared to play
another tough couple of matches
and sustain that high level of en
thusiasm that we had against Irvine
last week," coach Hon Shaw said.
"We weren't able to sustain that the
next night against UCLA. It was an
embarrassing night. We're going to
try to redeem ourselves and play
better this weekend."
Stanford's early-season victories
over the Matadors and the Gau
chos came with senior Ail-Ameri
can opposite hitter Curt Toppel.
This time, however, the Cardinal

will have to rely on other offensive
weapons, as Toppel remains side
lined with an abdominal strain.
The Cardinal's win over UCSB
was a hotly contested match that
took five games and lasted almost
three hours. Two yellow cards were
tossed over the course of the match,
one in the direction ofShaw.
"UCSB is a team that as the sea
son gets into the second half now,
the pressure's on them to win some
matches," Shaw said. "[They need
to win | so they can get back into the
hunt for the playoffs. Right now
they're out of the top eight, so
they're going to l>e fired up."
UCSB currently sits in l()th
place, while the Cardinal is seventh
and Northridge is fourth.
"We need to limit the amount of
unforced errors we make and make
[UCSB] earn all the points," Shaw
said. " They have a tendency to be a
little erratic so what we want to be
able to do is maintain our consisten
cy through that, so when they're hot
they're not gaining any ground on
us and when they're not, we're tak
ing advantage of the situation."
The Cardinal will not have to
deal with an extremely dominant
hitter against the Gauchos as they
will have to on Saturday against the
Matadors.

Northridge features senior mid
dle blocker joe Nargi, who lit up
the Cardinal for 28 kills the last time
the two teams faced off .
"He's carrying a lot of the load
for them," Shaw said. "We did a de
cent job of kind of containing him
down there, but we're going to
have to do a good job of slowing
him down. It seems that the match
es they've won, he's had big match
es. When they've struggled, he
hasn't done quite as well.''
Stanford must show up with its
best defensive effort against Nargi if
it hopes to stay in the match.
"Northridge has been playing
very well," Shaw said. "They've got
some huge wins. I would imagine
they're playing a lot better now
[than earlier in the season], so I just
expect a very tough team."
