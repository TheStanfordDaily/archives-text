# Study finds taste gene
## Stanford researchers discover gene responsible for tasting bitter foods 
### ANN CHIN 
Researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center have recently dis
covered the gene responsible for
detecting a bitter-tasting chemical
known as phenylthoicarbamide, or
PTC. Their findings may help to
explain some people's natural dis
like of certain "bitter" foods such as
broccoli and brussel sprouts.
Sensitivity to the taste of PTC,
which has long been used to study
population genetics in high school
and college science classes, is "one
of the oldest and most studied
traits in humans," said Genetics
and Statistics Prof. Neil Risch.
Last May, Risch and other Stan
ford researchers began collaborat
ing with the University of Utah,
the National Institutes of Health
and the National Institute for
Deafness and Communicative Dis
orders to study people's ability to
taste the bitter flavor of PTC.
Previous research has shown
that variations within the taste
genes of chromosome seven allow
some people, classified as tasters,
to detect the bitterness of the
chemical while others, nontasters,

are unable to experience the sen
sation. Risch's team recently iden
tified a specific gene with a varia
tion that is strongly linked to tast
ing ability.
The gene explains "60 percent
to 70 percent of variability be
tween people," Risch said.
It has at least five different
forms, but the various levels of sen
sitivity to taste are linked to three
specific forms — AVI, PAV and
AAV — depending on the se
quence of amino acids. People
who inherit two copies of AVI
genes, one from each parent, are
nontasters. Those who inherit two
PAV genes, however, are extreme
ly sensitive to the bitter taste. Peo
ple who inherit AVI / PAV or AAV
/ PAV pairings are less sensitive
but still able to detect the PTC
while those who inherit the
AVI/AAV combination are gen
erally nontasters.
The study also confirmed that
Caucasians had all three variations
of the PTC gene, Asians had only
the AVI or PAV variations and
nearly all Native Americans had
the PAV / PAV gene combination,
making them particularly sensitive
to the PIC taste. African Ameri
cans contained some variations
not found in other populations,
which parallels some beliefs that
diversity is greatest in Africa be
cause early humans migrated

from Africa to the rest of the world.
Other implications of the re
search include explanations for
human behaviors such as diet.
Some researchers have suggested
a link between a person's ability to
taste PTC and food intake, ulti
mately affecting health.
In earlier studies, those who
were able to detect PTC were less
inclined to consume broccoli,
grapefruit juice and fatty foods.
Older women in particular tended
to be more sensitive to sweet and
spicy foods. Overall, tasters were

generally thinner and had higher
levels of HDL, or "good choles
terol."
In both samples of this study,
age had no effect on the ability to
taste. In one sample, however, re
searchers found that women may
be more sensitive than men to the
bitter chemical.
Though the direct effects of the
PTC gene on human behavior re
main uncertain, these new find
ings provide a basis for future
studies on taste or smell with the
use of genetic markers.
