# Students prepare for Zimbo psych sign-ups
## 
### JANICE SANCHEZ 
Of all the high-demand classes
at Stanford, Introduction to Psy
chology with infamous Psycholo
gy Prof. Philip Zimbardo never
fails to fill quickly — and with en
rollment for spring quarter
capped at 285 students, the
Coursework Weh site will be busy
at 9 a.m. on Monday when sign
ups open.
In his 35 years at the Farm, Zim
bardo has become a campus leg
end — not only because of his role
in the notorious Stanford Prison
Experiment or because his silver
car bearing the license plate
"ZIMB()" is the < >nly one parked in
the Inner Quad, but also because
of the success of his Psych 1 class.
Zimbardo said that the class
usually fills up after 20 minutes.
"For 45 years I've been teach
ing it, so I know how to do it,"
Zimbardo said.
As the course grew in popular
ity over the years, it moved to
Cubberley Auditorium, then to
kresge Auditorium and finally to

Memorial Auditorium.
"Those rooms aren't meant for
teaching, they're for performance,"
Zimbardo said. "My teaching is inti
mate, up close and personal." Now,
the class is regularly held in room
040 of Jordan Hall.
This year's class may be more
popular than usual because Zim
bardo did not teach Psych 1 last
year. I le is coming off a one-year
sabbatical in which he served as
president of the American Psy
chological Association.
Junior Nathalie Cassidy de
scribed Psych 1 as her favorite
class so far at Stanford.
"[Zimbardo] teaches the class
to get people excited about it."
Some people take the course
because of Zimbardo's recogni
tion in the field of social psycholo
gy — or, as Cassidy said, to dis
cover "what it is that makes him so
arrogant." Cassidy, however,
praised Zimbardo's approach to
teaching the "broader, real-life
application of what psych is all
about" through engaging lec

Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo has taught Stanford students for 35
years. This spring marks his return to Introduction to Psychology after a
one-year sabbatical during which he served as president of the APA.
tures.
According to former teaching
assistant Michael Osofsky, a se
nior, "Zimbardo's class has re
quired early sign-ups for many
years due to the hype and demand
surrounding the course."
"Psych 1 with Zimbardo was the
best class I've taken at Stanford —
Zimbardo is an amazing lecturer,
and his classes are always an acad
emic 'tour de force.' "
Osofsky explained that the vari
ous Psych 1 professors each offer a
different classroom environment.
"The three professors this
year — Zimbardo, [Assoc. Psy
chology Prof. James] Gross and
[Asst. Psychology Prof. Brian]
Knutson — offer entirely differ
ent classroom perspectives," he
said. "Each professor comes from
a different area of specialization."
Because Psych 1 is taught each
quarter, the material and broad
topics are similar, and all classes
have guest lecturers. However,
Zimbardo gives a few different lec
tures on topics like "the psycholo
gy of evil" and "shyness."
"The students come in expect
ing the world from Zimbardo and
most rave about (he class in evalu
ations and discussions" Osofsky
said. Zimbardo incorporates the
unexpected into his course, and in
the past has brought in the Stan
ford Band and the Dollies.
According to Osofsky, "There may
lx' a few skeptics, but there is a reason
why his class remains one of the most
popular ones taught at Stanford."
Asked about Psych l's in
creased popularity, Zimbardo
said, "I work very hard to make it
the most memorable experience
that students have during their
four years at Stanford."
Zimbardo feels that students'
perceptions of him range from
being funny and liberal to weird
and like a task master. The stu
dents' expectations about himself
and the course "are exceeded and
confounded in every way," Zim
bardo said.
When asked what he had in
store for the students this quarter,
he jokingly replied, "A lot of very
hard work ... since I have been
awav fora year."
