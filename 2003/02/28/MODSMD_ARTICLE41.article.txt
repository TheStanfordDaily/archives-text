# Ferrell, Vaughn provide old-school laughs

"Old School" feels a lot like "Revenge of
the Nerds" remade in Bizarro world. Of
course you remember that '80s cult classic
about hi-tech parity raids and memo

rable characters like Ogre and
Booger. However, "Old X
School" reverses these roles,
envisioning the once-mighty
lrat guys as underdog heroes
and the stepped-on nerds as vil
lains. The result is a movie with
a predictable plot, flat charac
ters and cheap dialogue. Yet

Old School
Dir. Todd Phillips
★★★☆☆ I

Phillips has created also happens to be a
quite enjoyable low-brow comedy that ef
fectively uses its actors' comedic talents to
their full potential.
The premise is simple: Mitch Martin
(Luke Wilson) comes home to find his girl
friend cheating on him. He moves out and
rents a large house that just so happens to lie
within a college campus. To keep his house,
he and his friends (Will Ferrell and Vince
Vaughn) decide to start an unofficial frater
nity. While the plot sounds a bit far-fetched
(and it is), Phillips knows this and never at
tempts to make his thoroughly low-brow

movie into high art.
As Phillips also knows from his previous
film (2000's "Road Trip"), these kinds of
movies only work if you have quality comedic

actors in them. Luckily, "Old
i School" boasts some of the best.
Will Ferrell delivers a terrific

performance as Frank, the embodi

ment of drunken stupor. Fer
rell is one of those comic dy
namos that live and breathe as if
they inhabit some other planet,
operating with different rules
than the rest of us. The hilarity
that ensues from his antics is
memorable, to say the least.

Luke Wilson is perfectly deadpan as Mitch,
and Vince Vaughn reaches deep within him
self to pull out a performance that recalls his
"Swingers" roots. The appeal of all these ac
tors and the extremely improbable stunts they
pull offset the film's lesser qualities.
The deficiencies are numerable: The
story lines that Phillips and co-writer Scot
Armstrong attempt to weave are uninterest
ing. The romance that evolves between Wil
son and Ellen Pompeo (from "Moonlight
Mile") seems forced and out of place in a
movie like this. Also, the film tries to include
a parallel subplot between Ferrell's charac-

ter and his new wife that just doesn't work.
In fact, it begins with Frank's marriage,
which fails so quickly you have to wonder
why he decided to marry in the first place.
Only when Phillips returns to the core story
of an alternative frat house does the movie
have anv sense of cohesion.

Despite (or because of) its ignorance of
old-fashioned storytelling, "Old School" isn't
the type of movie that you'd expect to win
Oscars. What you do get are moments of
pure laughter that make you feel kind of
guilty for having chuckled in the first place.
In that respect, "Old School" succeeds.


Will Ferrell learns to date the Stanford way.
