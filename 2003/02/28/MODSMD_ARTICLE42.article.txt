"The Life of David Gale" pro
vides something for everyone.
Bring a date if she's into watching
repeated (and explicit) footage of
death by asphyxiation via a plastic
bag, duct tape and a pair of hand
cuffs. Bring your roommate if he
enjoys talking with you late into
the night about the evils of the
death penalty. Bring a Texan if
she starts whooping too loudly at
any mention of Texas to notice
that Texas is portrayed as a collec
tion of unpaved roads, greasy din
ers, pony-tailed lawyers with ap
pallingly bad teeth and prisons
brimming with the condemned.
Otherwise, bring your computer,
so you can enjoy a game of Snood
midway through the movie, like
the man sitting next to me.
Fora while, Kevin Spacey's new
film fools you into believing that he
is not rehashing the same tired fluff
we have seen in "K-PAX," "Fay il
Forward" and"The Shipping
News." In "David Gale," Spacey
plays the title role of a charismatic
professor, devoted father and tire
less anti-death penalty advocate.
Will we see a return of the sharp
edged leading man who won Os
cars for " Fhe Usual Suspects" and
"American Beauty?" I had hope as
I watched Gale down Scotch like a
fiend and entertain partygoers
with bawdy (bawdy!) rhymes be

fore retiring to a secluded bath
room for an underwear-shredding
sink ride with a very unlikely phi
losophy grad student.
But then director Alan Parker
abruptly jumps to a breakfast
meeting between a hung-over
Gale and his fellow anti-death
penalty advocate and academic
colleague Constance Harraway,
played by Laura Linney. The

harsh lighting of this scene re
minds us that we're watching a
flashback sequence narrated by
Gale from Death Row, where he is
awaiting execution for the rape
and murder of Constance. Gale is
relating all of this information to
the reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate
Winslet with an ill-fitting pea coat
and an even more ill-fitting Amer
ican accent). Oh, and there's also

an annoying goa
teed intern who
smokes, wears
tweed blazers with
jeans, and reads
phil osophy for
breakfast, as well as
a mysterious cow
boy who listens to

The Life of David
Gale
Dir. Alan Parker
itit'.'T

opera and a lawyer who could
shuck oysters with his teeth. Did I
mention that the reporter's name
is Bitsey?
Following this morning prep-

meeting with Harraway, Gale

locks horns with a crude
caricature of George W.
Bush in a televised de
bate on the death penal
ty. Once and for all, we
realize that "David Gale"
not only has a message,
but actually IS the mes

sage. My hope fora return of a
Spacey character without some
world-saving agenda proved to be
misplaced.
If you want to save time and
money, go to the "Life of David
Gale" Web site and read Alan
Parker's treatise, "The Death
Penalty — The Political Argu
ment." Parker and screenwriter
Charles Randolph mold the film
to fit this viewpoint, an effort that
becomes increasingly strained as
the movie progresses. Looking to
be engrossed in a story, the audi
ence is instead hammered by a
theme that always seems to over
ride the action on screen. Instead
of being moved or at least chal
lenged by the story and the mes
sage, I left the theater simply un
settled by the gratuitous footage
of Harraway's death. The nature
of Harraway's awful end has little
to do with the death penalty de
bate. But it is the easiest way for
Parker to engender the revulsion
he hopes we associate with state
sanctioned execution.
David Gale himself may or may
not be innocent, but "The Life of
David Gale" deserves a lethal in
jection.
