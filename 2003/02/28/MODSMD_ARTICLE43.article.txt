# Battle Of the Bands
## 
### JENNIE KIM KARAN MAHAJAN 
Lock your doors, keep the kids at home — the Battle of the Bands is back. Co-sponsored by the
gentlemen of Phi Kappa 1'si, the Stanford Concert Network and the ASSU, the event is expected
to draw about 1,000 music-lovers to the Toyon lounge on Saturday night. For those of you unfa
miliar with the battle, it showcases some of the best student bands at Stanford competing for the
historic honor of victory, along with primetime airplay on KZSU and maybe a random gilt cer
tificate or two. Members of the concert network, KZSU and the Music Department will judge
which of the five half-hour sets is the best.
But, above all, what these five bands will get from performing at Battle of the Bands is expo
sure. Intermission is always eager to expose — read on to learn more about the musicians who've
clawed their way to the top of the college band heap this year.
13th Annual Battle of the Bands
9-11 p.m. (competition begins at 9:45), Toyon Lounge

David Baron, '06 Vocals I Piano
Ben Grant, '06 Drums
Gabe Davis, '06 Bass
Intermission: Give us some background on
how you started the band.
David: Well, I got into Stanford, and 1 was
really excited.
Int: Not that much background.
David: Gabe lives in my hall — we both live
in Cedro — and Gabe played with Ben in a
jazz combo. The three of us just sounded
good together, and it worked.
Int: How to describe your sound?
Gabe: Good.
Int: We were thinking of your genre.
David: You can't label our music! We're our
own sound. There arc many elements to the
David Baron Element!
Ben: Do NOT put that in the article.
David: No, that was a complete cliche. Why
don't we just say that we don't come from
any influences. We are completely vacu
umess in our sound.
Gabe: Vacuumess? That's not a word.
David: I'm so pissed, I'm just gonna make
up words!
Int: What the hell is "vacuumess?"
David: Seriously, I would say, we're piano
based rock with funk and jazz elements.
Ben: Yeah, a solid funky rhythm section
with a nice musical theatre voice over it.
Int: Who are some of your favorite musi
cians?
Gabe: I'd say Flea — he's a funky bitch.
Ben: Definitely Carter Beauford, then
Bonzo(a.k.a.)John Bonham, from Led Zep
pelin.
Gabe: Why do you call him Bonzo?
Ben: That's what you call him, if you love
him. The Bonz.

Gabe: Oh.
David: Should I not say Dave Matthews?
OK, Billy Joel, then Dave Matthews.
Int: What do you guys shoot for lyrically?
David: As far as the lyrics are concerned, I
try to remain, I don't know, 1 guess the word
would be "derivative"? Is that a bad word?
Int: That's a terrible word. Derivative from
what?
David: Derivative from the influences we
named — everything from Springsteen to
Dave.
Int: Oh, that's better. Give us a sample lyric.
David: They're Springsteenish. A good
opening line is "Carve it in stone / And take
a look at what you've found / Redemption
and the sound / of more than just screaming
out loud."
Ben: That IS a good line.
Gabe: Wait, what song is that?
David: They have no idea what the lyrics
are. They never hear them in the back.
Int: Are you considering careers in music?
Gabe: I'd most definitely want to be a musi

cian. If I'm poor, that's fine.
Ben: It's a possible option, but not an easy
one. If I could do it and get rich, for sure!
David: Honestly, I didn't expect to start a
band at all the first quarter of freshman year.
And I didn't expect to be the fuckin' luckiest
guy in the world playing with Gabe and Ben.
Really. I mean, Gabe is one sexy bitch.
Gabe: Ben's a gentle giant.
Int: Awwww. What do you expect to get
from Battle of the Bands?
David: It's more exciting to not have huge
expections, and, you know, whatever hap
pens happens. And so far it's been really
good, the things that are happening. Basi
cally, we want so many people to hear us.
Gabe: Yeah, we've got a message! We've
gotta deliver it.
Ben: Yeah, maybe now would be a good
time fora shout-out to the social reps of all
the campus houses: We're available to hire.
Int: Hey, do you want to talk shit about any
of the other bands?
Gabe: I've had sex with all their moms.

Carlos Cabrera, '06 Drums
David Corcoran,'o6 Electric guitar
Donald Diaz, '06 Bass
Zach Katagiri, '05 Lead vocals I
Acoustic guitar
Intermission: So how did you kids meet?
Zach' We all lived in Burbank, that's the
main reason we got together.
Int: Where did the name come from?
Carlos : Zach always wanted to play in a
band called "Lesser Known."
Zach: This is true. I was driving around back
in Portland with one of my friends, and we
were just brainstorming band names, and I
thought "Lesser Known" would be cool.
Int: And you could maintain your indie
credibility with that name.
Zach: Yeah, even when we go mainstream.
Even after the sellouts.
Int: Who are some of your major influ
ences?
David: Oh man, we come from very differ
ent musical backgrounds. Lots of youthful
pop punk, lots of classical guitar.
Carlos: I listen to jazz, instrumental stuff. I
listen to Rush sometimes, Dream Theatre.
Donald: And some classic rock bands like
Led Zeppelin, stuff like that.
Int: If you were a rock critic, how would you
describe your sound?
Zach: Acoustic alternative rock. But I think
we may have created a new genre.
Int: Really? What would it be called?
Zach: I .esser Known, epitomized by the
band with the same name!

David: It would be called progressive
acoustic alternative modern rock — that
sounds about right.
Int: What are the themes you explore in
your lyrics?
Zach: Anti-cop. I don't know, I guess basic
adolescent angst.
David: Well, not too angsty, but definitely
youthful themes.
Int: Hit us up with some semi-angsty lyrics.
Zach: One I like is out of "Stillborn Prayers,"
it goes, "I got a broken light bulb in my hand
/1 got no plan / And I got no purpose for
today." I wrote it when I was a lot younger,
and I was trying to decide how much I want
ed to concentrate on music. And I decided
that in a lot of ways playing music was kind

of like a broken light bulb, like it sounds like
a good idea, but in terms of being a success
ful person, it's not going to get you where
you want to go.
Int: Are the rest of you planning to pursue a
music career after Stanford?
Carlos: I would love to drop out and play
the drums all the time. But 1 don't think I
will.
David: Yeah, we've gotta bow to the will of
reality. Which is kind of sad.
Int: What are you hoping to get from Battle
of the Bands?
Donald: Well, it's definitely going to be a
start. No matter what happens, it'll be our
first big appearance together.
David: I want to win!

Dan Mark, '03 Guitar/ Vocals
Alex Moore, '05 Lead Guitar
Dianna Ferrand, '05 Bass
Chris Chan, '05 Drums
Intermission: How did you get together?
Dan: We started playing together last year. We all
lived in Burbank together. We started playing in
the Burbank basement for like months and
months, annoying the hell out of people. That
was really fun. We had a bass player last year, but
he left after he graduated, so we got Dianna at the
beginning of this year.
Int: What are your performances like?
Dan: We reaHy try to put on a good show. W r e
jump around, do our little rock star antics.
Alex: Our whole thing is like, if we don't think a
song isn't going to emotionally affect the crowd or
get them physically excited, then we just don't
want to play it.
Int: Who are your influences?
Dan: Bands that I've been listening to recently:
Finch, Chevelle, Heart. Recently I've had that
song by The Used stuck in my head nonstop —
"Burn Myself Alive." That's been playing nonstop
in my MP3 player.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Alex: Modern alternative rock.
Dan: With emo and punk influences.
Int: So, do you wear matching outfits or what?
Dan: We were wearing matching lingerie at our
last show .. .no ...
Alex: Sometimes we do a theme, like farm ani
mals or something like that. Like I'll dress up like
a cow, and Dan will be the pig.
Dan: No, I'm the cow!

Alex: Actually, our band is a conglomeration of na
tionwide finalists of the Sexiest Guy Competition.
Dan: Except Dianna.
Alex : Except Dianna, who won the Sexiest Girl
Competition.
Dan: (Quoting "Zoolander") There's got to be
something in life other than being incredibly
good looking. (Does "the Magnum.")
Int: HA. What about your sound is different?
Alex: I think it's the songwriting, the lyrical struc
turing.
Dan: I've been listening to a lot of emo and punk
recently, and a lot of times I like the music, but
the lyrics are like: "I'm walking down the
streeeeet / and I see this girl / and she doesn't
like meeee / so I'm gonna try and not / whine too
much tonight."
Alex: Our stuff is listenable, and there's usually
some profound emotional content but without
being cheesy. Mainstream right now is either
hard and screaming or it's really cheesy and real
ly pop. We're kind of in between.
Dan: I kind of feel like I want to bring some in
telligence to this genre, not that there isn't any,
but I'm just saying that I think that people who
listen to this kind of music would appreciate
something that's a little deeper sometimes.
Alex: If you read our lyrics from some of our
songs, it kind of reads like a little poem.
Int: What's one representative line?
Dan: "Back down / you're on the floor / Give out
a sound / that spreads around the room." That's
one of the opening lines for one of the songs we're
going to be playing at Battle of the Bands.

Mike Albanese, '05 Guitar I Vocals
Eric Furtado, '05 Trumpet
Jordi Mata-Fink, '05 Violin I Bass
Matt Shulman, '05 Drums
Mike Solomon, '05 Piano I Vocals
Paul Wilkins, '05 Trumpet
Intermission: I low'd you get together?
Mike A: We all lived in Freshman /
Sophomore College last year. First. Mike
and I realized that we were both from
New Jersey and we both played instru
ments. Then we just found each other.
Int: Where does your name mean?
Mike A: It's kind of contrived because
Exit 9 is the exit on the New Jersey turn
pike that you'd take to get to either my or
Mike Solomon's house but in opposite
directions.
Int: How would you guys describe your
music?
Mike A: On the album we made it says,
"Adult Contemporary."
Paul: The guy we were recording with
said we could be on a country music
label. But I guess we would start with
rock, which is a pretty broad descriptor,
then a little bit of swing influence, a little
bit of Latin.
Int: Who are some of your influences?
Mike A: If you listen to Mike play ever,
you're going to hear Billy Joel.
Jordi: Billy Joel and Jellyfish. You know
the band Jellyfish?
Int: No ... sounds exciting.
Jordi: Jellyfish is this funk-ish, '70s-ish
band. One time Mike S. wrote a song
and then later realized it was an almost
exact copy of a Jellyfish song he heard.
Int: What are your shows like?
Mike A: Jordi played a whole gig

dressed in a towel. One time we did a
strip tease. I can't guarantee that Jordi
won't be naked for the whole gig. I'm not
comfortable guaranteeing that.
Int: Do your lyrics reflect this craziness?
Mike A: We have a problem writing seri
ous songs. The first silly song we wrote I
think was "Your Mom." So the song's all
about having sex with my mom. It's pret
ty funny.
Int: Have you played it for your mom?
Mike A: Uh, no.
Jordi: We have more than our share of
girl-named songs.
Paul: And most of them are not particu
larly positive.
Mike A: Not because we have that many
girl troubles, just because it's funny.
Paul: A funny title we have for one of our
girl-related songs is "2-16." Mike S.
wrote it, and we asked, "Why '2-16?'" He
said, "because it's Valentine's Day."
Int: That's so typical.
Paul: We couldn't change it after that.
Int: Do any of you plan to pursue a ca

reer in music?
Mike A: No, no, two more years — that's
a long time to just have fun.
Paul: When we have our reunion tour,
we'll let you know.
Mike A: We can have our rise and then
our fall. We'll do a VHI "Behind the
Scenes."
Jordi: We've got to start having our drug
problem now.
Int: Why are you playing Battle of
Bands?
Jordi: I don't know if you get anything
from winning, do you?
Mike A: A pizza party!
Jordi: We want to get our name out
there, but there are people who know us.
Mike A: Mostly our friends.
Paul: This is probably the largest audi
ence we'll have played for.
Jordi: We hope that this year we can
come through and really rock on with
our strap-ons on.
Int: "Rock on with our strap-ons on."
We can't wait.

Jonathan Beard, '03 Lead vocals I
Keyboard
Mike Alfred, '03 Guitar
Adam Fong, '02 Bass I Vocals
Dee Savery, '05 Drums I Vocals
Intermission: What's your history?
Jonathan: The band consisted of all differ
ent people up until this year. Now we've all
been together for about a month. Every
one's been changing, but we're pretty sure
that this is the solid lineup.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a little bit of soul.
Jonathan: A lot of soul.
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a lot of soul.
Jonathan: That's beautiful
Mike: I just came up with that right now.
Jonathan: That could be our new catch
phrase.
Int: What are your performances like?
Jonathan: Well, Mike is always naked.
Dee: It's fresh and new, and a lot of people
aren't doing it right now. It's not your typ
ical college band. We're having fun. We just
love playing.
Mike: All the solos are completely impro
vised. There isn't a set structure.
Int: Do you play originals mostly?
Jonathan : We play largely our own music.

We play a few choice covers once in a while:
a little Stevie Wonder, some classic rock.
Int: Who are your influences?
Jonathan: I'd say Stevie Wonder, Prince,
Billy Joel and the Police.
Mike: I like Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page.
Int: C you give us a good representative
lyric or two?
Jonathan: One that gets stuck in everyone's
head is "I'm young / I'm strong / My hair
used to be red, but now it's brown" from
"Rescue Me." A line that applies to all of us
is "Nothing in common except for all of
that."
Mike: Yeah, I'd say that Jonathan brings us

all together. He comes to us with an idea,
and we say, "Great, let's do it." so, it
wouldn't happen without you, man (mo
tions toward Jonathan).
Jonathan: Aww.
Int: Why are yoti guys excited to play Bat
tle of the Bands?
Dee: I just really want to play. We aren't
going into this like, "I want to win," al
though that would be really sweet. I just
hope that people enjoy it.
Adam: Battle of the Bands is an interesting
gig because the audience tends to listen
more than in normal shows. They get more
into it, it's really fun.



They're hoping to be more known after Battle of the Bands

Jordi: We've got to start having our drug
problem now.
Int: Why are you playing Battle of
Bands?
Jordi: I don't know if you get anything
from winning, do you?
Mike A: A pizza party!
Jordi: We want to get our name out
there, but there are people who know us.
Mike A: Mostly our friends.
Paul: This is probably the largest audi
ence we'll have played for.
Jordi: We hope that this year we can
come through and really rock on with
our strap-ons on.
Int: "Rock on with our strap-ons on."
We can't wait.

Jonathan Beard, '03 Lead vocals I
Keyboard
Mike Alfred, '03 Guitar
Adam Fong, '02 Bass I Vocals
Dee Savery, '05 Drums I Vocals
Intermission: What's your history?
Jonathan: The band consisted of all differ
ent people up until this year. Now we've all
been together for about a month. Every
one's been changing, but we're pretty sure
that this is the solid lineup.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a little bit of soul.
Jonathan: A lot of soul.
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a lot of soul.
Jonathan: That's beautiful
Mike: I just came up with that right now.
Jonathan: That could be our new catch
phrase.
Int: What are your performances like?
Jonathan: Well, Mike is always naked.
Dee: It's fresh and new, and a lot of people
aren't doing it right now. It's not your typ
ical college band. We're having fun. We just
love playing.
Mike: All the solos are completely impro
vised. There isn't a set structure.
Int: Do you play originals mostly?
Jonathan : We play largely our own music.

We play a few choice covers once in a while:
a little Stevie Wonder, some classic rock.
Int: Who are your influences?
Jonathan: I'd say Stevie Wonder, Prince,
Billy Joel and the Police.
Mike: I like Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page.
Int: C you give us a good representative
lyric or two?
Jonathan: One that gets stuck in everyone's
head is "I'm young / I'm strong / My hair
used to be red, but now it's brown" from
"Rescue Me." A line that applies to all of us
is "Nothing in common except for all of
that."
Mike: Yeah, I'd say that Jonathan brings us

all together. He comes to us with an idea,
and we say, "Great, let's do it." so, it
wouldn't happen without you, man (mo
tions toward Jonathan).
Jonathan: Aww.
Int: Why are yoti guys excited to play Bat
tle of the Bands?
Dee: I just really want to play. We aren't
going into this like, "I want to win," al
though that would be really sweet. I just
hope that people enjoy it.
Adam: Battle of the Bands is an interesting
gig because the audience tends to listen
more than in normal shows. They get more
into it, it's really fun.



They're hoping to be more known after Battle of the Bands



You can't see them in this photo, but they all have their strap-ons on.

Lock your doors, keep the kids at home — the Battle of the Bands is back. Co-sponsored by the
gentlemen of Phi Kappa 1'si, the Stanford Concert Network and the ASSU, the event is expected
to draw about 1,000 music-lovers to the Toyon lounge on Saturday night. For those of you unfa
miliar with the battle, it showcases some of the best student bands at Stanford competing for the
historic honor of victory, along with primetime airplay on KZSU and maybe a random gilt cer
tificate or two. Members of the concert network, KZSU and the Music Department will judge
which of the five half-hour sets is the best.
But, above all, what these five bands will get from performing at Battle of the Bands is expo
sure. Intermission is always eager to expose — read on to learn more about the musicians who've
clawed their way to the top of the college band heap this year.
13th Annual Battle of the Bands
9-11 p.m. (competition begins at 9:45), Toyon Lounge

David Baron, '06 Vocals I Piano
Ben Grant, '06 Drums
Gabe Davis, '06 Bass
Intermission: Give us some background on
how you started the band.
David: Well, I got into Stanford, and 1 was
really excited.
Int: Not that much background.
David: Gabe lives in my hall — we both live
in Cedro — and Gabe played with Ben in a
jazz combo. The three of us just sounded
good together, and it worked.
Int: How to describe your sound?
Gabe: Good.
Int: We were thinking of your genre.
David: You can't label our music! We're our
own sound. There arc many elements to the
David Baron Element!
Ben: Do NOT put that in the article.
David: No, that was a complete cliche. Why
don't we just say that we don't come from
any influences. We are completely vacu
umess in our sound.
Gabe: Vacuumess? That's not a word.
David: I'm so pissed, I'm just gonna make
up words!
Int: What the hell is "vacuumess?"
David: Seriously, I would say, we're piano
based rock with funk and jazz elements.
Ben: Yeah, a solid funky rhythm section
with a nice musical theatre voice over it.
Int: Who are some of your favorite musi
cians?
Gabe: I'd say Flea — he's a funky bitch.
Ben: Definitely Carter Beauford, then
Bonzo(a.k.a.)John Bonham, from Led Zep
pelin.
Gabe: Why do you call him Bonzo?
Ben: That's what you call him, if you love
him. The Bonz.

Gabe: Oh.
David: Should I not say Dave Matthews?
OK, Billy Joel, then Dave Matthews.
Int: What do you guys shoot for lyrically?
David: As far as the lyrics are concerned, I
try to remain, I don't know, 1 guess the word
would be "derivative"? Is that a bad word?
Int: That's a terrible word. Derivative from
what?
David: Derivative from the influences we
named — everything from Springsteen to
Dave.
Int: Oh, that's better. Give us a sample lyric.
David: They're Springsteenish. A good
opening line is "Carve it in stone / And take
a look at what you've found / Redemption
and the sound / of more than just screaming
out loud."
Ben: That IS a good line.
Gabe: Wait, what song is that?
David: They have no idea what the lyrics
are. They never hear them in the back.
Int: Are you considering careers in music?
Gabe: I'd most definitely want to be a musi

cian. If I'm poor, that's fine.
Ben: It's a possible option, but not an easy
one. If I could do it and get rich, for sure!
David: Honestly, I didn't expect to start a
band at all the first quarter of freshman year.
And I didn't expect to be the fuckin' luckiest
guy in the world playing with Gabe and Ben.
Really. I mean, Gabe is one sexy bitch.
Gabe: Ben's a gentle giant.
Int: Awwww. What do you expect to get
from Battle of the Bands?
David: It's more exciting to not have huge
expections, and, you know, whatever hap
pens happens. And so far it's been really
good, the things that are happening. Basi
cally, we want so many people to hear us.
Gabe: Yeah, we've got a message! We've
gotta deliver it.
Ben: Yeah, maybe now would be a good
time fora shout-out to the social reps of all
the campus houses: We're available to hire.
Int: Hey, do you want to talk shit about any
of the other bands?
Gabe: I've had sex with all their moms.

Carlos Cabrera, '06 Drums
David Corcoran,'o6 Electric guitar
Donald Diaz, '06 Bass
Zach Katagiri, '05 Lead vocals I
Acoustic guitar
Intermission: So how did you kids meet?
Zach' We all lived in Burbank, that's the
main reason we got together.
Int: Where did the name come from?
Carlos : Zach always wanted to play in a
band called "Lesser Known."
Zach: This is true. I was driving around back
in Portland with one of my friends, and we
were just brainstorming band names, and I
thought "Lesser Known" would be cool.
Int: And you could maintain your indie
credibility with that name.
Zach: Yeah, even when we go mainstream.
Even after the sellouts.
Int: Who are some of your major influ
ences?
David: Oh man, we come from very differ
ent musical backgrounds. Lots of youthful
pop punk, lots of classical guitar.
Carlos: I listen to jazz, instrumental stuff. I
listen to Rush sometimes, Dream Theatre.
Donald: And some classic rock bands like
Led Zeppelin, stuff like that.
Int: If you were a rock critic, how would you
describe your sound?
Zach: Acoustic alternative rock. But I think
we may have created a new genre.
Int: Really? What would it be called?
Zach: I .esser Known, epitomized by the
band with the same name!

David: It would be called progressive
acoustic alternative modern rock — that
sounds about right.
Int: What are the themes you explore in
your lyrics?
Zach: Anti-cop. I don't know, I guess basic
adolescent angst.
David: Well, not too angsty, but definitely
youthful themes.
Int: Hit us up with some semi-angsty lyrics.
Zach: One I like is out of "Stillborn Prayers,"
it goes, "I got a broken light bulb in my hand
/1 got no plan / And I got no purpose for
today." I wrote it when I was a lot younger,
and I was trying to decide how much I want
ed to concentrate on music. And I decided
that in a lot of ways playing music was kind

of like a broken light bulb, like it sounds like
a good idea, but in terms of being a success
ful person, it's not going to get you where
you want to go.
Int: Are the rest of you planning to pursue a
music career after Stanford?
Carlos: I would love to drop out and play
the drums all the time. But 1 don't think I
will.
David: Yeah, we've gotta bow to the will of
reality. Which is kind of sad.
Int: What are you hoping to get from Battle
of the Bands?
Donald: Well, it's definitely going to be a
start. No matter what happens, it'll be our
first big appearance together.
David: I want to win!

Dan Mark, '03 Guitar/ Vocals
Alex Moore, '05 Lead Guitar
Dianna Ferrand, '05 Bass
Chris Chan, '05 Drums
Intermission: How did you get together?
Dan: We started playing together last year. We all
lived in Burbank together. We started playing in
the Burbank basement for like months and
months, annoying the hell out of people. That
was really fun. We had a bass player last year, but
he left after he graduated, so we got Dianna at the
beginning of this year.
Int: What are your performances like?
Dan: We reaHy try to put on a good show. W r e
jump around, do our little rock star antics.
Alex: Our whole thing is like, if we don't think a
song isn't going to emotionally affect the crowd or
get them physically excited, then we just don't
want to play it.
Int: Who are your influences?
Dan: Bands that I've been listening to recently:
Finch, Chevelle, Heart. Recently I've had that
song by The Used stuck in my head nonstop —
"Burn Myself Alive." That's been playing nonstop
in my MP3 player.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Alex: Modern alternative rock.
Dan: With emo and punk influences.
Int: So, do you wear matching outfits or what?
Dan: We were wearing matching lingerie at our
last show .. .no ...
Alex: Sometimes we do a theme, like farm ani
mals or something like that. Like I'll dress up like
a cow, and Dan will be the pig.
Dan: No, I'm the cow!

Alex: Actually, our band is a conglomeration of na
tionwide finalists of the Sexiest Guy Competition.
Dan: Except Dianna.
Alex : Except Dianna, who won the Sexiest Girl
Competition.
Dan: (Quoting "Zoolander") There's got to be
something in life other than being incredibly
good looking. (Does "the Magnum.")
Int: HA. What about your sound is different?
Alex: I think it's the songwriting, the lyrical struc
turing.
Dan: I've been listening to a lot of emo and punk
recently, and a lot of times I like the music, but
the lyrics are like: "I'm walking down the
streeeeet / and I see this girl / and she doesn't
like meeee / so I'm gonna try and not / whine too
much tonight."
Alex: Our stuff is listenable, and there's usually
some profound emotional content but without
being cheesy. Mainstream right now is either
hard and screaming or it's really cheesy and real
ly pop. We're kind of in between.
Dan: I kind of feel like I want to bring some in
telligence to this genre, not that there isn't any,
but I'm just saying that I think that people who
listen to this kind of music would appreciate
something that's a little deeper sometimes.
Alex: If you read our lyrics from some of our
songs, it kind of reads like a little poem.
Int: What's one representative line?
Dan: "Back down / you're on the floor / Give out
a sound / that spreads around the room." That's
one of the opening lines for one of the songs we're
going to be playing at Battle of the Bands.

Mike Albanese, '05 Guitar I Vocals
Eric Furtado, '05 Trumpet
Jordi Mata-Fink, '05 Violin I Bass
Matt Shulman, '05 Drums
Mike Solomon, '05 Piano I Vocals
Paul Wilkins, '05 Trumpet
Intermission: I low'd you get together?
Mike A: We all lived in Freshman /
Sophomore College last year. First. Mike
and I realized that we were both from
New Jersey and we both played instru
ments. Then we just found each other.
Int: Where does your name mean?
Mike A: It's kind of contrived because
Exit 9 is the exit on the New Jersey turn
pike that you'd take to get to either my or
Mike Solomon's house but in opposite
directions.
Int: How would you guys describe your
music?
Mike A: On the album we made it says,
"Adult Contemporary."
Paul: The guy we were recording with
said we could be on a country music
label. But I guess we would start with
rock, which is a pretty broad descriptor,
then a little bit of swing influence, a little
bit of Latin.
Int: Who are some of your influences?
Mike A: If you listen to Mike play ever,
you're going to hear Billy Joel.
Jordi: Billy Joel and Jellyfish. You know
the band Jellyfish?
Int: No ... sounds exciting.
Jordi: Jellyfish is this funk-ish, '70s-ish
band. One time Mike S. wrote a song
and then later realized it was an almost
exact copy of a Jellyfish song he heard.
Int: What are your shows like?
Mike A: Jordi played a whole gig

dressed in a towel. One time we did a
strip tease. I can't guarantee that Jordi
won't be naked for the whole gig. I'm not
comfortable guaranteeing that.
Int: Do your lyrics reflect this craziness?
Mike A: We have a problem writing seri
ous songs. The first silly song we wrote I
think was "Your Mom." So the song's all
about having sex with my mom. It's pret
ty funny.
Int: Have you played it for your mom?
Mike A: Uh, no.
Jordi: We have more than our share of
girl-named songs.
Paul: And most of them are not particu
larly positive.
Mike A: Not because we have that many
girl troubles, just because it's funny.
Paul: A funny title we have for one of our
girl-related songs is "2-16." Mike S.
wrote it, and we asked, "Why '2-16?'" He
said, "because it's Valentine's Day."
Int: That's so typical.
Paul: We couldn't change it after that.
Int: Do any of you plan to pursue a ca

reer in music?
Mike A: No, no, two more years — that's
a long time to just have fun.
Paul: When we have our reunion tour,
we'll let you know.
Mike A: We can have our rise and then
our fall. We'll do a VHI "Behind the
Scenes."
Jordi: We've got to start having our drug
problem now.
Int: Why are you playing Battle of
Bands?
Jordi: I don't know if you get anything
from winning, do you?
Mike A: A pizza party!
Jordi: We want to get our name out
there, but there are people who know us.
Mike A: Mostly our friends.
Paul: This is probably the largest audi
ence we'll have played for.
Jordi: We hope that this year we can
come through and really rock on with
our strap-ons on.
Int: "Rock on with our strap-ons on."
We can't wait.

one of the opening lines for one of the songs we're
going to be playing at Battle of the Bands.

Mike Albanese, '05 Guitar I Vocals
Eric Furtado, '05 Trumpet
Jordi Mata-Fink, '05 Violin I Bass
Matt Shulman, '05 Drums
Mike Solomon, '05 Piano I Vocals
Paul Wilkins, '05 Trumpet
Intermission: I low'd you get together?
Mike A: We all lived in Freshman /
Sophomore College last year. First. Mike
and I realized that we were both from
New Jersey and we both played instru
ments. Then we just found each other.
Int: Where does your name mean?
Mike A: It's kind of contrived because
Exit 9 is the exit on the New Jersey turn
pike that you'd take to get to either my or
Mike Solomon's house but in opposite
directions.
Int: How would you guys describe your
music?
Mike A: On the album we made it says,
"Adult Contemporary."
Paul: The guy we were recording with
said we could be on a country music
label. But I guess we would start with
rock, which is a pretty broad descriptor,
then a little bit of swing influence, a little
bit of Latin.
Int: Who are some of your influences?
Mike A: If you listen to Mike play ever,
you're going to hear Billy Joel.
Jordi: Billy Joel and Jellyfish. You know
the band Jellyfish?
Int: No ... sounds exciting.
Jordi: Jellyfish is this funk-ish, '70s-ish
band. One time Mike S. wrote a song
and then later realized it was an almost
exact copy of a Jellyfish song he heard.
Int: What are your shows like?
Mike A: Jordi played a whole gig

dressed in a towel. One time we did a
strip tease. I can't guarantee that Jordi
won't be naked for the whole gig. I'm not
comfortable guaranteeing that.
Int: Do your lyrics reflect this craziness?
Mike A: We have a problem writing seri
ous songs. The first silly song we wrote I
think was "Your Mom." So the song's all
about having sex with my mom. It's pret
ty funny.
Int: Have you played it for your mom?
Mike A: Uh, no.
Jordi: We have more than our share of
girl-named songs.
Paul: And most of them are not particu
larly positive.
Mike A: Not because we have that many
girl troubles, just because it's funny.
Paul: A funny title we have for one of our
girl-related songs is "2-16." Mike S.
wrote it, and we asked, "Why '2-16?'" He
said, "because it's Valentine's Day."
Int: That's so typical.
Paul: We couldn't change it after that.
Int: Do any of you plan to pursue a ca

reer in music?
Mike A: No, no, two more years — that's
a long time to just have fun.
Paul: When we have our reunion tour,
we'll let you know.
Mike A: We can have our rise and then
our fall. We'll do a VHI "Behind the
Scenes."
Jordi: We've got to start having our drug
problem now.
Int: Why are you playing Battle of
Bands?
Jordi: I don't know if you get anything
from winning, do you?
Mike A: A pizza party!
Jordi: We want to get our name out
there, but there are people who know us.
Mike A: Mostly our friends.
Paul: This is probably the largest audi
ence we'll have played for.
Jordi: We hope that this year we can
come through and really rock on with
our strap-ons on.
Int: "Rock on with our strap-ons on."
We can't wait.

Jonathan Beard, '03 Lead vocals I
Keyboard
Mike Alfred, '03 Guitar
Adam Fong, '02 Bass I Vocals
Dee Savery, '05 Drums I Vocals
Intermission: What's your history?
Jonathan: The band consisted of all differ
ent people up until this year. Now we've all
been together for about a month. Every
one's been changing, but we're pretty sure
that this is the solid lineup.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a little bit of soul.
Jonathan: A lot of soul.
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a lot of soul.
Jonathan: That's beautiful
Mike: I just came up with that right now.
Jonathan: That could be our new catch
phrase.
Int: What are your performances like?
Jonathan: Well, Mike is always naked.
Dee: It's fresh and new, and a lot of people
aren't doing it right now. It's not your typ
ical college band. We're having fun. We just
love playing.
Mike: All the solos are completely impro
vised. There isn't a set structure.
Int: Do you play originals mostly?
Jonathan : We play largely our own music.

We play a few choice covers once in a while:
a little Stevie Wonder, some classic rock.
Int: Who are your influences?
Jonathan: I'd say Stevie Wonder, Prince,
Billy Joel and the Police.
Mike: I like Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page.
Int: C you give us a good representative
lyric or two?
Jonathan: One that gets stuck in everyone's
head is "I'm young / I'm strong / My hair
used to be red, but now it's brown" from
"Rescue Me." A line that applies to all of us
is "Nothing in common except for all of
that."
Mike: Yeah, I'd say that Jonathan brings us

all together. He comes to us with an idea,
and we say, "Great, let's do it." so, it
wouldn't happen without you, man (mo
tions toward Jonathan).
Jonathan: Aww.
Int: Why are yoti guys excited to play Bat
tle of the Bands?
Dee: I just really want to play. We aren't
going into this like, "I want to win," al
though that would be really sweet. I just
hope that people enjoy it.
Adam: Battle of the Bands is an interesting
gig because the audience tends to listen
more than in normal shows. They get more
into it, it's really fun.



They're hoping to be more known after Battle of the Bands



You can't see them in this photo, but they all have their strap-ons on.

Lock your doors, keep the kids at home — the Battle of the Bands is back. Co-sponsored by the
gentlemen of Phi Kappa 1'si, the Stanford Concert Network and the ASSU, the event is expected
to draw about 1,000 music-lovers to the Toyon lounge on Saturday night. For those of you unfa
miliar with the battle, it showcases some of the best student bands at Stanford competing for the
historic honor of victory, along with primetime airplay on KZSU and maybe a random gilt cer
tificate or two. Members of the concert network, KZSU and the Music Department will judge
which of the five half-hour sets is the best.
But, above all, what these five bands will get from performing at Battle of the Bands is expo
sure. Intermission is always eager to expose — read on to learn more about the musicians who've
clawed their way to the top of the college band heap this year.
13th Annual Battle of the Bands
9-11 p.m. (competition begins at 9:45), Toyon Lounge

David Baron, '06 Vocals I Piano
Ben Grant, '06 Drums
Gabe Davis, '06 Bass
Intermission: Give us some background on
how you started the band.
David: Well, I got into Stanford, and 1 was
really excited.
Int: Not that much background.
David: Gabe lives in my hall — we both live
in Cedro — and Gabe played with Ben in a
jazz combo. The three of us just sounded
good together, and it worked.
Int: How to describe your sound?
Gabe: Good.
Int: We were thinking of your genre.
David: You can't label our music! We're our
own sound. There arc many elements to the
David Baron Element!
Ben: Do NOT put that in the article.
David: No, that was a complete cliche. Why
don't we just say that we don't come from
any influences. We are completely vacu
umess in our sound.
Gabe: Vacuumess? That's not a word.
David: I'm so pissed, I'm just gonna make
up words!
Int: What the hell is "vacuumess?"
David: Seriously, I would say, we're piano
based rock with funk and jazz elements.
Ben: Yeah, a solid funky rhythm section
with a nice musical theatre voice over it.
Int: Who are some of your favorite musi
cians?
Gabe: I'd say Flea — he's a funky bitch.
Ben: Definitely Carter Beauford, then
Bonzo(a.k.a.)John Bonham, from Led Zep
pelin.
Gabe: Why do you call him Bonzo?
Ben: That's what you call him, if you love
him. The Bonz.

Gabe: Oh.
David: Should I not say Dave Matthews?
OK, Billy Joel, then Dave Matthews.
Int: What do you guys shoot for lyrically?
David: As far as the lyrics are concerned, I
try to remain, I don't know, 1 guess the word
would be "derivative"? Is that a bad word?
Int: That's a terrible word. Derivative from
what?
David: Derivative from the influences we
named — everything from Springsteen to
Dave.
Int: Oh, that's better. Give us a sample lyric.
David: They're Springsteenish. A good
opening line is "Carve it in stone / And take
a look at what you've found / Redemption
and the sound / of more than just screaming
out loud."
Ben: That IS a good line.
Gabe: Wait, what song is that?
David: They have no idea what the lyrics
are. They never hear them in the back.
Int: Are you considering careers in music?
Gabe: I'd most definitely want to be a musi

cian. If I'm poor, that's fine.
Ben: It's a possible option, but not an easy
one. If I could do it and get rich, for sure!
David: Honestly, I didn't expect to start a
band at all the first quarter of freshman year.
And I didn't expect to be the fuckin' luckiest
guy in the world playing with Gabe and Ben.
Really. I mean, Gabe is one sexy bitch.
Gabe: Ben's a gentle giant.
Int: Awwww. What do you expect to get
from Battle of the Bands?
David: It's more exciting to not have huge
expections, and, you know, whatever hap
pens happens. And so far it's been really
good, the things that are happening. Basi
cally, we want so many people to hear us.
Gabe: Yeah, we've got a message! We've
gotta deliver it.
Ben: Yeah, maybe now would be a good
time fora shout-out to the social reps of all
the campus houses: We're available to hire.
Int: Hey, do you want to talk shit about any
of the other bands?
Gabe: I've had sex with all their moms.

Carlos Cabrera, '06 Drums
David Corcoran,'o6 Electric guitar
Donald Diaz, '06 Bass
Zach Katagiri, '05 Lead vocals I
Acoustic guitar
Intermission: So how did you kids meet?
Zach' We all lived in Burbank, that's the
main reason we got together.
Int: Where did the name come from?
Carlos : Zach always wanted to play in a
band called "Lesser Known."
Zach: This is true. I was driving around back
in Portland with one of my friends, and we
were just brainstorming band names, and I
thought "Lesser Known" would be cool.
Int: And you could maintain your indie
credibility with that name.
Zach: Yeah, even when we go mainstream.
Even after the sellouts.
Int: Who are some of your major influ
ences?
David: Oh man, we come from very differ
ent musical backgrounds. Lots of youthful
pop punk, lots of classical guitar.
Carlos: I listen to jazz, instrumental stuff. I
listen to Rush sometimes, Dream Theatre.
Donald: And some classic rock bands like
Led Zeppelin, stuff like that.
Int: If you were a rock critic, how would you
describe your sound?
Zach: Acoustic alternative rock. But I think
we may have created a new genre.
Int: Really? What would it be called?
Zach: I .esser Known, epitomized by the
band with the same name!

David: It would be called progressive
acoustic alternative modern rock — that
sounds about right.
Int: What are the themes you explore in
your lyrics?
Zach: Anti-cop. I don't know, I guess basic
adolescent angst.
David: Well, not too angsty, but definitely
youthful themes.
Int: Hit us up with some semi-angsty lyrics.
Zach: One I like is out of "Stillborn Prayers,"
it goes, "I got a broken light bulb in my hand
/1 got no plan / And I got no purpose for
today." I wrote it when I was a lot younger,
and I was trying to decide how much I want
ed to concentrate on music. And I decided
that in a lot of ways playing music was kind

of like a broken light bulb, like it sounds like
a good idea, but in terms of being a success
ful person, it's not going to get you where
you want to go.
Int: Are the rest of you planning to pursue a
music career after Stanford?
Carlos: I would love to drop out and play
the drums all the time. But 1 don't think I
will.
David: Yeah, we've gotta bow to the will of
reality. Which is kind of sad.
Int: What are you hoping to get from Battle
of the Bands?
Donald: Well, it's definitely going to be a
start. No matter what happens, it'll be our
first big appearance together.
David: I want to win!

Dan Mark, '03 Guitar/ Vocals
Alex Moore, '05 Lead Guitar
Dianna Ferrand, '05 Bass
Chris Chan, '05 Drums
Intermission: How did you get together?
Dan: We started playing together last year. We all
lived in Burbank together. We started playing in
the Burbank basement for like months and
months, annoying the hell out of people. That
was really fun. We had a bass player last year, but
he left after he graduated, so we got Dianna at the
beginning of this year.
Int: What are your performances like?
Dan: We reaHy try to put on a good show. W r e
jump around, do our little rock star antics.
Alex: Our whole thing is like, if we don't think a
song isn't going to emotionally affect the crowd or
get them physically excited, then we just don't
want to play it.
Int: Who are your influences?
Dan: Bands that I've been listening to recently:
Finch, Chevelle, Heart. Recently I've had that
song by The Used stuck in my head nonstop —
"Burn Myself Alive." That's been playing nonstop
in my MP3 player.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Alex: Modern alternative rock.
Dan: With emo and punk influences.
Int: So, do you wear matching outfits or what?
Dan: We were wearing matching lingerie at our
last show .. .no ...
Alex: Sometimes we do a theme, like farm ani
mals or something like that. Like I'll dress up like
a cow, and Dan will be the pig.
Dan: No, I'm the cow!

Alex: Actually, our band is a conglomeration of na
tionwide finalists of the Sexiest Guy Competition.
Dan: Except Dianna.
Alex : Except Dianna, who won the Sexiest Girl
Competition.
Dan: (Quoting "Zoolander") There's got to be
something in life other than being incredibly
good looking. (Does "the Magnum.")
Int: HA. What about your sound is different?
Alex: I think it's the songwriting, the lyrical struc
turing.
Dan: I've been listening to a lot of emo and punk
recently, and a lot of times I like the music, but
the lyrics are like: "I'm walking down the
streeeeet / and I see this girl / and she doesn't
like meeee / so I'm gonna try and not / whine too
much tonight."
Alex: Our stuff is listenable, and there's usually
some profound emotional content but without
being cheesy. Mainstream right now is either
hard and screaming or it's really cheesy and real
ly pop. We're kind of in between.
Dan: I kind of feel like I want to bring some in
telligence to this genre, not that there isn't any,
but I'm just saying that I think that people who
listen to this kind of music would appreciate
something that's a little deeper sometimes.
Alex: If you read our lyrics from some of our
songs, it kind of reads like a little poem.
Int: What's one representative line?
Dan: "Back down / you're on the floor / Give out
a sound / that spreads around the room." That's
one of the opening lines for one of the songs we're
going to be playing at Battle of the Bands.

Int: What are you hoping to get from Battle
of the Bands?
Donald: Well, it's definitely going to be a
start. No matter what happens, it'll be our
first big appearance together.
David: I want to win!

Dan Mark, '03 Guitar/ Vocals
Alex Moore, '05 Lead Guitar
Dianna Ferrand, '05 Bass
Chris Chan, '05 Drums
Intermission: How did you get together?
Dan: We started playing together last year. We all
lived in Burbank together. We started playing in
the Burbank basement for like months and
months, annoying the hell out of people. That
was really fun. We had a bass player last year, but
he left after he graduated, so we got Dianna at the
beginning of this year.
Int: What are your performances like?
Dan: We reaHy try to put on a good show. W r e
jump around, do our little rock star antics.
Alex: Our whole thing is like, if we don't think a
song isn't going to emotionally affect the crowd or
get them physically excited, then we just don't
want to play it.
Int: Who are your influences?
Dan: Bands that I've been listening to recently:
Finch, Chevelle, Heart. Recently I've had that
song by The Used stuck in my head nonstop —
"Burn Myself Alive." That's been playing nonstop
in my MP3 player.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Alex: Modern alternative rock.
Dan: With emo and punk influences.
Int: So, do you wear matching outfits or what?
Dan: We were wearing matching lingerie at our
last show .. .no ...
Alex: Sometimes we do a theme, like farm ani
mals or something like that. Like I'll dress up like
a cow, and Dan will be the pig.
Dan: No, I'm the cow!

Alex: Actually, our band is a conglomeration of na
tionwide finalists of the Sexiest Guy Competition.
Dan: Except Dianna.
Alex : Except Dianna, who won the Sexiest Girl
Competition.
Dan: (Quoting "Zoolander") There's got to be
something in life other than being incredibly
good looking. (Does "the Magnum.")
Int: HA. What about your sound is different?
Alex: I think it's the songwriting, the lyrical struc
turing.
Dan: I've been listening to a lot of emo and punk
recently, and a lot of times I like the music, but
the lyrics are like: "I'm walking down the
streeeeet / and I see this girl / and she doesn't
like meeee / so I'm gonna try and not / whine too
much tonight."
Alex: Our stuff is listenable, and there's usually
some profound emotional content but without
being cheesy. Mainstream right now is either
hard and screaming or it's really cheesy and real
ly pop. We're kind of in between.
Dan: I kind of feel like I want to bring some in
telligence to this genre, not that there isn't any,
but I'm just saying that I think that people who
listen to this kind of music would appreciate
something that's a little deeper sometimes.
Alex: If you read our lyrics from some of our
songs, it kind of reads like a little poem.
Int: What's one representative line?
Dan: "Back down / you're on the floor / Give out
a sound / that spreads around the room." That's
one of the opening lines for one of the songs we're
going to be playing at Battle of the Bands.

Mike Albanese, '05 Guitar I Vocals
Eric Furtado, '05 Trumpet
Jordi Mata-Fink, '05 Violin I Bass
Matt Shulman, '05 Drums
Mike Solomon, '05 Piano I Vocals
Paul Wilkins, '05 Trumpet
Intermission: I low'd you get together?
Mike A: We all lived in Freshman /
Sophomore College last year. First. Mike
and I realized that we were both from
New Jersey and we both played instru
ments. Then we just found each other.
Int: Where does your name mean?
Mike A: It's kind of contrived because
Exit 9 is the exit on the New Jersey turn
pike that you'd take to get to either my or
Mike Solomon's house but in opposite
directions.
Int: How would you guys describe your
music?
Mike A: On the album we made it says,
"Adult Contemporary."
Paul: The guy we were recording with
said we could be on a country music
label. But I guess we would start with
rock, which is a pretty broad descriptor,
then a little bit of swing influence, a little
bit of Latin.
Int: Who are some of your influences?
Mike A: If you listen to Mike play ever,
you're going to hear Billy Joel.
Jordi: Billy Joel and Jellyfish. You know
the band Jellyfish?
Int: No ... sounds exciting.
Jordi: Jellyfish is this funk-ish, '70s-ish
band. One time Mike S. wrote a song
and then later realized it was an almost
exact copy of a Jellyfish song he heard.
Int: What are your shows like?
Mike A: Jordi played a whole gig

dressed in a towel. One time we did a
strip tease. I can't guarantee that Jordi
won't be naked for the whole gig. I'm not
comfortable guaranteeing that.
Int: Do your lyrics reflect this craziness?
Mike A: We have a problem writing seri
ous songs. The first silly song we wrote I
think was "Your Mom." So the song's all
about having sex with my mom. It's pret
ty funny.
Int: Have you played it for your mom?
Mike A: Uh, no.
Jordi: We have more than our share of
girl-named songs.
Paul: And most of them are not particu
larly positive.
Mike A: Not because we have that many
girl troubles, just because it's funny.
Paul: A funny title we have for one of our
girl-related songs is "2-16." Mike S.
wrote it, and we asked, "Why '2-16?'" He
said, "because it's Valentine's Day."
Int: That's so typical.
Paul: We couldn't change it after that.
Int: Do any of you plan to pursue a ca

reer in music?
Mike A: No, no, two more years — that's
a long time to just have fun.
Paul: When we have our reunion tour,
we'll let you know.
Mike A: We can have our rise and then
our fall. We'll do a VHI "Behind the
Scenes."
Jordi: We've got to start having our drug
problem now.
Int: Why are you playing Battle of
Bands?
Jordi: I don't know if you get anything
from winning, do you?
Mike A: A pizza party!
Jordi: We want to get our name out
there, but there are people who know us.
Mike A: Mostly our friends.
Paul: This is probably the largest audi
ence we'll have played for.
Jordi: We hope that this year we can
come through and really rock on with
our strap-ons on.
Int: "Rock on with our strap-ons on."
We can't wait.

Jonathan Beard, '03 Lead vocals I
Keyboard
Mike Alfred, '03 Guitar
Adam Fong, '02 Bass I Vocals
Dee Savery, '05 Drums I Vocals
Intermission: What's your history?
Jonathan: The band consisted of all differ
ent people up until this year. Now we've all
been together for about a month. Every
one's been changing, but we're pretty sure
that this is the solid lineup.
Int: How would you describe your sound?
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a little bit of soul.
Jonathan: A lot of soul.
Mike: Love rock with an emphasis on love
and a lot of soul.
Jonathan: That's beautiful
Mike: I just came up with that right now.
Jonathan: That could be our new catch
phrase.
Int: What are your performances like?
Jonathan: Well, Mike is always naked.
Dee: It's fresh and new, and a lot of people
aren't doing it right now. It's not your typ
ical college band. We're having fun. We just
love playing.
Mike: All the solos are completely impro
vised. There isn't a set structure.
Int: Do you play originals mostly?
Jonathan : We play largely our own music.

We play a few choice covers once in a while:
a little Stevie Wonder, some classic rock.
Int: Who are your influences?
Jonathan: I'd say Stevie Wonder, Prince,
Billy Joel and the Police.
Mike: I like Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page.
Int: C you give us a good representative
lyric or two?
Jonathan: One that gets stuck in everyone's
head is "I'm young / I'm strong / My hair
used to be red, but now it's brown" from
"Rescue Me." A line that applies to all of us
is "Nothing in common except for all of
that."
Mike: Yeah, I'd say that Jonathan brings us

all together. He comes to us with an idea,
and we say, "Great, let's do it." so, it
wouldn't happen without you, man (mo
tions toward Jonathan).
Jonathan: Aww.
Int: Why are yoti guys excited to play Bat
tle of the Bands?
Dee: I just really want to play. We aren't
going into this like, "I want to win," al
though that would be really sweet. I just
hope that people enjoy it.
Adam: Battle of the Bands is an interesting
gig because the audience tends to listen
more than in normal shows. They get more
into it, it's really fun.



They're hoping to be more known after Battle of the Bands



You can't see them in this photo, but they all have their strap-ons on.

Lock your doors, keep the kids at home — the Battle of the Bands is back. Co-sponsored by the
gentlemen of Phi Kappa 1'si, the Stanford Concert Network and the ASSU, the event is expected
to draw about 1,000 music-lovers to the Toyon lounge on Saturday night. For those of you unfa
miliar with the battle, it showcases some of the best student bands at Stanford competing for the
historic honor of victory, along with primetime airplay on KZSU and maybe a random gilt cer
tificate or two. Members of the concert network, KZSU and the Music Department will judge
which of the five half-hour sets is the best.
But, above all, what these five bands will get from performing at Battle of the Bands is expo
sure. Intermission is always eager to expose — read on to learn more about the musicians who've
clawed their way to the top of the college band heap this year.
13th Annual Battle of the Bands
9-11 p.m. (competition begins at 9:45), Toyon Lounge

David Baron, '06 Vocals I Piano
Ben Grant, '06 Drums
Gabe Davis, '06 Bass
Intermission: Give us some background on
how you started the band.
David: Well, I got into Stanford, and 1 was
really excited.
Int: Not that much background.
David: Gabe lives in my hall — we both live
in Cedro — and Gabe played with Ben in a
jazz combo. The three of us just sounded
good together, and it worked.
Int: How to describe your sound?
Gabe: Good.
Int: We were thinking of your genre.
David: You can't label our music! We're our
own sound. There arc many elements to the
David Baron Element!
Ben: Do NOT put that in the article.
David: No, that was a complete cliche. Why
don't we just say that we don't come from
any influences. We are completely vacu
umess in our sound.
Gabe: Vacuumess? That's not a word.
David: I'm so pissed, I'm just gonna make
up words!
Int: What the hell is "vacuumess?"
David: Seriously, I would say, we're piano
based rock with funk and jazz elements.
Ben: Yeah, a solid funky rhythm section
with a nice musical theatre voice over it.
Int: Who are some of your favorite musi
cians?
Gabe: I'd say Flea — he's a funky bitch.
Ben: Definitely Carter Beauford, then
Bonzo(a.k.a.)John Bonham, from Led Zep
pelin.
Gabe: Why do you call him Bonzo?
Ben: That's what you call him, if you love
him. The Bonz.

Gabe: Oh.
David: Should I not say Dave Matthews?
OK, Billy Joel, then Dave Matthews.
Int: What do you guys shoot for lyrically?
David: As far as the lyrics are concerned, I
try to remain, I don't know, 1 guess the word
would be "derivative"? Is that a bad word?
Int: That's a terrible word. Derivative from
what?
David: Derivative from the influences we
named — everything from Springsteen to
Dave.
Int: Oh, that's better. Give us a sample lyric.
David: They're Springsteenish. A good
opening line is "Carve it in stone / And take
a look at what you've found / Redemption
and the sound / of more than just screaming
out loud."
Ben: That IS a good line.
Gabe: Wait, what song is that?
David: They have no idea what the lyrics
are. They never hear them in the back.
Int: Are you considering careers in music?
Gabe: I'd most definitely want to be a musi

cian. If I'm poor, that's fine.
Ben: It's a possible option, but not an easy
one. If I could do it and get rich, for sure!
David: Honestly, I didn't expect to start a
band at all the first quarter of freshman year.
And I didn't expect to be the fuckin' luckiest
guy in the world playing with Gabe and Ben.
Really. I mean, Gabe is one sexy bitch.
Gabe: Ben's a gentle giant.
Int: Awwww. What do you expect to get
from Battle of the Bands?
David: It's more exciting to not have huge
expections, and, you know, whatever hap
pens happens. And so far it's been really
good, the things that are happening. Basi
cally, we want so many people to hear us.
Gabe: Yeah, we've got a message! We've
gotta deliver it.
Ben: Yeah, maybe now would be a good
time fora shout-out to the social reps of all
the campus houses: We're available to hire.
Int: Hey, do you want to talk shit about any
of the other bands?
Gabe: I've had sex with all their moms.

Carlos Cabrera, '06 Drums
David Corcoran,'o6 Electric guitar
Donald Diaz, '06 Bass
Zach Katagiri, '05 Lead vocals I
Acoustic guitar
Intermission: So how did you kids meet?
Zach' We all lived in Burbank, that's the
main reason we got together.
Int: Where did the name come from?
Carlos : Zach always wanted to play in a
band called "Lesser Known."
Zach: This is true. I was driving around back
in Portland with one of my friends, and we
were just brainstorming band names, and I
thought "Lesser Known" would be cool.
Int: And you could maintain your indie
credibility with that name.
Zach: Yeah, even when we go mainstream.
Even after the sellouts.
Int: Who are some of your major influ
ences?
David: Oh man, we come from very differ
ent musical backgrounds. Lots of youthful
pop punk, lots of classical guitar.
Carlos: I listen to jazz, instrumental stuff. I
listen to Rush sometimes, Dream Theatre.
Donald: And some classic rock bands like
Led Zeppelin, stuff like that.
Int: If you were a rock critic, how would you
describe your sound?
Zach: Acoustic alternative rock. But I think
we may have created a new genre.
Int: Really? What would it be called?
Zach: I .esser Known, epitomized by the
band with the same name!

David: It would be called progressive
acoustic alternative modern rock — that
sounds about right.
Int: What are the themes you explore in
your lyrics?
Zach: Anti-cop. I don't know, I guess basic
adolescent angst.
David: Well, not too angsty, but definitely
youthful themes.
Int: Hit us up with some semi-angsty lyrics.
Zach: One I like is out of "Stillborn Prayers,"
it goes, "I got a broken light bulb in my hand
/1 got no plan / And I got no purpose for
today." I wrote it when I was a lot younger,
and I was trying to decide how much I want
ed to concentrate on music. And I decided
that in a lot of ways playing music was kind

of like a broken light bulb, like it sounds like
a good idea, but in terms of being a success
ful person, it's not going to get you where
you want to go.
Int: Are the rest of you planning to pursue a
music career after Stanford?
Carlos: I would love to drop out and play
the drums all the time. But 1 don't think I
will.
David: Yeah, we've gotta bow to the will of
reality. Which is kind of sad.
Int: What are you hoping to get from Battle
of the Bands?
Donald: Well, it's definitely going to be a
start. No matter what happens, it'll be our
first big appearance together.
David: I want to win!
