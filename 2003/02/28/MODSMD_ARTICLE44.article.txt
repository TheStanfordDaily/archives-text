Say you're enjoying a walk in the park on a sunny after
noon when you come across your boyfriend having pas
sionate sex with a man in a business suit. What do you do?
If you're Delphine Watzka, you step right up and make po
lite conversation until the businessman leaves. Then you

stay with your
boyfriend be
cause, gay or not,
he knows how to
take care of you.
So begins our
acquaintance with

The Master Butchers
Singing Club
Louise Erdrich

Delphine, the ex
ceptional heroine of Louise Erdrich's "The Master Butc h
ers Singing Club." Delphine's been travelling the post-
World War I Midwest as part of a circus act in which she
balances an array of objects and a full-grown man on her
prodigious abs. Though the novel's opening chapters have
her quitting the act to return to her hometown of Argus,
N.D., it's clear that the balancing act is far from over for
Delphine.
She's got a job assisting singing butcher Fidelis Waldvo
gel and his wife Eva, who will soon need more from her
than her help behind the counter. Cyprian, the wayward
boyfriend, wants to marry her despite his preference for
men. And she's just found a family of three lying dead in
her dad's cellar.
Erdrich's characters have always been her greatest
strength. In the '90s they also became a weakness — she
spent several novels putting the same ones together in new

combinations and then shoving them into bed. With
"Club" she is back'on top, and her people push and pull on
each other with the force of celestial bodies.
Delphine is the sun of the novel's intricately crafted solar
system. Hers is the vantage point from which we see the
lives of Argus' citizens, lives Erdrich packs full of love, mad-

Erdrich invests these lives
with a dignity, one that en
dures whether her charac
ters are dying of cancer or
having sex in a public park.

ness, loss, fighting and, of course, singing. Eva Waldvogel
battles cancer, Delphine's dad goes on and off the bottle,
the sheriff lusts after the undertaker, the town bag lady
knows more than she's telling — and that's without the
bodies in the cellar.
That all this doesn't turn into a circus is a testament to
Erdrich's skill in creating Delphine. Her humor, strength
and sorrow permeate the book. As a daughter, a lover, a
friend and a surrogate mother to the Waldvogel boys, she
keeps together what might otherwise become a jumbled
mess.
When all mysteries are solved and all relationships re
vealed, we get a glimpse of Erdrich's vision of humanity
united in an order both terrible and beautiful. The novel
shines forth like a map of the heavens, crisscrossed with the
interconnected orbits of its characters.
The map has its flaws. Erdrich ties up some loose ends too
tidily, others not tidily enough. Some events near the novel's
end are so surprising as to seem almost gimmicky. And a few
plot threads — the death of Delphine's mother, for instance
— disappear for so long we almost forget they exist.
Still, these flaws dwindle before the largeness of Er
drich's project to delve deeply into a single life while con
sidering all those that depend upon it. Erdrich invests these
lives with a dignity, one that endures whether her charac
ters are dying of cancer or having sex in a public park. This
dignity makes "The Master Butchers Singing Club" fine we
want to join.




Underneath that proud exterior is one damn qood sinqin'
