# Ramones tribute will make you remember rock 'n' roll

11 any band ever deserved a trib
ute album — which is open to ques
tion — it's the Ramones. The mid
'9os success of Green Day and The
Offspring may have paved the way
for today's troupe of punk / pop pur
veyors, but the Ramones blazed the

trail back in '76.

shredded their way
through two-minute bursts of pure
energy at a time when the radio was
clogged with the decadent remains of
the hippie era. Their rock 'n' roll re
vivalism and punk attitude salvaged
the spirit of Chuck Berry while
birthing a new genre.
At first blush, "We're a Happy
Family: A Tribute to Ramones"
looks like a cynical exploitation of
anti-establishment music by some of
the biggest acts in corporate rock.
When Metallica chugs joylessly
through one of the Ramones' witti
est tunes, "53rd and 3rd," it feels less
like a tribute and more like a lame
appropriation.
But then you hear the wildmen
from Kiss romping along to "Do You
Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio"
(with a horn section no less), and
Gene Simmons sounds like he's hav
ing the time of his life. And you know
it's all OK, because this is rock 'n' roll
the way die Ramones envisioned it:

loud, fast and fun.
The album as a whole is worth
while to the extent that it's a true cel
ebration of a kickass band. The best
tracks are glorious, and the duds can
be overlooked.
The artists that succeed in covering
the Ramones are the ones that capture
and amplify one aspect of the band's

sound.
Straight up,
nobody can
beat the fa
thers of punk
at their own

gig, as Green Day and The Offspring
unintentionally demonstrate this with
their unimaginative versions of "Out
sider" and"I Wanna Be Sedated."
Among those that work are the
Red Hot Chili Peppers' vibed-out,
summer-barbecue version of "Ha
vana Affair," which changes the
song's genre while preserving its spir
it, and Rancid's hotrodded
"Sheena Is a Funk Rocker," which
ratchets up the tempo and intensity
like the hardcore acts of the early
'80s.
On the tracks following Kiss' slop
py masterpiece, Marilyn Manson of
fers up a delightfully creepy recasting
of "The KKK Took My Baby Away,"
and Garbage turns "1 Just Wanna
Have Something to Do" into a night
club-cool sleazefest.
Another highlight is Tom Waits'
two minutes of raw attitude on "Re
turn of Jackie & Judy." The guitar
churns like a runaway freight train,

and his lungs sound like they're
made of gravel, so who
cares if it's posturing?
Rumor has it that U2'ssublime "In
a Little While" was the last song Joey
Ramone heard before passing on
into rock history, but he would have
died laughing if he had instead heard

the Irish messiahs' comically earnest
rendering of "Beat On the Brat (With
a Baseball Bat)."
In any case, the legend would rest
contentedly today if he could hear
rock's biggest stars paying their re
spects, if not their full debt, to his rev
olutionary hand of rock 'n' roll rebels.




The Ramones: Even
cooler than the
Beatles.
