# Nick Cave's latest effort a cry for attention

My mom should consider lierselflucky
1 wasn't the kind of kid who was always
bugging her to watch me do a hundred
hula-hoops in two minutes. But I get the
feeling that Nick Cave might have been
that kid who went around showing every
one, "Look, I can balance two apples on
my head while doing a split!" And maybe
his mom responded with, "Shut up and
do your homework, Nick!" This could
help explain why, on his new album,
"Nocturama," Cave can't help but roll out
trick after overused trick.
The album opens with "Wonderful
Life," a dark ballad infused with a care
ful balance of hope and hopelessness.
The chorus begins with "It's a wonderful
life," modified immediately by, "If you
can find it." It works to great effect the
first three times, but by the end it be
comes unbearable. The minute changes
— from "If you can find it" to "When
you can find it" — recall that obnoxious
kid who does his trick first with two
Granny Smiths and then again with
Golden Delicious.
Chris Bailey from the Saints partners
up with Cave in "Bring it On," a duet
about the bleak responsibilities of being in
a relationship. Cave and Bailey do a mer

itable job playing off each other in the
chorus with vocals so thick, it sounds like
the way I would imagine a hearty beef
stew to sound. However, the song goes
weak around the 20th time you hear
them singing, "Bring it on."

Though "Bring it on" and "Wonderful
Life" merely fringe on being too repeti
tive, the last track, "Babe, I'm on Fire,"
was where my patience ran thinner than a
pair of sheer pantyhose. The song clocks
in at 14 minutes, 45 minutes, and bv

minute two, Cave
has only completed
one round of the
chorus with seven
left to go. It's obvi-

ous Cave is having a blast singing lyrics
like, "The foxhunting toff says it/The
horrible moth says it / The doomed ho
mosexual / With the persistent cough says
/ Babe, I'm on fire," but unfortunately for
the listener, the song never changes pace,
rises to a climax or even dwindles away.
Instead, it's Cave as that annoying kid who
makes you listen to him list all the words
that rhyme with "bad."
The older I get, the better I am able
to appreciate the motto, "Less is more,"
something that Cave should have fully
exercised on this album. In songs like
"There is a Town," the piano haunting
ly throbs in the background while Cave
sings sharply sparse lyrics, "And I
dream / That one day / I'll go back
home." Or in "Still in Love," Cave's vo
cals literally seem to ache when he sings,
"You might think I'm crazy/But I'm
still in love with you." This is the Cave I
want to get to know. I like the grown-up
Cave who knows when to use restraint
and when to realize reciting the state
capitals in alphabetical order no longer
merits adulation.


It doesn't matter how long you grow it in the back ... We can still tell that you're losing it
in the front.
