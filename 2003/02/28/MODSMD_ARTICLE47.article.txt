something very important: The total
ec lipse of the sun is, and always will be, |
the most inherently creepy thing in the
world. Here are the films:
"The Quaints," dir. Philip Floresi |

Black and white '50s-sitcom-style, com
plete with blankly happy wife and sancti
monious government-ho dad. Son
brings girlfriend over to meet the family,
but girlfriend's worried that dad won't
like her, because her last name's Bolshe
vik! That was nice, as well as the requisite

"gee willikers"-style acting from the cast.
However, I was frustrated that this ini
tially interesting premise didn't go any
where. When the sun was eclipsed and
the room grew dark, and dad said it was

the Russians finally attacking, I thought,
"Yes! Russians!" But then the film
ended.
"Three Minutes," dir. Kalilah
Robinson: Creepy as fuck. The sound

track of the film is an evil, womanly
voice looped over some music, saying
portentous things like, "Three minutes
every thousand years." A beautiful girl
wakes up, looks panicked and runs
around. People outside are watching a
solar eclipse, which is also very creepy.
Why? I couldn't say. The girl grabs a
knife from the kitchen and begins to cut
her wrists. Then she screams, and all
that's left is a bloody Barbie doll on the
ground. What it all means is that the girl
is cursed to be a doll forever but given
freedom for three minutes every thou
sand years. And, as Robinson said, if she
only had three minutes of freedom
every thousand years, she'd try to kill
herself.
"4:22," dir. Anna Kerrigan: I had no
idea what this meant. At the question
and-answer session at the end, the film
makers explained what they were trying
to do with their films (which cleared up
much confusion for me), but as of now, I
still don't know what "4:22" was about.
.As far as I can tell, there's a girl reading
and a weird mist creeping over the back

yard. Then everything is dark, and the
girl's resetting all the clocks in her house.
Then she's wearing a pink party dress
and waking up her resentful, sleepy
friend. They go outside and look up at
the sky. It's still dark. Although the plot
was frustratingly opaque, the film was at
mospheric (one of the main actresses has
huge, dark, silent-film actress eyes) and
again, creepy.
"God's Perfect Game," dir. Kirk
Shimano: A medical student has a
solar-powered contraption attached
to her head. It shocks her brain so
that she can stay awake to study. The
kid hanging out with her loves to play
I'ogs, and he tries to convince her to
play with him. She refuses, they fight,
the sun undergoes a total eclipse and
she falls asleep. This film was fun; the
actors were game, the music was cute,
and director Kirk Shimano utilizes
some interesting and weird zooming
shots. Plot-wise, it is neat ly impossi
ble to go wrong with such topics as
Fogs and electrical shocks to the
brain.
