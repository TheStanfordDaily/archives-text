### DAVID WELD 
"Gods and Generals," director
Ronald Maxwell's prequel to the
1993 civil war epic "Gettysburg,"
does his best to recreate the Cavil
War and seems to nearly succeed in
reproducing its length. The dull
and repetitive fighting scenes, the
cartoony aerial shots of battlefields,
and the endless speeches by noble
generals and selfless southern ma
trons all cry out piteously for the ed
itor's scissors.
The film is not without some rea
sonably talented actors. Robert Du
vall is assigned the part of Robert E.
Lee, certainly the most brilliant and
daring generals in American history,
but inexplicably elects to play him as
a weakly mumbling figurehead.
Mira Sorvino plays the wife of a
Northern ofticer capably, although a
suffusion of lip gloss makes it look
like she just stopped by the set on her
way to film "Romy and Michelle's
High School Reunion II" (here's
hoping). Jeff Daniels reprises his role
from "Gettysburg," in which he
played the Union's hero of that bat
tle — despite his show-stealing mus
tache, his scenes in this movie are
among the roughly two and a half
hours of footage that should have
been left on the cutting room floor.
But the most screen time is given to
the appealingly bug-eyed journey

man TV actor Stephen Lang, who

plays the incomparable

Stonewall Jackson.
A religious fanatic \
and tactical genius,
Jackson was one of the
most fascinating fig
ures of the war, and
many historians feel
that had he not been
killed at Chancel
lorsville (accidentally

j Gods and Generals
Dir. Ronald
Maxwell

shot by his own men), the outcome of
the war might have been very differ
ent. But in the hagiographical "Gods
and Generals," his character is
smoothed out and rendered almost
cuddly by a sometimes ridiculous
script.
In one inexcusable scene, Jackson
(who in real life believed that slavery
was part of God's plan) assures his
black cook that the Southern leaders
are secretly planning to free the
slaves so that they can fight for the
Gonfederacy. Later on, the film is di
verted from its course fora good 20
minutes by a subplot in which
Stonewall befriends a small girl, then
dissolves in tears when she is carried
oft by scarlet fever. I bis is again
something of a departure from the
real character of the general who
once, when told that a messenger
boy he had rebuked for being lazy
had been killed by a Union sniper,
murmured approvingly "very com-

mendable, verv commend
able."
Abraham Lincoln,

like Emperor Palpatine,
remains offstage for the
entirety of this first
episode of what we are
ominously informed will
be a trilogy. His tyranny
is represented onscreen
by a lew bumbling North
ern generals and the sec

retary of war, who assure each other
with imperially rolled r's that the re
bellion will soon be crushed. The
pro-Southern slant of "Gods and
Generals" has attracted some criti
cism, but after sitting through the
film it is hard to feel outrage or in
deed anything other than relief that
it is over.
I he only really powerful scene in
the movie, apart from the welcome
intermission, shows a confederate
soldier and a union soldier meeting
in between the two armies to word
lessly exchange coffee and tobacco.
But this moment, while beautifully
filmed, is hardly worth the four
hours of nonsense that surrounds it.
Ifyou are interested in the Civil War,
your time would be far better spent
watching a good chunk of Ken
Burns' magnum opus, "The Civil
War," than fidgeting through this
unwieldy and seemingly unedited
monstrosity.
