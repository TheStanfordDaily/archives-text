# Mechanical engineers use Corvette for work, not play
## Move over, Knight Rider

It's black, it's sexy — and it's
been chilling in the courtyard of
the Mechanical Engineering Re
search Laboratory off of Santa
Theresa Road for most of the year.

The 1997 black Corvette that has
sparked the curiosity of passers-by
is not just eye-candy, though — it
is actually an experimental test ve
hicle for new safe driving technolo
gies being developed at Stanford.
"[The] first time I saw it. . . I was
walking out of the building, and it

was strange to have such a nic e car
parked right there," said senior
Morris Cohen. "And I noticed it
again two weeks later. I thought,
'Has that car moved or does some
one just park it there everyday?' "
Junior Quentin Baca lamented,
"To think, I could have been [a
mechanical engineering major]
and had a Corvette to play with."
But the car is more than just a
conversation piece or an incentive
to be a tecliie.
As part of one major experi
ment, the Corvette employs a sys
tem designed to keep the car from
accidentally veering out ol its lane.
Chris Gerdes, an assistant profes
sor of mechanical engineering and
head of the Dynamic Design Labo
ratory, said that a large percentage
of highway accidents result from
this problem.
"A lot of accidents are not that
complex, but fairly simple,"
Gerdes said, citing driver error
such as drowsiness. While most re
search in the past has focused on

fully automated cars, Gerdes want
ed to develop a different system.
"We started to look at how we
could work with the driver to avoid
accidents rather than take the driver
totally out of the equation," he said.
The lane maintenance system
utilizes both global positioning and
drive-by-wire technology, accord
ing to Paul Yih, a graduate student
working in the lab.
"The steering of the front
wheels is not mechanically con
net ted to the steering wheel —
it's all electronic," Yih said, de
scribing the car's drive-by-wire
system. "It allows you to separate
the driver's command from what
actually happens [and] provides a
way for the safety system to inter
vene between the driver and the
steering."
Yih was responsible for the de
velopment, design and construc
tion of the Corvette's drive-by
wire system.

This 1997 Corvette, parked across from Tresidder, is not just for show. The
car is being used to develop new technology that would reduce the number
of crashes caused by driver error.
The Corvette's "differential
GPS" system uses a combination of
satellite and ground-based sta
tions to pinpoint the car's position
within two centimeters, Yih said.
The system allows for precise
monitoring of both location and
velocity.
After one manual run on a
road, the Corvette's driver-assis
tance system is ready to go. If the
car begins to drift off the road, the
computer will auto correct and
move the vehicle bark toward the

center of the lane.
"The driver is, in essence, dri
ving in a sort of little valley,"
Gerdes said. "The vehicle will tend
to stay in that valley unless the dri
ver steers it out."
What about intentionally
changing lanes? "If you do try to
change lanes, the car will resist a
little bit," Gerdes said. "It'll feel
like you're going over a little
bump." The resistance is slight but
more than enough to maintain the
lane.
"We believe that there should
be only one intelligence in the
car," Gerdes said. "Our system be
haves very predictably, and the
driver can always override the sys

tern." He added that, in test runs,
it's not difficult to intentionally
force the car to hit cones.
Other students in the lah are
working on an eye tracking system
that could more easily determine
when the driver means to change
lanes by following his gaze.
The Gorvette was donated to
Gerdes' lab by General Motors.
Much of the funding for the lab's
work comes from the automobile
industry.
Gerdes said that they had in
tended to leave the car in the
courtyard only temporarily, but
they decided to leave it there after
it began to generate student inter
est in mechanical engineering.

Another experimental technol
ogy being developed involves dy
namically altering the Gorvette's
handling.
The car's drive-by-wire tech
nology allows the car's computers
to determine how sensitively the
car steers. Although the steering is
not mechanically connected lo the
car's wheels, a motor simulates
natural resistance to turning the
wheel, according to Yih.
Gerdes said that, by readjusting
for weight and velocity, the com
puter can cause the car to handle
identically whether the driver is
alone or fully loaded with passen
gers. The system could also allow a
less expensive car to handle like a

higher-end vehicle.
Researchers have conducted
low-speed test runs in parking lots
on campus. For higher speed tests,
they use the runway at Moffett Air
Field in Sunnyvale. The re
searchers will be conducting a test
there this weekend.
Gerdes called the drive-by-wire
system the "last frontier for vehicle
control systems." He noted that
cars with break-by-wire and throt
tle-by-wire systems are already on
the road. Many automotive com
panies are currently investigating
drive-by-wire technologies.
Nissan already has implement
ed a lane-keeping system with cars
on the road in Japan. Gerdes esti

mated that a similar system, utiliz
ing drive-by-wire, could be on
U.S. roads within 10 years.
"It's a few years off in the fu
ture," he said, "but we don't think
it's an unrealistic goal. [We're
working toward] a viable safety
system that could save a number of
lives."
But even though the Corvette's
technology could save lives, some
students aren't convinced it was
the best car for the job.
"1 don't like Corvettes person
ally," said senior Jing Cai. "I like
the new Ford T-bird; my ideal car
would be an Audi a4 convertible,
[because] it's got the luxury of a
BMW without the pretension."
