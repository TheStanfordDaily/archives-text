# Mechanical engineers use Corvette for work, not play
## Move over, Knight Rider

It's black, it's sexy — and it's
been chilling in the courtyard of
the Mechanical Engineering Re
search Laboratory off of Santa
Theresa Road for most of the year.

The 1997 black Corvette that has
sparked the curiosity of passers-by
is not just eye-candy, though — it
is actually an experimental test ve
hicle for new safe driving technolo
gies being developed at Stanford.
"[The] first time I saw it. . . I was
walking out of the building, and it

was strange to have such a nic e car
parked right there," said senior
Morris Cohen. "And I noticed it
again two weeks later. I thought,
'Has that car moved or does some
one just park it there everyday?' "
Junior Quentin Baca lamented,
"To think, I could have been [a
mechanical engineering major]
and had a Corvette to play with."
But the car is more than just a
conversation piece or an incentive
to be a tecliie.
As part of one major experi
ment, the Corvette employs a sys
tem designed to keep the car from
accidentally veering out ol its lane.
Chris Gerdes, an assistant profes
sor of mechanical engineering and
head of the Dynamic Design Labo
ratory, said that a large percentage
of highway accidents result from
this problem.
"A lot of accidents are not that
complex, but fairly simple,"
Gerdes said, citing driver error
such as drowsiness. While most re
search in the past has focused on

fully automated cars, Gerdes want
ed to develop a different system.
"We started to look at how we
could work with the driver to avoid
accidents rather than take the driver
totally out of the equation," he said.
The lane maintenance system
utilizes both global positioning and
drive-by-wire technology, accord
ing to Paul Yih, a graduate student
working in the lab.
"The steering of the front
wheels is not mechanically con
net ted to the steering wheel —
it's all electronic," Yih said, de
scribing the car's drive-by-wire
system. "It allows you to separate
the driver's command from what
actually happens [and] provides a
way for the safety system to inter
vene between the driver and the
steering."
Yih was responsible for the de
velopment, design and construc
tion of the Corvette's drive-by
wire system.

This 1997 Corvette, parked across from Tresidder, is not just for show. The
car is being used to develop new technology that would reduce the number
of crashes caused by driver error.
