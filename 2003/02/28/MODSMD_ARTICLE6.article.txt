# 'Freebake' defends affirmative action
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Students for Educational
Equity have been giving away fi ee
cookies, brownies and cake this
week in White Plaza as part of Free
bake — an event designed to
counter the proposed affirmative
action bake sale by the Stanford Col
lege Republicans. Each day has fea
tured a different theme, culminat
ing today in "Jiggy for Justice."
The proposed Republican bake
sale was modeled after one at
UCLA, where students were
charged different prices for cookies
based on their race and gender.
Prices ranged from 25 cents a cook
ie for black, Latina and Native
American female students to $2 a
cookie for white males and all Asian
Americans.
Students for Educational Equity
has publicized the event with the
slogan "Education Is A Right, Not A

Privilege" and is giving cookies
away to symbolize the belief that ed
ucation should be available for all.
"We believe everyone should
have equal access to education,"
said head organizer Timmy Lu, a
sophomore and member of the
Stanford Asian Americ an Activism
Coalition. "Attacks on affirmative
action presume that the very in
equalities that affirmative action ad
dresses do not exist. The forces of
racism, homophobia, sexism and
nativism historically prevented and
continue to prevent students from
achieving their maximum poten
tial."
The College Republicans decid
ed to cancel their event in favor of "a
less divisive and controversial
event," said College Republicans
President Joe Fairbanks, a sopho
more. "The only effect a Bake Sale

versy and anger, rather than
thoughtful debate. Obviously, that
would not aid our cause in fighting
blatantly racist policies like affirma
tive action.
"My response to the Freebake
sale is that the group should be con
sistent with their theme," continued
Fairbanks. "If education is not a
privilege as the organizers claim,
they should stop giving minorities
privileges simply because of their
skin color."
Other students have reacted fa
vorably to the event.
"When I heard about the UCLA
bake sale I was ardently and per
sonally offended," said sophomore
Sara Ines Caldeion. "I think this
bake sale is an excellent way to
demonstrate a fundamental princi
ple, that education is not just for cer
tain ethnic groups. It is not for peo
ple of a certain socioeconomic stra
tum. It's for everyone. I am glad
that there are people on this cam
pus who understand this."
Students for Educational Equity is
an ad hoc group comprised of nearly
50 students. While there is heavy in
volvement by the Students of Color
Coalition, there are also volunteers
affiliated with MEChA, a
Chicano / Latino student group, the
Black Student Union, the Asian

American Students Association, Stan
ford Asian American Activism Coali
tion, Stanford Action Coali
tion, Stanford in Government, the
Campus Greens, Resistance Alt and
Social Protest, Stanford Community
for Peace and Justice and more.
"Students for Educational Equi
ty is really less of a concrete student
group than a quickly mobilized
coalition of individuals supporting
affirmative action policies," Lu said.
"The real purpose of the bake
goods at this point is to draw people
towards the table and really present
the issues, how affirmative action is
under attack, why one would sup
port affirmative action [and] why it
continues to be necessary."
He added, "In addition, consider
ing the recent statements made by
President Hennessy and the ASSU,
this is also an opportunity for sup
porters to speak out and show that the
student population really does sup
port affirmative action and will rally to
support it in the face of opposition."
Each day this week focused on a
different theme concerning affir
mative action. On Monday the
theme was misconceptions of affir
mative action; Tuesday's theme was
equality in education; Wednesday's
was the campus campaign for affir
mative action; and yesterday's was
the history of injustice. The week
will conclude today at noon with a
Jiggy for Justice," which will fea

awareness-raising events.
