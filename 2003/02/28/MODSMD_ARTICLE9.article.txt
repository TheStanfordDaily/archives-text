# Iron chefs battle it out in Wilbur
## 
### PRITI SANGHANI 
Spicy noodles with shrimp, veg
etable fajitas and a vegan-fusion stir
fry were only a few of the meals cre
ated for the 'student-chef Iron Chef
competition that took place
Wednesday night in Wilbur Dining.
Although the event was not as com
petitive as the popular television
show, it was a unique opportunity
for undergraduate and graduate
students to work cooperatively with
a real chef in a commercial environ
ment.
Although Stanford traditionally
has held yearly Iron Chef competi
tions with dining hall chefs compet
ing against each other, the idea of a
student competition, the brainchild
of freshman Aron Hegyi, was com
pletely new.
A resident of Okada, Hegyi real
ized that there were few opportuni
ties for Stanford students to show

case their cooking skills. "My friends
and I were thinking of starting a
cooking club, but we never got
around to that," Hegyi said.
Undeterred, Hegyi turned to
Wilbur Dining's "Mama Carole,"
who referred him to the Associate
Director of Residential Dining, Rati
Taherian. Thrilled with Hegyi's
suggestion, Taherian and Hegyi,
along with Wilbur Dining's execu
tive chef Bruce Biron, began to plan
a student Iron Chef Competition.
Through e-mail and lliers, Hegyi
recruited 10 students to participate
in the contest. Prior to the competi
tion, each student went through a
one-hour training session led by the
chefs at Wilbur, where they learned
about health issues such as cross
contamination. They also were
taught about "mise en place,"
French for "putting in place," a
technique in which the ingredients
lor a dish are arranged in a particu

lar way so the chef is not scrambling
during the cooking process. The
c hefs also demonstrated how to use
the kitchen's electromagnetic burn
ers, which only heat the pans rather
than the air around them, creating a
more comfortable cooking environ
ment.
This quarter the student compe
tition coincided with the regular
Iron Chef Competition in Wilbur
Dining, so the teams were made up
of groups of 2-3 students led by a
Wilbur chef. Instead of making
food according to their own recipes,
the student chefs cooked planned
meals alongside a Wilbur chef at cul
turally themed stations. Rather
than being extremely competitive,
the event was "an opportunity for
students to cook like friends," Hegyi
said.
Plans fora more student-oriented
event, with individual recipes, will
take a lot of preparation and changes.
" In order t< > make just tiesh pasta for
100 to 150 students, it will take an enor
mous amount of energy and time,"
Hegyi said. "Student's ixxipes will very
likely have to be modified u) meet the de
mands of such a large capacity of diners.
However, plans ate underway to niiike

the student Iron Chef competition in
the spiing much more involved and
competitive.
Hegyi is excited for the prospect of
the 'student' Iron Chef competition,
which he tentatively named "Farm
cook," becoming a quarterly or year
ly event at Stanford. "I think having a
student competition separate from
the Iron Chef competition would be
beneficial," said Heg)i, who has been
cooking for his family since he was lit
tle. "I think it's tun to throw stuff in a
pan and see what comes out."
