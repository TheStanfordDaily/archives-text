ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — A top member of
Turkey's governing party yesterday rejected a quick
new vote on letting U.S. troops use the country to
open a northern front against Iraq — a second
harsh blow to U.S. war planners in as many days.
After a revolt in its ranks Saturday, the Islamic
rooted ruling party is in disarray, torn between pop
ular opposition to war and fears of possible lasting
damage to the historically close ties with Washington.
Eyup Fatsa, deputy head of the governing party's
parliamentary group, said there would be no quick
revote after Turkey's parliament Saturday failed to
approve a government-backed motion to allow
62,000 U.S. combat troops in the country fora possi

ble war against neighboring Iraq. The move was re
jected despite the party's overwhelming majority.
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis told re
porters that leaders would decide what to do about
the motion after a "process of evaluation" was com
pleted. He said he did not know how long that
process could take.
Asked if the proposal would be back on the
agenda this week, Yakis said, "The process (of
evaluation) will be completed, then it will come."
He did not elaborate.
Parliament's decision stunned Washington and
jeopardizes U.S. planning fora northern front against
Iraq, a crucial part of the American war strategy.
