# Strike date set by Broadway union leaders

NEW YORK (AP) — The union representing
Broadway musicians set a strike deadline of mid
night Thursday in its battle with theater produc
ers over the thorny issue of minimums — the
number of orchestra players required for Broad
way shows.
"The parties continue to be very far apart, and
there's not going to be a settlement tonight," Bill
Dennison, an assistant to union president Bill Mo
riarity, said yesterday. "We have set a strike dead
line for Thursday midnight March 6."
Dennison said the producers have proposed
the number of musicians required for the large
Broadway theaters be reduced to seven. The min
imums at those large theaters currently range
from 24 to 26.
The producers would like to do away with min
imums altogether, calling them "featherbedding,"
or requiring them to use more players than are ac
tually needed. The union, which currently has
about 325 musicians working in 19 musicals, says
the minimums are essential to keep live music
from disappearing on Broadway.
Representatives of Local 802 of the American
Federation of Musicians and the League of Amer
ican Theatres and Producers met throughout the
weekend in an effort to solve the impasse. The
contract between the two groups was to expire at
midnight yesterday.
The musicians had voted Saturday to give their
union authority to call a strike if necessary against
theater producers. Such a walkout would affect
virtually every musical on Broadway.
Last Monday, casts began rehearsing with com
puter-generated virtual orchestras, which pro
ducers vow to use if the musicians walk out. That
move prompted Moriarity to call for the strike au
thorization vote.
