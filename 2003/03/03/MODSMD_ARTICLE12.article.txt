Editorial

Two weeks ago, the student body
learned that the Stanford Col
lege Republicans might break
the tradition of primarily liberal
campus demonstrations by conducting
one of their own. The proposed affirma
tive action bake sale was modeled after a
similar action by UCLA Bruin Republi
cans and was aimed at demonstrating the
shortcomings and perceived injustices of
affirmative action. By pricing cookies dif
ferentially according to the race of the
buyer, the Stanford Republicans hoped to

help students consid
er whether in bene
fiting some, affirma
tive action harms
others. Last week,
the group quietly
changed its mind. We
are disappointed that
the Republicans
backed out on their
promise to con
tribute — visibly and
vocally — to campus
debate.
To start, the group
looked disengenous,
especially after last

don't have a voice and that their additions to
the campus debate are unwelcome. While
one can speculate to no end the reasons why
the Stanford Republicans cancelled their
bake sale, we exhort the Stanford Republi
cans not to withdraw from a possibly promi
nent role in the campus debate. Let everyone
be encouraged by the fact that the Students
for Educational Equity did not meet the
Stanford Republicans with fists and blows,
but with homemade cookies and brownies.
Indeed, the kinds of campus demonstrations
that have turned violent and unseemly at

week's counter-protest, "Freebake." Almost
immediately upon learning of the affirma
tive action bake sale, Students for Educa
tional Equity, led by sophomore Timmy Lu,
a member of the Stanford Asian American
Activism Coalition, mobilized the counter
action. While giving out free cookies and
brownies, the Students for Educational Eq
uity explained how the Republicans'
planned bake sale confused the intent of af
firmative action — to provide access — with
differential pricing of goods, more properly
an issue of market than political economics.
While the proposed demonstration was
aimed at attacking affirmative action by il
lustrating to students the alleged inequality
of the policy, the tactic unfairly offends stu-

other universities have
been peaceful here, il
lustrating a kind of
character far superior
than that trivialized in
retail politics.
We applaud all
Freebake participants
for their poised, lucid
and articulate manner
in presenting their
message to Stanford
students and to local
media. They have
raised the bar for those
who will follow in the
affirmative action de-

dents and promotes more anger than in
tellectual dialogue. Yet no political

rhetoric is incontrovertible, and
hence we anticipated the Republi
cans would continue in their plans
to hold the bake sale. By rejoining
the Students for Educational Equi
ty, we expected the Stanford Re
publicans to move campus dialogue
to a new dimension of diversity. Yet i
late last week, the Stanford Repub-1
licans cancelled their plans for their I
bake sale, declaring incongruously '
to their earlier publicity that
didn't want to "stir controversy."

Although the affirmative action
bake sale may not have been the best

way to promote dialogue about such a
monumental topic, we are concerned that
members of our community feel that they

bate on campus. Yet we believe the Stanford
Republicans are just as capable as anyone at
Stanford to rise to that occasion.
If beneath all the maneuvering the Stan
ford Republicans were trying to state simply
that affirmative action is not perfect, they
would have found sympathetic ears even
among their opponents. Had they proposed
a better solution, using methods equally
adroit as their proposed bake sale, they
might have persuaded many doubters. Had
they wished to communicate effectively, they
would have done much better to proffer sa
vory words rather than the UCLA Bruin Re
publican's bitter rhetoric disguised by a
promise of sweet goods.
