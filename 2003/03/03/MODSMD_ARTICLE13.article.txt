# LETS GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Sit down, you're rocking the boat 
### 
A lot of people focus on the
divisions in the Stanford
student body: male vs.
female, greek vs. non
greek and techie vs. fuzzy. But as
students, there is one aspect of our
lives that we all share: lecture.
Since this experience affects all of
us, we think the entire student
body would benefit if we all kept a
few tips in mind.
Before you even get to lecture,
there are decisions you can make
for the good of your classmates.
Rights to personal expression
aside, when you wake up, open
your closet and see that neon pink
overcoat or bright orange hunting
vest, just say no. It might have its
place somewhere (trust us, it
doesn't), but definitely abstain
from showcasing your "unique"
tastes in the lecture hall. And while
we are on the subject of fashion, lor
those of you ladies who feel obli
gated to treat every lecture like a
beauty pageant, no one is con
scious enough to be anything but
annoyed at the amount of time it
took to do your hair and makeup
before class.
Suddenly, you realize it is
Wednesday. Aren't you supposed
to be ditching class to hear about
how the potential war in Iraq is an
Israeli-Hoover Institution con
spiracy? That won't stop the over
achieving, competitive premed. It
probably won't stop Republicans,
Kuwaiti students or anyone who
values his or her $35,000-per-year
education either.
Assuming you've made the log
ical decision, your next challenge
will be to navigate your way
through the narrow passage be
tween the students fasting for
peace on one side and the free
cookie pushers on the other.
Odysseus had it easy.
Finally, you get off your bike,

finish locking it, descend into the
depths of the halls of learning and
now you are faced with a choice:
where do you sit? Gazing out into
the vast expanse of open seating,
you may be confused. Let us de
mystify the geography of the lec
ture room.
Everyone knows who sits in the
front and who sits in the back, but
we are going to illuminate the
shades of gray. Planning on a
dorm reunion with your old
friends in the middle of lecture? Sit

on the side, so that you don't have
to trample all over us. Are you a
loner? Take the middle so we don't
have to walk over you as we try to
get to our friends. Do you have a
small bladder or some other rea
son for escaping from lecture with
the professor mid-sentence? Save
yourself the embarrassment and
save us the annoyance; take an
aisle seat. And above all else, unless
your other option is the floor,
don't sit right next to someone you
don't know. Everyone abandoned
the naive notion of getting to know
people in lecture after the first
week of freshman year. Leave one
and only one buffer seat — any
thing more is just excessive.
Now that you are comfortable,
sit back, relax and take a deep
breath. Oh wait, here comes the
next lecture offense. Sure, you
get hungry and you have needs,
but do not indulge yourself with
aromatic cuisine in small, en

closed spaces. We can accept a
bagel and water, but the only
time the smell of a tuna salad
sandwich is acceptable is when
you are the one eating it.
So now you are furiously copy
ing down the blurry, out-of-focus,
wealth of information on the pro
jector, trying to finish before your
professor moves on to the next one
in a frenzy whose only rival is last
Saturday night's frantic scramble
as you heard your roommate's
keys in the door. Interrupting
your How is that c lueless, perpetu
ally tardy individual, hair askew,
appearing to have woken up about
two seconds before entering the
lecture hall. It's that guy who
shows up to your section maybe
twice the whole quarter. No notes,
no books, no backpack, just his
random remarks in tow. For all of
our late arrivals, take these two
pieces of advice: Sit in the back cor
ner as out of sight as possible, and
if something doesn't quite seem to
be making sense in lecture, consid
er the possibility that we just dis
cussed it for the last half hour.
Do you ever have a burning de
sire to ask a question during lec
ture? (We know you do, front
row!) The proper time for express
ing these urges in a constructive
manner is either during the break,
after class, or better yet, go to office
hours. In fact, we will expand this
policy to all types of interactive lec
ture behavior, including correct
ing obvious misstatements. With
that point, we conclude the lesson
for the day. Now please don't ask
us any questions because you will
just be keeping everyone else from
getting back to his or her life.

took to do your hair and makeup
before class.
Suddenly, you realize it is
Wednesday. Aren't you supposed
to be ditching class to hear about
how the potential war in Iraq is an
Israeli-Hoover Institution con
spiracy? That won't stop the over
achieving, competitive premed. It
probably won't stop Republicans,
Kuwaiti students or anyone who
values his or her $35,000-per-year
education either.
Assuming you've made the log
ical decision, your next challenge
will be to navigate your way
through the narrow passage be
tween the students fasting for
peace on one side and the free
cookie pushers on the other.
Odysseus had it easy.
Finally, you get off your bike,

finish locking it, descend into the
depths of the halls of learning and
now you are faced with a choice:
where do you sit? Gazing out into
the vast expanse of open seating,
you may be confused. Let us de
mystify the geography of the lec
ture room.
Everyone knows who sits in the
front and who sits in the back, but
we are going to illuminate the
shades of gray. Planning on a
dorm reunion with your old
friends in the middle of lecture? Sit

on the side, so that you don't have
to trample all over us. Are you a
loner? Take the middle so we don't
have to walk over you as we try to
get to our friends. Do you have a
small bladder or some other rea
son for escaping from lecture with
the professor mid-sentence? Save
yourself the embarrassment and
save us the annoyance; take an
aisle seat. And above all else, unless
your other option is the floor,
don't sit right next to someone you
don't know. Everyone abandoned
the naive notion of getting to know
people in lecture after the first
week of freshman year. Leave one
and only one buffer seat — any
thing more is just excessive.
Now that you are comfortable,
sit back, relax and take a deep
breath. Oh wait, here comes the
next lecture offense. Sure, you
get hungry and you have needs,
but do not indulge yourself with
aromatic cuisine in small, en

closed spaces. We can accept a
bagel and water, but the only
time the smell of a tuna salad
sandwich is acceptable is when
you are the one eating it.
So now you are furiously copy
ing down the blurry, out-of-focus,
wealth of information on the pro
jector, trying to finish before your
professor moves on to the next one
in a frenzy whose only rival is last
Saturday night's frantic scramble
as you heard your roommate's
keys in the door. Interrupting
your How is that c lueless, perpetu
ally tardy individual, hair askew,
appearing to have woken up about
two seconds before entering the
lecture hall. It's that guy who
shows up to your section maybe
twice the whole quarter. No notes,
no books, no backpack, just his
random remarks in tow. For all of
our late arrivals, take these two
pieces of advice: Sit in the back cor
ner as out of sight as possible, and
if something doesn't quite seem to
be making sense in lecture, consid
er the possibility that we just dis
cussed it for the last half hour.
Do you ever have a burning de
sire to ask a question during lec
ture? (We know you do, front
row!) The proper time for express
ing these urges in a constructive
manner is either during the break,
after class, or better yet, go to office
hours. In fact, we will expand this
policy to all types of interactive lec
ture behavior, including correct
ing obvious misstatements. With
that point, we conclude the lesson
for the day. Now please don't ask
us any questions because you will
just be keeping everyone else from
getting back to his or her life.
