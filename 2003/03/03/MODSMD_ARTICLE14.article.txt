Grade inflation calculations correct;
illustrate continuing problem
In a previous letter, "Study on grade
inflation based on dubious data,' (Feb.
24) Kenji Kushida notes that in an ear
lier version of my VVeb site, www.grade
inflation.com, it was stated that Stan
ford's data came strictly from under
graduate classes and suggests that I
may have deliberately made this error.
This error was not deliberate. Before I
published the data, I contacted an em
ployee at Stanford who knew the data
set in detail and asked if it was for un
dergraduates only. I received confir
mation that it was. After a Stanford
alumnus questioned me via e-mail, I
contacted my Stanford source again,
and was informed that the earlier con
firmation was incorrect. A correction
was promptly made on the Web site.
Kushida states that grade point aver
ages at Stanford from 1972 to 1992
were "virtually flat." This is not the
case. Like many colleges and universi
ties, grades at Stanford experienced
deflation from the early 1970s to the
early 1980s after a period of extreme

grade inflation during the Vietnam
War era. But in the early 1980s, they
bottomed out and began to rise again.
By 1991 they had risen by 4 percent
and were back to the early 1970s "high
water mark."
As was noted in a Stanford faculty
committee report, "For the 1992-93
academic year, the median letter grade
assigned in undergraduate courses was
A-." This rise and a desire to stem grade
inflation led Stanford faculty to enact
some grading reforms in the mid
-19905.
What are grades at Stanford today?
My Web site does not address this issue
and there are no publicly available data
on grading at Stanford past the 1992
academic year. But in a Nov. 14, 2001
editorial titled "Grade inflation should
be examined closely," The Daily stated
that, "There is no question that grade
inflation has occurred. Even in the past
decade, grades on this campus have in
creased by an average of 5 percent."
After a period of post-Vietnam defla
tion, Stanford apparently has experi
enced significant grade inflation for the
last two decades. The rate of inflation
indicated by the data publicly available
for Stanford and that indicated by The
Daily is in line with what has been ob
served at Harvard, Princeton, Duke,

Pomona, Carleton, Harvey Mudd and
elsewhere.

The Daily should strive to keep balanced
and objective reporting
I commend The Daily for publishing
Rachelle Marshall's sober and informa
tive letter 'Anti-Semitism is still alive
and well in this world today' (Feb. 20)
following several entries which reflect
ed the official Israeli perspective.
These submissions display the kind of
tactics employed by our current adminis
tration, purposely formulated to whip up
anxiety in order to gain support for its
policies. /Ml these items aim to generate a
heightened fear of anti-Semitism and to
create the assumption that Israel, which
possesses one of the most formidable mil
itary arsenals in the world — and backed
by the world's greatest superpower —
must fear for its existence. And from
whom? A so-called army of desperate
refugees, finally driven to bloody acts by
years of "brutal occupation," as Kofi
Annan's states and by a "force" of home
made pipe bombs and stone-throwing
children.

Daniel Jacob's letter, "Holding
Robinson accountable" (Feb. 18) im
pugning U.N. High Commissioner
Mary Robinson for failing to speak in
defense of "oppressed groups" also calls
for comment. During her Tuesday sym
posium, Robinson spoke openly about
her frustrating experience as she at
tempted to fulfill the duties of her office:
to observe and report on human rights
violations during the Israeli siege of the
Jenin Refugee Camp last April and May.
Just as she was departing from Geneva
for Jenin, accompanied by distinguished
South African Cyril Ramaphosa, she was
informed that the Israeli government
was denying her entry into Israel and
the West Bank, thereby making it im
possible for her to carry out her com
mission. Why was Robinson denied the
opportunity to report on what was tak
ing place? Had she been going there to
observe atrocities committed by Pales
tinians, would Robinson have been de
nied entry into Israel?
I trust that as the newspaper that
serves the entire Stanford community,
The Daily will be presenting balanced
and objective reporting on this ex
tremely grave issue.

Remembering Mr. Rogers
The day after Mr. Rogers died I was sit
ting at lunch lamenting his death with a lew
dorm mates. As I was admitting my sadness
over the departure of this childhood friend
the girl sitting across from me questioned
why everyone was so mournful about this
television personality's death. This was
clearly not a call to intelligent discussion and
deep soul searching but my friend's callous
comment resonated strongly in my mind.
Mr. Rogers served as a valuable compan
ion for me and many other preschool aged
kids. As an extremely hyperactive and trou
blesome preschooler, I found solace in Mr.
Rogers' gentle voice and comforting smile.
But before Friday I had not thought about
Mr. Rogers lor five or maybe even 10 years,
so now I am struggling with why his obituary
brings fresh tears to my eyes. I think on one
level I lament Mr. Rogers' loss because he be
lieved in and taught such wonderful ideas.
He taught children that people should
share, get along, be patient and be tolerant of
one another. These values seem as pertinent
now as ever — 1 can think of some very pow
erful people who could certainly use a sec
ond helping of Mr. Rogers' lessons.
I find his death so troubling not because
he was a sweet man and a moral beacon
(although he was both of these things), but
because lie was part of many of our child
hoods, and now he is no longer there. His
red cardigan was emblematic of our earli
est years, our youngest memories and
many our first and finest values.
And even if you haven't played "make
believe" games or ran around in the sprin
kler for nearly a decade, Mr. Rogers was al
ways there as a symbol of both our child
hoods and of simpler, more fantastical times.
His passing serves as just one more re
minder that that segment of our lives has
come to an end. But I have a hunch that Mr.
Rogers' simple, wholesome values and
imaginative spirit remain with us even if
those colorful puppets are just a hazy mem
ory. No matter how old wc get, part of us will
always be singing, "It's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neigh
borhood, won't you be my neighbor?"

violations during the Israeli siege of the
Jenin Refugee Camp last April and May.
Just as she was departing from Geneva
for Jenin, accompanied by distinguished
South African Cyril Ramaphosa, she was
informed that the Israeli government
was denying her entry into Israel and
the West Bank, thereby making it im
possible for her to carry out her com
mission. Why was Robinson denied the
opportunity to report on what was tak
ing place? Had she been going there to
observe atrocities committed by Pales
tinians, would Robinson have been de
nied entry into Israel?
I trust that as the newspaper that
serves the entire Stanford community,
The Daily will be presenting balanced
and objective reporting on this ex
tremely grave issue.

Remembering Mr. Rogers
The day after Mr. Rogers died I was sit
ting at lunch lamenting his death with a lew
dorm mates. As I was admitting my sadness
over the departure of this childhood friend
the girl sitting across from me questioned
why everyone was so mournful about this
television personality's death. This was
clearly not a call to intelligent discussion and
deep soul searching but my friend's callous
comment resonated strongly in my mind.
Mr. Rogers served as a valuable compan
ion for me and many other preschool aged
kids. As an extremely hyperactive and trou
blesome preschooler, I found solace in Mr.
Rogers' gentle voice and comforting smile.
But before Friday I had not thought about
Mr. Rogers lor five or maybe even 10 years,
so now I am struggling with why his obituary
brings fresh tears to my eyes. I think on one
level I lament Mr. Rogers' loss because he be
lieved in and taught such wonderful ideas.
He taught children that people should
share, get along, be patient and be tolerant of
one another. These values seem as pertinent
now as ever — 1 can think of some very pow
erful people who could certainly use a sec
ond helping of Mr. Rogers' lessons.
I find his death so troubling not because
he was a sweet man and a moral beacon
(although he was both of these things), but
because lie was part of many of our child
hoods, and now he is no longer there. His
red cardigan was emblematic of our earli
est years, our youngest memories and
many our first and finest values.
And even if you haven't played "make
believe" games or ran around in the sprin
kler for nearly a decade, Mr. Rogers was al
ways there as a symbol of both our child
hoods and of simpler, more fantastical times.
His passing serves as just one more re
minder that that segment of our lives has
come to an end. But I have a hunch that Mr.
Rogers' simple, wholesome values and
imaginative spirit remain with us even if
those colorful puppets are just a hazy mem
ory. No matter how old wc get, part of us will
always be singing, "It's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neigh
borhood, won't you be my neighbor?"

Grade inflation calculations correct;
illustrate continuing problem
In a previous letter, "Study on grade
inflation based on dubious data,' (Feb.
24) Kenji Kushida notes that in an ear
lier version of my VVeb site, www.grade
inflation.com, it was stated that Stan
ford's data came strictly from under
graduate classes and suggests that I
may have deliberately made this error.
This error was not deliberate. Before I
published the data, I contacted an em
ployee at Stanford who knew the data
set in detail and asked if it was for un
dergraduates only. I received confir
mation that it was. After a Stanford
alumnus questioned me via e-mail, I
contacted my Stanford source again,
and was informed that the earlier con
firmation was incorrect. A correction
was promptly made on the Web site.
Kushida states that grade point aver
ages at Stanford from 1972 to 1992
were "virtually flat." This is not the
case. Like many colleges and universi
ties, grades at Stanford experienced
deflation from the early 1970s to the
early 1980s after a period of extreme

grade inflation during the Vietnam
War era. But in the early 1980s, they
bottomed out and began to rise again.
By 1991 they had risen by 4 percent
and were back to the early 1970s "high
water mark."
As was noted in a Stanford faculty
committee report, "For the 1992-93
academic year, the median letter grade
assigned in undergraduate courses was
A-." This rise and a desire to stem grade
inflation led Stanford faculty to enact
some grading reforms in the mid
-19905.
What are grades at Stanford today?
My Web site does not address this issue
and there are no publicly available data
on grading at Stanford past the 1992
academic year. But in a Nov. 14, 2001
editorial titled "Grade inflation should
be examined closely," The Daily stated
that, "There is no question that grade
inflation has occurred. Even in the past
decade, grades on this campus have in
creased by an average of 5 percent."
After a period of post-Vietnam defla
tion, Stanford apparently has experi
enced significant grade inflation for the
last two decades. The rate of inflation
indicated by the data publicly available
for Stanford and that indicated by The
Daily is in line with what has been ob
served at Harvard, Princeton, Duke,

Pomona, Carleton, Harvey Mudd and
elsewhere.

The Daily should strive to keep balanced
and objective reporting
I commend The Daily for publishing
Rachelle Marshall's sober and informa
tive letter 'Anti-Semitism is still alive
and well in this world today' (Feb. 20)
following several entries which reflect
ed the official Israeli perspective.
These submissions display the kind of
tactics employed by our current adminis
tration, purposely formulated to whip up
anxiety in order to gain support for its
policies. /Ml these items aim to generate a
heightened fear of anti-Semitism and to
create the assumption that Israel, which
possesses one of the most formidable mil
itary arsenals in the world — and backed
by the world's greatest superpower —
must fear for its existence. And from
whom? A so-called army of desperate
refugees, finally driven to bloody acts by
years of "brutal occupation," as Kofi
Annan's states and by a "force" of home
made pipe bombs and stone-throwing
children.

Daniel Jacob's letter, "Holding
Robinson accountable" (Feb. 18) im
pugning U.N. High Commissioner
Mary Robinson for failing to speak in
defense of "oppressed groups" also calls
for comment. During her Tuesday sym
posium, Robinson spoke openly about
her frustrating experience as she at
tempted to fulfill the duties of her office:
to observe and report on human rights
violations during the Israeli siege of the
Jenin Refugee Camp last April and May.
Just as she was departing from Geneva
for Jenin, accompanied by distinguished
