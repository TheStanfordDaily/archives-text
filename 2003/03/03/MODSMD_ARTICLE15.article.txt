# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Excessive campus parking tickets oppressive, expensive 
### TIM MEYER GUEST COLUMNIST 
The funniest thing happened the other
day. Prior to a class of mine, a student who
had received a tic ket was complaining about
the Stanford police making their monthly
quota. This initial complaint snowballed into
a class-wide diatribe against the Stanford Po
lice. And then one student said the oddest
thing. "You know, in Europe, they don't hate
the police."
Is hating the police really just an Ameri
can pastime? Are jokes about donut-eating
cops as American as baseball and apple pie?
Are we unfair to the boys in blue (or gray, as
the case may be)? Are police forces in other
countries really respected more than they
are here?
Anyone with a cursory knowledge of
American pop culture knows that there is
something — if not unique, then at least spe
cial— about Americans' dislike for those
whose mission is to "Protect and Serve."
From angry song lyrics (Fs%# the cops!) to
caricatures on "The Simpsons" to protests
outside C -ity Hall in New York City after an
allegedly racist shooting, America's relation
ship with its law enforcement organs is

strained at best. But does this really extend to
our relationship with the benign Stanford
Police? Sure, they are cops, but they are the
cuddly kind, right? After all, they patrol a col
lege. They should be the self-effacing, goofy,
playful cops we always see on TV. Shouldn't
they?
The reality is that I would miss the Stan
ford Police about as much as a mean case of
hemorrhoids. Everyone knows about the
ridiculous notion of having different types of
student parking permits. Try to visit a friend
on the wrong side of campus and you get a
ticket from your helpful, cuddly Stanford
Community Service officer (and I use the
terms "service" and"officer" loosely). The in
competence of these so-called "officers" has
reached spectacular heights in the recent
weeks. On west campus, police began ticket
ing nightly on Santa Teresa Street. Several
students parked briefly outside of dorms for
unloading (with their hazard lights on to in
dicate the brief nature of their activity) have
received tickets. Another student received a
citation for expired registration tags, despite
the fact that his registration tags expire in
2004. A resident fellow 1 know was ticketed
twice in her own spot outside her cottage.
None of this, however, can top the activ

ities of Feb. 25, when police began ticketing
cars that were double-parked on Santa
Teresa. As any student that has ever parked
on Santa Teresa knows, the spots are drawn
big enough to park a houseboat. Consider
ing the parking shortage, students park as
many cars as possible in the allotted space,
without paying attention to the lines as they
are drawn. By so doing, students maximize
the number of safe parking spots (which
should be the job of the parking authori
ties). On the night in question, without
warning and in spite of years of this practice
being carried under the benevolent eye of
the Stanford Police, about a dozen cars
parked on Santa Teresa were ticketed. T he
funny thing is, each car only had a tire ex
tended into another ostensible parking spot
and had the proper permits. It is difficult to
see how these activities improve safety or
the quality of life on campus, which, of
course, is the only purpose for having a po
lice force at all.
It is time for the Stanford Police to begin
to take its mission seriously. The police de
partment should not feel the need to con
stantly remind the students that it exists. An
ad at the Shoreline movie theaters calls for
new recruits to the Stanford Police with a

starting salary of $57,000.1 vehemently dis
agree with paying glorified meter maids
that amount of money. If Stanford Police
and Community Service officers would like
to make a difference, they should get a job
in East Palo Alto or San Francisco. If they
want to stay at Stanford, the price they pay
for their inflated salary is the tedium of a col
lege campus and relative obscurity. As for
the administration, it is time that it recog
nized the harm that the Stanford police
does to the quality of life at Stanford. Stu
dents should not have to endure the op
pressive atmosphere officers create compli
cating an already awful parking situation. I,
for one, have paid so many parking tickets
during my four years here that I absolutely
refuse to even think about giving alumni
donations to this university, and 1 would
suggest that any students equally irritated
consider the same solution. If the Universi
ty cares so little about the students that it will
let the police's inferiority complex cost stu
dents thousands of dollars a year, then what
care should we have for the University?
Would we really want to fund the obscene
salaries of meter maids so that future gen
erations of Stanford students can pay thou
sands to Santa Clara County?

Naturally, the solution to many of these
problems lies in a competent administration,
something the police has proven itself unable
to provide. The parking spots on Santa Tere
sa could be redrawn diagonally to double the
number of spots on the street. The space !)e
-tween the curb and the street is certainly
large enough to allow for that. At the very
least, the lines should be drawn to reflect the
amount of space a car actually takes up, not
the amount taken up by a 747. To that end
senior Kara Becker started a petition enu
merating the concerns of the student body to
be presented to the Stanford policy some
time in the future. The petition garnered 150
signatures in the first hour and is gl owing.
Hopefully, this will encourage the police to
rethink the effectiveness of their tactics and
the execution of their mission on campus.
Another idea might be to create a commis
sion to examine parking laws and permits on
campus and actually put students on the
commission. Wouldn't it be a novelty to let
the brightest minds in the country solve their
own problems?

None of this, however, can top the activ

ities of Feb. 25, when police began ticketing
cars that were double-parked on Santa
Teresa. As any student that has ever parked
on Santa Teresa knows, the spots are drawn
big enough to park a houseboat. Consider
ing the parking shortage, students park as
many cars as possible in the allotted space,
without paying attention to the lines as they
are drawn. By so doing, students maximize
the number of safe parking spots (which
should be the job of the parking authori
ties). On the night in question, without
warning and in spite of years of this practice
being carried under the benevolent eye of
the Stanford Police, about a dozen cars
parked on Santa Teresa were ticketed. T he
funny thing is, each car only had a tire ex
tended into another ostensible parking spot
and had the proper permits. It is difficult to
see how these activities improve safety or
the quality of life on campus, which, of
course, is the only purpose for having a po
lice force at all.
It is time for the Stanford Police to begin
to take its mission seriously. The police de
partment should not feel the need to con
stantly remind the students that it exists. An
ad at the Shoreline movie theaters calls for
new recruits to the Stanford Police with a

starting salary of $57,000.1 vehemently dis
agree with paying glorified meter maids
that amount of money. If Stanford Police
and Community Service officers would like
to make a difference, they should get a job
in East Palo Alto or San Francisco. If they
want to stay at Stanford, the price they pay
for their inflated salary is the tedium of a col
lege campus and relative obscurity. As for
the administration, it is time that it recog
nized the harm that the Stanford police
does to the quality of life at Stanford. Stu
dents should not have to endure the op
pressive atmosphere officers create compli
cating an already awful parking situation. I,
for one, have paid so many parking tickets
during my four years here that I absolutely
refuse to even think about giving alumni
donations to this university, and 1 would
suggest that any students equally irritated
consider the same solution. If the Universi
ty cares so little about the students that it will
let the police's inferiority complex cost stu
dents thousands of dollars a year, then what
care should we have for the University?
Would we really want to fund the obscene
salaries of meter maids so that future gen
erations of Stanford students can pay thou
sands to Santa Clara County?

Naturally, the solution to many of these
problems lies in a competent administration,
something the police has proven itself unable
to provide. The parking spots on Santa Tere
sa could be redrawn diagonally to double the
number of spots on the street. The space !)e
-tween the curb and the street is certainly
large enough to allow for that. At the very
least, the lines should be drawn to reflect the
amount of space a car actually takes up, not
the amount taken up by a 747. To that end
senior Kara Becker started a petition enu
merating the concerns of the student body to
be presented to the Stanford policy some
time in the future. The petition garnered 150
signatures in the first hour and is gl owing.
Hopefully, this will encourage the police to
rethink the effectiveness of their tactics and
the execution of their mission on campus.
Another idea might be to create a commis
sion to examine parking laws and permits on
campus and actually put students on the
commission. Wouldn't it be a novelty to let
the brightest minds in the country solve their
own problems?

The funniest thing happened the other
day. Prior to a class of mine, a student who
had received a tic ket was complaining about
the Stanford police making their monthly
quota. This initial complaint snowballed into
a class-wide diatribe against the Stanford Po
lice. And then one student said the oddest
thing. "You know, in Europe, they don't hate
the police."
Is hating the police really just an Ameri
can pastime? Are jokes about donut-eating
cops as American as baseball and apple pie?
Are we unfair to the boys in blue (or gray, as
the case may be)? Are police forces in other
countries really respected more than they
are here?
Anyone with a cursory knowledge of
American pop culture knows that there is
something — if not unique, then at least spe
cial— about Americans' dislike for those
whose mission is to "Protect and Serve."
From angry song lyrics (Fs%# the cops!) to
caricatures on "The Simpsons" to protests
outside C -ity Hall in New York City after an
allegedly racist shooting, America's relation
ship with its law enforcement organs is

strained at best. But does this really extend to
our relationship with the benign Stanford
Police? Sure, they are cops, but they are the
cuddly kind, right? After all, they patrol a col
lege. They should be the self-effacing, goofy,
playful cops we always see on TV. Shouldn't
they?
The reality is that I would miss the Stan
ford Police about as much as a mean case of
hemorrhoids. Everyone knows about the
ridiculous notion of having different types of
student parking permits. Try to visit a friend
on the wrong side of campus and you get a
ticket from your helpful, cuddly Stanford
Community Service officer (and I use the
terms "service" and"officer" loosely). The in
competence of these so-called "officers" has
reached spectacular heights in the recent
weeks. On west campus, police began ticket
ing nightly on Santa Teresa Street. Several
students parked briefly outside of dorms for
unloading (with their hazard lights on to in
dicate the brief nature of their activity) have
received tickets. Another student received a
citation for expired registration tags, despite
the fact that his registration tags expire in
2004. A resident fellow 1 know was ticketed
twice in her own spot outside her cottage.
