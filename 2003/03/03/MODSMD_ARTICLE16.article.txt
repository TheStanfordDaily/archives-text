## Wild finish leaves 'Cats with victory 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An hour or so after No. 19 Stan
ford's 72-69 loss to No. 1 Arizona,
Maples Pavilion had been com
pletely transformed. Crowds
cleared quickly and trash was re
moved as nets went up at center
court for the men's volleyball
game that was scheduled to follow.
Men's Basketball
Saturday: No. 1 Arizona 72, No. 19
Stanford 69
vs. California, Saturday, 7 p.m.
And just like that, there were no
remnants of the episode that had
just unfolded, no traces of the hus
tle or intensity or heart that had
enraptured a capacity crowd only
minutes before — belying the fact
that a Pacific-10 Conference title
had just been claimed and lost in a
three-hour spectacle that came
down to the final breathtaking sec
onds.
Only moments earlier it was
real. And the reality of it is simple.
In front of a sellout crowd at
Maples Pavilion and a national
television audience, the Wildcats
were victorious over the Cardinal
to clinch the Pac-10 title.
The Stanford players had no
reason to hang their heads,
though. The Cardinal wasn't sup
posed to win, wasn't supposed to
even be in the running fora con
ference title with only two games
left to play.
No one expected anything
from this Stanford squad. But that
doesn't mean that the loss did not
sting.
"I think you have to like the
heart of these kids," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery
solemnly. "I think we can build on
this. They're disappointed but
they're not down."

And there are a lot of lessons for
Stanford to take away from this
game. Most importantly, the Car
dinal proved that it can compete
with the elite by coming within
three points of the nation's best
team despite shooting poorly.
"We're just happy to have the
title," Arizona coach Lute Olson
said. "[Stanford's] a very good
team, and they have a very good
team every year. They play every
one tough. They're never going to
beat themselves. You have to beat
them."
The two teams played each
other evenly in the second half,
each scoring 39 points. So what was
the difference?
In the first half, the Cardinal
shot a dismal 29 percent from the
field.
"1 thought we took a lot of shots
that we couldn't make," Mont
gomery explained. "We rushed a
lot of shots — that's the 29 per
cent."
Arizona senior Rick Anderson
hit a last-second 3-point shot to
close the first half, putting the Wild
cats up by three going into the lock
er room.
Further, Stanford missed 11 free
throws and went 4-for-22 from be
hind the 3-point arc.
But even with all that, the Cardi
nal still found itself down by only
three with two minutes left to play
when Arizona freshman Hassan
Adams scored a layup to put the
Wildcats up 66-63.
On the next trip down the court,
Stanford forward Nick Robinson
missed a 3-pointer and junior
Justin Davis grabbed the rebound
and was fouled. With the Cardinal
in the double-bonus, Davis stepped
to the charity stripe and connected
on one of two, bringing Stanford
back within two points.

Justin Davis jams the ball in the second half of Stanford's 72-69 loss to No. 1 Arizona. The Car
dinal kept the contest close throughout but could not gain the lead in the second half.
However, on the next posses
sion, Davis was whistled for his fifth
foul, sending sophomore Chan
ning Frye to the line. After Frye hit
the two free throws, sophomore
swingman Josh Childress knocked
down a tough 3-point shot on the
other end, bringing the score to 68-
67 in favor of Arizona with a minute
left to play.
Childress led all scorers with 20
points and also grabbed 10 re
bounds.
But Salim Stoudamire answered
(again) with a 15-foot jumpshot to
move the score to 70-67 with 44 sec
onds left on the clock.
He led Arizona is scoring with
18 points but, more importantly,
every time the Cardinal looked as
if it was about to put a run togeth
er, Stoudamire came through, hit
ting tough junipers and slashing
layups.
After a Stanford miss on the next
possession, Matt Lottich quickly
fouled Stoudamire to stop the
clock, and the sophomore hit both
free throws to put Arizona up by
five with 25 seconds left on the
clock.
Barnes then pushed the ball up
the court and found Rob Little in
transition for the open layup. After
a Cardinal timeout, Jason Haas
fouled Anderson, putting him on
the line to shoot the one-and-one.
However, Anderson missed the
free thi 'ow with 18 seconds left and
Stanford rebounded.
Opting not to call a timeout, the
Cardinal pushed the ball up the
court. With seven seconds remain
ing, Childress put up a contested 3-
point shot that just missed.
Robinson grabbed the rebound

and found a wide-open Barnes out
on the perimeter. However,
Barnes' 3-point shot was just long,
and the buzzer sounded.
"When it left my hand I thought
it was going in," Barnes said. "But it
was just long."
Stanford's final offensive
stretch was like a microcosm of the
entire game. The shots were there
but just didn't seem to fall, as the
Cardinal trailed for the entire sec
ond half.
"We got some good shots in the
second half but they just didn't go
down," Barnes explained. "We've
been in a lot of close games. This
was nothing new. [But] nobody's
hanging their heads because [Ari
zona's] the No. 1 team in the land.
We played our hearts out."
Even so, an hour after Stanford's
"not-so-devastating" loss to the
Wildcats, no evidence of the his
toric struggle remained.
Just memories, visions of what
could have been and a volleyball
game left to play.
