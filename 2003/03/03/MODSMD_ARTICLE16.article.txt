## Wild finish leaves 'Cats with victory 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An hour or so after No. 19 Stan
ford's 72-69 loss to No. 1 Arizona,
Maples Pavilion had been com
pletely transformed. Crowds
cleared quickly and trash was re
moved as nets went up at center
court for the men's volleyball
game that was scheduled to follow.
Men's Basketball
Saturday: No. 1 Arizona 72, No. 19
Stanford 69
vs. California, Saturday, 7 p.m.
And just like that, there were no
remnants of the episode that had
just unfolded, no traces of the hus
tle or intensity or heart that had
enraptured a capacity crowd only
minutes before — belying the fact
that a Pacific-10 Conference title
had just been claimed and lost in a
three-hour spectacle that came
down to the final breathtaking sec
onds.
Only moments earlier it was
real. And the reality of it is simple.
In front of a sellout crowd at
Maples Pavilion and a national
television audience, the Wildcats
were victorious over the Cardinal
to clinch the Pac-10 title.
The Stanford players had no
reason to hang their heads,
though. The Cardinal wasn't sup
posed to win, wasn't supposed to
even be in the running fora con
ference title with only two games
left to play.
No one expected anything
from this Stanford squad. But that
doesn't mean that the loss did not
sting.
"I think you have to like the
heart of these kids," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery
solemnly. "I think we can build on
this. They're disappointed but
they're not down."

And there are a lot of lessons for
Stanford to take away from this
game. Most importantly, the Car
dinal proved that it can compete
with the elite by coming within
three points of the nation's best
team despite shooting poorly.
"We're just happy to have the
title," Arizona coach Lute Olson
said. "[Stanford's] a very good
team, and they have a very good
team every year. They play every
one tough. They're never going to
beat themselves. You have to beat
them."
The two teams played each
other evenly in the second half,
each scoring 39 points. So what was
the difference?
In the first half, the Cardinal
shot a dismal 29 percent from the
field.
"1 thought we took a lot of shots
that we couldn't make," Mont
gomery explained. "We rushed a
lot of shots — that's the 29 per
cent."
Arizona senior Rick Anderson
hit a last-second 3-point shot to
close the first half, putting the Wild
cats up by three going into the lock
er room.
Further, Stanford missed 11 free
throws and went 4-for-22 from be
hind the 3-point arc.
But even with all that, the Cardi
nal still found itself down by only
three with two minutes left to play
when Arizona freshman Hassan
Adams scored a layup to put the
Wildcats up 66-63.
On the next trip down the court,
Stanford forward Nick Robinson
missed a 3-pointer and junior
Justin Davis grabbed the rebound
and was fouled. With the Cardinal
in the double-bonus, Davis stepped
to the charity stripe and connected
on one of two, bringing Stanford
back within two points.
