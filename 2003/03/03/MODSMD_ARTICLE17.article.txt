The Stanford women's basketball team
did what it needed to do in its last regular
season game — win on the road and gain
some momentum going into the I'acific-10
tournament next weekend. A 63-53 victo
ry over Arizona State on Saturday, howev
er, did not entirely erase weaknesses ex
posed in recent road losses at No. 24 Ari
zona and Washington.
In those games, the Cardinal shot poor

the intensity of the home team.
The regular season has revealed one
glaring fact — the Cardinal is a much bet
ter team at home.
Stanford (23-4, 15-3) has won 25
straight games overall at Maples Pavilion
dating back to December 2001, a Division
I home winning streak second only to Con
necticut.
The fact that the first four rounds of the

west regional NCAA tournament bracket
will be held at Maples is clearly an incredi
ble advantage for the Cardinal.
"They like to play at home," UCLA
coach Kathy Olivier said. "It will be an ob
vious advantage for them in the regionals.
They play with more confidence at home."
The Cardinal is not the only team that
plays with more confidence at home. Ari
zona State, a team with only one senior, is
6-3 in Tempe, but 1-8 on the road.
On Saturday, however, Arizona State
(15-12, 7-11) simply did not create
enough offense to beat a more talented
Cardinal team. Against Stanford's
league-leading defense, the Sun Devils
shot a dismal 36.2 percent and managed
only 53 points.
The four teams that have beaten the
Cardinal this year have all shot at least 43
percent from the field and scored at least
70 points.
Stanford got down 10-3 early but tight
ened up its offensive execution and
outscored Arizona State 30-11 for the rest
of the period to take a 12-point halftime
lead. Sun Devils' freshman Jill Noe, a two
lime Pac-10 player of the week (that's one
more than Nicole Powell this season), was a
non-factor, managing just six points in 30
minutes on 1 -5 shooting.
Powell, on the other hand, was the most
influential factor in the game. She scored a
game-high 2fi points, grabbed a game
high eight rebounds and dished out 6 as
sists. Arizona State committed nine fouls
tlying to stop Powell.
No other Stanford player hit double fig
ures.
"Nicole is doing things that no one else
can do," VanDerveer said.
Arizona State's Carrie Buckner, who
committed four fouls guarding Powell,
had plenty of praise for her opponent.
"[Powelll uses her height well and she
has good body control," she said. "I
mean, it's tough when I feel like I dig in
and 1 really don't have the height to block
her shot."
I n preparation for the grueling postsea
son, VanDerveer seems to have added
freshman Krista Rappahahn to her core
player rotation. Rappahahn had been
playing well of late but managed only 3
