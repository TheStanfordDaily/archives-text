Declawing Wildcats can be a difficult ordeal.
The No. 8 Stanford women's gymnastics team (9-2-
1, 5-1-1 Pacific-10 conference) kicked up a sandstorm
in the desert to hand No. 17 Arizona (4-7, 1-4) its first
loss in Tucson of the season.
Despite enjoying the home-gym advantage and
notching a record-breaking night as a team on three
events, the Wildcats were edged by the Cardinal
196.950-196.850.
"It was a great tight," sophomore Mandy Delgado
said. "There were some great improvements in this
meet, with better execution, harder skills and stuck
landings. We also competed some of the best vaults this
team has ever executed."
The Cardinal's night began on the uneven bars,
which saw freshman Natalie Foley chalk up a 9.975, a
career-high score that was good for first on the appara
tus. Junior Caroline Fluhrer's performance took sec
ond with a career-high 9.950 to put Stanford ahead by
0.225 at the end of the first rotation.
The Cardinal then carried its momentum over to
post a record-setting set on vault, capitalizing on the
Wildcats' lackluster performance on the table by taking
the top five scores on the event.
"We did a great job building scores on vault, and we
had a lot of stuck landings, allowing us to break our
team vault record for the second straight weekend,"ju
nior Shell) Goldberg said.
Junior Kendall Beck, a 2002 All-American on vault,
led the attack with a 9.950 to win top honors on the
event. Foley, Goldberg and junior Lise Leveille tied for
second with 9.9005, and freshman Jessica Louie's 9.825
rounded out the top five.
The floor exercise had been a struggle for Stanford
all season, but that changed Friday night.
"We really improved our level of performance and
energy on floor this weekend," Goldberg said. "Jessica
Louie had a great routine, including a huge full twist
ing double back which she competed for the first time
this season."
Delgado added, "Jessica's awesome floor routine re
ally brought the excitement up to another level."
Fhe Cardinal's lead extended on floor, as the team
delivered a season-high 49.300 and Foley and Leveille
tied for third with scores 0f9.900.
As Stanford headed to the balance beam for the last
rotation, Arizona rallied on floor with a 49.500 and per
formances that took first and second on the apparatus
