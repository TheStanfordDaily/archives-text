# Cardinal batters rival USC
## 
### DAN URBAN STAFF WRITER 
I hc Trojans left Sunken Diamond on
Sunday the same way their legendary name
sakes tied the city of Troy — utterly van
quished.
Ti lings had started out so well for Southern
California. Having belted three homers and
taken advantage of six (Cardinal errors on Fri
day night, the Trojans cruised to a 13-4 win.
The game remained close through the
first three innings, as senior Ryan Garko and
sophomore Danny Putnam hit back-to-back
doubles as part of a three-run rally in the
third, but a steady stream of unanswered Tro
jan runs followed.
Stanford junior John Hudgins (3-1) suf
fered his first loss of the season, giving up six
earned runs in as many innings.
Hudgins was relieved by sophomore
Mark Jecmen, who walked two and gave up
two earned runs without retiring a single bat
ter before turning the ball over to junior
Drew Khrlich.
Ehrlich dealt two innings without allowing
any earned runs, but the damage had already
been done, and the Cardinal dropped its first
game of Pac-10 play to its perennial rival for

the conference title.
However, the momentum of the three
game series would turn very quickly.
The Cardinal came out on Saturday after
noon with a score to set tie and immediately
went to work on USC starter Fraser Dizard,
who lasted just one third of an inning after
being lit .up for six runs.
"It was huge after last night's tough loss to
get six runs in the first inning," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "I expected our
team to come back and play hard. We battled
today and did a good job."
I he toj) of the Cardinal order let the of
fensive charge with a combined seven hits. Ju
niors Brian 1 fall and Sam Fuld were hitting in
the one and two spots and went 3-4 and 4-5,
respectively.
Fuld — arguably the Cardinal's most reli
able hitter last year — had started this season
in a slump, and seeing his bat back in action is
a welcome sight fora Stanford team hoping to
be a contender in ()maha.

hitting so far this year, "but it definitely was a mo
mentum-builder. I hope I can keep it going."

16 USC. Stanford took two out of three from the Trojans over the weekend.
nal, driving in three, while senior
Tobin Swope, Putnam, freshman
John Mayberry, junior Carlos
Quentin and Hall each added at
least one RBI.
While a string of USC pitchers
trotted from the bullpen to the
mound to try to stop the Cardinal
bats, Stanford senior Ryan McCally
held the Trojans almost scoreless for
the better part of seven innings.
McCally scattered three runs over
seven and two thirds innings lor the
win, while junior David O'Hagan
finished the game to earn the save.
Unfortunately for the USC
hurlers, the Cardinal offense was
just getting warmed up.
Sunken Diamond's largest crowd
of the season had the double pleasure
of a warm afternoon and an 18-4 Car
dinal hammering of the Trojans.
Putnam drove in seven runs, six
of them from two consecutive
three-run homers.
"I felt really comfortable at the
plate and was seeing the ball well
today," said a modest Putnam of his
back-to-back blasts.
Hall, Mayberry and freshman
Chris Lewis also homered in what
was undoubtedly the Cardinal's
biggest display of its power behind
the plate so far diis season.
"It was nice to get some longballs

today," Marquess said. "The two
three-run homers by Danny Put
nam were obviously the key shots,
and it was big for us to come back
and win the final two games of the
series after Friday night's loss."
Garko continued his run-pro
duction for the Cardinal, as both he
and Mayberry had three RBl's.
Mayberry also hit a triple, his
fourth of the season and extended
his hitting streak to 11 games.
"I hoped to try to prove myself
early in my career," Mayberry said.
Mission accomplished. Mayberry
has hit saf ely in all but one of the Car
dinal's 18 games.
The Trojans were never able to
put together more than two runs in
one inning, much less match the
Cardinal's scoring ban age.
With Stanford's third starting
pitching spot still not entirely settled,
freshman Mark Romanzcuk got the
nod for Sunday's game and made a
good case for himself .
Romanczuk improved to 4-0 on
the season, allowing four runs in six
innings. Fellow freshman Mark
Manship finished the game by thor
oughly shutting down the Trojan
lineup, giving up just one hit and no
runs while striking out four.
Having rallied from a Friday loss
to take a series win over its biggest
conference rival, the Cardinal
opened its Pac-10 season in dramat
ic fashion and will look to carry its
momentum into its next weekend's
home series versus California.

Stanford junior John Hudgins (3-1) suf
fered his first loss of the season, giving up six
earned runs in as many innings.
Hudgins was relieved by sophomore
Mark Jecmen, who walked two and gave up
two earned runs without retiring a single bat
ter before turning the ball over to junior
Drew Khrlich.
Ehrlich dealt two innings without allowing
any earned runs, but the damage had already
been done, and the Cardinal dropped its first
game of Pac-10 play to its perennial rival for

the conference title.
However, the momentum of the three
game series would turn very quickly.
The Cardinal came out on Saturday after
noon with a score to set tie and immediately
went to work on USC starter Fraser Dizard,
who lasted just one third of an inning after
being lit .up for six runs.
"It was huge after last night's tough loss to
get six runs in the first inning," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "I expected our
team to come back and play hard. We battled
today and did a good job."
I he toj) of the Cardinal order let the of
fensive charge with a combined seven hits. Ju
niors Brian 1 fall and Sam Fuld were hitting in
the one and two spots and went 3-4 and 4-5,
respectively.
Fuld — arguably the Cardinal's most reli
able hitter last year — had started this season
in a slump, and seeing his bat back in action is
a welcome sight fora Stanford team hoping to
be a contender in ()maha.
Tm obviously not satisfied," said Fuld of his
hitting so far this year, "but it definitely was a mo
mentum-builder. I hope I can keep it going."

nal, driving in three, while senior
Tobin Swope, Putnam, freshman
John Mayberry, junior Carlos
Quentin and Hall each added at
least one RBI.
While a string of USC pitchers
trotted from the bullpen to the
mound to try to stop the Cardinal
bats, Stanford senior Ryan McCally
held the Trojans almost scoreless for
the better part of seven innings.
McCally scattered three runs over
seven and two thirds innings lor the
win, while junior David O'Hagan
finished the game to earn the save.
Unfortunately for the USC
hurlers, the Cardinal offense was
just getting warmed up.
Sunken Diamond's largest crowd
of the season had the double pleasure
of a warm afternoon and an 18-4 Car
dinal hammering of the Trojans.
Putnam drove in seven runs, six
of them from two consecutive
three-run homers.
"I felt really comfortable at the
plate and was seeing the ball well
today," said a modest Putnam of his
back-to-back blasts.
Hall, Mayberry and freshman
Chris Lewis also homered in what
was undoubtedly the Cardinal's
biggest display of its power behind
the plate so far diis season.
"It was nice to get some longballs

today," Marquess said. "The two
three-run homers by Danny Put
nam were obviously the key shots,
and it was big for us to come back
and win the final two games of the
series after Friday night's loss."
Garko continued his run-pro
duction for the Cardinal, as both he
and Mayberry had three RBl's.
Mayberry also hit a triple, his
fourth of the season and extended
his hitting streak to 11 games.
"I hoped to try to prove myself
early in my career," Mayberry said.
Mission accomplished. Mayberry
has hit saf ely in all but one of the Car
dinal's 18 games.
The Trojans were never able to
put together more than two runs in
one inning, much less match the
Cardinal's scoring ban age.
With Stanford's third starting
pitching spot still not entirely settled,
freshman Mark Romanzcuk got the
nod for Sunday's game and made a
good case for himself .
Romanczuk improved to 4-0 on
the season, allowing four runs in six
innings. Fellow freshman Mark
Manship finished the game by thor
oughly shutting down the Trojan
lineup, giving up just one hit and no
runs while striking out four.
Having rallied from a Friday loss
to take a series win over its biggest
conference rival, the Cardinal
opened its Pac-10 season in dramat
ic fashion and will look to carry its
momentum into its next weekend's
home series versus California.
