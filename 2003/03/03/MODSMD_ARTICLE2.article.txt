# Stanford puts hold on 2003 wage increases
## Temporary measure comes weeks after large fiscal loss reported 
### VAUHINI VARA STAFF WRITER 
Most Stanford employees will
not receive pay raises this Septem
ber, Provost John Etchemendy an
nounced last week in an e-mail to
faculty and staff. By freezing the
salaries of about 8,700 workers in
the upcoming fiscal year, the Uni
versity hopes to save $7 to $8 mil
lion in general funds.
The announcement came three
weeks after the University report
ed significant losses for the 2002
fiscal year. In his letter,
Etchemendy said that the decision
was necessitated by the weak per

formance of the stock market, a
volatile health care environment,
increasing financial need and high
construction-related costs.
"These are not insurmountable
problems, and they pose no risk to
the fundamental strength of our
university," he wrote. "But it will
take effort and innovation to bal
ance our budget in the next fiscal
year while continuing to support
the top-quality education and re
search for which Stanford is
known."
This is the first time in recent
history that a salary freeze has
been implemented. In the past few
years, Stanford employees have
received salary increases ranging
from 3 percent to 7 percent, said
Randy Livingston, the University's
vice president for business affairs
and chief financial officer. Liv
ingston said that it is very unlikely

that the salary freeze will last for
more than one year.
Although faculty members
were disappointed by
Etchemendy's announcement,
many saw it coming.
"The Provost has been saying
publicly for at least four months
that the University is in tough bud
get conditions and that this up
coming year was going to be a dif
ficult one," said Law Prof. Hank
Greely, chair of the Faculty Senate.
"I think many people saw the writ
ing on the wall."
Greely pointed out that the
salary freeze would impact each
employee differently.
"A tenured member of the law
faculty is not likely to be affected
very much," he said. "But fora
brand-new assistant professor in
the English department, 3 per
cent might have been very impor

tant. Fora newly hired staff mem
ber doing work in maintenance or
grounds, it could make a huge
difference."
English Prof. Ramon Saldivar
said he has received a raise every
year since arriving at Stanford 11
years ago.
"It's very unusual for there not
to be an increase," he said, adding
that typically, almost every faculty
member gets a salary increase..
Saldivar pointed out that a
salary freeze actually amounts to a
pay cut, when inflation is taken
into account.
"It's a net loss; you lose pur
chasing power," he said.
So far, none of Stanford's peer
institutions have cut performance
based raises, although many of
them are adjusting their budgets

in other ways to deal with budget
challenges.
"They're having to undertake
a number of adjustments as well,"
Livingston said, pointing out that
Duke and Dartmouth have been
particularly open about their fi
nancial troubles. "In our in
stance, we looked at how compet
itive our salaries are, relative to
the market."
For die most part, Stanford's
salaries are competitive. Faced
with the possibility of having to lay
off workers, Etchemendy decided
that a salary freeze would be the

best way to cut costs.
Livingston said that each de
partment would have funds to ad
dress recruitment and retention is
sues and to make up for market in
equities. There will also be a small
bonus program.
Greely said he felt that
Etchemendy made a difficult, but
wise, decision.
"If (here were layoffs, some
people's salaries would go from
100 percent to 0 percent," he said.
"That's a lot different from going
from a planned 103 percent to 100
percent."
Unionized and contracted
workers won't be affected by the
salary freeze as they negotiate
contracts separately with the
University.
