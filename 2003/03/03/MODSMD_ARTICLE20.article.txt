### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 6 Stanford men's
tennis team (7-2) sent four pairs to compete
in one of the most prestigious tournaments
in tennis, the 114 th Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships in La Jolla, Calif.
Started in 1890, it is one of the longest
running tennis tournaments in the country.
Past champions include such tennis immor
tals as Don Budge, Bobby Riggs, Arthur
Ashe and John McEnroe. Although it is not
an official college event and does not count
toward the college rankings, the majority of
the teams entering hailed from college
squads.
Stanford freshmen KC Corkery and
James Pade (ranked No. 18 in the nation)
put in the Cardinal's best showing, advanc
ing to the semifinals before losing to the
eventual champions, Oliver Maiberger and
Ryan Redondo from San Diego State (No.
6).
Seeded No. 7 in the tournament draw's
bottom half (each half of the draw had pairs
seeded 1-8), Corkery and Pade upset two
higher-seeded teams in the round of 16 and
quarterfinals.
After winning their first two matches in
straight sets, they dispatched the bottom
draw's No. 1 seeds, Adriano Biasella and
Peter Smith, in convincing fashion, 6-2, 6-4.
Next they took down the No. 4 seeds, Pep
perdine's Diego Acuna and Calle Hansen
(No. 33 in the nation), 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Corkery and Pade's impressive run
through the draw ended on Sunday in the
semifinal round when they lost to Maiberg

er and Redondo 6-3, 6-3. The San Diego
State pair dominated the tournament, win
ning every match decisively. The six games
won by the Cardinal duo was the most that
Maiberger and Redondo lost in any match
all weekend.
"The match was closer than the score,"
Pade said. "We really had a ton of opportu
nities. We had chances to break them every
time they served, but we had a little trouble
putting points away. Overall, we're happy
with the way the tournament went. We had
a lot of fun."
Senior Ail-Americans David Martin and
Scott Lipsky, the No. 3 ranked team in the
nation, were the No. 1 seeds in the tourna
ment draw's top half. Martin and Lipsky
won their first three matches in straight sets
to easily advance to the quarterfinals.
In the quarterfinal round, USC's Daniel
Langre and Ruben Torres upset the Cardi
nal pair, 6-4, 6-2.
"We weren't as sharp as we've been in the
past, but they played very well," Lipsky
said.
Sophomore Sam Warburg and Junior
Carter Morris won their first match before
being edged by the top half s No. 2 seeds,
Shuon Madden and Ryan Newport 7-6(6),
3-6, 6-2.
"They just played the crucial points bet
ter than we did," Warburg said. "We had a
3-0 lead in the first set, but we let it get away
from us."
Sophomore Phil Sheng and Junior Joe
Kao narrowly lost to Notre Dame's Brian
Farrell and Luis Haddock 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 in
