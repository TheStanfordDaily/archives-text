## Second-place finish for Stanford includes eight NCAA qualifications 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference swim
ming and diving title was within the
grasp of most of the competing
schools in this past weekend's con
ference championship, but no one
would have guessed that the cham
pion would be the team that didn't
win a single event in the three days of
competition.
UCLA managed to reign over the
fierce competition, racking up 1,399
points, despite not winning any
events. Stanford took second place
in the competition with five wins and
1,308 points, well ahead of third
place Southern California.
"UCLA did a fantastic job," Car
dinal coach Richard Quick said.
"They won with depth .. . They had

so many swimmers in the consola
tion finals, and that's what made the
difference between us and them in
the meet."
USC also turned in an impressive
set of performances over the week
end, recording four swimming wins
antl a sweep of the three diving
events by junior Blythe Hartley.
The highlight for Stanford was a
pair of dominating performances
from junior Tara Kirk. Kirk won the
100-yard breaststroke and broke her
own American record in the event
(58.68 seconds) by .27 seconds in the
process. Kirk also narrowly missed
breaking another of her own Amer
ican records by .001 seconds in the
200 breaststroke, which she won
with a time 0f2:07.37.
"I wasn't surprised by the 200,"
Quick said, "But to be honest, I was
surprised by the 100. 112 guess I didn't
know she could go that fast."
Kirk teamed up on the first day of
competition with sophomores Lacey
Boutwell and Amy Wagner, as well
as freshman Dana Kirk, to win the

400 medley relay race, recording an
NCAA qualifying time.
Boutwell, who anchored the race,
also recorded a time of 22.86 in the
50 freestyle, which qualifies her for
nationals. She also swam a leg of the
200 freestyle relay along with junior
Megan Baumgartner, sophomore
Sarah Jones and freshman Ashley
Daly, and the team captured third
place and clocked in at a season-best
in the event.
Sophomore diver Ashlee Rosen
thal put in a big performance in the
1-meter competition, coming in sec
ond behind USC's Hartley with
310.95 points.
Stanford also had two other top
-10 1-meter finishes, with senior
McKenze Murphy placing seventh
and sophomore Lauren Donovan
placing 10th.
On day two of competition, the
Cardinal took its second relay win, as
Dana Kirk, Tara Kirk, Wagner and
Jones won the 200 medley relay with
a time of 1:38.80.
The younger Kirk, Wagner and

Jones all qualified for NCAA compe
tition with individual performances
during the day: Kirk in the 100 fly,
and Wagner and Jones in the 100
back.
"This was a career breakthrough
meet for Sarah (Jones)," Quick said.
"She swam very well."
Rosenthal dove well again in the
3-meter contest, scoring 507.35
points and coming in third behind
two Trojans. Murphy also per
formed well, placing fourth with
488.75 points. Freshmen Sara Bowl
ing and Michaela Skloven rounded
out the Cardinal's top-10 divers,
placing eighth and 10th, respective
