# International spotlight
## El Salvador 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
David Bloch, a junior majoring in economics
and international relations, is a native of El
Salvador. Located on the Pacific side of
Central America south of Guatemala, El
Salvador is a small country in the process of redefin
ing itself after a turbulent past, marked by a 12-year
civil war that pitted a U.S.-backed right-wing gov
ernment against socialist guerrillas. While the coun
try has found lasting political peace since the war
ended in 1992, nearly a quarter of the population has
immigrated to the United States, seeking jobs to sup
port their families back home.
The Daily: Could you talk about your experiences
growing up in El Salvador, things that you feel are
important about your country?
David Bloch: El Salvador is a very small country in
Central America, the smallest country in Latin Anier-,
ica, and one of the most densely populated as welf.
The country has had a tormented past, with a civil
war, and Hurricane Mitch and two major earth
quakes, most recently. I grew up there all the way up
until my life here at Stanford.
During my first 10 years, up until 1992, El Sal
vador was involved in a civil war, a pretty bloody civil
war between communist guerrillas and the military
that I still remember. 1989 particularly comes to
mind when the guerrillas took over San Salvador, the
capital city. It was the closest the country ever came
to becoming communist. The United States sent a lot
of military aid [to the rightist government] during
this time, as they had been doing since the war began
in 1980. Whole neighborhoods were bombed by the
military, eventually causing the guerrillas' retreat. . .
Besides that, after the war it's been very, very
peaceful — I would say it's one of the closest-to-per
fect examples of a peace accord [signed by the war
ring sides in 1992] really being implemented and re
ally legitimizing the democratic process. The country
has opened up its borders and lately has really shift
ed to a capitalist model, because of three straight gov
ernments of the right, which are very similar to the
Republican right in the United States. We've even
dollarized. Last year, 2000-2001, the country
switched its currency completely to the dollar.
Though controversial, it shows the opening of the
country and the Americanization in a sense — which
has its benefits and negative aspects.
TD: F rom your perspective within the country, do
you see an increase in wealth for all social classes, or
some social classes? How is the neo-liberal model af
fecting the country?
DB: Historically, the country has been one of the
most unequal [in Latin America] because of the same

economics of the country. It's been an agrarian coun
try. The land-owning class has been very small, and
they . . . exploited a lot of the masses.
Nowadays, the country has switched from an
agrarian economy to a mare export- and service-ori
ented one, where m;tfjuilas,i.he sweatshops, are be
coming an increasing souk* of revenue. These
sweatshops are very controversial, however. I feel
that the country has the fadpsftgrowing middle class
in America due to ilr increase, the boom, the
dollaffeation, the services,Jeducation. So there has
been some redistribution»here's a lot more to go.
to when jpe country's oxifluftiv was
based on &griculturejjfliere was no midnleclass, be
cause it was the land(Tw I ners / and the peasants. Nws,
as you have services ancpfou diversify the economy,
you can have a middje'class.
In that sense, th£ country has developed success
fully. On the other hand, there are still a lot of proh»

lems. There is still an ethnic problem — it's still very
much divided, like everywhere in Latin Ameri
ca ... In general, however, it's improving; I am very
optimistic. Even maquilas, sweatshops, which are
very controversial in the States — if you go J.O El Sal
vador, you talk to a maquila worker, they wift tell you
that, even though they don't love their job, because
it's not the best job in the world — they know that
there are jobs which get better pay with less vvorK —v
but they're happy to have a job. They kiKvvP tljirt
there are certain restraints on what the government
can do and cannot do, and the government just can
not provide employment to so, so many people.
We're 6 million people in 20,000 square kilometers.
You just can't create employment, you just can't go
from an agricultural economy, which needs
economies of scale and a lot of land, which we don't
have, to a maquila, with everybody having great jobs.
These people like their jobs because it gives them an
opportunity to climb up the social ladder. And I
think the results are being seen.
TD: How is the leftist party in El Salvador — the
Farabundo Marti Liberacion National, who were
formerly armed revolutionaries — taking part in the
current political process, especially in relation to
trade liberalization negotiations?
DB: They have been involved because they have a

say. Especially in the last four years, the FMLN has
liacl control over the mayorship of San Salvador
[and | about half of the national assembly, which is the
legislative branch. They have had some say, and al
though the executive branch, which is 112 rom the right,
has in a lot of ways overcome them, they have raised
a lot of issues which are important — at least for dis
cussion.
The problem with the FMLN is that the FMLN is
very divided between orthodox Marxist-Leninist ide
ology and a progressive [ideology] — people who
want a capitalism with more redistributional effects:
social capitalism. Even then, the FMLN has been very
accepting. They've allowed some trade liberalization
to occur, but they've also tried to constrain other
pijrts that the executive, or the right, has wanted. For
eramble, the privatization of [the] health sector,
wmch the president [Francisco Flores] tried to do six
months 0o was blocked by the FMLN. Even dollar-

izati* Ji was very controversial for the FMLN, the pri
mal being that the country would lose its
sovereignty. But they have been a political force, and
it's important that they've been an opposition group;
theyW provided an alternative for the people.
TD: cLtild you talk about how the issues of Sal
vadorean immigration to the U.S., and discussions
surrounding the Central American Free Trade
Agreement, relate to the issues discussed above and
other?" i !***>—-<*
n < sr
I)B: First of all, is very
imporfhat. We're dependent on wejiave 6 4
million lyalvaduoeans in El i>,«iilli<j£ in
the U.S. iWsl rcent of
cent of ouPGDP money sent from
Salvadoreans in tliewhich sustains thousands
of people back hoqf&. Sirwe immigration
but we have to understantPtftal the U.S. cannot jiift
open immigration for everyone. You can't just go in
and ask for open borders. The country has worked
closely with the American government to get prefer
ence in immigration policy in exchange for political
support. . .
The CAFTA, 1 think, is very exciting for the coun
try. It's very controversial. . . I think it will bring a lot
of benefits — first of all opening our borders ... We
have to realize that we are a very small country, and

even though we have a lot of great things, we really
need to open our borders to exploit our qualities, our
best characteristics, to really find out what we have an
advantage in and really produce that.
It's important fora couple reasons. It forces us to
open up with Central America. Central America used
to be one country . . . and now it's about time that we
unite and really work a* a region because the world
sees Central America as a region, not as individual
countries . ..
TD: How is current U.S. foreign polity, in relation to
the Bush administration's work with Central Ameri
ca in the war on terror, now affecting El Salvador?
DB: To El Salvador it relates because we are such a
small country, and we are so dependent on the U.S.
As a country, El Salvador will never oppose any of the
U.S.'s policies.
However, as an international student, I think
that most [of us] can understand a lot of things
about American foreign policy, and it's, in a lot of
ways, very one-sided. 1 think that the Americans fail
to see or understand why events happen. You
know, there you have September 11th, there you
have a lot of events where Americans ask them
selves: Why? Why us? What have we done? And
they don't realize that these are the natural conse
quences to the foreign policy of previous govern
ments and even Bush.
In El Salvador, we lived it. They [the U.S. gov
ernment] financed our civil war that had 80,000 to
90,000 dead and horrible human rights abuses,
everything you can think of. And when you see
Bush, it's frustrating to see that even September
lltli did not change the mentality — that even
with something so big, the U.S. government did
not say "Let's try to understand why this hap
pened, and how we can change." And they're say
ing, "You hit me, I hit you harder," and violence
leads to more violence. An eye for an eye and the
whole world goes blind. The U.S. has to under
jptand that it was their same actions that created
monsters that turned against them. This vi
cious cycle will only stop when people realize what
Jney are doing.
™ The United States cannot use their double-stan
dards and expect support from the rest of the world.
There's even a lot of policies with trade liberalization
that show the U.S.'s double standards. The govern
ment claims to champion tree trade but at the same
time holds protectionist policies of the U.S. — the
agricultural subsidies, steel tariffs, etc. Europe has
them as well; I'm not blaming only the U.S. I think it
should be a moral duty for developed countries to as
sume an impartial role where development under
equal rules is the goal.

David Bloch: El Salvador is a very small country in
Central America, the smallest country in Latin Anier-,
ica, and one of the most densely populated as welf.
The country has had a tormented past, with a civil
war, and Hurricane Mitch and two major earth
quakes, most recently. I grew up there all the way up
until my life here at Stanford.
During my first 10 years, up until 1992, El Sal
vador was involved in a civil war, a pretty bloody civil
war between communist guerrillas and the military
that I still remember. 1989 particularly comes to
mind when the guerrillas took over San Salvador, the
capital city. It was the closest the country ever came
to becoming communist. The United States sent a lot
of military aid [to the rightist government] during
this time, as they had been doing since the war began
in 1980. Whole neighborhoods were bombed by the
military, eventually causing the guerrillas' retreat. . .
Besides that, after the war it's been very, very
peaceful — I would say it's one of the closest-to-per
fect examples of a peace accord [signed by the war
ring sides in 1992] really being implemented and re
ally legitimizing the democratic process. The country
has opened up its borders and lately has really shift
ed to a capitalist model, because of three straight gov
ernments of the right, which are very similar to the
Republican right in the United States. We've even
dollarized. Last year, 2000-2001, the country
switched its currency completely to the dollar.
Though controversial, it shows the opening of the
country and the Americanization in a sense — which
has its benefits and negative aspects.
TD: F rom your perspective within the country, do
you see an increase in wealth for all social classes, or
some social classes? How is the neo-liberal model af
fecting the country?
DB: Historically, the country has been one of the
most unequal [in Latin America] because of the same

economics of the country. It's been an agrarian coun
try. The land-owning class has been very small, and
they . . . exploited a lot of the masses.
Nowadays, the country has switched from an
agrarian economy to a mare export- and service-ori
ented one, where m;tfjuilas,i.he sweatshops, are be
coming an increasing souk* of revenue. These
sweatshops are very controversial, however. I feel
that the country has the fadpsftgrowing middle class
in America due to ilr increase, the boom, the
dollaffeation, the services,Jeducation. So there has
been some redistribution»here's a lot more to go.
to when jpe country's oxifluftiv was
based on &griculturejjfliere was no midnleclass, be
cause it was the land(Tw I ners / and the peasants. Nws,
as you have services ancpfou diversify the economy,
you can have a middje'class.
In that sense, th£ country has developed success
fully. On the other hand, there are still a lot of proh»

lems. There is still an ethnic problem — it's still very
much divided, like everywhere in Latin Ameri
ca ... In general, however, it's improving; I am very
optimistic. Even maquilas, sweatshops, which are
very controversial in the States — if you go J.O El Sal
vador, you talk to a maquila worker, they wift tell you
that, even though they don't love their job, because
it's not the best job in the world — they know that
there are jobs which get better pay with less vvorK —v
but they're happy to have a job. They kiKvvP tljirt
there are certain restraints on what the government
can do and cannot do, and the government just can
not provide employment to so, so many people.
We're 6 million people in 20,000 square kilometers.
You just can't create employment, you just can't go
from an agricultural economy, which needs
economies of scale and a lot of land, which we don't
have, to a maquila, with everybody having great jobs.
These people like their jobs because it gives them an
opportunity to climb up the social ladder. And I
think the results are being seen.
TD: How is the leftist party in El Salvador — the
Farabundo Marti Liberacion National, who were
formerly armed revolutionaries — taking part in the
current political process, especially in relation to
trade liberalization negotiations?
DB: They have been involved because they have a

say. Especially in the last four years, the FMLN has
liacl control over the mayorship of San Salvador
[and | about half of the national assembly, which is the
legislative branch. They have had some say, and al
though the executive branch, which is 112 rom the right,
has in a lot of ways overcome them, they have raised
a lot of issues which are important — at least for dis
cussion.
The problem with the FMLN is that the FMLN is
very divided between orthodox Marxist-Leninist ide
ology and a progressive [ideology] — people who
want a capitalism with more redistributional effects:
social capitalism. Even then, the FMLN has been very
accepting. They've allowed some trade liberalization
to occur, but they've also tried to constrain other
pijrts that the executive, or the right, has wanted. For
eramble, the privatization of [the] health sector,
wmch the president [Francisco Flores] tried to do six
months 0o was blocked by the FMLN. Even dollar-

izati* Ji was very controversial for the FMLN, the pri
mal being that the country would lose its
sovereignty. But they have been a political force, and
it's important that they've been an opposition group;
theyW provided an alternative for the people.
TD: cLtild you talk about how the issues of Sal
vadorean immigration to the U.S., and discussions
surrounding the Central American Free Trade
Agreement, relate to the issues discussed above and
other?" i !***>—-<*

but we have to understantPtftal the U.S. cannot jiift
open immigration for everyone. You can't just go in
and ask for open borders. The country has worked
closely with the American government to get prefer
ence in immigration policy in exchange for political
support. . .
The CAFTA, 1 think, is very exciting for the coun
try. It's very controversial. . . I think it will bring a lot
of benefits — first of all opening our borders ... We
have to realize that we are a very small country, and

even though we have a lot of great things, we really
need to open our borders to exploit our qualities, our
best characteristics, to really find out what we have an
advantage in and really produce that.
It's important fora couple reasons. It forces us to
open up with Central America. Central America used
to be one country . . . and now it's about time that we
unite and really work a* a region because the world
sees Central America as a region, not as individual
countries . ..
TD: How is current U.S. foreign polity, in relation to
the Bush administration's work with Central Ameri
ca in the war on terror, now affecting El Salvador?
DB: To El Salvador it relates because we are such a
small country, and we are so dependent on the U.S.
As a country, El Salvador will never oppose any of the
U.S.'s policies.
However, as an international student, I think
that most [of us] can understand a lot of things
about American foreign policy, and it's, in a lot of
ways, very one-sided. 1 think that the Americans fail
to see or understand why events happen. You
know, there you have September 11th, there you
have a lot of events where Americans ask them
selves: Why? Why us? What have we done? And
they don't realize that these are the natural conse
quences to the foreign policy of previous govern
ments and even Bush.
In El Salvador, we lived it. They [the U.S. gov
ernment] financed our civil war that had 80,000 to
90,000 dead and horrible human rights abuses,
everything you can think of. And when you see
Bush, it's frustrating to see that even September
lltli did not change the mentality — that even
with something so big, the U.S. government did
not say "Let's try to understand why this hap
pened, and how we can change." And they're say
ing, "You hit me, I hit you harder," and violence
leads to more violence. An eye for an eye and the
whole world goes blind. The U.S. has to under
jptand that it was their same actions that created
monsters that turned against them. This vi
cious cycle will only stop when people realize what
Jney are doing.
™ The United States cannot use their double-stan
dards and expect support from the rest of the world.
There's even a lot of policies with trade liberalization
that show the U.S.'s double standards. The govern
ment claims to champion tree trade but at the same
time holds protectionist policies of the U.S. — the
agricultural subsidies, steel tariffs, etc. Europe has
them as well; I'm not blaming only the U.S. I think it
should be a moral duty for developed countries to as
sume an impartial role where development under
equal rules is the goal.
David Bloch, a junior majoring in economics

Central America south of Guatemala, El

to becoming communist. The United States sent a lot
of military aid [to the rightist government] during
this time, as they had been doing since the war began
in 1980. Whole neighborhoods were bombed by the
military, eventually causing the guerrillas' retreat. . .
Besides that, after the war it's been very, very
peaceful — I would say it's one of the closest-to-per
fect examples of a peace accord [signed by the war
ring sides in 1992] really being implemented and re
ally legitimizing the democratic process. The country
has opened up its borders and lately has really shift
ed to a capitalist model, because of three straight gov
ernments of the right, which are very similar to the
Republican right in the United States. We've even
dollarized. Last year, 2000-2001, the country
switched its currency completely to the dollar.
Though controversial, it shows the opening of the
country and the Americanization in a sense — which
has its benefits and negative aspects.
TD: F rom your perspective within the country, do
you see an increase in wealth for all social classes, or
some social classes? How is the neo-liberal model af
fecting the country?
DB: Historically, the country has been one of the
most unequal [in Latin America] because of the same

economics of the country. It's been an agrarian coun
try. The land-owning class has been very small, and
they . . . exploited a lot of the masses.
Nowadays, the country has switched from an
agrarian economy to a mare export- and service-ori
ented one, where m;tfjuilas,i.he sweatshops, are be
coming an increasing souk* of revenue. These
sweatshops are very controversial, however. I feel
that the country has the fadpsftgrowing middle class
in America due to ilr increase, the boom, the
dollaffeation, the services,Jeducation. So there has
been some redistribution»here's a lot more to go.
to when jpe country's oxifluftiv was
based on &griculturejjfliere was no midnleclass, be
cause it was the land(Tw I ners / and the peasants. Nws,
as you have services ancpfou diversify the economy,
you can have a middje'class.
In that sense, th£ country has developed success
fully. On the other hand, there are still a lot of proh»

lems. There is still an ethnic problem — it's still very
much divided, like everywhere in Latin Ameri
ca ... In general, however, it's improving; I am very
optimistic. Even maquilas, sweatshops, which are
very controversial in the States — if you go J.O El Sal
vador, you talk to a maquila worker, they wift tell you
that, even though they don't love their job, because
it's not the best job in the world — they know that
there are jobs which get better pay with less vvorK —v
but they're happy to have a job. They kiKvvP tljirt
there are certain restraints on what the government
can do and cannot do, and the government just can
not provide employment to so, so many people.
We're 6 million people in 20,000 square kilometers.
You just can't create employment, you just can't go
from an agricultural economy, which needs
economies of scale and a lot of land, which we don't
have, to a maquila, with everybody having great jobs.
These people like their jobs because it gives them an
opportunity to climb up the social ladder. And I
think the results are being seen.
TD: How is the leftist party in El Salvador — the
Farabundo Marti Liberacion National, who were
formerly armed revolutionaries — taking part in the
current political process, especially in relation to
trade liberalization negotiations?
DB: They have been involved because they have a

say. Especially in the last four years, the FMLN has
liacl control over the mayorship of San Salvador
[and | about half of the national assembly, which is the
legislative branch. They have had some say, and al
though the executive branch, which is 112 rom the right,
has in a lot of ways overcome them, they have raised
a lot of issues which are important — at least for dis
cussion.
The problem with the FMLN is that the FMLN is
very divided between orthodox Marxist-Leninist ide
ology and a progressive [ideology] — people who
want a capitalism with more redistributional effects:
social capitalism. Even then, the FMLN has been very
accepting. They've allowed some trade liberalization
to occur, but they've also tried to constrain other
pijrts that the executive, or the right, has wanted. For
eramble, the privatization of [the] health sector,
wmch the president [Francisco Flores] tried to do six
months 0o was blocked by the FMLN. Even dollar-

izati* Ji was very controversial for the FMLN, the pri
mal being that the country would lose its
sovereignty. But they have been a political force, and
it's important that they've been an opposition group;
theyW provided an alternative for the people.
TD: cLtild you talk about how the issues of Sal
vadorean immigration to the U.S., and discussions
surrounding the Central American Free Trade
Agreement, relate to the issues discussed above and
other?" i !***>—-<*
n < sr
I)B: First of all, is very
imporfhat. We're dependent on wejiave 6 4
million lyalvaduoeans in El i>,«iilli<j£ in
the U.S. iWsl rcent of
cent of ouPGDP money sent from
Salvadoreans in tliewhich sustains thousands
of people back hoqf&. Sirwe immigration
but we have to understantPtftal the U.S. cannot jiift
open immigration for everyone. You can't just go in
and ask for open borders. The country has worked
closely with the American government to get prefer
ence in immigration policy in exchange for political
support. . .
The CAFTA, 1 think, is very exciting for the coun
try. It's very controversial. . . I think it will bring a lot
of benefits — first of all opening our borders ... We
have to realize that we are a very small country, and

even though we have a lot of great things, we really
need to open our borders to exploit our qualities, our
best characteristics, to really find out what we have an
advantage in and really produce that.
It's important fora couple reasons. It forces us to
open up with Central America. Central America used
to be one country . . . and now it's about time that we
unite and really work a* a region because the world
sees Central America as a region, not as individual
countries . ..
TD: How is current U.S. foreign polity, in relation to
the Bush administration's work with Central Ameri
ca in the war on terror, now affecting El Salvador?
DB: To El Salvador it relates because we are such a
small country, and we are so dependent on the U.S.
As a country, El Salvador will never oppose any of the
U.S.'s policies.
However, as an international student, I think
that most [of us] can understand a lot of things
about American foreign policy, and it's, in a lot of
ways, very one-sided. 1 think that the Americans fail
to see or understand why events happen. You
know, there you have September 11th, there you
have a lot of events where Americans ask them
selves: Why? Why us? What have we done? And
they don't realize that these are the natural conse
quences to the foreign policy of previous govern
ments and even Bush.
In El Salvador, we lived it. They [the U.S. gov
ernment] financed our civil war that had 80,000 to
90,000 dead and horrible human rights abuses,
everything you can think of. And when you see
Bush, it's frustrating to see that even September
lltli did not change the mentality — that even
with something so big, the U.S. government did
not say "Let's try to understand why this hap
pened, and how we can change." And they're say
ing, "You hit me, I hit you harder," and violence
leads to more violence. An eye for an eye and the
whole world goes blind. The U.S. has to under
jptand that it was their same actions that created
monsters that turned against them. This vi
cious cycle will only stop when people realize what
Jney are doing.
™ The United States cannot use their double-stan
dards and expect support from the rest of the world.
There's even a lot of policies with trade liberalization
that show the U.S.'s double standards. The govern
ment claims to champion tree trade but at the same
time holds protectionist policies of the U.S. — the
agricultural subsidies, steel tariffs, etc. Europe has
them as well; I'm not blaming only the U.S. I think it
should be a moral duty for developed countries to as
sume an impartial role where development under
equal rules is the goal.
