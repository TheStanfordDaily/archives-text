# Students meet on Fridays to fast for peace
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At noon on Feb. 21, graduate student
Suchitra Sebastian sat alone and quiet on
the steps at the far end of White Plaza.
She gazed out over her fellow students as
they hastened off to eat lunch, but she
would not join them in their midday
meal. Sebastian was fasting for peace
from sunrise to sunset.
Throughout the course of the day,
she would he joined by about 10 other

tasters from various backgrounds in
what organizer Jessica Jenkins, a senior,
described as "a gesture of solidarity to
show support for those who suffer from
war."
The fast also took place this past Fri
day, and will continue every Friday in
White Plaza for an indefinite period of
time.
For sophomore Brian Denny, the fast
is a political protest much like the Janu
ary peace march he attended in San
Francisco with several dozen Stanford

students and what police estimated to In*
100,000 people.
"Fasting is just a voice, its awareness,
it's having people drop by and attracting
their attention," Denny said.
For Sebastian and Jenkins, howev
er, the fast is more than a means of po
litical expression; it is an act of per
sonal introspection.
"Being part of a movement like the
peace march in San Francisco is striking

and powerful," Jenkins said. "But
you need a kind of quieter and
more reflective or meditative space
to bring it back to a personal level."
The fast for peace is not affiliat
ed with any specific campus orga
nization. Jenkins said that the fast
was an "open invitation to include
people who wouldn't necessarily
be activists but want a personal way
to protest."
Jenkins explained that fasting
was a form of prayer which fo
cused her thoughts and enhanced
her ability to relate to people who
suffer on a daily basis.
"The biblical conception of a
fast lies in not letting yourself be
too caught up in the business of
everyday things of the world, par
ticularly at Stanford where you're
always running around with too
many things to do," Sebastian
said as she looked up at bikes
whizzing past, two women solicit
ing pedestrians with fliers for an
evening gymnastics meet, and a
man belting out, "Lulu tickets for
sale!"

"Fasting gives you the space to
ask, 'What are we busy about?' and
'For how many people in the
world is this [going without food]
not unusual?' " Jenkins said. "It in
creases your empathy for those
who would suffer from war."
That empathy and awareness of
suffering is something which
Americans, and particularly stu
dents at Stanford, comparatively
lack with respect to people of other
nations, Sebastian said.
• International students com
prise 19 percent of undergraduate
and graduate students at Stanford,
but they accounted for 50 percent
of the fasters last Friday. Sebastian
is Indian; another faster, sopho
more Sonya I'etkova, is Bulgarian,
and Jenkins reported that one
Mexican and two Singaporean stu
dents also participated. Jenkins,
an American who studied abroad
in El Salvador, said that almost all
the Americans who fasted on Fri

day had experienced life in a
Third World country.
"American individualism has a
good sense, but a bad sense," said
Sebastian as Petkova nodded in
agreement. "It's like a cocoon
where you do what takes care of
you and are not connected with
what's outside."
Sebastian continued, "In other
parts of the world, even if you are
not an activist or you don't partic
ularly care about foreign affairs,
you're still aware of the reality in
the outside world where it's not
about things that affect your
grades or your salary. In other
places, you know people who
wrestle with survival everyday."
Jenkins and Sebastian ex
pressed hope that the on-campus
fast each Friday will establish a reg
ular presence to make Stanford
students aware of that reality.
Jenkins was inspired to orga
nize the fast at Stanford after lis
tening to a Dominican priest speak
about his 28-day fast on the streets
of New York at an on-campus pre
sentation the previous Sunday.
During his speech, the Rev. Jim
Barnett related the response of a
protester who was asked whether
he thought his actions would actu
ally change government policy.
According to Barnett, the pro
tester said, "I'm not here to change
the government, I'm here so that
they don't change me."
Sebastian echoed his words.
"A lot of people say that we're
not going to change anything by
fasting, or protesting for that mat
ter, so they ask why we even both
er," she said. "But, if you believe in
something, then you have to stand
for it, even if that just means talk
ing to people about it."
A supporter of military action to
disarm Iraqi President Saddam 1 lus
sein, junior David Kale, said he ad
mired people who fasted for peace.
"In terms of getting your voice
out, it may not be as effective a
means of protest as standing in the
middle of a highway with a sign,
but as far as making a difference in
your own sphere of the world, I
think it can make a real impact,"
he said.

students aware of that reality.
Jenkins was inspired to orga
nize the fast at Stanford after lis
tening to a Dominican priest speak
about his 28-day fast on the streets
of New York at an on-campus pre
sentation the previous Sunday.
During his speech, the Rev. Jim
Barnett related the response of a
protester who was asked whether
he thought his actions would actu
ally change government policy.
According to Barnett, the pro
tester said, "I'm not here to change
the government, I'm here so that
they don't change me."
Sebastian echoed his words.
"A lot of people say that we're
not going to change anything by
fasting, or protesting for that mat
ter, so they ask why we even both
er," she said. "But, if you believe in
something, then you have to stand
for it, even if that just means talk
ing to people about it."
A supporter of military action to
disarm Iraqi President Saddam 1 lus
sein, junior David Kale, said he ad
mired people who fasted for peace.
"In terms of getting your voice
out, it may not be as effective a
means of protest as standing in the
middle of a highway with a sign,
but as far as making a difference in
your own sphere of the world, I
think it can make a real impact,"
he said.
At noon on Feb. 21, graduate student
Suchitra Sebastian sat alone and quiet on
the steps at the far end of White Plaza.
She gazed out over her fellow students as
they hastened off to eat lunch, but she
would not join them in their midday
meal. Sebastian was fasting for peace
from sunrise to sunset.
Throughout the course of the day,
she would he joined by about 10 other

tasters from various backgrounds in
what organizer Jessica Jenkins, a senior,
described as "a gesture of solidarity to
show support for those who suffer from
war."
The fast also took place this past Fri
day, and will continue every Friday in
White Plaza for an indefinite period of
time.
For sophomore Brian Denny, the fast
is a political protest much like the Janu
ary peace march he attended in San
Francisco with several dozen Stanford

students and what police estimated to In*
100,000 people.
"Fasting is just a voice, its awareness,
it's having people drop by and attracting
their attention," Denny said.
For Sebastian and Jenkins, howev
er, the fast is more than a means of po
litical expression; it is an act of per
sonal introspection.
"Being part of a movement like the
peace march in San Francisco is striking

and powerful," Jenkins said. "But
you need a kind of quieter and
more reflective or meditative space
to bring it back to a personal level."
The fast for peace is not affiliat
ed with any specific campus orga
nization. Jenkins said that the fast
was an "open invitation to include
people who wouldn't necessarily
be activists but want a personal way
to protest."
Jenkins explained that fasting
was a form of prayer which fo
cused her thoughts and enhanced
her ability to relate to people who
suffer on a daily basis.
"The biblical conception of a
fast lies in not letting yourself be
too caught up in the business of
everyday things of the world, par
ticularly at Stanford where you're
always running around with too
many things to do," Sebastian
said as she looked up at bikes
whizzing past, two women solicit
ing pedestrians with fliers for an
evening gymnastics meet, and a
man belting out, "Lulu tickets for
sale!"

"Fasting gives you the space to
ask, 'What are we busy about?' and
'For how many people in the
world is this [going without food]
not unusual?' " Jenkins said. "It in
creases your empathy for those
who would suffer from war."
That empathy and awareness of
suffering is something which
Americans, and particularly stu
dents at Stanford, comparatively
lack with respect to people of other
nations, Sebastian said.
• International students com
prise 19 percent of undergraduate
and graduate students at Stanford,
but they accounted for 50 percent
of the fasters last Friday. Sebastian
is Indian; another faster, sopho
more Sonya I'etkova, is Bulgarian,
and Jenkins reported that one
Mexican and two Singaporean stu
dents also participated. Jenkins,
an American who studied abroad
in El Salvador, said that almost all
the Americans who fasted on Fri

day had experienced life in a
Third World country.
"American individualism has a
good sense, but a bad sense," said
Sebastian as Petkova nodded in
agreement. "It's like a cocoon
where you do what takes care of
you and are not connected with
what's outside."
Sebastian continued, "In other
parts of the world, even if you are
not an activist or you don't partic
ularly care about foreign affairs,
you're still aware of the reality in
the outside world where it's not
about things that affect your
grades or your salary. In other
places, you know people who
wrestle with survival everyday."
Jenkins and Sebastian ex
pressed hope that the on-campus
fast each Friday will establish a reg
ular presence to make Stanford
students aware of that reality.
