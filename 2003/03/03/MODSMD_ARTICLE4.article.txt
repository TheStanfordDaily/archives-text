## Cot garlic? 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alan has always loved garlic, so his de
cision to eat garlic sandwiches six days a
week was a relatively easy one. The hard
part was giving up roasted garlic and
cheese for dinner.
"It's one of the best flavors on the
planet," he said of the strong garnish.
Alan, a 43-year old salesman from San
Mateo, is a volunteer in a new Stanford
study to test whether consuming raw
garlic on a daily basis will help lower cho
lesterol. For privacy reasons, Alan asked

that only his first name Ik* used.
Alan suffers from moderately high
levels of LDL or "bad cholesterol" and
was not doing a very good job of control
ling it.
"It's made me focus more on my
diet," he said of his participation in the
study. "I decided to do the study because
I wanted to make a conscious effort."
The new garlic study is led by (Christo
pher Gardner, an assistant professor of
medicine and a researcher at the Stan
ford Center for Research Disease and
Prevention.
"Traditional Chinese medicine

mashed up the garlic to give to people,"
Gardner said. "In the U.S., wejust made
pills. We may have lost something when
they did that."
Gardner is passionate about his work,
and it shows in his workplace. The cen
ter of his office is full of garlic. Three gar
lic bulbs hang on the door, tilling the
room witli a pungent smell, and large
photos of garlic, soybeans and peppers
decorate the room.
Gardner is not the first to be interest
ed in the health effects of garlic, but he is
one of the first to be interested in
the fresh form of the plant. Over a
dozen previous studies concluded
that garlic ottered little or no sig
nificant benefit, said Gardner, but
they all looked at garlic in the pill
form.
"Why do one more [study]?" he
asked. "Well, we're challenging
the studies belbre based on what
the biochemist analyzed. No one
took on fresh garlic before."
The biochemist is Larry Law
son. a co-investigator in the Stan
ford study and a long-time garlic
researcher. Lawson noticed a flaw
in traditional ways of measuring
the health effects of garlic. Nor
mally, when garlic is chewed or
chopped, an enzyme releases the
active ingredient allicin. But Law
son noticed that comparable
amounts of allicin are not released
when garlic is in pill form.
Herbal supplement companies
typically mix their supplements in
water to see if allicin is still present
after the pill dissolves. Lawson
thought this method was Hawed.
He took the same supplements,
but tested them in a simulation of a
human digestive tract. Lawson

found that pills either dissolve in
the stomach, where the allicin en
zyme becomes inactive, or pass
through the body without being
dissolved at all.
When Gardner discovered
Lawson's work, he saw the possi
bility for creating a new study,
based around fresh garlic and
the supplements Lawson found
to be most potent when digested.
Recently, their project proposal
received a $1.5 million grant
from the National Institutes of
1 lealth.
In preparation for his study,
Gardner went to Gilroy, also
known as the garlic capital of the
world, to get garlic from the
wholesale market.
"It's the same thing consumers
buy," he said.
Keeping true to consumer ten
dencies will be especially impor
tant for future practical applica
tions of the study. Already on any
given day, 18 percent of Ameri
cans eat at least one food contain
ing garlic, and each household
consumes 2.5 pounds of garlic
every year. But many Americans
depend on garlic supplements, not
fresh garlic, for their daily dose of
allicin.
Gardner bought 100 pounds
of the Early Spring California va
riety. Alter preparing the garlic,

the research team then spent two
weeks trying out different sand
wiches for the garlic, an effort that
was part science and part culinary
art. Gardner wanted a variety so
participants would not have to eat
the same sandwich repeatedly,
and the final list of sandwiches
ranged from grilled vegetable
and panino di portobello to
Southwestern tortilla wrap. Along
with their sandwich, every partic
ipant receives a small portion of
the garlic condiment spread and a
bottle of supplemental pills â€” but
they are not told if the condi
ments or the supplements have
garlic in them.
"We never tell them, we just as
sume they'll figure it out," Gard
ner said. Me added that, because of
the strong taste and smell, "I as
sume 99 percent will figure out
that they get the fresh garlic."
There are very narrow para
meters for participation in the
study. Every volunteer must be
between 30 and 65 years old with
elevated levels of LDL choles
terol. They also must be willing to
come to campus twice a week for
six months to pick up their sand
wiches.
"You get smarter people who
are proactive and who want to
make life better," Gardner said of
his subjects.

Alan is typical of the partici
pants. Alan's cholesterol levels
were high enough to be worri
some, but not high enough to war
rant medication. He decided to
participate as both a conscious ef
fort to lower his cholesterol and as
a contribution to science, he said.
"It's an opportunity to do some
thing for myself and for others," he
said.
Alan was among the first group
of participants in the project,
which will continue for four years.
Alan has finished half of his six
month commitment.
"The hardest part is sometimes
you just don't want to eat what
they gave you," he said. "Even
though there is variety, the hardest
part is the lack of variety."
Despite his months of participa
tion, Alan is still unsure whether he
is receiving the garlic in his sand
wiches
"There are days I can smell it,"
he said. "I honestly don't know.
There are days my body feels full
of garlic and days t hat I don't."
Regardless of whether he is get
ting garlic, Alan said the study has
helped him focus on his health. As
for the odor, Alan said it does not
bother him, but he likes to make
sure that his breath is fresh.
"I'm in sales so I use mints and
gum all the time," he said.

of garlic and days t hat I don't."
Regardless of whether he is get
ting garlic, Alan said the study has
helped him focus on his health. As
for the odor, Alan said it does not
bother him, but he likes to make
sure that his breath is fresh.
"I'm in sales so I use mints and
gum all the time," he said.
Alan has always loved garlic, so his de
cision to eat garlic sandwiches six days a
week was a relatively easy one. The hard
part was giving up roasted garlic and
cheese for dinner.
"It's one of the best flavors on the
planet," he said of the strong garnish.
Alan, a 43-year old salesman from San
Mateo, is a volunteer in a new Stanford
study to test whether consuming raw
garlic on a daily basis will help lower cho
lesterol. For privacy reasons, Alan asked

that only his first name Ik* used.
Alan suffers from moderately high
levels of LDL or "bad cholesterol" and
was not doing a very good job of control
ling it.
"It's made me focus more on my
diet," he said of his participation in the
study. "I decided to do the study because
I wanted to make a conscious effort."
The new garlic study is led by (Christo
pher Gardner, an assistant professor of
medicine and a researcher at the Stan
ford Center for Research Disease and
Prevention.
"Traditional Chinese medicine

mashed up the garlic to give to people,"
Gardner said. "In the U.S., wejust made
pills. We may have lost something when
they did that."
Gardner is passionate about his work,
and it shows in his workplace. The cen
ter of his office is full of garlic. Three gar
lic bulbs hang on the door, tilling the
room witli a pungent smell, and large
photos of garlic, soybeans and peppers
decorate the room.
Gardner is not the first to be interest
ed in the health effects of garlic, but he is
one of the first to be interested in
the fresh form of the plant. Over a
dozen previous studies concluded
that garlic ottered little or no sig
nificant benefit, said Gardner, but
they all looked at garlic in the pill
form.
"Why do one more [study]?" he
asked. "Well, we're challenging
the studies belbre based on what
the biochemist analyzed. No one
took on fresh garlic before."
The biochemist is Larry Law
son. a co-investigator in the Stan
ford study and a long-time garlic
researcher. Lawson noticed a flaw
in traditional ways of measuring
the health effects of garlic. Nor
mally, when garlic is chewed or
chopped, an enzyme releases the
active ingredient allicin. But Law
son noticed that comparable
amounts of allicin are not released
when garlic is in pill form.
Herbal supplement companies
typically mix their supplements in
water to see if allicin is still present
after the pill dissolves. Lawson
thought this method was Hawed.
He took the same supplements,
but tested them in a simulation of a
human digestive tract. Lawson

found that pills either dissolve in
the stomach, where the allicin en
zyme becomes inactive, or pass
through the body without being
dissolved at all.
When Gardner discovered
Lawson's work, he saw the possi
bility for creating a new study,
based around fresh garlic and
the supplements Lawson found
to be most potent when digested.
Recently, their project proposal
received a $1.5 million grant
from the National Institutes of
1 lealth.
In preparation for his study,
Gardner went to Gilroy, also
known as the garlic capital of the
world, to get garlic from the
wholesale market.
"It's the same thing consumers
buy," he said.
Keeping true to consumer ten
dencies will be especially impor
tant for future practical applica
tions of the study. Already on any
given day, 18 percent of Ameri
cans eat at least one food contain
ing garlic, and each household
consumes 2.5 pounds of garlic
every year. But many Americans
depend on garlic supplements, not
fresh garlic, for their daily dose of
allicin.
Gardner bought 100 pounds
of the Early Spring California va
riety. Alter preparing the garlic,

the research team then spent two
weeks trying out different sand
wiches for the garlic, an effort that
was part science and part culinary
art. Gardner wanted a variety so
participants would not have to eat
the same sandwich repeatedly,
and the final list of sandwiches
ranged from grilled vegetable
and panino di portobello to
Southwestern tortilla wrap. Along
with their sandwich, every partic
ipant receives a small portion of
the garlic condiment spread and a
bottle of supplemental pills â€” but
they are not told if the condi
ments or the supplements have
garlic in them.
"We never tell them, we just as
sume they'll figure it out," Gard
ner said. Me added that, because of
the strong taste and smell, "I as
sume 99 percent will figure out
that they get the fresh garlic."
There are very narrow para
meters for participation in the
study. Every volunteer must be
between 30 and 65 years old with
elevated levels of LDL choles
terol. They also must be willing to
come to campus twice a week for
six months to pick up their sand
wiches.
"You get smarter people who
are proactive and who want to
make life better," Gardner said of
his subjects.

Alan is typical of the partici
pants. Alan's cholesterol levels
were high enough to be worri
some, but not high enough to war
rant medication. He decided to
participate as both a conscious ef
fort to lower his cholesterol and as
a contribution to science, he said.
"It's an opportunity to do some
thing for myself and for others," he
said.
Alan was among the first group
of participants in the project,
which will continue for four years.
Alan has finished half of his six
month commitment.
"The hardest part is sometimes
you just don't want to eat what
they gave you," he said. "Even
though there is variety, the hardest
part is the lack of variety."
Despite his months of participa
tion, Alan is still unsure whether he
is receiving the garlic in his sand
wiches
"There are days I can smell it,"
he said. "I honestly don't know.
There are days my body feels full
of garlic and days t hat I don't."
Regardless of whether he is get
