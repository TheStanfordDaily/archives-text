### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, the Stanford chapter of
alpha Kappa Delta Plli hosted "Encoun
ters," their fourth annual conference focus
ing on women's empowerment issues.
Attended by sorority members from
Stanford and surrounding colleges, this
year's conference sought to go beyond the
sorority's Asian-American focus and
broached issues that transcend race, such as
body image and women's rights.
"In previous years, the conference was
explicitly targeting issues affecting Asian
American women, but this year we have
broadened the focus to all women, while
still making sure to address the unique po
sition of women of color and Asian-Ameri
can women" saitl junior Paloma Rosen
baum, vice president of service for aKDPhi.
The event began with a keynote speech
by Dr. Malini Alles, who described her as
cent from a repressive childhood environ
ment in Australia to becoming a highly suc
cessful psychologist and entrepreneur in
the United States.
"Today, women are not free around the
world," Alles saitl. "We are not free in India
or Indiana. We are not free in Mexico or
New Mexico. We are not free in Uganda
and even in Utah."
She continued, "The kind of freedom
that I'm talking about is great and small, it is
large and it is petty, it is about doing the
housework, being a wife, a mother, and a
professional, about balancing society's ex

pectations of you and you yourself. It's about
negotiating a good deal at a car dealership."
Alles is the founder of Stree, an organi
zation that provides health care for poor
women throughout the world. In her
speech, she called the audience to action,
urging them to pursue their dreams with
confidence in themselves.
"As women, you are the future, you are
the voice of this millennium," she said.
"You have the opportunity and the power
to change the role of women globally —
don't ever, ever forget that. You can and
will make history, but you need to believe in
yourself. You need to want it as much as
men want it."
She added, "Never endure sexism —
challenge it. And never be afraid to ask for
what you want and what you need."
Sophomore Cathy Nguyen found the
speech inspiring.
"It was empowering to be a minority
woman and [recognize] the difference you
can make," Nguyen said.
Alles was followed by a performance by
Aya de Leon, a spoken word artist who has
taught at Stanford through the Institute for
Diversity in the Arts.
De Leon called for empowerment and
equality of women, particularly in the male
dominated field of hip-hop and for women
to fight negative body images.
"One of the first ways that we get taken
off our path [as women] is we get bombard
ed with messages about our bodies and that

we should be worried about it
constantly," she said.
De Leon cited some of her poet
ry, which read, "A sick society turns
women's bodies into, eww, prob
lems to be solved, but anorexia
ain't sexier, and bulimia ain't
dreamier, so next time you're
counting calories, don't forget to
count the thousands of years that
women's suitors thought that cel
lulite was, mmm, quite alright, and
were ready to embrace abun
dance."
After the opening speakers,
there was a first round of work
shops that touched on topics perti
nent to women and Asian Ameri
cans.
"Some issues we want to cover
are women's safety, body image,
connecting with cultural heritage,
Asian Americans in the media, the
double identity inherent in being
a woman of color, creating posi
tive friendships between women
and the role of women in reli
gion," Rosenbaum said.
These workshops included a

writing workshop headed by de
Leon that addressed body image
and another entitled, "Finding
Strength in the Past: discovering
your heritage," which was lead by
Sau-ling Wong of UC-Berkeley.
"[lt] gave me some new per
spectives on being Asian Ameri
can" said sophomore lesan Tsai of
the heritage workshop. "There
are some popular misconceptions
that she cleared up for us . . . One
thing I was really impressed by is
that she talked about how there
are some things that you might
think are very annoying about
your culture ... A lot of it doesn't
have to do with race but with so
cioeconomic status."
Counterpoint, Alliance Street
dance, Stanford Steppers and
Stanford WuShu performed dur
ing the lunch break between
workshops.
The afternoon featured a sec
ond round of workshops, fol
lowed by several panel discus
sions addressing current themes.
These included "Asian Americans
in the Media" and "Women of
Color as a Double Minority." The
closing ceremony included a per
formance by the a cappella group
Talisman.
