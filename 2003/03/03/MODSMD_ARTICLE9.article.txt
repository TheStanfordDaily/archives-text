## Israeli soldiers kill two in raid 
### 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli troops
backed by tanks and helicopters raided a Gaza Strip
town early yesterday, killing two Palestinians in fierce
fighting and demolishing an apartment building and
the exterior wall of a hospital.
Separately, a 9-year-old Palestinian boy was shot
and killed at the funeral of two men killed in the Gaza
Strip raid.
Palestinian doctors said mourners fired in the air, as
is customary during funerals, and drew Israeli army
fire, apparently because the cemetery is near a Jewish
settlement. The Doctors said the boy was hit by large
caliber ammunition fired by Israeli machine guns. Two
adults at the funeral were also injured. The Israeli army
had no immediate comment on the incident.
The raid on Khan Younis came as part of an Israel
military offensive in Gaza, triggered by a Hamas at
tack two weeks ago on an Israeli tank that killed the
four-man crew. Since then, Israeli troops have re
peatedly entered Gaza towns, demolishing the homes
of suspected militants.
The latest military operation came hours after
Palestinian officials agreed to convene the Palestinian
Legislative Council next week and begin the process
of appointing a prime minister, one of the reforms Is
rael and the United States demand as a precursor to
the renewal of peace talks.
Mideast mediators have pressured Arafat to share
power as part of reforms required as part of a U.S.-
backed plan for Palestinian statehood by 2005.
Raanan Gissin, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, said yesterday that Israel is reviewing
the names of the 124 Central Council members and
88 legislators and would deny permits to those direct
ly involved in attacks against Israel.
In the Khan Younis raid, tanks backed by attack
helicopters entered the southern Gaza town before
dawn and withdrew several hours later.
Israeli forces met fierce resistance, the military
said. Firefights erupted with gunmen who used a
school, a hospital and a mosque as cover when firing
on troops, the army said.
