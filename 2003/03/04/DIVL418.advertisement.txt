"What we are witnessing is a systematic assault on civilization. Protectionism and nationalism
have become dominant themes of leftist and rightist political parties. Anti-globalization activists
recently trashed the beautiful city of Genoa, attacked people with gasoline bombs and steel bars,
and destroyed cars, plate-glass windows, buildings, and much more. Theirs is a message of violence,
hatred, narrow-minded nationalism, and elitism. They're already rich, so why allow others
in poor countries to prosper as well?
What motivates extraordinarily wealthy people to attack the very system of free trade that has
made possible the highest standards of living, the longest life spans, and greatest social mobility
and equality ever seen on the planet? They are motivated by bad ideas and by a complete lack
of understanding of the economics, history, and philosophy of property and free exchange."
