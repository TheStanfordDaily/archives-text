## S.F. officers step down from jobs 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - In a chaotic clay that left
the police department in shambles, six top officers
charged with conspiracy stepped down Monday
while prosecutors investigate whether they tried to
cover up a street brawl involving a handful of off-duty
officers.
Police Chief Earl Sanders, who is also charged, re
fused to join the group. However, his attorney said
Sanders will soon take medical leave for an undis
closed reason.
The Police Commission, which last week agreed
not to suspend Sanders, met again yesterday and took
no action against the chief. When the dust settled,
Deputy Chief Heather Fong was left in charge.
The shake-up came more than three months after
the light outside a San Francisco bar between the offi
cers and two men carrying a bag of steak fajitas. Pros
ecutors say police executives tried to cover up the as
sault, and the case has exposed sharp divisions among
the city's power brokers.
Sanders, Assistant Chief Alex Fagan and Deputy
Chief David Robinson are among seven officers in
dicted on a count of conspiring to obstruct justice, a
felony. Fagan's son, 23-year-old rookie Alex Jr., is of
one of the officers charged with assault and battery.
John Burris, Sanders' attorney, said the chief
would be taking medical leave, though the timing was
uncertain.
District Attorney Terence Hallinan said "no one in
San Francisco is above the law."
"I understand the public feelings of shock, out
rage, anger and apprehension," he said during a
news conference at which he rejected accusations the
indictments were part of a political witch hunt.
Mayor Willie Brown has criticized Hallinan for
bringing the indictments and urged California's at
torney general to throw out the charges. It was Brown
who promoted Sanders and Fagan last year after a
San Francisco Chronicle investigation found police
solved only 28 percent of the city's violent crimes, the
worst record of any major U.S. city.
