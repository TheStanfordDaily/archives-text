# Stocks plunge in Turkey

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's
stock market plunged more than 12 percent
yesterday as investors worried the country
may have lost $15 billion in much-needed
grant and loan aid from the United States
because parliament refused to allow tens of
thousands of U.S. troops on Turkish soil.
The dive came as the government
showed no signs that it would ask legislators
to reverse Saturday's surprise vote, which
denied the United States a crucial northern
front in a war against Iraq.
In Washington, spokesman Ari Fleischer
said "no final judgments have been made"
about the aid package. But State Depart
ment spokesman Richard Boucher said
most of the package was predicated on com
pensating Turkey for the costs of facilitating

the deployment of more than 60,000 troops.
"If those activities don't occur, the costs
won't be incurred," Boucher said.
Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said his
government was still analyzing the situa
tion. "We will see what happens in the next
lew days," Gul told a news conference.
But even if the Turkish government
does submit a new motion, analysts say, the
process could take up to two weeks - per
haps too long for Washington, which hopes
to use Turkey to attack Iraq from the north.
The market fall is unlikely to have an im
mediate impact on the government as the
lira held up well yesterday, analysts said.
But traders warned the market could con
tinue to fall if it becomes clear that Turkey
will not get the aid package.
