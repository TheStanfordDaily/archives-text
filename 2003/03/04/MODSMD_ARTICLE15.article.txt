# Wages protested at Yale
## 
### 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) —
Picket lines were set up across the
Yale University campus yesterday
as unions representing some 5,000
service workers kicked off a five
day strike to protest deadlocked
contract talks.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson and
New I laven clergy marched with a
few thousand workers, communi
ty leaders and students through
the city streets to a rally just out
side the Yale campus.
"We, the workers, will not go
away," said Jackson, his voice
hoarse with the cold. "We will
march in the cold until hell freezes
over."
Jackson met earlier in the day
with Yale President Richard Levin
to discuss the stalled contract talks,
Yale spokeswoman Helaine
Klasky said.
Freshman Alan Kennedy-Shaf
fer, who works part-time at a din
ing hall, said he sympathizes with
those who rely on the food service
work to feed their own families.
"I believe it's important for Yale
to treat its workers properly," he
said.
All but one campus dining hall
was closed because of the walkout.
The university had given students
$170 rebates on their room and
board charges to buy meals.
Some professors scheduled
classes in churches and coffee
shops so students would not have
to cross picket lines.
During the walkout — the sev
enth by Yale workers in the last 35
years — managers will have to do
work such as running the power
plant and answering telephones.
The bulk of the protesters are

clerical, technical, service and
maintenance workers from Locals
34 and 35 of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees Interna
tional Union. They were joined by
several hundred graduate stu
dents, whose union is not recog
nized by Yale.
Victoria Martin, a custodian,
said she was striking for better pay
and pensions.
"They really don't want to pay
us custodians," Martin said.
"We're the lowest people on the
totem pole, and they really just
want to give us pennies."
The university has offered a six
year contract, with annual raises
for most workers of 3 percent or 4
percent. That offer has not
changed since negotiations began
a year ago.
Yale spokeswoman Helaine
Klasky said the offer is generous,
especially in tough economic
times. But the unions respond that
Yale has an $11 billion endow
ment and that some workers rely
on state assistance to take care of
their families.
The unions said they have re
duced their wage demands four
times during a year of negotiat ions.
They now seek a four-year contract
with retroactive raises of 3 percent
or 4 percent for the first year, then
raises of 8.5 percent for Local 34
and 5.5 percent for Local 35 for
each of the other three years.
The unions also seek increased
pensions, saying workers cannot
retire on what Yale will pay - less
than $700 monthly for an employ
ee with 20 years on the job. Con
tract talks ended Friday and are to
resume March 11.
