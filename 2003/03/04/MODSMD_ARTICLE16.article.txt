## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Making cents in the ASSU 
### 
Emphasizing concrete and practi
cal issues, ASSU President Moni
ca Henestroza and Graduate Stu
dent Council Chair Grace Chang
delivered a joint State of the Association
address on Feb. 24.
The important accomplishments and
plans that Henestroza and Chang dis
cussed included costs of living concerns,
student space developments, communi
cation with students about the role of the
ASSU and administrative accountability.
More specifically, we wish to note also two
concrete proposals: plans that would
make meal plans and laundry services
more cost efficient. We were pleased that
the ASSU leaders decided to focus their
address on pragmatic issues where the
ASSU can make key contributions.
The focus of the State of the Association
illustrates that the ASSU is headed in the
right direction, concentrating on relevant

and concrete issues
that will more direct
ly influence student
life at Stanford. One
of the key matters ad
dressed in the speech
was the cost of living
concerns of many
students and the
progress that the
ASSU had made.
While dining plans

and laundry costs may sometimes appear
to be trivial when compared to matters of
national concern, they are in fact an im
portant part of student life.
I'he ASSU has made good progress by
working with Stanford Dining Services
through a special committee to provide a
10-meal-per-week plan with points for busy
students or upperclassmen who eat fewer
meals on campus. The Dining Committee
has met with Executive Director of Dining
Services Nadeem Siddiqui to improve the
dining halls on campus and cut costs. Un
fortunately, the new plan will raise costs of
the other meal plans and the price will not
be much lower than the current 14-meal
per-week plan, but these small gains are ev
idence that the ASSU is working hard to
benefit students. Historically, the most re
membered and respected ASSU leadership
has undertaken similar initiatives.
Stanford after Midnight, which started
in the year 2000, is one example. That
program first allowed students to use vital
Stanford facilities — like Tresidder
Union, Meyer Library and particular din
ing halls — after midnight. We hope the
current leaders' changes continue to

The ASSU is headed in the right
direction, concentrating on rele
vant and concrete issues that will
more directly influence student
life at Stanford.

make similar long-lasting impact that will
benefit the student body.
Additionally, Senator Sarah Schulman
lias been working on a plan to cheapen the
cost of laundry services. Under the propos
al, students would pay a fixed sum (proba
bly around $20) per year for unlimited use
of laundry facilities. Right now, all students
must pay $1 for each load in the washer
and another $ 1 for each load in the dryer.
Given that the average college student
probably does a couple loads of laundry
every week, the costs add up rather quick
ly. liie proposal also takes into account stu
dents who are on financial aid and would
calculate the charge into their financial aid
package. Therefore, it's an idea that bene
fits everyone.
The cost of doing laundry every week
end or grabbing regular late-night meals
at Jack in the Box can weigh heavily on a
student's budget, especially given the high

prices of living in the
Bay Area. The aver
age student also
needs to pay a phone
bill, for books at the
Bookstore and even
gas — provided that
the student drives his
or her own vehicle.
We believe that lower
ing the cost of living is
a matter in which the

ASSU can make a difference in improving
even the small details of the life of the stu
dent body and we praise their efforts.
Finally, the ASSU is also right to com
municate with students about the role
that it plays on campus so that students
who will soon run for Undergraduate
Senate and other leadership positions
will be aware of the changes and impor
tant contributions they can make while
in office. We hope that students who are
planning to run keep this recent impor
tant address in mind as they think about
the issues that they will include in their
platforms and make promises that they
can keep.
In order for students to support and
trust their leaders in the ASSU, it is essen
tial that future and current senators keep
in mind that they must work for practical
and concrete issues where they can make
the best use of their time and power. After
all, it is the job of the politician to meet the
needs of his constituents — and smaller
needs are just as important as the larger
ones. We look forward to seeing the
changes implemented in improving stu
dent life on campus.
