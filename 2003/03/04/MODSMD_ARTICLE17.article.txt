# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Asian stereotypes examined 
### 
Last year, Abercrombie and
Fitch came out with a line
of shirts depicting diminu
tive, slanty-eyed Asians
alongside such banners as" Buddha
Bash: Get Your Buddha on the
Floor" and "Two Wongs Can Make
it White." Clever, yes; tasteful, no.
Under other circumstances, 1
laugh: When somebody says they
could eat a medium-sized Chinese
family for lunch, I chuckle good
naturedly.
But in this case, I was less than
amused. I wouldn't go so far as to
characterize Abercrombie and
Fitch as racist, but by rolling out a
line of apparel obviously offensive
to all people of Asian descent, the
Abercrombie and Fitch top brass
must've figured that, true to their
nature, Asians would complacently
sit back and take this seemingly
good-natured jabbing in stride.
Indeed, the T-shirt controversy
is testament that Asians are, above
all, perceived as a weak race. Yet
these stereotypes must have some
basis, or else they wouldn't have
arisen in the first place.
I can attest. Alter a decade of
gradual white flight, there are so
many Asians in my neighborhood
in Fremont, Calif, that you could
change the street signs into Chinese
characters and many of my neigh
bors would be grateful. At our high
school, academics reigned supreme
and we consistently placed in the
state's top 10 in standardized test
scores. Now the school's three-fifths
Asian, and the elementary schools
feeding into it are creeping up to
wards a disturbingly clannish 70
percent. The result is that we con
tinue to dominate the league in
non-contact sports such as swim
ming and tennis, but count our
blessings if we have an even win-loss
record in more mainstream sports
like basketball and baseball. Never
mind football: This year's varsity

season was cancelled because only a
couple of seniors bothered to suit
up.
In the realm of love, women are
supposedly submissive and the

men are asexual. We live small,
skinny geek lives, making up for
our supposed lack of physical size
with our overwhelming nerdiness.
We're the so-called model minority,
quietly exceeding our allotment of

college â€¢ spaces,
then going out
and filling the
upper echelons of
the income brack
ets, all while hard
ly registering so
much as a ripple
in society's con
sciousness.

But being described as "model"
in this context doesn't carry positive
connotations. It implies that the
good minority is the silent minority.
You respect a model not because
he's a paragon of virtue, but be
cause you admire him and want to
make his qualities your own. Be
sides, whom are Asians supposed to
be strutting down the catwalk for?
Other minorities?
Asians are integrated into main
stream culture to a lesser-degree
than even African-Americans or
Latinos. Though Lucy Liu's steam
ing up the big-screen and Lisa Ling
is hawking Old Navy capris, repre
sentatives in pop music, television
and movies are still few and far be
tween. Jackie Chan and Jet Li are
questionable: They're typecast as
hi-ya kung-fu fighters, not any dif
ferent from the role Bruce Lee
filled over 30 years ago.
In 2002, there were two Asian
senators and seven Asian congress
men, hardly enough political rep
resentation fora minority that is 12
million strong. But things are bet
ter in the sports world, as the
Japanese are infiltrating the major

leagues and China's Yao Ming, at a
towering 7-foot-6, will one clay
make Shaq regret his Charlie
Chan comments.
Around campus, most of the
Asians that I've talked to say that
their parents are immigrants or
that they came to America at a very
young age. So we grew up with the
Asian ideals, where excelling in
school was the top priority at the ex
pense of everything else, especially
sports. .And the conservative path
was the right path. In Taiwan,
where my own parents are from,
some children are even expected to
live with their parents after mar
riage.
Of course there are the in
evitable culture clashes. Case in
point: Though talking about sex is
as taboo as performing the act, it
hasn't prevented me from obtain
ing a working familiarity with the
Jenna Jamison classics. Because
we're Asian with our eiders and
American with our peers, we're ba
sically cavorting around with masks
on our faces. But which identity is
the one that's truly underneath the
facade?
Yes, Confucian ideals and Em
inem culture make strange bedfel
lows. But maybe Asians, as a collec
tive minority, just haven't been in
America long enough yet to break
out of their shell of anonymity, to
successfully meld their Asian up
bringing with the sense of individu
alism that America holds sacred.
As we get older, things will shine
brighter. The army of white-collar
workers will shatter the glass ceiling
and rise to prominent leadership
roles. More seats will be filled on
Capitol Mill. On the airwaves, Asian
"wankstas" will be boasting about
gdttifi' some. But not flushing red
after half a beer-that might be ask
ing for too much.

The Abercrombie and Fitch
shirts were pulled from the
shelves after the Asian communi
ty, including students from Stan
ford, mobilized into action and

provided the spark for an out
burst of protests around the na
tion. Abercrombie and Fitch apol
ogized and pulled the offensive
clothing from its racks. On moral
grounds, I still refuse to purchase
any more Abercrombie and Fitch
apparel. I might be swayed to
change my mind, however, if they
decided to put my face, cropped

onto some weightlifter's body, in
the center of one of their boy toy
bags. The prospects of automatic
sex appeal supersede any hang
ups I have about their racial in
sensitivity.

I'm slanty-eyed from lack of sleep. Send
me a wakening response at
