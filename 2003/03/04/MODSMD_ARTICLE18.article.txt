Methods of national student
strike day questioned
Wednesday marks the national student
strike day in order to promote peace. 1 am
pleased that this campus is showing initia
tive in supporting a nationwide protest,
but I question the method.
Whether someone is for or against the
war is not the issue to me.
The issue is whether or not cancelling
class somehow substitutes for the inde
pendent obligation each student has per
sonally to become educated about the
Iraq issues and either to express opinions
or not express them in a public way. Be
coming educated is a constant process,
about war or anything else. It doesn't stop
and start and does not seem well-served
by cancelling an educational endeavor on
a different front.
Finally, although offered as a day of ed
ucation about the war, I would be interest
ed in knowing how many pro-war per
spectives are going to be offered as part of
this education. Asking that the other side
of the issue be a part of the education is
neither a statement for or against war; it is
a statement for true education. For these

reasons and more, I am for open discus
sion, but against cancelling class.

Affirmative action practices unfair to
Asian Americans
The guest column "Practices of affir
mative action are suspect" (Feb. 28) was
right on target concerning the fallacies in
the present form of affirmative action.
Forget about all the poor white people.
Their kids are obviously not underprivi
leged since their "whiteness," a well-de
fined quality shared by all European de
scendants, from the Icelandic to the
French to the Yugoslavs, is the social
economic: equivalence of "elite."
Then lump all descendants of Chi
nese-, Japanese-, Thai-, Korean-, Tai
wanese-, Mongolian-, Vietnamese-, Fil
ipino- and even Tibetan-Americans into
one category. Repeat the same formula
of sweeping categorization to all racial
groups and apply admission quotas to
each race while waving the banner of un
doing past racial discrimination.
Given the present composition of the
Stanford student l>ody, no doubt affirmative
action would hurt Asian-American appli
cants here, as well as at other institutions of

various levels of prestige. Thank goodness I
was lucky enough to be admitted as one of
the 12 percent so I can express my musings
to you now, but I assure you that a letter stat
ing, "We are sorry that we cannot offer you
admission at this time. Though we hope you
find solace in that we will be welcoming XX
number of your fellow Asian-Americans to
our Class of 2004" would have only agitated
me, not filled me with cultural pride.
So whatever happened to examining
an applicant as a unique individual and
awarding them with a place among the
best for their demonstrated aspirations
and achievements? I surely hope that
just because I'm Taiwanese doesn't
mean that 1 came from a single house
handsomely situated on the hills of Di
amond Bar. Or that I wasn't raised sin
gle-handedly by a hardworking mother
so busy with her 8-to-6 babysitting job
that she never had time to see my high
school baseball games. Or that my SAT
tutoring didn't consist of anything
more than trips to the public library
and hours spent alone in the basement.
Or that nobody looked down upon me
because I didn't have cool clothes or a
dope ride.
My last name is Chen, and although
the Stanford Directory has more than a
page of us, each of us has a different past,
present and future. I am lucky to be here,

but I've fought my battles to get close. I'm
not arguing for caucasian (whatever that
means) or Asian-American rights.
I'm arguing for those disadvantaged
yet deserving individuals who are not
here now but may never get here because,
according to a measure to correct past
racial injustices, they were ironically born
with the wrong skin color. Poverty and in
equality don't begin and end with skin
color. Only an affirmative action based on
socioeconomic status established upon
careful research, not race determined by a
checked box, can give the underprivi
leged kids the boost they deserve.

Triple play needs mention
The Daily reported the Cardinal baseball
victory over USC yesterday. The 18-4 win
was great to watch but the reporter must
somehow missed the most memorable part:
the Cardinal second-inning TRIPLE FLAY!
I have watched baseball for well over a half
century and never before witnessed a triple
play. By the way, The San Jose Mercury
News did not mention it either.

The Daily reported the Cardinal baseball
victory over USC yesterday. The 18-4 win
was great to watch but the reporter must
somehow missed the most memorable part:
the Cardinal second-inning TRIPLE FLAY!
I have watched baseball for well over a half
century and never before witnessed a triple
play. By the way, The San Jose Mercury
News did not mention it either.
