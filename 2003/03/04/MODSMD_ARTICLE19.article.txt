## Anti-war movement asks student to miss class tomorrow 
### LETICIA RAMIREZ CALVIN MIAW GUEST COLUMNISTS 
With so many seemingly well-thought
out arguments for and against war on Iraq,
it's easier for us to remain apolitical and not
take a side. However, it is very important
for us as students to recognize the relevance
and impact of war on our daily lives. The in
creasing militarization, which inevitably re
sults from war, diverts money from federal
education funding, federal grants and fi
nancial aid and other social programs.
This disproportionately affects low-in

come communities and communities of
color, who depend most heavily upon
these funds. In addition, these same com
munities are frequently the targets of mil
itary recruiters and end up on the front
lines instead of in a college classroom.
The economic costs of a war are stagger
ing— and the social costs are even more as
tounding. As Stanford students, we have a
unique responsibility to educate ourselves
about the role that our university plays in
the conflict and express our dissent.
Stanford is unique among U.S. col
leges because the Hoover Institution is
part of our university, the only conserva

tive think tank that is affiliated with a uni
versity. Its fellows make up one-fourth of
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's
advisers on the defense policy board.
Furthermore, Stanford is one of five
schools part of the Academic Strategic Al
liance Program, whose member schools are
expected to assist in the simulation of ther
monuclear detonation, allowing the United
States to maintain a store of nuclear arms.
Because we are the benefactors of this pres
tigious institution, we have a responsibility
to apply our education in a socially con
scious manner to issues that confront the
nation, particularly due to the power and

weight that the Stanford name carries.
An example of this potential for influ
ence is Stanford's affiliation with former
Provost Condoleezza Rice, an influential
decision maker of foreign policy under
Bush.
Due to these connections, there is more
media interest in Stanford activities, which
leaves students with an obligation to wield
that power for social justice. Students across
the nation are recognizing their responsi
bility and strength by joining together on
tomorrow fora national student solidarity
strike for alternatives to the war on Iraq.
Tomorrow provides us with the opportu

nity to become informed and raise our voices
together. Students here representing wide
interests are coordinating with students from
across the nation to create a day where stu
dents engage in dialogue and reclaim their
educations. By not attending classes for one
day, we'll express our solidarity with students
across the country, while becoming informed
and active members of our democracy.
