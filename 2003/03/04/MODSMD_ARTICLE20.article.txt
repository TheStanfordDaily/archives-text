# CAMPUS VIEWPOINTS
## War must be fought with Iraq 
### ELIZABETH GORDON GUEST COLUMNIST 
Am I really supposed to believe
that President Bush and Prime
Minister Tony Blair are worse
than Saddam Hussein? Incredibly,
that's the message of the organiz
ers of tomorrow's campuswide
strike to oppose the war in Iraq. At
recent anti-war rallies, they and
their fellow travelers have been
hoisting signs denouncing Bush
and Blair as baby killers. But not
one of the anti-war groups on cam
pus has denounced the crimes
committed by Saddam Hussein.
The anti-war crowd (a.k.a.
" Blame America First") likes to talk
about peace, but they never men
tion that Hussein has been con
ducting a war against his own peo
ple for over 30 years. Absent from
campus debate is any mention of
the tragedy of Halabja, the Kur
dish town where Hussein's forces
murdered 5,000 people with poi
son gas in 1988. Also lacking is any
discussion of the more than 1 mil
lion Iraqis murdered by the
regime, the ethnic cleansing cam
paigns that have seen another mil
lion deported or the use of rape
and torture in Hussein's prisons to
keep Iraqis in fear and servitude,
according to womenforiraq.org. Is
this peace?

I he same anti-war crowd con
tinues to plug the idea that interna
tionally approved sanctions are the
real cause of Iraqi suffering. They
fail to mention that food, medicine
and other supplies are allowed into
Iraq under the sanctions; the pro
gram is called "oil for food" and
began in 1997 but the oil profits
have been diverted to Hussein and
his army. In some cases, Hussein
has resold food and medicine pur
chased abroad on black markets in
Syria and Jordan to obtain cash for
his weapons programs. If Hussein
truly cared about the Iraqi people,
all he needs to do is fully disarm and
the sanctions would be lifted.
Those who claim to stand for
peace and the welfare of the Iraqi
people, but are silent about Hus
sein's persecution of his popula
tion — Christians, Sunnis, Shi'as,
Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians and
Arabs — are hypocrites.
Even worse, some anti-war ac
tivists seem to be deliberately try
ing to squelch the truth about the
suffering of the Iraqis: At one re
cent anti-war rally in New York,
when an Iraqi grandmother tried
to tell the story of her three sons
who had been murdered for op
posing Saddam, one of the rally
prgajuz;ers, Jesse Jackson, refused
to let her speak, according to an
article in Foreign Policy Maga

zine.
Anyone planning to strike to
morrow should take just a few
minutes to learn about the real
reason for tragedy that has un
folded in Iraq over the last three
decades. Web sites like
www.womenforiraq.org or
www.lraqiProspect.org spell out
the fact that the Iraqi people
yearn to be free from a tyrant who
uses murder as a weapon of state:
When the International Crisis
Group, a 11011- profit organization
based in Brussels, conducted a se
cret survey in Iraq in September
they learned that most Iraqis
would support the war if it finally
rids them of Hussein.
The Iraqi people live in terror.
Students who demonstrate in op
position to the war but refuse to face
the hard moral question of allowing
a tyrant like Hussein to remain in
power are abandoning the Iraqis to
a terrible fate. America went to war
in the Balkans to save the Bosnians
and Kosovars and bring Slobodan
Milosevic to trial for his crimes.
Why is this different? The students
who will strike tomorrow in the
name of peace are not really anti
war. They are anti-liberation.
