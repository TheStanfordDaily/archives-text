# War on Iraq needs rethinking
## 
### ZACHARY HALDEMAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Despite President Bush's claims
of moral certainty, he has offered
mere platitudes regarding the
ethics of attacking Iraq. Not only is
an ethical justification necessary,
but also it is the single legitimate
justification for war.
Why should ethics motivate a
decision on war or any other sub
ject? To strive for anything less
than the ethical ideal is to compro
mise one's values, and to compro
mise one's values is to subjugate
oneself to the will of others, which
is to invite tyranny and mob rule.
Without ethics to guide our
government in all it does, we are
subject to tyranny and mob rule at
home and abroad. Thus, the ethi
cal justification for war is the value
of freedom.
Most of the world does not un
derstand the value of freedom and
why only freedom can justify war.
Many nations stress the necessi
ty of consensus building and mul
tilateralism. However, neither of
those involves actually convincing
anyone whether war is light or
not; instead, consensus-building
and multilateralism are praised for
their own sake.) •> ■ • < >
According to a recent French
memorandum on Iraq, "The
unity of the Security Council
must be preserved" in order to
find a peaceful solution. Why? Is
no action right unless everyone
agrees with it? And is a peaceful
solution necessarily better than
anything else?
Unity is good only if it is a con
sequence of people pursuing the
same values and ideals. This is not
the case in the Security Council,
which has made no ethical case
whatsoever. Furthermore, paci
fism rewards the most evil people
in society. Peace and unity are not
unconditionally good.
fhe ethical norm that should
guide nations is freedom. In a so

rial context, freedom consists of in
dividual rights; principally, the
right to live, which is the source of
all other rights. The right to live is
the right to act in accordance with
one's judgment and values, so
long as that does not impose upon
others any obligation except the
obligation not to initiate the threat
or use force.
Individual rights are a uniquely
American ideal. America was the
first nation in which citizens were
not servants of a god or a king or
tlie state; instead, Americans estab
lished the government in order to
secure freedom by protecting the
rights to life, liberty, property and
the pursuit of happiness. In prac
tice, Americans violated all of these
rights from the very beginning,
and even today our rights are in
dire straits, but the ideal of free
dom remains all-important.
A government is legitimate only
if granted its power by free people.
People who do not enjoy freedom
are not able to give consent to their
government. Nations that neither
uphold nor even grant any rights
cannot claim a right to non-inter
ference. That opens the door for
some action against Iraq, but when
is war justified?
The threat and use of force is
justified only when in defense of
freedom. If America still intends to
uphold freedom through individ
ual rights, then we have the right
to take any action appropriate to
defend ourselves from those who
threaten us with force.
In all of this talk about respect
ing freedom and individual
rights, isn't there a contradiction
in violating the rights of foreign
ers with American military ac
tion? Is an American life worth
more than an Iraqi life? No, any
life is self-valued. Your life is what
you make of it.
If you place no value on your
life, and you allow dictatorial
regimes to control you, then you
are responsible for the conse

quences of that. Thus, those Iraqis
who tolerate an oppressive and
deadly regime are responsible for
defensive strikes by free nations,
and in such a strike, the Iraqi
regime is solely responsible for the
deaths of those Iraqis who resisted
the freedom-hating Iraqis.
Your government is not a sepa
rate entity: You are responsible for
it. You are responsible for chang
ing it or dissociating from it if it
threatens to violate individual
rights to life, liberty, property and
the pursuit of happiness.
In contrast, the United States of
America is not the liberator of the
oppressed, and it has no duty or
ability to be such.
The United States might find it
in its own interest fight a war to
end an evil regime, but we can
never force anyone to be free.
Both liberated and oppressed peo
ple must recognize the value of in
dividual rights for themselves.
If some peoples continually
produce oppressive regimes, hos
tile to freedom at home and
abroad, then America should de
feat them time and time again
until they learn for themselves to
respect individual rights.
We should do all that we can to
support those who demand these
rights from their governments, in
cluding the students in Iran and
the strikers in Venezuela. We can
not force freedom upon anyone,
but we should assist those who are
working for it already.
Do not let our own govern
ment take away the very freedom
it is supposed to protect (e.g.,
through the Patriot Act or
through compromises with free
dom-hating nations). Reclaim
your rights to life, liberty, proper
ty and the pursuit of happiness.
Reclaim your freedom, even if
that means war.
