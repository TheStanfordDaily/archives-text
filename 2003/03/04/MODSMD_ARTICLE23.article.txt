# Track preps for NCAA Indoor Championships
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field
team had a quiet weekend in Seat
tle at the Pacific-10 Invitational as
the majority of the team focused
on preparing for the fast-ap
proaching outdoor season and a
select few continue to prepare for
indoor nationals.
The most significant perfor
mance this weekend came from
junior Grant Robison, who post
ed a provisional qualifying time
in the mile with a time of 4 min
utes 1.40 seconds to win the
event.
But with the intense competi
tion in the mile this year, his time
may not be enough to get him to
the NCAA Indoor National
Championships.
"The race on Saturday was
fine, and I felt fine until about 150
meters to go," Robison said. "I just
wasn't able to close like I wanted
to. 1 was injured most of the win
ter and so it has been a long te
dious trip back that can be frus
trating at times."
The Cardinal also got a win
from sophomore Nick Sebes who
finished the 200-meter dash in a
season-best 21.58 seconds.
His effort ranks second on
Stanford's all-time indoor list. In
the same race, sophomore Ger
ren Crochet placed third in
21.90. His time is No. 6 in the
record books.
A school record was set by the
men's 1600-meter relay team of
senior Milton Little, sophomore
Gerren Crochet, Sebes and fresh
man TJ Rushing as they placed
second in 3:10.40.
On the women's side, junior
Jessica Pinth c laimed first in the

weight throw with a heave of 61
feet, 5.50 inches â€” just short of
her school record.
In the high jump, senior Kim
berly Stone claimed second on
misses to Washington State's
Whitney Evans who is ranked No.
4 in the nation. Both posted a
height of 5-8.75,
The women pole vaulters also
continued their successful season
by grabbing fourth through sixth
place. Junior Leila Ben-Youssef
and senior Kathleen Donoghue
cleared 12-6.00 while freshman
Samantha Shepard cleared 12-
0.00.
Overall the No. 2 women's
squad and the No. 6 men's squad
have posted some impressive
times for the upcoming national
championships and have been
rewriting the record books all
year in the sprints and field
events.
But this may be one of the
all-time most competitive years
in NCAA track and field. The
collegiate men's 3,000 record
and the women's triple jump
and long jump records have al
ready been broken, while the
women's 1,600-meter relay and
60-hurdle records are also in
jeopardy.
The highly anticipated South
eastern Conference and Big-10
Conference Championships were
contested this past weekend with
athletes posting incredible times
and marks ahead of indoor na
tionals.
Arkansas men have established
themselves as the team to beat by
dominating the SEC, one of the
toughest conferences in the na
tion. The Razorbacks boast five
