# Don't be too hard on athletes

It is now official. Those words
that rolled ever so vociferously
off of the tongue of Charles
Barkley many years ago are
now ringing truer than ever. YVecan
no longer afford to look at the sports
world to find role models to lead our
society.
We tried to fight it when Sir
Charles and Nike said it in that fa
mous advertisement. We enlisted
the likes of psychologists, neurolo
gists, anthropologists and all kinds
of other Latin-root word type scien
tists to deny those athletes who
would eschew their duty as "unoffi
cial guardian of my children" (in
many cases — see Shawn Kemp —
the term unofficial guardian could
be replaced by deadbeat supplier of
sperm). But nevertheless, the evi
dence is all too convincing that
sports is not the place in which one
will find the leaders of today.
Take, for instance,the recent
controversy surrounding New York
Yankees pitcher David Wells. Wells,

in his soon-to-be
published autobi
ography, admit
ted to being half
drunk the night
he became the
15th pitcher in
MLB history to
pitch a perfect
game. He claims

that he got loaded at a Saturday
Night Live cast party into the early
hours of the morning and was still
feeling the effects of the alcohol dur
ing his historic performance.
In another episode showing the
degeneration of sporting ethics,
University of Georgia basketball
coach Jim Harrick is now facing al
legations that he and his son gave
monetary gifts to and committed
academic fraud fora former Bull
dog basketball player. Tony Cole
has alleged that the Harricks cov
ered Cole's lavish phone bills and
hotel charges and even took corre
spondence courses for him.

And in what must be the ultimate
sign that the goodness and purity oi
sport is coming to a horrific end, the
ku klux Klan has announced that it
plans to protest in support of the
policies of Augusta National Golf
Club, the home of golfs most presti
gious tournament, the Masters.
When you look around and see
incidents like these tarnishing the
names of some of the most reputable
and honorable names in sports, it
seems almost impossible to maintain
the belief that athletic s bring out all
that is good and pure in people and
that its participants are the embodi
ment of humility and hard work.
But then you look around at all of
the other stuff that's out there, and
suddenly sports don't seem so bad
anymore. Sure, former Green Bay
Packer Mark Chmura may have
had some regrettable hot tub deal
ings with a 17-year-old girl, but the
Catholic priesthood has had what
