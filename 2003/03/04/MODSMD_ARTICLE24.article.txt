# Don't be too hard on athletes
## 
### 
It is now official. Those words
that rolled ever so vociferously
off of the tongue of Charles
Barkley many years ago are
now ringing truer than ever. YVecan
no longer afford to look at the sports
world to find role models to lead our
society.
We tried to fight it when Sir
Charles and Nike said it in that fa
mous advertisement. We enlisted
the likes of psychologists, neurolo
gists, anthropologists and all kinds
of other Latin-root word type scien
tists to deny those athletes who
would eschew their duty as "unoffi
cial guardian of my children" (in
many cases — see Shawn Kemp —
the term unofficial guardian could
be replaced by deadbeat supplier of
sperm). But nevertheless, the evi
dence is all too convincing that
sports is not the place in which one
will find the leaders of today.
Take, for instance,the recent
controversy surrounding New York
Yankees pitcher David Wells. Wells,

in his soon-to-be
published autobi
ography, admit
ted to being half
drunk the night
he became the
15th pitcher in
MLB history to
pitch a perfect
game. He claims

that he got loaded at a Saturday
Night Live cast party into the early
hours of the morning and was still
feeling the effects of the alcohol dur
ing his historic performance.
In another episode showing the
degeneration of sporting ethics,
University of Georgia basketball
coach Jim Harrick is now facing al
legations that he and his son gave
monetary gifts to and committed
academic fraud fora former Bull
dog basketball player. Tony Cole
has alleged that the Harricks cov
ered Cole's lavish phone bills and
hotel charges and even took corre
spondence courses for him.

And in what must be the ultimate
sign that the goodness and purity oi
sport is coming to a horrific end, the
ku klux Klan has announced that it
plans to protest in support of the
policies of Augusta National Golf
Club, the home of golfs most presti
gious tournament, the Masters.
When you look around and see
incidents like these tarnishing the
names of some of the most reputable
and honorable names in sports, it
seems almost impossible to maintain
the belief that athletic s bring out all
that is good and pure in people and
that its participants are the embodi
ment of humility and hard work.
But then you look around at all of
the other stuff that's out there, and
suddenly sports don't seem so bad
anymore. Sure, former Green Bay
Packer Mark Chmura may have
had some regrettable hot tub deal
ings with a 17-year-old girl, but the
Catholic priesthood has had what


Ryan Stewart
seems like thousands of regrettable
dealings with 6-year-old boys. And
most of the priests weren't finely
chiseled athletes with great fiands
and that oh-so-charismatic smile.
See, the choice is easy.
Yes it is true that David Wells is a
fat, slovenly, drunken embarrass
ment of a baseball player. But it is
also true that Newt Gingrich was a
fat, slovenly, overly conservative
Speaker of the House. And iff have
to choose between an obese, inebri
ated pitcher who accomplished
something only a handful of pitchers
can be proud of and an obese, irate
speaker who accomplished nothing
of which he could or should be
proud, give me that despicable Yan
kee. Besides, getting wasted at SNL

c ast parties is a lofty goal to which all
should be proud to aspire.
And while 1 am usually the last
person to come out is support of the
kkk (well, second to last if Akbar is
there, but that guy just takes his ac
tivism to another level), at least they
will draw some attention away from
Martha Burke and her crusade.
Ever since the networks took
"Married with (children" oil the air,
men have lost their forum tor trivi
alizing the efforts of women to gain
equality in society. Thank goodness
we have the kkk to stand behind
the oppressive efforts of venues like
Augusta National and drown out
the legitimate claims of a woman
looking to end discrimination in all
its forms. Without their effort,
women might one day decide it is
okay to hold elected office, become
high-ranking business executives,
and/or not bring mea sandwich and
a beer at half time when 1 don't feel

like getting up.
So you see, the sports world real
ly hasn't degenerated that much in
comparison with the rest of society.
It's the same idea as why we are still
watching Saturday Night Live. Sure,
it may not lx* nearly as good as when
Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and
Chevy Chase were there, but it has
gotten pathetically worse in propor
tion to all the other crappy shows
around it. So even though it may not
be like the good old times, give me
crooked coaches, drunken pitchers,
and poor white trash with pointy
hoods any old day. Here's hoping
that one (lay we can all get wasted at
Saturday Night Live cast parties.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in eco
nomics, ami he and liis friend Akhar re
ally hope one of those Klari members gets
hit in the head by one of Tigers drives.
You can bring him a sandwich at
ryansteu > (a Stanford, ed i (.
