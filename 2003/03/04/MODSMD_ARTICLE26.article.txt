# Softball takes third in Cardinal Classic
## 
### LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although it's improbable that a tournament could be con
sidered a true classic in its first year of existence, this year's
Stanford Classic featured quality Softball throughout the
weekend that lived up to its misnomer. Of the 10 games, only
one was decided by more than two runs.

Women's Softball
Friday: Long Beach State 2, No. 11 Stanford 0
Friday: Stanford 2, No. 1 2 Georgia 0
Saturday: No. 21 Texas A&M 7, Stanford 3
Saturday: Georgia 2, Stanford 0
Sunday: Stanford 3, Long Beach State 2
at Speedline Invitational, Thursday-Sunday, TBA.

No. 11 Stanford (14-0) faced its toughest competition to
date and came away with a third-place finish and a 2-3 record
for the tournament.
No. 21 Texas A&M (16-7) claimed the Stanford Classic
title, with only one loss over the weekend.
Stanford had its share of impressive individual and team
performances, but fell victim to high-caliber pitching and a
lack of timely hitting, scoring only three runs combined in its
three losses.
"We've had opportunities," coach John Rittman said, "We
just haven't capitalized on them."
The Cardinal fell to Long Beach State (7-9) in their first
game of the tournament, 2-0. The 49ers' losing record belies
their talent, as they went 1-4 on the weekend, but were only
outscored by a total of six runs in their four losses.
In what would become a theme in the Cardinal's defeats
throughout the weekend, Stanford's offense threatened sev
eral times against Long Beach State, but never came through
with a run.
Stanford had runners in scoring position in the first, third
and sixth innings, the best chance coming in the first.
The Cardinal's chances fizzled, however, when LBSU
hut let Meredith Cervenka struck out senior first baseman
Maureen Le Cocq with runners on second and third to end
the tin eat.
Cervenka would only allow four more (Cardinal runners to
reach base in the next six innings. Stanford had a runner in
scoring position in the third and sixth, both times with two
outs already on the board-

Sophomore Leah Nelson and the bats of the Cardinal drove past Long Beach State 3-2 to
finish third in the Stanford Classic held at the Farm last weekend.
It Cervenka's pitching had rat
tled the Cardinal, it was nothing
compared to the betiiddlement ju
nior pitcher Dana Sorensen would
bring to No. 12 Georgia (21-3).
Sorensen recorded her first ca
reer no-hitter in the Cardinal's 2-0
win, allowing only four baserunners
while striking out 15. Sorensen
laced only 24 batters, three over the
minimum and didn't allow any past
first base.
Stanford's bats came alive in the
second inning to score the game's
only two runs. Le Cocq started the
rally with a single and was replaced
on the basepaths by sophomore
katherine Hoffman. Senior Cassi
Brangham reached on an error,
and freshman Catalina Morris fol
lowed with a single that drove in
I tollman and left Brangham on
third. Sophomore Michelle Thiry
singled in Brangham for the second
and final Stanford run.
Saturday's play was not similarly
successful for Stanford. The Cardi
nal's offensive woes continued in the
final round-robin game against
Texas A&M and in its first elimina
tion game against Georgia.
Stanford saw an early lead evap
orate late against the Aggies. The
Cardinal led 2-0 going into the top
of the sixth inning, but gave up
seven runs in the final two frames to
fall 7-3 to the Aggies.
Stanford was victimized by Ag
gies pitcher Lindsay YVilhelmson
from the mound and the plate. Wil
helmson allowed just three hits on
the day and gave A&M the lead for
good with a grand slam in the top of
(he sixth.

Saturday's second game only saw
things get worse — and weird —
tor the Cardinal.
Stanford entered the champi
onship phase of the tournament as
the fourth seed, in a rematch against
Georgia.
One day after no-hitting the
Bulldogs, Sorensen took the circle
against them again. There would be
a second no-hitter, but this time at
the Cardinal's expense.
"It's rare, I'm sure," said Kittman
of the consecutive no-hitters, "But
when you lace good teams that's al
ways a possibility."
Sophomore Michelle Green
didn't allow a hit to the Cardinal bat
ters, but gave Stanford plenty of
chances to score just the same.
Stanford loaded the bases in the
112 irst inning with one out on a combi
nation of two walks and a hit by
pitch, but (ireen struck out Le ( >ocq
and Brangham to snuff the threat.
The Cardinal threatened again
in the fourth inning with Le Cocq
and Thiry reaching base on walks
with just one out. Green settled
down again, however, and retired
the next two Stanford batters to end
the threat. Stanford went quietly in
the final three innings, managing
just one more baserunner.
The loss put Stanford into Sun
day's consolation game with a
chance to avenge Friday's defeat at
the hands of LBSU and Cervenka.
Sophomore Megan Sickler went
3-3 to pc>wer the offense to a 3-2 win.
Clung contributed a run and an
RBI triple in the Cardinal's three
run third inning.
Sorensen resumed her pitching
dominance and didn't allow a bit to
the 49ers over the final five innings
to collect the win and push her
record to 5-1.

laced only 24 batters, three over the
minimum and didn't allow any past
first base.
Stanford's bats came alive in the
second inning to score the game's
only two runs. Le Cocq started the
rally with a single and was replaced
on the basepaths by sophomore
katherine Hoffman. Senior Cassi
Brangham reached on an error,
and freshman Catalina Morris fol
lowed with a single that drove in
I tollman and left Brangham on
third. Sophomore Michelle Thiry
singled in Brangham for the second
and final Stanford run.
Saturday's play was not similarly
successful for Stanford. The Cardi
nal's offensive woes continued in the
final round-robin game against
Texas A&M and in its first elimina
tion game against Georgia.
Stanford saw an early lead evap
orate late against the Aggies. The
Cardinal led 2-0 going into the top
of the sixth inning, but gave up
seven runs in the final two frames to
fall 7-3 to the Aggies.
Stanford was victimized by Ag
gies pitcher Lindsay YVilhelmson
from the mound and the plate. Wil
helmson allowed just three hits on
the day and gave A&M the lead for
good with a grand slam in the top of
(he sixth.

Saturday's second game only saw
things get worse — and weird —
tor the Cardinal.
Stanford entered the champi
onship phase of the tournament as
the fourth seed, in a rematch against
Georgia.
One day after no-hitting the
Bulldogs, Sorensen took the circle
against them again. There would be
a second no-hitter, but this time at
the Cardinal's expense.
"It's rare, I'm sure," said Kittman
of the consecutive no-hitters, "But
when you lace good teams that's al
ways a possibility."
Sophomore Michelle Green
didn't allow a hit to the Cardinal bat
ters, but gave Stanford plenty of
chances to score just the same.
Stanford loaded the bases in the
112 irst inning with one out on a combi
nation of two walks and a hit by
pitch, but (ireen struck out Le ( >ocq
and Brangham to snuff the threat.
The Cardinal threatened again
in the fourth inning with Le Cocq
and Thiry reaching base on walks
with just one out. Green settled
down again, however, and retired
the next two Stanford batters to end
the threat. Stanford went quietly in
the final three innings, managing
just one more baserunner.
The loss put Stanford into Sun
day's consolation game with a
chance to avenge Friday's defeat at
the hands of LBSU and Cervenka.
Sophomore Megan Sickler went
3-3 to pc>wer the offense to a 3-2 win.
Clung contributed a run and an
RBI triple in the Cardinal's three
run third inning.
Sorensen resumed her pitching
dominance and didn't allow a bit to
the 49ers over the final five innings
to collect the win and push her
record to 5-1.
Although it's improbable that a tournament could be con
sidered a true classic in its first year of existence, this year's
Stanford Classic featured quality Softball throughout the
weekend that lived up to its misnomer. Of the 10 games, only
one was decided by more than two runs.

Women's Softball
Friday: Long Beach State 2, No. 11 Stanford 0
Friday: Stanford 2, No. 1 2 Georgia 0
Saturday: No. 21 Texas A&M 7, Stanford 3
Saturday: Georgia 2, Stanford 0
Sunday: Stanford 3, Long Beach State 2
at Speedline Invitational, Thursday-Sunday, TBA.

No. 11 Stanford (14-0) faced its toughest competition to
date and came away with a third-place finish and a 2-3 record
for the tournament.
No. 21 Texas A&M (16-7) claimed the Stanford Classic
title, with only one loss over the weekend.
Stanford had its share of impressive individual and team
performances, but fell victim to high-caliber pitching and a
lack of timely hitting, scoring only three runs combined in its
three losses.
"We've had opportunities," coach John Rittman said, "We
just haven't capitalized on them."
The Cardinal fell to Long Beach State (7-9) in their first
game of the tournament, 2-0. The 49ers' losing record belies
their talent, as they went 1-4 on the weekend, but were only
outscored by a total of six runs in their four losses.
In what would become a theme in the Cardinal's defeats
throughout the weekend, Stanford's offense threatened sev
eral times against Long Beach State, but never came through
with a run.
Stanford had runners in scoring position in the first, third
and sixth innings, the best chance coming in the first.
The Cardinal's chances fizzled, however, when LBSU
hut let Meredith Cervenka struck out senior first baseman
Maureen Le Cocq with runners on second and third to end
the tin eat.
Cervenka would only allow four more (Cardinal runners to
reach base in the next six innings. Stanford had a runner in
scoring position in the third and sixth, both times with two
outs already on the board-

Sophomore Leah Nelson and the bats of the Cardinal drove past Long Beach State 3-2 to
finish third in the Stanford Classic held at the Farm last weekend.
It Cervenka's pitching had rat
tled the Cardinal, it was nothing
compared to the betiiddlement ju
nior pitcher Dana Sorensen would
bring to No. 12 Georgia (21-3).
Sorensen recorded her first ca
reer no-hitter in the Cardinal's 2-0
win, allowing only four baserunners
