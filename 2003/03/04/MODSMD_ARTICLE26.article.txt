# Softball takes third in Cardinal Classic
## 
### LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although it's improbable that a tournament could be con
sidered a true classic in its first year of existence, this year's
Stanford Classic featured quality Softball throughout the
weekend that lived up to its misnomer. Of the 10 games, only
one was decided by more than two runs.

at Speedline Invitational, Thursday-Sunday, TBA.

No. 11 Stanford (14-0) faced its toughest competition to
date and came away with a third-place finish and a 2-3 record
for the tournament.
No. 21 Texas A&M (16-7) claimed the Stanford Classic
title, with only one loss over the weekend.
Stanford had its share of impressive individual and team
performances, but fell victim to high-caliber pitching and a
lack of timely hitting, scoring only three runs combined in its
three losses.
"We've had opportunities," coach John Rittman said, "We
just haven't capitalized on them."
The Cardinal fell to Long Beach State (7-9) in their first
game of the tournament, 2-0. The 49ers' losing record belies
their talent, as they went 1-4 on the weekend, but were only
outscored by a total of six runs in their four losses.
In what would become a theme in the Cardinal's defeats
throughout the weekend, Stanford's offense threatened sev
eral times against Long Beach State, but never came through
with a run.
Stanford had runners in scoring position in the first, third
and sixth innings, the best chance coming in the first.
The Cardinal's chances fizzled, however, when LBSU
hut let Meredith Cervenka struck out senior first baseman
Maureen Le Cocq with runners on second and third to end
the tin eat.
Cervenka would only allow four more (Cardinal runners to
reach base in the next six innings. Stanford had a runner in
scoring position in the third and sixth, both times with two
outs already on the board-
