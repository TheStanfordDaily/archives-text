# Falcons edge out Cardinal
## 
### WHITNEY SADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's regional rivals swooped in and
claimed the 2003 Western Regional (Cham
pionship this weekend, hut the .Air Force
men still had to lly back to Colorado know
ing they'd been beaten.
The Stanford men's fencing team placed
first at the 2003 Western Regional Champi
onship on Saturday in San Diego. The (Car
dinal's 68 points were enough to lop second
place Air Force's 65. The Cardinal women
finished second behind Air Force (63-54)
however, meaning that the combined scores
left the Falcons as the overall Western Re
gional Champions.
Both the Cardinal men's and women's
foil squads took first place in a pool that in
cluded Cal State-Fullerton, UC-San Diego,
and Cal Tech. Men's sabre also came in first.
Women's sabre and men's epee finished sec
ond, while women's epee struggled fora
fourth-place finish.
.Although (lie Cardinal men actually fell
15-12 to Air Force in their head-to-head
match, Stanford performed better than the
Falcons against the other three teams in
order to eke ahead in the final standings.
Stanford crushed Cal Tech (14-1), Fullerton
(20-7) and San Diego (22-5).
The Cardinal women, meanwhile, also
fell 15-12 to Air Force, but were unable to
make up for this loss by winning as defini

tively against the other schools. Stanford
women beat Cal Tech 7-5, Fullerton 18-9
and San 1 )iego 17-10. This dual meet against
.Air Forte improved upon last month's 18-9
defeat at the Falcons' talons.
The numerous individual standouts for
the Cardinal included overall regional
champions loilists senior Iris Zimmerman
and junior Florian Reichling and senior
sabrist Robert Owens. Foilist sophomore
Eva Petschnigg finished second overall indi
vidually, and sophomore loilist Steve Ger
berman and sabiists junior Meghan Everett
and freshman Jonathan Pearlstein all took
third in an impressive Cardinal showing.
Western Regionals were also important
because they serve as the primary determi
nants for the NC AA (championships, held at
Air Force March 25. Only two in each
weapon automatically qualify from the re
gion, so Zimmerman, Reichling, Owens,
and Petschnigg are all probable qualifiers as
a result of their first- and second-place fin
ishes in this weekend's competition, and
Gerberman also has a good chance to be se
lected due to his third-place finish this week
end combined with bis consistently strong
performances throughout the season.
(loach Lisa Milgram expressed hope that
other Stanford fencers would be selected to
travel to Colorado at the end of the month.
"We are going to try to get Meghan,
Jonathan and [freshman Martin Lee] in as
wild cards," she said.
