Sports Federation) split its weekend matches,
defeating No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara (6-14,3-11)
on Friday night and falling to No. (> Cal State-
Northridge (12-0, 8-5) on Saturday.
The Cardinal won three straight games to
win Friday's match after dropping a tight first
game 33-31.
"The first game was kind of sloppy," coach
Don Shaw said. "We kind ol threw things up for
grabs there."
The Cardinal had a chance to close out game
one when it had a game point at 29-28, but let it
slip away as Jan Carlo Zegarra and Keith Busam

Saturday: No. 6 Cal State Nortfiridge 3, No. 9 Stanford 1
vs. No. 10 Pacific, today, 7 p.m.

each came up with two key kills lor Nortbridge.
Stanford came out strong in the second game
and led from start to finish.
"1 just thought we started playing good de
fense," Shaw said. "We watched the balls. We
served aggressively."
After taking the second game 30-21, the (car
dinal continued its effective play and won game
three 30-20.
"In the fourth game, [UCSB] started to play
well again," senior middle blocker Paul Bocage
said. "(They started to] pick it up and we were
kind of fortunate at the end to pull it out and
make some good plays. I hey made some errors

and that's just kind of how the game goes."
The Cardinal benefited from Caucho errors
on 8 of the match's last 10 points.
On Saturday night, Stanford came out
strong with a 30-24 victory in the first game, but
lost its momentum and was never able to regain
control ol the match as senior middle blocker
Joe Nargi completely took over for the Mata
dors in their 3-1 win.
"[ Nargi] went back and started really ripping
into some serves," Shaw said. "We didn't handle
it very well. We got stuck in a couple rotations
and gave up a bunch of points. And you just
can't give up streaks of points like that."
Nargi finished with match-highs of 23 kills
and four service aces. I Ie compiled a .500 hit-
ting percentage on 40 total at
tempts.
"We didn't stop the guy who got
the most swings," Shaw said. "So
when the guy who's hitting the
most balls is hitting that well, that
means we're going to be in trou
ble."
Tonight the Cardinal will be
facing oil against No. 10 Pacific
(11-7, 8-4 MPSF) in rare week
night match at 7 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
The Tigers are fresh off of a
three game sweep over North
