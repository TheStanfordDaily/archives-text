# Divers compete in Pac-10 tourney
## Despite not capturing any titles, the men made a good showing in Washington 
### KRISTIN MORITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's diving team of
sophomore Adam Peterson and
senior Gavin Olmstead wrapped
up three days of Pacific-10 cham
pionship action Saturday in Feder
al Way, Washington. With still
competition from Arizona State,
Arizona and Southern California,
the Cardinal tested its strength on
the boards and fared well in prepa
ration for the NCAA qualifying
meet in March.
On the first day of competition,
Peterson finished fourth in the 3-
meter event with 536.00 points to
lead the Cardinal. Arizona State
freshman Joona Puhakka, an
Olympic diver from Finland, won
the event, blowing the competition
out of the pool by over 50 points.
USC's Ray Vincent took second
and Arizona's Josh Anderson took
third. Olmstead placed sixth with
503.00 points.
"We have seen good competi
tion from all of the competing
schools during the dual meet sea
son, but Joona is definitely the best
diver in the section," Peterson said.
1 leading into the 1-meter event
on the second day, Stanford once
again looked to compete with the
top contenders. Puhakka, though,
proved his prominence on the
boards, as he c laimed the top spot
with a score of 385.75 points. Pe
terson finished in seventh place
with 205.05 points. In the prelimi
naries of the competition, Olm
stead placed ninth, one spot short
of qualifying for the finals.
Finally, during Saturday's plat
form competition, Peterson once
again claimed the top spot for the
Cardinal. His final score of 433.55
earned him fifth place. Olmstead
took eighth with 390.95 points.
Puhakka failed to earn a clean
sweep of all three diving events, as
USC's Vincent nabbed the top
spot over Anderson. Puhakka took
third on the platform.
"I was pleased with my perfor
mances over the weekend," Peter
son said. "I made it to the finals in
.ill three events, whit h is tunc h bet
ter than last year, but as with every

other meet, I came hat k vviili some
things to work on before the next
meet."
Though the Pac-10 champi
onships allowed the divers to com
pete against other teams within the
region, it did not serve as a qualify
ing meet lor the NCAA champi
ons hi, >s. Instead, the divers'
chances of qualifying for the
NCAA championships hinge en
tirely on their performances at a
/.one meet in Oklahoma City,
March 14 tolfi. ()nly the top three
divers 112 rom each event at 11 it* zone
meet will automatically qualih lot
the NCAA meet at l exas.
Arizona, Arizona State, Califor

nia and Hrigham Young should all
field strong diving teams at the
zone meet in two weeks.
"Zones will be a good competi
tion," Peterson s;iid "As we head
into the meet, I am going to focus
on the 'holes' or places I broke
down at the Pac-10 competition."
Peterson added that for the re
maindci ol the season, the team
will concentrate on simulating the
atmosphere of competition during
practice. Instead of completing
multiple repetitions of each of
their dives, the divers will run se
quentially through their entire
"lists" â€” the dives tli.it they per
form in competition.
