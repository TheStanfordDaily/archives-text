## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Alejandro Toledo, the presi
dent of Peru and a Stanford grad
uate, will speak at the 2003 Com
mencement, the senior class presi
dents announced yesterday.
"The choice of President Tole
do at a time when international
events are at such a critical junc
ture will set the stage for an impor
tant and meaningful address to
graduates and their families and
friends," said University President
John Hennessy. "It is even more
fitting, given President Toledo's
strong ties to Stanford."
Toledo received master's de
grees from Stanford in education
and economics in 1972 and 1974,
respectively, and returned to ob
tain a doctorate in education in
1992.
After soliciting the senior class
for nominations in September, the
senior class presidents submitted a
list of 20 potential speakers to
Hennessy in late fall. The senior
dass presidents recommended
around five nominees, including

Toledo, to 1 lennessy. According to
James . Viva, one of the senior class
presidents, Toledo was among the
most popular nominees, which in
cluded former South African Pres
ident Nelson Mandela, the Dalai
Lama, Supreme Court Justice San
dra Day O'Connor and Bono of
U2, among others.
The nominees were discussed
with the Board of Trustees and
then the President's Office contact
ed potential speakers.
Toledo officially accepted the
invitation from the University yes

senior assistant to the president.
While last year's Commence

Advisor and former provost Con
doleezza Rice, was announced in
early February, Wachtel said that
the announcement of this year's
speaker came a month later simply
because it was difficult for Toledo
to be sure that he would be avail
able on June 15, the date of this
year's ceremony.
"When you have the president
of a country, it's more difficult than
it appears," Wachtel said. "[Tole

do] had unqualified interest in
this. It wasjust a matter of working
it out with his schedule."
Senior Class President James
Alva said that he did not know if
Toledo was the first nominee the
University invited to speak at
Commencement and added that
he would not have been able to dis
cuss the topic if he did know.
He added, "When they contact
ed Toledo, he was overwhelming
ly honored to do it and so excited
that we had asked him."
Alva said that, although Toledo
does not garner the same name
recognition as many of the other
nominees, he believes that the Pe
ruvian president's remarks will
touch upon issues pertinent to
graduating seniors, such at the im
portance of education and over
coming obstacles.
Though Toledo was born to a
poor family in the Andean high
lands of Peru, he ascended the
ranks of Peruvian politics to win
the presidency by a narrow major
