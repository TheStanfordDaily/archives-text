Editor's note: Former Daily editor Anuj Gupta inter
viewed Peruvian president and Stanford graduate Alejan
dro Toledo l/y plione three months after his inauguration.
The following are excerpts from an article that first ran on
Oct. 12, 2001.
In a 20-minute phone conversation from his ex
ecutive offices in Lima, Peruvian President Alejandro
Toledo discussed the tremendous impact of his Stan
ford experiences on his presidency, the crucial role
that education plays in his battle to eliminate pover
ty, the passionate social engagement that gripped the
campus when lie was here and his steadfast support
of the United States' war on terrorism.
"Stanford continues to be the center of my profes
sional formation," Toledo said. "It was there that I
decided I wanted to be president [of Peru J."
Toledo narrowly won the presidency following a
bitterly contested campaign. A year earlier, Toledo
had run against incumbent Alberto Fujimori, but
dropped out of the campaign alleging that the race
was rigged.
Fujimori resigned the presidency and fled to

japan in disgrace soon afterwards amid allegations of
corruption and bribery in his administration.

Peru backs U.S. war on terror
Toledo said his day began with a 7 a.m. call at
home from President Bush, during which he af-

firmed his nation's "absolute sup
port" for the U.S. military cam
paign against terrorism and
arranged a meeting with Bush.
Toledo said Peru "has lived
for 15 years under the cruel ef
fects of terrorism" during the
guerrilla battles that it has waged
within and with neighboring
countries.
"We've paid in 25,000 lives and
[billions of dollars] in destruction
and recessions, so it is very vivid in
the minds of Peruvians what ter
rorism means," he said.
The dramatic impact of the
Sept. 1 1 attacks on the global
economy has been magnified in
Peru because of the nation's re
liance on tourism, especially
from American travelers, Toledo
said.
"Forty-five percent of tourists in
Peru come from the U.S., and
[tourism] has decreased dramati
cally," he said.

Stanford plays Vital' role
In a nation where 54 percent
live below (he poverty line, Toledo
said his government's "main objec
tive" is eradicating the sort of
poverty that he himself lived
through.
Toledo left his spartan "shanty
town" home in the fishing town of
Chimbote in 1965, when he won a
local scholarship for high-achieving
students to study in the United
States, and enrolled at the Univer
sity of San Francisco.
The three degrees Toledo
earned at Stanford — a master's in
economics, and a master's and doc
torate in human resources at the
School of Education — are proving
"vital" to his agenda as president;
he said.
His doctoral thesis at Stanford
focused the impact of investments
in education on economic roles and
income distribution in Peru.
Toledo affirmed the critical link
between education and poverty.
"The basic philosophy of my
government is that the best way to

dramatically reduce poverty is to
invest significantly and aggressively
in the minds of our people [by] in
vesting in human resources, nutri
tion, health and education," Tole
do said.
"I do not share the principle of
just giving [people] fish. The best
way of confronting poverty is to pro
vide them the methods to learn how
to fish — and that is education."
Diversity, activism offer key lessons
An indigenous Andean, Toledo
is part of an ethnic group that has
always comprised a strong majority
of Peru's population, but lias re
mained downtrodden and politi
cally powerless since the age of the
Spanish conquistadors in the 16th
century.
Toledo said the diversity of the
Stanford student body taught him
an invaluable lesson in tolerance.
"Not only in the classroom but in
the interaction with diverse groups,
Stanford really helped me not to be
resentful lor discrimination," he
said.
"Now 1 light against discrimina

tion but it doesn't affect me, [be
cause] I learned that education
plays such a critical leveling and
equilibrium role," he said.
Not just an academic proposition'
The struggle to end poverty in
Peru will be a prolonged effort that
requires a long-term commitment,
Toledo stressed.
112 fe said he is "committed to the
vision" ofa Peru of economic equal
ity, which he said is "not just an aca
demic proposition."
"I come from extreme, extreme
poverty, and I have gone through
the Stanford-Harvard world,
Japan, the World Bank and now
I'm the president," he said. "I'm
not about to extrapolate from my
case and say that everyone can do
that. I'm the result of a statistical
error.
"What 112 am committed to is
that Peruvians who are poor have
the option to choose to be whatev
er they want, not as a result of a
statistical error, but as result of a
right to have health and educa
tion of quality."
