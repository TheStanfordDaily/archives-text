The Pakistani ambassador to the United Slates,
Ashraf Jahangir Qazi, underscored the importance of
the U.S.-Pakistan alliance in a speech yesterday in
Encina Hall. Qazi related Pakistan's domestic situa
tion and ongoing conflict with India to the United
States and the war on terrorism.
Qazi, who was appointed ambassador to the Unit
ed States in September of last year, opened his speech
by discussing the current U.S.-Pakistan alliance.
"There has recently been a series of articles calling
into question the value of Pakistan's partnership with
the United States and the war against terrorism,"
Qazi said. "(But] since 9/ 11, since the launch of Op
eration Enduring Freedom, Pakistan has become a
critical and crucial ally of the United States."
According to Qazi, approximately 500 Al-Qaida
suspects have been arrested by Pakistani security
forces and handed over to the U.S. government.
"The relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. is
going to be of fundamental importance," Qazi said." I
think that the administration and most people here
are aware of that, despite the fact that we have differ
ing perceptions of a number of issues."

Ashraf Jahangir Qazi, Pakistan's ambassador to the
United States, spoke yesterday in Encina Hall on the im
portance of the U.S.-Pakistan alliance in forging a more
stable, peaceful world.
bassador to Syria, Germany, Rus
sia and China, served as high com
missioner of Pakistan to India
from 1997 to 2002, when India
asked the Pakistani government to
recall him.
Qazi said that one of the key is
sues facing Pakistani foreign-poli
cy makers is the long-term dispute
with India over the region of Kash
mir.
Referring to India and Pak
istan as "nuclear neighbors,"
Qazi said that the governments of
both countries are looking to re
solve hostilities so that they may
focus more attention on domestic
concerns.
"There is only one country in the
world that takes the position that
Kashmir is an integral part of India
and that is India itself," Qazi said.
"We cannot put Kashmir on the
back burner because it would keep
infecting the atmosphere in which
we want to improve our relations."
The official point of view of the
United Nations is that Kashmir is a
disputed territory, Qazi said.
"If the issue remains unad
dressed and influences people and
public opinion, we won't be able to
develop an ambiance for the im
provement [of] any front of Indian
and Pakistani relations," he said.
According to Qazi, Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf wants
to open lines of communication

between the Pakistani and Indian
governments and plans to shift en
ergy toward resolving minor issues
the countries have the potential to
agree upon before focusing on
more controversial problems.
"Our policy is to contribute to
an environment which would help
us with our domestic agenda to
transform the economy," Qazi
said. "Bringing about a good envi
ronment will involve primarily
building up modus vivendi with
India."
Both nations are deeply con
cerned that the conflict is driving
away large corporations and tech
nology firms that could help im
prove their respective economies
and domestic situations, Qazi said.
He also said that Pakistan's
economy must undergo rapid ex
pansion before the government
will be able effectively combat
poverty.
"A sustained rapid growth rate
is the only way to bring down
poverty and the only way to bring
about participation of the people
in the decisions that affect their
lives," Qazi said. "If this doesn't
happen, people become vulnera
ble to all kinds of populism and
that can lead to the politics of ex
tremism."
Toward the end of his speech,
Qazi emphasized the close link be
tween poverty and the interna
tional development of terrorism.
"We see political extremism and
religious extremism largely be
cause of the failure of government
and elites to provide the type of so

cioeconomic transformation we
need," Qazi said. "Terrorism is the
pervasion of hopelessness, the per
ception that justice is not available.
"The war on terrorism has to ul
timately be a war against injustice,
desperation and hopelessness," he
said.
The Pakistani government does
not condone acts of terrorism re
gardless of the circumstances, Qazi
said, but the problem must be in
vestigated in order to be resolved.

"We have to hold out the hope
of justice and progress," lie said.
"You can't resolve problems, but
you can bring about a movement,
and one step in a thousand-mile
long journey makes it no longer a
thousand-mile-long journey."
The lunch-time event, which
was open to the public, was spon
sored by the Shorenstein Com
pany in cooperation with the
University and several other or
ganizations.
