# Several Title IX findings tabled
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige announced
last week that he would only review recommenda
tions from President George YV. Bush's Commis
sion on Opportunity in Athletics that were unani
mously supported by the commission. As a result,
Paige will not consider several of the commission's
more controversial suggested revisions because
some of the group's members refused to endorse
them.
The commission, co-chaired by Stanford Athletic
Director Ted Leland, was formed to review en
forcement of Title IX, a 1972 law that mandates
gender equity in athletics at educational institu
tions.
Paige announced this decision only hours after
receiving the commission's written report last week.
In a statement issued last Wednesday night,
Paige emphasized that the group "was able to agree
on some important recommendations" and that his
department "intends to move forward only on
those."
According to (lie San Francisco Chronicle, two
committee members—Julie Foudy, captain of the
U.S. Women's National Soccer
Team, and Donna de Varona, a
gold-medalist Olympic
swimmer — were strongly
against eight of the 23 proposals
and ultimately refused to sign the
report.
"They didn't even acknowl
edge that discrimination exists for
women," Foudy told The New
York Times. "We just felt that we
fought hard fora minority voice,
but that that wasn't given enough
weight."
According to The Times, Ice
land said that he had tried to re
word parts of the report to bring
about a consensus.

"l'm disappointed I wasn't able
to broker something they could
live with," he said. "I think there
were lots of detail and tone is
sues."
As a result, Paige will no longer
consider some of the commis
sion's recommendations, includ
ing suggestions that schools
should be able to consider the
number of available slots on a
team instead of the number of
athletes actually on the team's ros
ter to prove Title IX compliance.
Schools can currently demon
strate compliance with Title IX in
three different ways. They can ei
ther provide opportunities for
women to play on team sports
proportionally equal to the over
all gender distribution of the stu
dent body, show yearly gains to
ward achieving increased equity

or show that they are already
meeting on-campus female sports
interest.
The panel's co-chair, WNBA
basketball star Cynthia Cooper,
told the San Francisco Chronicle
that she supported the report as a
whole and felt it would have been
very difficult to forge any further
agreement among the commis
sion's dissenting members.
"The only way to accommo
date them was to use all their pro
posals, all their findings, all their
recommendations," Cooper said.
"And at the end of the day, we
would have done absolutely noth
ing. Then they would have been
satisfied."
The 15-member Title IX panel
was organized last June and ini
tially reported its findings earlier
this month.
