KZSU, Stanford's one and only radio
station, lias long been a source tor commer
cial-free live and DJed music shows of all
genres, up-to-date Stanford sports cover
age and in-depth Stanford and local news
reporting. But in addition to providing
campus with programming specific to the
Farm, KZSU has served as an outlet for stu
dents to explore their interest in music,
sports or news in a new medium, broad
casting â€” helping many students suddenly
realize that they were destined for the radio
industry.
The activities of KZSU go far beyond
Stanford. The station's signal covers the
whole Bay Area, yet has a unique style and
sound relative to other stations on the air.
And KZSU is not a genre-specific or top-40
station.
Senior Eric Pop, general manager of
KZSU, said, "With about 100,000 records
in our library and over 100 new ones pour

ing in every week, we probably cover the
widest range of musical styles in the Bay
Area."
KZSU does not play any commercials
and is instead funded by Stanford student
fees as well as underwriting and listener
donations.
Senior Toby Hyde, who has worked at
KZSU for three years and does play-by-play
for men's basketball, noted the flexibility
this grants the DJs for the station.
"We have the opportunity to do what we
want," he said. "In the music department,
this leads to an amazing selection because
(the DJs] aren't beholden to advertisers and
the music industry."
DJs for the station, who are typically
Staiif( >rd st iiclents <>r I<xrals, play everything
from the mainstream genres of country,
jazz and hip-hop to lesser-known genres
such as noisecore, rockabilly, and surf.
Besides DJs spinning records, KZSU
also has a live music show, Wednesday
