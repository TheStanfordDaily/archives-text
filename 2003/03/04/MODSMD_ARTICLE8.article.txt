KZSU, Stanford's one and only radio
station, lias long been a source tor commer
cial-free live and DJed music shows of all
genres, up-to-date Stanford sports cover
age and in-depth Stanford and local news
reporting. But in addition to providing
campus with programming specific to the
Farm, KZSU has served as an outlet for stu
dents to explore their interest in music,
sports or news in a new medium, broad
casting — helping many students suddenly
realize that they were destined for the radio
industry.
The activities of KZSU go far beyond
Stanford. The station's signal covers the
whole Bay Area, yet has a unique style and
sound relative to other stations on the air.
And KZSU is not a genre-specific or top-40
station.
Senior Eric Pop, general manager of
KZSU, said, "With about 100,000 records
in our library and over 100 new ones pour

ing in every week, we probably cover the
widest range of musical styles in the Bay
Area."
KZSU does not play any commercials
and is instead funded by Stanford student
fees as well as underwriting and listener
donations.
Senior Toby Hyde, who has worked at
KZSU for three years and does play-by-play
for men's basketball, noted the flexibility
this grants the DJs for the station.
"We have the opportunity to do what we
want," he said. "In the music department,
this leads to an amazing selection because
(the DJs] aren't beholden to advertisers and
the music industry."
DJs for the station, who are typically
Staiif( >rd st iiclents <>r I<xrals, play everything
from the mainstream genres of country,
jazz and hip-hop to lesser-known genres
such as noisecore, rockabilly, and surf.
Besides DJs spinning records, KZSU
also has a live music show, Wednesday
Night Live, which features local
bands. The winner of last weekend's
Battle of the Bands will play on the
show next week.
KZSU does not just solely play
music. There is a diverse range of
other programming on the sta
tion's airwaves — public affairs
programming, public service an
nouncements, live broadcasts of
important Stanford events, the
weekly Palo .Alto City Council on
Monday nights and other specials.
During the school year, there are
live broadcasts of Stanford sport
ing events.
"We cover the most Stanford
sports of any radio station, we
broadcast the ASS U presidential de
bates and are generally a unique
platform for Stanford students and
community members to make their
voices heard," Pop said.
Freshman Sean Bruich, who
just began broadcasting baseball
games a couple weeks ago, says
that he loves his new role at the sta

tion doing commentary on the
games.
"Baseball has always been a big
part of my life and I've always en
joyed listening to baseball on the
radio, so this is like a dream come
true to be able to work for KZSU,"
he said. "KZSU is journalism-fo
cused but adds a new element. It's
a whole new skill I had to learn."
In terms of non-sporting news,
the KZSU news department's main
news talk show, "Things We Want
to Tell You," is entirely student-run.
News director sophomore Sophie
Alcorn noted that the show allowed
voices of all dilferent political per
suasions to be heard.
"The show provides a forum for
finding out more about people on
campus. Additionally, it creates a
bridge between Stanford and the
greater Peninsula in that people
from all over call in to comment,"
she said.
Alcorn also noted that the news
department was planning to ex
pand in spring quarter by adding
nightly news reports.
Some of the students who work
at KZSU have been inspired by their
roles at the station and are interest-

Ed in pursuing a future in radio
broadcasting. One of these students
is Hyde, who is pursuing a sports
broadcast career and is currently
busy sending out tapes to various
radio stations.
"I always knew 1 loved sports,
but didn't realize how much 1
would enjoy broadcasting," he
said. "As a senior, I can't think of
anything I'd rather do next year
and that makes up for the lousy
salaries in the industry. I get to call
looking at shooting percentages
'research.' There really isn't any
thing better in the world fora
sports junkie like me."
This is not to say, however, that
everyone at the station is planning
to pursue careers in the radio indus
try. Junior Chuan-Mei Lee, the
other news director of the station,
said she enjoyed volunteering at
KZSU not because she plans to go
into a media profession but "be
cause it's fun and different."
Pop emphasized that anyone
could get involved at the station, no
matter what their interests.
"We run a broadcast-training
class, free and open to all Stanford
students and community members,

ever)' quarter, including the sum
mer," Pop said. " They usually start
the second week of classes and run
for six to seven weeks. Alter taking
the class and submitting a demo
tape, new DJs can apply for air spots
of their own as soon as the following
quarter. However, they can get in
volved sooner than that by doing
music reviews or attending station
meetings."
"As an all-volunteer station
KZSU simply runs on the dedica
tion ol its staff," Pop said.
KZSU is now making its pres
ence on campus known not only on
the airwaves of 90.1 KM but through
the new "KZSU CoHo Tuesdays."
Since the beginning of this month,
live KZSU DJs are now featured
every Tuesday from 9 p.m. to mid
night, playing the wide diversity of
music that has come to define the
station.
The purpose of CoHo Tuesdays
is to "create publicity for KZSU, ex
pose Stanford students to new
music, and maybe make campus a
little liipper," according to Eric
Katz, a mathematics graduate stu
dent who is better known on the sta
tion as I)J Eric K!.
