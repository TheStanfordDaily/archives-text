# Lysistrata Project seeks peace through the classics

### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Can reading a 2,000-year-old
play avert a war?
The members of the Stanford
community who brought the Lysis
trata Project to campus yesterday
think it might help.
Through readings of Aristo
phanes' ancient Greek play "Lysis
trata," organizers related classical
literature to the current U.S. politi
cal situation in an attempt to bridge
the two.
"Reading the play in this context
of conflict with Iraq is a way to raise
consciousness," said Richard Mar
tin, ( '.lassies Department chair and
event organizer. "Has the West
been built on conflict? Can we re
structure society to avoid it? Can
peaceful action and art, or denying
ourselves pleasure — sex, food or
SUV's — change things?"
The play tells the story of an
Athenian woman, Lysistrata, who

rallies other women from Athens,
Sparta and beyond to join together
in a sex strike to force their hus
bands to end the Peloponnesian
War. Lysistrata also organizes the
women to take over the Acropolis
to take over the central bank.
At noon yesterday, members of
the Stanford community gathered
in White Plaza for the first reading
of the day. Undergraduate and
graduate students participated in
the reading, which was accompa
nied by a percussion section.
Arden Thomas, a graduate stu
dent in drama, participated in the
afternoon reading.
"I think it's wonderful that there
are so many people and artists in
solidarity with each other all over
the entire world who are coming
together on this day to send out this
anti-war statement through this
play that's thousands of years old,"
Thomas said.
