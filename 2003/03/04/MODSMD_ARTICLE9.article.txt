# Lysistrata Project seeks peace through the classics

### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Can reading a 2,000-year-old
play avert a war?
The members of the Stanford
community who brought the Lysis
trata Project to campus yesterday
think it might help.
Through readings of Aristo
phanes' ancient Greek play "Lysis
trata," organizers related classical
literature to the current U.S. politi
cal situation in an attempt to bridge
the two.
"Reading the play in this context
of conflict with Iraq is a way to raise
consciousness," said Richard Mar
tin, ( '.lassies Department chair and
event organizer. "Has the West
been built on conflict? Can we re
structure society to avoid it? Can
peaceful action and art, or denying
ourselves pleasure — sex, food or
SUV's — change things?"
The play tells the story of an
Athenian woman, Lysistrata, who

rallies other women from Athens,
Sparta and beyond to join together
in a sex strike to force their hus
bands to end the Peloponnesian
War. Lysistrata also organizes the
women to take over the Acropolis
to take over the central bank.
At noon yesterday, members of
the Stanford community gathered
in White Plaza for the first reading
of the day. Undergraduate and
graduate students participated in
the reading, which was accompa
nied by a percussion section.
Arden Thomas, a graduate stu
dent in drama, participated in the
afternoon reading.
"I think it's wonderful that there
are so many people and artists in
solidarity with each other all over
the entire world who are coming
together on this day to send out this
anti-war statement through this
play that's thousands of years old,"
Thomas said.
The Lysistrata Project was start
ed by Kathryn Blume and Sharron
Bower, two actors in New York
City who wanted to take a stand
against the potential war on Iraq. A
scant six weeks after the project
was initiated, people across the
world were planning to participate
in the event. Over 1,000 readings
worldwide were scheduled to
occur yesterday.
Last night, there was a slightly
more formal evening reading in
Cubberley Auditorium. It consist
ed of a panel discussion of issues
pertaining to the play and ex
cerpts from "Lysistrata," conclud
ing with an open-microphone ses
sion in which the audience could
voice their reactions to the work.
The panel consisted of Martin,

English Prof. Hilton Obenzinger,
Allison Glazebrook, an I-Hum
teaching fellow, and Classics Prof.
Joy Connolly.
"Critics will say ... that this is a
useless effort, tl lat this is a side show to
the real political story that is happen
ing in Washington," Connolly said.
"I disagree with that because I've
seen the boundaries between enter
tainment and political discourse
blurred in American culture."
The evening audience consisted
almost entirely of people from out
side the Stanford community, which
surprised Matt Allen, formerly of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
"I was a little disappointed in the
size of the turnout," he said. "I
thought that from Stanford there'd
be a much larger turnout... I
would have thought they'd be
somewhat more concerned."
The event was organized at
Stanford by Martin, Kris Salata, a
graduate student in the Drama De
partment, and others from the
Drama and Classics Departments.
