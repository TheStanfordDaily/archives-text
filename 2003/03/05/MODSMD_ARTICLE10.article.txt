# Raising questions about health care access
## Victim of transplant error buried 
### 
LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) —
Jesica Santillan, the Mexican
teenager who died last month after
a bungled heart-lung transplant,
was laid to rest in a rural North Car
olina cemetery Tuesday as the ethi
cal debate over her treatment con
tinued to swirl.
The 17-year-old girl's small
white coffin was slipped into a mau
soleum wall and covered with a slab
of pink granite as her parents
watched. On a sunny, springlike
day, some 100 mourners gathered
at the small graveyard east of Louis
burg for the outdoor service.
Plans to bury Jesica in Mexico
were abandoned because there was
no guarantee her illegal immigrant
parents would be allowed to return
to the United States afterward.
Critics have said American citi
zens should have priority for trans
plants. But transplant groups say it
is only fair to give some organs to
foreigners because they also donate
organs to U.S. patients.
At the funeral, Nita Mahoney,
whose husband started a charitable
foundation in Jesica's name,
seemed to hint at the controversy
over whether the girl should have
been on the long list of desperate
transplant candidates.
"Love has no colors to it, and it

crosses all rivers and nations," Ma
honey said. "That was the only thing
we wanted to do, was help a child.
And in Jesica's memory, we will."
In an operation Feb. 7, Jesica
was mistakenly given organs of
the wrong blood type. Her body
rejected the organs, and a match
ing transplant about two weeks
later came too late to save her. She
died Feb. 22 at Duke University
Medical Center.
Some have questioned whether
the second transplant was proper
and whether the organs could have
saved the lite of another patient.
Others questioned why an illegal
immigrant received such high-in
tensity medical care.
Ron Woodard, president of a
group called N.C. Listen that favors
restricting immigration, said Jesi
ca's situation was tragic.
"But if I was a person on the
waiting list," Woodard told The
News & Observer of Raleigh, "I'm
sure the thought would run
through my mind: Why were or
gans given to someone who was
here illegally?"
Hospital officials said they have
the discretion to put foreign citi
zens, including illegal immigrants,
on the national waiting list for
transplants. And the United Net

work for Organ Sharing, which
oversees the distribution of organs
nationwide, allows up to 5 percent
of recipients to be from other coun
tries.
"Part of the rationale is that it
may be hypocritical to accept
donors who are not U.S. citizens,
but not allow them to be transplant
recipients," said Joel Newman,
UNOS spokesman.
A major factor in deciding who
gets a transplant is ability to pay.
The federal government pays for
some emergency medical services,
but does not cover illegal immi
grants who were unable to pay.
Jesica was unusual among illegal
immigrants in that she had health
insurance, provided through her
mother's job at Louisburg College.
Family friend Mack Mahoney said
the insurance will pay for 80 percent
and a foundation he created to help
the Santillans could cover the rest.
Lawyers for the girl's family say
they haven't decided whether to
sue the hospital.
"She came as close to being an
angel on earth as anyone," attor
ney Frank Cassiano said. "This girl
was brave every day of her life.
Duke needs to be aware there's
nothing I'm not going to do to
paint this picture."
