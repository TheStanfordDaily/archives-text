MAN 11 A, Philippines (AP) —
A bomb planted inside a back
pack ripped through an airport
terminal in the southern Philip
pines yesterday, killing at least 21
people — including an American
missionary — and injuring 148
in the nation's worst terrorist at
tack in three years.
Authorities said today that
Five Moro Islamic Liberation
Front members had been arrest
ed in connection with the blast
and were being questioned. No
one has claimed responsibility
for the bombing.
The blast at Davao airport
comes at a time of heightened de
bate over the role of U.S. troops
in the war on terror in the Philip
pines, where Muslim insurgents
have battled the government for
decades with attacks, bombings
and kidnappings.
Susan Madrid, spokeswoman
for the Davao civil defense, said
21 people were killed, including
an American missionary, and
148 were injured. She said two of
the injured died overnight.
There were no details on the lat
est fatalities, but the earlier
deaths included a boy, a girl, 10
men and seven women.
Three Americans — a South
ern Baptist missionary and her
two young children — were
among the wounded.
President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo, who invited U.S. troops
to help train Filipino soldiers in
counterterrorism, said the
bombing at Davao airport on
Mindanao island was"a brazen
act of terrorism which shall not
go unpunished."
Arroyo arrived in Davao
Wednesday to visit the bombing
site. A high-ranking delegation
led by the nation's police chief
and the interior secretary in

spected the damaged airport ter
minal, where workers used
brushes to clean blood stains
from the ground.
President Bush condemned
the attack as a "wanton terrorist
act" and sent condolences to the
people of the Philippines, his
press secretary Ari Fleischer said.
"The president notes that the
bombing underscores the seri
ousness of the terrorist threat in
the southern Philippines, and
he emphasizes that the Philip
pines have been a stalwart part
ner of the United States in the
war against terror," Fleischer
said.
Interior Secretary Jose Lina
said that the five suspects were
undergoing questioning. "There
is a basis for their arrest and there
is evidence on them," he said,
without elaborating.
The military has blamed
Moro rebels fora string of at
tacks, including a car bombing at
nearby Cotabato airport last
month that killed one man.
U.S. special forces are train
ing Philippine soldiers in
counter-terrorism tactics in the
city of Zamboanga, about 250
miles west of the scene of yester
day's attack.
Fid Kabalu, spokesman for
the rebel group, which has been
fighting for Muslim self-rule in
the predominantly Roman
Catholic Philippines for more
than three decades, denied his
group was responsible. He con
demned the attack and said the
group was ready to cooperate in
an investigation.
Police said the bomb was hid
den inside a backpack planted in
the middle of the airport's wait
ing area. The blast was heard
three miles away; some of the de
bris landed on the tarmac 100

yards away.
The Southern Baptist Con
vention's International Mission
Board in Richmond, Va., con-
Firmed that missionary William
P. Hyde, 59, of Cedar Rapids,
lowa, died in surgery from head
and leg injuries.
Hyde had gone to the airport
to meet American missionaries
Barbara Wallis Stevens and Mark
Stevens and their family, who
were had just arrived from Mani
la when the bomb went off.
"I just heard it explode to my
side," said Barbara Wallis
Stevens, 33, of Willard, Mo., who
was slightly wounded. "I was car
rying my infant son so I grabbed
my daughter and picked her up
and ran away. I was afraid there
could be more bombs."
Her 10-month-old son
Nathan was hit by shrapnel and
sustained an injur)' to his liver,
but a doctor at Davao Medical
Center said he was out of danger.
Her daughter was also injured
but released after treatment. The
family has lived in Davao, on
southern Mindanao island, for
five years doing missionary work
with indigenous tribes.
Hyde, a former music teacher,
had been a missionary since
1978. He and his wife Lyn have
two grown sons, one of whom is a
missionary in Cambodia.
David Miller, pastor of North
brook Baptist Church in Cedar
Rapids, called Hyde "kind of the
teddy bear type -kind, gentle and
always smiling."
"The irony of a man that sweet
and kind being killed in an act of
terror and hatred is just really
sad," Miller said.
"They knew that it was dan
gerous over there," he added.
"They were on our prayer sheet
week bv week for their safety."

The Southern Baptist Con
vention's International Mission
Board in Richmond, Va., con-
Firmed that missionary William
P. Hyde, 59, of Cedar Rapids,
lowa, died in surgery from head
and leg injuries.
Hyde had gone to the airport
to meet American missionaries
Barbara Wallis Stevens and Mark
Stevens and their family, who
were had just arrived from Mani
la when the bomb went off.
"I just heard it explode to my
side," said Barbara Wallis
Stevens, 33, of Willard, Mo., who
was slightly wounded. "I was car
rying my infant son so I grabbed
my daughter and picked her up
and ran away. I was afraid there
could be more bombs."
Her 10-month-old son
Nathan was hit by shrapnel and
sustained an injur)' to his liver,
but a doctor at Davao Medical
Center said he was out of danger.
Her daughter was also injured
but released after treatment. The
family has lived in Davao, on
southern Mindanao island, for
five years doing missionary work
with indigenous tribes.
Hyde, a former music teacher,
had been a missionary since
1978. He and his wife Lyn have
two grown sons, one of whom is a
missionary in Cambodia.
David Miller, pastor of North
brook Baptist Church in Cedar
Rapids, called Hyde "kind of the
teddy bear type -kind, gentle and
always smiling."
"The irony of a man that sweet
and kind being killed in an act of
terror and hatred is just really
sad," Miller said.
"They knew that it was dan
gerous over there," he added.
"They were on our prayer sheet
week bv week for their safety."
