## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Support the student strike 
### 
You have a choice today. You can wake
up and go to class. You can pretend
nothing is different. Or you can stand
up for your beliefs: You can skip class
and protest the war.
Across the country and around the world,
students and professors at 300 universities are
attending teach-ins and talks about the possible
war in Iraq. Missing class seems like an unusual
way to oppose a war — but for students and fac
ulty, this is the best way to make their voices
heard.
For one day, Stanford students can take time
out of their busy, grade-focused lives to learn
about national affairs that affect everyone. As

someone in the Bush administration is bound to
notice.
Some students remain apathetic to a possible
war, claiming that it lies outside their everyday
lives. This is not the case. Students will be di
rectly affected by foreign policy decisions, re
flected in major cuts in the education budget,
higher taxes and increased gas prices. For these
reasons, student participation in this strike is
vital.
Moreover, students should lake this time to
reflect on the ways that a war would impact their
peers who might fight overseas, as well as the
Iraqi civilians who will undoubtedly suffer the
consequences of such a grievous action.

one student told The
New York Times re
cently, "We're walking
out of our classes be
cause it's completely
ridiculous that students
in Iraq, who are exactly
the same as us, will have
to face the consequences
of a unilateral war."
One of the biggest ar

For the past few
weeks, students have
tried a variety of differ
ent methods to voice
their opposition to the
war. Some have sent
letters to government
officials; others have sat
in White Plaza fasting
for peace.
Most recently, pro

celled class have shown
good initiative by supporting student efforts.
Their conviction is admirable, as even the most
important lectures can surely wait a day in light
of this important historic moment.
Today, all of those protesting voices will be
heard collectively. Thousands of students are
refusing to sit through another lecture and in
stead have decided to teach each other about
the concerns and considerations of war. If the
United States goes to war, those students who
took just one day to speak up for their rights
and values will rest assured that they did the
right thing.
Most students skip a class every once in a
while to sleep in or to finish a paper, but if
there's one legitimate reason to miss class today,
it's to show your opposition to a possible war in
Iraq.

protests is that they don't have time to research
the issues. This is the day to change that. Clam
pus organizers have an impressive list of speak
ers and student groups who will teach today.
These are lectures that will be worth attending.
The strike's opponents may claim that skip
ping school accomplishes nothing. Clearly,
President Bush has failed so far to listen to mil
lions of protesters when making foreign policy
decisions. But if students shrug their shoulders
in defeat and head to the classroom today, they
forfeit a golden opportunity to participate in
democracy.
Students still have an obligation to make their
voices heard. Some visible action is better than
none at all. As tomorrow's political, business,
governmental, legal and academic leaders, Stan
ford students cannot afford to turn up their
noses at a chance for unprecedented attention.
Students have a responsibility to speak up and
make the world better for everyone.
Organizers expect 1,0()0 Stanford students to
attend what could be the largest nationwide
strike since the Vietnam War. If enough people
show up on campus and across the country,
