# THE
						FROSH FILES
## Gandhi walked, why don't you?

Today you're probably
debating many serious
issues with your friends
and professors about
the possibility of a war in Iraq. But
now it's time to think about some
thing that people on this campus
seriously talk about everyday: the
question of whether to bike or not
to bike.
It is an important decision that
everyone must make early in their
freshman year and most choose to
bike. A few, like me, decide not to
follow the norm. We avoid the
peer pressure, strap on our walk
ing shoes and well, walk. We are
the "walkies," and we pride our
selves in the fact that we shun the
type of transportation better suit
ed to middle schoolers.
I don't really see the benefit of
biking overall. Sure, it helps you
get places more quickly, but leav
ing for class just a few minutes ear
lier is something that can remedy
that problem.
Also, it takes someone with
good control (or just sheer luck)
to maneuver through some of the
busier parts of campus during
peak biking hours. I think Stan
ford should invest in a chopper to
give live biking traffic updates. I
can see it now: major backup (or
sig-alerts for you SoCal people)
on the corner of Lasuen Mall and
Escondido Mall
It always seems like the people
on bikes don't know what the hell
they're doing. I can't remember
all the times I've had to stop sud
denly or jump into a nearby bush,
all in order to avoid some crazy

Owning a bike means
having greater responsi
bility and who wants
more responsibility in
college? You have to take
it, lock it and get it
registered. Way too
much effort for a
sad piece of metal

dude with sun
glasses yelling,
"Get out of my
way — I can't
stop this thing!" I
once saw a girl
who couldn't
stop her bike
coming down a
hill near Meyer
Library — she lit-

erally jumped of! onto the pave
ment as the bike slammed into the
racks.
I especially hate those people
who ride their bikes without hold
ing the damn handlebars. They
always have to be doing some
thing else, like clapping or knit
ting— "Look Ma, no hands!"
That's nice, deary. I swear, the
next person I see riding with no
hands, I am going to stretch out
my arm and clothesline his butt.

Owning a bike means having
greater responsibility and who
wants more responsibility in col
lege? Yon have to take it, lock it
and get it registered. Way too
much effort fora sad piece of
metal. 1 already know three people
who have had their bikes stolen.
Plus, the Stanford Police seems to
have nothing better to do than to
give bikers tickets for not having a
light at night. There are so many
rules and regulations in place for
owning and operating a bike, we
should be cleared for handling
chemical weapons as well.
Nonetheless, I can't fathom drop
ping hundreds of dollars on a form
of transportation that can actually
make life less pleasant.
1 find walking to be a spiritual
thing. It allows me to meditate on
things like: What should I write
about in my next column? What is
my stance on the Israeli-Palestini
an conflict? Why is that sketchy
looking dude not wearing any
pants? If I were riding my bike, all
that would be going through my
head would be: Must get to class. I
can't stop this thing! Jump into the
bush, dude!
Now, I know I am in the mi
nority in my opinion. I read some
where there are more registered
bikes on campus than there are
students. So, to all the walkies out
there, I say: fight the good light.
Keep on that walking tradition.
Keep jumping into that bush.

Try biking to White Plaza with all of the
strikers today. If you make it, tell me all
about it at mosqueda@stanford.edu.
