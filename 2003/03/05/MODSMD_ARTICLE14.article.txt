Stanford Police need to treat Stanford not
as a city, but as a college campus
I want to respond to Tim Meyer's guest
column "Excessive parking ticketing
opressive, expensive" (March 3.) First, I
want to be clear that I don't agree with how
he went about arguing his case. Attacking
police officers on a personal level or ques
tioning their salaries does no good.
That said, the real issue that I see is that
the current police and parking enforce
ment on campus is not aligned with Uni
versity life or the relaxed atmosphere that
I've come to enjoy in my time here. Stan
ford is unique in that it is a college campus
— we're not a small city or even a nice sub
urb. And so I think it's understandable to
expect the police on campus to adjust to
that difference. Students under the age
limit are going to drink and walk home
drunk at night; students are going to create
parking spots when the University does
not provide available options; students and
faculty alike arc going to occasionally roll
through stop signs as they bike to ( lass.
These kinds of things don't take away

from life at Stanford or make it more dan
gerous; they make it a more enjoyable
plat e to be. But responding to what some
say is an alcohol problem by handing out
Mil's or stepping up the ticketing for
parking is not the solution. It's making
the general feeling on campus more hos
tile with more animosity towards the Stan
ford Police and the University. It's one
thing to attempt to create a safe environ
ment on campus; it is another to target
students and attempt to punish behavior
that's acceptable fora college campus and
really doesn't need punishing. We are
adults and life is different on a college
campus, especially one as sheltered as
Stanford. The police officers and the
parking enforcement need to adjust their
policies to the environment.

Need for more politically
diverse cartoons
While I profess no political affiliation or
inclination, I find it odd that The Daily,
which proclaims the same stance, only pub
lish political cartoons of the liberal persua
sion. There must fx* more conservative or

moderate political cartoonists out there
than zero. How about let's see what pictures
they are painting of our present issues?

There is more to life than where one
attends college
I am responding to Andrew Chen's let
ter "Affirmative action practices unfair to
Asian Americans" (March 3.) He whines
about the unfairness of affirmative action
practices to Asian Americans. What he fo
cused on too much was affirmative action
with respect to college admissions. There
is more to life than school.
I've got news for him — affirmative ac
tion benefits Asians more than it hurts, if
you expand your insular views outside of
the Ivy League schools. Trust me, this is
coming from someone who used to think
that affirmative action was the reason he
got rejected by MIT and from someone
who fora time was quite bitter about il.
I got rejected from MIT 13 years ago,
and I figured it was probably bet a use there
were too many Asian kids there already.
Well, they were right —there are 100
many Asian kids there already. The prob

leni with the Asian community is that there
is too much of a focus on higher education
and too much showmanship in getting into
the "right" schools. It's as if these kids based
their identify on what Ivy League school
they got into. That's a sad life. If anything,
maybe these brainiacs who got dinged
from MIT should end up at State U —
and then maybe they'd diversify into fields
other than math, science, engineering or
medicine. In the long run, the Asian com
munity benefits more if fewer of us went to
MIT and worked for disco and if more of
us went to State U and founded Cisco. Just
ask the legions of Asian engineers from
MIT (and Stanford) who work for people
that graduate (or dropped out of) Stale U.
Would they trade places? Probably. In
short, the Asian community needs to diver
sify — and not place its bets on higher ed
ucation. There are things out there other
than Ivy League schools, and you wonder
why few Asian kids end up in the military,
entertainment and sports.
So after getting dinged from MIT, how
did I come to realize that the Asian com
munity benefits more from affirmative ac
tion than not? Well, I ended up at West
Point, where no doubt affirmative action
played a role in my admissions process. I
ended up in the Army, where I corn

manded a company fora brief time,
where affirmative action played another
role in my selection. And later on, I
watched people like Eric Shinseki rise up
through the ranks, where affirmative ac
tion no doubt played a role in his selection
as Chief-of-StafT of the Army. In (he
Army, promotions for officers are based
on a centralized board process.
However, whether you like it or not,
promotion is based on affirmative action.
Minority officers need to be promoted at
rates comparable to white officers, or else
the Army forces the board to go back and
reconsider the candidates' files all over
again. I hat's a direct result of affirmative
action. Not a bad system, 1 think, and it
has nothing to do with college admissions.
Io say that affirmative action policies
hurt Asians because it restricts admissions
to top colleges is to adopt a very insular
view of the world and frankly shows a lack
of understanding of the complexities of
affirmative action. So you got that rejec
tion letter from Stanford that says "Sorry,
you are otherwise qualified but we just
can't take you." Deal with it — it won't he
the last time in life that yon will be reject
ed. And honestly, even if we got rid of af-
firmative action, do you really think that
the University will allow Asian enroll
ment to go higher than it is now? Yeah —
and I think Boalt Hall became all Asian
after 209 was passed.
Don't worry, not getting into Stanford
is not the end of the world. If anything,
you just saved yourselves $ 160,000 for an
otherwise overrated education.
Getting dinged from MIT was the best
thing that ever happened to me.
