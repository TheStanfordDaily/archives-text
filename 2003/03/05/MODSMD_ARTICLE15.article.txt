# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Affirmative action recognizes, helps marginalized groups 
### TIMMY LU ERIC SHIH GUEST COLUMNISTS 
In the Feb. 28 column, "Practices of af
firmative action are suspect," Samuel Rang
and David Yau challenged the considera
tion of race in college admissions as being
inconsistent with the principles of social eq
uity and diversity. Their attack on affirma
tive action rests upon a number of dubious
assertions, which are wholly inconsistent
with the realities of our present society.
Rang and Yau assume racism to be a relic
of the past. They see affirmative action ad
dressing the "legacy of injustice" without ac
knowledging the serious discrimination that
continues to oppress people today. By argu
ing that certain minority groups "cannot
claim the same level of historical maltreat
ment" as others, Rang and Yau ignore the
present racial barriers which prevent equal
access to educational resources. .Also worth
noting is their assumption that some objec
tive measure of oppression exists, as if the
pain of racism, hatred, exclusion and ex
ploitation can be quantified and classified.
From this faulty framework, Rang and
Yau attempt to dismiss the application of
affirmative action to Chicanos and Asian
Americans. Their refutation centers on the

example of the Irish, who once were racial
i/.ed and discriminated against but are no
longer "disadvantaged by their past." This
simplistic and false analogy does not take
into account the complex and fluid dy
namics of group identities; the assimilation
of the Irish into the dominant white identi
ty is not comparable to the experience of
still-marginalized Chicanos, African Amer
icans and Asian Americans. Irish inclusion
in the dominant power structure, which it
self is the result of social, political and oth
erwise constructed forces, necessarily en
tails an advantaged access to opportunities
and resources over racialized minorities.
Affirmative action works to address these
contemporary inequalities by recognizing
the oppression of the past as well as the di
visive racial hierarchy of the present.
In addition, to say that affirmative ac
tion "hurts Asian American applicants
even though they played no role in op
pressing [other people of color]," assumes
that Asian Americans are somehow out
side the dominant social structures. Con
servatives have often held up Asian Amer
icans as a "model minority" to claim both
that racism no longer exists and that their
"success" was not aided in any way by sys
tematic advantage. Without minimizing

the struggles of Asian Americans, we must
still consider the structural assistance they
have received which other groups have
not, such as small capital loan approvals,
lower levels of residential segregation and
resources prior to immigration.
Importantly, these advantages are not
shared by all Asian ethnic groups. The
higher economic status of many East Asian
Americans masks the negative impact
racism continues to have for all Asian
Americans. When we consider the experi
ences of Filipino and Southeast Asian
Americans who often lack the same social
mobility, it becomes evident that Asian
Americans are no exception to the
marginalization of people of color.
Related to this assumption of color
blindness is Rang and Yau's argument
that racial diversity brings nothing to a
university. To say that we are not affected
by our racial experiences invalidates a sig
nificant aspect of our lives, and if we real
ize that people are treated differently in
social situations based upon the color of
their skin, then we can see just how im
portant racial diversity is to a thriving cam
pus environment. People of color (as well
as women and lesbians; gays; and bisexual
and transgender individuals), with their

varied experiences of marginalization and
empowerment, challenge the narrow
boundaries that shape our worlds.
One interesting point raised in the col
umn is the need to address socioeconomic
status in the admissions process. Here we
agree, as there is definitely a need to take
into account the barriers which class or res
idential location can play in the fulfillment
of educational opportunities. There is no
doubt that a child from an affluent suburb
is in a privileged position when compared
to a child from a poor, inner-city neighbor
hood. Having said this, we do not accept
the validity of socioeconomic status replac
ing race as the factor for consideration, for
reasons mentioned above. Instead, the two
co-exist as imbalances in our society that
demand affirmative action.
If we are ever to achieve a just society,
we must look critically and realistically at
the relations of power which benefit cer
tain groups at the expense of others.
Racism, sexism, heteronormativity and
other systems of advantage prevent sub
stantively fair and equal opportunity. Af
firmative action directly addresses these is
sues by acknowledging the marginaliza
tion of minority groups and acting posi
tively to correct these unjust social reali

ties. Access to education is a necessity for
all members of a democratic society and af
firmative action works to guarantee this
right for everyone. While we agree that
the implementation of affirmative action
can be improved, namely by the inclusion
of socioeconomic status as a factor, to re
move the ability to consider race in admis
sions would lead to the strengthening of
racial barriers to education, as seen in the
University of California school system
after the passage of Proposition 209. With
the University of Michigan case currently
up for review, the need for students to be
vocal in their support of affirmative action
has never been greater. We are fortunate
to be at a prestigious institution that is
firmly dedicated to diversity and affirma
tive action, but we cannot allow our rela
tive good fortune and success to blind us
from the struggles of all.
