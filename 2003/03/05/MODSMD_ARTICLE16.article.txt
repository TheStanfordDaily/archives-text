## Wrestling ends with tough loss 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
In what was supposed to be a stepping-stone for
several wrestlers on the way to the NCAA Champi
onships later this month, the Stanford wrestling
team wrapped up competition at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Championships on Monday with six indi
vidual sixth-place finishes and not a single NCAA
qualifier.
The rough weekend on the campus of Boise State
capped off a disappointing 3-12 season that began
with such high expectations.
While it graduated two senior starters last year,
Stanford returned three NCAA qualifiers in junior
Nathan Peterson and sophomores Brad Metzler
and Matt Centry, as well as a core group of experi
enced wrestlers ready to join the qualifying ranks.
"Overall, it was absolutely disappointing," coach
Steve Buddie said. "At the same time, we had some
guys get the chance to see what it's like to wrestle at
the tournament for the first time, and I think they
now know and have what it takes to win at this level."
Struggles on Sunday, after which not a single
Stanford wrestler entered the second and final day
of tournament without a loss, proved to be part of
the Cardinal's downfall.
Gentry, the top seed at 157, was upset by Boise
State's Ben Cherrington in his first bout on Sunday
before bouncing back later that day with a 13-1
major decision over Cal Poly's Nick Hopping.
But any momentum that Gentry seemingly got
back was erased in a 6-2 loss to third-seeded Rocky
Smart of Arizona State on Monday. Oregon's Bran
son Phillips, whom Gentry dealt a 10-4 defeat dur
ing the dual meet season, ended the Cardinal star's
year with an 11-4 decision.
"He just wasn't at his best," Buddie said. "I think
he put a lot of pressure on himself."
Wrestling in his fourth and final conference tour
nament, senior Harold Penson also dropped his

first bout of the tournament, before rebounding
witli two wins, including a 5-3 decision over Cal
Poly's Joe Brady to advance to the second day of
competition.
But Penson, like the six other Stanford wrestlers
to advance past Sunday, could not muster a win
when it mattered most, dropping two on Monday to
finish the tournament 2-3.
"On the last day, things seemed to be sort of con
tagious," Buddie said. "Watching good wrestling
can lead to good wrestling. I think the opposite is
also true."
Peterson garnered a fourth-seed thanks to his
strong second half of the season and won his first
two bouts of the tournament, including a 4-2 deci

sion over UC-Davis' Tommy Schurkamp. The vic
tory avenged a loss to the 125-pounder in the Cardi
nal's second to last dual meet of the season.
Following a 5-0 loss to eventual champion Ben
Vomßaur of Boise State, Peterson looked to work
his way out of the consolation bracket against Cal
Poly's Vic Moreno, the second seed. Moreno
emerged victorious with a 3-2 decision and Peter
son's season, which included 18 wins, ended with a
loss in his next bout.
"I think Nathan wrestled extremely well," Bud
die said.
