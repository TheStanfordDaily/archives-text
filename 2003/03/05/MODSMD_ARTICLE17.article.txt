# Golf sheds Hawaiian mishaps at tourney
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team
showed a great deal of resilience
this week, finishing fourth overall
at the Cleveland Golf Classic in
Westlake, Calif.
The tournament was packed
with storylines. The first was the
Cardinal's need to show some
signs of life with the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament ap
proaching all too quickly.
After a fall season that saw the
team collect just one top-five fin
ish, the Cardinal didn't have a lot
to build on heading into its spring
schedule. A 21st-place showing at
the Taylor Made/Waikoloa Inter
collegiate made fora rough Valen
tine's Day and an even rougher
start to the spring campaign.
Senior Jim Seki described the
performance in Hawaii as "an
utter disappointment," and point
ed to the Classic as a crucial point
in the year.

class of the 17-team field at the par
71, 6,815-yard North Ranch
Country Club. Although they were

just one of four teams ranked in
Golfweek's Top 25, the team has
been perhaps the hottest in college
golf for the first half of the year.
The program has experienced
a rebirth this year, and after going
winless for the past four seasons,
the Bruins have collected a pair of
team titles in the current cam
paign.
Finally, the race for the individ
ual title promised to be a special
one. The Classic gathered some of
the finest talent in the country, in
cluding fifth-ranked Nick Watney
of Fresno State and Stanford's Seki
(No. 10). Also vying for the crown
was Washington University's
Brock Mackenzie, who took top
honors at last year's Cleveland
with a 54-hole score of 208.

of the gate on Monday with a solid

land Golf Classic in Westlake. The Cardinal finished fourth and began the
spring season with a respectable performance.
day of play.
As usual, Seki and fellow senior
Ron Won led the Cardinal with
their consistent individual play.
Seki positioned himself to capture
his first individual title of the year,
carding rounds of 68 and 71 and
pulling into a three-way tie for sec
ond place after 36 holes.
After struggling to a 98th-place
finish in Hawaii, Won found
southern California more to his
liking, turning in a season-low 67
in his second round. His first-day
total of 143 placed him in 14th

place overall, just two strokes out
of the top 10.
Senior George Downing, com
ing off his best round of the year in
Hawaii, opened the Cleveland
with rounds of 73 and 74, to tie for
37th place overall. Just three shots
back of Downing was sophomore
Kevin Blue, who fired 77-73 on the
first day.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
scoring was junior Blake Mastalir.
Playing in his first event since the
winter offseason, Mastalir showed
some rust in shooting a two-round
total of 151. Sophomore Pat
Phillips competed as an individual,
shooting a career-best 69 in the
opening round, followed by a 77 in
the second to settle into 28th place.

Unfortunately, the team was
unable to make a move on the top
spot during the final round. A five
over-par 289 on Tuesday secured
the Stanford's second top-five fin
ish of the year.
For the second event in a row,
Seki tuned in a disappointing
final round, this time a 7(> that
dropped him from second place
to a tie for 17th. Won led the Car
dinal for the tournament, carding
a final-round 71 and tied for 15th
place overall.
Downing's strong final-round
play continued, with an even-par
71. Blue also shot par for the (lay,
finishing in a tie for 48th place.
Mastalir's 79 on Tuesday left him
in 84th place for the event.

Phillips, after his strong start,
faded down the stretch, tying for
54th place.
UCLA stayed red hot, captur
ing the team title in dominating
fashion. Not only was the Bruins'
seven-stroke margin of victory im
pressive, but it was also a true team
effort. UCLA's Steve Conway took
top individual honors, while team
mates John Merrick and Roy
Moon tied for third place.
Host-team Southern California,
on the other hand, stumbled to a
15th-place finish.
The Cardinal will resume play
in a couple of weeks, when it heads
north to Eugene, Ore. for the Ore

The Stanford men's golf team
showed a great deal of resilience
this week, finishing fourth overall
at the Cleveland Golf Classic in
Westlake, Calif.
The tournament was packed
with storylines. The first was the
Cardinal's need to show some
signs of life with the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament ap
proaching all too quickly.
After a fall season that saw the
team collect just one top-five fin
ish, the Cardinal didn't have a lot
to build on heading into its spring
schedule. A 21st-place showing at
the Taylor Made/Waikoloa Inter
collegiate made fora rough Valen
tine's Day and an even rougher
start to the spring campaign.
Senior Jim Seki described the
performance in Hawaii as "an
utter disappointment," and point
ed to the Classic as a crucial point
in the year.
Another story to watch was No.
10 UCLA. The Bruins were the
class of the 17-team field at the par
71, 6,815-yard North Ranch
Country Club. Although they were

just one of four teams ranked in
Golfweek's Top 25, the team has
been perhaps the hottest in college
golf for the first half of the year.
The program has experienced
a rebirth this year, and after going
winless for the past four seasons,
the Bruins have collected a pair of
team titles in the current cam
paign.
Finally, the race for the individ
ual title promised to be a special
one. The Classic gathered some of
the finest talent in the country, in
cluding fifth-ranked Nick Watney
of Fresno State and Stanford's Seki
(No. 10). Also vying for the crown
was Washington University's
Brock Mackenzie, who took top
honors at last year's Cleveland
with a 54-hole score of 208.
Fhe Stanford men rose to the
challenge in the early going. After
being plagued by slow starts most
of the year, the Cardinal came out
of the gate on Monday with a solid
opening-round 291. The team
then turned around and shot a 1-
ovcr-par 285, a score that allowed
Stanford to gain sole possession of
fourth place at the end of the first

Senior Jim Seki helped the men's golf team swing into success at the Cleve
land Golf Classic in Westlake. The Cardinal finished fourth and began the
spring season with a respectable performance.
day of play.
As usual, Seki and fellow senior
Ron Won led the Cardinal with
their consistent individual play.
Seki positioned himself to capture
his first individual title of the year,
carding rounds of 68 and 71 and
pulling into a three-way tie for sec
ond place after 36 holes.
After struggling to a 98th-place
finish in Hawaii, Won found
southern California more to his
liking, turning in a season-low 67
in his second round. His first-day
total of 143 placed him in 14th

place overall, just two strokes out
of the top 10.
Senior George Downing, com
ing off his best round of the year in
Hawaii, opened the Cleveland
with rounds of 73 and 74, to tie for
37th place overall. Just three shots
back of Downing was sophomore
Kevin Blue, who fired 77-73 on the
first day.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
scoring was junior Blake Mastalir.
Playing in his first event since the
winter offseason, Mastalir showed
some rust in shooting a two-round
total of 151. Sophomore Pat
Phillips competed as an individual,
shooting a career-best 69 in the
opening round, followed by a 77 in
the second to settle into 28th place.

Unfortunately, the team was
unable to make a move on the top
spot during the final round. A five
over-par 289 on Tuesday secured
the Stanford's second top-five fin
ish of the year.
For the second event in a row,
Seki tuned in a disappointing
final round, this time a 7(> that
dropped him from second place
to a tie for 17th. Won led the Car
dinal for the tournament, carding
a final-round 71 and tied for 15th
place overall.
Downing's strong final-round
play continued, with an even-par
71. Blue also shot par for the (lay,
finishing in a tie for 48th place.
Mastalir's 79 on Tuesday left him
in 84th place for the event.

Phillips, after his strong start,
faded down the stretch, tying for
54th place.
UCLA stayed red hot, captur
ing the team title in dominating
fashion. Not only was the Bruins'
seven-stroke margin of victory im
pressive, but it was also a true team
effort. UCLA's Steve Conway took
top individual honors, while team
mates John Merrick and Roy
Moon tied for third place.
Host-team Southern California,
on the other hand, stumbled to a
15th-place finish.
The Cardinal will resume play
in a couple of weeks, when it heads
