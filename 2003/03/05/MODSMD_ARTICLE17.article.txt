# Golf sheds Hawaiian mishaps at tourney

### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team
showed a great deal of resilience
this week, finishing fourth overall
at the Cleveland Golf Classic in
Westlake, Calif.
The tournament was packed
with storylines. The first was the
Cardinal's need to show some
signs of life with the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament ap
proaching all too quickly.
After a fall season that saw the
team collect just one top-five fin
ish, the Cardinal didn't have a lot
to build on heading into its spring
schedule. A 21st-place showing at
the Taylor Made/Waikoloa Inter
collegiate made fora rough Valen
tine's Day and an even rougher
start to the spring campaign.
Senior Jim Seki described the
performance in Hawaii as "an
utter disappointment," and point
ed to the Classic as a crucial point
in the year.
Another story to watch was No.
10 UCLA. The Bruins were the
class of the 17-team field at the par
71, 6,815-yard North Ranch
Country Club. Although they were

just one of four teams ranked in
Golfweek's Top 25, the team has
been perhaps the hottest in college
golf for the first half of the year.
The program has experienced
a rebirth this year, and after going
winless for the past four seasons,
the Bruins have collected a pair of
team titles in the current cam
paign.
Finally, the race for the individ
ual title promised to be a special
one. The Classic gathered some of
the finest talent in the country, in
cluding fifth-ranked Nick Watney
of Fresno State and Stanford's Seki
(No. 10). Also vying for the crown
was Washington University's
Brock Mackenzie, who took top
honors at last year's Cleveland
with a 54-hole score of 208.
Fhe Stanford men rose to the
challenge in the early going. After
being plagued by slow starts most
of the year, the Cardinal came out
of the gate on Monday with a solid
opening-round 291. The team
then turned around and shot a 1-
ovcr-par 285, a score that allowed
Stanford to gain sole possession of
fourth place at the end of the first
