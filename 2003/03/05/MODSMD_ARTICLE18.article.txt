### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford (7-2) men's tennis team's NCAA
Championship hopes suffered a major blow Monday
when senior Ail-American Ryan Haviland decided to
leave the team for personal reasons. He will join the
professional tennis tour in a few weeks once winter
quarter ends.
"Ryan Haviland, senior Ail-American, has voluntar
ily departed the tennis team," coach Dick Gould said.

"Obviously we're
going to miss him.
He was an integral
and very impor
tant part of this
team. You don't

lose a player of the caliber and competitiveness of Ryan
without it affecting the team. You just have to deal with
it the best you can."
"I regret having to leave the team," Haviland said.
"It hurts me badly to have this happen, but that's just
the way things are. It's a shame, but it's time for me to
pick myself up and move on."
Haviland will finish up his remaining coursework
toward a bachelor's degree in sociology during the
spring via independent study and then return for finals
and graduation in June.
"Going to Stanford's been a great thing in my life.
I've made some great friends and I'll be leaving with a
Stanford degree," Haviland said.
The tennis team is no stranger to losing its top play
ers fora variety of reasons, especially in recent years.
Last year, K.J. Hippensteel suffered a season-ending
back injury in the middle of the Pac-1() season. Carter
Morris missed the entire dual-match season due to a
severe case of mononucleosis. Two years ago, Alex
Kim became severely dehydrated in Stanford's NCAA
third round match against Pepperdine and had to sit
out the following match, a 4-2 loss
to Tennessee. Still, this is the first
time that a player has left the team
in the middle of the season to pur
sue professional aspirations.
Haviland has struggled at the
No. 1 singles position since the
dual-match season began in Janu
ary, accumulating a 2-2 record.
During the Cardinal's fifth-place
finish at the National Team In
door Championships Feb. 20-22,
Haviland was the only starter to
not win a match.
Even without Haviland, the
Cardinal still has one of the deep
est and most talented squads in the
country. Stanford is one of only
four teams to have five nationally
ranked singles players (No. 4 Bay

lor and No. 3 UCLA also have five,
No. 1 Illinois has six).
"We have a good group of play
ers who are getting better every day
and if we can continue to improve
the way we've been doing, we'll be a
solid force by the end of the year,"
Gould said. "The guys will have to
rise up."
"This will give us the chance to
prove what a great team we really
are," sophomore Sam Warburg
said. "We're up to the challenge
and can still be the best team in the
country."
In the latest rankings released
last week, freshman James Pade
became ranked for the first time in
his career, coming in at No. 81.
Pade and Warburg (No. 43) share
a team-best dual-match singles
record of 7-1. Freshmen KCCork
ery (No. 42) is 6-1 in dual matches,
not losing since the season-opener
against No. 5 Cal.
