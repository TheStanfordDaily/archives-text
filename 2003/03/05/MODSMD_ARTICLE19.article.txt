The Cardinal upset No. 8 Pacif
ic (11-8, 8-5 MPSF) 3-0(30-28, 30-
22,30-23) in an error-filled match.
"We didn't want it to become a
match where both teams made a
lot of errors, where the winning
team just happened to be the lucky
team," coach Don Shaw said. "I ac
tually thought we did a pretty de
cent job defensively of forcing
them into some errors. Not that we
didn't get plenty of help from
them."
The Tigers were consistently
inconsistent, finishing with a .109
hitting percentage for the match,
highlighted by an atrocious .000 in
game two.
While the Cardinal by no
means played a clean match, it did
enough to pull out the win, finish
ing with a .282 hitting percentage.
From the start, Stanford did

just enough to stay ahead of Pacif
ic.
"We did a good job of block
ing," Shaw said. "We blocked our
share of balls. We channeled balls
in the right directions and we
caused some unforced errors.
"Most importantly we served
effectively and kept them out
of their offense."
Only one Pacific player, junior
middle blocker Sean Rodgers, was
able to effectively combat the Stan
ford defense. Rodgers compiled
13 kills with a hitting percentage of
.500.
For the Cardinal, freshman
middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt got
the start for sophomore Craig
Buell, who was bothered with a
wrist injury.
"He has an effective float
serve," Shaw said. "And [Pacific's]
outside hitters like to hit certain
pretty sharp angles and he's pretty
good at getting his inside hand
over on those sharp angles."
Ahlfeldt chipped in three kills
and three digs while serving ex
tremely effectively.
After Stanford went behind 9-5,
in the second game, Ahlfeldt's
serve got them back into striking
distance, and the Cardinal eventu
ally ran away.
Additionally, senior middle
blockers Paul Bocage and Billy
Strickland had outstanding
matches for the Cardinal. Bocage
racked up 12 kills and a .529 hit
ting percentage while Strickland
had 13 kills and a .522 hitting per
centage.
