# Student leaders still plan to hold anti-war events in Main Quad
## Univ. bars strike from Quad 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
An e-mail issued yesterday by the Uni
versity informed student leaders involved in
today's strike that using the Main Quad was
a violation of campus policy and discour
aged students from disrupting the students
and faculty working there.
Student leaders said they still planned to
hold their events in the Quad.
According to the e-mail, "[U]se of the
Quad and, in particular, amplified sound, is
in direct violation of the University's 'Gam
pus Disruption' policy."
The e-mail begins, "Universities should
be places where important contemporary is
sues receive thoughtful consideration and
are openly debated. Since its founding,
Stanford has maintained a fundamental be
lief in the importance of free speech and the
right ofcitizens to peacefully assemble to ex
press political views."
It makes clear that while the University
does not object to the events of the strike, it
just objects to the use of the Quad.
"We have told them [student groups]
that we would underwrite the whole thing if
they would move their rally to another loca

tion," said Morris Graves, associate dean of
students.
"White Plaza is one of the free speech
areas that the University recognizes,"
Graves said. "The Quad is not — the Quad
is reserved for special events that the Uni
versity has designated."
Graves stated that the response, if stu
dent groups use amplified sound in the
Quad, will not involve police.
"Those of us from the Dean of Students'
Office will be at the event all day tomorrow,"
he said. "If students, for example, decide to
use megaphones or amplified sound, we've
been instructed to go up and tell them that
they are in violation of the policy."
If students persist, their student IDs will
be requested for disciplinary action.
"It's really about not wanting to disturb
the other activities in the Quad," said Assis
tant Dean of Students Nanci Howe. "Not all
classes are canceled, and for all we know
there could be tests going on in the Quad."
Student leaders have said that they will
still use the Quad, although the decision on
whether to use amplified sound has not
been made.

"We believe it's important to
have the strike there [in the Quad]
because it's the heart of campus,"
said senior Clara Webb. "Histori
cally, demonstrations have been
held there against the Vietnam
War and the Gulf War."

Other students who preferred
to remain unnamed said that they
are very sensitive to the spirit of the
Campus Disruption policy.
Senior Angad Bhalla explained
the role of the Quad in the strike.
"We're holding the strike
against war, not to confront the
administration on rules, but also
part of the strike is to reclaim
their [educational] space," he
said. "We're more concerned of

being respectful to the people
going to mass."
Some students, generally not
(he leaders of the groups, had not
heard about the e-mail and were
unaware of the issue.
Besides disrupting people
working in the Quad, the Universi
ty said in the e-mail that use of the
Quad requires a waiver that must
be obtained at least six to eight
weeks in advance.
