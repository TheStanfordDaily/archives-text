# Stand and deliver: protesting in sports
## 
### 
Toni Smith is a senior guard on the
women's basketball team at tiny Man
hattansville College in Purchase,
New York. She has averaged 3.3
points per game for her career. So why exactly
has she graced the pages of every major publi
cation across the country? Because for the past
two weeks, she has turned her back to the
American Hag during each pregame-singing of
the national anthem in protest of "the inequali
ties that are embedded into the American sys
tem" and"the war America will soon be enter
ing" (according to a statement she released last
week).
Needless to say, the whole thing has caused
a maelstrom of controversy.

Fans have booed her at
every game, famed Connecti
cut coach Cene Auriemma
said he wouldn't have her on
his team and a Vietnam veter
an even ran onto the court and
shoved an American flag in her
face during a game last week
against Stevens Tech.
Seemingly every sports

columnist has commented on the issue, so I
think it's about time that I put my two cents in,
too. And given that today is the National Stu
dent Strike Against the War, I would say it is
somewhat of a pertinent topic.
To start, I applaud Smith for taking a stand

for what she believes in. It is crystal clear that
she is a stout opponent of the impending war in
Iraq and the Bush administration's policies in
general. From the relatively little information I
know about her, I can infer that she is not act
ing in such a way as to garner personal atten
tion â€” a la so many athletes we know. Rather,
she is using her status as a college athlete as a
platform to shed light on something that she
clearly feels very passionately about.
Do Bush, Rumsfeld or Condi give a flying
f@#k what she thinks? Definitely not. But
that's not the point. Smith's actions have defi
nitely gotten people talking, and eventually
