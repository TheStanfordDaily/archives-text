# Stand and deliver: protesting in sports
## 
### 
Toni Smith is a senior guard on the
women's basketball team at tiny Man
hattansville College in Purchase,
New York. She has averaged 3.3
points per game for her career. So why exactly
has she graced the pages of every major publi
cation across the country? Because for the past
two weeks, she has turned her back to the
American Hag during each pregame-singing of
the national anthem in protest of "the inequali
ties that are embedded into the American sys
tem" and"the war America will soon be enter
ing" (according to a statement she released last
week).
Needless to say, the whole thing has caused
a maelstrom of controversy.

Fans have booed her at
every game, famed Connecti
cut coach Cene Auriemma
said he wouldn't have her on
his team and a Vietnam veter
an even ran onto the court and
shoved an American flag in her
face during a game last week
against Stevens Tech.
Seemingly every sports

columnist has commented on the issue, so I
think it's about time that I put my two cents in,
too. And given that today is the National Stu
dent Strike Against the War, I would say it is
somewhat of a pertinent topic.
To start, I applaud Smith for taking a stand

for what she believes in. It is crystal clear that
she is a stout opponent of the impending war in
Iraq and the Bush administration's policies in
general. From the relatively little information I
know about her, I can infer that she is not act
ing in such a way as to garner personal atten
tion — a la so many athletes we know. Rather,
she is using her status as a college athlete as a
platform to shed light on something that she
clearly feels very passionately about.
Do Bush, Rumsfeld or Condi give a flying
f@#k what she thinks? Definitely not. But
that's not the point. Smith's actions have defi
nitely gotten people talking, and eventually

some of that chatter is going stop
centering around which way
Smith's back is pointing and in
stead discuss the actual substance
of her arguments — and I hope
that has been her ultimate goal.
Living in the ultra-liberal bubble
that is The Farm nine months out of
the year, some of us may forget that
Smith's silent protests are bound to
ruffle a fair share of feathers across
our fine nation. Those calling for
Smith to be suspended — and there
are many such folk — don't have to
look far for precedents.
I'm sure NBA fans remember
the similar controversy surround
ing Nuggets guard Mahmoud
Abdul-Rauf, who refused to stand
for the Star Spangled Banner dur
ing the 1995-96 season, citing his
Islamic faith. After widespread up
roar, the league ended up suspend
ing Abdul-Rauf indefinitely — the
suspension ultimately lasted only
two games — until the two parties
agreed to a situation in which
Abdul-Rauf simply closed his eyes,
covered his face and engaged in a
personal silent prayer.
Was the NBA right to suspend
Abdul-Rauf and would the NCAA
be right to take similar action
against Smith? Obviously not.
Being at Stanford, I assume
that I don't need to give anyone a
lesson about the First Amendment
and what it has meant to the 227-
year history of the United States.
Without such civic and political
rights as the right to free speech,
that flag that Smith has so elo
quently turned her back on
wouldn't mean crap other than a
couple of stripes and a lot of stars.
All of those young men and
women in our armed forces sta
tioned throughout the world —
many of them exactly Smith's age
— are on the verge of sacrificing
their lives for the United States,
which the national anthem and
the flag so dearly symbolize.
Whether or not you support the
war is irrelevant to recognizing
that truly amazing fact. But what
would the point be of that if those
lucky soldiers returned to a coun
try where its citizens couldn't
speak freely and peacefully state
opposition to the government's
policies.
Do I agree with Toni Smith?
No. Not only do I not support her
politics but I don't think I would
ever turn my back (literally or fig
uratively) on the flag that so many
of my countrymen have died
valiantly to protect — even if my

country was engaging in a war that
I did not believe in.
But do I respect her for taking a
stand? Absolutely.
As a 21-year-old student-ath
lete, she has stepped forward and
opened herself up to the kinds of
criticism that I could only imagine.
In our entertainment-crazy so
ciety, in which millions of fans pack
sports venues every weekend and
even more sit in front of the televi
sion to catch a glimpse of their "he
roes" on the playing fields, too few
athletes use the unbelievable plat
form they have been provided to
do any good whatsoever.
For example, in the fall of 1992,
the North Carolina Senate race
was neck-and-neck between an
African-American challenger and
Jessie Helms, one of the biggest
bigots ever to step foot on Capitol
Hill. Meanwhile, North Carolina
native Michael Jordan was proba
bly the most popular man on the
planet and a good enough sales
man to sell an Eminem box set to
Lynne Cheney.
But what did M J say when De
mocrats and black leaders begged
him to publicly endorse Helms'
opponent? "Republicans buy
sneakers too." Not exactly the
courage and strength of character
that Smith has shown.
This is not to say that all major
athletes have not been this selfish
and ignorant of their political
power. Arthur Ashe was a human
itarian of epic proportions,
Muhammad Ali's refusal to enter
the draft resulted in the loss of his
heavyweight title and who can for
get the Black Power salute at the
1968 Olympics?
Only time will tell how history
will look at Toni Smith and her
silent protest — fora point of ref
erence, Ali was completely bashed
at the time, while the Olympians
John Carlos and Tommie Smith
were basically blacklisted from the
U.S. track community, and now all
three are revered for their stances.
But there is one thing I am sure
of.
Regardless of the substance of
her comments, Smith should be
lauded for taking a stand in the
manner in which she has. And,
more importantly, I think she
should be a model for all of those
rich and powerful athletes out
there, cowering under the amaz
ing platform that their ridiculous
fame and fortune has given them.
