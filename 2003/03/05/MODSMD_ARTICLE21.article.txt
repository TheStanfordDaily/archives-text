No 3 Stanford 5, No. 11 William & Mary 2

Instead, Stanford (8-1, 1-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) pounded the Tribe into submission during
a 5-2 rout.
The Cardinal began the clay in unusual
fashion, as the top doubles team in the nation,
comprised of junior Lauren Barnikow and
sophomore Erin Burdette, fell to the Tribe
members Kate Boomershine and Candice
Fuchs at the No. 1 spot.
"Our shots were barely missing, they were get
ting their rackets on a lot of balls, and we weren't
able to keep it together," Barnikow said. "We
were broken, went clown 6-4 and couldn't re
bound the next game."
Even with the loss at the top, however, Stan
ford was able to claim the doubles point with
strong play at both No. 2 and N0.3 doubles. The
freshman tandem of Alice Barnes and Amber
Liu defeated Megan Muth and Lena
Sherbakov, 8-4, while junior Emilia Anderson
and sophomore Story Tweedie-Yates beat K.ari
Olsen and Lingda Yang in an 8-6 nail-biter.
After battling to a 7-4 lead, the Cardinal team
lost two consecutive games before breaking the
Tribe's serve and securing the match.
After snatching the doubles point, the Car
dinal unleashed its singles depth. Barnikow re
bounded nicely from her doubles loss to lead
the Stanford charge, posting a 6-3, 6-1 in over

Nina Kamp.
"1 thought I played pretty solid," Barnikow
said. "She was a baseliner and I was able to attack
her serve and hit some heavy balls and come in
behind them."
William & Mary picked up its first point of the
day at No. 3 singles. Burdette looked to be fol
lowing her partner's example after breaking
Muth's serve to begin the match, but the sopho
more was eventually edged, 7-6,6-4.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal proved itself the
stronger team at the No. 4 and 5 singles positions.
The middle of the Stanford lineup, anchored by
Barnes and Anderson, has been nearly flawless
the entire season, and its play on Tuesday was no
different.
Barnes quickly beat Boomershine, 6-2, 6-1,
while Anderson rebounded from a rough first set
to defeat Sherbakov, 3-6,6-1,6-1.
At the top singles spot, Liu, who has been un
beatable of late, fought to a three-set win over a

powerful Fuchs, 6-2,4-6,6-4.
The Tribe garnered their second point at the
final singles spot. After looking strong in winning
the first set 6-2, Tweedie-Yates succumbed to
Amy Wei, 5-7, 3-6, in the final two sets after the
overall match had already been dec ided.
The Cardinal looked strong all-around, espe
cially considering the high level of Tuesday's
competition.
"It's a pretty good performance today, con
sidering they didn't necessarily play people in
the spots we anticipated, and it's a Tuesday for
us with a big Pac-10 weekend coming up,"
Stanford coach Lele Forood said. "We had a lot
of work to do this week academically, so for an
early week match I think we're looking pretty
good."
Said Barnikow: "We're going to play Arizona
State on Friday, they're No. 7 [in the nation], and
Arizona is also a tough team [No. 26], so I think it
was good to get in a tough match."
