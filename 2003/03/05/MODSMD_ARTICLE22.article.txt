Evolution of Bird Songs

Ever wonder how birds are able to
compose beautiful songs? Duke
University's Erich Jarvis believes
the answer lies in glutamate recep
tors. By analyzing the brains of dif
ferent birds and comparing them to
humans, Jarvis found that gluta
mate is present in high quantities in
song-producing regions. This dis
covery and others were discussed at

the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement in Science held early February in
Denver. At least Jarvis believes that the complex
songs are a means to attract the opposite sex. That
is just a hypothesis though, since birds use songs for
a wide variety of communications purposes.
Beam me up, Scotty
Did you know that scientists have been able to tele
port particles? In 1997 physicists teleported pho
tons, which were destroyed to make sure that the
phenomenon had actually occurred. Recently in
vestigators from the University of Vienna published

in the journal
Nature that they
have been able to
teleport photons
without destroy
ing them. In tele
portation, the
system has to re
port the entire
quantum state of
the particle and
reproduce it ex-

actly at another location. This is the first step toward
the teleportation of matter at a larger scale. Photons
have hardly a few quantum variables. A human, on
the other hand, is composed of 100 to 200 trillion
cells, and each cell has trillions and trillions of com
ponents with different quantum states.
Beautiful (and Useful) Stones
There is something to be said by a sparkling ruby or
a finely cut diamond. Beauty, color, iridescence,
whatever you call it — stones have attracted hu
mans since ancient ages. But their use in instru
ments makes them more prized now than ever be
fore. For instance, corundum, the mineral name for
rubies and sapphires, is the heart of lasers and is
used to force light into a uniform beam. Crystals are
used in a variety of devices to produce electricity,
called piezoelectricity (literally "electricity from
stone"). Quartz crystals, commonly found in kinetic
watches, are another example.
Relief for Stutterers
A little gadget may help individuals who suffer from
stuttering, a problem which affects approximately 3
million people in the United States. The
Speech Easy, invented by researchers at East Caroli
na University, is a small earpiece that alters the
pitch of the speaker's voice and transmits it back to
the ear. Studies have found that stutterers tend to
speak better when someone else is talking. The de
vice thus encourages the brain to promote more flu
ent speech. Trial tests were 85 percent effective and
did not show any side effects. Like glasses,
Speech Easy is effective when worn — once re
moved the benefits are gone.
Global Warming and Mutation
One more proof that global warming exists is that it
causes genetic change. In a study of red squirrels in
the Yukon, researches found that the animals are
breeding earlier in the season. This change is non-lo
calized and occurs throughout the population. The
Canadian scientists believe that this is a strong indi
cation of genetic change due to increased tempera
tures. The team is now studying whether the change
is the result ofthe squirrels being highly adaptable or
if is occurring within other species as well.
Mars has Little Carbon Dioxide
A reinterpretation of Mars data suggests that most
of the water there is frozen and contains very little
carbon dioxide. Caltech professor Andy Ingersoll

and his graduate student,
Shane Byrne, published
this new model after A,

analyzing images
taken by the Mars
Global Surveyor
three years ago. The
traditional belief
suggests that the
northern and south
ern ice caps are com

prised of ice and car
bon dioxide (dry ice), re

spectively. Ingersoll and Byrne believe that "[the]
revised model c hanges future visions for the red
planet." Although the prospects of finding life —
perhaps bacteria frozen in ice — remains, the possi
bility of terraforming the red planet is now much
more viable. Terraforming would entail releasing
the trapped carbon dioxide, which would augment
the greenhouse effect and raise the planet's average
temperature.
