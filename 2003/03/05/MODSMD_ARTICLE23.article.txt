## M Connects Students Across Campus

Do the words "jk, 101, brb, and ttyl" ring a bell?
If they do, chances are you're probably familiar
with Instant Messaging, a phenomenon that's
gripped more than 100 million users worldwide.
"I'd say between 90 and 100 percent of all students
use it," said Victor Wong, the residential computer
coordinator at West Florence Moore Hall. "Some de
pend on it heavily to keep in touch with friends across
other campuses"
According to the Pew Internet and American Life
Project, 42 percent of college students say they use
the Internet primarily to communicate socially, and
nearly 72 percent do most of their online communi
cation with friends.
" Everyone here is so wired," Wong said. "They are
online all the time and most of their work is done on
the computer anyway."
Not only does widespread computer access facili
tate IM usage at Stanford, but many students, feeling
guilty about their Bookstore splurge on expensive
text books, art supplies and Stanford paraphernalia,
find it's a great way to save a buck or two.
"It's an easy way to talk to your friends for free,"
said freshman Katherine Chang. "I don't have free
nationwide calls, so [with Instant Messaging] I can
talk to people across the country with no cost at all."
According to Wong, freshmen are the most active
IM users. "I think it's a growing phenomenon,"
Wong said. "In my generation, Internet connections
were more expensive and consisted of AOL dial-ups
and modems. People weren't used to having Internet
connections on all the time."
But many freshmen now arrive at Stanford with
buddy lists of friends across the nation, causing many,
like freshman Jason Sinocruz, a self-proclaimed "In
ternet addict," to depend on IM all the time.
"Two weeks ago, the Internet wasn't working for
six hours and I was freaking out" he said.
The first thing Sinocruz does after waking up is
sign on to his IM service. He has three screen names
to hold the 500 buddies on his account and once
signed on for 21 days straight. He even I Ms his next
door neighbor when she's online. "It's convenient
and fun," he said. "You can talk to a lot of people at
once."
Sandra Senti, Executive Director of Technology
Strategy and Support for Stanford's Information

Technology Systems and Services has seen a marked
distinction between IM usage by students and facul
ty. "The students at Stanford today grew up with this
technology and are much more at ease with that con
stant interruption of communication," Senti said.
"The faculty, who has been here fora while, has not
been used to that."
Instant Messaging was introduced to the world six
years ago by a company called Mirablis, whose ICQ
("I seek You") software allowed users on different
computers to communicate through live text-mes
saging.
The arrival of big Internet providers like AOL and
MSN meant that users could soon communicate with
millions of others anywhere across the globe.
The most popular Instant Messaging service on
the Stanford campus and undisputed king in IM ser
vice overall, AIM (America Online Instant Messag
ing), boasts 44 million users with over 2 billion in
stant-messages flickering daily on computer screens
across America.
But as you walk down empty dorm halls to the
sound of dexterous hands tap-tapping away at key

boards, one has to wonder, what are the social impli
cations of using IM?
True, students are able to keep in touch with
friends and family members who are far away for
pennies on the dollar. But does it detract from our so
cial experiences, giving us a limited window in our in
terpersonal relationships?
Wong thinks so. "I stay away from [communicat
ing with] IM and e-mail," he said. "It's difficult to
get emotions across, even with the emoticons. Peo
ple can take a four-or-five word sentence in differ
ent context."
Emoticons are a widely popular feature on Instant
Messaging services. Internet databases publish on
line lists consisting of hundreds of different ways one
can arrange punctuation marks in the shape of faces
and emotions. Given the detached nature of Instant
Messaging, however, it's difficult to really see what's
behind that colon, parenthesis and dash. It's some
times even difficult to assess whether the other per
son is who they say they are.
"I'd say people have different personalities," Wong
said. "They act differently than when they're talking
on the phone or in person with someone else."
Many Stanford students often sacrifice face-to-face
social interactions fora safety net of letters and punc
tuation to expand their communication with other
people. Some IM users even enjoy the feeling of am
biguity and detachment involved with words, not ap
pearances.
Frederick Turner, assistant professor of commu
nication, who teaches a class in spring quarter enti
tled the "Social Impact of Digital Media," believes
teenagers use Instant Messaging because it gives
them a sense of control.
"Teens are anxious and nervous about how they
look or talk," he said. "With IM, they can reduce the
number of things they are displaying."
He also sees this perceived sense of control as
being the impetus for the different personalities IM
users often portray. "Identifiable role-playing is no
ticeable because teenagers want to amplify parts of
themselves that they want to amplify, like the 'cool di
mension.'"
The Instant Messaging phenomenon shows no
hints of slowing down. According to research done by
the Gartner Group, by the year 2004, an estimated
200 million people will use Instant Messaging.
Chances are that by then, IM will play an even more
important role in campus life.
