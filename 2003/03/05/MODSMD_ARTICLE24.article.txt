# From superconductivity to student connection
## Nobel laureate puts emphasis on teaching 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
How would you feel if the very first
experiment you ever ran won a Nobel
Prize? That's exactly what happened
to Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff. A
study of helium-3 at very low temper
atures in graduate school was Os
herofFs first solo run. Years later, his
role in discovering superfluidity in he
lium-3 would win him the 1996 Nobel
Prize in physics.
Discussing his famous experiment,
()sherofl called it a "serendipitous dis
covery."
"We weren't looking for it,"he said.
"That made it much more exciting."
But OsherofFs success was hardly
coincidental; he began dismantling
toys and playing with electric motors
at the age of six.
"The most important thing is,
when I ripped things apart and com
pletely destroyed my toys, [my par
ents] didn't scold me for doing that,"
he said. "If anything, my father actu
ally seemed to encourage that behav
ior."
From these childhood experiences,
he decided to pursue science.
"I went to Caltech with the idea
that 1 would go into physics," Os
heroff said.
After spending years in research at
Bell Labs, he was persuaded by his
wife to try academia.
"Professor Osheroff was probably
one of the most engaging teachers I've
ever had," said sophomore Chris Es
treich.
Osheroff won Stanford's highest
teaching award, the Walter J. Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching in
1991.
"I never took a course on teach
ing," he said. "When I came to Stan
ford in 1987 I had already been elect
ed to the National Academy of Sci
ence, but the first time I taught a big
lecture course, I was quivering in my
boots."
I lis enthusiasm is recognized by all
of those who have worked with him.

"Doug is a leading educator as well
as a Nobel Prize winner," said John
Bravman, vice provost for undergrad
uate education.
Bravman has interacted with Os
heroff in various capacities, but pri
marily noted Osheroffs role as a
member of the Undergraduate Advis
ing Committee, of which Bravman is
chairman.
Osheroff values his teaching expe
riences.
"I think I convey a very true and
honest impression to the students that
I love the material and find it excit
ing," he said. "I enjoy having the
chance to influence the way a reason
able fraction of all Stanford students
think about physics."
He currently teaches Physics 51,
the first physics class many freshman
take.
"Prof. Osheroff completely de
stroys the stereotype of a typical Nobel
laureate," saicl sophomore Stella
Aslibekian. "He was incredibly enter
taining and when you first come to his
class and you don't know that he's a
Nobel laureate, it would be the last
thing that would come to your mind."
Osheroff laments that he can no
longer be directly involved in experi
mentation, but he is willing to make
that sacrifice for the benefit of his stu
dents.
"My graduate students now do re
ally great research, but they're the
ones that make all of the decisions, not
me," he said. "If I made the decisions,
I would be treating them like techni
cians and they wouldn't be learning to
be physicists."
Students appreciate his charitable
attitude.
"He is very down-to-earth and
makes a very generous effort to get to
know his students," Aslibekian said.
She described an occasion when sev
eral members of her dorm invited Os
heroff to faculty night. Though Os
heroff couldn't attend, he later look
them all to Applewood Pizza.
Others also echo praise for Os
heroffs efforts.

"For being an intense researcher
and Nobel laureate, he was pretty
down to earili when it came to getting
basic ideas and concepts across to stu
dents," Estreich said. "He actually
cared that people were absorbing the
material. He integrated humor pretty
well into his lectures."

Osherofl presents an atypical ex
ample of a Nobel Prize winner.
"He's very easy-going and ap
proachable, despite t lie fact that he's
a world-famous physicist," Bravman
said. "He's very interested in stu
dents' lives and very committed to
education."
