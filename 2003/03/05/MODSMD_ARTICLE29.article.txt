# Google ventures into the blogging business
## 
### TAYLOR ALTMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Google, the Web's leading
search engine, purchased Pyra
Labs, a San Francisco-based com
pany that produced some of the
earliest technology for creating
Weblogs, on Feb. 13.
First, a little background: For
those of you who may not know,
Weblogs, commonly referred to as
"blogs," are a form of online self
publishing. Blogs are generally
short, easily updatable posts to a
Web site that consist of commen
tary, opinions, poetry, photos,
diary entries or links to other blogs
or Web sites. Boing Boing Blog,
Scripting News and MetaFilter are
among some of the Web's most
popular blogs.
According to Francis Pisani,
who teaches a class on journalism
and the Internet in the Communi
cation Department, the blog com
munity creates itself through links.
A readership of 50 people can turn
into 2,000 almost overnight.
Advertising blogs as "instant
messages to the Web,'' Blogger,
Pyra labs' 3-and a-half year-old site
for creating Weblogs, currently has
over 1 million registered users, with
200,000 active blogs.
Blogs allow you to communi
cate with a whole network of peo
ple who are interested in particu
lar issues or current events. Read

ers tan also post comments about
blog entries.
Weblogs are rapidly gaining
power as a forum for political sen
timents and discussion. In his
"Talking Points Memo," Joshua
Marshall, a Washington journalist,
initiated the brouhaha involving
Senator Trent Lott's racially moti
vated comments during Senator
Strom Thurmond's 100 th birth
day party in December last year.
Scores of other blogs joined
Marshall in his condemnation of
Lott's remarks, eventually attract
ing the attention of the national
press corps. This series of affairs
led to Lott's decision to step down
as Republican leader in the Senate.
But is Google's purchase of
Blogger a sign that it is getting too
large and powerful? Not to worry,
assures Pisani, who runs three per
sonal blogs. "Google's purchase of
Blogger provides more access to
information."
Pisani's Comm 217 class is one
of the first at Stanford to have its
own blog, powered by Movable
Type and modified so that Stan
ford users can log in using their
SUNetID and password.
Brad Lauster, of the Stanford
ITSS Blog Project, has received re
quests to set blogs for the Stanford
Language Center, the School of
Engineering, the Philosophy De
partment, student research
groups and individual students. "I

think Google's purchase of Pyra is
a fantastic development," he said.
" These resources should allow
Blogger to add the features it's cur
rently lacking and complete port
ing their software so that it no
longer relies on Microsoft Win
dows," Lauster said.
"This attention from Google has
given blogging an infusion of cred
ibility that it had previously lacked.
Now that the corporate world has
taken notice, I expect nano-pub
lishing — writers and editors creat
ing small, highly targeted online
publications and Weblogs — to
begin trickling into environments
where it previously had not."
Google's strategic move has
placed it at the forefront of the
blog phenomenon that is sweep
ing the Internet. It is currently in
the process of launching
BlogSpot, a blog-hosting service,
to add to its major search capaci
ties, as well as Google News, an
automated digest of news from
4,000 news Web sites.
Pyra is not the first company to
be purchased by Google for the
purpose of amassing Internet con
tent. Two years ago, Google
bought Deja.com, which managed
Internet discussion forums known
as Usenet newsgroups
But many Internet users are
concerned about Google's growing
dominance in Web searching, and
the impact on users' privacy. One

blog on the Comm 217 Web site,
entitled "In Google We Trust,"
noted BBC reports that Google
stores the Internet address of
searchers, the time and date of the
search and what was searched for.
The report also noted that Google
sets a tracking cookie on a comput
er that does not expire until 2038,
allowing Google to build up a de
tailed profile of search terms over
many years. The BBC also report
ed that Google refuses to say why it
wants this information or to admit
whether it makes it available to the
U.S. government.
Google's access to faster news
reporting exerts pressure on the
offline media. "Although blogs
have a serious impact on the exist
ing media," Pisani stated, "no
media has ever killed any other
media."
He claims that this "new ecolo
gy" — the new interrelationship of
different forms of media — com
pels people to adapt. Consequent
ly, tiie role of the journalist is
changing. Journalists still write the
news, but they must also filter it
from a plethora of news blogs, as
blogs often find stories prior to on
line or traditional newspapers.
As with any innovation, there
are some drawbacks to blogs, such
as issues over credibility and infor
mation overload.
Yet blogs are an "agile and ag
gressive tool," according to Pisani,

which accounts for their populari
ty. Dave Winer, a software devel
oper, web writer, and founder and
CEO of User Land Software, re
cently engaged in a $2,000 bet with
Martin Nisenholtz, the chief exec
utive of the New York Times Digi
tal, over the growth of Web logs in
the next five years.
Winer believes that in a Google
search of five keywords or phrases
representing the top five news sto
ries of 2007, Web logs will rank
higher than the New York Times'
Web site.

Each day, a staggering number
of people make cyber-forays into
the world of blogs by creating, up
dating, or simply reading Web
logs. With Google's purchase of
Blogger, the golden age of blog
ging seems to have begun.
But Turner does not believe the
rise in IM users over the next few
years will have a big impact in our
society.
"It may matter more to teens
than other people," he said. "But
it won't replace other forms of 'in
stant-technology,' like the phone."

CEO of User Land Software, re
cently engaged in a $2,000 bet with
Martin Nisenholtz, the chief exec
utive of the New York Times Digi
tal, over the growth of Web logs in
the next five years.
Winer believes that in a Google
search of five keywords or phrases
representing the top five news sto
ries of 2007, Web logs will rank
higher than the New York Times'
Web site.

Each day, a staggering number
of people make cyber-forays into
the world of blogs by creating, up
dating, or simply reading Web
logs. With Google's purchase of
Blogger, the golden age of blog
ging seems to have begun.
But Turner does not believe the
rise in IM users over the next few
years will have a big impact in our
society.
"It may matter more to teens
than other people," he said. "But
it won't replace other forms of 'in
stant-technology,' like the phone."


Blogs are short, easily updatable posts to a Web site that consist of com
mentary, opinions, poetry, photos, diary entries or links to other Web
sites. The Stanford Communications 217 blog is just one of many found
on the internet.
Google, the Web's leading
search engine, purchased Pyra
Labs, a San Francisco-based com
pany that produced some of the
earliest technology for creating
Weblogs, on Feb. 13.
First, a little background: For
those of you who may not know,
Weblogs, commonly referred to as
"blogs," are a form of online self
publishing. Blogs are generally
short, easily updatable posts to a
Web site that consist of commen
tary, opinions, poetry, photos,
diary entries or links to other blogs
or Web sites. Boing Boing Blog,
Scripting News and MetaFilter are
among some of the Web's most
popular blogs.
According to Francis Pisani,
who teaches a class on journalism
and the Internet in the Communi
cation Department, the blog com
munity creates itself through links.
A readership of 50 people can turn
into 2,000 almost overnight.
Advertising blogs as "instant
messages to the Web,'' Blogger,
Pyra labs' 3-and a-half year-old site
for creating Weblogs, currently has
over 1 million registered users, with
200,000 active blogs.
Blogs allow you to communi
cate with a whole network of peo
ple who are interested in particu
lar issues or current events. Read

ers tan also post comments about
blog entries.
Weblogs are rapidly gaining
power as a forum for political sen
timents and discussion. In his
"Talking Points Memo," Joshua
Marshall, a Washington journalist,
initiated the brouhaha involving
Senator Trent Lott's racially moti
vated comments during Senator
Strom Thurmond's 100 th birth
day party in December last year.
Scores of other blogs joined
Marshall in his condemnation of
Lott's remarks, eventually attract
ing the attention of the national
press corps. This series of affairs
led to Lott's decision to step down
as Republican leader in the Senate.
But is Google's purchase of
Blogger a sign that it is getting too
large and powerful? Not to worry,
assures Pisani, who runs three per
sonal blogs. "Google's purchase of
Blogger provides more access to
information."
Pisani's Comm 217 class is one
of the first at Stanford to have its
own blog, powered by Movable
Type and modified so that Stan
ford users can log in using their
SUNetID and password.
Brad Lauster, of the Stanford
ITSS Blog Project, has received re
quests to set blogs for the Stanford
Language Center, the School of
Engineering, the Philosophy De
partment, student research
groups and individual students. "I

think Google's purchase of Pyra is
a fantastic development," he said.
" These resources should allow
Blogger to add the features it's cur
rently lacking and complete port
ing their software so that it no
longer relies on Microsoft Win
dows," Lauster said.
"This attention from Google has
given blogging an infusion of cred
ibility that it had previously lacked.
Now that the corporate world has
taken notice, I expect nano-pub
lishing — writers and editors creat
ing small, highly targeted online
publications and Weblogs — to
begin trickling into environments
where it previously had not."
Google's strategic move has
placed it at the forefront of the
blog phenomenon that is sweep
ing the Internet. It is currently in
the process of launching
BlogSpot, a blog-hosting service,
to add to its major search capaci
ties, as well as Google News, an
automated digest of news from
4,000 news Web sites.
Pyra is not the first company to
be purchased by Google for the
purpose of amassing Internet con
tent. Two years ago, Google
bought Deja.com, which managed
Internet discussion forums known
as Usenet newsgroups
But many Internet users are
concerned about Google's growing
dominance in Web searching, and
the impact on users' privacy. One

blog on the Comm 217 Web site,
entitled "In Google We Trust,"
noted BBC reports that Google
stores the Internet address of
searchers, the time and date of the
search and what was searched for.
The report also noted that Google
sets a tracking cookie on a comput
er that does not expire until 2038,
allowing Google to build up a de
tailed profile of search terms over
many years. The BBC also report
ed that Google refuses to say why it
wants this information or to admit
whether it makes it available to the
U.S. government.
Google's access to faster news
reporting exerts pressure on the
offline media. "Although blogs
have a serious impact on the exist
ing media," Pisani stated, "no
media has ever killed any other
media."
He claims that this "new ecolo
gy" — the new interrelationship of
different forms of media — com
pels people to adapt. Consequent
ly, tiie role of the journalist is
changing. Journalists still write the
news, but they must also filter it
from a plethora of news blogs, as
blogs often find stories prior to on
line or traditional newspapers.
As with any innovation, there
are some drawbacks to blogs, such
as issues over credibility and infor
mation overload.
Yet blogs are an "agile and ag
gressive tool," according to Pisani,

which accounts for their populari
ty. Dave Winer, a software devel
oper, web writer, and founder and
