# ASSU senators prepare for special fees ballot
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
Special fees were hotly debated
at last night's ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate meeting. The Senate
passed the proposed budgets for
The Stanford Daily, Volunteers in
Latin America and the World
Refugee Leadership Program as
well as the Appropriations Com
mission's recommendation for
limiting the Black Student Union's
food budget.
Ninety-two percent of over 60
special fees groups were voted on
last night, with all being approved
quickly except for the four groups.
In all, about $1.82 million in spe
cial fees is being requested by stu
dent groups, totaling about $135
per quarter per student.
Before being placed on the bal
lot for student voting, student
group budgets must be approved
by the Appropriations Committee
and the Senate. The committee
examined the budgets last week
end.
"We went through each group,
looked through their budget and
applied policies that have been

long-standing, to try and make it
as lean and reasonable as possi
ble," said Senator Josh Shipp, a
sophomore. "We honestly didn't
make that many cuts because the
budgets were very reasonable this
year."
The Black Student Union's
budget was an issue due to an Ap
propriations Committee policy
that limits food expenditures to
$8 per person. The BSU budgeted
over that amount for its Soul Food
dinner and for its Kwanzaa cele
bration. The BSU argued that
those events should be exceptions.
"There are certain events that
have a certain price level that are
high-attendance events and there
are certain foods that have to be
ordered," said junior Kevin Gaos,
co-chair of the BSU.
Gaos also said that the BSU
under-budgeted other areas to ac
count for the increased funding
requests for Soul Food and Kwan
zaa.
Some senators responded that
exceptions can not be made.

mittee has been really consistent
with this the whole year — you
only get $8 for food," said Sena
tor Sara Ines Calderon, a sopho
more.
The Senate voted seven in
favor, three opposed and four ab
staining to approve the appropria
tions committee's recommenda
tion of limiting funding to $8 per
person.
The Volunteers in Latin Amer
ica, which arranges volunteer
summer trips for eight students,
and the World Refugee Leader
ship Program, which seeks to pro
vide education and enrichment for
refugees through a 10-person trip,
were both subjects of debate. The
program is applying fora $24,806
special fee. The main question for
the Senate was whether these
groups, which allow less than a
dozen students to travel, benefit
enough students to qualify for spe
cial fees.

"These are two groups that ben
efit arguably a limited number of
people on campus," Shipp said.
However, others argued that
these sort of groups normally re
ceive funding.
"From a precedent standpoint,
we fund trips like this for other
groups," said ASSU Vice President
Nick Rodriguez, a junior. "I think
that part of the amazing thing
about special fees is its potential to
be tapped by social entrepreneurs
who would like to take these op
portunities."
The two groups passed by a
vote of nine in favor, none against
and five abstaining.
The last major special fees
group to be discussed was The
Stanford Daily. The Daily submit
ted its application late, but the
larger issue was the role of the
Friends of the Daily, an organiza
tion of Daily alumni that helps
manage The Daily's funds.
Some senators questioned
whether student money was being
tunneled to the Friends of the
Daily.
"The year you received special

fees you still put money in the
Friends of the Daily account," said
Senator Joey Natoli, a sophomore.
Scott Dorfman, the business
manager of The Daily, replied that
while money was deposited, the
Friends of the Daily dispensed
more money in scholarships to
Daily staff members, resulting in a
net loss.
"The Friends operate as a schol
arship fund but also are for ex
treme rainy day circumstances,"
Dorfman said. "The Friends are
not there to be a credit card."
The Daily's budget of $50,200
was approved for the ballot by a
vote of eight in favor, two op
posed and three abstaining. In
only his second time not abstain
ing this quarter, Senate Chair Bo
Cowgill, a senior, voted against
the budget.
In other issues, Associate Dean
of Students Morris Graves an
nounced a University policy
against the use of the Main Quad
by the students striking today.
Also, sophomore Hunter Har
graves was named chair of the
Nominations Commission.

ica, which arranges volunteer
summer trips for eight students,
and the World Refugee Leader
ship Program, which seeks to pro
vide education and enrichment for
refugees through a 10-person trip,
were both subjects of debate. The
program is applying fora $24,806
special fee. The main question for
the Senate was whether these
groups, which allow less than a
dozen students to travel, benefit
enough students to qualify for spe
cial fees.

"These are two groups that ben
efit arguably a limited number of
people on campus," Shipp said.
However, others argued that
these sort of groups normally re
ceive funding.
"From a precedent standpoint,
we fund trips like this for other
groups," said ASSU Vice President
Nick Rodriguez, a junior. "I think
that part of the amazing thing
about special fees is its potential to
be tapped by social entrepreneurs
who would like to take these op
portunities."
The two groups passed by a
vote of nine in favor, none against
and five abstaining.
The last major special fees
group to be discussed was The
Stanford Daily. The Daily submit
ted its application late, but the
larger issue was the role of the
Friends of the Daily, an organiza
tion of Daily alumni that helps
manage The Daily's funds.
Some senators questioned
whether student money was being
tunneled to the Friends of the
Daily.
"The year you received special

fees you still put money in the
Friends of the Daily account," said
Senator Joey Natoli, a sophomore.
Scott Dorfman, the business
manager of The Daily, replied that
while money was deposited, the
Friends of the Daily dispensed
more money in scholarships to
Daily staff members, resulting in a
net loss.
"The Friends operate as a schol
arship fund but also are for ex
treme rainy day circumstances,"
Dorfman said. "The Friends are
not there to be a credit card."
The Daily's budget of $50,200
was approved for the ballot by a
vote of eight in favor, two op
posed and three abstaining. In
only his second time not abstain
ing this quarter, Senate Chair Bo
Cowgill, a senior, voted against
the budget.
In other issues, Associate Dean
of Students Morris Graves an
nounced a University policy
against the use of the Main Quad
by the students striking today.
Also, sophomore Hunter Har
graves was named chair of the
Nominations Commission.
