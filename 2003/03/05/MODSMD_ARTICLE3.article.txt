# ASSU senators prepare for special fees ballot
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
Special fees were hotly debated
at last night's ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate meeting. The Senate
passed the proposed budgets for
The Stanford Daily, Volunteers in
Latin America and the World
Refugee Leadership Program as
well as the Appropriations Com
mission's recommendation for
limiting the Black Student Union's
food budget.
Ninety-two percent of over 60
special fees groups were voted on
last night, with all being approved
quickly except for the four groups.
In all, about $1.82 million in spe
cial fees is being requested by stu
dent groups, totaling about $135
per quarter per student.
Before being placed on the bal
lot for student voting, student
group budgets must be approved
by the Appropriations Committee
and the Senate. The committee
examined the budgets last week
end.
"We went through each group,
looked through their budget and
applied policies that have been

long-standing, to try and make it
as lean and reasonable as possi
ble," said Senator Josh Shipp, a
sophomore. "We honestly didn't
make that many cuts because the
budgets were very reasonable this
year."
The Black Student Union's
budget was an issue due to an Ap
propriations Committee policy
that limits food expenditures to
$8 per person. The BSU budgeted
over that amount for its Soul Food
dinner and for its Kwanzaa cele
bration. The BSU argued that
those events should be exceptions.
"There are certain events that
have a certain price level that are
high-attendance events and there
are certain foods that have to be
ordered," said junior Kevin Gaos,
co-chair of the BSU.
Gaos also said that the BSU
under-budgeted other areas to ac
count for the increased funding
requests for Soul Food and Kwan
zaa.
Some senators responded that
exceptions can not be made.
