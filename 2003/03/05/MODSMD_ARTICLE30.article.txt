# Web bounty hunters help in anti-piracy war
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You are being watched. Right
now, as you distribute files
through your computer, compa
nies out there are looking at you
and making sure you are not a
copyright violator.
These companies are the bounty
hunters of (he Internet, working
for the major media companies.
They use search engines to sift
through the Web, watching for
everything from pirated movies, to
music, books and even the illegal
distribution of calling cards.
The companies have names
such as Mediaforce and Ranger
Online. They function as powerful
tools designed specifically for the
search: it's Google times 10.
"We view Internet as the largest
public forum known to man," said
Bill Attinger, chief operating officer
for Ranger Online. "From that
premise, we set out to design a sys
tem to let companies cull from this
information anything that's related
to them."
" Imagine trying to go to a library
the size of a small state and then
find the pages that are relevant to
the report you're going to write,"
he said.
With billions of files being trad
ed every month, and over 50,000
newsgroups alone, finding copy
righted material on the Internet
can be a major challenge. The ser
vices scan everything from online
auctions to newsgroups, but peer
to-peer programs are particularly
well watched.
Mediaforce, for example, lists
Napster / Open Nap, Aimster,
Swapnut, Gnutella, Audio Galaxy,
Hotline, iMesh, KaZaA, Morpheus
/ MusicGity and Grokster among
the 25 peer-to-peer services that
they monitor. If your file-sharing

software is not among them, don't
breathe a sigh of relief just yet. Even
if Mediaforce is not monitoring
your program, chances are that an
other company has it on their list.
Both Attinger and Gary Millin of
Mediaforce were reluctant to de
scribe their services in detail, citing
concerns that the competition
could learn trade secrets.
"The way we work is we scan the
Internet for people," Millin said,
who is Mediaforce's president. "It
depends on the forum and the in
formation available, but we take a
snapshot of the activity, or whatev
er is publicly available."
The publicly available material
typically includes characteristics
used to identify the user, such as the
username, Internet address, file
path, connection speed and file
size. The file type, name and size is
then used to determine if the user is
violating the copyright.
At Stanford, this means that
each day the Information Technol
ogy Systems and Services receives a
dozen or so complaints from media
companies, advising them to shut
down the service fora user.
While other Internet access
providers may disconnect offend
ing users, Stanford takes a less dra
conian approach, said David Hoff
man, assistant computer security
officer for the department.
"We send a notice out on day one
and ask it to be fixed by clay two," he
said. If the user does not reply that
the material has been removed, the
resident computing center is con
tacted and the service to die user is
discontinued, as required by law. If
I ISS receives a reply, however, they
send a notice back to the media
company that the problem has been
fixed and t lie case is closed. None of
the information about the user goes
back to the company, I loffman said.
He added that ITSS rarely sees re

peat offenders.
"We're trying to be as reasonable
as we can without harming the Uni
versity," Hoffman said.
For the media companies, the
ability to monitor copyright viola
tions is just the first step in the anti
piracy war.
"It's a major focus of what we as
an industry do these days," said
Rich Taylor, vice president of pub
lic affairs for the Motion Picture As
sociation of America (MPAA). Anti
piracy efforts are crucial to the mo
tion picture industry, he said.
"Without a doubt, if you were
not to do anything, piracy would
roll like a tidal wave across the
land," Taylor said. "Because you
cannot compete with free."
Taylor said that 40 percent of
the MPAA resources are spent on
battling piracy around the globe.
Pirated videos which are sold on
the street cost the industry 3 to 4 bil
lion dollars a year, Taylor said. The
loss of revenue from Internet pira
cy is much higher, he said.
"There is no dollar figure, be
cause it is so hard to track," Taylor
said, adding, "There is significant
activity going on out there at signif
icant cost.
To combat the piracy of copy
righted materials, such as movies,

the MPAA decided to use Ranger
Online.
"We need to create conse
quences for their actions," said Tay
lor. "Fora long time piracy was low
risk, high reward, and we're just
trying to turn that around."
But pinpointing who exactly is
policing the Internet is where the
situation becomes tricky. Neither
the media companies, nor the anti
piracy companies want to claim
complete responsibility for the In
ternet tracking efforts.
Taylor insisted that the MPAA is
in favor of technology and lets a
hired company take care of the
copyright violations. Millan and At
tinger were equally insistent that
their companies are tools that
media companies mold to fit their
needs.
"We're a technology provider.
The content owners manage and
protect their works," said Millin.
Attinger was similarly emphat
ic that his company does not take
a stance on the piracy issue and
said Ranger could also be used to
measure reaction to new products
by gauging the responses on the
Internet
"We're not law enforcement and
we're not lawyers," Attinger said.
"We're a tool."
