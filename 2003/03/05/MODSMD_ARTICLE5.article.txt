# Faculty cancel classes for war strike
## 
### MARY DAILEY PATTEE JENNIFER GRAHAM 
At least 26 faculty have canceled classes
and 64 have pledged support for today's
"Books not Bombs" strike protesting a
pre-emptive war in Iraq, its organizers
said last night. Based on comments from
many students, dozens of classes have
been rescheduled or canceled.
In conjunction with a nationwide
strike supported by over 300 colleges and
universities, members of the Coalition for
Students Against War have been lobby
ing faculty to cancel classes or excuse and
support students who are absent. A form
letter for students to send to faculty and

instructors was posted on the Web site of
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice and circulated on e-mail lists. The
group also published a letter in The Daily
requesting faculty support.
University President John Hennessy,
in response to an e-mail requesting an of
ficial University response to today's strike,
both maintained the right of students to
peacefully protest and reiterated the right
of other students to attend classes.
"Students of course have the right to
be voluntarily absent from classes," he
said. "But by the same token, instructors
have the right to hold them responsible
for whatever goes on in class that day.
And no one has the right to disrupt the

teaching of a class or to prevent students
who want to go to class from attending."
Professors who have canceled classes
cited a variety of reasons, ranging from
doing their part to oppose the potential
war to allowing students to educate them
selves on issues surrounding Iraq. And
while other professors are choosing to
hold their classes, citing the need to let
students choose whether to strike, many
have been supportive of students who
plan to be absent.
