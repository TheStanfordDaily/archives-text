# Faculty cancel classes for war strike
## 
### MARY DAILEY PATTEE JENNIFER GRAHAM 
At least 26 faculty have canceled classes
and 64 have pledged support for today's
"Books not Bombs" strike protesting a
pre-emptive war in Iraq, its organizers
said last night. Based on comments from
many students, dozens of classes have
been rescheduled or canceled.
In conjunction with a nationwide
strike supported by over 300 colleges and
universities, members of the Coalition for
Students Against War have been lobby
ing faculty to cancel classes or excuse and
support students who are absent. A form
letter for students to send to faculty and

instructors was posted on the Web site of
the Stanford Community for Peace and
Justice and circulated on e-mail lists. The
group also published a letter in The Daily
requesting faculty support.
University President John Hennessy,
in response to an e-mail requesting an of
ficial University response to today's strike,
both maintained the right of students to
peacefully protest and reiterated the right
of other students to attend classes.
"Students of course have the right to
be voluntarily absent from classes," he
said. "But by the same token, instructors
have the right to hold them responsible
for whatever goes on in class that day.
And no one has the right to disrupt the

teaching of a class or to prevent students
who want to go to class from attending."
Professors who have canceled classes
cited a variety of reasons, ranging from
doing their part to oppose the potential
war to allowing students to educate them
selves on issues surrounding Iraq. And
while other professors are choosing to
hold their classes, citing the need to let
students choose whether to strike, many
have been supportive of students who
plan to be absent.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, His
tory Profs. Ahmad Dallal and Estelle Freed
man and Political Science Prof. Emeritus
David Abernathy, among more than
20 faculty participating in the strike,
will be leading teach-ins today. Like
a number of professors who will
hold class but relate it the potential
war, History Prof. Joel Beinin is
holding an open lecture for his
course "The Modern Middle East"
to discuss the Gulf War.
Biological Sciences Prof. Richard
Sapolsky, who canceled his Biology
43 lecture — a class taken by well
over 100 students — called the stu
dent strike encouraging and said
that, though he had not discussed
the strike with many faculty, he felt
most were supportive of it and plan
ning to take part in some form.
"I said something to the effect

of urging students to take advan
tage of the open class time to see
what views were being presented
on Wednesday," Sapolsky said
about canceling Bio 43 today.
"I'm getting somewhat frantic
about the political / military situa
tion and this seems to be doing my
(small) part to try to drum up op
position."
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Harris has participated in
the anti-war movement and plans
to attend part of the strike.
Though he has no classes that
meet today, he said he would have
canceled any scheduled classes.
"I have encouraged my own
graduate students to support the
strike if it's consistent with their be
liefs rather than do nothing, which
is far more typical of engineering
students," he said.
Drama Department Lecturer

Richard Powers said he feels it is
"important for students to feel em
powered nevertheless to express
their opinions, through their
words or actions."
Powers has not canceled his
classes.
"Two faculty members told me
they are canceling their Wednes
day classes in support of the stu
dent strike," he said. "I respect
their decision but I have reasons
not to do this."
Powers said that, in the 19605,
professors canceled classes for
Vietnam War protests, thus pre
venting students themselves from
taking a stand on the war.
"It was the professors, not the
students, who made those deci
sions, thus preventing their stu
dents from owning those choices,"
he said. "I'd rather see students
choose their own responses."
