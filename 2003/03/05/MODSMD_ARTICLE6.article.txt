### JULIE LEIN 
Four panelists, ranging from a law stu
dent to the vice president of the College
Board, offered disparate views on affirma
tive action last night during "Affirmative
Action â€” What?," hosted by Bursting the
Bubble.
Since the University tiled an amicus cu
riae brief with the Supreme Court in favor
of the University of Michigan's affirmative
action policies, the panelists detailed Stan
ford's stand on affirmative action and de
bated the merits of the controversial policy.
Proponents of affirmative action cited
the need to make more progress in diver
sifying education and its societal benefits,
while those opposed said that such policies
do not even the playing field and under
mine the achievements of racial minorities.
Before a packed Tresidder Oak Room,
moderator Luis Fraga, associate professor
of political science, introduced the topic
through two very different standpoints.
Affirmative action, Fraga said, can either
be seen as a "gaming system of box-check
ing" or an acknowledgment of disparity.
Fraga, who teaches "Race and Ethnici
ty in American Politics Now," introduced
the panel as an attempt to see both sides of
the affirmative action debate.
James Montoya, former vice provost
for student affairs and current vice presi
dent of The College Board, said that affir
mative action was supported by the board
because more progress is needed to diver
sify higher education.
"In looking where we were in the 1970s
and where we are now, I can say that we
have not made enough progress," Mon

toya said.
Though he ac knowledged an improve
ment in racial proportion at the university
level, particularly in the Asian population,
he believes there is still a need for affirma
tive action. According to Montoya, The
College Board, motivated by affirmative ac
tion's enhancement of student and teacher
experience, issued its own amicus curiae in
favor of the University of Michigan.

Panelist Robin Mamlet, dean of admis
sion and financial aid, echoed Montoya's
support of affirmative action.
"Who goes to school isn't merely an in
dividual concern, but a societal concern,"
Mamlet said. "We can't be an excellent in
stitution or nation without diversity."
