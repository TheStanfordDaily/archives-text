# Panel clarifies affirmative action policy
## 
### JULIE LEIN 
Four panelists, ranging from a law stu
dent to the vice president of the College
Board, offered disparate views on affirma
tive action last night during "Affirmative
Action â€” What?," hosted by Bursting the
Bubble.
Since the University tiled an amicus cu
riae brief with the Supreme Court in favor
of the University of Michigan's affirmative
action policies, the panelists detailed Stan
ford's stand on affirmative action and de
bated the merits of the controversial policy.
Proponents of affirmative action cited
the need to make more progress in diver
sifying education and its societal benefits,
while those opposed said that such policies
do not even the playing field and under
mine the achievements of racial minorities.
Before a packed Tresidder Oak Room,
moderator Luis Fraga, associate professor
of political science, introduced the topic
through two very different standpoints.
Affirmative action, Fraga said, can either
be seen as a "gaming system of box-check
ing" or an acknowledgment of disparity.
Fraga, who teaches "Race and Ethnici
ty in American Politics Now," introduced
the panel as an attempt to see both sides of
the affirmative action debate.
James Montoya, former vice provost
for student affairs and current vice presi
dent of The College Board, said that affir
mative action was supported by the board
because more progress is needed to diver
sify higher education.
"In looking where we were in the 1970s
and where we are now, I can say that we
have not made enough progress," Mon

toya said.
Though he ac knowledged an improve
ment in racial proportion at the university
level, particularly in the Asian population,
he believes there is still a need for affirma
tive action. According to Montoya, The
College Board, motivated by affirmative ac
tion's enhancement of student and teacher
experience, issued its own amicus curiae in
favor of the University of Michigan.

Panelist Robin Mamlet, dean of admis
sion and financial aid, echoed Montoya's
support of affirmative action.
"Who goes to school isn't merely an in
dividual concern, but a societal concern,"
Mamlet said. "We can't be an excellent in
stitution or nation without diversity."

Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Robin Mamletand other panelists clarified Stanford's
affirmative action policy with students yesterday at the "Bursting the Bubble" panel.
the University's admissions policy,
which lakes the entire student into
account, does not look at SAT
scores as absolute and does not use
a point system. She stressed that af
firmative action is for similarly com
petitive candidates.
Elliot Fladen, a first-year Stan
ford Law student, declared institu
tions of higher learning as biased
in their staff selection process.
Conservative professors are dis
criminated against, Fladen said,
and he believes it unfair to use af
firmative action in selecting incom
ing students while ignoring it in
hiring staff.
Since Fladen sees admissions as a

zero-sum gain, he said lie finds it
impossible to level the playing field
since one group must be lowered to
raise another. He said his inability
to bridge this gap left him unsatis
fied with the University's affirma
tive action policies.
Hoover Research Fellow Shel
by Steele, the final speaker, pro
vided a scathing criticism of affir
mative action as a "public policy
manifestation of white guilt."
Steele, who wrote "A Dream De
ferred," said he sees whites as
feeling burdened by the assump
tion that they are racist. In at
tempts to alleviate themselves of
this guilt, whites have established
affirmative action programs to
legitimize the institutions in
place. Steele described black in
tellectual underdevelopment as
the real problem, which is not

being solved by affirmative ac
tion's attempts to give moral au
thority to institutions.
Steele pointed out that affirma
tive action was around for 30 years
before anyone actually researched
its actual effects. As a final contro
versial criticism, he proposed that
African Americans are afraid to
challenge affirmative action in fear
of shaming their race when, in ac
tuality, blacks lose legitimacy to po
sitions of power because others at
tribute these achievements to their
race.
As Steele concluded his brief
speech, hands shot up across the
room. Fraga acknowledged a
number of questions from the au
dience, though time constraints
limited the question session to one
hour. Much of the time became a
dialogue between panel members

and the audience, as students of
fered their own personal views on
the prevalence of race discrimina
tion.
The two most diametrically op
posed panelists, Montoya and
Steele, argued back and forth for
about five minutes until Fraga halt
ed the debate with a reminder that
affirmative action should not be
seen as the "be all, end all" policy of
racial equality in America.
The debate touched upon the is
sues surrounding affirmative action
in the University of Michigan trials
pending before the Supreme
Court, which will decide whether
universities can use race as a factor
in making admissions decisions.
With four Stanford alumni sitting
on the Supreme Court, Stanford
remains a central part of this ongo
ing debate.
