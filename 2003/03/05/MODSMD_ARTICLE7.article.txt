### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Krit Schlosser, author of "Fast
Food Nation," spoke about the un
known dangers (if America's fast
food culture and urged students to
be more aware about the food they
eat in alec ture last night he gave in
a packed Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Schlosser described the Ã¼biquity
and power of the fast food industry
and went on to explain how the rise
of the industry led to the decline of
working conditions in meatpack
ing plants and the mistreatment of
workers.
He was ambivalent about possi
bilities tor change in the fast food
industry.
"There is absolutely nothing in
evitable about the food industry,"
Schlosser said, noting that other
countries have improved the way
their food was produced to benefit
customers and employees.
Schlosser also spoke more gen
erally about social movements and
breaking out of the "gorgeous bub
ble" that Stanford students experi
ence.

"What I learned was the enor
mity of my own ignorance," he
said about writing "Fast Food Na
tion," a book that was on The
New York Times bestseller list for
years.
"There are pieces of 1,000 cattle
in one hamburger," he said, illus
trating one of many unknown facts
about typical fast food.
"Our food system has changed
more in the past 30 years than in
the previous 30,000," he added.
Though his expertise was on
fast food and the underground
economy, the topic of his upcom
ing book, he drew the most re
sponse from the crowd when he
discussed today's student strike.
After taking a tour of the
Hoover Institution, he said he real
ized something about the former
President I lerbert I loover.
"If Hoover were alive today,
he'd be out by the watchtower to
morrow morning," Schlosser said,
arguing that the defined mission of
the 1 loover Institution, to promote
peace, would define how the presi
dent stood in regard to student
protests.
"It was an amazing speech,"
said second-year law student
Melvin Priester, who said he had
gone cold-turkey on last food
after reading Schlosser's book.
"He was giving hope. Alter read
ing the book, I thought, 'What
could I do?' He spoke of the idea
that it does make a difference
[what you do]."
Schlosser described his own in
volvement in raising awareness
about the fast food industry, in
cluding attending a protest last
week in Irvine, Calif., at Taco Bell
headquarters. Hundreds of mi
grant workers were there de
manding t hat Taco Bell's suppliers
pay one more cent for every
pound of tomatoes picked, he said.
"If Taco Bell can't afford a
penny for migrant workers, then
they don't deserve a penny of your
business," he said, drawing ap
plause.
"It made me question my choic
es on buying food and where I
eat," said Ekin Kocabas, a first-year
graduate student in electrical engi
neering.
"The message was broader than
[that we shouldn't eat fast food],"
said freshman Tyler Hester. "It
was about the way we live our lives
and the evils of our world."
The speech was sponsored by
the Human Biology program and
the ASSU.
