## U.S. moves for U.N. support 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —U.N. Secre
tary-General Koll Annan appealed to a deeply
divided Security Council yesterday to find
common ground on Iraq, saying he is opti
mistic of an agreement. But some council
members said they weren't so hopeful.
The United States has been pressing fora
vote next week on a resolution to give U.N.
backing fora war, though it doesn't currently
have the nine "yes" votes needed. White
House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday
the vote was "desirable" but "not necessary,"
leaving open the possibility that the United
States would not call for one.
Annan's appeal and the possible change in
U.S. tactics reflect the polarization in the Secu
rity Council that appears to have hardened in
recent days. Many undecided council mem
bers have called fora compromise among the
key powers — but the two camps are so far
apart that diplomats said there have been no
substantive talks.
With top weapons inspectors Hans Blix
and Mohamed Elßaradei to report Friday on
Iraq's cooperation, Annan called on the
council to unite, as it did last November in
unanimously adopting a resolution that gave
Iraq a final opportunity to disarm or face se
rious consequences.
"The members have different positions,
and of course, I hope through the discussions
and the exchange of views they might be able
to find some common ground to move for

ward," Annan said at a private luncheon with
the 15 Security Council ambassadors. Annan
said he was optimistic.
But other council members were less hope
ful of resolving the council split that has left the
United States, Britain and Spain supporting
authorization for war but France, Russia, Ger
many and China backing inspections into July.
"People have to work together to find some
solution," said Chile's U.N. Ambassador
Gabriel Valdes, whose country has been inter
ested in a Canadian compromise proposal for
benchmarks Iraq would have to meet by the
end of the month.
But when asked the prospects of a council
agreement, Valdes said, "I don't know — I re
ally don't know."
Bulgaria's U.N. Ambassador Stefan Tafrov,
whose country is considered to be in the U.S.
camp, was even more pessimistic.
"Everybody talks about compromise but I
can't see one," he said. "I'm afraid that posi
tions have hardened instead of coming clos
er, and it's harder now to achieve the unity of
the council."
"We need some kind of movement to
achieve the unity of the council, which is the
objective of Bulgaria," he said.
Nonetheless, Annan said he believes that
there are "serious discussions" going on.
Earlier, he declared that war must be a last re
sort and called Iraq's destruction of Al
Samoud 2 missiles "a positive development."
