Smart Speech is here
... and your
phone
just got a
little bit
smarter!
What can you do when you're
between classes, need your friend's number and you don't have it?
Call the Stanford operator?
Now you don't have to. You can just dial 0 from your room
phone (or any Stanford wired phone), say your friend's name, and
Smart Speech will give you the number!
What happens if my name is pronounced wrong in the database?
If the system doesn't get your name right, you'll probably want to record your own name
and number. It should only take you a couple of minutes. Just stop by the Card Office in Old Union
or the Student Services office in Forsythe Hall between 8 AM and 5 PM Monday through Friday.
You'll see a' Smart Speech" sign and a special phone. Be sure to bring your Stanford I.D. (It will take
approximately two weeks for phonetic updates to download into the Smart Speech system.)
For more info, call 5-HELP (5-4357), option 2.
