# Hoover report critical of public education
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite major increases in public education
funding over the past 20 years, a report recent
ly published by the Hoover Institution and the
Koret Task Force on K-12 Education con
cludes that public education in the United
States has only slightly improved since an earli
er 1983 study.
The previous report — completed by the
National Commission on Excellence in Educa
tion and called "A Nation at Risk?" — claimed
that "the amount of homework for high school
seniors has decreased and grades have risen as
average student achievement has been declin
ing."
It went on to describe the educational sys
tem as having a "cafeteria-style curriculum in
which appetizers can easily lie mistaken for the
main course."
According to Political Science Prof, and
Hoover Senior Fellow Terry Moe, "A Nation at
Risk?" is "far and away the most important re
port that has ever been done."
Moe took part in creating the 2003 report
entitled "Our Schools and Our Future .. . Are

We Still at Risk?" and stated tha't the goal of the
11-member team was to "assess the progress
that has been made.
"We don't want this to be controversial,"
Moe continued. "It is a pragmatic proposal."
He described the efforts made to improve
education as "staggering and enormous."
However, the team's general consensus, as
articulated by Moe, is that "a lot has happened
with very little impact on the system."
The 2003 report states that test scores have
not improved since 1983 and education in the
United States still lags behind other industrial
ized nations. It explained that "the problem lies
within the permanent features on the educa
tion landscape"
Such "permanent features" include school
administrators, colleges of education, state bu
reaucracies, teachers unions and school
boards.
The perspective of the new study differs
from that of the 1983 report, which called for
higher standards but did not suggest a com
plete reordering of the public education sys
tem.
The 2003 report c alls for increased account
ability, choice and transparency. David Daven

port, who is also a member of the Hoover and
Koret task force, said to the San Francisco
Chronicle that "transparency would allow par
ents and regulators to see results of school,
teacher and student performance more clearly.
"Accountability would set and measure clear
standards," he continued. "And choice under
girds the other reforms by allowing parents to
vote with their feet and send students to anoth
er public or even private school if they wish."
According to Moe, the Hoover and Koret
team does not believe teachers are trained well
and feels that there needs to be more flexibility
in teacher certification.
He also suggested having "aggressive ex
periments" in the use of charter schools or
voucher systems — especially in urban areas,
where he said schools are clearly not working.
Junior Andres Restrepo commented that he
generally agreed with (he report and suggest
ed merit-based pay for teachers.
Sagar Chandaria, also a junior, said that
"there needs to be a specific standard for what
students come out of school with."
Stated senior Bill Bowen, "I'm not surprised
that schools haven't improved. Our culture
doesn't really value education."
