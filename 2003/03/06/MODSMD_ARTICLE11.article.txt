### GOHAR GALYAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, Lambda Phi
Epsilon, an Asian-American in
terest fraternity, hosted its first
ever career fair. Featuring alum
ni-staffed panels on the profes
sions of law, medicine, finance
and consulting, the fair gave stu
dents perspectives on how to ap
proach their careers and the
work-related issues specific to
Asian Americans.
According to Jerry Fang, Class
of 1995 and an alumnus of the
fraternity, the panels gave stu
dents the opportunity to hear
about where the alumni are in
their careers and how they had
gotten there.
"I think all the panels were
highly informative and gave very
relevant, concrete views on their
respective fields," said Fang, a
first-year student in the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Fhe panels were each 50 min
utes long and featured state
ments by alumni followed by
question and answer sessions.
Organizers originally planned

the event to strengthen alumni
relations within the fraternity,
but decided to open the event to
the general student body.
For some students, it was
helpful to hear about the experi
ences that Asian Americans have
had in their careers.
"What I found particularly
helpful was that the alum were
Asian-American," said Manna
Chiou, a sophomore studying
human biology. "Because some of
my concerns and questions deal
with being a minority in careers
such as law, I found their per
spective about their experiences
and the minority dynamic within
the field really interesting,"
Overall, students found the
panel discussions helpful and in
formative.
"I learned that I really need to
relax," said Lan Ngo, a second
year transfer student studying
economics. "I'm only a sopho
more. I still have time to think
things out. I also learned that if I
don't get that 'great' internship
this summer, it doesn't mean that
I won't be able to find a job upon
graduation."
