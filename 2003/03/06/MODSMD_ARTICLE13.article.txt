classes in subjects including molecular biology, public speaking, Shake
speare performance, philosophy and human rights for five consecutive
weekends taught by students.
"[Students] by no means need to be experts," said organizer Melanie
Wong. "They need to be dedicated to their class; enthusiasm is the only
prerequisite. The goal of this program is to enrich the academic and
general growth of a high school student's experience."
As a SHEP teacher, students will choose how to teach the class,
what subject to teach and will devise their own lesson curriculum. To
apply, fill out the application form at www.stanford.edu/group/esp
by tomorrow.
Sigma Chi blood drive
Sigma Chi is holding a blood drive today from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. with
Blood Centers of the Pacific.
" The entire Sigma Chi chapter felt it was necessary to put on some
thing like this; it is a simple, effective, and relatively painless opportu
nity for the Stanford community to help people in need," said Sigma
Chi Public Relations Chair Ben Savage, a junior. "We are thrilled to be
sponsoring this event and encourage interested donors to stop by our
house."
Over 200 people have signed up to donate blood as part of the fra
ternity's first blood drive, but walk-ins are welcome.
"Assuming all goes well, we plan on having this event every year,"
said Savage. "Since Sigma Chi is a pretty central location on campus,
we are anticipating a huge turnout."
Free CPR training
The American Red Cross is offering free CPR training this Saturday
to community members.
"Most cardiac-related deaths occur outside of a hospital," said
Marina Holmes, director of health and safety at the Palo Alto Area
Chapter of the American Red Cross. "An early call to 911 to access
paramedics and immediate CPR can mean the difference between
life and death," she said.
The free CPR sessions will be held at Foothill College at 8:30 a.m.
and 1 p.m. Participants will receive Red Cross certification in adult
CPR.
"CPR Saturday is a free service the American Red Cross provides to
its supporting communities every year," said Trish Bubenik, executive
director at the Palo Alto Area Chapter. "We intend to certify 500 to 600
people, in conjunction with the Peninsula Stroke Association. We are
thrilled to help educate our community about these life saving skills
and appreciate the support of our sponsors."
To register, interested students should c all (650) 688-0437.
