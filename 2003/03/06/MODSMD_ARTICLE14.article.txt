## Haifa blast kills 15, Gaza missile kills 11

GAZA CITY, Gaza City (AP) —
A missile fired from an Israeli heli
copter killed at least 11 Palestini
ans today while they watched fire
lighters put out a fire in thejabalya
refugee camp in Gaza, witnesses
and hospital officials said. More
than 100 people were wounded.
The Israeli military operation
in Gaza came hours after a Pales
tinian suicide bombing on a bus in
the northern city of I laifa killed 15
Israelis and wounded dozens.
A gun battle had erupted inja
balya during an overnight Israeli
operation in the refugee camp,
witnesses said, and continued as
troops pulled out of the area and
withdrew into an alley.
The troops fired tank shells
and heavy machine guns. A heli
copter hovering overhead fired
missiles, hitting a group of people
who were watching the firelight
ers at work.
"Until now, we have 11 killed
and more than 100 wounded,
among them 30 are in very critical
condition, in a new massacre com
mitted against the citizens of Ja
balya," said Dr. Moawia Hassa
nen, chief of emergency services at
Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
Earlier, two other Palestinians
were killed during the army's op
eration in Gaza. The army blew up
two buildings, including one be
longing to a I lamas activist.
The military sweep came as Is
raelis mourned the 15 passengers
killed by the suicide bomber in
yesterday's bus bombing, which

ended a two-month lull in suicide
bombings. The blast injured 55
people.
About 10 of the victims were
high school students — among
them 14-year-old Avigail Leitner,
a U.S. citizen, authorities said.
Two soldiers were also killed.
Police said the suicide bomber,
Mahmoud I lamdan Kawasme, 20,
of the West Bank city of Hebron,
was carrying a letter praising the
Sept. 11 attacks. No group claimed
responsibility for the bus blast.
In a first response to the attack,
Israel's Security Cabinet ordered
the closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip until further notice,
banning all Palestinians from en
tering Israel, the Israeli military
said early today. Later, about 50
Israeli tanks accompanied by heli
copter gunships moved deep into
the Jabaliya camp.
Israel's new hard-line govern
ment had pledged earlier to step
up strikes against militant strong
holds in the Gaza area. Dozens of
Palestinians have been killed in
more than two weeks of raids.
Bus No. 37 was packed with stu
dents from Haifa University when
it stopped to let off passengers.
The explosion blew off the bus
roof, shattered all its windows and
toppled nearby palm trees. Flood
lights cast an eerie glow on the
scene, illuminating the charred
skeleton of the vehicle.
The bomb was laden with metal
shrapnel for greater deadliness, ac
cording to a Police Commissioner.
