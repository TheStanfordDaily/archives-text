# U.S. asks 60 nations to expel Iraqi agents
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two
U.N.-based Iraqi diplomats were
ordered yesterday to leave the
country and the United States
asked 60 countries to expel alleged
Iraqi agents who, U.S. officials
said, may be poised to attack
American interests overseas.
The government has identified
300 Iraqis in the 60 countries
whom officials want expelled, the
U.S. officials saici. Some are oper
ating as diplomats out of Iraqi em
bassies, the officials said, adding
that the foreign governments are
expected to comply with the U.S.
request.
State Department spokesman
Philip Reeker confirmed the ex
pulsion request but offered no in
formation on the number of coun
tries or on how many suspected
Iraqi agents are involved.
Reeker said the action has no
bearing on possible U.S. military
action against Iraq.
The government officials, ask
ing not to be identified, said the
State Department made similar re
quests of foreign governments be
fore the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
The current request comes as a
U.S.-led war against Iraq appears
increasingly likely. U.S. officials
and outside analysts have warned
that an attack 011 Iraq could well
trigger attacks 011 U.S. interests by
Iraq or its allies.
Secretary of State Colin Powell
said yesterday that the real risk lies
in failure to act against Saddam.
In that event, he said, there

would he a world "where Saddam
and the likes of Saddam are em
boldened to acquire and wield
weapons of mass destruction."
The State Department identi
fied them as Nazih Abdul Latif
Rahman and Vehia Naeem
Suaoud.
"The two attaches were en
gaged in activities outside the
scope of their official function," the
department said. "Federal law en
forcement authorities deemed the
activities to be harmful to our na
tional security."
The men speak only Arabic and
have the ranks of attaches but are
not on the list of personnel accred
ited to the United Nations, Al-
Douii said.
"They are the security person
nel of the mission, the guards," the
ambassador told The Associated
Press. "They are living in the base
ment of the (Iraqi) mission."
He said both diplomats had
been approached by U.S. officials
and asked to defect.
"All of our diplomats were pres
surized, were asked if they would
like to leave the Iraqi government
right now, to stay here in the Unit
ed States," the ambassador said.
"And those people, they refused
those kinds of proposals. And this
is a kind of vengeance because
they didn't accept what had been
asked by Americans, by CIA, or
FBI or whatever."
"All Iraqi people in the mission
have been approached in that way,
except me," he said.
