## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Strike creates momentum 
### 
Throughout yesterday, nearly 1,000
Stanford students joined tens of
thousands of college students na
tionwide to participate in the "Books
Not Bombs" strike. The rallies and teach-ins
gave these students the opportunities to be
come informed about the issues surrounding a
possible U.S. war with Iraq, and the organizers
of the event should be applauded.
Despite the fact that the members of the
Coalition for Students Against War only had a
week and a half to plan the strike, it was
thoughtfully organized. In addition to the
teach-ins, the strike featured creative forms of
demonstration, like art work and spoken
word performances. The strike's impressive
turnout should be seen as an promising sign
for the future of civic engagement. (At UC-
Berkeley, a university four times the size of
Stanford, only 400 students participated.)
Both supporters and opponents of a U.S.
war with Iraq should be encouraged that Stan
ford students are starting to think and act out
side of the notorious "Stanford Bubble." Most
impressive was the peaceful manner in which
students participated in the strike; those sup
porting the war were able to voice their con
cerns alongside those opposing it.
While many students missed classes to par
ticipate in the strike, learning did not come to
a halt yesterday. In fact, the strike was an ex
ample that education can — and should —
take place outside of the classroom. An essen
tial component of the University's academic
mission is the exchange of ideas and informa

tion; the lectures given by professors and the
student-led discussions provided just that.
Yesterday's strike also highlighted one of
the most valuable assets that Stanford has to
offer its students — each other. The strike at
tracted a diverse group of students, from
those who had attended every protest in the
Bay Area to those who had never been to one
before. The strike allowed Stanford students
to do what they do best: discuss an issue that is
so dear to their hearts and minds.
And to the University's credit, despite a pol
icy that could have shut down the strike, stu
dents were allowed to gather in the Main
Quad all day. That the strike was allowed to
take place there — a space normally reserved
for University functions like convocation —
gives recognition to the importance of the stu
dents' efforts.
But perhaps what the strike accomplished
best was to restore faith in the power of stu
dents to voice their opinions. The Bush ad
ministration may or may not respond to the
national strike; but what is important is that
students strived to say what they wanted. And
they succeeded.
Students should not, however, resume life
as normal after having organized and partici
pated in this strike. To do so would be a fatal
mistake; ifanything, yesterday's strike was the
first step in students' ongoing struggle to learn
and to make a difference. Having gained some
momentum, students protesting a U.S. pre
emptive strike against Iraq should remain fo
cused in their efforts to speak up.
