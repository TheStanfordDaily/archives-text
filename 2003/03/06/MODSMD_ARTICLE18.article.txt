# THE
						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Overcoming the Harvard complex 
### 
The following column pre
sents a direct challenge to
all professors at Stanford.
Students, don't worry — you get a
challenge as well.
I think the Stanford
community — myself included —
is suffering from an acute case of
"'second-best' mentality. While I
can't speak for everyone, I can cer
tainly make some informed gener
alizations. Many people at UC-
Berkeley suffer 'Stanford-envy' to a
certain extent — they imagine that
their lives would be somewhat bet
ter, somewhat more fulfilling, lucra
tive or exciting if they had attended
Stanford. We're relatively insulated
from such envy ourselves in relation
to most schools on the West Coast.
Traveling to Boston and New
York last week, I have to admit that
for the first time, I felt myself having
an acute case of'lvy-Envy.' Walking
through the streets of Cambridge, I
realized that Stanford and Harvard
are almost identical on most levels.
Yet when it really comes down to it,
most people conclude that, as a
whole, Harvard is just "better."
More famous people go to study
at Harvard, more movies are made
about it and that übiquitous vocab
ulary enhancement program ad in
every Sky Mall magazine entices
readers by offering them the
chance to acquire a 'Harvard grad'
(not Stanford grad) vocabulary.
We have Stanford Student En
terprises, whose activities evade
most of us. They have Harvard
Student Agencies, the largest stu
dent-run corporation in the world.
Ever heard of the "Let's Go!" trav
el books series? It is one of the
many successful subsidiaries of
Harvard Student Agencies.
And ofcourse, Harvard's accep
tance rate is slightly more compet
itive than ours, according to U.S.
News & World Report.
But above all, this problem we
have at Stanford — the burden of
the second-best mentality —
comes from a need for new, excit
ing and innovative teaching meth
ods that are currently lacking.
Stanford is "pretty good in most
disciplines and a world leader in
some." Harvard is "the world lead
er in most fields and pretty good in
some."
As a whole, we're one of the top
educational institutions in the world
because we've done a damn good
job of keeping up with the best.
If you've ever read Robert Pir
sig's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance" you might have some
idea of how Phaedrus fits in here.
Please read this book if you haven't.
Phaedrus, after becoming a
professor at an obscure school in
the Midwest, notes a fundamental
flaw in the way university-level
teaching takes place.
Students enter the classroom
with a general interest in a subject
but grow disenchanted and weary
with time, often due to a lackadaisi
cal teaching method. By the end of

the term, students enter the class
room for the sole purpose of asking,
"What will be on the final?" "What
will be covered?" and "Will there be
a curve?" Students become grade
maximizing machines. It doesn't
matter any longer which subject
they're learning, be it biochem
istry, financial mathematics 01
communication. School becomes,
"Take the information, analyze it,

and retain it long
enough to answer
test questions."
So Phaedrus
stopped giving
grades. At first, the
administration
and students were
in shock; the A stu
dents began work-

ing even harder,
and the C and I) students were
dropping out of courses earlier.
A mechanical engineering stu
dent, for example, drops out of
school due to lack of interest in ab
struse equations and tests. He takes
an entry-level job in a car-repair es
tablishment and soon realizes he is
overqualified and over-ambitious
for the job. He then decides to re
turn to the university with the hon
est desire to learn about automotive
design. He asks questions related to
his interests and is frustrated, not
excited, when material is cut from
the final exam. He graduates with a
solid knowledge and interest in au
tomotive design, having learned
the material to his heart's content
instead of simply working to obtain
a high CPA.
In the book, Phaedrus eventu
ally leaves the university due to vi
olent opposition to his idea and
never pursues his ideal of creating
an educational institution pro
pelled by the desire for knowl
edge, not grades or prestige.
The story of Phaedrus addresses
what is at the heart of our 'second
best' mentality; what it is at the heart
of the' Harvard-complex' that many
of us seem to have burrowed deep
in the back of our thoughts.
Professors, listen up.
I call for an end of taking the
path of least resistance, doing just
what it takes to teach classes and
receive tenure. I've taken one too
many classes that fit the following
script almost perfectly: I walk into
class into a large auditorium, sit
down in front of a dull Power
point presentation, slowly drift off
to sleep, wake up, concentrate
again and then leave class. Profes
sors often present the same pre
sentations year after year, only
making small modifications for
grammatical errors.
The Computer Science Depart
ment, for example, has much
room for improvement. The intro
duction CSIO6 series is taught year
after year using the same material.
I know — I was a section leader for
the CSIO6 series. 1 would guess
that the same patterns occur in
other departments. It must be ab

solutely atrocious for pre-meds.
I demand that professors not
allow students to fall asleep or to
drift off during class. I will not take
the blame for losing interest in
poorly-planned, repetitive and
drawn-out lectures.
Engage students. Make eye
contact. Please share your knowl
edge with the rest of us, who origi
nally enrolled in your course out of
interest but leave focusing only on
medians and standard deviations.
Try alternative strategies, if
that's what it takes. Go outside and
teach on the grass once a week; sit
in a circle; get to know your stu
dents. If your class is extremely
large, have lunch with 10 to 20 stu
dents each week.
Drop the ego and look at us.
Management Science & Engi
neering Prof. William Perry, for
mer secretary of defense, did.
Though over 300 students took his
course, Technology and National
Security, he gave each student an
opportunity to engage him in dis
cussion over lunch. I did it, and it
has proved to one of my most
memorable experiences.
Drop the tie and get some grass
stains on your pants.
Biological Sciences Prof. Stuart
Thompson did it. During Sopho
more College, we learned about
marine biology, ecology and envi
ronmental impact through ecolog
ical hikes, scuba diving, behind
the-scenes aquarium tours and
dinners on the beach. I learned
more about a subject in two weeks
than I do normally during an en
tire quarter.
This is not a column but a dec
laration. I call upon the faculty to
begin changing the face of Stan
ford University not only through
research and innovation but
through inspiration.
For students: This is also a call
for anyone frustrated with a
course and owns a digital camera,
video recorder or pen. Take a pic
ture of people sleeping through a
particularly poorly designed lec
ture, or make a video or audio
recording of a part of it. Send it to
me; I'll try to put them on the In
ternet and get feedback from these
professors. If you only have a pen,
write The Daily with your opin
ions. If you have real gall, write an
e-mail to your professor letting
him or her know exactly what lie
or she is doing wrong.
If we can follow the example that
Phaedrus set out, we can shed our
"second-best" mentality and truly
become a world-class institution. I
hope to one day graduate not from
the most selective, lucrative,or
grade-inflated school in the world
but from "Stanford: The best place
in the world to learn and create."
For all you Phaedruses out
there, this means you.
