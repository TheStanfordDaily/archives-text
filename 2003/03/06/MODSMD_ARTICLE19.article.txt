The Daily's support of student strike
'a naked attempt to delegitimize
supports of the war'
The Daily's editorial, "Support the Stu
dent Strike" (Marc h 5), is so poorly con
ceived as to defy belief. The first para
graph says it all. "You have a choice today.
You can wake up and go to ( lass. You can
pretend nothing is different. Or you can
stand up for your beliefs." That's terrific.
1 thank The Daily for pointing out that
anyone who does not skip ( lass is not only
wrong but also cowardly. This type of
moral didacticism always contributes to a
real dialogue on an issue.
Sarcasm aside, perhaps the editorial
staff overlooked the obvious: going to class
is also a statement of belief. It is not, as the
article suggests, forfeiting "a golden op
portunity to participate in democracy."
For advocates of war on Iraq like myself,
going to class is a golden opportunity to
answer the anti-war opposition with a re
sounding "shove it." My voice is no less
valuable because I choose to express my
opinion by going to class.
Furthermore, the editorial lauds the
courage of professors who canceled (lasses

yesterday. Again, this stance is inappropri
ate because it suggests that those profes
sors who held class were somehow shirk
ing their moral duty. Canceling classes im
poses a professor's political views on his or
her students, by depriving them of the op
portunity to express their support for war
by attending class. Professors should be
moral and political leaders at Stanford, but
not at the cost of robbing a student of his
or her voice.
Finally, the argument that "someone in
the Bush administration is bound to no
tice" is also incorrect. The hyper-liberal
Stanford community does not represent
the type of Americans that inspire fear in a
Republican administration. Real, pro
longed opposition to the war by main
stream society may be enough to halt the
march towards action, but 1,000 kids from
Stanford missing a chemistry section isn't
going to have any effect at all.
Above all, the editorial makes the mis
take of assuming that one course of action
is the only one appropriate. Granted, an
editorial is not a news piece. But its por
trayal of the lightness of skipping class is a
naked attempt to delegitimize any sup
porters of the war.

Strike speaker encouraged 'sedition'
I briefly attended the "Books Not
Bombs" demonstration in the Main Quad
yesterday. I was hoping to gain some in
sight into the information and events that
surround our nation on the precipice of
war, but I have to say I was appalled at
what I heard. One of the speakers en
couraged I he audience to attempt to par
alyze our c ities and economy in the event
that the United States engages in military
action against Iraq. There is a name for
this type of action: sedition. It is bad
enough that we have to worry about
threats from terrorist organizations like
Al-Qaida.
We should not have to worry about our
own citizens trying to sabotage and de
stroy our country from the inside. Our
wonderful cities and free market economy

are a large part of what makes the United
States the most tree and diverse nation iti
the world. If you want to live in a country
with a paralyzed economy and absolutely
no freedom or diversity, move to Iraq.

Bike to fight the war on Iraq
Notwithstanding Jimmy Mosqueda's
points about reasons for walking in his col
umn, "Gandhi walked, why don't you?"
(March 5), I'd like to question his charac
terization of the bicycle as a "type of trans
portation better suited to middle school
ers." I found it ironic that this philosophy
was being espoused on a day when hun
dreds of Stanford students were gathering
to protest a war that is driven in part by
America's consumption of fossil fuels. It's
also confusing (hat in "Questioning car
culture" (Feb. 19), Mosqueda touted pub
lic transportation.
While Mosqueda did not compare bi
cycles to cars in his most recent column,
this pervasive perception that bicycles are
"for middle schoolers" or somehow not a
viable transportation alternative for
adults is part of what brought us to the oil

/ war crisis in the first place. There are nu
merous environmental, economic and
health benefits of bicycle transportation.
The fact is that bicycles are, simply put,
the most efficient form of transportation
in the world; a human on a bicycle is more
efficient, per calorie expended, than any
animal or any machine. The great SUV
debate simply confuses the issue: even
driving a hybrid will release greenhouse
gases and cause highway congestion. The
problem is not driving SUVs. The prob
lem is driving. Bicycles are not toys, but
rather a key to unlocking so many of our
current problems.
For those of you who attended the
"Books Not Bombs" strike yesterday but
still drive into Palo Alto, think about the
benefits both to you (save gas money, get a
workout) and the environment (less CO2
emissions, less dependence on fossil fuels,
less traffic) by doing your errands on your
bike. Run an errand on two wheels instead
of four and then laugh at the time you
used to spend sweating on the stationary
machine in Tresidder. Consider fighting
the war on Iraq not only with books, but
also with your bike. You'll find a whole
new world once you've stepped outside
your automobile.

Bike to fight the war on Iraq
Notwithstanding Jimmy Mosqueda's
points about reasons for walking in his col
umn, "Gandhi walked, why don't you?"
(March 5), I'd like to question his charac
terization of the bicycle as a "type of trans
portation better suited to middle school
ers." I found it ironic that this philosophy
was being espoused on a day when hun
dreds of Stanford students were gathering
to protest a war that is driven in part by
America's consumption of fossil fuels. It's
also confusing (hat in "Questioning car
culture" (Feb. 19), Mosqueda touted pub
lic transportation.
While Mosqueda did not compare bi
cycles to cars in his most recent column,
this pervasive perception that bicycles are
"for middle schoolers" or somehow not a
viable transportation alternative for
adults is part of what brought us to the oil

/ war crisis in the first place. There are nu
merous environmental, economic and
health benefits of bicycle transportation.
The fact is that bicycles are, simply put,
the most efficient form of transportation
in the world; a human on a bicycle is more
efficient, per calorie expended, than any
animal or any machine. The great SUV
debate simply confuses the issue: even
driving a hybrid will release greenhouse
gases and cause highway congestion. The
problem is not driving SUVs. The prob
lem is driving. Bicycles are not toys, but
rather a key to unlocking so many of our
current problems.
For those of you who attended the
"Books Not Bombs" strike yesterday but
still drive into Palo Alto, think about the
benefits both to you (save gas money, get a
workout) and the environment (less CO2
emissions, less dependence on fossil fuels,
less traffic) by doing your errands on your
bike. Run an errand on two wheels instead
of four and then laugh at the time you
used to spend sweating on the stationary
machine in Tresidder. Consider fighting
the war on Iraq not only with books, but
also with your bike. You'll find a whole
new world once you've stepped outside
your automobile.

The Daily's support of student strike
'a naked attempt to delegitimize
supports of the war'
The Daily's editorial, "Support the Stu
dent Strike" (Marc h 5), is so poorly con
ceived as to defy belief. The first para
graph says it all. "You have a choice today.
You can wake up and go to ( lass. You can
pretend nothing is different. Or you can
stand up for your beliefs." That's terrific.
1 thank The Daily for pointing out that
anyone who does not skip ( lass is not only
wrong but also cowardly. This type of
moral didacticism always contributes to a
real dialogue on an issue.
Sarcasm aside, perhaps the editorial
staff overlooked the obvious: going to class
is also a statement of belief. It is not, as the
article suggests, forfeiting "a golden op
portunity to participate in democracy."
For advocates of war on Iraq like myself,
going to class is a golden opportunity to
answer the anti-war opposition with a re
sounding "shove it." My voice is no less
valuable because I choose to express my
opinion by going to class.
Furthermore, the editorial lauds the
courage of professors who canceled (lasses

yesterday. Again, this stance is inappropri
ate because it suggests that those profes
sors who held class were somehow shirk
ing their moral duty. Canceling classes im
poses a professor's political views on his or
her students, by depriving them of the op
portunity to express their support for war
by attending class. Professors should be
moral and political leaders at Stanford, but
not at the cost of robbing a student of his
or her voice.
Finally, the argument that "someone in
the Bush administration is bound to no
tice" is also incorrect. The hyper-liberal
Stanford community does not represent
the type of Americans that inspire fear in a
Republican administration. Real, pro
longed opposition to the war by main
stream society may be enough to halt the
march towards action, but 1,000 kids from
Stanford missing a chemistry section isn't
going to have any effect at all.
Above all, the editorial makes the mis
take of assuming that one course of action
is the only one appropriate. Granted, an
editorial is not a news piece. But its por
trayal of the lightness of skipping class is a
naked attempt to delegitimize any sup
porters of the war.

Student strike embodies higher education
Yesterday's "Books Not Bombs" strike
in the Main Quad made me proud to be an
alum and staff member. It was truly the
embodiment of "higher education."

Strike speaker encouraged 'sedition'
I briefly attended the "Books Not
Bombs" demonstration in the Main Quad
yesterday. I was hoping to gain some in
sight into the information and events that
surround our nation on the precipice of
war, but I have to say I was appalled at
what I heard. One of the speakers en
couraged I he audience to attempt to par
alyze our c ities and economy in the event
that the United States engages in military
action against Iraq. There is a name for
