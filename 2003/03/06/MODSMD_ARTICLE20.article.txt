## No. 1 men ready to make waves Undefeated Cardinal hopes to collect its 22nd conference title 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
With the start of the Pacific-10
conference meet today in Long
Beach, the No. 1 Cardinal men's
swimming team (8-0) is focusing
on executing one final dress re
hearsal for the NCAA Champi
onships later this month. In addi
tion, Stanford will shoot for its
22nd consecutive conference title
and an indelible spot in sports his
tory.
"This meet has exactly the same
format as the NCAA champi
onship meet," coach Skip Kenney
said. "This is it — a dress rehearsal
for the end of the season. We need
to swim fast this weekend so that
we can psychologically tell our
selves that we are going to be the
ones to-beat at the NCAA meet."
The Cardinal's 21-year win
ning streak in-conference is the
longest in collegiate sports history.
If Stanford's undefeated record
during the regular dual meet sea

son otters any indication of the
outcome of this weekend's compe
tition, the team should have no
trouble reclaiming the conference
title once again.
"Our team is definitely in the
driver's seat, and 1 think that the
other Pac-10 schools know that,"
senior co-captain Dan Westcott
said. "We still have to go out there
and race, but the ball is in our
court. 1 don't think anyone is too
anxious or worried. We are ap
proaching this as what we need to
do before we head into the cham
pionships, and now it's just a mat
ter of taking care of business."
No. 3 Cal and No. 8 Southern
California should be Stanford's
toughest competition this week
end. Cal's sprint core, including
captain Anthony Ervin, a 2000
Olympic gold medalist, will chal
lenge the Cardinal in relays and
sprint events. Ervin was named
the 2002 Pac-10 Swimmer of the
Year after he finished second in
the 50 free and led his 400 free
relay team to victory.
Following his record-setting
performance at Avery during the
Stanford-USC dual meet earlier
this season, Erik Vendt, USC's dis
tance powerhouse, looks to be in

good position to win the 1650-
yard freestyle for the third consec
utive year. Vendt is also the de
fending champion in the 500 free.
Despite Cal's edge in the sprint
events and USC's strong distance
base, Kenney believes that his
team's depth will lead it to the title.
"In dual meets, we have to
swim fast, but at this meet we get to
show the real strength of our
team," Kenney said. "These guys
just want to let loose, set records
and win this weekend."
At last year's Pac-10 meet, the
Cardinal plowed through the
competition, outscoring runner
up California by over 200 points.
Stanford claimed three relay and
seven individual titles. The 400
medley relay set a new Pac-10
meet record in 3:09.22, and
Markus Rogan broke the meet
record in the 400 individual med
ley.
Other Pac-10 champions last
year included Randall Bal, who
won his third consecutive title in
the 100 back and Michael Bruce,
who swam away with wins in both
breaststroke events. In addition,
Dan Trupin set a Pac-10 record in

the 200 individual medley with
his winning time, and Dan West
cott claimed the top spot in the
200 butterfly.
In recognition of his team's
outstanding performance, Ken
ney received the Pac-10 Coach of
the Year award for the second
consecutive year.
"The pool that they are swim
ming in is really fast, and our guys
always go there with a lot of confi
dence," Kenney said. "This is the
time for those guys who have not
made their NCAA qualifying cuts
to step it up and make them. This
isjust the most exciting time ofthe
year because they work so hard
and now they get the chance to go
out there and to swim fast."
Several Stanford swimmers
have already posted times fast
enough to automatically qualify
them for the NCAA champi
onships. Junior Peter Marshall,
Bal and Westcott all posted "A"
qualifying times in (he 100 back.
Westcott and Rogan qualified in
the 200 back, and Rogan and
Trupin will swim the 200 individ
ual medley. In addition, sopho
more Jayme Cramer made the cut
in the 200 butterfly earlier this
season.
