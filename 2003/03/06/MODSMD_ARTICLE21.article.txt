# Could this be the year for the Red Sox?
## Babin talks baseball

Pitchers and catchers,
baby. Pitchers and catch
ers. Those, of course,
were the words of a few
days ago, the words with which we
baptize the beginning of spring
training every year. Now we've
moved on, to full team reporting,
split squad games and those first
petty clubhouse arguments.
There have been reams of
paper written on baseball spring

training. How it
serves as a
metaphor for our
collective rebirth,
for another
chance. How it
shows us the
cyclical nature of
life, how it shows
us the passage of

time as veterans retire and rookies
come into their own. How it shows
us how time stands still as 40-year
old men become, once again, en
grossed in a child's game.
But there are much more basic
reasons to love spring training,
and celebrate the fact that it has
once again come to grace our
planet.
Reason No. 1: A "research" trip
to the Cactus League in Arizona
gives a sportswriter (like, say, my
self) an excellent opportunity to
make sure Stanford-Arizona State
co-ed relationships are still on
good terms.
Reason No. 2: It's perfectly ac
ceptable to drink beer during a base
ball game. Beer tastes better when
imbibed outside in the sun â€” every
one knows that. And chances are
there is a baseball game going on,

somewhere, right now. The odds
are once again in your favor after a
long off-season of Canadian lager.
Reason No. 3: In some Grape
fruit League camp on the Florida
coast there is a journeyman reliev
er who is convinced that this is his
year.
(Of course, as a Red Sox fan I
can't really make fun of people
who really do think that "this is the
year.")
I know there are some people
who could care less about spring
training, who could probably care
less about baseball. It's slow, it's
boring, the labor struggle turns
them off, they haven't watched
since the strike, the ball is juiced,
the players are juiced, the Yan
kees suck (that one's true, actual
ly), blah blah blah.
Look, I understand their ar
guments, and they have some
points. I admit some baseball
games are terribly boring and
slow. I think some players may
take "performance enhancing"
supplements.
But that can't take away from a
sweet 6-4-3 turned in at twilight
on a summer evening. Can't stop
the llight ofa bomb jacked into the
night sky that soars into the upper
deck. Can't stop the rally monkey,
the double steal, the suicide
squeeze in the bottom of the 10th.
()fcourse, we're a long way away
from all that. We're still months
from knowing who's for real and
who's just pretending. (We've still
got people running around camp
wearing jerseys that should be on
