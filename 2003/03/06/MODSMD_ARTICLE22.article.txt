# Gymnasts drop to Golden Bears

### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The popular misconception that tans should be
quiet during a gymnastics performance was de
bunked in Stanford's five-way meet last weekend as
Michigan loudly rang a cowbell it had brought to
cheer their teammates along.
The gymnasts say there's nothing better than a
loud crowd that is really into a meet.
"I love the noise," senior Paul O'Leary said. "I
think they should sell beer at gymnastics meets and
have the crowd get a little more rowdy and have a
good time."
"I get all fired up," junior Dan Gill said. "I love
hearing my friends yelling out there. If you can't
zone out then you've got other problems.
"It's a sport where a lot of other things can go
wrong, and you should be able to zone it out."
Even coach Thom Glielmi agrees.
"It's a sporting event," Glielmi said. "They're
athletes and if they're trained properly, it shouldn't
matter. Most of them come from noisy gyms with
girl's floor music and preschool kids all over the
place anyway."
The loud atmosphere in Burnham Pavilion
boosted the No. 8 Cardinal to its season-best score
of 213.0 as the team soundly defeated No 5 Michi
gan, No. 9 Nebraska and the Washington club
team, but was still unable to overcome No. 4 Cali
fornia on Senior Night.
"We see the other teams' scores every week, but
it's good to actually see the gymnastics we'll be up

against at NCAAs," said Gill, whose consistent per
formance won the floor, vault, and all-around titles.
"It's good knowing we're in the same league as the
rest of the teams in the country."
Overall, Glielmi said the team performed as well,
counting only seven falls in their final score.
"If a teammate was having a problem, the team
was still able to put four good routines on each
event," Glielmi said.
The Cardinal was within striking distance of Cal
at all times, but falls on the pommel horse and high
bar prevented the squad from getting within three
points of Cal. The teams had split its first two meet
ings this season and are expected to meet at least
two more times in the postseason.
The Cardinal was able to cut Cal's lead on rings,
where senior Marshall Erwin won the event by hit
ting a great routine fora score of 9.75. This was
Erwin's toughest collegiate competition to date —
he had to contend with Michigan's Conan Parzu
chowski's score of 9.6.
Another bright spot for the Cardinal was
O'Leary on the parallel bars, who scored a 9.3 for
second place on the event. O'Leary has yet to finish
out of the top three in parallel bars competition this
year.
The Cardinal had one last chance to catch up to
Cal on the final event, the high bar. The first three
team members hit their routines, with senior Cade
Raggio performing a nearly flawless set. The next
two gymnasts missed their releases

and Gill, the last competitor of the
night caught a "finger-tipper" lull
twisting double back flip release
and was unable to connect the one
and-a-half twisting hop release out
of it. The routine was still good
enough for third place, but not
enough to overcome the Bears'
three-point lead.
"I think we did better as a
team," O'Leary said. "It would
have been nice to hit pommel

horse and high bar and given Cal a
run for first, but we definitely im
proved."
The team now prepares for its
final and most demanding week of
the regular season, as they hit the *
peak intensity of their training
cycle and compete against defend
ing NCAA champion Oklahoma,
Ohio State and the Air Force Acad

three days.
"This is going to be tough
week," Gill said. "We're going to
be training pretty hard. We need
to get some strong away-scores."
