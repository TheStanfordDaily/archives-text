# Tennis smashes Tulane's hopes in shutout
## 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a beautiful clay at the Taube Family Ten
nis Center yesterday, the No. 6 Stanford men's
tennis team (8-2) rolled to the program's all-time
win No. 999, demolishing No. 29 Tulane by a
score of 7-0.
"What a heck of an effort by our guys," coach
Dick Gould said. "Scott Lipsky and James Pade
were sick and they just gutted it out. Tulane is a
good team and to beat them so decisively is a
great effort."

Today: No. 6 Stanford 7, Tulane 0
at Arizona, Friday.

The doubles point was decided quickly as
the Cardinal picked up easy victories on courts
two and three. Freshmen KC Corkery and
James Pade (No. 18) beat Tulane's Dimitriy
Koch and Mattias Westerberg 8-3. Sopho
mores Sam Warburg and Phil Sheng, playing
together for the first time this year, defeated
Patrizio Maucci and Hannu Piiroinen by the
same score.
In a matchup between two of the country's
top doubles teams, Tulane's No. 7 Michael
Kogan and Victor Romero edged Cardinal se
nior Ail-Americans David Martin and Scott Lip
sky (No. 5) 9-8. The match was even through
out, but Kogan and Romero squeaked out the
tie-breaker 7-5.
The Cardinal dominated the singles
matchups, losing only one set. Lipsky, playing
No. 1 for the second time this season, picked up
his best win of the year against No. 17 Kogan.
Lipsky won the first set 6-4 before Kogan battled
back to win the second 6-3. At that point, the Car
dinal was leading 6-0, so the two played a 10-
point tiebreaker rather than an entire third set.
Lipsky won 10-5.
The win was even more impressive consider
ing Lipsky was ill with the stomach flu and con
sidered not playing.
"I'm exhausted right now, but I wasexhaust-

Ed at the start of the match," Lipsky said. "He
wanted to play out a third set, but I just wasn't
feeling well enough to do that. I summoned the
energy to pull out the breaker."
On court two, No. 19 Martin trounced
Romero 6-2, 6-2. It was the first singles match to
finish, putting the Cardinal up 2-0.
No. 42 KC. Corkery dispatched Koch 6-1, 6-4
on court three. On match point, Corkery
pumped his fist in celebration after Koch hit a re
turn of serve over the baseline. But he failed to re
alize that his opponent had called the serve out.
Unfazed, Corkery preceded to hit a second
ace to finish the match in style.

In the most lopsided score, No. 43 Warburg
beat Westerberg 6-0, 6-0 on court four. Wester
berg didn't help his own cause by first receiving a
point penalty for arguing with the umpire and
then a game penalty for throwing his racket.
"I had the longest first game," Warburg said.
"I was still at 0-0 when every other match had al
ready finished at least four games. Alter I got that
first game under my belt, it was much easier after
that. The key was that I served well today."
On court five, Pade did not let the stomach flu
bother him in a 6-3,6-2 win over Jorge Lievano.

At the No. 1 singles spot, senior Scott Lipsky — currently ranked 112 th — scored a huge victory against
17th-ranked Michael Kolgan of Tulane as the Cardinal won 7-0 and recorded its 999 th win in program
history.
"1 got off to a good start and after
that I just grinded the rest of the
match out," Pade said. "I wasn't
feeling too well, but I fought
through it."
Junior Carter Morris picked up
his second dual-match win of the
year on court six, as he took down
Piiroinen 6-3,6-3.
"At the beginning of the match I
was really tight and nervous for
some reason," Morris said. "Mid

way through the first set 1 just de
cided to start hitting everything as
hard as I could to try and loosen up.
It worked and I played much better
after that."
Stanford has compiled a 999-
320-4 mark since official records
began being kept in 1926. Seven
hundred thirty-nine of those victo
ries have come under current head
coach Dick Gould.
The Cardinal will shoot for victo
ries No. 1000 and 1001 when they
travel to Arizona this weekend.

Lipsky won 10-5.
The win was even more impressive consider
ing Lipsky was ill with the stomach flu and con
sidered not playing.
"I'm exhausted right now, but I wasexhaust-

Ed at the start of the match," Lipsky said. "He
wanted to play out a third set, but I just wasn't
feeling well enough to do that. I summoned the
energy to pull out the breaker."
On court two, No. 19 Martin trounced
Romero 6-2, 6-2. It was the first singles match to
finish, putting the Cardinal up 2-0.
No. 42 KC. Corkery dispatched Koch 6-1, 6-4
on court three. On match point, Corkery
pumped his fist in celebration after Koch hit a re
turn of serve over the baseline. But he failed to re
alize that his opponent had called the serve out.
Unfazed, Corkery preceded to hit a second
ace to finish the match in style.

In the most lopsided score, No. 43 Warburg
beat Westerberg 6-0, 6-0 on court four. Wester
berg didn't help his own cause by first receiving a
point penalty for arguing with the umpire and
then a game penalty for throwing his racket.
"I had the longest first game," Warburg said.
"I was still at 0-0 when every other match had al
ready finished at least four games. Alter I got that
first game under my belt, it was much easier after
that. The key was that I served well today."
On court five, Pade did not let the stomach flu
bother him in a 6-3,6-2 win over Jorge Lievano.

At the No. 1 singles spot, senior Scott Lipsky — currently ranked 112 th — scored a huge victory against
17th-ranked Michael Kolgan of Tulane as the Cardinal won 7-0 and recorded its 999 th win in program
history.
"1 got off to a good start and after
that I just grinded the rest of the
match out," Pade said. "I wasn't
feeling too well, but I fought
through it."
Junior Carter Morris picked up
his second dual-match win of the
year on court six, as he took down
Piiroinen 6-3,6-3.
"At the beginning of the match I
was really tight and nervous for
some reason," Morris said. "Mid

way through the first set 1 just de
cided to start hitting everything as
hard as I could to try and loosen up.
It worked and I played much better
after that."
Stanford has compiled a 999-
320-4 mark since official records
began being kept in 1926. Seven
hundred thirty-nine of those victo
ries have come under current head
coach Dick Gould.
The Cardinal will shoot for victo
ries No. 1000 and 1001 when they
travel to Arizona this weekend.
Stanford takes on Arizona (5-4) to
