# Softball rallies en route to Tampa
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter a tough weekend at home,
the No. 11 Stanford softball squad
(14-6) has taken off to Tampa, Fla.
in hopes of winning its third con
secutive Speedline Invitational
title.
The Cardinal is eager to im
prove its fate from last weekend's 2-
3 performance at the Stanford
Classic here on the Farm.
Despite impressive perfor
mances in the circle by junior
hurler Dana Sorensen and senior
pitcher Tori Nyberg, Stanford was
unable to push the necessary runs
across home plate fora Cardinal
tourney championship.
Stanford is looking forward to
this weekend as an opportunity to
make some changes.
"We need to be more consistent
at the plate and have better at-bats
as far as pitch selection," said fresh
man shortstop Lauren Lappin.
"This past weekend we lacked in
tensity and it affected us tremen
dously. We need to focus on it and
get that energy back."
If Lappin leads that charge at
the plate, as she has been so far this
season, the Stanford lineup will be
one to watch out for.
Lappin is swinging her way
through a very successful collegiate

beginning. The freshman is lead
ing the team, batting .400 in her
first 20 games of NCAA softball and
tilling the role of leadoff batter for
the Cardinal.
Also producing offensively for
the Cardinal are sophomore right
fielder Meghan Sickler and sopho
more utility player Michelle Thiry.
Sickler has been proving herself
in the box recently, turning out a 3-
for-3 performance against Long
Beach State this past weekend and
hitting just below .300 so far this
season.
Coming through in the clutch
most recently for the Cardinal,
Thiry has integrated her bat into
the lineup this year as a designated
player, pinch-hitter and first base
man. The utility player has two
doubles, one home run and seven
RBI so far, hitting .400 with run
ners in scoring position.
Faced with the challenge of cool
ing off Stanford's hot bats this
weekend are Coastal Carolina,
Western Michigan, No. 22 South
Florida, Long Island and Illinois.
The Cardinal will face off against
these five squads in a round-robin
format before heading into single
elimination ball Saturday evening.
The last time Stanford compet
ed at the Speedline Invitational, it
returned to the Farm with a cham
pionship, seven wins and an im

pressive showing that included
outscoring opponents 48-7.
The Cardinal is confident that it
will return with a third-straight title,
but after last weekend's disappoint
ing performance, the team is more
focused on playing to its potential.
"We need to fcx us on playing as a
team and if we do that we should be
tine." Sorensen said. "We are play
ing it one game at a time, but we are
confident in ourselves and we are
going to go in and try and win it."
If Sorensen continues to work
on the rubber as she did last week
end for the Cardinal, opposing bat
ters will have trouble keeping up.
This past Saturday, the two-time
All-American threw her first career
no-hitter including 15 strikeouts
against No. 12 Georgia. Sorensen is
currently 5-1 on the year with her
only loss to No. 3 Nebraska.
If the Stanford pitching staff
continues to fan batters at the plate
and the Cardinal's own bats step up
to the plate, another tournament
title could be in the squad's future.
"I think that we just need to be
more aggressive at the plate," Lap
pin said. "We need to make adjust
ments within at-bats and between
at-bats.
"We are trying to get better in
every game we play and we are
going to take this tournament one
game at a time."
