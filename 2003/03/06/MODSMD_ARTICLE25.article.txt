On Saturday, Stanford rugby will both say
goodbye to its most familiar face and officially
introduce its new stadium and clubhouse.
Franck Boivert, Stanford's coach since 1988,
will coach in his final game Saturday when the
men face oil" against UC-Davis. It is fitting that
after 15 years on the Farm, Boivert will see the
dedication of the Hal Steuber Family Stadium
and John Doyle Family Club House, Stanford
rugby's new facilities.

"The new field is beautiful and an incredible
improvement over the old field which always
threatens to take out an ankle or knee because
of its uneveness," Sonrisa Lucero said.
The field will see five matches during the
event, starting at 11 a.m. when the No. 1 Stan
ford women (3-0-1) will play UC-Davis. The
men's game will follow at 1 p.m., and both
squad's B-teams will play, in addition to a high
school match and an exhibition featuring Stan
ford's men B-team vs. selected high school ath
letes.
The men enter the match with a 3-6 overall
record in match play and a three-game losing
streak. Their last win came in a 30-26 edge of
Oregon on Feb. 9. But playing at Steuber Sta
dium bodes well for Boivert's squad, as each of
their three wins has come at home.
The women met No. 2 Chico State last Sat
urday in a fight for first place in the Pacific

Coast Conference, but could only manage a 10-
10 tie.
"It was disappointing to tie. I felt we could
have won the game, but we were a little frazzled
by their pressure," Lucero said.
Both teams came out hard and kept each
other scoreless throughout most of the first
half, despite countless llirtations with the try
zone by both teams.
Stanford ended the half with a penalty kick

by Rachelle McManus, putting them ahead 3-0
going into the second half. Stanford continued
to make drives to score, with a try finally com
ing early in the half as the result of superb pass
ing through the backline to wing Krystal Quin
lan. Chico did not lose hope, though, and came
back with a try of its own late in the game. The
game came to a climax when Chico State kicked
for points with no time left, ending the game
with a tie, 10-10.
