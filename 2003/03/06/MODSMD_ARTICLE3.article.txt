newly formed Coalition of
Students Against War, it
was a promising step in a
student anti-war move-

ment that is likely intensify if things go awry
in Iraq.
"I think everyone's expectations have been
surpassed," said senior Clara Webb, straining
to be heard above the applause for Psycholo
gy Prof. Philip Zimbardo's afternoon lecture
on government-fueled tear of terrorism. In
deed, both the tenor and scope of the event
contrasted sharply with the average campus
rally.
Instead of the usual retinue of radicals
and curious passers-by, the event drew a
broad swath of largely left-leaning students,
faculty, staff and community members. In
stead of a handful of students shouting shril
ly into a megaphone in White Plaza, the
Main Quad brimmed with a rotating cast of
professors, activists, campus leaders and
performing artists.
"It's a type of event that's very appropri
ate to Stanford," said junior Leticia Ramirez.
"You don't learn about the war in econ class
es or hum bio classes, but we have econ pro

lessors and hum bio professors out here
talking about the war."
According to organizers, (>0 faculty mem
bers pledged their support for the strike.
Among them was Neurology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, who led a teach-in on the evolu
tionary roots of aggression and warfare.
"This is great," Sapolsky said after his lec
ture, gesturing toward the energetic crowd.
"This should keep happening."
But while the presence ofprominent pro
fessors lent an air of intellectual authority to
the proceedings, not everyone was enthused
that 24 faculty decided to cancel their classes
in a show of support for the strike. Junior
Andy Claven criticized the professors for
"forcing conformity" by imposing the strike
on students, and University President John
Hennessy said he hoped faculty would
"have the generosity" to reschedule.
"I think canceling classes is unfortunate,
because it imposes on students who wanted
to take the class," Hennessy said.
Despite the large turnout at the Quad,
most students attended classes as usual.
Large lectures in the social sciences report
edly drew the lowest turnout, while even
some of the most fervent anti-war demon
strators admitted that they slipped away
from the protest to attend important labs or
seminars.
