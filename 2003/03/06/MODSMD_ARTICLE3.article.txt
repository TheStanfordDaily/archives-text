newly formed Coalition of
Students Against War, it
was a promising step in a
student anti-war move-

ment that is likely intensify if things go awry
in Iraq.
"I think everyone's expectations have been
surpassed," said senior Clara Webb, straining
to be heard above the applause for Psycholo
gy Prof. Philip Zimbardo's afternoon lecture
on government-fueled tear of terrorism. In
deed, both the tenor and scope of the event
contrasted sharply with the average campus
rally.
Instead of the usual retinue of radicals
and curious passers-by, the event drew a
broad swath of largely left-leaning students,
faculty, staff and community members. In
stead of a handful of students shouting shril
ly into a megaphone in White Plaza, the
Main Quad brimmed with a rotating cast of
professors, activists, campus leaders and
performing artists.
"It's a type of event that's very appropri
ate to Stanford," said junior Leticia Ramirez.
"You don't learn about the war in econ class
es or hum bio classes, but we have econ pro

lessors and hum bio professors out here
talking about the war."
According to organizers, (>0 faculty mem
bers pledged their support for the strike.
Among them was Neurology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, who led a teach-in on the evolu
tionary roots of aggression and warfare.
"This is great," Sapolsky said after his lec
ture, gesturing toward the energetic crowd.
"This should keep happening."
But while the presence ofprominent pro
fessors lent an air of intellectual authority to
the proceedings, not everyone was enthused
that 24 faculty decided to cancel their classes
in a show of support for the strike. Junior
Andy Claven criticized the professors for
"forcing conformity" by imposing the strike
on students, and University President John
Hennessy said he hoped faculty would
"have the generosity" to reschedule.
"I think canceling classes is unfortunate,
because it imposes on students who wanted
to take the class," Hennessy said.
Despite the large turnout at the Quad,
most students attended classes as usual.
Large lectures in the social sciences report
edly drew the lowest turnout, while even
some of the most fervent anti-war demon
strators admitted that they slipped away
from the protest to attend important labs or
seminars.

of the "Books Not Bombs" student strike in the Quad yesterday. Around 1,000 students attended.
lecture — full except for one stu
dent who asked to be excused to at
tend the protest — students rose
from their seats and peered out
the windows as a noisy crowd of
about 300 early risers marched by
on their way to the Quad. Two
participants entered the classroom
to apologize for the disturbance.
Polite protesters? One student
speculated that the good manners
resulted from administrative pres
sure, given the University's official
policy against noisy demonstra
tions in the Quad. But the gesture
was indicative of the rally's inclu
sive spirit.
Sophomore trie Shih, acting as
emcee, emphasized the need to
"be respectful of students who
choose not to strike," likely disap
pointing counter-protesters like
sophomore Capp Culver. Toting a

"Bomb Saddam" placard, Culver
appeared poised to stir up trouble
at the first sign that the anti-war ac
tivists weren't respecting his view
point.
Those who had expected a
confrontation between protesters
and administrators may also have
been surprised to see top Univer
sity officials standing by while
strike leaders boomed their mes
sages through an amplified
sound system. Despite an official
stance barring the use of the
Quad for the demonstration, the
inaction of administrators
seemed to imply a tacit recogni
tion of the exceptional nature of
the event.
The kinder, gentler protest at
mosphere carried over to the
teach-ins. In one session. Political
Science Prof. Emeritus David
Abernethy addressed both "per
suasive and unpersuasive" anti
war arguments, imbuing his
speech with a sense of balance
rarely seen at political protests.

7 dorit know about you, but Ifeel that what we are
doing here is right!
— Eric Shih, sophomore

Student presenters also steered
away from invective, an approach
that seemed calculated to avoid
alienating the moderates who are
sometimes turned off by radical
protest rhetoric. Still, some would
be participants scattered when the
talk turned to affirmative action.
Senior Meghana Reddy ac
knowledged that addressing issues
tangential to the war can be risky,
but noted that the "Books Not
Bombs" theme included the no
tion that access to education
should be prioritized over military
spending.
"It's people of color who are af
fected," she said. "It would be a lie

for us not to make those points re
ally central."
It would also be inconsistent
with the makeup of the anti-war al
liance. The phrase "broad coali
tion" does not adequately capture
the incredible diversity of its con
stituent groups, many of whose
missions center on ethnic advocacy.
Equally prominent were themes
of democracy and morality.
Dozens participated in a letter
writing campaign directed at Na
tional Security Adviser Condoleez
za Rice and U.S. Senators Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, and
several students registered to vote
at a Green I'artv booth.

An emotional peak came when
Shih shouted, "I don't know about
you, but I feel that what we are
doing here is right," eliciting a roar
ofapplause.
Still, many students were less
stirred by the content of the
protest than by the debate sur
rounding the strike.
Passing by the rally on the way
home from class, sophomore Lau
ren Friedman said she appreciated
that students were exercising their
right to dissent but disagreed with
their tactics.
"I pay enough to take classes at
this school that I'm not going to
ditch them in order to disturb
other people's ( lasses," she said. "I
don't think [the strike] is going to
affect the outcome of our govern
ment's decisions at all."
Friedman was part of a majori
ty of students who skipped the
strike but still found it a hot topic of
conversation. Over dinner at Phi
Sig, residents — most of whom
had stopped by the Quad briefly

on their way to or from class — ar
gued over the legitimacy of profes
sors' decisions to cancel classes and
conduct teach-ins.
A core group of 80 to 100 ac
tivists remained in the Quad all
day, chanting along with every
speaker, and five to 10 conserva
tives countered with views like
Culver's: "Saddam wants to ham
per the American way of life, [and]
these people are just helping him."
But the clearest testament to the
strike's influence could be seen in
the campus-wide dialogue and de
bate, which touched even those
who are typically labeled as apa
thetic.
"I lopefully this will start kind of
a grassroots word-of-mouth
thing," said sophomore Robin
Stevens, who spent much of her
morning in the Quad before rush
ing off to a lab. "Friends will tell
each other what they learned at
the teach-in, and maybe it will
build support for more rallies in
the future."
