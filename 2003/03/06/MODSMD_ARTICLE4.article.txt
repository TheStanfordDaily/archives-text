# Toledo draws mild response
## 
### FRANCES LEWIS 
Monday's announcement that Peruvian Pres
ident Alejandro Toledo will be the 2003 Com
mencement speaker has sparked little discussion
among seniors, most of whom have expressed ei
ther ambivalence or a mild optimism toward the
Stanford graduate's selection.
The reaction —or lack thereof— to Toledo's
selection is a start contrast to the uproar, whether
positive or negative, over other recent speakers
such as National Security Advisor and former
University Provost Condoleezza Rice, Hewlett-
Packard CKO Carly Fiorina and United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Toledo was chosen because of his internation
al prominence and connections with the Stan
ford community. Toledo received master's de
grees in education and economics and a doctor
ate in education from Stanford.
Many seniors were not familiar with Toledo
until Tuesday when they learned of his selection,
contributing to the muted reaction.
One senior commented, "Before today, could
anyone have named the president of Peru or said
what's going on in that country?"
