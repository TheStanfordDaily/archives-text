# Toledo draws mild response
## 
### FRANCES LEWIS 
Monday's announcement that Peruvian Pres
ident Alejandro Toledo will be the 2003 Com
mencement speaker has sparked little discussion
among seniors, most of whom have expressed ei
ther ambivalence or a mild optimism toward the
Stanford graduate's selection.
The reaction —or lack thereof— to Toledo's
selection is a start contrast to the uproar, whether
positive or negative, over other recent speakers
such as National Security Advisor and former
University Provost Condoleezza Rice, Hewlett-
Packard CKO Carly Fiorina and United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Toledo was chosen because of his internation
al prominence and connections with the Stan
ford community. Toledo received master's de
grees in education and economics and a doctor
ate in education from Stanford.
Many seniors were not familiar with Toledo
until Tuesday when they learned of his selection,
contributing to the muted reaction.
One senior commented, "Before today, could
anyone have named the president of Peru or said
what's going on in that country?"
Though many said Toledo is not
a bad choice, several seniors admit
ted that they had other speakers in
mind who they would have pre
ferred.
"He has the credentials, but we
took him because we could get
him," said senior Vamsi Adusiniilli,
referring to the tact that Toledo is a
Stanford graduate. Adusimilli's lirst
choice was late night talk show host
Conan O'Brien. "He'd be funny
and memorable, but 1 can under
stand why some people wouldn't
want someone from pop culture.

But [Toledo] is just taking the easy
way out."
Many shared Adusimilli's desire
to have a more mainstream speaker.
Toledo was competing against the
Dalai Luna, former President Hill
Clinton, and former South African
President Nelson Mandela, just to
name a few.
"1 le's an international figure but
not a key player in the international
arena right now," said senior Cieeti
ka Agrawal, who is not disappointed
at the choice but would have pre
ferred someone more controversial.
"lie's a better choice than Con
doleezza Rice because he is not a
professor here and isn't someone
you'd be able to hear normally."
There were enthusiasts for Tole

do, including senior Henry Tows
ner.
"He's a Stanford alum, he's the
president of Peru — what more
could you ask?" Towsner said, re
sponding to his peers' desire to have
someone more controversial send
them off in June.
The most fervent opposition to
Toledo's selection has come from
those familiar with Peruvian politics
and disapprove of the way Toledo
has handled the presidency.
"A commencement speaker
should be someone we look up to
and admire tor his achievements,"
said senior Qi Zhai. "Toledo hasn't
proved himself in world politics with
amazing feats, and his personal
scandals — him refusing to recog

nize his illegitimate daughter for
years and then finally admitting it
over the summer this year — taint
his public image."
Toledo has faced his share of
controversy in Peru — after being
narrowly elected in 2001, his ap
proval rating of 60 percent plum
meted to below 20 percent. Within
his country, he faces accusations of
not living up to campaign promises
to improve education, housing and
hunger.
Despite mild disappointment
that, as one senior put it, no one
"cooler" was chosen, most seniors
said they are looking forward to
Toledo's speech on graduation and
added that he is well qualified for
the job.
