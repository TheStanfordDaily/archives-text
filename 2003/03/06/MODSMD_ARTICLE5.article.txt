# Students skip class, rally for peace
## 
### VAUHINI VARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hundreds of protesters took to the
Quad instead of the classroom yester
day in Stanford's first student strike
since the Vietnam War and its largest
anti-war rally in several years. By
holding the event, entitled "Books
Not Bombs," Stanford joined '260
other campuses across the country in
rallying against a pre-emptive war in
Iraq.
Organizers estimated that 1,000 stu
dents attended the event during the
day — many with green bands wrapped
around their arms to express solidarity
against a war.
"Are you ready to strike?" senior
Angad Bhalla shouted from the steps of
the Clock Tower at 10 a.m., as class
hound students attempted to navigate
through the throng of raised fists and
sandwich boards.
"Damn right!" yelled back the crowd.
They then marched around Meyer
Library, past Encina Hall, between
Memorial Auditorium and the Hoover
Institution and, finally, through the east
entrance of the Main Quad, where orga
nizers had draped cloth banners painted
with anti-war slogans.
"Cowboy culture kills," declared a
sandwich board that sat in the middle of
the Quad.
"Silence = violence," read another.
The Coalition of Students Against
War, an umbrella alliance of more than
25 campus groups, began organizing the
strike just a week and a half ago after
being contacted by a national organiza

tion, the National Youth cSL* Student
Peace Coalition.
'It wasn't at all the ordinary crowd'
By yesterday morning, the Stanford
coalition had transformed the usually
quiet Quad into a sort of alternative
classroom.
Colorful anti-war signs lined the
courtyard. Tables were stacked with
paper and envelopes for students to
use to write letters to National Security
Advisor and former University Provost
Coridoleezza Rice. American flags were
spray-painted in orange — a subver
sion of the color used by the govern
ment as a "high-risk" terror alert.

By 11 a.m., students had arranged
themselves in five groups around the
Quad to hear professors speak on such
topics as the regional repercussions of
war, the biological evolution of aggres
sion and the possible domestic backlash
against minorities.
"I've never seen anything like this,"
said senior Meghana Reddy, who has
helped organize nearly 40 rallies at Stan
ford. "It's incredible — it wasn't at all the
ordinary crowd."
A handful of protesters were several
years younger than the typical Stanford

student. After reading about the
strike in the newspaper, a group
of approximately 20 students
from Jordan Middle School in
Palo Alto walked out of class and
trekked down El Carnino for 30
minutes before arriving in the
Quad.
The school's administrators
had made an announcement in
the morning prohibiting students
from leaving campus, said
Stephanie Kenny, an eighth
grader.
"They came to talk to us, saying
they wanted to support peace, and
they seemed really sincere — but
then they told us that they wanted
us to go to the gym to make
posters," she said. .
Instead, the students staged
their own strike and left campus.
"I'm not doing it to get out of
school," Kenny said. "I'm doing it
to support peace. It sends a
stronger message when we come
out to join a diverse group of peo
ple."
Freshman Linda Tran agreed.
"I think it's about time that our
school starts waking up," she said.
"What can students do? They can
let their voices be heard."
University President John I len
nessy was among the attendees
who expressed uneasiness with the
impending war.
"Personally, as an individual,
I'm still not convinced that war is
the right strategy," he said.
'This is the reason you go to college'
The University had previously
said that the strike could not take
plat e in the Quad, out of concern
that the noise would disturb ( lasses
and an Ash Wednesday service in
Memorial Church.
But Hennessy said the organiz
ers were behaving in a respectful

way and that he supported the de
cision of some students to miss
class to attend the rally.
"There's a feeling of growing
momentum regarding this war
and a feeling by a lot of students
that they don't understand the is
sues," he said. "All of us have a lim
ited ability to do anything, but if in
good conscience, you reach the de
cision that this is a mistake, you
have an obligation to make your
voice known."
Hennessy recalled protesting
the Vietnam War in his youth.
"All of us had friends who were
drafted, who were injured or
killed," he said. "That was a very
long, drawn-out conflict, and the
goal of the war became more un
certain as time passed."
Some professors questioned the
United States' objectives in the an
ticipated war with Iraq.
"When you're dealing with
some of the largest oil fields in (he
world and when two of the world's
powers want that oil, it is about
oil," said Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl in a lecture titled "Oil
and the War in Iraq."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy discussed what he felt
were the most persuasive — and
unpersuasive — arguments against
the war.
()ne of the most compelling rea
sons not to go to war, he said, is the
risk of deepening resentment of
the United States in the Middle
East.
"I can imagine Osama bin
Laden rubbing his hands in glee at
this moment, saying, 'Thank you,
George W. Rush, for doing my re
cruitment for me,'" he said.
However, Abernethy said he
does not agree with the premise of
the student strike, titled "Books
Not Bombs."
"It implies that we should do
one thing and not the other," he
said. "Any president must deal
with domestic and foreign prob
lems."
Sophomore Sumeeta Varma

appreciated the opportunity to
learn about the war, hut said that
she felt uncomfortable with the
protest's rhetoric of "reclaiming
our education" by skipping
classes.
"I don't think the University
has done a poor job in educating
us," she said. "I'm attending the
protest without missing any classes
today. I think that's definitely pos
sible and it's a reasonable bal
ance."
Junior Michael Hipolito, on
the other hand, said that he
found little motivation to attend
the rally at all.
"I think it's great that a lot of
people have strong opinions on
this, but I myself just don't really
have an interest," he said.
"Sometimes, I feel like there are
enough people doing it that 1
don't need to."
Hipolito's biology professor was
one of at least 26 professors who
canceled c lasses yesterday. Hipoli

to, who considers himself "apoliti
cal," chose to sleep in.
As Hipolito stood in the Quad,
he was stopped by a friend.
"What's going on?" asked his
friend.
"Protest," Hipolito said.
"Against what?"
"The war."
"What war?" the friend
quipped, then hiked away.
Meanwhile, about 400 students
filled the center of the Quad, lis
tening to Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo speak at a podium.
One of those students, junior
Ami Shah, stayed at the protest
nearly all afternoon. This was the
first anti-war rally she had ever at
tended.
"We're young and we have the
time and energy for this," she
said. "This is what you imagine
when you're ending high school
and getting ready to move on.
This is the reason you go to col
lege."

since the Vietnam War and its largest
anti-war rally in several years. By
holding the event, entitled "Books
Not Bombs," Stanford joined '260
other campuses across the country in
rallying against a pre-emptive war in
Iraq.
Organizers estimated that 1,000 stu
dents attended the event during the
day — many with green bands wrapped
around their arms to express solidarity
against a war.
"Are you ready to strike?" senior
Angad Bhalla shouted from the steps of
the Clock Tower at 10 a.m., as class
hound students attempted to navigate
through the throng of raised fists and
sandwich boards.
"Damn right!" yelled back the crowd.
They then marched around Meyer
Library, past Encina Hall, between
Memorial Auditorium and the Hoover
Institution and, finally, through the east
entrance of the Main Quad, where orga
nizers had draped cloth banners painted
with anti-war slogans.
"Cowboy culture kills," declared a
sandwich board that sat in the middle of
the Quad.
"Silence = violence," read another.
The Coalition of Students Against
War, an umbrella alliance of more than
25 campus groups, began organizing the
strike just a week and a half ago after
being contacted by a national organiza

tion, the National Youth cSL* Student
Peace Coalition.
'It wasn't at all the ordinary crowd'
By yesterday morning, the Stanford
coalition had transformed the usually
quiet Quad into a sort of alternative
classroom.
Colorful anti-war signs lined the
courtyard. Tables were stacked with
paper and envelopes for students to
use to write letters to National Security
Advisor and former University Provost
Coridoleezza Rice. American flags were
spray-painted in orange — a subver
sion of the color used by the govern
ment as a "high-risk" terror alert.

By 11 a.m., students had arranged
themselves in five groups around the
Quad to hear professors speak on such
topics as the regional repercussions of
war, the biological evolution of aggres
sion and the possible domestic backlash
against minorities.
"I've never seen anything like this,"
said senior Meghana Reddy, who has
helped organize nearly 40 rallies at Stan
ford. "It's incredible — it wasn't at all the
ordinary crowd."
A handful of protesters were several
years younger than the typical Stanford

student. After reading about the
strike in the newspaper, a group
of approximately 20 students
from Jordan Middle School in
Palo Alto walked out of class and
trekked down El Carnino for 30
minutes before arriving in the
Quad.
The school's administrators
had made an announcement in
the morning prohibiting students
from leaving campus, said
Stephanie Kenny, an eighth
grader.
"They came to talk to us, saying
they wanted to support peace, and
they seemed really sincere — but
then they told us that they wanted
us to go to the gym to make
posters," she said. .
Instead, the students staged
their own strike and left campus.
"I'm not doing it to get out of
school," Kenny said. "I'm doing it
to support peace. It sends a
stronger message when we come
out to join a diverse group of peo
ple."
Freshman Linda Tran agreed.
"I think it's about time that our
school starts waking up," she said.
"What can students do? They can
let their voices be heard."
University President John I len
nessy was among the attendees
who expressed uneasiness with the
impending war.
"Personally, as an individual,
I'm still not convinced that war is
the right strategy," he said.
'This is the reason you go to college'
The University had previously
said that the strike could not take
plat e in the Quad, out of concern
that the noise would disturb ( lasses
and an Ash Wednesday service in
Memorial Church.
But Hennessy said the organiz
ers were behaving in a respectful

way and that he supported the de
cision of some students to miss
class to attend the rally.
"There's a feeling of growing
momentum regarding this war
and a feeling by a lot of students
that they don't understand the is
sues," he said. "All of us have a lim
ited ability to do anything, but if in
good conscience, you reach the de
cision that this is a mistake, you
have an obligation to make your
voice known."
Hennessy recalled protesting
the Vietnam War in his youth.
"All of us had friends who were
drafted, who were injured or
killed," he said. "That was a very
long, drawn-out conflict, and the
goal of the war became more un
certain as time passed."
Some professors questioned the
United States' objectives in the an
ticipated war with Iraq.
"When you're dealing with
some of the largest oil fields in (he
world and when two of the world's
powers want that oil, it is about
oil," said Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl in a lecture titled "Oil
and the War in Iraq."
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy discussed what he felt
were the most persuasive — and
unpersuasive — arguments against
the war.
()ne of the most compelling rea
sons not to go to war, he said, is the
risk of deepening resentment of
the United States in the Middle
East.
"I can imagine Osama bin
Laden rubbing his hands in glee at
this moment, saying, 'Thank you,
George W. Rush, for doing my re
cruitment for me,'" he said.
However, Abernethy said he
does not agree with the premise of
the student strike, titled "Books
Not Bombs."
"It implies that we should do
one thing and not the other," he
said. "Any president must deal
with domestic and foreign prob
lems."
Sophomore Sumeeta Varma

appreciated the opportunity to
learn about the war, hut said that
she felt uncomfortable with the
protest's rhetoric of "reclaiming
our education" by skipping
classes.
"I don't think the University
has done a poor job in educating
us," she said. "I'm attending the
protest without missing any classes
today. I think that's definitely pos
sible and it's a reasonable bal
ance."
Junior Michael Hipolito, on
the other hand, said that he
found little motivation to attend
the rally at all.
"I think it's great that a lot of
people have strong opinions on
this, but I myself just don't really
have an interest," he said.
"Sometimes, I feel like there are
enough people doing it that 1
don't need to."
Hipolito's biology professor was
one of at least 26 professors who
canceled c lasses yesterday. Hipoli

to, who considers himself "apoliti
cal," chose to sleep in.
As Hipolito stood in the Quad,
he was stopped by a friend.
"What's going on?" asked his
friend.
"Protest," Hipolito said.
"Against what?"
"The war."
"What war?" the friend
quipped, then hiked away.
Meanwhile, about 400 students
filled the center of the Quad, lis
tening to Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo speak at a podium.
One of those students, junior
Ami Shah, stayed at the protest
nearly all afternoon. This was the
first anti-war rally she had ever at
tended.
"We're young and we have the
time and energy for this," she
said. "This is what you imagine
when you're ending high school
and getting ready to move on.
This is the reason you go to col
lege."

Quad instead of the classroom yester
