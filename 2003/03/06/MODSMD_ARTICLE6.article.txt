### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
An interim report addressing
space needs for student organizations
was released this week by the Student
Activity Space Task Force. The task
force, which met bi-weekly from
April 2002 to January 2003, has ex
plored how to develop a more central
and active core for student events
which could link activities taking

plate in the residences and other lo
cations.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni created the group,
comprised of students, staff and ad
ministators, last year to assess campus
renovation opportunities.
"All the students I talked to when I
got here had stories about lack of
space for their meeting, programming
and rehearsal needs," Awakuni said in
a press release. "[The report will] give
us a roadmap that could guide student
space planning for the next decade."
The report, based on a survey of all
campus space needs, outlines a plan to
accommodate future events and activ
ities. The study also evaluates which

functions need to be centrally located,
as opposed to events that could be
hosted in residences or off campus.
"The activities that comprise cam
pus life help to create a dynamic en
ergy that enriches students' lives and
provides the benefit to the entire
University community," Awakuni
said. "VVe hope to ensure that Stan
ford will provide the best possible en
vironment in which student activities
can grow and prosper."
The report recommends several
key renovation projects to improve fa
cilities that typically host student activ
ities. Possible additions to Old Union,
