# Group reports on Univ. space allocation
## Task force finishes survey of student space needs, develops preliminary plan 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
An interim report addressing
space needs for student organizations
was released this week by the Student
Activity Space Task Force. The task
force, which met bi-weekly from
April 2002 to January 2003, has ex
plored how to develop a more central
and active core for student events
which could link activities taking

plate in the residences and other lo
cations.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni created the group,
comprised of students, staff and ad
ministators, last year to assess campus
renovation opportunities.
"All the students I talked to when I
got here had stories about lack of
space for their meeting, programming
and rehearsal needs," Awakuni said in
a press release. "[The report will] give
us a roadmap that could guide student
space planning for the next decade."
The report, based on a survey of all
campus space needs, outlines a plan to
accommodate future events and activ
ities. The study also evaluates which

functions need to be centrally located,
as opposed to events that could be
hosted in residences or off campus.
"The activities that comprise cam
pus life help to create a dynamic en
ergy that enriches students' lives and
provides the benefit to the entire
University community," Awakuni
said. "VVe hope to ensure that Stan
ford will provide the best possible en
vironment in which student activities
can grow and prosper."
The report recommends several
key renovation projects to improve fa
cilities that typically host student activ
ities. Possible additions to Old Union,
The Nitery and Clubhouse and
theStorke Publications Building
are under consideration, as well
as improvements to Tresidder
Memorial Union.
The report also broached the
issue of White Plaza, which
serves as both a major campus
crossroads and a town square,
often forcing pedestrians and
rally groups to dodge heavy bi
cycle traffic.
In addition to structural im
provements, the task force plans
to reevalute the variety of activi
ties hosted at different campus
locations, as well as student
group subsidies, space sharing
and the process used for sched
uling space and events.
One of the group's more con
troversial recommendations is to
put a hold on the construction of
the anticipated graduate stu
dent community center.
In formulating future plans,
the task force had to consider
the University's financial limita
tions and the tight regulations
placed on the construction of
new campus buildings by the
General Use Permit.
"It was a really positive

process," graduate student and
task force member Eric Allison
said. "The great thing about the
group was we all tried to put
aside our own agendas and work
as a group — take a higher-level
view of how things would impact
the campus at large."
The report will be reviewed by
both students and University offi
cials and discussed by staff mem
bers from the departments of
Capital Planning and Project
Management and Student Affairs.
Campus community centers,
the Office of Religious Life and
student publications will also be
consulted before final decisions
are made.
Formal focus groups and pro
gram analysis will be developed
in the near future to determine a
more specific plan of action.
The task force will continue
to meet through the end of the
academic year to advise the
administration on the pro
ject's priorities.
Awakuni said, "This effort
speaks well of the commitment
of students, faculty, staff and
administrators, working with
the campus architect and plan
ning offices to come up with a
master plan for student space
that will serve the University
and students well for years to
come."
