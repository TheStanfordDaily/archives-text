# After breaking into hip-hop, two alums are...
## Record makers 
### RANDY DEVAUL 
Brian Rikuda and Chane Mor
row never imagined that they
would be spending their evenings
performing, going on tour, pro
moting their label and recording
in a studio. But only a few years
out of college, Rikuda and Mor
row, who graduated from Stan
ford in 2000 and 2001, respec
tively, have started to make a
name for themselves in the hip
hop industry.
The Stanford graduates have
taken an alternative path to suc
cess, with plans to take over and be
come heavy-hitters in the hip-hop
arena — demonstrating to Stan
f< >rd students that ch< x>sing a maj< >r
does not cast your future in stone.
The two are back on campus
today at 8 p.m. at the Col lo for the
first stop on the "Ist of a Dying
Breed" tour, running from March
6 through March 31. The tour will
hit numerous locations, including
(Hub Q's in Palo Alto and clubs in
Santa (Mara, San Jose and Los An
geles. p| 112 anner, Tha Gamblaz

and Colossal Connection are also
slated to perform.
Ten months ago, Rikuda and
Morrow co-founded Conduit En
tertainment, an independent hip
hop record label. Rikuda current
ly serves as chief executive officer
of the company, while Morrow
performs under the name of
Epiphany, the label's first artist.
Although the duo is well on
their way now, music was not al
ways at their focus. Rikuda gradu
ated with degrees in economics
and political s< ience and said that
his academic career at Stanford
started off no different from that
of any other college freshman.
I he 24-year old Oakland native
was initially undecided as to what
he wanted to pursue at Stanford.
Junior year marked the period
of transition for Rikuda, who be
came interested in business devel
opment on the corporate level.
After interning at C Charles Schwab
as a marketing consultant, Rikuda
held a full-time job at Loud (-loud,
an Internet start-up company. As
the economy began a downturn,
Rikuda's interest began to take a
different form.
"There were not a lot of attrac
tive jobs and the economy was suf
fering, so I learned that if I was
going to work a nine to live, then it
would have to be something that 1
loved doing," Rikuda said.
After meeting Morrow, who
had moved to New York to learn
about the music industry, Rikuda
pondered what it would take to
form a "viable, profitable business
in hip-hop."
After brainstorming and using
business knowledge that he ac
quired at Stanford and through
past jobs, Rikuda was set to begin
his own business.
"People often want to start a
business, but are unsure about
what they really want to do with it,"
he said. "So, I began to put togeth
er a structure for Conduit."
Alter researching the marketing
and financial aspects of his compa
ny, Rikuda approached Morrow.
Morrow's music epiphany
didn't come until later in his under
graduate career. After graduating
from high school in his hometown
of Pine BlulF, Arkansas, he came to
Stanford with a pre-med focus.
"My mom wanted me to be a
doctor, a pediatrician, and she still
thinks I will someday," he said.
Morrow eventually majored in
mechanical engineering. He wasn't
serious about pursuing music as a ca
reer until his senior year of college.
"I would always mess around
freestyling and writing verses, but
only because it was fun to do," Mor
row said. "I hated performing on
stage and only did like three events
while I was here."
However, he did gain knowl
edge about certain business aspects
at Stanford, and also honed his crit
ical thinking skills.
"I attacked the rap game like a
problem set at first," he said. "With
a problem set, you know it can be
solved, and you know you have the
tools to figure out. I did the same
for rap, surrounding myself with
people, building resources and

gaining the skills to figure out the
hip-hop industry."
It hasn't taken the two king to get
a foot in the hip-hop door. In 10
months, not only has Conduit re
leased Epiphany's first album, but
they have been in high demand a»
clubs in both California and
Arkansas.
"Home Sweet Home," the first
single from the "Ist of a Dying
Breed" album, which is on sale at
Amazon.com, is in heavy rotation on
Arkansas' top radio station. The tour
is in full swing, Epiphany has per
lonned numerous times at Arkansas
convention centers, and there are
more releases on the way, including
a second Epiphany album and a
compilation featuring Juvenile, JT
the Bigga Kigga and other marquee
artists in hip-hop. The label has also
signed another hip-hop group from
Arkansas named Suga City.
"Right now, Conduit is in its
gl owing period," Rikuda said. "But
with the strong momentum that we
have built, we are looking towards
international distribution, distribut
ing to smaller labels, and becoming
major figures in the industry . .. No
one is going to out-work us."
Both Rikuda and Morrow hope
to leave their mark on hip-hop. Mor
row said that the name for the album
comes from his desire to separate
himself from the rest ofthe industry.
The two have already distin
guished themselves by venturing
into territory unexplored by most
Stanford graduates. However, they
have faced challenges.
"People looked down on us at
first, doubting us," Rikuda said.
"1 had to explain to my mother
the lull deal for four hours," Mor
row said. "At first, it took a minute
for her to realize what I was saying,
but now my parents are my biggest
supporters."
The duo hopes to show that
music is a plausible career option
alter leaving Stanford, making a
tangible connection between Stan
lord and hip-hop.
"It feels weird [to be back on
campus]," Morrow said. "For four
years, 1 associated Stanford with
academics only, so it's home to a dif
ferent aspect of my life. Stanford is
a different place, almost surreal. It
i.s nostalgic being back, and I look
forward to performing in front of a
lot of people I know."

for her to realize what I was saying,
but now my parents are my biggest
supporters."
The duo hopes to show that
music is a plausible career option
alter leaving Stanford, making a
tangible connection between Stan
lord and hip-hop.
"It feels weird [to be back on
campus]," Morrow said. "For four
years, 1 associated Stanford with
academics only, so it's home to a dif
ferent aspect of my life. Stanford is
a different place, almost surreal. It
i.s nostalgic being back, and I look
forward to performing in front of a
lot of people I know."
Brian Rikuda and Chane Mor
row never imagined that they
would be spending their evenings
performing, going on tour, pro
moting their label and recording
in a studio. But only a few years
out of college, Rikuda and Mor
row, who graduated from Stan
ford in 2000 and 2001, respec
tively, have started to make a
name for themselves in the hip
hop industry.
The Stanford graduates have
taken an alternative path to suc
cess, with plans to take over and be
come heavy-hitters in the hip-hop
arena — demonstrating to Stan
f< >rd students that ch< x>sing a maj< >r
does not cast your future in stone.
The two are back on campus
today at 8 p.m. at the Col lo for the
first stop on the "Ist of a Dying
Breed" tour, running from March
6 through March 31. The tour will
hit numerous locations, including
(Hub Q's in Palo Alto and clubs in
Santa (Mara, San Jose and Los An
geles. p| 112 anner, Tha Gamblaz

and Colossal Connection are also
slated to perform.
Ten months ago, Rikuda and
Morrow co-founded Conduit En
tertainment, an independent hip
hop record label. Rikuda current
ly serves as chief executive officer
of the company, while Morrow
performs under the name of
Epiphany, the label's first artist.
Although the duo is well on
their way now, music was not al
ways at their focus. Rikuda gradu
ated with degrees in economics
and political s< ience and said that
his academic career at Stanford
started off no different from that
of any other college freshman.
I he 24-year old Oakland native
was initially undecided as to what
he wanted to pursue at Stanford.
Junior year marked the period
of transition for Rikuda, who be
came interested in business devel
opment on the corporate level.
After interning at C Charles Schwab
as a marketing consultant, Rikuda
held a full-time job at Loud (-loud,
an Internet start-up company. As
the economy began a downturn,
Rikuda's interest began to take a
different form.
"There were not a lot of attrac
tive jobs and the economy was suf
fering, so I learned that if I was
going to work a nine to live, then it
would have to be something that 1
loved doing," Rikuda said.
After meeting Morrow, who
had moved to New York to learn
about the music industry, Rikuda
pondered what it would take to
form a "viable, profitable business
in hip-hop."
After brainstorming and using
business knowledge that he ac
quired at Stanford and through
past jobs, Rikuda was set to begin
his own business.
"People often want to start a
business, but are unsure about
what they really want to do with it,"
he said. "So, I began to put togeth
er a structure for Conduit."
Alter researching the marketing
and financial aspects of his compa
ny, Rikuda approached Morrow.
Morrow's music epiphany
didn't come until later in his under
graduate career. After graduating
from high school in his hometown
of Pine BlulF, Arkansas, he came to
Stanford with a pre-med focus.
"My mom wanted me to be a
doctor, a pediatrician, and she still
thinks I will someday," he said.
Morrow eventually majored in
mechanical engineering. He wasn't
serious about pursuing music as a ca
reer until his senior year of college.
"I would always mess around
freestyling and writing verses, but
only because it was fun to do," Mor
row said. "I hated performing on
stage and only did like three events
while I was here."
However, he did gain knowl
edge about certain business aspects
at Stanford, and also honed his crit
ical thinking skills.
"I attacked the rap game like a
problem set at first," he said. "With
a problem set, you know it can be
solved, and you know you have the
tools to figure out. I did the same
for rap, surrounding myself with
people, building resources and

gaining the skills to figure out the
hip-hop industry."
It hasn't taken the two king to get
a foot in the hip-hop door. In 10
months, not only has Conduit re
leased Epiphany's first album, but
they have been in high demand a»
clubs in both California and
Arkansas.
"Home Sweet Home," the first
single from the "Ist of a Dying
Breed" album, which is on sale at
Amazon.com, is in heavy rotation on
Arkansas' top radio station. The tour
is in full swing, Epiphany has per
lonned numerous times at Arkansas
convention centers, and there are
more releases on the way, including
a second Epiphany album and a
compilation featuring Juvenile, JT
the Bigga Kigga and other marquee
artists in hip-hop. The label has also
signed another hip-hop group from
Arkansas named Suga City.
"Right now, Conduit is in its
gl owing period," Rikuda said. "But
with the strong momentum that we
have built, we are looking towards
international distribution, distribut
ing to smaller labels, and becoming
major figures in the industry . .. No
one is going to out-work us."
Both Rikuda and Morrow hope
to leave their mark on hip-hop. Mor
row said that the name for the album
comes from his desire to separate
himself from the rest ofthe industry.
The two have already distin
guished themselves by venturing
into territory unexplored by most
Stanford graduates. However, they
have faced challenges.
"People looked down on us at
first, doubting us," Rikuda said.
"1 had to explain to my mother
the lull deal for four hours," Mor
row said. "At first, it took a minute
for her to realize what I was saying,
but now my parents are my biggest
supporters."
