## Bush tells allies war imminent 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Edging toward war,
President Bush called on skeptical allies last night to
stand ready to use force against Iraq but said the
United States was prepared to act on its own.
"We really don't need anybody's permission,"
Bush said.
In a prime-time news conference, he said a critical
Security Council vote on a resolution authorizing war
was just "days away" and said he would push for a vote
on the measure even if it appeared destined to fail.
"It's time for people to show their cards and let
people know where they stand," the president said.
In measured tones, Bush answered questions for
about 30 minutes after a 10-minute opening state
ment that called Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
claims of disarmament a "willful charade." He said
Saddam has ordered production of illicit missiles
even as he destroys others, accused Iraqi officials of
shuttling biological and chemical agents between se
cret locations and said Iraqi scientists are required to
wear concealed recording devices while being inter
viewed by U.N. inspectors.
He pointedly challenged France, Germany and
other skeptical allies to stand with him.
"If the world fails to confront the threat posed by
the Iraqi regime, refusing to use force even as a last
resort, free nations would assume immense and un
acceptable risks," he said.
The news conference was part of an intensifying
campaign to prepare Americans for the possibility of
a war that could be just days away. Military leaders say
U.S. forces are now ready to strike Iraq.
Bush shrugged off the protests of millions world
wide and chided critics who want to give for U.N.
weapons inspectors more time to do their work.
"A little bit more time? Saddam Hussein has had
12 years to disarm," he said.
Dramatically raising his right hand, the president
said that he had swore to defend the Constitution and
protect America's security. "That's exactly what I am
going to do," he said.
