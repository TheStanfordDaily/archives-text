OXFORD —Food can be a
useful way to understand British
politics. Great Britain features the
ingenious invention of handy
traveling food stands called kebab
vans. They are open until 3 a.m.

sell all kinds of food. Any time of
day and almost without fail, you
can count on a line of five or 10
people at the kebab van, perusing
the comprehensive menu and try
ing to decide what they want.
1 low to decide between chips
and beans, chips and cheese, a
lamb kebab, a hamburger or a
fried egg? Simple: Ask your friend.
It's too much responsibility to
make a decision that has such
repercussions for the remainder of
your gastrointestinal night.
Politically, there aren't nearly as
many choices available here as
there are at the kebab vans. At
least, one might argue that after
witnessing the most recent flip
flop in the House of Commons.
Last week, the British Parliament
did a most extraordinary thing. The
Labor Party — the ruling party —
initiated a vote of no confidence
against Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The results of the no-confi
dence vote illustrated an interest

ing development in (he British
Parliament — ifc seems to be a mini
resurgence of conservatism. Blair
defeated the no-confidence vote
by a wide margin, but his comfort
able victory occurred not because
he enjoys more support than was
expected within his Labor Party. It
occurred because of surprising
Conservative Party votes.
Many in the Conservative Party
saw the vote as a referendum on
war with Iraq, but one cannot
avoid the strange analogies that
the vote brings up. Britain's Parlia
mentary uproar last week is similar
to what might occur if, say, the De
mocrats were instrumental in vot
ing down a motion to impeach
Speaker of the House Dennis
Hasten, a Republican.
Indeed, the only people whom
Blair seems to alienate on a consis
tent basis are the die-hard anti-war
members of Parliament, who do
not make up a significant voting
bloc — despite the fact that anti
war demonstrations in London
did draw 2 million people last
month. On Feb. 26, well after the
demonstrations, only 199 mem
bers of Parliament voted that there
was insufficient evidence for at
tacking Iraq; 393 said the evidence
justified an attack.
Many students at Oxford natu
rally see this drift toward a com
mon national policy — with a pro
war majority and blurred distinc
tions between Conservatives and
Labor — as a turn toward conser
vatism. Some students argue that
with a conservative consensus will
come all sorts of evils. But ask an
Oxford student where to go if you

want to be a neo-hippie, to have a
good time and think about bo
hemian stuff, and you get the same
sort of reaction you might see if
you ask a Stanford student where
is the best dorm for authentic Fi
jian cuisine. You just don't find
many liberal spots around this
"bastion of conservatism," as one
ideologically frustrated Oxford
student termed this hallowed
British institution.
There are a lew students here
who are enraged about the possi
ble war with Iraq. Generally, stu
dents wish that Britain stood apart
from the United States a little
more, but they acknowledge that
America is the pre-eminent world
power and that it is impossible to
extricate themselves from Ameri
can dominance.
Typical Oxford students ar
gued mildly hawkish positions.
"Better we attack them now than
risk facing a nuclear-armed Iraq in
the future," said one student.
"If Blair can get another U.N.
resolution passed against Iraq, then
let's go for it," argued another.
But once they get these senti
ments out of their system — and
this normally happens pretty
quickly — students are once
again primed to talk about soccer,
the three papers they have com
ing due or their romantic lives.
Theii prime minister just
stood down a vote of no confi
dence, but that is not common
discussion around Britain.
Maybe Americans don't listen
hard enough, but all in all, the
British are not too different
from us.
