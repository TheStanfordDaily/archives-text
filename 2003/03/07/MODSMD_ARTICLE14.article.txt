### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Air Force Sec
retary James Roche said yesterday that the
service needs to move quickly to fix a cli
mate that has led to at least 54 alleged
cases of rape and sexual assault at the Air
Force Academy.
"We have cadets who have misused
power, that have done things we cannot
tolerate," Roche said. "We have to deal with
a climate that has allowed this to happen."
Investigators who spent two weeks at
the academy in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
identified 54 cases and met with at least six
alleged victims, although there are proba
bly many more who will not come for

ward, Roche saicl.
"What frightens me most is the climate
that has affected so many others who have
not come forward," he said. "While we
have seen, whatever the number is, 25,50,
there are probably a hundred more that
we do not see."
Roche did not say during what time pe
riod the alleged assaults occurred. I low
ever, Cari Davis, executive director of
TESSA, the main women's crisis center in
Colorado Springs, said her group had
dealt with 22 sexual assault complaints in
volving cadets over the past 15 years.
Roche said cases are being prioritized

for follow-up by the Defense Department's
inspector general, focusing efforts on cases
"where the person who placed the accusa
tion felt the system let them down."
Sen. Wayne Allan!, R-Colo., said the
situation at the academy is worse than the
Navy's 1991 Tailhook scandal — when
dozens of women complained they were
groped or assaulted by drunken pilots at
a Navy booster group's convention — be
cause the system let down the victims in
these cases.
"The entire support and legal system at
the academy appears to have failed," Al
lan! said.
