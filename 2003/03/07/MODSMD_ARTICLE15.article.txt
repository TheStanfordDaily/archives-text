## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Toledo a suitable choice 
### 
Come June 15, more than 20,000
Stanford students, faculty, par
ents and alumni will be inspired
by the words of a man who
fought poverty, corruption and ignorance
against all odds— and won. Peruvian
President Alejandro Toledo is a fitting
choice for this year's Commencement ad
dress.
Toledo might not be a household
name, but he embodies a living repre
sentation of what self-determination,
perseverance and a Stanford education
can achieve. The son of a poor brick
layer, he became the first member of
his family to complete high school and
later college, entering UC-San Francis
co on a partial athletic scholarship and
leaving with a degree and sky-high am
bitions.
He later earned three degrees from
Stanford — two of them in education —
and will likely tell the Class 0f2003 about
the necessity and value of learning.
Toledo is a timely choice for Com
mencement speaker because of the cur
rent state of international affairs. His sta
tus as a political leader in South America
proves especially significant, considering
the United States' increasingly crucial re
lationship with its neighbors. In addition,

many Stanford students choose to spend
time studying in Latin America and the
University boasts a large population of
Latin American graduate students,
adding increased importance to Toledo's
visit. As developing and established coun
tries alike forge stronger economic and
political networks in the coming years,
Stanford graduates should be interested
in learning about global perspectives such
that Toledo holds.
Most importantly, many students
want Toledo to speak here. In contrast to
the previous two years' speakers, whose
business and political achievements
sparked controversy among graduates,
Toledo's story is one that students seem
eager to hear. Last November, a group
of seniors launched an e-mail campaign
to add Toledo's name to the list of nomi
nations. That he not only made the final
list but occupied a top spot speaks well of
the transparency of the Commencement
speaker selection process.
It was while he was at Stanford that
Toledo decided that he wanted to be the
president of Peru. Given his personal
story and his current position, he is just
the person to speak to an ambitious and
hopeful graduating class about the world
that awaits beyond the Farm.
