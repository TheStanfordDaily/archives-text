# 'Moulin Uj' unites campus
## 
### 
This Saturday night Ujamaa
House will host Stanford's only
free, campus-wide formal
event. It won't be just any party
— the variety of activities should attract
students with a wide range of social inter
ests. Students can dance, gamble, listen to
jazz or just hang out. The evening poses a
great opportunity for those who dig for
mals, but are less-than-able to afford the
$80 Viennese Ball variety.
Yet Moulin IJJ isn't just a good idea be
cause it will be fun. It is a great example of
why Stanford has ethnic theme dorms in
the first place: to teach cultural awareness
and to bring the entire community to
gether.
Last year, the New York Civil Rights
Coalition released a controversial report
calling many American colleges and uni
versities "paternalistic" and "segrega
tionist"— criticisms that focused specifi
cally on the existence of ethnic theme
dorms. The report stated, "Many of
these racially based houses make it very

clear in their mission statements that
their goal is racial consciousness and
identity, thus precluding the concept of
a unified campus."
Stanford's ethnic theme dorms have
proven time and time again that just the
opposite is true. Ujamaa, in particular,
makes weekly efforts to run events open
to all students on campus. Moulin Uj is a
large-scale version of Ujamaa's inclusive
philosophy.
It is clear that Moulin Uj's organizers
have made a concerted effort to reach the
entire community. Many students have
been impressed by professional-quality
posters that distinguish this Saturday's
event from normal weekend activities. Be
cause a good deal of cash is needed to ex
ecute a formal, Ujamaa asked for dona
tions from other houses, which means
many students are more involved in the
event's success than they think.
With finals looming, why not make
Moulin Uj part of your pre-Dead Week
partying?
