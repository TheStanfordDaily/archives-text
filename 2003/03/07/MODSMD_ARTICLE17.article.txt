## Student strike oversimplified 
### 
Wednesday's "Books
Not Bombs" strike
was an unprecedent
ed event in my expe
rience at Stanford. Never before
had the student body organized it
self to do anything remotely politi
cal in such a visible and strong way.
Leaving political views behind,
every Stanford affiliate should be
proud that our community has fi
nally woken from its slumber of po
litical apathy.
Unfortunately, it has taken an
extreme and dangerous
situation — an imminent war — to
rally students together.
But I didn't go to sleep yesterday
with total confidence that the huge
coalition of students and faculty,
sponsored by a myriad of student
groups, had gained much strength
in its light against a possible war. I
was worried that there were unex
pected side effects resulting from
the issue of skipping classes.
On the day of the strike, typical
small talk included asking people if
they were going to class. But this
choice — class or no class — was
not really a choice at all, and it over
simplifies the protest situation.
I went to most of my classes on
Wednesday, but the decision had
nothing to do wit h how I feel about
war, Iraq, Saddam Hussein,
Dubya or the U.N. Weapons In
spectors.
I went to class because I had to
and because I wanted to hear what
my professors had to say. Going to
class was not a statement in sup
port of the war. It was a decision
that I made independently of my
political beliefs.
But some students believed that
going to class on Wednesday auto
matically demonstrated support for
the war. For me, this couldn't have
been further from the truth.
Personally, I got more out of my
classes than ever before. One lec
ture was about U.S. decisions to in
tervene in international conflicts.
The other was a seminar on

Afghanistan. How much more
timely could these ( lasses be?
This is not to say that the strike
was held in vain. What the strike
did show was students' ability to
mobilize fora cause. I lowever, this
"cause" is a little unclear.
While some students believed
that professors canceling ( lass was
inappropriate —11 lat it was a way <>112
professors imposing their political

beliefs on their
students— I think
that these profes
sors made a con
scious decision to
cancel their classes
in the name of
learning. By can
celing classes, pro
fessors gave stu-

dents the chance to proactively en
gage in the dialogue at the rally
without having to sacrifice an aspect
of their education.
In reality, skipping class was an
active attack on the University
and, if anything, only a loosely
symbolic attack against the war.
The upcoming war is not being
waged by Stanford University.
This University does not stand for
the war or align itself with the
Bush administration.
At Stanford, there is evidence of
both support and opposition to the
war. While Stanford houses the
Hoover Institution, a conservative
think tank, and has produced such
characters as National Security Ad
viser Condoleezza Rice, we also
employ the many professors that
spoke out at Wednesday's rally.
Examples of these professors in
clude Philip Zimbardo, Joel Beinin
and Robert Sapolsky, among oth
ers. With such diversity of opinion
the University doesn't espouse one
view about the war, making a
strike against oil classes seem un
warranted.
My friend summed up her
reservations about the strike best: "I
want to protest the war, not the
University," she said. In other

words, undermining the University
does not inherently undercut the
war movement. These two realms
are mutually exclusive.
Though simply a coincidence,
the fact that the protest was on Ash
Wednesday made me think about
my Catholic upbringing and how it
related to the situation. During
Lent, practicing Catholics make a
sacrifice in their lives to remind
themselves of the sacrifice Jesus
made in his life.
But Catholics are encouraged
to do something — not withhold
something from their lives —to
show their commitment to their
religion. Giving up candy, while
difficult, is less preferred than vol
unteering during the Lenten peri
od. Doing something is active,
while not doing something is more
passive.
This relates to the anti-war
protest because, in my opinion, the
act of skipping classes carries far less
strength than going to the rally.
The rally was an active sign of
support for the anti-war protest.
Skipping class was more passive
and didn't necessarily prove one's
political stance.
The problem with the situation
on Wednesday was that not every
one could or wanted to skip class. A
rally could have been a lot stronger
if students didn't have to sacrifice
academics in order to show their
disdain for the war.
Students at Stanford should not
give undue meaning to class atten
dance on Wednesday. Students
skip class for many reasons — to go
the beach, to sleep off a hangover,
to finish a paper. Ditching class isn't
something new or radical.
Class attendance, in itself, wasn't
a demonstration of political beliefs
— for many it had nothing to do
with their political slant.
