Strike shows that 'Stanford cannot fully
separate itself' from politics
The Daily's editorial board and the
rest of Stanford's leftist establishment
has allowed liberal bleach to splash into
its eyes and blind it to its own hypocrisy.
In its unflinching anti-war support, The
Daily has abandoned two former stances
which were deemed so important: the
University as an apolitical body and the
importance of student dialogue on con
troversial issues.
Imagine a professor cancelling class
on Good Friday and encouraging stu
dents to attend church and honor Jesus.
This would produce an outcry as (lie
professor would be cancelling class for
religious reasons and pushing personal
beliefs on students. But isn't (his essen
tially what happened during Wednes
day's strike?
Professors cancelled the classes that stu
dents and their parents have paid to at
tend — the only motivation being to foster
support for their political agenda. It is
ironic that the campus left supports Presi
dent Hennessy and a host of professors

and administrators in their political out
spokenness, while chastising Hoover for
its politics. While Zimbardo & Co.'s actions
Wednesday were not a part of official Uni
versity action, the fact that so many classes
were cancelled (without penalty) and so
many of our University's leaders pledged
support means that Stanford cannot fully
separate itself from the political rally. If
The Daily and the left support a Stanford
that is politically neutral, they should call
for this neutrality from both the right and
the left.
Furthermore, The Daily has missed an
opportunity to criticize a portion of the
Stanford community for its inaction. The
campus anti-war events — from rallies to
teach-ins — have consistently been ser
mons rather than dialogues. Wednesday's
rally saw almost no counter-protest, aside
from a few placards that seemed more sar
castic than sincere. But in The Daily's
haste to support the protesters, it forgot
that the dialogue it has so vehemently de
fended was completely missing. Expres
sions of the political views of those sup
potting U.S. policy in the Middle Fast
should be encouraged if»ensure a healthy
dialogue.

Sophomore calls strike 'senseless'
The disruptive anti-war student strike
on Wednesday was as senseless for those
opposed to the war for rational reasons as
it was for those against the war. Still more
senseless were the professors who not only
supported the strike, but cancelled or
moved classes on account of the protest. I
have been pleased to hear that there is al
ready talk of demanding tuition refunds
and even pursuing legal action on t he basis
ofbreach of contract and creating a hostile
learning environment. Both efforts have
my full support.
What 1 cannot understand is the nature
in which this event was reported by The
Daily. In yesterday's story "Students skip
classes, rally for peace," event organizers
stated that there were 1,000 protesters in
attendance, though even a cursory first
hand examination at any given point
would have demonstrated otherwise. The
Daily Californian reported attendance at
about 500; the Washington Post reported
a number probably closer the truth: 300.
That The Daily would not think to
check a statement by event organizers,
who (|uite sensibly have a vested interest
in inflating participation numbers, seems
particularly ill-thought to me.

Taken in tandem with The Daily's edi
torial encouraging students to participate
in the strike — a statement that goes be
yond bias or opinion but is more in the
character of sedition — The Daily has
demonstrated that not only can it not fact
check or reasonably inform, it also cannot
count.

Editor's Note: The Daily's student strike rover
age was coordinated by a team of six Daily re
porters and editors — more than either of the
newspapers cited — who each estimated the size
of the crowd throughout the day. These estimates.
which indicated that in total 1,000 students at
tended the strike, were corroborated try the orga
nizers' counts.

Students should demand tuition refunds
The United States is a free country and
faculty members can voice whatever opin
ion they want outside of class. 1 lowever, it
is irresponsible for them to directly voice
their opinions to their impressionable stu
dents.
Most importantly, if the cancelled (hiss
es are not made up, students have the

light and the obligation to ask for their tu
ition money back tor missed classes. If pro
fessors simply cancel a class based on their
beliefs, they should be placed on adminis
trative leave and held accountable to those
paying tuition for their students. Here's
hoping that some professors act more re
sponsibly.
