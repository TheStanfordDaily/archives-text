## With season heating up, women try to hold court against Arizonas 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Competition will be sizzling at
the Taube Family Tennis Center
this weekend, as a pair of schools
used to the heat venture to the
Farm to battle the No. 3 Stanford
women's tennis team.

Women's Tennis
Today: vs. No. 7 Arizona St., 1:30 p.m.
Saturday: vs. No. 26 Arizona, 12 p.m.

The Cardinal (8-1, 1 -0 Pacific
10 Conference) hosts a tough
two-day, two-match homestand
beginning with a match at 1:30
p.m. today against No. 7 Arizona
State (6-1, 1-0 Pac-10). Stanford
will battle No. 26 Arizona (4-3, 0-
3 Pac-10) on Saturday at noon.
The play may be grueling for
the Cardinal because not only are
both opponents highly skilled, but
Stanford has not played back-to
back matches since the National
Team Indoors early last month.
Nonetheless, the players do not be
lieve their readiness or intensity
will be affected by the proximity of
the play.
"I think that we need to keep
being mentally and physically pre
pared for two hard matches," ju
nior Lauren Barnikow said. "We
are definitely physically ready be
cause we've put in a lot of time on
the track and in the weight room
with our strength and condition
ing coach, Dr. Don Chu.
"But playing two matches in a
row is nothing out of the ordi
nary. We are ready to dominate."
Conditioning will be a factor

this weekend. The Sun Devils
have played well of late, beating
then- No. 9 UCLA, 4-3, in Tempe
two weeks ago.
The Sun Devils feature a bal
anced attack in both singles and
doubles that rivals the depth of
the Cardinal.
The charge will be led by Adria
Engle, a senior three-time /Mi-
American who is ranked No. 21 in
the nation by the ITA.
And, although the Wildcats are
not as highly ranked as Arizona
State, they are no less daunting an
opponent for the Cardinal.
Arizona recently swept a tough
Texas Christian squad, 6-0, in
Texas and has a strong lineup an
chored by Emilie Scribot, No. 46 in
the nation.
The doubles point will again
play a crucial role in the upcoming
matches. The Stanford team of
Barnikow and sophomore Erin
Burdette, ranked No. 1 in the
country, will be looking to re
bound from a tough loss in the
William & Mary match.
Although the Cardinal eventu
ally won that doubles point, it will
look to secure the top doubles
match against the Arizona
schools.
One factor that will definitely
aid Stanford, other than the
home-court advantage, will be the
experience gained from its match
against William & Mary earlier
this week. The Cardinal defeated
the Tribe, ranked No. 11 in the
nation, 5-2 in a mid-week, non
league battle.

Senior catcher R/an Garko's team-leading 22 RBI have been a large part of No. 7 Stanford's re
cent success. The Cardinal has won Bof 10 heading into this weekend's home series against Cal.
"Mentally, we are ready be
cause we had a chance to sharpen
our shots against William and
Mary," Barnikow said.
Both dual matches this week
end will not count towards the
Pac-10 standings, but the Cardi
nal will be hungry for a defeat of
league rivals.
"I think we will make a state
ment if we win with some smart,
solid tennis," Barnikow said. "If
we play well, these teams and
their coaches will talk about our
level of tennis to other teams.
"We make sure we bring a high
level of intensity and focus to the
courts because we know that no
matter what we are ranked every
team wants to beat us just because
we are Stanford. So we make sure
we are prepared to battle every
match."
