Saturday: at Last Chance Qualifier, Seattle

Tomorrow, Washington will host its Last Chance
Qualifier at the Dempsey Indoor, a 300-meter indoor
track facility that has seen some of the best marks in the
world set during this season.
Stanford will host its spring opener for the outdoor
season on Sunday. The meet will allow some Stanford
athletes to begin their season after not participating in
the indoor campaign and others to make their first at
tempts at regional qualifying marks for the outdoor
track championships in June.
With the close of the regular indoor season, the Car
dinal leaves the school record books heavily rewritten,
as seven school records were set and countless other
athletes earned top-10 spots on the all-time lists.
The women's team captured the MPSF Champi
onship over perennial power UCIA The men finished
a close second to UCLA as they sat out some of their top
distance runners to prepare for the postseason.
"In almost all cases we exceeded our expectations
for the indoor season," said Vin Lananna, director of
cross country and track and field.
Possibly the biggest news of the Cardinal's season
was the emergence of the women's sprint squad onto
the national scene with three freshmen posting NCAA
provisional qualifying times in the 60, 200 and 400.
Freshman Jakki Bailey is expected to earn a berth to
the NCAA Championships with her 60-meter dash

In the 200, freshman Ashley Purnell set a school
record of 23.88, which ranks her 23rd in the nation,
while freshman Nashonme Johnson sprinted the 400
in 54.49 to earn second on the all-time Stanford list and
rank 39th in the nation.
The 1,600-meter relay team of Johnson, Purnell,
freshman Chauntae Bayne and sophomore Christine
Moschella also set a school record in 3 minutes, 43.37
seconds.
Junior Lindsay Johnson just missed her own school
record in the 60 hurdles and sophomore Undine
Becker and junior Lilian Bush now rank second and
third on the all-time list.

Redshirt freshman Alicia Craig out-leaned three
time NCAA Champion senior Lauren Fleshman in the
5,000 at the MPSF Championships to set a school
record of 16:05.24, the fifth-fastest time in the nation so
far this year.
In the field events, junior Jessica Pluth broke the
school record in the weight throw with her toss of 61
feet, 11.00 inches, which ranks 28th in the nation.
For the men, senior Milton Little set the school
record in the 60 with a time of 6.88 and also now owns
the No. 2 spot in the long jump with a distance of 24-
