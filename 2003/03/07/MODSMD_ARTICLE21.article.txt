# Card looks to stay strong this weekend
## With Golden Bears in town, Stanford goes for fourth-straight series win 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One look at No. 7 Stanford's opponents the last
two weeks would lead you to believe the Cardinal is
playing the heart of its Pacific-10 Conference sched
ule a month and a half early. You'd be right. And
you'd be wrong.

With Bay Area rival California (11-5) coming to
Sunken Diamond tonight — one week after Stanford
(11-7) hosted Pac-10 foe No. 18 Southern California
— the Cardinal will have faced two of the top three
challengers to its hope of claiming the conference
title by mid-March. But none of the six games will
have counted toward the league standings.
As the teams have structured the schedule since
1999, Stanford plays a non-conference series with
both the Golden Bears and the Trojans in order to
preserve the traditional home-and-home format the
teams enjoyed during the years of the Six-Pac, which
also included Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA.
This year, the Cardinal will play both the USC and
Cal Pac-10 series on the road during the first two
weekends in May.
Regardless of their lack of impact on the league,
the three games this weekend between the Cardinal
and the Bears are pivotal for both clubs.
Stanford enters the series having won eight of its
last 10 games, taking an impres
sive two of three from No. 9
Texas and the Trojans in the
process. A series win over Califor
nia would be the team's fourth
straight, giving the Cardinal a
nic e bit of momentum as it heads
into an off-week followed by a
marquee series in Tempe, Ariz,
against No. 4 Arizona State to
open Pac-10 play.
The Bears won six consecutive
games in early February but have
been less consistent since. Califor
nia's 2003 resume includes a de
feat of No. 14 Nebraska in a Texas
tournament game and one win in
three games against No. 8 Long
Beach State, but the outcome of
this weekend's matchup with
Stanford may be the best indica
tor yet for the Bears ofjust how le
gitimate their run for the confer
ence title will be.
Last season, Stanford won five
of six games between the schools,
including a Pac-10 sweep of the
Bears at Sunken Diamond. Cali
fornia will undoubtedly be itch
ing to take the field against the
Cardinal after last season's re
sults, as well as the cancellation of
its series with Oklahoma State last
weekend due to snow in Stillwa
ter.
Tonight's Stanford starter, ju
nior John Hudgins, took a small
step backward from his early-sea
son brilliance and lost his first
game of the year against USC last
week. He did manage to last six
innings for the sixth time in six
starts this season and added to his
incredible strikeout-to-walk ratio,
now at 42 to four in 42 innings
pitched.
In two starts last season against
California, Hudgins went 2-0
with a 4.50 ERA, almost a point
above his 2003 number thus far.

Junior Matt Brown will take
the hill tonight for former Cardi
nal player and assistant coach
David Esquer's Bears. Brown's
lone loss came by way of an un
earned run against Long Beach
State, but he has achieved just
limited success after entering the
year as a third-team Preseason
All-American.
Tomorrow afternoon, senior
Ryan McCally will match up
against California junior Brian
Montalbo. McCally has lost just
once in five starts and has done a
nice job filling in for injured
starter Tim Cunningham, offi
cially out with a broken pinky
since he injured it after his Feb.
15 start against Florida State.
Cunningham had hoped to re
turn after Stanford's one-week
break for the Arizona State series,
but his status is still uncertain.
Sunday's contest is again a
clash of still-unnamed starters, as
Stanford struggles to find a con
sistent third option while its se
nior lefty sits with injury.
At the plate, freshman John
Mayberry Jr. continues to im
press with his seamless transition
to the collegiate level. Mayberry
has hit safely in 17 of his first 18
games for the Cardinal, including
11 in a row and is batting .355
with three home runs thus far.
Sophomore Danny Putnam
continues to lead Stanford in bat
ting with a .397 average and .707
slugging percentage, belting four
homers and tallying 16 RBI in an
outstanding 2003 campaign.
For the Bears, junior designat
ed hitter Conor Jackson leads the
team with a .423 average but has
just five RBI since returning to
the cleanup spot after injury
forced him out of the team's first
eight games.
Junior Brian Horwitz has
picked up the slack, however,
clubbing five home runs, driving
in 23 runs and batting at a .358
clip this season.

nice job filling in for injured
starter Tim Cunningham, offi
cially out with a broken pinky
since he injured it after his Feb.
15 start against Florida State.
Cunningham had hoped to re
turn after Stanford's one-week
break for the Arizona State series,
but his status is still uncertain.
Sunday's contest is again a
clash of still-unnamed starters, as
Stanford struggles to find a con
sistent third option while its se
nior lefty sits with injury.
At the plate, freshman John
Mayberry Jr. continues to im
press with his seamless transition
to the collegiate level. Mayberry
has hit safely in 17 of his first 18
games for the Cardinal, including
11 in a row and is batting .355
with three home runs thus far.
Sophomore Danny Putnam
continues to lead Stanford in bat
ting with a .397 average and .707
slugging percentage, belting four
homers and tallying 16 RBI in an
outstanding 2003 campaign.
For the Bears, junior designat
ed hitter Conor Jackson leads the
team with a .423 average but has
just five RBI since returning to
the cleanup spot after injury
forced him out of the team's first
eight games.
Junior Brian Horwitz has
picked up the slack, however,
clubbing five home runs, driving
in 23 runs and batting at a .358
clip this season.
One look at No. 7 Stanford's opponents the last
two weeks would lead you to believe the Cardinal is
playing the heart of its Pacific-10 Conference sched
ule a month and a half early. You'd be right. And
you'd be wrong.

With Bay Area rival California (11-5) coming to
Sunken Diamond tonight — one week after Stanford
(11-7) hosted Pac-10 foe No. 18 Southern California
— the Cardinal will have faced two of the top three
challengers to its hope of claiming the conference
title by mid-March. But none of the six games will
have counted toward the league standings.
As the teams have structured the schedule since
1999, Stanford plays a non-conference series with
both the Golden Bears and the Trojans in order to
preserve the traditional home-and-home format the
teams enjoyed during the years of the Six-Pac, which
also included Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA.
This year, the Cardinal will play both the USC and
Cal Pac-10 series on the road during the first two
weekends in May.
Regardless of their lack of impact on the league,
the three games this weekend between the Cardinal
and the Bears are pivotal for both clubs.
Stanford enters the series having won eight of its
last 10 games, taking an impres
sive two of three from No. 9
Texas and the Trojans in the
process. A series win over Califor
nia would be the team's fourth
straight, giving the Cardinal a
nic e bit of momentum as it heads
into an off-week followed by a
marquee series in Tempe, Ariz,
against No. 4 Arizona State to
open Pac-10 play.
The Bears won six consecutive
games in early February but have
been less consistent since. Califor
nia's 2003 resume includes a de
feat of No. 14 Nebraska in a Texas
tournament game and one win in
three games against No. 8 Long
Beach State, but the outcome of
this weekend's matchup with
Stanford may be the best indica
tor yet for the Bears ofjust how le
gitimate their run for the confer
ence title will be.
Last season, Stanford won five
of six games between the schools,
including a Pac-10 sweep of the
Bears at Sunken Diamond. Cali
fornia will undoubtedly be itch
ing to take the field against the
Cardinal after last season's re
sults, as well as the cancellation of
its series with Oklahoma State last
weekend due to snow in Stillwa
ter.
Tonight's Stanford starter, ju
nior John Hudgins, took a small
step backward from his early-sea
son brilliance and lost his first
game of the year against USC last
week. He did manage to last six
innings for the sixth time in six
starts this season and added to his
incredible strikeout-to-walk ratio,
now at 42 to four in 42 innings
pitched.
In two starts last season against
California, Hudgins went 2-0
with a 4.50 ERA, almost a point
above his 2003 number thus far.

Junior Matt Brown will take
the hill tonight for former Cardi
nal player and assistant coach
David Esquer's Bears. Brown's
lone loss came by way of an un
earned run against Long Beach
State, but he has achieved just
limited success after entering the
year as a third-team Preseason
All-American.
Tomorrow afternoon, senior
Ryan McCally will match up
against California junior Brian
Montalbo. McCally has lost just
once in five starts and has done a
nice job filling in for injured
starter Tim Cunningham, offi
cially out with a broken pinky
since he injured it after his Feb.
15 start against Florida State.
Cunningham had hoped to re
turn after Stanford's one-week
break for the Arizona State series,
but his status is still uncertain.
