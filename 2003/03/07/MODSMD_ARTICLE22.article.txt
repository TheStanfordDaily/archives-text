# Rough schedule all part of the plan
## Mens gymnastics endures rough week of training in preparation for big road meets this weekend. 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You might assume a coach
would want to give his athletes a
rest before facing their toughest
competition.
But as part of his long-term
strategy, men's gymnastics coach
Thom Glielmi scheduled the
team's toughest workouts the same
weekend they face top-ranked Ok
lahoma and No. 3 Ohio State in
Oklahoma, and No. 14 Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs.
"We're preparing for NCAAs
and they are having very hard
weeks at this point in their train
ing cycle," Glielmi said. "Last week
and this week have been the
toughest weeks for them."
Junior Dan Gill said the team
has known the training plan all
season long.
"We're training pretty hard,"
Gill said. "This is a pretty tough
week on our bodies, but then we
get a break from competition."
Don't be surprised if the Cardi
nal looks tired when it meets the
two powerhouse teams that fin
ished 1-2 at the NCAA champi
onships last season. C )klahoma and
Ohio State will provide Stanford's
individual national contenders
with their toughest competition of
the regular season.
In fact, Ohio State and Okla
homa currently have 18 current
top-10 individual rankings. Senior
Marshall Erwin, the defending
NCAA rings champion, will face
Oklahoma's Brett Covey, who is
currently the nation's top-ranked
gymnast on the rings.
Gill, the defending NCAA vault
champion, finds himself in a simi
lar situation. Gill will face Okla
homa's Daniel Furney, the coun
try's No. 1 gymnast on the vault.

Stanford.
In 1999, facing elimination at
the Western Regionals at BYU,
Stanford capitalized on a poor
high-bar rotation by a top-ranked
Oklahoma gymnast to upset the
Sooners by mere tenths of a point
on their way to the NCAA champi
onships in Nebraska.
And in last season's final home
meet, Sadao I lamada's last as head
coach, the Cardinal upset an un
defeated and also top-ranked Ok
lahoma squad on the final routine
of the final event — the gymnastics

equivalent of a "buzzer-beater."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
it was unable to duplicate the feat
at the NCAA championships a few
weeks later — in Oklahoma. This
is part of the reason why Glielmi
understands the importance of
training for the long-term.
"It's not about beating those
guys," Glielmi said. "It's about our
guys using the meet to learn to
compete better. When they go out,
their mindset has to be not, 'If I hit,'
but rather, 'How well will I hit?"'
After leaving Norman today,
the Cardinal will stop by Colorado
Springs on Sunday to meet the Air
Force Academy for the second
