# Harrick on thin ice
## 
### 
ATHENS, Ga. (AP) Before
each practice, Jim Harrick
scrawls a message to his players
on a white board next to the
court.
On Thursday, the words
seemed especially relevant:
"Today is the first day of the rest
of your life. Forget the past and
start thinking about the future."
If only it were that easy for
the Georgia coach.
Harrick has had so many
problems in his past that it might
be tough for him to survive the
latest scandal.
He was fired at UCLA for
lying on an expense report.
Rhode Island is looking into al
leged transgressions that oc
curred on Harrick's watch. And
now, he faces the most serious
challenge of his career at Geor
gia.
A former Bulldogs player,
Tony Cole, accused Jim Harrick
Jr. of paying off bills, doing
schoolwork and teaching a sham
class on coaching. Harrick Jr.,
an assistant on his father's staff,
was fired Wednesday.
A day earlier, the elder Har
rick defiantly predicted his son
would be cleared and nothing
more than minor violations
would be uncovered. He also
challenged his portrayal as a
renegade coach who breaks
rules.
"I've never had a violation,"
Harrick said. "Go ask the
NCAA."
On the other hand, he ac
knowledges occasional lapses in
judgment on the recruiting trail.
Desperate fora backup point
guard in 2001, Harrick pushed
hard to get Cole enrolled at
Georgia, even though he had
bounced around to numerous
high schools and junior colleges.
Cole didn't have much im
pact on the court, but he made
plenty of news off it: Midway
through his only season with the

Bulldogs, he was among three
athletes accused in a campus
rape.
While the charges were even
tually dropped, Cole was kicked
oft the basketball team for re
peated violations. He struck
back by accusing Harrick Jr. of
breaking NCAA rules.
"Yeah, I admit to making
some poor decisions in recruit
ing," the elder Harrick said.
"You can't go !3() years and not
make a mistake."
Cole wasn't the first question
able recruit to be championed
by Harrick. There was criticism
at Rhode Island when he
brought in Lamar Odom, who
had been linked to alleged
cheating on college entrance
exams.
"The first person anyone
ever brings up is Lamar Odom,"
Harrick said. "But he's a great
guy and he laid a great founda
tion for his future."
Odom, who now plays for the
Los Angeles Clippers, is an un
wavering Harrick supporter.
"I remember sitting down
and talking to him when I was
getting ready to go to the NBA,"
Odom said. "He talked to me
like he was talking to one of his
sons. I was just a young black kid
from the inner city, but he al
ways took his time with me."
Shortly after getting to Geor
gia, Harrick tried to sign Kenny
Brunner, a talented player with
a troubled history. He was
kicked out of Fresno State for
wielding a samurai sword
against a former student. He
also spent four months in jail for
allegedly attempting to shoot a
Los Angeles college coach.
Brunner moved to Athens,
but Georgia president Michael
Adams denied him admission.
"He never came here," Har
rick said. "That's on me, no
question, but he wasn't admit
ted. It was still a huge story. I
don't know why."
