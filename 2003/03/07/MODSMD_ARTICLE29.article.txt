Men's Volleyball
Today: vs. Lewis, 7:30 p.m.
Saturday: vs. Findlay, 7:30 p.m., Cardinal Invitational

The Cardinal will take on Lewis on Friday at
7:30 and Findlay on Saturday at 7:30.
"It's nice to get a break from conference
play," coach Don Shaw said. "It's kind of a re
laxing thing. We're just playing for fun, for
pride. It's a nice break from what we've been
going through the past few weeks."
Currently, Stanford is clinging to the eighth
and final playoff spot in the MPSF, sitting only
a half-game in front of UCLA.
The Cardinal is coming off a 3-0 victory over
Pacific on Tuesday night, its second over the
Tigers this season. Senior William Strickland
led the Cardinal with 13 kills, three digs and
three blocks.
Strickland, who has appeared in a team-high
75 games, averages 3.23 kills per game, good
for second-best on the team.
While the two matches this week will have no
bearing on the Cardinal's playoff hopes, the
team is still preparing for a tough weekend.
"We saw Lewis last year at Penn State with
basically the same team," Shaw said. "[There is]
one difference in outside hitter. They're very
good. They've got some international players
with a lot of experience."
Lewis is currently riding a school-record 13-
match win streak.
Junior opposite hitter Fabiano Barreto and
sophomore outside hitters Gustavo Meyer and
Victor Bird are setting the pace for the Flyers.
Barreto leads the team with 226 kills on the
season, while Meyer and Bird have 109 and
125, respectively.
The Cardinal fell to Lewis 3-2 last year in the
NCAA Preview Tournament held at Penn
State.

"Findlay, we don't know much about," Shaw
said. "We'll see them play UOPon Friday night.
That'll be our scouting report."
Freshman outside hitter Jim Dzizcowski has
led the way for the Oilers of late, recording
team-highs in kills in four of the last five match

es. Junior opposite hitter Jeff Overfield has also
been strong for Findlay.
In addition, Burnham Pavilion will see ac
tion in the afternoon when Pacific faces off
against Findlay on Friday and on Saturday
when Pacific takes on Lewis.
