# Pac-10 is tough to figure out
## Competitive conference may send just three teams to NCAAs 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Women's Tour
nament begins today in San Jose,
and on paper, everything seems
pretty clear-cut.
No. 9 Stanford, No. 25 Wash
ington and No. 22 Arizona have es
tablished themselves as the three
top teams in the league and as of
now figure to be the only locks for
the NCAA tournament.
But things become more blurry
when you take a closer look at
what lias shaken down in confer
ence play.
Take for example the three
teams that have beaten the top
seeded Cardinal (23-4, 15-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) in Pac-10 play:
Washington, Arizona and South
ern California.
The second-seeded Huskies did
it behind the play of just-pro
claimed Pac-10 Player of the Year

Guilana Mendiola. They've also
lost to sixth-seeded Oregon State.
The third-seeded Wildcats
blitzed Stanford in the desert last
weekend. But Arizona has lost to
the Beavers, too and to ninth-place
California.
And then there are the Trojans,
(the first team to beat the Cardinal
in its previous 28 conference
games at the time) the seventh
seed in the tournament which has
lost to the Bears.
The magnificent Pac-10 Con
ference?
Call it the mercurial 10.
USC coach Chris Gobrecht had
another way of explaining it.
"We've got a couple of teams
that are clinically schizophrenic,"
said Gobrecht after her team
played at Stanford on Feb. 20.
The Cardinal will be in the
midst of this schizophrenia at the
Compaq Center starting Saturday
at 5 p.m., when it will play the win
ner of the game between eighth
seeded Arizona State (15-12, 7-11)
and ninth-seeded Cal (9-18, 5-13).
The semifinals will be at 12:30
and 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon,
while the championship game will

be held at 7:30 p.m. Monday.
That's the ultimate destination
for the Cardinal, who is looking to
claim its first-ever Pac-10 Tourna
ment championship. In last year's
inaugural title game in Eugene,
Stanford lost to the third-seeded
Sun Devils, 70-63.
But avoiding the same fate —
or even a collapse earlier in the
weekend — won't be all that easy.
The Pac-10 is better— a Jot
better — than it was a year ago.
(Heck, Stanford finally lost some
games this year. They were 18-0 in
league play last season.)
"Somebody better wake up and
see what's going on in this confer
ence," Gobrecht said. "Stanford is
being challenged at a far greater
rate, and 1 have a much better
team that I had a year ago, and I
can't get out of [seventh] place.
"For us to both acknowledge
that we have better teams than we
did a year ago — and that we're
having that much more trouble
than a year ago — I just think it
will be a travesty if the committee
doesn't wake up."

Junior guard Katie Denny shuts down the lane against Oregon State earlier this season. The No. 9 Cardinal will need
production from Denny and the rest of the bench if Stanford is to win this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference Tourna
ment as coach Tara VanDerveer has promised to keep her starters fresh for the NCAA Tournament.
What Gobrecht is referring to is
the recent trend of the NCAA
Tournament committee to spite
the perceived "weak" Pac-10 con
ference come tournament time, es
pecially the last two years.
Last year, only Stanford and Ari
zona State made (he Big Dance. In
2001, only the Cardinal, Sun Devils
and Washington were invited.
Gobrecht felt the problem in
the past was that the conference
teams didn't go out and beat some
of the upper-tier squads on the
East Coast in non-conference.
"But," she said, "this year we all
went out and beat people."
Well, sort of. The conference
did beat five top-25 teams in the
non-conference, but three of those
were by Stanford (Kansas State,
Rutgers, Oklahoma).
"What else does this conference

have to do?" Gobrecht asked. "We
did what we needed to do.
"[The NCAA Tournament
Committee] needs to give us our
four or five teams, bottom line."
Right now, it looks like the only
way that will happen is if UCLA
wins at least two games in the tour
nament, or a darkhorse like USC
or Oregon gets hot during the
weekend and sweeps through the
field.
But that's highly unlikely, con
sidering that one side of the brack
et has Stanford, and the other lias
both Arizona and Washington.
Speaking of the Cardinal, coach
Tara VanDerveer feels like her
team doesn't have all that much to
gain, and a whole lot to lose, this
coming weekend.
"The most important thing for
me is everyone being healthy," she
said. "A seed doesn't matter much.
It's easy to see why VanDerveer
(who was named Pac-10 coach of
the Year yesterday) feels that way if
you consider what happened to the

Cardinal last year around this time.
Right before the Pac-10 tourna
ment, leading scorer Lindsey Ya
masaki underwent an emergency
appendectomy and was force to
miss the entire tournament.
The result?
The Cardinal lost first in the
Pac-10 Tournament champi
onship game, walked through the
first two rounds of the NCAA
Tournament, and surprisingly fell
in the Sweet 16 to Colorado.
Therefore, Stanford wants to
make sure it's peaking at the right
time this time around. The Cardi
nal began the season 8-1 without
Powell, struggled to assimilate her
back into the lineup, and in the last
several games hasn't been quite as
sharp as it had been earlier in the
year.
"We really want to play our best
basketball at the end of the season,
not the beginning."
Everyone will get their response
to that challenge starting this

The Pacific-10 Women's Tour
nament begins today in San Jose,
and on paper, everything seems
pretty clear-cut.
No. 9 Stanford, No. 25 Wash
ington and No. 22 Arizona have es
tablished themselves as the three
top teams in the league and as of
now figure to be the only locks for
the NCAA tournament.
But things become more blurry
when you take a closer look at
what lias shaken down in confer
ence play.
Take for example the three
teams that have beaten the top
seeded Cardinal (23-4, 15-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) in Pac-10 play:
Washington, Arizona and South
ern California.
The second-seeded Huskies did
it behind the play of just-pro
claimed Pac-10 Player of the Year

Guilana Mendiola. They've also
lost to sixth-seeded Oregon State.
The third-seeded Wildcats
blitzed Stanford in the desert last
weekend. But Arizona has lost to
the Beavers, too and to ninth-place
California.
And then there are the Trojans,
(the first team to beat the Cardinal
in its previous 28 conference
games at the time) the seventh
seed in the tournament which has
lost to the Bears.
The magnificent Pac-10 Con
ference?
Call it the mercurial 10.
USC coach Chris Gobrecht had
another way of explaining it.
"We've got a couple of teams
that are clinically schizophrenic,"
said Gobrecht after her team
played at Stanford on Feb. 20.
The Cardinal will be in the
midst of this schizophrenia at the
Compaq Center starting Saturday
at 5 p.m., when it will play the win
ner of the game between eighth
seeded Arizona State (15-12, 7-11)
and ninth-seeded Cal (9-18, 5-13).
The semifinals will be at 12:30
and 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon,
while the championship game will

be held at 7:30 p.m. Monday.
That's the ultimate destination
for the Cardinal, who is looking to
claim its first-ever Pac-10 Tourna
ment championship. In last year's
inaugural title game in Eugene,
Stanford lost to the third-seeded
Sun Devils, 70-63.
But avoiding the same fate —
or even a collapse earlier in the
weekend — won't be all that easy.
The Pac-10 is better— a Jot
better — than it was a year ago.
(Heck, Stanford finally lost some
games this year. They were 18-0 in
league play last season.)
"Somebody better wake up and
see what's going on in this confer
ence," Gobrecht said. "Stanford is
being challenged at a far greater
rate, and 1 have a much better
team that I had a year ago, and I
can't get out of [seventh] place.
"For us to both acknowledge
that we have better teams than we
did a year ago — and that we're
having that much more trouble
than a year ago — I just think it
will be a travesty if the committee
doesn't wake up."

Junior guard Katie Denny shuts down the lane against Oregon State earlier this season. The No. 9 Cardinal will need
production from Denny and the rest of the bench if Stanford is to win this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference Tourna
ment as coach Tara VanDerveer has promised to keep her starters fresh for the NCAA Tournament.
What Gobrecht is referring to is
the recent trend of the NCAA
Tournament committee to spite
the perceived "weak" Pac-10 con
ference come tournament time, es
pecially the last two years.
Last year, only Stanford and Ari
zona State made (he Big Dance. In
2001, only the Cardinal, Sun Devils
and Washington were invited.
Gobrecht felt the problem in
the past was that the conference
teams didn't go out and beat some
of the upper-tier squads on the
East Coast in non-conference.
"But," she said, "this year we all
went out and beat people."
Well, sort of. The conference
did beat five top-25 teams in the
non-conference, but three of those
were by Stanford (Kansas State,
Rutgers, Oklahoma).
"What else does this conference

have to do?" Gobrecht asked. "We
did what we needed to do.
"[The NCAA Tournament
Committee] needs to give us our
four or five teams, bottom line."
Right now, it looks like the only
way that will happen is if UCLA
wins at least two games in the tour
nament, or a darkhorse like USC
or Oregon gets hot during the
weekend and sweeps through the
field.
But that's highly unlikely, con
sidering that one side of the brack
et has Stanford, and the other lias
both Arizona and Washington.
Speaking of the Cardinal, coach
Tara VanDerveer feels like her
team doesn't have all that much to
gain, and a whole lot to lose, this
coming weekend.
"The most important thing for
me is everyone being healthy," she
said. "A seed doesn't matter much.
It's easy to see why VanDerveer
(who was named Pac-10 coach of
the Year yesterday) feels that way if
you consider what happened to the

Cardinal last year around this time.
Right before the Pac-10 tourna
ment, leading scorer Lindsey Ya
masaki underwent an emergency
appendectomy and was force to
miss the entire tournament.
The result?
The Cardinal lost first in the
Pac-10 Tournament champi
onship game, walked through the
first two rounds of the NCAA
Tournament, and surprisingly fell
in the Sweet 16 to Colorado.
Therefore, Stanford wants to
make sure it's peaking at the right
time this time around. The Cardi
nal began the season 8-1 without
Powell, struggled to assimilate her
back into the lineup, and in the last
several games hasn't been quite as
sharp as it had been earlier in the
year.
"We really want to play our best
basketball at the end of the season,
not the beginning."
Everyone will get their response
to that challenge starting this
weekend.
