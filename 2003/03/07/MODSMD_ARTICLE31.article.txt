# Pac-10 is tough to figure out
## Competitive conference may send just three teams to NCAAs 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Women's Tour
nament begins today in San Jose,
and on paper, everything seems
pretty clear-cut.
No. 9 Stanford, No. 25 Wash
ington and No. 22 Arizona have es
tablished themselves as the three
top teams in the league and as of
now figure to be the only locks for
the NCAA tournament.
But things become more blurry
when you take a closer look at
what lias shaken down in confer
ence play.
Take for example the three
teams that have beaten the top
seeded Cardinal (23-4, 15-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) in Pac-10 play:
Washington, Arizona and South
ern California.
The second-seeded Huskies did
it behind the play of just-pro
claimed Pac-10 Player of the Year

Guilana Mendiola. They've also
lost to sixth-seeded Oregon State.
The third-seeded Wildcats
blitzed Stanford in the desert last
weekend. But Arizona has lost to
the Beavers, too and to ninth-place
California.
And then there are the Trojans,
(the first team to beat the Cardinal
in its previous 28 conference
games at the time) the seventh
seed in the tournament which has
lost to the Bears.
The magnificent Pac-10 Con
ference?
Call it the mercurial 10.
USC coach Chris Gobrecht had
another way of explaining it.
"We've got a couple of teams
that are clinically schizophrenic,"
said Gobrecht after her team
played at Stanford on Feb. 20.
The Cardinal will be in the
midst of this schizophrenia at the
Compaq Center starting Saturday
at 5 p.m., when it will play the win
ner of the game between eighth
seeded Arizona State (15-12, 7-11)
and ninth-seeded Cal (9-18, 5-13).
The semifinals will be at 12:30
and 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon,
while the championship game will

be held at 7:30 p.m. Monday.
That's the ultimate destination
for the Cardinal, who is looking to
claim its first-ever Pac-10 Tourna
ment championship. In last year's
inaugural title game in Eugene,
Stanford lost to the third-seeded
Sun Devils, 70-63.
But avoiding the same fate —
or even a collapse earlier in the
weekend — won't be all that easy.
The Pac-10 is better— a Jot
better — than it was a year ago.
(Heck, Stanford finally lost some
games this year. They were 18-0 in
league play last season.)
"Somebody better wake up and
see what's going on in this confer
ence," Gobrecht said. "Stanford is
being challenged at a far greater
rate, and 1 have a much better
team that I had a year ago, and I
can't get out of [seventh] place.
"For us to both acknowledge
that we have better teams than we
did a year ago — and that we're
having that much more trouble
than a year ago — I just think it
will be a travesty if the committee
doesn't wake up."

Junior guard Katie Denny shuts down the lane against Oregon State earlier this season. The No. 9 Cardinal will need
production from Denny and the rest of the bench if Stanford is to win this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference Tourna
ment as coach Tara VanDerveer has promised to keep her starters fresh for the NCAA Tournament.
