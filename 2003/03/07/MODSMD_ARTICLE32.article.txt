# Card's improvement creates an advantage
## 
### 
A lot has changed for the Stanford men's
basketball team since it fell to California,
72-59, on Jan. 4 at Haas Pavilion. Al
though both teams find themselves with identi
cal 13-4 records in the Pac-10, Stanford is a
much better team now than then.
And I believe that, this time, Stanford is
going to come out on top.
In the January meeting, Cal executed flaw
lessly, finishing with only six turnovers. Because
of sophomore center Rob Little's foul trouble
and junior forward Justin Davis was knocked out
with a knee injury in the second half, Cal was able

to win the rebound battle, 41-
30. While the Bears used
screens and dribble penetration
to secure open looks, Stanford
struggled to get good looks, and
the Cardinal's starting guards,
senior Julius Barnes and junior
Matt Lottich, forced their way
to 6-of-23 combined shooting
for just 15 points.

J ■
Two months of bruising l'ac-10 play have
given Stanford plenty of time to improve on
those weaknesses.

Last Saturday, Barnes and Lottich had a sim
ilarly dismal night, combining for 17 points on
5-of-24 shooting. Yet the Cardinal lost by only
three points to No. 1 Arizona.
The difference? Inside play.
Ever since Justin Davis returned from his
knee injury, the Cardinal's offense has become
much more balanced. Stanford's more concert
ed — and more effective — attempts to gener
ate scoring in the paint often open things up for
the perimeter players.


Mark Thoma
Against Arizona State on Feb.
27, Stanford started the game by
feeding the ball into the post on
nearly every possession.
With the Sun Devils on their
heels because of their inability to
stop the inside game, Barnes went
on a huge scoring run, slashing to
the basket and draining good looks
from the perimeter en route to 29
points.
Ihe improved presence of
Davis and Little in the paint has
also made things easier for sopho
more Josh Childress. Even if op
posing teams manage to stop Stan
ford's big men down low, and to
limit the guards' open looks from
beyond the arc, they still have to
contend with Childress, the ulti
mate swingman. Capable of post
ing up, slashing to the hoop, or
spotting up from three, Childress is
a back-breaker.

So, what about Cal? What do
they need to do to sweep the season
series?
First off, it's important to note
that those teams that have beaten
the Cardinal in conference play
have all done so because of high
energy play. Cal, bolstered by their
home crowd, came out hyped for
the conference opener, and Stan
ford was never fully able to re
spond.
Washington ran the Cardinal
ragged on Jan. 18, rebounding
and pushing the ball upcourt be
fore Stanford could regroup and
get back on defense and always re
lentlessly attacking the basket.
On Feb. 6, Oregon took advan
tage of a flat Stanford team, and
Luke Ridnour took over in the
second half, propelling a jazzed
Ducks team to victory.
Finally, last weekend, Arizona
was relentless on defense, picking
up the Stanford guards well be
yond the 3-point arc and making
every move as difficult as possible,
frustrating the Cardinal. Stanford

has risen to the big challenges this
season, and it has done a good job
shutting down big stars like
Xavier's David West and Arizona
State's Ike Diogu.
The Cardinal has the defensive
fortitude to cope with the Bears'
"big three" of forwards Joe Shipp
and Amit Tamil and guard Brian
Wethers. While it is possible that a
huge individual performance
could propel Cal, it seems more
likely that its stars will turn in de
cent performances, leaving it up to
the rest of the Bears' roster to make
the difference.
Other than 24-year-old fresh
man point guard Richard Midge
ley, who averages 9.4 points per
game, no one outside of the "big
three" averages more than 3.2
points per game.
Advantage? Stanford.
