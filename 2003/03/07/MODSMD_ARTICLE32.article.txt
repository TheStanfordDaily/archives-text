# Card's improvement creates an advantage
## 
### 
A lot has changed for the Stanford men's
basketball team since it fell to California,
72-59, on Jan. 4 at Haas Pavilion. Al
though both teams find themselves with identi
cal 13-4 records in the Pac-10, Stanford is a
much better team now than then.
And I believe that, this time, Stanford is
going to come out on top.
In the January meeting, Cal executed flaw
lessly, finishing with only six turnovers. Because
of sophomore center Rob Little's foul trouble
and junior forward Justin Davis was knocked out
with a knee injury in the second half, Cal was able

to win the rebound battle, 41-
30. While the Bears used
screens and dribble penetration
to secure open looks, Stanford
struggled to get good looks, and
the Cardinal's starting guards,
senior Julius Barnes and junior
Matt Lottich, forced their way
to 6-of-23 combined shooting
for just 15 points.

Two months of bruising l'ac-10 play have
given Stanford plenty of time to improve on
those weaknesses.

Last Saturday, Barnes and Lottich had a sim
ilarly dismal night, combining for 17 points on
5-of-24 shooting. Yet the Cardinal lost by only
three points to No. 1 Arizona.
The difference? Inside play.
Ever since Justin Davis returned from his
knee injury, the Cardinal's offense has become
much more balanced. Stanford's more concert
ed — and more effective — attempts to gener
ate scoring in the paint often open things up for
the perimeter players.
