# Julius Barnes
## Final homestand 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most would argue that last year's Se
nior Day at Maples Pavilion held a lot
more relevance than tomorrow's celebra
tion. Chants of "one more year, one more
year," for ex-Cardinal juniors Casey Ja
cobsen and Curtis Borchardt rang out
from the mouths of the Sixth Man Club
faithful as the significance of that mo
ment and their forthcoming career deci
sions were apparent.
But a year has since past and now
amidst recent Stanford success, memo
ries of that day have all but faded.

Tomorrow evening, a "new" batch of
seniors will stroll to center court to greet
their mothers with roses and smiles. And
although chants of "one more year"
would be futile with reference to senior
point guard Julius Barnes, that doesn't
mean that the sentiment isn't there.
Despite the fact that he's been here for
four years, Barnes' final game at Maples
seems slightly premature. Despite the
fact that he's played significant minutes
in the past, it almost feels as if we've all
just been introduced tothe6-foot-l point
guard from Rowland Heights, Calif. —


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Senior point guard Julius Barnes has lifted the Cardinal to a No. 17 national ranking and
a second-place showdown against California tomorrow night at Maples.
that we're just now beginning to
know and feel comfortable with
and appreciate his athletic style of
play.
And to a certain extent his
teammates and coaches are finally
becoming accustomed to what his
athleticism and scorer's mentality
bring to the traditionally pass-first
Stanford point guard position.
"He's been able to play the
point position at a time when he
really hadn't played it in awhile,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery of Barnes. "He's
done a really nice job and he's
grown up, he's graduating and

he's had some extremely good
games for us. I'm not trying to cre
ate this guy in a certain image [or]
break him down. Julius has some
natural ability [and] sometimes
you have to live with that, just like
Brevin | Knight]."
With that said, Montgomery's
decision to move Barnes into the
role of starting point guard was
definitely one of necessity. When
Stanford's projected starter at the
one-spot, sophomore Chris Her
nandez, re-broke his foot in early
December, Barnes was moved
back to floor general. And the Car
dinal has certainly been successful
with Barnes at the helm.
Interestingly enough, last sea
son's game against California at
Maples was a coming-out party of
sorts.Barnes' then-career high 27-

point performance, which culmi
nated with a 360-degree layup to
lead the Cardinal to victory over
die Golden Bears, offered specta
tors a small glimpse of how capable
lie was offensively, of how explo
sive and athletic and spectacular
he could be. He brought a sense of
showmanship to Maples and is un
deniably a part of the athletic evo
lution of Stanford basketball.
"Julius is a much-improved
point guard from where he was
earlier in his career," junior shoot
ing guard Matt Lottieh said. "He's
been creating shots for others,
which I think is the true job of a
point guard and as a result I think
people are beginning to notice that
lie's playing a lot better."
But the pressure that Barnes
has faced this year with having to

be the Cardinal's number one
scorer and number one ball han
dler has presented challenges. It's
taken awhile, but he's beginning to
figure out how to blend his explo
sive athleticism with the consistent
calm necessary to lead this team
through tough stretches.
"In terms of me settling into the
position, [I'm] trying not to force
ihings and getting comfortable
with my teammates," Barnes said.
"I think the coaching staff has
done a great job of trying to utilize
die skills that 1 bring to (lie table.
I've tried to adapt by not trying lo
go lull throttle all of the time. I've
learned to pic k and choose when
to do certain things and to be more
confident in the abilities of both my
teammates and myself."
This is clearly demonstrated by

ihe fact that he is leading the team
both in scoring and assists. Barnes
is beginning to figure out how to
balance scoring and creating for
others, a feat, which couldn't come
at a better time fora Stanford team
ready to embark on the senior's
last post-season journey.
And for Barnes, who hopes to
play in the NBA next season, this
post-season is extremely impor
tant.
"Hopefully we'll make a deep
run in the [NCAA] tournament
and I think that if I can play well
and help my team to win games
that will bring some more national
attention to me," he said.
But for the time being, he's tak
ing one game at a time, which
brings us back to tomorrow's Cali
fornia matchup.

Traditionally, Senior Day at
Maples is a story of endings, of
farewell tributes and goodbyes.
But fora post-season-focused
Barnes there is no time to consider
the significance of the day, to even
contemplate the idea of it all being
° v cr.
" fhe finality of it all hasn't set
in," Barnes said. "It probably will
once the season's over and 1 have
time to reflect on it. But right now,
everything's just been routine —
practice, school, sleep. I'm just re
ally focused right now."
Me pauses.
"It's definitely been a quick four
years, though. I remember being
dropped off the lirst day [of fresh
man year]. It's been crazy. It's been
hectic. But at the same time, it's
also been a lot of fun."
