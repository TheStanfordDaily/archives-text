# Julius Barnes
## Final homestand 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most would argue that last year's Se
nior Day at Maples Pavilion held a lot
more relevance than tomorrow's celebra
tion. Chants of "one more year, one more
year," for ex-Cardinal juniors Casey Ja
cobsen and Curtis Borchardt rang out
from the mouths of the Sixth Man Club
faithful as the significance of that mo
ment and their forthcoming career deci
sions were apparent.
But a year has since past and now
amidst recent Stanford success, memo
ries of that day have all but faded.

Tomorrow evening, a "new" batch of
seniors will stroll to center court to greet
their mothers with roses and smiles. And
although chants of "one more year"
would be futile with reference to senior
point guard Julius Barnes, that doesn't
mean that the sentiment isn't there.
Despite the fact that he's been here for
four years, Barnes' final game at Maples
seems slightly premature. Despite the
fact that he's played significant minutes
in the past, it almost feels as if we've all
just been introduced tothe6-foot-l point
guard from Rowland Heights, Calif. â€”

Senior point guard Julius Barnes has lifted the Cardinal to a No. 17 national ranking and
a second-place showdown against California tomorrow night at Maples.
