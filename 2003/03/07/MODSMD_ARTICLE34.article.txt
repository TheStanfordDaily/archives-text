Anytime the Golden Bears make the short trip
clown to the Farm it is met with mounting anticipation
from Bay Area basketball fans. With the No. 2 position
in the conference on the line, and consequently the
No. 2 seed in next week's Pacific-10 Conference Tour
nament, Saturday's matchup between No. 17 Stanford
(22-7) and No. 20 California (20-6) is certifiably a big
game.

Men's Basketball
vs. No. 20 California, Saturday, 7 p.m.

The contest marks the final regular season game for
each school and the completion of a Pac-10 season that
currently has both teams standing at an impressive 13-
4 league mark.
Both California and Stanford have exceeded pro
jected conference performance, being picked to finish
fifth and seventh, respectively, in the preseason Pac-10
polls.
However, while both teams have virtually assured
themselves a position in the NCAA Tournament and a
strong seeding in the Pac-10 Tournament, it doesn't
make Saturday's game any less important. Stanford
has yet to be beaten twice by any Pac-10 opponent this
season and beating their rivals tomorrow would keep
that from happening in the regular season.
In the first meeting between the two teams, Stan

"Well, they beat the dog out of us physically last

made a special point to play that way. Their comments
afterward indicated that if you out-rebound Stanford
you can beat them."
The Golden Bears followed their game plan per

plete the victory at Haas Pavilion.
Since that contest, Cal's identity has relied on a big
three of sorts as seniors Joe Shipp and Brian Wethers
and sophomore Amit Tamil have defined themselves
as arguably the premiere offensive trio in the Pac-10.
Together accounting for almost 70 percent of the
Golden Bears offensive output, Shipp, Wethers and
Tamil present matchup problems for any team.
"It is pretty defined what everybody's role is for
them ana those three guys in particular have just been
phenomenal in their consistency," said Montgomery
of the trio. "They have been putting up numbers. It
has been [20 points from each] almost every game."
Shipp led the Bear charge in the teams' first meet
ing, scoring 18 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. He
leads the conference in scoring at 21 points per game.
At 6-foot-5 he is capable of playing the wing, or step
ping into the four position in the post.
Shipp's ability to rebound and play inside allows
