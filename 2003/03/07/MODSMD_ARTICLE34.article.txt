### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anytime the Golden Bears make the short trip
clown to the Farm it is met with mounting anticipation
from Bay Area basketball fans. With the No. 2 position
in the conference on the line, and consequently the
No. 2 seed in next week's Pacific-10 Conference Tour
nament, Saturday's matchup between No. 17 Stanford
(22-7) and No. 20 California (20-6) is certifiably a big
game.

Men's Basketball
vs. No. 20 California, Saturday, 7 p.m.

The contest marks the final regular season game for
each school and the completion of a Pac-10 season that
currently has both teams standing at an impressive 13-
4 league mark.
Both California and Stanford have exceeded pro
jected conference performance, being picked to finish
fifth and seventh, respectively, in the preseason Pac-10
polls.
However, while both teams have virtually assured
themselves a position in the NCAA Tournament and a
strong seeding in the Pac-10 Tournament, it doesn't
make Saturday's game any less important. Stanford
has yet to be beaten twice by any Pac-10 opponent this
season and beating their rivals tomorrow would keep
that from happening in the regular season.
In the first meeting between the two teams, Stan
ford fell prey to Cal's presence inside in a 72-59 loss.
"Well, they beat the dog out of us physically last
time," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. "They
made a special point to play that way. Their comments
afterward indicated that if you out-rebound Stanford
you can beat them."
The Golden Bears followed their game plan per
fectly— out-rebounding the Cardinal 40-31 to com
plete the victory at Haas Pavilion.
Since that contest, Cal's identity has relied on a big
three of sorts as seniors Joe Shipp and Brian Wethers
and sophomore Amit Tamil have defined themselves
as arguably the premiere offensive trio in the Pac-10.
Together accounting for almost 70 percent of the
Golden Bears offensive output, Shipp, Wethers and
Tamil present matchup problems for any team.
"It is pretty defined what everybody's role is for
them ana those three guys in particular have just been
phenomenal in their consistency," said Montgomery
of the trio. "They have been putting up numbers. It
has been [20 points from each] almost every game."
Shipp led the Bear charge in the teams' first meet
ing, scoring 18 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. He
leads the conference in scoring at 21 points per game.
At 6-foot-5 he is capable of playing the wing, or step
ping into the four position in the post.
Shipp's ability to rebound and play inside allows
Tamir, a 6-foot-11 center, to make
use of his consistent outside shoot
ing without hurting the Golden
Bears too much on the boards.
Tamir leads Cal in 3-pointers made
with 59, on 44.7 shooting from be
yond the arc.
Wethers is Cal's most athletic
player, and in addition to putting
up consistent offensive numbers, is
extremely tough at the defensive
end of the floor.
"[The game is] important be
cause they're our rivals," said ju
nior shooting guard Matt Lottich.
"We want to end the Pac-10 on a
good note and we don't want to
lose anymore games at home."
Saturday's game is more than

just another tough rivalry
matchup, it also marks the last time
senior Julius Barnes will play in
Maples Pavilion.
"He has done a lot of things that
have made me smile," Mont
gomery said. "Even this year there
has been tremendous progress. He
is distributing the ball much better,
made some nice post passes and
has really stepped up to lead the
team."
In addition to honoring Barnes,
fellow seniors forward Tyler
Besecker and guard Olatunde
Sobomehin will be honored for
their contributions to the Cardinal.
Besecker, a walk-on for the Cardi
nal, will graduate this year despite
still having one year of eligibility.
Sobomehin is also a walk-on, join
ing the team midway through the
season after serving as a team man
ager for several years.
