# The 						Pac-10 Tourney:
## Help or harm? 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Pacific- lOC Conference,
there is much to be gained from a
post-season tournament: money
(mostly on the men's side), expo
sure and an automatic bid to the
NCAAs for the tournament win
ner.
"We were only one of two con
ferences that didn't have a con
ference tournament," explained
assistant women's basketball
coach Karen Middlemen. "The
semi-finals and finals are tele
vised so we get some national ex
posure."
The Pac-10 Conference has
aggressively tried to maximize
exposure for its women's tourna
ment. In addition to launching a
wide-spread advertising cam
paign. the organizing committee
chose the HP Pavilion in San Jose
as a neutral site because of its rep
utation for supporting women's
sports.
So far ticket sales are hovering
around the organizing commit
tee's goal of 5,000 all-session pass
es.
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer believes, however,
that her team has more to lose
than gain this weekend. As the
regular season conference cham
pion and No. 1 seed. Stanford
lias just spent three grueling

months proving that it is the best
team in the conference, so it
seems silly to tier for one week
end of basketball to be weighted
so heavily.
"I didn't vote for the tourna
ment because 1 think it negates
the 18-game schedule," Van-
Derveer said. "A USC or Oregon
team could win the tournament.
A seventh-place team in your
conference can do it. It's good tor
them, but I don't think it is neces
sarily good for us. We have more
to lose than to gain by the tour
nament. You put your team at
risk health-wise whenever you
play three games in three days."
It's obvious why the second
tier teams in the conference want
a post-season tournament. For
every team other than Stanford,
Arizona and Washington, this
weekend will likely be its only
pc >st-season experience.
More importantly, the confer
ence tournament is an opportu
nity fora bubble team or a team
that has no chance at the NCAA
Tournament to win the champi
onship and receive an automatic
bid to the Big Dance.
Stanford, though, has another
goal in mind. VatiDei veer's
biggest concern at this point is
keeping her team healthy for the
NCAA tournament.

Sophomore guard Kelley Suminski and the Cardinal are not neces
sarily ecstatic to be playing in the Pac-10 Tournament, as they can
not help but look ahead to their guaranteed trip to the Big Dance.
"The most important thing for
me is everyone being healthy," she
said. "What seed you are | in the
NCAAs] doesn't matter that much.
People being healthy and playing
well together is more important."
This season has been particular
ly long and wearing for the Cardi
nal because of increased physical
play in the Pac-10.
"It's a long season," Middleman
said. "With 18 regular season
games and then a conference tour
nament, you are really beating each
other up. With the way play has
gone, it's very physical and takes a
toll on your body."
Last year, VanDerveer believes
Nicole Powell played too many
minutes in the first two games and
was worn down by the time Stan
ford lost to Arizona State in the
championship.
"We depended too much on
Nicole last year," VanDerveer said.
"She had to play too many minutes.
By the third game she was worn

down and people really beat her
up. I need to keep people fresher
and use a deeper rotation. We have
to juggle people minutes and be
conscious of resting people."
But the Pac-10 Tournament is
not all bad for Stanford. At the very
least, it will provide an important
opportunity for the Cardinal to
prepare for the NCAA and improve
its execution.
"The timing is good in that it is
two weeks ahead of the NCAA tour
nament," VanDerveer said. "These
are teams that know you, so they
can really help you sharpen your
game and work on things you need
to improve on. They have each
player scouted well and they know
your plays. You can use it as a focus
and address problems before the
NCAA tournament."
The Cardinal is particularly fo
tused on offensive execution, de
fense and rebounding â€” all factors
that hurt the team in recent losses to
Arizona and Washington.
For the players, there also re
mains some unfinished business
from last year when the Cardinal
lost in the championship game de
spite sweeping the conference reg

ular season play.
"There is an underlying motiva
tion," sophomore Sebnem Kimya
cioglu said. "It was disappointing
last year not to win the tournament
championship."
Powell in particular has some
thing to prove. Yesterday, Wash
ington guard Giuliana Mendiola
was named the Pac-10 Player of the
Year. Mendiola led the Huskies to a
second-place finish while leading
the conference in assists with 5.4
per game. Many considered Powell
to be the frontrunner for the award,
as she averaged a near double-dou
ble with 18.7 points and 9.5 re
bounds per game in carrying Stan
ford to the conference title. She is
one of 20 finalists for the Naismith
Player of the Year award given to
the nation's best player.
If Powell can lead Stanford to the
Tournament title it will go a long
way toward proving that she is the
conference's dominant player.
Still the fact remains that playing
three physical games in three days
is not the best preparation for the
NCAA tournament and doing well
in the NCAA tournament will be
the best exposure for Stanford.
