# The
						Pac-10 Tourney:
## Help or harm? 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Pacific- lOC Conference,
there is much to be gained from a
post-season tournament: money
(mostly on the men's side), expo
sure and an automatic bid to the
NCAAs for the tournament win
ner.
"We were only one of two con
ferences that didn't have a con
ference tournament," explained
assistant women's basketball
coach Karen Middlemen. "The
semi-finals and finals are tele
vised so we get some national ex
posure."
The Pac-10 Conference has
aggressively tried to maximize
exposure for its women's tourna
ment. In addition to launching a
wide-spread advertising cam
paign. the organizing committee
chose the HP Pavilion in San Jose
as a neutral site because of its rep
utation for supporting women's
sports.
So far ticket sales are hovering
around the organizing commit
tee's goal of 5,000 all-session pass
es.
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer believes, however,
that her team has more to lose
than gain this weekend. As the
regular season conference cham
pion and No. 1 seed. Stanford
lias just spent three grueling

months proving that it is the best
team in the conference, so it
seems silly to tier for one week
end of basketball to be weighted
so heavily.
"I didn't vote for the tourna
ment because 1 think it negates
the 18-game schedule," Van-
Derveer said. "A USC or Oregon
team could win the tournament.
A seventh-place team in your
conference can do it. It's good tor
them, but I don't think it is neces
sarily good for us. We have more
to lose than to gain by the tour
nament. You put your team at
risk health-wise whenever you
play three games in three days."
It's obvious why the second
tier teams in the conference want
a post-season tournament. For
every team other than Stanford,
Arizona and Washington, this
weekend will likely be its only
pc >st-season experience.
More importantly, the confer
ence tournament is an opportu
nity fora bubble team or a team
that has no chance at the NCAA
Tournament to win the champi
onship and receive an automatic
bid to the Big Dance.
Stanford, though, has another
goal in mind. VatiDei veer's
biggest concern at this point is
keeping her team healthy for the
NCAA tournament.

Sophomore guard Kelley Suminski and the Cardinal are not neces
sarily ecstatic to be playing in the Pac-10 Tournament, as they can
not help but look ahead to their guaranteed trip to the Big Dance.
