# Stanford teams up on distance learning project
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Through a teleconference linking Singapore and
Stanford last month, Nanyang Technological Univer
sity and Stanford finalized an agreement fora multi
faceted research and distance learning project that will
increase the University's presence in Southeast Asia
and expose it to unique environmental engineering
challenges.
The Stanford Singapore Partnership, which en
ables students and professors in environmental engi
neering to collaborate on research projects, will allow
15 to 20 Singaporean graduate students to spend a
summer quarter at Stanford and three quarters in Sin
gapore taking Stanford classes through distance learn
ing arrangements.
Though the program will not greatly increase the
number of Singaporean students at Stanford — there
are already 143, according to 2001 statistics — it will
offer a unique application of Internet collaboration,
said Andy DiPaolo, executive director of the Stanford
Center for Professional Development.
"The program is a terrific blend bet ween students
who will come to Stanford first and then take part in
the distance education program," DiPaolo said.
Cheong Hee Kiat, dean of the NTU School of Civil
and Environmental Engineering, said that the part
nership allows the Singaporean university to gain ex
pertise and respect in the field of environmental engi
neering.
" fhe joint effort with Stanford, which is recognized
to have among the strongest environmental engineer
ing program in the world, will attract the best students
to the program, thus augmenting NTU's drive to be
among the very best in environmental engineering ed
ucation and research worldwide," he said.
Stanford's most ambitious collaboration with NTU,
the Clean Water Program, has already begun. The
program aims to increase Singapore's water indepen
dence by filling an artificial aquifer to decrease the
country's reliance on Malaysian water supplies.
"From what we know, [the partnership] and [water
research project] form the only comprehensive post
graduate education and research program ever avail
able in this part of the world," Cheong said.
Currently Singapore, a small island nation, imports
more than half of its water through a politically con
tentious arrangement with Malaysia.
Started last year, the research initiative takes Stan
ford's expertise in refilling natural aquifers, especially
in Southern California and applies this knowledge to a
new problem — tilling an artificial aquifer in a filled
bay.
The Singaporean airport is built on a portion of this
aquifer, which is 30 square kilometers in size.
"What's new is that the land itself in this case is arti
ficial," said Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
