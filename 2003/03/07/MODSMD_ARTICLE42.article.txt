# 'Smallville' gives few thrills
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
A TV soundtrack is a curious thing:
II the show it's based <>n is compelling
enough, the album becomes the perfect

companion piece, a mix

tape that reminds you
ol key moments from
the series and maybe
even what was going

ou in vour own life

when you were watching certain
episodes.
Enter then the Smallville soundtrack, a
curious collection of mainstream singles
that barely manages to evoke a favorable
impression ofthe hit WB show. The prob
lem isn't that "Smallville" itself isn't mov
ing enough, as avid fans can readily attest;
that torturous unconsummated love af
fair between (-lark Kent and Lana Lang
(ingenuously played by Tom Welling and
Kristin Kreuk) as well as the intriguing
friendship between Clark and badboy
Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) is
more than enough to keep me tuned in
every week.
The real problem lies with the fact that
every episode of "Smallville" is stuffed to
the brim with music, short snippets of
laser-guided marketing opportunities de
signed to promote as many artists as pos
sible within the show's hour-long time
slot. I remember reading somewhere that
"Smallville" crams in more artists per

show than any other teen drama, and this
is definitely not something to be proud of;
we're bombarded with so much noise that
it's hard to identify specific music with the
show.

That the album
boasts big-name artists
is as much a selling
point as a weakness.

not the five seconds it was played while
Clark was baling hay during an early
episode of Season Two. ()tlier pop music
junkies will be equally torn with other
singles they've heard before. "Nuclear" is
off Adams' "Demolition" album, while
Sixpence None the Richer's cover of
"Don't Dream it's Over" seems tossed in
like an afterthought trying to cash in on
all those recent romantic comedies
that've been featuring it in trailers. And
Five for Fighting's "Superman" is includ
ed so shamelessly that I cringed every
time I skipped over it.
Of course, the singles I haven't previ
ously heard do come off like discoveries.
Phantom Planet's "Lonely Day" is charm
ing enough in and of itself , though I have
no idea when it was used in the show.
Likewise, cuts from The Flaming Lips
("Fight Test") and AM Radio ("1 Just
Wanna Be Loved") are pleasant and fit in
with the clean, radio-friendly atmosphere

of the album. The album smartly book
ends its material with songs most easily
identifiable with the show: Remy Zero's
"Save Me" from the show's title sequence
kicks it all off, while Lifehouse's "Every
thing" (used effectively in the pilot
episode) and Eva Cassidy's cover of
"Time after Time" make fora poignant
ending.
After a few listens, it's hard to stay mad
at the music. The only thing that really
smarts is the feeling you've been had by
another marketing gimmick, because
nothing in the package feels entirely
unique to "Smallville." The CD insert
seems set against recreating the "Small
ville" experience for you — instead of ex-

elusive cast photos or liner notes from the
creators, it folds out to just list the song
writing credits. Even the enhanced CI)
features are a bust, with nothing more
than a few video clips of live performances
and an exclusive link to a Web site featur
ing an appallingly bad "interactive" map
ofSmallville.
The final straw: with each CD comes a
collector card featuring one of the three
principle cast members. So now to add to
my feelings of emptiness, I've got my offi
cial Lex Luthor trading card to look at,
with Michael Rosenbaum's shiny bald
pate mocking me. Come on, Elektra
Records, isn't it obvious that the only card
worth having is Lana's?
