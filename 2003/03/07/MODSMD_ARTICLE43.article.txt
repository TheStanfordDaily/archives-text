# Bees: It's a sweet, sweet, sunshiney day
## 
### JENNY ZHANG 
If musical tastes are any indicator of
food preferences, then Paul Butler and
Aaron Fletcher from A Band of Bees
certainly could never dine with my
friend Frank, who eats chicken, rice and
carrot sticks without fail every night. On
their North American debut, "Sunshine
Hit Me," the duo hailing from the
British Isle of Wight have an agenda fo
cused on various ways of retrieving sun
shine, breeze and clouds from fuzzy gui
tars, smooth horns and tinkling
melodies.
The first track. "Punchbag," leels like
the end of a day at the carnival — laying
on the grass and staring up at the twin
kling stars. The piano arpeggios are
sweetly pitted against the nonchalant
trumpet, while the lyrics implore the lis
tener to "use me like a punchbag."
"Angryman" bounces in with falsetto
vocals and funked-up guitars in an
earnest attempt to evoke Curtis May
field but unfortunately fails to achieve

even Beck's status on "Midnight Vul
tures." "No Trophy" begs the listener to
believe Butler and Fletcher are actually
from the Caribbean Isles. When they
sing, "Ask the riverman where the river
flows / Ask the postman who he knows,"
they may as well be singing about the
Banana Boat, in consistency with the
lack of novelty in the song's reggae
rhythms.
The summer carnival theme comes

back in "Binnel Bay," which sounds like
a smoked-out party under a tent. "A
Minha Menina" is a cover, infusing the
original by Os Mutantes with youthful,
loving insouciance. It reminded me of
the scene from "Charlotte's Web" when
Fern imagines sitting on the top of the
ferris wheel with Henry. Had the Bees

arrived on the scene, they would have
surely started singing, "Kla e o men
amour!"
Joyfulness is partially abandoned on

the second halfof the album. "Sweet like
a Champion" employs sleepy guitars
and hushed vocals, while "Lying in the
Snow" is a venture into subtle psyche
delic musing, "Why is it so/Just looking
at it from the window/Only the young
ones know."
The true gems of this album are the

two mostly instrumental pieces, "Sun
shine" and "Sky Holds the Sun." The
rippling water-meets-space sound of
"Sunshine" gently brings to mind Air's
"Moon Safari," and the only lyric, "sun
shine," is sung through a haze of piano,
horns and cymbals, rendering the audi
tory version of sun rays breaking past
clouds. The last track, "Sky Holds the
Sun," is all about romance and sharing

cotton candy while the sun sets. Slowed
down horns and the flat longing of "I
wanna hold you like the sky holds the
sun" fit right into Bacharach's sound
track to Butch Cassidy and the Sun
dance Kid.
Though "Sunshine Hit Me" takes
leaps into predictable flatness as in the

uninspiring "No Trophy" and over-in
dulgence, shown in the sweltering raw
ness of "You Got to Leave," the album
overall is delightful trip to the carnival
on a warm, breezy summer day. In fact,
the next time my parents call me from
New York, complaining of the six inch
es of snow they have to shovel in tour
degree weather, 1 might just FedEx
them "Sunshine 1 lit Me."
