# Finch guitarist Alex Linares tells us what's cool
## 
### DINA WALLIN 
Although they're on (lie stereotypic ullv punk lalx-l Drive
Thru, Finch is anything but your stereotypical punk band.
On their disc "What it is to Burn" (2002), one can hear not
only hard r<x:k influences from bands like the Deftones and
Taproot, but also the pop punk characteristic of other Drive
Thru bands like New Found Glory. Hailing from Teinecu
la, Calif., Finch played a sold-out show at Slim's in San Fran
cisco on Feb. 27 as one of die last stops on its current tour with
label mates the Movielife. Finch is composed of frontman
Nate Barcalow, drummer Alex Pappas, bassist Derek Doher
tv, and guitarists Randy Strohmeyer and .Alex Linares. In
termissit in was able to catch up with Linares as the band read
ied itself to play a show in Portland on Feb. 26.
.After they wrap up this U.S. tour in Hollywood on March
3, Finch will tour in England for two weeks, then stay home
for several months to write, Then it's a two-week stint on the
Vans Warped Tour this summer, and a new album should
be released in January 2004.
INTERMISSION: So, there are a bunch of different genres
present in the band's music. What would you say, as a musi
cian, are your personal main influences?
ALEX LINARES My personal main influences? Probably
more so than music would be, like, personal experiences...
if something just puts me in a mood, even just watching a
movie, it 'll make me want to pick up a guitar, strumming on
something, or, maybe having a tight with my girlfriend'U
make me pick up my guitar and stall strumming something
... you know, I II rarely ever get inspired by another band's
music to pick up my guitar and write a song. It's more, like,
daily things, you know?
INTERMISSION: What's in your CD player right now?
AL: Right now... urn, I actually don't have a CD player, I
have like, an MP3 player.
INTERMISSION: Oh, fancy...
AL: Yeah, we're high tech in Finch! (Laughs) But what have
I been listening t0... lately I've been re-buying ;tll my old
records and stuff like that; I just bought Soundgarden, like
Superunknown, "Siamese Dream" by Smashing Pumpkins,
;uid "Purple" by Stone Temple Pilots, like bands I used to love
when I was in junior high.
INTERMISSION: A lot of your band's songs are ;ill about
pretty hard core relationships.
AL: Not necessarily. I wouldn't always assume that all our
songs are about girls and stuff, but a lot ofthe songs are about
kindasick twisted things that you would never even think it's
about... I wish I could answer for Nate, because it's his mind,
and ;ill this stuff came out of his head, but, I don't know...a lot
of (nil s< >ngs are really twisted, but you can't really tell, because
he does it in such ... a respective manner, 1 guess? Because
he doesn't use, like, foul language, or he doesn't try tol)e too
mysterious about it; [with] the pictures he paints with his
lyrics, it seems like they're girl songs, or songs about relation
ships and stuff like that, but most ofthe time they're really lar
from it.
INTERMISSK )N: What's your favorite part of being on the
road?
AL: My favorite part of being on the road... is going home.
(Laughs) No, I'm kidding, I guess my favorite part of being
on the road is finding a really cool record store and buying
cool records and meeting up with ;dl my friends that I have in
different cities; I always have a g<xxl time. I usually look for
ward to a certain city by whether a friend's gonna be there, ya
know?
INTERMISSK)N: How are your family and old friends re
ading to you and your guys' fame?
AL: (Liughs)l think they're taking it, uni, pi ettv good. All my
family's really, really proud of me, y'know? They're always so
excited when I come home, and I tell them stories about the
recent tour, or I tell them how the band's going. Everyone's
super supportive.
INTERMISSION: Overall, no relationships have l)een
strained or awkward by you guys becoming so big?
AL: Ican't really speak for the rest ofmy band, but I know per
sonally that my relationship with my girlfriend is really strong,
and 1 think, we just have to keep open communication. We
have a talk for hours a day, just to soita make up for the lack

of me not Ijeinghome and stuff
INTERMISSK )N: So, what do you and the band do to get
up for the show?
AL: To, like get pumped up or whatever? ()i just like get
ready? Well, usually, my preshow whatever is. like, I iron my
T -shirt so it won't Ix* wrinkled (laughs), and then 1 usuallv
change into whatever clothes I'm wearing for the night, and
then I listen to some kind of music... lately I've been listen
ing to A Perfect Circle sometimes before I play, and that's
about it. We just hang out backstage, before we go on, we
make jokes, make fun of each other, and then we go play.
INTERMISSION: What about coming down after the
show? Will you guys lie hanging around in the bars in San
Francisco tomorrow night?
AL: (Laughs) Um, no, I'm straightedge, so you won't find me
in any bars... I'll buy you a drink though, if you want, ()K?...
I just turned 21 the other day, so I'm legal to go into bars now.
I wish 1 was a drinker, so I could actually appreciate becom
ing 21.
INTERMISSION: Randy, in past interviews, has described
yourmusicas"fiick-you-uprock." What is your personal goal
with the music ofthe band?
AL: Uummm... I don't know... it's really g<xxl music, so I
guess whatever lalx-l works works, you know? I just think, I
don't think... aaah, shit, I hate this question! It always gets
you so flustered! I try to really describe it, what our feelings are
and stuff. We ;ill just really like music and love the textures of
music and the sound of music, and the soundscapes you can
create with music, and we're rock, but we ;ilso aspire to be
more than just rock. We like ambient stuff like Bjork and stuff
like Mono and Supersonic. Right now, I think we might be
fuck-you-up rock, but maybe on the next record we'll Ix- a lit
tle different.
INTERMISSION: OK, tell me something cool about your
self.
AL: Something cool about myself... um, I worship the devil.
INTERMISSION: Co<xx)l... that's, uh, interesting.
AL: (Laughs) That would be funny, wouldn't it. I'm kidding,
I don't worship the devil. Something cool about myself... I
don't know. I don't think I really am that cool. I'm a pretty
bland person. But not, shit, I don't want to make myself

"Don't think I don't
indulge
... 1 was just in a porno
store 10 minutes before I
spoke to you."

sound like a dork. Uh, I'm 21. (Laughs) That's about it. I'm
21, I'm Cuban, 1 live in San Diego, California, that's about as
interesting as I get. That's me in a nutshell, I think. r Hiat's ac
tually ill)' whole band, pretty much.
INTERMISSION: What's your favorite food?
AL: Most of the time it's Mexican food. San Diego's the
best place fora bean burrito â€” or any kind of Mexican
food, really. I find myself eating burritos constantly.
Have you ever seen the episode of "The Osbornes"
where Ozzy is eating burritos all day long? That's me
when I'm home. (Laughs)
INTERMISSION: Would you rather be able to fly, or
be invisible at will?
AL: Ummm ... holy shit, that's such a good question.
Man, fly or be invisible ... I think I'd rather fly, because
what good can you do with being invisible? Sneak into
bank vaults or something? I'm not much for stealing.
You could get into girls' locker rooms, but I'm not that
much of a pervert! I don't know, (laughs)
INTERMISSION: This is great, "The Devil Worship
per Who's Not a Pervert." That'll be my headline.
AL: Don't think 1 don't indulge. . . like, I was just in a
porno store ten minutes before I spoke to you. (Laughs)

ready? Well, usually, my preshow whatever is. like, I iron my
T -shirt so it won't Ix* wrinkled (laughs), and then 1 usuallv
change into whatever clothes I'm wearing for the night, and
then I listen to some kind of music... lately I've been listen
ing to A Perfect Circle sometimes before I play, and that's
about it. We just hang out backstage, before we go on, we
make jokes, make fun of each other, and then we go play.
INTERMISSION: What about coming down after the
show? Will you guys lie hanging around in the bars in San
Francisco tomorrow night?
AL: (Laughs) Um, no, I'm straightedge, so you won't find me
in any bars... I'll buy you a drink though, if you want, ()K?...
I just turned 21 the other day, so I'm legal to go into bars now.
I wish 1 was a drinker, so I could actually appreciate becom
ing 21.
INTERMISSION: Randy, in past interviews, has described
yourmusicas"fiick-you-uprock." What is your personal goal
with the music ofthe band?
AL: Uummm... I don't know... it's really g<xxl music, so I
guess whatever lalx-l works works, you know? I just think, I
don't think... aaah, shit, I hate this question! It always gets
you so flustered! I try to really describe it, what our feelings are
and stuff. We ;ill just really like music and love the textures of
music and the sound of music, and the soundscapes you can
create with music, and we're rock, but we ;ilso aspire to be
more than just rock. We like ambient stuff like Bjork and stuff
like Mono and Supersonic. Right now, I think we might be
fuck-you-up rock, but maybe on the next record we'll Ix- a lit
tle different.
INTERMISSION: OK, tell me something cool about your
self.
AL: Something cool about myself... um, I worship the devil.
INTERMISSION: Co<xx)l... that's, uh, interesting.
AL: (Laughs) That would be funny, wouldn't it. I'm kidding,
I don't worship the devil. Something cool about myself... I
don't know. I don't think I really am that cool. I'm a pretty
bland person. But not, shit, I don't want to make myself

"Don't think I don't

sound like a dork. Uh, I'm 21. (Laughs) That's about it. I'm
21, I'm Cuban, 1 live in San Diego, California, that's about as
interesting as I get. That's me in a nutshell, I think. r Hiat's ac
tually ill)' whole band, pretty much.
INTERMISSION: What's your favorite food?
AL: Most of the time it's Mexican food. San Diego's the
best place fora bean burrito â€” or any kind of Mexican
food, really. I find myself eating burritos constantly.
Have you ever seen the episode of "The Osbornes"
where Ozzy is eating burritos all day long? That's me
when I'm home. (Laughs)
INTERMISSION: Would you rather be able to fly, or
be invisible at will?
AL: Ummm ... holy shit, that's such a good question.
Man, fly or be invisible ... I think I'd rather fly, because
what good can you do with being invisible? Sneak into
bank vaults or something? I'm not much for stealing.
You could get into girls' locker rooms, but I'm not that
much of a pervert! I don't know, (laughs)
INTERMISSION: This is great, "The Devil Worship
per Who's Not a Pervert." That'll be my headline.
AL: Don't think 1 don't indulge. . . like, I was just in a
porno store ten minutes before I spoke to you. (Laughs)


Devil worshippers? Why are we not surprised?
Although they're on (lie stereotypic ullv punk lalx-l Drive
Thru, Finch is anything but your stereotypical punk band.
On their disc "What it is to Burn" (2002), one can hear not
only hard r<x:k influences from bands like the Deftones and
Taproot, but also the pop punk characteristic of other Drive
Thru bands like New Found Glory. Hailing from Teinecu
la, Calif., Finch played a sold-out show at Slim's in San Fran
cisco on Feb. 27 as one of die last stops on its current tour with
label mates the Movielife. Finch is composed of frontman
Nate Barcalow, drummer Alex Pappas, bassist Derek Doher
tv, and guitarists Randy Strohmeyer and .Alex Linares. In
termissit in was able to catch up with Linares as the band read
ied itself to play a show in Portland on Feb. 26.
.After they wrap up this U.S. tour in Hollywood on March
3, Finch will tour in England for two weeks, then stay home
for several months to write, Then it's a two-week stint on the
Vans Warped Tour this summer, and a new album should
be released in January 2004.
INTERMISSION: So, there are a bunch of different genres
present in the band's music. What would you say, as a musi
cian, are your personal main influences?
ALEX LINARES My personal main influences? Probably
more so than music would be, like, personal experiences...
if something just puts me in a mood, even just watching a
movie, it 'll make me want to pick up a guitar, strumming on
something, or, maybe having a tight with my girlfriend'U
make me pick up my guitar and stall strumming something
... you know, I II rarely ever get inspired by another band's
music to pick up my guitar and write a song. It's more, like,
daily things, you know?
INTERMISSION: What's in your CD player right now?
AL: Right now... urn, I actually don't have a CD player, I
have like, an MP3 player.
INTERMISSION: Oh, fancy...
AL: Yeah, we're high tech in Finch! (Laughs) But what have
I been listening t0... lately I've been re-buying ;tll my old
records and stuff like that; I just bought Soundgarden, like
Superunknown, "Siamese Dream" by Smashing Pumpkins,
;uid "Purple" by Stone Temple Pilots, like bands I used to love
when I was in junior high.
INTERMISSION: A lot of your band's songs are ;ill about
pretty hard core relationships.
AL: Not necessarily. I wouldn't always assume that all our
songs are about girls and stuff, but a lot ofthe songs are about
kindasick twisted things that you would never even think it's
about... I wish I could answer for Nate, because it's his mind,
and ;ill this stuff came out of his head, but, I don't know...a lot
of (nil s< >ngs are really twisted, but you can't really tell, because
he does it in such ... a respective manner, 1 guess? Because
he doesn't use, like, foul language, or he doesn't try tol)e too
mysterious about it; [with] the pictures he paints with his
lyrics, it seems like they're girl songs, or songs about relation
ships and stuff like that, but most ofthe time they're really lar
from it.
INTERMISSK )N: What's your favorite part of being on the
road?
AL: My favorite part of being on the road... is going home.
(Laughs) No, I'm kidding, I guess my favorite part of being
on the road is finding a really cool record store and buying
cool records and meeting up with ;dl my friends that I have in
different cities; I always have a g<xxl time. I usually look for
ward to a certain city by whether a friend's gonna be there, ya
know?
INTERMISSK)N: How are your family and old friends re
ading to you and your guys' fame?
AL: (Liughs)l think they're taking it, uni, pi ettv good. All my
family's really, really proud of me, y'know? They're always so
excited when I come home, and I tell them stories about the
recent tour, or I tell them how the band's going. Everyone's
super supportive.
INTERMISSION: Overall, no relationships have l)een
strained or awkward by you guys becoming so big?
AL: Ican't really speak for the rest ofmy band, but I know per
sonally that my relationship with my girlfriend is really strong,
and 1 think, we just have to keep open communication. We
have a talk for hours a day, just to soita make up for the lack

of me not Ijeinghome and stuff
INTERMISSK )N: So, what do you and the band do to get
up for the show?
AL: To, like get pumped up or whatever? ()i just like get
ready? Well, usually, my preshow whatever is. like, I iron my
T -shirt so it won't Ix* wrinkled (laughs), and then 1 usuallv
