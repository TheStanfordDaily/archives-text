# Rockers Chevelle keep it in the family
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
I can't place my finger on it, but in
this age of Making-the-Band and post-
Bee Gees irony, there's something
truly wholesome about brother bands.
If The Ramones and The White
Stripes made me suspicious of the
whole we're-a-rocking-family trend,
then it was Hanson in the '90s that
convinced me that that great social en
terprise was well and alive.
There was one slight problem,
though: Hanson sucked.
It was with that pleasant observa
tion that I began my interview with
Chevelle's bassist Joe Loeffler last
week. Chevelle, a band comprised of
three brothers — Pete (vocals, guitar),
Joe (bass) and Sam (drums) — is cur
rently wading through swamps of
sludge-guitar to establish itself as one
of the rising stars in the business. The
band's credentials are fairly impres
sive: They will share the main stage in
Ozzfest with the likes of Koßn and
Marilyn Manson, and their sopho
more effort, "Wonder What's Next,"
debuted at number 14 on the Bill
board Charts.
What makes this surprising is that
the album arrived three years after
their debut — a period of creative
limbo and legal tussles that led up to
the band's signing with Epic.
Listening to the CD, it's hard to
shake the feeling that Chevelle is "Tool
for Tummies" — manufacturers of a
tastier, more digestible form of prog
metal. It is also painfully evident that
the polished singles "Send The Pain
Below" and"The Red" will be over
played and stale in a few months —
but to their credit, both these songs fea
ture tremendous hooks and earnest
lyrics. Lead vocalist Pete suffers
through temporary emasculation in
the verses to heighten the start-stop
dynamics at play, and he's got a tired,
Chino Mareno anguish in his voice.

The brothers openly cite Tool and
Helmet as their major influences.
Clearly, Chevelle are no Hanson
but as a nu-metal band, they're so
stripped of pretension that their whole
someness is disconcerting; the sum of
their three personalities is a cold, hard
rock consensus— not a noisy back
yard tussle or a brotherly brawl.
Watching Chevelle live at the Edge
(formerly Icon) Nightclub in Palo Alto
only strengthened my theory that this
is a band yet to outgrow its obvious in
fluences. Still, the clean-shaven Pete,
Joe and Sam delivered a great profes
sional set and their music was greeted
by a significant bustle in the impro
vised mosh-pit. My only complaint?
The vacuum on the record that lets
Pete's plaintive melodies slip over the
guitars was absent, and the songs were
weakened as a result.
' The highlight of my evening was
watching a half-drunk old dude bal
ance a dollar bill on the tip of his nose
as he stumbled around the bar in a
metal-induced daze. He was truly awe
some. Now, if only all of my articles
were filled with such wonderful
metaphors for the state of rock music
in this country.
Intermission: Seeing that you guys are
a band of three brothers, I'm going to
ask you the first question that came to
my mind — were you inspired by
Hanson?
Joe: [laughs] What, are you kidding?
Intermission: No, seriously, what's
your take on Hanson?
Joe : I have a Hanson T-shirt that I
wear. My take on them is that when 1
first heard them I tried not to throw
up, but since then I love them because
they're a brother band. I haven't heard
any of their music except for "Mmm
bop."
Intermission: So, your album de
buted at number 14 on the Billboard
charts.. .

Joe: Number 14, baby.
Intermission: Were you guys sur
prised that it debuted at that spot after
three years of being out of the scene?
Joe: We are very, very happy now that
it's gone Gold and sold over 500,000..
. you know, my guess (I'm always cor
rect in these) is that we're going to be
platinum in March; that's within two
weeks. Well, 1 might be wrong and it
might be a few more weeks, but I heard
that very soon they're going to tell us
it's platinum.
Intermission: So, how do you measure
success of your band?
Joe: It's gotta be album sales, it's gotta be
radio, and it's gotta be MTV. And then
there's touring. One of the biggest ways
to tell the success of your band is tour
ing, because that's how the band makes
money — touring and merchandise. So
when we can go and do a headlining
tour and sell everywhere out, then we
can tell that things are good.
Intermission: Do you guys think of
yourselves as a Christian band? I no
ticed that you guys are listed under
several Christian band Web sites.
Joe: Yes, that's weird, that's really
weird. You know, they just grab onto
anyone they want to. I mean, it's kinda
like, Shania Twain is trying to cross
over, she's put out pop music but the
country scene will still latch on to her
because she used to play country
music, but us, it doesn't make any
sense because we never did anything
different from what we're doing right
now. The only reason is that we signed
to a company that was really a bad
company — really bad — and they
shipped us to the Christian stores, and
that's the only thing that we've ever
done like that. People still ask us every
day, "Are you guys a Christian band?"
Intermission: I heard "The Red" is
going to be featured on "Now That's
What I Call Music, Volume 12 — it's
gonna be in the middle of all these pop
songs. What's your take on that?
Joe: I think it's awesome. I think it's
hilarious. Like the funniest thing ever.
Friggin' Backstreet Boys and
*NSYNC and then "The Red," it's re
ally funny. I'm excited about that. I
don't care, you know people are like,
"You don't wanna be friggin' main
stream." but you know, if we're with
those other bands that suck, and if you
think that we don't, well then that's
cool, you know?
Intermission: How was the experi
ence of making the video for"The
Red"? Had you guys done a video be
fore?
Joe: We had done two videos before
that. It was good. 1 really love Nathan
"Karma" Cox, the director, he's a
good friend of Jonathan Davis. Actu
ally, it's pretty funny. We're gonna
meet them on Wednesday. We're
going to the Osbourne house on
Wednesday, and Jonathan Davis is
going to be there and so is David from
Disturbed and Marilyn Manson.

Intermission: You guys performed at
the OzzFest also recently, how was
that?
Joe: Last year, second stage was great.
It was really good. Big shows, big tour,
big places and lotsa tight people we
met. Yeah, lots of good friends from
OzzFest.
Intermission: Who are you sharing
the stage with this year?
Joe: Yeah, Koßn, Disturbed and Mar
ilyn Manson.
Intermission: Whoa.
Joe: Why would they put us with all
these bands that are so much smaller
than us? That's what I keep thinking.
And who the heck is Ozzy, Black Sab
bath? I don't know.
Intermission: Yeah, he sounds kinda
familiar, but I can't really place him.
Joe: I think he had some late-night TV
show or something.
Intermission: What stuff have you
been listening to?
Joe: Enya.
Intermission: Enya?
Joe : And the Bears *85, the sound
track. The Bears song, what the heck is
it called? I can't remember.. . Super-
Bowl Shuffle, that's what that's called.
Intermission So I'm guessing that the
Bears are the biggest influence in your
music?
Joe: Yeah, The Bears.
Intermission: They're pretty bad.
Joe What? I have a division champi
onship shirt from last year.
Intermission: Since your record is
called "Wonder What's Next," I won
der, what's next?
Joe: Do you wonder, or do I have to?
Intermission: All of us wonder, the
whole world collectively, wonders
what's next.
Joe: [laughs] What's next is big crap.
There's big crap coming up — you
know Ozzfest, another headlining tour
next year, a new single, then a single
after that . . . it's gonna keep getting
bigger.

Intermission: So, how do you measure
success of your band?
Joe: It's gotta be album sales, it's gotta be
radio, and it's gotta be MTV. And then
there's touring. One of the biggest ways
to tell the success of your band is tour
ing, because that's how the band makes
money — touring and merchandise. So
when we can go and do a headlining
tour and sell everywhere out, then we
can tell that things are good.
Intermission: Do you guys think of
yourselves as a Christian band? I no
ticed that you guys are listed under
several Christian band Web sites.
Joe: Yes, that's weird, that's really
weird. You know, they just grab onto
anyone they want to. I mean, it's kinda
like, Shania Twain is trying to cross
over, she's put out pop music but the
country scene will still latch on to her
because she used to play country
music, but us, it doesn't make any
sense because we never did anything
different from what we're doing right
now. The only reason is that we signed
to a company that was really a bad
company — really bad — and they
shipped us to the Christian stores, and
that's the only thing that we've ever
done like that. People still ask us every
day, "Are you guys a Christian band?"
Intermission: I heard "The Red" is
going to be featured on "Now That's
What I Call Music, Volume 12 — it's
gonna be in the middle of all these pop
songs. What's your take on that?
Joe: I think it's awesome. I think it's
hilarious. Like the funniest thing ever.
Friggin' Backstreet Boys and
*NSYNC and then "The Red," it's re
ally funny. I'm excited about that. I
don't care, you know people are like,
"You don't wanna be friggin' main
stream." but you know, if we're with
those other bands that suck, and if you
think that we don't, well then that's
cool, you know?
Intermission: How was the experi
ence of making the video for"The
Red"? Had you guys done a video be
fore?
Joe: We had done two videos before
that. It was good. 1 really love Nathan
"Karma" Cox, the director, he's a
good friend of Jonathan Davis. Actu
ally, it's pretty funny. We're gonna
meet them on Wednesday. We're
going to the Osbourne house on
Wednesday, and Jonathan Davis is
going to be there and so is David from
Disturbed and Marilyn Manson.

Intermission: You guys performed at
the OzzFest also recently, how was
that?
Joe: Last year, second stage was great.
It was really good. Big shows, big tour,
big places and lotsa tight people we
met. Yeah, lots of good friends from
OzzFest.
Intermission: Who are you sharing
the stage with this year?
Joe: Yeah, Koßn, Disturbed and Mar
ilyn Manson.
Intermission: Whoa.
Joe: Why would they put us with all
these bands that are so much smaller
than us? That's what I keep thinking.
And who the heck is Ozzy, Black Sab
bath? I don't know.
Intermission: Yeah, he sounds kinda
familiar, but I can't really place him.
Joe: I think he had some late-night TV
show or something.
Intermission: What stuff have you
been listening to?
Joe: Enya.
Intermission: Enya?
Joe : And the Bears *85, the sound
track. The Bears song, what the heck is
it called? I can't remember.. . Super-
Bowl Shuffle, that's what that's called.
Intermission So I'm guessing that the
Bears are the biggest influence in your
music?
Joe: Yeah, The Bears.
Intermission: They're pretty bad.
Joe What? I have a division champi
onship shirt from last year.
Intermission: Since your record is
called "Wonder What's Next," I won
der, what's next?
Joe: Do you wonder, or do I have to?
Intermission: All of us wonder, the
whole world collectively, wonders
what's next.
Joe: [laughs] What's next is big crap.
There's big crap coming up — you
know Ozzfest, another headlining tour
next year, a new single, then a single
after that . . . it's gonna keep getting
bigger.


They can say what they will, but this is a very Hanson-eque pose


Joe Chevelle, in the flesh.
I can't place my finger on it, but in
this age of Making-the-Band and post-
Bee Gees irony, there's something
truly wholesome about brother bands.
If The Ramones and The White
Stripes made me suspicious of the
whole we're-a-rocking-family trend,
then it was Hanson in the '90s that
convinced me that that great social en
terprise was well and alive.
There was one slight problem,
though: Hanson sucked.
It was with that pleasant observa
tion that I began my interview with
Chevelle's bassist Joe Loeffler last
week. Chevelle, a band comprised of
three brothers — Pete (vocals, guitar),
Joe (bass) and Sam (drums) — is cur
rently wading through swamps of
sludge-guitar to establish itself as one
of the rising stars in the business. The
band's credentials are fairly impres
sive: They will share the main stage in
Ozzfest with the likes of Koßn and
Marilyn Manson, and their sopho
more effort, "Wonder What's Next,"
debuted at number 14 on the Bill
board Charts.
What makes this surprising is that
the album arrived three years after
their debut — a period of creative
limbo and legal tussles that led up to
the band's signing with Epic.
Listening to the CD, it's hard to
shake the feeling that Chevelle is "Tool
for Tummies" — manufacturers of a
tastier, more digestible form of prog
metal. It is also painfully evident that
the polished singles "Send The Pain
Below" and"The Red" will be over
played and stale in a few months —
but to their credit, both these songs fea
ture tremendous hooks and earnest
lyrics. Lead vocalist Pete suffers
through temporary emasculation in
the verses to heighten the start-stop
dynamics at play, and he's got a tired,
Chino Mareno anguish in his voice.

The brothers openly cite Tool and
Helmet as their major influences.
Clearly, Chevelle are no Hanson
but as a nu-metal band, they're so
stripped of pretension that their whole
someness is disconcerting; the sum of
their three personalities is a cold, hard
rock consensus— not a noisy back
yard tussle or a brotherly brawl.
Watching Chevelle live at the Edge
(formerly Icon) Nightclub in Palo Alto
only strengthened my theory that this
is a band yet to outgrow its obvious in
fluences. Still, the clean-shaven Pete,
Joe and Sam delivered a great profes
sional set and their music was greeted
by a significant bustle in the impro
vised mosh-pit. My only complaint?
The vacuum on the record that lets
Pete's plaintive melodies slip over the
guitars was absent, and the songs were
weakened as a result.
' The highlight of my evening was
watching a half-drunk old dude bal
ance a dollar bill on the tip of his nose
as he stumbled around the bar in a
metal-induced daze. He was truly awe
some. Now, if only all of my articles
were filled with such wonderful
metaphors for the state of rock music
in this country.
Intermission: Seeing that you guys are
a band of three brothers, I'm going to
ask you the first question that came to
my mind — were you inspired by
Hanson?
Joe: [laughs] What, are you kidding?
Intermission: No, seriously, what's
your take on Hanson?
Joe : I have a Hanson T-shirt that I
wear. My take on them is that when 1
first heard them I tried not to throw
up, but since then I love them because
they're a brother band. I haven't heard
any of their music except for "Mmm
bop."
Intermission: So, your album de
buted at number 14 on the Billboard
charts.. .

Joe: Number 14, baby.
Intermission: Were you guys sur
prised that it debuted at that spot after
three years of being out of the scene?
Joe: We are very, very happy now that
it's gone Gold and sold over 500,000..
. you know, my guess (I'm always cor
rect in these) is that we're going to be
platinum in March; that's within two
weeks. Well, 1 might be wrong and it
might be a few more weeks, but I heard
that very soon they're going to tell us
it's platinum.
