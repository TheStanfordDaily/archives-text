# The
						world according to Miho
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
Milio Hatori is best known as one half of the
brilliant and experimental band that is
Cibo Matto. After touring extensively,
riding high on critical praise for their
genre-blending masterpiece "Stereotype A," the duo
has gone on hiatus while their supporting members
pursue solo projects. Not one to ever stop challenging
herself, Hatori lias been involved with various organi
zations and has done collaborations with some of
today's most exciting musicians. If you've been listen
ing to the right albums, you know Miho's voice from
tracks with the Beastie Boys and on cartoon-concept
rockers Gorillaz's smash hit, "19-2000."
Hatori's latest project, Smokey and Miho, is the
product of a longtime friendship with Smokey
Hormel, guitarist extraordinaire, who has played
with Tom Waits and frequently tours with Beck. To
gether, with backing vocals by Ganda, horns by Jon
Birdsong and percussion by Mauro Refosco, the
band plays beautiful bossa nova and tropicalia
music, mixing compositions by Brazilian greats such
as Baden Powell, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jorge
Ben with their own original songs. I was lucky to see
the band first in January 2002 at the Make-Out
Room and again this past month at the Great Amer

ican Music Hall.
Last week, Hatori was nice enough to chat with me
on the phone for an hour. She fielded questions about
the origins of Smokey and Miho and her feelings on
the looming war with Iraq, slightly side-stepped an
swering about the fate of Cibo Matto and even gave
me some tips on places to visit in Kyoto for my coming
study abroad.
INTERMISSION: My only exposure to Brazilian
music was my mother's Sergio Mendes albums, but I
was wondering, when did you develop an interest in
Brazilian music — was it in Japan or in the United
States?
MIHO HATORI: It was in Japan. Growing up in
Japan, you can't avoid Brazilian music because a lot of
Japanese pop music, especially in the '70s, was influ
enced 112 rom Brazilian music. I guess bossa nova really
makes sense with Japanese language. Japanese and
Portuguese have a lot of similar sounds, so it flows
with the notes of bossa nova. So that's the reason it's
very familiar to people who love music over there, I
think. It was not just a strictly bossa nova anything, it's
more like a Japanese pop music style.

INTERMISSION: I heard that you and Smokey met
when Beck and Cibo Matto toured together. I was
wondering how the band came about? Were you just
planning to make one album? Because it's turned into
something so much bigger...
HATORI: You know, the beginning was just writing
songs. Smokey had an idea and when he moved to
New York, we started. And when we are making a
couple songs, Baden Powell died. So, we decided to
have one gig just dedicated to Baden Powell and to
learn his songs; especially we are obsessed with that
one Baden Powell and Vinicus de Moraes album,
called "()s Afro Sambas." That album basically
changed my life, and Smokey too. We just felt, 'What
is this? Why was this sleeping here? Why didn't it
come out in the world more?' So we learned every
song from the album and we played a show in a down
town club called Tonic. And that was the starting and
once we played and learned these songs, we wanna
make it better and better. 1 wanted to sing Portuguese
more better. It's a great book of music, so we just keep
continuing to try it and that's the reason we made the
second EP ail songs of Baden Powell.

INTERMISSION: At the Great American
concert, yon guys seemed a lot more confi
dent than in January with the songs and the
lyrics.
HATORI: It is very challenging because
there are a lot of people doing Brazilian music
from Brazil, you know? I bet people have fear,
and yeah, I have fear — Yes, I don't speak
Portuguese at all. But I love to sing, and of
course 1 have heavy accent, but I feel like im
portant thing for music is joy. And that's
something I feel, yon know, all my experi
ence, my experience with Cibo Matto and
being in a record company and having tour
and stuff in the music business world, but now
1 feel... Hip-hop world is changing so much
and it's something I feel like I don't connect to
already. Like, back in time, I really felt con
nected; when I listened to Beastie Boys I real
ly felt like, "Yeah! No Sleep Till Brooklyn,
man!" you know? But now I think like a lot of
stuff— maybe I'm getting old or something?
— but I really feel like an outsider from that
big business.
Something about it, I don't feel connection to
the mainstream music. Then, somehow I start
to feel like this (band) is really not mainstream
or anything, more like an underground feel
ing. I felt this really pure love for music; This
is something I really love to try with my old
music friends. It is really great — every time
we play we have the amazing, amazing bright
ness in our heart and that's something I real
ly enjoy.
INTERMISSION: It seems like most Ameri
can bands won't usually venture into singing
in another language. Like those old Nat King
Cole albums in Spanish — you know that the
pronunciation is wrong, but it has this certain
something to it that's reallv nice.
HATORI: Yeah, I don't know why. It's really
American to me. You know, I love this coun
try, I love American people — very liberal
people. I feel this country has so much ener
gy from people to change something. I'm
surprised by a lot of things, because I'm from
very traditional, old history country. Some-


Thaf's Smokey behind the
plant, in case you were
wondering.
