# The 						world according to Miho
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
Milio Hatori is best known as one half of the
brilliant and experimental band that is
Cibo Matto. After touring extensively,
riding high on critical praise for their
genre-blending masterpiece "Stereotype A," the duo
has gone on hiatus while their supporting members
pursue solo projects. Not one to ever stop challenging
herself, Hatori lias been involved with various organi
zations and has done collaborations with some of
today's most exciting musicians. If you've been listen
ing to the right albums, you know Miho's voice from
tracks with the Beastie Boys and on cartoon-concept
rockers Gorillaz's smash hit, "19-2000."
Hatori's latest project, Smokey and Miho, is the
product of a longtime friendship with Smokey
Hormel, guitarist extraordinaire, who has played
with Tom Waits and frequently tours with Beck. To
gether, with backing vocals by Ganda, horns by Jon
Birdsong and percussion by Mauro Refosco, the
band plays beautiful bossa nova and tropicalia
music, mixing compositions by Brazilian greats such
as Baden Powell, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jorge
Ben with their own original songs. I was lucky to see
the band first in January 2002 at the Make-Out
Room and again this past month at the Great Amer

ican Music Hall.
Last week, Hatori was nice enough to chat with me
on the phone for an hour. She fielded questions about
the origins of Smokey and Miho and her feelings on
the looming war with Iraq, slightly side-stepped an
swering about the fate of Cibo Matto and even gave
me some tips on places to visit in Kyoto for my coming
study abroad.
INTERMISSION: My only exposure to Brazilian
music was my mother's Sergio Mendes albums, but I
was wondering, when did you develop an interest in
Brazilian music — was it in Japan or in the United
States?
MIHO HATORI: It was in Japan. Growing up in
Japan, you can't avoid Brazilian music because a lot of
Japanese pop music, especially in the '70s, was influ
enced 112 rom Brazilian music. I guess bossa nova really
makes sense with Japanese language. Japanese and
Portuguese have a lot of similar sounds, so it flows
with the notes of bossa nova. So that's the reason it's
very familiar to people who love music over there, I
think. It was not just a strictly bossa nova anything, it's
more like a Japanese pop music style.

INTERMISSION: I heard that you and Smokey met
when Beck and Cibo Matto toured together. I was
wondering how the band came about? Were you just
planning to make one album? Because it's turned into
something so much bigger...
HATORI: You know, the beginning was just writing
songs. Smokey had an idea and when he moved to
New York, we started. And when we are making a
couple songs, Baden Powell died. So, we decided to
have one gig just dedicated to Baden Powell and to
learn his songs; especially we are obsessed with that
one Baden Powell and Vinicus de Moraes album,
called "()s Afro Sambas." That album basically
changed my life, and Smokey too. We just felt, 'What
is this? Why was this sleeping here? Why didn't it
come out in the world more?' So we learned every
song from the album and we played a show in a down
town club called Tonic. And that was the starting and
once we played and learned these songs, we wanna
make it better and better. 1 wanted to sing Portuguese
more better. It's a great book of music, so we just keep
continuing to try it and that's the reason we made the
second EP ail songs of Baden Powell.

INTERMISSION: At the Great American
concert, yon guys seemed a lot more confi
dent than in January with the songs and the
lyrics.
HATORI: It is very challenging because
there are a lot of people doing Brazilian music
from Brazil, you know? I bet people have fear,
and yeah, I have fear — Yes, I don't speak
Portuguese at all. But I love to sing, and of
course 1 have heavy accent, but I feel like im
portant thing for music is joy. And that's
something I feel, yon know, all my experi
ence, my experience with Cibo Matto and
being in a record company and having tour
and stuff in the music business world, but now
1 feel... Hip-hop world is changing so much
and it's something I feel like I don't connect to
already. Like, back in time, I really felt con
nected; when I listened to Beastie Boys I real
ly felt like, "Yeah! No Sleep Till Brooklyn,
man!" you know? But now I think like a lot of
stuff— maybe I'm getting old or something?
— but I really feel like an outsider from that
big business.
Something about it, I don't feel connection to
the mainstream music. Then, somehow I start
to feel like this (band) is really not mainstream
or anything, more like an underground feel
ing. I felt this really pure love for music; This
is something I really love to try with my old
music friends. It is really great — every time
we play we have the amazing, amazing bright
ness in our heart and that's something I real
ly enjoy.
INTERMISSION: It seems like most Ameri
can bands won't usually venture into singing
in another language. Like those old Nat King
Cole albums in Spanish — you know that the
pronunciation is wrong, but it has this certain
something to it that's reallv nice.
HATORI: Yeah, I don't know why. It's really
American to me. You know, I love this coun
try, I love American people — very liberal
people. I feel this country has so much ener
gy from people to change something. I'm
surprised by a lot of things, because I'm from
very traditional, old history country. Some-

plant, in case you were
wondering.
thing is very hard to change in Japan, but
here it's not. Sometimes, you know, peo
ple can change it, like if everybody do pe
tition and everybody do rally —this
doesn't happen a lot in Japan. That's
very, very inspiring.
At the same time, a different kind of
conservativeness is living here. That's
very interesting and something I felt to
challenge as a foreigner. Cibo Matto as
well, we've done a lot of weird shit, you
know? Every time one out of one thou
sand people feels, "Wow, I like it!" and
every time I find these new people, I feel,
"Yeah! We shared this!" There is defi
nitely very open-minded people. 1 al
ways wanna find a meeting point. Espe
cially right now there are a lot of things
going on, about Iraq ...
INTERMISSION: I know Cibo Matto
has always been interested iu movements
and activism, so I was wondering what
you feel you should do or can do, or your
sentiment right now (about the Iraq situ
ation)?
HATORI: You know, if I'm a friend of
the president I would ask him to have a
law like, all students can travel for one
third of the price all over the world.
Then we will see more of what's going on
all over the world, what's going on in
Iraq — what kind of landscape they have
and what kind of life and culture. And
then people will have an idea about,
'Yeah, there my friend is living. My fa
vorite music is living there, my favorite
mythology is living over there.' How we
can destroy it? — I cannot say this will be
the best way, 1 think I'm just talking as a
musician — maybe I'm a dreamer, but
politics is very complicated with power
and money and, you know, oil. Maybe it's
impossible to solve 100 percent, but
maybe we can find someway to under
stand each other, and I hope music if one
of the ways.
And, you know, there's a lot of beau
tiful wisdom over there as well. And I
bet we can feel the same, from deep side
of wisdom and that's something we
share together. And another thing is
that, especially right now, a lot of people
I met through Cibo Matto and Smokey
and Miho are very unique people to me
— they have a very open mind, so aware
about the world. Like, "I went to Brazil,
1 went to India, let's talk about music!"
It's really amazing to me. There is just
one thing to connect everybody and 10
million things we can talk about from it.
To me, it's like beauty of human being.
There is definitely some people who will
never be out of the town they grew up,
and 1 think then it would be hard to un
derstand if there is another world.
From my job, I have more chance to
go different places and meet people, and
yeah, I think music is something you can
carry over. I was traveling in desert in
India and one person asked me to sing
my country's song; I sang old Japanese
song and they sang back to me old Indi
an song— 1 don't understand language
but I felt, "Man, this is very, very special

thing." I wish we can feel more this kind
of beauty of each other. There's no bor
der in music and this kind of open heart,
you know? It's interesting, right now the
world we live in has a lot of lines between
us and somebody. It is really complicat
ed.
INTERMISSION: I don't think you've
said anything officially but I was wonder
ing, what's the state of Cibo Matto?
HATORI: Well, I made a couple songs
with Yuka; we wanted to go to one festi
val in Asia, but 1 guess the festival didn't
happen or something, so we didn't do it.
But, actually, we are trying to do that,
just two of us — kind of small group
thing (laughing). I don't know. Yeah, I
guess if we have a chance, it's possible to
do that.
INTERMISSION: My friend and I feel
really nostalgic for when we were just
starting high school, and Grand Royal
(the Beastie Boys-founded label that put
out albums by Buffalo Daughter, Ben
Lee and Butter 08, a Cibo Matto side
project) was still up and running. It was
so sad to see that label go bankrupt.
HATORI: I really 112 eel that people have a
lot of passion at the beginning, especially
after graduating from college, all kids
have so much energy — like, "Let's try!
Let's try!" because music is so special .
After that, well . . . I'm just talking from
my experience, but a record company is
a very big world. It's about business.
Good music, yes, sometimes it's hard to
make money. So, if the record labels
don't have money, they will cut a lot of
bands out.
I have to say for Smokey and Miho's
CI), I am having an interesting experi
ence because we print it up ourselves.
There is no music label, because maybe we
are too weird for everyone at this time.
But it is amazing experience because
when we play a show there are support
ers; we sell CDs and people buy it directly
from us and there are definitely big listen
ers and some pur e fans, not about media
or that kind of big power. I really felt very
warm to get that support from people.
INTERMISSION: When you played at
the Make-Out Room (in the S. F. Mission
district), which is kind of more like a
night club, it seemed very intimate. The
place you played last week was more of a
rock music venue. In what kiud of places
do you feel most comfortable playing?
HATORI: I think that it's all about room,
because we have acoustic instrumentals,
so if the room has good sound for
acoustics, we'll play. We are not a rock
band, you know? YVe don't have a bass. I
don't care about wherever, if there is a
good acoustic sound and good audience.
Great American was great! San Francis
co is very aware about music, I think,
very open-minded people. It's a very
unique town, very great —1 love San
Francisco.

all over the world, what's going on in
Iraq — what kind of landscape they have
and what kind of life and culture. And
then people will have an idea about,
'Yeah, there my friend is living. My fa
vorite music is living there, my favorite
mythology is living over there.' How we
can destroy it? — I cannot say this will be
the best way, 1 think I'm just talking as a
musician — maybe I'm a dreamer, but
politics is very complicated with power
and money and, you know, oil. Maybe it's
impossible to solve 100 percent, but
maybe we can find someway to under
stand each other, and I hope music if one
of the ways.
And, you know, there's a lot of beau
tiful wisdom over there as well. And I
bet we can feel the same, from deep side
of wisdom and that's something we
share together. And another thing is
that, especially right now, a lot of people
I met through Cibo Matto and Smokey
and Miho are very unique people to me
— they have a very open mind, so aware
about the world. Like, "I went to Brazil,
1 went to India, let's talk about music!"
It's really amazing to me. There is just
one thing to connect everybody and 10
million things we can talk about from it.
To me, it's like beauty of human being.
There is definitely some people who will
never be out of the town they grew up,
and 1 think then it would be hard to un
derstand if there is another world.
From my job, I have more chance to
go different places and meet people, and
yeah, I think music is something you can
carry over. I was traveling in desert in
India and one person asked me to sing
my country's song; I sang old Japanese
song and they sang back to me old Indi
an song— 1 don't understand language
but I felt, "Man, this is very, very special

thing." I wish we can feel more this kind
of beauty of each other. There's no bor
der in music and this kind of open heart,
you know? It's interesting, right now the
world we live in has a lot of lines between
us and somebody. It is really complicat
ed.
INTERMISSION: I don't think you've
said anything officially but I was wonder
ing, what's the state of Cibo Matto?
HATORI: Well, I made a couple songs
with Yuka; we wanted to go to one festi
val in Asia, but 1 guess the festival didn't
happen or something, so we didn't do it.
But, actually, we are trying to do that,
just two of us — kind of small group
thing (laughing). I don't know. Yeah, I
guess if we have a chance, it's possible to
do that.
INTERMISSION: My friend and I feel
really nostalgic for when we were just
starting high school, and Grand Royal
(the Beastie Boys-founded label that put
out albums by Buffalo Daughter, Ben
Lee and Butter 08, a Cibo Matto side
project) was still up and running. It was
so sad to see that label go bankrupt.
HATORI: I really 112 eel that people have a
lot of passion at the beginning, especially
after graduating from college, all kids
have so much energy — like, "Let's try!
Let's try!" because music is so special .
After that, well . . . I'm just talking from
my experience, but a record company is
a very big world. It's about business.
Good music, yes, sometimes it's hard to
make money. So, if the record labels
don't have money, they will cut a lot of
bands out.
I have to say for Smokey and Miho's
CI), I am having an interesting experi
ence because we print it up ourselves.
There is no music label, because maybe we
are too weird for everyone at this time.
But it is amazing experience because
when we play a show there are support
ers; we sell CDs and people buy it directly
from us and there are definitely big listen
ers and some pur e fans, not about media
or that kind of big power. I really felt very
warm to get that support from people.
INTERMISSION: When you played at
the Make-Out Room (in the S. F. Mission
district), which is kind of more like a
night club, it seemed very intimate. The
place you played last week was more of a
rock music venue. In what kiud of places
do you feel most comfortable playing?
HATORI: I think that it's all about room,
because we have acoustic instrumentals,
so if the room has good sound for
acoustics, we'll play. We are not a rock
band, you know? YVe don't have a bass. I
don't care about wherever, if there is a
good acoustic sound and good audience.
Great American was great! San Francis
co is very aware about music, I think,
very open-minded people. It's a very
unique town, very great —1 love San
Francisco.

Milio Hatori is best known as one half of the
brilliant and experimental band that is
Cibo Matto. After touring extensively,
riding high on critical praise for their
genre-blending masterpiece "Stereotype A," the duo
has gone on hiatus while their supporting members
pursue solo projects. Not one to ever stop challenging
herself, Hatori lias been involved with various organi
zations and has done collaborations with some of
today's most exciting musicians. If you've been listen
ing to the right albums, you know Miho's voice from
tracks with the Beastie Boys and on cartoon-concept
rockers Gorillaz's smash hit, "19-2000."
Hatori's latest project, Smokey and Miho, is the
product of a longtime friendship with Smokey
Hormel, guitarist extraordinaire, who has played
with Tom Waits and frequently tours with Beck. To
gether, with backing vocals by Ganda, horns by Jon
Birdsong and percussion by Mauro Refosco, the
band plays beautiful bossa nova and tropicalia
music, mixing compositions by Brazilian greats such
as Baden Powell, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jorge
Ben with their own original songs. I was lucky to see
the band first in January 2002 at the Make-Out
Room and again this past month at the Great Amer

ican Music Hall.
Last week, Hatori was nice enough to chat with me
on the phone for an hour. She fielded questions about
the origins of Smokey and Miho and her feelings on
the looming war with Iraq, slightly side-stepped an
swering about the fate of Cibo Matto and even gave
me some tips on places to visit in Kyoto for my coming
study abroad.
INTERMISSION: My only exposure to Brazilian
music was my mother's Sergio Mendes albums, but I
was wondering, when did you develop an interest in
Brazilian music — was it in Japan or in the United
States?
MIHO HATORI: It was in Japan. Growing up in
Japan, you can't avoid Brazilian music because a lot of
Japanese pop music, especially in the '70s, was influ
enced 112 rom Brazilian music. I guess bossa nova really
makes sense with Japanese language. Japanese and
Portuguese have a lot of similar sounds, so it flows
with the notes of bossa nova. So that's the reason it's
very familiar to people who love music over there, I
think. It was not just a strictly bossa nova anything, it's
more like a Japanese pop music style.

INTERMISSION: I heard that you and Smokey met
when Beck and Cibo Matto toured together. I was
wondering how the band came about? Were you just
planning to make one album? Because it's turned into
something so much bigger...
HATORI: You know, the beginning was just writing
songs. Smokey had an idea and when he moved to
New York, we started. And when we are making a
couple songs, Baden Powell died. So, we decided to
have one gig just dedicated to Baden Powell and to
learn his songs; especially we are obsessed with that
one Baden Powell and Vinicus de Moraes album,
called "()s Afro Sambas." That album basically
changed my life, and Smokey too. We just felt, 'What
is this? Why was this sleeping here? Why didn't it
come out in the world more?' So we learned every
song from the album and we played a show in a down
town club called Tonic. And that was the starting and
once we played and learned these songs, we wanna
make it better and better. 1 wanted to sing Portuguese
more better. It's a great book of music, so we just keep
continuing to try it and that's the reason we made the
second EP ail songs of Baden Powell.

INTERMISSION: At the Great American
concert, yon guys seemed a lot more confi
dent than in January with the songs and the
lyrics.
HATORI: It is very challenging because
there are a lot of people doing Brazilian music
from Brazil, you know? I bet people have fear,
and yeah, I have fear — Yes, I don't speak
Portuguese at all. But I love to sing, and of
course 1 have heavy accent, but I feel like im
portant thing for music is joy. And that's
something I feel, yon know, all my experi
ence, my experience with Cibo Matto and
being in a record company and having tour
and stuff in the music business world, but now
1 feel... Hip-hop world is changing so much
and it's something I feel like I don't connect to
already. Like, back in time, I really felt con
nected; when I listened to Beastie Boys I real
ly felt like, "Yeah! No Sleep Till Brooklyn,
man!" you know? But now I think like a lot of
stuff— maybe I'm getting old or something?
— but I really feel like an outsider from that
big business.
Something about it, I don't feel connection to
the mainstream music. Then, somehow I start
to feel like this (band) is really not mainstream
or anything, more like an underground feel
ing. I felt this really pure love for music; This
is something I really love to try with my old
music friends. It is really great — every time
we play we have the amazing, amazing bright
ness in our heart and that's something I real
ly enjoy.
INTERMISSION: It seems like most Ameri
can bands won't usually venture into singing
in another language. Like those old Nat King
Cole albums in Spanish — you know that the
pronunciation is wrong, but it has this certain
something to it that's reallv nice.
HATORI: Yeah, I don't know why. It's really
American to me. You know, I love this coun
try, I love American people — very liberal
people. I feel this country has so much ener
gy from people to change something. I'm
surprised by a lot of things, because I'm from
very traditional, old history country. Some-


Thaf's Smokey behind the
plant, in case you were
wondering.
thing is very hard to change in Japan, but
here it's not. Sometimes, you know, peo
ple can change it, like if everybody do pe
tition and everybody do rally —this
doesn't happen a lot in Japan. That's
very, very inspiring.
At the same time, a different kind of
conservativeness is living here. That's
very interesting and something I felt to
challenge as a foreigner. Cibo Matto as
well, we've done a lot of weird shit, you
know? Every time one out of one thou
sand people feels, "Wow, I like it!" and
every time I find these new people, I feel,
"Yeah! We shared this!" There is defi
nitely very open-minded people. 1 al
ways wanna find a meeting point. Espe
cially right now there are a lot of things
going on, about Iraq ...
INTERMISSION: I know Cibo Matto
has always been interested iu movements
and activism, so I was wondering what
you feel you should do or can do, or your
sentiment right now (about the Iraq situ
ation)?
HATORI: You know, if I'm a friend of
the president I would ask him to have a
law like, all students can travel for one
third of the price all over the world.
Then we will see more of what's going on
all over the world, what's going on in
Iraq — what kind of landscape they have
and what kind of life and culture. And
then people will have an idea about,
'Yeah, there my friend is living. My fa

politics is very complicated with power
and money and, you know, oil. Maybe it's
impossible to solve 100 percent, but
maybe we can find someway to under

And, you know, there's a lot of beau

makes sense with Japanese language. Japanese and
Portuguese have a lot of similar sounds, so it flows
with the notes of bossa nova. So that's the reason it's
very familiar to people who love music over there, I
think. It was not just a strictly bossa nova anything, it's
more like a Japanese pop music style.

INTERMISSION: I heard that you and Smokey met
when Beck and Cibo Matto toured together. I was
wondering how the band came about? Were you just
planning to make one album? Because it's turned into
something so much bigger...
HATORI: You know, the beginning was just writing
songs. Smokey had an idea and when he moved to
New York, we started. And when we are making a
couple songs, Baden Powell died. So, we decided to
have one gig just dedicated to Baden Powell and to
learn his songs; especially we are obsessed with that
one Baden Powell and Vinicus de Moraes album,
called "()s Afro Sambas." That album basically
changed my life, and Smokey too. We just felt, 'What
is this? Why was this sleeping here? Why didn't it
come out in the world more?' So we learned every
song from the album and we played a show in a down
town club called Tonic. And that was the starting and
once we played and learned these songs, we wanna
make it better and better. 1 wanted to sing Portuguese
more better. It's a great book of music, so we just keep
continuing to try it and that's the reason we made the
second EP ail songs of Baden Powell.

INTERMISSION: At the Great American
concert, yon guys seemed a lot more confi
dent than in January with the songs and the
lyrics.
HATORI: It is very challenging because
there are a lot of people doing Brazilian music
from Brazil, you know? I bet people have fear,
and yeah, I have fear — Yes, I don't speak
Portuguese at all. But I love to sing, and of
course 1 have heavy accent, but I feel like im
portant thing for music is joy. And that's
something I feel, yon know, all my experi
ence, my experience with Cibo Matto and
being in a record company and having tour
and stuff in the music business world, but now
1 feel... Hip-hop world is changing so much
and it's something I feel like I don't connect to
already. Like, back in time, I really felt con
nected; when I listened to Beastie Boys I real
ly felt like, "Yeah! No Sleep Till Brooklyn,
man!" you know? But now I think like a lot of
stuff— maybe I'm getting old or something?
— but I really feel like an outsider from that
big business.
Something about it, I don't feel connection to
the mainstream music. Then, somehow I start
to feel like this (band) is really not mainstream
or anything, more like an underground feel
ing. I felt this really pure love for music; This
is something I really love to try with my old
music friends. It is really great — every time
we play we have the amazing, amazing bright
ness in our heart and that's something I real
ly enjoy.
INTERMISSION: It seems like most Ameri
can bands won't usually venture into singing
in another language. Like those old Nat King
Cole albums in Spanish — you know that the
pronunciation is wrong, but it has this certain
something to it that's reallv nice.
HATORI: Yeah, I don't know why. It's really
American to me. You know, I love this coun
try, I love American people — very liberal
people. I feel this country has so much ener
gy from people to change something. I'm
surprised by a lot of things, because I'm from
very traditional, old history country. Some-


Thaf's Smokey behind the
plant, in case you were
wondering.
thing is very hard to change in Japan, but
here it's not. Sometimes, you know, peo
ple can change it, like if everybody do pe
tition and everybody do rally —this
doesn't happen a lot in Japan. That's
very, very inspiring.
At the same time, a different kind of
conservativeness is living here. That's
very interesting and something I felt to
challenge as a foreigner. Cibo Matto as
well, we've done a lot of weird shit, you
know? Every time one out of one thou
sand people feels, "Wow, I like it!" and
every time I find these new people, I feel,
"Yeah! We shared this!" There is defi
nitely very open-minded people. 1 al
ways wanna find a meeting point. Espe
cially right now there are a lot of things
going on, about Iraq ...
INTERMISSION: I know Cibo Matto
has always been interested iu movements
and activism, so I was wondering what
you feel you should do or can do, or your
sentiment right now (about the Iraq situ
ation)?
HATORI: You know, if I'm a friend of
the president I would ask him to have a
law like, all students can travel for one
third of the price all over the world.
Then we will see more of what's going on
all over the world, what's going on in
Iraq — what kind of landscape they have
and what kind of life and culture. And
then people will have an idea about,
'Yeah, there my friend is living. My fa
vorite music is living there, my favorite
mythology is living over there.' How we
can destroy it? — I cannot say this will be
the best way, 1 think I'm just talking as a
musician — maybe I'm a dreamer, but
politics is very complicated with power
and money and, you know, oil. Maybe it's
impossible to solve 100 percent, but
maybe we can find someway to under
stand each other, and I hope music if one
of the ways.
And, you know, there's a lot of beau
tiful wisdom over there as well. And I
bet we can feel the same, from deep side
of wisdom and that's something we
share together. And another thing is
that, especially right now, a lot of people
I met through Cibo Matto and Smokey
and Miho are very unique people to me
— they have a very open mind, so aware
about the world. Like, "I went to Brazil,
1 went to India, let's talk about music!"
It's really amazing to me. There is just
one thing to connect everybody and 10
million things we can talk about from it.
To me, it's like beauty of human being.
There is definitely some people who will
never be out of the town they grew up,
and 1 think then it would be hard to un
derstand if there is another world.
From my job, I have more chance to
go different places and meet people, and
yeah, I think music is something you can
carry over. I was traveling in desert in
India and one person asked me to sing
my country's song; I sang old Japanese
song and they sang back to me old Indi
an song— 1 don't understand language
but I felt, "Man, this is very, very special

thing." I wish we can feel more this kind
of beauty of each other. There's no bor
der in music and this kind of open heart,
you know? It's interesting, right now the
world we live in has a lot of lines between
us and somebody. It is really complicat
ed.
INTERMISSION: I don't think you've
said anything officially but I was wonder
ing, what's the state of Cibo Matto?
HATORI: Well, I made a couple songs
with Yuka; we wanted to go to one festi
val in Asia, but 1 guess the festival didn't
happen or something, so we didn't do it.
But, actually, we are trying to do that,
just two of us — kind of small group
thing (laughing). I don't know. Yeah, I
guess if we have a chance, it's possible to
do that.
INTERMISSION: My friend and I feel
really nostalgic for when we were just
starting high school, and Grand Royal
(the Beastie Boys-founded label that put
out albums by Buffalo Daughter, Ben
Lee and Butter 08, a Cibo Matto side
project) was still up and running. It was
so sad to see that label go bankrupt.
HATORI: I really 112 eel that people have a
lot of passion at the beginning, especially
after graduating from college, all kids
have so much energy — like, "Let's try!
Let's try!" because music is so special .
After that, well . . . I'm just talking from
my experience, but a record company is
a very big world. It's about business.
Good music, yes, sometimes it's hard to
make money. So, if the record labels
don't have money, they will cut a lot of
bands out.
I have to say for Smokey and Miho's
CI), I am having an interesting experi
ence because we print it up ourselves.
There is no music label, because maybe we
are too weird for everyone at this time.
But it is amazing experience because
when we play a show there are support
ers; we sell CDs and people buy it directly
from us and there are definitely big listen
ers and some pur e fans, not about media
or that kind of big power. I really felt very
warm to get that support from people.
INTERMISSION: When you played at
the Make-Out Room (in the S. F. Mission
district), which is kind of more like a
night club, it seemed very intimate. The
place you played last week was more of a
rock music venue. In what kiud of places
do you feel most comfortable playing?
HATORI: I think that it's all about room,
because we have acoustic instrumentals,
so if the room has good sound for
acoustics, we'll play. We are not a rock
band, you know? YVe don't have a bass. I
don't care about wherever, if there is a
good acoustic sound and good audience.
Great American was great! San Francis
co is very aware about music, I think,
very open-minded people. It's a very
unique town, very great —1 love San
Francisco.

Milio Hatori is best known as one half of the
brilliant and experimental band that is
Cibo Matto. After touring extensively,
riding high on critical praise for their
genre-blending masterpiece "Stereotype A," the duo
has gone on hiatus while their supporting members
pursue solo projects. Not one to ever stop challenging
herself, Hatori lias been involved with various organi
zations and has done collaborations with some of
today's most exciting musicians. If you've been listen
ing to the right albums, you know Miho's voice from
tracks with the Beastie Boys and on cartoon-concept
rockers Gorillaz's smash hit, "19-2000."
Hatori's latest project, Smokey and Miho, is the
product of a longtime friendship with Smokey
Hormel, guitarist extraordinaire, who has played
with Tom Waits and frequently tours with Beck. To
gether, with backing vocals by Ganda, horns by Jon
Birdsong and percussion by Mauro Refosco, the
band plays beautiful bossa nova and tropicalia
music, mixing compositions by Brazilian greats such
as Baden Powell, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jorge
Ben with their own original songs. I was lucky to see
the band first in January 2002 at the Make-Out
Room and again this past month at the Great Amer

ican Music Hall.
Last week, Hatori was nice enough to chat with me
on the phone for an hour. She fielded questions about
the origins of Smokey and Miho and her feelings on
the looming war with Iraq, slightly side-stepped an
swering about the fate of Cibo Matto and even gave
me some tips on places to visit in Kyoto for my coming
study abroad.
INTERMISSION: My only exposure to Brazilian
music was my mother's Sergio Mendes albums, but I
was wondering, when did you develop an interest in
Brazilian music — was it in Japan or in the United
States?
MIHO HATORI: It was in Japan. Growing up in
Japan, you can't avoid Brazilian music because a lot of
Japanese pop music, especially in the '70s, was influ
enced 112 rom Brazilian music. I guess bossa nova really
makes sense with Japanese language. Japanese and
Portuguese have a lot of similar sounds, so it flows
