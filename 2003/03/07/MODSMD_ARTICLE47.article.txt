# Gursky exhibit is grand, global and digital
## 
### BRIAN UMANA 
Andreas Gursky takes beautiful
photographs, and there are a lot of
things that one can say about them.
They are about the loss of individ
uality in a globalized society. They
are about the conflicts between hu
manity and nature. They are about
the influences of technology and
corporate culture in our lives.
The thing is, knowing what
Gursky's work is about is of limited
value because it's nearly impossible
to tell how Gursky feels about the
issues his photos raise. Walking
through the Andreas Gursky ex
hibit, which opened three weeks
ago at SFMOMA, the most striking
aspects of the show are the im
mense technical skill and fascinat
ing subject matter that his photos
represent. A careful viewer has to
be frustrated, however, that
Gursky's work seems to include a
lot of evidence for many different
arguments that people could make
about the roles of corporate cul
ture and globalization in our lives,
but very few hints at what he actu
ally believes, very few hints at his
true values. When he photographs
210 shoes as they are arranged in a
store display, as he does in "Unti
tled V" (1997), it is hard to tell
which side of the line between
irony and advertisement Gursky
stands on.
Gursky's values are of a differ
ent sort — his artistic values —
are, of course, very apparent. He
loves bright colors, patterns, sym
metry and complex details. But
Gursky's is not generally a macro
photography that urges you to
look at the tiny overlooked details
of everyday life — he is not about
taking close-ups of flowers in fields.
What fascinates Gursky are the
ways life works on a grand scale; his
pictures are often about giving the
viewer a sense of a scene that might
include thousands of people — an
open-air rave or a busy parliament

or the frantic floor of a stock ex
change — and they are almost al
ways printed on a scale so large
that they take up an entire gallery
wall.
Most of the pieces in the show
are from just the past five or six
years, but one of his earlier works,
"Siemens, Karlsgruhe" (1991), is
quite archetypal of his style. The
photo's vantage point is from near
the ceiling of a factory, and it cap
tures what seems to be a daily
scene. In a huge room, Siemens
workers in lab coats sit at rows of
desks in a room of ordered clutter
that comes in a mixed-up rainbow
of colors. Descending from the ceil
ing are huge cords of yellow, white,
green and blue, all coiling their
way down to the ground, giving

the factory the overall look of a Dr.
Seuss creation on LSD.
The photo has a number of
characteristics that are recurring
points of interest for Gurskv: A
subject including lots of people, a
sense of human busy-ness and a
look at the zaniness of an environ
ment humans have created for
themselves. It also has the extreme
sense of detail that is a Gursky hall
mark — upon very close inspec
tion one can see the nuts, bolts and
pieces of gold filament on the desks
of the factory workers. To get the
full effect of Gursky's photogra
phy, one must examine a piece
from a distance, like with an Im
pressionist painting and also from
up close, like with a Joseph Cornell
box.

Andreas Gursky Exhibit
On display SF MOM A until June 1,2003.

Andreas Gursky is 47 years old,
so the earliest photos in this exhibi
tion, two pictures from 1984, are
notable for the fact that he was only
28 or 29 at the time. Those pic
tures, "Sunday Strollers, Dussel
dorf Airport" and "Klausenpass,"
are also interesting for the size of
their prints — they are the two
smallest ones in the show. The
photos are both interesting depic

tions of human interaction with na
ture, but they demand less atten
tion than his other pieces and
might make one wonder if his later
photos are too reliant on the scale
of their prints. Ultimately though,
the immense sc ale ofGursky's pho
tos generally feels justified by the
vastness of the subjects he portrays.
When Gursky's later works seem
more appealing than his early
ones, it is in part because the later
pieces more frequently offer the
sense that humans are dwarfed
and individuals are made futile not
so much by nature, but by human
amalgamations that have a life of
their own, like a bustling stadium
or the floor of a stock exchange. In
his breathtaking series of 13 unti
tled pieces, most of which are part
of this show, each of the photos
portrays something universal,
something that a viewer cannot lo
cate in a specific country or place.
.And all of them, whether of a
headlight illuminating the side of a
road so that the granules of dirt
look like a Martian landscape
("Untitled III." 1996)0r0fa land
fill with a trash village set up inside
it, are about the way humans im
pact the world, the way humans
portray the world and the way hu
mans search fora place in the
world.
One of the most exhilarating
feelings a person can get at an ex
hibition is that the work on display
feels artistically new. It would be
hard to avoid this feeling at the
Gurskv show, if not because of the



"Times Square"
