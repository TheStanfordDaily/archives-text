I think it's time we realize how in
debted we are to a film industry that
demonstrates such concern for its audi
ence's well-being. For those among us
who are frequently overcome with an ir
rational desire to drop everything and
move to the suburbs, enlightened vi
sionaries have been en-

listed to make films
like "American Beau
ty" which teach us that
the suburbs make
you gav, induce
OCD, drive you to
reckless behavior like
filming empty plastic
bags and make
teenagers really
angry.

But suburbia's evils do not stop here,
so a never-ending paiade of films has
been produced to show us the true
range of horrors lurking between the
tiles of the kidney-shaped pool, the
sugar-free iced tea mix and the car-pool
schedule.
From films like "Bully" — which
proved that bored suburban teenagers
engage in a limited set of inspired activ
ities , like shagging, drugs and even a
spot of manslaughter — to "Story
telling", which exposed the fact that
gold-plated door-handles, nutritious
family meals, and conceptual gardening
cannot compensate for dysfunctionality,
we may safely agree that a great deal has

been achieved in averting further disas
ter. The latest offering, a film called
"The Safety of C)bjects," has taught me a
valuable lesson: it may be cramped,
filthy and maddening, but I am certain
never to abandon the city again. Rather
conveniently I don't even have a dinner
table anyone could leave in a huff before
being excused.
Believe it or not, "The Safety of Ob
jects" is a deeply metaphorical film. At its
center is a charming quad of families —
the Golds, Trains, Christiansons and
Jennings — who carry on in medium
sized houses, have 1.8 children and hv

gienic pets and bolster their happiness
with lots of meaningful objects. The
Gold's rocker-boy son lies in a coma
after a car accident (Joshua Jackson
gives us a run for our money with this
nuanced method performance), so his
mother (Glenn Glose) and perpetually
exasperated sister (Jessica Campbell)
decide to enter a sweepstakes fora glis
tening new SUV.
The Trains all have healthy chestnut
hair and sunflower-yellow sheets, but
Daddy (Dermot Mulroney) is a bit of an
everyman. He resigns from his law firm
after having been passed over fora pro

motion, and since "a man is nothing
without a purpose" takes up residence
in the local mall, where lit- discovers the
wonderful love-affair between con
sumption and, of all things, domestic
appliances. 1 lis son loses his virginity to
a Barbie doll.
The Jennings are a little odd:
Mommy (Patricia Clarkson), a Zone
diet devotee, was shacking up with ham
ster-cheeked Jackson before they
strapped him to a bed and stuck a
catheter in his joystick. She's frustrated
and bored and spends her days cruising
the local watering holes for fresh meat.
Her kids are glued to the television and
subsist on a diet of Lucky C '.harms. Sub
sequently they are sexually ambiguous
and / or mentally backward.
The Christiansons, finally, are mail
order New Age. Mommy (Mary Kay
Place) does yoga as though her life de
pended on it, forces her kids to eat
quinoa and similarly tasty natural foods,
and is sexually/ spiritually frustrated by
her husband. Her best friend is her
Nordic Track.
At a certain point the characters each
do one really stupid thing, realize that
their lives need to he drastically restruc
tured to ensure real happiness, and, just
like that, get rid of all their objects. I
could be wrong, but director Rose
Troche's notion that the (suburban)
American Dream is not all it's cracked
up to be is extraordinarily revolution
ary. 1 spent at least 6.5 minutes thinking
about it after I walked out of the theater.
