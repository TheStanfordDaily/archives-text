# Interpol Moves into My Airspace
## 
### Karan Mahajan 
Standing at the center of the Fillmore with
the history of rock n roll mapped around
me in posters, 1 am under-dressed and
overly-impressed: Suddenly, all my men
tal sums (Joy Division + Smiths = Inter
pol?) are collapsing; all my Pitchfork
media pundits are panting: all my lan
('urtis elegies are departing.
The four lads of Interpol, attired meticu
lously in seedy business suits and NYC
melancholy, are tearing through

their set with such a visceral rel
ish that all I can think is "Holy
crap! Holy croquet-club-wield-1
ingcrap!"
Apparently, a good concert is

meant to make you incoherent, not
simply inaudible: I am both, and I am
bouncing.
Bouncing especially to "Say Hello To The
Angels"-delivered at break-neck speed
with Smithsonian guitars as the line "You
move into my airspace" rumbles through
the crowd. Clearly, the best song of the
evening.
On-stage, the band's energy is skewed to
wards the bassist, Carlos: He hops around
with a badass haircut and a cigarette dan
gling between his lips, while the others con
duct the guitar assault solemnly. Despite the
presence of a touring keyboardist, the band

gags its glacial atmosphere in favor of ener
gy: "NYC" is no longer heart-wrenching; in
stead it more closely follows the subway slip
streams of that city.
I'll admit that I've been obsessed with In
terpol fora while now, but watching some
of the more enervating moments on their
superlative debut "Turn On The Bright
Lights" chug to life is awesome. ()n "Stella
Was A Diver and She Was Always Down,"
my suspicion that Paul Banks possesses
one of the most vital voices in rock '11' roll
is confirmed: His Curtis-Byrne baritone

forms a
heavy-duty
packaging
for the songs,
riding the
post-punk

guitars with maturity. Iti fact, the band's
confidence and maturity is hard to recon
cile with their boyish looks.
But yeah- back at the Fillmore- the band's
set is coming to a close, and they still
haven't played my favorite song off the
album-"Lief Erikson." 1 bite my nails and
stamp on them through the encore. All I
get is nail-dust. Perhaps the band is afraid
to tinker with the brooding majesty of this
song in concert, hut I'm disappointed as
hell that I don't get to hear Paul Banks
singing "The rabid glow is like brail to the
night."

Walking out, I realize that Interpol's set,
while loyal to the album, was too short to be
wholly satisfying and that 50 minutes of ex
cellent music can't atone for 2 hours of
awful opening bands. The first act- Ghost
Orchid- was a sexual horror story retold
through ritual drumming and Rob Zombie
grumpiness-any band that features the Mac
G4 Powerbook as its primary instrument
possesses coolness, but I'm still weary of
songs that lack melodies.
(-alia, the next act, played an academic
version of "My Bloody Valentine, "and
sounded like a saw ripping through Sty

rofoam over and over again. To their
credit, they sucked and appeared to be
proud of the fact. And I got a chance to
shoe-gaze.
Still, these bands formed an effective con
trast to Interpol-an act that choked the
banter and plugged the onstage antics in
favor of music. I and my fellow preppy
Pitchlorkmedia-reading audience were
impressed as hell: Not only are Interpol
the most scrupulous and majestic of the
NYC crop, they are also the most worthy
of the bright lights and the most capable of
handling them.
