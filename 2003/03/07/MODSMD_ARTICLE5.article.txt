# Fac Sen questions Hoover head
## 
### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
John Raisian brought his
French army helmet with him to
the Faculty Senate meeting yester
day afternoon in anticipation of
verbal crossfire. Fortunately for
Raisian, director of the Hoover In
stitution, the 45-minute question
and-answer period did not be
come heated enough to require
him to don the helmet. He was,
however, forced to field a barrage
of questions on the role of political
ideology in Hoover's appointment
practices.
It had been 13 years since the
senate last heard a report from
Hoover. Raisian jokingly recalled
that 1 3 years ago he needed his hel
met for protection.
"We have enhanced the rela
tionship between us and the Uni
versity [since then]," Raisian said,
going further to recall a time when
the windows of Hoover had to be
made of plywood.
He began his report with a brief
overview of Hoover's history and its

relationship with the University.
"We're not some independent
agency that's renting buildings on
your campus — we're a part of
the University," he explained.
"We're very proud to be a part of
Stanford."
Hoover's purpose is to "pro
mote vigorous dialogue" about
both foreign and domestic public
policy, Raisian said. Some of the
ideas cultivated there, such as a flat
tax, have been put to use in other
countries.
With 60 million documents in its
archives and 25 miles of shelving,
Hoover is "an asset to the Universi
ty," Raisian said. Stanford faculty,
stall and students represent 30 per
cent of its users, while 40 percent of
its users are faculty and students
from around the globe.
To give the senate an idea of the
prestigious scholars Hoover at
tracts, including Stanford profes
sors, Raisian listed some of the ac
complishments of appointed
Hoover fellows. Among the fellows,
there are three Nobel laureates,
four winners of the Presidential

Medal of Freedom and three win
ners of the National Medal of Sci
ence, to name a few.
However, despite these statistics,
the senate still raised concerns over
the "quality" of Hoover's appoint
ments and questioned Raisian
about the methods it uses to select
ihe candidates — an issue that has
also caught the attention of student
protesters who have called for the
University to sever its ties with
Hoover.
Raisian likened the appoint
ment process at Hoover, often
dubbed by outsiders as a "conserv
ative think thank," to that of the
University.
"It mimics that of any depart
ment in the University," he said.
This statement met much oppo
sition from senate members.
Debra Satz, associate professor of
philosophy, protested that I loover's
appointment process could be "in
terpreted as ideological."
"How can you be mimicking the
departments if it's not really open
to everyone in the political spec
trum?" she asked. "It makes me
nervous."
Raisian replied that there is no
bias in the appointment process
and that the "first and foremost cri
terion [for an appointment] is ex
cellence." He added, "The notion
that Hoover fellows all think alike is
not correct."
He then fielded a question
from Business Prof. Joanne Mar
tin that addressed the political af
filiation of the fellows, to which he

responded that there is a far more
even split in affiliations among fel
lows than in the affiliations of the
faculty of many academic depart
ments. University President John
Hennessy reminded the senate
that political affiliation is in no way
considered in any appointment
for any position in the University.
"The notion ofan ideological lit
mus test is simply false," said
Stephen Haber, professor of politi
cal science and senior fellow at the
Hoover.
Raisian emphasized that Hoover
comprises policy makers and peo
ple interested in studying public
policy, regardless of ideology.
"The idea is to have a national

dialogue," he said. "We are not a
heritage foundation . . . We are
not trying to lobby Con
gress ... We are a manufacturer
of ideas."
Concluding his report, Raisian
itemized ways that Hoover benefits
the University. In addition to offer
ing its libraries and prestigious fel
lows, it employs over 100 Stanford
students every year and adds to the
diversity on campus.
"I believe we're helping to im
prove diversity," he said. "We want
the overall University to be ex
tremely diverse.
"I believe we are helping to im
prove the University intellectually,"
lie said.
