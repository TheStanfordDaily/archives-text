111 Hunter S. Thompson

"I like this book, and I especially like the title, which pretty
well sums up the foul nature of life in the U.S.A. in these first
few bloody years of the post-American century," declares leg
endary gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in the intro
duction to his angry, rambling and at times savagely funny
memoir, "Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-
Crossed Child in the Final Days of the American Century."
"Only a fool or a whore would call it anything else," he adds.
Thompson has often said that his beat as ajournalist is "the
death of the American Dream," starting with the wild motor
cycle gangs of his first book "Hell's Angels" and moving on to
the deranged, drug-soaked weekend described in "Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas" and Richard Nixon's presidential re
election campaign in "Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign
Trail 72."
In "Kingdom of Fear," he turns his perceptive eye and off
the-wall sensibilities to his own life.
Or at least, that's the general idea. This "memoir" is far
from a standard autobiography; it jumps around the past

seemingly at random, begin
ning with Thompson's first en
counter with the FBI at the age
of nine ("Never believe the first
tiling an FBI agent tells you
about anything . . . ") and end
ing with the early days of his
relationship with his compan
ion and assistant, Anita Bej
muk. In between, he talks
about his 1970 campaign to be
sheriff of Aspen on the Freak
Power ticket, his successful
struggle against charges of as
sault and drug abuse in 1990
and his stints as a correspon
dent and cultural ambassador
in Vietnam and Cuba. It's def
initely an eye-opener for those
who, like me, used to think
that Thompson's just spent the
last 20 years holed up in his
"fortified compound" near
Aspen, Colorado.
Unfortunately, all of the
meaty autobiographical bits
are jumbled, scrambled and
buried between unrelated,
random rants about whatever
catches Thompson's fancy.
From a distance, anyway, it
looks like Thompson's post
'7os output has been increas
ingly indulgent and unfo
cused, and "Kingdom of Fear"

definitely follows this trend.
This statement may surprise some people: "Wait... you
wanted control and discipline from the man who wrote 'Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas'?!?"
Well, yeah. Thompson's earlier works may indeed have in
deed crossed into the absurd and the downright insane, but
they were also sharply observed, deeply intelligent and very,
very funny. Thompson found larger meanings, symbols and
foreshadowings in very specific stories. In "Kingdom of Fear,"
there isn't enough narrative to ground his ranting, making
him veer dangerously close to his drug-crazed parody in
"Doonesbury," Uncle Duke.
The reason that the real Hunter S. Thompson and his best
work will endure long after the cartoonish imitators is the gen
uinely righteous anger and indignation that underlying all of
his writing. He's not JUST a dope fiend, he also has a welcome
suspicion of any and all of those in power and a willingness to
blast with fiery indignation anyone he catches in a lie or
hypocrisy. Thompson the Angry Old Man is in full force in

"Kingdom of Fear," looking over the entrails of the 20th cen
tury and arguing pretty damn persuasively that the powerful
corporate cabals that control our nation have brought us to the
End Times.
Clearly, Thompson still has plenty to say. If only he had re
ally focused on saying it, instead of getting lost in a wilderness
of digressions and anecdotes.
As I mentioned, Thompson hasn't always done too well
when fictionalized or mythologized. Uncle Duke is a gibbering
buffoon, and journalists' soundbite descriptions of the King of
Gonzo often can't look past the craziness. Writer Warren Ellis,
however, really understands why Thompson matters, and in
the character of journalist Spider Jerusalem, hero of the
graphic novel series "Transmetropolitan," Ellis nails, above
all, the mad passion.
"Transmetropolitan" was one of the titles jostling for the
position ofa new "Sandman," a series read by both comic book
geeks and the more open-minded of the literary intelligentsia.
Like Neil Caiman's "Sandman," Ellis' series was published
by Vertigo (DC's "mature readers" line), was designed as a fi
nite storyline (in fact, it recently ended as planned after Issue
60) and the collections often feature intros by celebs and writ
ers in the hopes of lending the proceedings a cachet of cool
ness and credibility.
"Spider's Thrash," the latest "Transmetropolitan" collection
(it features an introduction by Darren Aranofsky, the director of
"Pi" and "Requiem fora Dream"), finds us mid-story. Drug
consuming, hate-filled-profanity-spewing outlaw journalist Spi
der Jerusalem, after publishing a damning expose of many
Washington insiders (most significantly, his arch-nemesis Pres
ident Callahan), has gone into hiding. Fired from his post at the
prestigious newspaper The Word and pursued by invisible as
sassins, Jerusalem remains undeterred in his crusade and sets
up shop with at a small pirate paper called The Hole.

This newest installment
in the "Transmet" story
line is hardly Ellis' and
penciling cohort Darick
Robertson's best work
(first-time readers are ad
vised to start with the
debut collection "Back on
the Streets" or the brilliant
anthology "Lust for Life"),
but it effectively moves the
story along. Jerusalem is as
compellingly ornery and
frustratingly cantankerous
as ever, and the cyber
punkish City [yeah, this is
meant to be capitalized be
cause they never refer to
the city by name.] he in
habits thrums with dirty,
glorious life, illuminated
by Fllis's electric prose and
Robertson's lovingly de
tailed drawings.
The reason that I love
"Transmetropolitan" is
the same reason I love
Hunter S. Thompson at
his best: They have an
undying respect for the
truth, a belief that with the
right words and the right
facts directed at the right
places, one can truly
change the world.

"Journalism is for the madly passionate," Jerusalem insists
in "Spider's Thrash." "It's for the intense and the half-fucking
mad and the people who give a shit."
Hunter S. Thompson and Spider Jerusalem have both seen
better days, but I still salute two half-fucking-mad geniuses
who give a shit and inspire us to do the same.

nite storyline (in fact, it recently ended as planned after Issue
60) and the collections often feature intros by celebs and writ
ers in the hopes of lending the proceedings a cachet of cool
ness and credibility.
"Spider's Thrash," the latest "Transmetropolitan" collection
(it features an introduction by Darren Aranofsky, the director of
"Pi" and "Requiem fora Dream"), finds us mid-story. Drug
consuming, hate-filled-profanity-spewing outlaw journalist Spi
der Jerusalem, after publishing a damning expose of many
Washington insiders (most significantly, his arch-nemesis Pres
ident Callahan), has gone into hiding. Fired from his post at the
prestigious newspaper The Word and pursued by invisible as
sassins, Jerusalem remains undeterred in his crusade and sets
up shop with at a small pirate paper called The Hole.

This newest installment
in the "Transmet" story
line is hardly Ellis' and
penciling cohort Darick
Robertson's best work
(first-time readers are ad
vised to start with the
debut collection "Back on
the Streets" or the brilliant
anthology "Lust for Life"),
but it effectively moves the
story along. Jerusalem is as
compellingly ornery and
frustratingly cantankerous
as ever, and the cyber
punkish City [yeah, this is
meant to be capitalized be
cause they never refer to
the city by name.] he in
habits thrums with dirty,
glorious life, illuminated
by Fllis's electric prose and
Robertson's lovingly de
tailed drawings.
The reason that I love
"Transmetropolitan" is
the same reason I love
Hunter S. Thompson at
his best: They have an
undying respect for the
truth, a belief that with the
right words and the right
facts directed at the right
places, one can truly
change the world.

"Journalism is for the madly passionate," Jerusalem insists
in "Spider's Thrash." "It's for the intense and the half-fucking
mad and the people who give a shit."
Hunter S. Thompson and Spider Jerusalem have both seen
better days, but I still salute two half-fucking-mad geniuses
who give a shit and inspire us to do the same.

111 Hunter S. Thompson

"I like this book, and I especially like the title, which pretty
well sums up the foul nature of life in the U.S.A. in these first
few bloody years of the post-American century," declares leg
endary gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in the intro
duction to his angry, rambling and at times savagely funny
memoir, "Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-
Crossed Child in the Final Days of the American Century."
"Only a fool or a whore would call it anything else," he adds.
Thompson has often said that his beat as ajournalist is "the
death of the American Dream," starting with the wild motor
cycle gangs of his first book "Hell's Angels" and moving on to
the deranged, drug-soaked weekend described in "Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas" and Richard Nixon's presidential re
election campaign in "Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign
Trail 72."
In "Kingdom of Fear," he turns his perceptive eye and off
the-wall sensibilities to his own life.
Or at least, that's the general idea. This "memoir" is far
from a standard autobiography; it jumps around the past

seemingly at random, begin
ning with Thompson's first en
counter with the FBI at the age
of nine ("Never believe the first
tiling an FBI agent tells you
about anything . . . ") and end
ing with the early days of his
relationship with his compan
ion and assistant, Anita Bej
muk. In between, he talks
about his 1970 campaign to be
sheriff of Aspen on the Freak
Power ticket, his successful
struggle against charges of as
sault and drug abuse in 1990
and his stints as a correspon
dent and cultural ambassador
in Vietnam and Cuba. It's def
initely an eye-opener for those
who, like me, used to think
that Thompson's just spent the
last 20 years holed up in his
"fortified compound" near
Aspen, Colorado.
Unfortunately, all of the
meaty autobiographical bits
are jumbled, scrambled and
buried between unrelated,
random rants about whatever
catches Thompson's fancy.
From a distance, anyway, it
looks like Thompson's post
'7os output has been increas
ingly indulgent and unfo
cused, and "Kingdom of Fear"

definitely follows this trend.
This statement may surprise some people: "Wait... you
wanted control and discipline from the man who wrote 'Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas'?!?"
Well, yeah. Thompson's earlier works may indeed have in
deed crossed into the absurd and the downright insane, but
they were also sharply observed, deeply intelligent and very,
very funny. Thompson found larger meanings, symbols and
foreshadowings in very specific stories. In "Kingdom of Fear,"
there isn't enough narrative to ground his ranting, making
him veer dangerously close to his drug-crazed parody in
"Doonesbury," Uncle Duke.
The reason that the real Hunter S. Thompson and his best
work will endure long after the cartoonish imitators is the gen
uinely righteous anger and indignation that underlying all of
his writing. He's not JUST a dope fiend, he also has a welcome
suspicion of any and all of those in power and a willingness to
blast with fiery indignation anyone he catches in a lie or
hypocrisy. Thompson the Angry Old Man is in full force in

"Kingdom of Fear," looking over the entrails of the 20th cen
tury and arguing pretty damn persuasively that the powerful
corporate cabals that control our nation have brought us to the
End Times.
Clearly, Thompson still has plenty to say. If only he had re
ally focused on saying it, instead of getting lost in a wilderness
of digressions and anecdotes.
As I mentioned, Thompson hasn't always done too well
when fictionalized or mythologized. Uncle Duke is a gibbering
buffoon, and journalists' soundbite descriptions of the King of
Gonzo often can't look past the craziness. Writer Warren Ellis,
however, really understands why Thompson matters, and in
the character of journalist Spider Jerusalem, hero of the
graphic novel series "Transmetropolitan," Ellis nails, above
all, the mad passion.
"Transmetropolitan" was one of the titles jostling for the
position ofa new "Sandman," a series read by both comic book
geeks and the more open-minded of the literary intelligentsia.
