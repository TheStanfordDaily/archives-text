# Take me to your leader: Geek sex, part deux
## Editors note: This is the conclusion of Roxy's two-part series on the joy of geek sex 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Two weeks ago, your beloved Roxy
wrote about the undiscovered splendor
of geeks and where to nab them. I as
sume that you've all been hard at work
taking my advice and now have a geek
of your own to play with.
Now what? Because of my unerring
commitment to helping Stanford stu
dents get it on in all sorts of awesome
and creative ways, I've researched some
traditionally "geeky" sex practices. The
world of geek sex may be frighteningly
dorky to many. But geek or no geek,
anyone with an appropriately open
mind can have a little fun with these
methods.
Let's start with cybersex. I have to
say, it's not my cup of tea. A while back,
I tried it and found it horribly unsatis
fying. Imagine this: You're resplendent
in your finest mismatched pajamas and
one sweat-sock; your breath smells like
a wet sack of trash. Your honey of the

minute types, "Sukk my cock ur boobs
R2hott." Needless to say, I was not
transported.
But for all of you who don't have easy
access to your loved ones, this might be
better than nothing. In my opinion, the
best cybersex serves to create even more
sexual tension, so that the next time you
meet, you're so keyed up you could
laser off his flimsy boxers using your
eyes. Maybe. Just remember, if you're
going to do it, do it right. Nothing kills
the cybersexin' mood more than bad
spelling ("sukk," anyone?) and careless
grammar.
Now I'm going to delve into one of
the geekiest of all pursuits, so geeky it
almost passes the boundary into deep
dorkiness: role-playing. Don't give a
shit about D&D? "Vampire: The Mas
querade" gets on your nerves? Don't let
this put a damper on your bedtime fun!
If role-playing annoys the hell out of
you outside of the bedroom, that's all
the more the reason to translate it into
some steamy, sexy fun.
Perhaps you will feel silly wearing
that gold-painted, jeweled codpiece or
that black velvet cape with nothing un

derneath. Perhaps you might be
dressed up as the luscious Deanna Troi
or Seven of Nine, your space-age nip
ples poking out of your second-skin
jumpsuit. (Remember this: Every man,
geek or jock, secretly wants you to dress
as Princess Leia in the gold bikini.)
Forget your embarrassment. Geeks
love dress-up! So will you when your
geek thanks you in all sorts of delightful
ways. Just don't be surprised when the
neighbors complain about you stream
ing, "Oh, Christ of [or some other made
up name of his choosing] of Clan Bru
jah, TAKE ME!" as you claw his back.
You know, dear readers, I was going
to say more, I really was. Rut I'm about
to fulfill a man's adolescence-long fan
tasy of a trapped Princess Leia, and
shocker of shockers, he's the only one
who can rescue her! So if you're reading
these words with a tinge of envy (you
subversive dork, you) then put this
paper down and get on it. You owe it to
yourself and your soon-to-be-orgasmic
geeky loved one.
