# 'Quiet American' may create thoughtful Americans
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
Delayed by more than a year from its original fall 2001
release date, director Phillip Noyce's adaptation of Gra
ham Greene's novel "The Quiet American" has finally ar
rived— a beautiful, thought-provoking exploration of
American naivete and British cynicism in politics and love.
The film begins with a nighttime shot of small boats sit-

ting low in the water, their lanterns illuminating the
darkness. The moment of silent, mysterious beau- \
tv ends when we hear the voice ofThomas Fowler
(Michael Caine), the film's narrator.
"I can't say what made me fall in love with Viet
nam," he tells us. A few moments later: "The smell,
that's the first thing that hits you. It promises you
everything in exchange for your soul."
The time and place are Saigon, 1952; Fowler's
meditations are soon interrupted by the discovery

of a dead body in the water — Alden Pyle (Brendan Eras
er), the titular "quiet American," a supposed aid worker
from the United States and a friend of Fowler. He was
stabbed, then thrown in the water, and we quickly jump
into the past to learn exactly how and why this quiet Amer
ican was killed.
The clock now turned back, we see Fowler — a bored,
detached foreign correspondent for the London Times —
peacefully passing his days in Vietnam, filing a story every
once in a while. Most of his time is occupied by an affair
with Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen), a young Vietnamese
woman. Despite the violent conflict between the French
and the Vietnamese, Fowler is bored and content.
This comes to a halt with the arrival of Pyle, "the face
with no history and no problems." Pyle is in many ways
Fowler's opposite — brash and idealistic, as opposed to
Fowler's reserved cynicism — but he too quickly becomes

infatuated with Phuong. As Fowler learns
that I Me, unsurprisingly, is not exactly who

he claims to be, the political and romantic
lives of the two men become increasingly en
tangled.
Politics aside, the film works first and
foremost because it has a powerful story to

■r / —
tell. As with any good ad
venture, Noyce (whose

best work in the last decade lias
,u, i ~;.i» tv«w

probably been with Lom
Clancy political thrillers,
especially "Clear and Pre
sent Danger") moves
"The Quiet American"
along at a brisk pace,
quickly setting up its char-

acters and pitting Fowler and Pyle

against each other, slowly and carefully unraveling the lies
that both men's current lives are built on.
When Fowler loudly declares his objectivity and de
tachment early in the film, the audience immediately real
izes that by the end he will learn that "Sooner or
later ... one has to take sides, if one is to remain human."
However, it's still a captivating transformation to watch,
especially as embodied by the seemingly effortless natural
ism and charm of Cain's performance.
None of the other actors impress as strongly, largely be
cause the story's other characters are more one-dimen
sional. Still. Fraser is perfectly cast as the dangerously boy
ish Pyle, and Yen's wide eyes and small smile give the au
dience at least a hint of why two men might compete so
madly for her affections.
"The Quiet American" also boasts stunning visuals —
from the dark, intrigue-filled streets of Saigon to the lush

mystery of die Vietnam jungles — visuals lor which Noyce
must share credit with Wong Kar Wai's cinematographer
Christopher Doyle. And it's not just pretty pictures, but,
when need be, a devastating recreation of the horrors of
war.
And thus, we come around again to politics. T he film
was shelved post Sept. 11 due to its supposedly anti-Amer
ican attitude, and I can see why some might be upset — in
many ways, the story echoes the portrait of American in
nocence abroad found in Hie Third Man," a Greene
scripted classic noir, hut "The Quiet American" is, ulti
mately, meaner and more damning.
Yet the film's ideas are not limited to "800 America!"
but extend to a far more relevant and morally ambiguous
critique of a person being so convinced of his lightness that
he refiises to see the consequences of his actions. This is a
lesson that zealots on both the left and the right should be
exposed to.
