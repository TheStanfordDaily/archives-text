# With increased police presence, bikers learn...
## Rules of the road 
### MADHAVI DEVASHER CONTRIBUTING WRITKR 
After several months of in
creased efforts to promote bicycle
safety, campus officials and stu
dents report an increased aware
ness of bicycle laws and general
precautions.
According to Ariadne Scott,
campus bicycle coordinator, bicy
cle registration has increased 300
percent.
However, many students say
the instances of ticketing by Stan
ford Police have also increased
over the past few months.
Freshman Abdulla AlMisnad
received a ticket for biking with
out a headlight and advocated
personal choice in deciding what
safety measures to follow.
"If you get hit because you
don't have a headlight, its your
own damn fault," AlMisnad said.

"Instead, what you have are po
licemen hiding behind corners
pouncing on you as you bike by."
Others felt that the police too
often focused on minor offenses.
Freshman Lara Burenin received
a ticket for riding double on a
one-seater bike.
"It just seems very ironic to me
that policemen are spending
their time giving tickets to people
who don't have bike lights when
cars, much more dangerous vehi
cles than bicycles, run the stop
sign on Mayfield countless times
each day."'
I lowever, Deputy Ken Bates
viewed the situation from a differ
ent perspective. He said that, as a
police officer watching an inter
section, he sees cars stop at stop
signs regularly whereas countless
bikes consistently run the sign. Ac

week in White Plaza. Police have spent the last several months trying to increase bike safety.
cording to Bates, "Bikes are the
greater problem."
To some, Stanford's bicycling
environment often appears law
less and chaotic. Scott said that
many pedestrians are intimidated
by bikers speeding past them
when they walk around White
Plaza or other intersections — es
pecially the intersection next to
the Outer Quad and Clock Tower
nicknamed the "intersection of
death."
"Pedestrians have right of
way," she said. She suggested that
bikers warn pedestrians when
passing them on a bike. Her edu
cation campaign focuses on
"bringing back common sense
and courtesy."
The University has been in
creasingly involved in improving
bicycle safety on campus through
education and incentives. The
President's Office recently funded
a campaign to distribute free bike
lights to students when they regis
ter their bikes. According to Scott,
4,600 bike lights have been in
stalled since the program began
last September.
Alan Acosta, associate vice
president and director of Univer
sity Communications said, "The
seriousness of the problem led
[University] President [John]
Hennessy and others to focus on
specific measures to improve
safety for both bicyclists and
pedestrians."
According to Scott, the pro
gram has been an immense suc
cess. Bicycle headlights are vital
for safety because they increase
visibility at night. For the small
cost of registering a bicycle, stu
dents receive a bike light worth
$20.
Senior Zoe Chafe, a residential
assistant in Faisan, said, "It really
makes such a difference . . . You
see all these lights in the distance
instead of wheels three feet in
front. Now, I notice when people
aren't using bike lights rather
than noticing when they are."
Scott is also involved in pro

moting other educational pro
grams to encourage a "safer cy
cling environment." Her efforts
include a bicycle safety issues
"road show" in dorms, a training
seminar for RAs and peer health
educators, a "Zen of Biking"
video and even a comic book su
perhero known as "Sprocket
Man" who promotes bicycle safe
ty-
Scott wants to "target incoming
freshmen" because "many haven't
ridden a bike in years and don't
know that there's a lot of proto
col." She believes that by educat
ing freshmen to follow bicycle
laws, the University has made an
investment that will last four years
and contribute to a safer overall
campus biking environment.
According to regulations, bikes
need to be registered, equipped
with a headlight and back reflec
tor during the "hours of dark
ness" and follow all traffic laws ap
plicable to cars.
The California Vehicle Code
states, "Every person riding a bi
cycle upon a street or highway
has all the rights and is subject to
all the duties applicable to the
driver of a vehicle." This includes
stopping at stop sign, something
which most bikers never do, ac
cording to students and officers.
Matt Chwierut, a freshman, re
ceived a ticket of more than $100
for running a stop sign. He ac
knowledged his mistake yet ques
tioned the fairness of ticketing
only a few people when most bik
ers on campus disobey traffic laws.
Bates responded by saying
that it is impossible for officers
to stop everyone who violates
the law. He said that even if a
huge dragnet was placed across
an intersection that stopped
everyone who ran a stop sign, by
law, an officer is unable to de
tain an individual for longer
than it takes to carry out the
legal proceedings.
For example, an officer cannot
stop 10 students and make them
all wait as he writes each one a
ticket. Rather, Bates feels that
when other students see one or
two get stopped fora warning or
a citation, they start thinking
about following the laws.
