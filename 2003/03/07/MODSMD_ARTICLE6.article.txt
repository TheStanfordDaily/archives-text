# With increased police presence, bikers learn...
## Rules of the road

After several months of in
creased efforts to promote bicycle
safety, campus officials and stu
dents report an increased aware
ness of bicycle laws and general
precautions.
According to Ariadne Scott,
campus bicycle coordinator, bicy
cle registration has increased 300
percent.
However, many students say
the instances of ticketing by Stan
ford Police have also increased
over the past few months.
Freshman Abdulla AlMisnad
received a ticket for biking with
out a headlight and advocated
personal choice in deciding what
safety measures to follow.
"If you get hit because you
don't have a headlight, its your
own damn fault," AlMisnad said.

"Instead, what you have are po
licemen hiding behind corners
pouncing on you as you bike by."
Others felt that the police too
often focused on minor offenses.
Freshman Lara Burenin received
a ticket for riding double on a
one-seater bike.
"It just seems very ironic to me
that policemen are spending
their time giving tickets to people
who don't have bike lights when
cars, much more dangerous vehi
cles than bicycles, run the stop
sign on Mayfield countless times
each day."'
I lowever, Deputy Ken Bates
viewed the situation from a differ
ent perspective. He said that, as a
police officer watching an inter
section, he sees cars stop at stop
signs regularly whereas countless
bikes consistently run the sign. Ac
