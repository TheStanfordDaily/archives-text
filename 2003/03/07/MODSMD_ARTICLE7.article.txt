# Scholar offers new insight into Rwandan genocide

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
UC-Berkeley political science doctor
al candidate Scott Straus lias dedicated
himself to understanding the 1994
Rwandan genocide. Yesterday after

noon at the Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation, Straus used his
findings to offer new insight into the pat
terns of genocide in Rwanda.
"The abundance of commentary on
the Rwandan genocide has created the il
lusion that we understand what went

on," Straus said. "Rwanda is a case about
which much has been written, but we are
still in a fairly early stage of presenting an
explanation."
Straus explained that after the assas
sination of 21-year President Juvenal
1 labyarimana on April 6, 1994, the cen
tral African nation was plunged into a
100-day campaign of violence in which
half a million Tutsis were killed. In con
trast, only 10,000 Hutus, the other
major ethnic group in Rwanda, were
killed before the rebel army, RDF, took
control of the country and ended the
genocide. Most of the victims were un
armed civilians.
Straus questioned the idea that the vi
olence was the result of long-standing
enmity between the two ethnic groups.
1 le cited the hundreds of interviews
he has conducted with Rwandans cur
rently imprisoned for their roles in the
genocide, saying that "very, very few of
them seemed to believe in this racial
ideology."
In an attempt to determine exactly
what was at the root of the genocide,
Straus has compiled extensive quantita
tive data. Ninety-six percent of the pris
oners he interviewed had Tutsi neigh
bors and OH percent had Tutsi relatives
through intermarriage.
He said that, contrary to common l>e
lief, "the more integrated a society, the
more likely genoc ide [is]."

Straus latched onto youth and wealth
as statistically significant factors in the
onset of genocide.
"The areas that were the wealthiest
in Rwanda were the areas where vio
lence starts earliest, which goes directly
against the frustration-aggression ar
gument . . . that the poorest areas
would have the most violence," Straus
explained.
Straus argued that political and mili
tary authorities in Rwanda sparked the
conflagi at i< >n (>f vie )lence.
"Once the dynamic of violence starts
in a community, there is a turn to mass
mobilization," he said. "Those people
who say no are killed ... and that exam
ple spreads as rumor across the country.
You get a relatively small group of peo
ple who do the majority of the killing and
the majority of the intimidating, com
prised largely 0f... youth and people
with military training."
Straus' data broke down the onset of
violence in regions of Rwanda day-by
day. He felt that the quickness with
which genocide struck different areas
might be linked to important causal
factors.
He found that, despite differing re
gional proclivities toward genocide,
every region not controlled by the RDF
eventually succumbed to violence — vio-

lence which killed similar percent
ages ofTutsis in each region.
"Despite earlier violence [in] some
places and greater resistance in some
areas, once the violence starts, it's all
the same," Straus said. "My inter
views widi perpetrators show that
once the violence starts, you see a
group of rural elite who take control
of the commune and make sure they

have as many participants as they
can, [who believe that] it is better for
me to go out and join this group of at
tackers, otherwise I will be killed."
While appreciative of Straus' in
tensive research, some in the audi
ence— which was comprised of
several dozen CI SAC fellows and
both undergraduate and graduate
students — questioned just how
much could safely be inferred from
the quantitative data.
"You're not going to find that ed
ucation changed whether this started
on Tuesday or Thursday," said Ben

Valentino of the Institute for Interna
tional Studies in reference to Straus'
assertion that wealth and education
were factors in the onset of violence.
Straus also touched on the pre
ventable nature of the genocide,
pointing to the lack of action by the
international community and orga
nizations like the United Nations.
"Two weeks into the genocide,
if you'd had an intervention force
going, you could've saved half [of
the victims]," he said. "I still think
this was a very preventable geno
cide."
