# Chorale debuts 'Flight of Song' in U.S.

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
English choral folk songs are
not likely to be part of the average
student's musical diet, but the
Stanford Chamber Chorale will set
out to convince them differently at
tonight's "Flight of Song" concert.
Named after a work by English
composer Howard Skempton, the
piece will make its U.S. debut this
evening.
The concert, sponsored by the
Music Department, will feature a
diversity of music from both Amer
ican and British choral traditions,
including works by Britten, Finzi
and Matthias.
"The chorale's repertoire spans
western choral music from chant
through the 20th century with a
focus on the most challenging a
cappella literature," saicl tenor
Daniel Fink, a sophomore.
Skempton's "Flight of Song" is
unique in that it is comprised of a
cycle of pieces which parallel the
poems of Henry Wordsworth
Longfellow.
According to Stephen Sano, the
chorale's director, the pieces se
lected for the concert will take full
advantage of the fantastic
acoustics Memorial Church has to
offer.
"Performing in Memorial
Church is an amazing experience
with the stunning architecture and
acoustics," said bass David Hole.
"We [will] sing all the stuff you
would expect to be sung in cathe
drals in Europe," said tenor Justin
Meyer, a junior.
In fact, the concert's British
theme is appropriate in light of the
group's upcoming trip through
England and Wales in the last two
weeks of June, during which they
will perform in many of the most fa
mous choral venues in the United
Kingdom, including Wells Cathe
dral, Salisbury Cathedral and New
College Chapel in Oxford.
In the past several years the
group has also toured in Japan,
Seattle, Victoria and Vancouver,
alternating between domestic and

international destinations.
The emphasis on travel and cul
tural diversity is reflected in the
chorale's performances.
"When we go on tour, we in
corporate music lrom the choral
tradition of the area we are visit
ing, like Japanese or Hawaiian
choral music," said soprano Alisa
Baxter, a senior.
The group performs music
from all over the world, ranging
from ancient chants and motets
to the works of Chinese compos
er Chen Yi and contemporary
Bay Area composer Paul Crab
tree.
"We have sung Hawaiian,
Spanish, Norwegian and African
inspired music, often in the origi
nal languages," Meyer said. "We
also sing very modern pieces that
are technically very difficult."
The student-run Chamber
Chorale is touted as the most selec
tive singing group on campus, as

the current 25 members were se
lected from over 150 students who
auditioned at the beginning of fall
quarter.
According to Sano, his goal in
auditions is to select the voices that
work best as a team, considering
blend, balance and tone.
Although the group is affiliated
with the Music Department, it is
not exclusively for music majors.
"We have engineers, pre-meds,
social scientists, humanists and fine
artists all together," said soprano
Emily Pew. "The graduate/un
dergraduate and fuzzy / techie di
visions are all but non-existent in
our music."
The chamber chorale presents
one formal concert in Memorial
Church every quarter and can be
found performing at a variety of
other University events including
Commencement, Admit Week
end, Alumni Weekend and Cantor
Art Center celebrations.

"The attendance is usually very
good, though it tends to decline
over the year," Hole said. "This
quarter we're having a major mar
keting effort to get graduate stu
dents to attend, and we've been
lucky in getting some really good
support from the residences."
Many of the chorale's members
praised the artistic respect and
close ties that have formed be
tween them since the beginning of
the year.
"Chorale is one of the reasons I
came to Stanford," Fink said. "It
truly is an ensemble of profession
al caliber [and is] comprised of
many of the friendliest and most
talented musicians on campus."
Tonight's concert begins at 8
p.m in Memorial Church and
will be open to the public. Tickets
cost $5 for students and $10 for
general admission and are avail
able through the Stanford Ticket
Office.
