### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat spent yesterday studying a parliamentary mea
sure to name a prime minister with authority over in
ternal affairs, sending the bill to a Justice Ministry
committee instead of signing it as expected.
The Palestinian parliament approved creation of
the new position on Monday after Arafat succumbed
to intense world and local pressure to relinquish some
of his powers. The parliament would have to vote on
the position again if Arafat asks for changes.
On Monday, the measure passed two readings
by identical 73-1 votes. Arafat aide Nabil Abu
Rdeneh said Arafat would sign it in the next two
days, then appoint his longtime deputy, Mahmoud
Abbas, as premier.

According to the bill, Arafat retains authority over
security forces and peace negotiations.
Abu Rdeneh said now that the Palestinians have
fulfilled U.S. and European demands to appoint a
prime minister, international mediators must
"press the Israeli government to stop aggression
and withdraw from Palestinian areas to give hope
again to the region."
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher emphasized that the prime minister
must have powers and authority.
"I think the bottom line for us is that there was a
significant definition of powers and that we look for
ward to seeing it work out in practice and how it works
out in practice," Boucher said.
