PUEBLAâ€” Overseas Studies
announced in early February that it
would be discontinuing its pro
grams in Puebla, Mexico and
Buenos Aires, Argentina due to lack

of student
and faculty
interest
combined

with OSP's desire to allow students
to take classes at a Stanford center
rather than a local university.
In Puebla, Stanford students
enroll in the Universidad de las
Americas de Puebla, one of the
most prestigious universities in
Mexico. Hundreds of students
from all over the world study at the
U 1)1 A every semester. The major
ity of international students hail
from North America, Europe and
South America.
Because the UDIA is on the se
mester system, it offers special
classes taught for Stanford stu
dents by UDLA professors. How
ever, students may enroll in regu
lar classes with Mexican students
as well.
As part of the program, Stan
ford students live in on-campus
dormitories with Mexican room
mates, allowing students to inte
grate in both a social and academ
ic environment.
"Being able to live with other
students on campus, in the dormi
tories, has been wonderful in help

ing me to feel like I'm really a part
of this community," said senior
Andrea Amico who is currently
studying in Puebla.
In addition, there are four cul
tural trips planned throughout
the quarter so that students can
learn more about surrounding
areas. These cultural trips include
archaeological sites such as Monte
Alban in Oaxaca to the Palacio de
Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) in
Mexico City.
"Due to the unique nature of
Mexico, which has a wealth of dif
ferent places and cultures, all with
in driving distance, we have been
able to experience a great diversity
of people outside of the school it
self," Amico said.
OSP-Puebla students partici
pate in community service,
which can range from teaching
English at a local elementary
school to interning at the presti
gious Museo Amparo. Teaching
English at a poor school in
Puebla has been one of the most
rewarding experiences of my
stay. One can learn a lot about a
culture from its children.
The Puebla program oilers stu
dents substantial immersion not
only in the Spanish language, but
also in Mexican culture, institu
tions and society.
"The greatest benefit of this
program, in which Stanford col
laborated with UDLA, rather than
with only itself, has been the at
tainment of a higher level of cul
tural immersion than would not
have been possible otherwise,"
Amico said.
Stanford students in Puebla ex

pressed their disappointment with
the University's decision to discon
tinue the program.
"The six of us here in Puebla
have enjoyed ourselves so much
that we are saddened that others
will not have the same opportuni
ties that we had," said junior Toni
Harris.
"I couldn't believe it when I
heard the OSP program in Puebla
was closing its doors, and frankly I
don't agree with any of the reasons
that were given to us," Amico said.
UDLA professor Enrique Car
denas agreed, "It seems just natur
al that Stanford should have a pro
gram here, given the fact that
Mexico is the second largest trade
partner to the United States, has a
very long border and many other
common concerns."
In turn, OSP's decision has
caused many to question Stan
ford's commitment to Latin
American education. Last year
Stanford eliminated its under
graduate and graduate programs
in Latin American Studies, mak
ing these studies available exclu
sively at the honors level.
"I feel like Stanford is gradually
turning its back on Latin Ameri
ca," Harris said.
Whether or not this is true, Stan
ford students agree that the Univer
sity is losing a hidden gem among its
overseas studies programs.
"My sadness in seeing this pro
gram go is not for myself," Amico
said. "But for those who will not
have the opportunity to see and
experience what I can only de
scribe as some of the most reward
ing times of my life."
