## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Covering the health basics 
### 
Conservative estimates show that
approximately 42 million people
in the United States do not have
health insurance. Under such
dire conditions, many people often do not
get adequate health care. Although many
Stanford graduate students are partially
covered under the current plan, the re
sults of an online survey conducted by the
Graduate Health Task Force released last
month found that many Stanford gradu
ate students do not have dental and vision
insurance.
Approximately 1,200 students re
sponded to the survey. The results are
concerning: 78 percent said they did not
have dental insurance; 17 percent said
they had not had a dental checkup in the
last two years, whereas regular visits are
recommended every six months. Addi
tionally, only 9 percent had vision insur
ance, and 61 percents of the respondents
said they had not had a vision checkup in
the past year.
Cardinal Care, the University's insur
ance provider, does not offer dental or vi
sion benefits. The task force is hoping to
change this lack of health coverage.
Several students on the task force —
including Grace Chang, co-chair of the
Graduate Students Council — plan to
forward a full proposal for increased
health coverage to University President
John Hennessy. The recommendation
will ask that at the very least, the Universi
ty add dental coverage to Cardinal Care
and increase subsidies to relieve students
of the extra costs.
The efforts to bring better health care
to graduate students are commendable.
I n many cases, the well-being of students
depends on it. Regular dental and vision
checkups should be considered a neces
sity, not a luxury. According to the
American Dental Association, these ap
pointments are essential to maintain the
dental health of patients and without
them, cavities can lead to root canals and
other painful and costly dental proce
dures.
Vision health insurance is just as im
portant, especially since 75 percent of the
respondents to the survey said they wore
glasses or contact lenses. Under Cardinal
Care, eye and hearing exams are covered
with a $ 10 co-payment, a benefit that most
students did not known about, according

to the survey. This coverage should be bet
ter publicized.
Furthermore, Cardinal Care does not
cover what many consider the chief cost of
vision care — the cost of new glasses and
contact lenses. At a minimum, graduate
students should be able to get a new pre
scription for their glasses through their
insurance plan. The lack of such a benefit
may cause many students to postpone
checkups. The outcome of not receiving
proper eye care and living with uncor
rected poor vision can be grave. Students
drive. They bike. They need to be able to
read lecture slides, notes and books.
A spokesperson from Vaden Health
Center has said that adding either dental
or vision benefits to the coverage plan of
graduate students may not be possible, es
pecially given the escalating insurance
rates in the Bay Area. But about two
thirds of the respondents to the survey
said that they would be willing to pay as
much as $50 per quarter for dental cover
age, while the same proportion said they
would pay up to $15 more for vision ben
efits.
Surely a compromise can be reached.
This year's Cardinal Care premium for
students not receiving a stipend or fellow
ship is $ 1,440 per year. Other colleges in
California include more benefits in their
insurance plans, and in some cases cost
less. At UC-Berkeley, graduate students
pay only $556 a year for medical coverage
that includes dental benefits. And the Cal
tech program fully funds health insur
ance for all of its graduate students.
The task force has already presented a
preliminary version of the survey results
to several University administrators, in
cluding Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni, Provost John
Etchemendy and Director of the Vaden
Health Center Ira Friedman. We hope
they are persuaded by the arguments pro
posed by the task force and that the Uni
versity finds a way to expand graduate
health benefits to include dental and vi
sion coverage.
After graduation, some students may
have to face a situation where they do not
receive health insurance through their
employment. Yet while they are busy with
their education, students should not have
to worry about a lack of health insurance
coverage.
