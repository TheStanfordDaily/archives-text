Making conscious safety
choices as a bicycle rider
is important, necessary
As a student and a cyclist, I
would like to respond to this
week's discourse on bicycles.
First, I want to praise the letter
"The Daily's support of student
strike 'a naked attempt to delegit
imize supports of the war" (March
6). The bicycle is a viable, essential
form of transportation, and in
deed the most efficient; it should
be the cornerstone of any sustain
able transportation system. For
freshmen and others who do not
own cars, bicycles can also mean
the difference between mobility
and dependence.
But debating the merits of
walking vs. biking or biking vs.
public transportation quickly be
comes silly. All are necessary parts
of a good, multi-modal trans
portation system. Some are better
than others for certain applica
tions; none are convenient or effi
cient for all uses. Even cars have a
place. The problem in our coun
try is that cars have been favored

to the exclusion of all other modes
of transportation: our govern
ment subsidizes them, our cities
are built around them, and the
cars themselves are far less effi
cient than they could be.
I was also pleased by the article
on bicycle safety, "With increased
police presence, bikers learn the
rules of the road," (March 7) a sig
nificant problem on this campus. I
know the sudden zealousness of
the campus police is a shock for
those receiving tickets.
But on the whole I think it's pos
itive. I've been hit by a car. I was fol
lowing all the traffic rules: it was
broad daylight, I was on-campus
and the driver still didn't see me. I
have to tell you, cars are pretty big
and pretty solid. They hurt. I worry
that students grow accustomed to
always having the right of way
when they ride on campus, and that
when they decide to leave Stan
ford's forgiving streets, or when a
car simply cannot see them coming,
they will get hurt, maybe even die.
I also want to draw attention to
another safety issue: poor bicycle
maintenance. Many Stanford stu
dents ride bike with brakes that
don't work, with wheels that are
falling apart and with barely in
flated tires. Not only do these

problems make riding a chore,
they can impede your ability to re
spond in an emergency. I encour
age everyone to take get their
bikes tuned up periodically, either
by a local bike shop or someone
knowledgeable.
The March 7 article featured a
picture of JefT Fisher fixing bicy
cles in White Plaza; he and I are
founding members of the Stan
ford Bike Advocates, a group ded
icated to promoting safe, conve
nient bicycle use at Stanford by
providing technical support, ad
vice and access to tools.
Right now, we are working to
establish a dorm-based Residen
tial Bicycle Coordinator position
to address the challenges present
ed by bicycles on this campus. If
you're interested in the idea or
just have questions about bikes,
you can contact me at
millermw@stanford.edu.
Finally, I encourage students to
give biking a chance. Next time
you go into Palo Alto, try riding
there. It's quicker and easier than
you think. Now is your chance to
experience the alternative to a life
spent stuck in traffic.
