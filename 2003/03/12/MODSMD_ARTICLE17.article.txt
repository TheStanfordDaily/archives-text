# THE 						FROSH FILES
## Return of the nerds 
### 
Okay, I'll admit it — I am a freshman, and
I am in SLE. Now that it's off my chest, I
feel a lot better. You may groan, or wince
or eye me with pity. You may gag, recoil
or ask me, "Why?"

Every time I tell someone I am in
SLE (Structured Liberal Educa
tion), I get a reaction not unlike the
ones I describe above. It's funny. I
would have thought that at an in
tellectually vibrant school such as
Stanford, there would be more re
spect fora three-quarter program
that features a study of most of the
great books, writers, poets and
philosophers of all time. The gang
is all here: Homer, Plato, Cer-

vantes, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Shelley, Nietzsche
and many more.
Yet, the I-Hum-happy freshman class ostracizes
us SLE kids because we choose to partake in a pro
gram that challenges us to utilize the great works, to
question our thoughts and expand our worldview.
Isn't that why most of us came to Stanford?
In high school, you were the nerd. Admit it. You
wouldn't be here at Stanford if you didn't take all
the Honors or AP classes, participated in the Aca-

demic Decathlon
or joined the Na
tional Honor Soci
ety. We are all intel
lectuals. We should
celebrate educa
tion and bask in
our perpetual state
of lucubration.
Here at Stan
ford, our nerdiness
does not stand out
as much, not when
every other person
was the valedictori
an of his high
school or scored
1600 on her SATs
— we can be part of
the "regular" pop
ulation. I believe
the reason why so
much SLE-fear is
going around is be
cause SLE repre
sents that state in
high school when
we were so clearly
the "nerds" - re
moved from the
general crowd be
cause of our intel
lectual pursuits.
No matter how
far we want to be

removed from it, we are all still the same nerds in
side. Projecting our insecurities on other groups
won't change that. It just serves as another re
minder of what we really are, what we should em
brace and yet irrationally shun.
The bar has been raised in college, and instead of
going above it, most of us simply choose to go with
the flow: get decent grades, get our degree, get into
grad school or get a cushy job. A few of us choose to
stay above the bar. We go that extra mile in order to

satiate our brains. We want to know more and we'll
do whatever it takes.
While I am on the subject of nerds, I would like
to take the time to address some stereotypes that us
"SLEazy" kids have to put up with.
We have a reputation for being hardcore. But
running down two flights of stairs in sandals to lis
ten to a lecturer in the lounge hardly defines hard
core for me. Yes, we read insane amounts of litera
ture. But it's nine units. Imagine taking two I-Hum
classes simultaneously— that's what it feels like. It's
insane, but not impossible.
Another stereotype about SLEers is that we talk
about books all the time. I admit, we do talk a lot
about what we read when we're outside the class
room, but imagine if half of your dorm was taking
the same I-Hum, wouldn't people tend to talk more
about the reading? It's simply a product of every
one living in the same cluster of dorms. Besides,
what is so wrong with talking about Machiavelli
over dinner or discussing Aristotle in the laundry
room? Education and learning should take place
anywhere at anytime, not just from 1 - 1:50 p.m. in
section.
As for me, I must confess I wasn't enjoying my
experience in SLE first quarter. I was excited about
the fact that I would get to live with the people I

would be studying
with, but that excite
ment quickly trans
formed into anxiety.
I cowered. I thought
I couldn't cut it in a
program that had a
reputation for being
hardcore in one of
the nation's pre
miere universities.
For most of the fall
quarter, I read for
the sake of getting
work done, not for
the sake of learning.
It was over winter
break that every
thing changed. At
home, I looked back
on the previous
months and was
shocked to discover
that, while I had
read so many well
renowned books, I
had barely learned
anything. In my
drive to get through
school, I forgot my
education. I made a
vow to rediscover
my passion for
knowledge, and SLE
was waiting for me

when I returned in January.
While we all have various reasons for being here
at Stanford, I like to think that one thing we have in
common is a thirst for knowledge. We shouldn't be
afraid of wanting to know more, of taking that extra
step to find out what or why or how. We are all
nerds, like it or not. Deep down, we are all SLE kids.

Are you a wannabe SLE kid? Tell me about it at mosque
