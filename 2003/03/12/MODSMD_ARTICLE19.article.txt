# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Toyon fondly remembers its resident fellow 
### PAYAL DALAL GUEST COLUMNIST 
T he halls of Toyon are solemn and quiet, the
heart of Toyon, heavy. Since the passing of Rolf
Faste, director of the Product Design Program and
beloved resident fellow, nothing has quite been the
same. Rolf inspired many and loved so many more.
At a time when life feels so hectic, we would like to
remember the man who told us to slow down, ad
just our bearings and enjoy the breeze in our sails.
We will miss Rolfs lessons, be they engineering or
life. He was first and foremost a teacher; he loved his
students with infinite kindness and patience and de
fended his residents with reason and compassion.
Rolf taught us to drive stick shift, to build model
yachts, to draw stick figures, to unlock the magic of
brain gym, to map minds. He helped us balance our
priorities and find rationality amidst chaos. He cap
tured our imaginations with stories of boat races,
garage sales, artistic inventions. He inspired us to be
lieve in the possibilities, not the final product.
We will miss Rolf s enthusiasm. Rolf, at his 28th
Toyon special dinner, imagined himself to be the
Wizard of Oz and draped himself in a curtain and
attached a persistent Toto to his heel. He outdid
most of the residents and played along with the

craziness inherent in Toyon special dinners. We re
member Rolf s cheer as he made his eggs in the Ter
race every morning. Rolf always smiled brightly as
he walked to the eating clubs for lunch on sunny
days, and everyday, he biked through the Quad in
the afternoon with contagious happiness and spirit.
We had long conversations about the Norwegian

pronunciation of names, and we laughed at his se
cret closet of boats on the second floor. Rolf patient
ly encouraged us to build a human pyramid on the
beach and freely offered to be part of the base. He
relentlessly protected our right to throw campus
parties and bought the dorm every available kind of
chocolate during finals week.

We will miss Rolfs creativity. He spent endless
hours assembling photo collages and making model
yachts. He exhibited his art and sailed his creations.
He loved improvisational dance, the dramatics of
architecture, the beauty of body movement and the
merging of disciplines. He did not see boundaries,
and he did not care for limits. He saw beauty and
possibility in everything and in all of us.
We will miss Rolfs endless affection. Rolf loved res
idential education, and he loved Toyon. His concern
for us was unquestionable, his dedication unwaver
ing. We remember his joy at seeing us succeed and his
empathy and support when we failed. We remember
his constant protective watch over the dorm and his
humor and calm in times of pandemonium. We re
member his attendance at house meetings and his
participation in study breaks. We remember the hall
check-ins, and most of all, we remember his hugs.
As the time and grief pass, we will strive to re
member Rolf and all that he encompassed and in
spired. His memory will continue to live within the
walls of Toyon and in the winds of all our future
voyages. We will miss you, Rolf.

Senior Payal Dalai is a resident assistant in Toyon. A
memorial service will be held in honor of Rolf Faste on Fri
day, March 21, from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Toyon Lounge.
