## Asian-American stereotypes reexamined, deconstructed 
### BRYAN KIM CHRIS YAP GUEST COLUMNISTS 
types of Asian Americans starkly contrast
with today's model minority and re
pressed sexual stereotypes. George's state
ment clearly reflects the white working
class interests of America's industrial age;
these stereotypes formed the basis of Asian
exclusion policies. Today's Asian-Ameri
can stereotypes also reflect dominant mo
tivations and interests.
The model minority myth arose from a
specific historical context and was pro
pelled by a political motive of dominant
society. The term "model minority" was
first coined by sociologist William Peter
son in 1960. His New York Times article,
"Success Story: Japanese American Style,"
praised Japanese Americans for not be
coming a "problem minority" and cited
the Japanese Americans' cultural values
and hard work ethics. The model minori
ty paradigm became a popular theme
throughout the Civil Rights era.
Feng dismisses the idea that the model
minority thesis could be used as an op
pressing point of comparison for other mi
norities. He wrote, "Besides, whom are
Asians supposed to be strutting down the
catwalk for? Other minorities?" During
the Civil Rights era, the model minority
thesis became an oppressing point of com
parison between Asian Americans and
"other minorities."
Heralding Asian Americans as the
model minority was a way for the domi
nant white society to blame the "other mi
norities" for their lack of political, social
and economic power. Asian Americans
were also portrayed as the silent minority,
implying that being the silent minority was
the good minority. Also, under increasing
international scrutiny, the racist and op
pressive American society pointed to the
model minority as evidence of a colorblind
meritocracy, which obviously didn't exist.

"A population born in China ... utter
heathens, treacherous, sensual, cowardly,
cruel. They practice all the unnameable
(sic) vices of the East."
—Henry George,
"The Chinese in California" 1869
Stereotypes have a way of naturalizing
themselves — before long, societies begin
to accept stereotypes as true, making way
for biologically determined notions of
racial characteristics. Despite good inten
tions, Charles Feng, in his column "Asian
Stereotypes Examined" (March 4), fails to
deconstruct the stereotypes he brings to
the table.
I wonder if Feng internalizes and natu
ralizes these stereotypes himself, as he
seems to buy into the socially constructed
notion that Asian Americans are a "weak
race." He insists that "these stereotypes
must have some basis, or else they wouldn't
have arisen in the first place." The general
maxim of "stereotypes must have some
truth" is often quoted and often wrong.
Blacks are often stereotyped as savages
of a lower intellect. Latinos are often
stereotyped as dirty "wetbacks." 1 dare
Feng to apply the same "stereotypes must
have some basis" logic to these'stereotypes.
These stereotypes are not only politically
incorrect but grossly incorrect.
Stereotypes are often popular expres
sions of dominant racist ideologies. To
truly examine stereotypes, one needs to
understand the historical contexts from
which these racial attitudes arose, rather
than re-affirm their prevalence from a
contemporary perspective.
The quotation of Henry George above
illustrates that pre-World War II stereo-

Stereotypes deserve more than a cursory treatment. They are used
to systematically disadvantage all oppressed members of society.
They are social constructs imbued with harmful social and politi
cal motivations. Deconstructing stereotypes will move America
one step closer to a truly egalitarian society

The model minority thesis resurged
back in the American consciousness dur
ing the 1980s, also under a political histor
ical context. Newsweek's "The Drive to
Excel" (April 1984) and Time's "The New
Whiz Kids" (August 1987) highlighted the
academic successes of Asian Americans.
The model minority thesis was once again
applied fora political purpose — this time
to justify fiscal cutbacks for social services
and to attack affirmative action. A seem
ingly harmless stereotype justified the re
gression of the advances made during the
Civil Rights era.
'Hie model minority myth does injustice
to the diversity of the Asian-American com
munity. Feng's take on the model minority
thesis is limited by his privileged, middle
class, East-Asian perspective. It doesn't do
justice to the Southeast-Asian refugees strug
gling to make a living. Or the South-Asian
population that does not share characteristic
East-Asian phenotype and culture. Only 20
percent of Chinese Americans live under the
poverty level, compared to 60 percent of Fil
ipino Americans (the largest Asian ethnic
group in California). Generalizations sweep
the heterogeneity of Asian Americans under
an overwhelming stereotype.
Feng also buys into the stereotyped no
tions of second generation "culture clash

es" between a supposed conservative
"Asian culture" and American ideals. He
argues that academic excellence and
shunning sports are somehow inherently
a characteristic of "Asian ideals." Once
again, we need to examine the manufac
turing of a foreign culture within the po
litical and social context of American soci
ety. There are political and social motiva
tions in painting Asia as a bastion of Con
fucian ideals and conservative backward
ness, especially when it accentuates sup
posed American liberal ideals and
progress. I ask myself, why was I assigned
to read Amy Tan multiple times through
out my pre-college academic career? Is
Amy Tan such a great representative of
Asian-American culture or is it maybe be
cause she presents a non-threatening, per
verse image of Asian and Asian-American
culture that is acceptable to American soci
ety? Asian Americans should question the
stereotyped paradigm of culture clash fed
to them by the dominant society.
I am not trying to argue that Feng has
not lived through some of the stereotyped
notions of being a second generation
Asian American. However, sometimes
parents are simply being parents. He
needs to be careful when attributing cer
tain stereotyped notions to an imagined

homeland culture.
I share Feng's optimism that Asian
Americans will eventually gain equality
across all aspects of American society. I dis
agree with his assumption that time will au
tomatically improve our collective destiny.
I remember our proactive Civil Rights
leaders — political activists Yuri Kochiya
ma, Estella Habal and Stanford History
Prof. Gordon Chang — who fought to get
Asian Americans to where we are today. I
look to our current leaders — like legal ac
tivist Victor Hwang, Stanford alumnae
and community activist Jane Kim and au
thor Vijay Prashad —to continue our
struggle. Systematic racism still plagues
our American society, and we cannot pin
our hopes on a laissez-faire approach.
Stereotypes deserve more than a curso
ry treatment. They are used to systemati
cally disadvantage all oppressed members
of society. They feed off of each other.
Asian American stereotypes exist because
Black, Native American, and Latino
stereotypes exist as points of contrast and
vice versa.
Feng represents a positive aspect of the
Stanford community — a willingness to
examine stereotypes with an open mind. I
applaud him for the audacity to tackle
such a big topic. I hope he, along with the
rest of the Stanford community, will even
tually realize that stereotypes are social
constructs imbued with harmful social and
political motivations. Deconstructing
stereotypes will move America one step
closer to a truly egalitarian society, which
is one ideal I hope we can all agree upon.
