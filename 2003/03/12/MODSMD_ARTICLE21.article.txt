# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Campus anti-war strike reflects student empowerment 
### VALARIE KAUR BRAR GUEST COLUMNIST 
I woke up at 10 a.m. on March 5 to the
sound of my alarm. I had planned to join
the student strike early in the day and
march to Hoover Tower. I had often com
plained about complacency on campus
and students' silence in the face of political
turmoil and social injustice, so I felt that
this morning was important.
But I didn't feel excited. Instead, a
wave of frustration with the world, help
lessness in the face of the pending war
and lack of confidence in my own voice
came over me. What difference does it re
ally make whether or not I go? It was so
much simpler to return to my slumber, to
the isolation of my own mind and
dreams. So I did.
I woke up again at noon, slowly got
ready and wandered into the Main Quad.
What I found amazed me. Banners that
read "Books Not Bombs," "Remember
1984" and "No War on Iraq" were strung
in between columns. Crowds of students
surrounded professors who spoke about

oil and power, and war and peace. People
were wearing green sashes sat on the
ground, listening and applauding, wear
ing green sashes.
Energy everywhere. And not the frantic
protest energy that bystanders walk past
and laugh off as radical or irrational. The
energy was creative, positive and all-inclu
sive. It was grounded in academic serious
ness and profound concern. It felt calm
and authentic and, well, powerful. When I
walked into the Quad, the crowd immedi
ately took me in from the fringes and
made me part of the movement. I listened
to Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo,
found my friends and marveled at the or
ganization of the strike.
Students began speaking and suddenly
someone asked me to speak. The person
handed me the microphone and I was on
stage. I briefly experienced a moment of
nervousness and fear, and then I crossed
over it. I spoke. And it all spilled out: my
stories about violence and prejudice
against Sikhs with turbans and anyone
with brown skin, my concern about unjust
policies permitted by socialized fear, my

own disheartenment and the way I found
hope.
I finally connected my documentary
(and honors thesis) about post-Sept. 11
hate crimes with the war on Iraq: The
same socialized fear that motivates post-
Sept. 11 racial prejudice also supports si
lence in the face of unjust policies that vio
late civil liberties and permit war. And
now, the Bush administration will spill
blood in our name, hiding shameful pur
poses behind noble reasons, and we are
silent because we are afraid.
When I spoke, something unhinged in
side of me. Some knot in the center of my
body loosened and fell away. I liatl been
silent for months. While I had sent mass e
mails about the war, talked with my
friends and worked privately on my thesis,
I had lost confidence in my public voice. I
had lost faith in my ability to protest seri
ously and speak with conviction, and,
when it comes down to it, make a real dif
ference.
Every morning for the past few months,
when I shook off my sleep and remem
bered the state of the world, I hesitated. I

paused. I didn't want to start my day. I
didn't want to embrace my privileged life
while my government prepared to kill in
nocent people in my name. I didn't want
to think about hate crimes, war crimes or
violence. I didn't want to contemplate my
confusion or helplessness. I didn't want to
own my place in the world.
But at the strike, I listened and spoke
and undid the knot inside. I was freed. I
felt empowered again. I realized that my
voice counts â€” that our voices count. Our
personal stories can inspire and enrich
each other. Hundreds of conversations
sprang from every speech and perfor
mance given at last Wednesday's strike. In
speaking with one another, we are shap
ing our collective consciousness. And this
is the site of social transformation.
I will not be afraid anymore. I will not
cower away from this world or hide from
it. When the world's madness makes me
want to turn off the alarm and stay be
neath the blankets, I will choose to own my
life. I will choose to believe in my voice be
cause our public voices can make a differ
ence in peoples' lives and, most impor

tantly, in our own.
No matter what our political posi
tions, as students, we are more empow
ered than we can imagine. We are the
young, independent and intelligent peo
ple who have inherited this world. We
can change ourselves and inspire change
in one another. When we see something
unjust, our silence is complicity; our in
action is death. If we desire change, we
must speak. If we're shy speakers, we
must write. If we're poor writers, we
must march. If we're tired marchers, we
must sing. If we're tone deaf (like me), we
must dance.
However, when we decide to express
our public voices, it will be powerful and
poetic like last Wednesday's performance
by Stanford's Spoken Word. It will be as
tute and intelligent like the protest lec
tures and teach-ins by our professors. It
will be infused with our energy. It will
mean something.
