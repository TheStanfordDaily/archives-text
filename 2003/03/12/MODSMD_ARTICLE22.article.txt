# Fliers claim int'l grad students take U.S. jobs

### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
A group of Stanford students complaining
that the flood of skilled international graduate
students is making the job search more diffi
cult for U.S. citizens posted fliers throughout
east campus graduate student residences at
the beginning of the month. Posters reading
"Beware! HIB and LI visa programs forcing
Americans into unemployment" appeared in
Escondido Village and Rains Houses, provok
ing many graduate students to label the claims
racist and ignorant.
An HIB is a non-immigrant classification
used by an alien who will be employed tem
porarily in a specialty occupation, according
to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration
Services. Jobs for technicians, lawyers, doctors
and accountants, among others, qualify as
types of specialty occupations.
.According to students rallying against the
HIB programs, who call themselves "HIB
nonbelievers," the U.S. government unneces
sarily issues too many HIB visas to internation
al graduate students, allowing these students to
compete, often successfully, with U.S. citizens

for jobs in the U .S. job market. The fliers also
identified Asians and Indians as most responsi
ble for unemployment in the United States.
"If the jobs exist and there are not enough
engineers to fill them, bring in outsiders to fill
the gaps," said Brad Peters, a senior majoring
in computer science at Oregon State Univer
sity who has organized the movement against
the HIB program and collaborated with stu
dents at Stanford. "That was a fine idea in
1999, but today, these gaps simply do not
exist. Despite this, the INS program continues
to bring specialists into the country... Un
employment for engineers has now reached
almost 5 percent, the highest it has ever been."
According to Peters, many Stanford stu
dents involved in this movement are ethnic
minorities who are U.S. citizens. The HIB
nonbelievers hope to convince Congress to re
duce the number of H1 Bs permitted.
The fliers agitated many of the Stanford
graduate students not in the HIB movement.
Psychology doctoral candidate Corinna
Loeckenhoff informed students in graduate
residences of these iliers by e-mail.
"The majority of international students do
not stay in the U.S. and compete for the job

market," Loeckenhoff said. "Also, a lot of HIB
visa holders are actively recruited by Ameri
can companies in their home country. Thus, it
is not true that all international students even
tually end up on a work visa."
Loeckenhoff also mentioned that she was
upset with the way the flier focuses on Indians
and Asians as the main problem.
"Claims that international students are
'funded by American academic dollars' fail to
mention that most students work hard as re
search and teaching assistants," she said,
"[and its] claiming that international students
are 'forcing Americans into unemployment.'"
Peters stressed that, contrary to what objec
tions people who saw these posters may have,
the HIB movement is not a racial one.
"American jobs should go to Americans
first, be they black, white, Indian, Mexican,
Asian or anything else," Peters said. "From the
perspective of America, however, by flooding
even the most skilled of fields with workers
from all over the world, Congress, the INS,
and the trend of globalization as a whole is
making it impossible for new college gradu-
