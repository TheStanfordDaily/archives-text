# ASSU Senate meeting

### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
A proposal to add survey
questions to the April elections
ballot was brought to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate last
night. Senate Chair Bo Cowgill, a
senior, sponsored the bill in the
hopes of gathering opinions on
issues and candidates.
The proposal would allow any
student to place a survey ques
tion on the ballot.
"I thought this would be a
good idea because more people
show up to vote than any other
survey opportunity on campus,"

Cowgill said.
However, some senators
raised concerns about the pro
posal.
"This bill creates a section of
the election policies that is not
in the Constitution," said Sena
tor Hiro Iwanaga, a senior.
"That, I think, is inherently
problematic."
The bill was tabled for further
discussion.
Also, Cowgill announced that
a server crash had eliminated the
appropriations Web site and the
elections voting Web site. Re
building the Web site will begin
next senate meeting and hope
fully be completed by the week
after for elections.
