# Stanford Band names new tree mascot
## 
### JENNIE KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Fans at last Saturday's men's basketball
game were treated to an unusual spectacle at
halftime: The birth of a tree. More specifically,
the reenacted birth of William Rothacker Jr.,
the new Stanford Tree — the infamous Stan
ford Band mascot bequeathed with scores of
enviable traditional duties such as performing
at high-profile sporting events, fending off at
tacks by the Cal Bear at the Big Game, kissing
hundreds of Stanford freshmen at Full Moon
on the Quad and representing the general fun
loving zaniness of the student body.
So how did Rothacker, a sophomore mem
ber of Theta Delta Chi, outshine nine other
candidates to become the new Tree? The
Band's press representative, junior Moses
Pounds, cited "his unique mix of glad-handling
prom king charisma and serial killer intensity."
The outgoing Tree, sophomore Andrew Park
er, said the clincher was "his utter disregard for
his own personal safety."
According to Band members, Rothacker dis
played these traits prominently during Tree
Week, the week of pranks and death-defying
demonstrations that prove to the Band a candi
date's commitment to become the Tree.
Rothacker said he employed his love for
physics to pull off his first stunt, allegedly
building a catapult to launch himself over the
trees by Lagunita and into the lake. He calls

the experience "perfect and fortunately timed
since there was water in the lake this year."
The second stunt, however, was less than
perfect. In an attempt to skydive and land atop
Hoover Tower, Rothacker said he neglected to
calculate for the updraft that caught his para
chute at the last moment, causing a precipitous
slide oft his target. His hopes only temporarily
abated, William knew he had to perform a truly
dazzling final stunt to recoup.
Luckily, he succeeded in compensating
for the previous stunt's failure with his un
precedented finale: An impromptu, highly
sophisticated medical operation. With the
compliance of a fellow Theta Delt patient,
Rothacker claims to have performed a kid
ney-switching., Parker and Charles Arm
strong, who was Tree before Parker, said
they witnessed the feat; both labeled it"a
marvel of modern medicine."
Former Trees Parker, Armstrong and Evan
Maugher, who was Tree from 1999 to 2000,
said that an element of destiny surrounded
William's appointment, as all claim to have
shared eerily similar dreams about him.
"William was riding a white obelisk, hurling
lightning bolts like Zeus while under siege by a
figure called 'President Cristal.' " Maugher
said, describing the basic premise of the dream.
Rothacker attributed his successful cam
paign to more than destiny. While he believes
he was meant to be Tree sometime during his
Stanford career, he acknowledged the role that

hard work and determination played in his ap
pointment.

Theta Delt guys, especially my roommate,
