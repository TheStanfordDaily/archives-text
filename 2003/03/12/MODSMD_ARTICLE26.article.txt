The Coolest Place in the Universe

NASA's Hubble telescope recently
took new pictures of the bow-tie
shaped Boomerang Nebula, known to
be the coolest place in the universe.
The average temperature there is
negative 272 degrees Celsius, only one
degree higher than absolute zero (the
lowest possible temperature). The
nebula is also the only object known
with a temperature lower than cosmic

microwave background radiation, which is believed to
be the relics of the Big Bang. At the center is an old,
dying star that is spewing ultra-cold gas. Astronomers
believe that the rapid expansion of the nebula explains
why it is so cold.
Pain is Relative
People's perception of pain varies tremendously. It
turns out some of it has a genetic component. Univer
sity of Michigan researchers found that the COMT
gene helps regulate endorphins, the body's natural
painkillers. The gene comes in two different forms: val-
COMT with the amino acid valine and met-COMT
with the amino acid methionine. People with two
copies of the val gene were stoic, those with two copies
of the met gene were most sensitive and people with
one copy of each were in between. In the U.S. popula
tion, both genes are distributed roughly equally, so
one-quarter of the population is in each extreme and
half is in the middle. To quantify the pain, the team ob
served how brain cells reacted when individuals were
put under stress by injecting saline solutions into their
jaw muscles.
Single Molecule Switches
Physicists have created electric switches from a single
molecule, which would greatly save power. The study
was published in Physical Review Letters by a team

from University of
Basel, IMB-Zurich
and CEMES-CNRS
Lab in Toulouse,
France. The switch is
a porphyrin mole
cule (the prefix
"pory" in Latin
means hole) and the
orientation of its legs
indicates either an on
or off state. Switching
the orientation of the

legs requires relatively little energy, considerably less
than that required for switches currently in use, which
are based on solid-state integrated circuits. "This switch
could be used to make storage and logic devices, but
there are still many problems to be solved," said Chris
tian Loppacher, one of the researchers in the group.
The Right Gas for your Car
So your car is running low on gas and you stop by the
pump to fill it up. Octane-89, octane-91... which one to
use? In the engine, fuel and air are compressed and
then ignited to release energy. Fuel is a mixture of hy
drocarbons with varying rates of combustion, like slow
burning iso-octane and fast-burning n-heptane. Oc
tane-87 gasoline burns at a rate similar to a mixture of
87 percent isooctane and 13 percent n-heptane. The
higher the octane rating, the slower it will burn. The
right fuel for your car is the one that burns at just the
right rate to avoid engine "knocking." A higher octane
number doesn't necessarily mean more power. It is
more expensive because it is more difficult to make.
Most car owners recommend using the regular octane
-87, unless your car is specifically built for higher grades.
To Drink or not to Drink?
Wine is good for you. Wine is bad for you. There are
studies lending support to either side of the debate. Ac
cording to one study by Dr. Arthur Klatsky published
in Scientific American, after three decades of research
scientists are coming to the consensus that drinking
small to moderate amounts of alcohol may have car
diovascular benefits. People with such habits had high
er amounts of good cholesterol and stronger hearts. As
a consequence, their arteries had considerably less clog
ging (or atherosclerosis) and their risk of stroke was
lower. Of course, drinking can cause other problems,
ranging from liver damage (or cirrhosis), high blood
pressure and accumulation of fat. Klatsky warned
against using alcohol's possible benefits as a justification
for excess consumption.
Quantum Computers?
Once just a theory, quantum computers are becoming
a reality. A quantum computer of even a few atoms
could outperform the fastest supercomputers. Theory
suggests that an undisturbed particle can occupy dif
ferent states simultaneously. Thus, an electron could
possibly exist as both a positive and a negative spin,
which means that a single digit could represent both a
zero and a one in a computer at the same time. Sounds
impossible? Researchers in the Netherlands and Japan
recently reported in Nature that they had built a small
device from these principles to factor the number 15.
Don't expect to have a quantum computer sitting on
your desk anytime soon though, since many challenges
lie ahead. For instance, to keep electrons undisturbed,
the calculations have to be performed at a temperature
near absolute zero.
