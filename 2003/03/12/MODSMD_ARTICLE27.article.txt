# Bush's hydrogen future:
## Profs Welcome Hydrogen Initiative 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
An increase in national research funds following
President Bush's announcement of a massive hydro
gen fuel initiative in his State of the Union address
will probably benefit Stanford, professors say.
The president's initiative calls for spending $1.2
billion, about half of which is new funding, on hydro
gen fueled cars.
"With a new national commitment, our scientists
and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these
cars from laboratory to showroom," Bush said.
Stanford professors agree that a new national pro
gram was a step in the right direction.
"I'm pleased to see the emphasis from the admin
istration," said Engineering Prof. Fritz Prinz, who is
researching hydrogen fuel cells. "When [the admin
istration] came into office it didn't look like it would
place an emphasis on [the environment]."
"It will increase the public awareness of the op
portunities in this field," Prinz added.
Many scientists see hydrogen as one of the most
promising technologies for the future. When hydro
gen burns, the only byproduct is water. Fuel cells,
some of which can also burn more conventional fuels,
are also much more efficient than the internal com
bustion engine. Whereas the internal combustion en
gine converts about 15 percent of the stored energy
in gasoline into usable energy to power a car, fuel
cells' efficiency can be as high as 40 or 50 percent.
There are many speed bumps on the road to a hy
drogen-based economy, however, and professors
were quick to note that no one knew when hydrogen
will reach a critical mass.
"It's not going to happen soon," Prinz said. "It's
not economical right now."
Prinz noted that neither hydrogen nor fuel cells
currently exist in cost-effective forms, and there is not
much research going on at Stanford that will help hy
drogen cars get on the road tomorrow. But in a
decade, technology developed at Stanford may be
important in different aspects of the hydrogen cycle
that will power the lifestyles of the future.
Prinz is researching methods of creating smaller,
more efficient fuel cells using oxides instead of poly
mers, the technology currently used. With funding
from Honda and the new Global Climate and Ener

gy Project, Prinz is developing tools and techniques
to manipulate individual atoms to increase 112 uel cell
efficiency.
Chemical Engineering Prof. Jim Swartz and Civil
and Environmental Engineering Assoc. Prof. Alfred
Spormann are researching ways to genetically engi
neer cells to produce hydrogen.
"It's the most speculative but also the most in
triguing avenue," Prinz said.
If cells could produce hydrogen, currently only a
theoretical possibility, this process would bypass one

of the current obstacles: how the hydrogen used in
cars should be produced.
Prof. Lynn Orr, director of G-CEP, noted that hy
drogen is one of the four main components of the
more than $100 million research effort announced
last year. For him, the focus is not on fuel cells or effi
ciency but where the hydrogen comes from.
"If we could find a way to make the hydrogen di
rectly without using electricity, it would be ideal," he
said.
Current hydrogen technologies use electricity
from conventional power plants to create the hydro
gen. While power plants are twice as efficient as in
ternal combustion engines, many environmentalists
worry that Bush's focus on hydrogen fuel ignores
where the energy comes from in the first place.
Orr noted that for the sake of the environment, a
technology that does not emit much carbon dioxide,
or some place to put the carbon dioxide that is emit
ted is necessary.
Prinz said that although reliance on fossil fuels in
stead of renewable energy totfnake hydrogen is a
valid concern, fossil fuels are not going to disappear
in 10 years.
"There are a number of ways to generate hydro
gen," he said. "You could use, for example, solar
power or nuclear reactions."
Other environmentalists argue that Bush's new
emphasis on hydrogen fuel masks the continued
usage of fossil fuels, the source of the hydrogen itself.
But Prinz disagrees. "To infer that Bush is devious
[for focusing on hydrogen rather than renewables] is
a naive argument," he added.
Timeframes for when hydrogen technologies will
be put in place is just speculation, professors empha
sized.
"The technology is the easy part, then comes eco
nomics, then comes politics," said Aldo da Rosa, pro
fessor emeritus of electrical engineering. "Who is
going to bet % 1 billion on it right now?"
Da Rosa said he thinks the timeframe for fuel cells
will depend on striking the right balance between
federal and private funding, but he is sure that in the
future most people will be driving fuel-cell-powered
cars.
"Next year there will be quite a number of cars on
the market," he said. "There is no conceivable reason
why fuel cells will not take over."
