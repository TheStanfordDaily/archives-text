All addictive drugs affect the same
part of the brain, researchers say
Although varieties of addictive drugs appear to
have different effects on those that use them, re
searchers at the Stanford Medical Center have
found that all addictive drugs make the same
change to the same part of the brain. The mecha
nism of t his change is unique to each drug, but the
product of addiction is universal, officials report.
"Different classes of drugs of addiction like co
caine, morphine, amphetamines, nicotine and al
cohol all cause the same modification at the same
synapse," said Dr. Robert Malenka, the Nancy
Friend Pritzker professor in psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences at the Stanford School of Medicine.
Malenka is the lead author of his research team's
paper, published in the journal Neuron in Febru
ary.
The acute response to addictive drug exposure
in the brain is an increase in the level of the neu
rotransmitter dopamine. In the presence of an ad
dictive drug, excitatory synapses that make
dopamine are switched on and stimulate the neu
rons in the ventral tegmental area, also know as
VTA, of the brain. This stimulation by excess
dopamine is part of the high people experience
and what is reinforcing to addicts, Malenka said.
"Drugs of addiction produce a higher sensitivi
ty for the triggering mechanisms of the cells that
produce dopamine," said Daniel Saal, a post-doc -
toral fellow in psychiatry, who worked with Malen
ka on the study.
The synapses in the brain that release

dopamine are normally triggered by the chemical
glutamate. In the presence of addictive drugs,
however, the synapses over-register glutamate
and then over-produce dopamine in the VTA,
Saal said. Results from the team's experiments on
mice indicated that exposure to cocaine produced
increased sensitivity to glutamate for over a week.
Stress also causes the same molecular changes
in the brain as addictive drugs cause. "Acute stress
triggers a similar neuro-adaptation in same area of
the brain in the same way," said Yan Dong, a post
doctoral fellow in psychiatry and another member
of Malenka's team. "This implies that stress plays a
role in addiction and relapse," Dong said.
Malenka said that it is often not difficult to get
an addict off of their drug initially. The trouble is
preventing relapse through the ups and downs of
normal life.
When the team administered a drug to the mice
that blocked the molecular effects of stress, the
sensitivity of the glutamate receptors returned to
normal levels, even under stressful conditions.
In contrast, the same sensitivity when cocaine
induced could not be diminished. "This [suggests]
two distinct pathways that converge on enhance
ment of gluatamate sensitivity," Saal said.
Knowing this, the team can study the exact cel
lular and molecular changes that occur in the
brain as a consequence of drug abuse. "That is the
first step to finding better treatments so eventual
ly we can develop medication and prevent re
lapse," Malenka said.
But the neurons that become more sensitive to
glutamate when exposed to drugs of addiction are
also involved in learning and memory, a point the
team makes clear in their research publication.
One challenge in making a treatment for addiction
is how to block the effects of addictive drugs with
out interfering with the neurons involved in learn
ing and memory that also produce dopamine.
Malenka's team worked in the Pritzer laborato
ry in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at the School of Medicine. A grant from
the National Institute of Drug Abuse and a dona
tion from the Alejandro Zaffaroni Innovation
Fund for Addiction Research funded their re
search.
Researchers identify gene that
regulates ]good' cholesterol
Researchers at Stanford Medical Center have
located a gene that regulates levels of HDL choles
terol, also known as "good" cholesterol.

HDL cholesterol — high density lipoproteins
— has been found to lower the risk of coronary
heart disease and strokes.
"These findings may lead to medicine that can
prevent heart disease by regulating the gene func
tion," said Dr. Thomas Quertermous, the William
G. Irwin professor and chief of cardiovascular
medicine at the School of Medicine.
"We were surprised by the results of the project
because they were really more dramatic than we
expected," he added.
According to Quertermous, the project began
three years ago when he found a new endothelial
lipase — also called EL — gene in the walls of
blood vessels and became interested in its capacity
to metabolize complex fats like HDL. Genes in the
lipase family are known to play a role in determin
ing HDL levels.
Using mice as experimental subjects, Querter
mous explained that his team inserted a copy of
(he human EL gene into the DNA of one group of
mice and deleted the mouse EL gene from the
DNA of a second group of mice.
Levels of HDL cholesterol increased by 57 per
cent in the mice whose EL gene was deleted and
decreased by 19 percent in a separate group that
was given human copies.
"We found that mice exhibiting less expression
of the gene have more HDL," said Dr. Allen D.
Cooper, a professor of medicine in the gastroen
terology and hepatology department of the Med
ical Center, who worked with Quertermous on the
research.
"The EL gene that we're interested in is a bad
guy," Quertermous said. "Inhibiting the EL gene
would allow the body to increase its HDL levels
and possibly regulate many negative health risks."
In a report published in the February edition of
the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Querter
mous stated that a higher level of HDL leads to a
lower risk of coronary heart disease.
The team acknowledged that they have no idea
how the EL gene modulates HDL level at this time,
but that this area will be the basis of their work for
the next 10 years.
"We're trying to understand what the EL gene
does to the body as a whole," Cooper said.
"The caveat is that a mouse is not human,"
Quertermous said. "We can't be sure [the gene]
works the same way in the human body."
He added that no medicine currently exists that
can regulate HDL levels. The the possibility of
such a drug might be attractive to pharmaceutical
companies.

The synapses in the brain that release

dopamine are normally triggered by the chemical
glutamate. In the presence of addictive drugs,
however, the synapses over-register glutamate
and then over-produce dopamine in the VTA,
Saal said. Results from the team's experiments on
mice indicated that exposure to cocaine produced
increased sensitivity to glutamate for over a week.
Stress also causes the same molecular changes
in the brain as addictive drugs cause. "Acute stress
triggers a similar neuro-adaptation in same area of
the brain in the same way," said Yan Dong, a post
doctoral fellow in psychiatry and another member
of Malenka's team. "This implies that stress plays a
role in addiction and relapse," Dong said.
Malenka said that it is often not difficult to get
an addict off of their drug initially. The trouble is
preventing relapse through the ups and downs of
normal life.
When the team administered a drug to the mice
that blocked the molecular effects of stress, the
sensitivity of the glutamate receptors returned to
normal levels, even under stressful conditions.
In contrast, the same sensitivity when cocaine
induced could not be diminished. "This [suggests]
two distinct pathways that converge on enhance
ment of gluatamate sensitivity," Saal said.
Knowing this, the team can study the exact cel
lular and molecular changes that occur in the
brain as a consequence of drug abuse. "That is the
first step to finding better treatments so eventual
ly we can develop medication and prevent re
lapse," Malenka said.
But the neurons that become more sensitive to
glutamate when exposed to drugs of addiction are
also involved in learning and memory, a point the
team makes clear in their research publication.
One challenge in making a treatment for addiction
is how to block the effects of addictive drugs with
out interfering with the neurons involved in learn
ing and memory that also produce dopamine.
Malenka's team worked in the Pritzer laborato
ry in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at the School of Medicine. A grant from

Researchers identify gene that
regulates ]good' cholesterol
Researchers at Stanford Medical Center have
located a gene that regulates levels of HDL choles
terol, also known as "good" cholesterol.

HDL cholesterol — high density lipoproteins
— has been found to lower the risk of coronary
heart disease and strokes.
"These findings may lead to medicine that can
prevent heart disease by regulating the gene func
tion," said Dr. Thomas Quertermous, the William
G. Irwin professor and chief of cardiovascular
medicine at the School of Medicine.
"We were surprised by the results of the project
because they were really more dramatic than we
expected," he added.
According to Quertermous, the project began
three years ago when he found a new endothelial
lipase — also called EL — gene in the walls of
blood vessels and became interested in its capacity
to metabolize complex fats like HDL. Genes in the
lipase family are known to play a role in determin
ing HDL levels.
Using mice as experimental subjects, Querter
mous explained that his team inserted a copy of
(he human EL gene into the DNA of one group of
mice and deleted the mouse EL gene from the
DNA of a second group of mice.
Levels of HDL cholesterol increased by 57 per
cent in the mice whose EL gene was deleted and
decreased by 19 percent in a separate group that
was given human copies.
"We found that mice exhibiting less expression
of the gene have more HDL," said Dr. Allen D.
Cooper, a professor of medicine in the gastroen
terology and hepatology department of the Med
ical Center, who worked with Quertermous on the
research.
"The EL gene that we're interested in is a bad
guy," Quertermous said. "Inhibiting the EL gene
would allow the body to increase its HDL levels
and possibly regulate many negative health risks."
In a report published in the February edition of
the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Querter
mous stated that a higher level of HDL leads to a
lower risk of coronary heart disease.
The team acknowledged that they have no idea
how the EL gene modulates HDL level at this time,
but that this area will be the basis of their work for
the next 10 years.
"We're trying to understand what the EL gene
does to the body as a whole," Cooper said.
"The caveat is that a mouse is not human,"
Quertermous said. "We can't be sure [the gene]
works the same way in the human body."
He added that no medicine currently exists that
can regulate HDL levels. The the possibility of
such a drug might be attractive to pharmaceutical
companies.

All addictive drugs affect the same
part of the brain, researchers say
Although varieties of addictive drugs appear to
have different effects on those that use them, re
searchers at the Stanford Medical Center have
found that all addictive drugs make the same
change to the same part of the brain. The mecha
nism of t his change is unique to each drug, but the
product of addiction is universal, officials report.
"Different classes of drugs of addiction like co
caine, morphine, amphetamines, nicotine and al
cohol all cause the same modification at the same
synapse," said Dr. Robert Malenka, the Nancy
Friend Pritzker professor in psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences at the Stanford School of Medicine.
Malenka is the lead author of his research team's
paper, published in the journal Neuron in Febru
ary.
The acute response to addictive drug exposure
in the brain is an increase in the level of the neu
rotransmitter dopamine. In the presence of an ad
dictive drug, excitatory synapses that make
dopamine are switched on and stimulate the neu
rons in the ventral tegmental area, also know as
VTA, of the brain. This stimulation by excess
dopamine is part of the high people experience
and what is reinforcing to addicts, Malenka said.
"Drugs of addiction produce a higher sensitivi
ty for the triggering mechanisms of the cells that
produce dopamine," said Daniel Saal, a post-doc -
toral fellow in psychiatry, who worked with Malen
ka on the study.
The synapses in the brain that release

dopamine are normally triggered by the chemical
glutamate. In the presence of addictive drugs,
however, the synapses over-register glutamate
and then over-produce dopamine in the VTA,
