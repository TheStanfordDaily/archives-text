Viewsonic is known for its high-end computer
monitors. To keep up with the recent Tablet PC
craze, the company's PCVIOO promises to give you
a bang for your buck.
Weighing in at 3.4 lbs, Viewsonic's Tablet PC is
packed with a measly Pentium 111 866 MHz proces
sor, 256 MB of RAM (expandable to 512 MB) and a
20 GB hard drive. Its Intel 82830 graphics acceler
ator that powers the 10.4-inch high resolution flat
panel XGA screen is dedicated to make your com
puting experience a visually pleasant one.
Networking with the PCVIOO is a synch. The
unit has built-in Ethernet and modem ports, and if
you're always on the go, is Wi-Fi ready.
Using Microsoft's Windows XP Tablet PC edi
tion, you are kept at the forefront of software tech
nology. The unit also comes with nifty software util
ities, like a note-taking program for those who want
to venture into the 21st century in class.
As battery life is always an issue with portables,
the PCVIOO's low battery life — compared to HP's
TCIOOO — has room for improvement. With the
battery fully charged and running mainly common
applications like Word and Excel, the PC we tested
lasted for slightly under three hours. However if
you're planning on running processor-intensive
applications, plan on having your power cord.
For those who can't decide whether they want a
desktop or a portable, Viewsonic has the solution.
Accessories to the PCVIOO include a docking sta

tion, a peripheral USB keyboard and an optical
mouse — all sold separately.
Viewsonic's tablet PC phenomenon doesn't
come cheap. The current street price for the
PCVIOO is about $1700. The add-on's cost about
$400 more.
In the end, for those looking fora portable PC at
the cutting edge of technology, the PCVIOO is one
to be considered, though low battery life may give
some second thoughts. If you're a game freak and
can't go to sleep until you pack in two hours of
Quake 111, this product may not be for you.

As one of the cheapest Tablet
PCs available, Compaq's TCIOOO
is well-designed and a pleasure to
use, but it isn't as powerful as its
competitors.
The design of the TCIOOO is its
best feature. The 10.4" screen,
which you can write on with the
Tablet's magnetically tipped pen, is
connected to the keyboard by an in
genious hinge. The design lets you
either write on the Tablet with the
keyboard folded behind the screen,
or fold the keyboard out to turn it
into a regular laptop, or remove the
keyboard altogether and just use the
screen. Although the keyboard is
small, it's nice to type on and the joy
stick mouse controller works well.
At three pounds, the TCIOOO is
lighter than most, and the 1-GHz
Transmeta Crusoe processor's low
energy consumption means that
the battery life is around three
hours. But what you get in long
battery life you lose in perfor
mance — the TCIOOO is less pow
erful than other Intel-based Tablet
PCs. Compaq's Tablet also comes
with 256M8 of memory and a
30GB hard drive.
As far as connectivity goes, the
TCIOOO has network and modem
connections, as well as two USB
ports and a connection for an ex
ternal monitor. There's also a

built-in WiFi card for wireless net
working. If you want to use CDs or
watch DVDs, you'll need to buy a
$300 docking station, which has a
CD/DVD drive included. It takes a
bit of fiddling to attach the Tablet
to the docking station, but once it's
docked, you can choose to use it
lengthways or sideways, and the
screen will automatically update to
suit the orientation you use.

Overall, the TCIOOO feels like
it's well-built and that it would
stand up to the rigors of student
life. Despite being a little under
powered, Compaq's Tablet would
make sense for budget-conscious
students. The big question is
whether you want to pay the pre
mium over a regular laptop just to
be able to have a screen that you
can write on.
