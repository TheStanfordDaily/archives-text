### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Rolf A. Faste, associate profes
sor of mechanical engineering
and resident fellow at Toyon
Hall, passed away Thursday at
his home in Toyon from
esophageal cancer. He was 59.
Faste was well known on cam
pus both as the Toyon RF and as
a teacher, researcher and the di
rector of the Product Design
Program.
"Rolf was an incredible
teacher — he was patient, kind,
gentle and passionate," said
Linda Faste, his wife. "He taught
by his example and his whole
being.
She said that Faste constantly
studied the role the body played
in learning and thinking by

doing Zen meditation, improvi
saiional dance, art and many
other activities. Paste also loved
sailing and sail boats and had a
collection of toy sail boats, pond
yachts and sailing books; Linda
Paste described this as "his pas
sion in life."
She added that Paste was an
RF in Toyon for nine years and
cherished the opportunity to in
teract with students.
"He loved being with stu
dents and often said all profes
sors should live within the dor
mitories to truly understand the
lives of students," Linda Faste
said. "He loved Toyon, he had a
degree in architecture and was
on the renovation committee to
refurbish it. He was so pleased

that it was restored and not mod
ernized and that some of his ideas
were incorporated into the final
plans."
She added, "He had impecca
ble design sense and loved beauti
ful products and buildings and art.
He loved to make things for oth
ers."
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo recognized
the Pastes' role in Toyon residen
tial life.
"This is truly a loss to the resi
dential community where Roll
and Linda successfully created a
warm and supportive home for
hundreds of Stanford undergrad
uates," Camarillo said.
"Rolf said that the primary
goal for the Toyon RFs and staff
was to learn the name of each
Toyon resident so that they
could recognize and call them
by name," Camarillo said. "Such
a simple task over the course of
10 months with 200 students,
but hugely effective in creating
a personal experience for each
student in Toyon. And we all
know that the Fastes . * . go be
yond just knowing their
names."
Senior Emily Duffy, a former
resident of Toyon, agreed.
"Both Roll and Linda made
wonderful efforts to get to know
the residents in Toyon personally,
and considering that it's such an
enormous dorm, their success at
doing so was all the more impres
sive," she said. "It was also just nice
to run into him around the dorm
or campus."
As director of the Product De
sign Program at Stanford, Paste
brought together faculty and stu
dents from the Mechanical Engi
neering and the Art Departments
to create designs that are both in
novative and functional as well as
visually pleasing.
"Rolfs recent work explored

the interactions of the mind, the
body, play and creativity," said
Assoc. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Sheri Sheppard to the
Stanford News Service. "He
helped to expand the entire
product design community's no
tion of innovation. As part of his
teaching, Rolf worked closely
with students in mechanical en
gineering and product design to
help them discover their own
creativity. His tireless pursuit of
new ideas and his uncanny abili
ty to expand conventional think
ing about design will be greatly
missed."
Paste received a bachelor's in
mechanical engineering from the
Stevens Institute of Technology in
1965 and a master's in engineer
ing design from Tufts University
in 1972. In 1977, we graduated
magna cum laude from Syracuse
University with a bachelor's in ar
chitecture. He stayed on at Syra
cuse as a professor of design in the
College of Visual and Performing
Aits before coming to Stanford in
1984.
Paste's scholarship focused
primarily on the role of the mind
and body in creativity, under
standing needs and meanings in
products, also known as
needfinding, and incorporating
engineering, artistic and human
considerations in designing
products. In addition to teaching
courses at Stanford, Paste also
taught at the Stanford Center for
Technology and Innovation in
Kyoto, Japan.
"Rolf was playful, encouraging
and mischievous," Linda Paste
said. "He was a wonderful father
to his two sons, ages 26 and 30, and
a wonderful husband and mate for
me. We were a good team and bal
anced each other perfectly."
Paste is survived by his wife;
sons Trygve Andreas Paste and
Haakon Anthony Paste; mother
Edith Morch Paste; brother Eric
Faste; and sister Andrea Paste.
An open memorial for Faste will
be held in the Toyon Lounge on
Friday, March 21 at 2 p.m.

cherished the opportunity to in
teract with students.
"He loved being with stu
dents and often said all profes
sors should live within the dor
mitories to truly understand the
lives of students," Linda Faste
said. "He loved Toyon, he had a
degree in architecture and was
on the renovation committee to
refurbish it. He was so pleased

that it was restored and not mod
ernized and that some of his ideas
were incorporated into the final
plans."
She added, "He had impecca
ble design sense and loved beauti
ful products and buildings and art.
He loved to make things for oth
ers."
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo recognized
the Pastes' role in Toyon residen
tial life.
"This is truly a loss to the resi
dential community where Roll
and Linda successfully created a
warm and supportive home for
hundreds of Stanford undergrad
uates," Camarillo said.
"Rolf said that the primary
goal for the Toyon RFs and staff
was to learn the name of each
Toyon resident so that they
could recognize and call them
by name," Camarillo said. "Such
a simple task over the course of
10 months with 200 students,
but hugely effective in creating
a personal experience for each
student in Toyon. And we all
know that the Fastes . * . go be
yond just knowing their
names."
Senior Emily Duffy, a former
resident of Toyon, agreed.
"Both Roll and Linda made
wonderful efforts to get to know
the residents in Toyon personally,
and considering that it's such an
enormous dorm, their success at
doing so was all the more impres
sive," she said. "It was also just nice
to run into him around the dorm
or campus."
As director of the Product De
sign Program at Stanford, Paste
brought together faculty and stu
dents from the Mechanical Engi
neering and the Art Departments
to create designs that are both in
novative and functional as well as
visually pleasing.
"Rolfs recent work explored

the interactions of the mind, the
body, play and creativity," said
Assoc. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Sheri Sheppard to the
Stanford News Service. "He
helped to expand the entire
product design community's no
tion of innovation. As part of his
teaching, Rolf worked closely
with students in mechanical en
gineering and product design to
help them discover their own
creativity. His tireless pursuit of
new ideas and his uncanny abili
ty to expand conventional think
ing about design will be greatly
missed."
Paste received a bachelor's in
mechanical engineering from the
Stevens Institute of Technology in
1965 and a master's in engineer
ing design from Tufts University
in 1972. In 1977, we graduated
magna cum laude from Syracuse
University with a bachelor's in ar
chitecture. He stayed on at Syra
cuse as a professor of design in the
College of Visual and Performing
Aits before coming to Stanford in
1984.
Paste's scholarship focused
primarily on the role of the mind
and body in creativity, under
standing needs and meanings in
products, also known as
needfinding, and incorporating
engineering, artistic and human
considerations in designing
products. In addition to teaching
courses at Stanford, Paste also
taught at the Stanford Center for
Technology and Innovation in
Kyoto, Japan.
"Rolf was playful, encouraging
and mischievous," Linda Paste
said. "He was a wonderful father
to his two sons, ages 26 and 30, and
a wonderful husband and mate for
me. We were a good team and bal
anced each other perfectly."
Paste is survived by his wife;
sons Trygve Andreas Paste and
Haakon Anthony Paste; mother
Edith Morch Paste; brother Eric
Faste; and sister Andrea Paste.
An open memorial for Faste will
be held in the Toyon Lounge on
Friday, March 21 at 2 p.m.
