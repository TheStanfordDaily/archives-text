# 'Cartographies of Race' art festival hosts drama ‘Ollin’
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
In a mixture of Spanish and English, with powerful
drumbeats backing up an epic story, Ollin, a short drama
developed in Daniel Valdez's performance workshop,
closed its two-day run last night. The 30-minute play told
the story of Hernan Cortez and the conquering of
Tenochtitlan through song, dance and storytelling.
Ollin is one of several performances in "Cartogra
phies of Race: Mapping Race & Space in California," an
art festival presented by the Institute for Diversity in the
Arts.
Valdez, a guest artist funded by the institute, brought
the script and ideas about his play to his winter quarter
workshop. Then he and his students, along with guest
musicians and members of Valdez's family, spent 10
weeks collaborating, turning a script into a full perfor
mance with music, a colorful set, elaborate masks and
varied costumes.
The result was a new kind of production for Stanford,
Valdez's El Teatro Campesino, which he recreated almost
completely on the Stanford stage.
"It's a musical performance bordering between perfor
mance art and theater," said senior Orlando Lara. "It's sort

of like a creation story, the birth of the mestizo ... a whole
ethnogenesis in 80 days."
Valdez's workshop was just one of four run by the insti
tute that are wrapping up in the beginning of March. On
Friday, Spencer Nakasako's workshop on documentary
film will present short video essays ranging from a look at
"white culture" to a narrative about a freshman living in
Otero. After the videos, a personal narratives class taught by
artists James Luna and Greg Sarris will present stories the
students have written and performed.
Sophomore Jocias Aguiar will be presenting a story
about his first job as a beekeeper in the Imperial Valley and
what that meant to him and his family.
"Writing your own story gives you power," Aguiar said.
"You can go on with daily life and don't feel the necessity of
expressing yourself. This definitely gave me a voice."
The institute, now in its second year of holding work
shops, tries to bring in diverse artists from California to help
students express themselves culturally and creatively in
unique ways, breaking free of classroom boundaries, said
coordinator Gina Hernandez.
Each art form has a different way of bringing out issues
of diversity and exposing ideas that are not often discussed,
according to participants.
Edgar Garcia, a senior, said that Ollin helped him real

ize his cultural heritage.
"I gained an appreciation of our culture," he said. "You
understand where you're coming from."
At the same time, while Ollin was written with Latino cul
ture in mind, it speaks of a diverse set of views. Valdez noted
that the play even includes an Indian dance that one of his
students choreographed.
"There were so many cultures in the class," Valdez said.
"Interpreting the history [with different viewpoints] was a
real bonding process."
Nakasako took a more passive approach to culture, al
lowing the diversity of Stanford to manifest itself in his stu
dents' films in whatever approach the students took.
Nakasako took his students to the Tenderloin neighbor
hood in San Francisco where he creates films with high
school dropouts. The focus of his course, however, was for
students to explore their own lives. He said that some of the
results surprised him.
"In Stanford or [the Tenderloin neighborhood], stu
dents have the same worries," he said. "The whole emo
tional part is the same."
Nakasako's workshop will present its films in Annenberg
Auditorium at 5:30 p.m. on Friday. Luna's personal narra
tives workshop students will perform at 7 p.m. the same day
in the Stanford Art Gallery. Admission is free.
