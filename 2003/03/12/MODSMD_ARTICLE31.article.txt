# War rally lacks student voices
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Noted anti-war activist and former Stanford stu
dent David Harris delivered the keynote address at
a Saturday rally in front of Palo Alto City Hall.
Though police estimated that up to 2,000 people
were present at the rally's peak, few Stanford stu
dents participated.
The march down University Avenue was led by
"Women in Black," a group that protests violence of
all kinds, in honor of International Women's Day.
Behind them came protesters of all ages holding
signs declaring, among other things, "War is terror
ism," and "Under Bush's rule we'll all be fossil fuel."
The groups chanted, "No war, no way," as they
marched along the street, stopping downtown traffic.
Organizers estimated that the protest was as large
as the previous one in Palo Alto on Feb. 1, which drew
around 4,000 people.
"I think this rally demonstrates the diversity of the
movement," said Jim Birch, a Palo Alto City Council
members who sponsored a resolution against war
with Iraq. "This is not just the radical fringe."
"We are here to save our country," he said. "It is
our obligation to speak our voice to power."
He continued, "We find it improbable that this ad
ministration, having failed to bring democracy to
Florida, thinks it can bring it to Iraq.
"We are not an arrogant people . . . .We do not be
lieve America is God's gift to the rest of the world."
Among the other speakers was Stanford sophomore
Matt Otuteye of the Stanford Spoken Word Collective.
He noted that there were not many students in at
tendance.
"I feel that it is a failing on the part of students," he
said. "It's part of their role to be informed. Doing this is
part of being informed."
Senior Calvin Miaw, co-coordinator of the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice, said SCPJ didn't re
ally organize much; "We want people to still have en
ergy for an action in the next couple of weeks."
Organizers and participants at the event noted
that while a rally such as this was nothing like the
large, coordinated rallies throughout the world on
Feb. 15, smaller movements like this make a differ
ence.
"It's important for the local community to come
together and act together locally," said Paul George,
director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center
and organizer of the event. "This is a small piece of
what's going on. People are out every weekend
demonstrating their opposition."

Members of the crowd reflected diversity in oppos
ing war on Iraq.
Janet Hale of Palo Alto wore a plastic cape that said
"Raging Grannies Homeland Security Shield," and
went on stage with about 10 other grandmothers to sing
against war.
"The children of the world are ours," Hale said.
"[The singing] is a release for us. We hope to convince
people that war is horrible."
Harlow Williams, a Vietnam veteran, set up a
booth and spoke along with other "Veterans for
Peace." Williams said he demonstrates for peace be
cause the government lied to him about the nature of
the war when he was in the military.
"This is premeditated murder, pre-emptive destruc
tion of a country that cannot protect itself," he said.
Williams noted that while he hoped the protest
would make a difference, that was not the only reason
he was demonstrating.
"I'm going to do it because it's the right thing to
do," he said.
Though many demonstrators felt that war is immi
nent, none were giving up hope of averting war.
"I think there is still a slim chance [of stopping
war]," George said. "There is so much opposition
from the people of this planet. The American govern
ment has never faced this kind of opposition."

whom were not from Stanford, marched to the Palo Alto
City Hall to catch the attention of officials.
