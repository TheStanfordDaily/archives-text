## Tahirih Justice Center founder speaks on National Women's Day

Activist Layli Miller-Muro
spoke Satin clay night about inter
national women's rights and the
role of non-profits in spreading
gender equality in a talk com
memorating National Women's
Day at the Women's Community
Center.
Miller-Muro, founder of the
Tahirih Justice Center, which
provides free legal services to
women seeking asylum from per
secution, emphasized the role of
legal and nonprofit communities
in spreading gender equality, as
well as the need for student in
volvement.
Miller-Muro first became in
volved in international women's
rights when she encountered fe
male genital mutilation during a
trip to Ghana. A law student at the
time, she wrote a paper exploring
whether victims of mutilation
could merit refugee status in the
United States.
Disappointed to find that the
legal definition of a refugee didn't
include women escaping gender
based persecution, she took up
the cause.
Soon after, she was handed the
case of Fauziya Kassindja, a 17-
year-old girl from Togo who fled
to the United States to avoid fe
male circumcision and a polyga
mous marriage. Kassindja was in
carcerated upon her arrival in
the United States for not having a
legal passport.
Miller-Muro argued Fauziya's
case, discovering that mutilation
was a particularly sticky issue be
cause it doesn't fall under the ac
cepted definition of persecution.
"Persecution is defined as
punishing someone fora particu

lar quality," Miller-Muro said.
"Female genital mutilation is in
flicted on young girls by mothers
who love them and think it's in
their best interest, so the law has
a problem with that."
Kassindja was denied asylum
in her original trial, Miller-Muro
said, not only because she wasn't
technically a refugee, but also be
cause the judge didn't believe the
atrocities she had described.
"Although it was unfortunate,
the judge's behavior was so egre
gious and prejudiced that it drew
media attention and benefited us
by raising awareness," Miller-
Muro said.
Following an article about
Kassindja in The New York
Times, her legal team received
support of politicians and celebri
ties ranging from then-First Lady
Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) to direc
tor Steven Spielberg. Eventually,
they won the case on appeal and
Kassindja was granted sanctuary.
After the case's conclusion,
Miller-Muro received calls from
women in similar situations seek
ing asylum from a wide range of
abuse.
Unable to help them personal
ly, she tried to find others who
could. It was when she discov
ered the scarcity of agencies capa
ble of helping these women that
she got the idea for the non-prof
it Tahirih Justice Center.
"Women throughout the world
are raising up to reject their op
pression in many different soci
eties, cultures and in many differ
ent ways," Miller-Muro said. "The
way they do this manifests itself
differently depending on the
woman, her culture and the par
ticular time in history."
Humanity is in its adolescence,
according to Miller-Muro, in that
people all over the world are
striving for independence, iden
tity, a sense of self and respect.
The United States especially per
ceives itself as invincible, she
added, and like an adolescent it

has the physical capacity of an
adult but lacks the emotional,
spiritual and intellectual capaci
ties to use its strength.
"An adolescent has the capaci
ty to give life and to take a life,"
she said. "Similarly, the world has
the ability to feed the entire plan
et if it wanted to, but it could also
annihilate the planet. One of the
things we have to do to reach
adulthood is achieve the equality
of men and women."
When it comes to resolving the
question of gender equality,
Miller-Muro recognized that
there are no absolute answers.
"We have to transform hearts,
behaviors, outlooks," she said.
"It's an individual process. It will
be necessarily painful, and it will
require us to examine our cul
tures, families, history and our
selves, both men and women."
According to Miller-Muro, soci
etal transformation will require
countries to provide institutions of
justice, which will actively protect
the equality of men and women.
Americans especially are too
dependent on laws and statutes,
she said. While they may be sym
bolic of achievement, they are
not truly representative of social
change, only the initiation of it,
she added, using the example of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which
legislated equality but failed to
eliminate racism and prejudice.
Miller-Muro emphasized that
the international climate for gen
der-based persecution will most
likely worsen before it improves,
due to tightened security measures
and Attorney General John
Ashcroft's efforts to further narrow
the criteria for refugee status which
could increasingly exclude women.
"We hit walls all the time,"
Miller-Muro said. "That's why
[Tahirihj exists. Walls of preju
dice, ignorance, apathy are why
we exist because they are all
around us and we have to break
them down to promote justice
and equality."
