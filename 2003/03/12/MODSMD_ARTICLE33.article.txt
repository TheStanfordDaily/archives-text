## Card claims Pac-10 title 
### NATHAN KURZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A little bit of defense and a lot of Nicole
Powell can do wonders for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
Just ask the rest of the Pac-10.
They sure got one too many doses of that
lethal combination this weekend in San Jose.
The No. 9 Cardinal (26-4) completed a

Women's Basketball
Saturday: No. 8 Stanford 60, California 35
Sunday: Stanford 69, UCLA 64
Monday: Stanford 59, No. 22 Arizona 49

three-game-in-three-day waltz through the
Pac-10 bracket and captured its first confer
ence tournament title with a 59-49 victory
over No. 22 Arizona (22-8).
Stanford had advanced to the champi
onship game with a hard-fought 69-64 victo
ry over UCLA Sunday afternoon and
opened the tournament with a 60-35 thrash
ing of California.
The X-factor in all three games?
You guessed it.
That good-humored, well-oiled Powell
standing 6-foot-2 — the Pac-10 conference
tournament MVP for the second consecutive
year. (Kelley Suminski was also named to the
All-Tournament team.)
The junior forward had 19 points, five as
sists and four rebounds last night to cap a
dominating weekend that had some extra in
centive for Powell.
She was unseated as Pac-10 Player of the
Year by Washington's Guiliana Mendiola
earlier in the week. But in the three games at
HP Pavilion, Powell played with a purpose
and left the rest of the conference scratching
their heads, wondering if they picked the
wrong woman for the award.
"Nicole is a great leader for them," Ari
zona coach Joan Bonvicini said. "She gives

her team a great deal of confidence."
The Cardinal's defensive effort played a
role in the title game victory, too.
A night earlier, Arizona shot a tourna
ment-record 53.6 percent from the field. But
Monday night was a different story altogeth
er as the Wildcats' 32.2 shooting percentage
from the field and 49 points were both their
second-worst performances in each category
this season. It was the 19th time the Cardinal
held an opponent below 40 percent from the
field.
The biggest "holding" the Cardinal ac
complished was on Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year Shawntinice Polk, who had a season
low five points.
"Tara said Polk told reporters she didn't
like to be fronted, so obviously we thought
'Oh thanks for telling us that. We're going to
front you'," sophomore Chelsea Trotter said.
"So we fronted and I think it worked."
Stanford led by as much as 20 in the first
half, but Arizona roared into the locker room
with an 11-2 run that cut the lead to 11 —the
Wildcats' largest halftime deficit of the sea
son.
That didn't deter the young Arizona team
from cutting even further into the Cardinal
lead early in the second half.
The Wildcats pulled within 43-39 with
14:09 remaining after Julie Brase knocked
down a 3-pointer.
Two key 3-pointers — one from sopho
more Sebnem Kimyacigolu on the next pos
session and another from sophomore T'Nae
Thiel four minutes later — kept Stanford
comfortably ahead as Arizona never pulled
within more than five the rest of the way.
The Cardinal now awaits word on its seed
ing in the upcoming NCAA tournament.

But that's not all.
Stanford also will be hosting the
West Region at Maples, raising
questions about whether the Car
dinal will not have to play a road
game before the Final Four in At
lanta.
This scenario seems almost as
sured after the Cardinal wrapped
up the conference title, but it won't
be official until the tournament se
lection show Sunday at 2 p.m. on
ESPN.
If it weren't for Powell, Stan
ford might not even have been in
this enviable position — or the
championship game for that mat
ter — in the first place.
Back on Sunday, the Cardinal
got itself in a heap of trouble
against the Bruins.
Stanford led by as much as 15
points, but saw its lead completely

evaporate in the second half as
UCLA's furious press took over
the game.
With two minutes remaining in
the game, the two teams were
deadlocked at 61 apiece, and Stan
ford had the ball out-of-bounds
with one second on the shot clock.
That's when Powell worked her
magic.
She caught an inbounds pass
from Suminski, turned and
heaved a 26-foot stand-still jumper
that somehow found the bottom of
the net — putting Stanford ahead
for good.
Then the Cardinal made 10-of
-12 free throws down the stretch to
seal the victory.
Saturday, Stanford was never
seriously challenged against the
Bears in a first-round matchup.
Defense was the difference-maker
for the Cardinal, which held Cali
fornia to 22.2 percent from the
field — a season low fora Stanford
opponent — and set a Pac-10
tournament record in allowing
only 35 points.

If it weren't for Powell, Stan

this enviable position — or the
championship game for that mat
ter — in the first place.
Back on Sunday, the Cardinal
got itself in a heap of trouble
against the Bruins.
Stanford led by as much as 15
points, but saw its lead completely

evaporate in the second half as
UCLA's furious press took over
the game.
With two minutes remaining in
the game, the two teams were
deadlocked at 61 apiece, and Stan
ford had the ball out-of-bounds
with one second on the shot clock.
That's when Powell worked her
magic.
She caught an inbounds pass
from Suminski, turned and
heaved a 26-foot stand-still jumper
that somehow found the bottom of
the net — putting Stanford ahead
for good.
Then the Cardinal made 10-of
-12 free throws down the stretch to
seal the victory.
Saturday, Stanford was never
seriously challenged against the
Bears in a first-round matchup.
Defense was the difference-maker
for the Cardinal, which held Cali
fornia to 22.2 percent from the
field — a season low fora Stanford
opponent — and set a Pac-10
tournament record in allowing
only 35 points.
A little bit of defense and a lot of Nicole
Powell can do wonders for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
Just ask the rest of the Pac-10.
They sure got one too many doses of that
lethal combination this weekend in San Jose.
The No. 9 Cardinal (26-4) completed a

three-game-in-three-day waltz through the
Pac-10 bracket and captured its first confer
ence tournament title with a 59-49 victory
over No. 22 Arizona (22-8).
Stanford had advanced to the champi
onship game with a hard-fought 69-64 victo
ry over UCLA Sunday afternoon and
opened the tournament with a 60-35 thrash
ing of California.
The X-factor in all three games?
You guessed it.
That good-humored, well-oiled Powell
standing 6-foot-2 — the Pac-10 conference
tournament MVP for the second consecutive
year. (Kelley Suminski was also named to the
All-Tournament team.)
The junior forward had 19 points, five as
sists and four rebounds last night to cap a
dominating weekend that had some extra in
centive for Powell.
She was unseated as Pac-10 Player of the
Year by Washington's Guiliana Mendiola
earlier in the week. But in the three games at
HP Pavilion, Powell played with a purpose
and left the rest of the conference scratching
their heads, wondering if they picked the
wrong woman for the award.
"Nicole is a great leader for them," Ari
zona coach Joan Bonvicini said. "She gives

her team a great deal of confidence."
The Cardinal's defensive effort played a
role in the title game victory, too.
A night earlier, Arizona shot a tourna
ment-record 53.6 percent from the field. But
Monday night was a different story altogeth
er as the Wildcats' 32.2 shooting percentage
from the field and 49 points were both their
second-worst performances in each category
this season. It was the 19th time the Cardinal
held an opponent below 40 percent from the
field.
The biggest "holding" the Cardinal ac
complished was on Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year Shawntinice Polk, who had a season
low five points.
"Tara said Polk told reporters she didn't
like to be fronted, so obviously we thought
'Oh thanks for telling us that. We're going to
front you'," sophomore Chelsea Trotter said.
"So we fronted and I think it worked."
Stanford led by as much as 20 in the first
half, but Arizona roared into the locker room
with an 11-2 run that cut the lead to 11 —the
Wildcats' largest halftime deficit of the sea
son.
That didn't deter the young Arizona team
from cutting even further into the Cardinal
lead early in the second half.
The Wildcats pulled within 43-39 with
14:09 remaining after Julie Brase knocked
down a 3-pointer.
Two key 3-pointers — one from sopho
more Sebnem Kimyacigolu on the next pos
session and another from sophomore T'Nae
Thiel four minutes later — kept Stanford
comfortably ahead as Arizona never pulled
within more than five the rest of the way.
