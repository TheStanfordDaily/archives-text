# Victory builds up confidence

"We have more to lose than to gain by the [Pacif
ic-10 Conference] Tournament," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer last week.
Until Stanford's victory over Arizona on Monday
to win the Pac-10 Tournament, VanDerveer's state
ment appeared to be pretty accurate. In the semi-fi
nals against UCLA, the Cardinal seemed compla
cent and uninspired. UCLA, desperate for its season
to continue, erased a 15-point second half deficit
with urgent full court pressure.
Stanford failed to match UCLA's intensity and
could very easily have lost the game had Nicole Pow
ell not hit a 3-pointer from nine feet behind line to
give the Cardinal a 64-61 advantage with just under
two minutes to go in the game.
The UCLA game did not bode well for Stanford's
chances in the NCAA tournament where intensity is
just as important as talent. The Cardinal, a team that
started the season as scrappy, over-achieving under
dogs while Powell sat out with a bulging disk,
seemed headed in the wrong direction.
At the beginning of the season VanDerveer com
mented, "Our team has established a culture of how
we play. This particular team really has been great to
work with. They are incredibly mature and un
selfish."
However, road losses to Southern California,
Washington and Arizona raised questions about the
Cardinal's toughness and place among the elite
teams in the country.
"We were embarrassed at Washington," Van-
Derveer said last week. "They played extremely well
and were motivated and hitting all kinds of shots.
The thing that was most disappointing is not just that
we didn't get the things done physically but that
there was a defeatist attitude. That has not been a
part of [this teamjat all, all year.
"We get into to trouble when things
get physical," VanDerveer added.
"That's what happened at Arizona."
The Pac-10 season is so long and
physically wearing that a road loss here
and there is to be expected, but at some
point a team has to start building some
momentum going into the NCAAs.

"I think playing aggressively for 40
minutes is a major issue," sophomore
T'Nae Thiel said after the Arizona road
trip. "The NCAA tournament is on our
minds. We want to make a statement [at
the Pac-10 tournament]. We have a lot to
prove to ourselves."
An impressive 59-49 victory over No.
24 Arizona on Monday night was just
what Stanford needed going into the
NCAA tournament: a tough, deter
mined win over a talented team.
The victory rectified much for the
Cardinal, including last year's loss to Ari

zona State in the finals of the conference
tournament.
For weeks now, VanDerveer has im
plored her team to play more physically
(a euphemism for aggressiveness).
On Monday night, Thiel and sopho
more Chelsea Trotter relentlessly bat
tled wide-load Shawntanice Polk for po
sition, holding the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year to live points on 2-6 shootingâ€”
her lowest output of the season.
Azella Perryman aggressively crashed
the boards all weekend, pulling down a
23 rebounds in three games.
