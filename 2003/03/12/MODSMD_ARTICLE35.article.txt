# Barnes' finale redeemed by team
## 
### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's game vs. California was
supposed to be senior Julius Barnes'
special day. Playing in his final game at
Maples Pavilion, Barnes barely man
aged to hold back the tears as he was
honored before tipoff.
However, while Barnes was able to
hit a huge 3-pointer in the closing min
utes to seal the game, giving fans a tiny
glimpse of the legacy he has estab

lished on the Farm. The senior guard's
3-for-11 shooting performance was
just one indication that he was hardly
the only Stanford hero in the 72-60
victory.
"I didn't play well. Justin didn't play
well," Barnes said with a laugh, poking
fun at redshirt junior Justin Davis' 1-8
mark from the field. "It wasn't a great
individual performance but you
couldn't ask more from this team
tonight. I have so much confidence in
our bench."

One player that was able to step up
and keep the Cardinal in the game was
junior redshirt Joe Kirchofer. Usually
a utility player that comes in to give the
starters some rest and buy Stanford a
few extra fouls, Kirchofer scored six
critical points midway through the sec
ond half to maintain the Cardinal lead.
The forward finished the day with
eight points, six rebounds and one
block in just 10 minutes for Stanford.
" Joe was amazing with those lit
tle one-hand putbacks," Barnes
said. "I have never seen that until
today. We always kid him about
his vertical, but he didn't really
need it."
Kirchofer added, "A lot of it
was being in the right place at the
right time." His second-half hero
ics were good fora place on the
ESPN Sportscenter highlight reel.
"The ball was just falling and they
weren't difficult to make."
Kirchofer wasn't the only play
er off the bench to make some crit
ical contributions for the Cardinal
â€” the freshman trio of Dan Grun
feld, Matt Haryasz and Jason
Haas were able to put up some
quality minutes for Stanford in
the first half.
Grunfeld scored five points in
five minutes, posting a pair of bas
kets to put the Cardinal up by 14
with 4:17 to play in the first half.
Haryasz then assumed control,
hitting a pair of free throws and a
jump shot to give Stanford its
biggest lead of the game with 1:40
in the first half.
"The bench was spectacular in
the first half,"coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Dan Grunfeld went
in and really competed. Haryasz
maple some good plays."
The unsung hero was arguably

Haas, forced to assume the point
guard duties after Barnes picked
up his second foul with 10:52 to
play in the first with the score
standing at a tight 16-14 in Stan
ford's favor.
Over the next 11 minutes,
Haas recorded four assists and
scored two points, leading the
Cardinal to an 11-point lead head
ing the break. While the freshman
doesn't have the scoring capabili
ties of Barnes, his poise under
pressure has been critical for Stan
lord in several big games this sea
son.
"Haas has kind of saved us
every time we have gotten in this
type of position," Montgomery
said.
At the end of the evening, Stan
ford saw offensive contributions
from 10 different players, with the
bench accounting for 24 of the
team's 72 points.
Stanford's bench performance
was especially critical considering
the emphasis it has placed on its
starters all year. While Mont
gomery was quick to point out
that the veterans were essential in
the Cal game, he mentioned that
the extra confidence in some of
the younger players was essential
going into the Pacific-10 Confer
ence tournament.
"This team is special," he said.
"They have a lot of confidence in
one another. There are not a lot of
mental games going on with who
is getting what shot."
