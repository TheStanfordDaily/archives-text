# Barnes' finale redeemed by team

### MAUREEN MULLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's game vs. California was
supposed to be senior Julius Barnes'
special day. Playing in his final game at
Maples Pavilion, Barnes barely man
aged to hold back the tears as he was
honored before tipoff.
However, while Barnes was able to
hit a huge 3-pointer in the closing min
utes to seal the game, giving fans a tiny
glimpse of the legacy he has estab

lished on the Farm. The senior guard's
3-for-11 shooting performance was
just one indication that he was hardly
the only Stanford hero in the 72-60
victory.
"I didn't play well. Justin didn't play
well," Barnes said with a laugh, poking
fun at redshirt junior Justin Davis' 1-8
mark from the field. "It wasn't a great
individual performance but you
couldn't ask more from this team
tonight. I have so much confidence in
our bench."

One player that was able to step up
and keep the Cardinal in the game was
junior redshirt Joe Kirchofer. Usually
a utility player that comes in to give the
starters some rest and buy Stanford a
few extra fouls, Kirchofer scored six
critical points midway through the sec
ond half to maintain the Cardinal lead.
The forward finished the day with
eight points, six rebounds and one
block in just 10 minutes for Stanford.
