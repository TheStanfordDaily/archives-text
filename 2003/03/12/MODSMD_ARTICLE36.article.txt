Saturday's game wasn't for the Pacific-10 Con
ference title, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't
emotional or meaningful.
Before a capacity crowd at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday night, the No. 15 Cardinal men celebrat
ed Senior Day with a 72-60 victory over No. 22 Cal
ifornia to clinch sole possession of second place in
the Pac-10.

The emotion showed early, as the usually stoic
Julius Barnes fought back tears during the pre
game ceremony honoring Stanford's seniors and
appeared slightly rattled on the court on what had
been billed as "his day" all week long.
"I got teary-eyed in the locker room," Barnes
admitted. "During the ceremony, I just tried to
keep my composure because I looked over at [fel
low senior Olatunde SobomehinJ and he was just
bawling, and I thought, 'Aw man, I can't look like
that.' I tried to keep my composure, but inside my
heart was racing, and it showed in my playing, but
other guys stepped it up."
The senior finished with eight points and three
assists but was nonetheless ecstatic about his team's
win.
"Not a great individual performance, but you
couldn't ask more of this team," said a grinning
Barnes. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think
we would finish in [second] place."
"Julius was a little too geeked up," explained
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "He was not
sure how to react emotionally to this whole senior
thing."
