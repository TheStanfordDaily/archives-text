# Card bench steals Senior Day spotlight
## Kirchofer, Haas add strong contributions as Stanford defeats rival California 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's game wasn't for the Pacific-10 Con
ference title, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't
emotional or meaningful.
Before a capacity crowd at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday night, the No. 15 Cardinal men celebrat
ed Senior Day with a 72-60 victory over No. 22 Cal
ifornia to clinch sole possession of second place in
the Pac-10.

The emotion showed early, as the usually stoic
Julius Barnes fought back tears during the pre
game ceremony honoring Stanford's seniors and
appeared slightly rattled on the court on what had
been billed as "his day" all week long.
"I got teary-eyed in the locker room," Barnes
admitted. "During the ceremony, I just tried to
keep my composure because I looked over at [fel
low senior Olatunde SobomehinJ and he was just
bawling, and I thought, 'Aw man, I can't look like
that.' I tried to keep my composure, but inside my
heart was racing, and it showed in my playing, but
other guys stepped it up."
The senior finished with eight points and three
assists but was nonetheless ecstatic about his team's
win.
"Not a great individual performance, but you
couldn't ask more of this team," said a grinning
Barnes. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think
we would finish in [second] place."
"Julius was a little too geeked up," explained
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "He was not
sure how to react emotionally to this whole senior
thing."

Sophomore forward Josh Childress soars towards the hoop over Cal de
fenders, contributing 15 of Stanford's 7 points to end the Cardinal's confer
ence season on a high note and snap a three-year Senior Night losing
streak.
Although Barnes was Stan
ford's only senior starter, it was the
Cardinal bench that exhibited the
most composure throughout the
game. And despite .seeing their
leader visibly caught up in the
emotion of the day, junior Joe Kir
chofer and freshmen Jason Haas,
Matt Haryasz and Dan Grunfeld
all had solid performances.
Kirchofer came off the bench to
score eight points, grab six re
bounds and shoot 4-for-4 from the
field, including two straight bas
kets late in the game to deter a Cal
run.
Haas stepped in after Barnes
picked up two quick fouls and
played significant minutes in the
first half. He hit a jump shot, man
aged to dish out four assists and
didn't have any turnovers, despite
tough defensive pressure from Cal
point guard A.J. Diggs.

"Jason Haas saved us again,"
Montgomery said. "Julius got
those two fouls and Haas went in
and built a lead for us."
With Haas in the lineup, Stan
ford quickly jumped out to a 14-
point lead when Grunfeld scored
five consecutive points — his first
field goal came on a put-back of a
Justin Davis miss, and a minute
later he was fouled while hitting an
8-foot jumper — to extend the
Cardinal's lead to 33-19 with four
minutes left to play in the first half.
The Golden Bears clawed their
way back, however, cutting an 18-
point deficit to 11 as a Rich Midge
ly 3-pointer capped a 7-0 Cal run
to end the half.
"We gave up a little bit of a lead
in the first half," Montgomery said.
"That was disappointing."
Despite the late run, Cal really
struggled to produce offensively in
the first half, shooting a dismal 29
percent from the field and 1 -for-8
from behind the arc. The Cardi
nal, on the other hand, came out
firing, shooting 44 percent from

the field and going 4-for-8 from 3-
point range.
Childress hit two of those 3-
pointers en route to his team-lead
ing 15 points and 10 boards. Ju
nior Matt Lottich hit the other two
first-half threes, which accounted
for six of his 14 points.
Golden Bear head coach Ben
Braun was reluctant to attribute
his team's poor shooting perfor
mance to Stanford's strong defen
sive effort.
"I think we were a little disap
pointed with our shot selection,"
Braun said.
In the second half, Cal chal
lenged early. Golden Bear senior
Joe Shipp scored and was fouled
on Cal's opening possession. He
hit the free throw, bringing his
team back within eight points.
After trading baskets for the next
10 minutes, Cal guard Brian
Wethers, who led all scorers with
16 points, hit his third 3-pointer of
the day to close the gap to 52-48.
But the four-point deficit was as
close as the Golden Bears got.

Stanford went on a 10-0 run in the
next four minutes, as Cal went cold
offensively.
The late second-half run al
lowed Montgomery to put in his
seniors, who played their last game
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday
evening. Both Sobomehin and
Tyler Bysecker got in with under a
minute to play and received a
standing ovation from the crowd,
though neither had the opportu
nity to score.
"I'm really proud of these kids,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That's the end of
the regular season — 30 games, 23
wins, second in the conference —
unbelievable. They just battled so
hard all year long, and tonight was
no different."
Stanford has not necessarily
seen the last of the Bears for the
season. If both teams win their re
spective first-round games on
Thursday evening, they will meet
again in the semi-finals in a game
that would decide the true victor of
the series.

game. And despite .seeing their
leader visibly caught up in the
emotion of the day, junior Joe Kir
chofer and freshmen Jason Haas,
Matt Haryasz and Dan Grunfeld
all had solid performances.
Kirchofer came off the bench to
score eight points, grab six re
bounds and shoot 4-for-4 from the
field, including two straight bas
kets late in the game to deter a Cal
run.
Haas stepped in after Barnes
picked up two quick fouls and
played significant minutes in the
first half. He hit a jump shot, man
aged to dish out four assists and
didn't have any turnovers, despite
tough defensive pressure from Cal
point guard A.J. Diggs.

"Jason Haas saved us again,"
Montgomery said. "Julius got
those two fouls and Haas went in
and built a lead for us."
With Haas in the lineup, Stan
ford quickly jumped out to a 14-
point lead when Grunfeld scored
five consecutive points — his first
field goal came on a put-back of a
Justin Davis miss, and a minute
later he was fouled while hitting an
8-foot jumper — to extend the
Cardinal's lead to 33-19 with four
minutes left to play in the first half.
The Golden Bears clawed their
way back, however, cutting an 18-
point deficit to 11 as a Rich Midge
ly 3-pointer capped a 7-0 Cal run
to end the half.
"We gave up a little bit of a lead
in the first half," Montgomery said.
"That was disappointing."
Despite the late run, Cal really
struggled to produce offensively in
the first half, shooting a dismal 29
percent from the field and 1 -for-8
from behind the arc. The Cardi
nal, on the other hand, came out
firing, shooting 44 percent from

the field and going 4-for-8 from 3-
point range.
Childress hit two of those 3-
pointers en route to his team-lead
ing 15 points and 10 boards. Ju
nior Matt Lottich hit the other two
first-half threes, which accounted
for six of his 14 points.
Golden Bear head coach Ben
Braun was reluctant to attribute
his team's poor shooting perfor
mance to Stanford's strong defen
sive effort.
"I think we were a little disap
pointed with our shot selection,"
Braun said.
In the second half, Cal chal
lenged early. Golden Bear senior
Joe Shipp scored and was fouled
on Cal's opening possession. He
hit the free throw, bringing his
team back within eight points.
After trading baskets for the next
10 minutes, Cal guard Brian
Wethers, who led all scorers with
16 points, hit his third 3-pointer of
the day to close the gap to 52-48.
But the four-point deficit was as
close as the Golden Bears got.

Stanford went on a 10-0 run in the
next four minutes, as Cal went cold
offensively.
The late second-half run al
lowed Montgomery to put in his
seniors, who played their last game
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday
evening. Both Sobomehin and
Tyler Bysecker got in with under a
minute to play and received a
standing ovation from the crowd,
though neither had the opportu
nity to score.
"I'm really proud of these kids,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "That's the end of
the regular season — 30 games, 23
wins, second in the conference —
unbelievable. They just battled so
hard all year long, and tonight was
no different."
Stanford has not necessarily
seen the last of the Bears for the
season. If both teams win their re
spective first-round games on
Thursday evening, they will meet
again in the semi-finals in a game
that would decide the true victor of
the series.
Saturday's game wasn't for the Pacific-10 Con
ference title, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't
emotional or meaningful.
Before a capacity crowd at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday night, the No. 15 Cardinal men celebrat
ed Senior Day with a 72-60 victory over No. 22 Cal
ifornia to clinch sole possession of second place in
the Pac-10.

Thursday: No. 17 Stanford 72, No. 22 Cal 60

The emotion showed early, as the usually stoic
Julius Barnes fought back tears during the pre
game ceremony honoring Stanford's seniors and
appeared slightly rattled on the court on what had
been billed as "his day" all week long.
"I got teary-eyed in the locker room," Barnes
admitted. "During the ceremony, I just tried to
keep my composure because I looked over at [fel
low senior Olatunde SobomehinJ and he was just
bawling, and I thought, 'Aw man, I can't look like
that.' I tried to keep my composure, but inside my
heart was racing, and it showed in my playing, but
other guys stepped it up."
The senior finished with eight points and three
assists but was nonetheless ecstatic about his team's
win.
"Not a great individual performance, but you
couldn't ask more of this team," said a grinning
Barnes. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think
we would finish in [second] place."
"Julius was a little too geeked up," explained
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "He was not
sure how to react emotionally to this whole senior
thing."

Sophomore forward Josh Childress soars towards the hoop over Cal de
fenders, contributing 15 of Stanford's 7 points to end the Cardinal's confer
ence season on a high note and snap a three-year Senior Night losing
streak.
