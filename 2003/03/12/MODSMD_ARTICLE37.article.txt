# Men blast rivals out of water

### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford men's swimming team
(8-0) took the early lead at the Pacific-10
Championships last weekend in Long Beach
and never relented.
After three days of competition, Stanford
came away with three relay victories, three in
dividual wins, three new Fac-10 records and its
22nd-straight Pac-10 team title.
Though both No. 3 California and No. 8
Southern California recorded more individ
ual wins than Stanford, the Cardinal's depth in
every event gave it the crucial edge as Stanford
finished the weekend 148.5 points ahead of
second-place Cal.
"We did everything that we wanted to do
this weekend," coach Skip Kenney said. "VVe
swam really well, we won and we got as many
guys qualified as we could for the NCAA meet.
We have a great group ready to go out there
and shoot for the national championship."
Stanford captured one title on the first day
of competition, as the 400-yard medley relay
team of juniors Peter Marshall and Michael
Bruce and seniors Dan Westcott and Randall
Bal swam an impressive 3:08.74 for the win
and the Pac-10 record.
Other top Cardinal performers included
junior Matt Sorlien, who took second in the
500 free behind USC's distance phenom Erik
Vendt. Junior Markus Rogan took second in
the 200 individual medley with a time of
1:45.87, and in a nail-biting finish in the 50
free, Bal placed third behind Cal's Anthony
Ervin and Mike Cavic.
Friday began with the 200 medley relay,

which saw Marshall, Bruce, Westcott and Bal
team up once again to set lire the Cardinal vic
tory. Stanford powered past Cal in 1:25.63 for
the win and another Pac-10 meet record.
The Cardinal captured one individual win
on Friday to extend its 12-point lead, and sev
eral swimmers finished in the top eight of each
event. In the 400 individual medley, USC's
Vendt swam to his second victor)' of the meet,
clocking in at 3:42.70, a new Pac-10 record.
Rogan finished fourth, followed by Sorlien in
fifth, sophomore Dan Trupin in seventh and
freshman Thomas Brown in eighth.
Westcott's fourth place in the 100 butterfly
was the event's top finish for Stanford. Sopho
mores Matt McDonald and Jayme Cramer
were on his heels at fifth and sixth , respective
ly, with less than .2 seconds separating the
three Stanford swimmers.
In the 200 freestyle, Cal secured its second
win of the day as Joe Bruckart outswam Stan
ford senior John Waters for the win. Waters'
second-place time of 1:36.04 automatically
qualified him for the NCAA championships
later this month.
Bruce, last year's top finisher in both breast
stroke events, was upset in the 100 by USC's
Mihaly Flasky. Bal completed a four-year
sweep in the 100 backstroke with his first-place
finish in 46.58. Westcott and Marshall took
second and third, respectively, as Stanford
owned the top three spots of the event.
On the final day of competition, the Cardi
nal swam away with two more individual titles.
Stanford completed a second 1 -2-3 backstroke
sweep in the 200. Westcott took the top spot in

The top-ranked Stanford men's swimming program won the Pac-10 title by 148.5 points, drench
ing Cal and USC to claim its 22nd consecutive conference title.
-1:40.71, just. 12 seconds short of the
l'ac-10 record set in 1977 by
Olympic gold medalist Lenny
Krayzelburg. Rogan and Marshall
placed second and third, with all
three athletes collecting NCAA
qualifying times.
"Dan [Westcott] came so close to
an American record in the 200
back," Kenney said. "Only six

Americans have swam under 1:41
in that event, and he joins a pretty
elite group. Five of those swimmers
were from Stanford."
Bruce defended his title in the
200 breaststroke, claiming the win
with record-setting styleâ€” his time
of 1:55.70 shattered the previous
I'ac-10 meet record by nearly a sec
ond. Stanford then took second to
Cal in the 400 free relay to seal the
conference championship.
The Cardinal swimming and
diving team heads to Austin, Texas
March 27-29 for the NCAA ( ham

last year's narrow loss to Texas. Hut
the Longhorns are ready to light
bark, having won their 24th consec
utive Big 12 conference champi
onship two weeks ago.
"We just have to rest now," Ken
ney said. "We have done every
thing that we can to prepare for this
meet, and the hard work is behind
lis. The guys have to stay off their
legs and mentally prepare. We are
right where we want to he, and now
it's just a matter of going into the
meet with some light in lis."
