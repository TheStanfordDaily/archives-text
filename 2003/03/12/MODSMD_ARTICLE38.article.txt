### ARISHA HATCH EDITORIAL STAFF 
Only minutes after No. 15
Stanford (23-7, 14-4 Pacific-10
Conference) defeated No. 22 Cal
ifornia on Saturday to claim the
second seed in the Pac-10 Confer
ence Tournament, Cardinal for
ward Justin Davis was confronted
with the grim reality of the situa
tion.
Stanford's reward for the de
feat over the Golden Bears?
An opening round matchup
against Southern California to be
held at the Pac-10 proclaimed
"neutral" site of Staples Center lo
cated in Los Angeles.
"Aww shucks," said Davis upon
receipt of the pairings.
Translation: Not the Trojans
again.
In the first round of last year's

Pac-10 tournament, the Trojans
(11-16, 6-12) cruised to a demor
alizing 103-78 victory over Stan
ford in front of a Trojan-friendly
crowd, as the Staples Center isjust
a few miles from the USC campus.
The Cardinal hopes that histo
ry won't repeat itself. Though
USC has a home-court advantage,
this year's Trojan squad is a far
cry from 2002's team that chal
lenged for the conference title.
Stanford swept the Trojans in
Pac-10 play, including a 73-67
win at USC on Feb. 20.
"I'm looking forward to play
ing them again personally," said
sophomore center Rob Little.
"They beat us three times last year
and I want to beat them three
times this year."
Tipoff for Thursday's first
round matchup is set for 6:40
p.m.
