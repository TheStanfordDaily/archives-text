# Rugby gains a home but loses its coach
## 
### 
It took four years, countless
hours of practice, many
hard-fbuglit victories, sev
eral tough-to-swallow de
feats, the tireless efforts of a
coach, the unbelievable generosi
ty of the alumni and $2 million.
But after all of that, I finally got to
realize the simple joy of having a
locker to put my equipment in â€”
and I never would have believed
what a difference it would make.

On Saturday
afternoon, the
brand-new
Steuber Rugby
Stadium and
the Doyle Fami
ly Rugby Club
house were offi
cially dedicated.
The state of the

art facility is a shining jewel, posi
tioned just north of Maloney Soc
cer Field and directly west of the
softball stadium. The 762-fan ca
pacity facility overlooks the only
rugby field in the country that
conforms to international stan
dards.
When viewed in juxtaposition
to the intramural field that had
served as the rugby home field
previously, the new field's ex
pertly manicured turf and preci
sion-painted lines give the im
pression of an oasis flowing forth
in the midst of an unkempt and
uneven terrain that is more suit
ed for overflow Big Game park
ing than for premier athletic
competition.
Four years. When I say it took
four years, 1 recognize fully that
I'm looking at the situation only
from my limited point of view.
Rugby has been a tradition at
Stanford since 1906. And ever
since being stripped of varsity sta
tus in the '70s, the club and its
alumni have been fighting for the

privileges and respect that are af
forded the varsity sports.
Anyone who has had the priv
ilege of taking the pitch (that's
what we call the field in rugby. It
took me several months to realize
this) in a Stanford uniform in the
last decade and a half has had the
honor of being coached by
Franck Boivert. His undying pas
sion for the game, wealth of
rugby knowledge, and genuine
love and respect for all of his play
ers have been the foundation
upon which the club has defined
itself.
And for all of us players, to see
the way his grin extended from
ear to ear as he toured the facility
for which he was largely respon
sible, reminded us of what all the
bumps and bruises, the weights
and the windsprints and the in
tense practices were for. So when
we walk out onto the field on
gameday, this great man can
walk into this beautiful new lock
er room, smile proudly at his
players and in his French accent
say the words that have special
meaning for those who know
him closely: "And we play!"
The large crowd that came out
to enjoy the rugby festivities was
not disappointed by the perfor
mance of their Cardinal teams on
Saturday. The women's team,
continuing their dominating per
formance this season, won con
vincingly against UC Davis 49-5
to keep their unbeaten league
record intact.
In a hard-fought contest, the
Stanford men's team kept their
playoff hopes alive by beating the
Aggies 23-13. Broko Baez's two
tries and Jose Guevara's two
penalty kicks proved to be more
than enough for the Cardinal,
