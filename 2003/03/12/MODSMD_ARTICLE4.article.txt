# Strike leaders face Univ. investigation

### WILL OREMUS ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Office of Judicial Affairs is inves
tigating six student organizers of last
Wednesday's "Books Not Bombs" anti
war strike in the Main Quad for possible
violations of the campus disruption poli
cy and the Fundamental Standard.
Spokespeople for the Coalition of Stu
dents Against the War said that six orga
nizers had received e-mails from the of
fice notifying them of the investigation,
the results of which will determine
whether formal charges are filed. If the
students are charged, they will undergo
a hearing before the Judicial Panel.

The day before the strike, the Univer
sity informed C-SAW members via e
mail that conducting unscheduled pro
grams or using amplified sound in the
Main Quad constituted a violation of
campus policy. A group of organizers
from the coalition then met with admin
istrators to discuss the planned strike
events.
"They came to us with concerns about
our event, and we addressed them," said
senior Calvin Miaw of C-SAW. "We gave
them our schedule, and we made
changes in terms of noise level and the
kinds of actions. To the best of our abili
ty, we cooperated."
Though University officials could not
confirm that students were being investi

gated, Assoc. I)ean of Students Morris
Graves said strike organizers were told at
the meeting that they could face discipli
nary action.
"The students were informed that
rhey would be in violation of University
policy on both counts — the use of the
Main Quad as well as the disruption pol
icy — and they were informed that there
could be possible consequences," Graves
said.
Added Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe, "Clearly [the strike] violat
ed the campus disruption policy, and it
disturbed classes and other activities in
the Quad. It included an unscheduled
event, and it included amplified
sound."
Asked whether C-SAW leaders
might have thought that the ad
ministration had granted them
tacit permission to use the Quad,
Graves said, "I can't tell you exact
ly what they were thinking.
"I can tell you that we met with
the leadership . . . and told them
there could be consequences, but
we were not in a position to know
what the consequences would or
could be."
Junior Leticia Ramirez said

that rally organizers had hoped
to allay some of the administra
tors' concerns by giving them
contact information for C-SAW
members in case the noise be
came too disruptive.
According to Ramirez, organiz
ers were in "constant communica
tion with the administration the
whole day."
The fact that Judicial Affairs is
investigating the students does not
necessarily mean that University
officials objected to the strikers'
conduct Howe said that Judicial
Affairs opens an investigation
whenever it receives a formal com
plaint from any member of the
Stanford community.
"[A complaint] could be filed by

a faculty member whose classes
were disrupted, it could be filed by
students whose classes were dis
rupted, or it could be filed by an
administrator," Graves said.
Howe noted that the University
and the Office of Student Activities
had received several calls about the
strike from individual students
who felt it was disruptive.
While both Howe and Graves
said that they felt the strike was
generally well-organized, Howe
said, "The fact that an aspect of the
event went well doesn't preclude
an organizer or an organization
from being responsible for viola
tions."
Members of C-SAW argued
that it was unfair for the Universi

ty to force six people to shoulder
all the responsibility for the strike.
"We feel that the administration
has arbitrarily singled out six indi
viduals, when it was in fact a much,
much larger group of students
who were involved in making the
student strike happen," Miaw said.
While Howe declined to com
ment about the specifics of the
case, citing her responsibility to
maintain confidentiality, she said
that in such cases the University
focuses on the event's primary
organizers.
"Each case is individual," she
said. "Typically it's the heads of the
organization, the people in
charge, but each case has its own
nuances."
