The Office of Judicial Affairs is inves
tigating six student organizers of last
Wednesday's "Books Not Bombs" anti
war strike in the Main Quad for possible
violations of the campus disruption poli

Spokespeople for the Coalition of Stu

students are charged, they will undergo
a hearing before the Judicial Panel.

grams or using amplified sound in the
Main Quad constituted a violation of

events.
"They came to us with concerns about
our event, and we addressed them," said
senior Calvin Miaw of C-SAW. "We gave
them our schedule, and we made
changes in terms of noise level and the
kinds of actions. To the best of our abili

Though University officials could not
confirm that students were being investi

Graves said strike organizers were told at
the meeting that they could face discipli

"The students were informed that

policy on both counts — the use of the
Main Quad as well as the disruption pol
icy — and they were informed that there
could be possible consequences," Graves
said.
