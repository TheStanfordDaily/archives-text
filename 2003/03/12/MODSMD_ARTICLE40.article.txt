SAN JOSE — Alter seven straight weeks of grueling

But it was the Spartans (8-8) who appeared to be tak
ing a breather as the Cardinal won the matchup
197.200-193.225, with freshman Glyn Sweets garner
ing the all-around title for the first time in her collegiate
career.
"This was the first time Kendall Beck and Lindsay
Wing performed in the all-around this year and it was re
ally exciting to see those two and Glyn hit <dl four events,"
coach Kristen Smyth said. "That shows the depth that we
have tight now and the fact that we are still building,
adding skills, and getting better every weekend."
Stanford began the night on the uneven bars, on
which Sweets tied her career-high mark 0f9.925 to win
the event. Foley and junior Caroline Fluhrer tied for
third at 9.875 as the Cardinal took the lead after the first
rotation and never looked back.
Stanford has been catapulting past the competition
on the vaulting table this season, and Friday was no ex
ception. For the third week in a row, the Cardinal broke
its all-time best team score on the event, chalking up a
49.500 on the apparatus. The record-setting marks
didn't stop there —junior Ail-American Kendall Beck
notched a perfect 10, the first-ever on vault in Stanford
history.
"Kendall's 10.0 vault was definitely the highlight of
the meet," Leveille said. "[Junior Shelly Goldberg] also
did a gorgeous vault, which she has worked so hard to
upgrade and now it's finally paying off."
Sweets and Goldberg tied for second with 9.9005,
and the Cardinal's superb vaulting set captured each of
the top five places in the event.
Another bright spot on the table was junior Lindsay
Wing's exhibition on vault. Wing performed on all four
events in 2001 and 2002 for Stanford, earning All-
America honors in the all-around her freshman year.
But Friday's matchup was her debut on the new vault
for 2003.
"1 was really excited about competing in all four
events at San Jose," Wing said. "We have started work
ing on a new vault that is different from the one that I
have competed in the past, so hopefully the change will
allow me to be more consistent and be able to contribute

another 10 vault to the team as the postseason ap
proaches"
The fl(X)r exercise provided the Spartans' best effort
as San Jose's Dani Albright look first with a 9.925. But
Wing was on her heels with a 9.875 to capture second.
Sophomore Mandy Delgado's upgraded tumbling
earned her a 9.850 and a tie for third place with fresh
man Jessica Louie.
Wing also paced Stanford on the balance beam, tak
ing the title with a 9.950. She has won the event in Stan
ford's last seven meets and is currently ranked second
nationally on the apparatus.
"It was difficult to have to stand on the sidelines, but
the team was so strong against SJSU that it was very en-

joyable to watch," Leveille said. "I
think this meet was a big step in the
right direction as wc prepare for the
postseason."
After finals end, the Cardinal will
host Oklahoma — the last home
meet for seniors Alissa Cooper,
Kelsey Stillinger, and Abby Gair —
before heading to the Pac-10
Championships at UCLA.

"We had key performances from
key players in San Jose," Smyth said.

more depth on that event. I thought

make the final push in our training
cycle."
