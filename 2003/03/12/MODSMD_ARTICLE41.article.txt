### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
It was a long weekend for the
Golden Bears.
Twelve California pitchers were
battered this weekend fora total of
31 runs over the course of the
three-game series against the No.
7 Stanford baseball team (14-7) at
Sunken Diamond.

Baseball
Friday: No. 7 Stanford 11, California 2
Saturday: Stanford 9, California 4
Sunday: Stanford 11, California 2

The Cardinal pitchers shut
down their opposition, while the
Cal hurlers were obviously unable
to do the same. Stanford was
swinging the bats with the most
consistency it has had all season,
never going more than one inning
without a run in what was its

strongest series of its season thus
far.
The Cardinal's Friday starter,
junior John Iludgins, recorded
nine strikeouts and eight scoreless
innings for the win and the com
plete game — his first of the season
and fourth of his career. Cal's only
runs came from a two-run homer
by Chris Grossman in the second
inning.
Freshman John Mayberry led
the Cardinal's offense, going four
for-five with three RBIs and blast
ing his fifth triple of the season. Ju
niors Brian Hall and Sam Fuld also
had multi-hit games en route to a
final score of 11-2.
Saturday's game provided a bit
more suspense.
While Cal starter Brian Montal
bo gave up just five hits in almost
six innings, the Cardinal made
them count, producing seven runs
to hand Montalbo the loss.

Meanwhile, senior Ryan Mc-
Cally held the Cal offense at bay,
allowing three runs in five and
two-thirds innings and leaving the
game with a 5-3 lead.
Junior reliever David O'Hagan
loaded the bases in the seventh,
prompting coach Mark Marquess
to bring in freshman Matt Manship.
Manship walked his first batter on
four straight pitches, bringing the
score to 7-4 with bases still loaded.
The Bears were one big swing
away from the lead, but their
threat was short-lived. Manship
quickly found the strike zone,
striking out Jeff Dragicevich and
cleanly fielding a grounder from
the next batter to end the inning.
Freshman Kodiak Quick fol
lowed Manship and threw a flaw
less two innings, striking out four
without allowing a single hit, to

eliminate any momentum the
Bears may have had.
Sophomore Danny Putnam, se
nior Ryan Garko and Fuld each
had two RBIs as the Cardinal took
game two of the series, 9-4.
On Sunday Stanford was look
ing for its first series sweep since
taking three straight over Fresno
State last month, and it seemed in
evitable from the early innings that
Cal would indeed drop three in a
row.
A four-run third inning pro
pelled the Cardinal to a 5-0 lead
behind the arm of freshman Mark
Romanczuk, who earned his fifth
win of the season. Romanczuk
threw six complete innings, strik
ing out seven while giving up two
runs.
O'Hagan took over in the sev
enth, and his second outing of the
weekend proved much more effec
tive than the first. O'l lagan gave up
just one hit and no walks in three in
nings while striking out three.
On top of Stanford's solid per
formances on the mound, the Car
dinal hitters looked like they were
taking batting practice.

Eleven Stanford batters record
ed a hit, and seven had more than
one successful at-bat. Mayberry
extended his hitting streak to 14
games and junior Carlos Quentin
chalked up his first home run of
the season .
"I almost forgot how great of a
feeling it was," Quentin said. "I
don't remember ever going this
long without hitting a home run
but the main thing is that we won
the game and were able to sweep."
The sweep is especially signifi
cant for the Cardinal as it heads
into Pacific-10 Conference play
(the series with Cal and the previ
ous series against (JSC do not
count toward the Pac-10 stand
ings).
Hopefully Stanford will he able
to maintain its momentum, as the
team takes a 12-day break for fi
nals before Pac-10 play begins.
"This was obviously a good
weekend for us to sweep a quality
team like California," said Mar
quess. "We've got a tough draw
opening the Pac-10 schedule at
Arizona State. But, we played
teams on the road like Texas and
Cal-State Fullerton in our presea
son schedule to prepare us for Pac
-10 games like this. I'm pleased
with winning four straight series
heading into the break."

weekend at Sunken Diamond. Stanford's bats pummeled 12 Cal pitchers to put together 31 runs for the three wins.
eliminate any momentum the
Bears may have had.
Sophomore Danny Putnam, se
nior Ryan Garko and Fuld each
had two RBIs as the Cardinal took
game two of the series, 9-4.
On Sunday Stanford was look
ing for its first series sweep since
taking three straight over Fresno
State last month, and it seemed in
evitable from the early innings that
Cal would indeed drop three in a
row.
A four-run third inning pro
pelled the Cardinal to a 5-0 lead
behind the arm of freshman Mark
Romanczuk, who earned his fifth
win of the season. Romanczuk
threw six complete innings, strik
ing out seven while giving up two
runs.
O'Hagan took over in the sev
enth, and his second outing of the
weekend proved much more effec
tive than the first. O'l lagan gave up
just one hit and no walks in three in
nings while striking out three.
On top of Stanford's solid per
formances on the mound, the Car
dinal hitters looked like they were
taking batting practice.

Eleven Stanford batters record
ed a hit, and seven had more than
one successful at-bat. Mayberry
extended his hitting streak to 14
games and junior Carlos Quentin
chalked up his first home run of
the season .
"I almost forgot how great of a
feeling it was," Quentin said. "I
don't remember ever going this
long without hitting a home run
but the main thing is that we won
the game and were able to sweep."
The sweep is especially signifi
cant for the Cardinal as it heads
into Pacific-10 Conference play
(the series with Cal and the previ
ous series against (JSC do not
count toward the Pac-10 stand
ings).
Hopefully Stanford will he able
to maintain its momentum, as the
team takes a 12-day break for fi
nals before Pac-10 play begins.
"This was obviously a good
weekend for us to sweep a quality
team like California," said Mar
quess. "We've got a tough draw
opening the Pac-10 schedule at
Arizona State. But, we played
teams on the road like Texas and
Cal-State Fullerton in our presea
son schedule to prepare us for Pac
-10 games like this. I'm pleased
with winning four straight series
heading into the break."
