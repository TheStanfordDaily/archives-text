The Cardinal pitchers shut
down their opposition, while the
Cal hurlers were obviously unable
to do the same. Stanford was
swinging the bats with the most
consistency it has had all season,
never going more than one inning
without a run in what was its

strongest series of its season thus
far.
The Cardinal's Friday starter,
junior John Iludgins, recorded
nine strikeouts and eight scoreless
innings for the win and the com
plete game â€” his first of the season
and fourth of his career. Cal's only
runs came from a two-run homer
by Chris Grossman in the second
inning.
Freshman John Mayberry led
the Cardinal's offense, going four
for-five with three RBIs and blast
ing his fifth triple of the season. Ju
niors Brian Hall and Sam Fuld also
had multi-hit games en route to a
final score of 11-2.
Saturday's game provided a bit
more suspense.
While Cal starter Brian Montal
bo gave up just five hits in almost
six innings, the Cardinal made
them count, producing seven runs
to hand Montalbo the loss.

Meanwhile, senior Ryan Mc-
Cally held the Cal offense at bay,
allowing three runs in five and
two-thirds innings and leaving the
game with a 5-3 lead.
Junior reliever David O'Hagan
loaded the bases in the seventh,
prompting coach Mark Marquess
to bring in freshman Matt Manship.
Manship walked his first batter on
four straight pitches, bringing the
score to 7-4 with bases still loaded.
The Bears were one big swing
away from the lead, but their
threat was short-lived. Manship
quickly found the strike zone,
striking out Jeff Dragicevich and
cleanly fielding a grounder from
the next batter to end the inning.
Freshman Kodiak Quick fol
lowed Manship and threw a flaw
less two innings, striking out four
without allowing a single hit, to
