# Synchro hopes to swim away with a title
## 
### DEREK ALLEY 
March is a time for madness. A time
when sports fans roll up their sleeves
and begin to eat, sleep, and drink col
lege basketball. But this March, Josh
Childress and Julius Barnes will not be
the only centers of attention for the
Stanford community. Because with
March comes the madness of Stanford
synchronized swimming's battle for the
national title.
In lieu of dunks and 3-pointers, the
ladies of Stanford synchro are prepared
to dazzle the crowds with finesse and
perfection. And with the stellar season
now behind them, they have been doing
just that. But the time of trial has come.
From March 20 to 22, all of the syn
chronized swimming teams in the coun
try will converge on Tucson to battle for
the gold of Collegiate Nationals. In the
University of Arizona Recreation Cen
ter Pool, synchro swimmers will be
putting on their best smiles and forma

tions to impress the judges and win over
the crowds. But even though all teams
make it to the competition, most are
there for show. The three top con
tenders for the national title are Stan
ford, University of .Alabama-Birming
ham, and defending champion Ohio
State. Stanford's hopes are high, and the
strength of this year's team promises vic
tory. This season Stanford has already
defeated the University of Alabama-
Birmingham twice, and although they
have not yet competed with Ohio State,
they are very confident about their
chances.
"Our matchup with Ohio State
should be a really great competition,"
said team captain and senior Stephanie
Joukoff. "Both of our teams are ex
tremely competitive, and although we
haven't seen them in competition yet
this season, we are ready."
The Collegiate Nationals schedule is
three days of jam-packed performance.
On Wednesday, March 19, thecompeti

tion begins with the showing of the team
squads. Thursday starts early for the
teams with the solo matches starting off
the day. Duel and trio matches are also
slotted for Thursday. On Friday, the
teams come back to the water for their
semi-finals and the compulsory compe
titions take place. The final battles for
solo, duet, trio and team are on Satur
day.
Stanford will enter multiple teams in
many of the competitions. For trios, se
nior Stephanie Joukoff, junior Jennifer
Kibler and freshman Ashley Mchugh
will form one of the squads. The other
will include senior Ashley Ensign,
sophomore Sheila Sadovnik and fresh
man Cassidy Ramage. Stanford will also
enter two duet teams. Joukoff and Ki
bler make the first team, while Sadovnik
and Ramage form the other with junior
Joanne Taylor as an alternate. .Ashley
