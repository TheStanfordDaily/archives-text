### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The regular season is over, and the No. 12
Stanford men's gymnastics team (5-4) has already
faced half of the nation's top 10 teams.
The Cardinal just finished its toughest week
end of the season, squaring off on the road against
top-ranked Oklahoma and No. 3 Ohio State on
Friday and No. 14 Air Force Academy on Sunday.
The two former squads defeated Stanford, but
the Cardinal easily outclassed Air Force.
As part of the team's post-season strategy,
coach Thom Glielmi scheduled the team's tough
est workouts this week. The wear-and-tear of the
intense training week was evident as the team fin
ished third against Oklahoma and Ohio State.
"1 expected them to struggle physically on Fri
day," Glielmi said. "They got some rest traveling

on Saturday, so Sunday was a little better."
The squad easily defeated the Falcons for the
second time this season on Sunday,'improving al
most three points in less than 48 hours to garner
a season-best team score of 213.745.
The Cardinal was unable to do much damage
to Oklahoma, who scored an NCAA-record
222.5. In fact, the Sooners and Ohio State rosters
currently boast 18 top-10 ranked gymnasts.
ITie highlight of the meet for Stanford was senior
Marshall Erwin's performance on the rings. The de
fending NCAA champion scored a 9.75, eking out a
.05 victory over Oklahoma's Brett Covey, who cur
rently holds the nation's No. 1 ranking on rings.

With another event title in Colorado, Erwin has a
pei"lett record on die apparatus this season.
The Cardinal dominated the Air Force, win
ning every event, all-around and team tide. Ju
nior Dan Gill, who struggled against Oklahoma,
won floor, vault and high-bar en route to a 54.475
all-around title.
Glielmi said he saw many great individual per
formances this weekend.
"There were some definite high points," Gliel
mi said. "Paul [O'Leary] on parallel bars, Daniel
[Torres-Ran gel] on rings, Kelly [l-ang] on high
bar. I'm seeing these great routines, and now we
need to put them together at the same time.
That's the goal lor NCAAs."
Stanford will take a two-week break from com
petition until the MPSF Championships, which

will provide preparation for the
NCAA Championships next month.
Despite not being very deep, the
Cardinal should have little problem
qualifying for the NCAA Champi
onships and the team will use much
of this time to perfect the routines
that they've been competing all sea
son long.
"There will still be some upgrad
ing," Clielmi said. "But we pretty
much know what routines the guys
want to do and what routines I want
them to do."
