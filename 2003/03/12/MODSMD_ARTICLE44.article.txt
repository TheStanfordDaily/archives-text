# Card avoids sweep with win
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In two home non-conference matches,
the No. 10 men's volleyball team (11-10,
8-7 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
demonstrated its depth in the process of
earning its fifth-consecutive weekend
split.
The team was swept by No. 5 Lewis
(14-2, 6-0 Midwest Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association) on Friday night, but
defeated Friday (7-11, 2-9 MIVA) in
four games on Saturday.

Men's Volleyball
Friday: Lewis def. No. 10 Stanford 30-22, 30-
28,30-26
Saturday: Stanford def. Friday 30-27, 28-30,
30-21,30-28

Friday's match saw sloppy defensive
play from the Cardinal. The team allowed
Lewis a .542 hitting percentage.
"[Lewis] played pretty well, and they
got help from us," coach Don Shaw said.
"I just think we didn't do a very good job
in a lot of areas. Defensively we were prac
tically non-existent.
"They had a lot to do with [our play].
is a very, very good team."
Stanford was unable to slow down the
Flyers' top player, junior opposite hitter
Fabiano Barreto. The second-team Ail-
American racked up a match-high 23 kills
on a .531 hitting percentage and chipped
in five digs.
Senior opposite hitter Will Curtis
stood out for the Cardinal with 15 kills
and three digs.

On Saturday night, Stanford
showed an alternative starting lineup,
with sophomore Pat Bomhack starting
in place of sophomore Kevin Hansen
at setter and sophomore Chris Sand
man starting for sophomore Craig
Buell at middle blocker. Both Buell
and Hansen later contributed off the
bench.
"I give Friday a lot of credit," Shaw
said. "They're kind of unorthodox. They
do some different things, timing-wise.
They out-blocked us and out-dug us.
Physically, they're not that imposing, but
they're a feisty team, and they made us
earn the win."
The Oilers out-blocked Stanford 10-7
and out-clug the team 37-32, yet it was ev
ident throughout die match that the Car
dinal was in control.
"We set out tonight and we had a few
goals for ourselves, aside from win
ning," Shaw said. "We wanted to do
some things. We wanted to sideout well
and we did that for the most part, ex
cept for game two, and that's the game
we lost."
As usual, Stanford saw very solid indi
vidual play from senior middle blockers
Paul B(x:age and Billy Strickland, who
recorded 14 and 15 kills, respectively, but
it was the serving of Bocage that caught
the eye of Shaw.
"Paul had a great serving weekend,"
said Shaw. "He served really well [Friday]
night too, but [Saturday] he was unbeliev
able. That was a good indication that
maybe he's going to get some more confi
dence and be able to come in and get
some aces for us on his serve."
