# Women hope to end season with a splash

### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
There is a time when the mistakes and ac
complishments of yesterday fade away and all
attention turns to the present and the potential
for new triumphs.
That time comes for the No. 7 Stanford
women's swimming and diving team March 20
to 22 at the NCAA Championships in Auburn,
Ala.
Auburn University's James E. Martin Aquat
ics Center will be a temporary home to at least
eight Cardinal swimmers.
"This team is made up of some extremely
competitive girls who know how to race when it
counts," said junior Tara Kirk, one of the team's
captains. "I think that everyone on the team is
looking forward to competing with some great
swimmers from other teams."
Without a doubt, many of the most talented
athletes Stanford will face will be from defend
ing national champion and host No. 1 Auburn.
However, there are a number of other teams
that have shown the talent and depth to come
out on top at NCAAs, including No. 3 Georgia,
No. 2 Florida and Stanford coach Richard
Quick's alma mater, No. 5 Southern Methodist
University.
However, the Cardinal arrives with a very
impressive lineup of swimmers. Four of the
eight are veterans of the NCAA championships:
Kirk, and sophomores Lacey Boutwell, Amy
Wagner and Sarah Jones.
At the 2002 NCAA competition, Boutwell,
Kirk and Wagner all became two-time Ameri
can record holders in the 400-yard medley relay
and the 200 medley relay.
Kirk added two individual American records
to that list at the championships in her sweep of
the two breaststroke events.
"My goal for the meet is to swim best times,"
Kirk said. "In the breaststrokes, that means set
ting some new American records. I also want to
score as many points as possible for my team.
That means winning and placing high."

Jones, an All-American, swam a leg of the 200
freestyle relay, helping the team to clinch sev
enth place in the event.
The four newcomers to the NCAAs include
junior Megan Baumgartner and freshmen
Dana Kirk, Kristen Caverly and Ashley Daly.
Baumgartner, a sprint free swimmer, quali
fied for the championships in the 400 free relay
last week, a race which teammate Tara Kirk
called "inspirational" — Baumgartner an
chored the race when Dana Kirk had to with
draw with a sudden illness. Daly will join Baum
gartner in the 400 free relay in Auburn.
Dana Kirk is a qualifier in her specialty but
terfly events, races in which she has improved
every meet. Caverly, who specializes in the indi
vidual medley relays, will get another chance to
overtake defending IM champion Maggie
Bowen. The two finished in a dead heat in their
first meeting.
"I have confidence in the ability and talent of
the people we are bringing to NCAAs, so natu
rally I expect a lot out of our team," the elder
Kirk said. "We do have a lot of obstacles to over
come, but I think that we are ready to perform."
The divers still have one more obstacle to
overcome before setting their minds on the

NCAA Championships—NCAA Zone meets.
They must perform well at this competition next
weekend in Oklahoma City to qualify for the
championships.
"We are all rested and feeling strong from the
taper [in training], so I believe we are as ready as
we will ever be," said senior McKenze Murphy,
a three-time Ail-American. "Nothing is ever
guaranteed in sports, so I aim to just focus on
each dive one by one and let the outcome take
care of itself."
Murphy expressed faith in the abilities of her
teammates to dive well in Zone competition, es
pecially in sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal, who
had an excellent meet at the Pac-10 Champi
onships last weekend.
She also is impressed with two of her fresh
man teammates, Michaela Skloven and Sara
Bowling, both of whom Murphy said have an
amazing ability to perform under pressure,
which will be a key to their chances at Zones.
For Murphy, knowing that this is her last year
of NCAA competitions gives her even more
drive.
"I hope we all savor our time together as a
team and dive our best for ourselves and for
Stanford," she said
