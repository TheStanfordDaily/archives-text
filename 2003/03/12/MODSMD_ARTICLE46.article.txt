## Men and women prepare to finish 2003 ahead of the pack 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's No. 4 women and
No. 7 men's track and field squads
will head to the NCAA Indoor Na
tional Championships this week
end at the University of Arkansas.
Considered contenders for the
team championship, the women
will look to improve on last year's
fifth-place finish. The men hope to
return to the award stand after a
disappointing 35th-place finish in
2002.
On the women's side, Stanford
currently has the fastest distance
medley relay in the nation at 11
minutes 5.16 seconds. It will be
challenged by UCLA, anchored by
standout Lena Nilsson, and North
Carolina, anchored by NCAA
Cross Country Champion, Sha
lane Flanagan.
"I think that we have a great
chance of finishing higher than last
year and the possibility of being in
the mix of things for the title if
everything comes together," said
freshman Alicia Craig.
Stanford is expected to run se
nior Malindi Elmore, junior Katie
Hotchkiss and sophomore Chris
tine Moschella for three of the legs.
Senior Lauren Fleshman will run
either the DMR or the 5,000. If she
enters the 5,000, sophomore Jeane
Goff will join the DMR team.
In the 5,000, 14 women hit the
automatic standard, including
freshman Craig and Fleshman,
who have the fifth- and sixth
fastest times in the nation. They
will challenge Sara Gorton of Col

orado and the O'Neill twins of Yale
for the championship.

ready defeated UCLA's Jessica
Crosby, the defending champion
in the event, but will be challenged
by UNC freshman Laura Ger
raughty, who secured the top
throw in the nation by over a foot.
Elmore is also expected to com
pete in the mile, looking to im
prove on her fourth-place finish in
the event last year. Freshman Jakki
Bailey earned a berth in the 60-
meter dash with her qualifying
time of 7.35 seconds, currently
14th in the nation.
The women's team champi
onship looks to be tight battle with
Louisiana State as the slight fa
vorite. and a number of schools

within reach of the crown.
Although the men seemed in
danger of sending a small dis
tance squad to nationals for the
first time in years, the Cardinal
stepped up and recorded three
automatic times for the champi
onships at last weekend's Last
Chance Qualifier.
Junior Grant Robison posted a
3:58.95 in the mile, good enough
for fourth on Stanford's all-time
list and seventh in the nation. He
will enter one of the deepest mile
fields ever that includes 12 athletes
who have posted a sub-4:00 time
this season.
The 3,000 is no less competitive
as 10 runners hit the auto time and
16 ran sub-8:00, including Robi
son and juniors Louis Luchini and
Seth Hejny. Arkansas's Alistair
Cragg broke the collegiate record
in the event at the Boston Indoor
Classic and will attempt to lead the

Razorbacks to their 17th title in 20
years.
Luchini wishes to continue his
successful indoor campaign with a
run at the 5,000-meter title. He
currently ranks sixth at the dis
tance and will be joined by fresh
man Neil Davis, sophomore lan
Dobson and junior Adam Ten
forde in the race.
This race looks to be a battle be
tween perrenial powerhouses
Arkansas and Stanford as five
Hogs and four Cardinal athletes
comprise the 18 automatically
qualified athletes in the event.
Stanford ranks second in the
DMR, coming into the champi
onships behind Eastern Michigan.
All the squads are eyeing the world
record of 9:28.83 held by Stan
ford's 2000 team that included
Olympians Gabe Jennings and
Michael Stember.
Senior Nick Welihozkiy secured

his seat on the plane to Arkansas
with his provisional toss in the
weight throw of 68 feet, 7.25 inch
es last weekend, currently ranking
tenth.
Arkansas is the heavy favorite
for the team title behind their stel
lar distance squad. The fast
emerging men of South Carolina,
led by three-time 800-meter cham
pion Otukile Lekote and a stable of
incredible 400 runners, are still a
distance second.
But upsets happen and stars
emerge, and that is why the cham
pionship races are run.
"A lot of things would have to go
right for our women to win a title,"
coach Vin Lananna said. "It is pos

Stanford will send 16 men and women to the 2003 NCAA Indoor Champi
onships. The men hope to improve on last year's 35th-place performance,
while the women have their eyes on the prize, having placed fifth in 2002.
enters with the fourth best throw
in the nation. Camarena has al
ready defeated UCLA's Jessica
Crosby, the defending champion
in the event, but will be challenged
by UNC freshman Laura Ger
raughty, who secured the top
throw in the nation by over a foot.
Elmore is also expected to com
pete in the mile, looking to im
prove on her fourth-place finish in
the event last year. Freshman Jakki
Bailey earned a berth in the 60-
meter dash with her qualifying
time of 7.35 seconds, currently
14th in the nation.
The women's team champi
onship looks to be tight battle with
Louisiana State as the slight fa
vorite. and a number of schools

within reach of the crown.
Although the men seemed in
danger of sending a small dis
tance squad to nationals for the
first time in years, the Cardinal
stepped up and recorded three
automatic times for the champi
onships at last weekend's Last
Chance Qualifier.
Junior Grant Robison posted a
3:58.95 in the mile, good enough
for fourth on Stanford's all-time
list and seventh in the nation. He
will enter one of the deepest mile
fields ever that includes 12 athletes
who have posted a sub-4:00 time
this season.
The 3,000 is no less competitive
as 10 runners hit the auto time and
16 ran sub-8:00, including Robi
son and juniors Louis Luchini and
Seth Hejny. Arkansas's Alistair
Cragg broke the collegiate record
in the event at the Boston Indoor
Classic and will attempt to lead the

Razorbacks to their 17th title in 20
years.
Luchini wishes to continue his
successful indoor campaign with a
run at the 5,000-meter title. He
currently ranks sixth at the dis
tance and will be joined by fresh
man Neil Davis, sophomore lan
Dobson and junior Adam Ten
forde in the race.
This race looks to be a battle be
tween perrenial powerhouses
Arkansas and Stanford as five
Hogs and four Cardinal athletes
comprise the 18 automatically
qualified athletes in the event.
Stanford ranks second in the
DMR, coming into the champi
onships behind Eastern Michigan.
All the squads are eyeing the world
record of 9:28.83 held by Stan
ford's 2000 team that included
Olympians Gabe Jennings and
Michael Stember.
Senior Nick Welihozkiy secured

his seat on the plane to Arkansas
with his provisional toss in the
weight throw of 68 feet, 7.25 inch
es last weekend, currently ranking
tenth.
Arkansas is the heavy favorite
for the team title behind their stel
lar distance squad. The fast
emerging men of South Carolina,
led by three-time 800-meter cham
pion Otukile Lekote and a stable of
incredible 400 runners, are still a
distance second.
But upsets happen and stars
emerge, and that is why the cham
pionship races are run.
"A lot of things would have to go
right for our women to win a title,"
coach Vin Lananna said. "It is pos
sible, but there are a lot of talented
squads. The men's squad also
looks to be in good shape heading
into the championship portion of
the season and hope to improve on
last year's showing."
Stanford's No. 4 women and
No. 7 men's track and field squads
will head to the NCAA Indoor Na
tional Championships this week
end at the University of Arkansas.
Considered contenders for the
team championship, the women
will look to improve on last year's
fifth-place finish. The men hope to
return to the award stand after a
disappointing 35th-place finish in
2002.
On the women's side, Stanford
currently has the fastest distance
medley relay in the nation at 11
minutes 5.16 seconds. It will be
challenged by UCLA, anchored by
standout Lena Nilsson, and North
Carolina, anchored by NCAA
Cross Country Champion, Sha
lane Flanagan.
"I think that we have a great
chance of finishing higher than last
year and the possibility of being in
the mix of things for the title if
everything comes together," said
freshman Alicia Craig.
Stanford is expected to run se
nior Malindi Elmore, junior Katie
Hotchkiss and sophomore Chris
tine Moschella for three of the legs.
Senior Lauren Fleshman will run
either the DMR or the 5,000. If she
enters the 5,000, sophomore Jeane
Goff will join the DMR team.
In the 5,000, 14 women hit the
automatic standard, including
freshman Craig and Fleshman,
who have the fifth- and sixth
fastest times in the nation. They
will challenge Sara Gorton of Col

orado and the O'Neill twins of Yale
for the championship.
The 3,000 saw an amazing 19
women hit the auto standard. Nor
mally, only about 14 to 16 athletes
qualify in each event, but all 19 will
be guaranteed tickets to Arkansas,
including Fleshman, Craig and El
more.
Fleshman will try to defend her

national title in the 3,000, but will
be pushed hard by her teammates
and UNC's Flanagan, whose blaz
ing 9:00.22 early in the season es
tablished her as the favorite for the
title.
