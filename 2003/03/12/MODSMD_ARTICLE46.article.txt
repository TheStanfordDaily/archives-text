## Men and women prepare to finish 2003 ahead of the pack 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's No. 4 women and
No. 7 men's track and field squads
will head to the NCAA Indoor Na
tional Championships this week
end at the University of Arkansas.
Considered contenders for the
team championship, the women
will look to improve on last year's
fifth-place finish. The men hope to
return to the award stand after a
disappointing 35th-place finish in
2002.
On the women's side, Stanford
currently has the fastest distance
medley relay in the nation at 11
minutes 5.16 seconds. It will be
challenged by UCLA, anchored by
standout Lena Nilsson, and North
Carolina, anchored by NCAA
Cross Country Champion, Sha
lane Flanagan.
"I think that we have a great
chance of finishing higher than last
year and the possibility of being in
the mix of things for the title if
everything comes together," said
freshman Alicia Craig.
Stanford is expected to run se
nior Malindi Elmore, junior Katie
Hotchkiss and sophomore Chris
tine Moschella for three of the legs.
Senior Lauren Fleshman will run
either the DMR or the 5,000. If she
enters the 5,000, sophomore Jeane
Goff will join the DMR team.
In the 5,000, 14 women hit the
automatic standard, including
freshman Craig and Fleshman,
who have the fifth- and sixth
fastest times in the nation. They
will challenge Sara Gorton of Col

orado and the O'Neill twins of Yale
for the championship.
The 3,000 saw an amazing 19
women hit the auto standard. Nor
mally, only about 14 to 16 athletes
qualify in each event, but all 19 will
be guaranteed tickets to Arkansas,
including Fleshman, Craig and El
more.
Fleshman will try to defend her

national title in the 3,000, but will
be pushed hard by her teammates
and UNC's Flanagan, whose blaz

title.
