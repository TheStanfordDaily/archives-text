The Arizona State and Arizona women's ten
nis teams brought sunny weather and still com
petition to the Taube Family Tennis Center last
Friday and Saturday. They left, however, as the
latest victims of Stanford's domination.
The No. 3 Cardinal (10-1, 3-0 Pacific-10

Conference) defeated the No. 7 Sun Devils, in
resounding fashion on Friday. The Sun Devils
(6-2, 1-1) could not muster a single win in all
eight matches, falling 7-0 at the Farm.
I he rout began somewhat unexpectedly
during doubles play. Although Stanford fea

a thorn in the Cardinal's doubles side.
This was not the case on Friday, though, as
Barnikow and Burdette rebounded from a
doubles loss to William 8c Mary with an 8-6 vic
tory over Lauren Colalillo and Adria Kngel,
ranked No. 54 in the country.
"Yesterday the doubles point was most im
portant because we haven't won the doubles
point against them in a very long time," sopho
more Story Tweedie-Yates said.
Stanford swept the rest of the doubles match
es and followed suit in singles, with freshman
Amber Liu, Barnikow, Burdette, and freshman
Alice Barnes all turning in straight-set victories.
Junior Emilia Anderson and Tweedie-Yates fin
ished the thrashing with three-set wins.
More of the same impressive play was seen
on Saturday against Arizona (4-4, 0-4). Stan
ford again swept the doubles and then pro
ceeded to take four of the first five singles
matches.
A very strong performance was contributed
by Liu, who overcame hard-hitting Wildcat
Maja Mlakar in a three set battle, 6-7, 7-5, 1-0.
"Mlakar played very well today — we've
played her before, and she has the ability to put
the ball away from anywhere on the court, so it's
pretty challenging," Stanford coach Lele
Forood said. "But Amber was able to keep it to
gether in that second set, keep it close and then
finally pull ahead at the end."
Stanford's play against the Arizona schools
highlights both the depth and overall skill of the
squad, as well as the improvement that the
young team has made throughout the season.
"Overall, 1 think we're improving," Forood
said. "With two new teams [Barnes-Liu at No. 2
and Anderson-Tweedie- Yates at No. 3] it's just
an upward climb to learning about the team
work involved and what each other's shots are
like. So as far as coming along, we're making
good progress."
This weekend's wins place the Cardinal atop
the Pac-10 entering a two-and-a-half week
break from action. Stanford will next take on

Junior Lauren Bamikow aided Stanford's effort as the women's tennis team won its seventh and eighth
consecutive matches this season, with Arizona and ASU falling victim to the Cardinal rackets.
on March 25.
"I think it puts us in a really
confident position for the rest of

the Pac-10 season because we've
been so dominant over the past
few matches," Tweedie-Yates
said. "It feels good to go into the
break with these wins because it
would have been bad to go in
knowing we have to work on
something."
