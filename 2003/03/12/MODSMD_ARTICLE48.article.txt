Over the course of a softball sea
son that can reach as many as 70
games, there will be some opportu
nities for revenge. No. 12 Stanford
softball (21-7) got a measure of re
venge against two familiar foes on
its way to a runner-up finish at the
Speedline Invitational in Plant
City, Fla.
The Cardinal won its first seven
games of the tournament before
falling to unranked Oklahoma
State (17-6) in Sunday afternoon's

championship game.
Stanford opened tournament
play on Thursday with wins over
Coastal Carolina (11-3) and West
ern Michigan (9-8).
Senior second baseman Kira
Ching provided the offensive
spark against the Lady Chanti
cleers, while freshman pitcher
Laura Severson picked up the
win. Ching opened the scoring
with an RBI single in the first in
ning and picked up three more
RBI with a bases-clearing double
in the second.
Thursday's second game was a

far more competitive affair for the
Cardinal.
Stanford entered the top of the
sixth down 5-4 to Western Michi
gan. Freshman shortstop Lauren
Lappin initiated the game-tying
rally with a leadoff walk. Lappin
then stole second and advanced to
third on a groundout. Ching drove
her home with a single to knot the
game at five.
Stanford untied the game in
extra innings with three runs in the
top of the eighth. Freshman center
fielder Catalina Morris provided
the offense with a two RBI single.
Stanford needed extra frames
again in its first contest on Friday, a
nine-inning 1-0 victory over host
No. 21 South Florida (24-7).
Senior pitcher Dana Sorensen
turned in another masterful per
formance for the Cardinal, pitch
ing all nine innings while allowing
just one hit.
Stanford, held to just three hits,
had offensive woes of its own but
took control in extra innings, load
ing the bases in both the eighth and
ninth. Sophomore Katherine
Hoffman scored the winning run
in the bottom of the ninth on a sin

I hc Cardinal took a break from
dramatic finishes in Friday's sec
ond game. Stanford picked up a 7-
3 victory over Long Island Univer
sity of Brooklyn (4-8).
Senior'Fori Nyberg earned her
eighth win of the season with the
complete game victory, junior Jes
sica Allister's two-run homer in the

for the Blackbirds.

around some defensive miscues as

play with a 7-(i victory over Illinois
(11-3).
