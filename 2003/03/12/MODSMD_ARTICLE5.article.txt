# Physics prof joins board to investigate Columbia crash
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Nobel Prize-winning Physics Prof. Dou
glas Osheroff was appointed last week to the
board investigating the crash of the space
shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1.
He is one of three new members, all ap
pointed from outside the NASA establish
ment, who were added to the Columbia
Accident Investigation Board to assure its
independence.
Stanford alumna and astronaut Sally Ride
was also among the three recently appointed
members, and she and Osheroff will join 12
other distinguished investigators on the
board, which hopes to come to a definitive

conclusion in the next few months about the
cause of the disaster.
"I am honored that they think I have the
knowledge and skills they need," Osherofl said.
OsherofF noted in an e-mail interview
with The Daily that, though he was not a
space expert, his knowledge in other areas
could be useful.
"I certainly have no special expertise re
garding the shuttle," he said. "However, I
am an accomplished experimental physicist.
I also have special expertise in low-tempera
ture physics, which may well be useful in ef
forts to understand why the foam insulation
keeps falling off the external fuel lank dur-
ing launch."
Osheroffadded, "I hope that the
bulk of the investigation will be
completed in about three months.
This investigation is on a fast track,
and the nation would like some an
swers before the astronauts in the
International Space Station must
be brought back to Earth."
Osheroff was appointed to
the board after retired Adm.
Harold Gehman, chairman of
the board, appealed to NASA
administrators for more inde

pendent members.
Other professors noted that Os
heroff will add a unique indepen
dence to the board.
"He will help them come to as
reasonable a judgment as he can,"
said Stanford Aeronautics and As
tronautics Prof. Emeritus I iolt Ash
ley. "He has no axes to grind."
Ashley said that bringing in in
dependent, intelligent individu
als was more important than ap
pointing those with specialized
expertise.
OsherofFs appointment is remi
niscent of Nobel laureate physicist
Richard Feynman's appointment
to the board investigating the Chal
lenger explosion.
