board investigating the crash of the space
shuttle Columbia on Feb. 1.
He is one of three new members, all ap

could be useful.
"I certainly have no special expertise re
garding the shuttle," he said. "However, I
am an accomplished experimental physicist.
I also have special expertise in low-tempera
ture physics, which may well be useful in ef
forts to understand why the foam insulation
