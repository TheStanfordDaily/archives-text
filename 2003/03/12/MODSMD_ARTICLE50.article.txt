# Bruins could waltz in Dance

### 
£ £ —"yrefeet — Firefeet —
a Firefeet!" was the call I
heard on the last day of my
JL. week-long basketball camp
as a nervous 10-year-old. I immediately
dropped down to my defensive stance
(the theme of the camp) and got on my
toes as quickly as possible.
The length of my white Saucony high
tops prevented me from shifting my weight

as fast as 1 wished, but I
kept at it in a futile attempt
to fulfill my mom's
prophecy that I was the
next basketball prodigy.
In the gym with me
were 200 third-graders
hopping on each foot as
if the iloor was on fire in
an effort to show our in-

dividual achievements to our parents, val
idating the $100 they had shelled out for
a glorified babysitting camp.
But the real reason for my attendance
wasn't to prove my worth — I hope I was
smart enough then to realize that a 4-foot
-3 white kid with ill-fitting Saucony high
tops wasn't going far in basketball. The
real reason for my attendance — the ulti
mate purpose — was to get a free basket
ball that all campers got on the last day. Its
allure was not about the colors — green
purple — it was all about the name on the
ball. The name invoked the pride of
Marin County, the kid that took the last
local high school team to a state title, the
kid that is now the coach of UCLA.
I wanted a basketball signed by Steve
Lavin.
Which is exactly why it pains me to see
UCLA bellyflop this season. Not only did
the team have potential, but it had my
boyhood basketball hero at the helm.
UCLA has gone 6-18 this year, barely
making the No. 8 slot in the Pac-10. Lavin,
even with his hair slicked back with motor
oil, is most likely out of Westwood at the
end of this season.
Actually, that's not entirely accurate —
there is one last hope for the Bruins: The
Pac-10 tournament.
Three games separate Lavin from
keeping his job at UCLA and the gutter.

Imagine if, after this abysmal season, the
Bruins miraculously pull off three huge
upsets and land an automatic bid into the
Big Dance, win against two decent oppo
nents while riding the coattails of their Pac
-10 victory and make it to the Sweet 16.
Imagine how exciting, how ridiculous
and how miraculous that would be.
And isn't that why we have the postsea
son? I'll surely tell my kids and grandkids
how 1 watched the 49ers down 38-14 to a
much better NY Giants football team,
slowly work their way to a sit-down-and
cry-your-eyes-out victory.
So go tell your grandkids that you sat in
the Staples Center after driving down to
L.A. before finals to watch the greatest
multi-tournament run in NCAA history.
Tell them about how a UCLA team that
got abused all season long found it within
themselves to dig deep clown and pull out
three gritty victories over heavily favored
basketball powerhouses.
That's what playofls are all about. At
this point, it's not about who is the better
team, or who deserves what spot. It's
about who can win when they need to.
So don't give me the argument that it's
just lor money, that good teams have noth
ing to play for, or the RPIs of the top teams
take an undeserved hit. Don't hit me with
the fatigue angle either, or that an NCAA
tournament team could get an injury.
Suck it up, buttercup.
You don't win a title without playing
tough games. You don't get to win a
championship without going through
playoffs. You have to be able to win when
you have to.
Even though the theme of my camp
was the defensive stance, even though I
"lost" those Saucony hightops a long time
ago, and even though that 4-foot-3 white
kid is now a 6-foot-1 white kid, I still re
member Steve Lavin.
I remember his fire, his desire, and his
intensity. But most of all, I'm sure he re
members how to win.

Soplwmore Spencer Porter loves the Pac-10
tournament because he hopes that Arizona falls
faster than a (insert clever joke here). Send him
