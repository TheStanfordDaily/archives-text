# UCLA & Lavin deserve to be wallflowers
## 
### 
I generally don't believe in conspira
cies. There was no second gunman
on the grassy knoll, and the truth is
not out there. But sometimes, the
evidence is just too overwhelming to sug
gest anything but a massive secret plot to
undermine the prevailing social order.
1 present to you the Pac-10 basketball
tournament. It is the biggest conspiracy
that has gone uninvestigated since the sin
ister plot to make Jared of Subway a na
tional celebrity.
Point of evidence no. 1: Steve Lavin
still has a job.
With UCLA's come-from-behind win
against Washington last week, the Bruins
qualified for the Pac-10 tournament and
solidified their coach's position for at least
another game. Now Lavin has the chance
to prove that he is the best clutch coach of
all time (and let me just define clutch in this
sense to mean best at winning the game in
which his job revolves around the out
come) if lie can lead his eighth-seeded Bru
ins past top-ranked Arizona in the first
round, past Arizona State or Oregon in the
second and finish it up with a victory over
Stanford or (lal in the championship.
While this scenario is unlikely to play
out, such a disaster could send lowly 9-18
UCLA into the Big Dance with the Pac
l()'s automatic bid, and possibly push a
more deserving team like the 20-9 Ducks
packing for the NIT. And worse, it could
swing just enough votes in favor of retain
ing the master of hair gel's job for yet an
other disappointing season in Westwood.
But I don't care how hot a team gets in

early March — a team
that would have had
trouble winning a forfeit
for the majority of the
season should not have a
chance at qualifying for
the NCAA tournament.
Point of evidence no.
2: The Ivy League sucks.
The introduction of

the Pac-10 tournament is clearly a con
spiracy spearheaded by Arizona State and
Oregon State to ensure that sports com
mentators would not mention the Ivy
League and the Pac-10 in the same breath
when discussing the two conferences that
do not sponsor conference tournaments.
Sun Devil and Beaver alumni were fed
up with constantly being compared with
the likes of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale
grads, so they decided to remove them
selves and the rest of their conference
from said distinction.
Point of evidence no. 3: Tickets ain't
free, you know.
Somebody's raking in boatloads of
cash from ticket sales and television deals
for the tournament. And I seriously doubt
it's the players who are forced to miss a
crucial period of their school schedules in
order to travel to Los Angeles and play up
to three more grueling games. Well, un
less you play at UCLA (wait, that's not fair.
Nobody with connections to Jim Harrick
would ever give players money. I take
back that comment).
Point of evidence no. 4: What does this
tournament prove?

The tournament was introduced just
as the conference reached a never-before
seen level of parity. Other than hopeless
Oregon State, Washington, and Wash
ington State, who are about as much of an
impediment to the resi of the Pac-10 field
as the U.N. is to United States war plans,
the conference has been more balanced in
the past two years than in any period in
recent memory.
So why make the teams beat up on
each other for another week? A poor first
round showing by Oregon may very well
place them on the dark side of the NCAA
tournament bubble, thus hurting the Pac
l()'s representation in the Big Dance. And
I pity the poor Pac-10 conference official
who has to bear the brunt of Lute Olsen's
ire if his marquee player, Luke Walton,
reaggravates the injury that kept him out
of several games earlier in the season.
Going into the NCAA tournament,
you would like your players to be as fresh
and relaxed as possible. Yanking them
away from finals, distracting them from
the upcoming NCAA tournament, and
subjecting them to conference games 19,
20, and 21 is not the best way to prepare
the Pac-10 conference for success. With
out a tournament since 1990, Pac-10
teams won two national championships
and represented the conference in three
other final fours. With that kind of success
record, you have to question the sensibili
ty of conspiring to save Steve Lavin's job.

Ryan Stewart, a senior, would like to wish the
Cardinal the best oj lurk in the tournament.
