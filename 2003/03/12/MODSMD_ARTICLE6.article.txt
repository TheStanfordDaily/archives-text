# NBA player talks politics

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Adonal Foyle is not your typical professional
basketball player.
And, as a small audience of Stanford students
found out Monday afternoon, he's not your typical
political activist, either.
Having grown up on a Caribbean island of 400
people with his grandmother, a mule and no run
ning water, Foyle saw his skills take him all the way
to the National Basketball Association. However,
the equity of opportunity available to players look
ing to advance in basketball is something Foyle said
is sorely lacking in American politics.
"The only criterion for entrance [into the NBA]
is athletic prowess," Foyle said. "In very much the
same way, politics should give all of the gifted and
talented citizens the equal opportunity to compete
to serve in political life."

NBA player Adonal Foyle, a member of
Democracy Matters, encourages students
to overcome their political frustration and
become more involved in politics. Young
people, according to Foyle, have a voice
that can change this country.
Warriors, came to the United States
to play college basketball, though,
he was amazed at the political apa
thy he encountered amongst his
peers. Because of this, he founded
Democracy Matters, a student orga
nization dedicated to campaign fi
nance reform, two years ago.
"This system is not fair because it
requires so much money to run for
office," Foyle said. "It is incumbent
upon us to make sure that democ
racy is done right."
Through Democracy Matters,
which already has chapters on 46
American college campuses — in
cluding Stanford — Foyle, just 27
himself, wants to get young people
involved in the political process.
Foyle believes that the current
generation is not apathetic but
rather frustrated by a political sys
tem that rewards big money rather
dian creative thinking.
"The problem is not rich people,
the problem is the manner in which
rich people use campaign contribu
tions to control our political sys
tem," he said. "Everything in this so
ciety, what it comes down to is polit

ical access."
While Foyle has his own political
views, he stressed that Democracy
Matters and the push fora fairer
elections system is inclusive of all
viewpoints.
"We all have our own political
ideologies — Republicans, Democ
rats, independents," Foyle said of
the student leaders of Democracy
Matters, "and I think that's a good
thing."
Foyle added, "You don't have to
agree on anything, but you all have
a common platform — that you
need access to a political platform."
Foyle urged students to find
their own voice regarding cam
paign finance reform.
"I believe, personally, in full pub
lic funding of elections," he said.
"But I still hold out the option that
somebody else can come up with
something else that works better,
and I welcome that."
Foyle, who is still in the process of
obtaining U.S. citizenship, urged
the students in attendance to make
their voices heard and not to accept
the status quo of politics being dri
ven by private money.
"You have a voice, a voice that
could change this country," he said.
"There's no limit to where we can go
as young people."
