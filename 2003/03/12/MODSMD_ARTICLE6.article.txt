Adonal Foyle is not your typical professional
basketball player.
And, as a small audience of Stanford students
found out Monday afternoon, he's not your typical
political activist, either.
Having grown up on a Caribbean island of 400
people with his grandmother, a mule and no run
ning water, Foyle saw his skills take him all the way
to the National Basketball Association. However,
the equity of opportunity available to players look
ing to advance in basketball is something Foyle said
is sorely lacking in American politics.
"The only criterion for entrance [into the NBA]
is athletic prowess," Foyle said. "In very much the
same way, politics should give all of the gifted and
talented citizens the equal opportunity to compete
to serve in political life."

NBA player Adonal Foyle, a member of
Democracy Matters, encourages students
to overcome their political frustration and
become more involved in politics. Young
people, according to Foyle, have a voice
that can change this country.
