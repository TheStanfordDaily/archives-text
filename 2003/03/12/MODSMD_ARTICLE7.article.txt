## Simps-ly irresistible

The performance began with pop stars, but soon
transitioned to Slovenian opera, singing whales, danc
ing cats, history experts and an angry but misunder
stood Zeus. This wackiness was all part of the Stanford
Improvisers' end of quarter show, themed N*SYMP.

The Simps perform one extended show at the end
of each quarter. This quarter's show, which ran at 8
p.m. and 10 p.m. last Friday and Saturday, opened
with a cappella groups Mixed Company and Everyday
People at the early Friday and Saturday show, respec
tively, as well as celebrity guests and a pop-filled pro
motional video.
"I think this is the first time I think I've seen Simps
reach its full potential," said N*SYMP producer Jen
nifer Chou, a first-year law student. "I think this time,
we saw that Simps is really capable of doing a really,
really amazing show — I mean we had the video and
the a cappella groups and the smoke machine."
Chou, who has been a part of the Simps since her
undergraduate spring of 1998 with the exception of
last year, expressed particular pride in the movie,
which was produced by Phil Flores.
"I wanted something tangible and cool that we
could take around and show at the shows," she said.
"He [Floresl has huge props and he has our endless
admiration. He did it in like two days, which was real
ly amazing. We [saw the movie and] were like, 'unbe
lievable, we actually look hot.' "
The Simps perform the Theatre Sports format of
improv developed by Keith Johnstone. Johnstone got
the idea fora competitive style of improv, with two
teams and gimmicks, from watching a professional
wrestling match in England. Fora group to perform
the Theatre Sports format they must pay Johnstone a
licensing fee.
Two of the major gimmicks are the bag and the
horn, used to keep the show on track. If an audience
member is morally offended, he or she may call for the
offending performer to wear the brown paper bag
over his or her head for the duration of the next scene.
The horn is used by the judges to end a scene if it's
going poorly.
"Things definitely get horned, and it's just a relief
sometimes if you ran t figure out how to end the
scene," Chou said.
The excitement of the improv match was main
tained by dividing the performers into two teams —
