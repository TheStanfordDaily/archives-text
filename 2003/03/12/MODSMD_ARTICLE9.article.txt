Mandyam
mate of Mandyam, expressed
shock at his death.
"I refused to believe it until
Chris Griffith told me," Vish
wanath said.
He talked with Mandyam's
family and said they were also in a
state of shock.
Mandyam lived in Northpark
Apartments in Mountain View.
Though he did not have a huge
circle of friends at Stanford, Vish
wanath said that Mandyam was so-

rial. He was also a member of the
Stanford Cricket Club.
"He wasn't a closet case," he
said. "He had different circles. If it
meant driving to San Francisco to
see a friend, he'd do that."
Mandyam attended the Indian

Institute of Technology in Madras
(Chennai), graduating with a bach
elor of technology in 1995. He re
ceived a master's in electrical engi
neering from Stanford in June
2000 and was working toward his
doctoral degree. He started off

studying chemical engineering at
Stanford, but decided to switch to
electrical engineering to follow his
research interests. At the time of his
death, he was researching informa
tion and communications theory
with Electrical Engineering Prof.

Stephen Boyd.
Vishwanath and Mandyam both
worked in Electrical Engineering
Prof. Andrea Goldsmith's Wireless
Systems Laboratory and would talk
on the phone late at night in their
shared language of Tamil. Frequent

ly, they would talk about their work.
"Most people remember him as
very hard working," said Vish
wanath. "He slept very erratically
and even his eating patterns were
upset. He was very committed to
what he wanted to do."
