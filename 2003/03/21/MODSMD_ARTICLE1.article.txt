## STUDENTS REACT TO WAR Students and faculty protest war in city, on campus Police arrest more than 30 Stanford students for civil disobedience in San Francisco 
### ANTHONY HA ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
As part of a coordinated effort to protest
the start of war in Iraq, thousands of demon
strators inundated San Francisco yesterday,
marching, stopping traffic and blocking en
trances to buildings. Nearly 100 activists from
the Stanford community made the trip to the
city, many of them starting the day by form

ing a human chain that stretched across the
intersection of Folsom and Third streets. By
the time police succeeded in clearing the in
tersection three and a half hours later,
around 50 of the activists had been arrested,
more than 30 of which were students.
Stanford students were joined at the inter
section by University faculty, students from
Santa Clara University and members of the
Palo Alto community.
When asked about how she justified dis
rupting the lives of dozens of commuters, se

ever. This is nothing. Our lives are
being put on hold, too. We're here
because this is our collective respon
sibility."
Senior Valarie Brar, leading
the protesters in chants as they
were being arrested, said, "We
turn to nonviolent direct action as
a last resort... It is directed at no
specific building, business or gov
ernmental agency. This is a sym
bolic action ..
After President George W. Bush
announced that the United States
was at war with Iraq on Wednesday
night, many students traveled to the
city that evening, while others ar
rived in the early morning. Divided
into smaller cooperative teams
called affinity groups, the Stanford
community members came togeth
er at 7 a.m. to form an L-shape at
Third and Folsom, effectively
blocking the two one-way streets.
Many of the motorists stuck in
the resulting snarl reacted angrily,
honking their horns and shouting
profanity; one particularly in
flamed comn\uter sprayed several
of the protesters with mace. Other
passers-by had more positive re
sponses, such as a bicyclist who
shouted "No war for oil!" while dis

playing a peace sign with his hands.
"I appreciate the sentiment,"
said Bob Salvatoriello, one of the
motorists delayed by the action. "If
nothing else, it makes me miss
being 18 years old. Unfortunately, it
just seems awfully futile ... Plus, I
really need to get to work."
Harlow Williams, a veteran of
the Vietnam War, was among the
Palo Alto residents protesting.
"Violence doesn't work, I've
tried it,"he said. "We're showing
the administration that this war is
not going to be business as usual."
Evan Hughes, a senior at Santa
Clara, and a member of the Santa
Clara affinity group, said, "It's taken
a lot of careful planning and
thought to get our group organized.
Now that we've hooked up with the
Stanford groups, we have a lot of
power to let the city and country
know that while bombs are falling,
things can't go on as normal here."
About 40 minutes after they first
blocked the intersection, demonstra
tors were driven away by charging
police officers. As news helicopters
circled overhead and camera crews
filmed from the sidewalk, the stu
dents regrouped and decided to re
take the intersection, with many
choosing arrest over compliance.
A much larger contingent of po
lice arrived at the site within a few
minutes, cordoned off the protest
ers who chose to be arrested and

tried to simultaneously let traffic
through again.
But the process of arresting the
protesters dragged on fora couple
of hours, due in large part to the
limited resources of the San Fran
cisco Police Department. Police
forces could be seen rushing from
one intersection to the next, making
arrests and trying to clear the
streets.
One officer was heard telling an
other, "The trouble is we're spread
so thin ..
Two separate waves of marchers
came flooding through stopped
traffic in support of the students at
the intersection while officers pre
pared to make arrests. The police
had difficulty containing these new
groups and eventually brought in
additional officers on horseback
and on motorcycles to force the
marchers onto the sidewalks.
For the most part, the relation
ship between the police and Stan
ford protesters remained non-con
frontational. Many of the demon
strators on the sidewalk shouted
their thanks to police officers for
acting peacefully, to which one offi
cer responded, "You guys gotta do
your thing, we gotta do ours."
The protesters who had elected
to remain in the intersection were
arrested and transported to Pier 27.
Most of the demonstrators made
their bodies limp and had to be car

ried to the bus. Some struggled
against arrest and were treated
more harshly. With each arrest, a
new round of cheers of support for
the demonstrators erupted from
the crowd.
The last police bus carrying ar
rested Stanford students departed
for the intersection as another
march appeared in the distance; the
remaining protesters dispersed
throughout the district to join the
many other groups engaged in di
rect action. Within minutes, several
Stanford students were leading
chants for an action at Fourth and
Market streets. But this demonstra
tion, like many during the day,
ended less peacefully, with police
charging at demonstrators and in
juring some with nightsticks.
The police department estimated
that more than 1, 000 arrests were
made over the course of die day.
Some students taken to Pier 27
were charged with were minor traf
fic violations Their court date is set
for May 2, and they will probably
face a small fine. Others, who were
not carrying identification and re
fused to give their names, were re
leased without charge.
"The police were really pretty
nice," said sophomore Morgan
Reed, one of the Stanford students
who was arrested. "A lot of police of
ficers supported us and didn't hesi
tate to show it."
