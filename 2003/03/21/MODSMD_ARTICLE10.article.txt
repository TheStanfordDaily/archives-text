# Before war, students strive for balance
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
President George W. Bush's an
nouncement Monday evening that
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
had 48 hours to leave the country or
face military conflict left many stu
dents struggling to balance focusing
on finals with keeping appraised
with the seemingly imminent war.
Aside ft om small vigils and infor
mal discussions that occurred in the
50 hours between Bush's address
and the beginning of hostilities, stu
dent response — whether for or
against the war — was largely
muted until bombing began.
On Monday night, while most
students were preoccupied with
exams, small groups crowded
around televisions in their dorm
lounges and at the Coffee House to
hear Bush's 15-minute address.
"I'm up to my ears in work, and I
barely have time to sleep," said ju
nior Jeanine Jackson. "I've tried to
follow what's been going on; I'll have
to catch more after finals are done."
Other students found the whole
situation very ironic.
"It's depressing that for the next
48 hours I will be writing an ethics
paper, while our country launches
die largest pre-emptive — that is,
unprovoked — attack in its history,"
said junior Anselmo Alonso.
After Bush's Monday address,
several students against the war

came out to White Plaza on Tues
day morning to light candles
below a sign that read: "Light can
dles in solidarity with the Iraqi
people and U.S. troops." Many of
the students there have been at the
forefront of the anti-war move
ment on campus.
"Coming on the heels of the an
nouncement on Monday, it was a
time for many of us who had been
isolated by studying and finals to
come together in opposition to this
war," said junior Evan Berger, an
anti-war organizer with Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice.
"The announcement of war
has made the situation in Iraq
much more public. Students are
now coming to see the gravity of
the situation."
Berger added, "We want to
continue to assert to the country
that this war is wrong, and it will
have long-term ramifications.
Wars cost lives, wars cost money,
and wars always come back to bite
the aggressor."
Some students who are taking
classes on issues related to the war
said the concurrence of the war and
finals was helpful in bettering their
understanding of how they can be
involved with the government's de
cision making.
"I'm in the middle of writing a
paper for my public policy class that
has to do with national security,"
said junior Grace Chen. "At liberal

Stanford, in liberal California, stu
dents often forget that protesting
isn't the only way to make a differ
ence. Granted that no policy will be
passed in the immediate future to
stop the war, but students can make
a difference in the long run by get
ting involved in public policy.
"The fact that I am so focused on
finals has ended up giving me a new
perspective on how 1 see the war,"
Chen added.
On Wednesday night at 7:15
p.m., barely two hours after Hus
sein's deadline elapsed, students
again gathered around the televi
sion to hear news that an initial strike
against Iraq had been made.
Graduate student Sameer Al-
Sakran, of Jordan, watched both of
Bush's speeches and worried about
the repercussions that die invasion
could have for the future of his home
country and others in the region.
"I decided to watch the speech
es more out of curiosity than any
thing else, both believing the war
to be an unproductive course of
action and having spent the last
couple of years seeing the momen
tum slowly build towards it," Al-
Sakran said. "Now I worry about
the people [in Iraq] who will be
'shocked,' 'awed' and supposedly
'liberated' and wonder how much
ammunition the coming days will
give the most extreme and unde
sirable facets of Arab society in the
coming years."

An Iraqi flag and "Go War" sign hangs from a window in the Grove Mayfield
Row house on Monday, two days before war began. Supporters of war have
been less vocal on campus than those against war over the past week.
