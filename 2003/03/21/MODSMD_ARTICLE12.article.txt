## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial A 						war without reason 
### 
President George YV.
Bush's decision to de
clare war against Iraq is
an international embar
rassment and a diplomatic mis
take. In his address to the
nation on Wednesday, the pres
ident did not convince the pub
lic that his actions were neces
sary. A peaceful resolution in
the Middle East still could have
been attained, if the President
been more patient and more
willing to listen to the sugges
tions of the United Nations.
But he chose war instead.
We are disappointed by his
decision. But we as a communi
ty still have a moral obligation to
change our current situation.
And we have a duty to make
sure this kind of reasonless war
never happens again.
In his address to the nation,
Bush spoke of his "respect" for
the Iraqi citizens he had already
given the orders to attack. He
spoke of victory against an
enemy who has not provoked
the United States. He bragged
about being tough on Iraqi
troops, some of whom are hid
ing among civilians. (Bush ar
gued that it was Hussein's fault
for positioning the troops
where they would suffer a "final
atrocity" — he forget to say it
would be at the hands of the
United States.)
Bush put the burden of suc
cess on the men and women
now stationed in the Middle
East, claiming the nation "de
pends" on their fighting —

which conveniently ignores
Bush's instigation in this con
flict. And he has been totally
evasive on the subject of the cost
of war or his Marshall Plan for
rebuilding the country.
The president has not been
the only disappointing public
leader this week. Congress has
failed to provide a check on the
executive. Even the program
matically liberal Minority Whip
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has not
questioned the war, instead
pledging her support to the sol
diers overseas.
New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg boasted that the
people of New York are behind
the president and supportive of
the war. Yet across the country,
many are voicing their skepti
cism of a connection between
the Sept. 11 assault on the
World Trade Center and the
current invasion.
Most disturbingly, the media
has all but ignored these voices
and has both underestimated
and underreported the
strength of anti-war activism,
while empowering those pro
testers more committed to con
frontation than peace. The ego
mania and lust for attention of a
few status seekers and political
opportunists has alienated
many potential allies from the
vast, meritorious anti-war
movement.
Now that the drama of war is
the marquee act, this same

media has quickly shifted into com
mentary on military strategy, while
inventing new reasons for the war.
Yet Americans still don't know why
this is happening, and they feel
their voices opposing war are being
ignored.
We as a community have an
obligation to change the current
situation. We may feel far-removed
from this conflict because we are
presumably safe at Stanford, eating
full meals, sleeping in warm beds
and writing papers and final
exams. But we cannot bury our
noses in books and pretend war
isn't happening. We need to partic
ipate in our democracy, however
misguided it may be.
More than 100 members of the

community did that in a very pub
lic way yesterday at a protest in
San Francisco. Students and pro
fessors missed finals and stood up
for their beliefs.
Tomorrow marks the first day of
spring break, and while students
should enjoy the week off, they
cannot forget about the gravity of
these times or the great disappoint
ment that looms in the air.
Many members of the Stanford
community already hold or will
go on to hold influential and im
portant posts in government, law,
politics and business. They must
monitor the U.S. government's
actions carefully and take note of
the response from the rest of the
world.
This war is already a failure that
cannot be repeated. In the months
to come, we will live through the
second gulf war of our generation.
There cannot be a third.
