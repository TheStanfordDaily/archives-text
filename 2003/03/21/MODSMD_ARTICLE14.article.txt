# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Uneasy feelings in time of war 
### 
It's spring. Tufts of green are
emerging from the blankets of
melting frost, and the trees, dor
mant after months of hiberna
tion, will finally be resplendent again
with the pulse of life.
With such glorious things occurring
all around us, the folks over at the
White House are celebrating also.
What they have in mind, however, is

slightly different: the rebirth of the Iraqi government,
the reawakening of the public's cohesiveness, and the
resurgence of American hegemony.
At the end of a week full of tests and papers, we some
times forget that the world exists beyond the confines of
our educational institution. And boy, has it been moving
fast. In just the last few days, after a series of puppet
meetings, including one in the plush Azores, the Bush
administration decided to undermine the credence of
the United Nations and, instead, push ahead widi an
agenda of war.
At Stanford, the liberal-tinged student body must be
seething from such gloomy prospects. Now, more than
ever, we'll be blaming the Nader apologists for not hand
ing their support to A1 Gore in the 2000 election.

Unfortunately, it's pointless to speculate now.
Bush has put a big fat bulls-eye on Saddam Hussein's
forehead, and we're sending the world's best-equipped
armed forces to nail him.
Indeed, the Hoover Institution members on the Na
tional Defense Board are having the last laugh, drop
ping their elephant dung on the donkey culture that so
blithely pervades our campus. So what do we do now?
The letter drives to Condi, the class ditching, the heated
debates, all may not have been futile, but they did not
seem to register even a hesitant afterthought in the
labyrinth of Bush's mind.
What I'd give to get even the most ephemeral of
glances into Bush's brain. Perhaps he is intent on act
ing out the role of the prodigal son, to retaliate for
the assassination attempt on his father's life. Perhaps
he has some oil interests, or maybe he wants to make
some headway in the Middle East by sowing the
seeds fora fledgling democracy. We don't know. All
we're sure about is the fact that there's war and that
thousands of U.S. young men and women are over in
the Middle East, acting out the will of their county's
leaders.
