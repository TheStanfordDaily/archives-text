# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Uneasy feelings in time of war 
### 
It's spring. Tufts of green are
emerging from the blankets of
melting frost, and the trees, dor
mant after months of hiberna
tion, will finally be resplendent again
with the pulse of life.
With such glorious things occurring
all around us, the folks over at the
White House are celebrating also.
What they have in mind, however, is

slightly different: the rebirth of the Iraqi government,
the reawakening of the public's cohesiveness, and the
resurgence of American hegemony.
At the end of a week full of tests and papers, we some
times forget that the world exists beyond the confines of
our educational institution. And boy, has it been moving
fast. In just the last few days, after a series of puppet
meetings, including one in the plush Azores, the Bush
administration decided to undermine the credence of
the United Nations and, instead, push ahead widi an
agenda of war.
At Stanford, the liberal-tinged student body must be
seething from such gloomy prospects. Now, more than
ever, we'll be blaming the Nader apologists for not hand
ing their support to A1 Gore in the 2000 election.

Unfortunately, it's pointless to speculate now.
Bush has put a big fat bulls-eye on Saddam Hussein's
forehead, and we're sending the world's best-equipped
armed forces to nail him.
Indeed, the Hoover Institution members on the Na
tional Defense Board are having the last laugh, drop
ping their elephant dung on the donkey culture that so
blithely pervades our campus. So what do we do now?
The letter drives to Condi, the class ditching, the heated
debates, all may not have been futile, but they did not
seem to register even a hesitant afterthought in the
labyrinth of Bush's mind.
What I'd give to get even the most ephemeral of
glances into Bush's brain. Perhaps he is intent on act
ing out the role of the prodigal son, to retaliate for
the assassination attempt on his father's life. Perhaps
he has some oil interests, or maybe he wants to make
some headway in the Middle East by sowing the
seeds fora fledgling democracy. We don't know. All
we're sure about is the fact that there's war and that
thousands of U.S. young men and women are over in
the Middle East, acting out the will of their county's
leaders.

For the first time since Desert
Storm, I'll be feeling uneasy about
the prospects of armed conflict.
Kosovo and Afghanistan, skirmishes
supported by multinational al
liancesâ€” they all seemed distant
enough that I didn't have to keep up
with the progress on a daily basis. As
the war drum beats all the way to
Baghdad, however, the media will
be inundating us with a constant
stream of war images, reminding us
that the United States is involved in
a serious conflict many other nations
do not wish to participate in.
As I enjoy my downtime during
spring break, I'll feel guilty diat
while I'm laughing up a storm with
my buddies in Mexico, people my
age will be marching through Ara

bia, and fighting man-to-man, their
lives in constant peril.
Over here at home, the best we
can do now is hope and pray that the
Iraqi army will put their guns down
before too many bullets are fired
and that the war will be over in a
matter of weeks. Unfortunately,
some soldiers will inevitably come
back in body bags, but we'll make
sure that, with a gun salute and a
plot in Arlington, they'll be remem
bered in posterity.
Behind every soldier stands a
throng of family and friends, eager
ly awaiting his return. Behind every
army stands a nation, perhaps bit
terly divided between doves and
hawks, but still viscerally aware of
the horrendous tolls a war has on
the collective psyche.
