War is based on 'ruins
of diplomacy'
The New York Times got it
right: This war is conducted on the
ruins of diplomacy. I would not op
pose a military-enforced disarma
ment and regime change in Iraq
had it followed a reasonable period
of inspection and had it been con
ducted with United Nations Secu
rity Council support.
But, despite having achieved
through the U.N. a highly coercive
inspection regime, the Bush ad

ministration would not give it time
to work. The result will have seri
ous future consequences.
First, it is not clear that the tra
ditional allies that broke with us on
invasion will help us construct a
workable peace, and we need
them.
Second, our contemptuous dis
regard for U.N. inspection and
monitoring systems has damaged
public confidence in them and in
the U.N. itself and will create a
rolling liability for the global mis
sion of controlling the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.
Finally, we have earned a repu
tation for heavv-handed, unilateral

action that will be hard to erase and
will handicap us in developing fu
ture coalitions.

Professor wise to postpone finals
I wanted to thank history pro
fessor Barton Berstein, who al
lowed students in his U.S. history
course to put off taking today's
scheduled final until after spring
break. I would like to pass a similar
note of gratitude to any other pro
fessors who did the same.

Berstein sent an e-mail to his
students Wednesday recogniz
ing that many would be having
difficulty studying with the war
breaking out, and his offer to
postpone the exam may have
taken a great deal of stress off
students who were glued to TVs
and computers to watch cover
age of the war.
Bernstein and other professors
who delayed exams should be
commended for showing fore
sight, understanding, and compas
sion towards students who would
understandably find it nearly im
possible to focus on exams that
seem relatively trivial compared to

what is happening elsewhere in the
world.
I hope all Stanford professors
take note of Bernstein's action and
show a similar concern for their
students should such a situation
occur in the future. While acade
mics and exams are very impor
tant, I am glad that at least one pro
fessor — and hopefully many oth
ers — was able to see that historical
and unsettled situations like those
taking place right now call for tak
ing unusual measures to accom
modate student needs.
