## Turn now to prayer, fasting 
### SCOTTY McLENNAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
The war that so many worked to prevent
has begun. What now for those of us who ar
gued this war against Iraq is unjust and un
justifiable? Continued protest? Certainly for
some. Perhaps again for me if the war con
tinues beyond the three weeks U.S. com
manders say it will take to conquer Iraq.
Yet, as our troops begin heading into
harm's way, I suggest that we at home turn
to three traditional religious responses:
prayer, fasting and almsgiving.
It certainly must not be business as usual
here on the home front. This is not like the
aftermath of Sept. 11, when leaders en
couraged us to carry on.
Now, we have invaded another nation,
and our troops' lives are at risk, along with
those of Iraq and its civilian population. We
must honor and participate in their sacrifice
with at least some level of sacrifice of our own.
War is not pretty. It's hell. There's a
strong Christian tradition, tracing back to
St. Augustine, which holds that war can be
justified under the right conditions, but it's
never holy. It's hell. Soldiers die or are
maimed forever.
Civilians die or are maimed as "collateral
damage." Buildings are destroyed. People
are forced from their homes and become
refugees. Families are devastated and lives
are shattered. Fear pervades all. So, as our
troops move into battle, as they lay their
lives on the line, and as this war is fought on
Iraqi soil with tens of thousands of Iraqi
deaths expected, what exacdy should we be
doing back here on American soil?
First, let us pray fervently that this war
will end quickly and with as little loss of life
as possible on both sides. Let us pray fer
vently, in the just war tradition, that greater
good shall come from the harm that will be
wrought. Let us pray fervently, as just war
theorist Reinhold Niebuhr taught, for
God's forgiveness for our fallen state, for
our imperfect actions and for our inability

to have avoided war in the first place.
Second, let us fast. St. Augustine wrote in
his fifth-century treatise on the usefulness
of fasting that a primary concern of ours
during this mortal life should be to hunger
and thirst after justice. Fasting from food
and drink, Augustine claims, helps us to be
less attached to earthly pleasures and frees
us fora fuller and more rewarding spiritu
al life in pursuit of justice. This allows what
he calls our sense of charity to be more at
tentive. As people who voluntarily fast,
we're reminded deep down in our belly, lit
erally in our gut, of all those who hunger
and thirst involuntarily. Our stomachs help
our minds and our spirits to remember the
profound deprivations of war.
We can gain a small sense of solidarity
with those who face death and destruction
all the time. Fasting has a long history,
going back to ancient Israel where it was
observed especially in times of mourning
and of calamity, in order to give added
force to prayers for delivery. Later it was
also seen a means of penance and as a stim
ulant to almsgiving.
Third, let us now give the money we save
by fasting to groups with a solid history of
good humanitarian work in Iraq like
UNICEF and the U.N. High Commission
er for Refugees. We can also take time to
write letters to our troops in harm's way.
We can work to protect Iraqi Americans,
international students and others who may
be susceptible to discrimination or oppres
sion in this country. We can participate in
ensuring our nation's promises to rebuild
Iraq after the war.
We face hard times ahead — much more
so for those in uniform, of course, and for
those who are simply trying to live their
lives in Iraq. If we can let inward love guide
our deeds in these days, we have the best
hope for reconstituting peace and justice in
our world for the future.
