# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Protests empower students 
### VALARIE KAUR BRAR GUEST COLUMNIST 
Those who oppose the recently launched
war have two options: stay inside and watch
the video-game version of the war on televi
sion or take to die streets.
I choose the streets.
Before Iraq entered my daily life, I did not
understand street protests. People waving
signs, chanting in unison and getting arrested
frightened me. Even when I strongly op
posed post-Sept. 11 policies of the Bush ad
ministration-become-empire, I shied away
from the streets and expressed my politics
through academic scholarship. I document
ed hate crimes and the loss of civil liberties
and communicated my studies through for
mal speeches and papers written in my dorm
room. But war drums grew louder and loud
er, shook the glass bubble around my elite
university and made me feel less and less em
powered.
So I took a leap of faith. With other Stan
ford students, I entered the streets of San
Francisco to support and witness civil disobe
dience. I joined the nonviolent direct action
movement against the war as a legal observer,
someone who documents and protects
against police brutality.
I marched with protesters who blocked the
Pacific Stock Exchange (March 14), ran with
the breakaway march down Market Street
(March 15) and photographed people in
white body bags who dropped to the asphalt
in front of the UK consulate office (March 17).
I witnessed dozens upon dozens of arrests,
documented several incidences of police mis
treatment and danced to the people's songs:
9/11 and Iraq: no connection, don't attack!
Not in our name, Not for our sake! Solidarity
now!
On my first direct action at the Pacific
Stock Exchange, I met the eyes of an elderly
woman sitting in the middle of the intersec
tion. She was blocking a section of the San
Francisco Financial District; when the bomb
ing began, she likely joined thousands in

shutting down all of it. Surrounded by police
officers, the woman linked arms with the man
next to her and raised her voice to the music:
This is what democracy looks like!
How can breaking the law and blocking
traffic be democracy? When die government
fails to seriously recognize world opinion or
national dissent, when the people cannot vote
on a pre-emptive war and do not want an un
just war, democracy means speaking out and
standing out. It means finding courage to
stand for convictions. It is a civic duty. On that
street, this woman stood and refused to move.
This Thursday, close to 100 Stanford stu
dents engaged in nonviolent direct action in
San Francisco. I decided to join them. Our
arrests made an impact. Joining thousands
of people, we stalled large American busi
nesses, representatives of business and cor
porations that profit the most from the war
machine. We expressed our stance against
the war in the strongest nonviolent way pos
sible and attracted media attention to the
peace movement. While we upset some
people bent on getting to work on time, we
inspired so many more with creative, posi
tive, and joyous energy.
Most importantly, we upraised a collec
tive message: We will not allow business to
continue while the administration kills peo
ple like you and me in our name, for our
sake. We will exact a price, and in doing so,
we will raise our voices.
I suddenly understood. Nonviolent civil
disobedience has power and celebration
rushing through its veins, it beats in the peo
ple like one gigantic heart, bleeding for peace.
It is the most powerful and direct way to make
a political statement. Media reports often con
vey the dramatic spectacles of dissenters
rather than the solidarity and purpose kin
dling the fire of their resistance. I bore witness
to this fire and to my surprise, found deep
connection and real empowerment. Even as
the bombs fall, I have never felt more em
powered in my life.
