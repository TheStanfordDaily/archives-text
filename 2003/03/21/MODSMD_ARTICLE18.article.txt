# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## A 						student remembers how he escaped from Kuwait 
### WAEL SALLOUM GUEST COLUMNIST 
I was asked to write a column as
someone who has family in the Mid
dle East and who has a personal con
nection to the events that seem to be
engulfing the world at such a rapid
pace. I am sure that many people
liave already decided what I will say
— I am also sure that after reading
this column most will be surprised.
My family and I survived the first
Gulf War. I was an 8-year-old when
the first Gulf War occurred. My
aunt and some members of my fam
ily, including my mother, were
trapped in Kuwait. My father, sister
and I were in Lebanon. I remember
my father addressing my sister and
me solemnly, saying that we had no
money left, but not to worry. He
would take care of us. He also said
our mother could be gone fora very
long time. Later, I wanted a soda,
and I saw my cousin had a half-fin
ished Pepsi. I asked my father if I

could finish it. He responded by
saying that I should just go and buy
my own drink.
"But I thought we had no
money left, and whatever we do
have, we should use to get mommy
back," I said. My father deteriorat
ed into tears. Do you know how
hard it is to see your father cry?
Imagine how hard it is not to know
why your father is crying. Was it
something I said?
My mother escaped Kuwait by
riding a bus all the way through
Iraq. At various points, she faked
different accents, pretended to be
of different nationalities and man
aged to smuggle out enough
money for my family to fly to
Greece. There, my parents found
jobs and put my sister and me
through third grade. Upon our re
turn to Kuwait, however, the sky
was black from all the burnt oil.
My dad started a company that
helped restore the environment,
and he removed mines from the

war and sealed the oil wells. As a kid,
I toured the buildings and places
where brave Kuwaitis made their
final stand. At one building, there
was a massive hole through the wall,
with blood all over the floor. There
was a peculiar green stain around
the lower part of the hole. Appar
ently, an Iraqi contingent fired a
tank shell through the building,
catching a Kuwaiti soldier in the
head. That green stain was what
was left of his brain.
Finally, 1 remember the cork
screw torture device that Saddam
Hussein employed. Think of a
long corkscrew and think of your
rear. And I believe you will have
the picture.
So why am I so against the war?
Why am I here wearing black with a
green band around my hand? Be
cause I know this will not solve any
problems and this will not stabilize
the Middle East. What worries me
most is this belief that seems to be
taking root in the United States.

The belief is that America does not
need anyone. As an American, I ask
you to seriously reconsider. The
world is not defined by you. It is not
defined by the States. It is far bigger
and far more complex. The greatest
mistake any country can do is to
shut out the outside world. For in
doing so, it invites its own destruc
tion.
I do not have time to discuss why
attacking Iraq will not stabilize the
Middle East or why it will not pro
vide greater security for the United
States or even Israel. This attack has
clearly cost the United States the re
spect and reputation it possessed
across the world. Even its allies have
turned against it. It has pitted itself
against the United Nations.
The United States does not have
any clear plan fora post-war Iraq.
The only plan I have heard so far in
volves the United States occupying
by force. Arguments that this war is
not about oil lose credibility. More
over, in occupying a country, and

trying to force your ideals, you sim
ply invite opposition. You have to
teach, not colonize.
The United States has great
ideals, and it should be a beacon
of light in such a troubled re
gion. But the unilateral actions
that the United States seems de
termined to undertake, its fail
ure to view both sides of the pic
ture and its consistent blame on a
given side in any conflict in that
region, ruin all possibility the
United States will ever be the
light it needs to be.
The United States has effectively
told the world, "It does not matter
what you think. We will run the
world our way." That's a shame, for
in doing so the United States has
not only given away its greatest gift,
it's given away the greatest gift the
world has ever had.

and far more complex. The greatest
mistake any country can do is to
shut out the outside world. For in
doing so, it invites its own destruc
tion.
I do not have time to discuss why
attacking Iraq will not stabilize the
Middle East or why it will not pro
vide greater security for the United
States or even Israel. This attack has
clearly cost the United States the re
spect and reputation it possessed
across the world. Even its allies have
turned against it. It has pitted itself
against the United Nations.
The United States does not have
any clear plan fora post-war Iraq.
The only plan I have heard so far in
volves the United States occupying
by force. Arguments that this war is
not about oil lose credibility. More
over, in occupying a country, and

trying to force your ideals, you sim
ply invite opposition. You have to
teach, not colonize.
The United States has great
ideals, and it should be a beacon
of light in such a troubled re
gion. But the unilateral actions
that the United States seems de
termined to undertake, its fail
ure to view both sides of the pic
ture and its consistent blame on a
given side in any conflict in that
region, ruin all possibility the
United States will ever be the
light it needs to be.
The United States has effectively
told the world, "It does not matter
what you think. We will run the
world our way." That's a shame, for
in doing so the United States has
not only given away its greatest gift,
it's given away the greatest gift the
world has ever had.
