# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## 'Let Ahab beware Ahab,' Melville says 
### NICHOLAS CASEY GUEST COLUMNIST 
Back in the day, Herman Melville put
a few words in his sailor's mouth that we
might take a moment to consider: "Let
Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself
old man."
When today's journalists write about
the happenings of this month, they'll be
speaking in terms of freedom fries, de
capitation attacks and shields of liberty.
But years from now — somewhere in the
covers of molding books on our grand
children's shelves — the rhetoric might
look somewhat different.
George W. Bush and the American
people engaged in lengthy, attack non
pareil which took place after Sept. 11.
Our attack was not on the Arab world. It
was on ourselves.
When we discovered that the enemy
was not so easily spotted, we decided
that our fears would only be allayed by
binding our own arms. Freedoms were
limited. Somehow, in the process, we
thought that our enemy's limbs would
be bound too.
So one by one, we brought John As
croft our library cards, the histories of our
Internet browsers and if we were not yet
citizens, our entitlement to legal repre
sentation. We, the American people, now
sit before military tribunals held in secret
when our rights demand the possibility of
open trial by jury.
We know that our safety is hallmark,
but we are beginning to suspect this ad
ministration's methods. Too many con
tinue to bend over, waving flags. But
today, as Americans begin to die, our

smiles are beginning to fade.
So before I continue writing, let me ex
tend an invitation to you all. Welcome to
the Pequod. Welcome to Captain Ahab's
ship and our quest for the white whale.
Thar she blows.
Or so we have heard the call to har
poons so many times.
She blows in Afghanistan; she blows in
our homeland. When she blows, we must
depose the dark-skinned people of this
country in quiet rooms with the FBI.
But often I begin to wonder whether
what we thought we saw was the spout of
the terrorist whale or just our own imagi
nations running away with us.
Since Sept. 11, there has been no ter
rorist attack on the United States. We
often forget that. We forget this like we
forget the fact that reluctant American
forces now charge into an oileous country
which had no involvement in the Septem
ber attacks.
At home, the forgetting continues.
We have forgotten our framework as we
rebuild it. The Office of Homeland Se
curity would have been Joseph Mc-
Carthy's dream. It is here to stay, this
Orwellian implant and no succeeding
president would dare to dismantle it. I
look into Tom Ridge's eyes as he raises
our alert level from salmon to periwin
kle and wonder what is racing through
his mind.
But more importantly, I wonder what
will pass though the minds of the string of
men who will flex the muscles of this
young office in the years to come, the
power and the temptation they will have
to abuse and destroy. If I could only show
people the future where this fledgling has

become a monster.
Today we are ruled by a USA Patriot
Act which no one understands, no one
has read. I tried one time to read it. I
didn't realize what a fool I was until I
started to scan the contents, discovering
its prose was merely 400 pages of adden
dums and deletions referring to sections,
lines and semicolons in other acts con
tained in law books I didn't own.
But we shouldn't forget how key ad
dendums truly are. "Animal Farm" fea
tured a brilliant one. "All animals are
equal," read the sign; its addendum said:
"but some animals are more equal than
others."
This morning I know just how those
animals felt, knowing the pigs had
changed something vital, unable to figure
out just what. Today we parade into Iraq
convinced that the aftermath of this war
contains the horizon of our safety. But lis
ten folks: Iraq is a small-fry.
Today's infants never knew yesterday's
civil liberties. The proverbial clock is tick
ing: If we do not restore our rights in one
generation's time, anyone with any pull
will be too young to have ever remem
bered them.
Perhaps we should just smile and con
gratulate ourselves for holding out so
long. Two hundred twenty-seven years of
a free society is, after all, more than any
one else managed. Maybe every culture
has to be a police state one day.
And maybe the day is not too far when
our children will turn to other lands in
search of the freedom we once boasted of.

tained in law books I didn't own.
But we shouldn't forget how key ad
dendums truly are. "Animal Farm" fea
tured a brilliant one. "All animals are
equal," read the sign; its addendum said:
"but some animals are more equal than
others."
This morning I know just how those
animals felt, knowing the pigs had
changed something vital, unable to figure
out just what. Today we parade into Iraq
convinced that the aftermath of this war
contains the horizon of our safety. But lis
ten folks: Iraq is a small-fry.
Today's infants never knew yesterday's
civil liberties. The proverbial clock is tick
ing: If we do not restore our rights in one
generation's time, anyone with any pull
will be too young to have ever remem
bered them.
Perhaps we should just smile and con
gratulate ourselves for holding out so
long. Two hundred twenty-seven years of
a free society is, after all, more than any
one else managed. Maybe every culture
has to be a police state one day.
And maybe the day is not too far when
our children will turn to other lands in
search of the freedom we once boasted of.
