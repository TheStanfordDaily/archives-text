## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
At a "rapid response" anti-war rally charac
terized by a mixture of sorrow, anger, frustra
tion and determination, over 200 Stanford
students, faculty and community members
gathered in White Plaza yesterday afternoon
before marching to Palo Alto to join a larger,
citywide protest.

Several dozen students were dressed en
tirely in black and organizers distributed
green armbands for attendees to express
their opposition to the war. Outlines of bodies
were drawn on the ground in chalk, along
with anti-war statements such as "Call it liber
ation, call it slaughter, last night the war was
bombs in Iraq."
Assoc. Drama and Classics Prof. Rush
Rehm began the rally by reporting on the di
rect action carried out in San Francisco by
Stanford students and faculty, more than 30 of
whom were arrested.
"All I can do is encourage us to come to
gether and to tight against this war and all that
it represents," Rehm said, adding that the
anti-war movement is "not for sprinters, it's for
long-distance runners — and diat's what we
have to be."
About 60 students were present at the 3
p.m. start of the rally, which grew over the
next hour as passers-by stopped to listen to
often emotional commentary from students,
many of whom were still not through with
winter quarter finals and papers.
The rally's emcee, junior Evan Berger, ex
tended his prayers to the Iraqis, to the Ameri
can troops and to the United States.
"I hope and pray that this war does not cre
ate another generation of Osama bin
Ladens... It is for them and for us that I hope
and pray we do not create another generation
of those who hate us with this war," said Berg
er, who had a final exam at 7 p.m. last night.
"Though the government has not heeded
our call, I still believe that what we're doing is
important," he said, citing the need to demon
strate domestic opposition to the war to the in
ternational community. "I believe it is even
more important that we let the people of this
country know that war has ramifications."
Berger added that attending protests to
voice dissent was especially important for him,
saying that he couldn't "go home every night,
flip on CNN and watch the talking heads."
Although many of the students who had
been organizing anti-war rallies throughout
the year were absent from White Plaza yester
day because of the direct action in San Fran
cisco, Berger said afterwards that he was im
pressed by the turnout.
"This war really mobilized those who are
strongly against it,"he said, adding that "it was
a very tough time for us to deal with this."
"A lot of us, like me, just prioritized in favor
of this war," Berger said. "I'll probably get a C
on my final today, but whatever."
History Prof. A1 Camarillo, donning a
green armband, described his emotions to the
gathering as "sorrow, because those smart
bombs are not that intelligent" and anger at an
"administration hell-bent on war" without in
ternational support.
"Don't believe the reports that you hear
from CNN or others," he said.
"Some people will say, 'I can't do anything
about it, so I'll just go on and live my life like
nothing happened,' " Camarillo said. "Peace
tul, non-violent protest, over a long period,
works. You can't give up just [after] going to
one demonstration."

Khalil Barhoum, coordination of Middle
Eastern and African Languages and Litera
tures, directed his remarks to President
George W. Bush.
"We say to Bush the son, This war is yours,
not ours," he said. "Mr. Bush, tell us, please,
who made you god of the universe? Who
made you and Tony Blair sole guardians and
protectors of the oppressed in the Arab
World?" he asked, stilting that Bush had done
little to deal with the humanitarian situation of
the Palestinians.
At 3:45 p.m., the microphone was opened to
anybody from the crowd who wanted to speak.
The first speaker, a woman from Tibet
named Doma who says she visits the Stanford
Bookstore each day, recounted the loss of
many of her family members through war in
her home country.
"I lost my country, I hate war," she said,
apologizing for her broken English to the
crowd, which responded with applause.
"The Dalai Lama told me when I was 15
years old, The most important thing in life is
peace.' "
She was followed by a student named Jack
ie, who addressed the crowd while fighting to
hold back tears.
"We've been listening to a lot of lies and our
government is full of liars," she said. "Every
person here hits to believe that they have it in
side of them to fight this war."
Sister Gloria, a Dominican sister of the
Catholic Community at Stanford, read a letter
sent from the 140 Dominican sisters in Iraq, ex
pressing their anxiety and fear about the war.
An undergraduate student named Jonny ex
pressed his frustration at being considered irra
tional and un-American for opposing the war.
"Something is wrong, and I want some in
formation, and God, I'm still an American,"
he said.
At 4:15 p.m., a contingent of 80 rally atten
dees, including Stanford students, Palo Alto
High School students and community mem
bers, marched up Palm Drive to Palo Alto City
Hall to join a rally of over 300 people organized
by the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center.
This was the fourth anti-war protest at
tended by the 9-month-old son of Jennifer An
derson and DinoTeddyputra, who live near
by Stanford and marched with students to
Palo Alto.
"We're just completely opposed to the war
in every way," Anderson said.
As the family marched, Anderson pushed a
stroller with a sign reading "Another family
demands peace now" while Teddyputra's
shoulders carried his son, who held a red sign
reading "Peace."
Cars driving by would frequendy honk in
support of the marchers, who chanted slogans

like "Move, Bush, get out the way" and"The
people united will never be defeated." As the
group approached Palo Alto with a banner
reading "Stanford Peace," an elderly couple
drove by and made a peace sign in their car
window while honking in unison with the
marchers' cheers of "1, 2, 3, 4— We don't
want your racist war."
As the marchers neared City Hall, store
and restaurant owners stood by the shop
doors to watch the protesters, who were ac
companied by police escorts.

Upon reaching the site, marchers were
given signs reading "Peace —No War for
Empire."
At the rally, sophomore Haibinh Nguyen,
wearing a sandwich board with the word
"Alert" covering it, spoke to the crowd on behalf
of the Coalition of Students Against War.
"We believe life shouldn't go on as normal
once war has started," she said. "There are a
lot of us who haven't been done with finals, like
me, but we have to come out and we have to
continue our struggle."
