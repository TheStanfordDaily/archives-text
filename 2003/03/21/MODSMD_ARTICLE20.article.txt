## War journey similar to NCAA tourney

It's that time of year again â€” March
Madness. And this year, when you tune
into CBS, expect the unexpected. Here
are my best bets for this year's sleepers
and Cinderellas:
In the Midwest, do not pick anybody
to knock off this season's most dominate
presence, W. Bush. I expect that Ameri
can Family will surprise, but in the end,
even though it has the best shot, it will not
have enough to overcome the will of W.
Also look for Hippies to make a surprise
showing, though it will fall short of the
Elite Eight.
In the West look for S. Hussein to

make an early exit at the hands of Polish
Army, which will open the door wide
open for sleepers like Taliban and O. Bin
Laden. Also, look for B2 Bomber, with its
great outside game, to make a strong
showing. In the end, however, I foresee
O. Bin revenging its early-season thrash
ing at the hands of 82.
The South is up in the air with peren
nial cinderellas Ditkas and the always
scary Dick Cheney. A lot of people have
written off the top seed Scud Missile as
overrated, but I don't think it should be
discounted. Look for its first-round
matchup against the play-in winner to be
an early indicator. And off course, do not
forget about Weapons of Mass Destruc

tion, even though they have not shown
up this entire year.
In the East, a lot has been made about
the danger of Terrorist State, and while
nobody questions its ability to dispose of
Weber St.and U.N. Credibility, I would
put my money on Oil defeating it in the
Sweet Sixteen. And do not forget CNN's
ability to expose Condi Rice's weakness
es and even make a surprise run to the
final four.
And my prediction for this year's Final
Four is Scud over W, which will be com
ing off a tough game against (). Bin.
