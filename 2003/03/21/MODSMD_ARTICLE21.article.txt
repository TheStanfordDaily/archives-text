More than 100 students and
members of the Stanford commu
nity gathered last night at Memo
rial Church at a vigil for prayer,
reflection and meditation. Dean
for Religious Life Rev. Scotty
McLennan stressed the need for
prayer and personal action, while
Provost John Etchemendy en
couraged rational discussion and
understanding.
The overarching theme of the
vigil, though, was peace.
McLennan's opening words
were an excerpt from Psalm 37,
which states, in part, "Mark the
blameless, and behold the up
right, for there is posterity for
the peaceable. The salvation of
the righteous is from God, who
is their refuge in the time of
trouble."
While the multifaith vigil was
spiritual in nature, the speakers
stressed inclusiveness.
"Our intent is to bring all
members of the Stanford com

munity here together regardless
of religion . . . regardless of
your opinion on the legitimacy
of this war," McLennan said.
"We can reflect upon our com
mon humanity . . . and our uni
versal desire, eventually, for
peace and justice."

Etchemendy's message fo
cused on tolerance of different
viewpoints on the war and an ef
fort to understand and educate.
"[Rational discourse] is how we
will arrive at the understanding
that seems so scarce today," he
said. "I am confident that the

Stanford community will not for
get our common ground."
The vigil also included several
prayers and hymns, as well as giv
ing attendees the chance to light a
candle and offer a prayer or mes
sage to the gathering. Several
dozen people lit candles but only a

few chose to speak.
"Each of us can make a differ
ence both large and small today,"
McLennan said in his closing re
marks.
The event ended with a period
of what McLennan called "pure,
meditative silence."
