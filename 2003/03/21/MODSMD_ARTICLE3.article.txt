# Finals dull reaction to start of war
## 
### WILL OREMUS EDITORIAL STAFF 
Students across campus gathered in
front of television screens Wednesday
evening as President George W. Bush
gravely announced that war in Iraq had
begun. But three hours later, with the "de
capitation strike" over and the morning
sky above Baghdad eerily silent, most Stan
ford students had returned to their desks
to study for exams.
With a characteristic mixture of apathy,
activism and quiet apprehension, the cam-

as American and

British forces launched the first phase of
ground and artillery attacks. While a sig
nificant number of students took to the
streets to "wage peace" in San Francisco
and Palo Alto, the majority found just
enough time to flip on the television or
click to cnn.com to check up on the pro
ceedings during study breaks.
"I would have spent a lot more time
watching TV and reading about it if it
wasn't during finals week," said senior
Derek Jackson. "I probably would have
gone to the protests today, but instead I
was in the library studying all day — it's re
ally sad."
The intensity of the reaction to the war
varied between residences.
Senior Vinny Magno said that "every
one in Murray has been watching TV,"
while in Otero, "nobody said anything
about it," according to freshman Corie
Geballe.
Whether it's because of I-Hum exams or
lack of practice at escaping the Stanford bub
ble, freshmen in general seemed less preoc
cupied with the war than older students.
Junior Sam Gellman, the head peer aca
demic coordinator in Rinconada, said that
residents of the freshman dormitory "were
pretty much going on with their lives. I
don't think anyone was really distracted —

maybe by the basketball tournament, but
not the bombing."
In contrast, senior Noga Leviner said
that the residents of Enchanted Broccoli
Forest reacted to the outbreak of hostilities
with serious concern.
"In my house, there's definitely a signif
icant number of people who are commit

ted to making what's going on the main
focus of their life right now," she said.
Leviner has witnessed little disagree
ment among her housemates.
"I see two types of reactions: some peo
ple are sad, and others are angry," she said.

Senior Faisal Tajdar listens to speakers at yesterday's White Plaza rally protesting the start of
war in Iraq. A sign behind him, one of many sandwich boards worn by organizers at the rally
and during the march to Palo Alto, reads "This is Bushshit."
One student who said he was
excited to see the start of the war
asked not to be identified, because
he worried that his comments
would be viewed as insensitive.
"I feel kind of bad, but we've
talked about this for so long that
I'm glad something's finally hap
pening," he said.
Senior Lindsay McGuire ar
gued that "diversity of opinion
gets squashed because people who
are pro-Bush and pro-war feel like
they can't voice their opin
ions ... I don't honestly know
many of the pro-war arguments,
because you just don't hear them."
Despite several anti-war events
that have been organized since
the war began, there has been no
coordinated show of support for
the war on campus since Wednes
day night.
Freshman Doug Wu contend
ed that the current lack of dia
logue stems from the fact that
there is nothing more to be done.
"Before the war started, there
was a lot of talk of whether they
should go through with it,"he
said. "Now it's just a matter of time
before we win, so it's less of a de
bate topic."
