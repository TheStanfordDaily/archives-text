# War prompts prof to delay date of exam
## 
### DEVON MAYLIE STAFF WRITER 
Worried that students would be too dis
tracted by the beginning of war in Iraq to focus
on their exams, several professors have ottered
students affected by the war the option of tak
ing their finals on alternate, later elates.
Professor Barton Bernstein from the Histo
ry Department will allow members of his class,
History 172A: The United States Since 1945,
to take the final on April 5 if the students felt
they were unable to study.
"These are unnerving days, with our nation
about to go to war," Bernstein said in an e-mail
to the class. "The TAs and I realize that many
students as a result may feel unable to concen
trate on their studies and on preparations for
final exams."
Sophomore Hal Brands decided to take the
final Thursday morning because he does not
believe professors should have provided stu
dents with the option to take the final at a later
time, at such short notice.
"I'm not bothered by the war and would
like to get my finals out of the way," Brands
said. "Most people taking advantage of the
offer simply weren't prepared for the final."
Brands estimated that about 20 people of the
80-member class chose not to take the final. .

Prof. Robert McGinn, who directs the pro
gram in Science, Technology and Society and
teaches STS 110, decided that he would offer
those students with close family or friends at
risk of being killed in the military to take the
Thursday final on Friday.
" I gave a lot of thought to the question and
canvassed my TAs about it," McGinn said. "I
decided that I would announce at the STS
final that if there was anyone in the class who
had a family member or any close friend at
risk of being killed in the military activities
being commenced, such that the student felt
disabled from concentrating [on]
studying for the final exam, that
such students should come and see
me and 1 would let them take the
exam Friday."
After extensive deliberations,
McGinn said that this was the only
reason that would persuade him to
offer a 24-hour delay in taking the
final.

"All things considered, including
tiie day of the exam in relation to the
end of finals week, the interests of
my TAs, comparative justice and the
need to get grades in by 12 noon
next Tuesday, I decided that that
would be the only 'distraction* factor
that would persuade me to offer an
alternative exam time," he said.
Professor Gary Ernst from the
Geological and Environmental Sci
ences Department was prepared to
make a similar arrangements for
students in his Earth Systems 10
class, which had its final Monday

morning. Ernst announced on
March 14 that, if war began prior to
their Monday final, he would give
them the option to take it on anoth
er day.
"Professor Ernst made an an
nouncement that, should war break
out prior to the final exam, students
would be tree to 'express their opin
ions' on the war, opinions either
way, for or against," said class mem
ber Lynda Browning, "and would
thus be allowed to miss Monday's
final and take an alternate exam on
Thursday."
