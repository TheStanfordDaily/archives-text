### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since war began on Wednesday
night, many international students
and faculty on campus voiced frus
tration about U.S. foreign policy
and anxiety about both the safety
and stability of their countries and
the changing role of foreign stu
dents in the United States.
Junior Imran Moinuddin of Pak
istan found the whole situation "up
setting" and stated that he felt "un
wanted," in spite of the support
being shown by colleagues and
friends.
"There is a lot of uncertainty and
my goal is to just survive," Moinud
din commented.
Both Moinuddin and his family
back in Pakistan are seriously wor

ried about how the war might im
pact his studies. Already, "transit in
and out of the U.S. is hard," Moin
uddin said. "As soon as I arrive, I
have to report to the State Depart
ment."
According to Mudassir Sheikha,
a second-year master's student in
computer science who is also from
Pakistan, members of the Muslim
world, "are increasingly suspicious
of American goodwill and view the
aggression as a means to capture
Middle Eastern natural resources."
Sheikha added, "I am afraid this
war is going to fuel acts of violence
aimed at American interests
throughout the world."
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, is
preparing a statement to send to in
ternational students reminding

them of the resources available on
campus and encouraging students
to contact their embassies. Pearson
added that he had already received
concerned calls from several par
ents and one embassy.
"It is hard to know what to say,"
Pearson said, "but the feeling of iso
lation is not new. There was a lot of
anxiety before and during the first
Gulf War as well."
Pearson himself was concerned
at what the effect of military action
would be on getting students from
the Middle East into, and out of, the
United States. The already compli
cated process of getting student
visas prompted Pearson to ask,
"Will military action increase the
vigilance of the Homeland Security
Office when looking at students?"
Alex Tuerpe, a junior from

Berlin, mentioned that his parents
were worried about his personal
safety. He said that he did not feel
threatened but feared that war
would "destabilize the Middle East."
Another citizen of Germany,
Asst. Music Prof. Tobias Plebuch,
said, "Germany chose not to join
this war, but not because we are
anti-America."
Plebuch said that many Ger
mans, including he and his family,
were genuinely scared about the
precedent being set by President
George W. Bush.
Other members of the interna
tional community appeared less
anxious, however. Omur Fibaner, a
second year graduate student from
Turkey, commented that he had
