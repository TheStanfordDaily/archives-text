## Ground forces enter Iraq; 16 die in helicopter crash 
### 
(AP) — American and British
combat units rumbled across the
desert into Iraq from the south
yesterday and bombed limited tar
gets in Baghdad. But military com
manders withheld the massive on
slaught that would signal all-out
war as U.S. officials tried to talk the
Iraqi regime into giving up.
Coalition forces suffered their
first casualties in a helicopter crash
that left 12 Britons and four Amer
icans dead.
On the second day of Operation
Iraqi Freedom, American officials
held out the tantalizing possibility
that Saddam had been killed in the
initial Wednesday night bombing
ofßaghdad.
State-run Iraqi television said
Saddam survived, and met with
his top aides to counter the U.S.-
led attack.
"We are resolved to teach the
criminal invaders hard lessons and
make them taste painful punish
ment," declared the Iraqi military.
The onset of war sparked anti
war demonstrations across the
country and at U.S. embassies
around the world. The State De
partment warned U.S. citizens
abroad of an increased danger of
terrorism.

Rumsfeld hinted that talks with
Iraqi military elements, including
some in the elite Republican
Guard, may have been behind a
delayed start to a planned massive
aerial assault.
"We still hope" the Iraqi leader
ship can be replaced "without the
hill force and fury of a war," Rums
feld said after meeting with law
makers on Capitol Hill.
Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J.,
said following a House briefing
with Rumsfeld that "the behavior
of those who've not surrendered
would suggest that they might."
In southern Iraq, white light
glowed in the desert sky, and the
sound of explosions could be
heard from across the Kuwait-Iraq
frontier as the 3rd Infantry Divi
sion unleashed an artillery bar
rage. Troops eager to cross the
border into Iraq cheered _ and
units were soon on their way.
Iraq sent missiles toward
Kuwait in retaliation for the pre
dawn attack against Saddam, and
American officials said the Iraqis
had set fire to some of their own oil
wells. Protecting the oil-rich Basra
region was one of the American
military's goals as forces headed
into Iraq.

U.S. troops in gas masks run for cover during one of many false alarms yesterday. Throughout northern Kuwait,
troops donned chemical weapons gear and gas masks, took them off when the all-clear was sounded, then put
them on again while four missiles hurtled in.
