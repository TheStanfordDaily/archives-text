# Stanford wins 77-69
## NCAA keeps playing 
### 
(AP) — On each of the courts
at the NCAA college basketball
tournament, large decals of a red,
white and blue ribbon were laid
down on the hardwood.
Off the court yesterday, fans
gathered in arena concourses at
halftime to watch war updates on
television, then returned to their
seats for the second half.
"Everybody's interested, but
life has to go on," said Phil Wrob
lewski, a fan from Erie, Pa., who
attended the Marquette-Holy
Cross game in Indianapolis.
On the second day of a U.S.-
led war against Iraq, games went
on around the country — in the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment, major league baseball's
spring training and other sports.
But the fighting weighed heavily
on the minds of coaches, players
and their fans.
Because of coverage of the
war, CBS shifted its first NCAA
tournament games to ESPN yes
terday; coverage returned to CBS
for the night games.
Security also was increased at
arenas all over the country. Every

person at the RCA Dome in Indi
anapolis was checked with a de
tection wand. Similar security
checks were followed at other
sports venues.
In Spokane, in the first round,
fourth-seeded Stanford defeated
No. 13 San Diego 77-69 in the
first round of the South Regional
NCAA tournament.
Matt Lottich scored 17 points
and hit a big 3-pointer with 49.7
seconds remaining, lifting Stan
ford to the win.
"I can't tell you how many 3-
point shots Lottie has made late
ly," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "He's got the guts
of a burglar ."
The Cardinal came within a
whisker of a first-round exit for
the first time since 1992. But
Stanford survived to play Satur
day against Connecticut.
Josh Childress scored 22
points and Julius Barnes had 18
for Stanford. The Cardinal blew
a 19-point first-half lead but ral
lied after San Diego went ahead
66-63 on a bank shot by Roy
Morris with 3:42 to go.
