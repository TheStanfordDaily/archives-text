LONDON (AP) —The first
shots of war set off global protests
on the streets and drew dismayed
responses from world leaders yes
terday. President Bush's main al
lies stood firmly by him as U.S.
flags burned from Berlin to
Bangladesh.
A world woven together by
satellite TV watched the opening
salvos of the war, and responses
ranged from gasoline hoarding in
Katmandu to cheers for Saddam
Hussein in Kashmir.
"The wrong decision has been
taken. The war has begun. It must
be ended as quickly as possible,"
German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, a staunch anti-war
voice, said in a televised address.
"The threat of terrorism is a
fact," said Polish President Alek
sander Kwasniewski, whose coun
try backs Bush. "The world bears
the joint responsibility and should
show solidarity in fighting terror
ism and proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction."
"Patience, patience, O Bush,
tomorrow the Muslims will dig
your grave," demonstrators

chanted in Cairo.
Oil prices jumped yesterday —
from $25.53 a barrel to $27.35 in
London — on reports that oil
wells in southern Iraq were sabo
taged and burning.
Britain and Australia, the only
nations to commit significant num
bers of troops to the U.S.-led effort,
resolutely stuck by Washington.
Protesters banged pots in
Manila and daubed "Bush, your
empire will eventually crumble"
on walls in Caracas. They stoned
the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, and
threw bricks and eggs at a local
party office of Spanish Prime Min
ister and Bush ally, Jose Maria
Aznar. In Srinagar, capital of
heavily Muslim Kashmir, school
boys watched TV footage of ex
plosions in Baghdad and cheered
when Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein appeared.
"Stupid war, mindless vio
lence," said a placard in a sea of
50,000 anti-war demonstrators
converging on Berlin's Branden
burg Gate.
Fora few, especially Iraqi ex
iles, the start of war promised bet

ter times for Iraq.
In Cairo, Faisal Fikri excitedly
channel-surfed for images of the
first explosions in Baghdad.
It was"the moment I have been
waiting for all my life — to see the
despot gone," said Fikri, who left
Iraq in 1970.
I n Sydney, Australia, protesters
snarlecl traffic holding up signs
saying "Disarm USA too." At one
point, three Iraqi Kurds pushed
to the front of the rally, holding up
pictures of a chemical weapons at
tack on the Kurdish town of Hal
abja in 1988.
"Saddam Hussein is not a per
son who should be defended,"
said Robert Ashdi, 48, who fled
northern Iraq for Australia along
with three other family members
in 1991. "I think people here
don't understand what they're
talking about."
While few protesters or gov
ernment leaders voiced sympathy
for Saddam, people worried
about ordinary Iraqis and prayed
fora quick and low-casualty war.
The pope dedicated his dawn
Mass to peace.
