### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Anticipating the recent start of
war in Iraq, University officials
have met to ensure that the
school's emergency protocol is in
place and that building and resi
dential start are aware of all rele
vant procedures. However, ad
ministrators stressed that the busi
ness of the University would pro
ceed as normal and suggested that
it is unlikely that Stanford will be
put at risk because of the war.

"In light of President Bush's an
nouncement on the pending con
flict in Iraq and the heightened
state of alert declared by the feder
al government, Stanford continues
to make the safety and security of
its students and employees its high
est priority," said a statement is
sued by the Office of the President
several hours before the United
States carried out its first strike on
Iraq. "At the same time, the Uni
versity will continue to pursue its
primary mission â€” teaching,
learning and research."

The statement added that mem
bers of the Office of Student Aff airs
and the Department of Public Safe
ty have met to ensure a quick re
sponse to any "resulting chal
lenges" and stressed the need to
maintain a thoughtful and civil di
alogue on the issues surrounding
the war in the coming weeks.
While there will not be ostensible
increases in campus security, Direc
tor of University Communications
Alan Acosta said that Stanford is "scal
ing it up a little bit" and added that
building managers are being made

aware of emergency procedures.
"We're trying to be very pru
dent and careful and yet not forget
that people have to go on with their
daily lives as well," Acosta said.
In regards to the safety of Stan
ford students abroad, Overseas
Studies released a statement ex
plaining that its officials have been
in close contact with the Universi
ty's Office of Risk Management
and do not feel that any of the over
seas programs are endangered by
the start of war.
"All Stanford Overseas Studies

Programs are currently open and
with the Stanford quarter coming
to a close this week, we anticipate
that our spring programs will open
as scheduled," the statement said.
Irene Kennedy, associate direc
tor of Overseas Studies, said that
the office has received phone calls
from worried parents and has been
dealing with them on an individual
basis.
University officials have also
been in contact with residential
staff to review emergency proce
dures and discuss ways to best fa
cilitate dialogue in the residences.
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo said that it is
impossible to anticipate what sort
of emergency the staff may need to
respond to, but said that they have
been given information on how to
deal with "emergencies of all sorts
and how it might apply to a situa
tion like this."
"I can say that we have plans on
how to deal with the loss of utilities
or house facilities [and] we have
communicated to residential staff

what role they play in identifying
the emerging needs of students
and how directly to support them
in-house," Camarillo said.
Student Affairs Officer Augie
Galvan, who works with the man
agerial staff of the Row houses,
send out an e-mail forwarded to
Row houses lists encouraging stu
dents to leave their spring break
itinerary with a family member or
friend, to take Stanford emer
gency numbers with them while
traveling and to make sure that
residences stay locked and stu
dents remain vigilant.
"As we are experiencing trying
and turbulent times with various
local and world happenings, the
Row Office wanted to provide you
with some suggestions to make

your daily life feel more ground
ed," Galvan wrote in the e-mail.
Res Ed will also focus on en
couraging constructive debate
about the war when spring quarter
commences.
"In addition, the Assistant Di
rector of Residential Education,
Josh Schiller, has shared with resi
dential staff some suggestions on
how to facilitate conversations
where students might air their
personal perspective on these
world events and foreign policy,"
Camarillo said. "We urge student
leaders to create environments
where students can engage in civic
dialogue and allow disagreement
to occur while maintaining the
ground rule of respect for differ
ent perspectives."
