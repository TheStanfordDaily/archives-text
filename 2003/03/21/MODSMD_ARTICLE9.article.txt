### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Anticipating the recent start of
war in Iraq, University officials
have met to ensure that the
school's emergency protocol is in
place and that building and resi
dential start are aware of all rele
vant procedures. However, ad
ministrators stressed that the busi
ness of the University would pro
ceed as normal and suggested that
it is unlikely that Stanford will be
put at risk because of the war.

"In light of President Bush's an
nouncement on the pending con
flict in Iraq and the heightened
state of alert declared by the feder
al government, Stanford continues
to make the safety and security of
its students and employees its high
est priority," said a statement is
sued by the Office of the President
several hours before the United
States carried out its first strike on
Iraq. "At the same time, the Uni
versity will continue to pursue its
primary mission â€” teaching,
learning and research."

The statement added that mem
bers of the Office of Student Aff airs
and the Department of Public Safe
ty have met to ensure a quick re
sponse to any "resulting chal
lenges" and stressed the need to
maintain a thoughtful and civil di
alogue on the issues surrounding
the war in the coming weeks.
While there will not be ostensible
increases in campus security, Direc
tor of University Communications
Alan Acosta said that Stanford is "scal
ing it up a little bit" and added that
building managers are being made

aware of emergency procedures.
"We're trying to be very pru
dent and careful and yet not forget
that people have to go on with their
daily lives as well," Acosta said.
In regards to the safety of Stan
ford students abroad, Overseas
Studies released a statement ex
plaining that its officials have been
in close contact with the Universi
ty's Office of Risk Management
and do not feel that any of the over
seas programs are endangered by
the start of war.
"All Stanford Overseas Studies

Programs are currently open and
with the Stanford quarter coming
to a close this week, we anticipate
that our spring programs will open
as scheduled," the statement said.
Irene Kennedy, associate direc
tor of Overseas Studies, said that
the office has received phone calls
from worried parents and has been
dealing with them on an individual
basis.
University officials have also
been in contact with residential
