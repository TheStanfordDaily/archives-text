# Allied troops advance with caution
## 
### 
(AP) — Allied soldiers inched
toward Baghdad yesterday and
pressed their campaign on a
southern redoubt of Saddam Hus
sein loyalists, trying at every turn
to gain trust from Iraqi citizens
and stay safe from those who may
be combatants in disguise.
The military campaign has in
creasingly become a confidence
building one, too, and not only in
Iraq. Yesterday, U.S. war leaders
defended their strategy as a sound
one and cast the painstaking pace
of recent days as a virtue.
"We have the power to be pa
tient in this, and we're not going to
do anything before we're ready,"
said Gen. Richard Mvers, chair

man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
U.S. and British allies report
ed increased contacts with ordi
nary Iraqis on many fronts yes
terday, a development measured
— like the march toward Bagh
dad — in wary steps.
The reason for the caution was
clear: persistent danger from
plainclothes killers and warnings
from Iraqi officials that there will
be more suicide attacks like the one
that took the lives of four Ameri
cans in Najaf. Iraqis said some
4,000 Arabs have come to Iraq to
help attack the invaders.
Airstrikes on Baghdad contin
ued into today against Iraqi leader
ship targets, command and control

centers and communications facili
ties, Pentagon officials said. A fire
was burning at the government's
Information Ministry after strikes
by Tomahawk cruise missiles.
The Army's 101st Airborne Di
vision surrounded Najaf yesterday
and was in position to begin root
ing out the paramilitary forces in
side the city, said Command Sgt.
Maj. Marvin Hill.
In Nasiriyah, where fighting
has been fierce fora week, Marines
secured buildings held by an Iraqi
infantry division that contained
large caches of weapons and chem
ical decontamination equipment.
A Marine UH-1 Huey heli
copter crashed last night at a for

ward supply and refueling point in
southern Iraq, said a spokesman,
Ist Lt. John Niemann, in Kuwait.
Three people aboard were killed
and one was injured in the crash
that occurred while the helicopter
was taking off.
Questions grew in Washington
over the war's pace.
Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller
of West Virginia said the U.S.-led
invasion is clearly facing more Iraqi
resistance than anticipated and the
war plan will probably have to be
adjusted to deal with that.
"1 consider them not to be triv
ial setbacks," he said on CNN's
"Late Edition," but rather "in the
category of major problems."
Gen. Tommy Franks, the coali
tion commander, said: "One never
knows how long a war will take."
Secretary of State Colin Powell
sought to allay concern about the
war's progress in an evening
speech to the American Israel Pub
lic Affairs Committee, expressing
"total confidence in the plan and
total confidence in General Franks
and those carrying out the plan."
"Let there be no doubt of the
outcome," he said. "We will drive
Saddam Hussein and his regime
from power."
Close to 100,000 U.S. service
members are in Iraq, supported by
about 200,000 in the theater and
with 100,000 more on the way.
U.S. officials said coalition
ground forces were closing in on
Baghdad from the south, west and
north — the southern front lines
now 49 miles from the capital.
Myers said airstrikes have reduced
some units of the Republican
Guard, Saddam's best-trained
forces, to less than half their pre
war capacity.
British troops moved into vil
lages on the fringes of Basra, the
southern city where an outnum
bered but tough core of Saddam
loyalists have held off the coalition
for about a week.

Panicky and crying Iraqi civilians trying to leave Basra, Iraq, flee a checkpoint yesterday after shots were fired toward
the crowd by Iraqi soldiers about 1 /2 mile away. The refugees had been held up at a checkpoint manned by British
troops screening the crowd when the shooting erupted. Most were leaving Basra to head further south toward the
Kuwaiti border and some said they wanted to cross into Kuwait to seek refuge.
