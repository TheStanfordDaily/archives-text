NETANYA, Israel (AP) — A
Palestinian suicide bomber
wounded 30 people outside a
packed cafe in northern Israel yes
terday, an attack the Islamic Jihad
called "Palestine's gilt to the heroic
people of Iraq." The blast raised
Israeli Hears of more bombings as
the war in Iraq intensifies.
The militant group said a van
guard of Palestinians has arrived

in Baghdad ready to kill American
and British soldiers in suicide mis
sions. The claim came a day after a
noncommissioned Iraqi army offi
cer driving a taxi detonated explo
sives at a U.S. checkpoint in Iraq,
killing himself and four American
soldiers.
The blast in the coastal town of
Netanya was the first suicide
bombing in Israel in nearly a

month and involved live pounds
of explosives studded with nails. It
occurred during lunchtime out
side the popular Cafe London on
the downtown pedestrian mall.
Ten of the wounded were Is
raeli soldiers, including one who
stopped the attacker as he tried to
enter the cafe, police and the army
said. Panicked customers ran,
overturning chairs and tables and
shouting, "Terrorist! Terrorist!"
Islamic Jihad identified the
bomber as Rami Ghanem, 20,
from a West Bank village just
across the porous line with Israel.
The bombing affirmed "the unity
of battle from Palestine to Bagh
dad in confronting the American-
Zionist invasion which targets the
entire Arab and Islamic nation,"
the group said in a statement.
The militants' support for Iraq
appeared be a departure from

pledges not to get involved in
other conflicts. In the past 30
months of fighting with Israel, Is
lamic Jihad and its sister group
Hamas have sent dozens of suicide
bonbers.
Hamas also appeared to link
the battle against Israel with the
lighting in Iraq. Masked Hamas
activists at a pro-Iraq march in the
West Bank city of Nablus yester
day posed before a large placard
showing bloodied maps of Pales
tine and Iraq with a black-clad
man strapped with explosives
standing between them.
Yesterday's attack was the first
suicide bombing in Israel since
March 5, when 17 Israelis were
killed in a bus blast in the northern
port city of Haifa.
Earlier, an army patrol in Gaza
shot and killed a Palestinian who
was in an off-limits area.
