Editors Note: This editorial first appeared in our
special issue, "Students react to war," on March 21.
We are publishing this piece fora second time be
cause many members of the Stanford community may
not have seen the special issue since it came out dur
ing the last day of finals week.
President George W. Bush's deci
sion to declare war against Iraq is
an international embarrassment
and a diplomatic mistake.
In his address to the nation on Wednes
day, the president did not convince the
public that his actions were necessary. A
peaceful resolution in the Middle East still
could have been attained, if the president
had been more patient and more willing
to listen to the suggestions of the United
Nations.
But he chose war instead.
We are disappointed by his decision.

But we as a commu
nity still have a moral
obligation to change
our current situa
tion. And we have a
duty to make sure
this kind of reason

In his address to
the nation, Bush

boasted that the people of New York are
behind the president and supportive of
the war. Yet across the country, many are
voicing their skepticism of a connection
between the Sept. 11 assault on the
World Trade Center and the current in
vasion.
Most disturbingly, the media has all but
ignored these voices and has both under
estimated and underreported the
strength of anti-war activism, while em
powering those protesters more commit
ted to confrontation than peace. The ego
mania and lust for attention of a few status
seekers and political opportunists have
alienated many potential allies from the
vast, meritorious anti-war movement.
Now that the drama of war is the mar
quee act, this same media has quickly
shifted into commentary on military strat

Bush put the burden of success on the
men and women now stationed in the
Middle East, claiming the nation "de

warm beds and writing papers and final
exams. But we cannot bury our noses in

We need to participate in our democracy,
however misguided it may be.
More than 100 members of the com
munity did that in a very public way at a
protest in San Francisco on March 20. Stu
dents and professors missed finals and
stood up for their beliefs.
Tomorrow marks the first day of spring
break, and while students should enjoy
the week off, they cannot forget about the
gravity of these times or the great disap
pointment that looms in the air.
Many members of the Stanford com
munity already hold or will go on to hold
influential and important posts in govern
ment, law, politics and business. They
must monitor the U.S. government's ac
tions carefully and take note of the re
sponse from the rest of the world.
This war is already a failure that cannot
be repeated. In the months to come, we
will live through the second gulf war of
our generation.
There cannot be a third.
