# LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Nobody wants to be lonely 
### 
The warm sun gently filters
in through your window,
waking you to another
glorious morning of
spring quarter, and you're next to
that hottie from the party last night.
Sure, you don't know which
dorm you are in or where your al
cohol-soaked pants are, but noth
ing beats the feeling of having the
stereotypical college hook-up.
If the above scenario sounds like
something you would like to expe
rience— and we hope it does —
be grateful it's spring quarter be
cause opportunities for hooking
up abound. Spring has always been
a time of romance and amusement
for people of all cultures, but Stan
ford students seem especially fond
of keeping with this seasonal pat
tern. But why is student debauch
ery about to skyrocket?
The reasons, like your hook
up options, are numerous. Every
year, college students from all
over the United States congregate
for amazing spring break adven
tures in exotic lands where they
engage in some pretty scandalous
activities, typically involving the
universal cure for inhibition: alco
hol. Coming off of such a rush
must carry over into the school
year as people try to recreate the
magic in their own dorm rooms
and at parties.
Speaking of rush, spring quar
ter is when fraternities and sorori
ties engage in their perennial com
petition to attract new pledge class
es of social, fun-loving youth to re
place their outgoing seniors.
There are great parties that
Greek organizations throw to en
tice potential pledges and then
there are even better parties that
ensue once the pledges are around
to do the clean-up. These gather
ings provide the perfect context
Stanford students need to foster
budding romance and indulge
raging hormones (we highly rec
ommend you attend if you have
not yet had the pleasure).
Even if you are not an avid par
tygoer, Rushing and pledging can
be very titillating for the whole cam

pus when events involving nudity
take place in the public domain.
No conversation involving nu
dity would be complete without
mentioning one of Stanford's
most infamous parties: Exotic-
Erotic. This annual party, held at
680 Lomita, has even gained
some national notoriety (it was
mentioned in Cosmo). Only dur
ing spring quarter would there

be a party where the dress code
mandates a maximum of two arti
cles of clothing to enter a house
decorated entirely with porno
graphic material. With these
kinds of social opportunities, is it
really so surprising that more
people get it on during the last
nine weeks of the year?
But parties in and of themselves
do not cause people to behave
more loosely. There are psycho
logical factors — which happen to
coincide with hotter weather,
shorter hemlines and lighter
course loads — that enable stu
dents to let down their guard and
get to know each other better.
At the very beginning of spring
quarter ASSU elections take place,
converting mild mannered stu
dents into cutthroat candidates.
What goes better with aspiring
politicians than sex and scandal?
These members of our community
are out on a quest for fame, power
and control over . . . wait, what
does the ASSU do again? Give out
newspapers? Make statements on
affirmative action?
Umm, anyway, as we were say
ing, as students on the campaign
trail yearn to recreate themselves
in the images of their political
heroes they tend to pick up their
sexual vices, wanting to kiss babies
and then some.

The aforementioned factors pro
vide students with more opportuni
ties to satiate their lustful desires, but
romantic interludes also tend to be
of shorter duration during spring
quarter. The trend seems to be that
in the fall quarter, people look for
serious relationships because they
are ready to start a new year with
goals and high aspirations.
In winter quarter, people shut
their doors, buckle down and
study, almost in anticipation of the
spring. By April, people are ready
for some interaction in the form of
short-term rendezvous. There is no
point in looking for anything per
manent in the spring, since even
the most solid couples face difficul
ties maintaining their relationships
during the summer. To this end,
there is an upward surge of women
and men willing to get a taste of the
"purely for fun" hook-up.
There is also a "top-down" ef
fect. As seniors prepare to bid a
fond farewell to undergraduate
life, they may still feel the urge for
a last hurrah, one last chance for
fun in an environment teeming
with young vulnerable prey. Or
maybe it's just time to make up for
three and two-thirds years of
spending too much time on pre
med classes and not enough time
on actual people.
As a result, some upperclass
men engage in competitions and
quotas to challenge themselves to
participate in the Stanford social
scene. It is not too shocking that
competitive students stick to these
arrangements and the result is
more play for everyone.
There might not be a typical
dating scene at Stanford, but who
cares? In the spring, nothing
should stop people from sampling
what is available to them within
our community. The only down
side is that it happens most fre
quently during the shortest quar
ter of the year.

Too busy protesting the war to get any
play? Sucks [or you, but don't complain
to us: eym@stanford.edu and ak
endall@stanford.edu.

The warm sun gently filters
in through your window,
waking you to another
glorious morning of
spring quarter, and you're next to
that hottie from the party last night.
Sure, you don't know which
dorm you are in or where your al
cohol-soaked pants are, but noth
ing beats the feeling of having the
stereotypical college hook-up.
If the above scenario sounds like
something you would like to expe
rience— and we hope it does —
be grateful it's spring quarter be
cause opportunities for hooking
up abound. Spring has always been
a time of romance and amusement
for people of all cultures, but Stan
ford students seem especially fond
of keeping with this seasonal pat
tern. But why is student debauch
ery about to skyrocket?
The reasons, like your hook
up options, are numerous. Every
year, college students from all
over the United States congregate
for amazing spring break adven
tures in exotic lands where they
engage in some pretty scandalous
activities, typically involving the
universal cure for inhibition: alco
hol. Coming off of such a rush
must carry over into the school
year as people try to recreate the
magic in their own dorm rooms
and at parties.
Speaking of rush, spring quar
ter is when fraternities and sorori
ties engage in their perennial com
petition to attract new pledge class
es of social, fun-loving youth to re
place their outgoing seniors.
There are great parties that
Greek organizations throw to en
tice potential pledges and then
there are even better parties that
ensue once the pledges are around
to do the clean-up. These gather
ings provide the perfect context
Stanford students need to foster
budding romance and indulge
raging hormones (we highly rec
ommend you attend if you have
not yet had the pleasure).
Even if you are not an avid par
tygoer, Rushing and pledging can
be very titillating for the whole cam

pus when events involving nudity
take place in the public domain.
No conversation involving nu
dity would be complete without
mentioning one of Stanford's
most infamous parties: Exotic-
Erotic. This annual party, held at
680 Lomita, has even gained
some national notoriety (it was
mentioned in Cosmo). Only dur
ing spring quarter would there

be a party where the dress code
mandates a maximum of two arti
cles of clothing to enter a house
decorated entirely with porno
graphic material. With these
kinds of social opportunities, is it
really so surprising that more
people get it on during the last
nine weeks of the year?
But parties in and of themselves
do not cause people to behave
more loosely. There are psycho
logical factors — which happen to
coincide with hotter weather,
shorter hemlines and lighter
course loads — that enable stu
dents to let down their guard and
get to know each other better.
At the very beginning of spring
quarter ASSU elections take place,
converting mild mannered stu
dents into cutthroat candidates.
What goes better with aspiring
politicians than sex and scandal?
These members of our community
are out on a quest for fame, power
and control over . . . wait, what
does the ASSU do again? Give out
newspapers? Make statements on
affirmative action?
Umm, anyway, as we were say
ing, as students on the campaign
trail yearn to recreate themselves
in the images of their political
heroes they tend to pick up their
sexual vices, wanting to kiss babies
and then some.

The aforementioned factors pro
vide students with more opportuni
ties to satiate their lustful desires, but
romantic interludes also tend to be
of shorter duration during spring
quarter. The trend seems to be that
in the fall quarter, people look for
serious relationships because they
are ready to start a new year with
goals and high aspirations.
In winter quarter, people shut
their doors, buckle down and
study, almost in anticipation of the
spring. By April, people are ready
for some interaction in the form of
short-term rendezvous. There is no
point in looking for anything per
manent in the spring, since even
the most solid couples face difficul
ties maintaining their relationships
during the summer. To this end,
there is an upward surge of women
and men willing to get a taste of the
"purely for fun" hook-up.
There is also a "top-down" ef
fect. As seniors prepare to bid a
fond farewell to undergraduate
life, they may still feel the urge for
a last hurrah, one last chance for
fun in an environment teeming
with young vulnerable prey. Or
maybe it's just time to make up for
three and two-thirds years of
spending too much time on pre
med classes and not enough time
on actual people.
As a result, some upperclass
men engage in competitions and
quotas to challenge themselves to
participate in the Stanford social
scene. It is not too shocking that
competitive students stick to these
arrangements and the result is
more play for everyone.
There might not be a typical
dating scene at Stanford, but who

should stop people from sampling

side is that it happens most fre
quently during the shortest quar
ter of the year.
