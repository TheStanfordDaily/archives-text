The Daily special issue "blatantly biased'
The special issue of The Stanford Daily
(March 21) was an insult. Not only did The
Daily fail to acknowledge the pro-Bush
side of the war, but The Daily also glorified
the anti-war side. Every opinion piece that
The Daily published in that issue was prac
tically one step to the left of Barbra
Streisand.
In drawing parallels between Bush and
Captain Ahab and glorifying the deleteri
ous tactics of many anti-war protesters (ac
cording to news reports, one of them either
fell or jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge
a few weeks ago), The Daily has managed
to further alienate any and all conserva
tives or moderates on this campus.
I am firmly disappointed in The Daily
for being so blatantly biased. I would expect
that students intelligent and bright enough
to edit our newspaper, which in many ways
is a reflection of our University and student
body, would sec to it that the school motto
of "the wind of freedom blows" would be
followed. I would expect that the Daily staff

would hold the spirit of the school's motto,
of fair dialogue and discussion, ahead of the
selfish desires of its members to proliferate
its anti-war opinions.
I know fora fact that opinion pieces
representing the conservative ("pro-war,"
a term that I hate because it makes us
sound like a bunch of bloodthirsty ass
holes) side of the issue were submitted. I'm
utterly disappointed that The Daily was
unable to find room fora single one of
these within its contents.
I he>pe that someday I will be able to open
ITie Daily and possibly get educated on both
sides, rather than just getting an earful of
just one side of a very complicated issue.

Editors Note: When it became apparent that the
United States was going to war with Iraq, The
Daily staff started making plans to publish a spe
cial section that would chronicle the Stanford
community's reactions to war.
At the beginning of finals week, several edi
tors e-mailed students from various student
groups, including those that have, stated support
for the war, seeking responses. The staff selected
pieces for publication that were well-written,
timely and representative of all the submissions.

In the weeks to come, The Daily will continue to
welcome perspectives from all members of the
Stanford community.

The Daily should include opposing
viewpoints on opinions pages
The Stanford Daily, always leaning to
the left, has finally lost all relevance to the
American political situation. The liberal
tendencies The Daily has displayed dur
ing the past year and a half have never
been disguised, but until the past few
months The Daily had at least a semblance
of fairness. The issues of The Daily leading
up to the U.S. war with Iraq, and the spe
cial edition on students' reaction to the
war, however, have destroyed any faith I
may have had in this publication.
Where were the opposing viewpoints?
The editorial pages are written by vehe
mently anti-war writers. One editorial
called this war "an embarrassment"
(March 21). Call the war what you will, but
The Daily is the true embarrassment. Stan
ford, as one of the world's elite academic in
stitutions, deserves a decent paper, one
that is not completely dominated by an all
too-transparent partisan agenda.

I'm tired of being embarrassed by the fact
that my school can't put out a paper with any
kind of political balance. I recognize the right
of the editorial staff to write their beliefs, but
how about something for the part of the Stan
ford population that doesn't idolize Henry
Wallace or think that all our problems would
be solved if Nancy Pelosi became president?
As the major paper at Stanford, The
Daily can be an influential publication. At
present, unfortunately, it simply cannot be
taken seriously. Even those anti-war agita
tors, whose souls are soothed by the daily
affirmation that is our student paper, must
realize that it is pushing itself farther out on
the fringe of American politics. The Daily
will only be relevant when it drops the
overarching bias from its news pieces and
gives opposing voices a say in the editorial
pages. The unbelievable partiality of this
volume of The Daily reeks to high heaven.

In response to war,
an alternative to fasting
I read, with respect, Dean of Religious

Life Scotty McLennan's column urging
prayer and fasting in response to the on
going war in Iraq ("Turn now to prayer,
fasting" March 21). I'm writing to offer a
counterpoint to the proposal of fasting.
I think that U.S. residents' and corpo
rations' use of gasoline, oil and electricity
and other products generated by these re
sources, is the category of consumption
that is most spotlighted by this conflict.
Now there is a prime opportunity to
show respect and value for the sacrifices
ongoing in Iraq by conserving the key
physical commodity at stake there. Per
haps, had St. Augustine lived in the day of
petroleum combustion, he could have
seen such a sacrifice as akin to fasting.
Beyond the temporary sacrifice that
would be analogous to fasting, people in
this country could choose to change
their — and their organizations' — habits
in order to reduce substantially the use —
the waste — of these commodities. Sacri
fices would be necessary, but many bene
fits could ensue, from the spiritual and
symbolic to those of personal and environ
mental health and even national security.
