## Gophers end home-win streak for women 
### NATHAN KURZ EDITORIAL STAFF 
There was no reason for Nicole
Powell to stick around last Monday.
You don't celebrate your team's
third consecutive early flameout in
the NCAA Tournament.
Shortly after the buzzer blared,
Powelljust started jogging. Jogging,
with her arms pushing forward and
a solemn look on her face, until she
was inside another disappointed
locker room.
Her third-seeded and ninth
ranked Stanford Cardinal had just
been upset 68-56 by Minnesota, a
pesky team from the Big Ten who
hadn't shown anything of late to dis
tress Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer. The Gophers lost in the
first round of their conference tour
nament to a mediocre lowa squad
which was 6-10 in conference play.
That's what makes the NCAA
Tournament so different. There's
no such thing as a bellwether, really.
Play one bad game, and you're out.
And that's what Stanford (27-5,
15-3 Pacific-10 Conference) did.
The Cardinal has lost in the sec
ond round of the tournament or
earlier for the fifth time in the last six
years.
Gone was the comfort of home
which was supposed to help the
young Cardinal team settle down
during the pressure-packed situa
tions of the NCAA's first four
rounds.
Gone was the team's 26-game
Maples Pavilion winning streak, the
second-longest such streak in the
nation behind that of Connecticut.

Most of all, gone was yet another
chance for Powell to do what other
Ail-Americans before her like Jen
nifer Azzi and Kate Starbird had
done in a Stanford uniform: lead
their team to the Final Four.
Stanford hasn't been there since
1997, and many insiders believed
that with the once-in-a-life-chance
of not playing any road games in (he
tournament before the Promised
land, this presented the Cardinal's
best chance in years.
The silver lining here, of course,
is that the Cardinal will return
everyone. Everyone, including Ms.
Triple-Double herself. Powell will
get one last crack at tf lat elusive goal
before splitting for the WNBA.
That wasn't much solace for her
after the latest loss, however.
"I'm extremely disappointed in
the way we played," Powell said.
"We blew it. We let a huge opportu
nity get away and we're never going
to get it back."
She's right. Stanford will never
get the chance back. The NCAA will
change its rules next year so that no
team hosting a sub-regional may
host a regional, too.
So how did it happen? How did
a team which hadn't lost for nearly a
year and a half on its home court
abruptly have its season derailed?
Stanford's offensive execution,
plain and simple, was porous. The
Cardinal went several long stretches
without making a field goal and
seemed rattled and jittery at times
when handling the ball, leading to
14 turnovers.
