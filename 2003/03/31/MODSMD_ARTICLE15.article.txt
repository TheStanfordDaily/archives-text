## Gophers end home-win streak for women 
### NATHAN KURZ EDITORIAL STAFF 
There was no reason for Nicole
Powell to stick around last Monday.
You don't celebrate your team's
third consecutive early flameout in
the NCAA Tournament.
Shortly after the buzzer blared,
Powelljust started jogging. Jogging,
with her arms pushing forward and
a solemn look on her face, until she
was inside another disappointed
locker room.
Her third-seeded and ninth
ranked Stanford Cardinal had just
been upset 68-56 by Minnesota, a
pesky team from the Big Ten who
hadn't shown anything of late to dis
tress Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer. The Gophers lost in the
first round of their conference tour
nament to a mediocre lowa squad
which was 6-10 in conference play.
That's what makes the NCAA
Tournament so different. There's
no such thing as a bellwether, really.
Play one bad game, and you're out.
And that's what Stanford (27-5,
15-3 Pacific-10 Conference) did.
The Cardinal has lost in the sec
ond round of the tournament or
earlier for the fifth time in the last six
years.
Gone was the comfort of home
which was supposed to help the
young Cardinal team settle down
during the pressure-packed situa
tions of the NCAA's first four
rounds.
Gone was the team's 26-game
Maples Pavilion winning streak, the
second-longest such streak in the
nation behind that of Connecticut.

Most of all, gone was yet another
chance for Powell to do what other
Ail-Americans before her like Jen
nifer Azzi and Kate Starbird had
done in a Stanford uniform: lead
their team to the Final Four.
Stanford hasn't been there since
1997, and many insiders believed
that with the once-in-a-life-chance
of not playing any road games in (he
tournament before the Promised
land, this presented the Cardinal's
best chance in years.
The silver lining here, of course,
is that the Cardinal will return
everyone. Everyone, including Ms.
Triple-Double herself. Powell will
get one last crack at tf lat elusive goal
before splitting for the WNBA.
That wasn't much solace for her
after the latest loss, however.
"I'm extremely disappointed in
the way we played," Powell said.
"We blew it. We let a huge opportu
nity get away and we're never going
to get it back."
She's right. Stanford will never
get the chance back. The NCAA will
change its rules next year so that no
team hosting a sub-regional may
host a regional, too.
So how did it happen? How did
a team which hadn't lost for nearly a
year and a half on its home court
abruptly have its season derailed?
Stanford's offensive execution,
plain and simple, was porous. The
Cardinal went several long stretches
without making a field goal and
seemed rattled and jittery at times
when handling the ball, leading to
14 turnovers.


MARK SCHRUMPF/The Stanford Daily
Junior Nicole Powell finished two assists short of her sixth career triple-double as Minnesota
knocked the third-seeded Cardinal out of the NCAA tourney at Maples Pavilion.
"We had only six assists, and I
think that's the most telling statis
tic," VanDerveer said. "We strug
gled to run any kind of an offense.
"I think we had some great indi
vidual eftorts on defense, but when
you don't score, it's really hard.
There was no flow offensively ever."
The presence of Minnesota cen
ter Janel McCarville seemed to
bother the Cardinal all night.
Though the stat sheet shows Mc-
Carville had only one block, her big
body in the paint forced Stanford
players to setde for jump shots on
the perimeter instead of driving the
ball inside.
That Powell spent almost as
much time on the bench as on the
court (or so it seemed) was another
probable explanation for Stanford's
deficient offensive performance.
The junior Ail-American picked
up her third foul with 2:19 to go in
the first half, with Stanford leading
29-27. From there, the Gophers
took the lead for good and headed
into the locker room with a 31-29
advantage.
The Cardinal hadn't trailed at
halftime since its second Pac-10
game of the season, a game in which
Stanford was down 38-33 to Arizona
at the break.
Minnesota wasjust as hot as Stan
ford was cold to start the second
half. The Cardinal missed its first
four shots — adding a turnover as
well to round out five consecutive
unproductive possessions — as the
Gophers began to stretch their lead
out.
And when McCarville dumped
in a bucket down low with 15:29 re
maining, Stanford trailed 39-29.
Things seemed even more omi
nous when Powell picked up her
fourth foul five minutes later and
was sent to the bench for the next six

minutes.
But the most unlikely of heroes
seemed to step forward —if only
fora few minutes.
Sophomore guard Sebnem
Kimyacioglu, who has struggled
with Ijouts of inconsistency with her
shot in the second half of the season,
poured in seven Cardinal points as
the Gophers could only manage a
free throw.
Once sophomore center TNae
Thiel knocked down a 3-pointer
from the top of the key with 7:23
left, Stanford trailed 50-49.
The Gophers yet again stretched
the lead out —this time to nine
points at 58-49 — before Kimya
cioglu, who finished with 14 points
off the bench, converted a remark
able four-point play to cut the lead
to five with 2:32 remaining.
Ultimately, Stanford would
never get closer than four as Min
nesota's Corrin Van Wald convert
ed six free throws in the final minute
to seal the victory.
The Gophers were paced by Van
Wald's 19 points, but boasted a bal
anced attack reminiscent of Stan
ford's offensive makeup early in the
season. Three other players scored
in double-figures for Minnesota:
Lindsay Whalen (13 points), Shan
non Schonrock (12) and Kadidja
Andersson (11).
Powell finished with 19 points,
seven rebounds, two assists and two
steals in only 31 minutes.
Not bad numbers for any Aver
age Jane, but an off-night compared
to her performance in Stanford's
82-66 first round victory over West
ern Michigan.
In that game the junior finished
two assists shy of her sixth-career
triple-double and had 21 points and
10 rebounds as the Cardinal
seemed to shake-ofT all the cobwebs
from its 12-day break from games.
But the spider of defeat bit Stan
ford two days later and left the ail
too familiar malaise of an early
round NCA\exit.

Carville had only one block, her big
body in the paint forced Stanford
players to setde for jump shots on
the perimeter instead of driving the
ball inside.
That Powell spent almost as
much time on the bench as on the
court (or so it seemed) was another
probable explanation for Stanford's
deficient offensive performance.
The junior Ail-American picked
up her third foul with 2:19 to go in
the first half, with Stanford leading
29-27. From there, the Gophers
took the lead for good and headed
into the locker room with a 31-29
advantage.
The Cardinal hadn't trailed at
halftime since its second Pac-10
game of the season, a game in which
Stanford was down 38-33 to Arizona
at the break.
Minnesota wasjust as hot as Stan
ford was cold to start the second
half. The Cardinal missed its first
four shots — adding a turnover as
well to round out five consecutive
unproductive possessions — as the
Gophers began to stretch their lead
out.
And when McCarville dumped
in a bucket down low with 15:29 re
maining, Stanford trailed 39-29.
Things seemed even more omi
nous when Powell picked up her
fourth foul five minutes later and
was sent to the bench for the next six

minutes.
But the most unlikely of heroes
seemed to step forward —if only
fora few minutes.
Sophomore guard Sebnem
Kimyacioglu, who has struggled
with Ijouts of inconsistency with her
shot in the second half of the season,
poured in seven Cardinal points as
the Gophers could only manage a
free throw.
Once sophomore center TNae
Thiel knocked down a 3-pointer
from the top of the key with 7:23
left, Stanford trailed 50-49.
The Gophers yet again stretched
the lead out —this time to nine
points at 58-49 — before Kimya
cioglu, who finished with 14 points
off the bench, converted a remark
able four-point play to cut the lead
to five with 2:32 remaining.
Ultimately, Stanford would
never get closer than four as Min
nesota's Corrin Van Wald convert
ed six free throws in the final minute
to seal the victory.
The Gophers were paced by Van
Wald's 19 points, but boasted a bal
anced attack reminiscent of Stan
ford's offensive makeup early in the
season. Three other players scored
in double-figures for Minnesota:
Lindsay Whalen (13 points), Shan
non Schonrock (12) and Kadidja
Andersson (11).
Powell finished with 19 points,
seven rebounds, two assists and two
steals in only 31 minutes.
Not bad numbers for any Aver
age Jane, but an off-night compared
to her performance in Stanford's
82-66 first round victory over West
ern Michigan.
In that game the junior finished
two assists shy of her sixth-career
triple-double and had 21 points and
10 rebounds as the Cardinal
seemed to shake-ofT all the cobwebs
from its 12-day break from games.
But the spider of defeat bit Stan
ford two days later and left the ail
too familiar malaise of an early
round NCA\exit.
There was no reason for Nicole
Powell to stick around last Monday.
You don't celebrate your team's
third consecutive early flameout in
the NCAA Tournament.
Shortly after the buzzer blared,
Powelljust started jogging. Jogging,
with her arms pushing forward and
a solemn look on her face, until she
was inside another disappointed
locker room.
Her third-seeded and ninth
ranked Stanford Cardinal had just
been upset 68-56 by Minnesota, a
pesky team from the Big Ten who
hadn't shown anything of late to dis
tress Cardinal coach Tara Van-
Derveer. The Gophers lost in the
first round of their conference tour
nament to a mediocre lowa squad
which was 6-10 in conference play.
That's what makes the NCAA
Tournament so different. There's
no such thing as a bellwether, really.
Play one bad game, and you're out.
And that's what Stanford (27-5,
15-3 Pacific-10 Conference) did.
The Cardinal has lost in the sec
ond round of the tournament or
earlier for the fifth time in the last six
years.
Gone was the comfort of home
which was supposed to help the
young Cardinal team settle down
during the pressure-packed situa
tions of the NCAA's first four
rounds.
Gone was the team's 26-game
Maples Pavilion winning streak, the
second-longest such streak in the
nation behind that of Connecticut.

Most of all, gone was yet another
chance for Powell to do what other
Ail-Americans before her like Jen
nifer Azzi and Kate Starbird had
done in a Stanford uniform: lead
their team to the Final Four.
Stanford hasn't been there since
1997, and many insiders believed
that with the once-in-a-life-chance
of not playing any road games in (he
tournament before the Promised
land, this presented the Cardinal's
best chance in years.
The silver lining here, of course,
is that the Cardinal will return
everyone. Everyone, including Ms.
Triple-Double herself. Powell will
get one last crack at tf lat elusive goal
before splitting for the WNBA.
That wasn't much solace for her
after the latest loss, however.
"I'm extremely disappointed in
the way we played," Powell said.
"We blew it. We let a huge opportu
nity get away and we're never going
to get it back."
She's right. Stanford will never
get the chance back. The NCAA will
change its rules next year so that no
team hosting a sub-regional may
host a regional, too.
So how did it happen? How did
a team which hadn't lost for nearly a
year and a half on its home court
abruptly have its season derailed?
Stanford's offensive execution,
plain and simple, was porous. The
Cardinal went several long stretches
without making a field goal and
seemed rattled and jittery at times
when handling the ball, leading to
14 turnovers.

Junior Nicole Powell finished two assists short of her sixth career triple-double as Minnesota
knocked the third-seeded Cardinal out of the NCAA tourney at Maples Pavilion.
"We had only six assists, and I
think that's the most telling statis
tic," VanDerveer said. "We strug
gled to run any kind of an offense.
"I think we had some great indi
vidual eftorts on defense, but when
you don't score, it's really hard.
There was no flow offensively ever."
