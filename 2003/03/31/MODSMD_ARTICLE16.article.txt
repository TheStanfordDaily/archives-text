# Women end season at No. 6
## 
### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three days of fierce competition at t he
NCAA Championships in Auburn, Ala.,
landed the Stanford women's swimming
and diving team in unfamiliar territory:
sixth place.
The 12 competing Cardinal athletes
turned heads throughout the weekend
with their intense drive and impressive
performances, but eventually five teams —
including host Auburn, which won its sec
ond-straight national championship —
outdid the Stanford team.
Stanford finished the first day of com
petition at the James K. Martin Aquatic

Center in fifth place, with 81.5 points.
The most notable contributor to that
score was a fourth-place finish overall in
the 400-yard medley relay. Junior Tara
Kirk, sophomores Lacey Boutwell and
Amy Wagner, and freshman Dana Kirk
clocked in at 3 minutes, 35.16 seconds, a
season-best time for theteam. The Auburn
relay team won the event, breaking the
American record that Boutwell, Tara
Kirk, Wagner, and Stanford alum Shelly
Ripple set in last year's Championships.
The Card had a second relay team
make it to the finals when Boutwell, junior
Megan Baumgartner, sophomore Sarah

Infielder Tobin Swope equaled a career-high 3 RBIs against No. 24 Washington.
Jones, and freshman Ashley Daly
clinched a sixth-place finish with
their season-best time of 1:31.15 in
the 200 freestyle relay, but it was the
Georgia team that took home the
event title.
Stanford had five swimmers en
tered in the 200 individual medley,
and freshman Kristen Caverly led
the group by winning the consola
tion final, which gave her an overall
finish of ninth place. Auburn's Mag
gie Bowen set a new pool record
and won her third-straight title in
the event.
Boutwell competed in the 50
free and touched the wall with a
time of 22.96, good enough for
12th place.
As a result of their finishes at
NCAA Zone meets, two Cardinal
divers made the road trip to
Auburn: senior McKenze Murphy
and sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal.
Rosenthal worked her way into the
finals in Thursday's one-meter con
test and finished in eighth place.
Murphy garnered All-America
honors with her 16th place finish in
the event.
"There's a lot of talent here; the
competition was very tough."
Rosenthal said. "I felt I could have
been a little more relaxed, but I felt
good overall."
As some speculated that Stan

ford might place out of the top
three (which hasn't happened in 22
years), the Cardinal came roaring
back and raced into third place
overall behind Auburn and Geor
gia by the end of Friday's events.
Tara Kirk led the way for Stan
ford, posting the team's first win of
the meet. Kirk won the 100 breast
stroke with a time of 58.62, a new
NCAA meet record, and she also
boosted her undefeated collegiate
streak in the event to 27.
Though she was aiming to break
her own American record, Kirk
and her team were thrilled with the
win.
"She is consistent and strong,
loves the event and races it so well,"
said Stanford coach Richard Quick,
" I'm really proud of her."
Kirk also teamed up with sister
Dana Kirk, Wagner and Jones to
finish second in the 200 medley
relay with a season-best time of
1:38.42, behind the record-break
ing Tiger relay team.
Two freshmen Cardinal swim
mers finished an impressive sixth in
the finals in the second day of
events: Caverly in the 400 IM and
Dana Kirk in the 100 butterfly.
The Cardinal 800 free relay
team entered the event seeded 19th
out of 20 teams, but Boutwell,
Caverly, Daly and the younger Kirk
surprised everyone by pulling out
an eighth place finish.
Daly, the anchor for the race,
said that the event was exciting for
the team since they hadn't expected

to place at all. She said that hearing
the encouragement from her team
was what pushed them to swim
faster.
"You can always hear coach
Quick screaming, that's for sure,"
Daly noted.
Wagner and sophomore
Kirsten Gilbert each placed well in
the day's consolation finals for the
100 back and 100 breast, respec
tively. Wagner took 13th, while
Gilbert posted a career-best time
to secure 14th.
Rosenthal dove well to make
her way to the finals in the three
meter springboard. Alter a slow
start in the event, she turned out a
beautiful final dive and clinched
seventh place in the event, captur
ing her second All-American
honor of the meet. Teammate
Murphy finished in 30th place for
the event.
On the last day of the champi
onships, Stanford met with prob
lems as not enough athletes quali
fied for the finals.
But there were some eye-open
ing performances put in on the day,
the highlight of which was Tara
Kirk's race in the 200 breast.
"I'm really excited for Tara,"
said sister Dana before the race,
"Whenever the pressure's on Tara
she seems to pull through."
The elder Kirk lived up to all ex
pectations by winning the event
with a time 0f2:08.79, claiming her
ninth NCAA Championship title.
Boutwell swam in an incredibly

competitive 100 free race, and came
in fifth with a time 0f49.32 in the fi
nals. The winner of the event,
Georgia's Maritza Correia, set a
new American record for the race.
Boutwell also swam a leg of the
Stanford 400 free relay team and
with teammates Daly, Jones, and
Baumgartner placed seventh with a

time of 3:20.79.
Dana Kirk won the consolation
final in the 200 fly, putting her in
ninth place overall in the event.
Caverly matched her top time in
the 200 breast, as she took 11th in
the race.
In the end, the feats of the Car
dinal were not enough to match the

top five teams: Auburn, Georgia,
Southern California, Southern
Methodist and Florida.
"We're not satisfied with sixth, in
fact we wouldn't be satisfied with
second," said Quick of his team's
finish. "But now we just need to do
what we can to improve for next
year and make another run at it."

surprised everyone by pulling out
an eighth place finish.
Daly, the anchor for the race,
said that the event was exciting for
the team since they hadn't expected

to place at all. She said that hearing
the encouragement from her team
was what pushed them to swim
faster.
"You can always hear coach
Quick screaming, that's for sure,"
Daly noted.
Wagner and sophomore
Kirsten Gilbert each placed well in
the day's consolation finals for the
100 back and 100 breast, respec
tively. Wagner took 13th, while
Gilbert posted a career-best time
to secure 14th.
Rosenthal dove well to make
her way to the finals in the three
meter springboard. Alter a slow
start in the event, she turned out a
beautiful final dive and clinched
seventh place in the event, captur
ing her second All-American
honor of the meet. Teammate
Murphy finished in 30th place for
the event.
On the last day of the champi
onships, Stanford met with prob
lems as not enough athletes quali
fied for the finals.
But there were some eye-open
ing performances put in on the day,
the highlight of which was Tara
Kirk's race in the 200 breast.
"I'm really excited for Tara,"
said sister Dana before the race,
"Whenever the pressure's on Tara
she seems to pull through."
The elder Kirk lived up to all ex
pectations by winning the event
with a time 0f2:08.79, claiming her
ninth NCAA Championship title.
Boutwell swam in an incredibly

competitive 100 free race, and came
in fifth with a time 0f49.32 in the fi
nals. The winner of the event,
Georgia's Maritza Correia, set a
new American record for the race.
Boutwell also swam a leg of the
Stanford 400 free relay team and
with teammates Daly, Jones, and
Baumgartner placed seventh with a

time of 3:20.79.
Dana Kirk won the consolation
final in the 200 fly, putting her in
ninth place overall in the event.
Caverly matched her top time in
the 200 breast, as she took 11th in
the race.
In the end, the feats of the Car
dinal were not enough to match the

top five teams: Auburn, Georgia,
Southern California, Southern
Methodist and Florida.
"We're not satisfied with sixth, in
fact we wouldn't be satisfied with
second," said Quick of his team's
finish. "But now we just need to do
what we can to improve for next
year and make another run at it."

Junior Tara Kirk prepares on the diving board at nationals on Sunday. Kirk claimed her eighth and ninth NCAA ti
tles and boosted her undefeated collegiate streak in the 100 breaststroke to 27 as Stanford took sixth at the NCAA
Championships in Auburn.
Three days of fierce competition at t he
NCAA Championships in Auburn, Ala.,
landed the Stanford women's swimming
and diving team in unfamiliar territory:
sixth place.
The 12 competing Cardinal athletes
turned heads throughout the weekend
with their intense drive and impressive
performances, but eventually five teams —
including host Auburn, which won its sec
ond-straight national championship —
outdid the Stanford team.
Stanford finished the first day of com
petition at the James K. Martin Aquatic

Center in fifth place, with 81.5 points.
The most notable contributor to that
score was a fourth-place finish overall in
the 400-yard medley relay. Junior Tara
Kirk, sophomores Lacey Boutwell and
Amy Wagner, and freshman Dana Kirk
clocked in at 3 minutes, 35.16 seconds, a
season-best time for theteam. The Auburn
relay team won the event, breaking the
American record that Boutwell, Tara
Kirk, Wagner, and Stanford alum Shelly
Ripple set in last year's Championships.
The Card had a second relay team
make it to the finals when Boutwell, junior

Jones, and freshman Ashley Daly
clinched a sixth-place finish with
their season-best time of 1:31.15 in
the 200 freestyle relay, but it was the
Georgia team that took home the
event title.
Stanford had five swimmers en
tered in the 200 individual medley,
and freshman Kristen Caverly led
the group by winning the consola
tion final, which gave her an overall
finish of ninth place. Auburn's Mag
gie Bowen set a new pool record
and won her third-straight title in
the event.
Boutwell competed in the 50
free and touched the wall with a
time of 22.96, good enough for
12th place.
As a result of their finishes at
NCAA Zone meets, two Cardinal
divers made the road trip to
Auburn: senior McKenze Murphy
and sophomore Ashlee Rosenthal.
Rosenthal worked her way into the
finals in Thursday's one-meter con
test and finished in eighth place.
Murphy garnered All-America
honors with her 16th place finish in
the event.
"There's a lot of talent here; the
competition was very tough."
Rosenthal said. "I felt I could have
been a little more relaxed, but I felt
good overall."
As some speculated that Stan

ford might place out of the top
three (which hasn't happened in 22
years), the Cardinal came roaring
back and raced into third place
overall behind Auburn and Geor
gia by the end of Friday's events.
Tara Kirk led the way for Stan
ford, posting the team's first win of
the meet. Kirk won the 100 breast
stroke with a time of 58.62, a new
NCAA meet record, and she also
boosted her undefeated collegiate
streak in the event to 27.
Though she was aiming to break
her own American record, Kirk
and her team were thrilled with the
win.
"She is consistent and strong,
loves the event and races it so well,"
said Stanford coach Richard Quick,
" I'm really proud of her."
Kirk also teamed up with sister
Dana Kirk, Wagner and Jones to
finish second in the 200 medley
relay with a season-best time of
1:38.42, behind the record-break
ing Tiger relay team.
Two freshmen Cardinal swim

the finals in the second day of

Dana Kirk in the 100 butterfly.
The Cardinal 800 free relay
team entered the event seeded 19th
out of 20 teams, but Boutwell,
