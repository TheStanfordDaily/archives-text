# Stanford bested on home court
## 
### MAISY SAMUELSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Stanford lost to Southern California, barely
beat a poor California team, lost convincingly to Ari
zona and Washington, and almost lost to UCLA in the
Pacific-10 Conference tournament, it was OK because
there was still time to get it together before the NCAA
Tournament. Those struggles could be chalked up to
fatigue and road trips in front of hostile crowds.
Stanford's 68-56 loss to Minnesota in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament, however, demon
strated that offensive execution and defensive intensi
ty cannot be turned on with a flick of the switch.
Historically, upsets have been rare in the women's
tournament. Until this year, No. 3 seeds had won 53
out of 65 contests against No. 6 seeds. Upsets gener
ally occur because the lower seed plays above and be
yond itself.
Last Monday, however, Minnesota looked like the
better team. The Gophers out-played and out-hus
tled the Cardinal and consistently got better looks at
the basket. The final score would have been much
worse had sophomore guard Sebnem Kimyacioglu
not put on a heroic shooting performance in the sec
ond half. Kimyacioglu hit three from downtown and
scored all of her 14 points in the final 20 minutes to
keep the struggling Cardinal offense afloat.
Lacking the athleticism to overwhelm opponents
with power and speed, Stanford needed to compen
sate with intensity, intelligent play-making and shoot
ing accuracy — skills which helped it start the season
8-1 without Nicole Powell.
"We are focusing on doing the correct thing," com
mented VanDerveer at the beginning of the season.
"We are not a big team so we need to box out. If we
don't do the little, fundamental things we will be in
trouble."
Against Minnesota, the Cardinal was in trouble be
cause it threw too many soft passes, picked up too
many ticky-tack fouls and allowed Minnesota wide
body Janel McCarville too many uncontested put-
backs. McCarville converted four
offensive rebounds into seven de
moralizing points.
Powell played only 31 minutes
due to foul trouble and had little
choice but to try to carry the Car
dinal offense herself. As a result
most of Powell's baskets came off
one-on-one moves instead of
teamwork within the flow of the
offense.
Stanford's offense managed
only six assists to Minnesota's 15
and disintegrated into one-on
one battles in the second half.
The Cardinal offense struggled
despite solid performances from
Powell (19 points), Kimyacioglu
(14 points) and T'Nae Theil (12
points). The Stanford cycle was
self-perpetuating — few defen
sive stops and defensive re
bounds translated into few fast
break opportunities and few easy
baskets.
"We really struggled running
any kind of offense," VanDerveer
said . "We just really did not pass
the ball well, move the ball [or] run
anything on offense that gave our
team a good shot at [winning]."
There is one bright spot in
Stanford's disappointing loss.
The same nucleus will have an
other shot next year because the
Cardinal does not graduate any
seniors. Next season will be Pow
ell's last chance to lead her team
to the Final Four and cement her
legacy amongst Stanford's great
est. That will necessarily imbue
the Cardinal squad with greater
urgency.
Next year, however, Stanford

will not have the luxury of playing at
home until the Final Four, as it
would have had this year, because
Maples Pavilion does not have a
large enough capacity to meet new
NCAA requirements lor regional
hosts. Fora team that came into the
tournament riding a 26-game
home winning streak, the opportu
nity to play at home was a huge ad
vantage.
This season was perplexing in
its inconsistency. The Cardinal
began the year overachieving with
Powell on the injured list and grit
ted out tough come-from-behind
wins over Rutgers, then-No. 2
Kansas State and Arizona. The
only question back then was
whether Stanford would have
enough healthy bodies to com
pete, not whether the team had
the will to compete.
Then Powell came back and al
most immediately regained her
All-American form, while the rest
of the team went into hibernation.
Road drummings by Washington
and Arizona did not bode well for
the NCAA tournament but at least
could be attributed to end-of-sea
son fatigue. This NCAA tourna
ment revealed, however, that the
Pac-10 remains far behind other
national conferences like the SEC
or the Big East. The only other
Pac-10 teams in the tournament,
Arizona and Washington, lost in
the first round.
With only one new freshman
joining the team next year, 6-foot
-5 Kristen Newlin from Riverton,
Wyo., Stanford will have another
year to solve the same problems
that plagued the 2003 squad .
Next season, the Cardinal will
need to find a way to be more phys
ically competitive. This group's
comparative advantage lies in fi

nesse rather than brute force and it
will never be able to bruise with
teams like Tennessee or keep up
with teams like Duke. However, in
tensity and being in great physical
shape can go a long way toward

compensating lor lack of size. Next
year, the Cardinal must sustain its
intensity and energy level through
the entire season, or continue its re
cent pattern of premature NCAA
tournament exits.

With only one new freshman
joining the team next year, 6-foot
-5 Kristen Newlin from Riverton,
Wyo., Stanford will have another
year to solve the same problems
that plagued the 2003 squad .
Next season, the Cardinal will
need to find a way to be more phys
ically competitive. This group's
comparative advantage lies in fi

nesse rather than brute force and it
will never be able to bruise with
teams like Tennessee or keep up
with teams like Duke. However, in
tensity and being in great physical
shape can go a long way toward

compensating lor lack of size. Next
year, the Cardinal must sustain its
intensity and energy level through
the entire season, or continue its re
cent pattern of premature NCAA
tournament exits.
When Stanford lost to Southern California, barely
beat a poor California team, lost convincingly to Ari
zona and Washington, and almost lost to UCLA in the
Pacific-10 Conference tournament, it was OK because
there was still time to get it together before the NCAA
Tournament. Those struggles could be chalked up to
fatigue and road trips in front of hostile crowds.
Stanford's 68-56 loss to Minnesota in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament, however, demon
strated that offensive execution and defensive intensi
ty cannot be turned on with a flick of the switch.
Historically, upsets have been rare in the women's
tournament. Until this year, No. 3 seeds had won 53
out of 65 contests against No. 6 seeds. Upsets gener
ally occur because the lower seed plays above and be
yond itself.
Last Monday, however, Minnesota looked like the
better team. The Gophers out-played and out-hus
tled the Cardinal and consistently got better looks at
the basket. The final score would have been much
worse had sophomore guard Sebnem Kimyacioglu
not put on a heroic shooting performance in the sec
ond half. Kimyacioglu hit three from downtown and
scored all of her 14 points in the final 20 minutes to
keep the struggling Cardinal offense afloat.
Lacking the athleticism to overwhelm opponents
with power and speed, Stanford needed to compen
sate with intensity, intelligent play-making and shoot
ing accuracy — skills which helped it start the season
8-1 without Nicole Powell.
"We are focusing on doing the correct thing," com
mented VanDerveer at the beginning of the season.
"We are not a big team so we need to box out. If we
don't do the little, fundamental things we will be in
trouble."
Against Minnesota, the Cardinal was in trouble be
cause it threw too many soft passes, picked up too
many ticky-tack fouls and allowed Minnesota wide
body Janel McCarville too many uncontested put-
backs. McCarville converted four
offensive rebounds into seven de
moralizing points.
Powell played only 31 minutes
due to foul trouble and had little
choice but to try to carry the Car
dinal offense herself. As a result
most of Powell's baskets came off
one-on-one moves instead of
teamwork within the flow of the
offense.
Stanford's offense managed
only six assists to Minnesota's 15
and disintegrated into one-on
one battles in the second half.
The Cardinal offense struggled
despite solid performances from
Powell (19 points), Kimyacioglu
(14 points) and T'Nae Theil (12
points). The Stanford cycle was
self-perpetuating — few defen
sive stops and defensive re
bounds translated into few fast
break opportunities and few easy
baskets.
"We really struggled running
any kind of offense," VanDerveer
said . "We just really did not pass
the ball well, move the ball [or] run
anything on offense that gave our
team a good shot at [winning]."
There is one bright spot in
Stanford's disappointing loss.
The same nucleus will have an
other shot next year because the
Cardinal does not graduate any
seniors. Next season will be Pow
ell's last chance to lead her team
to the Final Four and cement her
legacy amongst Stanford's great
est. That will necessarily imbue
the Cardinal squad with greater
urgency.
Next year, however, Stanford

will not have the luxury of playing at
home until the Final Four, as it
would have had this year, because
Maples Pavilion does not have a
large enough capacity to meet new
NCAA requirements lor regional
hosts. Fora team that came into the
tournament riding a 26-game
home winning streak, the opportu
nity to play at home was a huge ad
vantage.
This season was perplexing in
its inconsistency. The Cardinal
began the year overachieving with
Powell on the injured list and grit
ted out tough come-from-behind
wins over Rutgers, then-No. 2
Kansas State and Arizona. The
only question back then was
whether Stanford would have
enough healthy bodies to com
pete, not whether the team had
the will to compete.
Then Powell came back and al
most immediately regained her
All-American form, while the rest
of the team went into hibernation.
Road drummings by Washington
and Arizona did not bode well for
the NCAA tournament but at least
could be attributed to end-of-sea
son fatigue. This NCAA tourna
ment revealed, however, that the
Pac-10 remains far behind other
national conferences like the SEC
or the Big East. The only other
Pac-10 teams in the tournament,
Arizona and Washington, lost in
the first round.
