# Huskies mush Card tourney hopes
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SPOKANE, Wash. —The season that no
one expected, that no one dared dream
of, came to a sudden end on Saturday af
ternoon in Spokane last week.
In front of a capacity crowd, the
fourth-seeded Cardinal was "upset" by an
athletic fifth-seeded Connecticut squad in
the NCAA Tournament. The second
round loss ended a surprisingly successful
season for Stanford, which finished with a
record of 24-9.
But fora team deemed as an over
achiever all year long, the 85-74 loss still
stung a bit, still caused tears to fall.
In the first half, both teams seemed to
score at will. UConn shot a blistering 50
percent from the field and went 4-for-7
from behind the arc. Likewise, Stanford
came out firing, hitting seven first-half
threes to aid the Cardinal to a 44-40 lead
at the half.
Stanford's senior point guard Julius
Barnes got hot early. He scored 16 points
in the first half off 6-for-9 shooting from
the field, including four 3-pointers (two of
which were launched from NBA-range).
"They gave us everything we could
handle," Husky coach Jim Calhoun said.
"At halftime they had 44 points and we
were saying, 'We can't stop them'"
From a defensive perspective, Stan
ford accomplished what it set out to do in
the first period. The Cardinal limited
sophomore Emeka Okafor to five shots
and only six points. More importantly
Stanford's front line managed to keep the
6-foot-9 center off the offensive glass in
the opening period.
"In the first half, I thought, we con
trolled the tempo," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery. "Connecticut came
out much more aggressive fin the second
half] and made a concerted effort to get
[the ball inside] to Okafor."
The Husky second-half game plan
proved successful early as Okafor scored
six consecutive points to open the first
three minutes of play. He finished with 18
points and 15 rebounds in only 29 min
utes of play. Moreover, UConn grabbed
17 offensive boards —14 of which came in
the second half alone — on its way to vic
tory.
The two teams battled back and forth
for the majority of the half. With around
four minutes left to play, however, the
Huskies began to slowly pull away as the
Cardinal struggled both on the defensive
glass and from the field offensively.
Stanford only managed one 3-pointer
in the second half and went 11-for-28
from the field.

"We didn't play badly," Montgomery
said. "We just got out-physicaled a little
bit."
With 3:18 left on the clock, Rashad An
derson hit one from downtown, which
put the Huskies up by eight and UConn
never looked back.
Before the tournament even began,
Montgomery talked about the overem
phasis placed on the NCAA tourney —
about how one loss in the month of March
can overshadow the accomplishments of a
season that began with summer workouts
and big preseason wins.
What a story this team has become.
A Stanford team, down four players

from last year's squad, was picked to finish
seventh in the Pacific-10 Conference and
instead fought its way to a lone second
place standing in the league.
In a season that no one expected any
thing from them, they managed to out
play some of the nation's best, collecting
wins over Xavier, Florida and top-ranked
Arizona. They took preseason low expec
tations and turned them into a psycholog
ical edge.
"Expectations — they just make you
look good or look bad. They don't mean
anything," said a disappointed Mont-

gomery. "We had a great year,
though."
Added a reflective Barnes, "It's
been a fun ride. We worked hard
and played hard. I'm disappoint
ed in the loss only because its my
last game as a college athlete. But
I'll cherish every moment I had
with this group of guys."
