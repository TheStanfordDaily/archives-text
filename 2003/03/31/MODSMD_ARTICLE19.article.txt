# Lady Longhorns shoot past Gophers
## Former Cardinal Jamie Carey aids Texan effort 
### 
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) —
Texas' Jamie Carey scored 18
points on the same court where
she starred as a freshman for Stan
ford, leading the Longhorns into
the West Regional finals with a 73-
60 victory over Minnesota on Sun
day night at Maples Pavilion.
Second-seeded Texas won its
16th straight game to advance to
the regional final for the sixth time
under coach Jody Conradt, who
took the Longhorns (28-5) to back
to-back Final Fours in 1986 and '87.
They will play top-seeded
Louisiana State (30-3) on Tuesday
night. The Tigers, who beat Texas
76-58 earlier this season, came
from behind to beat Louisiana
Tech 69-63 earlier Sunday.
Texas is the only school with
both its men's and women's teams
still in the NCAA tournament.
The Longhorns also got 14 points
and 12 rebounds from Heather
Schreiber.
Kim Prince had 15 points for
No. 6 seed Minnesota (25-6),
which reached the round of 16 for
the first time in school history with
an upset victory over Stanford last
week but couldn't overcome a
poor performance on offense Sun
day.
The Longhorns' defense held
Minnesota leading scorer Lindsay
Whalen to 13 points, eight below
her average, on 4-for-13 shooting
and she also committed six of her
team's 14 turnovers. Bulky 6-foot
-2 sophomore center Janel Mc-
Carville added 10 points and 12
rebounds, but was not the domi
nant inside presence she had often
been this season.
The Maples Pavilion fans who
would have preferred to have the

hometown Cardinal still playing in
the tournament had the next best
thing in Carey.
Carey, who declared as tar back
as seventh grade she wanted to go
to Stanford, made a school-record
81 3-pointers as a Cardinal fresh
man but transferred to Texas when
school doctors ruled her ineligible
after a series of concussions.
The Longhorns cleared her
and the guard from Thornton,
Colo., left Stanford.
One fan held a red sign reading
"Maples Belongs to Jamie," while
several others wore her red No. 11
Stanford uniform. She received a
standing ovation when she was in
troduced.
Carey took the ball hard to the
basket and aggressively jumped
out into the passing lane for one of
her two steals when the game was
tight in the second half.
The Gophers never got in sync
on offense and were held without
a field goal for 6 1/2 minutes in
the second half. They shot 38
percent.
Nina Norman's 3-pointer with
10:32 left gave Texas a 49-42 lead,
and the Longhorns answered with
clutch baskets - several on second
chance opportunities - whenever
Minnesota made shots to keep the
game close.
Kala Bowers converted two free
throws with 6:01 left fora 61-52
lead to help the Longhorns pull
away.
In the first half, Minnesota rou
tinely forced things on offense
with the shot clock winding down,
missing many shots from close
range.
The teams played for the first
time since two meetings in 1978.
Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer and her staff were in the
stands for the game, but certainly
didn't expect to be watching the
action at their own regional.
