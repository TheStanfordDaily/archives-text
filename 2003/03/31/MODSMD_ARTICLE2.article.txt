# New MCAT policy to prevent withholding lower test scores
## Starting this month, MCAT score reports will include studentsâ€™ complete score history 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Association of American Medical Colleges
announced recently a new "full disclosure" policy
for results of its Medical College Admission Test, a
requirement for acceptance to almost any medical
school in the country.
Under the new MCAT policy, a student's en
tire MCAT history will be released to schools, a
change from the current policy where students
may elect which scores to send and may with
hold their lower scores. Despite this policy
change, which w ill affect all 2003 MCAT results,
many students feel that it will not influence the
number of times they take the test or how they
prepare for it.
The first administration of the MCAT in 2003 is
at the end of this April.
Albert Chevez, associate director of MI) admis
sions at the Stanford Medical School, said that the
new policy will not have much of an impact on ap
plicants or admission policy. Students agree.
"People study hard for the MCAT anyway,"
said junior Jea-hyoun Kim, who took the test last
year. "Most people don't take it more than once
because it's such a grueling experience . . . Most
people probably wouldn't go in taking it half
heartedly."
The American Association of Medical Colleges
made several changes to the MCAT that will take

effect with April's test after conducting a content
review in 2001. The changes are meant to "im
prove the usefulness of test scores while making
the test more user-friendly," according to the
MCAT Web site.
In addition to the new full disclosure policy,
other changes include asking biology questions in
the place of organic chemistry questions, a reduc
tion in questions in the verbal reasoning section to
reduce time pressure, different ordering of the
sections, placing verbal reasoning after the physi
cal sciences portion and changes in scoring, regis
tration and fees.
Chevez said the majority of the test takers only
take it once and on average not usually more than
twice. Hence, the change in disclosure policy will
not affect most students.
Furthermore, he said that the consequence
of reporting an additional MCAT score is not
as important compared to the strength of the
entire application. According to Chevez, re
taking the test is not unusual for students, and
if they do well the second time, that is what is
going to be important. He said it is a miscon
ception that scores are the most important
criterion for admissions because the entire
application is considered.
Sophomore Jonathan Chen is taking the MCAT
in August so he would have the chance of retaking
it if he were not happy with his first score.
"With the new policy I have to rethink if I want
to take it twice and have med schools see a bad and
a good score or if I want to take more time to
study," Chen said.
However, he said he plans to prepare for the
exam as if he were only taking it
once anyway because he does not
want to have to retake the eight
hour test.
Junior Puja Kohli, who
took the MCAT last summer,
said that the change was a log
ical adjustment because it
gives schools the chance to see
improvement. She said that
withholding scores, schools
would assume you did badly
because you were trying to
hide something.
Senior Christina Giannikas,
who plans to take the MCAT this
August, said, "In general, it will
increase pressure on students be
cause they will not have the psy
chological cushion of knowing
you have a second chance, so it
will inherently put pressure on
you."
In light of the relatively
small impact the change will
have, Chevez said that the
Medical School did not have
strong feelings about the new
policy and that other medical
schools probably have a similar
perspective.
