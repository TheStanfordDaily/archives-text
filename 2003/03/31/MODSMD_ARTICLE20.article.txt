The Stanford track and field teams posted good marks at the
NCIAA Indoor National Championships March 15 as the
women claimed sixth and the men finished 10th overall. The
Cardinal returns to the Farm with 15 Ail-Americans, five of
them in two events.
In the first event of the meet, despite finishing fourth in the
first of two preliminary flights, senior Nick Welihozkiy did not
advance to the nine-athlete final in the weight throw. His mark
of 65 feet, 5 inches was good enough for 12th place overall.
In the women's shot put, junior Jillian Camarena finished
the preliminary rounds in fourth overall with a 54-10 and
moved herself into third over Michigan's April Phillips with a
put of 55-2.5.
In the final flight, Camarena threw a personal best and set a
school record of 57-2.75, good for second behind North Car
olina's frosh phenom Gerraughty. Gerraughty's win

both saw NCAA meet records broken in tight finishes.
Colorado's Sara Gorton and Yale's Kate O'Neill pulled away

meet record.
Craig garnered third at 15:43.04 fora Stanford school
