In the first event of the meet, despite finishing fourth in the

put of 55-2.5.
In the final flight, Camarena threw a personal best and set a
school record of 57-2.75, good for second behind North Car
olina's frosh phenom Gerraughty. Gerraughty's win

The men's and women's 5,000-meter races were intense as
both saw NCAA meet records broken in tight finishes.
Colorado's Sara Gorton and Yale's Kate O'Neill pulled away
late from Stanford freshman Alicia Craig and senior Lauren
Fleshman. Gorton claimed the victory in 15:39.25, an NCAA
meet record.
Craig garnered third at 15:43.04 fora Stanford school
record while Fleshman finished fourth 47 seconds behind her.
"All the girls are incredible runners," Gorton said. "When I
heard the bell ring, I started kicking as hard as I could to see if
I could win."
Arkansas' Alistair Cragg took the men's 5,000 field by storm
once a lead pack of eight, including Stanford senior Louis Lu
chini, slowly pulled away from the rest of the field. Cragg and
Eastern Michigan's Cheboiywo blasted through the final laps,
eking out a 13:28.93 victory and NCAA meet record.

the penultimate lap. He faded to
ninth as Villanova's Adrian Blincoe
and junior Grant Roibson raced
down Willis.
At the finish, Blincoe's surge
pulled him to first and Robison out
