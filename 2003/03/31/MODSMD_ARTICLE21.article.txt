# LSU Tigers claw to a tourney win
## 
### 
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) —
Temeka Johnson and Sue Gunter
could see just fine without their
glasses - and their first trip to the
Final Four is definitely in sight.
Johnson had eight points, nine
assists and eight rebounds despite
two broken bones near her right
eye, and Aiysha Smith scored 19
points as top-seeded LSU beat
Louisiana Tech 69-63 on Sunday
in the West Regional semifinals at
Stanford's Maples Pavilion.
Gunter, LSU's Hall of Fame
coach, is on the brink of her first
Final Four after nearly four
decades in the profession. The
Tigers didn't get going against
their fellow Louisiana power until
they trailed by 17 points early in
the second half, but it was easy for
Gunter to forget those struggles.
"I forgot my glasses, so I really
haven't seen the stat sheet,"
Gunter said. "It doesn't matter. I
hear we won."
The Tigers' fortunes changed
in the second half when Johnson,
their sparkplug point guard and
the SEC tournament MVP, cat
alyzed a 16-0 rally with her scor
ing, defense and playmaking. She
wore goggles to protect her face in
the first half, but they kept fogging
up - and she discarded them in
time to lead the Tigers to the win.
Freshman Seimone Augustus
scored 14 points for the Tigers (30-
3), who took the lead for good with
4:30 left, then snapped the fifth
seeded Lady Techsters' 29-game
winning streak with fearless scor
ing down the stretch.
"I don't like to be down, honest
ly - especially by as much as we

were down," Augustus said.
The Tigers also earned Bayou
State superiority, even if the game
was played way out in California.
Two-time WAC player of the
year Cheryl Ford finished her ca
reer with 16 points and 15 re
bounds for Louisiana Tech (31-3),
which hadn't lost since Dec. 4.
Trina Frierson scored 18 points,
but the Lady Techsters lost their
momentum early in the second
half and never got it back as LSU
shot better than 56 percent after
halftime.
"I think we defended them as
well as they've been defended all
year," Louisiana Tech coach Kurt
Budke said. "Stamina probably
had something to do with it at the
end. I believe they have 10 athletes
as good as anyone in the country."
LSU will make its third regional
final appearance Tuesday against
Texas. Gunter has 681 career vic
tories, but the 61-year-old coach
lost her two previous appearances
in a regional final.
Johnson's availability for the
weekend's games was in question
after she took an elbow in the face
last week in the Tigers' second
round game.
Johnson wore one-piece gog
gles early in the game, but she dis
carded them midway through the
first half as her shooting woes
mounted. She went l-for-8 from
the field in the first half, and her
struggles were the primary reason
for Louisiana Tech's 33-23 half
time lead.
Karl Malone, Ford's famous fa
ther, made the trip during a two
day break in the Utah Jazz's season

to support his alma mater and his
daughter. The NBA's second
leading career scorer sipped
lemonade and stood up to shout at
the officials as Louisiana Tech
pulled ahead with Ford's powerful
inside play.
"We played a great game, but
they definitely had a little more
depth on the bench," Ford said.
Afterward, Ford spent several
minutes quietly sobbing on Mal
one's shoulder in a hallway.
LSU was disorganized and life
less, trailing 50-33 — until Donee
ka Hodges and Smith hit tough
shots to start the Tigers' impres
sive run. Augustus scored consecu
tive baskets with eight minutes to
play, cutting Louisiana Tech's lead
to a point.
Gunter believes that when tour
ney time rolls around, the Tigers
draw confidence from their diffi
cult regular-season schedule.
"There was no genius at half
time," Gunter said. "It was about
where we've been. The way we
played game in and game out, and
who we play _ darn, there better be
some benefits from it. We get
taken to the wire every night."
The Tigers took their first lead
on a layup by Johnson, who scored
six of her eight points in succes
sion. Her jumper with 4:32 left
gave LSU a lead it never lost.
It was just the second meeting
in the last 12 years between
Louisiana's perennial basketball
powers. Maples Pavilion was less
than half-full when the game
began, but the traveling fans and
the locals both cheered a well
played game in the second half.

alyzed a 16-0 rally with her scor
ing, defense and playmaking. She
wore goggles to protect her face in
the first half, but they kept fogging
up - and she discarded them in
time to lead the Tigers to the win.
Freshman Seimone Augustus
scored 14 points for the Tigers (30-
3), who took the lead for good with
4:30 left, then snapped the fifth
seeded Lady Techsters' 29-game
winning streak with fearless scor
ing down the stretch.
"I don't like to be down, honest
ly - especially by as much as we

were down," Augustus said.
The Tigers also earned Bayou
State superiority, even if the game
was played way out in California.
Two-time WAC player of the
year Cheryl Ford finished her ca
reer with 16 points and 15 re
bounds for Louisiana Tech (31-3),
which hadn't lost since Dec. 4.
Trina Frierson scored 18 points,
but the Lady Techsters lost their
momentum early in the second
half and never got it back as LSU
shot better than 56 percent after
halftime.
"I think we defended them as
well as they've been defended all
year," Louisiana Tech coach Kurt
Budke said. "Stamina probably
had something to do with it at the
end. I believe they have 10 athletes
as good as anyone in the country."
LSU will make its third regional
final appearance Tuesday against
Texas. Gunter has 681 career vic
tories, but the 61-year-old coach
lost her two previous appearances
in a regional final.
Johnson's availability for the
weekend's games was in question
after she took an elbow in the face
last week in the Tigers' second
round game.
Johnson wore one-piece gog
gles early in the game, but she dis
carded them midway through the
first half as her shooting woes
mounted. She went l-for-8 from
the field in the first half, and her
struggles were the primary reason
for Louisiana Tech's 33-23 half
time lead.
Karl Malone, Ford's famous fa
ther, made the trip during a two
day break in the Utah Jazz's season

to support his alma mater and his
daughter. The NBA's second
leading career scorer sipped
lemonade and stood up to shout at
the officials as Louisiana Tech
pulled ahead with Ford's powerful
inside play.
"We played a great game, but
they definitely had a little more
depth on the bench," Ford said.
Afterward, Ford spent several
minutes quietly sobbing on Mal
one's shoulder in a hallway.
LSU was disorganized and life
less, trailing 50-33 — until Donee
ka Hodges and Smith hit tough
shots to start the Tigers' impres
sive run. Augustus scored consecu
tive baskets with eight minutes to
play, cutting Louisiana Tech's lead
to a point.
Gunter believes that when tour
ney time rolls around, the Tigers
draw confidence from their diffi
cult regular-season schedule.
"There was no genius at half
time," Gunter said. "It was about
where we've been. The way we
played game in and game out, and
who we play _ darn, there better be
some benefits from it. We get
taken to the wire every night."
The Tigers took their first lead
on a layup by Johnson, who scored
six of her eight points in succes
sion. Her jumper with 4:32 left
gave LSU a lead it never lost.
It was just the second meeting
in the last 12 years between
Louisiana's perennial basketball
powers. Maples Pavilion was less
than half-full when the game
began, but the traveling fans and
the locals both cheered a well
played game in the second half.
