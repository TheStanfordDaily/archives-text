# Recent grads discuss life after the Farm
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Recent Stanford graduates just can't seem
to say good-bye to the Farm or their friends
from school. Projects and opportunities have
led students to all corners of the globe to meet
all sorts of interesting people. But whether
they're at work or at school, in Cairo, Manhat
tan or Turkmenistan, most recent grads say
sometimes you can't always plan for the future.
While many graduates leave Stanford with
plans characterized by ambition, most have
found that their paths have steered them in
new directions they had not anticipated.
Along with three other Stanford graduates,
Shad Ahmed, Class of '2002, helped start a mi
crofinance program fora local Egyptian non
governmental organization.
Ahmed commented on how his initial goals
have expanded.
"It's been interesting because our original task
of starting a new program has become a much
larger one — helping to restructure the entire
NGO organizationally and financially," he said.
Allegra Echeverria, another 2002 gradu
ate, is also rethinking her future. A German
studies and international relations major, she
now has a job in investor relations fora dis
tressed debt shop in midtown Manhattan.
"I always thought I'd go to gracl school,"
Echeverria said. "But after working here fora
while, I'm excited about my job and potential
and am not as certain that the benefits of a

graduate degree would make up for the costs
in terms of both money and time."
"It's been extremely challenging at times,"
Ahmed said, "but we have all learned so much
about development work, microfinance, gen
der issues in Egypt, politics in the Middle East.
"I may even stay in the Middle East anoth
er year," Ahmed continued, "but it's also been
difficult being away from my family and all of
my college friends."
Missing college friends seems to be a com
mon phenomenon.
Ravi Chandrasekaran, Class of 2002, is
now a doctoral candidate in chemistry at UC-
Berkeley. While he's only a quick car ride
away, Chandrasekaran said he sometimes
feels like he's in a whole new world.
"[Being a graduate student] is definitely a lot
different — no open doors or candy bowls in
my apartment," he said. "The residential aspect
of Stanford was great. I had it really lucky."
Having all of their friends clustered to
gether is a luxury few recent graduates enjoy.
"I miss the community," Chandrasekaran
said. "It was great having them a couple of
doors down or a short walk across campus."
When it comes to staying in touch, howev
er, time zones and state lines don't have much
importance.
"I love keeping in contact with all my Stan
ford friends," Echeverria said. "It has been
frustrating given that we were all scattered in
the wind, but it has been relieving to have
such a strong Stanford presence in New York.

I never had to worry about feeling alone."
Chandrasekaran said he's on campus
"quite a bit," to visit friends, faculty and the
sophomores and juniors he was a resident as
sistant for in Freshman / Sophomore College.
John Fu, a product design major who
graduated in 2001, has proved it's possible to
play an active role in the Stanford community
after graduation.
Fu lives in Fast Palo Alto and works at Maxtor,
a company that manufactures computer hard
drives. Fu sings with Young At Heart, an a cap
pella group, and recently joined the Cardinal
Whirlwinds, the Stanford square dance group.
"I was used to being constantly surrounded
by people to hang out with," Fu said. "Right
now I'm by far the youngest person in the
company. I enjoy going back 'home' to the
Farm after work and hanging out with friends.
"I still go to social dance stuff on campus,"
Fu continued. "I went to Viennese and often
go to Jammix. So, I'm still pretty connected to
Stanford, though it's definitely a very differ
ent experience from being an undergrad."
Stanford alumni agree that there just isn't
another Farm.
"I definitely do miss it," Chandrasekaran
said. "Stanford is a very special place that I do
not think is replicated elsewhere."
Chandrasekaran hasn't let himself be over
come by Cal loyalty, though.
"For sure, my color will always be cardi
nal," he said. "I still feel, and probably always
will, like a stranger in a foreign land."
