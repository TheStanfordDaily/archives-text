# International spotlight
## Kosovo 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Editor's Note: This is part of a series of interviews with inter
national students at Stanford meant to heighten awareness of
issues of social and political nnportutwe around the world.
Kujtesa Bejtullahu is a junior majoring in in
ternational relations and is a native of
Kosovo. Located in southeastern Europe
next to Albania and Serbia in the Balkans,
Kosovo was part of the former Yugoslavia until 1999,
when the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion intervened to stop a civil war between Albanian
and Serbian Kosovars. Through the United Nations
Mission in Kosovo, the U.N. has been working to in
troduce democracy and social, economic and politi
cal reforms.
Tesa herself played a part in bringing her coun
try's civil war to a close. During the lighting, she se
cretly sent e-mails to a student in the United States.
These e-mails gained international attention, and
they were eventually used by then-President Bill
Clinton to justify U.S. intervention to stop the war in
Kosovo.
The Daily: Could you share with us information
about your country that you think is most important
for people to know about?
Kujtesa Bejtullahu: Kosovo is not really a country
on its own — that's still a debated issue. One side
wants independence and wants it to be a country, and
the other side doesn't. Albanians versus Serbs. It's a
small place. It's about 2.5 million people. Mostly Al
banians, the majority; there's also some other groups.
Obviously there's Serbs, but also Roma and Turkish
people living there and other minorities as well.
[For] the past 10 years, Kosovo has undergone
quite an experience. What happened was that it was
always a place that was disputed throughout the cen
tury and in the 1990s the autonomy that the province
had [Kosovo was a province of the former Yu
goslavia] was revoked and there was all this hatred
growing between the two major communities. Many
people got thrown out of their jobs on an ethnic basis.
Universities closed, schools closed — mostly to Alba
nians. It was a divided society, essentially. Then what
happened was that the Albanians got together and
said, "We'll create our own system. We'll create our
own state — have our own voluntary taxes, create
our own university."
This is what we call the parallel society. I, for exam
ple, went to a school that officially wasn't a school and
wasn't recognized by the Belgrade regime. But it was
recognized by Kosovar /Albanians and actually many
other international institutions in Europe. It was a
whole different system. Albanians tried to create their
own jobs, start their own little market stores or start a
little bit of trade —just different ideas to help them
survive, which was very hard, obviously. A lot of peo
ple went into deep poverty. This went on and mean

while there were the wars in the rest of Yugoslavia.
TD: How much did those wars affect Kosovo?
KB: 1 remember as a kid, right at the moment
when Yugoslavia was about to break up, and there
was this whole tension and talk between which war
would start first. I remember one of our leaders,
Ibrahim Rugova, also the current president, giving a
message to the people saying, "Stay as calm as possi
ble. Stay away from the violence" and things like that.
Not to provoke anything, so that the war wouldn't
happen in Kosovo at the beginning. But it did affect
us from the very beginning. Not only did we see im
ages on TV, but a lot of Kosovar young men were
drafted to light in the wars by the Serbian military,
which went house to house looking for them. A lot of
them escaped, went abroad, including some of my
cousins, who lied the country. And then also refugees
came — mostly Bosnian Serbs who would come on
buses and settle on school playgrounds or other pub-

lie spaces.
TD: So what was life like for you in the 19905?
KB: In retrospect, there were a lot of bad experi
ences. But I also appreciate that because those are ex
periences that have shaped me. I learned so much. I
know one of the things that I really felt at the time as
a young person was that I was really isolated. We
didn't have a lot of opportunities to do the sorts of
things that young people like to do. We didn't have
newspapers or youth organizations, and we couldn't
even do sports because there weren't sports facilities
that we could use. Those were the sorts of things that
I really needed and that's what I went after. Clearly,
the bigger problem was the oppression and so forth.
Unlike many Kosovars, I was really lucky because I
didn't have anybody from my immediate family get
killed whereas a lot of people, especially those in the
villages, did lose family members.
TD: How did you handle it when the fighting did
start?
KB: The fighting started before the war itself took
on the whole country. It was isolated in different re
gions: guerrillas against the military and a lot of
refugees and villagers. I didn't like the war, like most
of the people, and I was trying to find ways to go
about bringing peace at the time — working with dif
ferent youth groups from different ethnicities in
Kosovo and also in the Balkans; organizing different
conferences; publishing a newspaper; working with

internally displaced refugees, little kids who had
come from different war zones. 1 felt that although I
couldn't do much to stop the war, I could do some
thing to make things better. That was the best way for
me to deal with it. Later on, when the war spread out
to the whole country in 1999, movement was limited.
You couldn't go to school or your organizations.
From then on until the end of the war, me and my
family hid in different houses [and] apartments. At
the beginning, I was writing e-mails to a young per
son in California and trying to put some of the mes
sages, some of my thoughts and convey them to a big
ger audience. I wrote a lot and watched the news
when there was electricity and discussed with family
about what was happening.
TD: What are ways Uiat that could happen? I
don't know if you want to personally go back to Koso
vo, but what do you think would be the blueprint for
a plan that would work?

KB: I" m glad you asked that question. I definitely
plan to go to Kosovo. I think a very simple way is to
go to different places where people get together —
to universities, for example, where many students
go there and are dissatisfied with die quality of learn
ing. Mobilize those young energies and just talk to
them about ideas that they want to do. There are a lot
of changes that can be made, a lot of new businesses
that can be started, and this is where the U.N. can
come in very concrete steps and help them out,
through different agencies.
I think one of the major problems is unemploy
ment, especially with youth. Sixty-five to 70 percent
of the population — I'm giving a rough estimate —
are youth. It's a vital population that can really do a
lot. The U.N. is ignoring them, forgetting about
them It is working more on the big scandals. There's
a lot of other areas that they can work on, but we have
to keep in mind that the U.N. has a very broad agen
da. They're literally reconstructing the whole coun
try. Cooperation is also happening, and should hap
pen, at a larger level. A lot of Balkan countries have
already indicated interest in working with each other
more. Right now Albania and Croatia and Serbia are
having talks, diplomats going back and forth, estab
lishing common projects and so forth.
TD: How do various peoples in the Balkans now
see the United States and its role in the intervention
in the region?

KB: I think there's a division there, because the
U.S. had a big stake in how the war turned out in
Kosovo and in Bosnia. I think that Kosovar Albani
ans tend to see it as a positive thing because they leel
that they were saved. I'm not sure, maybe there's a lot
of Serbs out there who don't like it or felt threatened
because the U.S. and NATO as a whole intervened in
their country. For example, fora lot ol people living
in Belgrade, it doesn't make sense that they got
bombed by a foreign country for what has happening
in neighboring Bosnia. But opinions come down to a
personal level. For me, I wasn't a tan of having bombs
dropped over there, but my personal approach to it
was, "Well, my lile is being saved." I think a lot ol peo
ple where threatened by the bombs in Belgrade, so
that's created a lot of division.
TD: So what are you doing at Stanford now, espe
cially related to your experiences growing up?
KB: School is one thing, always, but also right now
I'm working with a group called World Refugee
Leadership Program. This project is about working
with refugee youth in refugee camps to foster lead
ership— to have them start initiatives that they are
passionate about even though they are in camps
where the resources are extremely limited. This sum
mer, I'm planning to go to the Dukwe camp in
Botswana with a team of other Stanford students and
work with refugees there, young adults, mostly —
help them in whatever projects they want to start,
small things like starting a library, soccer league [or]
an art exhibit. We want to help provide them with the
knowledge that there are people outside of their
refugee camps who care about refugees becoming
strong, coming onto their feet and doing the things
that they want to do to improve their communities.
We want to be part of helping to make their ideas a
reality, to ask them, "What is one thing you would
like to do with your life while you're here?"
TD: How does that relate to your own experiences
growing up in Kosovo?
KB: As I was growing up in Kosovo, I always felt a
victim of the oppressive regime and complained a lot
about the things that were missing there. It wasn't
until 1 went to a conference in South Africa where I
met with youth from other conflict zones that I saw all
of them talking about the same sorts of experiences
of being victimized. In a way, it became almost like a
confrontation over whose pain was bigger. But it's re
ally hard to measure that. That's where I realized
that there are so many societies and so many places in
the world in the same situation, and I felt that it
wasn't being that helpful thinking of mysell as only a
victim. I was only limiting myself thinking, "I'm only
a victim and I can't do much about it, that it's in some
other power's hands to change the condition I'm in."
That's when I realized that I can do something to
cause a change. It may be small, but I can.
