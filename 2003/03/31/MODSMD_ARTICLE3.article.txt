# Student group creates Web sites for nonprofits in community
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a time when society's main
method of accessing information
has become electronic, an organi
zation's Web page is often its pri
mary source of outreach. For
many nonprofits, however, the
costs of developing an Internet site
can be too exorbitant to meet.
Technology Assist by Students, a

two-year-old student group, seeks
to make it possible for nonprofits
to have a presence on the YVeb by
linking the talent of Stanford stu
dents with the needs of these orga
nizations.
Sophomore Chris Baer, the fi
nancial officer for the group, said,
"TABS serves to help community
service organizations become more
efficient through technology,
which allows nonprofits to use their

existing resources with a greater
impact on the community."
TABS President Trisha Okubo,
a senior, added, "Our bigger goal is
to help organizations help them
selves. We'd like to give these non
profits a starting point from which
to work with technology, as well as
a direction."
TABS' mission is currently ac
complished in three ways: an intern
program, an annual Project Day and
long-term Web site development.
"TABS is currently working on
several projects through our in
tern program, which connects
Stanford students with nonprofits
in need of technological assis
tance," Baer said. "The intern pro
gram also provides a supportive
network of Stanford [computer
science] alumni and graduate stu
dent mentors to help the students
improve their own abilities while
giving critical feedback."
While interns complete work
on their projects by themselves,
they receive help from mentors.
"It's a solo project, but the advi
sor gives them guidance," said
freshman Julie Zhuo, the project
deputy for TABS. "The interns are
learning as they go along."

The group's Project Day forms
one of the backbones of its work.
Planned this year for April 12, the
event will put volunteers from all
across c ampus into groups of four
or five and provide them with
Web-related projects to work on
fora nonprofit.
The event will take place from 1
to 5 p.m. and is open to all stu
dents.
"The main goal is to promote
volunteerism through technologi
cal skills," Zhuo said.
Rather than designing Web
pages in their entirety, volunteers
will complete smaller tasks, such as
extensions to existing Web pages
and other tasks that can be "rea
sonably accomplished by a group
of four or five people in a span of a
few hours," Zhuo said.
Of course, the focal points of the
group's work are their long-term
Web site development projects for
nonprofits. Projects can last any
where from a couple days to sever
al months and end in a fully func

tional Web page to serve the orga
nization's needs.
"In developing our Web site we
encountered a number of obsta
cles," said Joel Segre, a Stanford
alumnus who spearheaded the de
velopment of impact.Stanford,
edu, an online networking tool
which matches Stanford engineer
ing students with atypical career
opportunities, many of which focus
on international development.
"TABS was able to overcome
them quickly and efficiently," he
said. "They produced a profession
al-looking and useful site for us."
In addition, TABS has recently
become involved in tutoring.
"One project we're working on
this quarter is to virtually link Stan
ford undergraduates with fourth
and filth-grade students at Cesar
Chavez Academy in East Palo
Alto," Baer said.
Typically, tutoring topics are
technology-related, including
lessons on use of the Internet and
computer programs.

A lot of computing power is nec
essary to complete the group's nu
merous projects. Residential Com
puting recently donated a Macin
tosh G3 computer to act as a serv
er and to help with various tasks.
Fora student group less than
two years old, such recognition
and reach is far from ordinary.
"We're still a young, growing
group â€” and right now, we're test
ing the waters with many of our
initiatives," Okubo said. "We'd like
to build our future programs
around the needs and wants of our
members."
