# Post-finals, campus reacts to war
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Small groups of students gathered around their dorm
television sets just after 7 p.m. on March 19 to listen to
President George VV. Hush announce that the United
States had initiated its first strikes in Iraq and that the war
had begun. With the war beginning in the middle of fi
nals week and only a few days before the start of spring
break, campus reaction to the conflict was relatively min
imal, aside from a handful of protest events and the Uni
versity stepping up security measures.
"I would have spent a lot more time watching TV and
reading about it if it weren't during finals week," said se
nior Derek Jackson on Thursday, March 20. "I probably
would have gone to the protests today, but instead I was
in the library studying all day — it's really sad."
On Thursday morning, fewer than 12 hours after
President George W. Bush announced that the United
States has begun its first strikes against Iraq, nearly 100
members of the Stanford community were on the streets
of San Francisco to protest the start of military action. Stu
dents and faculty formed human chains to block traffic
and block entrances to buildings at the intersection of Fol

som and Third streets. Their action, part of a coordinat
ed protest that brought thousands of demonstrators into
San Francisco on March 20, resulted in 50 arrests, at least
30 of which were Stanford students.
"We turn to nonviolent direct action as a last resort,"
said senior Valerie Brar, who led protesters in chants at
the rally. "It is directed at no specific building, business
or governmental agency. This is a symbolic action."
Later in the day, more than 200 students, faculty and
local residents gathered in White Plaza in an on-campus
war protest. Participants in the San Francisco rally re
ported on the events in the city, after which students and
faculty spoke before the microphone was opened to
anyone in the audience who wanted to speak.
"Some people will say, 'I can't do anything about it, so
I'll just go on and live my life like notiiing happened,' "
said History Prof. A1 Camarillo. "Peaceful, non-violent
protest, over a long period, works. You can't give up just
[after] going to one demonstration."
About an hour and a half alter the start of the 3 p.m.
protest, a group of 80 participants marched to Palo Alto
City Hall to join a larger demonstrat ion organized by
