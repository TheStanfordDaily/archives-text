## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
In its search fora new multicultural edu
cator and assistant dean of students, the
University is currendy evaluating several
candidates with the help of students, faculty
and staff. The administration hopes to se
lect a candidate who will continue to facili
tate and potentially expand dialogue and
activities addressing diversity issues on cam
pus.
Former Multicultural Educator and As
sistant Dean Tommy Lee Woon left Stan
ford last summer to spearhead efforts re
garding diversity and multicultural educa
tion at Dartmouth.
The position will be elevated to an asso
ciate dean position before it is filled.
"The criteria for getting the position will
include a demonstrated commitment to
multiculturalism, a personal philosophy of
the role multicultural education plays on a
campus and understanding of the develop
ment issues of 18- to 25-year-olds," said
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students
Julie Lythcott-Haims, who is chairing the
committee in charge of finding a replace
ment.
According to Lythcott-Ilaims, there are
four candidates currendy under review for
the position, including one Stanford em
ployee. Before spring break, committee
members spent 10 days interviewing on

campus while meeting students, faculty
and staff members during several open
forum sessions held each afternoon. Stu
dents from the Lesbian / Gay / Bisexu
al / Transgender Community Resources
Center and other diversity-related organi
zations played an integral role in evaluat
ing the contenders.
"The position could help coordinate
events on behalf of diversity in many areas
and is important to address issues that occur
throughout student affairs," said Winona
Simms, director of the Native American
Cultural Center. "The NACC could use
strong advocacy to halt the annual resur
gence of the 'Indian Mascot' and secure
permanent funding for the annual pow
wow, which is the largest student run multi
cultural event on campus."
Most of the ethnic community centers
were pleased with the performance of mul
ticultural education in previous years and
hope it will continue to nurture student op
portunities for cross-cultural exchange.
"I think the multicultural educator role
is a very important position that comple
ments the mission of Stanford's various
community centers," said Chris Gonzales
Clarke, assistant director at hi Centro Chi
cano. "I hope that this person can encour
age and support dialogue about issues of di
versity in the residences and in other arenas

that are outside of the centers'
sphere of influence."
Multicultural Education is a divi
sion of Residential Education at Stan
ford. The program's mission state
ment is to build and facilitate
"human understanding and connec
tions that enable students to attain
the complementary benefits of diver
sity and the bonds of commonality."
In order to achieve this goal, Mul
ticultural Education sponsors annu
al programs such as Crossing the
Line, Gender Alliance, Stand and
Deliver and race dialogues. Its activ
ities are aimed at all the qualities that
make the University a diverse envi
ronment, targeting issues such as
cultural uniformity and tolerance.
The new associate dean and
multicultural educator will be re
sponsible for opening lines of com
munication between various com
munity centers and housing ser
vices so that residence staff can reaf
firm the importance of diversity on
campus within students' living en
vironment.
University officials did not spec
ify a date when the position will be
