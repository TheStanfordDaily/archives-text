In Alexandria, Egypt, more
than 15,000 students burned
U.S. and British flags, demand
ed boycotts of goods from both

Egyptians have criticized their
government for allowing allied

their way to Iraq. Another three
U.S. cruisers were crossing the
strategic waterway yesterday.
"No to opening the Suez
Canal to the enemies; Salute to
the Iraqi steadfastness," the stu
dents said in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press in
Cairo.
In Spain, protesters con
demned their government for
allowing coalition forces to use
Spanish air space and bases for
refueling.
At least 25,000 people hold
ing banners that read "No to
War" and "Not in Our Name"
marched to the edge of the Rota
Naval and Air Base, which is
shared with U.S. forces. Orga
nizers estimated 60,000 people
participated. Thousands more
marched to military bases in
Moron, Zaragoza and Albacete
and Torrejon.
One of the largest rallies was
in Jakarta, Indonesia, where
more than 100,000 people
chanted "America imperialist,
No. 1 terrorist!" and peacefully
marched a mile from the British
Embassy to the U.S. Embassy in
Jakarta. Some witnesses estimat
ed the crowd was as large as
300,000.
Protesters — many dressed
in Muslim garb — carried ban
ners that read, "Bush, Iraq is not
your killing field."
Outside the heavily guarded

tient, we will dig your grave" —
and in Sao Paolo, Brazil —
where some of the more than
5,000 demonstrators held pic
tures of Bush with a Hitler-style
mustache drawn in.
"Who does Bush think he's
kidding when he says that the
war will free the Iraqi people of a
tyrant. Bush's war is just a vehi
cle to expand U.S. power and if
this goes on, war will never stop
for U.S. greed will never be sati
ated," said Fernanda Alvarez,
32, a marketing director fora
cosmetics company in Sao Paolo.
An estimated 100,000
demonstrators marched in the
northwestern Pakistan city of
Peshawar in a protest organized
by hard-line Islamic leaders.
It was the fourth in a series of
large-scale protests in Pakistan's
main cities organized by the Mu
tahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, or
United Action Forum, and
dubbed the"Million Man
March." Demonstrations of sev
eral thousand people also were
held in the cities of Multan in
central Pakistan and Quetta in
the southwest.
Traffic came to a halt in
many parts of Calcutta, India,
where tens of thousands of ac
tivists marched six miles to the
American Center, a U.S. cultur
al organization.
In South Korea, 30,000
workers protested the war and
demanded that the National As
sembly reject a government bill
that calls for dispatching 600
military engineers and 100
medics to support the war. The
United States is a key ally of
South Korea, but amid rising
anti-war sentiment, the assem
bly delayed voting on the bill
twice last week.
