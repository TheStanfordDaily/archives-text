Secret Empire: Eisenhower, the CIA, and the Hidden Story of America's Space Espionage by Philip Taubman
During the early and most dangerous years of the cold war, a handful of Americans, led by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, revolutionized spying and warfare. In great secrecy and beyond the prying
eyes of Congress and the press, they built exotic new machines that opened up the Soviet Union to surveillance and protected the United States from surprise nuclear attack. Secret Empire is the
dramatic story of these men and their inventions, told in full for the first time.

One Man's Leg by Paul Martin
One Man's Leg is the story of Paul Martin's life to date--and what a life it has been. Whether the passage is laugh-out-loud funny, fiercely heartbreaking or gently thought provoking, few readers will
fail to be captivated by Paul Martin's adventures-and misadventures! Things just happen to Paul: storms form out of the blue when he is sailing; culprits steal his bike when his back is turned, and
they break into his car while he is ensconced in his highest moment-completing his first ever marathon. While insurance companies are willing to help him acquire a leg to stand on, they balk every
time he needs one to run on. And he seems to be accident prone-even after the accident that claimed his limb. As one observer puts it, "There are two kinds of people in the world-those who like
to dance with gravity and those who don't."
