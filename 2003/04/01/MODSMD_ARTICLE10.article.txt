# Row managers endure long selection process
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the recently completed
selection process for Row house
managers has come under fire in
the past for giving previous Row
residents a leg up in earning man
agerial, current Row managers at
test that the process is fair and im
proved from previous years.
Regardless of the politics in
volved, every year hundreds of
students apply for Row positions.
Applicants first submit a basic in
formation form, and the different
houses provide supplemental
questions in addition. These forms
are sent to the current managers of
the houses, who select the appli
cants they wish to interview. Inter
views are conducted and the new
staff is picked. This list is sent to
Student Affairs Officer for Resi
dential Education Augie Galvan,
who approves the list.
Senior J ing Cai, social manager
for Xanadu, which received a Row
record of 70 applicants for six
spots, said the applicants selected
for interviews are chosen "based
mostly on the supplemental ques
tions, because you don't get much
from the basic form."
Each house has a slightly differ
ent application process. Although
most houses select applicants for
interviews, some have a different
format for the second round of the
application process.
At Kairos, the entire house can
be involved with the selection
process, rather than just the man
agerial staff". Senior Anna-Christi
na Douglas, the resident assistant
in Kairos, said, "We have all the
applicants, in and out of the
house, write up some answers to
questions [and] have the answers
in a binder for people to read.
[W r e] have a big house meeting
where each applicant has a
minute to talk. Then we ask them
two random questions and the

house votes."
Although the process may be al
tered slightly between houses, it is
the current managerial staff that
selects the managers for the up
coming year.
This aspect of the process in
particular has received criticism
for being unfair.
"Some people think that it's re
ally nepotistic, that people who
live in the house the current year
have a higher tendency to get
picked," said Narnia's social man
ager, Jnd Boomhower. "In the
past couple of years, Augie [Gal
van] has been looking out for that
and cracking down."
Cai concurred.
"Augie has tried really hard to
prevent that from happening and
it's gotten a lot better," he said.
Although some might consid
er the rate of reselection of cur
rent Row managers high, several
managers said this is not without
good reason.
"I think it's true that if you
know people in a certain house
you probably have a higher
chance of getting that job,"
Boomhower said. "If you think
that's unfair, then [the process] is
unfair. It makes sense because
people who live on the Row have
a better understanding of the
Row."
Cai added, "Xanadu staff'hired
a bunch of current staff because
they were juniors ... and we were
criticized for that, but we chose
those people because they were
the best applicants . .. and I don't
think we can be criticized for that.
As long as the staff" makes a con
scious effort not to hire their
friends there's nothing wrong with
that... I think it works. I don't see
how it can be abused.
"If you know [an] applicant re
ally well, you are theoretically sup
posed to step out of the interview
so you don't bias the decision."
Cai also explained that current

staff members who are applying
for the next year are not allowed to
be a part of the selection process.
Just as the process for select
ing the Row managers changes
from house to house, so do their
responsibilities and benefits.
Row managers often are com
pensated by being given a room
in the house they manage, some
times receiving the first choice of
rooms in the house, thereby
avoiding the hassle of the in
house draw.
As for compensation, Douglas
said, "They're not paid in cash,

they're paid through getting
money off their board bill."
The exact number of positions
varies between the houses but
the general categories remain
the same. They include: kitchen
managers, financial managers,
social managers, house man
agers and residential computer
coordinators, although RCCs are
t hosen separately through Resi
dential Computing. The Row
managers are responsible for
choosing the house's resident as
sistant, a process which is soon
approaching.

staff members who are applying
for the next year are not allowed to
be a part of the selection process.
Just as the process for select
ing the Row managers changes
from house to house, so do their
responsibilities and benefits.
Row managers often are com
pensated by being given a room
in the house they manage, some
times receiving the first choice of
rooms in the house, thereby
avoiding the hassle of the in
house draw.
As for compensation, Douglas
said, "They're not paid in cash,

they're paid through getting
money off their board bill."
The exact number of positions
varies between the houses but
the general categories remain
the same. They include: kitchen
managers, financial managers,
social managers, house man
agers and residential computer
coordinators, although RCCs are
t hosen separately through Resi
dential Computing. The Row
managers are responsible for
choosing the house's resident as
sistant, a process which is soon
approaching.

553 and 557 Ma/field are just two of the dozen Row houses which recently
finished the extensive selection process for next year's house managers.
