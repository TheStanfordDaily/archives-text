National Guard helicopters land in Roble Field
Two weeks ago, two Air National Guard helicopters landed in Roble
Field to transport three patients from a cruise ship in the Pacific Ocean
to the Stanford Hospital. The Pave Hawk helicopters, used in medical
evacuations, were too large to land on the hospital helipad. Ihe heli
copters are more than 60 feet long.
The 129 th Rescue Wing Public Affairs Officer, Timothy Perez, said
that it was the first time, to his knowledge, that three people were res
cued at the same time. The three individuals, two males and one female,
were diagnosed with heart failure and other heart related problems.
Resident Dean at Roble Hall, Jamila Saudi, said she, other resident
fellows and students were notified of the rescue operation so the pres
ence of military aircraft would not cause alarm, though the site of the he
licopters flying over campus just days before the start of war in Iraq did
turn some heads in White Plaza and elsewhere.
Google searches Stanford
Last week, Stanford started using the Google search engine to make
navigating the more than a million Web pages indexed at Stanford eas
ier.
The search engine, developed at Stanford in the mid-1990s by two
graduate students, started off as a dorm-room project but soon expand
ed into one of the largest search engines. Google replaces the Ultra-
Seek/Inktomi Web search engine.
Electrical engineering professor honored with
Presidential Award
Electrical Engineering Prof. Robert M. Gray was one of 10 individu
als honored with the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Math
ematics and Engineering Mentoring late last month.
According to National Science Foundation spokesperson Manny M.
Pelt, Gray was honored because he "demonstrated a successful model for
attracting and accommodating women to engineering, actively men
tored and encouraged women in their pursuit of electrical engineering
doctorates."
Gray has mentored 13 female doctoral candidates. According to one
of his former students, 7 percent of women who are current faculty in
the top 23 electrical engineering departments in the country have been
supervised by Gray.
The award includes a $10,000 grant for continued mentoring work.
