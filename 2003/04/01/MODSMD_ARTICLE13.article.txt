## U.S. troops kill 7 Iraqi citizens 
### 
DOHA, Qatar (AP) — U.S. troops shot and killed
at least seven Iraqi civilians — some of them chil
dren — in a van at checkpoint yesterday in southern
Iraq when the driver did not stop as ordered, U.S.
Central Command said.
The soldiers were from the Third Infantry Divi
sion, which lost four soldiers Saturday at another
checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier dressed as a civilian
detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack.
The Central Command said initial reports from
yesterday's confrontation indicated the soldiers fol
lowed the rules of engagement to protect themselves.
"In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi
regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to
avoid the unnecessary loss of life," the statement said.
However, yesterday's deadly shooting near the
southern Iraqi city of Najaf is likely to stoke opposi
tion to the U.S.-led invasion among Iraqis in the
Shiite Muslim region, where Washington had
hoped fora popular uprising against President Sad
dam Hussein.
Instead, U.S. forces have faced stubborn resistance
by Saddam's forces in Najaf and other cities in south
ern Shiite strongholds.
According to an account by the Central Command,
the van approached the U.S. Army checkpoint yester
day afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop
but were ignored. They then fired warning shots but
the vehicle moving toward the checkpoint. Troops
then shot into its engine. As a last resort, the military
said, soldiers fired into the passenger compartment.
Two other civilians were wounded at the check
point on a highway near Karbala, according to a Pen
tagon official and Central Command. The military is
investigating.
"They tried to warn the vehicle to stop, it did not
stop," Marine Corps Gen. Peter Pace said on PBS
TV's "The New Hour with Jim Leherer." "And it was
unusual that that vehicle would be full of only women
and that the driver was a woman. So we need to find
out why it was that they were acting the way they did."
The military statement said 13 women and chil
dren were in the van. But The Washington Post,
whose reporter is embedded with the Third Infantry,
said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed,
including five children who appeared to be younger
than age 5. One of the wounded was a man not ex
pected to live, the Post reported on its Web site.
The newspaper described the vehicle as a four
wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the Iraqis' person
al belongings.
In its description of the shooting, the Post quoted a
Third Infantry Division captain as saying the check
point crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough.
