# Suicide bomber's house destroyed

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers early today
destroyed the house of the Palestinian who blew him
self up in the Israeli city of Netanya this week, wound
ing dozens, Palestinians said.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
The bomber, identified by the militant Islamic
Jihad as Rami Ghanem, 20, set off explosives
strapped to his body at a sidewalk cafe in the seaside
resort city on Sunday, wounding 49 people.
In a statement hours after the bombing, Islamic
Jihad said the attack was "Palestine's gift to the heroic
people of Iraq." The movement also said it had sent
suicide bombers to Iraq to kill U.S. and British soldiers.
Islamic Jihad is the smaller of two violent Islamic
movements that have claimed responsibility for
dozens of suicide bombings that have killed hun
dreds of Israelis.
Witnesses said that before daybreak, Israeli forces

entered the village of Dir Rasoun, near the town of
Tulkarem on the line between Israel and the West
Bank, and destroyed the Ghanem family home.
In recent months, Israel implemented a policy of
destroying the homes of militants as a deterrent mea
sure. Palestinians and human rights groups com
plain that the destructions punish innocent relatives.
In 30 months of Palestinian-Israeli violence, sui
cide bombers have struck Netanya six times. On
March 27, 2001, a bomber blew up a Netanya hotel
lobby during a Jewish Passover meal, killing 29, the
deadliest of the 88 suicide bombings since the current
violence erupted in September, 2000.
Netanya is at Israel's narrowest point, where the
line with the West Bank is just nine miles from the
Mediterranean coast. Last year Israel began building
a security fence to keep Palestinian attackers out of
the country, but work has proceeded slowly.

Israeli rescue workers search the scene after an explosion in the Israeli coastal city of Netanya on Sunday. A Pales
tinian man belonging to Islamic Jihad killed himself and injured about 30 others — the first suicide bombing inside
Israel since the start of the Iraq War.
