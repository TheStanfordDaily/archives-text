# Mystery illness spreads globally

HONG KONG (AP) — Health officials sealed off
an apartment building and quarantined all 240 resi
dents Monday after reporting an alarming jump in
new cases of a mystery flu-like disease.
'fhe first confirmed case of the illness was report
ed last Tuesday in Australia, but the patient had al
ready recovered and the illness has not spread, health
officials said.
The Australian man, who had been in Singapore,
was successfully treated in a Sydney hospital in late
February and released before the disease was
known, Australia's chief medical officer Richard
Smallwood said.
More than 600 people in Hong Kong are believed
to have the dangerous respiratory infection, and al
most half of those live in the Amoy Gardens apart
ment complex. Officials reported 92 new cases in the
complex on Monday.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has
prompted officials in Asian countries to enforce little
used quarantine laws, close schools and impose new
health screenings on travelers.
The disease, which has no proven treatment, also
continued spreading in other affected hot spots, such
as Singapore and Toronto.
Doctors and nurses in Singapore donned special
respirator suits designed for handling germ warfare
attacks so they could get close to patients infected
with SARS.
In Canada, where a health emergency has been
declared in Ontario province, Toronto authorities
reported that at least two children had been hos
pitalized with the disease, and three others were
showing symptoms of it. But they would not give
details.
Worldwide about 60 people have died — at least
15 of those in Hong Kong. Government officials are
pondering setting up quarantine centers if the dis
ease cannot be contained.
The World Health Organization said yesterday
that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and
signs continue to point the coronavirus, which causes
about one-fifth of all colds.
Dr. David Heymann, WHO's communicable dis
eases chief, told PBS' "News Hour with Jim Lehrer"
yesterday that 11 laboratories are sharing data in"a
solidarity within the world unknown in public
health."
Hitoshi Oshitani, the WHO coordinator for SARS,
said he believes scientists will determine the cause
soon, possibly within days.
"But this doesn't mean we will find the specific
treatment for this disease within the short time peri
od," he said.
