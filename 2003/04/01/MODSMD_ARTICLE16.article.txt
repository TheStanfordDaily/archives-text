						Stanford Daily Guarding the right to report 
### 
Editorial

As the campaigning process for
ASSU positions is only a week
away, candidates who are looking
to become part of the association
are busy preparing their campaigns and
speaking to fellow students. And they are
being especially careful about their actions
and words — knowing that their peers will
determine whether or not they are elected.
Among their peers are bound to be Stan
ford Daily reporters, who may be their
roommates, friends, significant others or
neighbors — some of whom may be direct
ly covering the ASSU elections process.
The worst fear of any candidate is that a
comment between friends against an oppo
nent or competitor may be overheard and
printed in the paper — a situation that be
came true in a small town meeting in West
Chester, Pennsylvania. After a council meet
ing on April 19, 1995, a young journalist re
ported that one council member called oth
ers — including the council president and

the mayor — "liars,"
"criminals," "draft
dodgers" and "child
molesters."
The legal crossfire
that ensued addresses
one of the most chal
lenging issues that the
media faces: whether
every fact and every
detail should be re
ported — even if the
comments are wild
rantings from one
politician to another.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will
soon rule on whether the law should allow
reporters to maintain the neutral report
privilege. This privilege allows journalists
to report any comments or statements
made by politicians as long as they are pro
vided in the correct context and are not
used to support or oppose a political
stance.
The privilege allows reporters to make
decisions as to what should be printed in
the paper — a heavy responsibility which
will determine what the public will know.
Yet if the Supreme Court rules against
upholding it, the fear of legal retribution
may deter journalists from printing infor
mation that the public certainly should
have. Interfering with the press denies the
public a source in which they can trust and
that it is independent from the complicat
ed political arena.
We believe that the media should act re
sponsibly — but that it should act alone.
The government and the legal system
should not interfere with the information

If the court rules against the neu

right — the right to know.

covered by the press, or else the United
States will face a situation such as the cen
sorship of the press in China, where the
conditions for journalists tend to be op
pressive.
Our Founding Fathers wrote the Consti
tution with a spirit of neutral but complete
reporting in mind. The First Amendment
guarantees that "Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press," and if the court rules
against the neutral reporting privilege, cit
izens will be denied a fundamental right —
the right to know. Politicians may not be
entirely pleased that any statement uttered
may be covered by the press, but if citizens
are to make decisions about whom they
choose as their leaders, then reporters
have the responsibility to create such
awareness.
There is no doubt that journalists
should strive to cover every issue as accu
rately as possible in every possible sce-

nario. And in the situa
tion that the reporters
are not sure about the
truth of comments or
the context in which
statements are made,
reporters should ei
ther confirm the com
ments or delete them
from the final stories.
In many cases, the
context in which state
ments are made is an
important considera
tion. It is imperative

that a fair article place quotes in the ap
propriate places in order to justly repre
sent a viewpoint or a story. Incorporating
controversial or inflammatory comments
in a neutral context in the story is the only
way in which these types of statements
should be handled.
In recent weeks, U.S. citizens have re
lied on the press and network media
sources to provide information about the
war in Iraq. To restrict or censor news cov
erage would leave people without a reli
able information source. While politicians
may report their viewpoints on specific de
velopments in the war, many individuals
look to newspapers and renowned televi
sion reporters to provide an unbiased pre
sentation.
As a society, we depend on the media to
inform us of the events around the world,
and we deserve to be told every relevant
detail. Yet we must be able to trust re
porters to print only the facts — and to
present those facts in a neutral context —
so that we can form our own opinions.
