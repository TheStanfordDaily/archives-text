# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Only skin deep

What is beauty? It's the
rainbow after a morn
ing shower. It's a herd
of gazelles running
freely on the plains of Africa. It is a
woman dad in halter top, miniskirt
and stilettos.
Beautiful women are intoxicat
ing, beckoning mortal men with the
promise of forbidden fruits. They
embody the youth that, after gravi
ty has done its evil, their older coun
terparts long to recapture —
through any means necessary, even
high-priced, high-risk surgery.
From Helen ofTroy to Halle Berry,
these women are inevitably put on
pedestals, a sight for all to behold
and enjoy.
Scientists believe that physical
beauty is purely a matter of sym
metry. Draw an imaginary line
down the middle of your face and
body. If your left side is a perfect
mirror reflection of your right
side, congratulations. You are in
the same cohort as Brad Pitt and
Cindy Crawford. From an evolu
tionary perspective, the most sym
metric individuals are thought to
produce the fittest offspring. So
physical attractiveness does have
instinctual roots, and we don't
have to come up with a logical ex
planation for the mesmerizing
power it holds over us.
Even in ancient Greece, Plato and
his cronies attempted to provide a
sound — albeit incorrect — expla
nation for beauty. Unfortunately,
those lofty Platonic ideals have di
gressed into Barbie ideals, as epito
mized by the media monstrosity
that is Anna Kournikova. When she
played at Taube Tennis Stadium
last summer, my friend bragged
about how he was within five feet of
her, snapping picture after picture
(probably while smirking sheepish
ly). He and every other photogra
pher within a 20-mile radius

trained their cameras on her — a
tennis player who's never won a
tournament, but whose dazzling
smile and lithe body make her by
far the most talked-about female
sports figure in the world.
We care much less about
Kournikova's lack of tennis savvy,
or her diva-like shenanigans off the
court. Beauty is important, and as
any seasoned Tri-Delt can attest, it's

often the initial
thing a man looks
for in a woman. So
it makes sense that
my parents are on
a mission to pum
mel a mantra into
my thick skull:
personality over
looks. They cor-

rectly reason that while beauty will
fade after 20 years of marriage, my
future wife's demeanor will remain
till death do us part. Nevertheless, it
is still difficult to completely ignore
the looks department.
The scenario: You're walking
past the clock tower and you spot
her. Double-take. She's hot. So hot
you could fry an egg on her head.
Fora fleeting second, your head
conjures up images of her feeding
you grapes on a golden throne. Do
you go up and talk to her, working
your way towards the phone num
ber? Good luck. Two other guys
have thought the exact same thing
in the last five minutes. The one
with the balls got rejected.
While the rejection stings, it's
justified. In those moments, a
man's testosterone is in overdrive
— which is also the reason why
being turned down once won't pre
vent him from utilizing the same
tactics again and again. An amal
gam of researchers have shown that
for both men and women, greater
attractiveness is correlated with
greater intelligence, popularity,

temperament, occupational success
and dating experience. Yet there is
no reason for us average-looking
folk to hate — or even be jealous of
— these beautiful people. Looks
are purely luck of the draw, the
hand that God dealt them at birth.
The problem is that attractive
women are keenly aware they're
holding a royal flush. Face-to-face,
men are willing drones, pitifully at
their beck-and-call. Men often write
them off as promiscuous fiends, ei
ther because these women really are
such types, or more likely because
the men got burned in a past en
counters . Does this treatment of fe
male attractiveness bordering on
chauvinistic? Sure. Superficiality is
inherently objectifying. Besides,
women can pay just as much atten
tion to looks. After all, they don't
swoon fora water polo player's aca
demic prowess.
Ultimately, when we stare at the
airbrushed figures in Sports Illus
trated, we are naturally led to be
lieve that the females at Stanford
are not in the same realm. Whether
this is true or not depends on how
high your standards are and how
gullible you are about the reality of
magazine covers. Regardless, some
ascribe to the notion that beauty is
inversely proportional to intelli
gence. If this is true, then it should
come as no surprise that Cal girls
are better looking.Beautiful
women will continue to land invest
ment banking jobs in this bearish
economy. And they'll continue to
evade speeding tickets with a flick of
their hair and an innocuous look of
feigned distress.
Nevertheless, I'll continue to love
them, if only from afar, just the
same.

After you flush, please don't leave
cfmg@stanford.edu facedown an the
ground.
