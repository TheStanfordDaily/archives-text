Proud to be an alumna
Regarding your editorial, "A war
without reason" (March 21): You make
me proud to be a Stanford alumna.

Praying for our hoops
I just wanted to take a moment to
voice my support of our troops who are
risking their lives on my behalf, although
I do not support the Bush administra
tion in its decision to declare war. Too
often, discussions of war and peace be
come polarized into anti-war vs. pro
troop, but that narrow view doesn't cap
ture the feelings of most Americans who
are against the war. I appreciate our
troops so much that I would rather them
be home than fighting a war that I do not
see as just or immediately necessary. The
Bush administration has tried to make it
seem as though this is a good war and
that God is on the American side. How
ever, as Jimmy Garter stated in his Nobel
acceptance speech, "War may sometimes

be a necessary evil. But no matter how
necessary, it is always an evil, never a
good. We will not learn to live together in
peace by killing each other's children."
I pray daily for all of those who are
touched directly and indirectly by the
war. I pray that our soldiers will be able
to return home — alive. I pray for fami
lies who have been torn apart and for
Americans who seem to have forgotten
that it is OK to disagree. I pray for the cit
izens of Iraq and yes, even their soldiers.
I believe that my God is not just the
God of the United States —he is the God
of the world. He does not just love those
who claim citizenship in these United
States, He loves all of humanity. We
should not just be saying "God Bless
America" nor should we assume that
God is happy with our nation's current
actions or our lack of action in the past.
Many of the reasons for which our na
tion's leaders claim we are going to war
today are problems that we helped to
create by supporting evil dictators to
meet our purposes or by ignoring them
because they were not strategically im
portant. I believe that God would want
us to act on the side of justice and peace
— whether or not it is convenient or
strategic for us.
I ask that all of those who believe in

the redeeming power of prayer, whether
you agree with the decision to go to war
or not, would join me in prayer not just
for America, but for our world.

Editorials should rally students 'to pres
sure Bush administration' to rebuild Iraq

The Daily's editorial "A war without
reason" (March 31) was certainly an em
barrassment to the Stanford community.
Maybe the writers should have read
through it again before re-publishing it,
as what few arguments it makes have had
their faultiness exposed a mere week and
a half later.
The editorial says the United States
should have been more willing to listen
to the United Nations while failing to no
tice that two of the war's greatest oppo
nents on the security council, France and
Russia, just happen to have large eco
nomic investments in the current regime
that would be lost if Hussein was ousted.
The statement that the president has
failed to convince the American public of
the necessity of this war is just plain in
tellectually dishonest: 70 percent of

Americans support the war, whether the
staff of The Daily likes it or not.
As for Hussein's respect for human
life, since the outbreak of war, we've seen
prisoners of war executed and civilians
shot by Iraqi soldiers while attempting to
flee cities, while other soldiers have been
hiding out in civilian hospitals and wear
ing civilian clothing, putting the lives of
their own people in grave danger.
On the other hand, thus far coalition
forces have shown an unprecedented
consideration for the welfare of civilians
in their campaign. Water treatment and
power plants are natural targets for shut
ting down an opponent, and yet these
have been spared because they will be
necessary for the rebuilding of a demo
cratic Iraq.
Furthermore, even strikes against
military targets have been called off on
account of the presence of civilians.
There have been civilian casualties to be
sure, and there will be more, but as the
evidence of the extent of Saddam's atroc
ities continues to mount, it is becoming
increasingly clear that in the long run
this campaign will save more lives than it
takes.
I would hope that the daily paper at a
university like Stanford would be a liltle
more aware of current events, and a little

more willing to back up its opinions with
solid arguments. The editorial was
rhetorically shaky at its first publication,
but a week and a half later it is downright
laughable. If the editorial board were
truly concerned about Iraqi citizens, it
would stop throwing an anti-war
tantrum and start rallying students to
pressure the Bush administration to fol
low through on its promise to rebuild a
free and independent Iraq.

Hawaii University prof reminds students
that University belongs to student body
To the six students facing the Judicial
Affairs members, keep this speech of for
mer ASSU President David Harris close
to heart: "You've been taught all along
that education is something that some
one does for you, that teachers educate.
A better way of understanding it is that
education is something that takes place
in your own mind, and things outside of
that serve only as stimuli. What this
means is that the University exists
