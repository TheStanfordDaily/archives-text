# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Views of American supremacy have spun out of control 
### RONALD CHAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
After years of economic prosperity and
domestic peace, many people in this
country have assumed that awful things
shall never happen in the United States,
because Americans are — and deserve to
be — more worthy than people else
where. Starvation? Not in America; it hap
pens only in Ethiopia and North Korea.
Suicidal bombing and guerrilla combats?
Not here; they are far away in the Israel-
Palestinian battle and the India-Kashmir
conflict. Censorship and undue persecu
tions? Our government is too good for
that; they are products of dictatorships
like China and Cuba.
Not until the Sept. 11 attacks did people
realize that Americans are indeed just as
vulnerable as people living in other conti

nents. Fora while, I trusted the terrorist at
tacks would prompt people to seriously re
flect on the unilateralism deeply embedded
in American foreign policy and to recognize
the error of this widespread mentality of
American supremacy.
But I was vastly disappointed that many
people buy President George W. Bush's ex
planation for why the terrorists flew planes
into the World Trade Centers and the Pen
tagon: The terrorists were envious of the
freedom and democracy we enjoy.
If they had really wanted to express their
hatred of American freedom and democra
cy, they would have made their message
much clearer by flying the planes into the
Statue of Liberty.
Many Americans — and certainly the
Bush administration — are reluctant to
admit that American corporations have ex
ploited millions of people overseas and

American militarism has caused more vio
lence than peace. To admit these charges is
to undermine American supremacy.
Nonetheless, our lives are miserable after
the terrorist attacks and the whole world is
aware of this fact. To maintain our superi
ority, the government has decided to
launch a war to make other people's lives
even more miserable.
This sense of American supremacy is
getting out of control, to the extent where
American lives have become more precious
than lives of people of other nationalities.
The loss of 3,000 lives makes Sept. 11 the
most tragic day in the history of hu
mankind, but the loss of civilian lives in Iraq
during the war is nothing more than "col
lateral damage." Time and again relatives
of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks appear on
television and newspapers, expressing
their deepest sorrow over the deaths of

their loved ones and their resentment at the
19 individuals who killed them, but I have
yet to see mainstream American media in
terviewing the grief-stricken families of the
158,000 Iraqi men, women and children
who died during and shortly after the Per
sian Gulf War in 1991.
What makes American lives inherently
more valuable than Iraqi lives and, for that
matter, lives of any non-Americans?
Doesn't liberalism, the very ideology upon
which this country was founded some 200
years ago, assert that all human beings are
socially and politically equal? Let's make
this clear: The fact that we are born in the
United States does not make our lives any
more dear than lives of others. If it were not
for God's mercy, we could very well be suf
fering in Ethiopia, North Korea, China,
India, Israel or the majority of countries in
this world where comfort and sufficiency

are rarely taken for granted. Unfortunate
ly, the government is shamelessly abusing
our fortunate position to penalize the less
fortunate Iraqi people.
President Bush likes to end his speech
es to the nation with the phrase "God bless
America." Apparently, he means "God
bless only America." I can almost say with
certainty that God does not like this idea,
as Jesus once told us the golden rule, "Do
unto others as you would have them do
unto you." I hope this country treats the
Iraqi people with the same dignity that we
would like to be treated and stops inflict
ing on them the same pain that we detest
— the pain that they feel will be just as
acute as the pain that we felt.
