## Bronze hard to swallow 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Cardinal men's swimming
and diving team had one goal in mind as it
headed into the NCAA championships last
weekend in Austin: to live up to its ranking
and win the national title. With tough com
petition from No. 2 Auburn and No. 5
Texas, however, the team took third, scor
ing 374 points to Auburn's 609.5 and
Texas' 413.
With its win, Auburn became only the
second team in history to break the 600-
point barrier at a national championship.
In addition, Auburn scored points in all 21
events and its 19 athletes combined to col
lect 61 All-America honors.
"We were definitely disappointed with
the outcome of the meet," junior co-captain
Markus Rogan said. "We put high expecta
tions on ourselves but now were are realiz
ing that we can learn more from the defeat
than the victory. When you win you some
times forget how you got there."
Thursday was the first day of competi
tion, and after the opening day Stanford
stood in second behind the Tigers. The 200
freestyle relay team of senior Randall Bal
and juniors Peter Marshall, Andrew
Schnell and Bobby O'Bryan opened the
meet with a win in 1:17.03 and successfully
defended its title from the previous year.
In the 500 free, junior Matt Sorlien fin
ished 12th in 4:20.73. Stanford placed

three swimmers in the 200 individual med
ley, as Rogan and sophomore Dan Trupin
took fifth and sixth, respectively, and junior
Michael Bruce placed 12th in the consola
tion final.
Auburn saw four of its swimmers in the
top eight of the 50 free, which extended its
lead over the Cardinal. Bal finished eighth
in the event in 19.52. In the final event of
the day, Texas' 400 medley relay team set
new NCAA and American records to cap
ture the win. Stanford finished one second
behind to take second place.
"Auburn came in strong from the very
first session and about halfway through the
meet we knew it was over," Rogan said. "It
turned into a long weekend for us, but we
kept trying to get each other up and ready
to swim. We knew that we were not going to
win but we tried to keep our spirits up."
After Friday, Auburn stood in strong
contention to win the title, ahead of the rest
of the pack by over 150 points.
