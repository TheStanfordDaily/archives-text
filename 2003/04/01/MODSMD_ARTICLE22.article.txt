# No French love for basketball
## 
### 
Right next to Christmas, Super Bowl
Sunday, and happy hour at Hooter's,
the NCAA tournament is truly the most
wonderful time of the year. Every
March I hunker down on my couch with enough
junk food to keep an Oprah Winfrey studio au
dience well stuffed fora month, and I watch hour
after countless hour of college basketball at its
finest. Every year except this one.
Sadly enough, there were two events that pre
vented me from my usual March Madness hiber
nation. The first being the onset of the war in Iraq
which, justifiably, pre-empted many games or
caused them to be switched to ESPN and its affil
iates. The second, on a much happier note, was a
spring break rugby trip to France, where NCAA
basketball gets about as much love as a Bush-
Blair SUV shop.
Shock and awe. It is a phrase that has been re-

peated many times in recent
weeks, but I never felt the true
meaning of it until these past 10
days. I was shocked by the fact
that one of the greatest sporting
events in the world has gone so
unnoticed by so many countries
and awed by the fact that I was a
perfect 16 for 16 in my opening
round bracket (a bracket which

would later be completely shredded, but for one
day 1 was number 1).
While it is hard to do much complaining about
an incredible 10-day trip to the south of France
and Paris, missing the tournament reinforced for
me the un-American-ness of the whole affair. Is
there anything more un-American than skipping
out on one of the most anticipated events of the
sporting year to go play a European sport in the
country that has been our most outspoken oppo
nent of the war?
Yeah, there probably is. Gazpacho, Smart
Cars, and a lack of cold drinks come to mind, but
I'm sure the whole skipping March Madness
thing is up there somewhere. And what a year to
have skipped.
Who could have guessed that Marquette
would be packing its bags for the Final Four while
Arizona and Kentucky were sent packing? And
how exciting is it to finally get to watch Syracuse
freshman phenom Carmello Anthony go head
to-head with Texas point guard T.J. Ford?
And speaking of Texas point guards, March
Madness has provided an additional little treat
for Stanford basketball fans. This year we have
the privilege of watching the return of former
Stanford point guard Jamie Carey fora pair of
games on the Farm, but this time in a Texas uni
form. It is a little known fact that freshman year,
Jamie set her bed on fire while she was sleeping
in it when a lamp accidentally fell and burned her
sheets. Now she's returned, but this time torch
ing other teams, and I for one can't wait to see her
light up the nets at Maples again.
As the basketball season enters into its final
weekend, here are just a few predictions I would
like to propose:
1) Carmello Anthony will realize that that Syra
cuse is not the exotic beach location he was
promised on his recruiting trip, and will abrupt
ly transfer to the University of Miami, thus open-
