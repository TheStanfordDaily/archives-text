# Weaker opponents bring an easy April

### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With six consecutive series wins
after a tough stretch to start the sea
son, the Stanford baseball team has
climbed up to a No. 4 ranking and,
perhaps as a reward, gets the
chance to gather even more mo
mentum as it enters its easiest
month-long schedule in recent
memory.
The Cardinal (18-9, 4-2 Pacific
10 Conference) faces seven differ
ent teams this April, with just one
holding a record more than two
games above the .500 mark and
none in the nation's top 25.
With a combined winning per
centage of .473, Stanford's oppo
nents for the next 30 days barely re
semble the same types of clubs the
Cardinal has played over the first
three months of the year. Stanford
has the added benefit of playing 10
of the month's 15 games at Sunken

Diamond, where it has gone 13-4
this season.
Taking Arizona's 22-10 record
out of the mix, the Cardinal's April
foes have a paltry .434 winning per
centage that should spell bunches
of victories for head coach Mark
Marquess' squad.
First up for Stanford is the Uni
versity of San Francisco, which
comes to Sunken Diamond fora
non-conference contest tonight at 6
p.m. After a solid start to their West
Coast Conference schedule in
March, the Dons (12-19,6-6 WCC)
have lost four of their last five
games as they enter April. After
avenging a 2001 home loss to USF
with a 4-1 win last season at Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinal has won 12
of its last 14 against the Dons, and
that trend isn't likely to change
tonight.
