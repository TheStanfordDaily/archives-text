# Weaker opponents bring an easy April
## 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With six consecutive series wins
after a tough stretch to start the sea
son, the Stanford baseball team has
climbed up to a No. 4 ranking and,
perhaps as a reward, gets the
chance to gather even more mo
mentum as it enters its easiest
month-long schedule in recent
memory.
The Cardinal (18-9, 4-2 Pacific
10 Conference) faces seven differ
ent teams this April, with just one
holding a record more than two
games above the .500 mark and
none in the nation's top 25.
With a combined winning per
centage of .473, Stanford's oppo
nents for the next 30 days barely re
semble the same types of clubs the
Cardinal has played over the first
three months of the year. Stanford
has the added benefit of playing 10
of the month's 15 games at Sunken

Diamond, where it has gone 13-4
this season.
Taking Arizona's 22-10 record
out of the mix, the Cardinal's April
foes have a paltry .434 winning per
centage that should spell bunches
of victories for head coach Mark
Marquess' squad.
First up for Stanford is the Uni
versity of San Francisco, which
comes to Sunken Diamond fora
non-conference contest tonight at 6
p.m. After a solid start to their West
Coast Conference schedule in
March, the Dons (12-19,6-6 WCC)
have lost four of their last five
games as they enter April. After
avenging a 2001 home loss to USF
with a 4-1 win last season at Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinal has won 12
of its last 14 against the Dons, and
that trend isn't likely to change
tonight.
Considering USF's team ERA of


RYAN ELLIS/The Stanford Daily
In addifion to holding the lead for Stanford's all-fime batting average leader at .363, junior out
fielder Sam Fuld ended March with a .509 batting average and an 11 -game hitting streak.
6.22 and the absence of any Dons
starters with ERAs below 4.37, Stan
lord's .322-hitting offense should
least on the below-average Dons
staff tonight. With a 25-run output
over the weekend against Washing
ton and riding on the coattails of ju
nior Carlos Quentin's game-win
ning, two-run homer in the ninth
inning of Sunday's 12-11 win, the
Cardinal seems poised to march
through April and enter the NCAA
Regionals in late May with a run
ning start.
However, Stanford has played
just one mid-week non-conference
game this season and, therefore,

Marquess has used only six starters
— two of them just once. With six
such games coming in the next six
weeks, the second tier of the Stan
ford pitching staff must till more
meaningful roles, both over week
end and in mid-week.
One possible candidate for
tonight's starting spot will be junior
Di ew Erlich, who started one game
earlier this year and threw just one
inning against the Huskies last
weekend, giving him enough fresh
ness to take on the starting duty. Er
lich's experience may put him at the
top of the list, but whoever starts the
game shouldn't expect to last very
long. Marquess uses mid-week con
tests to give his lesser-used pitchers
in-gaine work, and tonight should
be no different.
An intriguing subplot tonight is

the potential return of starter Tim
Cunningham. The senior injured
his hand after his Feb. 15 start
against Fresno State and has not
seen action since. However, he did
warm up in the bullpen in Tempe,
Ariz, against Arizona State, and
the customarily easy-going atmos
phere of mid-week night games
could be an opportune time for
Marquess to send his senior south
paw back out onto the mound
tonight.
Without any Dons star players or
frightening offensive threats, the
Cardinal will look to jump ahead of
the Dons early and lean on its tradi
tional pitching depth to lead it to a
win. Tonight's contest will set the
tone for what could be a very gen
erous April for Stanford, but a loss
could leave it playing the fool.
