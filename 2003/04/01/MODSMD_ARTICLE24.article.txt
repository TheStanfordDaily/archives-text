# Men's tennis wins all four spring break matches
## The 						Card got revenge on Washington, handing the Huskies their first loss. 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most students used spring
break as an opportunity to unwind and
recover from finals, the No. 6 Stanford
men's tennis team had a busy week,
playing four matches in the span of six
days.
The Cardinal (14-2, 2-0 Pacific-10
Conference) stayed on campus to
record routine victories over Harvard
and Brigham Young, then traveled
north to take down Pac-10 foes No. 9
Washington and Oregon. The match
against the Huskies (14-2, 0-2) last Fri
day was an impressive road win over a
highly ranked opponent. It was Wash
ington's first loss of the season after a
14-0 start.
The victory had special significance
for the Cardinal because the Huskies
knocked Stanford out of the NCAA
tournament last year in a bitter 4-3 de
cision at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter.
"We didn't talk much about last
year's loss," associate head coach John
Whitlinger said. "The guys didn't need
to be reminded. We just went out there
and let our rackets do the talking."
ITie match got off to an inauspicious
start for the Cardinal when it lost the dou
bles point. Senior Ail-Americans David
Martin and Scott Lipsky (No. 4 in the na
tion) defeated No. 53 Ari Strasberg and
Alex Vlaski 8-5 on court one. Washington

evened the match when Christoph Pal
manshofer and Peter Sharler beat sopho
more Sam Warburg and junior Carter
Morris 8-5 on court three.
The Cardinal came agonizingly
close to winning the third and deciding
doubles match. Freshmen KC Corkery
and James Pade held a match point, but
ultimately fell 9-8 to Matt Hanlin and
Dillon Ruby.
Stanford roared back to win five of
the six singles matches.
"There were some points at which
we could have hung our heads but
didn't," Whitlinger said. "I was thrilled
with how the guys battled back and
competed."
No. 12 Martin, No. 53 Corkery,
Pade and sophomore Phil Sheng
pulled out three-set wins on courts one,
three, five and six respectively. War
burg picked up the Cardinal's fifth sin
gles victory with a 6-4,6-4 decision over
Palmanshofer. With Stanford leading
3-2, Sheng clinched the match by de
feating Ruby 6-2, 5-7, 7-6.
"Washington is a very good team
and that was a heck of a win for us up
there," Whitlinger said.
The match lasted more than four
hours, causing Stanford to miss its
flight to Eugene to take on Oregon (8-
7, 0-2 Pac-10) the following day. Fhe
team was forced to drive from Seattle to
Eugene, not arriving until close to 1
a.m. on Friday night. The Oregon
match was scheduled for noon on Sat
urday.
The lack of rest didn't faze the Car
dinal as it defeated the Ducks 6-1 to
pick up its second Pac-10 win in as
many days.
Earlier in the week Stanford easily

dispatched Harvard (9-8) 6-1 and BYU
(7-9) 7-0.
"We're very happy with the spring
break," Whitlinger said. "Harvard's not
a had team and BYU was a good match.
Then to travel up north and get two
Pac-10 road wins is tough."
Stanford returns to action this

Wednesday with a 1:30 p.m. exhibition
match against Bath University of Eng
land. This weekend the Cardinal takes
on No. 28 Southern California on Fri
day at 1:30 p.m. and No. 4 UCLA on
Saturday at 1 p.m. The USC-UCLA
weekend is traditionally the most heav
ily attended of the year.
