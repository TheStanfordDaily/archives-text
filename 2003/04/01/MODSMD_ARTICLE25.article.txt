# Men's golf takes 10th at Oregon Invitational
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Golf is a game of consistency.
The ability to repeat the proper
swing mechanics shot after shot
often leads to good scoring. For the
Stanford men's golf team, however,
this year's only consistency has been
inconsistency.
The team's 1 Oth-place finish in a
16-team field at last week's Oregon
Duck Invitational served to further
illustrate this point.
The Cardinal arrived in Eugene,
Ore. hot off a fourth-place showing
at the Cleveland Golf Classic. It was
the team's best performance (and
only top-five finish) since the first
event of the fall season.
The Cardinal needed another
strong performance from all five
players in order to compete in Ore
gon. The 6,854-yard par-72 Eu
gene Country Club is one of the
tougher venues that the team sees
during its season. In addition, the
competition was possibly the most
talented Stanford will face.
"We've had some good fields in
die past," Oregon coach Steve Nosier
said. "But this one very well could be
the best yet with great individuals
and five top-25 teams."
In particular, Nosier was refer
ring to Brandt Snedeker, the na
tion's No. 1 college golfer, according
to the Golfweek/Sagarin rankings.
The senior standout from Vander
bilt has captured three tournament
titles this year and has been named
to the Ben Hogan Award watch list
for 2003. The award is given to the

best college golfer in any division for
the previous 12 months.
Senior Ricky Barnes of Arizona
University would be gunning for
the individual title as well. Barnes
won the 2002 U.S. Amateur Cham
pionship, arguably the most presti
gious amateur event in golf.
In addition to the abundance of
individual talent, the event drew a
host of strong teams, led by Barnes'
No. 7 Wildcats and No. 10 UCLA.
In Stanford's most recent encounter
with die Bruins, the Cardinal could
only admire from afar, as UCLA
cruised to a seven-stroke victory at
the Cleveland.
In an event when the Cardinal
needed to fire on all cylinders, die
squad was instead hamstrung from
the beginning. Senior Jim Seki, who
has led the team in almost every statis
tical category this year, withdrew from
the two-day event with back spasms.
Although junior Blake Mastalir,
who had accompanied the team to
compete individually, filled Seki's
spot, the Cardinal sorely missed the
senior's contributions.
"Jim Seki, our No. 1 player, was
out with back spasms, and that cer
tainly makes a difference in our fin
ish," coach Jeff Mitchell said.
Despite the early setback, the rest
of the team tried to pick up the slack.
Senior George Downing, who has
quietly emerged as one of the team's
top contributors in recent weeks, led
the Stanford squad with a five-over
par performance for three rounds.
He not only matched his score at the

Over the break, the men's golf team took 10th at the Oregon Duck Invita
tional, led by Senior George Downing, who tied for 23rd individually.
Cleveland, but finished in a tie for
28th place overall.
Mastalir, who had his best finish
of the season at last year's Invita
tional, carded a three-round total of
224, landing in a tie for 45th place.
Kevin Blue improved on his per
formance in last year's event, firing
74-75-76 over two davs and finish

ing a shot back of Mastalir.
Senior Ron Won finished at 14
over par, tied for 69th place.
Sophomore Pat Phillips rounded
out the scoring for the Cardinal. An
85 in the opening round made it
hard for the second year player to
recover, and he could only muster
an 85th-place finish at 22 over par.
Meanwhile, Arizona and Wash
ington University tied for top team
honors, and were the only two
teams to break par for the tourna
ment, at six under par. Individually,

John Ellis of Oregon looked com
fortable on his home turf, tying for
first place at nine under par.
However, the real story of the
tournament was Brock Mackenzie
of Washington. In addition to shar
ing medalist honors with Ellis,
Mackenzie tied an NCAA scoring
record with an incredible 12-under
par 60 in his second round.
The Stanford men will rest for
this week, and then play the West
ern Intercollegiate in San Jose, April
7 and 8.
