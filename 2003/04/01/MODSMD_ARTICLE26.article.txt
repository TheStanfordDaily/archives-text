## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Cardinal women's tennis
team remained on campus during
spring break and took care of
some business in both conference
and non-conference play.
Continuing its dominance of
late, the Cardinal won all 27 of its
singles and doubles matches
against its last three opponents.
No. 2 Stanford (13-1, 3-0 Pacific -
10 conference) first demolished an
overmatched UNLV team, 7-0, in
a non-conference matchup at Las
Vegas on March 25.
The Cardinal was spearheaded
by victories from freshman Alice
Barnes at No. 4 singles, who beat

Agnieszka Abram, 6-4,6-0, and ju
nior Emilia Anderson at No. 5 sin
gles, who defeated Cindy Trem
ber, 6-1,6-0. Barnes remains No. 6
in the ITA computer singles rank
ings. The Lady Rebels did not win
a single set in the crushing loss.
Stanford repeated its impres
sive performance on March 27
with a 7-0 victory over No. 10
Washington (12-2, 1-1 Pac-10).
The return home to the Taube
Family Tennis Center saw no
break in Cardinal concentration
against a top conference oppo
nent.

The Cardinal went 7-0 against Washington State including wins from junior
Lauren Barnikow at the No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles spots.
sophomore Erin Burdette, ranked
No. 2 in the country, defeated the
1 lth-ranked team from Washing
ton, 8-6. Burdette then cruised
through her match at No. 3 sin
gles, 6-1, 7-6, while Barnikow re
bounded from a first-set loss to
claim a victory at No. 2 singles, 3-6,
6-2, 6-2.
"Everybody has worked hard
and hasn't just relied on their
teammates to get the job done,"
Barnes said. "We also made sure
that we didn't underestimate any
of our recent opposition and so we
were prepared mentally and phys
ically for each match.
t he sweep of the Washington
schools was completed last Friday
on the Farm, as the Cardinal won
all sets in a 7-0 clubbing of Wash
ington State (7-6,0-2 Pac-10).
Stanford again began the day by
sweeping the doubles point, then
concluded the match with quick
and dominating singles perfor
mances. At No. 1 singles, freshman
Amber Liu easily swept aside Orsol
va Sallaj of Washington State, 6-2,
6-1, while fellow Cougar Zorana
Roganovic was beaten by Stanford
sophomore Story Tweeclie-Yates,
6-2, 6-3 at No. 6 singles.
The two Pac-10 victories high
lighted the Cardinal's strong play
as of late and solidified the team's
position atop the conference.
"We had a lot of respect for the
Washington schools coming in to
those matches," Stanford coach
Lele Forood said. "Each team pre
sented a different 'look' and chal
lenge and I think we handled our
selves very well."
Added Barnikow: "I think as a
team we have played sharp and
smart tennis which enabled us to
win those matches 7-0. The past
three matches were a nice warm
up to get us match-tough for this

weekend since we had a two-week
break due to dead week and fi
nals."
While it was essential that the
team emerged from the long
break with a strong showing, the
practices over the last few weeks
have kept the team sharp.
"We've been working really
hard during practice to improve
our technique and also our dou
bles skills," Liu said. "It's great to
have such a large group of talent
ed players to practice with every
day - it helps push you up to the
next level.
The latest three Cardinal victo
ries are a positive sign for the team,
as spring break was the last long
break the team will be able to enjoy
for the rest of the season.
"I am very pleased with our
team's performance at this junc
ture. We obviously have a very
tough April coming up," Forood
said. "It is always tough coming off"
the two-week layoff with dead
week and finals and seeing how we
are playing, but with three con
vincing wins this past week we
showed we are ready."
The squad now faces tough
conference play as it embarks on a
five-match road trip beginning
this Friday at Southern California.
The Cardinal will then travel to
UCLA on Saturday. Although the
Washington schools were not
weak competition, USC is one of
the premier teams in the country.
Once ranked No. 2 in the nation,
the Trojans are now No. 3 behind
Duke and Stanford.
"I think we will see more fans
and have a more intense atmos
phere," Barnikow said. "In gener
al whenever you play 'away' you
need to block out external factors
and really focus on executing your
shots."
Added Liu: "This weekend it
would be great to step on the court
and play with the confidence that
we have gained from our last few
matches."
