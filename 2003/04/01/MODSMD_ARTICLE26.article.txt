### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Cardinal women's tennis
team remained on campus during
spring break and took care of
some business in both conference
and non-conference play.
Continuing its dominance of
late, the Cardinal won all 27 of its
singles and doubles matches
against its last three opponents.
No. 2 Stanford (13-1, 3-0 Pacific -
10 conference) first demolished an
overmatched UNLV team, 7-0, in
a non-conference matchup at Las
Vegas on March 25.
The Cardinal was spearheaded
by victories from freshman Alice
Barnes at No. 4 singles, who beat

Agnieszka Abram, 6-4,6-0, and ju
nior Emilia Anderson at No. 5 sin
gles, who defeated Cindy Trem
ber, 6-1,6-0. Barnes remains No. 6
in the ITA computer singles rank
ings. The Lady Rebels did not win
a single set in the crushing loss.
Stanford repeated its impres
sive performance on March 27
with a 7-0 victory over No. 10
Washington (12-2, 1-1 Pac-10).
The return home to the Taube
Family Tennis Center saw no
break in Cardinal concentration
against a top conference oppo
nent.
