# Three event victories go to the Card
## 
### RICARDO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With their highest team mark of the season,
the No. 8 Stanford Men's gymnastics team
won half of the individual events at die MPSF
championships in Nebraska this weekend.
Finishing third behind No. 1 Oklahoma
;uid No. 4 California, the Cardinal comfort
ably qualified to the NCAA Championships.
"We upped our score by a good bit," said
junior Dan Gill, who won the high-bar and
took second in the all-around competition.
"Even with some misses, we did pretty well."
So well, in tact, that six of the team's nine
competitors—including the five upperc-lass
man — qualified to the event finals the fol
lowing day.
"We were treating the competition like
Nationals," said sophomore Kelly Lang, who
won the parallel bars competition. "We had
some really high points and we saw a shade
of what we're capable at NCAAs".
The performance of the small squad was
far from perfect, however. Leading rival Cal
ifornia by mere tenths of a point going into

the final event, the Cardinal looked fiat on
the floor exercise as the Golden Bears
slipped into second place. Neither team was
able to contend with a record-setting 223.5
performance by Oklahoma.
Overall, the coach Thom Glielmi was sat
isfied with its performance at this point in the
season.
The squad's lack of depth, which has
plagued the Cardinal all season long, was
barely noticeable as team members took
three of the six individual event finals the
next day, two tenths shy of four a fourth in
dividual title.
"Finals was definitely a highlight," Glielmi
said. "They did better the second night and
showed that they are in good shape for na
tionals."
Senior Cade Raggio, considered one of
the cleanest gymnasts in the country, com
peted in three event finals, finishing second
one the pommel horse by 0.225 points.
Senior Marshall Erwin continued his
dominance on the rings by maintaining a
perfect undefeated record on the event
this season. With two scores of 9.75, Erwin

again beat Oklahoma senior Brett Covey,
who has been the NCAA's top-ranked
ringsman most of the season. With the
win, Erwin now takes the top spot.
"Marshall's a very solid performer and he
did a great routine," Glielmi said. "In fact, I
think the difference between him and the
runner-up was greater than five-hundreths
of a point."
Gill finished two very good nights of com
petition by winning the high bar. The de
fending NCAA vault champion missed his
vault and pommel horse routines tfie first
day of competition, but still managed to com
pete in three event finals.
garnered his first post-season victo
ry by winning the parallel bars competition
with a score of 9.35.
Rounding out Stanford's finalists were se
niors Paul O'Leary on the vault and senior
Matt McLean on the vault and pommel
horse.
The squad finds itself with a top-five
gymnast on every event except for vault
as they prepare for the National Cham
pionships at Temple in two weeks.
