Published authors, the inventor of a spoken
and written language, a rodeo champion and a
race car driver are among the high school se
niors who received a letter of acceptance from
Stanford this week. The University announced
Friday that it has offered admission to 2,250
students to form the ('.lass 0f2007. For the third
straight year, the newest set of admits form

Stanford's most racially diverse class to date.
"The phenomenal achievements and diversi
ty of experiences of our newest admits is truly in
credible," said Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet. "They have enlivened their
classrooms, influenced their schools, embarked
on ground-breaking research and developed
extraordinary talents on athletic fields and in or
chestra pits. Even more exciting is their poten
tial, readiness and enthusiasm to accomplish
much more at Stanford and beyond."
The vast majority of Stanford's 19,000 appli
cants, though, will be left with a letter of rejec
tion. Though the number of applications was
comparable to that of past years, Stanford's
admit rate decreased to 12.1 percent, notice
ably lower than last year's 12.7 percent and the

preceding year's 12.6 percent. Applicant ad
mission was down 70 students from last year's
2,320 students. The standard of academic ex
cellence remained extremely high, according
to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions,
with more than half the accepted applicants
having a 4.0 unweighted grade point average.
Stanford's admits retain the trend of diversi
ty thai the University has established in prior
years. For the second year in a row, the majori
ty of admits are racial minorities. Thirteen per
cent of the admits are African-American, 25
percent are Asian-American, 11 percent are
Mexican-American, 3 percent are Latino / a
and 3 percent are Native American or Native
