The campus will be humming with
the sounds of construction through the
summer and early fall, marking the
completion of several major projects,
including the Branner renovation and
the James H. Clark Center. The Uni
versity is already looking ahead to the
possible impact these additions will
have on the campus in the future.
The Branner renovation is slated for
completion at the end of May, at which
time Student Housing Services will begin
to re-commission the building with new
furniture and other equipment.
"The renovation incorporates fire
and life safety system upgrades, includ
ing new fire sprinklers, [Americans
with Disabilities Act] and accessibility
upgrades, a new elevator, as well as in
frastructure and deferred maintenance
improvements," said Susan Rozakis,
project manager for the Branner seis
mic renovation.
The Branner dining hall will also be
radically changed by the current con
struction. The kitchen is undergoing in
terior wiring and plumbing and cosmet
ic restoration, and structural changes
are being made to the dining hall itself.
"The servery will be entirely differ
ent in terms of food service, utilizing a

marketplace concept similar to the re
cent renovations at Stern and Wilbur
Halls," said Mark Bonino, project man
ager for the Branner kitchen.
"Branner is 80 years old, and this is
its first substantial renovation," said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing Services. "However,
we're trying to conform to the historical
reference Branner has on campus, try
ing to restore it to its original grandeur."
The renovation will also impact the res
idential programs the dorm has to offer.
"Although the Department of Pro
ject Management is overseeing the ren
ovation, Housing Services is the client,
setting the program for what needs to
be done and making sure the project
follows their standards," Whitney said.
"Housing Services will be working
closely with residential education to
make sure the renovations support the
programs they have in mind."
Because the project will add more all
freshman spaces back into the housing
configuration for next year, Soto (in
Wilbur), which was converted into an all
freshman dorm during the current year,
will become a four-class house in the fall.
"Alter the renovation, Branner will
have a slightly smaller number of bed
spaces than in the past," said Director of
Housing Assignment Services Todd
Benson. "The decision was made to try

to increase the size of some of the small
er rooms to give students living there a
bit more space."
According to Whitney, the Brainier
project is on schedule, within budget
and will be ready for occupancy this
summer beginning in mid-June.
Clark. Center construction is expect
ed to culminate on May 30. Located on
Campus Drive, the 146,000-square
foot building will serve as the core facil

ity for the Bio-X program.
According to the Department of Pro
ject Management, Bio-X will create an
environment for both students and fac
ulty based on a "cross-discipline interac
tion and collaboration" between the
University's wide variety of scientific de
partments, including biology, chem
istry, physics and computer science.

The massive, west-campus James H. Clark Center has slowly but surely been progress
ing towards its targeted May 30th completion date. The 146,000-square-foot edifice
is the future home of Stanford's Bio-X research program.
The Clark Center will house re
search facilities for studies in ge
nomics and regenerative medi
cine, as well as for the new De
partment of Bioengineering.
The Lokey Chem-Bio Build
ing, which will also offer facilities
for chemistry and biology pro
grams and 180 research scientists,
has been under construction since
last February and will likely be fin
ished by Sept. 1.
"The building's exterior is
nearing completion and the inte
rior is in varying stages of comple
tion," said Wayne Kelly, project
representative for the Lokey
Chem-Bio Building. "In some
areas sheet rock is being applied
while there are more finished
areas where laboratory casework
is being installed."
The Chem-Bio building is a
collaborative elfort between the
Stanford Department of Project
Management, facilities operations
and the Chemistry and Biology
Departments in conjunction with
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences facilities coordinator.
Smaller construction projects
planned for completion this sum
mer include user lodging for the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and a new boathouse for ath
letics in Redwood City. Cluster
One Row Houses Kappa Sigma,
680 Lomita and Theta Delta Chi
will also be refurbished with fire
and life safety improvements.
"Throughout the design and
construction process, the team on
a typical project will encounter a
variety of obstacles [including] site
limitations, schedule demands or
code restrictions," said Jack
Cleary, director of the Depart
ment of Project Management.
"However, our current projects in
construction have not encoun
tered any significant obstacles that
will impact the final schedule."

setting the program for what needs to
be done and making sure the project
follows their standards," Whitney said.
"Housing Services will be working
closely with residential education to
make sure the renovations support the
programs they have in mind."
Because the project will add more all
freshman spaces back into the housing
configuration for next year, Soto (in
Wilbur), which was converted into an all
freshman dorm during the current year,
will become a four-class house in the fall.
"Alter the renovation, Branner will
have a slightly smaller number of bed
spaces than in the past," said Director of
Housing Assignment Services Todd
Benson. "The decision was made to try

to increase the size of some of the small
er rooms to give students living there a
bit more space."
According to Whitney, the Brainier
project is on schedule, within budget
and will be ready for occupancy this
summer beginning in mid-June.
Clark. Center construction is expect
ed to culminate on May 30. Located on
Campus Drive, the 146,000-square
foot building will serve as the core facil

ity for the Bio-X program.
According to the Department of Pro
ject Management, Bio-X will create an
environment for both students and fac
ulty based on a "cross-discipline interac
tion and collaboration" between the
University's wide variety of scientific de
partments, including biology, chem
istry, physics and computer science.

The massive, west-campus James H. Clark Center has slowly but surely been progress
ing towards its targeted May 30th completion date. The 146,000-square-foot edifice
is the future home of Stanford's Bio-X research program.
The Clark Center will house re
search facilities for studies in ge
nomics and regenerative medi
cine, as well as for the new De
partment of Bioengineering.
The Lokey Chem-Bio Build
ing, which will also offer facilities
for chemistry and biology pro
grams and 180 research scientists,
has been under construction since
last February and will likely be fin
ished by Sept. 1.
"The building's exterior is
nearing completion and the inte
rior is in varying stages of comple
tion," said Wayne Kelly, project
representative for the Lokey
Chem-Bio Building. "In some
areas sheet rock is being applied
while there are more finished
areas where laboratory casework
is being installed."
The Chem-Bio building is a
collaborative elfort between the
Stanford Department of Project
Management, facilities operations
and the Chemistry and Biology
Departments in conjunction with
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences facilities coordinator.
Smaller construction projects
planned for completion this sum
mer include user lodging for the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and a new boathouse for ath
letics in Redwood City. Cluster
One Row Houses Kappa Sigma,
680 Lomita and Theta Delta Chi
will also be refurbished with fire
and life safety improvements.
"Throughout the design and
construction process, the team on
a typical project will encounter a
variety of obstacles [including] site
limitations, schedule demands or
code restrictions," said Jack
Cleary, director of the Depart
ment of Project Management.
"However, our current projects in
construction have not encoun
tered any significant obstacles that
will impact the final schedule."
