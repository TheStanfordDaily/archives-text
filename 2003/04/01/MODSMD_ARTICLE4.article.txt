The campus will be humming with
the sounds of construction through the
summer and early fall, marking the
completion of several major projects,
including the Branner renovation and
the James H. Clark Center. The Uni
versity is already looking ahead to the
possible impact these additions will
have on the campus in the future.
The Branner renovation is slated for
completion at the end of May, at which
time Student Housing Services will begin
to re-commission the building with new
furniture and other equipment.
"The renovation incorporates fire
and life safety system upgrades, includ
ing new fire sprinklers, [Americans
with Disabilities Act] and accessibility
upgrades, a new elevator, as well as in
frastructure and deferred maintenance
improvements," said Susan Rozakis,
project manager for the Branner seis
mic renovation.
The Branner dining hall will also be
radically changed by the current con
struction. The kitchen is undergoing in
terior wiring and plumbing and cosmet
ic restoration, and structural changes
are being made to the dining hall itself.
"The servery will be entirely differ
ent in terms of food service, utilizing a

marketplace concept similar to the re
cent renovations at Stern and Wilbur
Halls," said Mark Bonino, project man
ager for the Branner kitchen.
"Branner is 80 years old, and this is
its first substantial renovation," said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing Services. "However,
we're trying to conform to the historical
reference Branner has on campus, try
ing to restore it to its original grandeur."
The renovation will also impact the res
idential programs the dorm has to offer.
"Although the Department of Pro
ject Management is overseeing the ren
ovation, Housing Services is the client,
setting the program for what needs to
be done and making sure the project
follows their standards," Whitney said.
"Housing Services will be working
closely with residential education to
make sure the renovations support the
programs they have in mind."
Because the project will add more all
freshman spaces back into the housing
configuration for next year, Soto (in
Wilbur), which was converted into an all
freshman dorm during the current year,
will become a four-class house in the fall.
"Alter the renovation, Branner will
have a slightly smaller number of bed
spaces than in the past," said Director of
Housing Assignment Services Todd
Benson. "The decision was made to try

to increase the size of some of the small
er rooms to give students living there a
bit more space."
According to Whitney, the Brainier
project is on schedule, within budget
and will be ready for occupancy this
summer beginning in mid-June.
Clark. Center construction is expect
ed to culminate on May 30. Located on
Campus Drive, the 146,000-square
foot building will serve as the core facil

ity for the Bio-X program.
According to the Department of Pro
ject Management, Bio-X will create an
environment for both students and fac
ulty based on a "cross-discipline interac
tion and collaboration" between the
University's wide variety of scientific de
partments, including biology, chem
istry, physics and computer science.
