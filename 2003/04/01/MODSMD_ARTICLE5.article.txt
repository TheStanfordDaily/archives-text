WASHINGTON, DC-
Today, as the Supreme Court
hears the University of Michigan
cases on affirmative action, Stan
ford's Students of Color Coalition
is marching with thousands of
others to the Court to support

Michigan's policies.
Yesterday, the 30 SOCC mem
bers on the trip took their goals
for improvements in education
into the classroom when they
went out to lour local high schools
in Washington, D.C. to discuss af
firmative action — and to recruit
for Stanford.
Besides fundraising to come to

action in its admissions policies.
SOCC wants special considera
tion to be given to an applicant's
socioeconomic status and to his oi
lier specific ethnicity — for exam
ple, recognition of Pilipinos with
in the Asian racial designation.
They also want to expand the
sweep of Stanford admissions re
cruiters to underrepresented
schools across the country. Stan
ford has received little to no ap
plications from the schools SOCC
visited.
To so ph omore Khalilah
Karim, the head organizer of the
trip and a native of Washington,
D.C., visiting the schools meant
connecting Stanford with stu
dents who are growing up in situ
ations similar to her own child
hood.
"I grew up without a mother or
a father for most of my life, but I
had 11 sisters and brothers to
make up for the two parents that
I lost," Karim said. "In Washing
ton, D.C., most people don't
make it out of the neighborhood,
let alone into college, but at my
public high school, students were
always encouraged to pursue
higher education as a means to es
cape the harsh realities of the
street."
One of the schools that SOCC
members visited yesterday was
The SEED Public Charter
School, the first urban public
charter school in the nation.
Eounded in 1998 by two Prince
ton graduates and headed by a
Stanford alumnus, the school will
have its first graduating class next
year. All of the students in the
school come from inner-city
neighborhoods in Washington,
D.C. Since its founding, students
at the school have become in
creasingly involved in school ac
tivities and have shown dramatic
improvements in academics.

"The SEED school is a primary
example of a school that is full of
potential and serious students,
but receives little attention from
schools like Stanford," Karim
said. "With the support and nur
turing that these students are get
ting, there's no question they
could excel. Without being af
forded equal access to schools like
Stanford, they're being deprived
of opportunities that many other
students are offered."
As at the other schools, SOCC
members talked to high school
classes about affirmative action
and how it impacts them and why
they should work hard and stay fo
cused to increase their chances of
getting into schools like Stanford.
Kerry Richardson, the director
of college and career services at
SEED, said, "I'm very excited to
have had these students come
and talk today. Planning for the
future is crucial now, and I feel
that their presentations went be
yond applying to Stanford fto]
going out to meet their individual
definitions of success."
SOCC members come from all
ethnic communities at Stanford.
They said that they believe that
just by coming to the schools, they
have shown the students that they
too can go to universities like
Stanford.
"There's a problem that needs
to be addressed," said SOCC
member Noriko Boyd, a fresh
man. "Minority students aren't
encouraged to reach for schools
like Stanford and other universi
ties, and I want to show them
that it is possible. They can do it
too, and they should do it if they
want to."
The rapport between the stu
dents at SEED and SOCC mem
bers was clear. In one classroom,
after senior Damon Jones talked
about how he had found new op
portunities to perform with some
big names in hip-hop through
Stanford, the class got him to
freestyle as a student pounded
out a beat on his desk.
