# Court to hear Michigan cases
## 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments
today in two cases that pose the biggest challenge to
the use of affirmative action in university admissions
decisions since the landmark 1978 Bakke case. The
court's decision could potentially bar the use of race
in considering applications — even at private univer
sities like Stanford.
The two cases, Gratz vs. Bollinger et al. and Grut
ter vs. Bollinger et al., have been brought against the
University of Michigan by Jennifer Gratz and Bar
bara Grutter, white women who were denied admis
sion as undergraduate and law school applicants, re
spectively.
In both admissions processes, Michigan openly
uses race as a factor in making admissions decisions.
For undergraduate admissions, students are admit
ted according to a point-based selection index, where
students of certain races or ethnicities are awarded
extra points, as are children of alumni and students
from certain regions from the state, for example. At
the law school, admissions officers have stated that
race is sometimes used as a factor to decide between
candidates.
The plaintiffs have argued that the Michigan
policies cannot be justified under the equal protec-
tion clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and that its policies
violate the criteria for using race
that were established in the
Bakke case, which outlawed the
use of racial quotas but found
that race could be considered as
one of many factors in admitting
students.
Michigan has argued that its
policies do not amount to quotas,
demonstrated by varied repre
sentation of students on color in
its schools. It argues it is justified
in considering race because cre
ating diversity in higher educa
tion constitutes a compelling gov
ernment interest and its use of
race is "narrowly tailored" to that
end, meeting the burden of proof
established in the Bakke case.
While these cases have been
brought against a public universi
ty, private institutions such at Stan
ford have their policies at stake as

well because they receive federal
funding for research and scholar
ships.
When asked it a ruling against
Michigan would force Stanford to
change the role of affirmative ac
tion in it admissions policies,
Pamela karlan, a professor of pub
lic interest law, responded, "The
short answer to that is almost cer
tainly yes."
Karlan explained that, because
Stanford receives federal funds, it
is subject to the same rules con
cerning race discrimination as
public universities under Title IV 7
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions has not changed any
of its policies in anticipation of
the ruling, which will be made in
early summer. But, admissions
officers say that even a ruling
against Michigan would not nec
essarily keep Stanford from con
sidering race in admissions deci
sions.
"Stanford is strongly committed
to educating a community of stu
dents that is diverse in many ways,

and although our efforts to attract
and enroll a diverse class could cer
tainly be hindered if the Supreme
Court rules against the University
of Michigan, so much depends on
the nuances of the ruling," said
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet.
Stanford, along with many
other universities and corpora
tions, has tiled an amicus curiae
brief with the Supreme Court in
support of Michigan's policies.
Legal scholars say there is a
plethora of possible rulings that
would fall in between baring the
use of race in admissions decisions
entirely and deciding that Michi
gan's policies are entirely constitu
tional.
"It is possible that if the Court
invalidates Michigan's admissions
policy, it will do so on narrow
grounds that allow for some race
consciousness in admissions," said
Law Prof. Richard Ford. "Such a
result would be similar to the
Court's reapportionment cases in
which race conscious redistricting
was limited but not invalidated.

There and in other contexts, such
as Bakke, the Court held that the
use of race was subject to 'strict
scrutiny* but that it could survive
such scrutiny if sufficiently refined
and necessary for compelling gov
ernmental ends."
Stanford does not use a quanti
tative method for evaluating appli
cants similar to Michigan's under
graduate admissions policy, and
therefore a ruling against Michi
gan's specific policy would not nec
essarily deem Stanford's policy un
constitutional.
Ford added that other potential
outcomes would be for the Court
to further define what types of race
consciousness are acceptable in
making admissions decisions or
for the Court to overturn Bakke
and say that it is never constitu
tional to consider race.
Both Karlan and Ford said that
they believe the Michigan policies
to be constitutional.
"The Constitution permits race
consciousness when it serves a
compelling purpose," Ford said.
"Diversity in education is such a

compelling purpose. Michigan's
policy is not a quota system as pro
hibited under Bakke; instead it is a
limited consideration of race in
conjunction with other factors —
exactly what the Bakke opinion al
lows."
He added that, because of
Michigan's size and limited bud
get, it would be diflicult for such
state schools to use the more qual
itative methods of admitting stu
dents that schools like Stanford
use.
"A legal requirement that, in
order to consider race in admis
sions, all schools must devote the
resources to admissions that small
er elite and wealthy universities
such as Stanford do could effec
tively 'price' many schools out of
affirmative action," Ford said. "1
do not believe the Constitution
mandates this result."
The Law School will be running
a live feed of the arguments this
morning at 9:15 a.m., and a coali
tion of student groups will hold a
rally in support of affirmative ac
tion at noon in White Plaza.

policy, it will do so on narrow
grounds that allow for some race
consciousness in admissions," said
Law Prof. Richard Ford. "Such a
result would be similar to the
Court's reapportionment cases in
which race conscious redistricting
was limited but not invalidated.

There and in other contexts, such
as Bakke, the Court held that the
use of race was subject to 'strict
scrutiny* but that it could survive
such scrutiny if sufficiently refined
and necessary for compelling gov
ernmental ends."
Stanford does not use a quanti
tative method for evaluating appli
cants similar to Michigan's under
graduate admissions policy, and
therefore a ruling against Michi
gan's specific policy would not nec
essarily deem Stanford's policy un
constitutional.
Ford added that other potential
outcomes would be for the Court
to further define what types of race
consciousness are acceptable in
making admissions decisions or
for the Court to overturn Bakke
and say that it is never constitu
tional to consider race.
Both Karlan and Ford said that
they believe the Michigan policies
to be constitutional.
"The Constitution permits race
consciousness when it serves a
compelling purpose," Ford said.
"Diversity in education is such a

compelling purpose. Michigan's
policy is not a quota system as pro
hibited under Bakke; instead it is a
limited consideration of race in
conjunction with other factors —
exactly what the Bakke opinion al
lows."
He added that, because of
Michigan's size and limited bud
get, it would be diflicult for such
state schools to use the more qual
itative methods of admitting stu
dents that schools like Stanford
use.
"A legal requirement that, in
order to consider race in admis
sions, all schools must devote the
resources to admissions that small
er elite and wealthy universities
such as Stanford do could effec
tively 'price' many schools out of
affirmative action," Ford said. "1
do not believe the Constitution
mandates this result."
The Law School will be running
a live feed of the arguments this
morning at 9:15 a.m., and a coali
tion of student groups will hold a
rally in support of affirmative ac
tion at noon in White Plaza.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments
today in two cases that pose the biggest challenge to
the use of affirmative action in university admissions
decisions since the landmark 1978 Bakke case. The
court's decision could potentially bar the use of race
in considering applications — even at private univer
sities like Stanford.
The two cases, Gratz vs. Bollinger et al. and Grut
ter vs. Bollinger et al., have been brought against the
University of Michigan by Jennifer Gratz and Bar
bara Grutter, white women who were denied admis
sion as undergraduate and law school applicants, re
spectively.
In both admissions processes, Michigan openly
uses race as a factor in making admissions decisions.
For undergraduate admissions, students are admit
ted according to a point-based selection index, where
students of certain races or ethnicities are awarded
extra points, as are children of alumni and students
from certain regions from the state, for example. At
the law school, admissions officers have stated that
race is sometimes used as a factor to decide between
candidates.
The plaintiffs have argued that the Michigan
policies cannot be justified under the equal protec-
tion clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and that its policies
violate the criteria for using race
that were established in the
Bakke case, which outlawed the
use of racial quotas but found
that race could be considered as
one of many factors in admitting
students.
Michigan has argued that its
policies do not amount to quotas,
demonstrated by varied repre
sentation of students on color in
its schools. It argues it is justified
in considering race because cre
ating diversity in higher educa
tion constitutes a compelling gov
ernment interest and its use of
race is "narrowly tailored" to that
end, meeting the burden of proof
established in the Bakke case.
While these cases have been
brought against a public universi
ty, private institutions such at Stan
ford have their policies at stake as

well because they receive federal
funding for research and scholar
ships.
When asked it a ruling against
Michigan would force Stanford to
change the role of affirmative ac
tion in it admissions policies,
Pamela karlan, a professor of pub
lic interest law, responded, "The
short answer to that is almost cer
tainly yes."
Karlan explained that, because
Stanford receives federal funds, it
is subject to the same rules con
cerning race discrimination as
public universities under Title IV 7
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions has not changed any
of its policies in anticipation of
the ruling, which will be made in
early summer. But, admissions
officers say that even a ruling
against Michigan would not nec
essarily keep Stanford from con
sidering race in admissions deci
sions.
"Stanford is strongly committed
to educating a community of stu
dents that is diverse in many ways,

and although our efforts to attract
and enroll a diverse class could cer
tainly be hindered if the Supreme
Court rules against the University
of Michigan, so much depends on
the nuances of the ruling," said
Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet.
Stanford, along with many
other universities and corpora
tions, has tiled an amicus curiae
brief with the Supreme Court in
support of Michigan's policies.
Legal scholars say there is a
plethora of possible rulings that
would fall in between baring the
use of race in admissions decisions
entirely and deciding that Michi
gan's policies are entirely constitu
tional.
"It is possible that if the Court
invalidates Michigan's admissions
policy, it will do so on narrow
grounds that allow for some race
consciousness in admissions," said
Law Prof. Richard Ford. "Such a
result would be similar to the
Court's reapportionment cases in
which race conscious redistricting
