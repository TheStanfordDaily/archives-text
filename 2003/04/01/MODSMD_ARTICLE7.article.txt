# Despite busyness, students find time for...
## Spirituality on the farm 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With an estimated 80 percent of
Stanford students aligning them
selves with some religion, campus
religious activities are abundant and
diverse. In addition to the approxi
mately 2,000 students attending
weekly on-campus religious ser
vices, hundreds more go off-cam
pus for spiritual gatherings. And,
many students may si ill consider
themselves spiritual even if they
don't often participate in formal re
ligious ceremonies.
"The level of religiosity and spir
ituality is quite high, 1 believe, even
among those not regularly attend
ing services," said Dean for Reli
gious Life Scotty McLennan. "Often
I hear people say, 'I'm spiritual, but
I'm not religious,' or explain that
they attend or are involved in for
mal religious activities only a few
times a year.''
I lowever, students' full academ
ic and social lives may prevent even
particularly religious students from
making even spiritual considera
tions a big part of their lives — often
making Stanford appear to be a less
religious campus than it actually is.
"I think die busyness and the hec
tic lifestyle here at Stanford distracts
students from taking the next step
and seeking to answer all the very im
portant questions they may have
about life and about God," explained
management science and engineer

ing doctoral candidate Christopher
I lan, a leader of the Asian Baptist
Student Koinania.
Han related this perception to
his own life experience, mentioning
how school pressure and grade con
cerns prevented him from explor
ing issues related to religion during
his undergraduate years.
Despite time pressures, some
students choose to make religion in
tegral to their daily lives, and the
leaders of campus religious organi
zations say there are many ways to
learn more about different faiths, al
though not necessarily through for
mal opportunities.
Senior Sumir Meghani, who
helped organize a recent conference
called "Exploring Religious Bound
aries and Conflicts," noted that uni
versity classes might teach the theory
and history behind meditation, but
not how to meditate.
For students who want to ex
plore religious issues through Uni
versity-organized options, the Of
fice for Religious Life has organized
grief and bereavement groups and
t lie "What Matters to Me and Why"
series, as well as several multifaith
study series.
In the programs from the Office
of Religious Life, a goal of indusive
ness is furthered through the gener
al multifaith approach to the wide
variety of pn igrams offered.
"In some cases, the lack of par
ticularistic language is helpful and
makes [students] feel welcome,"
explained Senior Associate Dean
for Religious Life Rabbi Patricia
Karlin-Neumann. "In other cases,
students who are rooted in their
religious communities appreciate
more particularity."
For these students, student reli
gious groups may often play a major
role in their experience of religion at
Stanford, allowing them to leel like
part of a close-knit spiritual commu
nity. For example, Hillel offers shab
bat services every week and study
breaks during Hannukah.
Jean Chow, who is active in
Christian student religious life at
Stanford, explained, "The purpose,
at least for Christian groups on cam
pus, is to provide a safe community
for believers to come and worship
God and to meet in fellowship with
other Christians."
According to Meghani, the
Hindu Students Council wel
comes people of all faiths to its
events, such as "diwali puja," the
Festival of Lights, and "holi," the
festival of colors.
"We love having non-Hindus
come to our events and learn and
share with us," he said.
In the Muslim community, Islam
Awareness Week, which begins next
week, seeks to educate the commu
nity about Islam and the issues in
the Muslim world. During Ra
madan, the Islamic Society at Stan
ford hosts iftar dinners that are
open to the community.
The openness of religious
groups may be instrumental in
providing students with oppor
tunities to question and explore
faith, especially when they first
come to Stanford. Reverend
Joanne Marie Sanders, associate
dean for religious life, said that
new students may often find
their greater independence and
the wider diversity of views on

campus as a challenge to previ
ous beliefs.
Chow added, "I definitely think
college presents challenges in a reli
gious student's life, because every
thing is so different."
Looking back to freshman year,
Meghani described how the absence
of his family to support and share his
faith led him to explore it indepen
dendy.
"Like many of my peers, I felt the
need to learn more about my tradi
tion and religion and spirituality in
general," he said.
For those who do end up active
ly pursuing their faiths, tolerance
from students seems to be high in
die Stanford community.
David Lin, who is active in Stan
ford's Buddhist community and
worked with Meghani on the con
ference, noticed a lot of confusion
about what it means to belong to a
particular religion. He said that
many students accept certain core

tenets, but they object to religious
practices that they view as narrow
minded.
Jeannie Field, a member of die
Christian group Inter Varsity, ex
plained, "I think there is a high de
gree of respect for most religions, in
that most people do not object to
others practicing their beliefs. Mow
ever, when those beliefs come in the
form of declarative statements,
watch out."
Because of this, it can often be dif
ficult for Stanford students to share
their faiths outside of their religious
groups.
Lin noted, "I don't think reli
gions are a popular topic to dis
cuss namely because it does need
to have a special context where
people feel safe and secure in
sharing their private beliefs and
where they won't be laughed at or
immediately discounted. Creating
that space, however, is definitely
not easy."

management science and engineer

ing doctoral candidate Christopher
I lan, a leader of the Asian Baptist
Student Koinania.
Han related this perception to
his own life experience, mentioning
how school pressure and grade con
cerns prevented him from explor
ing issues related to religion during
his undergraduate years.
Despite time pressures, some
students choose to make religion in
tegral to their daily lives, and the
leaders of campus religious organi
zations say there are many ways to
learn more about different faiths, al
though not necessarily through for
mal opportunities.
Senior Sumir Meghani, who
helped organize a recent conference
called "Exploring Religious Bound
aries and Conflicts," noted that uni
versity classes might teach the theory
and history behind meditation, but
not how to meditate.
For students who want to ex
plore religious issues through Uni
versity-organized options, the Of
fice for Religious Life has organized
grief and bereavement groups and
t lie "What Matters to Me and Why"
series, as well as several multifaith
study series.
In the programs from the Office
of Religious Life, a goal of indusive
ness is furthered through the gener
al multifaith approach to the wide
variety of pn igrams offered.
"In some cases, the lack of par
ticularistic language is helpful and
makes [students] feel welcome,"
explained Senior Associate Dean
for Religious Life Rabbi Patricia
Karlin-Neumann. "In other cases,
students who are rooted in their
religious communities appreciate
more particularity."
For these students, student reli
gious groups may often play a major
role in their experience of religion at
Stanford, allowing them to leel like
part of a close-knit spiritual commu
nity. For example, Hillel offers shab
bat services every week and study
breaks during Hannukah.
Jean Chow, who is active in
Christian student religious life at
Stanford, explained, "The purpose,
at least for Christian groups on cam
pus, is to provide a safe community
for believers to come and worship
God and to meet in fellowship with
other Christians."
According to Meghani, the
Hindu Students Council wel
comes people of all faiths to its
events, such as "diwali puja," the
Festival of Lights, and "holi," the
festival of colors.
"We love having non-Hindus
come to our events and learn and
share with us," he said.
In the Muslim community, Islam
Awareness Week, which begins next
week, seeks to educate the commu
nity about Islam and the issues in
the Muslim world. During Ra
madan, the Islamic Society at Stan
ford hosts iftar dinners that are
open to the community.
The openness of religious
groups may be instrumental in
providing students with oppor
tunities to question and explore
faith, especially when they first
come to Stanford. Reverend
Joanne Marie Sanders, associate
dean for religious life, said that
new students may often find
their greater independence and
the wider diversity of views on

campus as a challenge to previ
ous beliefs.
Chow added, "I definitely think
college presents challenges in a reli
gious student's life, because every
thing is so different."
Looking back to freshman year,
Meghani described how the absence
of his family to support and share his
faith led him to explore it indepen
dendy.
"Like many of my peers, I felt the
need to learn more about my tradi
tion and religion and spirituality in
general," he said.
For those who do end up active
ly pursuing their faiths, tolerance
from students seems to be high in
die Stanford community.
David Lin, who is active in Stan
ford's Buddhist community and
worked with Meghani on the con
ference, noticed a lot of confusion
about what it means to belong to a
particular religion. He said that
many students accept certain core

tenets, but they object to religious
practices that they view as narrow
minded.
Jeannie Field, a member of die
Christian group Inter Varsity, ex
plained, "I think there is a high de
gree of respect for most religions, in
that most people do not object to
others practicing their beliefs. Mow
ever, when those beliefs come in the
form of declarative statements,
watch out."
Because of this, it can often be dif
ficult for Stanford students to share
their faiths outside of their religious
groups.
Lin noted, "I don't think reli
gions are a popular topic to dis
cuss namely because it does need
to have a special context where
people feel safe and secure in
sharing their private beliefs and
where they won't be laughed at or
immediately discounted. Creating
that space, however, is definitely
not easy."

Christopher Han, a leader of the Asian Baptist Student Koinania, speaks in
Terman about his religious convictions and practices.
With an estimated 80 percent of
Stanford students aligning them
selves with some religion, campus
religious activities are abundant and
diverse. In addition to the approxi
mately 2,000 students attending
weekly on-campus religious ser
vices, hundreds more go off-cam
pus for spiritual gatherings. And,
many students may si ill consider
themselves spiritual even if they
don't often participate in formal re
ligious ceremonies.
"The level of religiosity and spir
ituality is quite high, 1 believe, even
among those not regularly attend
ing services," said Dean for Reli
gious Life Scotty McLennan. "Often
I hear people say, 'I'm spiritual, but
I'm not religious,' or explain that
they attend or are involved in for
mal religious activities only a few
times a year.''
I lowever, students' full academ
ic and social lives may prevent even
particularly religious students from
making even spiritual considera
tions a big part of their lives — often
making Stanford appear to be a less
religious campus than it actually is.
"I think die busyness and the hec
tic lifestyle here at Stanford distracts
students from taking the next step
and seeking to answer all the very im
portant questions they may have
about life and about God," explained
management science and engineer

ing doctoral candidate Christopher
I lan, a leader of the Asian Baptist
Student Koinania.
