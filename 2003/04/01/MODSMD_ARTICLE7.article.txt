# Despite busyness, students find time for...
## Spirituality on the farm 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With an estimated 80 percent of
Stanford students aligning them
selves with some religion, campus
religious activities are abundant and
diverse. In addition to the approxi
mately 2,000 students attending
weekly on-campus religious ser
vices, hundreds more go off-cam
pus for spiritual gatherings. And,
many students may si ill consider
themselves spiritual even if they
don't often participate in formal re
ligious ceremonies.
"The level of religiosity and spir
ituality is quite high, 1 believe, even
among those not regularly attend
ing services," said Dean for Reli
gious Life Scotty McLennan. "Often
I hear people say, 'I'm spiritual, but
I'm not religious,' or explain that
they attend or are involved in for
mal religious activities only a few
times a year.''
I lowever, students' full academ

particularly religious students from
making even spiritual considera
tions a big part of their lives â€” often
making Stanford appear to be a less
religious campus than it actually is.
"I think die busyness and the hec
tic lifestyle here at Stanford distracts
students from taking the next step
and seeking to answer all the very im
portant questions they may have
about life and about God," explained
management science and engineer

ing doctoral candidate Christopher
I lan, a leader of the Asian Baptist
Student Koinania.
Han related this perception to
his own life experience, mentioning
how school pressure and grade con
cerns prevented him from explor
ing issues related to religion during
his undergraduate years.
Despite time pressures, some
students choose to make religion in
tegral to their daily lives, and the
leaders of campus religious organi
zations say there are many ways to
learn more about different faiths, al
though not necessarily through for
mal opportunities.
Senior Sumir Meghani, who
helped organize a recent conference
called "Exploring Religious Bound
aries and Conflicts," noted that uni
versity classes might teach the theory
and history behind meditation, but
not how to meditate.
For students who want to ex
plore religious issues through Uni
versity-organized options, the Of
fice for Religious Life has organized
grief and bereavement groups and
t lie "What Matters to Me and Why"
series, as well as several multifaith
study series.
In the programs from the Office
of Religious Life, a goal of indusive
ness is furthered through the gener
al multifaith approach to the wide
variety of pn igrams offered.
