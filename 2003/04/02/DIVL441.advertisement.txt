Art History
107A. Islam and Arabic Culture in the Medieval Mediterranean, 650-1150 C.E. - Introduction to the
medieval Mediterranean world through the interactions between Christian, Jewish and Islamic/Arabic culture,
paying particular attention to the ways and places in which "east" and "west" meet. While primarily concerned
with visual culture, an interdisciplinary approach will be used in confronting and evaluating both our material
and scholarship's varied approaches to it. TTH 12:45-2:00, Art 4, Professor Cynthia Robinson.
2078. Devotional Imagery in the 14th Century - The period of time encompassed by the late 13th and the
late 15th centuries evokes either beginnings (of the Italian "Renaissance," for example) or finalities (i.e., the
end of the "Middle Ages" ala Huizinga). Some recent scholarship concerned with the "devotional image" ques
tions this periodization and geographical compartmentalization vis a vis Italy and the North but, for the most
part, ignores the rest of the Mediterranean world. Iberia, the "Land of Three Religions," provides an excellent
testing ground for many theories, both current and past, concerning image production and reception in the late
Medieval/early "Renaissance" world. Explores the idea of the "devotional image" in a context for which Muslim
and Jewish, as well as Christian, concerns must be taken into account. W 3:15-5:05, Artlo3,
Professor Cynthia Robinson.
144A. Modernism and Design, 1890-1945 - A study of design for theater, industry and the home including

2078. Devotional Imagery in the 14th Century - The period of time encompassed by the late 13th and the
late 15th centuries evokes either beginnings (of the Italian "Renaissance," for example) or finalities (i.e., the
end of the "Middle Ages" ala Huizinga). Some recent scholarship concerned with the "devotional image" ques
tions this periodization and geographical compartmentalization vis a vis Italy and the North but, for the most
part, ignores the rest of the Mediterranean world. Iberia, the "Land of Three Religions," provides an excellent
testing ground for many theories, both current and past, concerning image production and reception in the late
Medieval/early "Renaissance" world. Explores the idea of the "devotional image" in a context for which Muslim
and Jewish, as well as Christian, concerns must be taken into account. W 3:15-5:05, Artlo3,
Professor Cynthia Robinson.
