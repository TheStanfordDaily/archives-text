In memory of
Sadie Zarcone (nee Niehols)
May 1994 — March 2003
Basset Hound, Friend,
Likeness, Punchline
When the Bunnies began in
1999, Sadie sewed as the
inspiration and model for the
Dog. Though her mortal body
is gone, her spirit will remain
on this earth so long as we have
spate to 112 ill and a joke to tell.
In lieu of flowers, the family asks
that you crack a joke and pet a dog.
