## Troops near Baghdad; battles fought on land 
### 
KARBAIA (AP) —Army ground
forces attacked Republican Guard
units yesterday near Karbala, scarce
ly 50 miles from Baghdad, part of
around-the-clock combat pointing to
ward an assault on the capital. An
American POW was rescued in Iraq.
Defense officials said Army units at
tacked elements of the Medina Division
of the Republican Guard in the clash
near Karbala, hitting an elite Iraqi force
weakened by heavy air bombardment
over several days.
Pfc. Jessica Lynch, a 19-year-old
supply clerk from Palestine, W. Va.,
was the POW freed after 12 days in
Iraqi hands.
fhe developments unfolded as huge
explosions rocked Baghdad, Saddam
Hussein's seat of power and the site of
repeated bombing in the two weeks of
the war. Plumes of white smoke rose
from the southern end of the Old
Palace on the west bank of the Tigris
River, home to a camp for the Republi
can Guard.
Hussein summoned his country —
via a spokesman — to a "jihad," or holy
war, against the invaders. But Ameri
can and British officials used the occa
sion to raise fresh doubts about the fate
of a man seen in public only on video
tape since the war began.
The attack on forces near Karbala
marked the first major ground battle
against Hussein's Republican Guard,
and capped a day of aggressive Ameri
can and British military actions.
Marines staged a nighttime raid on
Nasiriyah, a column of amphibious
assault vehicles rolling into town

under a moonless sky — and finding
Iraqis had abandoned a huge, walled
police compound.
In Basra, a city of 1.3 million, war
planes dropped 500-pound and 1,000-
pound laser-guided bombs on an Iraqi
intelligence complex in an effort to dis
lodge die-hard defenders who have
kept British forces at bay for days.
Despite the summons to jihad is
sued in Hussein's name, British offi
cials said two would-be suicide attack
ers had turned themselves in to troops
in Umm Qasr. "They didn't want to be
suicide bombers any more," said
British Col. Steve Cox. "We are accom
modating them."
Other British and American officials
said there was a growing list of exam
ples of Iraqi civilians shedding their ini
tial reluctance to assist forces fighting
Hussein's regime.
Troops worked to win the trust of
Iraqis, keeping in mind that many still
recall promises of liberation in the 1991
Gulf War, only to find Hussein's forces
returned unhindered when coalition
forces withdrew.
Lights went on for the first time in
weeks in the port city of Umm Qasr,
firmly under British control. Some
British forces in southern Iraq were
wearing berets in public, shedding their
warlike helmets in areas deemed safe.
The U.S. and British bombing was
constant — large explosions reverber
ated around Baghdad — punctuated
by small ground engagements an a
sweeping arc to the south of the capital.
Marines claimed to have killed at
least 80 Iraqi soldiers and taken

dozens of prisoners in lighting near
Diwaniyah. According to reports
from the field, troops on a reconnais
sance mission found fortified Iraqi
positions along a line leading several
miles to the city.
Marines took no chances with pris
oners, bulldozing a pit, then surround
ing it with barbed wire. Before a POW
was put inside, he was blindfolded and
searched, one Marine pinning down
his feet, another his arms, and a third
pointing an M-16 rifle at his head.
One day after American forces
killed at least seven civilians at a
checkpoint, Iraqi officials said U.S.
Apache helicopters attacked a neigh
borhood in the central Iraq city of
Hillah, killing 33 people and injuring

more than 300.
The U.S. Central Command said it
was investigating, but said no Apach
es could have been involved in any
incident.
At the Pentagon, Rumsfeld and
Myers, the nation's top uniformed offi
cer, defended the American battle plan,
which has sparked controversy.
"Forces are coming (toward Bagh
dad) from the north, they're coming
from the south and they're coming
from the west, and the circle is closing"
on Hussein, Rumsfeld said.
Hussein has made no known public
appearances since March 19, when
American missiles hit a complex in
Baghdad where he and his two sons
were believed to have been sleeping.

miles to the city.
Marines took no chances with pris
oners, bulldozing a pit, then surround
ing it with barbed wire. Before a POW
was put inside, he was blindfolded and
searched, one Marine pinning down
his feet, another his arms, and a third
pointing an M-16 rifle at his head.
One day after American forces
killed at least seven civilians at a
checkpoint, Iraqi officials said U.S.
Apache helicopters attacked a neigh
borhood in the central Iraq city of
Hillah, killing 33 people and injuring

more than 300.
The U.S. Central Command said it
was investigating, but said no Apach
es could have been involved in any
incident.
At the Pentagon, Rumsfeld and
Myers, the nation's top uniformed offi
cer, defended the American battle plan,
which has sparked controversy.
"Forces are coming (toward Bagh
dad) from the north, they're coming
from the south and they're coming
from the west, and the circle is closing"
on Hussein, Rumsfeld said.
Hussein has made no known public
appearances since March 19, when
American missiles hit a complex in
Baghdad where he and his two sons
were believed to have been sleeping.
