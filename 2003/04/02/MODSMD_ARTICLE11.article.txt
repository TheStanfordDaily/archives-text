SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Five passengers on a
flight from Tokyo were cleared of a mystery illness
from Asia after the jetliner was stopped on the tarmac
in what first looked like a public health emergency.
American Airlines Flight 128 from Tokyo to San
Jose stopped short of the gate and was flanked by am
bulances after the airline alerted the San Jose airport
about the scare, said Todd Burke, an airline
spokesman. Alter 10 hours in the air, the 125 passen
gers and 14 crew members waited as health officials in
surgical masks came on board.
But when doctors had cleared all five people from
the plane hours later, passengers began to express
theirs fears of the severe acute respiratory syndrome,
or SARS, which has killed over 60 people worldwide.
"It took a tremendous amount of resources to do
this," said Dr. Karen Smith, the Santa Clara County
health officer who boarded the plane. "If every flight
from Asia has someone coughing on it and has to go
through the same procedure, I just don't see how
that's feasible."
Doctors cleared two passengers on board and sent
three others to a hospital. Those three didn't appear
ill and were quickly discharged, said Tad Hurst, an
FR doctor at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
Of primary concern was whether they had spent
time in areas where SARS outbreaks have occurred —
in mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Hanoi, Vietnam. Initial reports were that four of the
five who reported feeling sick may have boarded in
Tokyo after flying from Hong Kong, said Joy Alexiou,
a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County Public
Health Department.
More than 1,600 cases of the illness have been re
ported so far worldwide, including 69 cases in the
United States. None ol the U.S. cases have been fatal.
Last week, evidence surfaced that SARS can be
caught on airplanes. Hong Kong authorities said sev
eral tourists on a China Air flight caught the disease
after flying with another SARS-infected passenger.
