United States. Although one's race does not
dictate one's view — and this is part of what
diversity on [a university] campus teaches
— race, ethnicity and national origin do
contribute to one's experiences and oppor
tunities in life, adding relevant perspec
tives." This statement, in support of affir
mative action, comes from the amicus curi
ae brief filed on behalf of the University of
Michigan by Stanford, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, E.I. DuPont de
Nemours and Company, International
Business Machines Corp., the NaUonal
Academy of Sciences, the National Acade
my of Engineering and the Nadonal Action
Council for Minorities in Engineering.
The brief is one of more than 100 that
the U.S. Supreme Court received regard
ing the two affirmative action cases that
the Court has agreed to review. Argu
ments for the cases were heard yesterday,
as an estimated crowd of 5,000 to 7,000
people gathered outside.
The cases have received a lot of media
attention because of the subject — it is the
first time in 25 years that the court has
agreed to review a case dealing with the
use of affirmative action in university ad
missions decisions — and because of the
significant impact that the decisions will
have on admissions policies, at both pub
lic and private universities, including
Stanford.
Stanford has made clear its commitment
to diversity, both in its words and through
its actions. In a presentation to the Faculty
Senate in January, University President
John Hennessy said that affirmative acuon
is an appropriate and necessary measure to
achieve diversity. ITie majority of the newly
admitted Class 0f2007 is minority students;
the Class of 2006 was the first in the history
of the University in which students of color
constituted a majority. That Stanford has
filed a brief in support of the University of
Michigan is yet another indication that the
University is committed to campus diversi
ty
A racially and ethnically diverse student
body is essential to a student's academic ex
perience because learning is not confined to
the classroom. Much of what students learn
conies from die interaction that they have
with one another, and that kind of learning
is gready enriched by the varying perspec
tives that students from different cultures
can offer one another. As the opening quote
illustrates, a student's race or ethnic back
ground contributes to but does not solely
define his or her views.

At Stanford, a university whose mission
includes the training and developing of fu
ture leaders, a diverse student body is nec
essary. In an increasingly globalizing world,
it is an inescapable fact that leaders need to
interact with and understand those people
who come from different racial, ethnic and
cultural backgrounds. As suited in the brief
filed by Stanford, "racial and ethnic diversi
ty in higher education significandy con
tributes to students' ability to live and work
together and to communicate across racial
boundaries — skills of great importance in
our increasingly heterogeneous world."
Stanford and MI T, as two leading uni
versities in the fields of science and engi
neering, chose to file a separate brief in
stead of joining one filed by other universi
ties. They wanted to "dispel the view that di
versity in science and engineering educa
tion is any less important than in the hu
manities and liberal arts."
In making the argument for affirmative
action, Stanford and MIT assert that diver
sity, including racial and ethnic diversity, is
essential to the advancement of science and
engineering and that minority students are
more underrepresented in science and en
gineering fields than in others.
Amicus curiae briefs, which literally
means "friend of the court," can be filed by
people and by groups who do not represent
a party in litigation but who believe that the
court's decision may affect their interests.
While these briefs have no legal power in
court, they are not unnoticed by members
of the court. That world-class institutions
like Stanford have filed such briefs is an in
dication of the importance and significance
of the cases before die court.
DuPont and IBM, in joining Stanford
and MIT in filing the brief, emphasized that
a racially and ethnically diverse workforce is
essential to their strength and success. Such
corporations rely on colleges and universi
ties in recruiting and hiring employees.
Should university student bodies become
less diverse, there will be a similar effect on
America's workforce. Again, the leaders of
today and tomorrow need to be trained to
deal with global issues and need an under
standing of the diverse cultures that exist in
our world.
It would be an understatement to say
that the decisions made by the Supreme
Court would only affect the face of universi
ty campuses. If the consideration of race
and ethnicity is banned from university ad
missions policies, it will greatly transform
the society we live in. As students at Sum
to rd, we benefit from learning and living in
a racially and ethnically diverse campus. We
are better students and we will be able to
better contribute to society because of it.
