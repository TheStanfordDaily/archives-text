## Real World Stanford 
### 
On Monday, many high
school seniors found
out whether they had
been accepted into
Stanford, once again reminding us
about college admissions and the
tricky business of deciding who
gets in — and who doesn't. The
way that many colleges figure out
admissions decisions are often
kept secret and well-guarded, ex
cept for perhaps one well-known
policy — affirmative action. This
policy has remained a hot topic in
the academic arena for the past
couple years. Many people have
tried to come up with viable alter
natives to the policy, but most have
been inadequate.
When looking for such alterna
tives, I picked up a distinguished
and trustworthy source: the TV
Guide. Sure enough, television
came through and provided me
with a solution to the question of
how to replace affirmative action
policies — reality-based shows.
Reality shows are the hot thing
in the television world, and I believe
the same formulas used in these
programs can easily work in the col
lege admissions world. None of
these shows use race as a factor for
who wins in the end. No, they focus
on more concrete factors such as
how good-looking a person is, or
how quickly they can swallow a
horse penis.
Below I present three different
ways in which Stanford can adopt
reality show formulas and apply
them to admissions:
•"Survivor VII: Stanford" —
"Survivor" is the show that started
the current reality TV craze. And its
motto of "outwit, outplay, outlast"
would be a perfect substitute for
Stanford's current "outsmart, out
rank, outrace" policy. The show
takes 16 people from all walks of life
and sticks them in a remote area

where they are forced to live to
gether. (Sound familiar?) The
added twist is that they perform
various physical and mental chal
lenges during this time and vote
one person off each week.
Some ideas for challenges can
be: waiting in line at the post of
fice, using the Shopping Express
in an efficient manner and scoop
ing the rock-hard ice cream in

FloMo Dining.
In Stanford's
version, we take all
the prospective
freshmen and put
them in groups of
16 people. They
live in a remote
area (preferably
FroSoCo), partici-

pate in challenges and vote people
off until there are only two people
left. That would mean 12.5 percent
gain admission, which approxi
mates the current acceptance rate.
The losers get a gift basket and a
free taxi ride to the CalTrain sta
tion.
•The Stanford version of the
Bachelor/Bachelorette: These
shows are take offs on the dating
game, when one single guy or gal
chooses a partner from many hope
fuls. In Stanford's version, lonely
professors can volunteer their time
to escort ProFros around and whit
tle them down to their ideal mate ..
. err, student, I mean. Hot tub con
versations on class struggles in
Hanna-Barbara cartoons and
weekend excursions to Palo Alto
would help the professors make
their decisions.
On the show, the winner is
usually presented with a ring. In
our version, the professors can
role-play as a postal deliverymen
and hand the winners acceptance
letters.
• And finally, admissions officers

could ask: Are You Hot?
Well, are you? This reality/
game show judges contestants on
looks alone. It is like a beauty
pageant without any pretense.
And what better way to transcend
race-based admissions than by
judging not the color of the body,
but by the ass that belongs to it.
Brown, white, black, it doesn't
matter. It's all good.
I always hear people complain
ing how ugly everyone is at Stan
ford (like the people in your home
town were much more attractive).
Think, by using the method of "Are
You Hot?" we can kill two birds
with one stone. Suddenly, everyone
at Stanford will be hot, and this will
facilitate hook-ups that are appar
ently lacking on campus.
To provide some numbers, in
stead of submitting SAT scores,
women could provide body and
dress sizes, while men could submit
weight-room statistics and bicep
measurements. Personal interviews
and photos would be required. In
fact, submitting nude photos would
give you a competitive advantage
akin to applying early.
And, to satisfy those "equal
rights for all" people, admissions
can save a few spots for the token
ugly students.
I hate to be presumptuous, but I
believe the student body will be
what Leland Stanford always want
ed it to be. Seeing those first stu
dents approaching from the hori
zon in their wagons and horses, I
am sure he said, "I hope there are
some hotties in the bunch!"
With these alternatives in mind,
why waste valuable time arguing
over affirmative action? Simply
switch on the tube and get ready to
select the Class of 2008.
