University admissions selection criteria
available to students, public
Thank you for your strong coverage of
the continuing affirmative action debate.
It is important to note that the Universi
ty's affirmative action policy has in fact in
cluded socioeconomic status for many
years now. Further, specific groups with
in the Asian American population such as
Filipinos are included within the Admis
sion Office's diversity umbrella. The arti
cle "SOCC visits the capitol" (April 1)
suggests otherwise.
A copy of the University's selection cri
teria for undergraduates (as set forth by
the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
mission and Financial Aid of the Faculty
Senate), which includes a description of
how we define diversity and the groups
included under our affirmative action
policy, has been made available to stu
dents through a number of panels and
conversations. It is available to any stu
dent who would like one, upon request,
at the Admissions Office in Old Union.

Faith in our troops
I support the troops who are truly en
gaged in the fight for freedom, truth and
justice.
These are the brave men and women
who lead the war against corrupt
regimes, against mad leaders who en
danger the world. I applaud them and
feel that there may be hope for the future
of this country.

Stanford should support 'free inquiry'
and discussion
As a Stanford alumna, I am anxious
and relieved to hear that there are
protests against the war in Iraq and our
empire-building current administration,
led by President George W. Bush. I hang
my head in shame at our former provost,
Condoleezza Rice, who I expert is not re
turning to our hallowed campus tipon
retirement from the Bush administra
tion. We are indeed losing many of our
freedoms with this latest group of presi
dential cabinet members, attorney gen

eral and hawks of many colors. I only
hope and pray that Stanford is support
ing free inquiry, discussion and socially
conscious students. Don't think this
hasn't affected my giving!

Student studying in Turkey offers
perspectives on war
Although I am a junior, I am current
ly on a leave of absence and I am living in
Istanbul, Turkey. I originally came to
Turkey intending to stay only for one
semester, but the experience was re
warding and 1 realized it could be even
more so if I decided to stay. So I did. I de
cided to write to The Daily to give some
of my impressions and perspectives
about living in a country that is so close
and so involved with the current crisis in
Iraq.
Nearly everyone I have met in Turkey
is quick to ask me my opinion about the
war in Iraq. War has been on nearly ev
eryone's mind in Turkey for the past few
months â€” almost all of the Turkish pop
ulation is opposed to it, as am I. Despite
the opposition to the war and the strong
anti-American sentiment running

among the Turkish people, I have re
ceived no hostility as a result of my being
from the United States. Just as people
are eager to share their opinions with
me, they are interested to hear from
someone from the United States whose
opinions differ from those officials in the
Pentagon and White House that we see
so often these days on the television
screen.

Anti-war sentiment is not underreported
The recent editorial "A war without rea
son" (March 21) describes President Bush's
decision to go to war with Iraq as "embar
rassing," and describes the president him
self as "disappointing." At the same time,
the editorial attempts to romantically por
tray anti-war protesters as "undcrrepre
sented" and "underreported."
Polls show that the majority of Ameri
cans support the military conflict in Iraq.
I think that the editorial expressed the
viewpoint that students sit in your naive
ly idealistic liberal cave that is Stanford
University and figure that they have
their fingers on the pulse of America, but
they clearly do not.

If the fact that Americans "still don't
know why this [war] is happening," is in
deed true, it is not the fault of some kind
of conservative information conspiracy
or irresponsible media coverage, but
rather results from individuals failing to
keep themselves informed.
It seems that people fail to realize that
when you get your news from The Daily
Show on Comedy Central, you're getting
entertainment, not information. And to
say that the anti-war movement is under
reported in the media is laughable, espe
cially in the Bay Area where opinions
seem to range from extremely anti-war
to moderately anti-war, and news re
ports are filled with protesters forcibly
vomiting on the Federal Building in San
Francisco. They most certainly are not
being" ignored," as the editorial claims.
President Bush is not an embarrass
ment to the American people, nor is he
a warmonger. Saddam Hussein is cer
tainly not a victim. Anyone who saw the
news reports of the mural found in
one of Hussein's strategy headquar
ters of an Iraqi airplane crashing into
what appears to be the World Trade
Center can see that there is a clear as
sociation between Hussein's Iraq and
the al-Qaida terrorist network.
The only so-called failure of
this war comes from the fact
that amnesic countries like
France and Germany are reluc
tant to take a potentially un

popular (though clearly justi
fied) stand on anything.
While I fully support the
right of people in the United
States to voice their opinions for
or against the war, passion is no
excuse for misinformation. Just
as I'm sure you would claim that
being against the war in Iraq
does not make you anti-Ameri
can, being pro-war does not
make you misguided or igno

rant. Most importantly, the fact
that the support of the pro-war
majority in the United States
might seem to trump the
protests of the anti-war minori
ty. This is not an indication of
the failure of democracy the
United States. Indeed, in this
case it is quite the opposite.
