### RACHEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's varsity eight blasted to a perfect
start in its first race of the spring season, winning all
three of its races in the Windermere Crew Classic at
Redwood Shores this weekend and tying for first place
in the women's varsity eight division with California
and the University of Southern California.
But Cal proved a decisive force in the regatta. The
Golden Bears swept the women's varsity four, women's
second varsity and men's varsity eight divisions. Like
Stanford and USC, Cal also won all three of their
women's varsity eight races. With a slightly larger time
margin in their combined victories, Stanford was de
clared the overall winner for the women's varsity eight.
The weekend provided perfect conditions for the
regatta, with fair skies and calm water. With such sunny
skies, the races drew a crowd of spectators who watched
from a bridge at the halfway mark and lined both sides
of the racecourse at the finish.
"It was an unbelievable weekend, to have that many
crews in one spot," said Stanford men's crew coach
Craig Amerkhanian, who was the director and orga
nizer of the event. Windermere Real Estate and the
University sponsored the regatta.
In the women's varsity races on Saturday, Stanford
beat Virginia by almost eight seconds and Michigan
State by seven seconds. In their final race on Sunday
against Ohio State, the Stanford women showed their
power from the start, overtaking the competition with
in the first strokes of the race.
"When we first knew where we were, we had four
seats," said Laurie Benson, three seat of the varsity boat
and varsity captain.
The Cardinal maintained its lead throughout the
race, eventually extending the margin of victory to 11
seconds. Stanford finished with a time of 6 minutes,
31.1 seconds.
"I was charged," said Missy Fiesler, six seat of the
varsity boat. "I felt tired mostly today, but during the
race the adrenaline was pumping."
Fresh off their victory, the women are already look
ing ahead to next week's regatta in San Diego and to
