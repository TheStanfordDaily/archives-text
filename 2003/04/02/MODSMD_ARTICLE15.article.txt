## Women's crew rows to victory 
### RACHEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's varsity eight blasted to a perfect
start in its first race of the spring season, winning all
three of its races in the Windermere Crew Classic at
Redwood Shores this weekend and tying for first place
in the women's varsity eight division with California
and the University of Southern California.
But Cal proved a decisive force in the regatta. The
Golden Bears swept the women's varsity four, women's
second varsity and men's varsity eight divisions. Like
Stanford and USC, Cal also won all three of their
women's varsity eight races. With a slightly larger time
margin in their combined victories, Stanford was de
clared the overall winner for the women's varsity eight.
The weekend provided perfect conditions for the
regatta, with fair skies and calm water. With such sunny
skies, the races drew a crowd of spectators who watched
from a bridge at the halfway mark and lined both sides
of the racecourse at the finish.
"It was an unbelievable weekend, to have that many
crews in one spot," said Stanford men's crew coach
Craig Amerkhanian, who was the director and orga
nizer of the event. Windermere Real Estate and the
University sponsored the regatta.
In the women's varsity races on Saturday, Stanford
beat Virginia by almost eight seconds and Michigan
State by seven seconds. In their final race on Sunday
against Ohio State, the Stanford women showed their
power from the start, overtaking the competition with
in the first strokes of the race.
"When we first knew where we were, we had four
seats," said Laurie Benson, three seat of the varsity boat
and varsity captain.
The Cardinal maintained its lead throughout the
race, eventually extending the margin of victory to 11
seconds. Stanford finished with a time of 6 minutes,
31.1 seconds.
"I was charged," said Missy Fiesler, six seat of the
varsity boat. "I felt tired mostly today, but during the
race the adrenaline was pumping."
Fresh off their victory, the women are already look
ing ahead to next week's regatta in San Diego and to

the season ahead.
"We feel confident but we still
have a lot to prove," said varsity
eight coxswain Wendy Hoeveler.
"It's a long way to the NCAAs,"
added Benson. But when asked
how they felt about the season, the
women had ready replies. "Excit
ed," "psyched," "fired up," they
said.
Over the weekend, the Stanford
varsity four played an unsuccessful
game of catchup against Virginia
University, Michigan State and
Ohio State.
"I think this boat can definitely
go faster," said Kasey Alderete,
coxswain of the varsity four, after
her first race on Saturday against
Virginia.

Virginia had gained an advan
tage in the race by making an early
move at the start, taking a lead of
three or four seats, Alderete said. As
both boats setded into the piece, the
Cardinal gained on Virginia, so that
by the 500-meter mark, the boats
were bow to stern, Virginia main
taining the lead.
Stanford lost ground through
the middle of the piece, however,
and by the midway point Virginia
had extended its lead to a boat
length of open water.
"Right after the bridge we had a
move," said Alderete, describing
the middle of the piece. "From
there to the finish there was no de
finitive move."
The final times were 7:33.8 for
Virginia and 7:52.1 for Stanford.
Alderete said the lour would now
focus on putting the separate parti
of the 2,000-meter race together,
with particular focus on its finish.

"If we clean up a few things, we
can hold on to the first 1,000 meters
and pick up time on the second
1 ,000," she said.
In the remaining races for the
four, Stanford was 13.8 seconds be
hind Michigan State and 22 seconds
behind Ohio State.
The women's second varsity boat
came in 12 seconds behind Virginia
and 15.7 seconds behind Michigan
on Saturday. On Sunday, Ohio
inched out Stanford by a margin of
five seconds.
In the lightweight division, Stan
ford women's eight beat Davis, but
finished behind Harvard and
Princeton. Lightweight coach A1
Acosta noted that Harvard and
Princeton are among the top light
weight crews in the country,
ton is ranked first, while Harvard is
ranked fourth.
"They should be ranked sec
ond," he said of the latter.
