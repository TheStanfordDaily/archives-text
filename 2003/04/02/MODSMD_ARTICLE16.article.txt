# Softball survives busy break

### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As many Stanford students
spent their spring breaks taking a
much-needed rest or celebrating
in Mexico, the No. 13 Stanford
softball team (26-11, 1-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) kept working,
completing nine games in nine
days.
The Cardinal faced off against
San Diego State (17-10), Illinois-

Chicago (3-18), and Fresno State
(16-15) in three non-conference
doubleheaders. The squad then
opened the Pacific-10 season with
a contest against No. 1 UCLA (31-
2) and two battles with No. 2
Washington (23-4).
Stanford handled Illinois-
Chicago easily, sweeping the
Flames 5-0 and 6-1. Freshman
center fielder Catalina Morris led
the charge at the plate, going a
combined 4-8 with a triple, home

run and three RBI. She was
joined by sophomore third base
man Elizabeth Bendig, who hit a
perfect 2-2 in the first game, and
senior second baseman Kira
Ching, who sent her fourth home
run of the season over the center
field fence.
All four members of the Cardi
nal pitching staff contributed in
the circle, as junior Dana
Sorensen recorded the first win
after senioi Maureen LeCocq
closed out the final innings and
senior Tori Nyberg posted the
second victory as freshman Laura
Severson shut down the final
Flame bats.
The Cardinal did not fare as
well against San Diego State and
Fresno State as it split both the
twin-bills, dropping the first con
test and bouncing back in both in
stances.
The Aztecs claimed the first
win, 2-0, as Stanford was unable
to push a single run across the
plate, stranding 12 runners on
base. The Cardinal out-hit San
Diego State by two but was unable
to combine hits when needed.
A different story would play
out in the nightcap, as Nyberg
shut down the Aztec bats and
recorded a 3-0 shutout. Senior
left fielder Cassi Brangham fu
eled the Stanford offense, going
2-3 with two doubles and two
RBI.
The Cardinal then traveled
south to Fresno State, where the
Bulldogs claimed the first game
before the Cardinal answered
back in the nightcap.
The first contest quickly
emerged as a pitcher's duel, as
Fresno's Jamie Southern and
Sorensen continually fanned bat
ters. Southern and Sorensen fin
ished with 11 and eight strike
outs, respectively. The Bulldogs
only managed two hits off of the
two-time All-American, and they
both came in first inning. But it
proved to be enough as the 2-0
advantage held up fora Bulldog
victory.
Stanford would claim the sec
ond game 1-0. Brangham pro
