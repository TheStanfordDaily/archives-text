# Softball survives busy break

### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As many Stanford students
spent their spring breaks taking a
much-needed rest or celebrating
in Mexico, the No. 13 Stanford
softball team (26-11, 1-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) kept working,
completing nine games in nine
days.
The Cardinal faced off against
San Diego State (17-10), Illinois-

Chicago (3-18), and Fresno State
(16-15) in three non-conference
doubleheaders. The squad then
opened the Pacific-10 season with
a contest against No. 1 UCLA (31-
2) and two battles with No. 2
Washington (23-4).
Stanford handled Illinois-
Chicago easily, sweeping the
Flames 5-0 and 6-1. Freshman
center fielder Catalina Morris led
the charge at the plate, going a
combined 4-8 with a triple, home

run and three RBI. She was
joined by sophomore third base
man Elizabeth Bendig, who hit a
perfect 2-2 in the first game, and
senior second baseman Kira
Ching, who sent her fourth home
run of the season over the center
field fence.
All four members of the Cardi
nal pitching staff contributed in
the circle, as junior Dana
Sorensen recorded the first win
after senioi Maureen LeCocq
closed out the final innings and
senior Tori Nyberg posted the
second victory as freshman Laura
Severson shut down the final
Flame bats.
The Cardinal did not fare as
well against San Diego State and
Fresno State as it split both the
twin-bills, dropping the first con
test and bouncing back in both in
stances.
The Aztecs claimed the first
win, 2-0, as Stanford was unable
to push a single run across the
plate, stranding 12 runners on
base. The Cardinal out-hit San
Diego State by two but was unable
to combine hits when needed.
A different story would play
out in the nightcap, as Nyberg
shut down the Aztec bats and
recorded a 3-0 shutout. Senior
left fielder Cassi Brangham fu
eled the Stanford offense, going
2-3 with two doubles and two
RBI.
The Cardinal then traveled
south to Fresno State, where the
Bulldogs claimed the first game
before the Cardinal answered
back in the nightcap.
The first contest quickly
emerged as a pitcher's duel, as
Fresno's Jamie Southern and
Sorensen continually fanned bat
ters. Southern and Sorensen fin
ished with 11 and eight strike
outs, respectively. The Bulldogs
only managed two hits off of the
two-time All-American, and they
both came in first inning. But it
proved to be enough as the 2-0
advantage held up fora Bulldog
victory.

The Stanford softball team, ranked No. 13 in the nation, finished with a 6-3
record over the break. The scattered competition featured two matchups with
top-ranked conference foe UCLA.
clutch base hit driving in Ching,
who had reached base by way of a
single to right field.
LeCocq finished the nightcap
going a perfect 3-3 in the box, while
the Bulldogs were once again
only able to tally two hits in the
contest.
Following a 4-2 performance
against three unranked teams,
the Cardinal prepared for the
opening of this year's Pacific-10
season.
The Pac-10 Conference is no
torious as the toughest in the
country, with six of its eight teams
in the top 15 in the country and a
history of national champi
onships.
The opening weekend would
invite the No. 1 and 2 teams in the
nation to the Farm for three sin
gle games.
The Cardinal faced of! against
top-ranked UCLA Friday night.
The Bruins got on the board with
a run in the second, but Sorensen
would fend off opposing bats,
keeping UCLA silent until the
sixth inning. The Bruins, howev
er, broke through in the top of the
sixth when Claire Sua delivered a
two-run home run to make the
score 3-0.
The Bruins utilized the long
ball once again in the top of the
seventh when Toria Auelua and
Andrea Duran both sent solo

shots over the fence to claim the 5-
0 UCLA victory.
All-American Bruin hurler
Keira Goerl pitched a no-hitter
against the Cardinal and recorded
her 2()th victory of the season.
Saturday would deliver a simi
lar fate as Stanford fell to the No. 2
Huskies, 6-0. This time the Cardi
nal bats came alive, but suffered
the all-too-familiar failure to put
their hits together to produce
runs.
Stanford attempted an attack in
the second inning of the game
when sophomore Leah Nelson
doubled to right center and ad
vanced to second when sopho
more right fielder Meghan Sickler
walked. But Washington pitcher
Ashley Boak would get the last out
of the inning with a strikeout,
stranding two Cardinal runners
on base.
This repeated in the third in
ning following a Husky three-run
rally. Stanford freshman shortstop
Lauren Lappin and Brangham at
tempted a comeback with back-to
back singles before Ching loaded
the bases on an error. But, yet
again, the Cardinal failed to score
as a no-out bases-loaded situation
was ended by a double play and a
strikeout.
Stanford's offense remained
unable to score as Washington fin
ished on top with the shutout win.
Sunday afternoon provided
Stanford with a second chance
against the Huskies, and the Car
dinal came through, posting its
first Pac-10 victory of the season.

Stanford not only claimed the
victory, but also dominated over
the No. 2 Huskies, as it tallied
eight hits and Sorensen threw her
second no-hitter of the year.
The face off began the same
way as too many Stanford games,
as the Cardinal was unable to
score with the bases loaded in the
first and second innings.
But this time the Cardinal
would keep swinging and break
through. In the third inning,
Stanford's bats took over, scoring
three runs. The first was a result of
Nelson being hit by a pitch with
the bases loaded. Then Sickler
stepped up to the plate as a pinch
hitter with the bases loaded and
delivered in the clutch with a two-
RBI double.
The Cardinal would attack
again in the bottom of the fifth
when Nelson tagged on an insur
ance run by way of a solo shot over
the center field fence. It was her
first home run of the season.
While the Stanford bats did
their job, Sorensen did hers. The
redshirt junior fell just short of a
perfect game with one walk, but
did face the minimum 21 batters
in the no-hitter.
The victory was exactly what
the Cardinal needed as it finished
off its opening Pac-1() weekend.
"It was good to see that we could
bounce back after a loss and put a
good game together," Sorensen
said. "Coming out on Sunday and
playing Washington tough and
getting the win was huge especial
ly after the tough losses in a row."
