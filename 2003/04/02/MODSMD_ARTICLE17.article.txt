What with the tourna
ment, the Oscars,
the start of baseball
season, and Tiger
NOT winning a major, I could
write about almost anything this
week. I could write about how I
picked lUPUI over Kentucky in
the first round. I could write
about how 1 also correctly picked
three out of four Final Four
teams (Please, hold the applause,

I know I am a
golden god). I
could write about
how Tiger, in re
sponse to a ques
tion of how he got
over food poison
ing nausea to win
The Bay Hill In
vitational, re-

sponded, "It was like I was back
in college, you know, boot and
rally!"
Ah binge drinking, what can't
you teach us?
But I'm not gonna write about
all that. I'm not gonna write
about Ooee-Pooee, Adrien
Brody, how much I hate the
Yankees, or Tiger's Natty Lite
days in Flo Mo.
No no, this column is much
more serious than all that.
Admission decisions were sent
out just a few days ago, and I was
dismayed that one person in par
ticular did not get in. He had all
the basics, good numbers, recs,
essay, and all that, but he just
didn't get in. What really disap
pointed me though, was that he
had a trait that
not many Stanford kids have. He
would have been such a great ad
dition to our community; he
would have added a skill not
found in many freshman dorms

next year.
The skill: enthusiasm for, and
knowledge about, collegiate
sports.
This campus is riddled with
apathy for sports, but I have
come to understand this. A lot of
Stanford kids just choose not to
place sports on as high a pedestal
as this columnist. That's fine, dif
ferent people have different
opinions. However, what really
bugs me is the
situation where Stanford kids do
get motivated to go see a game,
and they don't know a damned
thing about what is going on in
front of them because they just
lack general sports knowledge.
Case in point: this year's Big
Game. The situation: Stanford
has the ball near Cal's end zone,
against the backdrop of the Stan
ford student section. This was
the first quarter and still a close
game. It was third down and goal
from about the eight, I believe, a
crucial down that could be the
difference between seven points
and a field goal try. As Kyle Mat
ter, the quarterback, ap
proached the line of scrimmage,
he noticed a problem with the
called play and started to audi
ble.
So in the most crucial of
downs, in our own student sec
tion's end zone, while our QB is
calling an audible, what does the
entire Stanford section do,
spurred on by the yell leaders?
They yell.
My father often says that I use
the word "Honestly" to an inap
propriate degree when I get
frustrated, so please indulge me
here.
