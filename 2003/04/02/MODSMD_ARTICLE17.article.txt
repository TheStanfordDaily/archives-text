# Card fans lacking

### 
What with the tourna
ment, the Oscars,
the start of baseball
season, and Tiger
NOT winning a major, I could
write about almost anything this
week. I could write about how I
picked lUPUI over Kentucky in
the first round. I could write
about how 1 also correctly picked
three out of four Final Four
teams (Please, hold the applause,

I know I am a
golden god). I
could write about
how Tiger, in re
sponse to a ques
tion of how he got
over food poison
ing nausea to win
The Bay Hill In
vitational, re-

sponded, "It was like I was back
in college, you know, boot and
rally!"
Ah binge drinking, what can't
you teach us?
But I'm not gonna write about
all that. I'm not gonna write
about Ooee-Pooee, Adrien
Brody, how much I hate the
Yankees, or Tiger's Natty Lite
days in Flo Mo.
No no, this column is much
more serious than all that.
Admission decisions were sent
out just a few days ago, and I was
dismayed that one person in par
ticular did not get in. He had all
the basics, good numbers, recs,
essay, and all that, but he just
didn't get in. What really disap
pointed me though, was that he
had a trait that
not many Stanford kids have. He
would have been such a great ad
dition to our community; he
would have added a skill not
found in many freshman dorms

next year.
The skill: enthusiasm for, and
knowledge about, collegiate
sports.
This campus is riddled with
apathy for sports, but I have
come to understand this. A lot of
Stanford kids just choose not to
place sports on as high a pedestal
as this columnist. That's fine, dif
ferent people have different
opinions. However, what really
bugs me is the
situation where Stanford kids do
get motivated to go see a game,
and they don't know a damned
thing about what is going on in
front of them because they just
lack general sports knowledge.
Case in point: this year's Big
Game. The situation: Stanford
has the ball near Cal's end zone,
against the backdrop of the Stan
ford student section. This was
the first quarter and still a close
game. It was third down and goal
from about the eight, I believe, a
crucial down that could be the
difference between seven points
and a field goal try. As Kyle Mat
ter, the quarterback, ap
proached the line of scrimmage,
he noticed a problem with the
called play and started to audi
ble.
So in the most crucial of
downs, in our own student sec
tion's end zone, while our QB is
calling an audible, what does the
entire Stanford section do,
spurred on by the yell leaders?
They yell.
My father often says that I use
the word "Honestly" to an inap
propriate degree when I get
frustrated, so please indulge me
here.


Spencer Porter
Honestly, I don't think that
the Stanford students could
have done a worse thing while
our quarterback is spraining his
throat trying to make our re
ceivers hear the play. Besides
running on the field and urinat
ing on our entire offensive line,
making lots of noise in our end
zone while we are trying to audi
ble is just about the stupidest
thing to do. In the one moment
where silence would be golden
for Stanford, the students go
and mess it all up. Honestly!
Needless to say, as Matter
called out the snap count, an
offensive lineman jumped early,
probably because half of Palo
Alto was screaming at him while
he couldn't hear the play. Way
to go Cardinal!
And you know, it's not the
yell leaders' fault. Yes, they did
have a microphone. Yes, they
weren't watching the game. Yes,
they were telling everyone to
yell.
But I still don't place the
blame on them. General igno
rance of sports knowledge is a
deep-rooted problem at our aca
demic institution.
Too many Stanford students

as 8-year olds were playing Bach
when they should have been
learning the infield-fly rule, or
three seconds in the key, or what
an out-and-up route is. Not
enough of a premium is placed
on the camaraderie, knowledge
and better person you become by
playing or admiring sports as a
child. I have much more appreci
ation lor applicants who live
their life outside than locked in a
room playing cello because their
parents have Ivy dreams. The
applicant that lives locked in a
room studying will just yield stu
dents who lock themselves in
their Branner two-room triple
slaving for academic apprecia
tion. I'm not saying there is no
value to the workaholic, but he or
she certainly yields a depressing
campus without the fun-loving
outdoorsy type.
And don't misinterpret this as
a rip on all those kids with oo
dles of school spirit. That is not
my point. I love school spirit!
I'm all for raucous celebrations
in the name of Stanford and
over-the-top exuberance.
However, I am also continu
ally disappointed when I see the
Band, yell leaders, fans and
other Stanford supporters try to
help the team, when all they do
is lead to our demise.
I'm sick of unintelligent
cheers, depressing songs played

before basketball games ("No
Rain"?...not exactly a pre-garne
warmup song), band activities at
sports games with absolutely no
sports relevance, and the overall
ignorance of common fan
knowledge. I'm embarrassed,
not quirkily humored, that our
Band rushed the field in now the
most notorious collegiate foot
ball play, unaware that a football
game does not necessarily end
when 0:00 is showing on the
clock.
So I challenge the yell leaders,
Band members, and all Stanford
fans. I know you have school
spirit. I know you mean well. I
know you root for Cardinal red.
Let's just be more intelligent
about it. Understand situational
sports strategy. Know to be quiet
on offense, loud on defense, not
yell at golf matches, or pull a Jef
frey Maier (research him, con
sider it part of your education) at
baseball games.
Because as long as the admis
sions department keeps putting
qualified applicants with good
sports backgrounds on the wait
list, we have to change from the
inside.
So put down the trombone,
and get a clue.

applicant that lives locked in a
room studying will just yield stu
dents who lock themselves in
their Branner two-room triple
slaving for academic apprecia
tion. I'm not saying there is no
value to the workaholic, but he or
she certainly yields a depressing
campus without the fun-loving
outdoorsy type.
And don't misinterpret this as
a rip on all those kids with oo
dles of school spirit. That is not
my point. I love school spirit!
I'm all for raucous celebrations
in the name of Stanford and
over-the-top exuberance.
However, I am also continu
ally disappointed when I see the
Band, yell leaders, fans and
other Stanford supporters try to
help the team, when all they do
is lead to our demise.
I'm sick of unintelligent
cheers, depressing songs played

before basketball games ("No
Rain"?...not exactly a pre-garne
warmup song), band activities at
sports games with absolutely no
sports relevance, and the overall
ignorance of common fan
knowledge. I'm embarrassed,
not quirkily humored, that our
Band rushed the field in now the
most notorious collegiate foot
ball play, unaware that a football
game does not necessarily end
when 0:00 is showing on the
clock.
So I challenge the yell leaders,
Band members, and all Stanford
fans. I know you have school
spirit. I know you mean well. I
know you root for Cardinal red.
Let's just be more intelligent
about it. Understand situational
sports strategy. Know to be quiet
on offense, loud on defense, not
yell at golf matches, or pull a Jef
frey Maier (research him, con
sider it part of your education) at
baseball games.
Because as long as the admis
sions department keeps putting
qualified applicants with good
sports backgrounds on the wait
list, we have to change from the
inside.
So put down the trombone,
and get a clue.

What with the tourna
ment, the Oscars,
the start of baseball
season, and Tiger
NOT winning a major, I could
write about almost anything this
week. I could write about how I
picked lUPUI over Kentucky in
the first round. I could write
about how 1 also correctly picked
three out of four Final Four
teams (Please, hold the applause,

I know I am a
golden god). I
could write about
how Tiger, in re
sponse to a ques
tion of how he got
over food poison
ing nausea to win
The Bay Hill In
vitational, re-

sponded, "It was like I was back
in college, you know, boot and
rally!"
Ah binge drinking, what can't
you teach us?
But I'm not gonna write about
all that. I'm not gonna write
about Ooee-Pooee, Adrien
Brody, how much I hate the
Yankees, or Tiger's Natty Lite
days in Flo Mo.
No no, this column is much
more serious than all that.
Admission decisions were sent
out just a few days ago, and I was
dismayed that one person in par
ticular did not get in. He had all
the basics, good numbers, recs,
essay, and all that, but he just
didn't get in. What really disap
pointed me though, was that he
had a trait that
not many Stanford kids have. He
would have been such a great ad
dition to our community; he
would have added a skill not
found in many freshman dorms

next year.
The skill: enthusiasm for, and
knowledge about, collegiate
sports.
This campus is riddled with
apathy for sports, but I have
come to understand this. A lot of
Stanford kids just choose not to
place sports on as high a pedestal
as this columnist. That's fine, dif
ferent people have different
opinions. However, what really
bugs me is the
situation where Stanford kids do
get motivated to go see a game,
and they don't know a damned
thing about what is going on in
front of them because they just
lack general sports knowledge.
Case in point: this year's Big
Game. The situation: Stanford
has the ball near Cal's end zone,
against the backdrop of the Stan
ford student section. This was
the first quarter and still a close
game. It was third down and goal
from about the eight, I believe, a
crucial down that could be the
difference between seven points
and a field goal try. As Kyle Mat
ter, the quarterback, ap
proached the line of scrimmage,
he noticed a problem with the
called play and started to audi
ble.
So in the most crucial of
downs, in our own student sec
tion's end zone, while our QB is
calling an audible, what does the
entire Stanford section do,
spurred on by the yell leaders?
They yell.
My father often says that I use
the word "Honestly" to an inap
propriate degree when I get
frustrated, so please indulge me
here.

Honestly, I don't think that
the Stanford students could
have done a worse thing while
our quarterback is spraining his
throat trying to make our re
ceivers hear the play. Besides
running on the field and urinat
ing on our entire offensive line,
making lots of noise in our end
zone while we are trying to audi
ble is just about the stupidest
thing to do. In the one moment
where silence would be golden
for Stanford, the students go
and mess it all up. Honestly!
Needless to say, as Matter
called out the snap count, an
offensive lineman jumped early,
probably because half of Palo
Alto was screaming at him while
he couldn't hear the play. Way
to go Cardinal!
And you know, it's not the
yell leaders' fault. Yes, they did
have a microphone. Yes, they
weren't watching the game. Yes,
they were telling everyone to
yell.
But I still don't place the
blame on them. General igno
rance of sports knowledge is a
deep-rooted problem at our aca
demic institution.
Too many Stanford students

as 8-year olds were playing Bach
when they should have been
learning the infield-fly rule, or
three seconds in the key, or what
an out-and-up route is. Not
enough of a premium is placed
on the camaraderie, knowledge
and better person you become by
playing or admiring sports as a
child. I have much more appreci
ation lor applicants who live
their life outside than locked in a
room playing cello because their
parents have Ivy dreams. The
applicant that lives locked in a
room studying will just yield stu
dents who lock themselves in
their Branner two-room triple
slaving for academic apprecia
tion. I'm not saying there is no
