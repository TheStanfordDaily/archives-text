For Kyle Strache, Billy Strickland, Paul Bocage, Curt
Toppel and Will Curtis, Saturday marked the last match
die group of seniors would play together on Stanford's
home court.

Men's Voueybah
â€” No. 1 Tepperdir!rdef~No"iTlitanforc^

With a match against No. 1 Pepperdine (19-3, 16-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), the stage was set
for what could have been one of the most memorable
wins of the season for the No. 10 men's volleyball team
(12-11,9-8 MPSF), but it was not meant to be for the se
niors.
Stanford fell to Pepperdine in one of the closest
sweeps imaginable: 3-0 (37-35,41-39,30-28).
Despite being dominated by the Waves earlier this
season, the Cardinal had renewed hope with senior Ail-
American opposite hitter Toppel back in the lineup. He
had missed the previous 12 matches due to a strained ab
dominal muscle.
ITie availability ofToppel allowed Stanford to show a
brand-new look. Coach Don Shaw moved Strickland
from middle blocker to outside hitter and started fresh
man Chris Ahlfeldt at middle blocker.
"It's an adjustment not only for [Topp e l]> being
back on the floor, but it's an adjustment for everyone,"

The final match on their home court would prove disap
pointing for Billy Strickland and his fellow Cardinal se
niors on Saturday as Stanford dropped a nailbiter to top
ranked Pepperdine.
