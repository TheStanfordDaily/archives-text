Toppel and Will Curtis, Saturday marked the last match

home court.

With a match against No. 1 Pepperdine (19-3, 16-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), the stage was set
for what could have been one of the most memorable
wins of the season for the No. 10 men's volleyball team
(12-11,9-8 MPSF), but it was not meant to be for the se
niors.
Stanford fell to Pepperdine in one of the closest
sweeps imaginable: 3-0 (37-35,41-39,30-28).
Despite being dominated by the Waves earlier this
season, the Cardinal had renewed hope with senior Ail-
American opposite hitter Toppel back in the lineup. He
had missed the previous 12 matches due to a strained ab
dominal muscle.
ITie availability ofToppel allowed Stanford to show a
brand-new look. Coach Don Shaw moved Strickland
from middle blocker to outside hitter and started fresh
man Chris Ahlfeldt at middle blocker.
"It's an adjustment not only for [Topp e l]> being
back on the floor, but it's an adjustment for everyone,"

The final match on their home court would prove disap
pointing for Billy Strickland and his fellow Cardinal se
niors on Saturday as Stanford dropped a nailbiter to top
ranked Pepperdine.
Shaw said. "The lineup we went
with this weekend is one we only
worked on this week. I thought for
the most part we did a pretty good
job with it."
Toppel's presence was immedi
ately felt as the Cardinal reeled off
three-straight points on his serve,
forcing a Pepperdine timeout.
The Cardinal continued strong
play after the timeout and was able
to jump out to a 14-8 lead and was
later on top 18-13.
While the Cardinal held the lead
throughout most of the game, it did
not appear to be in complete control
of the match, leading to a collapse in
the second half of game one.
After a barrage of Stanford er
rors and strong defensive play
from Pepperdine, the Waves crept
back into the game and tied the
score at 28.
The two teams traded opportu

nities to finish off the game. Stanford
had two game points, while Pepper
dine converted on its sixth chance to
take the first game, 37-35.
" They made the plays they need
ed to make to win the game," Shaw
said. "It's really a shame because
things could have gone either way."
After what could have been a de
moralizing game-one loss, the Car
dinal came back in the second game
with the same fire shown in the
opening moments of the match, and
the team was able to open up a 21 -17
lead on the Waves.
But in a familiar turn of events,
Pepperdine closed the gap and tied
the second game at 22.
Neither team could pull away,
leading to die longest game of the
season for the Cardinal, but it failed
to come away with a win, ultimately
losing 41-39.
"It's just a matter of making in
stinctual plays," Shaw said. "You can
prepare and you can have the scout
ing report and the game plan and all
that, but the little bounces that come
here and there, you have to be able

to make an instinctual play and we
seem to be lacking in that area."
Despite being pushed to the
brink of defeat, the Cardinal contin
ued to fight. Shouts of "Remember
Hawaii!" echoed from the stands in
reference to Stanford's comeback
from two games down against the
then top-ranked Warriors.
Pepperdine proved to be tcx>
strong, however, and while Stanford
was able to keep the score close, it
could not take the lead at any point
in the decisive game.
"Wejust didn't make plays at the
right times," Toppel said. "We
fought the entire time really hard,
but when it came down to crunch
time, they made the plays and we
didn't."
Defensively, Stanford was unable
to slow down Pepperdine's stand
out sophomore outside hitter Sean
Rooney, who recorded a match
high 20 kills on a .486 hitting per
centage. He also added 11 digs.
The Cardinal saw strong play
from Toppel, who racked up 16 kills
and Strickland who added 15.
