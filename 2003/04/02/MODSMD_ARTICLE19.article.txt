### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jamie Carey has dreamed of
wearing Cardinal red and tuning
down the nets at Maples Pavilion
since she was in the seventh grade.
Last night her dream came true

Before the game, Texas coach
Jody Conradt called the Tigers
(30-4) the best team in the nation.
But the Longhorns will travel to
Atlanta and square off against
Connecticut. The Huskies will
bring a 35-1 record and the No. 1
ranking to the Georgia Dome, so
