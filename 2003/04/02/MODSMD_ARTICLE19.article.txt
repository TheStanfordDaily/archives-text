# Streaking Longhorns stifle LSU
## No.2 Texas advances to NCAA Final Four with upset of top seed 
### MATT LONG EDITORIAL STAFF 
Jamie Carey has dreamed of
wearing Cardinal red and tuning
down the nets at Maples Pavilion
since she was in the seventh grade.
Last night her dream came true
with one adjustment: she wore
burnt orange instead of red as her
No. 2 seed Texas Longhorns (29-
5) upset No. 1 seed LSU 78-60 to
earn a berth in the Final Four.
Texas' star point guard attend
ed Stanford for her freshman year
and was named Pacific 10 Confer
ence Rookie of the Year. But a se-

ries of concussions forced her to
use two medical redshirt years and
finally be ruled medically ineligible
by the Cardinal. Texas cleared her
to play and the Horns have wel
comed her to their pasture, where
she was named Rig 12 Newcomer
of the Year.
Ironically, Texas was assigned
to the West Region, hosted by
Stanford, giving her a chance to
shine in the same spotlight that she
enjoyed earlier in her collegiate ca
reer. She did not disappoint
Maples, which was spotted with
fans wearing throwback 'Carey'
jerseys from Stanford.
Though she had an off shooting
night, going 2-10 for six points, she

was still named to the all-West Re
gional team based on her 18-point
performance in Sunday's 73-60
victory over Minnesota, the No. 6
seeded upstart that ended Stan
ford's season in the second round.
Carey ran the Texas offense with
astounding efficiency in the Re
gional, committing only one
turnover despite sitting out just
one minute in the two games.
Before the game, Texas coach
Jody Conradt called the Tigers
(30-4) the best team in the nation.
But the Longhorns will travel to
Atlanta and square off against
Connecticut. The Huskies will
bring a 35-1 record and the No. 1
ranking to the Georgia Dome, so
Conradt delivered a reprised ver
sion of her statement in hesitance
to provide UConn with any bul
letin board fodder.
"Now I'm changing my story
and saying that UConn is the best
team in the country," said Con
radt, who earned her 700 th victo
ry with the Longhorns.
Texas is the only No. 2 seed to
make college basketball's main
event, joining No. Is Duke, Ten
nessee and UConn in the Final
Four. But there may be no more
dangerous squad to face this late
in the season, as the Longhorns
are the nation's hottest team rid
ing the tails of a 17-game winning
streak.
"I'm speechless," Conradt said
after the game. "What can I say to
express how good it feels to be
with a team that's playing (he way
we are?"
Texas beat the Tigers the same
way it compiled those other 16 wins:
tight defense, heady guard play and
dominating inside presence.
LSU jumped out to an 11-4 lead
with 15 minutes left in the first
half, but then Carey and company
buckled down their zone defense
and began to get the ball to their
moneymakers — forwards
Heather Schreiber and Stacy
Stephens.
Eighteen Longhorn points and
six minutes later, Texas had built a
22-11 lead. LSU closed their deficit
to seven a minute later, but that is
as close as they would get for the
rest of the contest.
"I don't know of any area that
fTexas] did not work us," LSU
coach Sue Cunter said.
In no area was this more appar
ent than on the inside. Schreiber
Finished with a career-high 32
points and eight rebounds while
Stephens chipped in 14 points and
12 boards.
"We didn't war down in the
trenches like we are supposed to,"
Gunter said. "They killed us in the
paint."

Schreiber had a solution to
every Tiger defensive scheme,
equally comfortable using her
quickness in the post and drop
ping behind the 3-point line to
score from the perimeter.
"The more shots I made the
more confidence I got," said
Schreiber, who was named MVP
of the West Regional.

The enlire Texas team must
have felt the same way, as it shot
over 48 percent in the game.
The win avenged a 76-58 set
back to LSU on Dec. 28 in Baton
Rouge, a game in which Texas was
without Carey because of a sickness.
The Longhorns will be at full
strength when they meet UConn
on April 6.

"Now I'm changing my story
and saying that UConn is the best
team in the country," said Con
radt, who earned her 700 th victo
ry with the Longhorns.
Texas is the only No. 2 seed to
make college basketball's main
event, joining No. Is Duke, Ten
nessee and UConn in the Final
Four. But there may be no more
dangerous squad to face this late
in the season, as the Longhorns
are the nation's hottest team rid
ing the tails of a 17-game winning
streak.
"I'm speechless," Conradt said
after the game. "What can I say to
express how good it feels to be
with a team that's playing (he way
we are?"
Texas beat the Tigers the same
way it compiled those other 16 wins:
tight defense, heady guard play and
dominating inside presence.
LSU jumped out to an 11-4 lead
with 15 minutes left in the first
half, but then Carey and company
buckled down their zone defense
and began to get the ball to their
moneymakers — forwards
Heather Schreiber and Stacy
Stephens.
Eighteen Longhorn points and
six minutes later, Texas had built a
22-11 lead. LSU closed their deficit
to seven a minute later, but that is
as close as they would get for the
rest of the contest.
"I don't know of any area that
fTexas] did not work us," LSU
coach Sue Cunter said.
In no area was this more appar
ent than on the inside. Schreiber
Finished with a career-high 32
points and eight rebounds while
Stephens chipped in 14 points and
12 boards.
"We didn't war down in the
trenches like we are supposed to,"
Gunter said. "They killed us in the
paint."

Schreiber had a solution to
every Tiger defensive scheme,
equally comfortable using her
quickness in the post and drop
ping behind the 3-point line to
score from the perimeter.
"The more shots I made the
more confidence I got," said
Schreiber, who was named MVP
of the West Regional.

The enlire Texas team must
have felt the same way, as it shot
over 48 percent in the game.
The win avenged a 76-58 set
back to LSU on Dec. 28 in Baton
Rouge, a game in which Texas was
without Carey because of a sickness.
The Longhorns will be at full
strength when they meet UConn
on April 6.
