# ASSU rejects survey proposal
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
A proposal to add survey questions
to the elections ballot brought a good
deal of controversy to last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing. The proposal, brought by Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior, sought to
utilize the elections ballot to gather ag
gregate data on voters.
The purpose of the bill, as defined
by Cowgill's presentation, would be to
"take information about student
needs, the campus social and political
environment and the intended role of
the ASSU." This information would
then be released, without any obvious
identifiers, to any student or group
that requested it.
Only aggregate data, not raw infor
mation, would be made public. Ques
tions for the ballot would be submitted
by student groups.

" The idea is that we have all these
people vote in spring elections, more
than any other survey I think, and this
is an opportunity to find out about
what people think about various cam
pus issues," Cowgill said. "This could
be useful for various campus publica
tions, student groups who serve the
student body, and of course to us [the
ASSU] who do serve the student
body."
However, many objected to the idea
of placing survey questions on the elec
tions ballot.
"I don't want this to be something
that discourages people from voting in
elections," said Elections Commission
er Eleanor Williams, a junior. "The
fact of the matter is that just because
lots of people vote, doesn't mean
they'll fill out the survey."
Associate Dean of Students Nanci
Howe echoed these concerns.
"The real question is do you want to

link these questions to the election and
how will this impact the election," she
said.
Cowgill began to respond to
Howe's statement, but she interrupted
him to make another point.
"Also I think it would be great not
just to get your [Cowgill's] comments,
but also the other people's comments
about the idea," she said.
Williams also noted that even if the
proposal were passed, it could not be
run this year.
"It's just too late, we don't have
questions, and we don't have time to
add to the software," she said.
Cowgill quickly responded to her
concern.
"I think it's kind of strange, person
ally, that during finals week, [Senator]
Hiro [Iwonaga] has managed to get a
less ambitious project up," he said.
