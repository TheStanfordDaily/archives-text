# ASSU rejects survey proposal
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
A proposal to add survey questions
to the elections ballot brought a good
deal of controversy to last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meet
ing. The proposal, brought by Senate
Chair Bo Cowgill, a senior, sought to
utilize the elections ballot to gather ag
gregate data on voters.
The purpose of the bill, as defined
by Cowgill's presentation, would be to
"take information about student
needs, the campus social and political
environment and the intended role of
the ASSU." This information would
then be released, without any obvious
identifiers, to any student or group
that requested it.
Only aggregate data, not raw infor
mation, would be made public. Ques
tions for the ballot would be submitted
by student groups.

" The idea is that we have all these
people vote in spring elections, more
than any other survey I think, and this
is an opportunity to find out about
what people think about various cam
pus issues," Cowgill said. "This could
be useful for various campus publica
tions, student groups who serve the
student body, and of course to us [the
ASSU] who do serve the student
body."
However, many objected to the idea
of placing survey questions on the elec
tions ballot.
"I don't want this to be something
that discourages people from voting in
elections," said Elections Commission
er Eleanor Williams, a junior. "The
fact of the matter is that just because
lots of people vote, doesn't mean
they'll fill out the survey."
Associate Dean of Students Nanci
Howe echoed these concerns.
"The real question is do you want to

link these questions to the election and
how will this impact the election," she
said.
Cowgill began to respond to
Howe's statement, but she interrupted
him to make another point.
"Also I think it would be great not
just to get your [Cowgill's] comments,
but also the other people's comments
about the idea," she said.
Williams also noted that even if the
proposal were passed, it could not be
run this year.
"It's just too late, we don't have
questions, and we don't have time to
add to the software," she said.
Cowgill quickly responded to her
concern.
"I think it's kind of strange, person
ally, that during finals week, [Senator]
Hiro [Iwonaga] has managed to get a
less ambitious project up," he said.


LINDSAY COIAAAN/The Stanford Daily
Students get ready to put up fliers for their ASSU Special Fees campaigns. Groups were able to start post
ing information across campus at 12:01 a.m. this morning.
A motion to vote was brought
by Senator Sara Ines Calderon, a
sophomore, who noted time con
straints and the list of remaining is
sues on the agenda. The bill was
rejected by a vote of zero in favor,
nine against, and one (Cowgill) ab
staining.
Cowgill was visibly upset, not
ing that he had spent a good deal
of time on the bill that he did not
want to go to waste. He also men
tioned tliat the Stanford Progres
sive and the Stanford Review
worked on survey questions fora
related bill and that the Stanford
Daily supported the proposal.
Daily Editor in Chief Megan
Knize, a senior, objected to
Cowgill's characterization of the
Daily's position.
"I spoke with Bo both in person
and through e-mails," she said. "I
told him that it would be inappro

priate and a conflict of interest for
the Daily to gel involved with pro
jects and proposals of the ASSU,"
she said.
In other Senate business, the
ASSU Nominations Commission is
accepting applications tor student
representatives to the Dean of Stu
dents Search Committee. Applica
tions can be obtained by e-mailing
nomcom-chair@assu.stan ford
.edu, and are due on April 6.
Senator Josh Shipp, a sopho
more, briefly discussed his idea to
create a dining points / meals Web
site at which students can easily
check their point totals and do
nate them to student groups, such
as SPOON, or use them for food
for trips.
Finally, Williams noted that
campaigning was to begin to at
12:01 a.m. today. There will be a
candidate meet-and-greet
Thursday, from noon to 1 p.m. in
White Plaza and an ASSU presi
dential candidate debate on
Monday, from 8 to 10 p.m. in the
CoHo.
