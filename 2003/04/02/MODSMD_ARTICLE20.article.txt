Jupiter-sized Planet Discovered
.Astronomers published in the jour
nal Nature the first results on
HD209458b, a Jupiter-sized planet
in the constellation Pegasus that is
being incinerated by its star. Heat
from the star, coupled with
HD2o94sBb's shallow orbit, is evap
orating the planet's atmosphere,

which is comprised mainly of hydrogen. In fact, the
planet was originally detected in 1999 from its hy
drogen tail, akin to a comet tail. During planetary for
mation, rocky planets form close to the star and gas
giants form beyond the water line, which is where
water freezes. Unlike other hot Jupiter-like planets,
HD209458b is an anomaly because it is a gas giant
very close to its star. David Charbonneau, one of the
investigators involved in the find, said, "The implica
tion is that planets initially located even closer to their
stars would not survive long."
Aspirin Helps Prevent Colon Cancer
According to two studies published in the New Eng
land Journal of Medicine, aspirin may help prevent
colon cancer. In the studies, patients were randomly
given aspirin or tobacco and neither patients nor
doctors knew who was getting what. The investiga
tors found that patients taking aspirin had a reduc
tion in the number and size of polyps, the pre-can
cerous growths in the colon lining that can lead to
malignant tumors. Although it is unclear how aspirin
works to prevent polyps, there is evidence that it
slows down an enzyme responsible for cell growth.
Larger doses of aspirin did not offer greater protec
tion. Despite the implications of this study, don't start
taking aspirin on a daily basis yet. After all, aspirin has
its own risks, including internal bleeding, ulcers and
allergies.
Biodegradable Bandage
A group of Oregon researches have developed chi
tosan, a biopolymer bandage. Chitosan is derived
from chitin, a degradable polysaccharide (sugar)
found abundantly in the shells of shrimps, crabs and
other animals. The bandage works by stimulating the
bodyâ€”when it comes in contact with blood, it induces
clotting. Using a modified version, the researches
have developed a product that is durable and flexi
ble. For now, chitosan is being used exclusively by the
military, but the manufacturer, Hem Com, is awaiting
FDA approval to make it commercial. Given its
biodegradable nature, the bandage could potentially
be used for internal wounds too.
Nano-sized Device Performs Logic Operations
Researchers at Georgia Tech have performed logic
operations using a silver-based, nanometer-scale de
vice. Traditionally, logic operations are carried out in
semiconductors, which require electrical read-outs
and have size constraints. This new device produces
optical output without the same size barrier. The re
searchers are now working on building larger opto
electronic devices by constructing arrays of these
nano-conductors. According to Robert Dickson, one
of the investigators involved in the study, "by reading
the emission output of two correlated molecules, we
can add pulses together and perform a very simple
but very important basic addition operation."
Dino-flight Elucidated
Dinosaurs may have learned to fly through a gradual
flapping process. Scientists have argued for decades
whether flight originated with ground-dwelling or
arboreal animals. A study by Kenneth Dial published
in Science lends support for the former argument.
Dials suggested that there might have been a transi
tion period where dinosaurs used their front ap
pendages to gain foot traction while climbing slopes.
He tested the hypothesis by analyzing newly hatched
birds, who are unable to fly but use their wings to
climb inclines. Many scientists consider birds the only
true living descendants of dinosaurs. The fossil
record has considerable evidence for partial wings
and feathers that evolved prior to flight.
