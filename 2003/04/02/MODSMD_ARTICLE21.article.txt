# Learning to lean and roll:
## The 						Segway Hits The Streets 
### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Something strange is happening in
the basement of the Hayes Mansion
Conference Center in San Jose. A small
crowd of men and women are walking
from room to room, wearing bicycle
helmets and taking excitedly. Peek into
one of these rooms and you will see
those same people stepping aboard
what looks like a large pogo stick with
wheels and maneuvering their ma
chine around a small obstacle course of
orange cones.
Welcome to a training session for
the Segway Human Transporter.
The machine does not lit easily into
any existing category of transportation.
It's not a scooter, bike or car. Compa
ny brochures describe it as "the first
self-balancing, electric-powered trans
portation device."
Before any description of the de
vice, it must be said that riding Segway
is a lot of fun. As it works with human
instincts to balance and move, you just
lean forward slightly to make the Seg
way go forward, or press your heels
down to make the Segway go back
ward. Despite the hour of training of
fered by the company, it's easy to learn
to ride the Segway in a few minutes.
The men and women who were
learning to ride the Segway last month
were early delivery customers. They al
ready purchased their Segways over
Amazon.com for around $5,000, since
the site began taking orders in Novem
ber last year. After the training session,
they were promised that their Segway
would arrive within two weeks.
"Since it's so new, it's like nothing
they've ever experienced before," said
Carla Vallone, communications man
ager for Segway, explaining the reason
for the training program.
Segways aren't like cars, which most
people know how to use, Vallone ex
plained.
"This is the early adopter audience,
as we try to grow this market," she said.
Each Segway has a steering column
and a platform that the rider stands on.
The steering column, which is detach
able, has controls to start the machine
and a small monitor to show that the
Segway is on. The column can be ad
justed, but was still slightly short for the
taller riders in the training session. In
side the platform are the computer sys
tems, motors and sensors that coordi
nate the movement of the rider with

the movement of the Segway.
Every device comes with a set of dif
ferent-colored keys. The keys limit how
fast the Segway can go so that new own
ers can practice on lower speeds. The
top speed of the device is around 12
miles per hour. For the training ses
sion, Segways were started with a black
key, meaning that the machines could
only go 6 mph. In the confined space of
the conference rooms, the new owners
focused more on starting, stopping and
maneuvering around the tracks of
cones.
The Segway has various safety fea
tures. Each of the internal systems have
backups, but if something should go

wrong, or if the rider tails off, the Seg
way sounds an alarm and stops.
To demonstrate this, Vallone
turned on the safety feature. Immedi
ately the Segway began shaking and
beeping.
"It's waiting for me to step off the
device," Vallone said. As soon as she
got down, the machine shut off. The
safety feature has various components
so the rider can "see, hear and feel"
that there's a problem.
The body of each Segway is made
from a type of plastic called Solexx and
is sealed to protect the internal com
puter systems. Fenders over the wheels
are designed to keep water from

splashing the rider. The Segway also
has reflective material embedded in
the body for night riding. Vallone said
that the company is developing attach
able lights. Until the Segway lights ap
pear, she recommends bicycle lights or
headlamps.
There are also anti-theft devices
built in. For example, the keys for one
Segway will not start any other ma
chine. Without the key, on-board com
puters lock, making the Segway unus
able.
Although a stolen Segway would be
technically useless to the thief, Vallone
suggested concerned owners use a
cable bicycle lock to secure the device.
The lock can be threaded through the
spaces on the wheel hubs.
As the Segway is so new, certain op
tional features for the Segway are ei
ther just being offered or are still in de
velopment. Segway has recently creat
ed tires with a larger tread and wheel
studs for more rural areas, or places
with snow and ice. The specially devel
oped Michelin wheels cost $ 188 each.
The fact that the Segway has only
just been released is one of the reasons
that the devices are not already on the
Stanford campus. Before unveiling its
national marketing campaign, the
company proposed that Stanford Uni
versity be a Segway demonstration site.
But when the company was unable to
answer questions on liability, insurance
and regulations, Stanford declined the
offer.
Stanford transportation programs
manager Kevin Mathy said that many
questions about the device still remain
and Segway still hasn't provided all the
answers. A meeting last week at UC-
Davis for various university officials
and Segway representatives fell
through when Segway cancelled unex
pectedly.
"How do they fit in the jurisdiction
in California? Are they vehicles or non
vehicles? There are liability concerns,
and one big question I have is about
theft," Mathy said. "We haven't got any
clear answers from the company yet."
Officials in San Francisco, also wor
ried about the device as a form of trans
portation, recently banned Segways
from the sidewalks of the city.
Despite the uncertainties that still re
main, Mathy said that the Department
of Parking and Transportation is still
working on creating a policy for Seg-

ways and will continue to discuss
possibilities with the company.
In the meantime, the Segway
has already made an appearance
on campus. One of the early deliv
ery customers was Louie Pellegri
ni, who owns the Peninsula Elec
tric Car Company at Stanford. Pel
legrini's Segway arrived last Mon
day, and he has been testing it out
around campus.
"I love it," Pellegrini said. "I've
ridden it to the stadium and to the
president's house."

"I got the hang of it pretty
quickly," said Pellegrini, who said
he could ride it after five minutes.
"My grandparents tried it and
they took to it quickly too."
Although the company doesn't
advise it, Pellegrini has been test
ing his Segway on various surfaces,
such as grass, sand and water. He
said that it functioned well on all
three surfaces and could even
jump small curbs.
"it's cool, I've never seen any
thing like it,"he said.
In the future, Pellegrini hopes
to buy three more Segways and
rent them to students. For the time
being, Pellegrini will continue to
ride his Segway around campus.

"I'm just playing with it so far,"
he said.
In the end, the Segway seems to
be more of a toy than a new form
of mass transportation. The cost
remains prohibitively high for
most people — especially students
— and although the Segway is en
vironmentally friendly, it doesn't
have the cargo space of a car or the
ability to carry passengers.
Segway hopes their product
will help people get around, allow
ing them to move farther, faster.
But until the Segway becomes
available near the disposable bicy
cles at Wal-Mart, it's likely that
most students will continue to rely
on their own two feet.

Welcome to a training session for
the Segway Human Transporter.
The machine does not lit easily into
any existing category of transportation.
It's not a scooter, bike or car. Compa
ny brochures describe it as "the first
self-balancing, electric-powered trans
portation device."
Before any description of the de
vice, it must be said that riding Segway
is a lot of fun. As it works with human
instincts to balance and move, you just
lean forward slightly to make the Seg
way go forward, or press your heels
down to make the Segway go back
ward. Despite the hour of training of
fered by the company, it's easy to learn
to ride the Segway in a few minutes.
The men and women who were
learning to ride the Segway last month
were early delivery customers. They al
ready purchased their Segways over
Amazon.com for around $5,000, since
the site began taking orders in Novem
ber last year. After the training session,
they were promised that their Segway
would arrive within two weeks.
"Since it's so new, it's like nothing
they've ever experienced before," said
Carla Vallone, communications man
ager for Segway, explaining the reason
for the training program.
Segways aren't like cars, which most
people know how to use, Vallone ex
plained.
"This is the early adopter audience,
as we try to grow this market," she said.
Each Segway has a steering column
and a platform that the rider stands on.
The steering column, which is detach
able, has controls to start the machine
and a small monitor to show that the
Segway is on. The column can be ad
justed, but was still slightly short for the
taller riders in the training session. In
side the platform are the computer sys
tems, motors and sensors that coordi
nate the movement of the rider with

the movement of the Segway.
Every device comes with a set of dif
ferent-colored keys. The keys limit how
fast the Segway can go so that new own
ers can practice on lower speeds. The
top speed of the device is around 12
miles per hour. For the training ses
sion, Segways were started with a black
key, meaning that the machines could
only go 6 mph. In the confined space of
the conference rooms, the new owners
focused more on starting, stopping and
maneuvering around the tracks of
cones.
The Segway has various safety fea
tures. Each of the internal systems have
backups, but if something should go

wrong, or if the rider tails off, the Seg
way sounds an alarm and stops.
To demonstrate this, Vallone
turned on the safety feature. Immedi
ately the Segway began shaking and
beeping.
"It's waiting for me to step off the
device," Vallone said. As soon as she
got down, the machine shut off. The
safety feature has various components
so the rider can "see, hear and feel"
that there's a problem.
The body of each Segway is made
from a type of plastic called Solexx and
is sealed to protect the internal com
puter systems. Fenders over the wheels
are designed to keep water from

splashing the rider. The Segway also
has reflective material embedded in
the body for night riding. Vallone said
that the company is developing attach
able lights. Until the Segway lights ap
pear, she recommends bicycle lights or
headlamps.
There are also anti-theft devices
built in. For example, the keys for one
Segway will not start any other ma
chine. Without the key, on-board com
puters lock, making the Segway unus
able.
Although a stolen Segway would be
technically useless to the thief, Vallone
suggested concerned owners use a
cable bicycle lock to secure the device.
The lock can be threaded through the
spaces on the wheel hubs.
As the Segway is so new, certain op
tional features for the Segway are ei
ther just being offered or are still in de
velopment. Segway has recently creat
ed tires with a larger tread and wheel
studs for more rural areas, or places
with snow and ice. The specially devel
oped Michelin wheels cost $ 188 each.
The fact that the Segway has only
just been released is one of the reasons
that the devices are not already on the
Stanford campus. Before unveiling its
national marketing campaign, the
company proposed that Stanford Uni
versity be a Segway demonstration site.
But when the company was unable to
answer questions on liability, insurance
and regulations, Stanford declined the
offer.
Stanford transportation programs
manager Kevin Mathy said that many
questions about the device still remain
and Segway still hasn't provided all the
answers. A meeting last week at UC-
Davis for various university officials
and Segway representatives fell
through when Segway cancelled unex
pectedly.
"How do they fit in the jurisdiction
in California? Are they vehicles or non
vehicles? There are liability concerns,
and one big question I have is about
theft," Mathy said. "We haven't got any
clear answers from the company yet."
Officials in San Francisco, also wor
ried about the device as a form of trans
portation, recently banned Segways
from the sidewalks of the city.
Despite the uncertainties that still re
main, Mathy said that the Department
of Parking and Transportation is still
working on creating a policy for Seg-

event for early purchasers in San Jose last month. Costing around $5,000, the Seg

ways and will continue to discuss
possibilities with the company.
In the meantime, the Segway
has already made an appearance
on campus. One of the early deliv
ery customers was Louie Pellegri
ni, who owns the Peninsula Elec
tric Car Company at Stanford. Pel
legrini's Segway arrived last Mon
day, and he has been testing it out
around campus.
"I love it," Pellegrini said. "I've
ridden it to the stadium and to the
president's house."

"I got the hang of it pretty
quickly," said Pellegrini, who said
he could ride it after five minutes.
"My grandparents tried it and
they took to it quickly too."
Although the company doesn't
advise it, Pellegrini has been test
ing his Segway on various surfaces,
such as grass, sand and water. He
said that it functioned well on all
three surfaces and could even
jump small curbs.
"it's cool, I've never seen any
thing like it,"he said.
In the future, Pellegrini hopes
to buy three more Segways and
rent them to students. For the time
being, Pellegrini will continue to
ride his Segway around campus.

"I'm just playing with it so far,"
he said.
In the end, the Segway seems to
be more of a toy than a new form
of mass transportation. The cost
remains prohibitively high for
most people — especially students
— and although the Segway is en
vironmentally friendly, it doesn't
have the cargo space of a car or the
ability to carry passengers.
Segway hopes their product
will help people get around, allow
ing them to move farther, faster.
But until the Segway becomes
available near the disposable bicy
cles at Wal-Mart, it's likely that
most students will continue to rely
on their own two feet.
Something strange is happening in
the basement of the Hayes Mansion
Conference Center in San Jose. A small
crowd of men and women are walking
from room to room, wearing bicycle
helmets and taking excitedly. Peek into
one of these rooms and you will see
those same people stepping aboard
what looks like a large pogo stick with
wheels and maneuvering their ma
