# Scooters, memory and MP3s:
## A
						gadget roundup

This gadget roundup looks at sever
al essential technology accessories and
a trendy new scooter by Trikke. The
accessories include flash media from
San Disk, web cameras from Veo and
an FM transmitter made by First Inter
national Digital.
When I first opened the Trikke
model .8 box, I was somewhat over
whelmed. This wasn't a typical scooter.
For one, its wheels are about four times
as big as those on a typical scooter, solv
ing problems others scooters face when
encountering crack or breaks in the
pavement. Assembly took about 20
minutes and was straightforward. The
unit looked a little intimidating, but
when I first stepped onto it, I was im
mediately impressed with how stable it
was.
Getting the scooter to move was
slightly challenging but the included
video got me rolling fairly quickly.
While using the scooter on a carpet was
less than easy, the scooter performed
very well on smoother surfaces, such as
linoleum, tile and pavement. I have no
doubt that the Trikke .8 can attain the
claimed top speed of 18 mph.
What prevented me from using the
Trikke as a mode of transportation was
that, even folded, it was too bulky and
heavy to carry. For now, the Trikke is
a means of exercise or entertainment
— something you can toss into the
trunk of your car instead of needing to
carry it with you.

Overall, the Trikke .8 is an innovative
concept with a solid construction to
back it up. Rated one of the coolest in
ventions of 2002 by Time Magazine
and used by several Hollywood per
sonalities, Trikke seems to be off to a
rolling start.
With digital cameras and PDAs be
ginning to dominate consumer elec
tronics, storing large amounts of data
in the various devices still presents a
challenge. Luckily, San Disk has a solu
tion. Of all the flash memory — small
cards that store anywhere from 4MB
to 2 GB — I looked at, San Disk offered
the most choices and the most features.
The San Disk ultra 512 MB compact
flash card was about twice as fast as any
of the other leading makes of compact
flash cards. What this means is the dif
ference between a picture of your best
friend breaking the tape at the end of a
race and a picture of the tape lying on
the ground. As anyone who's used a
digital camera knows, even a second is
crucial.
The San Disk Secure Digital (lard of
fers similar impressive performance. It
also provides a switch that prevents
your data from getting overwritten ac
cidentally.
Once you have your pictures stored
on flash memory cards, you need to
transfer them to your computer. The
San Disk Imagemate 6 in 1
Reader/Writer makes this a snap. It
