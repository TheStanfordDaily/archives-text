# Al-Jazeera Web site among most popular news source for Net surfers
## 
### 
AP â€” In spite of being mostly
knocked offline, the Web site of
Arab satellite news network Al-
Jazeera was among the most
sought-after on the Internet last
week.
The Web portal Lycos report
ed that "Al-Jazeera" and variant
spellings became its top search
term last week, with three times
more searches than "sex."
Al-Jazeera drew intense inter
est from Web surfers after it car
ried Iraqi TV footage of dead
and captive U.S. soldiers in Iraq.
U.S. television networks had de
cided not to air footage of the
corpses. Al-Jazeera later honored
a U.S. request to stop until fami
lies could be notified, a statement
from the network said.
The Internet's leading search
engine, Google, said "Al-Jazeera"
was the term that showed the
greatest increase in the week
ending March 31. Google does
not report absolute rankings of
search terms.
Hackers also homed in on Al-

Jazeera, bringing down its Web
site early last week in what the
Web host called an attack charac
terized by a flood of bogus traffic.
Hackers calling themselves
the "Freedom Cyber Force Mili
tia" later diverted visitors to the
English site to a page with a U.S.
flag.
The managing editor of Al-
Jazeera's English site, Joanne
Tucker, said it would be back up
by Wednesday and that steps
were being taken to make the
Web pages impervious to hack
ing attempts.
Al-Jazeera is based in the Per
sian Gulf state of Qatar. It is fund
ed by Qatar's government but is
an unusually independent voice
in the Arab world. Its English
Web site launched last week with
the aim of giving Western audi
ences an Arab perspective.
At least one other regional
site, Arabia.com of the United
Arab Emirates, was blocked by
hackers last week, said Duri al-
Ajrami, the site's marketing

manager.
U.S. Internet users are visiting
foreign sites in huge numbers for
news on the war, according to a
study by the Pew Internet 8c
American Life Project released
Tuesday.
In the conflict's first six days,
10 percent of Americans who use
the Internet visited the sites of
foreign news organizations, the
study said. This compared to 32
percent who visited Web sites of
U.S. television networks for war
news. The telephone poll sur
veyed 999 Internet users and
had a 4 percent margin of error.
Besides Al-Jazeera and Ara
bia.com, there are plenty of Eng
lish-language news sites with an
Arab perspective.
Jennifer Salan at the Arab
American Institute in Washing
ton said they include Lebanon's
privately owned Daily Star
newspaper, as well as The Jor
dan Times and Saudi Arabia's
Arab News, both government
owned.
