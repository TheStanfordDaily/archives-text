With its long-standing commit
ment to admissions policies pro
moting racial and ethnic diversity,
Stanford will likely be impacted by
current Supreme Court cases
challenging the affirmative action
policies of the University of Michi
gan. The cases, which were ar
gued yesterday, revisit three
decades of debate on a national
and University level.
The University's history with
affirmative action started in 1965
with President Lyndon John
son's executive order requiring
states, local governments and
private entities receiving federal
dollars to make special efforts to
hire members of groups which
have been discriminated against
in the past.
Affirmative action was ex
panded in 1969 by President
Richard Nixon's executive
order, which made such pro
grams compulsory for all federal
agencies.
"These were the two big initial
national government efforts in
the affirmative action issue," said
Luis Fraga, an associate professor
of political science. "It's impor
tant to recognize, however, that
they were executive orders, not
laws, and had no consensus in
Congress."
This, according to Fraga,
makes them especially vulnerable
to both congressional and court
interpretation, accounting for the
mutability of the University's af
firmative action and admission
policies.

"The [University's] policy has
evolved," Fraga said. "There have
been laws passed, specific funds al
located and programs established
which have written into them that
affirmative action efforts should be
attained. Yet the specific require
ments have varied tremendously
over time."
Stanford adopted its own affir
mative action policy within the
broad set of 112 ederal guidelines, re
acting to pertinent laws and court
cases, notably the 1978 Bakke
Supreme Court case.
"1 can't recall that the funda
mental premise of affirmative ac
tion was ever called into question
at Stanford," said Albert Camar
illo, a professor of history.
"[However,] there have been
several instances where specific
policies and practices were dis
cussed and modified."
In the Michigan case, Stanford
has reiterated its supportive stance
on affirmative action by filing an
amicus curiae brief with the
Supreme Court supporting sup
porting the public university's
policies.
Camarillo said, "President
[John] Hennessy and Provost
[John] Etchemendy have both
forcefully and articulately advocat
ed for Stanford's long-standing
commitment to affirmative action
policies for students, faculty and
staff, as much so or more than any
previous administration in my
three-decade-long career at the
University."
Faculty members agree that af
firmative action has played a
major role in shaping the Univer
sity's student body as well as the

campus' intellectual environment.
"Affirmative action has had
the greatest impact on Stanford
and other universities with re
gard to the undergraduate stu
dent population," Camarillo
said. "A generation or so ago,
Stanford and most universities
had few minority students.
When I started at UCLA, as a
freshman in 1966, there were
only 44 other Mexican Ameri
cans on campus [among tens of
thousands of students], though
nearly a million Mexican Ameri
cans lived in the L.A. metropoli
tan area," he said.
According to Fraga, much of
the public negativity surrounding
affirmative action is rooted in two
key terms: quotas and special priv
ileges. Michigan has recently been
accused by the Bush administra
tion of employing a quota system
in its admissions process, violating
the Bakke ruling, which outlawed
the use of quotas.
"Stanford's admission process
has never relied on a formulaic
method of selection, nor have
any quotas been utilized in our
admission process with regard to
race or ethnicity," said Robin
Mamlet, dean of admission and
financial aid.
"The charge that affirmative ac
tion always leads to quotas is fun
damentally wrong," Fraga said.
"Quotas imply special privileges
for certain groups, and special
privileges imply unequal treat
ment and even the idea that peo
ple are being accepted and hired
who are otherwise unqualified.
