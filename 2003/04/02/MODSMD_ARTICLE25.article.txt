With its long-standing commit
ment to admissions policies pro
moting racial and ethnic diversity,
Stanford will likely be impacted by
current Supreme Court cases
challenging the affirmative action
policies of the University of Michi
gan. The cases, which were ar
gued yesterday, revisit three
decades of debate on a national
and University level.
The University's history with
affirmative action started in 1965
with President Lyndon John
son's executive order requiring
states, local governments and
private entities receiving federal
dollars to make special efforts to
hire members of groups which
have been discriminated against
in the past.
Affirmative action was ex
panded in 1969 by President
Richard Nixon's executive
order, which made such pro
grams compulsory for all federal
agencies.
"These were the two big initial
national government efforts in
the affirmative action issue," said
Luis Fraga, an associate professor
of political science. "It's impor
tant to recognize, however, that
they were executive orders, not
laws, and had no consensus in
Congress."
This, according to Fraga,
makes them especially vulnerable
to both congressional and court
interpretation, accounting for the
mutability of the University's af
firmative action and admission
policies.

"The [University's] policy has
evolved," Fraga said. "There have
been laws passed, specific funds al
located and programs established
which have written into them that
affirmative action efforts should be
attained. Yet the specific require
ments have varied tremendously
over time."
Stanford adopted its own affir
mative action policy within the
broad set of 112 ederal guidelines, re
acting to pertinent laws and court
cases, notably the 1978 Bakke
Supreme Court case.
"1 can't recall that the funda
mental premise of affirmative ac
tion was ever called into question
at Stanford," said Albert Camar
illo, a professor of history.
"[However,] there have been
several instances where specific
policies and practices were dis
cussed and modified."
In the Michigan case, Stanford
has reiterated its supportive stance
on affirmative action by filing an
amicus curiae brief with the
Supreme Court supporting sup
porting the public university's
policies.
Camarillo said, "President
[John] Hennessy and Provost
[John] Etchemendy have both
forcefully and articulately advocat
ed for Stanford's long-standing
commitment to affirmative action
policies for students, faculty and
staff, as much so or more than any
previous administration in my
three-decade-long career at the
University."
Faculty members agree that af
firmative action has played a
major role in shaping the Univer
sity's student body as well as the

campus' intellectual environment.
"Affirmative action has had
the greatest impact on Stanford
and other universities with re
gard to the undergraduate stu
dent population," Camarillo
said. "A generation or so ago,
Stanford and most universities
had few minority students.
When I started at UCLA, as a
freshman in 1966, there were
only 44 other Mexican Ameri
cans on campus [among tens of
thousands of students], though
nearly a million Mexican Ameri
cans lived in the L.A. metropoli
tan area," he said.
According to Fraga, much of
the public negativity surrounding
affirmative action is rooted in two
key terms: quotas and special priv
ileges. Michigan has recently been
accused by the Bush administra
tion of employing a quota system
in its admissions process, violating
the Bakke ruling, which outlawed
the use of quotas.
"Stanford's admission process
has never relied on a formulaic
method of selection, nor have
any quotas been utilized in our
admission process with regard to
race or ethnicity," said Robin
Mamlet, dean of admission and
financial aid.
"The charge that affirmative ac
tion always leads to quotas is fun
damentally wrong," Fraga said.
"Quotas imply special privileges
for certain groups, and special
privileges imply unequal treat
ment and even the idea that peo
ple are being accepted and hired
who are otherwise unqualified.

Students supporting affirmative action give away free cookies at February's freebake. The event, hosted by the Stu
dents for Educational Equity, was designed to counter a proposed anti-affirmative action bake sale.
But is this a necessary part of affir
mative action? No.
The University's faculty and ad
ministration cites the campus' di
versity as one of its greatest assets,
emphasized by the announcement
that the recently accepted ('lass of
2007 will represent the most
racially diverse class ever to enter

the University.
"We believe that a student body
that is both highly qualified and di
verse in terms of culture, class, eth
nicity, interests and life experi
ences is essential to the education
al process," Mamlet said.
Fraga noted that one of the
most common and successful justi
fications for affirmative action poli
cies is that diversity can improve
the operation of specific organiza
tions, especially universities.
"[However], you have to make

sure this person brings a perspec
tive and experience that will help
the organization to do its normal
work better," he added.
Although the Supreme Court's
ruling will target public institu
tions and federal organizations,
the outcome may still influence
Stanford's admission policies in
the future.
"If the court rules against the
University of Michigan, but does
not alter the legal basis established
in the Bakke case, then Stanford

will be able to maintain its policies
without any problem," said Ca
marillo. "If the court overturns the
Bakke decision, I'm not sure what
ultimate impact it will have on
Stanford's undergraduate admis
sions policies."
Mamlet echoed Camarillo's un
certainty, but affirmed Stanford's
stance on the issue.
"Stanford is strongly commit
ted to educating a community of
students that is diverse in many
ways, and although our efforts to

attract and enroll a diverse class
could certainly be hindered if the
Supreme Court rules against the
University of Michigan, so much
depends on the nuances of the rul
ing," she said.
Clayborne Carson, a professor
of history and the director the
Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers
Project, expressed his belief the
Court's ruling will be narrowly
tailored in such a way that it will
not have a decisive impact on the
policies of private institutions

such as Stanford. Yet he thinks
all institutions should remain
vigilant.
"A decision against the Uni
versity of Michigan, even though
it may he fairly narrowly drawn,
will send a signal to all institu
tions that they can relax their ef
forts to bring about racial diversi
ty," Carson said. "Even though
places like Stanford won't be di
rectly covered by the decision, I
think it could have a definite in
direct impact."
