# Students feel uneasy about campus debate
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While the Supreme Court
heard oral arguments about the
University of Michigan's affir
mative action policies, which
Stanford's administration sup
ported in an amicus curiae brief,
University students described
mixed perceptions about the
openness and extent of the cur
rent campus affirmative action
debate. Most supported affirma
tive action and the University's
stance, but expressed concern
regarding the ability of those
against affirmative action to
freely express their views.
Not necessarily
'a daily concern'
Many students reported that
affirmative action is not a matter

frequently on their minds.
"For me personally, affirma
tive action has not come up in
talks with my friends," said
sophomore Jack Chung.
"I've heard a couple people
talking about affirmative action,"
echoed sophomore Lindsey
Brisbin. 'But I do not think it is
being discussed widely on cam
pus."
However, there were a signif
icant number of students, both
supporters and skeptics, who re
ported otherwise.
Chris Drake, a senior who is
in favor of affirmative action,
stated that he reflects on such is
sues "very often."
Some community members
explained that their attention
given to affirmative action varies.
