# Students feel uneasy about campus debate
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
While the Supreme Court
heard oral arguments about the
University of Michigan's affir
mative action policies, which
Stanford's administration sup
ported in an amicus curiae brief,
University students described
mixed perceptions about the
openness and extent of the cur
rent campus affirmative action
debate. Most supported affirma
tive action and the University's
stance, but expressed concern
regarding the ability of those
against affirmative action to
freely express their views.
Not necessarily
'a daily concern'
Many students reported that
affirmative action is not a matter

frequently on their minds.
"For me personally, affirma
tive action has not come up in
talks with my friends," said
sophomore Jack Chung.
"I've heard a couple people
talking about affirmative action,"
echoed sophomore Lindsey
Brisbin. 'But I do not think it is
being discussed widely on cam
pus."
However, there were a signif
icant number of students, both
supporters and skeptics, who re
ported otherwise.
Chris Drake, a senior who is
in favor of affirmative action,
stated that he reflects on such is
sues "very often."
Some community members
explained that their attention
given to affirmative action varies.
"I've seen recently that a discus
sion exists and have been increas
ingly aware, but I have not fol
lowed it too closely," said sopho
more Tom Hanada.
Brian Brookshire, a sopho
more, explained that "I only real
ly think about affirmative action
when big news buzzes go around
about the University changing
policy.
"It's not really a daily concern
for me," he added.
Awareness has recently increased
While most students said that af
firmative action is not a frequent
concern, many noted that the issue
has come up more frequently in re
cent months due to the nationwide
controversy surrounding the Uni
versity of Michigan Supreme
Court cases.
"[The case] compels me to not
only think about affirmative action,
but to participate in efforts to chal
lenge the ongoing efforts to repeal
it," said Adrienne Carey Hurley, a
postdoctorate fellow at the Insti
tute for International Studies.
Drake said that "I also believe it
encourages more on-campus dis
cussion, which is always great to see
because it will get people to really
consider and re-consider their
views on the issue."
Students also noted that Stan
ford's statement of support for
Michigan's policies has especially
stimulated campus debate.
Freshman Alyssa Schwartz ex
plained that "I think it has encour
aged discussion.
"It relates us to the case," she
continued. "Otherwise, since we
are a private school, we might think
it does not matter and would not
talk about it."
Hurley explained that "given
the impressive number of success
ful student-initiated events and fo
rums related to affirmative action
since President Hennessy's state
ment, I think it's safe to say that the
University's pro-affirmative action
position has encouraged engage
ment and discussion."
"As far as discussion is con
cerned, I think the University mak
ing any sort of statements at all
about affirmative action is likely to
produce some dialogue," Brook
shire said. "That seems about the
only time it is ever mentioned."
Pros and cons of the University's
position
Many community members dis
agreed about whether the Univer
sity should have taken a stance on
the Michigan case.

"Stanford [administrators]
must take a stand and firmly en
dorse their own ideals," said fresh
man Linda Trail. "By voicing their
support of affirmative action, the
University renews and reaffirms
their commitment to its students,
to fostering the best and most en
riching and diverse environment
as possible."
Schwartz said that "the Univer
sity making a stance was very im
portant."
"We use a policy and have .52
percent students of color in the
freshman class," she continued. "It
would be irresponsible for the Uni
versity not to say anything if we do
support it."
Sophomore Ming Thanarat
said that he felt "it is [a] good thing
that the University does come out
and say this is what we want our
policy to be just to make itself clear,
whether it is pro or con."
Others disagreed, both with the
University's ideological stance and
the fact that it took a side.
"Stanford's position is vague
while still managing to be racist,
discriminatory towards poor appli
cants and demeaning to the
achievements of minorities," said
sophomore Robbie Su. "Stanford's
policy is wrong."
Another student said Stanford's
involvement impacts students' abil
ity to to express their views.
"It is wrong the University took
a side on an issue such as this," said
junior Adam Haas. "Why are they
getting involved with these sorts of
cases? I think it negatively impacts
the ability of students to feel like
they can freely speak out on an
issue when they know their admin
istration is on one side."
Comfort levels among students
Students also differed in their
feelings about the freedom of fel
low students to express their views.
Most students agreed that they
felt it is more difficult for those op
posed to affirmative action to make
their opinions known.
"I am comfortable showing my
disdain for affirmative action," Su
said. "But I feel that many people
are afraid to voice their criticism or
figure they are not qualified in
their views because 'they don't
know what it's like.' "
Brookshire, another skeptic of
affirmative action, explained that
"I do feel some hesitation about
being very open with my disap
proval of affirmative action.
"Whether affirmative action is a
good idea or not, I think that fear
of being viewed as racist or insensi
tive is a real and detrimental factor
that goes into affirmative action
policy. Once such a policy is in
place, it's very difficult for it to be
altered without coming under
heavy fire."

Schwartz said she felt affirma
tive action was not as subject to hos
tile discussion as other topics, but
still noticed that the University
population appeared dispropor
tionately in favor of affirmative ac
tion.
"Affirmative action is one of
those subjects that does not fall
down party lines," she said. "This
makes it easier to discuss. The ten
sions between left and right are not
there as much. [But on campus,] I
think there is a definite slant to
ward pro-affirmative action. The
campus is a liberal institution."
Senior Travis Menk explained
that lie thought "people are scared
to say anything."
"If you say anything against
affirmative action, they will
throw back that you are a racist,"
he continued. "[Others] want to
tell you [the campus] is open and
conducive to dialogue, but it is
not."
"Just from my personal experi
ence, I think it can get to a very
personal discussion that may not
get anywhere," said sophomore
Vivian Wang. "I think if you are
against affirmative action, you may
feel more restricted to express
your opinion."
Chris Bruner, a junior, said
that, while he recognized the
greater difficulties for those
against affirmative action, he still
felt that "both viewpoints are well
represented."
Brisbin noted that it also might
be difficult for some minorities to
speak out on affirmative action, for
"if they were benefited by the affir
mative action program, they might
not want to say anything."
However, she added that "it
seems to be a pretty open campus,
so I don't think people would have
too much of a problem about it."
Drake suggested that both sides
of the argument might be more in
clined to remain silent, rather than
discussing their views.
"People are generally averse to
being labeled 'racist' and those on
both sides of the argument claim
that those on the other are racist."
Drake said. "I feel that there's a
kind of'don't ask, don't tell' policy
operating among people who
aren't clearly in favor of or against
affirmative action, because they'll
feel safer from labeling by avoiding
the debate."
Thanarat expressed a more pos
itive outlook on the situation.
"I think Stanford students are
open-minded and mature enough
to talk about affirmative action or
anything else," he said. "I don't
think it has a special taboo to it. I
feel that as long as any opinions are
backed up by something proper, I
don't think anyone should or does
feel restrained to express their
opinions."
