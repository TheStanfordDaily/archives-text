Bush administration lawyer
describes admissions policy as
a I thinly disguised quota
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Supreme Court
justices, confronting affirmative action in high
er education for the first time since outlawing
quotas 25 years ago, debated yesterday
whether colleges and universities may legally
consider race when admitting students.
Hearing oral arguments on admissions poli
cies at the University of Michigan and its law
school, the justices aggressively questioned
lawyers for plaintiffs and the school. The Bush
administration's top lawyer also took part, ar
guing that the university's law school program
"is a thinly disguised quota."
But Solicitor General Theodore Olson
stopped short of declaring that race could
never be part of admissions policies, and sever
al justices made the point that the high court
has allowed limited use of race as a criterion in
other contexts.
Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court's only
black member, broke his customary silence
during oral arguments to closely question a
University of Michigan lawyer about whether

affirmative action has furthered the broader
social goal of racial understanding and harmo
ny.
"Do you think your admissions [policies] at
least provided some headwind toward that?"
Thomas asked.
The arguments took place in the ornate
courtroom as a crowd of 5,000 to 7,000 mostly
pro-affirmative action demonstrators carried
placards and shouted slogans outside.
Not since the Court ruled out quotas in the
University of California v. Bakke decision a
quarter-century ago had justices come to such
a direct confrontation with the affirmative ac
tion issue. Their decision, expected in J uly, will
be awaited not only by higher education but by
the business world as well.
Kirk Kolbo, a lawyer for the two white ap
plicants rejected by the university and its law
school, told the justices the goal of promoting
diversity on campuses is not a compelling rea
son to justify giving preferential treatment to
minorities.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, considered a
key swing vote on this issue, said law schools
make many choices in picking students, and
she wondered aloud why they could not also
consider race.
Said Olson, "They're using stereotypes in

an effort, they say, to break clown stereotypes."
In a fractured ruling in the 1978 Bakke
case, the Court struck down quota systems but
left some room for race to be a factor in uni
versity admissions.
Olson, in fact, stopped short of calling on
the Court to end affirmative action. And
O'Connor pressed him on whether the Court
should uses these cases to ban the use of race as
a consideration.
"We're reluctant to say never," he said.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, another key
vote, asked Kolbo if colleges should be con
cerned when blacks and Hispanics are under
represented, making up a small percentage of
students.
"We need to get away from the notion that
there's some right number," he responded.
Kennedy said that leaders often look at di
versity, adcling: "1 should think that's a very le
gitimate concern of the state."
The Court was hearing back-to-back argu
ments, asking how and whether race can be a
factor when public colleges and universities
choose their students. The Court's ruling
could effectively end any state-sponsored affir
mative action, or it could rewrite the rules for
