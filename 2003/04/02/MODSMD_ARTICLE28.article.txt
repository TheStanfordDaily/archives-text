# Students march for affirmative action
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Washington, D.C. — Yesterday
more than 30 students from Stan
ford joined around thousands of
other affirmative action support
ers from around the country to
rally in front of the Supreme Court
as oral arguments were heard for
two cases challenging the Univer
sity of Michigan's existing affirma
tive action policies.
As those directly involved in
the cases climbed the marble steps
of the nation's highest court in the
cold and rainy morning, speakers
ranging from the Rev. Jesse Jack
son to Sen. Edward Kennedy (1)-
Mass.) delivered oratories to the
crowd below. The members of
Stanford's Students Of Color
Coalition — as well as scores of
other civil rights, religious and
government organizations,
unions and student groups —
held signs, sang songs and
marched from the Court down
the National Mall to the Lincoln
Memorial to show their support
for the policies.

Organizers estimated that
50,000 supporters of affirmative
action joined in the march, noting
that marchers surrounded much
of the Reflecting Pool. The Associ
ated Press saitl 5,000 to 7,000 peo
ple were present.
The majority of the marchers
were black, but a wide range of
people and organizations came to
gether at the Court as the cases
began — even a group who called
themselves the "Angry White
Males for Affirmative Action."
"I thought it was really good to
see so many different people of
different ethnicities marching to
gether towards the common goal
of getting minorities into higher
education," said junior Marcus
Williams, a representative of the
Stanford chapter of the NAACP.
Hoku Jeffrey, <» UC-Berkeley
senior and the organizer of the
California contingent of the
march, was equally enthusiastic.
"Today, tens of thousands of
high school and college students,
labor union members and civil
rights organization members
stood proud to light, to save the

dream of Brown v. Board of Edu
cation, the dream for integration
and real equality."
While opponents of affirmative
action have also been protesting at
the capital in recent weeks, they
were not out in force yesterday.
After spending Monday morn
ing and afternoon speaking about
college admissions and affirmative
action at D.C. high schools, SOCC
students joined with several thou
sand others from Howard Univer
sity that evening fora march across
the city from Howard to the Court,
where many stayed the whole
night in preparation for yester
day's rally.
For SOCC members, the trip to
D.C. was an important part of their
campaign to preserve and increase
affirmative action policies both na
tionally and at Stanford. For some,
it was their first time protesting.
"I thought it was a good idea
to protest in Washington, D.C.,
to be present at the Supreme
Court where the important deci
