# Students on affirmative action
## 
### 
Yesterday, the Supreme Court heard oral argu
ments in Gratz vs. Bollinger and Grutter vs.
Bollinger, two cases brought against the University
of Michigan that have resparked the national de
bate over affirmative action. The decision could
force Stanford to alter its use of race in making ad
missions decisions and has been billed as the biggest
challenge to affirmative action since the 1978 Re
gents vs. Bakke case.
The Daily talked to students around campus yes
terday about the University of Michigan case and
affirmative action in general.
"There is so much structural racism that is really
subtle, and I feel that racism is still prevalent, it just
isn't as blatant. There is a historical legacy of people
of [color] getting screwed by the system and, for this
reason, quotas and affirmative action are a good
thing and necessary. A lot of people want to pre
tend things are now, but that just isn't the case."
— Nicky Jones, senior
"Balance is key, especially for academic institu
tions. Having a mixed group of students gets peo
ple exposed, ensures that people aren't sheltered
by the system and makes fora more interesting ed
ucational environment."
— Christy O'Gonner, senior
"Quotas and admissions should be more about
the situation that a person is coming from — as in
they should be about what people start with and
how they use that. You can't assume, using just
race, that a person is underprivileged. There
needs to be more depth and analysis. The individ
ual as a whole needs to be considered. In general,
quantifying something like race or ethnicity with
numbers is just as detrimental as not considering
those factors at all."
— Sagar Chandaria, junior
"If history has systematically discriminated
against an identifiable group of people, it is neces

sary not only to eliminate those discriminatory poli
cies, but also to reverse the product of that discrim
ination until we reach a time when the effects of the
discrimination are negligible. This is true especially
in terms of education because of the role education
plays in providing children and citizens with the at
least minimal amount of equality of opportunity
they deserve as members of a liberal society. I think
it is important to recognize that even when a white
student looks the same on an application to school
as a black student, in all too many cases, those stu
dents are not in fact equal applicants. The minority
student had much more difficult barriers to over
come to get where she is.
"That said, I think it would make much more
sense to focus affirmative action policies on people
of disadvantaged socioeconomic status than it does
on race, but so long as race is so tightly correlated
with socioeconomic status, I am not ready to criti
cize affirmative action policies as [being] wrong.
Additionally, I would say that the goals of affirma
tive action in higher education and employment
would be much better met if we refocused our at
tention on creating an 'affirmative action' for ele
mentary and secondary schools so as to improve the
real chances of underprivileged minorities."
— Emily Cuatto, senior
"Quotas are necessary, especially in higher edu
cation. There are huge social divisions — both
racial and monetary — and that needs to be taken
into consideration. However, this whole process
should really start earlier on and there needs to be
more done to give younger children, regardless of
race or socioeconomic status, high quality educa
tion to prepare them for places like Stanford."
— Danielle Moore, junior
"Diversity is important. But in today's society,
the issue is one of money more than race."
— Lindsey Dahms, sophomore
