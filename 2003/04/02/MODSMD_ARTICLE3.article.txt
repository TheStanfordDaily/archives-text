# More seniors opt to coterm

### STEPHANIE NGUYEN 
As the last quarter of the school year
has arrived, many seniors have been
forced to finally decide their plans for
next year. With the economy in a slump
this year, a popular option for many se
niors has been the Coterminal Program
offered by Stanford.
The Coterminal Program, more com
monly know as the "coterm" program, al
lows undergraduates to simultaneously
earn a bachelor's and master's degree in
five years. The two degrees do not have to
be in the same departments, although
they may be. Applicants can apply every
quarter.
According to the Office of the Regis
trar, in winter quarter 2003, of the 6,692
matriculated undergraduate students,
202 students are coterms at the under
graduate level. Of the 7,421 matriculated
graduate students, 271 students are
coterms at the graduate level.
Daisy Pistey-Lyhne, a senior who was
accepted to the earth systems coterm pro
gram, cited two main reasons why
coterming is appealing.
"My undergraduate education in earth
systems was very broad, and I wanted to
gain more depth in one subject area be
fore heading out into the 'real world,' "
she said. "There are a number of wonder
ful faculty here who study this field, and I
look forward to working with them more
in-depth. The depressed economy only

further reinforces my desire to be in
school, rather than looking fora job."
Senior Sam Rang agreed, adding
"Cotermfing] allow[s] me to earn my mas
ter's degree in only one extra year because
I am taking graduate classes now. Anoth
er benefit [is] that I have other friends
who are also coterming."
Rang is a mechanical engineering
coterm.
Making career plans after undergradu
ate schooling can be a very stressful and
confusing time.
"I delayed taking the [Graduate
Record Examination] and requesting let
ters of recommendation until the last
minute," admitted senior Chris Gearhart,
who is a computer science coterm. "This
made assembling the application on time
more stressful than it should have been."
He also advises upcoming seniors to
"take advantage of Stanford's undergrad
uate research opportunities." He added,
"I regard my research experience as the
single most valuable part of my education
here. Research can also work wonders for
graduate school applications."
The application process for coterm
programs includes two recommendation
letters from Stanford faculty, a prelimi
nary program proposal about research
ideas, a statement of purpose describing
the purpose for pursuing the master's de
gree, a Stanford transcript and GRE
