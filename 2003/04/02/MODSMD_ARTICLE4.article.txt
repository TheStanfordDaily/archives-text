Stanford senior Lena Kay Rufus died suddenly on
March 28 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
Hospital after a long battle with lupus, a chronic in
flammatory disease. She was 22.
Rufus spent the past two quarters at home but was
planning to come back to Stanford this quarter, ac
cording to her friend Greg Novick, who was looking
forward to her return.
"Unfortunately, she had the onset of some sudden
symptoms which prompted her to be hospitalized on
Wednesday night," Novick said. "Her condition wors
ened quickly and she passed away early Friday morn
ing."
Rufus, an international relations major, was raised
in Wisconsin and was a 1999 Washburn High School
honors graduate, according to the Ashland Daily
Press. She was also "deeply involved" in student orga
nizations throughout her high school career, and
friend Tali Golan, a senior, described Rufus as an "ac
tive participant" in Stanford student life.
Rufus' friends emphasized the strength she dis
played throughout the course of her illness.
"Lena had lupus, but she was a strong woman and
did her best to not let it affect her," Novick said.
According to Golan, "She didn't want people to
