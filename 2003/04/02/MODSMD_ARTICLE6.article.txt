### GENEVIEVE GUZMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night at the Stanford
Bookstore, New York Times
deputy editorial page editor and
reporter Philip Taubman, Class of
1970, signed copies of his recently
published book "Secret Empire:
Eisenhower, The CIA, and the
Hidden Story of America's Space
Espionage," in which he reveals
much of the once-classified history
of U.S. spy satellites.
Taubman's interest in the topic
of spy satellites stemmed from sto
ries he wrote on the intelligence
agencies in Washington, D.C., in
the early 1980s. At that time, most
of the top-secret information re
ceived in Washington came from
spy satellites, Taubman said. All of
the documents associated with
these satellites were unavailable to
the public except by special ap
peal.
"In 1995, Bill Clinton declassi
fied the materials associated with
Corona [the first photo-reconnais
sance satellite]. I realized that a
motherlode of historical material
was suddenly accessible," Taub

man said. "It would have taken a
lifetime to pry out that informa
tion through freedom of informa
tion applications."
Taubman reviewed thousands
of these formerly confidential doc
uments and interviewed many of
the pioneering scientists involved
in the spy satellite programs in
preparation for his book. Con
cerning the final product, the jack
et of "Secret Empire" reads,
"[Taubman] reconstructs the cru
cial meetings, conversations and
decisions that guided the develop
ment of the spy plane and satellite
projects during one of the most
perilous times in our history."
In the story of this secret em
pire, Taubman acknowledges the
influential roles of five individuals
connected with Stanford who were
directly involved with the Ameri
can spy satellites.
Two who are still affiliated with
the University are Sidney Drell,
professor emeritus at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
and William Perry, professor of
management science and engi
neering. Drell, former deputy di
rector of SLAC, advised the gov
ernment on intelligence projects
for 40 years. Perry, who also did
graduate work in engineering at
Stanford and is now involved
with the Hoover Institution, was
secretary of defense during Clin
ton's first term as president and
helped invent some of the most
advanced eavesdropping satel
lites still used today.
Although Taubman was driven
to write his book mostly because of
interest, he feels strongly about
the historical significance of the
content in "Secret Empire."
"It tells a story that was not
completely untold but it provides
the first account of what I think is
a critical chapter of Cold War his
tory that remained secret for

many decades," Taubman said.
But even the increasingly om
niscient network of spy satellites
had its faults.
"The systems that we created
became so powerful in terms of
gathering information that we ne
glected the development of
human agents to recruit infor
mants in other parts of the world,"
Taubman said. "It was partly be
cause we didn't have those agents
on the ground that we were un
aware of the plot on 9 / II."
A balance needs to be estab
lished between spy satellite sys
tems and human agents for opti
mal intelligence gathering, Taub
man said. As the jacket of the book
concludes, "Now, as we wage a
new and more vicious war against
terrorism, we will need both ma
chines in space and spies on the
ground to fight back."
Philip Taubman was the editor
in chief of The Stanford Daily in
1969.
