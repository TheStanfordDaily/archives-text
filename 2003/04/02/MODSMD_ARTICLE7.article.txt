# What are you going to do...
## When you get screwed? 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The music is going but there's no one dancing. A
freshman, who wishes to remain anonymous, has just
returned from dinner with his blind date before her
dorm's screw your roommate dance. His date sug
gests they hang out in her room.
He said the date was going all right, but when she
started playing Pakistani techno music, it took mat
ters to a whole new level.
"When she went to put on some music, I was ex
pecting hip-hop but instead I hear this music and I
was like, 'This is interesting, but I have to get up real
early tomorrow because I have a lot of homework to
do,'" he said.
Screw your roommate might not be an enjoyable
experience for everyone, but at least some students
go home with a memorable story.
According to the tradition, students are supposed
to fix their roommate up with a date. There is always
a dance and sometimes students take their date out to
dinner beforehand.
The name comes from an old tradition where fra
ternity brothers would hook their roommate up with
the ugliest girl they could find. At
modern-day Stanford, most stu
dents find an attractive date that
their roommate has already
checked out in the freshman face
book.
Richard Bolton, a senior living
in Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, had this
strategy when searching for his
date.
"So I scoped out chicks from
the facebook and I found the one
with the hottest face," Bolton said.
"And 1 extrapolated that the hot
face would precipitate a hot bod."
According to Bolton, his date
met his expectations.
Freshman Colleen Ferrand-
Andrew, who lives in Donner,
went with a friend from her dorm.
She got dressed up as a punk to
make the evening interesting. She
wore a pink wig, combat boots, a
leather skirt and a see-through
top with her bra underneath.
Ferrand-Andrew said that the
people she met that night did not
recognize her afterwards.
"People would say they didn't
remember meeting me, and I

would tell them that they definite
ly did meet me â€” I was the one
wearing the pink wig," she said.
Most students have a more low
key experience.
Freshman Derek Alley, who
went to Otero's screw your room
mate, said that nothing too inter
esting happened but that he still
enjoyed himself.
"I definitely didn't get
'screwed' as in set up with a horri
ble date," Alley said. "But I will
say, the dance was a little 'high
school.' The theme was 'screw
prom,' but I still had a good time."
Some people went out with
older students, which proved ad
vantageous for those without cars.
Freshman Joe Kirscher went with
a senior to Donner's screw your
roommate dance. Since Kirsher
did not have a car, his date drove
and he paid for dinner.
He said that he enjoyed himself
and that he would be willing to go
again.
Although Kirscher did not
drink, he said that he enjoyed
watching the drunken stupor of
others.
"The best part of the evening
was staying up really late and
watching all of the RAs dance
drunk."
