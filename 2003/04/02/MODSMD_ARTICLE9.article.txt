A photo caption on the front page of yester
day's Daily indicated that the couple in the
picture had been married in Memorial
Church on Sunday. During the school year,
there are no weddings on Sundays.
In yesterday's Daily, there was an error in
the story "Court to hear Michigan cases."
While a sentence read "When asked if a
ruling against Michigan would force Stan
ford to change the role of affirmative ac
tion policies, Pamela Karlan, a professor of
public interest law, responded 'The short
answer is almost certainly yes,"' Karlan's
response was actually to a different ques
tion. The question was whether a decision
in the Michigan cases would have implica
tions for private universities' admissions
practices.
