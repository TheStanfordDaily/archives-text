"How I Write"
Conversations
Co-Sponsored by Undergraduate Research Programs
and the Stanford Writing Center
"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the
nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the
conversation will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer compos
es, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and
delights. We will discuss how a writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines
research with composition, overcomes various impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic
innovations. Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can learn
and grow, and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.
Robert Sapolsky, Professor Neurology and Neurological Sciences
Robert Sapolsky is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, a research associate with the
Institute of Primate Research Museums of Kenya, and a recipient of a Mac Arthur Fellowship. At
the same time, he has been called "one of the best scientist-writers of our time" by Oliver Sacks
and "one of the finest natural history writers around" by The New York Times. Prof. Sapolsky has
produced, in addition to numerous scientific papers, books for broader audiences, including A
Primate's Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons, Why Zebras Don't Get
