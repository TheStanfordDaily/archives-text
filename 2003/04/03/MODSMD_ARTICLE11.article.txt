## Glitches found in tracking software 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
The system for tracking foreign
students needs better oversight,
more training for users and
more money for enforcement to
be the kind of anti-terrorism tool
Congress wants, an auditor told
a House committee yesterday.
The Student Exchange and
Visitor Information System,
SEVIS, was supposed to be run
ning at the start of the year, but
it continues to have software
glitches and other problems.
"We believe SEVIS has po
tential to improve monitoring of
foreign students in the United
States," said Glenn Eine, justice
department inspector general.
"However, additional steps have
to be taken to ensure it is reli
able, usable and effective."
Eine testified before the
House Judiciary immigration
subcommittee.
Congress revived a plan to
keep close tabs on foreign stu
dents after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. The system was sup
posed to be in place by Jan. 1.
The Internet-based system is
supposed to list by Aug. 1 names
and information on all foreign
ers studying in the United
States. It would replace paper
files kept on campuses.
Fine said his office's review of
the system found that its opera
tors and users need more train

ing. Contractors sent to investi
gate participating schools are
also not well trained, and the sys
tem is unable to handle the vol
ume of data intended, he said.
Other problems schools have
reported is that the system loses
information.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.,
said Stanford University sent
her a seven-page memo of prob
lems it was experiencing as re
cently as Tuesday. Among Stan
ford's complaints is that the help
desk often provides contradicto
ry and wrong information.
"If a school like Stanford Uni
versity with all its scientists and
computers...can't make this
work, I wonder about the small
er colleges," Lofgren said.
Despite the problems, a
Homeland Security Depart
ment official in charge of the sys
tem assured committee mem
bers the problems will be fixed.
"The tracking system allows
us to . . . better identify and
track those who come to Amer
ica for illicit reasons," said
Johnny Williams, interim di
rector of the Department of
Homeland Security's Immi
gration and Customs Enforce
ment bureau.
Congress provided $36.8
million for the initial phase of
the system, but is relying on stu
dent fees to pay for other costs.
