# Baghdad within sight of U.S. troops

### 
(AP) — American forces
fought their way to within sight of
the Baghdad skyline yesterday,
and officials claimed the destruc
tion of a pair of once-menacing
Republican Guard divisions.
Some Iraqis discarded their mili
tary uniforms by the roadside to
hide their identity.
Bombs shook the capital as
Army and Marine armored
columns took separate, converg
ing paths toward the city from the
south. "The dagger is clearly
pointed" at the heart of Saddam
Hussein's regime, said Brig. Gen.
Vincent Brooks.
The rapid advances brought
thousands of troops within the red
zone — an imaginary line on the
map near the capital where Iraqi
use of weapons of mass destruction
is most feared. Troops in some
lead Army units donned chemical
protection suits, and Marine heli
copter pilots were ordered to be
prepared to do so.
The military campaign un
folded as Pfc. Jessica Lynch, a 19-
year-old prisoner of war freed in
a daring nighttime rescue, was
flown to Germany for medical
treatment.
But the joy over her freedom
was tempered by word that the spe
cial rescue forces also found 11
bodies. "We have reason to believe
some of them were Americans,"
said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp.
Increasingly, there were signs
that Iraqi civilians were eager for
the arrival of invading forces.
Some smiled and waved as
Marines rolled through
Nasiriyah in tanks and other mil

itary vehicles.
There were moments of hu
manity, as well, in the 2-week-old
war. In Nasiriyah, American
snipers summoned help for an
Iraqi woman in labor in a pickup
truck. Navy Hospitalman Ist Class
Kyle Morris delivered a healthy
baby and named her "America."
"It was a pretty cool way to start
the day,"he said.
But there was bad news, too.
The U.S. Central Command,
which is overseeing the war, said it
was investigating reports that war

planes had bombed a Red Crescent
maternity hospital in Baghdad.
Despite the gains on the battle
field, Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld and others cau
tioned that some of the toughest
fighting of the military campaign
may lie ahead, seeking to dampen
speculation that the war might
end quickly.
Iraq insisted the battlefield was
tilting its way, and Al-Jazeera, an
Arab satellite TV station, said
about 30 Yemenis arrived in the
capital carrying AK-47s and shout

ing pro-Hussein slogans.
"Victory is ours," Saddam said
in a statement issued in his name.
But that was increasingly at
odds with the accounts offered by
American military commanders
as well as reporters covering
front-line Army and Marine
forces swiftly advancing on Hus
sein's capital.
"Our guys are able to see the
skyline. That's how close we've
gotten," said one military official,
speaking on condition of
anonymity.
