## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Why student voice matters 
### 
The Daily Pennsylvanian re
ported on Monday that Presi
dent George W. Bush had an
nounced that he would make
an effort to listen to college students'
thoughts on the war and would consider
their suggestions for future military
based decisions.
Bush's announcement was surprising.
It was well-conceived — even admirable.
But it was fabricated.
The article, which appeared in the
University of Pennsylvania's campus
newspaper, was intended as a pre-April
Fool's joke. But the main issue it raised is
far from a laughing matter. The presi
dent should listen to what college stu
dents have to say about foreign policy.
College students represent the future
of this nation. They are the leaders who
will shape this country's policy and path
way, and what they have to say is worthy

of consideration by
the Bush administra
tion.
So, we ask: Why has
President Bush re
fused to hear — or
even acknowledge —
the strong anti-war
sentiments that have
been expressed on
college campuses in
the past few months?
Hundreds of stu
dents took to the
Quad on March 6 in
Stanford's first stu
dent strike since the
Vietnam War. But ,
they were not alone.

They joined students at 260 other cam
puses across the country in rallying
against a pre-emptive war on Iraq.
The fact that so many college students
took part in the "Books Not Bombs"
strike should have sent a strong message
to Bush, and would have been wise to re
spond. The strike was also covered in
many metropolitan and college newspa
pers in the nation. Yet Bush never ac
knowledged these efforts.
Two weeks later, the president ap
peared on television to declare war
against Iraq.
Most students still do not know what
led to his decision. Many Stanford stu
dents, frustrated by the situation, took to
the streets the following day to try to shut
down San Francisco. But again, these ac
tions were ignored by the president.
The president should pay attention to

College students have a vested
interest in having their voices
heard by politicians. The fu
ture will be determined by the
decisions Bush is making in
office now. And todays college
students will be ones to lead
the society that Bush will
leave behind.

and the opinions of college students. If
for no other reason, it would have been a
wise political maneuver; Bush will be
running for re-election in less than two
years. College students will vote in that
election, and they will remember the
president as a politician who refused to
hear their arguments.
Furthermore, now that war has been
declared, many of the troops who are
fighting in Iraq are of the college-student
age. They have left behind their friends,
their siblings, their families. And they
might not return. Shouldn't Bush listen
to the peers of those who are fighting?
But the real reason that Bush —or
any politician — should listen to the peo
ple goes deeper than that. The United
States is a democracy. Its leaders are
elected into office. And U.S. citizens
should, through vocal and peaceful
means, be able to influence their policy

makers.
College students
have a vested interest
in having their voices
heard by politicians.
The future will be de
termined by decisions
Bush is making in of
fice now. And today's
college students will be
the ones to lead the so
ciety that Bush will
leave behind. College
students have a gen
uine concern about the
state of our nation, and
the president needs to
care.
The importance

of campus protests was first established
with the Vietnam War. During that time,
students at Stanford — and at virtually
ever other college in the nation — voiced
their opposition to the draft. They asked
for the United States to end their in
volvement in the war. And they ultimate
ly succeeded.
President Bush has refused to listen to
the protests of college students in declar
ing this war against Iraq, but students
should not give up. They should contin
ue to protest, if they are among the vocal
group at this campus who believe this
war should not have started and should
not continue. They should continue to
send letters to local politicians. They
should continue their fight against this
war.
It's their fundamental democratic
right.
