Anti-war protesters are the real "troops"
It seems there was an important omis
sion from my letter to the editor, "Faith in
our troops" (April 2). The troops I support
are the ones on the streets of our own
cities, protesting the war, shutting down
business as usual and risking arrest to
voice their opposition against the U.S.
government.
These people are the ones who are
truly fighting for freedom, truth and jus
tice. These are the "troops" that I whole
heartedly support and who give me hope
for the future of this country, not the ones
blindly following the orders of a govern
ment at fault.

Thank you, Stanford
A few weeks ago, as I walked to teach
a class, I was hit by a car at the pedestri
an crossing of Salvatierra Street and
Campus Drive. I want to thank
all those who rushed to help and
comfort me. I also want to thank
the police for the quick and kind
response and the paramedics
who took wonderful care of me
on the way to the emergency
room of the hospital where again
everyone was great. I am very
grateful to all.
