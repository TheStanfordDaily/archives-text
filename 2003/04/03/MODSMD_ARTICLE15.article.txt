# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Being here and now 
### 
The word "Kairos," some
say, can be defined as
"Radical occasionality
and reinvention of the
present moment."
Once upon a time, Professor
Richard Alpert dropped out of a
highly lucrative career at Harvard
University (I believed he owned a
BMW, apartment in Cambridge
and his own plane) to pursue,
ahem, alternative ways of living on
this blue sphere. He preached that
he had spent far too much time liv
ing for the future and far too little
time "being here now."
His point was that sadly, we're
lost and can't always find meaning
in our lives.
We all live, to some extent, in
anticipation of what is to come. To
differing degrees, we modify our
actions based on an inherent belief
of what the future holds in store
for us. On a small scale, this can be
as simple as skipping drinks with
the boys to study fora midterm.
But what I'd like to unravel is
something more weighty in nature
— something I believe that charac
terizes the United States (and
much of Western culture) to a far
greater degree than we're com
fortable talking about.
Put simply, too many of us are
not being honest with ourselves.
Listen fora second and stop think
ing about what you need to do in
the next 10 minutes. Breathe.
Too many Americans, on aver
age, overwork, overeat, binge
drink and, in general, just do too
much to compensate fora lack of
balance in their lives.
The result is a fantastically large
assortment of negative general
trends — too much stress, an atro
ciously high divorce rate, teen
shootings — and individual prob
lems. Some eat too much, some eat
too little, some are sex addicts, oth
ers want to get beaten in bed. Like
the saying goes, "The most normal
person you know is the one you

know the least." So we yoga,
smoke, drink, purify, drive our
selves mad with homemade reme
dies or plain old escapes.
Well I'll say. I reckon there's
gotta be some fixin' to this prob
lem. Some mythical magical bub
bly green cureall that'll make ev
eryone smile again.
If you ask me, I think it's a fine
time for the cycle of history to kick

back in reverse,
say some 40 years
or so. Granted,
we've come a long
way since the '60s
in many ways. I
love my cell
phone and the
fact that I can
reach anyone

anywhere anytime through a piece
of plastic and a calling plan. But
dammit, that isn't an excuse for
how truly wonderful it must have
been to have walked around San
Francisco with a tie-dye shirt and
the feeling of "being here now."
In case you didn't know, this
way of living existed at Stanford
in the '60s (read Tom Wolfe's
"The Electric Kool Aid Acid
Test"). In what is now the Stan
ford Shopping Center, a beauti
ful community of intellectuals
lived humbly in a complex called
Perry Lane. As a Stegner Fellow
here, Ken Kesey published the
critically acclaimed book,"One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." In
real life, his charisma and charm
(as well as an adequate supply of
LSD) caused him to radiate with
energy. Over the next several
years, the Bay Area is where peo
ple like Professor Alpert, Allen
Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, Timo
thy Leary, the Grateful Dead,
Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouack,
Kesey, Tom Wolfe and Hunter S.
Thomson, at one point in time or
another, all met and exchanged
ideas.
Like it or not — and many

didn't — fora period of time,
Kesey and his followers in the Bay
Area were conducting one of the
greatest experiments of all time.
They were simply "living here
now," like Alpert said. On and
around campus, they were living
the Kairos-type lives that many
philosophers and intellectuals
could only have dreamed about.
Many contend that it was simply
the acid that did it. Though I'm
not planning on verifying this my
self, it seems to me that this argu
ment is a cheap way out.
With or without mind-altering
chemicals, I believe Kesey found
and directed what all of us have in
side of us — the desire to live in
the "here and now."
To drastically generalize, it's
that we're always waiting for
spring break and when it finally
comes, it's never long enough.
I've heard one too many 50-
year-olds making hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year com
plain to me that they wish they had
more time for themselves. They
wish they could have a longer va
cation. They wish they weren't in
cessantly on call or traveling away
from their families.
And there is no perfect solution
for them, except for letting them
— and myself— know that we just
need to listen to ourselves. We jok
ingly complain that Europeans are
lazy or that people in Spain could
never be trusted for business be
cause they take two hours off in the
afternoon.
Could it be that they're just
smiling back at us and laughing?
Although we've established .Amer
ica as the financial and political
powerhouse of the world — the
new Rome, the world's unilateral
bulwark, a shining beacon on a hill
— we've lost something very pre
cious along the way: ourselves.
Without drugs or fantasy, there

needs to be a shift back to the here
and now that must somehow re
flect the knowledge our parents'
generation learned in the '60s.
Many of us are graduating soon.
Too many people I know are
discontent with their academic or
professional lives. One too many a
classmate has passed away, leav
ing the rest of us to reflect on our
own lives.
I hope that each one of us can
find his or her own Kairos and in
creasingly "live here now," be
cause spring break is over and it
didn't seem long enough. Let's
see some tie-dye.

FYI, I'm working on a column about
ethnic theme houses. Got an opinion ?
