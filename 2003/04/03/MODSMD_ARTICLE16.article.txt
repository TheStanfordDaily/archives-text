# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Campus conservatives should speak up and write in 
### LILLIAN HO GUEST COLUMNIST 
I'm sitting at a table with your typical
cadre of well-meaning, but not-too-bright
Stanford students. The topic at hand is
race, but it could just as easily be the conflict
in the Middle East, or whether we should
raise the minimum wage or any other po
tentially divisive issue. Nobody knows each
other very well, and nobody really wants to
get into it and risk hurting someone's feel
ings, so we're dancing around the issue in
the lightest of ways. Sooner or later, some
one says, "Well, the important thing is to
have dialogue."
Allow me to rant fora second here. "Dia
logue," along with "paradigm shift" and
"state-sponsored terrorism," is one of the
most rhetorically useless phrases of the 21st
century. Rampant misuse of the word has
rendered it meaningless. Most of the time,
when people call for more "dialogue" or "op
posing viewpoints" in mass publications like
The Daily, what they mean is that they want to
hear more of their own personal viewpoints.

Which is understandable. The Daily
does has a liberal bias. Conservative view
points are indeed underrepresented in its
editorial pages. But to use this as the basis
for criticizing the journalistic integrity of
The Daily is a bit simplistic. All forms of the
mass media are biased. What's more is that
they have every right to be if they a) own up
to it and b) don't let it spill out of the edito
rial section. If you don't want to hear a con
servative viewpoint, you don't pick up a
copy of National Review. If you can't bear to
listen to a liberal viewpoint, you don't log on
to indymedia.org.
Let's assume that the recent letters to the
editor (March 31 and April 1) reproaching
The Daily for its liberal bias refer to its opin
ions section, not the news articles. The ques
tion at hand is whether The Daily, having
owned up to its bias, has a responsibility to
seek out conservative viewpoints and pub
lish them.
Now if the paper were privately owned,
I argue that they do not have any such re
sponsibility, because the management must
make its own business decisions in shaping

and serving its readership. But The Stan
ford Daily bears the name of the university
that most of its readers attend, and one
could argue that it has a specific responsi
bility to represent the student body.
Here's the tricky part. Obviously, The
Daily cannot conduct polls of its entire read
ership before running each and every opin
ion piece. Media cannot be democratic in
the sense that everyone participates. Publi
cations like The Daily, the Stanford Review
and The Stanford Progressive depend on a
self-selected group of writers who aspire to
represent the views of the readership, be
they staff writers or community members
at-large on the editorial board or people
writing letters to the editor.
The body of discourse produced by The
Daily is thus constrained by the views and
talents of its writers. And it's hard — very,
very hard — to write an editorial support
ing something you don't yourself believe
and know that it will be published under
your name. Thus, to have opposing view
points represented in The Daily, it must
have staff writers who possess opposing

viewpoints.
Here's the really tricky part. The writers
at The Daily are self-selecting. (Yes, there is
an application process, but let's give The
Daily the benefit of the doubt and say that
I hey choose the staff on the basis of talent,
not political views.) IfThe Daily has a liberal
bias, it is because those who submit work to
I he Daily tend to be liberals. To have a po
litically balanced Daily, what we need is
more conservative writers. The special issue
ofThe Stanford Daily on the war (March 21)
was egregiously lacking in pro-war pieces.
I his is the real problem: the conserva
tive voice on campus is underdeveloped be
cause there's a dearth of talented conserva
tive writers. And even if they do exist,
they're not stepping up to publish. And
frankly, the ones that are publishing are
making a complete hash of it.
As a professed liberal, I am profoundly
disappointed that the opposition doesn't
have its act together. Every two weeks I
