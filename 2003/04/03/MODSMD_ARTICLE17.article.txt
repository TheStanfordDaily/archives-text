## No. 4 Card falls to USF 
### DANIEL URBAN STAFF WRITER 
With its performances over the last two
weeks, the Stanford baseball team had been
beginning to make its early-season woes
seem like ancient history.
Series wins over then-No. 3 Arizona State
and Washington started making people be
lieve the early-season swoon was just a blip
on the radar.

Baseball

But then the lowly University of San
Francisco came to Sunken Diamond and
put a temporary damper on all that success.
The No. 4 Cardinal (18-10) fell to the
Dons 9-5 on a chilly Monday evening in a
game that pushed the four-hour mark.
In all fairness, such midweek contests out
of conference really don't count for all that
much. They're used mostly to get pitchers
innings who don't get many on the week
ends and to keep everyone's baseball skills
sharp.
All the same, a loss to the Dons — who en
tered the contest with a mediocre 12-19
record — can't be a good sign.
It was not the first time the Cardinal has
been upset by USF. Two years ago, the
Dons pulled off a 5-4 win at Sunken Dia
mond. Such surprises have been few and
far-between in the all-time series between
the two Bay Area schools, however.
Stanford still owns the all-time series
record, 47-7.
While only one of the Dons had a multi
hit game, their hits came at opportune mo
ments — apparent in the fact that they had
more runs (nine) than hits (eight).
Senior Tim Cunningham pitched for the
first time in nearly two months — he had sat

out action since breaking a finger Feb. 15
against Fresno State — and bis rust showed.
The usually crafty lefthander lasted only
two and two-thirds of an inning, allowing
three earned runs on two hits.
But the most alarming stat?
He walked four batters.
When Cunningham was eventually re
placed in the third inning by sophomore
Billy Paganetti, there were runners on first
and second.
Paganetti didn't exactly provide immedi
ate relief, though.
First, he balked, moving both runners
into scoring position. Then he gave up a
two-run double to Dons slugging first base
man Nick Cirbo. And then he hit San Fran
cisco second baseman Royce Fukoroku with
a pitch.
Eventually, Paganetti settled down. He
struck out the next two hitters to avoid fur
ther trouble and end the inning,
And he breezed through the fourth and
fifth innings before running into some
more trouble.
Paganetti handed the ball to junior
David O'Hagan, who gave up two hits and
two earned runs in one and two-thirds in
nings before freshman Jeff Gilmore took
the mound.
Gilmore's stint on the hill was short-lived,
as he recorded just one out before junior
Di ew Ehrlich came in to finish the game.
Ehrlich faced five batters in one and two
thirds innings without giving up a single hit.
However, the damage had already been
done.
The Cardinal offense came out strong in
the first inning, with a single from junior
Sam Fuld followed by back-to-back doubles
by junior Carlos Quentin and senior Ryan
Garko that brought in two runs.

Freshman shortstop Chris Lewis throws the ball to first during Stanford's 9-
5 loss to San Francisco. The Cardinal's non-conference loss to the Dons was
its second such loss in three years to its rival from across the Bay.
However, this was the only hit
explosion that the Cardinal of
fense was able to get set off, as each
of the next eight innings never saw
more than one Stanford run.
Fuld, Quentin and Garko con
tinued to lead the Cardinal of
fense after the first inning.
Fuld, who finished March with
an 11-game hitting streak and a
.509 batting average, continued
his tear with two hits in last night's
game. It was the ninth game in the
last 12 in which Fuld has had a
multiple-hit game.
Quentin also had two hits to
bring him to 200 career hits and
extend his hitting streak to 16
games.
Garko's bat was even more pro
ductive, hammering out three hits
and three RBIs.
A single from Fuld and a double
from Garko which moved Fuld to
third with one out in the bottom of
the ninth had the makings of a Car
dinal rally, but sophomore Donny
Lucy struck out and freshman
John Mayberry popped out, leav
ing the Cardinal upset by the Dons
for the second time in three years.
Stanford will resume Pac-10
play this weekend as it travels to
Washington State.

fense after the first inning.
Fuld, who finished March with
an 11-game hitting streak and a
.509 batting average, continued
his tear with two hits in last night's
game. It was the ninth game in the
last 12 in which Fuld has had a
multiple-hit game.
Quentin also had two hits to
bring him to 200 career hits and
extend his hitting streak to 16
games.
Garko's bat was even more pro
ductive, hammering out three hits
and three RBIs.
A single from Fuld and a double
from Garko which moved Fuld to
third with one out in the bottom of
the ninth had the makings of a Car
dinal rally, but sophomore Donny
Lucy struck out and freshman
John Mayberry popped out, leav
ing the Cardinal upset by the Dons
for the second time in three years.
Stanford will resume Pac-10
play this weekend as it travels to
Washington State.
