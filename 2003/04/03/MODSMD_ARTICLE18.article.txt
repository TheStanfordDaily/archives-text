LOS ANGELES — Let's get ready to tumble.
In a sport where the goal is to peak on the last day
of the year, the No. 6 Stanford women's gymnastics
team is right where it wants to be as the all-important
postseason begins.
Last Saturday, the Cardinal took second in the
2003 Pacific-10 Conference Championships with a
197.700 — its third-highest team score ever. No. 1
UCLA won its fourth Pac-10 title in five years, ousting
Stanford by a mere 0.475 points.
"We want to build off of our performance at Pac
10s as the postseason continues. The exciting thing is
that we can still improve," coach Kristen Smyth said.
"I'm very happy with where we are in terms of skill se
lection. Now we have to take things up one extra
notch."
Besides the Bruins, Stanford and Oregon State are
the only teams to have ever earned the conference title
— and the only two squads that bested UCLA this sea
son in conference dual meets.
The stage was set fora gripping showdown be
tween these three rosters, but OSU counted a fall dur
ing a hesitant set on beam, and eventually found itself
at fifth out of the field of seven teams.
The Cardinal threat began on vault, where Stan
ford's lineup boasted six vaults with 10.0 start values.
Pacing Stanford's effort on the table was freshman
Glyn Sweets, whose 9.925 tied for third on the appa
ratus.
Although UCLA took the top two scores on the
event, with Jeanette Antolin's perfect 10 garnering

first place, the Bruin team score on vault was only one
tenth higher than Stanford's.
On the uneven bars, freshman Natalie Foley and
junior Caroline Fluhrer each notched 9.925 for the
Cardinal, to tie for fifth. Although Stanford's lineup
executed consistently on the event, UCLA drilled its

landings to score a 49.575 on bars,
giving them a slight edge over the
Cardinal's 49.350.
"Bars was a little rough for us,"
Smyth said. "But hitting five rou
tines after the first person in our
lineup went down was a huge step
for this team mentally. I was very
pleased to see them bounce back
like that."
Stanford found itself within 0.25
of the Bruins as it mounted the bal
ance beam. Senior Kelsey Stillinger

scored a 9.725 to begin the set as
the Cardinal came storming out of
the gate. The rotation ended with
juniors Lise Leveille and Lindsay
Wing packing their usual one-two
punch, chalking up a 9.95 and
9.975, respectively.
"Our beam team put together
the best effort I have seen on that
event," Smyth said. "Kelsey
stepped in to start things off for us,
and the team's poise, presentation
and aggressive approach were just
what we needed."
Stanford showcased its consis
tency and depth on the event,
claiming the top team score of the
evening with a 49.500 to UCLA's

-49.475.
The Cardinal closed the night
out with a stellar set on the floor ex
ercise, which has been a bit of a
struggle in 2003.
"For us to step up on floor was
so encouraging. That was a huge
step in the right direction," Smyth
said.
Freshman Jessica Louie set the
tone at the top of the lineup with a
9.875 as Stanford gave its all on
floor, scoring a season-high 49.550.
Leveille and Foley recorded ca
reer-high marks of 9.975 and 9.95
respectively. But UCLA's stuck
landings, especially on bars and
vault, made it too difficult for the

Cardinal to surpass a Bruin squad
determined to win in Pauley Pavil
ion before 3,070 fans.
"These meets come down to
stuck routines and hit landings,"
Smyth said. "Landings would have
made the difference, but now we
know what we need to do at re
gional and that we can compete
very well against the best teams in
the country."
In addition to Sweets' third
place showing on vault, Leveille
made many appearances on the
winner's podium, taking second on
balance beam, tying for third on
floor and securing third in the all
around. Wing's 9.975 on beam

won the event title, her third Pac
-10 title on the event in as many
years.
Stanford now looks toward the
North Central Regional meet on
April 12, when it will head to Utah
to take on five ranked squads fora
bid to nationals. The Cardinal must
finish in the top two for the chance
to build on last year's first-ever
Super Six appearance.
Sophomore Mandy Delgado
added, "We made a huge step at
Pac-lOs. The team brought the
competitive attitude and focus we
had been working on in practice all
week. It's a great way to start our
postseason stretch."
