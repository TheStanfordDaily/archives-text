# Softball splits doubleheader
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Softball team was in a position for
a major letdown before yesterday's doubleheader
at Sacramento State.

Softball
Tuesday: No. 13 Stanford 5, Sacramento State 1
Sacramento State 6, Stanford 5

After all, the No. 13 Cardinal was just coming
off its biggest win of the season — a 4-0 upset (a
no-hitter) over No. 2 Washington at home. Plus,
Stanford has dominated the series with the Hor
nets recently, winning each of the last seven
games.
But the No. 13 Cardinal (26-11) turned in a
solid performance, splitting the twin-bill with a 5-
1 victory in the opener, and falling 6-5 in seven in
nings in the nightcap.
"We are disappointed with this doubleheader
because we know we are a better team," senior left
fielder Cassi Brangham said. "We need to learn
from it because we are going into a tough Pac-10
weekend.
"But we are fine and staying positive, we know
we can do better than we did today."
In the afternoon game, junior pitcher Dana
Sorensen was the story.
Sorensen, who pitched the no-hitter against the
Huskies, turned in another brilliant performance
to lift the Cardinal over Sacra
mento State (20-14).
The junior pitcher (12-4) low
ered her ERA to a miniscule O HO

ERA and pushed her strikeout
total to 178 in 105.2 innings of
work.
The Stanford offense was also
clicking in the first game. It
pounded out 1 1 hits and
roughed up Sacramento State
pitcher Brianne Ferguson, most
ly in part to two-thirds of its start

ing outfield.
Freshman center fielder
Catalina Morris and Brangham
combined for five hits, two runs
and two RBIs.
The nightcap had a whole lot
more drama.
Stanford headed to the sixth
inning ahead 2-0 behind a two
run homer off the bat of junior
catcher Jessica Allister.
Sacramento State, however,
put together a furious rally in the
sixth frame on the backs of a few
freshmen.
Hornets freshmen Brittany
Crine and Whitnie Darvell led off
the inning with back-to-back sin
gles before fellow freshman
Lindy Winkler plated both of
them with a two-run triple.
Junior Amy Walter put Sacra
mento State ahead with an RBI
single.
By the top of the seventh,
Stanford trailed 6-4.
Freshman shortstop Lauren
Lappin brought the Cardinal
within one run with a rocket over
the fence.
And after Brangham doubled,
Stanford was in business to tie the
game.
But in the end, it couldn't pro
duce and left a runner in scoring
position to end the game.
Stanford's loss was its first to
the Hornets since 1999.
The Cardinal out-hit Sacra
mento State 10-9 and had a run
ner reach base every inning.
The midweek competition
served as a break for the Cardinal
from the tough Pacific-10 Con
ference competition. Stanford
started the league season 1-2, but
those games were against the No.
1 (UCLA) and No. 2 (Washing
ton) teams in the nation.
Stanford hopes to improve
upon the conference record as
both Oregon and Oregon State
come to the Farm this weekend
for three key Pac-10 contests.
