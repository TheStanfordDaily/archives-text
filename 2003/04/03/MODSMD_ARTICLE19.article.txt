Tuesday: No. 13 Stanford 5, Sacramento State 1
Sacramento State 6, Stanford 5

After all, the No. 13 Cardinal was just coming
off its biggest win of the season â€” a 4-0 upset (a
no-hitter) over No. 2 Washington at home. Plus,

1 victory in the opener, and falling 6-5 in seven in
nings in the nightcap.

because we know we are a better team," senior left
fielder Cassi Brangham said. "We need to learn
from it because we are going into a tough Pac-10
