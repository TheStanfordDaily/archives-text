# Avalanche now rounding into top form

### 
This will not be a column about ihe NCAA
Final Four, since my bracket pretty much im
ploded over the first weekend of Spring
Break. (Yes, I know that weekend was only
the second round).
And it will not be a column about that beautiful re
birth of the baseball season and the rites of spring, as
the Red Sox blowing a lead against the Devil Rays (ar
guably the worst franchise in the history of profession
al sports) on Opening Day still leaves a sour taste in my
mouth.
No, it will instead be a column about the Colorado
Avalanche and what they have taught all of us about
procrastination.
You see, my hometown Avalanche came into this
season attempting to make history in the NHL by win
ning their ninth consecutive division title. That's some
thing that's never been done before — not by the pow
erhouse Canadians of years ago, not by Cretzky's slick
Oilers of the 1980s, not by Brodeur and the dominant
Devils of the late 19905. Never.
Fittingly, the team's motto for the year was "Chasing
History."
Too bad they spent the first month of the season
chasing their first home win, instead. The season began
on Oct. 9. The Avs didn't record a home win until Nov.

12, a span of nine home games. The
natives, by this point, were getting
restless.
And it's not like things on the
road were much better. Through
the first 20 games of the season the
team found itself 6-5, 6-3. (That's
wins-losses-ties-overtime losses, for
those of you who don't really follow
hockey scores. And that's not good).

More importantly, the team was languishing in
fourth place in the division, looking up at Calgary,
Vancouver and Minnesota (Minnesota?).
Some things changed. Bob Hartley was unfortu
nately let go as coach. The lines were shook up, ice
time changed, power play configurations juggled
around. And what do you know, the team turned
around and has won 26 of their last 32 games — vault
ing them to second place in the division, a mere two
points behind the Canucks with three to play and a
game in hand.
See where I'm going with this yet?
The idea is this — I think I see in this year's
Avalanche a fantastic example of how we Stanford stu
dents (at times) procrastinate. You see, they came into
the season, perhaps a little lacksidasical. They shopped
around for some new players, they took their time "get
ting their books" and getting back to the grind. Rut be
fore long "the reading" piled up and they found them
selves at the bottom of a big pile of work, looking up.
So now with three games left in the season we're wit
nessing this sort of crazy final surge to the finish line.
Right as the team should be resting injured players and
preparing for their playoff opponent, it is instead
hurtling at breakneck speed on a trip to face the Kings
in SoCal with the hope of getting two more points and
pulling even with the Canucks.
Bears a slight resemblance to the hectic nature of
Dead Week, don't you think? Only with more stitches
and fights and fewer of those inane midnight screams.
So it's a race against time, now. Sure, the Avs are a
better team than the Canucks. I'll take Roy over Clouti
er, even now that Cloutier's knee is healed. And I'd take
the Forsberg-Hejduk-Tanguay line over Naslund-
Bertuzzi-Santa Claus.
Alas, when you take your time getting started, you
definitely make tilings harder on yourself— as both a
student and a blue liner with a crooked nose could tell
you.
Thankfully, we all get a new chance to get on top of
things with a rebirth in the spring. So here's to (in my
