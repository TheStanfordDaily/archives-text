# Track confident for outdoor season
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Coming off their success at the In
door National Championships, the
Stanford track and field teams are look
ing to improve upon their national
standings and contend for outdoor na
tional titles in June.
"More than anything, this indoor sea
son has provided the team with a huge
boost going into the outdoor season,"ju
nior Grant Robison said. "We have
more people hitting NOVA provisional
and automatic marks in a wider variety
of events.
"That is what is going to make fora
strong team in June and give us another
shot at defending our Pacific-10 Confer
ence title."
This season marks a shift in the qual
ifying process for the NCAA Champi
onships. Unlike setting automatic and
provisional standards to select the fields
as before, most events will be contested
at the regional qualifying meets.
The country has been divided into

four regions. Each region gets five auto
matic bids for individual events and
three for relays. There will also be ap
proximately six at-large bids per event
for the entire nation â€” depending on
the overlap of athletes between events.
In short, the NCAA has enlarged its cap
on the number of athletes that can par
ticipate in the Outdoor Championships.
Only the 10,000 meter, women's
heptathlon and men's decathlon will re
main under the old qualifying process.
"Under the new regional system, we
may be able to qualify a few more ath
letes to nationals," said Vin Lananna. di
rector of Stanford's track and field pro
gram. "One of our goals has been to get
both 1,600 relay teams to nationals each
year. With the new system, I think it may
be possible."
Both squads made g<x)d strides early
in the outdoor season.
Currently, the Cardinal women lead
the regional performance list in five
events and have already broken two
school records.
At the Stanford Open on March 9, se

nior Kathleen Donoghue and junior
Leila Ben-Youssef both cleared 12-
11.75 in the pole vault and are tied for
first in the West Region.
At the Cal Open on March 22, junior
Lindsey Johnson moved into the No. 2
position in Stanford's record books for
the 400-meter hurdles with her 59.86
second run, which leads the regional list.
And last weekend at the Stanford In
vitational, Johnson also broke the 100-
meter hurdle record with a 13.61 at the
Stanford Invitational and ranks second
in the region.
Nashonme Johnson set two Stanford
freshman records with her perfor
mances over t he weekend in the 200 and
400. Her time of 23.84 in the 200 cur
rently ranks her first in the West Region.
She is ranked third in the 400 with a
54.61.
Senior Malindi Elmore currently
leads the region and the nation in the
1,500 with her time of 4 minutes, 17.15
seconds.
