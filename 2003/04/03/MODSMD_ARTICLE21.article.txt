# Track confident for outdoor season
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
Coming off their success at the In
door National Championships, the
Stanford track and field teams are look
ing to improve upon their national
standings and contend for outdoor na
tional titles in June.
"More than anything, this indoor sea
son has provided the team with a huge
boost going into the outdoor season,"ju
nior Grant Robison said. "We have
more people hitting NOVA provisional
and automatic marks in a wider variety
of events.
"That is what is going to make fora
strong team in June and give us another
shot at defending our Pacific-10 Confer
ence title."
This season marks a shift in the qual
ifying process for the NCAA Champi
onships. Unlike setting automatic and
provisional standards to select the fields
as before, most events will be contested
at the regional qualifying meets.
The country has been divided into

four regions. Each region gets five auto
matic bids for individual events and
three for relays. There will also be ap
proximately six at-large bids per event
for the entire nation — depending on
the overlap of athletes between events.
In short, the NCAA has enlarged its cap
on the number of athletes that can par
ticipate in the Outdoor Championships.
Only the 10,000 meter, women's
heptathlon and men's decathlon will re
main under the old qualifying process.
"Under the new regional system, we
may be able to qualify a few more ath
letes to nationals," said Vin Lananna. di
rector of Stanford's track and field pro
gram. "One of our goals has been to get
both 1,600 relay teams to nationals each
year. With the new system, I think it may
be possible."
Both squads made g<x)d strides early
in the outdoor season.
Currently, the Cardinal women lead
the regional performance list in five
events and have already broken two
school records.
At the Stanford Open on March 9, se

nior Kathleen Donoghue and junior
Leila Ben-Youssef both cleared 12-
11.75 in the pole vault and are tied for
first in the West Region.
At the Cal Open on March 22, junior
Lindsey Johnson moved into the No. 2
position in Stanford's record books for
the 400-meter hurdles with her 59.86
second run, which leads the regional list.
And last weekend at the Stanford In
vitational, Johnson also broke the 100-
meter hurdle record with a 13.61 at the
Stanford Invitational and ranks second
in the region.
Nashonme Johnson set two Stanford
freshman records with her perfor
mances over t he weekend in the 200 and
400. Her time of 23.84 in the 200 cur
rently ranks her first in the West Region.
She is ranked third in the 400 with a
54.61.
Senior Malindi Elmore currently
leads the region and the nation in the
1,500 with her time of 4 minutes, 17.15
seconds.

and automatic marks in a wider variety
of events.
"That is what is going to make fora
strong team in June and give us another
shot at defending our Pacific-10 Confer
ence title."
This season marks a shift in the qual
ifying process for the NCAA Champi
onships. Unlike setting automatic and
provisional standards to select the fields
as before, most events will be contested
at the regional qualifying meets.
The country has been divided into

four regions. Each region gets five auto
matic bids for individual events and
three for relays. There will also be ap
proximately six at-large bids per event
for the entire nation — depending on
the overlap of athletes between events.
In short, the NCAA has enlarged its cap
on the number of athletes that can par
ticipate in the Outdoor Championships.
Only the 10,000 meter, women's
heptathlon and men's decathlon will re
main under the old qualifying process.
"Under the new regional system, we
may be able to qualify a few more ath
letes to nationals," said Vin Lananna. di
rector of Stanford's track and field pro
gram. "One of our goals has been to get
both 1,600 relay teams to nationals each
year. With the new system, I think it may
be possible."
Both squads made g<x)d strides early
in the outdoor season.
Currently, the Cardinal women lead
the regional performance list in five
events and have already broken two
school records.
At the Stanford Open on March 9, se

nior Kathleen Donoghue and junior
Leila Ben-Youssef both cleared 12-
11.75 in the pole vault and are tied for
first in the West Region.
At the Cal Open on March 22, junior
Lindsey Johnson moved into the No. 2
position in Stanford's record books for
the 400-meter hurdles with her 59.86
second run, which leads the regional list.
And last weekend at the Stanford In
vitational, Johnson also broke the 100-
meter hurdle record with a 13.61 at the
Stanford Invitational and ranks second
in the region.
Nashonme Johnson set two Stanford
freshman records with her perfor
mances over t he weekend in the 200 and
400. Her time of 23.84 in the 200 cur
rently ranks her first in the West Region.
She is ranked third in the 400 with a
54.61.
Senior Malindi Elmore currently
leads the region and the nation in the
1,500 with her time of 4 minutes, 17.15
seconds.

starting to heat up as many of Stanford's track stars will make their spring debuts in the coming weeks.
The women's 1,600-meter relay
team set a school record ai the Stan
ford Invitational and leads the re
gion with an impressive 3:39.97.
For the men, Grant Robison
lead the charge with his second
place showing in the 1,500, post
ing the fastest time in the region
and nation so far at 3:43.07. The
400-meter and 1600-meter relay
teams are both ranked second in
the region after their second

place showings at the Stanford
Invitational.
Junior Steve Loughlin is also
ranked second in the region with
his 14:08.13 in the 5,000 over the
weekend.
One of the highlights of the
meet was Stanford's corps of
10,000-meter runners. Sopho
more lan Dobson finished fourth
in 28:39.55 and led junior Louis
Luchini (fifth, 28:41.13) and se
nior Adam Tenforde (eighth,
28:43.18) under the auto stan
dard to guarantee spots at nation
als in June.
Senior Nick Welihozkiy compet-

Ed unattached this weekend in a
strange move by the coaches as his
toss in the hammer throw would
have earned him a No. 4 ranking in
the nation at 212-9.00.
In total, the Cardinal has already
posted 11 West Regional qualify ing
marks on the men's side and 22 for
the women.
But before the Cardinal can con
tend for the national title, it is fo
cused on winning the Pac-10
Championships.
To do that in the competitive
conference, Stanford has to get the
entire squad together. To keep
them fresh for later in the outdoor

season, several of Stanford's top
athletes, such as defending 1,500-
meter champion junior Don Sage
and two-time defending 5,000
champion senior Lauren Flesh
man, have yet to make their season
debuts.
The women are expected to re
gain distance star Sara Bei, a sopho
more, after she underwent knee
surgery over the winter. Junior An
drew Powell is said to be healthy
after two years of off-and-on injury,
and redshirt freshman Ryan Hall is
back at Stanford after taking a quar
ter off.
All three of these distance run

ners may be able to contribute sig
nificantly to the Cardinal's confer

Invitational in Los Angeles.

Coming off their success at the In
door National Championships, the
Stanford track and field teams are look
ing to improve upon their national
standings and contend for outdoor na
tional titles in June.
"More than anything, this indoor sea
son has provided the team with a huge
boost going into the outdoor season,"ju
nior Grant Robison said. "We have
more people hitting NOVA provisional
