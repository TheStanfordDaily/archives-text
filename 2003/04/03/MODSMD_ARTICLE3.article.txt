# ASSU opens campaigning
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
There was a good deal of rushing, yelling
and, most of all, posting of fliers around
White Plaza at 12:01 a.m. yesterday morn
ing as campaigning for ASSU elections offi
cially began. Special fee groups, class presi
dential slates, senate candidates and ASSU
presidential slates were out in force, many
with teams of volunteers, all competing to
paper the best spots.
The frenzy of activity began around White
Plaza and at many of the surrounding kiosks.
Candidates and their volunteers raced to find
space to post their ads.
"[Fliering] was highly competitive be
cause election rules stipulate that there's
only a certain number of places that are al
lowed for fliering, and in terms of feasibility,
you have a high number of people running
in a limited number of spots," said freshman
Stacy Pepper, a member of the Euphoria
slate for sophomore class president.
Freshman Matt Stolzar, who was cam
paigning for Mock Trial special fees, de
scribed the sight.
"It's the craziest flier-fest I've ever seen,"
Stolzar said.
Even though the campaign began at 12:01
a.m., many of those who were posting arrived
earlier to make sure they were ready.
"We've been out here since 10 p.m. se-
curing spaces," said Brooke
Fineberg, campaign manager for
the Fast Forward slate for senior
class president. "I think it's really
fun how excited people get. It's
really good, friendly, healthy
competition."
Although campaigning runs for
one full week, the spaces that could
be used for materials were limited
by campaign guidelines of the
ASSU Elections Commission.
Specifically, nothing could be at
tached to the ground or pavement,
chalk drawings were not allowed
and the outsides of University
buildings were off-limits. Addi
tionally, only one flier was allowed
per resident advisor per dorm for
each candidate.
"I fliered for 45 minutes, start
ing at midnight," said freshman
Jonson Yee, working for Stanford
Archery. "We hit up every single
hall because we really needed sup
port. Everywhere we went people
were posting. It was a fight to get
board space."
Many of the candidates had
been preparing for the campaign

for weeks. Both Pepper and
Eineberg noted that they had
begun preparing before spring
break.
The campaign for ASSU Execu
tive Office had a number of sup
porters out. Inebriated members
of the Stanford Chaparral roamed
White Plaza armed with a bullhorn
to promote candidates Steve Yel
derman and Charlie Stockman,
both juniors. The bullhorn could
be heard across the plaza, emanat
ing phrases such as "Grape soda in
the cafetorium," and later, "No
longer will the cafeteria have to
share with the auditorium! Down
with the cafetorium!"
At one point someone who
appeared to be associated with
the wielder of the bullhorn was
holding a burning flier. He ex
plained that he had found the
flier burning.
"Somebody apparently doesn't
think love is serious," he said when
asked why the flier was burning.
The opposing slate of junior
Nadiya Eigueroa and sophomore
Joey Natoli had approximately 20
people at White Plaza and 90
across campus. Natoli experienced
campaigning last year for Seriate,
but for Figueroa it is the first time
running.

All the fliers were removed
early yesterday morning by Uni
versity custodians in a turn ol
events ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Eleanor Williams, a junior,
called a "tragedy" in an e-mail to
candidates and special lees
groups. However, some candi
dates say that flier removal hap
pens every year and is an expected
part of the campaigning process.
Most students have already re
posted their lliers.
Eor the ASSU Executive Office,
there are two slates, the slate of
Figueroa and Natoli and that of
Yelderman and Stockman.
Thirty-eight students were ini
tially registered to run for the 15
spots on the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate, but some have withdrawn
from the campaign, leaving just
over 30 candidates.
There are four slates for senior
class president, two for junior class
president and seven for sopho
more class president.
Nearly 70 campus organiza
tions have applied for special fees
this year, up from 52 last year.
Twelve of the special fees will be
voted on by both undergraduate
and graduate students, while the
majority will be voted on only by
undergraduates.
