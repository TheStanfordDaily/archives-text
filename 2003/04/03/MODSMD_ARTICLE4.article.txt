# ASB sends students to serve over break
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year's Alternative Spring
Break program transported 143
Stanford students to locations like
Hawaii, New York City, San Fran
cisco and North Dakota to partici
pate in direct public service and crit
ically examine and experience fun
damental issues such as homeless
ness, education, sexuality and
forestry issues with the guidance of
policymakers.
There was a dramatic increase in
applicants for the 2002-03 ASB,
with 389 applicants for this year's
program versus only 200 last year.
The 16-year-old program, which
this year ran from March 23 to 30, is
a completely student-run program
open to all undergraduates and
graduate students. The program's
marketing describes it as "The week
that lasts a lifetime."
There were 13 trips planned for
this year and there are hopes to ex
pand to 15 trips next year.
"ASB turned out to be — in the
home stay portion — a unique in
sight into the lives and concerns of
the farmers and ranchers that make
up rural North Dakota," said senior
YVilliam Beecher, one of the trip
leaders.
During winter quarter, trip par
ticipants enrolled in specialized di
rected reading courses facilitated by
trip leaders and faculty advisors.
"As an engineering student, the
ASB program exposed me to an en
tirely different realm than that
which I was used to," said first-time
ASB attendee junior Patrick Wong
about the HIV/'AIDS in San Fran
cisco trip. "The program was a
seamless fusion of policy and ser
vice. By immersing myself in the
issue and interacting with people
from various walks of life, I was able
to gain a greater understanding of
the social, economic and political
dynamics that surround

HIV/AIDS," he said.
The week itself offered Stanford
students the chance to go beyond
the walls of the institution to explore
and learn about societal issues
through a range of hands-on service
experiences.
Junior Jordan Lee, a co-leader of
the"The Real World Hawaii: Ex
ploring the 'Real' Issues of Native
Hawaiians and Hawaii" trip, was
hopeful that "through their learn
ing and real-life experiences, these
students will later disseminate their
knowledge and emotions to others.
"It is through learning and ser
vice that we deepen our under
standing of many things about oth
ers and about ourselves," he contin
ued. "We spent spring break in
Hawaii, but in a non-traditional
way. Aloha no."
Students have said they have
greatly benefited from participation
in ASB and many times they have
continued dedication to their cause
even after the trip.
For example, 1991 participants
came back from the Bay Area
Homelessness trip and formed the
Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition, a homelessness advocacy
group working out of the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service.
Participants from the homeless
ness-oriented 2000 trip created
Street Forum, a quarterly newspa
per about the issues of the homeless
in Palo Alto.
Two-time ASB participant Patri
cia Soung, Class of 2001, a trip
leader and an ASB program coordi
nator, characterized the program as
a "reflective and informative experi
ence."
She specifically remembered a
student who came into the program
with certain stereotypes, but
through his experience, "became
more compassionate and open
minded," she said.
