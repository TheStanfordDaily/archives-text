### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, the Stan
ford Community Law Clinic cele
brated the opening of its new loca
tion in East Palo Alto with an open
house. Speakers at the event in
cluded Stanford Law School Dean
Kathleen M. Sullivan, Stanford
Community Law Clinic Director
Peter Reid, East Palo Alto Mayor
Patricia Forester and Menlo Park
Mayor Nicholas Jellins.
The new location opened in Feb
ruary.
According to Reid, the goal of
the clinic is "to provide the highest
quality legal service to the commu
nity." Reid added that the clinic is

"up and running" and will be of
fering pro bono legal advice to res
idents of East Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, Redwood City and the sur
rounding communities.
Until last summer, the need for
this type of legal counseling was
being met by the East Palo Alto
Community I .aw Clinic. That clinic
was forced to close due to budgetary
problems.
In a short speech to celebrate the
opening of the clinic, Sullivan em
phasized that "students get a chance
to help people that really need them
and get a sense of ethical responsi
bility." She added, " The need for
this facility disproves the idea that

there are Kx> many lawyers. There
aren't enough!"'
Jellins commented, "The ser
vices being offered are essential —
everyone needs to know where the
doors of the courthouse are and
how to use them." He continued, "I
think that this facility will t>e kept
busy and expose students to a pop
ulation and needs that will have a
lasting impression on their careers."
His thoughts were seconded by
Forester, who stated, "I am glad the
students have returned and look
forward to having a relationship of
respect and cooperation."
The opening was marked by the
cutting of a purple, blue and white
braided ribbon — purple to repre
sent the legal profession and blue
and white to represent the official
colors of East Palo Alto.
Three local attorneys, Reid,
Peggy Stevenson and Yvonne
Mere, will be supervising the clinic.
Further professional assistance is of
fered by the San Mateo Legal Aid
Society. However, much of the actu
al work is being done by students
from the Stanford School.

Currently the only students
working at the facility are enrolled
in classes which include a "clinic"
component. Volunteering outside
of class may be an option in the fu
ture.
According to Reid, students are
"handling cases from beginning to
end."
The clinic not only provides legal
advice but gives Stanford law stu
dents the opportunity to gain prac
tical skills and see how the legal sys
tem works in real world situations.
In the past, the sort of practical
experience being offered by the
clinic has been limited. Now, a con
certed effort is being made by the
I .aw School to make clinical courses
more available to students. Second
year law student Amanda Major
spends 16 hours a week at the clinic
and two hours in class as part of a
course entitled "Civil Justice (Clinic."
Major describes her semester "as a
learning process and really chal
lenging." She added, "Clinics are
great and you get a lot of experi
ence, and this one gives you a
chance to get contacts in the local
community."
Ryan Speigel, a third-year law
student, said, "Students really get an
opportunity to take on a leading
role, and I'm really grateful that this

facility exists."
Jermiah Frei-Pearson, a friend of
Speigel's and one of the coordina
tors for the clinic during the past
year, recalled a case in which stu
dents had helped get an 8-year-old
child health insurance that was
being withheld from him and his
family.
EPA City Council Member
David Woods was in favor of the
old clinic and is glad that the joint
venture has been kept alive.
Woods was appreciative of the
clinic's very central and visible lo
cation and was not worried about
people being intimidated.
He said, "A big majority of resi
dents of my community can't nor
mally afford legal services, and now
they are being provided for. Some
people are concerned about using
students but the quality of supervi
sion is so high that the benefits out
weigh the inexperience. It is a win
win situation."
The clinic is open weekdays from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and deals with legal
issues related to housing, workers'
rights and government benefits.
Funding for the clinic comes from
the Stanford Law School, the Stan
ford University President's Fund
and a variety of local law firms and
businesses.
