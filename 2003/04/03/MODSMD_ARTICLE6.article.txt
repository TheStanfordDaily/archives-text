# QSSPA hosts meeting on queer / straight awareness
## Students discuss lack of continuity and group coordination 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Queer / Straight Social Political
Alliance hosted a Queer and Allied
Town Hall last night. The event identi
fied students' concerns about the effec

tiveness of the organization and the
needs of the queer and straight-allied
community.
Senior Jesse Evans, co-founder of
QSSPA, described the town hall as an
"accountability and needs assessment
event." It was intended to create an
open conversation between students
and QSSPA to evaluate the group's past
work and to refocus on what students
want the group to do, Evans said.
"We represent a group of people
and we want to check that we're meet

ing that community's needs and that
our priorities are the right ones," Evans
said.
Some of the topics addressed were
the lack of focus of socials, political in
volvement on campus and low visibility.
One important issue voiced was the
lack of unity in the queer and straight-al
lied community. It was generally agreed
that the community was divided into
many disparate groups on campus and
this hindered visibility and effectiveness.
Students felt that QSSPA should try to

increase collaboration with other
groups. In addition, it was voiced that
many of the queer and allied groups
have not been very active this year.
The "forced environment" of socials
was also discussed. Some said that, for
people to be more comfortable, socials
needed more of a focused and planned
aspect beyond hanging out and meet
ing people.
It was also said that OSSPA, be-
cause of the lack of social focus,
should increase the number of
political campaigns. People
agreed that giving a better rea
son to attend events would in
crease involvement.
Another issue discussed was
lack of visibility. Proposed solu
tions included monthly tliering
and having more consistency in
events and advertising. Visibility
with prospective and new stu
dents is a continuing issue QSSPA
is addressing.
QSSPA is a queer-oriented vol
untary student organization that
was founded two years ago. The
group is dedicated to bringing
pride and solidarity to the queer
and queer-allied communities, ac
cording to its Web site.
