# Asian Americans debate use of race
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
While some have claimed that affirmative action
benefits Latinos and blacks but hurts Asian Ameri
cans, Asian-American students at Stanford tend to
argue that affirmative action has helped them. How
ever, many also contend that affirmative action
should focus on other factors, such as socioeconomic
background rather than race, which other minority
groups argue should be one of the primary aims of af
firmative action.
According to a recent Newsweek article, Asian
Americans are considered a less "underrepresented"
minority in higher education than blacks and Latinos,
even though Asian Americans comprise only about 4
percent of the U.S. population—a much smaller
number than blacks or Latinos.
Some think that Asian Americans receive less at
tention than do other minorities in debates over race
related issues because of the greater financial status of
Asian Americans within the United States relative to
other minorities.
"While the Asian-American community has a long
history of powerful struggle against racism and op
pression in this country, the current material success
of East Asian Americans in comparison to other racial
groups is not purely the result of our own efforts,"
said sophomore Eric Shih, a Chinese American and a
supporter of affirmative action.
He added that Filipino Americans and Southeast
Asian Americans are grossly underrepresented in
higher education, though many are not aware of the
differences in representations among the Asian
races — for example, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino
or Chinese — despite stark disparities in their social
status in the United States.
"The claim that affirmative action programs hurt
Asian Americans fails to recognize this social reality
and attempts to divide the people of color communi
ty so as to perpetuate current injustice," Shih said.
Senior Allen Koh, a Korean American, said he be
lieves the implementation of affirmative action could
be improved and described why he finds fault with
the current system.
"I am for it in principle, but against it as it functions
now," Koh said. "I think affirmative action should
come into play if two people are equally qualified;
however, it's ludicrous fora less-qualified person to
win out based on race, regardless of how marginally
less-qualified that person is."
Koh said that affirmative action
is futile in the United States because
the government is not designed to
create equality and gives residents
the setting they need to succeed.
" 'Ail men are created equal' is
crap," Koh said. "The Founding
Fathers didn't believe it and no one
else should either. America is the
land of opportunity, not equality."
Koh continued, "I've seen first
hand, what it's like fora minority
to try to make it in this country.
The bottom line is that hard work
pays off. Some people cry and
moan and bitch about racism, but
it's not like there was a rush of peo
ple wanting to help out my par
ents. Immigrants usually have a
problem with language, but that
hasn't stopped them and minori
ties in general from becoming part
of the collection of countless suc
cess stories in America."
However, Shih thinks that the
affirmative action system helps

Asian Americans.
"My presence here at Stanford is
not only the consequence of my
hard work but also of the structural
assistance I've received over the
years," Shih said. "While we may
hold color-blindness as an ideal,
I've come to see how race continues
to have a serious impact on our lives
and as such, requires us to act affir
matively if we are to ever achieve a
fair, just and equitable stx iety."
Whereas Shih found that affir
mative action should continue to
be based on race, Koh expressed
his belief in hard work morals as
central to success.
While Koh and Shih both
agreed with affirmative action in
principle, junior Mike Wu, a Chi
nese American, emphasized his
disagreement with the way affir
mative action attempts to battle
racism today.
"Affirmative action started as a
necessary institution, but as time
progressed, it became an outdated
item," Wu said. "It is essentially
fighting racism with counter
racism. Socioeconomic back
ground should replace race as a
factor. Both of my parents are pro

lessors, so I realize that I was given
certain benefits not given others."
He added, "Race is no longer a
consistent and reliable means of se
lecting less advantaged applicants
anymore."
Although Wu argued affirma
tive action's futility and even its
possible exacerbation of racism, he
suggested that reforming its basis
to socioeconomic background
could evolve into a system that
would benefit people more.
Melissa Brown, assistant profes
sor of anthropological sciences,
spoke of the implications that eth
nicity has in affirmative action.
"It used to be that 'ethnic' meant
poor, but that correlation is no
longer so strong," Brown said.
"Ethnic minorities today span all
the economic classes. We still need
affirmative action because a dispro
portionate number of ethnic mi
norities remain in the lower-middle

and working classes and face dis
crimination at all class levels. How
ever, it is important to consider the
success that has been achieved be
cause that success [in turn] pro
motes opposition to affirmative ac
tion, among some whites and
among some ethnic minorities."
"Identity comes into play here
because people still talk about af
firmative action as based on ethnic
categories," Brown continued.
"People also talk about ethnic
identity as based on culture
and / or ancestry, but ethnic iden
tity is formed through people's so
cial and political experiences —
how they are treated in and by
their society on a daily basis —
and how people are treated is
strongly affected by their econom
ic class."
According to Brown, Asian
Americans are divided in their
opinions about affirmative action

because they experience "differ
ences in economic class and in the
discrimination" they face. These
different experiences influence
their views of affirmative action
and even of their own identity.
"I don't think that we can set af
firmative action to solely targeting
economic class, because ethnic mi
norities who are poor face addi
tional barriers of discrimination
that whites who are poor do not,
but I do think that, if we really
want to promote social justice, af
firmative action policies need to go
beyond ethnic categories to more
strongly take economic class into
account," Brown said.
While Brown and Wu have

identified socioeconomic back
ground as an important factor,
sophomore Eddie Kim, a Korean
American who feels he had a com
fortable upbringing and bases his
beliefs on the opportunities that
were granted his parents, related
affirmative action more to helping
people in need than helping peo
ple based on the color of their skin.
"In many cases, an impover
ished Asian American or white
person living in poverty in south
central LA. grows up with the
same disadvantages as an African
American or Hispanic in the same
situation," Kim said. "Affirmative
action should consider a wide vari
ety of factors, not simply race."
