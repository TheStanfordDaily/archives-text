The ending of bondage
"The power of the people's voice breaks through the age-old bondage
and points the way to the future.
More and more, the people are realizing that the role of government is to
dispense the needs of the people, that there is no problem or difficulty in which war
is the only solution.
The sour voices of power-hungry leaders may, for the moment, seduce
the fearful or unwary, but their time is limited, is drawing to a close."
