## Allies battle for Baghdad airport 
### 
(AP) — Army forces launched a
nighttime attack on Saddam Inter
national Airport just outside Bagh
dad yesterday and fought running
battles with Iraqis along the city's
southern fringes. "A vise is closing
on the regime," President Bush
told cheering Marines stateside.
Some front-line units went on
heightened alert against the threat
of chemical weapons, ordered to
wear rubber boots and suits de
spite temperatures that soared
into the 90s.
There was fierce lighting in
Kut, to the south, where desperate
Iraqis armed with rilles charged
tanks in a suicide raid. "We
mowed down" the attackers, said
Lt. Col. B P. McCoy.
Tracer rounds lit the night sky
and artillery boomed near the
airport a few miles from the heart
of Saddam Hussein's capital.
Army units encountered little re
sistance along the airport road,
their convoy passing dead Iraqi
soldiers and piles of discarded

military uniforms.
Along the city's southern edge,
Army tanks and Bradley vehicles
destroyed more than seven Iraqi
armored personnel carriers and
more than 15 Iraqi tanks in light
ing that went on for more than
four hours.
Two weeks into the war, Amer
ican commanders reported a
string of successes — on the battle
field and within an Iraqi popula
tion initially reticent about em
bracing invading troops. Kurdish
lighters in the north chipped in,
when a top leader suggested they
may agree not to seek control of
the northern city of Kirkuk.
Despite declarations that tough
lighting lies ahead, the nation's top
military official indicated there may
not be an all-out battle for Bagh
dad. Gen. Richard Myers, chair
man of the Joint Chiefs of Stall', sug
gested isolating members of the old
regime in place — cut off from the
country — with an "interim admin
istration" in place to begin work on

a postwar government.
There were battlefield setbacks,
as well. Two Marines were killed
and one injured in the close-quar
ters lighting in Kut. The Navy
mounted a search fora pilot miss
ing since his Hornet jet was lost to
unknown causes on Wednesday.
The toll of American troops
dead passed 50, and Bush trav
eled to Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
which has lost 13 — more than
any other installation.
To the cheers of thousands
earlier in a speech, he vowed vic
tory, and said, "A vise is closing on
the regime."
Iraq issued the latest in a series
of exhortations in Saddam's name.
"Fight them with your hands. God
will disgrace them," it said, refer
ring to invading American and
British troops.
For the first time in the war,
large parts of Baghdad lost elec
tricity. The cause was not known,
and Myers said that Americans
had "not targeted the power grid."
