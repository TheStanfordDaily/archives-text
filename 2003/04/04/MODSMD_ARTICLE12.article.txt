# States turn to beer to fix budgets
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” With cash tight
and bills looming, legislators around the
country are turning to neighborhood pubs to
help them drown their woes: At least 19 states
are considering plans to boost beer taxes.
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell has pro
posed one of the heftiest hikes, a plan that
would raise the tax on a gallon of beer for the
first time since 1947, from 8 cents to a quar
ter. It would add 14 cents to the cost of an av
erage six pack and raise $55 million.
The proposal was met with good-natured
boos and catcalls when Rendell unveiled it in
a speech to the Legislature last month, but he
isn't the only one looking to alcohol to close
a budget gap.
Utah lawmakers have passed a bill to
raise the beer tax from $ 11 per barrel to
$12.80, while Idaho is considering more

than doubling its tax to a nickel per can.
Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn wants to tem
porarily increase the state beer tax from 9
cents to 17 cents per gallon, and Arkansas
lawmakers voted to renew a 3 percent tax
hike on beer, passed two years ago to aid
child education programs.
The proposals have generated loud com
plaints from brewers.
"For us to eat half a buck a case would be
very difficult for us at this stage of the
game," said David Casinelli, spokesman for
the D.G. Yuengling 8c Son brewery. "It
seems like every time the state needs money,
they come to alcohol or tobacco, and,
frankly, it's not fair."
At least 23 states have considered raising
beer taxes in the past two years, but only a
handful of proposals have passed.
