# Jobless rate up, new recession feared
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
number of American workers filing
new claims for unemployment bene
fits climbed last week to the highest
point in nearly a year as businesses
trimmed jobs in the muddled wartime
economic climate.
The Labor Department reported
yesterday that new applications for job
less benefits jumped by a seasonally ad
justed 38,000 to 445,000 for the week
ending March 29 — a level last reached
in the week ending April 13,2002.
"It is the pall of the Iraqi war, high
er energy prices and lower stock prices
just weighing on the willingness of
companies to maintain jobs," said Mark

Zandi, chief economist at
Economy.com. "The uncertainty is so
high they just can't think about ex
panding their businesses at this point."
A second report offered more unset
tling news: Activity in the service
sector — normally the engine of job cre
ation in the United States — contracted
in March, ending 13 months of growth.
The Institute for Supply Manage
ment reported that its nonmanufac
turing index sank to 47.9 in March,
from a reading of 53.9 in February. An
index reading below 50 means activity
contracted.
"It is clear that the war is having a
negative impact on most sectors of the

economy," said Maury Harris, chief
economist at ÜBS Warburg.
The institute reported this week
that manufacturing activity shrank in
March, raising fears the economy may
be headed fora new recession.
I n the jobless claims report, the pace
of layoffs was worse than economists
were predicting. They were forecasting
claims to rise to around 410,000.
Economists say claims above the
400,000 mark generally show an ex
tremely weak job market.
Economists believe the economy lost
40,000 jobs last month — not good
news, but not as bad as the situation in
February, when payrolls fell by 308,000.
