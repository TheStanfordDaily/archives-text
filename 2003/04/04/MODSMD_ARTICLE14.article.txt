## The 						Stanford Daily Cyclists must obey the law 
### 
Editorial

The Stanford campus has an ad
mirable reputation for bicycle
friendliness. It has miles of bicy
cle lanes and paths, roads pass
able only by bicycles and pedestrians, bicy
cle security facilities at home football
games and thousands of conveniently
placed rack spaces. Nobel Laureates,
Deans of Schools and emerti faculty can be
spotted along with students riding in some
of the most popular areas on campus.
Many in the Stanford community ride
from their homes to a CalTrain station,
while some even load their bicycles on the
train, then the Marguerite and then bicy
cle to their place of work or study.
Such a pleasing portrait is not without
the blemishes of cyclists who treat bicycle

safety contemptuously.
In the past several
months, Parking and
Transportation Services
has conducted pro
grams to educate cam
pus cyclists about their
rights and responsibili
ties, and public safety
officers have written
numerous citations for
bicycle traffic infrac
tions. Many complaints
have arisen among stu
dents regarding the na
ture of the Department
of Public Safety's en-

ways, the California Department of Motor
Vehicles, or the Department of Public
Safety.
During the spring quarter, as the winter
rains cease, students may assume a more
laid-back demeanor. We want to empha
size that such laxity ought not extend to cy
cling on campus. Negligent or reckless be
havior when riding a bicycle endangers
not only the cyclist, but also those with
whom the cyclist shares the right-of-way.
Schussing through stop signs or prattling
on a cell phone while cycling endangers
motorists, pedestrians and other cyclists,
who must suddenly take defensive action
to avoid a collision and may in turn en
danger others. It should also go without
saying that riding a bicycle while intoxicat-

forcement of traffic laws
among cyclists and of the costly infrac
tion fines.
But cyclists must understand that they
have the same obligation to obey traffic
laws as drivers of automobiles. Bicycles are
considered vehicles in the California Vehi
cle Code. As such, operators of bicycles
enjoy the same legal consideration as mo
torists do with their automobiles. Many cy
clists seem to believe they owe no burden in
exchange for this benefit and therefore
may obey traffic laws at their option. The
Daily receives letters frequently from Skin
ford community members irate about this
sort of reckless behavior.
We support the Department of Public
Safety in enforcing traffic laws among cy
clists. Since far too many cyclists seem dis
posed to disobey traffic laws, we do not re
gard the existing traffic fines for cyclists as
excessive. Rather, if the fines were not so
high, cyclists would have little incentive to
obey traffic laws, and unsafe cyclist behav
ior would not change. If a cyclist is unable
to obey traffic laws, it is the sole fault of the
cyclist — not motorists, designers of road-

Ed is just as irresponsi
ble and reprehensible
as driving an automo
bile while impaired.
11 serves well to re
mind everyone at Stan
ford that there are cer
tain areas on campus at
which cyclists need to
observe extra caution
and courtesy: the cross
walks on Mayfield Av
enue in front of FloMo,
the intersections of
Campus Drive East
and Escondido Road,
Campus Drive East
and Serra Street, and

Santa Teresa Street and Lomita Drive —
and of course the Intersection of Death—
Escondido Mall and Lasuen Mall, in front
of the Clock lower. We urge all cyclists rid
ing in these locations to consider the safety
of others, as well as their own.
Bicycle safety also includes having
proper safety equipment. All cyclists
should equip their bicycles with a front
light and use it after dusk or in rainy
weather. Those registering their bicycles
at the Parking and Transportation Ser
vices office (340 Bonair Siding, off Cam
pus Drive East) receive a free halogen
headlight, rear LED light and reflective
leg bands.
As with operating a car, cycling is a priv
ilege, governed by laws designed to maxi
mize orderliness and safety. Motorists and
cyclists alike who abuse their privileges
deserve the same level of punishment.
Likewise, both are responsible for courte
ous behavior. Cyclists on campus need to
step up and exhibit the kind of courtesy
they expect of motorists and pedestrians
toward them.
