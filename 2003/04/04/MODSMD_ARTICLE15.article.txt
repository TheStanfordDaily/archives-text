# ANIMAL FARM
## One big happy family 
### 
I remember going to parties
Tail quarter of my freshman
year. A pack of 20 Larkinites
would congregate in the
lounge and then wander around
campus looking for the biggest
rager. It seemed like a defense
mechanism at the time — strength
in numbers, protection from the
big bad world of Stanford.
But as time has passed, my
world of safety has expanded.
Whereas I once felt protected in
my insular freshman dorm, I've
grown to feel comforted by any
thing and anyone Stanford.
I guess I didn't realize the ex
tent of it until this spring break.
Spring break is one of the few
times when you have no responsi
bilities — no work hanging over
your head, no family obligations
that plague you during winter
break.
It is a time to let go, go crazy, get
psyched for spring quarter. It's
one week of freedom from the
pressures of life at Stanford, which
students find especially stressful
during winter quarter. Yet my
spring break was anything but a
break from Stanford. I saw plenty
of Stanford people. I couldn't walk
down VVaikiki beach without
bumping into a bunch of peers in
string bikinis.
Any club or bar was packed with
Stanford students. While sitting at
one bar, a friend told me it felt like
Senior Pub Night. Funny that this
was true when we were thousands
miles away from Palo Alto.
'Ibis didn't feel like MTV
Spring Break or Girls Gone Wild.
(Which, I must admit, was proba

bly a good thing. My spring break
in Cancun, a.k.a.Disney World for
college students, last year left me
with a bad impression of the typical
college student from middle Amer
ica, wearing too many gold chains
around an overgrown neck.)
This new abroad program
called Stanford in Honolulu
showed me that when it comes
right down to it, Stanford people

are obsessed with
each other. We
can't let each
other go. We act
like we are all best
friends. Even in a
city with new and
interesting peo
ple, Stanford stu
dents managed

to find one another and stick to
gether. Stanford is like a small
town where everyone cares a little
too much about everyone else's
business.
The epitome of this attempt at
familiarity is our little naming sys
tem we've developed for each
other. Have you ever noticed that
you don't know anyone's last name
at this school?
The common nomenclature
consists of the person's first name
and some part of the person's iden
tity; the dorm she lives in, the sport
he plays, her sorority, his major.
Branner Kim, Water Polo Jack,
Sarah in Theta, Econ Bill. Usually
this narrows it down enough that
your friends have some idea of who
you're talking about.
Thanks to things like the fresh
man face book, a first name is all
you need. You skip to the index,

find all the listings for Greg, and
then look at every picture until
you figure out just who it was that
you were kissing on the dance
floor of Theta Delt. And you ask
your roommate fora second opin
ion because man, was it dark in
there.
Oh don't deny that you still use
the face book; I'm a junior and
that thing is my bible. I wouldn't
be able to find order in the Stan
ford chaos without it.
I'm curious about the implica
tions of this intimacy for the fu
ture. Will you still be obsessed with
Stanford people and Stanford
things after your time on the Farm
is over? I feel like this isn't realistic,
and yet 1 hear things that make me
think differently.
Rumor has it that Stanford has
one of the highest alumni mar
riage rates of any university. And
it's not necessarily someone you
dated while you were at Stanford.
It's more likely to be someone you
meet later in life, through a friend
of a friend, or at work in the distant
cities of New York or D.C.
Maybe that's what the college ex
perience is supposed to be about,
creating a comforting environment
where you feel safe and able to take
risks. If anything, it's just kind of
ironic to me that, intellectually,
Stanford students are so able to
take risks, try new things, explore
unknown territories. And yet so
cially, we are such wimps. We cling
to Stanford life with an iron grip.
