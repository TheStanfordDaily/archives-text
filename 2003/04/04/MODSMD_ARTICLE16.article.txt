After months of trying to have letters
published, conservatives 'no longer care'
Lillian Ho's guest column, "Campus
conservatives should speak up and write
in" (April 3) initially brought up interest
ing and thoughtful points regarding con
servative voices on campus, but then de
generated into a column filled with unin
formed statements.
Sadly, the explanation that few people
see conservative letters in The Daily is sim
ply because The Daily refuses to print
them fora variety of inane reasons.
Among the many reasons writers have re
ceived for rejection are that their letters
are "untimely," "a little too long," or "ir
relevant at this time." We can produce 10
to 15 samples of letters sent this year for
anyone who wishes to see them.
These letters, many regarding Iraq,
ROTC and liberal student groups on cam
pus, are well-written, but they are not un
timely, a little too long or irrelevant at this
time. Apparently, to fit The Daily's letter
criteria, a writer must mention something
about bike safety or the lack of diversity in
anti-war rally photographs in their letter.
So, after months of trying to submit letters,

some conservative writers no longer care
to put the effort into submitting a letter
only to have it rejected because it's "un
timely."
Furthermore, The Daily has thus far re
fused to print the results from our campus
survey after they expressly agreed to run
it. We visited most dorms on campus and
obtained the political opinions of more
than 1,500 of Stanford undergraduates,
enough to ascertain a general idea of the
campus's political persuasion. Included in
the survey were questions pertaining to
Iraq, conservatism and liberalism, abor
tion, presidential candidate preference
and political party preference. Additional
ly, we met with Daily staff to tabulate the
results and analyze their meaning. The
Stanford Review graciously delayed the
printing of the results in a courtesy to The
Daily with the understanding that they
were writing a story on it and would run it
soon, if not immediately.
The Daily has now had the results and
their own analysis of the survey for nearly
two months. Perhaps they did not like the
results, which indicated that one in five
students identify themselves as Republi
can, while an even greater number identi
fy themselves as conservative. Fora Cali
fornia college campus, that is a relatively
large number and — most people on this

campus would agree — higher than most
Stanford students would have guessed.
But since The Daily and Ho are con
cerned about the conservative voice being
"underdeveloped" on campus, the Stan
ford College Republicans will gladly con
tribute 10 or more writers for daily or
weekly articles with a conservative or liber
tarian perspective. The Stanford College
Republican has one of the largest official
membership counts of any student group
on campus and is growing everyday. VVc
can easily produce the writers if T he Daily
wants them and will publish their letters,
but until The Daily shows a willingness to
be fair in their letter selection, we'll contin
ue writing for other organizations.

Editor's Note: The Daily runs letters that are well-urritten
and pertain to the Stanford community at the time the let
ters are submitted. When letters are too long. The Daily
asks the writers to re-submit a shorter lettei or write a guest
column. After reviewing the data for the aforementioned
survey, many neies editors questioned the methodology used
by those who administered the survey and declined to run
the data in The Daily.

Bush's foreign policies are
'frustrating and threatening'
In his letter to the editor, "Anti-war sen
timent is not underrepresented" (April 2),
Craig Baumgartner claims that Americans
still don't know why this war is happening
because "individuals [are] failing to keep
themselves informed." In response to his
letter, I would like to draw the author's at
tention to a common misunderstanding.
It is true that television programs such as
The Daily Show on Comedy Central can
be considered as entertainment, but they
are also sources of information, delivered
in the form of political satire. Ironically,
even the satire in The Daily Show can
claim to be more sincere than such self
styled fountains of truth as CNN and FOX
News.
As for Baumgartner's opinion that
President Bush is not "an embarrassment
to the American people" or a "warmon
ger," I can only add the following. De
scribing Bush from a U.S.-citizen's point of
view as being "an embarrassment" is an
understatement, since such a term ap
pears more appropriate for slapstick co
medians. As a non-U.S. citizen, I would
like to also add that Bush's role in current
international affairs is perceived by the
global community as frustrating and

threatening.
The author is right in criticizing The
Daily's claim that Bush is a warmonger.
The fact of the matter is that neoconserva
tive defense intellectuals such as Paul Wol
fowitz and Donald Rumsfeld have been
providing scholarly advice for the presi
dent and thereby have been encouraging
him to view the world through clause
witzian spectacles.
But now a matter that is very dear to
me: Baumgartner states "amnesic coun
tries like France and Germany are reluc
tant to take . . . unpopular stands on any
thing." Under what circumstance should
the elected French and German govern
ments oppose popular opinion and in this
case push for war against Iraq? Only when
threatened. The absence of any credible
evidence linking global terrorism and the
Iraqi regime or of an imminent Iraqi at
tack forces Germany and France to op
pose this war.
So what are the motives for going to
war? I think the German writer and Nobel
laureate Gunther Grass delivered a beau
tiful and sharp comment describing very
well the European popular opinion on this
matter: "This wanted war will be followed
by other wars with the same drive behind
them, the drive for oil and domi
nance." How often have I heard
that this war is fought for the Iraqi
people with "humane bombs"
(Rumsfeld) in order "to bring
democracy to the people of this
country" (Bush) when U.S.
democracy itself is ridden by elec
tile dysfunction. The popular ma
jorities in France and Germany, in
cluding their elected representa

tives in parliament, do not buy this.
They have not forgotten the mad
ness of past wars.

President has right to disagree
with student concerns
regarding war
In <ts editorial, "Why student
voice matters," The Daily asserts
that "President Bush has refused
to listen to the protests of college

students in declaring this war
against Iraq, but students should
not give up." Get over your
selves.
There are many sound argu
ments against the war. But the
president did not subvert the
democratic process or trample on
students' rights by making a deci
sion that students do not agree
with. Elected representatives in
both the House and the Senate
voted overwhelmingly on October
11 to give the president their ad
vance approval to mount a military
strike against Iraq.
Simply because students and

other citizens at Stanford and
across the nation are protesting
does not endow their votes with
greater weight than those of the
majority of Americans who sup
ported military action in Iraq and
continue to support the war today.
Argue against the war. Argue
against the president's policies.
But do not whine about being ig
nored. He has heard you and has
disagreed with you. That's as
much a part of our democracy as
the freedom of speech.
