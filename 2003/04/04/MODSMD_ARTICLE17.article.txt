# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Community Day celebrates cooperation and partnership 
### GORDON EARLE GUEST COLUMNIST 
Last spring, I spent a lot of time shut
tling between Palo Alto and New York
City, which was then my home. I was in
terviewing for my current position at Stan
ford and getting to know the University
and local community. During one of my
final visits, I noticed colorful banners
strung along El Camino. It only took an in
stant to read the words: "Community Day
at Stanford." I was intrigued.
Community Day, I was told, was an all
day open house during which members of
the community could visit the campus
with their families and participate in activ
ities ranging from music, arts and athletic
events to science displays, a children's car
nival and health fair. And all for free.
"Cool," my 9-year-old said, after I filled
him in.
Unfortunately, I missed last year's
Community Day, the first ever held at

Stanford. But when I moved here several
months later, I knew what my first official
act would be as the new vice president for
public affairs: to announce the Universi
ty's second Community Day, which takes
place on Sunday, April 6.
Why vas this so important? Because
Community Day is both real and symbolic.
The reality, of course, is die actual event,
which brings Stanford together with its
neighbors. Everyone is invited, and last year
more dian 6,000 people participated. But
the symbolism — the spirit of the event — is
just as important. It's a day when the Uni
versity celebrates its partnerships with the
community and highlights many of its aca
demic and recreational programs.
The event is significant because it fos
ters ongoing interaction between Stanford
and the community. The East Palo Alto
Mural Project is just one example. The
project represents a collaboration between
artists and area residents, who work with
local teenagers to create murals in East

Palo Alto schools that celebrate the com
munity's history and culture. The project's
current mural, as well as the artists who
created it, will be part of Community Day.
With engagement comes discovery
and the exploration of new ideas. I, for
example, had not heard of Gravity Probe
B until a few weeks ago when I reviewed
the Community Day program schedule.
It's the name of a future NASA mission
based at Stanford that will study Ein
stein's theory of relativity, among other
things. A booth explaining the project
will be on display during Community
Day and include models, demonstrations
and presentations. Mission specialists —
under the gaze of a life-sized picture of
Einstein — will be available to describe
complicated science in a way we can all
understand.
Community Day also allows us to
glimpse into the future. Students involved
in the Stanford Solar Car Project will talk
about the latest developments in pollu

tion-free transportation — and it's any
thing but theoretical. These students build
solar cars with the goal of developing the
fastest two-person solar-powered car on
the planet. The group also races its cars —
in its last competition, the students placed
second out of a field of 32 in a race from
Chicago to Los Angeles.
While many of us won't be zooming
around in such cars any time soon, there
are other Community Day activities that de
liver an immediate impact. For example,
the Haas Center for Public Service, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity and Stanford Uni
versity Communications will sponsor the
first Community Day 5K Run/Walk at
Stanford. All proceeds from the event will
benefit the East Palo Alto YMCA.
Diversity — which celebrates all peo
ples and cultures — represents a final im
portant aspect of Community Day.
Gamma Zeta Alpha, a fraternity with a
Latino focus, will host a vasos-making
workshop (vasos are traditional Mexican

bowls), allowing local residents to under
stand the historical and cultural signifi
cance of vasos in Latino culture. The Ku
umba Dance Ensemble will educate Com
munity Day visitors about dance traditions
from Africa. And the Taiwanese Cultural
Society will share Taiwanese culture
through interactive, hands-on activities
featuring calligraphy and Chinese yo-yo
performances.
Shortly before his death, Leland Stan
ford wrote in a letter to David Starr Jor
dan, the university's first president, that
"one of the most important things to be
taught in the institution is co-operation."
It is this spirit that drives Community Day,
as well as the university's desire to be in
clusive, encourage partnership, stress ed
ucation and learning, and promote en
gagement with others.
We hope to see you there.
