## Card takes hot bats to frigid air 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
April in Palo Alto — perhaps
the perfect time of year for baseball
in beautiful spring weather on
campus. Maybe that's why the Pa
cific- 10 Conference schedulers de
cided to ship No. 4 Stanford to
Pullman, Wash, this weekend fora
series of hardball in the snow
against Washington State.
Nonetheless, perhaps the cold
Washington air will shock life into
the Cardinal (18-10, 4-2 Pac-10)
after a dreadful loss to the lowly
University of San Francisco Tues
day night that gave Stanford a sour
start to its easiest month on paper
of the past few seasons.
If the Cardinal drops just one
game to the Cougars (9-19, 1-2
Pac-10) — which hasn't happened
since Pac-10 play began in 1999 —
even Palo Alto might not seem like
a very sunny place come practice
on Monday afternoon.

Despite dropping the mid
week, non-conference affair to the
Dons, Stanford has won six consec
utive series after losing its first two.
The Cardinal offense has found
a groove in recent weeks, scoring
nine runs per game and hitting
.362 over its last 12 contests.
Stanford also knocked out double
digit hits in each of those games,
helped in part by junior Sam
Fuld's current 12-game hit streak,
during which he has hit .508.
Fuld is one short of his career

best and four short of Carlos
Quentin's current 16-game hit
streak, a run that has lifted his bat
ting average to .400 and led him to
his 200 th career hit Tuesday night.
While Fuld and Quentin are
pursuing measures of consistency,
senior Ryan Carko's impressive
five-game tear does them one bet
ter. The senior backstop is hitting
.591 at the plate with two home
runs and 11 RBI in the last five
Stanford games, and Garko now
leads the team in both homers,
with six, and RBI, at 36.
The last time Marquess led his
squad north to frigid Pullman, the
Cardinal fared quite well. Stanford
swept the May 2001 series,
outscoring the Cougars 45-10 in
the three games.
The Cardinal has made a habit
of pummeling their conference
foe, pounding Washington State
for 29 runs and allowingjust five in

Junior second baseman Jonny Ash, who tied a career high with three hits against Washington last Friday, and the rest of
the Cardinal looks to continue their string of six consecutive series victories with a trip to Washington State this weekend.
