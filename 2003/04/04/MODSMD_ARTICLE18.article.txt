## Card takes hot bats to frigid air 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
April in Palo Alto — perhaps
the perfect time of year for baseball
in beautiful spring weather on
campus. Maybe that's why the Pa
cific- 10 Conference schedulers de
cided to ship No. 4 Stanford to
Pullman, Wash, this weekend fora
series of hardball in the snow
against Washington State.
Nonetheless, perhaps the cold
Washington air will shock life into
the Cardinal (18-10, 4-2 Pac-10)
after a dreadful loss to the lowly
University of San Francisco Tues
day night that gave Stanford a sour
start to its easiest month on paper
of the past few seasons.
If the Cardinal drops just one
game to the Cougars (9-19, 1-2
Pac-10) — which hasn't happened
since Pac-10 play began in 1999 —
even Palo Alto might not seem like
a very sunny place come practice
on Monday afternoon.

Despite dropping the mid
week, non-conference affair to the
Dons, Stanford has won six consec
utive series after losing its first two.
The Cardinal offense has found
a groove in recent weeks, scoring
nine runs per game and hitting
.362 over its last 12 contests.
Stanford also knocked out double
digit hits in each of those games,
helped in part by junior Sam
Fuld's current 12-game hit streak,
during which he has hit .508.
Fuld is one short of his career

best and four short of Carlos
Quentin's current 16-game hit
streak, a run that has lifted his bat
ting average to .400 and led him to
his 200 th career hit Tuesday night.
While Fuld and Quentin are
pursuing measures of consistency,
senior Ryan Carko's impressive
five-game tear does them one bet
ter. The senior backstop is hitting
.591 at the plate with two home
runs and 11 RBI in the last five
Stanford games, and Garko now
leads the team in both homers,
with six, and RBI, at 36.
The last time Marquess led his
squad north to frigid Pullman, the
Cardinal fared quite well. Stanford
swept the May 2001 series,
outscoring the Cougars 45-10 in
the three games.
The Cardinal has made a habit
of pummeling their conference
foe, pounding Washington State
for 29 runs and allowingjust five in

Junior second baseman Jonny Ash, who tied a career high with three hits against Washington last Friday, and the rest of
the Cardinal looks to continue their string of six consecutive series victories with a trip to Washington State this weekend.
their Sunken Diamond meetings
last season.
The hot Stanford bats should
only face a challenge from the
weather this weekend and not
from the Cougars' arms, as fore
casts predict cold temperatures
and precipitation throughout the
series.
The series will be Washington
State's first at home this season due
to the cold weather throughout
the spring months.
While the Cougars have a team
ER\ above 6.00, their starters are
not complete pushovers on the
hill.
This afternoon's starter, Tony
Banaszak, has returned from
Tommy John surgery in the off
season to achieve a respectable
3.99 ERA, and his 1-6 record re
flects Washington State's troubles
at the plate more than his own. In
his eight starts, the Cougars have
managed just 18 runs in support
of Banaszak.
That trend may not change, as
junior John Hudgins takes the
mound today for Stanford seek
ing his first win since before the
final exam break. Hudgins leads
the Pac-10 in strikeouts with 61
and has only walked 13, giving
the Cardinal a chance to win each
ballgame that he starts.
Tomorrow, senior Ryan Mc-
Cally puts his 3-1 record up
against Washington State's Bryce
Chamberlain. While McCally has

been a bedrock in the second spot
of Stanford's rotation this season,
Chamberlain has struggled in
2003.
With an ERA approaching
6.00, Chamberlain made it 7 1/3
innings last week against UC-
Irvine and surrendered just four
runs, but his offense couldn't man
age anything for him at the plate as
he took the loss.
In Sunday's finale at Pullman,
Cardinal freshman Mark Ro
manczuk looks to regain the form
that made him Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week after his March 24 start
at No. 7 Arizona State. Ro
manczuk's complete game, five-hit
performance in Tempe earned
him the honor despite a much
rougher outing on Sunday (the
end of the Pac-10 week) at home
against Washington that saw him
exit in the fourth.
The freshman leads the confer
ence with a 6-0 record in what has
thus far been an excellent rookie
campaign.
Ironically, Sunday's task may
be the toughest for Stanford hit
ters, as right-hander Aaron
MacKenzie takes the mound for
Washington State. MacKenzie has
held opponents to a .238 average
and shut out California for four
innings two weeks ago at Evans
Diamond in Berkeley to earn the
win.
In order to avoid a frost-bitten,
nighttime affair in Pullman, the
teams will play three afternoon
games over the weekend. Today's
begins at 3 p.m., with tomorrow's
and Sunday's set to start at 12 p.m.
and 11 a.m., respectively.
