Many water polo spectators don't no
tice the goalie down at the other end of
the pool â€” because Stanford's offense
usually has competitors playing defense
for the majority of the game.

Today: No 2 Stanford at No. 17 UC-lrvine, 4 p.m.
Saturday: Stanford at No. 4 Long Beach State,
12 p.m.

But in a big game, you'll notice Jackie
Frank, the Cardinal's senior goalkeeper,
as she blocks shot after shot from even
the most talented of shooters. Frank is
not only the starting goalie at Stanford,
but she also plays with the U.S. National
team.
Frank, named Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation co-player of the week,
will face face off against the other recipi
ent of the award, sophomore goalkeeper
Bri Hawkins of Long Beach State, as No.
2 Stanford (15-1, 5-0 MPSF) heads south
this weekend to compete in two league
matches.
The first will be today at 4 p.m. against
No. 17 UC-Irvine (14-15, 1-6). Saturday
will demand more from the Cardinal,
with a matchup against the No. 4 49ers
(16-5,5-2).
The Cardinal's success will again de
pend largely on Frank, who has been the
backbone of the Cardinal defense all year
and throughout her Stanford career.
In addition to her honors this week,
Frank was named MPSF player of the
week earlier in the season after her stellar
goalkeeping in the Cardinal's victories
against UC-Santa Barbara and UCLA,
both top-10 teams. She held the two

teams to a collective five goals, with 23
saves altogether that week.
Frank earned this week's accolade by
holding Southern California (12-3, 7-1
MPSF) to only three goals with 12 saves
during her team's 5-3 win last Saturday. A
three-time All-American, Frank is averag
ing more than eight saves per game, as
well as allowing only three goals per game.
"Jackie is a focused competitor; she
plays the best in the biggest games,"
coach John Tanner said. "She is well bal
anced in the water; she blocks not only
with her arms but keeps her legs under
her.
"When an opponent is faking, she
maintains her position, which is especial

ly effective on corner shots. There is just
nowhere to shoot on her."
Among other awards of recognition in
the 2001 national championship season,
Frank was named MPSF goalie of the
year and MVP of the NCAA tournament.
On the academic front, she was
named Academic All-American for the
second year in a row and also received
Stanford's Block S Outstanding Female
Junior award.
The Human Biology major stopped
out of school this fall, however, in order
to train with the national team, where she
is the starting goalie. She will take off the

Senior goalkeeper Jackie Frank, who has helped Stanford to a 15-1 record, denies a shot
earlier this season. The U.S. National team member looks to continue her dominance as
the Cardinal travels south to take on UC-Irvine and Long Beach State this weekend.
