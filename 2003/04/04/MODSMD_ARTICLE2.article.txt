# Stanford issues tax-free bonds

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford broke new financial ground last week
when it became the first private university in California
to issue tax-exempt commercial paper â€” a short-term
loan at prevailing interest rates. The $150 million
issue, which will bring the University's outstanding
debt to $1.4 billion, will give Stanford more advanta
geous interest rates and greater financial flexibility.
"Stanford was the first [private university] to ap
proach us, the authority, to do that," said Terry Part
ington, executive director of the California Education
al Facilities Authority. "1 really expect [their use of
commercial paper] to be a model for the larger col
leges, especially in California, that have a lot of projects
going on [which] they can finance in that manner."
Tax-exempt bonds are much "cheaper" for the
University than the taxable paper it has issued in the
past, explained Stanford's Director of Finance and
Bondholder Relations Odile Disch-Bhadkamkar.
"Tax exempt debt is 75 to 80 percent cheaper than
taxable debt," she said. "It's tax-free for the investors."
Because they cannot be taxed, tax-exempt bonds
allow the issuer to get a significantly lower interest rate
than the market would demand on taxable bonds.
The program also enables the University to better
align spending and borrowing, due to the short-term
nature of the paper.
"It's a very attractive time to stay in short-term debt
because the short-term rates are extremely low,"
Disch-Bhadkamkar explained.
Maturities on commercial paper are usually a mat
ter of months, rarely ranging longer than 270 days.
Stanford is currently getting a 0.95 percent interest
rate on its tax-exempt paper.
The University typically uses debt to finance capital
improvement projects and other irregular outlays.
"When we go ahead with [a] capital project we iden
tify the source of the funding up front," Disch-Bhad
kamkar said. "Most of those projects receive a combi
nation of gift 112 unding and debt funding."
The University has issued commercial paper since
1992, but it was taxable. As a non-profit institution,
Stanford was eligible to seek authorization from the
state fora tax-exempt issue like it has done in the past
for long-term bonds. Eastern colleges like Harvard
