# Stanford issues tax-free bonds

### MARK THOMA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Stanford broke new financial ground last week
when it became the first private university in California
to issue tax-exempt commercial paper — a short-term
loan at prevailing interest rates. The $150 million
issue, which will bring the University's outstanding
debt to $1.4 billion, will give Stanford more advanta
geous interest rates and greater financial flexibility.
"Stanford was the first [private university] to ap
proach us, the authority, to do that," said Terry Part
ington, executive director of the California Education
al Facilities Authority. "1 really expect [their use of
commercial paper] to be a model for the larger col
leges, especially in California, that have a lot of projects
going on [which] they can finance in that manner."
Tax-exempt bonds are much "cheaper" for the
University than the taxable paper it has issued in the
past, explained Stanford's Director of Finance and
Bondholder Relations Odile Disch-Bhadkamkar.
"Tax exempt debt is 75 to 80 percent cheaper than
taxable debt," she said. "It's tax-free for the investors."
Because they cannot be taxed, tax-exempt bonds
allow the issuer to get a significantly lower interest rate
than the market would demand on taxable bonds.
The program also enables the University to better
align spending and borrowing, due to the short-term
nature of the paper.
"It's a very attractive time to stay in short-term debt
because the short-term rates are extremely low,"
Disch-Bhadkamkar explained.
Maturities on commercial paper are usually a mat
ter of months, rarely ranging longer than 270 days.
Stanford is currently getting a 0.95 percent interest
rate on its tax-exempt paper.
The University typically uses debt to finance capital
improvement projects and other irregular outlays.
"When we go ahead with [a] capital project we iden
tify the source of the funding up front," Disch-Bhad
kamkar said. "Most of those projects receive a combi
nation of gift 112 unding and debt funding."
The University has issued commercial paper since
1992, but it was taxable. As a non-profit institution,
Stanford was eligible to seek authorization from the
state fora tax-exempt issue like it has done in the past
for long-term bonds. Eastern colleges like Harvard
and Princeton have in recent years
begun similar tax-exempt com
mercial paper programs, which
spurred the Stanford initiative.
"There was certainly some con
cern on how that works and what
the authority's role and responsi

bility would be — we had to have a
lot of discussions with bond counsel
and our own counsel, which is the
attorney general's office," Parting
ton said.
"The authority is just the con
duit issuer, the governmental enti
ty that issues the bonds for them.
We don't have a real active role, but
we do want to monitor that and see
how it goes just to make sure we
have a feel for it."

l)isch-Bhadkamkar explained
that, while not a huge break
through, the issue was a "mile
stone" and a positive step giving
the University more advanta
geous borrowing possibilities at a
time when it is facing budget
shortfalls.
For its part, the financial com
munity has reacted quite positively
to Stanford's move. Standard and
Poor's gave the paper an A-l rat

ing, and other outfits such as
Moody's (P-l) and Fitch Ratings
(F-l + ) also gave the bond top rat
ings.
"Our paper is in very high de
mand," said Disch-Bhadkamkar,
who added that the investors so far
have been tax-exempt mutual
funds like Citibank and Oppen
heimer.
"In order to protect the investor
we maintain a large portfolio of

cash [and other assets with high liq
uidity], and that's very highly
sought after by the mutual in
vestors," she said. The University
has ample liquidity to currently
and immediately cover all short
term debt obligations, according to
both the University and industry
sources.
Although Stanford's debt figure
is large, most of it is in fact not the
result of the current economic

downturn. Much of Stanford's cur
rent $1.25 billion debt is locked up
in 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year bonds
issued long ago.
"[The $150 million issue] will
hold us for about 18 months,"
Disch-Bhadkamkar said.
"Last year we issued only
about $50 million of new debt,
and the year before we issued
$150 million of new debt. It varies
on what our funding needs are."
