# Sophomore setter leads like senior

### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite being only a red-shirt
sophomore, stepping into the role
of co-captain of the No. 10 men's
volleyball team was a natural move
for setter Kevin Hansen.

Today: No. 10 Stanford at No. 6 Long
Beach State, 7:30 p.m.
Saturday: Stanford at UC-San Diego,
7 p.m.

"Being a [red-shirt sophomore]
co-captain is kind of different be
cause seniors usually take on a nat
ural leadership role," Hansen said.
According to the setter, his posi
tion on the volleyball court can be
compared to a combination of the
duties of athletes in other sports.
"Like a point guard in basket
ball, I am going for assists,"
Hansen said. "But also, like a quar
terback I sort of run offensive
plays."
Hansen's leadership can be
seen through his attitude toward
the game. Most people would
glance at the stat sheets and point
to the number of assists he has
racked up (1,021), but Hansen
cannot find an accurate statistic to
measure his individual perfor
mance.
"I think assists are kind of mis
leading," Hansen said. "You could
have a lot of assists, but hitters
could be hitting different percent
ages, so I kind of base my perfor
mance on the team's performance.
If we're winning, then I usually
feel like I'm doing a good job."
Because Hansen's biggest con
tributions to the team can't be seen
in the box scores, there is a lack of
glory associated with his position,
but he thrives on it.
"I feel like [being setter] is an
important job," Hansen said. "It
will go noticed if you're doing a
poor job and if you're doing a
good job, it usually goes unno
ticed. But I kind of like that in the
sense that I don't always have to be
in the limelight."
Hansen is the consummate
leader, putting team goals before
personal ones and maintaining a
cool presence on the court.
"Especially when we're down
and losing, I have to maintain
composure and keep the team fo

cused on the task at hand,"
Hansen said.
The leadership of the 6-foot-5
Newport Beach-native will be of
utmost importance when the Car
dinal takes on No. 6 Long Beach
St. (15-10 ,9-9 MPSF) on Friday
and UC-San Diego (5-18, 1-17
MPSF) on Saturday in two must
win matches in Southern Califor
nia.
The Cardinal currently sits in
seventh place in a conference
where only the top eight teams ad
vance to the playoffs.
Stanford has lost its two previous
matches against the 49ers, but was

without senior All-American oppo
site hitter Curt Toppel, who sat out
with a pulled abdominal muscle.
Toppel made his return to the
team last weekend and looks to be
even stronger in his third and
fourth matches back.
Against the 49ers, the Cardinal
has its work cut out for it.
"Last time, their middle block
ers kind of tore us up," Hansen
said. "They played really well and
had pretty good numbers. Specifi
cally, one of their players, Scott
Touzinsky, is a good outside hitter,
so we're definitely going to key in
on him."

Sophomore setter Kevin Hansen has tallied over 1,000 assists this season for the
No. 10 Stanford men's volleyball team, but his leadership as co-captain has
been just as instrumental to the Cardinal's success as the season winds down.
