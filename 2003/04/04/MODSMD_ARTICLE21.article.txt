# Softball battles Pac-10 foes
## Cardinal welcomes struggling Oregon and Oregon State for annual trip to the Farm 
### LEE INSINGA 
In a conference where seven of eight
teams are ranked in the top 25 nationally
and the other is receiving votes, one never
really gets a weekend off from tough com
petition.

Softball
Today: No. 13 Stanford vs. No. 21 Oregon, 7
p.m.
Saturday: Stanford vs. Oregon State, 7 p.m.

But coming off series against the nation's
top two teams in last weekend's homestand,
this weekend's slate against the Oregon
schools will be something of a break for the
No. 13 Cardinal (27-12)
Oregon and Oregon State have no such
luxury, however. After combining to drop
all six games at the Arizona schools last
weekend, they sit in seventh and eighth
place, respectively, and their task gets no
easier this weekend against Stanford and
California.
Still, the Oregonians should welcome
any change of scenery as each team only
managed to push one run across the plate
in their three games in Arizona.
The No. 21 Ducks (17-9) are first up for
the Cardinal tomorrow night. The Ducks
did some damage on the Farm in the teams'
last meeting, shutting out the Cardinal 4-0
in the final game of the 2002 regular sea
son.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Connie
McMurren, the author of that shutout and
one of the most talented Oregon pitchers of
recent memory, has since graduated.
The ace of this year's Oregon pitching
staff is senior Amy Harris. Harris* 6-6

record belies her excellence in the circle
thus far. A victim of suspect defense, Harris
has allowed more unearned runs, 12, than
earned runs (11).
Leading the Ducks at the plate are senior
third baseman Lindsey Haij and freshman
right fielder Beth Boskovich. The duo has
combined for almost a third of the Ducks
total hits this season.
The weekend's final two games will
come against Oregon State. The Beavers
(22-16) dropped out of the top 25 this past
week, but sit squarely at No. 26. Oregon
State will be looking for its first win on the
Farm since the 1999 season.
The Beavers' season began with a great
deal of promise — their 8-0 start stands as
the best in school history — but they have
been victimized by an offense that can let
them down at times. The Beavers have
scored one or no runs in 10 of their 16 loss
es.
Oregon State's offense relies on a pair of
talented seniors, catcher Shelly Prochaska
and second baseman Brynnen Guthrie.
Prochaska leads the team in batting, hitting
at a .380 clip and RBI, with 32. Guthrie is a
four-year starter, twice named honorable
mention All-Pacific-10 Conference.
I he Cardinal should expect the Beavers
to try to create havoc on the basepaths. Ore
gon State has stolen 48 bases this season,
four times as many as their opponents.
1 hat speed may meet its match, howev
er, in Stanford's junior catcher Jessica Allis
ter. Allister has thrown out an exceptional
57 percent of runners attempting to steal
thus far this year.
Starring in the circle for the Beavers is
junior Monica Hoffman. Hoffman made a
name for hersell last season in becoming
the first Oregon State pitcher to throw
three no-hitters in a season, one of them a
perfect game.
I his year 1 loffman's record stands at 16-
10 with opposing batters hitting
only .210 against her.
Harris and Hoffman should
provide a strong challenge fora
Cardinal offense that has been ei
ther feast or famine so far this sea
son.
The Cardinal has averaged less
than one run per game in their 12
losses, but almost live runs per
game when they've recorded a
win.
Recently, however, the Cardi
nal bats have heated up. Stanford
has scored 13 runs in its last three
games, including a big win over
No. 2 Washington.
Stanford's pitching staff , on the
other hand, has shown no lack of
consistency. Top starters junior
Dana Sorensen and senior Tori
Nyberg own miniscule 0.81 and

1.77 ERA respectively.
Stanford's most prolific hitters
thus far have, surprisingly, been its
freshmen. Shortstop Lauren
pin and center fielder Catalina
Morris are the team's top two bat
ters, hitting .353 and .330, respec
tively. Lappin performed especial
ly well against Washington, notch
ing three hits.
Stanford is currently in the mid
dle of a logjam for fourth place
in the conference at 1-2. The Car
dinal will need a strong showing
from their experienced aces and
newfound offensive stars to move
up the standings.
When your conference has
taken home 16 of the 21 NCAA
championships, even games
against the last-place teams can be
dangerous.
The Cardinal face off against
Oregon at 7 p.m. Friday and take
on the Beavers Saturday at 7 p.m.
and Sunday at 1 p.m. All games will
be held at Smith Family Stadium.
