### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
Meetings between the top two
ranked teams in any sport are al
ways fierce. One such showdown,
featuring some of the premier
matchups in women's collegiate
tennis, will take place this weekend
as the No. 2 Cardinal will take on
No. 1 Southern California and
No. 7 UCLA.

Women's Tennis
M —
Today: No. 2 Stanford at No. 1
USC, 1:30 p.m.
Saturday: Stanford at No. 7 UCLA,
12 p.m.

The non-conference away
matches will put Stanford's 11-
match winning streak to the test.
The Cardinal (13-1, 3-0 Pacific-10
Conference) will meet USC (17-1,
4-0) at 1:30 p.m. on Friday.
The Women ofTroy moved up
two places in the ITA team rank
ings this week on the heels of their
sweep of the Arizona schools that
pushed their winning streak to 12
matches. Their only loss was to
then-No. 2 Florida at the National
Team Indoors two months ago.
After Friday's match, Stanford
will venture to the Los Angeles
Tennis Center, where it will try to
stop the Bruins' current four
match winning streak at home.
Both Southern California
schools have built their success
around strong play from the top of
their lineups. Senior Jewel Peter
son, ranked No. 6 in the individual
polls, spearheads the formidable
USC attack, while the tandem of
senior Sara Walker, No. 10 over
all, and freshman Jackie Carleton,
No. 23 in the country, lead UCLA
(12-5,3-1).
USC's experience — four se
niors and two juniors bolster the
squad — make it especially dan
gerous, as Stanford will play only
one junior, Lauren Barnikow and
no seniors.

"[USC] is a veteran club so we
know what we have to deal with,"
Stanford coach Lele Forood said.
"UCLA has been playing well all
season in spite of a lot of injured
starters, which points out what a
deep team they are."
The USC tandem of Peterson
and senior Tiffany Brymer will
look to help snatch the doubles
point from the Cardinal on Fri
day, while UCLA's top team of
Carleton and freshman Feriel Es
seghir is no less of a challenge.
Nonetheless, Stanford feels
that its doubles teams are at the
top of their games and may have
the advantage. Barnikow and
sophomore partner Erin Bur
dette are ranked No. 2 in the na
tion and are communicating very
smoothly on the court.
The freshman pairing of Alice
Barnes and Amber Liu have been
consistently strong throughout
the season at No. 2 doubles, while
the No. 3 team of junior Emilia
Anderson and sophomore Story
Tweedie-Yates has been racking

up wins lately.
"The doubles is getting
stronger and stronger as the No. 2
and No. 3 pairs gain more experi
ence," Barnes said. "Both of these
pairs were new partnerships at the
beginning of the season and so it
took a little while to get to know
each other."
After playing five of their last six
matches on the Farm, the squad
will have to compete not only with
their opponents but also with an
unfamiliar environment and bi
ased crowd.
"The past two years, UCLA has
had some fans that heckled and
got into the match a little bit, and
the band came one time,"
Barnikow said.
Although Liu and Barnes have
never played diese two teams in
Los Angeles, Liu does not believe
that the environments will pose a
problem.
"I am from Los Angeles and
have actually grown up playing
