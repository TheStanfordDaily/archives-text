Peanut butter and jelly. Sonny

separable.

Senior All-Americans David Mar
tin and Scott lipsky have enjoyed dis
tinguished careers as singles players
since arriving at Stanford, but dieir
greatest successes have come as a
doubles team.
"If you asked me three or four
years ago if I thought they'd still be
playing with each other alter all this
time with their differences in person
ality, I would have said that that might
be a stretch," coach Dick Gould said.
"They're kind of an odd couple,
they're really so different. But they re
spect each other and accept each
other's differences. They're great
friends."
As sophomores, the unseeded
pair reached the semifinals of the
NCAA doubles championships, los
ing to eventual champions Matias
Boeker and Travis Parrot of Geor
gia. Last year, Lipsky and Martin
improved upon their previous re
sult by making it all the way to the
NCAA finals.
The duo lost a hard-fought three
set tide match 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 to Mark
Kovacs and Andrew Colombo of
Auburn.
As seniors, Martin and Lipsky
have continued to prove that they
deserve to be called one of the best
doubles pairs in the country.
They are currently ranked No. 4
in the nation. So far this year, they've
reached the finals and semifinals of
the two "Grand Slams" of college
tennis that take place dining die fall

tournament season.
"They might lose some matches
here and there, but they've been so
consistent," Gould said. 'They can
beat anybody. I would not bet against
them in any match."
What makes lipsky and Martin
such an outstanding doubles team?
"We compliment each other very
well in terms of our games," Lipsky
said. "I have the stronger serve and
Dave's got the better return. Mental
ly we compliment each odier as well.
Dave's the more straight-arrow and
I'm more of a fiery guy when we're
on the court. I help Dave get
pumped up and he helps me calm
down."
"Lip is so talented," Martin said.
"It seems like in any situation, he
has such good feel that he can hit
some kind of unorthodox shot that
can put our opponents off balance.
I'm the more straight-forward,
meat-and-potatoes type player. We
work well together."
Lipsky believes that he and Mar
tin's close friendship has also played a
factor in their success.
"Anytime you play doubles with
someone, you can't not like them and

be successful,"Lipsky said.
"Being friends and making each
other laugh in tense situations is a
bonus."
"We've become better friends
after playing with each other for the
last three years and we room with
each other on road trips," Martin
said. "We know each other really
well and like one another. I want to
do well and play well for him. But I
know we're going to be fnends re
gardless of whether we win or lose."
What will it take for Martin and
Lipsky to become the 14th doubles
team in Cardinal program history
to bring home a NCAA doubles
championship in May?
"For us to break through and win
NCAAs this year, it will take consis
tency," Lipsky said. "If we play as well
as we're capable, we definitely have a
chance of winning it."
Martin and Lipsky will be instru
mental in the Cardinal's two match
es this weekend. No. 7 Stanford (14-
2, 2-0 Pac-10) takes on defending
NCAA champion No. 22 Southern
California (12-6,1 -2) at 1:30 p.m. on
