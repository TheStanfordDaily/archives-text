# Candidates hit up White Plaza
## 
### ERIC ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
White Plaza buzzed with the sounds of poli
tics yesterday at noon as this year's contenders
tor class offices, special tees and the ASSU exec
utive and Senate sought to convince students to
support their cause in next week's elections.
With vote-getting gimmicks from banjo per
formances to powdered donuts with cigarettes
inserted, from free candy to "advice fora quar
ter," or just the classic two-hand handshake, the
energetic campaigners worked the crowd.
"We really hope that as many people as pos
sible will come out and vote," said Elections
Commissioner Eleanor Williams, a junior.
"The candidates have put in a lot of work, given
a really short period of time. A really high per
centage of slates are here. I'm seeing a pretty
good turnout.
"This whole process really makes a defer
ence in how much say students have in what
happens on campus," she continued. "To name
a few issues that elected students work on: im
proving laundry services; where you can use
your points on campus; getting your internet
bill on the quarterly bill instead of a monthly
bills; and processes for student groups working
with the Office of Student Activities."
With widely differing platforms and meth
ods for presenting them, members of the two
slates running for president and vice-president
of ASSU reflected on the day.
"Out of all the aspects of campaigning, I
enjoy this the most — meeting people," said ju
nior Nadiya Figueroa, who is running for
ASSU President with sophomore Joey Natoli.
"It's important that candidates aren't just on
paper or Web sites, but are out there face-to
face with students. We're having fun doing
this"
While Figueroa and Natoli both used the
meet-and-greet approach, their opposition, the

presidential hopeful Steve Yelderman with
vice-president Charlie Stockman, both juniors,
decided to divide forces. Yelderman met-and
greeted; Stockman used a variety of tactics to at
tract voters by promoting his slate with a loud
speaker and pouring beer on himself.
"I think a lot of candidates are here talking
about accountability," Stockman said. "I'm
here to bring gross irresponsibility. If I get
elected, I'm throwing a dope party at Sue
Wais's house. BYOB."
Sophomore Michael Brown 11, a current
ASSU senator, reflected on campaigning.
"The campaign process is somewhat gruel
ing— getting your name out there, meeting
people," he said. "But the Senate experience is

definitely worth it. I really do believe that stu
dents pay attention to candidate's platforms
and what the candidates put in their personal
statements."
While more low-key than some of the ASSU
candidates, many applicants from among the
over 60 groups requesting special fees made
their presence felt, from selling artwork to per
forming music.
"While there are mostly undergraduates out
here today, there are also graduate student
elections — they can vote for GSC representa
tives who work on issues like health care and
housing," Williams added. "All students vote
for special fees bills. There's a lot of graduate
students who don't know that."
