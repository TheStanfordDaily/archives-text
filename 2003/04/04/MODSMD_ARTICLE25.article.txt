### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In effort to reach out to the Last
Palo Alto community, the Haas
Center for Public Service and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon are hosting
the first annual 5K Fun
Run / Walk.
Because the event is underwrit
ten by the University as well as
sponsors such as Whole Foods,
100 percent of all the entry fees
will go to benefit the East Palo Alto
YMCA, which, according to Fun
Run coordinator Jeb C)ry, a service
fellow at the Ilaas Center, "is in the
capital-raising stage right now."
Pre-registration for the race be
gins at 8 a.m. and the race starts at
9 a.m. in Stanford Stadium.
"We've modified a University
course for the race, and it should
end around 10:30," Ory said.
"Our goal is to have everything
spill over to Community Day."
Race participants will be en
tered into a raffle for prizes such as
free pizzas at Pizza My Heart, an

overnight stay in a deluxe room at
the Stanford Park Hotel and a free
horseback riding lesson, courtesy
of the Texas Club. Winners of the
race will receive medals.
"We're hoping for about 200
participants and $5,000 for the Y,"
Ory said. "But realistically, I think
we hope to raise $2,500. Commu
nity members pay more [than stu
dents], and a lot of it depends on
last minute entries, which is when
most people sign up for races like
these."
The East Palo Alto YMCA, a
member of the YMCA of the Mid-
Peninsula, is currently holding a
$13 million capital campaign to
build and endow a 37,000-square
foot community facility which will
include a wellness center, gymna
siums, and computer laboratories
with after-school study groups and
child care.
"The YMCA is an important
part of people's lives, yet East Palo
Alto doesn't have one. We've been
given a great opportunity to help
them," Ory said.
