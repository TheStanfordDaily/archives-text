Though they might be seen as
ASSU insiders, executive office candi
dates junior Nadiya Figueroa and
sophomore Joey Natoli say that their
campaign is certainly not limited by
their ASSU experience.
"I was worried about the in-the-box
thinking, sort of if we'll be trapped in
the ASSU mentality, so we want to
make sure we include many, many
group leaders," said Natoli, the vice
presidential candidate. "We'll ensure
that this in-the-box thinking won't be
possible. We'll be constantly looking
for feedback."
Figueroa, the presidential candi
date, added, "And having a really di-

Figueroa noted, however, that their

aide — should "appeal to voters."
"In one sense, it's necessary to
have experience," she said. "We
spoke at length with Monica [Hen
estroza] and Matt [Brewer] about
this, and Monica had not had ex
perience, and she would say
there's a learning curve."
Besides her work with the
ASSU, Figueroa also has been in
volved with the Black Community
Student Center initiative, the cre
ation of the cultural awareness ad
viser residential staff position, the
Caribbean Students Association
and the Kuumba dance ensemble.
Natoli is currendy serving as the
president of the Stanford News
Readership Program.
Both said that they would be
willing to devote the necessary
time to the position if elected.
"We both believe we need to
fully commit ourselves to the job,"
Natoli said.

"Hopefully I'll still be able to
dance, but I'm willing to throw it
out if I have to," Figueroa said.
As far as specific issues,
Figueroa and Natoli hope to ad
dress student space, diversity is
sues, cost-of-living, the arts com
munity and student groups as a
whole. Another major goal, as Na
toli said, is "bringing historically
uninvolved communities into the
ASSU, such as the Greek commu
nity, art community, athletic com
munity, ethnic communities and
frosh."
"I think our slogan relatively
well sums up how we feel, it's em
powering student voice," he said.
Adding more detail, Figueroa
cited the idea of creating "separate
endowments for community cen
ters and seeking funding from
alumni of color."
She also discussed forming a
coalition of arts groups to give
them more collective power.
When asked to describe their
platform in a few words, Figueroa
and Natoli said that it's genuine,
holistic, ambitious and well-re

searched.
"All of our Stanford experi
ences are sort of built into our plat
form," Figueroa said.
Another key characteristic they
cited was vision.
"We're sort of looking towards
the long-term," Natoli said. "We'd
work on sort of setting into the
ASSU culture that we're not look
ing in our term, we're looking five,
10 years out."
"There's a continuity we're try
ing to achieve," Figueroa said.
As far as her leadership style,
Figueroa said she tries to be per
sonable.
"I think it's important that any
one who has an issue would be
able to approach me and say,
'Nadiya, I don't even know who
you are but I want to talk to you,' "
she said.
Though Figueroa and Natoli
come from somewhat different
backgrounds, they see that as a
strength.
"Our different experiences sort
of help complement one another,"
Natoli said.
