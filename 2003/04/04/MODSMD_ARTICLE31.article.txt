# Rock, Mac stick to stand-up

### ED SCOTT 
As I drove into San Francisco for the
premiere of "Head of State" at the Me
treon, the sky was full of helicopters, the
streets were full of bike protesters flash
ing the peace sign, and the sidewalks
were full of police in riot gear warily ob
serving the scene. All of these images
could have been pulled directly out of a

highly politicized Hollywood block-

buster, a film which would
tackle the issues of the day \
in a manner both dramatic
and substantive.
A film, in short, other
than "Head of State." Chris
Rock plays Mays Gilliam, an
alderman in a rough Wash
ington, D.C. neighborhood
so dangerous that you can

"get shot while you are getting shot."
Mays is a devoted public advocate who
gets the attention of the leadership of an
unnamed political party when he saves
one of his constituents (and her cat) from
a government-sanctioned building de
molition gone awry. Have you seen the
original "Rocky," the one where Apollo
Creed picks a random pug to fight him
for the heavyweight championship?
Creed expects a good show, but he never
imagines that the Italian Stallion will pose

a real threat.
In "Head of State,"the fight is for the
presidency of the United States. Mays is
picked to replace a recently deceased can
didate in a campaign against the heavily
favored incumbent vice president. The
party higher-ups who choose Mays have
already conceded the election — they just
want to use Mays to garner minority sup-

port for the mainstream candi
dates they will run in the fu
ture.

Confused, concerned, indig-

nant? Don't spend a whole
lot of time thinking this
through, since Rock and co
writer Ali Leßoi certainly
haven't. The movie is not
about the plot or the politics.
It's about the jokes. The act
ing is devoid of any subtlety,

and the direction of first-timer Rock fre
quently suffers from a lack of vision and
planning. I often felt like I was watching
a dress rehearsal fora product that's not
quite finished.
Still, when Mays sheds the orders of his
staid party advisers and selects his older
brother Mitch (Bernie Mac) as his run
ning mate, the laughs (and the poll num
bers) really begin to fly. Mitch is a partic
ularly effective character, trading both
barbs and beatings with his younger

brother while also encouraging him to
"speak the truth." The best parts of the
movie come when Rock and Mac turn oft
the teleprompter and slide into the irrev
erent stand-up style that made them fa
mous.
Mays and Mitch Gilliam are not char
acters in and of themselves, after all. They
merely serve as conduits for the Chris
Rock and Bernie Mac personas we have
seen on HBO, Comedy Central and"The
Original Kings of Comedy." The plot and

acting may disappoint, but the jokes hit
home when the actors shake off' the con
straints of convention.
If you're looking for bike protests or a
cohesive commentary on the current state
of political affairs, then go join the crowd
in San Francisco. If you've ever wondered
what rich white political donors might
look like doing a funkified electric slide,
or thought of the United States as "a big
titty woman," then "Head of State"
should get your vote.



"A movie about politics? Yeah, right!"
