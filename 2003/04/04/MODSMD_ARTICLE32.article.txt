# Author Boyle tunes in, turns on, drops out

### ANNA NORTH 
The '60s are over. What's more, '60s retro
is over: Lava lamps and bell bottoms have
had their resurgence and sunk back into the
cultural swamp. In fact, even deconstructing
'60s retro is old hat these days. After a 12-
hour miniseries and innumerable books and
movies, we no longer need to be told that
communes weren't the paradises they set out
to be.
Beginning "Drop City" with this in mind,
I wondered how T.C. Boyle could find any
thing new to say on the subject. And he
doesn't. His opening chapters show us that
hippies were dirty (no!), drugged out
(never!) and irresponsible (horrors!). New
ground this is decidedly not.
But Boyle has done a remarkable thing:
He's taken a group of 24 people — the resi
dents of the Bay Area commune Drop City
— and fleshed them out in such a way that
we care about them even when they're keep
ing their kids quiet by spiking the Kool-Aid
with acid.
An ensemble cast is harder to pull off in
a novel than it is in a movie, and Boyle
does it effortlessly. Even the rabid feminist
who talks so much everyone calls her Ver
bie takes on some humanity by the end.
And his heroine, Star, is convincing as a
woman coping with moral, sexual and po
litical uncertainty.
Boyle is at his best when he allows all his
creations to bounce off one another. A
group of vegetarian women sharing an il
licit snack of deviled ham in the back of a
bus, two Berkeley professors interviewing
a stoned hippie about his family problems
- "Drop City" is worth reading for scenes

like these alone.
It's when the plot gets going that the
novel runs into trouble. Faced with eviction,
Drop City is forced to move north — all the
way to Alaska.
They move into a tiny cabin next door
to hardened fur trapper Sess Harder and
his wife Pamela, whom he has just married
after three days' acquaintance. Winter's

fast approaching — will the hippies sur
vive on their own, or will they have to de
pend on their neighbors when the cold
sets in?
Throwing the Harders together with
Drop City should force some interesting
conflicts between two opposing ways of life,
similar in their goals yet very different in
their methods — to renounce the nine-to

five grind and get close to nature. Call it
trapping versus tripping.
Trouble is, these conflicts never material
ize. Instead we get uneasy alliances. It's no
surprise that Pamela, starved for female
companionship, and Star, more reflective
than the other hippies, become friends.
What is surprising is that the questions they
share — questions about how to lead a life
that is both morally and emotionally satisfy
ing— remain unanswered and largely
undiscussed.
Perhaps Boyle's point is that these ques
tions are unanswerable, that neither the hip
pies nor the Hai ders have hit on the perfect
lifestyle. That the best we can do is take what
life throws at us and try to adapt — as Sess
says, "let it stir, let it settle again."
Still, the novel has a vaguely unfinished
quality. Star's relationship with the thought
ful Marco, for instance, the focal point of the
first half of the book, dwindles to almost
nothing by the end. The pair seem to have
no scenes alone together after page 200. And
the moral ramifications of a murder remain
largely unexplored.
"She was confident," says Boyle of
Pamela, "confident in a way Star never had
been, and that was something to aim for."
But perhaps Boyle needs some of Pamela's
confidence too, enough to push his charac
ters past the limits of uncertainty. They are
certainly up to the challenge.


Is it just me, or is this guy channeling his inner Tim Burton?
