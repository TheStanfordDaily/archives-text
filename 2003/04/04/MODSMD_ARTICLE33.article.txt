# Life after 'The Hours’: Stanford alumnus Michael Cunningham talks about Hollywood and his future
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH 
There are still the flowers to buy Clarissa feigns
exasperation (though she loves doing errands
like this), leaves Sally cleaning the bathroom,
and runs out, promising to be back in half an
hour. It is New York City It is the end of the
twentieth century
— "The Hours, " by Michael Cunningham
Michael Cunningham finishes a cigarette. The 50-year
old author steps in the kitchen of his apartment, with a tele
phone in his hand and reporters on the other end of the
line.
It is New York City. It is the beginning of the twenty-first
century, a year in which Michael Cunningham has achieved
more notoriety than he could have ever imagined for him
self.
His fourth novel "The Hours," the winner of the Pulitzer
Prize, has been made into a film. And not just any film, but
one that stars three of the most accomplished actresses of his
time — Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.
Cunningham is humble about success.
"Neither I nor my editor thought it was going to be a hit,"
Cunningham says in the telephone interview. "We all
thought it was going to be my arty little book that would sell
a few thousand of copies and then retire as gracefully as it
could."
But it was not received that way. "The Hours" was one of
the best-reviewed novels of 1998. The Los Angeles Times
called it "an exquisitely written, kaleidoscopic work." And
USA Today gushed: "[lt's] a smashing literary tour de
force."
The book sold, and sold and sold — more than 2 million
copies to date. It topped the bestseller's list of The New
York Times and still remains on that list.
"It proves you can write an unorthodox book and find a
readership for it," Cunningham says.
The novel follows three women, in three separate story
lines.
The first takes place after World War I, as British novel
ist Virginia Woolf begins work on her novel, "Mrs. Dal
loway." The second takes place after World War 11, when a
housewife named Laura Brown begins to read "Mrs. Dal
loway" on the morning of her husband's birthday. And the
final story takes place in modern times; an editor named
Clarissa Vaughn is planning a party fora friend dying of
AIDS, who renamed her Mrs. Dalloway.
To get inside the head of his characters, Cunningham re
lied on dense narratives that oppose theatricality. But after
the novel won the Pulitzer in 1999, veteran British play
wright David Hare was hired to adapt the screenplay with
Cunningham as an adviser.
"I have such a clear idea of my characters that I felt that
they had to play themselves," Cunningham says. "Who
would play your mother in the story of her life? Your
mother. If that movie gets made and you discover Susan
Sarandon is going to play your mother, you adjust ac
cordingly."
So far, in release since January, the film has gained as
much acclaim as its source — named the top film of last year
by the National Board of Review and the Foreign Press As
sociation. It also earned nine Academy Award nominations,
although Michael Cunningham does not know this yet be
cause on this afternoon in early February, the hours have

aligned so that the information has yet to be revealed to the
world.

It is Los Angeles. It is IQ4Q.
Laura Brown is trying to lose herself. No,
that's not it exactly-she is trying to keep herself
by gaining entry into a parallel world.
Michael Cunningham was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in
1952. He grew up in an upper class Republican suburb of
Los Angeles. He'd later use the scene as a backdrop for one
of the story lines of "The Hours."
Fantasies of becoming a rock star endured throughout
boyhood. That was his goal, a world where lyricism was
achieved through the music ofjimi Hendrix.
He went to the movies regularly, as often as he could.
The stories were addictive. He saw Stanley Kubrick's "2001:
A Space Odyssey" at least 35 times — in many cases, stoned
out of his mind.
But then, in college, he found a calling. He found two
teachers who moved him. He found the inspiration to be
come a storyteller.
"That's when I knew I wanted to try to write," he says."I
didn't say I wanted to be a writer. It felt too presumptuous.
But since then, I've never lost interest in creating something
that feels like life on paper."
He made his way to Stanford in 1973. John L'Heureux
had just begun his creative writing professorship at the uni
versity. A Boston native, he was surprised by the rambunc
tious, liberated group of Californians who enrolled in his
classes. One of them was Michael Cunningham.
He stood out.

"I was one of his first teachers," L'Heureux says."He was
gifted, and you could see that immediately."
For one of his assignments, Cunningham turned in a
short story that didn't have an ending. He wasn't ready to
finish it.
"I told him to skip the next assignment and start a novel,"
L'Heureux says."He brought me the beginning and it was
splendid, and I remember telling him. He almost dissolved
into tears."
The second instructor who inspired him was novelist
and Prof. Emeritus Nancy Packer. He enrolled in her leg
endary lecture course on the development of the short
story, with about 80 other students.
"Packer's course... was the definitive experience in my
education and a turning point in my life," Cunningham
wrote in the alumni publication Stanford Magazine in 1996.
"I entered it as an agonized, confused junior journalism
major; I left 10 weeks later as agonized, confused aspiring
fiction writer."
And he was challenged. Packer found one of his papers
on Katherine Mansfield to be "less than perfect," according

to Cunningham. He went to her office hours to demand an
explanation.
What he received in return was a lesson in writing.
"112 do remember him, but only vaguely, as a tall, hand
some young man who was part of an exceptionally interest
ing set of students," Packer says.
Michael Cunningham would graduate from Stanford
the next year. He would abandon the novel he started. He
would move to San Francisco where he lived fora time as a
hippie.
Later, he received a master's of line arts from the Universi
ty of lowa. He wrote for The New Yorker. He published his
first novel to good reviews but mild sales. Then two more nov
els that remained in print: "A Home at the End of the World"
and "Flesh and Blood." And, at last, the time would be ripe for
Michael Cunningham to start work on "The Hours."

It is a suburb of London. It is 1Q23.
Virginia awakens. This might be another
way to begin, certainly; with Clarissa going on
an errand on a day in June, instead of soldiers
marching off to lay the wreath in Whitehall. But
is it the right beginning? Is it a little too ordi
nary?
It started as a different novel. Michael Cunningham,
who is openly gay, wanted to write a new version of "Mrs.
Dalloway" as a day in the life of a 52-year-old gay man,
preparing fora party.
"Virginia Woolfwas the first great writer I ever read," he
says."I read her in high school when I wasn't much inter
ested in books. But I could see the sentences and the densi
ty and complexity, and she was doing with language some
thing that Jimi Hendrix does with the guitar. It thrilled me
like no other language like that thrilled me."
Yet his draft stalled. There already was the original ver
sion of "Mrs. Dalloway." Cunningham didn't see the neces
sity fora new story. He almost abandoned the idea.
And then ... he was inspired to put Woolf herself in the
book.
She picks up her pen.
A third story line would be added later, based on his
mother.
Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.
To do research for the novel, he spent almost a year
reading through books of criticism on the British novelist.
He read volumes of Woolf s diary entries. He wanted to
summon her spirit. He wanted to put it down on paper.
"I don't know another author who wrote so persuasively
of the joys of being alive," Cunningham says. "She left an
optimism that provides."
The book has sparked a resurgence of interest in the life
and literature of Virginia Woolf. For the first time since it
was published in 1925, "Mrs. Dalloway" has topped best
seller lists.
But not all the reaction is positive. Some Woolf scholars
are furious with the portrayal, and claim that it glorifies
Woolf s suicide and depression for melodramatic effect.
Diane Middlebrook is one of them.
"I was so turned off by the opening pages [where] Vir
ginia Woolf drowns herself , I stopped reading," says Mid
dlebrook, a professor emeritus in the Stanford English de
partment. Middlebrook taught two of Woolf s novels in her
Literature of Transformation I-Hum class.
But Cunningham is not easily deterred by criticism. He
has received it before; he knows he will receive it again.
The author is now working on a screenplay to "A Home
at the End of the World," which is set to begin production
next year with Colin Farrell attached to star. He has also
started a new novel, but he says that nothing he can write
will receive the same acclaim as "The Hours."
"It's all downhill from here," he says, with a laugh. "I ac
tually struggled with that fora while, and then I decided,
well, if everybody is going to hate the next book I write, then
I'm free to write it."


Great profile, and his nose is real.

Michael Cunningham was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in
1952. He grew up in an upper class Republican suburb of
Los Angeles. He'd later use the scene as a backdrop for one
of the story lines of "The Hours."
Fantasies of becoming a rock star endured throughout
boyhood. That was his goal, a world where lyricism was
achieved through the music ofjimi Hendrix.
He went to the movies regularly, as often as he could.
The stories were addictive. He saw Stanley Kubrick's "2001:
A Space Odyssey" at least 35 times — in many cases, stoned
out of his mind.
But then, in college, he found a calling. He found two
teachers who moved him. He found the inspiration to be
come a storyteller.
"That's when I knew I wanted to try to write," he says."I
didn't say I wanted to be a writer. It felt too presumptuous.
But since then, I've never lost interest in creating something
that feels like life on paper."
He made his way to Stanford in 1973. John L'Heureux
had just begun his creative writing professorship at the uni
versity. A Boston native, he was surprised by the rambunc
tious, liberated group of Californians who enrolled in his
classes. One of them was Michael Cunningham.
He stood out.

"I was one of his first teachers," L'Heureux says."He was
gifted, and you could see that immediately."
For one of his assignments, Cunningham turned in a
short story that didn't have an ending. He wasn't ready to
finish it.
"I told him to skip the next assignment and start a novel,"
L'Heureux says."He brought me the beginning and it was
splendid, and I remember telling him. He almost dissolved
into tears."
The second instructor who inspired him was novelist
and Prof. Emeritus Nancy Packer. He enrolled in her leg
endary lecture course on the development of the short
story, with about 80 other students.
"Packer's course... was the definitive experience in my
education and a turning point in my life," Cunningham
wrote in the alumni publication Stanford Magazine in 1996.
"I entered it as an agonized, confused junior journalism
major; I left 10 weeks later as agonized, confused aspiring
fiction writer."
And he was challenged. Packer found one of his papers
on Katherine Mansfield to be "less than perfect," according

to Cunningham. He went to her office hours to demand an
explanation.
What he received in return was a lesson in writing.
"112 do remember him, but only vaguely, as a tall, hand
some young man who was part of an exceptionally interest
ing set of students," Packer says.
Michael Cunningham would graduate from Stanford
the next year. He would abandon the novel he started. He
would move to San Francisco where he lived fora time as a
hippie.
Later, he received a master's of line arts from the Universi
ty of lowa. He wrote for The New Yorker. He published his
first novel to good reviews but mild sales. Then two more nov
els that remained in print: "A Home at the End of the World"
and "Flesh and Blood." And, at last, the time would be ripe for
Michael Cunningham to start work on "The Hours."

It is a suburb of London. It is 1Q23.
Virginia awakens. This might be another
way to begin, certainly; with Clarissa going on
an errand on a day in June, instead of soldiers
marching off to lay the wreath in Whitehall. But
is it the right beginning? Is it a little too ordi
nary?
It started as a different novel. Michael Cunningham,
who is openly gay, wanted to write a new version of "Mrs.
Dalloway" as a day in the life of a 52-year-old gay man,
preparing fora party.
"Virginia Woolfwas the first great writer I ever read," he
says."I read her in high school when I wasn't much inter
ested in books. But I could see the sentences and the densi
ty and complexity, and she was doing with language some
thing that Jimi Hendrix does with the guitar. It thrilled me
like no other language like that thrilled me."
Yet his draft stalled. There already was the original ver
sion of "Mrs. Dalloway." Cunningham didn't see the neces
sity fora new story. He almost abandoned the idea.
And then ... he was inspired to put Woolf herself in the
book.
She picks up her pen.
A third story line would be added later, based on his
mother.
Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.
To do research for the novel, he spent almost a year
reading through books of criticism on the British novelist.
He read volumes of Woolf s diary entries. He wanted to
summon her spirit. He wanted to put it down on paper.
"I don't know another author who wrote so persuasively
of the joys of being alive," Cunningham says. "She left an
optimism that provides."
The book has sparked a resurgence of interest in the life
and literature of Virginia Woolf. For the first time since it
was published in 1925, "Mrs. Dalloway" has topped best
seller lists.
But not all the reaction is positive. Some Woolf scholars
are furious with the portrayal, and claim that it glorifies
Woolf s suicide and depression for melodramatic effect.
Diane Middlebrook is one of them.
"I was so turned off by the opening pages [where] Vir
ginia Woolf drowns herself , I stopped reading," says Mid
dlebrook, a professor emeritus in the Stanford English de
partment. Middlebrook taught two of Woolf s novels in her
Literature of Transformation I-Hum class.
But Cunningham is not easily deterred by criticism. He
has received it before; he knows he will receive it again.
The author is now working on a screenplay to "A Home
at the End of the World," which is set to begin production
next year with Colin Farrell attached to star. He has also
started a new novel, but he says that nothing he can write
will receive the same acclaim as "The Hours."
"It's all downhill from here," he says, with a laugh. "I ac
tually struggled with that fora while, and then I decided,
well, if everybody is going to hate the next book I write, then
I'm free to write it."


Great profile, and his nose is real.
There are still the flowers to buy Clarissa feigns
exasperation (though she loves doing errands
like this), leaves Sally cleaning the bathroom,
and runs out, promising to be back in half an
hour. It is New York City It is the end of the
twentieth century
— "The Hours, " by Michael Cunningham
Michael Cunningham finishes a cigarette. The 50-year
old author steps in the kitchen of his apartment, with a tele
phone in his hand and reporters on the other end of the
line.
It is New York City. It is the beginning of the twenty-first
century, a year in which Michael Cunningham has achieved
more notoriety than he could have ever imagined for him
self.
His fourth novel "The Hours," the winner of the Pulitzer
Prize, has been made into a film. And not just any film, but
one that stars three of the most accomplished actresses of his
time — Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.
Cunningham is humble about success.
"Neither I nor my editor thought it was going to be a hit,"
Cunningham says in the telephone interview. "We all
thought it was going to be my arty little book that would sell
a few thousand of copies and then retire as gracefully as it
could."
But it was not received that way. "The Hours" was one of
the best-reviewed novels of 1998. The Los Angeles Times
called it "an exquisitely written, kaleidoscopic work." And
USA Today gushed: "[lt's] a smashing literary tour de
force."
The book sold, and sold and sold — more than 2 million
copies to date. It topped the bestseller's list of The New
York Times and still remains on that list.
"It proves you can write an unorthodox book and find a
readership for it," Cunningham says.
The novel follows three women, in three separate story
lines.
The first takes place after World War I, as British novel
ist Virginia Woolf begins work on her novel, "Mrs. Dal
loway." The second takes place after World War 11, when a
housewife named Laura Brown begins to read "Mrs. Dal
loway" on the morning of her husband's birthday. And the
final story takes place in modern times; an editor named
Clarissa Vaughn is planning a party fora friend dying of
AIDS, who renamed her Mrs. Dalloway.
To get inside the head of his characters, Cunningham re
lied on dense narratives that oppose theatricality. But after
the novel won the Pulitzer in 1999, veteran British play
wright David Hare was hired to adapt the screenplay with
Cunningham as an adviser.
"I have such a clear idea of my characters that I felt that
they had to play themselves," Cunningham says. "Who
would play your mother in the story of her life? Your
mother. If that movie gets made and you discover Susan
Sarandon is going to play your mother, you adjust ac
cordingly."
So far, in release since January, the film has gained as
much acclaim as its source — named the top film of last year
by the National Board of Review and the Foreign Press As
sociation. It also earned nine Academy Award nominations,
although Michael Cunningham does not know this yet be
cause on this afternoon in early February, the hours have

aligned so that the information has yet to be revealed to the
world.

It is Los Angeles. It is IQ4Q.

marching off to lay the wreath in Whitehall. But
is it the right beginning? Is it a little too ordi
nary?
It started as a different novel. Michael Cunningham,
who is openly gay, wanted to write a new version of "Mrs.
Dalloway" as a day in the life of a 52-year-old gay man,
preparing fora party.
"Virginia Woolfwas the first great writer I ever read," he
says."I read her in high school when I wasn't much inter
ested in books. But I could see the sentences and the densi
ty and complexity, and she was doing with language some
thing that Jimi Hendrix does with the guitar. It thrilled me
like no other language like that thrilled me."
Yet his draft stalled. There already was the original ver
sion of "Mrs. Dalloway." Cunningham didn't see the neces
sity fora new story. He almost abandoned the idea.
And then ... he was inspired to put Woolf herself in the
book.
She picks up her pen.
A third story line would be added later, based on his
mother.
Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.
To do research for the novel, he spent almost a year
reading through books of criticism on the British novelist.
He read volumes of Woolf s diary entries. He wanted to
summon her spirit. He wanted to put it down on paper.
"I don't know another author who wrote so persuasively
of the joys of being alive," Cunningham says. "She left an
optimism that provides."
The book has sparked a resurgence of interest in the life
and literature of Virginia Woolf. For the first time since it
was published in 1925, "Mrs. Dalloway" has topped best
seller lists.
But not all the reaction is positive. Some Woolf scholars
are furious with the portrayal, and claim that it glorifies
Woolf s suicide and depression for melodramatic effect.
Diane Middlebrook is one of them.
"I was so turned off by the opening pages [where] Vir
ginia Woolf drowns herself , I stopped reading," says Mid
dlebrook, a professor emeritus in the Stanford English de
partment. Middlebrook taught two of Woolf s novels in her
Literature of Transformation I-Hum class.
But Cunningham is not easily deterred by criticism. He
has received it before; he knows he will receive it again.
The author is now working on a screenplay to "A Home
at the End of the World," which is set to begin production
next year with Colin Farrell attached to star. He has also
started a new novel, but he says that nothing he can write
will receive the same acclaim as "The Hours."
"It's all downhill from here," he says, with a laugh. "I ac
tually struggled with that fora while, and then I decided,
well, if everybody is going to hate the next book I write, then
I'm free to write it."


Great profile, and his nose is real.
