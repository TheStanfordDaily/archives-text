# Chris Rock discusses the state of the nation
## 
### ED SCOTT 
I arrived at the Gift Hotel on Geary a
few minutes before I was supposed to
meet with Chris Rock. I sat down in the
lobby and took in the hodgepodge of fur,
teak, mood lighting and waitresses in
black coctail dresses emerging from hid
den doors. Outside, the sun was still
bright and the city was loud with protests,
traffic and life. Inside, gloom pervaded,
and hotel guests and visitors stunted their
conversations and enthusiasm to match
the ultra-cool and ultra-reserved decor.
Clearly, this was a place that was trying
too hard to be hip. Chris proved to be the
exact opposite of his accomodations. In
town to promote his new movie "Head of
State" (see review on page 3), Chris burst
into a conference room on the 30th floor
with no fanfare and immediately shook
my hand and introduced himself. He was
wearing a blue V-neck sweater beneath a
slick black blazer, and he looked even
skinnier than he does on screen. Rock
had a lot to say about his movie, but he
also spoke candidly about politics, hip
hop and the ethnicity of Jesus.
INTERMISSION: I like your directing
style. Who are your directing influences?
CHRIS ROCK: Woody Allen, Baz
Luhrman; I like busy [style] — I like it
busy. Kevin Smith [is an influence], in a
weird way.
INT: What's the creative process for
something like this?
CR: You get an idea, you sit down and
you write a treatment. That takes a
month to write a good one. Once the
treatment is done you start writing the
script. Then you sell. Start going to the
studios and knocking on doors.
INT: Did you stick to the script in the
movie? It seems like there is some im
prov.
CR: We added stuff There were some
scenes where we said, "we could use a
joke right here."
INT: What are you looking for in the
casting process as the director of a film?

CR: It's like a football team or a basketball
team. Who's going to shoot, who's going
to play so-and-so. Everyone can't be
fimny, so you gotta know where your
funny characters are going to come from.
Once you get that you're set. You just
need some really good actors. They're
very important to have.
INT: This is obviously a very relevant
film, especially since there is so much con
troversy over our current president. How
important is relevance in your films?
CR: I mean ... it's weird. It's important
when I'm doing stand-up, because you
have all this shit going on, and you're like,
"Hey! Reagan's not president anymore."
It's like doing Clinton jokes when Bush
has been president for almost four years.
In movies it's hard. It's just a weird coin
cidence that we're at war and people are

kinda saying "God bless America,"and
nowhere else ... You would hope that,
just in a world of "Jackass," that people
are a little intelligent — I mean, I'm not
preachy — I like "Jackass," but I hope

there's room for something else.
INT: In this time of war how do you keep
things so fimny, and does the war affect
your sense of humor?
CR: I don't know if I'm so funny...
[laughs]. I mean, there's always a war
somewhere, you know it's just not OUR
guys dying. There's always some terrible
thing going on. If you look at a year ago
today, you'll find the same thing going on
someplace else in the world. Or last week
even. Someone else was getting bombed
and we weren't even paying attention to
it.
INT: Why did you want to write this type
of movie?
CR: No one is going to write this for me.
The average movie for me is some ver
sion of "Bringing Down the House"

where I'm an ex-convict or whatever, or I
change into some old lady; whatever the
fuck it is. No one's going to write a movie
where I'm the president and my girl
friend helps me out. That's not written
fora black guy, so I gotta do it myself.
INT: Is it worth it to go to all of these
press junkets and talk to major media
outlets like college newspapers?
CR: I think it's worth it. Plus you guys —
I talk to the college kids and all that —
who's going to be running shit in 10 years
— it's you. And then you'll go "Hey,
Chris Rock was a nice guy." And you'll cut
me some slack when my boat trip comes
out.
INT: It seemed like in "Head of State"
there was a specific effort not to name the
parties — the party that you were run
ning for, etc.
CR: Well, you know, I don't think there's
that much difference in the parties. And
why piss off half the country? I'm already
a minority so you're already trying to
crossover. You're already trying to mar
ket this to everybody so why go and pick
a party. It's rough.

INT: What's your ideal president?
CR: Like what I said: How can you help
the poor if you've never been poor? How
can you implement drug policy if you
claim to not know anybody or that you've
"never done it," or known anyone who's
sold drugs? You know, I've been poor,
I've done drugs, I known individuals
who've sold drugs, I know criminals.
INT: So who would it be?
CR: I don't know. Oprah would be a
good president. She admits to her faults
and cleanses herself. She can figure it out.
INT: I saw "Dogma" the other night...
Is Jesus really black?
CR: In the Bible he is kinda described as
black, so I mean, he's kinda bronze. I
mean, he is from a "black" part of the
world. It kinda makes SENSE. He looked
more like Bob Marley than [Bee Gees
lead singer] Barry Gibb .
INT: Have you ever stolen a joke?
CR: No. I never stole a joke. No, no. I
stole a joke one time. It wasn't even a
steal. I watched George Wallace one
night and at one club, four weeks into
being a comedian.
INT: How did you get all those people to
line dance (elderly people dancing to
Nelly's "Hot in Herre" and other rap
songs)?
CR: They were all professional dancers.
They have old professional dancers. We
had a hip-hop choreographer come in
and work with them. They got it down.
INT: That was a scene that could have
gone very wrong, but it turned out well.
CR: It's one of my favorite scenes. Most
guys would have made the white people
dance bad. The music would have been
off, they would have played one song
through the whole routine. They
wouldn't have changed it up, and when
it's time to C-walk, you need some C-walk
music playing. I grew up on hip-hop. I
know that you can't C-walk to non-C
-walk music.
INT: So Steven Spielberg would not have
gotten it?
CR: Steven Spielberg would not know
you don't C-walk to Nelly's "Hot in
Herre." You gotta C-walk to something
from Chronic or Chronic 2.
