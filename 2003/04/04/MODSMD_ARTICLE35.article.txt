# Airy tunes can't elevate Ataris' latest release
## 
### TAM VO 
Five years, three albums and a
staggering number of miles on the
road later, The Ataris continue to
proclaim that "The Radio Still
Sucks." This Santa Barbara-based
band has managed to jump the
gap from their punk indie days
with KungFu Records over to Co
lumbia Records with their major
label debut, "So Long, Astoria."
Inspired by Richard Hell's
novel, "Go Now," lead guitarist/
songwriter Kris Roe returned to
his old stomping grounds with a
Polaroid camera and a notebook in
hand, drawing on The Goonies
and Emily Dickinson for inspira
tion. Moving away from songs of
lost love and unrequited crushes,
"So Long, Astoria" is a reflection
on days gone by, memories long
past and growing up.
The Ataris have always been
heartfelt and genuine in their
music, but this album initially left
me feeling ambivalent, as some of
the songs simply amount to noth
ing more than generic, catchy
hook-laden fluff. However, not all

is lost. The rocking title
track sets the upbeat mood
of the rest of the album, dri
ven by drummer Chris
Knapp's lively rhythms,
John Collura's energetic
guitar riffs and Mike Dav
enport's pounding bass
lines.
Touches of moog and
mellotron as well as inter
mittent samplers add some
texture to mix. As a result,

songs such as "The Hero Dies In
This One" and "All You Can Ever
Learn Is What You Already
Know" resonate with the raw emo
tion and pure energy that The
Ataris are known for, punctuated
with distinct, well-placed screams.
Their cover of Don Henley's "The
Boys of Summer" is definitely
worth listening to, as it almost
makes up for the less-than-stellar
tracks on the album.
"The Saddest Song" is Roe's
moving apology to his daughter
for not being able to be a presence
in her life due to the strains of
being on the road touring. Roe
sings with such conviction that one
feels he means every last word.
"My Reply," which responds to
the letter of a fan whose life hangs
in the balance because of severe
eating disorders, deals with such
deeper issues, bringing a new
found maturity to the band. It's
songs like these that redeem the
stereotypical pop-punk / emo
songs on the CD. Finally, longtime
fans of the band will wax nostalgic
over a hidden new version of "I
Won't Spend Another Night

Alone," originally released on
1999's "Blue Skies, Broken Hearts,
Next Twelve Exits."
Despite these strengths, the
album comes up short. You're left
with the sense that The Ataris are
just beginning to scratch the sur
face of deeper issues, but the po
tential for depth is glossed over by
slick production and a push for
mass-market appeal. Ironically,
"Radio #2," which declares, "It's
about time that we turned off the
radio, call the request lines, and tell
them that it's over," fails to be con
vincing, coming from a band
which has just moved to a major
record label and whose songs are
beginning to be heard on the air
waves. (And yes, those are backup

So Long Astoria
i Ataris

vocals from Mike Herrera, of
MXPX fame.)
"In This Diary," the single
that's now flooding radio stations
nationwide, is strikingly reminis-

cent of Jimmy Eat World. The
song begins promisingly enough,
but then transitions into saccha
rine lyrics leading up to the corny
refrain, "These are the best days of
our lives / The only thing that mat
ters is just following your heart and
eventually you'll get it right," mak
ing me wonder if Disney infiltrated
the recording studio. Sadly, you'll
probably have the chorus stuck in
your head for days on end.
"Summer of '79" (A spoof of
Bryan Adams's classic, perhaps?)
and "Looking Back on Today"
only contribute by sounding like
perfect pop-punk tunes fora WB
teen drama soundtrack or an
MTV Spring Break party.
Being a longtime Ataris fan, I
share the sentiment that the band
has the capacity to create deeper,
more reflective music, music that
might not have the same selling
power that singles such as "In This
Diary" have. The potential is there
— here's to hoping that the band
eventually gets it right.
