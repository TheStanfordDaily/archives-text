# The 						Coral, high On...life
## 
### NICK STONE 
The six members of The Coral met in
high school in Hoylake, Merseyside,
near Liverpool, and are all under the
age of 22. Their music is a blend of folk,
soul, sea chanties, '60s pop, reggae,
punk and country. I talked to Paul Duffy
(bass/vocals), James Kelly (vocals/gui
tar) and lan Kelly (drums) last weekend
before they played with Supergrass at
Bimbo's in San Francisco.
For the record, on stage The Coral
were an extremely hard act to follow —
they tore through their set with an en
ergy and swagger that made up for their
dubious style (one wore a Polo Jeans
sweatshirt) and gave even their more
radio-friendly pop tunes a set of fangs.
Supergrass sounded pretty good but
they seemed like old professionals, in
the perjorative sense of both words, by
comparison. Now all that's left for The
Coral is to walk that fine line between
Bono and Bowie, make it past the third
album and avoid the Viking hats and co
caine planes.
Intermission: What is the business as
pect of all this like?
Paul Duffy: Pretty boring to be honest.
.. doing interviews and stuff, a lot of
standing around. We were in New York
fora week .. . just interviews and photo
shoots . . . having meet-and-greets.
Know what they are?
INT: Like with industry executives?
PD: Yeah, like go and meet them. We
call 'em fake-and-shakes. You've got to
do it. You've got to play the part to get on
the radio, d'you know what 1 mean. It's
all part of it.
INT: Would you say that marijuana is
the seventh member of The Coral?
PD: No, my brother is.
Lan Kelly: So it's the eighth member.
PD: I wouldn't say it's a member it's just
that we're all sort of potheads.
James Kelly: Everyone smokes. Who
doesn't smoke weed? Everyone I know
smokes weed.
INT: We're anglophiles, and we try to
keep up on the British slang, so y'know
we read "Mojo" and that kind of stuff.
PD: They don't even talk English in
Mojo magazine.
INT: Well we wanted to find out what
some words mean — like 'mega.'
JK: Mega?
PD: That's Manchester.
JK: Yeah, mega, Manchester that's more
Manchester, mega. (Everyone starts say
ing "mega.") Mega. Mega lego. Mega
lego.
INT: Mega lego?
JK: Lego.
INT: Lego?
PD: It's just mega.
JK: Mega lego. Like you've got a (unin
telligible). Lego.
INT: Oh, OK. (I'm starting to wish I had
never brought this up.)
J K: Like you have a mega burger.
(American accent) mega burger!
INT: How about'class'?
PD: Class? (Everyone starts saying class.)

JK: That's Manchester as well. Have you
been reading Liam Gallagher inter
views? That's all Manchester, that.
INT: So what do you guys say?
PD: Nice one. Cheers.
IK: That's Liverpool — that's like Ja
maican slang innit? 'Nice one.'
INT: So you all tried college and just de
cided, 'fuck this.'
PD: Yeah, it was mostly the tutors.
JK: College over here is like ... univer
sity. College in England is not university.
Anyone can go to college, so it's all shit.
.. I studied canoes. I studied canoes for
ages, but I never got to go on a canoe.
INT: You guys ever consider studying
music?
PD: That's what I did. Fucking hated it.
JK: Full of musos.
PD: They'd be like, 'Give me your gui
tar.' (puts his leg up on a chair, strums an
air guitar pretentiously). The final straw
was when we had to do like an ensemble
piece. All a bit bollocks really.
INT: One thing I noticed listening to
your album was that you guys recognize
that music didn't start in the '50s with
Elvis Presley or Litde Richard — that
there was actually music before that, and
it was good.
ALL: Yeah.
JK Our new stuff is even more like that:
Older.
INT: What opened that up?
PD: It's like you start with the Beatles.
INT: Or Oasis.
PD: Yeah, Oasis, but they were into the
Beatles, right. So you start with the Bea
tles. What were they into? Elvis. What
was Elvis into? Gospel. What was gospel
— you know like ...
JK And then you get the history, the
slaves comin' over and that.
PD: It's just.. . everything .. . being
open...
JK: To get out of all the mainstream
stuff.
INT: So have you given up on Oasis?
PD No.
JK No, they're good lads. Why would
we give up on them? They've never
done anything.
PD: They're just like we are; they'rejust
into playing rock 'n' roll and getting
pissed. You've got a few people who are
growing out of it maybe.
JK: I think they've done enough. If you
write that many great songs you can't ex
actly write many more.
ALL: Yeah, yeah.
JK: They've got their trick clown,
y'know? If you do that then you do one
album, you do another album, and you
already know where you're going with
the third album — you go in a com
pletely different direction than the last
one, the second one.
IK: I think The Strokes might be one of
diem bands, where they're amazing up
to the third album and then it's like
where can we go? They're one of them
bands that's so tight at what they do that
they just become formulated.
JK: just become parodies of themselves
like the Rolling Stones.
INT : The Strokes actually played with

the Rolling Stones, and then in inter
views they said 'We don't really like the
Rolling Stones.'
JK: Why would you — how can you not
like the Rolling Stones? They're amaz
ing, the Rolling Stones are one of the
greatest bands ever.
PD: Now they're all psychos with hip re
placements.
INT: Made of plastic.
IK: They're cyborgs!
INT: 1 just don't like to see old guys on
stage.
JK It's not old guys, it's ... like John
Lee H(x)ker looks amazing.
PD: Depends what you're doing, innit.
JK: If you're an old white guy, trying to
rock out... (All start making fun of
Sting and Paul McCartney; a Beades dis
cussion follows from which I can make
out nothing save the classic observation
by James that 'while everyone else was in
India going to see the Maharishi, Ringo
was just shagging birds.')
INT: Who do you think needs more ex
posure right now? Who deserves press
that's not getting it?
JK: The Zutons.
IK: The Beta Band. I think that album
— Hot Shots Part Two — is going to be
like Pet Sounds was — not recognized at
first, but...
INT: Do you still jam?
PD: Oh god, yes.
JK: Yeah. The next album is more song
based and then we're going to get right
back into jamming. But you know, not
jamming like Jimi Hendrix at Wood
stock, with a split! in your mouth and a
hard-on ... Not a jazz band or Led Zep
pelin (starts going off about Robert Plant
in a Viking hat, traveling back in time to
save jimmy Page as a baby to Paul and
lan's great amusement).
IK: It's cocaine. Cocaine and having
your own plane.
JK It's gobbling innit? Cobbling and
getting into unicorns and shit.
INT: Say you go see a band tonight and
in the middle of the show they stop and
start talking about the war ...
PD: I'd go "Shut up and play your
tunes."
JK: If you want to do that —

PD: You stay in and watch the fucking
telly.
JK:I mean the guy who's telling you that
he's making the decision of what's going
on, he's lying, and he's a robot reading
off a screen, so you don't even know
what's going on. Bush — he's like Bat
man isn't he? (nasal American voice) 'I'll
swing through the streets and get these
evildoers!'
PD: One guy with a guitar isn't going to
change hick all. It might change a few
views but d'yon know what? If I wanted
to do that I'd stay in and watch CNN all
night. If you want to go out you're going
out to hear music and have a good time
and forget about all that shit.
IK: You go out and have a good time
and then reality kicks in when you get
back home.
JK As far as I'm concerned we could all
be this big (puts his fingers a centimeter
apart) d'you know what I mean? On the
end of a living turd. And we don't even
know. And space could be like a massive
shit ship, and we could be inside it.
INT: What do you think of Bowie now?
It's like he's being groomed to be a
prime minister or something.
PD: That's Bono innit.
IK: There's a fine line between Bono
and Bowie. (Supergrass enters, distort
ed conversation follows. Supergrass' Gaz
gives James some weed and asks about
Denver, which James describes as 'too
cold fora snowball fight ... depresski
mo.')
INT: Who do you guys like from Mo
town?
JKE veryone. Smokey Robinson.
IK: Smokey Robinson's a channeler.
PD: Where does he get that from?
JK: It's just logic, it'sjust mathematical.
.. it's like musical logic ... you can get a
groove, and you can get everyone going,
but it's the sad songs that really get peo
ple ... It's like Christina Aguilera can
sing any note in the scale, and Billie Hol
iday can sing one, or in one key, but...
give me Billie Holiday. She puts you in
like a '30s theater dream comfort world.
It's like when you watch the old original
"Snow White," and you can feel the frost
coming off the telly.

groove, and you can get everyone going,
but it's the sad songs that really get peo
ple ... It's like Christina Aguilera can
sing any note in the scale, and Billie Hol
iday can sing one, or in one key, but...
give me Billie Holiday. She puts you in
like a '30s theater dream comfort world.
It's like when you watch the old original
"Snow White," and you can feel the frost
coming off the telly.


The eighth member of the band is growing in the shack
The six members of The Coral met in
high school in Hoylake, Merseyside,
near Liverpool, and are all under the
age of 22. Their music is a blend of folk,
soul, sea chanties, '60s pop, reggae,
punk and country. I talked to Paul Duffy
(bass/vocals), James Kelly (vocals/gui
tar) and lan Kelly (drums) last weekend
before they played with Supergrass at
Bimbo's in San Francisco.
For the record, on stage The Coral
were an extremely hard act to follow —
they tore through their set with an en
ergy and swagger that made up for their
dubious style (one wore a Polo Jeans
sweatshirt) and gave even their more
radio-friendly pop tunes a set of fangs.
Supergrass sounded pretty good but
they seemed like old professionals, in
the perjorative sense of both words, by
comparison. Now all that's left for The
Coral is to walk that fine line between
Bono and Bowie, make it past the third
album and avoid the Viking hats and co
caine planes.
Intermission: What is the business as
pect of all this like?
Paul Duffy: Pretty boring to be honest.
.. doing interviews and stuff, a lot of
standing around. We were in New York
fora week .. . just interviews and photo
shoots . . . having meet-and-greets.
Know what they are?
INT: Like with industry executives?
PD: Yeah, like go and meet them. We
call 'em fake-and-shakes. You've got to
do it. You've got to play the part to get on
the radio, d'you know what 1 mean. It's
all part of it.
INT: Would you say that marijuana is
the seventh member of The Coral?
PD: No, my brother is.
Lan Kelly: So it's the eighth member.
PD: I wouldn't say it's a member it's just
that we're all sort of potheads.
James Kelly: Everyone smokes. Who
doesn't smoke weed? Everyone I know
smokes weed.
INT: We're anglophiles, and we try to
keep up on the British slang, so y'know
we read "Mojo" and that kind of stuff.
PD: They don't even talk English in
Mojo magazine.
INT: Well we wanted to find out what
some words mean — like 'mega.'
JK: Mega?
PD: That's Manchester.
JK: Yeah, mega, Manchester that's more
Manchester, mega. (Everyone starts say
ing "mega.") Mega. Mega lego. Mega
lego.
INT: Mega lego?
JK: Lego.
INT: Lego?
PD: It's just mega.
JK: Mega lego. Like you've got a (unin
telligible). Lego.
INT: Oh, OK. (I'm starting to wish I had
never brought this up.)
J K: Like you have a mega burger.
(American accent) mega burger!
INT: How about'class'?
PD: Class? (Everyone starts saying class.)

JK: That's Manchester as well. Have you
been reading Liam Gallagher inter
views? That's all Manchester, that.
INT: So what do you guys say?
PD: Nice one. Cheers.
IK: That's Liverpool — that's like Ja
maican slang innit? 'Nice one.'
INT: So you all tried college and just de
cided, 'fuck this.'
PD: Yeah, it was mostly the tutors.
JK: College over here is like ... univer
sity. College in England is not university.
Anyone can go to college, so it's all shit.
.. I studied canoes. I studied canoes for
ages, but I never got to go on a canoe.
INT: You guys ever consider studying
music?
PD: That's what I did. Fucking hated it.
JK: Full of musos.
PD: They'd be like, 'Give me your gui
tar.' (puts his leg up on a chair, strums an
air guitar pretentiously). The final straw
was when we had to do like an ensemble
piece. All a bit bollocks really.
INT: One thing I noticed listening to
your album was that you guys recognize
that music didn't start in the '50s with
Elvis Presley or Litde Richard — that
there was actually music before that, and
it was good.
ALL: Yeah.
JK Our new stuff is even more like that:
Older.
INT: What opened that up?
PD: It's like you start with the Beatles.
INT: Or Oasis.
PD: Yeah, Oasis, but they were into the
Beatles, right. So you start with the Bea
tles. What were they into? Elvis. What
was Elvis into? Gospel. What was gospel
— you know like ...
JK And then you get the history, the
slaves comin' over and that.
PD: It's just.. . everything .. . being
open...
JK: To get out of all the mainstream
stuff.
INT: So have you given up on Oasis?
PD No.
JK No, they're good lads. Why would
we give up on them? They've never
done anything.
PD: They're just like we are; they'rejust
into playing rock 'n' roll and getting
pissed. You've got a few people who are
growing out of it maybe.
JK: I think they've done enough. If you
write that many great songs you can't ex
actly write many more.
ALL: Yeah, yeah.
JK: They've got their trick clown,
y'know? If you do that then you do one
album, you do another album, and you
already know where you're going with
the third album — you go in a com
pletely different direction than the last
one, the second one.
IK: I think The Strokes might be one of
diem bands, where they're amazing up
to the third album and then it's like
where can we go? They're one of them
bands that's so tight at what they do that
they just become formulated.
JK: just become parodies of themselves
like the Rolling Stones.
INT : The Strokes actually played with

the Rolling Stones, and then in inter
views they said 'We don't really like the
Rolling Stones.'
JK: Why would you — how can you not
like the Rolling Stones? They're amaz
ing, the Rolling Stones are one of the
greatest bands ever.
PD: Now they're all psychos with hip re
placements.
INT: Made of plastic.
IK: They're cyborgs!
INT: 1 just don't like to see old guys on
stage.
JK It's not old guys, it's ... like John
Lee H(x)ker looks amazing.
PD: Depends what you're doing, innit.
JK: If you're an old white guy, trying to
rock out... (All start making fun of
Sting and Paul McCartney; a Beades dis
cussion follows from which I can make
out nothing save the classic observation
by James that 'while everyone else was in
India going to see the Maharishi, Ringo
was just shagging birds.')
INT: Who do you think needs more ex
posure right now? Who deserves press
that's not getting it?
JK: The Zutons.
IK: The Beta Band. I think that album
— Hot Shots Part Two — is going to be
like Pet Sounds was — not recognized at
first, but...
INT: Do you still jam?
PD: Oh god, yes.
JK: Yeah. The next album is more song
based and then we're going to get right
back into jamming. But you know, not
jamming like Jimi Hendrix at Wood
stock, with a split! in your mouth and a
hard-on ... Not a jazz band or Led Zep
pelin (starts going off about Robert Plant
in a Viking hat, traveling back in time to
save jimmy Page as a baby to Paul and
lan's great amusement).
IK: It's cocaine. Cocaine and having
your own plane.
JK It's gobbling innit? Cobbling and
getting into unicorns and shit.
INT: Say you go see a band tonight and
in the middle of the show they stop and
start talking about the war ...
PD: I'd go "Shut up and play your
tunes."
JK: If you want to do that —

PD: You stay in and watch the fucking
telly.
JK:I mean the guy who's telling you that
he's making the decision of what's going
on, he's lying, and he's a robot reading
off a screen, so you don't even know
what's going on. Bush — he's like Bat
man isn't he? (nasal American voice) 'I'll
swing through the streets and get these
evildoers!'
PD: One guy with a guitar isn't going to
change hick all. It might change a few
views but d'yon know what? If I wanted
to do that I'd stay in and watch CNN all
night. If you want to go out you're going
out to hear music and have a good time
and forget about all that shit.
IK: You go out and have a good time
and then reality kicks in when you get
back home.
JK As far as I'm concerned we could all
be this big (puts his fingers a centimeter
apart) d'you know what I mean? On the
end of a living turd. And we don't even
know. And space could be like a massive
shit ship, and we could be inside it.
INT: What do you think of Bowie now?
It's like he's being groomed to be a
prime minister or something.
PD: That's Bono innit.
IK: There's a fine line between Bono
and Bowie. (Supergrass enters, distort
ed conversation follows. Supergrass' Gaz
gives James some weed and asks about
Denver, which James describes as 'too
cold fora snowball fight ... depresski
mo.')
INT: Who do you guys like from Mo
town?
JKE veryone. Smokey Robinson.
IK: Smokey Robinson's a channeler.
PD: Where does he get that from?
JK: It's just logic, it'sjust mathematical.
.. it's like musical logic ... you can get a
groove, and you can get everyone going,
but it's the sad songs that really get peo

IK: There's a fine line between Bono
and Bowie. (Supergrass enters, distort
ed conversation follows. Supergrass' Gaz
gives James some weed and asks about
Denver, which James describes as 'too
cold fora snowball fight ... depresski
mo.')
INT: Who do you guys like from Mo
town?
JKE veryone. Smokey Robinson.
IK: Smokey Robinson's a channeler.
PD: Where does he get that from?
JK: It's just logic, it'sjust mathematical.
.. it's like musical logic ... you can get a
groove, and you can get everyone going,
but it's the sad songs that really get peo
ple ... It's like Christina Aguilera can
sing any note in the scale, and Billie Hol
iday can sing one, or in one key, but...
give me Billie Holiday. She puts you in
like a '30s theater dream comfort world.
It's like when you watch the old original
"Snow White," and you can feel the frost
coming off the telly.


The eighth member of the band is growing in the shack
The six members of The Coral met in
high school in Hoylake, Merseyside,
near Liverpool, and are all under the
age of 22. Their music is a blend of folk,
soul, sea chanties, '60s pop, reggae,
punk and country. I talked to Paul Duffy
(bass/vocals), James Kelly (vocals/gui
tar) and lan Kelly (drums) last weekend
before they played with Supergrass at
Bimbo's in San Francisco.
For the record, on stage The Coral
were an extremely hard act to follow —
they tore through their set with an en
ergy and swagger that made up for their
dubious style (one wore a Polo Jeans
sweatshirt) and gave even their more
radio-friendly pop tunes a set of fangs.
Supergrass sounded pretty good but
they seemed like old professionals, in
the perjorative sense of both words, by
comparison. Now all that's left for The
Coral is to walk that fine line between
Bono and Bowie, make it past the third
album and avoid the Viking hats and co
caine planes.
Intermission: What is the business as
pect of all this like?
Paul Duffy: Pretty boring to be honest.
.. doing interviews and stuff, a lot of
standing around. We were in New York
fora week .. . just interviews and photo
shoots . . . having meet-and-greets.
Know what they are?
INT: Like with industry executives?
PD: Yeah, like go and meet them. We
call 'em fake-and-shakes. You've got to
do it. You've got to play the part to get on
the radio, d'you know what 1 mean. It's
all part of it.
INT: Would you say that marijuana is
the seventh member of The Coral?
PD: No, my brother is.
Lan Kelly: So it's the eighth member.
PD: I wouldn't say it's a member it's just
that we're all sort of potheads.
James Kelly: Everyone smokes. Who
doesn't smoke weed? Everyone I know
smokes weed.
INT: We're anglophiles, and we try to
keep up on the British slang, so y'know
we read "Mojo" and that kind of stuff.
PD: They don't even talk English in
Mojo magazine.
INT: Well we wanted to find out what
some words mean — like 'mega.'
JK: Mega?
PD: That's Manchester.
JK: Yeah, mega, Manchester that's more
Manchester, mega. (Everyone starts say
ing "mega.") Mega. Mega lego. Mega
lego.
INT: Mega lego?
JK: Lego.
INT: Lego?
PD: It's just mega.
JK: Mega lego. Like you've got a (unin
telligible). Lego.
INT: Oh, OK. (I'm starting to wish I had
never brought this up.)
J K: Like you have a mega burger.
(American accent) mega burger!
INT: How about'class'?
PD: Class? (Everyone starts saying class.)

JK: That's Manchester as well. Have you
been reading Liam Gallagher inter
views? That's all Manchester, that.
INT: So what do you guys say?
PD: Nice one. Cheers.
IK: That's Liverpool — that's like Ja
maican slang innit? 'Nice one.'
INT: So you all tried college and just de
cided, 'fuck this.'
PD: Yeah, it was mostly the tutors.
JK: College over here is like ... univer
sity. College in England is not university.
Anyone can go to college, so it's all shit.
.. I studied canoes. I studied canoes for
ages, but I never got to go on a canoe.
INT: You guys ever consider studying
music?
PD: That's what I did. Fucking hated it.
JK: Full of musos.
PD: They'd be like, 'Give me your gui
tar.' (puts his leg up on a chair, strums an
air guitar pretentiously). The final straw
was when we had to do like an ensemble
piece. All a bit bollocks really.
INT: One thing I noticed listening to
your album was that you guys recognize
that music didn't start in the '50s with
Elvis Presley or Litde Richard — that
there was actually music before that, and
it was good.
ALL: Yeah.
JK Our new stuff is even more like that:
Older.
INT: What opened that up?
PD: It's like you start with the Beatles.
INT: Or Oasis.
PD: Yeah, Oasis, but they were into the
Beatles, right. So you start with the Bea
tles. What were they into? Elvis. What
was Elvis into? Gospel. What was gospel
— you know like ...
JK And then you get the history, the
slaves comin' over and that.
PD: It's just.. . everything .. . being
open...
JK: To get out of all the mainstream
stuff.
INT: So have you given up on Oasis?
PD No.
JK No, they're good lads. Why would
we give up on them? They've never
done anything.
PD: They're just like we are; they'rejust
into playing rock 'n' roll and getting
pissed. You've got a few people who are
growing out of it maybe.
JK: I think they've done enough. If you
write that many great songs you can't ex
actly write many more.
ALL: Yeah, yeah.
JK: They've got their trick clown,
y'know? If you do that then you do one
album, you do another album, and you
already know where you're going with
the third album — you go in a com
pletely different direction than the last
one, the second one.
IK: I think The Strokes might be one of
diem bands, where they're amazing up
to the third album and then it's like
where can we go? They're one of them
bands that's so tight at what they do that
they just become formulated.
JK: just become parodies of themselves
like the Rolling Stones.
INT : The Strokes actually played with

the Rolling Stones, and then in inter
views they said 'We don't really like the
Rolling Stones.'
JK: Why would you — how can you not
like the Rolling Stones? They're amaz
ing, the Rolling Stones are one of the
greatest bands ever.
PD: Now they're all psychos with hip re
placements.
INT: Made of plastic.
IK: They're cyborgs!
INT: 1 just don't like to see old guys on
stage.
JK It's not old guys, it's ... like John
Lee H(x)ker looks amazing.
PD: Depends what you're doing, innit.
JK: If you're an old white guy, trying to
rock out... (All start making fun of
Sting and Paul McCartney; a Beades dis
cussion follows from which I can make
out nothing save the classic observation
by James that 'while everyone else was in
India going to see the Maharishi, Ringo
was just shagging birds.')
INT: Who do you think needs more ex
posure right now? Who deserves press
that's not getting it?
JK: The Zutons.
IK: The Beta Band. I think that album
— Hot Shots Part Two — is going to be
like Pet Sounds was — not recognized at
first, but...
INT: Do you still jam?
PD: Oh god, yes.
JK: Yeah. The next album is more song
based and then we're going to get right
back into jamming. But you know, not
jamming like Jimi Hendrix at Wood
stock, with a split! in your mouth and a
hard-on ... Not a jazz band or Led Zep
pelin (starts going off about Robert Plant
in a Viking hat, traveling back in time to
save jimmy Page as a baby to Paul and
lan's great amusement).
IK: It's cocaine. Cocaine and having
your own plane.
JK It's gobbling innit? Cobbling and
getting into unicorns and shit.
INT: Say you go see a band tonight and
in the middle of the show they stop and
start talking about the war ...
PD: I'd go "Shut up and play your
tunes."
JK: If you want to do that —

PD: You stay in and watch the fucking
telly.
JK:I mean the guy who's telling you that
he's making the decision of what's going
on, he's lying, and he's a robot reading
off a screen, so you don't even know
what's going on. Bush — he's like Bat
man isn't he? (nasal American voice) 'I'll
swing through the streets and get these
evildoers!'
PD: One guy with a guitar isn't going to
change hick all. It might change a few
views but d'yon know what? If I wanted
to do that I'd stay in and watch CNN all
night. If you want to go out you're going
out to hear music and have a good time
and forget about all that shit.
IK: You go out and have a good time
and then reality kicks in when you get
back home.
JK As far as I'm concerned we could all
be this big (puts his fingers a centimeter
apart) d'you know what I mean? On the
end of a living turd. And we don't even
know. And space could be like a massive
shit ship, and we could be inside it.
INT: What do you think of Bowie now?
It's like he's being groomed to be a
prime minister or something.
PD: That's Bono innit.
IK: There's a fine line between Bono
and Bowie. (Supergrass enters, distort
ed conversation follows. Supergrass' Gaz
gives James some weed and asks about
Denver, which James describes as 'too
cold fora snowball fight ... depresski
mo.')
INT: Who do you guys like from Mo
