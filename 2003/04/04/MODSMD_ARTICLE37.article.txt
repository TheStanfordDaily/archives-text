# Roxy Sass: The rules of rejection
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Having survived the debauchery of a
Florida-filled spring break, Roxy Sass is
now a licensed master at rejection, suc
cessfully fending off all offensive oglers,
from hormone-riding prepubescents to
shockingly lecherous old men. Yet the
issue of rejection becomes much trickier
at Stanford, where your harsh rejection
of an amorous coed could lead to three
hours of awkwardness a week when he
or she walks into your I-Hum section.
Section-hopping aside, the most ef
fective way of avoiding such an uncom
fortable situation is to prevent it from
happening by mastering the art of
graceful rejection. Sometimes this seems
damn near impossible, and when the
admirer makes you feel physically un
comfortable, feel free to respond equal
ly tactlessly. Never defer to politeness at
the sake of your own safety or self-re
spect.
That said, the majority of flirtatious
Stanford students are harmless —
sometimes woefully unskilled at co
quetry and clumsy and boorish when
inebriated — but essentially harmless.
Roxy has pinpointed the most common
techniques that woorers employ — the
direct hit, diplomacy and simulated
friendship.

The direct hit is the riskiest, often ob
served in the fracas of a fraternity dance
floor. The aggressor enters the prey's
space, intimates physical interest and
waits fora response. If you find yourself
in the position of the hunted, it's fine to
play along if you are neither repulsed
nor turned on.
Just remember what you learned in
grade school about escaping from a kid
napper if things get too heavy too fast:
Run towards a crowd yelling "This is not
my parent!" Get on all fours and eat
grass. But above all, do not let him 01 her
lure you to a private location. Once in the
seclusion of a dorm room, it's much
more difficult to extricate yourself with
grace. Keep a group of friends close by to
prevent you from being snatched away.
Diplomacy, most commonly prac
ticed in the halls of junior high, is a
safer bet as the pursuer goes through a
third party, usually a mutual friend, to
express his or her interest. As a result,
an act of graceful rejection is highly
variable because it relies heavily upon
the eloquence of the third party, but
there are ways to ameliorate an other
wise sticky situation. Tell the friend that
you are flattered, really. Then politely
express your disinterest. You can
throw in a fake boy / girlfriend if the
would-be-suitor is a perfect stranger,
but lying isn't advised since the tight

knit Stanford social scene mixed with
the erudite focus of the average student
often leads to extensive fact-checking.
Finally, simulated friendship is the
wimpiest, thus most popular, method.
It's likely being carried out in dorms
across campus as we speak. The pur
suer deliberately leaves his or her ad
vances romantically ambiguous, safely
tucked under the guise of friendship,
providing wiggle room to retract if re
jection seems imminent.
Even if you have your suspicions, go
ahead and give the "friend" your
phone number or at least your screen
name. It can't hurt, and you may be
pleasantly surprised if this method
works. Unless it doesn't, in which case,
stay as platonic as possible, giving clear
signs of romantic disinterest. If it
comes to an awkward confrontation
despite your attempts at deterrence,
take heart — you'll be able to salvage
the friendship if it's worth it.
Good luck on all your pursuits this
lovely spring quarter, dear readers. And
to unsuccessful wooers: Don't give up!
The year is almost over, so even if a peer
rejects you less than gracefully, forge
ahead. Any stat major will tell you that
higher numbers will work in your favor.

Some people just don't take rejection well. Wookie
gets hives.
