# 'Life' barely registers a pulse
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
It is now the eighth year of Brit-blazing Supergrass'
continued anonymity in the United States, and we're
shitting in our pants because of it. The critics have al
ready told us that we Americans have notoriously bad
taste, and that having Bush as our president is no ex
cuse. Blokes, if we're going to eat Freedom Fries on
Union Jack table-spreads and ogle the Queen, then
goddamit, we'd better like Supergrass and buy into
the reviews.
Now, here's my problem — if we don't care about
life in other countries, why would we ever care about
"Life On Other Planets"? You're recoiling now, but
you'll excuse that godawful pun when I tell you that
this album is a convenient thesis for Supergrass' con
sistent state-side failure; it shows that they've got the
hooks, the looks, the psychedelic '70s influences —
but about as much personality as a senile jellyfish.
There, I told you.
Honestly, the fact that Supergrass' last two albums
were almost universally acclaimed only adds muscle to
my review. I feel like one of those critics who had the
balls to stand before the Queen in 1970 and say loud
ly "By golly, miss, The Beatles' "Let It Be," despite all
their greatness, is really quite a substandard piece of
crap."
Of course, by doing this 1 don't mean to elevate
Supergrass to the iconic status of The Beatles — far
from it; all I am attempting is a simultaneous deni
gration of "Life On Other Planets" and an establish
ment of the fact that this is a '70s Beatles — Pink

Floyd record masquerading as a
summer fi at party.
Not to say that Supergrass
doesn't have a lot going for them.
For one, they boast excellent pro
duction credentials and thick lam
ination — their problem is that
they've created and overused the
template on this album with the

quick pace hardly changing until the penultimate
song. This is a polymer of songs as colorful as tie
dyed cotton and about as digestible as nylon.
Also, unlike their contemporaries — Coldplay
and Travis — the members of Supergrass are no
wimps; they're pimps, and they're living up the
glam and psychedelia on this album as if T-Rex
were a bad dream: Marc Bolan is especially alive in
Gaz's jaded, deep-fried vocals and the predictable,
syrupy crescendos — have that mouthwash
handy!
And just because you never caught T-Rex doesn't
mean this album won't sound heard and dated. It's
meant to. "Evening of the Day" is something McCart
ney would churn out in his bedchamber after his LSI)
trip had subsided with Ririgo reclining on his Bongos,
whistling. It's actually pretty nifty.

On "Can't Get Up," I slap myself for recalling Kula
Shaker, but the line "I try standing in the forest of rea
son" seals it.
"Knn," meanwhile, channels The Beach Boys and
cheesy '70s balladry to magnificent effect. It also bold
ly closes the album on a merry-go-round pitch — Yes!
Pace change!
Folks, 1 understand that Supergrass has an explicit
mission statement — "fun" — but I'm not having any:
This album doesn't stand up to multiple listens main
ly because it's broadcasting the extinct and making no
purposeful goof-ups. I've worked hard at loving these
guys, and even my weekly dose ofanglophilia has gone
to waste. So, in the end, "Life On Other Planets" gets
one star for having a few great songs and another star
for laudable influences but gets no more for not being
nearly good enough for this world.
