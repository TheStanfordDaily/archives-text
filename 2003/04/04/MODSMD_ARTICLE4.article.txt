# University to host neighbors
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its continued efforts to reach out to
populations surrounding Stanford, the Uni
versity will host the second annual Commu
nity Day this Sunday.
On the same day, student groups and
campus unions will host a rally and march
for Stanford workers to increase awareness
of labor issues on campus and in the Bay
Area.
Sponsored by the Office of the President
and Provost and coordinated by the ()ffice of
University Communications under the Vice
President for Public Affairs, Community Day
events are scheduled from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m.
These include a community health fair,
student science demonstrations, a poetry
slam, an archaeological artifacts guessing
contest, the Stanford Community Carnival,

the University's Founders' Celebrations, ath
letic events and faculty lectures, to name a
few. Approximately 30 campus offices and
departments and about 25 student groups
are hosting programs for Community Day.
"We hope Community Day strengthens
partnerships among the University and its
neighbors and increases understanding
about Stanford's mission of teaching and re
search," said University Communications
Specialist Ryan Foley.
Last year's Community Day attracted be
tween 6,500 and 7,500 people, and similar
numbers are expected this year.
"We've invited Stanford's neighbors to at
tend, specifically folks in Palo Alto, East Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, Woodside, Portola Valley
and Mountain View," Foley said. "Last year
we found that the vast majority of visitors
brought young children, so even
more of this year's events are
geared toward families."
The student-run Stanford
Community Carnival will provide
numerous ac tivities for children.
"It's a day of free games for the
kids and a chance for them to in
teract with Stanford students," said
sophomore Connie Chen, director
of the carnival.
The carnival includes 21 booths
sponsored by dorms and student
groups, according to Chen. The
sponsors donated money for the
rental of the booths and volunteers
to run their booth's activities,
which include face painting, a soc
cer shoot-out and a balloon dart
booth.
"We like to think that after
doing this a lot of students will go
on to participate in other commu
nity service events," Chen said.
Besides money from sponsors,
Chen explained, the carnival also
depends on money from special

fees, which is then matched with
Community Day funds.
"This year, we devoted at least a
quarter of our budget to buses for
people from East Palo Alto and to
provide free lunches and make the
day a leel good kind of day," Chen
said.
In a separate effort to raise
awareness of issues in the Stanford
community, the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition and the Coalition
for Labor Justice are holding a rally
and march for Stanford workers at
the Graduate School of Business'
Littlefield Center at 11:45 a.m.
Sunday.
The event, according to sopho
more Anna Mumford, one of the
event's coordinators, was orga
nized in conjunction with the Ser
vice Employees International
Union 715, which represents most
directly hired union employees in
dining and housing on campus,
SEIU 1877, which represents
American Building Maintenance
Co. janitors, the South Bay Labor
Council and Unite, which repre
sents workers in the linen service.
"The message [of Community
Day] is that Stanford cares about

the community," Mumford said.
"(Stanford] needs to truly make
community a priority and needs to
be a great employer. They're one
of the largest employees in Silicon
V alley, and they need to live up to
their reputation as a great universi
'y"
Mumford listed a living wage,
job security and insurance as some
of the benefits the rally and march
will advocate. Ideally, Mumford
said, a code of conduct for fair em
ployment and basic labor stan
dards would be created.
The University has established a
living wage policy for non-union
ized workers and has said it works
individually with each union to cre
ate contracts.
Last year at Community Day
over 1,000 students, workers and
others from the area are marched
for the same cause.
"It's the day Stanford has cho
sen to honor the community and
we want to show them they can't ig
nore certain parts of the communi
ty," Mumford said. "They need to
listen to workers and the student
voices. Community Day's a great
dav to show them all that."
