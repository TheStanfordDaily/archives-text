# FacSen hears retirement issues

### CARLY GEEHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday afternoon, after unanimously
approving the lists of winter quarter candi
dates for both baccalaureate and advanced
degrees, the Faculty Senate turned its atten
tion to faculty retirement issues. Topics of
particular interest for the senate were the
treatment of emeriti and the effects of Stan
ford's decade-old faculty retirement incen
tive program.
Next year marks the end of the first
decade in Stanford's history without
mandatory faculty retirement. Prior to the
early 1980s, faculty were required to retire
at age 65. The age cap was raised to 70 dur
ing the 1980s, but in 1993 the U.S. govern
ment issued a federal mandate ending all

compulsory faculty retirement programs.
John Shoven, a professor of economics,
presented the senate with a report on the
impact of the end of mandatory faculty re
tirement on the Stanford community.
"There has been a striking change in the
age composition [of the faculty] in the last 20
years," Shoven said. He cited a marked in
crease in the 44 to 49 age group and a de
cline in the percentage of faculty under 40,
but he conceded that the change cannot he
directly attributed to the elimination of
mandatory faculty retirement. "Some of it
has to do with the baby boom," he said.
Another marked change has been in the
rate of retention of faculty aged 70 or over.
"With mandatory retirement, only 7 per-
cent of those working at private re
search universities were still work
ing at 73. That number is now 41
percent," Shoven said.
The "relatively generous" re
tirement incentive plan was instat
ed partly out of the fear that facul
ty might "just stay and stay and
stay," Shoven explained. "But that
hasn't occurred."
Sociology Prof. Mark Granovet
ter suggested that the University
be more concerned with retaining
experienced faculty for the benefit
of the University and less con
cerned with getting them to retire.
He expressed worry about "losing
a lot of valuable people" to retire
ment.
Robert Simoni, a professor of

biology, voiced his concerns about
the treatment of former faculty.
He cited parking, health care qual
ity, research opportunities and of
fice space as several areas that
need improvement for emeriti.
Further, Simoni suggested that
a committee or task force be creat
ed to act on emeriti issues, point
ing out that these issues have been
previously discussed many times
in the senate, but no significant
changes have been made.
Though the senate made no
changes concerning emeriti in the
meeting, senate Chair Henry
Greely, a professor of law, cited the
addition of two emeriti to the sen
ate this year as an improvement in
the treatment of emeriti. He
ended the discussion due to time
constraints but assured the senate
that the issues will be addressed in
a later senate session, most likely in
the next academic year.
