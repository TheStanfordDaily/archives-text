An eclectic mixture of thespians,
songwriters, guitarists, dance perform
ers and photographers from through
out the Stanford community will come
together to form An Art Affair today.
Stanford's largest student-run arts festi
val will run from noon to 11 p.m. in
White Plaza.
The Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts runs An Art Affair at no cost
to spectators. As SOCA's main event of
the year, the festival brings together 90
performances on three stages, 500 dis
plays of visual art and an outdoor film
festival.
Organizers say that the fourth annu
al An Art Affair continues Stanford's ap
preciation for the various talents of its

diverse student body.
"Stanford attracts a student body
with an incredible range of talents,
both academic and otherwise, many
of which go unnoticed or unappreci
ated," says SOCA president Scott
Cannon, a senior. "An Art Affair is an
opportunity to showcase a breadth
and depth of artistic talent, helping
to foster greater pride in our Stan
ford community."
In addition to live attractions, SOCA
will distribute 3,000 free copies of
"Stanford Soundtrack Vol. 2: Standing
Out." Stanford's second soundtrack
features 18 campus bands and song
writers, chosen from over 50 entrants.
"The quality of all the submissions
this year was amazing," said Stanford
Soundtrack producer James Lin.
"It was great being able to listen to
the style and passion in each
piece, but it definitely was a strug
gle trying to narrow the selections
down to 18."
The day will include spoken
word performances and poetry
readings. The SOCA creative writ
ing anthology will also be distrib
uted throughout the day.
An Art Affair encourages collab
oration between various artistic vi
sions to prepare a cooperative op
portunity for peers to share their
works, fhe festival extends to Stan
ford students, faculty and staff by
enticing both aesthetic tastes and
offering a free gourmet dinner for
the public.
SOCA promotes An Art Affair to
encourage community apprecia
tion of the arts â€” a chance to see
artistic collaboration and hear mu
sical performances, as well as to
break the monotony of dining hall
dinners.
