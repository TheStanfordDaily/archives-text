Despite common student percep
tion, ASSU executive office candidates
junior Steve Yelderman and junior
Charlie Stockman, want voters to know
that they are not running as the tradi
tional Chaparral candidates.
"We're definitely not on the Chap
pie slate, and our relationship with the
Chappie is actually very loose," Yelder
man said. "This year since there isn't [a
(-happie slate]; a lot of people are trying
to figure out who it is. I don't know why
people don't think it's Joey and
Nadiya."
As to their relative inexperience with
ASSU positions, Yelderman said he
sees it as a plus.

"We're not outside of the ASSU in
the sense that we don't know what
we're doing or we don't have leader
ship experience," he said. "I think we
are outside in the sense that the issues
we hope to address are outside of what
the ASSU normally does. Promulga-

lion of the same ASSU culture isn't
necessarily something we're com
mitted to doing. In fact we'd like to
see change in the ASSU."
As far as experience relevant to
the ASSU presidency, Yeldennan
cited his experience on University
committees, his resident assistant
position in Soto and his work, as
ASSU publications director.
Stockman said that his most rel
evant experience was with the alco
hol policy, as he was suspended
freshman year. He also did men
tion involvement in activities, in
cluding the Theta Delta Chi frater
nity.
"I think I'm an active member of
the community," Stockman said. "I
play for the lacrosse team. I've got
an ASSU shirt."
Both said they would make the
executive office a priority if elected.
"If we get elected, I don't think
we plan on having any other time

commitments," Yelderman said.
"Obviously this is the most impor
tant thing, and if given the oppor
tunity we'd do it — but that doesn't
mean if we lose we're going to sit
around and cry all year."
In terms of specific issues, Yel
derman and Stockman hope to
address a "general crackdown on
student culture," involving alco
hol policy, student space and di
versity.
"One of [my issues] is changing
the alcohol policy on campus, and
how they treat students," Stockman
said. "My belief is that people who
got into this school are pretty re
sponsible, pretty hardworking and
don't need to be harassed on week
ends. The enforcement of bike laws
would fall under that, too."
Stockman said his ultimate goal
"is to lower the drinking age to 18
on campus."
"You've got to have hopes," he
said. "You can't just aim for the
ASSU presidency and vice presi
dency, take your stipend and walk
away."
"Another part of that is loosen

ing the rules on fraternities," Yel
derman said.
Yelderman also noted that they
were against the war in Iraq, fo
cused on student space and sup
portive of affirmative action.
Stockman highlighted trans
portation issues.
"My aim is to use ASSU funds to
purchase a large fleet of suped up
golf carts, equipped with minibars,"
Stockman said. "They'll be yellow,
so you wouldn't mistake them."
"It'd be something of a pilot pro
gram at first, and we'd have to talk
about the minibars," Yelderman
said.
Yelderman and Stockman have
known each other since freshman
year, and think together they "bal
ance out our appeal to students."
"I think it's important for people
to understand that this is an elec
tion, and it's unusual that we have
two slates running, and I think it's
important for students to think
about what message they want to
send the campus and send to the
world," Yelderman said. "This is an
opportunity for change."
