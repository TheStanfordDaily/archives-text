# Vaden confronts SARS health risk
## 
### MATT ZAFRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the recent global concern over the spread of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly re
ferred to as "SARS," Vaden Health Center issued a
campus health advisory in which they explained the
illness and what can be done to protect against it.
While there is not a health emergency on campus, be
cause many at Stanford have traveled and travel to
SARS-afflicted areas, the center is encouraging com
munity members to become informed and take pre
cautions against the disease.
SARS is an illness with symptoms including a fever
and dry cough that is spread primarily through air
droplets, such as those from a cough or sneeze. It typ
ically affects those in close contact with infected people
such as family or health care workers.
Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singa
pore have been the most affected in recent months.
Ifowever, there have been cases reported throughout
the world, most connected to people who recently
traveled to Asia.
"Stanford has students and visitors from all over the
world," said Ira Friedman, director of the center. "In
addition, faculty, staff and students travel extensively.
"It's very important for students to be aware of de
velopments about SARS," he continued. "We are pre
pared to evaluate students with illness and possible ex
posure to SARS."
Vaden has advised all students to follow common
sense recommendations for avoiding transmission of
diseases, and students who have symptoms should re
port to the center.
"If a student has the criteria for SARS (travel to a
country where SARS is occurring or contact with a case
of SARS plus fever and cough or respiratory symp
toms], he or she will be referred to the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center Emergency Department,"
