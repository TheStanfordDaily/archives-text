# Vaden confronts SARS health risk
## 
### MATT ZAFRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the recent global concern over the spread of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly re
ferred to as "SARS," Vaden Health Center issued a
campus health advisory in which they explained the
illness and what can be done to protect against it.
While there is not a health emergency on campus, be
cause many at Stanford have traveled and travel to
SARS-afflicted areas, the center is encouraging com
munity members to become informed and take pre
cautions against the disease.
SARS is an illness with symptoms including a fever
and dry cough that is spread primarily through air
droplets, such as those from a cough or sneeze. It typ
ically affects those in close contact with infected people
such as family or health care workers.
Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singa
pore have been the most affected in recent months.
Ifowever, there have been cases reported throughout
the world, most connected to people who recently
traveled to Asia.
"Stanford has students and visitors from all over the
world," said Ira Friedman, director of the center. "In
addition, faculty, staff and students travel extensively.
"It's very important for students to be aware of de
velopments about SARS," he continued. "We are pre
pared to evaluate students with illness and possible ex
posure to SARS."
Vaden has advised all students to follow common
sense recommendations for avoiding transmission of
diseases, and students who have symptoms should re
port to the center.
"If a student has the criteria for SARS (travel to a
country where SARS is occurring or contact with a case
of SARS plus fever and cough or respiratory symp
toms], he or she will be referred to the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center Emergency Department,"

Friedman said. "There, he or she
will get definitive treatment in a set
ting which minimizes the risk of
transmission to other students and
patients."
The offices of Residential Edu
cation, Student Affairs, and the
center are on alert for potential
cases on campus, and Vaden has
placed a notice of the alert on its

Web site, along with links to the
Centers for Disease Control for
more information.
"We have been working closely
with the Santa Clara County Pub
lic Health Department, which is
the office that determines if an
outbreak has occurred and what
steps, such as isolation or quaran
tine, need to be taken," Friedman
said. "Vaden and the University
would work collaboratively with
them."
Junior Cheng Wang said he is
concerned about his family in

Hong Kong.
"They have to deal with all the
repercussions," he said. His broth
er's school is out of session and his
father wears a face mask to work,
while his mother does not want to
leave the house.
"It's a nagging worry in the back
of my head," he said. "I have con
cern about how they are doing."
Wang added, "I have friends
who weren't able to go home for
spring break."
Officially, there are no travel re
strictions in place related to SARS,

but the Center for Disease Control
has advised travelers to postpone
unessential trips to the affected
areas.
Freshman Solina Tith said, "I
have concern for individuals in
Asia, especially my family there, but
I feel confident this outbreak will
be contained."
Tith expressed concerns about
future trips to Asia.
"I plan to wait a few months be
fore reconsidering my travels
plans," she said. "There may be
new developments by then."
