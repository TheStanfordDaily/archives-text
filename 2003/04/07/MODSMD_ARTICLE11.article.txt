# Tech advocates warn of corporate Web control
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Worried that governments and
corporations will limit access to new
media technologies, labor activists,
technology advocates and indepen
dent radio broadcasters convened
on Saturday to discuss ways to keep
these technologies available.
About 50 participants attended
and spoke at "Access: Broadband
and the Digital Future — Who is in
Control?" whicli included work
shops dealing with issues from
"Workers' Rights and New Tech
nology" to "Defending Access to Al
ternative Media."
Todd Da vies, a symbolic systems
lecturer, helped organize the con
ference so that advocates from a
myriad of different issues could dis
cuss the different ways technologies
and activist movements intercon
nect.
Davies studies the uses of the In
ternet for democratic communities.
"My work always assumed that
everyone would have access," he
said.

The day-long conference dealt
with prerequisites and intertwining
forces that are necessary fora true
digital democracy, he said.
Participants attended work
shops run by representatives from a
wide variety of West Coast organi
zations.
Bay Area cable and television
unions discussed their bargaining
positions with different television
and radio conglomerates while
Richard Stallman, a prominent
open-source software advocate, dis
cussed how open-source software
related to broadening access to
technology around the world.
Dorothy Kidd, a media studies pro
fessor at the University of San Fran
cisco, spoke on efforts by the United
States to change cultural policies in
other countries for Hollywood's
benefit.
Karl Auerbach, the North Ameri
ca representative for the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers, the corporation that
oversees domain name registration,
or giving out ".com" addresses,
spoke of his dealings with corpora
tions that want to control the flow of
information on the Internet.

He said that the "neo-colonial
ism" of the Internet is similar to ef
forts by the government a century
ago to control ports important for
commerce.
"Why do you think we have a
base at Guantanamo Bay?" Auer
bach asked.
Auerbach explained that control

of the oceans was necessary to be
come a powerful country in the late
19th century. Due to currents and
trade winds, Guantanamo Bay was
an important point of control to se
cure access to the Caribbean Sea, so
the United States took Guan
tanamo in the Spanish-American
War as a chokepoint for commerce.

In much the same way, he said,
corporations are trying to control ac
cess to the Internet through various
chokepoints. National legislation
cannot deal with a global structure
like the Internet, so corporations are
trying to control portions of the Web
such as domain name registration
and routers that direct traffic.
"If you don't have a [domain]
name, you're pointless," he said.
The discussions ranged from
the redefinitions of patents and
trademarks to restricted access to
cable and radio, but the partici
pants agreed that the diverse ideas
complemented each other.
"[All these topics] do fit together,"
said senior symbolic systems major
Jeramie Scott. "From labor comes
the idea of organizing; technology is
used to organize ... [Activism] can't
happen without access.
"It's essential that people are
concerned about how [the media] is
controlled," Scott said.
"We want to defend the democ
ratic community for the people and
protect our access to these tech
nologies," said Steve Zeltzer, a labor
activist who helped organize the
conference. "We want to not just
complain about it, we want to
change it."
