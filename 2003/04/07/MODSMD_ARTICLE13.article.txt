What about North Korea?
Bursting the Bubble will present a panel on North Korea entitled
"What about North Korea?" on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Oak Room
in Tresidder.
Speakers are Management Science and Engineering Prof. William
Perry, former Secretary of Defense, and Sociology Prof. Gi-Wook Shin,
acting head of Asia / Pacific Research Center. The speakers will talk
about the past, present and future of North Korea and U.S. relations.
"Everyone is so preoccupied with war in Iraq, but there are a lot of
other important issues," said sophomore Nina Hsu, publicity coordina
tor for Bursting the Bubble. "North Korea has been overshadowed by
Iraq in the news. We thought it would be an interesting topic for students
because it is a timely topic."
Added sophomore Jenny Tolan, another coordinator of the panel,
"Bursting the Bubble Panels are meant to give basic information that stu
dents are usually too busy to find out, and also to be very interactive."
Dish hours extended
Yesterday, hours for use of the Dish were extended to accommodate
springtime hikers and joggers. The new schedule is 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
which extends usage by 2.5 hours.
The new hours were requested by users and recommended by the
Provost's Advisory Committee on Recreation Use of the Dish. The com
mittee was established in response to the University's Dish area conser
vation plan in 2000 and is made up of campus leaseholders, community
members and students.
Officials estimate that the Dish area receives more than 300,000 visi
tors annually.
