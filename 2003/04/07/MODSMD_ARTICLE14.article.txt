## Hussein urges Iraqi troops to continue battle 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam Hussein
urged Iraqi troops separated from their combat
units to join other squads to fend off the Ameri
cans, according to a statement read on TV that in
dicates disarray among the country's elite fight
ers.
The appeal came as Baghdad shook from con
tinued allied bombing.
At nightfall yesterday, long bursts of heavy
machine-gun fire and strong explosions rocked
the capital in what appeared to be a battle not far
from the city center.
The shriek of surface-to-surface missiles, the
pounding of artillery and bursts of what sounded
like heavy machine-gun fire grew in frequency
and intensity yesterday evening in the city's
southern approaches.
Just before 9 p.m., loud explosions and gun
fire were heard downtown, not far from the In
formation Ministry and a hotel where many
journalists are staying.
Intermittent explosions were heard through
out the night in Baghdad, along with periodic
anti-aircraft fire. Shortly before dawn, aircraft
could be heard over Baghdad and a series of
heavier explosions shook downtown buildings,
echoing from the southern outskirts of the city.
Prayers broadcast from Baghdad's mosques fil
tered through the din of battle. "God is great and
to him we owe thanks," clerics intoned every time
the city came under attack.
Two hours later, Baghdad was quiet, with oc
casional light weapons and missile fire. Explo
sions could be heard in the distance.
To the south of the capital, U.S. forces took
control of the center of the holy city of Karbala
yesterday after block by block fighting, the Army
Times newspaper reported from the scene.
