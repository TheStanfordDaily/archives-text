# N. Korea refuses U.N. talks

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” North Korea
yesterday rejected the U.N. Security Council's
plan to discuss the standoff over its suspected
nuclear weapons development, calling it"a
prelude to war."
South Korea's Unification Ministry also an
nounced that Cabinet-level talks with the com
munist North were canceled after Pyongyang
failed to confirm the meetings.
Seoul had hoped to try to persuade its com
munist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear
weapons program and the cancelation was a
setback for South Korean efforts to keep a lid
on tensions between Washington and Py
ongyang.
It also came ahead of a meeting Wednesday
of the 15-nation U.N. Security Council to dis
cuss North Korea's nuclear program.

The council could eventually discuss impos
ing sanctions against North Korea, if a political
solution is not found. China and Russia have
said they oppose sanctions.
North Korea has warned that it would re
gard international sanctions against its isolated
regime as a declaration of war.
The U.N. discussions are "a grave provo
cation act intended to scuttle all (the North's)
effort for dialogue and aggravate the situa
tion on the Korean Peninsula," a North Ko
rean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quot
ed as saying by state-run news agency KCNA
yesterday.
The Security Council's "handling of the
nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself
is precisely a prelude to war," the
spokesman said.
