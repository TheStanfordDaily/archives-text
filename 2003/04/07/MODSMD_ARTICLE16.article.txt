# V. Tech reinstates affirm, action

BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) â€” Virginia Tech
reinstated its affirmative action policy yesterday,
despite assertions from the attorney general's of
fice that some of its diversity programs are un
constitutional.
The school's Board of Visitors voted 8-5 to re
scind a March 10 ban on preferences for racial
minorities and other underrepresented groups
in hiring, admissions and scholarships.
The vote came after a four-hour meeting
punctuated by outbursts from a crowd of about
250 people, most supporters of affirmative ac
tion. The board called yesterday's special meet
ing after weeks of protest over its resolution in
closed session to dismantle affirmative action.
"We love diversity as much as you do," Vice
Rector William Latham said to a chorus of hissing
from the crowd. "But we have to do it within the
framework of the law, and you only have to do it
politically."
The board also created a committee yesterday

to review Tech's diversity programs and make
sure they don't violate the Constitution.
Attorney General Jerry Kilgore will continue
examining diversity policies at Tech and other
schools, spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. "If they
have programs that continue to be based on race,
then yes, they are" acting illegally, he said. "That
would be unfortunate."
Several board members lamented that their
earlier decision came too quickly, and that they
should have waited for guidance from the U.S.
Supreme Court to rule on affirmative action poli
cies at the University of Michigan.
Others said they changed their mind after re
alizing there were other interpretations of feder
al law that may allow the school to continue its di
versity policies.
"We may have been naive," said board mem
ber Ben Davenport Jr., who voted in favor of re
scinding the ban. "In our previous discussion, we
didn't talk about the Supreme Court case."
