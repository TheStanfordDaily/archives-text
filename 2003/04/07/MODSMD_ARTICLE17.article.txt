## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Special considerations 
### 
One of the ASSU's major cam
paigns for this year was reducing
the cost of living for Stanford stu
dents. To that end, student lead
ers have already begun working on simple
efforts to diminish everyday concerns such
as laundry fees and meal plan costs. But
judging from the exorbitant amount of spe
cial-fee groups on the 2003 ballot, the ASSU
has failed to keep its promise, most notably
in an area which it has the power and re
sponsibility to control.
Stanford undergraduates currently
pay for special-fee groups that offer com
munity service and programming activi
ties. Next year's costs could run upwards
of $225 — that's $75 per quarter. While
this is slightly less than the current year's

costs, it is still outra
geous.
Tomorrow stu
dents will vote on
whether special-fee
groups will receive
funding from the
student body, and
we strongly encour
age everyone to
carefully evaluate
how each group
would use the spe
cial-fee money.
The purpose of a
special fee is to pro
vide additional, or
in some cases, the
only, support for
certain student
groups. Special fees
should be awarded
to groups that use
their money careful

ly and are open to everyone in the com
munity (because every student is assessed
a fee on his or her bill).
This year's ASSU has allowed too many
groups on the ballot. According to one
member of the ASSU appropriations com
mittee, the philosophy of the committee
and the Undergraduate Senate, which ap
proves the ballot, is that a student group
should produce a reasonable budget for
the activity it is planning. But the ASSU
has said it will not play a role in blocking
student groups or judging the value of a
student group, because that is for the vot
ers to decide.
Unfortunately, such a position does lit
tle to serve the student body. The people
in the ASSU who review special fees have
more access to budgets and information
about each group than the typical student
ever will. Student voters need additional
information from the ASSU, which means
the ASSU should take a greater responsi
bility when determining what should ap
pear on the ballot.

The student body election is one of
the few times every year when stu
dents make their voices heard. The
ASSU has become lax in its efforts
to encourage voter participation.
Unless the current situation
changeSy students will have to con
tinue paying — in more ways than
one — for poor performance.

The ASSU needs to help students eval
uate whether assessing a special fee on the
bills of all students is the best way to fund
a particular student group. The associa
tion should not put the burden of making
decisions on the voters, because when vot
ers don't know how a group uses its
money, they are likely to vote yes, think
ing "Why not, it's only $1.75?" Those lit
tle amounts add up until the cost becomes
unfair and unbearable to many students.
In terms of providing information, the
ASSU has shown during the past few weeks
that the 2003 election is simply not a prior
ity. We are disappointed that the ASSU
elections commission waited until two days
before the election to post information
about student groups and their budgets on

the elections Web
site. At press time,
there was no link to
the elections site
from the ASSU main
page-
Furthermore, the
elections handbook
is difficult to read
— to learn about a
group, students
must download a
Word or Excel doc
ument and then
open it up. Because
there were so many
special fees groups
on this year's ballot,
the ASSU said it
would take too
much time to con
vert everything to
an html format.

We appreciate the
desire to get information out as quickly as
possible, but if the information is hard to
read, who's going to use it at all?
The commission bears some responsibil
ity in making sure students are engaged
and informed come election day. ASSU
members say problems within the ASSU
forced them to choose an elections com
missioner at the last minute — mid-Febru
ary — this year. But because the ASSU
knew, for nearly a year, that it had to find
a new team, why did it wait so long?
The student body election is one of the
few times every year when students make
their voices heard. The ASSU has become
lax in its efforts to encourage voter partic
ipation. Unless the current situations
changes, students will have to continue
paying — in more ways than one — for
poor performance.
We hope that the current ASSU candi
dates see how irresponsible behavior
taints the entire elections process. And we
hope to see a better organized election
next year.

only, support for
certain student
groups. Special fees
should be awarded
to groups that use
their money careful

ly and are open to everyone in the com
munity (because every student is assessed
a fee on his or her bill).
This year's ASSU has allowed too many
groups on the ballot. According to one
member of the ASSU appropriations com
mittee, the philosophy of the committee
and the Undergraduate Senate, which ap
proves the ballot, is that a student group
should produce a reasonable budget for
the activity it is planning. But the ASSU
has said it will not play a role in blocking
student groups or judging the value of a
student group, because that is for the vot
ers to decide.
Unfortunately, such a position does lit
tle to serve the student body. The people
in the ASSU who review special fees have
more access to budgets and information
about each group than the typical student
ever will. Student voters need additional
information from the ASSU, which means
the ASSU should take a greater responsi
bility when determining what should ap
pear on the ballot.

The student body election is one of
the few times every year when stu
dents make their voices heard. The
ASSU has become lax in its efforts
to encourage voter participation.
Unless the current situation
changeSy students will have to con
tinue paying — in more ways than
one — for poor performance.

The ASSU needs to help students eval
uate whether assessing a special fee on the
bills of all students is the best way to fund
a particular student group. The associa
tion should not put the burden of making
decisions on the voters, because when vot
ers don't know how a group uses its
money, they are likely to vote yes, think
ing "Why not, it's only $1.75?" Those lit
tle amounts add up until the cost becomes
unfair and unbearable to many students.
In terms of providing information, the
ASSU has shown during the past few weeks
that the 2003 election is simply not a prior
ity. We are disappointed that the ASSU
elections commission waited until two days
before the election to post information
about student groups and their budgets on

the elections Web
site. At press time,
there was no link to
the elections site
from the ASSU main
page-
Furthermore, the
elections handbook
is difficult to read
— to learn about a
group, students
must download a
Word or Excel doc
ument and then
open it up. Because
there were so many
special fees groups
on this year's ballot,
the ASSU said it
would take too
much time to con
vert everything to
an html format.

We appreciate the
desire to get information out as quickly as
possible, but if the information is hard to
read, who's going to use it at all?
The commission bears some responsibil
ity in making sure students are engaged
and informed come election day. ASSU
members say problems within the ASSU
forced them to choose an elections com
missioner at the last minute — mid-Febru
ary — this year. But because the ASSU
knew, for nearly a year, that it had to find
a new team, why did it wait so long?
The student body election is one of the
few times every year when students make
their voices heard. The ASSU has become
lax in its efforts to encourage voter partic
ipation. Unless the current situations
changes, students will have to continue
paying — in more ways than one — for
poor performance.
We hope that the current ASSU candi
dates see how irresponsible behavior
taints the entire elections process. And we
hope to see a better organized election
next year.
