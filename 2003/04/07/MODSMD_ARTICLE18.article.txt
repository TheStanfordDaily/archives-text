# LETS GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## See you at the crossroads 
### 
Anyone who lies down in
the middle of a crowded
intersection and faces
certain arrest must have
a good reason to, right? As radical
anti-war activists have demonstrat
ed in the past few weeks, extreme
behavior is not always justified.
Despite what you may have
read in the editorials or seen
spray-painted on a sheet in White
Plaza, the simple fact is that what
ever your opinions were before
the bombing started, continued
opposition to the war completely
ignores reality.
Any trip to the corner of El
Camino and Embarcadero reveals
the completely inane nature of the
protesters at the Town and Coun
try Center, who ask passers-by to
"honk for peace." Well, the fact of
the matter is, no amount of honk
ing will produce peace, because we
already happen to be at war. We
might pose other questions about
these demonstrators, wondering
why they are not at work (maybe
they are teaching assistants who
work for professors who give them
the afternoon off to go protest) or
why they drag their 4-year-old
children along (maybe the kids
have worse social skills than Sad
dam Hussein and cannot schedule
a play date), but doing so only dis
tracts us from our true purpose
here: debunking the arguments of
protesters.
Perhaps the most general ques
tion opponents to the war ask is:
"Why Iraq instead of some other
country?" It is true that there are
several countries out there with
dictators just as bad as Saddam
Hussein (no, Michael Moore,
George Bush is not one of them)
and that there are other states that
pose a more immediate threat to
our security. Reality dictates that
the United States has limited re
sources and can only devote them
to so many causes. While it would
be nice to topple every oppressive
regime, such a feat is simply not
feasible. Worse still, some coun
tries, such as North Korea, though
they may be a far greater threat to
our security, cannot be met by
force. Doing so would unleash a
humanitarian disaster of untold
proportions, which would make
the current situation seem as pain
less as Nadiya Figueroa's route to
the pre-eminent post in the ASSU.
Speaking of important matters
of state that concern all Stanford
students, another argument
against the war is that it affects our
interests around the world. What
ever you may have thought about

the pitfalls of "going it alone," the
premature pullout that protesters
seem to be calling for would leave a
stain on our diplomatic record. If
we left Iraq now, our foreign affairs
standing would be far worse than
when we went in, further weaken
ing world opinion of the United
States. In addition, we would be
sending a message to our future en
emies that we do not have the back
bone to "see it through," much as
our cowardice following the Battle
of the Black Sea in Somalia em
boldened the perpetrators of the
Rwandan genocide.

".. the simple fact is that
whatever your opinions
were before the bombing
started, continued oppo
sition to the war com
pletely ignores reality"

And while we are on the subject
of crimes against humanity, let us
remember that Saddam Hussein
truly is an evil dictator who op
presses his own people. No matter
what one may say about how we
have gotten to this point or what
President Bush's motivations are,
it is undeniable that on some fun
damental level we are doing the
right thing in Iraq. Protesters

would have us believe that the lack
of a popular uprising against Hus
sein is evidence that the Iraqis do
not hate him as much as the Bush
administration alluded to. A more
likely scenario is that the Iraqi peo
ple are afraid to rise up against
Hussein. Considering the reper
cussions of such an attempt during
the first Gulf War, it is logical that
Iraqis are slow to trust the United
States, when the former President
Bush left them high-and-dry.
This understandable fear stems
from 30 years of experience, living
under the fist of Hussein. This
man is someone who has used
chemical weapons against his own
people, commissions men to serve
as rapists for the government and
conducts widespread terror cam
paigns that we have only begun to
uncover, as is evidenced by the dis
covery this weekend of a ware
house full of human remains.
Once we have removed Hus
sein from power, our task will have
just begun. We must rebuild Iraq,
creating a new democratic state
that will respect the inalienable
rights of life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness. Our success in
finishing what we have started is
the only way the protesters will
ever see their true goals reached,
be they the redemption of Ameri
can foreign policy or the best life
possible for the residents of Iraq.

If you th ink you can convince us that
Saddam Hussein is justified in making
pregnant women suicide bombers,
here's where you reach us: eym@stan
ford.edu and akendall@stanford.edu.

George Bush is not one of them)
and that there are other states that
pose a more immediate threat to
our security. Reality dictates that
the United States has limited re
sources and can only devote them
to so many causes. While it would
be nice to topple every oppressive
regime, such a feat is simply not
feasible. Worse still, some coun
tries, such as North Korea, though
they may be a far greater threat to
our security, cannot be met by
force. Doing so would unleash a
humanitarian disaster of untold
proportions, which would make
the current situation seem as pain
less as Nadiya Figueroa's route to
the pre-eminent post in the ASSU.
Speaking of important matters
of state that concern all Stanford
students, another argument
against the war is that it affects our
interests around the world. What
ever you may have thought about

the pitfalls of "going it alone," the
premature pullout that protesters
seem to be calling for would leave a
stain on our diplomatic record. If
we left Iraq now, our foreign affairs
standing would be far worse than
when we went in, further weaken
ing world opinion of the United
States. In addition, we would be
sending a message to our future en
emies that we do not have the back
bone to "see it through," much as
our cowardice following the Battle
of the Black Sea in Somalia em
boldened the perpetrators of the
Rwandan genocide.

".. the simple fact is that
whatever your opinions
were before the bombing
started, continued oppo
sition to the war com
pletely ignores reality"

And while we are on the subject
of crimes against humanity, let us
remember that Saddam Hussein
truly is an evil dictator who op
presses his own people. No matter
what one may say about how we
have gotten to this point or what
President Bush's motivations are,
it is undeniable that on some fun
damental level we are doing the
right thing in Iraq. Protesters

would have us believe that the lack
of a popular uprising against Hus
sein is evidence that the Iraqis do
not hate him as much as the Bush
administration alluded to. A more
likely scenario is that the Iraqi peo
ple are afraid to rise up against
Hussein. Considering the reper
cussions of such an attempt during
the first Gulf War, it is logical that
Iraqis are slow to trust the United
States, when the former President
Bush left them high-and-dry.
This understandable fear stems
from 30 years of experience, living
under the fist of Hussein. This
man is someone who has used
chemical weapons against his own
people, commissions men to serve
as rapists for the government and
conducts widespread terror cam
paigns that we have only begun to
uncover, as is evidenced by the dis
covery this weekend of a ware
house full of human remains.
Once we have removed Hus
sein from power, our task will have
just begun. We must rebuild Iraq,
creating a new democratic state
that will respect the inalienable
rights of life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness. Our success in
finishing what we have started is
the only way the protesters will
ever see their true goals reached,
be they the redemption of Ameri
can foreign policy or the best life
possible for the residents of Iraq.

If you th ink you can convince us that
Saddam Hussein is justified in making
pregnant women suicide bombers,
