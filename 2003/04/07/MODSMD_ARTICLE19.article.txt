Clarification on the retirement statistics
We would like to clarify the major
points in our discussion of faculty retire
ment issues at last Thursday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, the subject of the article,
"FacSen hears retirement issues" (April 4).
We presented a report on the im
pact of the end of mandatory faculty re
tirement and of faculty retirement incen
tive programs on faculty age demograph
ics both at Stanford and elsewhere.
Data for Stanford faculty showed that
the average age of our faculty increased
from 47.6 in 1992-93, just before the end
of mandatory retirement at age 70, to 49.3
this year. Only 48 (2.8 percent) of the fac
ulty are age 70 or over.
The data suggest that the faculty retire
ment incentive program has played a role
in the decisions of some faculty to retire
before age 70, although many factors af
fect faculty decisions about retirement.
Nationally there has been a striking
change in the age composition of universi
ty faculty in the last 20 years, including a
marked increase in the 44 to 49 age group
and a decline in the percentage of faculty
under 40. However, the change cannot be

directly attributed to the elimination of
mandator)' faculty retirement; for exam
ple, some of it may have to do with hiring
increases for teaching the baby boom gen
eration.
Another marked change has been in
the rate of retention of faculty aged 70 or
over. With mandatory retirement, only 7
percent of those working at age 70 at pri
vate research universities were still work
ing at 73; that number is now 41 percent.
Retirement incentive programs
— like Stanford's for faculty ages 60 to 69
— may help to mitigate the effects on the
age structure of the faculty of having no
mandatory retirement.

Student votes may not make a difference
in current political situation
Although the editorial "Why student
voice matters" (April 3) was correct in
principle about President George W.
Bush listening to college students, it
lacked a rudimentary understanding of
politics. First of all, we are in California,

which, after the 2002 election, means com
plete political irrelevance with the Repub
lican Party for at least the next four to five
years (and probably much longer).
Additionally, the statement that "college
students will vote in [the 2004] election" is
simply laughable. On a completely unrelat
ed note, United States citizens have indeed
influenced their policy makers, with a sub
stantial majority in favor of the war.
In the end, if not satisfied with the basic
tenets of politics and if an adequate re
sponse to the protests by an elected leader
is still desired, I suggest www.number
10.gov.uk, a British Web site.

Campaign banner is a
'gross public eyesore'
We are writing to express our disgust for
the gross public eyesores inflicted upon the
campus by the Figueroa / Natoli campaign.
While there are many examples of poor
campaign decision-making across campus,
we find the comically large banner tied
across Campus Drive between Bob and
Grove Lasuen houses to be one of the most
appalling instances of aesthetic disregard in
the history of tasteless campaign tactics.

While we admit the sign is something of
a feat of both engineering and sheer self
motivated determination, we question the
need for such material atrocities. We ask
our opponents: Why do you need to erect
such grandiose shrines to your own name?
Have we put up more than a handful of
Yelderman / Stockman fliers in the hum
blest of locations? Have we made any hint
that we intend to impinge upon your al
most unrivaled hold on the public sign
space on campus? Have we done anything
but tell the student body what we want to
do as ASSU president advice president?
What, you guardians of the ASSU of
yesteryear, are you so afraid of?
From the beginning, we have been de
liberate and explicit in avoiding those
means of campaigning which we think de
tract from discussion of real issues, which
make the contest a battle of pocketbooks
and which make the campus a disgusting
place to live fora week. We have no idea
what has prompted candidates to take an
unprecedented step in all the wrong di
rections, but regardless, we condemn it
and refuse to follow.
