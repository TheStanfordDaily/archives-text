# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## U.S. troops not blindly following orders, but serving nation 
### DEREK FEARS GUEST COLUMNIST 
I am writing this column in response
to much of the liberal criticism as of yet,
but particularly in response to the addi
tion to Harry Haladjian's letter "Anti-war
protesters are the real 'troops'" (April 3).
First, I would like to state that I am not
an unconditional supporter of President
George W. Bush's policy toward Iraq. I
believe he has made mistakes and I iden
tify with some of the criticisms of the con
servative stance.
With that said, I must say that I am
nevertheless appalled by the letter that
Haladjian wrote, especially when he stat
ed that he wholeheartedly supports the
protesters and not the troops in battle,
which he describes as "blindly following

the orders of a government at fault."
I am stupefied by the lack of consider
ation of the comments expressed in the
letter. To assume that the troops in battle
are blindly following orders is an inap
propriate offense to the intelligence of
those in combat who willingly put their
lives on the line.
Who can really say that such troops are
"blindly" going into battle? Is it not possi
ble that the troops have weighed the is
sues inherent to this war and have decid
ed for themselves that there is merit in
fighting? Why should anyone be so cate
gorical in the assumption that those who
express beliefs contrary to his are doing
so "blindly"?
The war in Iraq is an extremely com
plex subject and it amazes me that some
one at Stanford could lack so much un

derstanding of the issues at question. Ha
ladjian refers to the city protesters as the
"real troops," who I assume he would
argue are not "blind." While I believe
that a core group of protesters are in
formed individuals making a political
statement to their government and coun
try, many simply are not.
Just look at that the recent demon
strations in San Francisco. While some
who were interviewed by the media no
doubt articulated well-thought-out posi
tions, others actually replied that the
only reason we are fighting in Iraq is "so
that Bush can steal Iraqi oil." Such a
statement fails miserably in summing up
the complexities of the war in Iraq. Is
such a protester, then, not just "blindly"
following the crowd into the streets of
San Francisco?

I find it quite ironic that some people
can so easily praise the protesters in the
United States while condemning the
troops that will bring the right to protest
to Iraq. Without the involvement of the
United States, the Iraqi people will con
tinue to be oppressed and tortured.
Those who exercise free speech will be
murdered along with their families. In
today's world, I believe there is no room
for such antiquated dictatorial regimes.
I hope the views expressed here do
not represent those of the liberal commu
nity on this campus. However, I take
pride in the fact that people have free
dom to express their views, regardless of
the content. The Iraqi people do not
have such an opportunity.
The letter states that the troops sup
ported "are the ones on the streets . . .

shutting down business as usual and risk
ing arrest to voice their opposition." But
the troops I support are the ones in the
desert, risking life and limb to bring peo
ple a freedom that is long overdue.
As I'm sure you know, Edmond Burke
once said that "the only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil is for good men to
do nothing." This will be the 24th year of
Hussein's evil domination of his country.
Nothing has been done for far too long. I
believe that people can criticize the argu
ments of those with whom they disagree.
Yet they should not insult the intelli
gence of our men and women who are so
bravely trying to finally do something.
