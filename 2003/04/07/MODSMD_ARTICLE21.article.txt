## Baseball tops Cougs twice Sunday game snowed-in, prompting postponement of third game until today 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Heading into the weekend in Pullman,
Wash., only one thing — snow — could
keep No. 4 Stanford from taking all three
conference games from the overmatched
Washington State Cougars.
Yesterday, it did.
After the Cardinal (20-10, 6-2 Pacific 10
Conference) plowed through the Cougars
(9-21, 1-4 Pac-10) on Friday and Saturday,
6-1 and 12-5, a Sunday snowstorm caused
the teams to postpone the series finale to
this morning at 11 a.m.
Stanford will have to wait one more day
to in its quest for its third series sweep of
the season.
On the bright side, the team got a free
day yesterday to explore the wonders of
Moscow, Idaho, where the Cardinal's hotel
is located near the Washington border.
(OK, maybe there is no bright side.)

Friday afternoon, Stanford played like a
team conscious of both its need fora win
and the weather. In a game that went just
one minute past the two-hour mark, the
Cardinal's junior ace John Hudgins threw
his second complete game of the season, al
lowing just seven hits and one run while
fanning six Cougar batters.
"That's a pitcher's dream," Hudgins
said after his first victory since beating Cal
ifornia 28 days before. "It's tough to get out
of your rhythm in a game that moves as
quickly as this one did."
Stanford took advantage of its opportu
nities at the plate and, once the game was
in hand after a four-run sixth, brought just
10 men to the plate in the final three in
nings in a race against the cold.
With Hudgins on cruise control and the
Pullman darkness descending on the late
afternoon start, the Cardinal couldn't have
hand-picked a better game through which
to speed.
After putting up single runs in the third
and fourth, Stanford jumped on Washing
ton State starter Pony Banaszek's miscues
in the sixth to win the ballgame.

Junior outfielder Carlos Quentin and his Stanford baseball teammates had no problems flex
ing their collective muscles this weekend in a pair of wins over Washington State.
Banaszek walked two and hit two
Stanford batters in the inning and
also suffered from a misplayed
two-out pop-up in foul territory by
his catcher.
The Cougar starter beaned se
nior Tobin Swope with the bases
loaded to start the scoring, then
watched as catcher Jon Baeder
failed to grab junior Johnny Ash's
foul pop. Ash took advantage of
his new life, beating out an infield
grounder to put two more runs
across.
Freshman Jed Lowrie then
came through with an RBI single
to put the Cardinal ahead 6-0, and
Stanford headed for the warmth
of the team bus.
"We were fortunate offensively
today," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "We got a little lucky,
but we bunched the runs together
when we had to."
The next day, Stanford pound
ed out 17 hits in a romp of the
Cougars, led by senior Ryan
Garko's pair of home runs and
four RBI. Juniors Carlos Quentin
and Sam Fuld kept alive their 18-
and 14-game hit streaks as well.
"I was very happy with the way
we swung (he bats again today,"
Marquess said. "Some of our more
experienced players have led our
recent offensive surge and that's
one of the things you need to have
happen if your team is going to
contend for championships."
The Cardinal took another step
towards one of the championships
of which Marquess speaks with the

two wins in Washington, moving
into sole possession of the Pac-10
lead.
Quentin extended his career
high streak with a 4-for-5 day,
adding three RBI and a double to
the offensive cause. The junior is
batting .493 during the run, leads
the team with a .416 average and
has five multiple-hit games in his
last six contests.
Fuld, Quentin's outfield neigh
bor, has a.478 average during his
14-game stretch and now leads the
team in hits (48) and runs (32).
On Saturday, three more Car
dinal added a pair of hits to the
output of the potent Stanford trio
of Garko, Quentin and Fuld.
A four-run Stanford first inning
— highlighted by Garko's first
homer — didn't scare off the
Cougars immediately, as Wash
ington State responded with four
runs of its own in the bottom half
of the frame.
Unfortunately for the Cougars,
their afternoon just about ended
when the Cardinal's began.
Stanford took the lead for good
in the fourth with an RBI single
from Quentin, putting it ahead 5-4.
One inning later, an RBI ground
out by freshman John Mayberry jr.
and a wild pitch stretched the Stan
ford lead to three.
Garko provided the fireworks
of the day and capped the Cardi
nal scoring with a towering two
run shot in the eighth over the left
field wall, making it 12-4.
The two teams meet again this
morning, with Stanford looking
for the sweep, and then the Cardi
nal travel home to face Santa Clara
in a non-conference night game
tomorrow at 7 p.m.
