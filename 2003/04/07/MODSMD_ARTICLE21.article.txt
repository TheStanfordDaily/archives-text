## Baseball tops Cougs twice Sunday game snowed-in, prompting postponement of third game until today 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Heading into the weekend in Pullman,
Wash., only one thing — snow — could
keep No. 4 Stanford from taking all three
conference games from the overmatched
Washington State Cougars.
Yesterday, it did.
After the Cardinal (20-10, 6-2 Pacific 10
Conference) plowed through the Cougars
(9-21, 1-4 Pac-10) on Friday and Saturday,
6-1 and 12-5, a Sunday snowstorm caused
the teams to postpone the series finale to
this morning at 11 a.m.
Stanford will have to wait one more day
to in its quest for its third series sweep of
the season.
On the bright side, the team got a free
day yesterday to explore the wonders of
Moscow, Idaho, where the Cardinal's hotel
is located near the Washington border.
(OK, maybe there is no bright side.)

Friday afternoon, Stanford played like a
team conscious of both its need fora win
and the weather. In a game that went just
one minute past the two-hour mark, the
Cardinal's junior ace John Hudgins threw
his second complete game of the season, al
lowing just seven hits and one run while
fanning six Cougar batters.
"That's a pitcher's dream," Hudgins
said after his first victory since beating Cal
ifornia 28 days before. "It's tough to get out
of your rhythm in a game that moves as
quickly as this one did."
Stanford took advantage of its opportu
nities at the plate and, once the game was
in hand after a four-run sixth, brought just
10 men to the plate in the final three in
nings in a race against the cold.
With Hudgins on cruise control and the
Pullman darkness descending on the late
afternoon start, the Cardinal couldn't have
hand-picked a better game through which
to speed.
After putting up single runs in the third
and fourth, Stanford jumped on Washing
ton State starter Pony Banaszek's miscues
in the sixth to win the ballgame.

Junior outfielder Carlos Quentin and his Stanford baseball teammates had no problems flex
ing their collective muscles this weekend in a pair of wins over Washington State.
