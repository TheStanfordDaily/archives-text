# Card looks for more consistency
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Blake Mastalir's story isn't unlike
many of today's up-and-coming golfers
following in the footsteps of Stanford
alum and PGA Tour star Tiger Woods.
Mastalir, a junior on the Cardinal
men's golf team, picked up a club as
soon as he could walk and worked on his
game religiously.
He emerged as a star on the Cherry
Creek high school golf team in Engle
wood, Colorado. By his senior year, the
team captain was on the verge of leading
his squad to a state golf title until a little
mishap cost his team the crown.
At the end of the final day, Cherry
Creek had the tournament won by at
least 10 strokes.
But through a series of mishaps, a
freshman teammate signed his score
card without realizing that it had been
filled out incorrectly. The transgression
resulted in a disqualification for the
freshman, and a second-place finish for
Mastalir's team.
"It was amazing: the news had inter
viewed him," Mastalir said. "We had al
ready dumped a big bucket of water
over his head.
"So many things had to go wrong for
him to sign that card ..."
And you might say there have been a
number of things going wrong for
Mastalir's golf team this year, too.
Outside of seniors Jim Seki and Ron
Won, the Cardinal has struggled to con
sistently put together solid rounds of
golf in the same event.
Today, Stanford will try to start turn
ing things around at the 57th .Annual
Western Intercollegiate in San Jose. The
54-hole event takes place at the famed
6,445-yard par 70 Pasatiempo Country
Club.
Teams will play two rounds on Mon
day, followed by a final 18 holes the next
day.
Mastalir has been one of the many
culprits of inconsistency that has
plagued the Cardinal all year.
He started the season with a solid
sixth-place finish at the Windon Memo
rial Classic, but since then has fallen into
a three-months-plus slump.
Nonetheless, he remains optimistic
about his own play, as well as that of the
team.
"It's been tough, but you can't get too
far ahead of yourself," he said. "You just
have to take one event at a time and do
your best and see what happens."
The Stanford lineup remains largely
unchanged from the one that coach Jeff
Mitchell sent to the Oregon Duck Invi
tational two weeks ago.
Won and senior George Downing will
play again, along with Mastalir.
Sophomore Kevin Blue will spell fel
low sophomore Pat Phillips, who himself
struggled at the Oregon Invitational.
One large concern for the Cardinal
will be the health of Seki. Although he
has been the team's unquestioned
leader all year long, Seki has battled
back trouble off-and-on the entire year,

withdrawing before the Oregon event
with back spasms.
"Jim is a day-to-day question mark,"
Mitchell said. "He is receiving treatment
on a continuous basis."
Stanford will be fighting a few recent
demons out at Pasatiempo. A year ago in
the same event, the Cardinal finished
14th place (out of 17 teams) as much of
the squad struggled to be consistent on
the course.
"I know I didn't play particularly well
there last year," Mastalir said. "You
know the greens are going to be [ex
tremely difficult] for the tournament.
"A good short game is going to be real
ly important in putting up a solid score."
The Cardinal will face a strong field,

including No. 11 UCLA and No. 19
Washington â€” both ranked nationally in
the latest Sagarin / Golfweek rankings.
The Bruins have been a model of
consistency all year long, placing no
lower than fifth in an event this year.
Washington, on the other hand, has
been up and down during the spring
season.
For example, last week (as the Cardinal
sat idle) the Huskies struggled to a ninth
place finish at the National Invitational.
However, the week before, Washing
ton tore away from Stanford and nearly
everyone else in the field to tie for first at
the Oregon Duck Invitational.

spring season back on track in today's Western Intercollegiate Tournament in San Jose.
