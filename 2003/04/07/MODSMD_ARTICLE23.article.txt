### MIKE SCOTTO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't supposed to be that easy for the Stanford
women's tennis team.
The Cardinal — faced with arguably its most chal
lenging road trip of the season in Los Angeles — es
caped the weekend with two impressive wins.
No. 2 Stanford (15-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
dispatched ofboth top-ranked USC and No. 7 UCLA
without much trouble and ran its win-streak to a
whopping 13 games.
It beat USC 5-2 and UCLA 6-1.
The two wins should propel Stanford to the top of the
national polls when they are released on Wednesday.
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal was successfully
able to avoid a letdown against the Bruins (12-7, 3-1)
after posting its biggest win of the season against the
No. 1 Trojans.
The Cardinal quickly captured the doubles point
with a sweep of the three matches. Freshmen Alice
Barnes and Amber Liu drove the doubles dominance
at the No. 2 spot with an 8-2 win over Sarah Gregg
and Susi Wild of UCLA.
Liu continued her recent hot streak and led the
singles charge with a 6-0, 7-5, defeat of the No. 10
ranked player in the country, Sara Walker.
The Stanford freshman has won nine-straight
matches dating back to Feb. 22, when she last lost to
Raquel Kops-Jones of California.

Junior Erin Burdette posted a convincing
straight-set victory over Wild, 6-1, 6-3, at No. 3 sin
gles, while Barnes beat Feriel Esseghir, 6-4, 7-6 (5) at
No. 4 singles.
Junior Emilia Anderson also captured a straight
set win at No. 5 singles, 7-6 (7), 6-1 over Gregg, while
sophomore Story Tweedie-Yates rounded out the
Cardinal victory with a three-set defeat of Laura Gor
don, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.
(The only Stanford loss came at No. 2 singles,
where junior Lauren Barnikow fell to No. 23 Jackie
Carleton, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.)
No. 2 Stanford (15-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 conference)
began the weekend impressively with an upset of
top-ranked USC (17-2,4-0 Pac-10).
The Cardinal's victory snapped a USC 12-game
winning streak.
The day began with a rocky start from the Cardi
nal, who dropped the doubles point in close-fought
matchups. Although the top Stanford doubles team
of Barnikow and Burdette — ranked No. 2 in the
country — defeated No. 18 Tiffany Brymer and
Jewel Peterson, 8-6.
The Cardinal dropped the other two doubles
matches and the point.
But Stanford made up for it with a dominating
singles performance.
In a matchup of the fifth- and sixth-ranked players
nationally, Stanford freshman Amber Liu (No. 5) over
whelmingly beat Jewel Peterson (No. 6) at the top sin
gles spot, 6-2,6-2.
