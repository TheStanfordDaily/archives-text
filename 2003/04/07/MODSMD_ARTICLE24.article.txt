# Card men's tennis win-streak ends at 10
## 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hope turned to frustration and
disappointment this weekend for
the No. 7 Stanford (15-3, 2-0 Pac
-10) men's tennis team as it split a
pair of home matches against Pac
-10 rivals No. 22 Southern Cal (12-
8,1-2) and No. 6 UCLA (17-2,3-0).
The Cardinal shut out defend
ing NCAA champion (JSC 7-0 on
Friday for its 10th consecutive vic
tory, but it could not keep the mo
mentum going as UCLA ended
the streak in a tight 5-2 decision on
Saturday.
The UCLA match was the most
heavily attended match of the year
to date at theTaube Family Tennis
Center.
Despite the crowd's boisterous
support for the Cardinal, UCLA
seized the early lead and held off
the Cardinal's frenzied comeback
bid.
The Bruins jumped to a 1-0
lead by winning the doubles point
and the Cardinal was forced to
play catch-up for the rest of the
day.
The first two doubles matches
were one-sided affairs. Senior All-
Americans David Martin and Scott
Lipsky (ranked No. 4 nationally)
dominated their opponents in an
8-4 victory on court one. On court
two, UCLA's Erfan Djahangiri and
Alberto Francis beat freshmen KC
Corkery and James Pade decisive
ly 8-3.
By the time the first two doubles
matches had finished, the third
and deciding match was knotted at
5-5 on court three. UCLA's Aaron
Yovan and Rodrigo Grilli secured

a service break to go up 7-5 and
then served out the match against
sophomores Phil Sheng and Sam
Warburg for an 8-5 win.
The dual-match had the mak
ings of a blowout victory for UCIA
as the Bruins won the first set in
five of the six singles matches and
took a 4-0 lead in the sixth match.
No. 12 Martin took on No. 9
Tobias Clemens on court one in
a matchup of two of the top play
ers in the country. With Martin
serving at 4-5, 30-30, Clemens
hit a backhand passing shot up
the line on the full run to stun
Martin. Clemens won the follow
ing point to take the first set 6-4,
then rolled to a quick 6-1 second
set win.
"He was dictating the points with
his pace and I wasn't dealing with it
that well," Martin said. "I started
pressing and made too many er
rors. He was just too good today."
On courts two and three, Lipsky
and Corkery lost their first sets 6-0
and 6-1, respectively. Both battled
back to tally the Cardinal's only
two points. Lipsky beat Grilli 0-6,
6-3,6-4 and Corkery defeated Dja
hangiri 1-6, 6-4, 6-1.
"Grilli plays such an unortho
dox style that it's hard to get used
to," Lipsky said. "He puts no pace
on the ball and in the first set I was
just over-hitting.
"I can't remember the last time
I lost a set 6-0.1 was able to get it to
gether and come back. But the win
means absolutely nothing to me
because our team lost."
On court four, Warburg fell be
hind 4-0 to open the match but

Senior All-American David Martin (and doubles partner Scott Lipsky) had no
trouble with UCLA themselves, but the rest of the Cardinal did, as the Stan
ford men's tennis team saw its 10-game winning streak halted in a 5-2 loss.
