# Card takes one of three
## 
### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford softball team endured a week
end of heartbreak â€” it lost two extra-inning
games to Oregon and Oregon State on back-to
back days.
But life could have been a whole lot worse
had the Cardinal bats not exploded Sunday.
The No. 13 Cardinal (28-14, 2-4) salvaged a
game weekend series with a 10-1 victory over
the Beavers (25-18, 1-6) for its second confer
ence victory of the season.
Junior pitcher Dana Sorensen (13-5) scat
tered three hits over five innings and struck out
three in one of her less-dominating outings of
the season.
Seven different players recorded hits. Fresh
men Catalina Morris and Lauren Lappin, se
nior Kira Ching and junior first baseman
Michelle Thiry had two hits apiece.
Lappin and senior Cassi Brangham racked
up three RBIs each.
Stanford got started quickly in its first at-bat.
Morris led off the game with a double, went to
third on a sacrifice by Lappin and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Brangham.
The Cardinal scored four more runs the
next inning as had a run-scoring single,
Brangham knocked in two runs with a single of
her own, and Ching bunted Lappin home on a
suicide squeeze.

Oregon State's biggest chance fora rally
came in the fourth, when Beaver shortstop
Kelly Petersen hit a home run and ()regon Suite
loaded the bases shortly after. But Sorensen
beared down and shut down the hopes of a
comeback with a strikeout.
The game was called after five innings with
the eight-run mercy rule evoked.
The Beavers were able to put on an offensive
show of their own the day before.
Oregon Suite defeated Stanford 15-5 in a
marathon nine-inning game.
The Beavers scored three runs in the top of
the first before Stanford's Morris led off the
game with a homer.
By the third inning, it was still 3-1. But start
ing pitcher Tori Nyberg ran into a bit of trouble
in that frame, and Stanford manager John
Rittman had enough. He yanked his senior ace
in favor of freshman Laura Severson, who
made her coach look smart by getting out of the
jam.
And in the next-half inning, Stanford tied up
the score at three-apiece with RBI singles from
junior Jessica Allister and sophomore Elizabeth
Bendig
Severson pitched effectively until the top of
the sixth, when Peterson clocked a two-run
home run to put OSU ahead again.
The Beavers still led by two runs heading
