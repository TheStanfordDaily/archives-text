In recent years, the Stanford
women's track team has been
known more for its distance run
ners than its sprint corps. But if the
Texas Relays this past weekend in
Austin were any indication, the
Cardinal may have a group of
sprinters the Farm hasn't seen
since the glory days of Chrystie
Gaines 11 years ago.
The women's 1,600-meter relay
team — composed of junior Lind
sey Johnson, sophomore Christine
Moschella and freshmen Chinny
OfTor and Nashonme Johnson —
broke the school record in the
event with a time of 3:34.82. The
preliminary-round mark was most

notable for the performance of
Nashonme Johnson, whose unof
ficial anchor split would have bro
ken the school record in the 400 by
nearly two seconds.
And as a sign of improvement,
the squad's overall time broke the
Stanford record — a time that it set
only a week ago — by over five sec
onds.
It should keep Stanford atop
the West Regional rankings in the
event for now.
Also in Austin, the men's 1,600-
meter relay team of senior Milton
Little, junior Nick Sebes, sopho
more Gerren Crochet, and fresh
man TJ Rushing won the universi
ty division of the event in 3:07.77,
the third-best such time in Stan
ford history.

"My strategy going into the
last lap was just to keep the lead,"
said Sebes, the anchor of the
relay. "The other three guys did a
great job of pulling in front of the
pack, and my job was just to finish
it out.
"We're all very happy with our
time and overall performance."
The men's 400 relay flirted with
the 40-second barrier for the sec
ond weekend in a row, but fin
ished with a solid time of 40.24. It
was the fourth fastest in the pre
liminary rounds of the university
division.
With these great early marks,
the men's squad is expected to
make an assault on both the 400
