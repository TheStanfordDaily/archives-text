# Track's speedsters shine in Texas while discus goes 1-2-3 in L.A.

### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
In recent years, the Stanford
women's track team has been
known more for its distance run
ners than its sprint corps. But if the
Texas Relays this past weekend in
Austin were any indication, the
Cardinal may have a group of
sprinters the Farm hasn't seen
since the glory days of Chrystie
Gaines 11 years ago.
The women's 1,600-meter relay
team — composed of junior Lind
sey Johnson, sophomore Christine
Moschella and freshmen Chinny
OfTor and Nashonme Johnson —
broke the school record in the
event with a time of 3:34.82. The
preliminary-round mark was most

notable for the performance of
Nashonme Johnson, whose unof
ficial anchor split would have bro
ken the school record in the 400 by
nearly two seconds.
And as a sign of improvement,
the squad's overall time broke the
Stanford record — a time that it set
only a week ago — by over five sec
onds.
It should keep Stanford atop
the West Regional rankings in the
event for now.
Also in Austin, the men's 1,600-
meter relay team of senior Milton
Little, junior Nick Sebes, sopho
more Gerren Crochet, and fresh
man TJ Rushing won the universi
ty division of the event in 3:07.77,
the third-best such time in Stan
ford history.

"My strategy going into the
last lap was just to keep the lead,"
said Sebes, the anchor of the
relay. "The other three guys did a
great job of pulling in front of the
pack, and my job was just to finish
it out.
"We're all very happy with our
time and overall performance."
The men's 400 relay flirted with
the 40-second barrier for the sec
ond weekend in a row, but fin
ished with a solid time of 40.24. It
was the fourth fastest in the pre
liminary rounds of the university
division.
With these great early marks,
the men's squad is expected to
make an assault on both the 400

and 1,600 relay school records of
39.7 seconds and 3:06.6, respec
tively, both of which were set in
1978.
Lindsey Johnson also posted a
slightly wind-aided 13.56 to place
fourth in the invitational division
of the 100-meter hurdles. The
mark would have been a personal
best and school record if not for
the wind.
In the high jump, senior Kim
berly Stone finished second only to
the defending 2003 NCAA indoor
champion, Nevena Lendel of
Southern Methodist. Stone's
height of 5 feet, 10.75 inches tied
her personal best.
Freshman Solomon Welch
qualified for the West Regional
Championships in the triple jump
with a mark of 49-3.50
Meanwhile, other members of

the track and field squad traveled
down to UCIA for the Ratter
Johnson / Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Invitational.
There, a trio of Stanford juniors
placed 1 -2-3 in the open women's
discus competition.
Molly Meyer launched the dis
cus 162-2 feet fora first-place fin
ish. Jillian Camarean set a season
best in the discus with a toss of 160-
6 for second, and Kitty Currier
was third with an effort of 154-10.
Junior Jessica Pluth claimed
second in the hammer throw with
a season-best toss of 189-6, while
redshirt freshman Sarah Hopping
was third with a heave of 184-1.50.
Freshman Samantha Shepard
improved her season best in the
pole vault to 12-11.50 to place

The Cardinal will try to qualify

the Brutus Hamilton Invitational
at Cal.
