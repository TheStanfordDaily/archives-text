# Synchro no. 2 at nationals
## Stanford women capture trio event but lose to Ohio State, 94-89, for second straight year 
### DAN TARON 
To all of those who follow synchronized
swimming, the results of the Collegiate Nation
als held in Tucson should be no surprise.
The Stanford synchronized swimming team
finished as runners-up to Ohio State for the sec
ond consecutive year. The Buckeyes finished
with a team score of 94.5 points to Stanford's 89
to win its 23rd overall title.
In fact, no program outside of Columbus
and Palo Alto has ever won a syncro title in the
25-year history of the sport. Stanford has won
the other two â€” in 1998 and 1999.
And to underscore the lack of parity be
tween the top two and the rest of the field,
third-place University of Alabama finished
with 65.5 points
Ohio State won its fourth-straight title by
capturing the solo, duet and team competition
events.
But the Cardinal shined in the trio.
Team captains Stephanie Joukoff and Jen
nifer Kibler and freshman / U.S. National
Team member Ashley McHugh teamed up to
edge out Ohio State's trio by a slim margin of
94.166 to 93.833.
"It felt good to pull off at least one victory
over Ohio State," McHugh said. "We swam our
best, and I felt we deserved it."
And that feeling of disappointment perme
ated the Cardinal squad.
"I was really proud of our performance,"
said senior Ashley Ensign. "We did what we had
been practicing to do all season, but sometimes
you just can't control the judges."
Then again, the loss was easier to swallow be
cause the women felt like they had put forth
their best efforts of the season.
"It was our best swim of the year," junior
captain Jennifer Kibler said. There was a great
crowd, and we had great support from the
other swimmers."
Head coach Shannon Montague, in only her
second year at the helm, has yet to taste victory
in two Collegiate Nationals title appearances as
a head coach.

"The girls swam incredible," she said. The
team came away with a sense of accomplish
ment for performing at their best."
Montague, who was named Collegiate Syn
chronized Swimmer of the Year in 2001, won
two titles as a Stanford synchronized swimmer
herself in the late '90s
She took over the head coaching position
from longtime legend Vickey Weir, who retired
from the sports in 1998. VVier had been the
coach of the squad ever since the sport's incep
tion in 1979 and posted a 123-3 record in dual
meet events, making her the winningest coach
in synchro at the time.
Obviously, Montague has continued the
great success Wier started but has not yet won
the elusive title. In the end, however, it was a
remarkable season for the Cardinal.
Stanford had five Ail-American swimmers:
Ensign, Joukotf McHugh, sophomore Sheila
Sadovnik and freshman Cassidy Ramage.

The two seniors, Ensign and Joukotf, were
able to end their careers on a relative high note
in large part due to Montague and assistant
coach Heather Olson.
"Shannon and Heather are just the best
coaches an athlete could ask for," said Ensign.
They're serious when we're in the pool, but we
can joke with them outside of practice.
"They are definitely my favorite coaches I
have ever had."
With quality coaches and an experienced
core of swimmers in place, the Cardinal will
look to make another serious run at the title
next season.
"This year we had some trouble with injuries
and losing swimmers to the Olympic team, but
we have some awesome freshmen coming in
next year," Kibler said. "I think we will be an
even stronger team next season."
Let's just hope they can get over that Buck
eye hump.
