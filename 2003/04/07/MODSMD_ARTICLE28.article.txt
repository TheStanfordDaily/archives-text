# Pro-life students host panel

### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 100 students, professionals and ac
tivists from around California came to Stanford
on Saturday for informative workshops, inspi
rational speakers and networking opportuni
ties at the second annual "Celebrate Life Con
ference," organized by California Students for
Life and hosted by Stanford Students for Life.
"The conference is designed to provoke
thought and encourage dialogue," said con
ference coordinator, Brigitte Zimmerman in
the conference program. "It is my goal for
every student to leave here better equipped to
be a pro-life leader in today's society, more as
sured of the fundamental logic and reason be
hind the pro-life platform on issues."
The highlight of the conference for many
participants was a keynote address given by the
Director of American Victims of Abortion
Olivia Gans, which underscored the theme of
this year's conference, "Know Your Audience,
Know Your Arguments, Know Yourself."
"It was an encouragement speech," said
Gans after the address. "To let students know
that you do matter, you do make a difference,
and it's OK to feel inadequate or not up to the
task sometimes because in that weakness you
can always grow stronger ... I think that a lot
of the frustration in the pro-life movement
comes from a lack of comprehension that our
little tasks do so much."
Gans emphasized what she called "the ur
gency" of the pro-life movement on college
campuses, calling attention to "the fact that

there hasn't been a college campus since 1973
that hasn't been personally touched by this
issue — it touches people we care about in the
dorm, the apartment, in classes."
She also advised that arguments with die
opposing pro-choice advocates must be kept
on a respectful and "human level... because
this debate is about recognizing the human."
Jenny Youngblood, a graduate of the Class
of 1999, said, "[Gans' speech] was very inspi
rational because she tried to bring in the
human element of tilings. It's often easy to de
humanize the opposition, but that dehuman
ization undermines what you are fighting for .
. . the pro-life cause is about people; it's about
respect and love for each and every person."
Youngblood helped organize the Stanford
Students for Life in the late 19905, and it has
grown over the past years. According to current
president Eva St. Clair, a senior, it doubled in size
this year from 10 to 20 active members and ex
panded its e-mail list to more than 100 members.
Participants attended any of the eight dif
ferent workshops which covered topics in
cluding capital punishment, euthanasia, stem
cell research, the legal aspects of abortion,
methods of arguing the pro-life stance and
techniques in organizing a pro-life group.
Participants said that they learned a great
deal from the workshops.
"People often focus on abortion but they need
to be educated to know that the pro-life move
ment goes beyond just abortion," said partici
pant Rocio Caredenas, a freshman at Stanford.
Monika Rodman, who does pro-life service
work at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oak

land, hosted the "Death as a Penalty" workshop.
"I think people appreciated a chance to ex
plore an issue that they're thinking about," she
said. "Fora lot of people, pro-life means anti-abor
tion and anti-euthanasia, but people are now ques
tioning whether it also means anti-death penalty."
Helen Kwan, a post-doctoral fellow re
searching genetics at Stanford's School of Med
icine, hosted the "Stem Cell Research: Encour
age or Discourage?" workshop. She said that the
goal of her talk was "to lay out the scientific facts

and allow students to come to a conclusion
themselves."
St. Clair indicated that a few people who were
pro-choice also attended the conference and
had given her positive feedback on it.
"It is important to respect all people, especially
those who don't agree with you ... In that way,
pro-life and pro-choice advocates can encourage
dialogue and work together to eliminate a lot of
the societal problems that bring about abortions
and the death penalty," St. Clair said.
