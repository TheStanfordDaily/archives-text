# As neighbors visit campus, students rally for workers
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford opened its doors to its neighbors
on Community Day yesterday while student
activists marched to protest the University's
position on wage levels and benefits for its
unionized workers.
Thousands of people from the Bay Area
came to Stanford yesterday, either in accep
tance of the school's proclamation of commu
nity solidarity or to voice their skepticism of
Stanford's commitment to its own community
members.
At the second annual Community Day, a
children's carnival, a 5K run and a health fair

were some of the events that attracted Stan
ford's neighbors to campus.
"I think the message we're trying to tell
people ... is that we are a part of the commu
nity and we want them to understand what's
going on on campus and what we think
[they're] going to be proud of," said Universi
ty President John Hennessy.
The day began at 8 a.m. with registration
for the first annual 5K Fun Run / Walk, spon
sored by Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and the Office of the
Provost.
"Over 230 participants came out from

local communities and the Stan
ford campus to run / walk; that's
over 120 day-of entries," said the
senior Jeb Ory, organizer of the
Fun Run.
In a separate event sponsored by
the Coalition for Labor Justice, the
Service Employees International
Union Local 715, SEIU Local 1877,
the Student Labor Action Project and
Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees, approximately
250 workers and students marched
past Community Day booths with the
message that Stanford does not meet

the needs of its workers.
"Stanford University is creating
an injustice in its community," said
keynote speaker Linda Chavez-
Thompson, executive vice-presi
dent of the AFL-CIO. "This is about
the community, and we are the
community."
The march and rally were part of
the Student Labor Action Project's
National Student Labor Week of Ac
tion, held in commemoration of the
work of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Cesar Chavez.
"I think [Community Day] is an
appropriate venue to have discus
sions about how we solve the prob
lems that I think workers and em
ployers share together," Hennessy
said. "I don't see the purpose of

making a lot of noise; it doesn't im
prove the quality of that conversa
tion."
Visitors of Community Day took
notice of the march, yet for the most
part, continued with their planned
activities.
"Everyone has a right to free
speech," said visiting graduate Eliz
abeth Darby.
Despite the cloudy weather, visi
tors, many with young children,
were satisfied with the day's events.
"I read about [Community
Day] in the Mercury News," said
San Jose resident Mary Ann Migli
attio. "I've been by here many
times and had never been on the
campus. This is just wonderful.
I'm going to bring my grandchil

dren next year. They did a beauti
ful job."
Money raised from the 5K run's
entry fees and donations totaled
over $4,000 and will benefit the East
Palo Alto YMCA.
"It was a pretty fast race, and I
think we had a lot of running clubs
involved," said the race's publicity
chair, Katy Blakemore, a junior.
"It'll be a great race to continue,
now that some of the foundation has
been laid."
The youngest participants were
6 year-olds Roman Sul and Brian
Burks and the oldest was 65-year
old Keith Johnson. Rich Ginn fin
ished with the fastest time at 17 min
utes, nine seconds.
Although visitors to Community

Day were more involved in the fes
tivities, those who participated in
the march were equally enthusias
tic.
"It's really important for us as
students to be involved," said march
coordinator Leticia Ramirez, a ju
nior. "These are the workers we talk
to ever) day. It's really important for
us to establish that support base be
cause both unions [SEIU Local 715
and SEIU Local 1877] will be going
out for contract negotiations in two
or three months."
Before the march, food service
worker Otelia Barrillas shared with
the crowd her struggle to raise her
wages from $8 an hour as a tempo
rary employee to $12 an hour with
benefits.

"I did the same kind of work as
the permanent workers," Barrillas
said. "The only difference was that I
didn't get any benefits, I got paid
less, and I didn't have a voice at the
workplace."
One particular issue raised at the
rally was the status of temporal*)'
workers.
"There's a lot of people who are
called ever)- day and told 'come to
work; don't come to work,' " Ramirez
said. "Workers should be able to work
every day. Temp agencies have a re
ally bad reputation, especially with
immigrants .. The University knows
better. They have so many jobs; they
should make [temporary workers] di
rectly hired, with stable, good paying
jobs."

called ever)- day and told 'come to
work; don't come to work,' " Ramirez
said. "Workers should be able to work
every day. Temp agencies have a re
ally bad reputation, especially with
immigrants .. The University knows
better. They have so many jobs; they
should make [temporary workers] di
rectly hired, with stable, good paying
jobs."
Stanford opened its doors to its neighbors
on Community Day yesterday while student
activists marched to protest the University's
position on wage levels and benefits for its
unionized workers.
Thousands of people from the Bay Area
came to Stanford yesterday, either in accep
tance of the school's proclamation of commu
nity solidarity or to voice their skepticism of
Stanford's commitment to its own community
members.
At the second annual Community Day, a
children's carnival, a 5K run and a health fair

were some of the events that attracted Stan
ford's neighbors to campus.
"I think the message we're trying to tell
people ... is that we are a part of the commu
nity and we want them to understand what's
going on on campus and what we think
[they're] going to be proud of," said Universi
ty President John Hennessy.
The day began at 8 a.m. with registration
for the first annual 5K Fun Run / Walk, spon
sored by Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and the Office of the
Provost.
"Over 230 participants came out from

local communities and the Stan
ford campus to run / walk; that's
over 120 day-of entries," said the
senior Jeb Ory, organizer of the
Fun Run.
In a separate event sponsored by
the Coalition for Labor Justice, the
Service Employees International
Union Local 715, SEIU Local 1877,
the Student Labor Action Project and
Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees, approximately
250 workers and students marched
past Community Day booths with the
message that Stanford does not meet

the needs of its workers.
"Stanford University is creating
an injustice in its community," said
keynote speaker Linda Chavez-
Thompson, executive vice-presi
dent of the AFL-CIO. "This is about
the community, and we are the
community."
The march and rally were part of
the Student Labor Action Project's
National Student Labor Week of Ac
tion, held in commemoration of the
work of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Cesar Chavez.
"I think [Community Day] is an
appropriate venue to have discus
sions about how we solve the prob
lems that I think workers and em
ployers share together," Hennessy
said. "I don't see the purpose of

making a lot of noise; it doesn't im
prove the quality of that conversa
tion."
Visitors of Community Day took
notice of the march, yet for the most
part, continued with their planned
activities.
"Everyone has a right to free
speech," said visiting graduate Eliz
abeth Darby.
Despite the cloudy weather, visi
tors, many with young children,
were satisfied with the day's events.
"I read about [Community
Day] in the Mercury News," said
San Jose resident Mary Ann Migli
attio. "I've been by here many
times and had never been on the
campus. This is just wonderful.
I'm going to bring my grandchil

dren next year. They did a beauti
ful job."
Money raised from the 5K run's
entry fees and donations totaled
over $4,000 and will benefit the East
Palo Alto YMCA.
"It was a pretty fast race, and I
think we had a lot of running clubs
involved," said the race's publicity
chair, Katy Blakemore, a junior.
"It'll be a great race to continue,
now that some of the foundation has
been laid."
The youngest participants were
6 year-olds Roman Sul and Brian
Burks and the oldest was 65-year
old Keith Johnson. Rich Ginn fin
ished with the fastest time at 17 min
utes, nine seconds.
Although visitors to Community

Day were more involved in the fes
tivities, those who participated in
the march were equally enthusias
tic.
"It's really important for us as
students to be involved," said march
coordinator Leticia Ramirez, a ju
nior. "These are the workers we talk
to ever) day. It's really important for
us to establish that support base be
cause both unions [SEIU Local 715
and SEIU Local 1877] will be going
out for contract negotiations in two
or three months."
Before the march, food service
worker Otelia Barrillas shared with
the crowd her struggle to raise her
wages from $8 an hour as a tempo
rary employee to $12 an hour with
benefits.

"I did the same kind of work as
the permanent workers," Barrillas
said. "The only difference was that I
didn't get any benefits, I got paid
less, and I didn't have a voice at the
workplace."
One particular issue raised at the
rally was the status of temporal*)'
workers.
"There's a lot of people who are
called ever)- day and told 'come to
work; don't come to work,' " Ramirez
said. "Workers should be able to work
every day. Temp agencies have a re
ally bad reputation, especially with
immigrants .. The University knows
better. They have so many jobs; they
should make [temporary workers] di
rectly hired, with stable, good paying
jobs."
