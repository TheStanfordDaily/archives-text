# Gov Co cottage residents asked to switch dorms
## 
### 
In an e-mail sent Friday afternoon, students liv
ing in the cottages at Murray and Yost were told by
Housing and Assignment Services that they would
have four days to move into new residences. The
students are slated to move today or tomorrow.
The only explanation offered by the e-mail for
why the approximately 10 students were being
moved on such short notice was current events.
"Given current events internationally, the Uni
versity has identified a need to be prepared to offer
housing to visitors and others, and potentially to re
assign students, on a very short notice," wrote Todd
Benson, director of Housing Assignment Services.
"The cottages at Governor's Corner have been
identified as the l)est site for this, since they were in
tended solely as short-term housing for visitors and
last-minute reassignments."
Benson added that students in the Draw were
only assigned to these cottages in recent years due
to the crunch in undergraduate housing.
Students were also told to notify Housing Ser
vices of their top choices for reassignment by Satur
day afternoon or the University would reassign
them to the nearest vacant residence.
"By the time I read [the e-mail], the office had al
ready closed and 1 odd Benson did not reply to any
of our queries over the weekend," said sophomore
Karan Mahajan, who lives in the Murray cottage. "I
really don't know how Housing expects us to move
out at such short notice, and, if they do, why they
don't provide us with more information [or] sup
port. Given our schedules, moving out is no easy
task."
The Residence Agreement signed by all students
when they accept University housing includes a clause
allowing the University to move students when neces
sary. The clause Ijegins, "The University reserves the
right to reassign you to another room or residence at
any time during the term of this agreement."

ministrators last night for comment.
