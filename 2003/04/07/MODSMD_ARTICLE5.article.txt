With peace activists, hip-hop artists,
poets and photographers, Stanford's annu
al Islam Awareness Week will present the
artistic culture of the Muslim faith in efforts
to encourage both religious understanding
and awareness in light of current events.
The week-long celebration, coordinat
ed by the Muslim Students Awareness

Network, begins today at 12:30 p.m. with
photographer Peter Sanders' exhibition
on the Muslim world, entitled "In the
Shade of the Tree."
Sanders journeyed through Muslim
regions on a personal spiritual quest, pho
tographing his surroundings. "In the
Shade of the Tree" is his first photograph
ic book, which records the transition of tra
ditional Muslim societies into modernity.
"Sanders is almost the exclusive photog

rapher of the Middle East," said sophomore
Mabrookah Heneidi, coordinator of Islam
Awareness Week in association with MSAN.
"He is one of the few people granted access
to Muslim cities in places like Saudi Arabia."
Hip-hop celebrities Everlast and
Napoleon will be performing in Kresge
Auditorium on Friday and will speak on
how the Islamic faith has shaped their
music and lives. Everlast converted
to Islam after a near-fatal cardiac ar
rest in 1998. Napoleon, a member
Tupac Shakur's group Outlawz, re
cendy returned from Saudi Arabia
where he performed the Hajj, an
annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
"They will discuss what it's like to be
Muslim in the hip-hop world," Henei
di said. "They will talk about how they
maintained their Islamic ideals in an

industry that seemingly runs counter
to what it stands for, as well as what
stereotypes and obstacles they had to
overcome to get where they are."
On Tuesday, activists Gerri
Haynes and Bert Sacks will speak
about their travels through Iraq and
address their opinions of the cur
rent situation the country is facing.
Other events include a Quranic
recitation, a lecture on religious art
and a spoken word performance by
Bay Area group Calligraphy of
Thought.
Stanford junior Ibrahim Hamza
will present his photographic tour

through Spain in Morocco in White
Plaza on Wednesday. Hamza took
over 2,000 pictures while research
ing Islamic architecture last sum
mer.
"It is unfortunate that people
should associate Iraq with war and a
tyrannical leader and forget that
Iraq was the home of an amazing
civilization," Hamza said. "Politics
seems to forget these treasures and
has, unfortunately, painted a wholly
contradictory picture of what Islam
truly stands for."
To faculty and staff, the current
war in Iraq and memories of the

Sept. 11 terrorist attacks make Islam
Awareness week an especially im
portant event to balance student
views on diversity and maintain
healthy dialogue on campus.
"It seems to me that sharing our
cultural histories can go a long way
toward helping us all learn how we
should live together in this commu
nity and beyond," said Chris Grif
fith, acting dean of students, whose
office helped sponsor the week's
festivities.
Dean for Religious Life Scotty
McLennan added, "Especially in the
aftermath of September 11, and in

the midst of the war in Iraq, it is cru
cial to understand a religion which is
being used and misused by all sides
in describing current events."
The Department of Religious Stud
ies and the Office of Religious Life both
helped sponsor Islam Awareness
Week in conjunction with MSAN.
"Last year we spent all our ener
gies trying to portray Islam against
the image of terrorism, and we were
very much on the defensive,"
Heneidi said. "This year we have
the theme of artistic appreciation.
Who are Islam's artists, thinkers,
and what are their achievements?"
