More than 1,000 students and
members of the Stanford commu
nity attended the second annual
Urban Nights Dance Fusion
show, a presentation of various
dance styles from classical ballet to
hip-hop to Broadway-style jazz
and everything in between.
"I am so pleased with the stu
dents," said Cardinal Ballet facul
ty 'adviser Kristine Elliott. ''The
fusion between the different
dance styles and orchestra is ter
rific."
She added, "This type of col
laboration should be done more
often at Stanford."
The show, which featured the
Cardinal Ballet, Bent Spoon and

Urban Styles dance companies,
ran three times last weekend.
"As a performer, it's very excit
ing to get to dance in a show with
great choreography and so many
talented dancers," said sopho
more Sarah Sullivan, co-producer
of the show and Cardinal Ballet
president. "Cardinal Ballet, by my
estimate, lias put in over a hun
dred hours of rehearsal since the
beginning of the academic year,
and I feel like it paid off."
The music ranged from classi
cal to Michael Jackson to music
from the 2002 movie "Chicago."
Cardinal Ballet is a group that
performs well-known classical
and neo-classical ballet pieces,
while Bent Spoon is a company
dedicated to modern dance per
formances. Urban Styles is a Los
Angeles Jazz-based dance compa

taste of lots of different styles of

dance so that they could see the
depth and breadth of what is con
sidered 'dance,'" explained Sulli
van.
Students seemed to appreciate
their efforts.
"I am not a dance expert, but
this kind of stuff is definitely cool,"
said freshman Will Levi. "I like
that there are so many different
styles on display."
Cardinal Ballet performed
parts of the masterpiece "The
Four Temperaments" by world
famous choreographer George
Balanchine.
"Getting the rights to this
choreography is a gift to Stan
ford," said Half Moon Bay resi
dent Nani Venegas. "This is really
a special occasion. It was really
great to see the efforts of the stu
dents â€” these will be future
lawyers and doctors, and yet they
have so much dedication. They
have achieved so much."
Stanford community members
highly praised the performers'
abilities.
"The dancers were of a very
high caliber," said Menlo Park
resident Bernadette Connolly.
"You could mistake them for
professionals. The orchestra was
also really great. It was a terrific
show."
Urban Nights uniquely fea
tured both student and profes
sional choreography. Along with
the choreography of masters like
Balanchine and Marius Petipa,
there were also student choreog
raphers like senior Rebecca
Whitehurst of Bent Spoon.
"It was great that we got to
have our work presented in the
same night as these staple chore
ographers," Whitehurst said.
"The performances went very
well and the show was unique in
each piece and cohesive on the
whole."
