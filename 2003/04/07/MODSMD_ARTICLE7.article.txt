# Greek organizations, freshmen gear up for start of Rush Week
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Rush begins ill is week, Greek life is at the
forefront of possibilities for many freshmen,
upperclassmen and transfers. Even students
who do not consider themselves "fraternity or
sorority material" participate in Rush, though
they do not necessarily pledge.
The Rush process can be seen as a daunt
ing time for prospective fraternity and soror
ity candidates. Stanford fraternities and
sororities pride themselves in taking in many

ambivalent candidates.
"I definitely don't know whether I want to
live in a house of all girls or even join an un
housed sorority," said freshman Shari Ilsen.
"But after the Inter-Sorority Council talked to
my dorm about recruitment, I realized that it
was a great way to meet people."
The leaders of the ISC and Inter-Fraterni
ty Council stress friendship as the most impor
tant aspect of sisterhood and brotherhood.

and sorority Rush in Stanford are
completely different processes.
Fraternity Rush started last night
with a recruitment meeting in the
Tresidder Oak Room. The process
continues until April 23, the last day
to accept a fraternity bid. The IFC
rush includes 12 fraternities, each
holding open houses on various
nights until Bid Day on April 21.
"In the short term, Rush is about
having fun," said Gerad Suyderhoud,
the IFC Rush chair, on the IFC Web
site. "After Rush, pledging a fraternity
gives you the opportunity to take part
in some meaningful traditions, to be
part ofa network of older students and
alumni who can give you advice on
everything from academic and career
issues to where the best bars are."
At Stanford, there are seven
housed fraternities — next year
Sigma Nu will be housed in 557 —
and eight unhoused options, at
tempting to appeal to a large num
ber of Stanford prospects.
Likewise, the five Stanford sorori
ties sponsored by the ISC include three
housed and two unhoused groups.

However, sororities have a much short
er recruitment process, consisting of a
four-day series of structured events.
ISC rush begins tonight with a
recruitment orientation in Tresid
der Oak. An open house is held on
April 11 for students to become ac
quainted with ;ill the sororities.
Each day following, prospects
undergo a mutual selection process
in which they will be given invites to
certain sororities and must choose
which to accept. The time spent with
each sorority increases through each
day of recruitment, culminating
with Bid Day on April 15.
Beyond the ISC and IFC
groups, Stanford is home to multi
cultural and African-American fra
ternal and sororal organizations.
African-American associations are
made up of two sororities and one
fraternity while multicultural orga
nizations are comprised of two fra
ternities and two sororities. All of
these are unhoused.
Current members and alumni
agree that the main benefit of rush is
social interaction and long-lasting
friendship.
"So why rush?" asked junior
Dave Lau, president of Sigma Phi
Epsilon. "Simply to get more out of
your college experience."
