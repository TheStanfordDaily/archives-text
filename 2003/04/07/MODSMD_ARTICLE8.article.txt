# GSC election draws few office hopefuls
## 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Nineteen candidates are vying this year for the 15
positions on the Graduate Student Council, though
a dearth of office seekers has left several schools with
few or no candidates in this Wednesday's election.
The main issues in this year's election resemble
the topics that are widely discussed each year, in
cluding affordable health care and housing, child
care, parking and transportation issues, stipends, so
cial interactions and overall quality of life. Addition
ally, academics have been discussed, including the
need to promote more interdisciplinary exchanges
among graduate students from different fields and
more dialogue between students and administrators.
Some candidates have also expressed concern that
not enough people are paying attention to world af
fairs and the issues that affect international students.
The GSC is composed of 15 elected members. Ten
of these are elected from and by students within each
graduate school, while the remaining five are at-large
representatives who are elected from and by the
whole graduate student communi
ty. Candidates run from within
their respective graduate school,
and those with the highest amount
of votes within the school are elect
ed as the school's representative.
The remaining candidates with the
highest number of votes are elect
ed to the five at-large positions.
The purpose of this division,
said outgoing GSC Chair Grace
Chang, a medical student, is to en
sure that students from each
school have a voice without severe
ly limiting the number of students
who can participate from any one
school.
The schools do have quotas of
representative seats they must fill,
but once they are filled, then the
remaining at-large seats are open
to all candidates. The School of
Engineering has two guaranteed
seats, the School of Humanities
and Sciences has three, while the
Schools of Business, Law, Medi
cine, Education and Earth Sci
ences each have one.
Running for these positions are
19 candidates â€” five from Engi-

neering, six from Humanities and
Sciences, three from the Business
School, two from the Medical
School, two from the School of Ed
ucation and one from Earth Sci
ences. There are no candidates
this year from the Law School.
Among this pool of candidates
are two incumbents, Surya Singh,
currently an Engineering repre
sentative, and Ying Wong, cur
rently an at-large representative
from Humanities and Sciences.
The GSC elections campaign is
fairly modest, with the result being
that many graduate students fail to
take notice of them.
Alan Omand, a first-year grad
uate student in management sci
ence and engineering, remarked,
"Actually, I don't know that much
about the grad student elections. I
think I was e-mailed by my CA, but
there have been no real posters or
fliers around that I have noticed
and really couldn't tell you one
person who is running to save my
life."
Once the 15 representatives are
elected, they participate in an in
ternal election to select the officer
positions of chair, deputy chair, fi
nancial officer and Funding Com
mittee chair. No current officers
are running for reelection.
