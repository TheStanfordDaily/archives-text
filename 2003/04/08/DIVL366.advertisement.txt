Joel Beinin received his B.A. from Princeton University in 1970, his M.A. from Harvard University in 1974,
and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1982. He also studied at the American University of Cairo
and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Since 1983 he has taught Middle East history at Stanford
University. His research and writing focuses on workers, peasants, and minorities in the modern Middle East
and on Israel, Palestine, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. He lived in Israel in 1965-66 and 1970-73 and Egypt
in 1980-81, and he returns to the region often for research and to visit his family in Israel. His most recent
book is Workers and Peasants in the Modern Middle East (Cambridge University Press 2001). In 2002 he
served as President of the Middle East Studies Association of North America.
Discussion and lecture series encourages reflection within the Stanford community on matters of personal values,
beliefs, and motivations in order to better understand the lives and inspirations of those who shape the University.
