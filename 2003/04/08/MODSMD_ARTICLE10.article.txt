## Troops in Baghdad seize palace 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — American
troops and tanks rumbled through
downtown Baghdad with unstoppable
force on Monday, seizing one of Sad
dam Hussein's opulent palaces, top
pling a 40-foot statue of the Iraqi ruler
and pushing his regime to the brink of
irrelevance.
Some Iraqi soldiers jumped into the
Tigris River to flee the advancing col
umn of more than 100 armored vehi
cles. About a dozen others were cap
tured and placed inside a hastily erect
ed POW pen on the grounds of the
bombed-out, blue-and-gold-domed
New Presidential Palace.
An estimated 600 to 1,000 Iraqi
troops were killed during the opera
tion, said Col. David Perkins. "We had
a lot of suicide attackers today," he said.
"These guys are going to die in droves .
. . They keep trying to ram the tanks
with car bombs."
Tank-killing A-10 Warthogs and pi
lotless drones provided air cover as
Americans briefly surrounded another
prominent symbol of Saddam's power,
the Information Ministry, as well as the
city's best-known hotel, the Al-Rashid.
Tanks rolled briefly up to another one
of Saddam's many palaces.
It was the third straight day the
Army penetrated Saddam's seat of
power. This time, though, there were
plans to stay. Rather than withdrawing
at nightfall, as units did over the week
end, members of the 2nd Brigade of
the 3rd Infantry Division hunkered

down for the night at the sprawling,
splendored New Presidential Palace
where Saddam once slept.
Several miles away, two soldiers and
two journalists were killed in a rocket
attack on the 3rd Infantry Division
south of Baghdad, the U.S. Central
Command reported. Another 15 sol
diers were injured in the attack on an
infantry position south of the city.
On the other side of town, Marines
encountered tough fighting as they

entered Baghdad for the first time,
coming under machine gun fire. Lt.
Col. B P. McCoy said two Marines
were killed after an artillery shell hit
their armored personnel carrier.
The Iraqi regime, its brutal hold on
a country of 24 million slipping away,
denied all of it. "There is no presence of
American infidels in the city of Bagh
dad, at all," insisted Iraqi Information
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
After a two-week siege, British forces

claimed control over Basra, a city of 1.3
million. Hundreds of civilians, women
and barefoot children among them,
poured into the street to welcome the in
vaders. Some handed pink carnations to
the British troops in appreciation.
"The hostilities phase is coming to a
conclusion," said Secretary of State
Colin Powell. He said the U.S. govern
ment is sending a team this week to
Iraq to begin laying the groundwork
for an interim authority.
