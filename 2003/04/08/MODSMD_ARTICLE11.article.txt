# Cross-burning ban is upheld
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court
ruled yesterday that states can punish Ku Klux Klans
men and others who set crosses afire, finding that a
burning cross is an instrument of racial terror so
threatening that it overshadows free speech concerns.
The court voted 6-3 to uphold a 50-year-old Vir
ginia law making it a crime to burn a cross as an act of
intimidation. A lower court had ruled the law muz
zled free speech.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the ma
jority, said the protections afforded by the First
Amendment "are not absolute" and do not necessari
ly shield cross burners.
Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only black
member and a law-and-order conservative who fre
quently departs from civil rights orthodoxy, wrote
separately that "those who hate cannot terrorize and
intimidate to make their point."
The ruling seemed at odds with past Supreme
Court decisions that protected the constitutional
speech rights of unsavory or unpopular groups and
causes, including flag burners, pornographers and
strippers, and people who use swastikas or crosses in
demonstrations.
"This is an emotional topic for everyone," said New
York free speech lawyer Floyd Abrarns, noting the
cross-burning ties to racist violence. "The ruling is
nonetheless a defeat for First Amendment principles."
Virginia Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore pre
dicted the decision would prompt more states to out
law cross burning.
"A burning cross is a symbol like no other. It
doesn't just say we don't like you. The message is we
are going to do you harm," Kilgore said.
Thomas grew up in then-segregated Georgia.
During arguments in the case, he spoke of a century
of violence and terror at the hands of the Klan and
other white supremacy groups.
"The cross was a symbol of that reign of terror,"
Thomas said, breaking his customary silence during
arguments.
