Editorial

112 V he Department of Homeland Se
curity committed to a policy of
blanket detainment for asylum-
JL seeking immigrants from 33 select
countries last month. The policy affects all
refugees from countries where al-Qaida is
ever said to have operated.
As part of Homeland Security's "Opera
tion Liberty Shield," the policy will require
every refugee from the specified countries to
stay in detention centers until his or her asy
lum application is processed in full. The list
includes: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain,
Bangladesh, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, In
donesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco,
Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand,
Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan,
United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and
Yemen.
The Department of Homeland Security's
policy intends to keep people in this country
safe from terrorism. Unfortunately, the de-

But the truth is, terrorism is not a propen
sity inherent to people from Middle Eastern
or South Asian backgrounds, and national
origin is not a refined enough trait by which
to suspect someone of having ill-will against
the United States.
In contrast, one of the best reasons to
question the refugee detainment policy is for
the message it sends to Arabs and Muslims
worldwide — that the United States feels
they cannot be trusted, or that it is OK to
deny them the civil liberties we so vehe
mently uphold for the rest of our popula
tion.
In fact, America seems to be sending Mus
lims mixed messages about their potential
treatment in the United States. Just as the
Department of Homeland Defense is enact
ing its new detainment policy, propaganda
like ads in the U.S. media promise the safety
and good treatment of Muslims within our
borders. We remember President Bush's ad
dress to the nation following Sept. 11, dur

Such a policy contradicts the fundamental
values set forth by our Constitution.
Criticisms of the new refugee detain
ment policy are running rampant. Eleanor
Acer, the director of the asylum program at
the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights
in New York noted that it's ironic that one
on hand, we are trying to liberate the Iraqi
people, and on the other, we are depriving
those who flee tyranny of their civil rights.
U.N. and immigration officials voice con
cerns about the linking of terrorism to asy
lum seekers and the prejudging of guilt
based on country of origin.
Yet members of the office for Homeland
Security contest such reservations, citing
three instances in which terrorists in the
United States had entered as political
refugees — these included Omar Abdel
Rahman, convicted of attempting to blow up
the U.N. building in New York in 1995, Mir
Aimal Kansi, assassin of several CIA employ
ees in 1993, and Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer,
who planned to bomb New York's subways
in 1997.

how this detainment
policy will affect students seeking to attend
U.S. universities. Will tightening immigra
tion policies prevent many international stu
dents from studying in the United States at
all? Are we willing to sacrifice freedom for
blanket security measures, when better-fo
cused measures could just as well be enact
ed? International students play an impor
tant role in the Stanford community — both
in the undergraduate and graduate student
bodies — and these policies could hurt the
diversity the University treasures.
For the time being, we would prefer
Homeland Security to enact detainment
measures only in cases meriting reasonable
suspicion, and in those cases, to minimize
the length of detainment periods. As of now,
only 10 to 40 percent are processed within
90 days, according to The New York Times.
Six months in detention is no way to provide
the protection that a refugee needs.
We worry about the well-being of the in
ternational student community both locally
and nationally and we hope such mixed
messages are clarified as soon as possible.
