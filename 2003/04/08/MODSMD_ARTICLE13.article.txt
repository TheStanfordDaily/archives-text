Protesters continue to demonstrate,
in perspective there is nothing
more important
As one of the peace demonstrators
whom Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth
Madjlessi tall in their column ("See you at
the crossroads" April 7) "inane" for hold
ing anti-war signs on the corner of El
Camino and Embarcadero on late after
noons, I confess I agree with them on at
least two scores. In their column, Kendall
and Madjlessi imply that the demonstra
tors have nothing more important to do,
and they're right.
When I see pictures of poor Iraqi citi
zens looking at their ruined homes, or pic
tures of Iraqi children covered with burns
or with their limbs amputated, and read
that Iraqi doctors are now forced to use
local anesthetic when performing serious
surgery because they have nothing better
on hand, and when I know that these
tragedies, multiplied many times, are
caused by my own government, then truly,
I don't have anything better to do than
protest.
I also agree with the two columnists in
that "there are several countries out there

with dictators just as bad as Saddam Hus
sein," and that there are "some countries,
such as North Korea ... that may be a far
greater threat to our security." But if these
things are true, why was it so necessary to
invade Iraq and subject the Iraqi people to
infinitely more suffering?
Kendall and Madjlessi say it was to bring
liberty and democracy to Iraq, but a liber
al democracy cannot be imposed by an oc
cupation army on a country with very dif
ferent traditions and culture, and where
there are deep-seated ethnic and religious
differences.
Finally, as for Kendall and Madjlessi's
expectation that the United States will re
build Iracj and bring the Iraqis "the best
life possible," I would remind them that
here at home President George W. Bush is
t ailing fora huge tax cut for the very rich
while lines are growing outside of soup
kitchens and homeless shelters and school
districts are having to fire teachers to save
money. It is precisely because I believe that
the Iraqis will not be better off because of
this war, and because I think our national
resources should be used to help human
beings, not destroy them, that I'm going
back to the street corner.
