# LYING IN THE GRASS
## The 						scientific food chain 
### 
As in the military, much of
academia is character
ized by a strict pecking
order, where you start in
the gutters and methodically inch
your way towards the top.
In the frenzy to churn out
publications factory-style, a pro
fessor presides over, from highest
to lowest, postdoctoral students,
graduate students and under
graduate students. And in faculty
senate meetings, tenured and as
sociate professors make fun of the
poor assistant profs, whose ulti
mate fate in academia hinges
upon the productivity of those
under him. Yet all these dis
parate groups will band together
when arguing the position of
their field in the so-called science
hierarchy: physics above chem
istry above biology.
You can also add other disci
plines onto this ladder. The social
sciences — psychology, sociology
and anthropology — often fall
below the natural sciences. But we
will not concern ourselves with
these subjects here. To paraphrase
my textbooks, it is beyond the
scope of this article.
Some believe that the science
hierarchy exists. Biology is more
concerned with description and
processes. The meta-level analysis
is, on the whole, easier to visualize
and comprehend. Physics, on the
other hand, is a more abstract and
quantitative field. To truly grasp a
concept, a person has to sift
through an amorphous mess of
notations and symbols, what
seems like the lost language of
some ancient civilization. In a
sense, physics, relying on the ge
nius of Isaac Newton and Albert
Einstein, can be seen as requiring

more pure creativity than the
other two fields.
Personally, I believe that this
totem pole holds true. All the
grades I've gotten in biology have
been decent. Throw in my marks
in chemistry and physics, however,
and I've got a science CPA teeter
ing on the edge of a cliff.
But what do I know; I'm just an

undergrad.
To determine
the veracity of the
science hierarchy
once and for all, I
decided to let
some campus lu
minaries throw
their hats in the
ring. At first, I fig
ured the victor

could be determined with a varia
tion of the Iron Chef competition.
Each scientist would be handed a
laser, a gallon of hydrochloric acid
and some Andean fungus and
given an hour to come up with
some really cool thing to do with
all those objects. But the scientists,
being the gentlemen that they are,
preferred the more conventional
academic method of resolving ide
ological differences: reasoned de
bate.
From the "bottom," Biological
Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich says,
"In my experience, physicists are
no smarter, or dumber, than other
scientists. The problems in physics
tend to be easier than, say, those in
neurobiology .... which is why so
many more of them are solved. I
do not believe in the hierarchy."
Perhaps the biologists, since os
tensibly at the bottom of the food
chain, are the least likely to believe
in the hierarchy. But what do the
physicists have to say?

Though slightly hesitant,
Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff
concurs. "Do I think that physicists
are inherently smarter than other
scientists? No, what a good biolo
gist can do a physicist may not be
able to do."
Apparently, the hierarchy has
nothing to do with pure intelli
gence — and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare agrees. "I have met
people of varying intelligence and
varying degrees of insightfulness
in each field," he says.
Zare continues, "Let me remind
you of a fundamental asymmetry
of the universe — somehow, there
are more horses' asses than there
are horses."
Alas, amongst the biologist,
chemist and physicist, all undoubt
edly horses, there is no dissenting
voice. The science hierarchy is a
sham. Unless you speak to Biology
Prof. Donald Kennedy, who, as
the editor-in-chief of the journal
Science, can single-handedly in
fluence the direction of all three
fields.
Kennedy says,"The so-called
hierarchy — is real enough as a
perceptual artifact; that is, most
people probably think of the sci
ences in that way."
Kennedy ticks off two reasons
why the public believes the hier
archy exists: "The first is that
physics deals most directly with
the smallest units, and we tend to
admire reductionism as somehow
more fundamental. The second
dates right back to junior high.
Physics required the most math;
math is terrifying and therefore
especially admirable, so physics is
at the top."

Ultimately, in a scientific
oligopoly, the biologists, chemists
and physicists will have to combine
their knowledge to tackle future
problems. Both Zare and Ehrlich
emphasize that, contrary to the
academic tradition of parsing
knowledge into specialties and
sub-specialties, there is an increas
ing value to interdisciplinary re
search. However, Ehrlich notes
that, in this respect, Stanford is
"extremely strong in faculty and

depressingly medieval in struc
ture.
We've got biophysics and bio
chemistry already. And I took
physical chemistry last quarter.
What would a new discipline,
combining all three fields, be
called? Biophyschemistry?
Physchembiology? Whatever the
academics decide to coin this new
discipline, it will never roll off the
tongue. Regardless, it will still be
necessary in order to advance sci
entific knowledge.

At Stanford, human biology shoves bi
ology even lower on the chain. Respond
