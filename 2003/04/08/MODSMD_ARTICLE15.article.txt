## Peaceful solutions not effective in Iraq 
### BO COWGILL GUEST COLUMNIST 
Future world leaders at Stanford can
learn something from the war with Iraq.
Something besides the need to respect in
ternational opinion and use violence only
as a last resort.
Leaders should also be able to identify
threats to stability and confront them,
even when doing so is challenging and un
popular and before violence is imminent.
Leaders should also know when easy solu
tions such as deterrence or diplomacy
have outlived their effectiveness and when
serious action is warranted.
The situation with Iraq is an example of
an emerging threat that peaceful solutions
cannot handle. Recent history shows that
Iraq is a threat to the United States and to
our allies, as well as to the stability in the
Middle East. It is also clear from the his
torical record the ineffectiveness of deter
rence and diplomacy in dealing with this
threat.
On many occasions, Iraq's government

publicly stated its desire to attack the Unit
ed States and its allies. Even in the face of
war, it has yet to backtrack.
The most recent public announcement
was Hussein's November 2000 call for all
Arabs to attack the interests of the United
States, British and Israeli interests world
wide. According to the Middle East Intel
ligence Bulletin (Jan. 2001), in December
2000, Iraq's state-controlled media an
nounced, "a number of Arabian Gull
states are likely to face explosions and op
erations against U.S. forces in these coun
tries."
In June 2002, a Kuwaiti newspaper
quoted top adviser to Hussein saying,
"The time has come to take the fight to
their own homes in America."
Another adviser said, "If [Osama] Bin
Laden truly did carry out the September
attacks as they claim, then as Allah is my
witness, we will prove to them that what
happened in September is a picnic com
pared to the wrath of Saddam Hussein."
These threats to the United States and
our allies have been repeated throughout

the 1990s — even before former Presi
dent George Bush's inauguration. In
1991, they were acted upon when Iraq at
tacked Israel and Kuwait. At no point has
Iraq shown any signs of changing its com
bative rhetoric.
Meanwhile, Iraq has sought chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons on many
documented occasions. It doesn't matter
who armed Iraq in the 1980s. The use of
these weapons against American troops or
civilians in 2003 would render significant
damage and must be prevented.
In spite of economic sanctions and in
spections, nuclear weapons are a realistic
goal for Iraq. The significantly weaker
North Korean economy was able to pay
for nuclear weapons and make them while
being inspected by the United Nations.
What would be different about Iraq?
The threat from Iraq is obvious, and
there is no realistic way to impede this
threat short of war. Deterrence and diplo
macy would fail as an alternative to war.
If nothing else, the current situ
ation demonstrates that Hussein
cannot be deterred. In the past few
months, Hussein has chosen al
most certain death above complete
cooperation or resignation. He
was likewise resistant to deterrence
in the Gulf War in 1991, when he
faced a much stronger American
force and an unclear post-war fate.
Deterring Hussein has failed in
the past. Why would it work in the
future if Iraq becomes a nuclear

power? Even if Hussein could be
deterred, nothing prevents him
from covertly giving weapons to
people who can't be deterred —
like the Sept. 11 hijackers.
Any diplomatic solution that
leaves Iraq in charge of its own
disarmament is bound to fail. If
promises meant anything to the
Hussein regime, there would be
no concern about his disarma
ment to begin with.
This is true even with inspec
tions. Iraq is too large to inspect
in the first place — the signifi
cantly smaller North Korean
regime was able to develop nucle
ar weapons in spite of ongoing

United Nations inspections and a
paltry economy. Iraq's history of
lack of cooperativeness with
weapons inspections makes thor
ough inspections even more un
likely.
Even a tougher inspections
regime would not work. The
world cannot pay indeterminate
attention to Iraq, and the United
States cannot indefinitely sustain
its military buildup. Without a
military buildup, it's doubtful
that Iraq would have taken steps
towards disarmament at all.
When deterrence and diplo
macy fail, there are only two re
maining options: Act now, or wait

for Iraq to fulfill its promises. It's
a pity that the United Nations
could not see the ineffectiveness
of more diplomacy, but nearly all
opposition countries released a
statement saying, "We hope our
posture on Iraq will not affect
normal relations with the U. 5.."
The move exposed the shal
lowness of the "alienation" U.S.
allies felt over our stance. Defense
policy is about national security,
not about being popular. Attack
ing Iraq was the right decision.
