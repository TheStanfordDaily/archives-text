# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Stanford's approach to diversity not feasible at state schools 
### ALEX GRENINGER TIM MEYER GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Recently, much ink has been spilt re
garding the future of affirmative action.
Unlike other national issues, affirmative
action will have a direct impact on univer
sities around the country, including Stan
ford. Because of this, much of the debate
(or liberal monologue) on campus has cen
tered on defending Stanford's implemen
tation of this policy.
However, the center of gravity of uni
versity education, and therefore affirma
tive action, is not Stanford, or other elite
institutions like it. Rather, it is large state
schools charged with providing higher ed
ucational opportunities fora significantly
greater number of students — not least
because they accept federal money. While
we accept the premise that racial / ethnic
diversity can contribute to the quality of
higher education, viewing affirmative ac
tion through a Stanford prism confounds
two important issues related to affirmative
action as it is generally applied nationally.
First, many of the forums for diversity
at Stanford are lacking at state schools.
Proponents of affirmative action contend
that diversity is an important component
of an individual's education both inside

and outside of the classroom. However, in
teraction outside the classroom has no
doubt provided a better venue for learn
ing through diversity at any school. Fur
thermore, at a state school in which class
sizes routinely number in the hundreds,
diversity in the classroom is simply not suf
ficient to ensure interaction.
At Stanford, the assumption that stu
dents regularly mingle socially and intel
lectually is not too far from the truth. Alter
all, the crown-jewel of the Stanford educa
tion comes in the form of Residential Edu
cation, which provides a forum for inter
action outside of academics. And, al
though maintaining ethnic theme dorms
would seem to hinder the potential of
Stanford's diversity, ResEd, combined
with the high real estate values in Palo
Alto, does an excellent job of ensuring that
diversity translates into education.
However, this is hardly the case at a
major state school, which typically has
trouble finding campus housing for its
freshman class. For instance, the Universi
ty of Texas at Austin has a rudimentary
campus residential program that boasts as
many spaces as Stanford's ResEd pro
gram, despite having a six-fold greater un
dergraduate enrollment. The University
of Michigan has 9,400 spots in its resi

dence halls for over 36,000 students. And,
although our friends across the Bay main
tain that 95 percent of incoming freshmen
live in campus housing, don't ask about
options for non-freshmen or what will
happen when the enrollment increases
dramatically over the next decade — an il
lustration of a broader trend that will
bring an estimated 2 million new students
to private and public schools nationwide
by 2010.
The prospect of any rapid change in
these housing situations is dour, as these
state schools often have space and use-per
mit limitations that make the Palo Alto City
Council look like the Bechtel Corporation.
In the absence of adequate campus hous
ing and residential education programs,
students predominantly self-select them
selves out of the intermingling pool, en
tailing campus diversity that shows up in
enrollment statistics but fails to translate
into true education.
The second difference that emerges
from a state-school perspective is the com
plete and utter loss of the "tie-breaker"
mentality in affirmative action. Broadly
speaking, Stanford picks up the statistical
outliers in the admissions pool — indeed,
it is often acknowledged that the next-best
2,300 students who didn't receive accep

tance letters could probably have suc
ceeded here as well.
However, the differences between ap
plicants to state-schools are necessarily
quite large. By now, everyone's familiar
with the intricacies of the University of
Michigan's 150-point admissions system,
which assigns up to 110 points for aca
demic factors (GPA, quality of school,
SAT score, etc.) as well as 20 points for
being a minority, scholarship athlete, or
socioeconomic-disadvantaged applicant.
The point value placed on these last cat
egories make them the most significant
classification except for GPA (so much so
that only six minority students would
have been accepted into the Michigan
Law School last year without the prefer
ences).
At the University of Texas at Austin
Law School before Hopwood (which
used a similar system as Michigan), the
automatic admission score for blacks and
Latinos was lower than the automatic re
jection score for whites and Asians. And,
as the amicus brief submitted by the As
sociation of American Medical Colleges
demonstrates, the overwhelming major
ity of underrepresented minority appli
cants to medical schools fall into the low
est GPA and MCAT quintiles.

These two points do not necessarily
argue for or against affirmative action in
absolutes. Rather, they indicate that af
firmative action alone is clearly not suffi
cient. Getting into schools should only be
the first step. A forum must be provided
to translate statistical diversity into edu
cational diversity. Otherwise, as indicat
ed by the disparities of applicants' aca
demic credentials nationally, schools are
incurring all of the costs of prioritizing
racial diversity without reaping the ben
efits. At Stanford, this is not really a prob
lem. Thus, misplaced analogies confuse
the issue.
In the end, not every school can have
the number of quality applicants or the
depth of financial resources that Stan
ford has. Given that, the question that re
mains for those campus affirmative ac
tion pundits (including us) is whether
Stanford's current policies can serve as a
model for other schools or whether they
are simply an anomaly in the tertiary ed
ucation system.

Council look like the Bechtel Corporation.
In the absence of adequate campus hous
ing and residential education programs,
students predominantly self-select them
selves out of the intermingling pool, en
tailing campus diversity that shows up in
enrollment statistics but fails to translate
into true education.
The second difference that emerges
from a state-school perspective is the com
plete and utter loss of the "tie-breaker"
mentality in affirmative action. Broadly
speaking, Stanford picks up the statistical
outliers in the admissions pool — indeed,
it is often acknowledged that the next-best
2,300 students who didn't receive accep

tance letters could probably have suc
ceeded here as well.
However, the differences between ap
plicants to state-schools are necessarily
quite large. By now, everyone's familiar
with the intricacies of the University of
Michigan's 150-point admissions system,
which assigns up to 110 points for aca
demic factors (GPA, quality of school,
SAT score, etc.) as well as 20 points for
being a minority, scholarship athlete, or
socioeconomic-disadvantaged applicant.
The point value placed on these last cat
egories make them the most significant
classification except for GPA (so much so
that only six minority students would
have been accepted into the Michigan
Law School last year without the prefer
ences).
At the University of Texas at Austin
Law School before Hopwood (which
used a similar system as Michigan), the
automatic admission score for blacks and
Latinos was lower than the automatic re
jection score for whites and Asians. And,
as the amicus brief submitted by the As
sociation of American Medical Colleges
demonstrates, the overwhelming major
ity of underrepresented minority appli
cants to medical schools fall into the low
est GPA and MCAT quintiles.

These two points do not necessarily
argue for or against affirmative action in
absolutes. Rather, they indicate that af
firmative action alone is clearly not suffi
cient. Getting into schools should only be
the first step. A forum must be provided
to translate statistical diversity into edu
cational diversity. Otherwise, as indicat
ed by the disparities of applicants' aca
demic credentials nationally, schools are
incurring all of the costs of prioritizing
racial diversity without reaping the ben
efits. At Stanford, this is not really a prob
lem. Thus, misplaced analogies confuse
the issue.
In the end, not every school can have
the number of quality applicants or the
depth of financial resources that Stan
ford has. Given that, the question that re
mains for those campus affirmative ac
tion pundits (including us) is whether
Stanford's current policies can serve as a
model for other schools or whether they
are simply an anomaly in the tertiary ed
ucation system.

Recently, much ink has been spilt re
garding the future of affirmative action.
Unlike other national issues, affirmative
action will have a direct impact on univer
sities around the country, including Stan
ford. Because of this, much of the debate
(or liberal monologue) on campus has cen
tered on defending Stanford's implemen
tation of this policy.
However, the center of gravity of uni
versity education, and therefore affirma
tive action, is not Stanford, or other elite
institutions like it. Rather, it is large state
schools charged with providing higher ed
ucational opportunities fora significantly
greater number of students — not least
because they accept federal money. While
we accept the premise that racial / ethnic
diversity can contribute to the quality of
higher education, viewing affirmative ac
tion through a Stanford prism confounds
two important issues related to affirmative
action as it is generally applied nationally.
First, many of the forums for diversity
at Stanford are lacking at state schools.
Proponents of affirmative action contend
that diversity is an important component
of an individual's education both inside

and outside of the classroom. However, in
teraction outside the classroom has no
doubt provided a better venue for learn
ing through diversity at any school. Fur
thermore, at a state school in which class
sizes routinely number in the hundreds,
diversity in the classroom is simply not suf
ficient to ensure interaction.
At Stanford, the assumption that stu
dents regularly mingle socially and intel
lectually is not too far from the truth. Alter
all, the crown-jewel of the Stanford educa
tion comes in the form of Residential Edu
cation, which provides a forum for inter
action outside of academics. And, al
though maintaining ethnic theme dorms
would seem to hinder the potential of
Stanford's diversity, ResEd, combined
with the high real estate values in Palo
Alto, does an excellent job of ensuring that
diversity translates into education.
However, this is hardly the case at a
major state school, which typically has
trouble finding campus housing for its
freshman class. For instance, the Universi
ty of Texas at Austin has a rudimentary
campus residential program that boasts as
many spaces as Stanford's ResEd pro
gram, despite having a six-fold greater un
dergraduate enrollment. The University
of Michigan has 9,400 spots in its resi

dence halls for over 36,000 students. And,
although our friends across the Bay main
tain that 95 percent of incoming freshmen
live in campus housing, don't ask about
options for non-freshmen or what will
happen when the enrollment increases
dramatically over the next decade — an il
lustration of a broader trend that will
bring an estimated 2 million new students
to private and public schools nationwide
by 2010.
The prospect of any rapid change in
these housing situations is dour, as these
state schools often have space and use-per
mit limitations that make the Palo Alto City
Council look like the Bechtel Corporation.
In the absence of adequate campus hous
ing and residential education programs,
students predominantly self-select them
selves out of the intermingling pool, en
tailing campus diversity that shows up in
enrollment statistics but fails to translate
into true education.
