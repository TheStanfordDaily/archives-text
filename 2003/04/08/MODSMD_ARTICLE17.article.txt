## Stanford men make waves in U.S. Nationals 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
Alter three days of intense competition at the
NCAA Championships last month, eight Stan
ford swimmers headed directly to Indianapolis
for the U.S. Nationals. Despite the challenges of
back-to-back competition, the team placed 12th
with 42 points among a talented field of
Olympic and internationally recognized ath
letes.
According to senior co-captain John Waters,
who took 17th in the 100-meter free, two Car
dinal swimmers in particular stood out among
the pack. Junior Gary Marshall, a transfer from
Virginia, was ineligible to compete during the
regular season. Marshall could swim at nation
als, however, and he finaled in four events,
swimming to fifth place in the 200-meter
breaststroke and 100-meter backstroke, eighth
in the 100-meter breaststroke and 13th in the
200-meter individual medley.
"Gary worked extremely hard this year but
never got to compete with us," Waters said.
"Next year he will be an official member and
I'm sure he will do some great things for the
team."
In addition, Jeff Rouse, a 1992 Stanford
graduate, also competed for the Cardinal.
Rouse, now 33, won a gold medal in the 400
medley relay and a silver medal in the 100 back
at the Barcelona Olympics. Rouse repeated his
gold medal victory in the relay in Atlanta in
1996, and he added another gold medal to his
collection with his win in the 100 back. After a
six-year retirement, Rouse returned to Stan
ford's pool six months ago to stage a comeback
for the 2004 Olympic Trials.
While at Nationals, Rouse swam away with
sixth in the 100 back in 56.32, and he took 19th
place in the 200 back in 2:05.81. Freshman To

bias Oriwol also competed in the 200 back, plac
ing 13th.
In the 200 fly, sophomore Jayme Cramer
placed 10th in 2:02.13. Cramer also scored in
the 200 free, finishing in 1:53.04 for 16th place.
After finishing third at the NCAA Champi

onships behind Auburn and Texas, the swim
mers had to refocus going into nationals.
"It was definitely challenging going straight
from NCAAs to nationals," Waters said. "We

We had some solid swims at na

ished just short of point contention
with their 17th and 20th place fin
ishes in the 100 fly, respectively. In
the 100 breast, Fowler swam away
with 24th.
"We have a really professional
team," Waters said. "We all like to
swim and to compete, so it was sec
ond nature for us to settle down
and to focus on the task at hand.
All of these guys went for it and let
their sense of competition lead
them through their races."
