# Gentry capitalizes on his second chance
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN EDITORIAL STAFF 
Sports are all about second chances
— second at-bats, second downs and sec
ond halves. But second chances of the
post-season win-or-go-home variety are a
rarity, when a meltdown amid high ex
pectations means one long wait before
the start of the next season.
Stanford sophomore wrestler Matt
Gentry was the recipient of one such sec
ond chance, capitalizing on it to win four
matches and earn honorable mention
All-American honors at the NCAA
Championships held March 20 to 22 in

Kansas City.
Gentry finished the regular season
with a 28-8 record, including a 12-0 mark
in dual meets and was considered a shoo
in to qualify for his second consecutive
trip to the NCAAs at the Pac-10 champi
onships where he was the top-seed at 157
pounds.
But following a first-round bye, Gen
try dropped a 9-8 decision to Boise
State's Ben Cherrington. After earning a
major decision in the consolation brack
et, Gentry fell to third-seeded Rocky
Smart and again to Oregon's Branson
Phillips.
"Mentally, 1 had put a lot of pressure

on myself and wrestled afraid to lose,"
Gentry said.
Only the top-four finishers at each
weight class received automatic bids to
the NCAA tournament and Gentry's 1-3
record placed him sixth. As a testament
to his impressive season, Gentry was
named first alternate by the Pac-10
coaches—a very complimentary gesture
but one that would mean very little unless
another Pac-10 qualifier dropped out.
"I was pretty bummed that I didn't ini
tially qualify, but at that point I knew that
if I ended up going, and hadn't been
training, I would have killed my
self for not toughing it out and
practicing," Gentry said. "That
was motivation enough to keep
training and hoping."
Shortly thereafter, Boise State
senior Nathan Ploehn went down
with an injury, opening the door
for Gentry.
In Kansas City, Gentry defeated
Northern lowa's Chris Bitetto 6-1
to open the tournament before
falling to second-seeded Keaton
Anderson of Ohio State, 12-4.
In the consolation bracket,
Gentry defeated Cornell's Gabe
Webster 5-3 for the second time
this season to secure his second
consecutive 30-win season and
keep his Ail-American aspirations
alive. The sophomore handled
Oklahoma State's Kenny Burlseon
11-4 in his next bout and then
grinded out a 5-3 victory over
Rider's Derek Jenkins.
"There's no point in losing if
you don't learn anything," Gentry
said. "My problems at Pac-lOs
were I was wasting all my time
thinking about winning and los
ing, instead of about just wrestling
my best and having fun. After Pac
10s and not qualifying, getting to

go to NCAAs was like wrestling on
borrowed time, so it put me in a
great position mentally to take all
the pressure off myself and just
compete."
Gentry's impressive run came
to an end when he was pinned by
Oklahoma State's Shane Roller at
3:43, one win shy of Ail-American

status. Roller was the Big 12
Champion at 157 and would go on
to place third.
Alter going 1-2 at NCAAs as a
freshman, Gentry finished the
weekend 4-2, having taken full ad
vantage of I he second chance that
allowed him to end his season the
way he ended matches along the

way — on a high note.
"I had a good season, a horrible
Pac-10 tournament and an awe
some NCAA tourney," Gentry
said. "1 wrestled my best tourna
ment all season at NCAAs, and
even in the matches I lost, I wres
tled really well and with a good at
titude."
