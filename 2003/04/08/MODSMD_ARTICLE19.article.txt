# Toppel's return sparks comeback
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Curt Toppel is back. In a major way.
The senior had been missing from the Stanford
lineup for 12-straight matches with a nagging ab
dominal pull, but made his presence felt over the
weekend in just his third and fourth matches back.
The first team All-American opposite hitter led
the No. 10 men's volleyball team (14-11, 11-8 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) to two important
weekend wins over No. 6 Long Beach St. (15-12, 9-
11 MPSF) and UC San Diego (6-20, 1-19 MPSF).
Toppel had a particularly spectacular Friday
night when the Cardinal took on the Forty Niners.
He dominated their defense to come away with a sea
son-high 30 kills and a .500 hitting percentage. He
also added a service ace and three digs.
Toppel and the rest of the Cardinal team came
into the weekend sitting in seventh place in a con
ference where only the top eight teams advance to
the playoffs.
With its two victories, Stanford comes away need
ing only one win in its final three conference match
es to clinch a playoff berth.
"It definitely helps to have [Toppel] out there,"
coach Don Shaw said. "To have that kind of fire
power added to the lineup makes a big difference.
When he is in the game our lineup gets bigger. Our
blocking improves and having that go-to guy also
makes a really big difference."
Friday's convincing win over Long Beach was the
Cardinal's first in three attempts this season.

finish off the first game 30-27 on a
kill by none other than Toppel.
However, Long Beach was ut
terly unfazed by the strong Stan
ford start and took control of
game two with impressive play
from junior outside hitter Scott
Touzinsky and freshman outside
hitter Robert Tarr.
Riding the play of Touzinsky
and Tarr, the Niners took care of
business to tie up the match by
winning game two on one of
Touzinsky's 22 kills.
After Long Beach's strong
game-two performance, it
seemed that the momentum had
swung away from the Cardinal as
the Niners continued to roll,
jumping out to a quick 7-2 lead.
Stanford charged back to tie
the score at 18, forcing errors
along the way with its sound de
fensive play.
The score remained close for
the remainder of the game, but
the Cardinal got a key block
from sophomore middle blocker
Craig Buell and senior outside
hitter Billy Strickland, which

was promptly followed by a kill
from Strickland on game point.
Stanford needed another
comeback in game four, falling
behind 28-25, but it was able to
reel off five points in a row to fin
ish oft'the match.
"I think Long Beach was
stunned at the end of that fourth
game," Shaw said. "They were
fully expecting to go to a fifth
game, but we scored those five
straight points."
In addition to the strong indi
vidual play from Toppel, red
shirt sophomore setter Kevin
Hansen did a beautiful job or
chestrating the Cardinal offense,
coming away with 58 assists.
After showing its overpower
ing offense on Friday, the Cardi
nal played stellar defense on Sat
urday against the Tritons, in a
match that it dominated from
start to finish.
Stanford out-blocked San
Diego 16.5-8.5 in addition to
recording a solid 33 digs to hold
the Tritons to a miserable .061
hitting percentage.
"San Diego was one of those
matches where you look at their
record and you just expect them to
not be as good, but they always
give you a battle," Shaw said. "But

we jumped on them right away
and got a big lead right at the be
ginning."
Toppel again led the Cardinal
in kills, recording a match-high
13 kills in the Stanford sweep.
Strickland also had a solid
match for Stanford, racking up
10 kills and a match-high nine
digs.
Tonight the Cardinal faces a
familiar opponent in No. 4 Pacif
ic (18-10, 12-7 MPSF), which it
will be seeing for the fifth time
this season.
"They've changed their lineup
since the last time we saw them so
there will be some adjustments to
make," Shaw said. "It's the same
[game] plan though. We need to
serve aggressively so we can make
it hard for them to run their of
fense. It's really just a matter of
executing though."
Stanford has come away with
three wins over the Tigers this
season and a fourth would clinch
an all-important spot in the MPSF
tournament.
"From now on, everything
matters in a big way," Shaw said.
"If we win [against Pacific] and
then continue to win, we may end
up with a home-court first game
in the playoffs."

two wins this weekend, moving it within one win of earning a berth in the
MPSF playoffs.
finish off the first game 30-27 on a
kill by none other than Toppel.
However, Long Beach was ut
terly unfazed by the strong Stan
ford start and took control of
game two with impressive play
from junior outside hitter Scott
Touzinsky and freshman outside
hitter Robert Tarr.
Riding the play of Touzinsky
and Tarr, the Niners took care of
business to tie up the match by
winning game two on one of
Touzinsky's 22 kills.
After Long Beach's strong
game-two performance, it
seemed that the momentum had
swung away from the Cardinal as
the Niners continued to roll,
jumping out to a quick 7-2 lead.
Stanford charged back to tie
the score at 18, forcing errors
along the way with its sound de
fensive play.
The score remained close for
the remainder of the game, but
the Cardinal got a key block
from sophomore middle blocker
Craig Buell and senior outside
hitter Billy Strickland, which

was promptly followed by a kill
from Strickland on game point.
Stanford needed another
comeback in game four, falling
behind 28-25, but it was able to
reel off five points in a row to fin
ish oft'the match.
"I think Long Beach was
stunned at the end of that fourth
game," Shaw said. "They were
fully expecting to go to a fifth
game, but we scored those five
straight points."
In addition to the strong indi
vidual play from Toppel, red
shirt sophomore setter Kevin
Hansen did a beautiful job or
chestrating the Cardinal offense,
coming away with 58 assists.
After showing its overpower
ing offense on Friday, the Cardi
nal played stellar defense on Sat
urday against the Tritons, in a
match that it dominated from
start to finish.
Stanford out-blocked San
Diego 16.5-8.5 in addition to
recording a solid 33 digs to hold
the Tritons to a miserable .061
hitting percentage.
"San Diego was one of those
matches where you look at their
record and you just expect them to
not be as good, but they always
give you a battle," Shaw said. "But

we jumped on them right away
and got a big lead right at the be
ginning."
Toppel again led the Cardinal
in kills, recording a match-high
13 kills in the Stanford sweep.
Strickland also had a solid
match for Stanford, racking up
10 kills and a match-high nine
digs.
Tonight the Cardinal faces a
familiar opponent in No. 4 Pacif
ic (18-10, 12-7 MPSF), which it
will be seeing for the fifth time
this season.
"They've changed their lineup
since the last time we saw them so
there will be some adjustments to
make," Shaw said. "It's the same
[game] plan though. We need to
serve aggressively so we can make
it hard for them to run their of
fense. It's really just a matter of
executing though."
Stanford has come away with
three wins over the Tigers this
season and a fourth would clinch
an all-important spot in the MPSF
tournament.
"From now on, everything
matters in a big way," Shaw said.
"If we win [against Pacific] and
then continue to win, we may end
up with a home-court first game
in the playoffs."

Waterpolo handed second loss of the season
After an 11 -3 victory over No. 17 UC-lrvine on Friday led by junior Lauren Fausf s (pictured) career-high
four goals, the No. 2 women's water polo team dropped only its second game of the season to
No. 4 Long Beach State, 8-7. This gives the team a season record of 14-2 and marks the first time in the
team's history that it has lost to Long Beach.
Curt Toppel is back. In a major way.
The senior had been missing from the Stanford
lineup for 12-straight matches with a nagging ab
dominal pull, but made his presence felt over the
weekend in just his third and fourth matches back.
The first team All-American opposite hitter led
the No. 10 men's volleyball team (14-11, 11-8 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) to two important
weekend wins over No. 6 Long Beach St. (15-12, 9-
11 MPSF) and UC San Diego (6-20, 1-19 MPSF).
Toppel had a particularly spectacular Friday
night when the Cardinal took on the Forty Niners.
He dominated their defense to come away with a sea
son-high 30 kills and a .500 hitting percentage. He
also added a service ace and three digs.
Toppel and the rest of the Cardinal team came
into the weekend sitting in seventh place in a con
ference where only the top eight teams advance to
the playoffs.
With its two victories, Stanford comes away need
ing only one win in its final three conference match
es to clinch a playoff berth.
"It definitely helps to have [Toppel] out there,"
coach Don Shaw said. "To have that kind of fire
power added to the lineup makes a big difference.
When he is in the game our lineup gets bigger. Our
blocking improves and having that go-to guy also
makes a really big difference."
Friday's convincing win over Long Beach was the
Cardinal's first in three attempts this season.
Stanford set the tone early, jumping out to a 12-7
