# Bon Appetit loses Tresidder
## University Dining to provide food services starting next fall; future of workers uncertain 
### ERIC ROSSER ELDON EDITORIAL STAFF 
Last Friday, Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni announced that Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises will take con
trol of Tresidder food service operations,
which were formerly under lease to Bon Ap
petit Management Company.
Bon Appetit, a private corporation that
has been at Stanford since 1989, will continue
operating at the CoHo and its other Bon Ap
petit Tresidder food service facilities until
Oct. 1,2003, when Stanford Dining will move
in. Stanford Dining's plans range from im
proving Tresidder's aesthetics to allowing
students to use meal plan points to buy food.
The Treehouse, Jamba Juice and Tresidder
Express, which are not affiliated with Bon
Appetit, will not be affected.
"Over the past several years, we have un

dergone a process of evaluation resulting in
significant upgrades that have transformed
food service in the residential dining halls,"
said Awakuni in a press release issued by the
University. "In that context, it made sense to
look next at the Tresidder facilities and deter
mine how we might improve the service and
expand the variety of offerings. This realign
ment will allow us to make changes that I be
lieve will better serve students, faculty, staff and
visitors who frequent the core campus area."
Students and other employees who work
at the CoHo are still finding out about the
change.
"I wasn't told much, because I haven't had
a shift so far this quarter, but I heard from
coworkers that Bon Appetit has lost its con
tract with Stanford after months of talks be
tween Bon Appetit and the University," said
sophomore Itamar Rosenn, who has worked
as a "barista," or server, at the CoHo since the
beginning of his freshman year. "Stanford
Dining Services is supposedly taking over,
and all of our jobs are very much in question."
