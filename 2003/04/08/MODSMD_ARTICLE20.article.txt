# Ode to the women's March Madness
## 
### 
r 1 *^' e Outlook was very
promising for the UT
Horns that day, With
.JL. two teams in the Pinal
Four with but two games each to
play.
And then when Carmelo
seemed unstoppable and McNa
mara did the same, A cloud of
doubt was cast about the patrons
of the game.
A drunken duo shouted out
"Hook 'em Horns" as they arose
from their chair. The rest clung
to that hope which springs eter
nal in the human breast;
That if only TJ could but get
some open space — We'd put up
even money now with TJ in
their face.
But the 2-3 zone impeded TJ,
as did Jimmy Boeheim. And be
cause the former stopped the
Horn's potent offense, UT
could not come from behind.
So upon that stricken multi
tude grim melancholy lie, For
with mighty UConn awaiting in
the women's draw, there
seemed but little chance of a bas
ketball championship tonight.
But Heather Schreiber let
loose a three, to the wonder
ment of none, And Stacy
Stephens, the anchor inside, was
getting the job done.
And when the excitement
had settled and the fans saw
what had occurred, There was
Texas with a nine-point lead,
with the minutes on the clock
reading 12 and one-third.
Then from thousands of

Texan throats there rose a
mighty twang. It rumbled
through the Georgia Dome, and
the Huskies were saying,
"Dang".
It rumbled loudly down
Peachtree Street with all its
majesty and clout, For Carey,
mighty Jamie Carey, was shoot
ing the ball lights-out.
There was ease in Carey's
manner as she stroked another
ti e, There was pride on Carey's
countenance as harder she con
tinued to play.
And when responding to the
cheers she pumped her fist in
exultation, No Longhorn in the
crowd could doubt that at least
one Texas team would receive
their coronation.
Twenty ESPN cameras were
on them as they emerged from
the timeout, three ESPN com
mentators applauded what was
turning into a rout.
Then while Diana Taurasi
stood poised to inbound the ball,
Defiance gleamed in the Texas
skies; they were going to win it all.
And now the leather-covered
sphere went sailing through the
air, and UT stood a-watching as
it found its mark straight and
fair.
Close by the watchful referee,
eyeing the shooter's head. "Her
foot was on the line," said Carey.
"3-pointer," the referee said.
From the benches, soaked in
peanuts and Coors, there arose
a muffled roar, Like the shrieks of
a Dallas Afternoon after a lopsided
Cowboy's score.
"Kill him, Kill the ref!" shouted
someone in the stands. And it's
likely they'd have killed him if not
for the cops roving in bands.
Willi a smile of crystal clarity
great Carey's visage shone; She ig
nored the rising tumult, she bade
the game go on.
The Huskies got the ball back
and once more the spheroid flew;
It was harder for Cary to ignore it,
as the Huskies were within two.
"Oh no!" cried the maddened
thousands and the echo rang out
"fraud";
But one determined look from
UT players and the quickly sober
ing audience was awed.
They saw their faces grow cold
and stern, saw their muscles strain.
And they new that Carey wouldn't

let UT basketball lose in the semis
once again.
The smiles are gone from
Longhorn lips, their gazes radiat
ing hate. That nine-point lead is
now a two-point deficit and the
game is getting late.
And now the Horns have one
last chance and a sharpshooting
specialist to boot, And now the ball
is in her hands and she raises up to
shoot.
Oh! somewhere in this favored
land the sun is shining bright;
The band is playing somewhere
and somewhere hearts are light,
And somewhere men are
laughing and somewhere children
shout; But there is no joy in Austin
— the mighty Longhorns have
been knocked out.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and he would like to thank
Ernest Thayer for letting him shameful
ly rip off "Casey at the Bat" like this, and
the UT basketball teams, for finally giv
ing him an excuse to do so. He can be
reached at ryanstew@stanford.edu.
