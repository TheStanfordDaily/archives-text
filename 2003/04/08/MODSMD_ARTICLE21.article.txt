# Kansas watches final shot come up short
## Orangemen win NCAAs 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The freshmen
were fabulous early and the "Helicopter"
swooped in late. Syracuse coach Jim Boe
heim got the final four seconds right this
time, winning a championship that had
eluded him for decades.
Freshmen Carmelo Anthony and Gerry
McNainara helped the Orangemen take a
big lead and Hakim Warrick made a huge
block at the end last night to preserve a
thrilling 81-78 victory over Kansas.
"We played the best first half we could
play, and then we just hung on," said Boe
heim, in his 27th year at his alma mater.
Leading by three, Warrick missed two
free throws that would have sealed the
game with 13.5 seconds left. But the 6-foot
-8 forward, nicknamed "The Helicopter"
for his 7-foot armspan, made up for it by
coming from nowhere to swat a 3-point at
tempt by Michael Lee that would have tied
it with 1.5 seconds left.
"I definitely wanted to go out there and
make a play after missing those free
throws," Warrick said. "I saw a guy open in
the corner and I knew they needed to hit a
three, so I just tried to fly at him."
Kirk Hinrich, cold all night, followed
with an airbali at the buzzer and the Or
angemen (30-5) ran onto the floor to cele

brate their first title.
Boeheim threw his arms in the air and
ran to shake hands with Roy Williams, the
15-year Kansas coach who was deprived
once again of the championship.
"I've never been one to like moral victo
ries, and I don't like this one," Williams
said. "Rut I love the competitiveness of my
kids."
Indeed, they had quite a hill to climb
after the first half, and quite a group of play
ers to stop.
McNamara hit six 3-pointers, all in the first
half, to finish with 18 points. Anthony showed
he is certainly ready for the NBA if he choos
es, fighting off a bad back to finish with 20
points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.
"All my hard work just paid off tonight,"
Anthony said. "I paid a physical toll the
whole night, the whole tournament. The
whole season, everybody's been beating me
up < .oath told me to tough it up."
He helped make Boeheim the winner in
the marquee coaching matchup of brilliant
tacticians who had never won it all.
Sixteen years ago, Syracuse lost by one to
Indiana on Keith Smart's game-winner
with four seconds left on the same Super-

dome floor. Boeheim said he
wanted to get the last four seconds
right this time, and he did —just
barely.
"I didn't want it to be another
one of those Keith Smart shots,"
Warrick said, referring to his
game-saving block.
After the first half, it didn't look
as if he'd have to sweat it.
The Orangemen built their
lead to 18 during a breakneck first
20 minutes. But things ground to
a halt in the second, and it was
Boeheim's famous 2-3 zone that
closed out the game.
The Jayhawks never really
found the outside touch to force
the Orangemen to guard them up
high. Hinrich shot 6-for-20 — 3-
for-12 from 3-point range. He
missed twice with a chance to tie in
the closing seconds, including one
that went halfway down the net be
fore rattling out.
Inside, Boeheim's 'D' came close
to turning Kansas into a one-man
show. Ail-American forward Nick
Collison was valiant and brilliant —
he finished with 19 points and 21
rebounds. But in the end, he simply
didn't have enough help against
the tall and long Syracuse players
and that well-coached defense.
There was also one fatal flaw
that had nothing to do with Syra
cuse's defense: The Jayhawks
missed an amazing 18 of 30 free
throws; Collison went 3-for-10.
In some ways, bad free-throw
shooting can be corrected. Other
things just can't be coached. Exhibit
A was McNamara, Anthony, War
rick — the whole Syracuse team, re
ally — who played a one-on-one
style of offense that looked as if it
came straight from the playground.
McNamara was relentless, un
abashedly hoisting shots from 23,
24, 25 feet and making almost all

of them. By the end of the first
half, he was 6-for-8 — his season
high — and the Orangemen led
53-42. The 53 were the most
points scored by one team in the
first half of a title game.
Was McNamara the best player
out there?
Ask any of the three or four
players who had the task of guard
ing Anthony, the Final Four's
Most Outstanding Flayer, after he
took passes at the top of the key.
Before his back started acting
up, Anthony look destined to join
Dwyane Wade of Marquette as the
second player with a triple-double
in this year's tournament. As it
was, he finished three assists shy.
Even with Anthony struggling
down the stretch, Kansas couldn't
play catchup well enough to tie or
take the lead. A great chance came
with 14 minutes left when, trailing
61-58, the Jayhawks picked off a
bad pass and started rushing down
court. But Kansas turned it right
back over, and Anthony made a 3-
pointer to keep the Orange ahead.
Syracuse stretched it to 12 with
7 1/2 minutes left, and KU could
never overcome after that.
It was another bitter defeat for
Williams, who stayed without the
one victory that would have
rounded out an otherwise impec
cable resume.
Now, his next task is to decide
whether he's interested in the
opening at North Carolina, his
alma mater, or wants to return to
Kansas to try to complete his still
unfinished business.
Boeheim, meanwhile, im
proved to 1-2 in title Nine
years after the 1987 loss, Syracuse
fell to Kentucky in the final.
He insisted he would coach the
same as he always does in the final,
and by the looks of things he did.
He also called "foolishness" the no
tion that a win in this game would
make him a better coach.
That, for now at least, is still
open for debate.

There was also one fatal flaw
that had nothing to do with Syra
cuse's defense: The Jayhawks
missed an amazing 18 of 30 free
throws; Collison went 3-for-10.
In some ways, bad free-throw
shooting can be corrected. Other
things just can't be coached. Exhibit
A was McNamara, Anthony, War
rick — the whole Syracuse team, re
ally — who played a one-on-one
style of offense that looked as if it
came straight from the playground.
McNamara was relentless, un
abashedly hoisting shots from 23,
24, 25 feet and making almost all

of them. By the end of the first
half, he was 6-for-8 — his season
high — and the Orangemen led
53-42. The 53 were the most
points scored by one team in the
first half of a title game.
Was McNamara the best player
out there?
Ask any of the three or four
players who had the task of guard
ing Anthony, the Final Four's
Most Outstanding Flayer, after he
took passes at the top of the key.
Before his back started acting
up, Anthony look destined to join
Dwyane Wade of Marquette as the
second player with a triple-double
in this year's tournament. As it
was, he finished three assists shy.
Even with Anthony struggling
down the stretch, Kansas couldn't
play catchup well enough to tie or
take the lead. A great chance came
with 14 minutes left when, trailing
61-58, the Jayhawks picked off a
bad pass and started rushing down
court. But Kansas turned it right
back over, and Anthony made a 3-
pointer to keep the Orange ahead.
Syracuse stretched it to 12 with
7 1/2 minutes left, and KU could
never overcome after that.
It was another bitter defeat for
Williams, who stayed without the
one victory that would have
rounded out an otherwise impec
cable resume.
Now, his next task is to decide
whether he's interested in the
opening at North Carolina, his
alma mater, or wants to return to
Kansas to try to complete his still
unfinished business.
Boeheim, meanwhile, im
proved to 1-2 in title Nine
years after the 1987 loss, Syracuse
fell to Kentucky in the final.
He insisted he would coach the
same as he always does in the final,
and by the looks of things he did.
He also called "foolishness" the no
tion that a win in this game would
make him a better coach.
That, for now at least, is still
open for debate.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The freshmen
were fabulous early and the "Helicopter"
swooped in late. Syracuse coach Jim Boe
heim got the final four seconds right this
time, winning a championship that had
eluded him for decades.
Freshmen Carmelo Anthony and Gerry
McNainara helped the Orangemen take a
big lead and Hakim Warrick made a huge
block at the end last night to preserve a
thrilling 81-78 victory over Kansas.
"We played the best first half we could
play, and then we just hung on," said Boe
heim, in his 27th year at his alma mater.
Leading by three, Warrick missed two
free throws that would have sealed the
game with 13.5 seconds left. But the 6-foot
-8 forward, nicknamed "The Helicopter"
for his 7-foot armspan, made up for it by
coming from nowhere to swat a 3-point at
tempt by Michael Lee that would have tied
it with 1.5 seconds left.
"I definitely wanted to go out there and
make a play after missing those free
throws," Warrick said. "I saw a guy open in
the corner and I knew they needed to hit a
three, so I just tried to fly at him."
Kirk Hinrich, cold all night, followed
with an airbali at the buzzer and the Or
angemen (30-5) ran onto the floor to cele

brate their first title.
Boeheim threw his arms in the air and
ran to shake hands with Roy Williams, the
15-year Kansas coach who was deprived
once again of the championship.
"I've never been one to like moral victo
ries, and I don't like this one," Williams
said. "Rut I love the competitiveness of my
kids."
Indeed, they had quite a hill to climb
after the first half, and quite a group of play
ers to stop.
McNamara hit six 3-pointers, all in the first
half, to finish with 18 points. Anthony showed
he is certainly ready for the NBA if he choos
es, fighting off a bad back to finish with 20
points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.
"All my hard work just paid off tonight,"
Anthony said. "I paid a physical toll the
whole night, the whole tournament. The
whole season, everybody's been beating me
up < .oath told me to tough it up."
He helped make Boeheim the winner in
the marquee coaching matchup of brilliant
tacticians who had never won it all.
Sixteen years ago, Syracuse lost by one to
Indiana on Keith Smart's game-winner
with four seconds left on the same Super-

dome floor. Boeheim said he
wanted to get the last four seconds
right this time, and he did —just
barely.
"I didn't want it to be another
one of those Keith Smart shots,"
Warrick said, referring to his
game-saving block.
After the first half, it didn't look
as if he'd have to sweat it.
The Orangemen built their
lead to 18 during a breakneck first
20 minutes. But things ground to
a halt in the second, and it was
Boeheim's famous 2-3 zone that
closed out the game.
The Jayhawks never really
found the outside touch to force
the Orangemen to guard them up
high. Hinrich shot 6-for-20 — 3-
for-12 from 3-point range. He
missed twice with a chance to tie in
the closing seconds, including one
that went halfway down the net be
fore rattling out.
Inside, Boeheim's 'D' came close
to turning Kansas into a one-man
show. Ail-American forward Nick
Collison was valiant and brilliant —
he finished with 19 points and 21
rebounds. But in the end, he simply
didn't have enough help against
the tall and long Syracuse players
and that well-coached defense.
