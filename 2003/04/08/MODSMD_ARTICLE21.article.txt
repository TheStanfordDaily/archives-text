# Kansas watches final shot come up short
## Orangemen win NCAAs 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The freshmen
were fabulous early and the "Helicopter"
swooped in late. Syracuse coach Jim Boe
heim got the final four seconds right this
time, winning a championship that had
eluded him for decades.
Freshmen Carmelo Anthony and Gerry
McNainara helped the Orangemen take a
big lead and Hakim Warrick made a huge
block at the end last night to preserve a
thrilling 81-78 victory over Kansas.
"We played the best first half we could
play, and then we just hung on," said Boe
heim, in his 27th year at his alma mater.
Leading by three, Warrick missed two
free throws that would have sealed the
game with 13.5 seconds left. But the 6-foot
-8 forward, nicknamed "The Helicopter"
for his 7-foot armspan, made up for it by
coming from nowhere to swat a 3-point at
tempt by Michael Lee that would have tied
it with 1.5 seconds left.
"I definitely wanted to go out there and
make a play after missing those free
throws," Warrick said. "I saw a guy open in
the corner and I knew they needed to hit a
three, so I just tried to fly at him."
Kirk Hinrich, cold all night, followed
with an airbali at the buzzer and the Or
angemen (30-5) ran onto the floor to cele

brate their first title.
Boeheim threw his arms in the air and
ran to shake hands with Roy Williams, the
15-year Kansas coach who was deprived
once again of the championship.
"I've never been one to like moral victo
ries, and I don't like this one," Williams
said. "Rut I love the competitiveness of my
kids."
Indeed, they had quite a hill to climb
after the first half, and quite a group of play
ers to stop.
McNamara hit six 3-pointers, all in the first
half, to finish with 18 points. Anthony showed
he is certainly ready for the NBA if he choos
es, fighting off a bad back to finish with 20
points, 10 rebounds and seven assists.
"All my hard work just paid off tonight,"
Anthony said. "I paid a physical toll the
whole night, the whole tournament. The
whole season, everybody's been beating me
up < .oath told me to tough it up."
He helped make Boeheim the winner in
the marquee coaching matchup of brilliant
tacticians who had never won it all.
Sixteen years ago, Syracuse lost by one to
Indiana on Keith Smart's game-winner
with four seconds left on the same Super-
