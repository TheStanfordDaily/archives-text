# Tough conditions give crew added challenge

### RACHAEL HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The course at the San Diego Crew Classic
may be a straight run, but a knock-out duo of
wind and tide combine to make the regatta one
of the most difficult to row.
This past weekend, those conditions worked
against the Stanford crew team. After promis
ing heats on Saturday, the Cardinal had disap
pointing finishes in both the men's and
women's races on Sunday.
"You want perfect water and in crew you
don't always get that," said varsity captain Sab
rina Kolker. "The crews that dealt with the con
ditions the best beat us by 3 seconds."
The Stanford varsity women won their heat
on Saturday, placing third in the grand final be
hind California and Washington.
The varsity boat started in the coveted lane
two between California and Washington, but
was buffeted by the water early in the race. The
Cardinal fought for position against the Bears
and the Huskies for the rest of the course, stay
ing within three seats of the leaders.
USC also moved ahead, but Stanford was
able to push back in the last 10 strokes to slide
in at third place. The final times for the top
three were Cal at 6 minutes and 42.5 seconds,
Washington at 6:42.58 and Stanford at 6:45.65.
Kolker said although the varsity boat had
gone into the race with high expectations, the
Cardinal was unable to find a rhythm that
clicked.
"San Diego is one of those races where you
want to do your best and it doesn't always work
out that way," Kolker said.
After placing second in their heat, the Stan
ford men began their race in lane four, between
Temple and OSU. The Cardinal crossed the
500-meter mark at the middle of the pack, just
behind Cal and Washington, but after a crab at
the midway point stopped the boat, the Cardi
nal fell to fifth place behind OSU and Temple.
Unable to recover their previous speed, the
men ultimately finished sixth, behind UCD.
The men finished with a time of 6:26, 30 sec
onds behind Cal.
"The positive spin on our experience was
that we had three boats in the finals," said men's
head coach Craig Amerkhanian.
The lightweight women also had technical
problems within their race. After a fast start, de

scribed by stroke seat Kerin Lanyi as "the best
start of our lives," the lightweight boat unex
pectedly veered from lane one to lane two.
Lanyi said she wasn't sure what had caused
the mishap.
"A million things might have caused it," she
said. "It's really easy to get into the other lane
and really difficult to get out."
The lightweights were able to recover, bring
ing the boat back together fora strong finish,
but the damage had been done.
"By the time they got the course corrected,
they were five seconds behind Wisconsin and
Villanova was even," said lightweight head
coach A1 Acosta.
Villanova and Stanford then fought to the
finish, with Villanova ultimately beating the
Cardinal by .43 seconds with a time of 7:16.95.
Wisconsin finished with a time of 7:08.6.
Acosta emphasized the positive, noting that
the lightweights were much closer to their com
petition than last year.
"To have all this stuff go on in the race and

end up only nine seconds behind Wisconsin,
the kids are encouraged by that," he said.
In other races, the second varsity women
placed fifth in the grand final, the lightweight
second boat was second in the petite final,
novice women placed fourth in the petite final
and second varsity men placed fifth in the final.
Ultimately, women's head coach Aimee
Baker said the losses will provide an incentive to
help Stanford train for races later in the season.
"I'd rather them walk around with a chip on
their shoulder than a medal around their
necks. It keeps them hungry" said Baker. "This
may be a loser talking but I don't think the San
Diego Crew Classic is the one to win.
Baker said the Cardinal will be looking
ahead to the Pac-10 and NCAA competitions
later in the spring.
Kolker agreed, noting that the current un
derdog mentality will help the team push hard
er.
"That just fueled our fire, because we're that
kind of crew," she said.

and women's teams had disappointing finishes.
