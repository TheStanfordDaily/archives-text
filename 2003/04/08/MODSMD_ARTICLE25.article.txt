Daily's 'recent treatment of the
[crossword] puzzle is a travesty!'
First, I must confess that I am one of
those people who works on the crossword
puzzle in class. In my defense, I try to be
discreet, I do participate in class
discussions, and it doesn't seem to have
harmed my grades any.
I was dismayed this year when you
switched from The New York 'limes to the
Tribune Media crossword puzzle — the
first could take me an entire day's worth of
classes to complete, while the latter often
lasts for less than one class. But your
recent treatment of the puzzle is a travesty!
A column-width in the classified ads is
not enough space in which to print a

puzzle. The text is rendered in at best 2-
point type, and in the Friday Daily, the
puzzle was compressed vertically,
rendering it entirely unreadable.
If you must reduce the size of the
puzzle, at least leave it large enough to
read. Perhaps you could reduce the size of
the space given to those annoying little
rabbits?

Note: The Daily slopped running The New York Times
crossword puzzle because the cost was prohibitive. The
recent depiction of the Tribune Media Services Crossword
in a one-inch by one-inch space was intended as a joke.
Clearly, this humorous riposte failed. The Daily apologizes
for the confusion.
