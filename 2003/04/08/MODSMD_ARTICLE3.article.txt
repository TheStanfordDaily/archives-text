# Cottages vacated as precaution for SARS quarantine

### ANTHONY HA EDITORIAL STAFF 
Housing Assignment Services is evicting nine students
from their cottages at Murray and Yost to create space which
may be needed in the future to house community members
displaying pre-SARS symptoms. Jane Camarillo, director of
Residential Education, and Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Student Health Center, met with students from the two dorms
last night to explain the University's decision.
"In the context of world events, including the SARS situa
tion, the [University] decided that it was prudent to make the
cottages available for their original purpose, which is for stu
dents and others with short-term on-campus housing needs,

including isolation for infectious
diseases such as SARS," Friedman
said.
SARS, or Severe Acute Respira
tory Syndrome, is an illness with
symptoms including a fever and
dry cough that is spread primarily
through air droplets, such as those
from a cough or sneeze. Nine cases
of SARS have reported in Santa
Clara County, which Friedman
said was"a larger number than
most everywhere else."
According to Friedman, the de
cision was made last week by a
group of representatives from
many Stanford offices, including
Housing, Residential Education,
the Dean of Students, Student Af
fairs and Vaden.
He added there no reported
cases of SARS on campus and that
students in surrounding dorms
will not be at any risk.
"It is a precautionary measure,"
Friedman said. "Vaden continues
active surveillance for students
who have the travel or exposure
history and symptoms suggestive
of SARS."
The tone of the meeting be
tween students and administra
tors, which was closed to The
Daily, seemed to be set by a mes
sage written on the dry-erase
board in Murray: "Emergency
House Meeting to support our
EVICTED cottage residents."
Following the two-hour meet
ing, students left the Murray din
ing area talking angrily amongst
themselves. Many of them claimed
that Friedman and Camarillo had
not adequately addressed all of
their concerns.
"Basically, we asked them a lot
of questions, but they never direct
ly answered us," said sophomore
Seyi Akanni, a Murray resident.
Some said that they sympa
thized with the University's posi
tion, but still believed that adminis

trators had acted inappropriately.
"This is the right thing to do
from a public health standpoint,
but they've gone about it really
poorly and with extremely bad
timing," said sophomore Chris
Lin.
The cottage residents were first
informed of their reassignment on
Friday afternoon when they re
ceived an e-mail from Todd Ben
son, director of Housing Assign
ment Services, telling them they
would have to move out by today.
The only explanation offered was
"current events internationally."
Junior Lauren Rue, a focus as
sistant in Murray, said her biggest
concern was that the students
being evicted were only told after
the decision was made and that
dorm staff members first heard
about the decision from the evict
ed students, not from University
officials.
"The biggest issue is the lack of
student voice or respect for stu
dent concerns," Rue said. "I don't
think that it was all intentionally
done to exclude student voice, it's
just that somebody dropped the
ball many, many times, and it
could definitely happen again."
The Resident Agreement
signed by all students when they
accept University housing in
cludes a clause allowing the Uni
versity to move students when nec
essary. The clause begins, "The
University reserves the right to re
assign you to another room or res
idence at any time during the term
of this agreement."
According to Rue, none of the
students have started to move out
yet, largely because many initially
thought the e-mail had been a
hoax.
Sophomore Karan Mahajan,
one of the students being reas
signed, denounced the Universi
ty's actions.
"As a student, I understand the
implications of a major health risk
such as SARS and am willing to
back up all efforts to contain it,"
Mahajan said. "However, the way

the administration has handled
the process has been astonishingly
unprofessional and unhelpful."
He added, "Why has Housing
been so underhanded and secre
tive about the procedure? Don't
students — whose housing, acade
mic schedules and state-of-mind
are going to be seriously affect
ed — have the right to be in
formed of such an important deci
sion?"
When asked about student con
cerns that they were not adequate
ly consulted and informed in this
process, Benson said, "We did re
spond to all students by Monday
morning at the latest. I certainly
apologize to anyone who felt that
we didn't respond in a timely man
ner — our goal is to be as respon
sive as we possibly can be."
Benson added that Housing
will also make staff available on re
quest to assist in the move, will pay
the cost of reconnecting phones
and cable and will consider on a
"case-by-case basis" whether or not
to give reassigned students anoth
er preferred year in the Draw.
After the meeting, Camarillo ac
knowledged that not everyone
had been satisfied by the discus
sion.
"We can't always address every
one's concerns in a meeting like
this," Camarillo said. "It's good to
just have a place for students to ex
press their opinion."
She added that students
weren't given more information in
Friday's e-mail because, "I don't
think we had any other informa
tion that we could have given
them. What we knew was pretty
vague."
Camarillo said that not all stu
dents will be out of the cottages
today because some of them have
yet to receive their new housing as
signments.

timing," said sophomore Chris
Lin.
The cottage residents were first
informed of their reassignment on
Friday afternoon when they re
ceived an e-mail from Todd Ben
son, director of Housing Assign
ment Services, telling them they
would have to move out by today.
The only explanation offered was
"current events internationally."
Junior Lauren Rue, a focus as
sistant in Murray, said her biggest
concern was that the students
being evicted were only told after
the decision was made and that
dorm staff members first heard
about the decision from the evict
ed students, not from University
officials.
"The biggest issue is the lack of
student voice or respect for stu
dent concerns," Rue said. "I don't
think that it was all intentionally
done to exclude student voice, it's
just that somebody dropped the
ball many, many times, and it
could definitely happen again."
The Resident Agreement
signed by all students when they
accept University housing in
cludes a clause allowing the Uni
versity to move students when nec
essary. The clause begins, "The
University reserves the right to re
assign you to another room or res
idence at any time during the term
of this agreement."
According to Rue, none of the
students have started to move out
yet, largely because many initially
thought the e-mail had been a
hoax.
Sophomore Karan Mahajan,
one of the students being reas
signed, denounced the Universi
ty's actions.
"As a student, I understand the
implications of a major health risk
such as SARS and am willing to
back up all efforts to contain it,"
Mahajan said. "However, the way

the administration has handled
the process has been astonishingly
unprofessional and unhelpful."
He added, "Why has Housing
been so underhanded and secre
tive about the procedure? Don't
students — whose housing, acade
mic schedules and state-of-mind
are going to be seriously affect
ed — have the right to be in
formed of such an important deci
sion?"
When asked about student con
cerns that they were not adequate
ly consulted and informed in this
process, Benson said, "We did re
spond to all students by Monday
morning at the latest. I certainly
apologize to anyone who felt that
we didn't respond in a timely man
ner — our goal is to be as respon
sive as we possibly can be."
Benson added that Housing
will also make staff available on re
quest to assist in the move, will pay
the cost of reconnecting phones
and cable and will consider on a
"case-by-case basis" whether or not
to give reassigned students anoth
er preferred year in the Draw.
After the meeting, Camarillo ac
knowledged that not everyone
had been satisfied by the discus
sion.
"We can't always address every
one's concerns in a meeting like
this," Camarillo said. "It's good to
just have a place for students to ex
press their opinion."
She added that students
weren't given more information in
Friday's e-mail because, "I don't
think we had any other informa
tion that we could have given
them. What we knew was pretty
vague."
Camarillo said that not all stu
dents will be out of the cottages
today because some of them have
yet to receive their new housing as
signments.
Housing Assignment Services is evicting nine students
from their cottages at Murray and Yost to create space which
may be needed in the future to house community members
displaying pre-SARS symptoms. Jane Camarillo, director of
Residential Education, and Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Student Health Center, met with students from the two dorms
last night to explain the University's decision.
"In the context of world events, including the SARS situa
tion, the [University] decided that it was prudent to make the
cottages available for their original purpose, which is for stu
dents and others with short-term on-campus housing needs,

including isolation for infectious
diseases such as SARS," Friedman
said.
SARS, or Severe Acute Respira
tory Syndrome, is an illness with
symptoms including a fever and
dry cough that is spread primarily
through air droplets, such as those
from a cough or sneeze. Nine cases
of SARS have reported in Santa
Clara County, which Friedman
said was"a larger number than
most everywhere else."
According to Friedman, the de
cision was made last week by a
group of representatives from
many Stanford offices, including
Housing, Residential Education,
the Dean of Students, Student Af
fairs and Vaden.
He added there no reported
cases of SARS on campus and that
students in surrounding dorms
will not be at any risk.
"It is a precautionary measure,"
Friedman said. "Vaden continues
active surveillance for students
who have the travel or exposure
history and symptoms suggestive
of SARS."
The tone of the meeting be
tween students and administra
tors, which was closed to The
Daily, seemed to be set by a mes
sage written on the dry-erase
board in Murray: "Emergency
House Meeting to support our
EVICTED cottage residents."
Following the two-hour meet
ing, students left the Murray din
ing area talking angrily amongst
themselves. Many of them claimed
that Friedman and Camarillo had
not adequately addressed all of
their concerns.
"Basically, we asked them a lot
of questions, but they never direct
ly answered us," said sophomore
Seyi Akanni, a Murray resident.
Some said that they sympa
thized with the University's posi
tion, but still believed that adminis

trators had acted inappropriately.
"This is the right thing to do
from a public health standpoint,
but they've gone about it really
poorly and with extremely bad
timing," said sophomore Chris
Lin.
