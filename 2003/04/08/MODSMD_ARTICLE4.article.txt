# ASSU hopefuls debate at CoHo
## Executive slates address ASSU's role, student space in rowdy public forum 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
This year's ASSU presidential debate, between the
slate of junior Nadiya Figueroa and sophomore Joey
Natoli and the slate of juniors Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman, was unlike any seen in recent
years. The debate, which took place at the CoHo and
also on the KZSU airwaves, featured a combination of

man / Stockman slate. They were armed with signs
which they held up whenever key buzzwords were
mentioned, including "transparency," "empower
ment," "diversity" or "student space."
Many of the questions focused around issues of stu
dent space and relationships between the ASSU, stu
dents and administrators. In response to one ques

branch on campus, Stockman emphasized its place
with students.
"I think each person in this room can probably re
member some instance when the executive officer of
the ASSU has personally affected their lives, has come
out and touched them one-on-one," Stockman said.
"I think whether it's saving children from burning or
phanages or changing how one dollar of your
$10,000 tuition is spent, 1 think they're the most im
portant part of our education." Natoli responded
