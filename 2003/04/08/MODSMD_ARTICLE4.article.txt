# ASSU hopefuls debate at CoHo
## Executive slates address ASSU's role, student space in rowdy public forum 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
This year's ASSU presidential debate, between the
slate of junior Nadiya Figueroa and sophomore Joey
Natoli and the slate of juniors Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman, was unlike any seen in recent
years. The debate, which took place at the CoHo and
also on the KZSU airwaves, featured a combination of
discussion over pertinent student issues and humor
ous antics by the candidates, particularly Stockman.
Former ASSU President Matt Brewer, a senior,
moderated the debate last night.
The format of the debate consisted of a set of ques
tions from the moderator for each slate, with slates al
ternating who would answer first. Each group had 90
seconds to answer the question and 30 seconds to
issue a rebuttal after the other slate's 90 second an
swer. After that, the slates answered audience-sub

mitted questions for varying amounts of time.
Stanford Chaparral members made up approxi
mately half of the audience, supporting the Yelder
man / Stockman slate. They were armed with signs
which they held up whenever key buzzwords were
mentioned, including "transparency," "empower
ment," "diversity" or "student space."
Many of the questions focused around issues of stu
dent space and relationships between the ASSU, stu
dents and administrators. In response to one ques
tion concerning the role of the ASSU executive
branch on campus, Stockman emphasized its place
with students.
"I think each person in this room can probably re
member some instance when the executive officer of
the ASSU has personally affected their lives, has come
out and touched them one-on-one," Stockman said.
"I think whether it's saving children from burning or
phanages or changing how one dollar of your
$10,000 tuition is spent, 1 think they're the most im
portant part of our education." Natoli responded
that the major role is to "bring
more people into the ASSU," to
which Stockman replied "You'd
let them [the children] burn,
man?"
The next question involved the
Dean of Students Office and what
the candidates would like to
change about it.
Figueroa highlighted efficiency
and innovation.
"I think we need online regis
tration [for student groups], as
having to constantly be in touch
with the [Office of Student Activi
ties] can be a pain," she said. "Also,
there could be more innovative
student life ideas, like some schools
have buses that run to clubs in
nearby towns."
Stockman emphasized the qual
ities needed in a new dean of stu

dents, who will replace former
Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"I would say getting rid of Dean
Wais was a huge step in improving
Stanford University, but I think it's
important to note that you can't
just cut oft the hydra's head, it'll
grow back," he said. "I would per
sonally like to oversee the hiring of
a new dean. First thing, the new
dean would have to have a soul."
Then someone from the crowd
tossed Stockman, who was admit
tedly drunk throughout the de
bate, a large stuffed penis to illus
trate his points.
"He's [the new dean of stu
dents] going to have to be firm
with the student body but also be
flexible, he'll have to have a good
head on his shoulders, and he'll
have to have serious cajones," he
said.
Another question focused on
the $250,000 that were in the spe
cial buffer fund in the ASSU and
how that should be spent.

Figueroa did not cite concrete
ideas, but noted that it should
"benefit all students on campus."
Yelderman suggested using it to
start building a new student union,
as "whenever the money runs out
at least we'll have part of one."
As tar as University administra
tors, Natoli cited the need fora
"careful balance between still
keeping respect while being con
structive" and "keeping open the
communication lines." Yelderman
cited the need "to keep them on a
short leash," and noted that "there
are a lot of really high-level Uni
versity officials who are pulling for
me in this election."
Stockman in particular said he
had much in common with admin
istrators.
"They once had high hopes of
becoming something important
and significant in society, and their
aspirations were crushed," he said.
"My aspirations were also crushed,
ironically by them. If elected, I vow

to really stop trying to sleep with
their wives."
Both slates emphasized ap
proachability and the need for stu
dent space.
As the debate closed, both slates
thanked their opponents.
"For those who weren't here,
the Chappie were very, very funny
tonight," Figueroa said, referring
to Yelderman and Stockman.
Yelderman suggested that
Figueroa and Natoli were actually
the Chappie slate.
"I'd like to thank our oppo
nents, I think the (Chappie was sur
prisingly serious this year," he
said. "I think they have some very
innovative ideas."
In response to the Chaparral's
antics and the somewhat unortho
dox debate, sophomore Sara Ines
Calderon, who is both a current
ASSU senator and a member of the
Chappie, said, "I just think it was
good clean fun," she said. "That's
what the elections should be."

the Chappie slate.
"I'd like to thank our oppo
nents, I think the (Chappie was sur
prisingly serious this year," he
said. "I think they have some very
innovative ideas."
In response to the Chaparral's
antics and the somewhat unortho
dox debate, sophomore Sara Ines
Calderon, who is both a current
ASSU senator and a member of the
Chappie, said, "I just think it was
good clean fun," she said. "That's
what the elections should be."
This year's ASSU presidential debate, between the
slate of junior Nadiya Figueroa and sophomore Joey
Natoli and the slate of juniors Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman, was unlike any seen in recent
years. The debate, which took place at the CoHo and
also on the KZSU airwaves, featured a combination of
discussion over pertinent student issues and humor
ous antics by the candidates, particularly Stockman.
Former ASSU President Matt Brewer, a senior,
moderated the debate last night.
The format of the debate consisted of a set of ques
tions from the moderator for each slate, with slates al
ternating who would answer first. Each group had 90
seconds to answer the question and 30 seconds to
issue a rebuttal after the other slate's 90 second an
swer. After that, the slates answered audience-sub

mitted questions for varying amounts of time.
Stanford Chaparral members made up approxi
mately half of the audience, supporting the Yelder
man / Stockman slate. They were armed with signs
which they held up whenever key buzzwords were
mentioned, including "transparency," "empower
ment," "diversity" or "student space."
Many of the questions focused around issues of stu
dent space and relationships between the ASSU, stu
dents and administrators. In response to one ques
tion concerning the role of the ASSU executive
branch on campus, Stockman emphasized its place
with students.
"I think each person in this room can probably re
member some instance when the executive officer of
the ASSU has personally affected their lives, has come
out and touched them one-on-one," Stockman said.
"I think whether it's saving children from burning or
phanages or changing how one dollar of your
$10,000 tuition is spent, 1 think they're the most im
portant part of our education." Natoli responded
that the major role is to "bring
more people into the ASSU," to
which Stockman replied "You'd
let them [the children] burn,
man?"
The next question involved the
Dean of Students Office and what
the candidates would like to
change about it.
Figueroa highlighted efficiency
and innovation.
"I think we need online regis
tration [for student groups], as
having to constantly be in touch
with the [Office of Student Activi
ties] can be a pain," she said. "Also,
there could be more innovative
student life ideas, like some schools
have buses that run to clubs in
nearby towns."
Stockman emphasized the qual
ities needed in a new dean of stu

dents, who will replace former
Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"I would say getting rid of Dean
Wais was a huge step in improving
Stanford University, but I think it's
important to note that you can't
just cut oft the hydra's head, it'll
grow back," he said. "I would per
sonally like to oversee the hiring of
a new dean. First thing, the new
dean would have to have a soul."
Then someone from the crowd
tossed Stockman, who was admit
tedly drunk throughout the de
bate, a large stuffed penis to illus
trate his points.
"He's [the new dean of stu
dents] going to have to be firm
with the student body but also be
flexible, he'll have to have a good
head on his shoulders, and he'll
have to have serious cajones," he
said.
Another question focused on
the $250,000 that were in the spe
cial buffer fund in the ASSU and
how that should be spent.

Figueroa did not cite concrete
ideas, but noted that it should
"benefit all students on campus."
Yelderman suggested using it to
start building a new student union,
as "whenever the money runs out
at least we'll have part of one."
As tar as University administra
tors, Natoli cited the need fora
"careful balance between still
keeping respect while being con
structive" and "keeping open the
communication lines." Yelderman
cited the need "to keep them on a
short leash," and noted that "there
are a lot of really high-level Uni
versity officials who are pulling for
me in this election."
Stockman in particular said he
had much in common with admin
istrators.
"They once had high hopes of
becoming something important
and significant in society, and their
aspirations were crushed," he said.
"My aspirations were also crushed,
ironically by them. If elected, I vow

to really stop trying to sleep with
their wives."
Both slates emphasized ap
proachability and the need for stu
dent space.
As the debate closed, both slates
thanked their opponents.
"For those who weren't here,
the Chappie were very, very funny
tonight," Figueroa said, referring
to Yelderman and Stockman.
Yelderman suggested that
Figueroa and Natoli were actually
the Chappie slate.
"I'd like to thank our oppo
nents, I think the (Chappie was sur
prisingly serious this year," he
said. "I think they have some very
innovative ideas."
In response to the Chaparral's
antics and the somewhat unortho
dox debate, sophomore Sara Ines
Calderon, who is both a current
ASSU senator and a member of the
Chappie, said, "I just think it was
good clean fun," she said. "That's
what the elections should be."
