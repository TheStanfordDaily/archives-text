### ALI ALEMOZAFAR EDITORIAL STAFF 
At 12:01 a.m. this Wednesday, ballot.stanford.edu
will open to accept voting by undergraduate and grad
uate students for special fees and executive, class and
senatorial positions. The process will end on Thursday
at 11:59 p.m. The process of voting is largely un
changed from past years.
Undergraduates can vote for up to 15 undergradu
ate senators, though it is possible to vote for as few as
only one. Graduate students will vote for representa
tives to the Graduate Student Council and for joint spe
cial-fee groups.
The Internet server will ask fora voter's current aca
demic year so that they vote on the proper class slates.
A ranking system is used by the voting software to
create an automatic runoff between competing execu
tive and class candidates.
Two slates are competing for the ASSU executive
this year. Voters will rank each of the slates as eit her a
first or second choice.
In instant runoff voting, if no ballot wins 50 percent
of the first-place votes, the one with the fewest first
place votes will be eliminated. A computer program will
then recount the ballots that marked the eliminated
slate as first, counting the second-place votes cast on
those ballots.
If a slate still does not have 50 percent of the first
place votes, the ballot with the next-fewest votes is elim
inated and the prt)cess is repeated. This is the third year
the ASSU has used instant runoff voting.
A runoff is necessary since ASSU elect ion guidelines
require that a slate must receive a majority of the votes
to win.
The outcome of the special fees ballot will determine
which groups will be allocated special fees by the ASSU.
