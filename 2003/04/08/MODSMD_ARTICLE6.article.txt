# Students abroad sense anti-U.S. sentiment

With the onset of war in Iraq,
the State Department lias issued a
worldwide caution to American
travelers abroad warning of "an
increased potential for anti-Amer
ican violence, including terrorist
actions against U.S. citizens."
However, while students who
were abroad over spring break re
ported that anti-American senti
ment was prevalent, they said they
did not feel unwelcome and that
anger was expressed not at U.S.
citizens, but at U.S. policy.
Senior Claudio Storelli spent his
spring break at home in Milan, Italy
and commented, "There is a lot of
anti-American sentiment, especial
ly among young people." Storelli
thought that Italy might be espe
cially vocal due to the strong influ
ence of the communist party and
the popularity of leftist politics
among young people.
Overall, Storelli suggested that
"negative feelings aren't against
people but against capitalism and
pushy American policy." He added,
"People are treating Americans the
same as they did before — there is
just more anger being shown
against the symbols, like McDon
ald's."
However, Storelli said that he
would not have been comfortable
being openly pro-American. Wear
ing a T-shirt with an American flag,

for example, would attract negative
attention and could in fact be dan
gerous. However, Storelli added
with a shrug, "the same thing could
happen if you went to a soccer
game wearing the wrong jersey."
Another senior, Frances Brooks,
visited Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia. According to Brooks,
"Anti-American sentiment was far
stronger there than in the U.S.
There were many more protesters,
police were everywhere, and some
one had spray painted 'NO WAR'
on the side of the Sydney Opera
House."
In addition, Brooks mentioned
that there was some concern that
the U.S. consulate would be target
ed and she herself had seen SWAT
teams patrolling the area.
However, Brooks said that
going through customs had not
been a problem and people were
"very friendly."
"There definitely is a lot of anti
war sentiment and frustration, but
people are not mad at Ameri
cans — they are mad at Bush antl
generally I felt like most people
were aware of the difference," she
said.
On the other side of the globe,
Brooks' parents, who own a home
in Paris one block away from the va
cated Iraqi embassy, had received
several death threats. Brooks said
that her parents generally did not
