# Students abroad sense anti-U.S. sentiment
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the onset of war in Iraq,
the State Department lias issued a
worldwide caution to American
travelers abroad warning of "an
increased potential for anti-Amer
ican violence, including terrorist
actions against U.S. citizens."
However, while students who
were abroad over spring break re
ported that anti-American senti
ment was prevalent, they said they
did not feel unwelcome and that
anger was expressed not at U.S.
citizens, but at U.S. policy.
Senior Claudio Storelli spent his
spring break at home in Milan, Italy
and commented, "There is a lot of
anti-American sentiment, especial
ly among young people." Storelli
thought that Italy might be espe
cially vocal due to the strong influ
ence of the communist party and
the popularity of leftist politics
among young people.
Overall, Storelli suggested that
"negative feelings aren't against
people but against capitalism and
pushy American policy." He added,
"People are treating Americans the
same as they did before — there is
just more anger being shown
against the symbols, like McDon
ald's."
However, Storelli said that he
would not have been comfortable
being openly pro-American. Wear
ing a T-shirt with an American flag,

for example, would attract negative
attention and could in fact be dan
gerous. However, Storelli added
with a shrug, "the same thing could
happen if you went to a soccer
game wearing the wrong jersey."
Another senior, Frances Brooks,
visited Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia. According to Brooks,
"Anti-American sentiment was far
stronger there than in the U.S.
There were many more protesters,
police were everywhere, and some
one had spray painted 'NO WAR'
on the side of the Sydney Opera
House."
In addition, Brooks mentioned
that there was some concern that
the U.S. consulate would be target
ed and she herself had seen SWAT
teams patrolling the area.
However, Brooks said that
going through customs had not
been a problem and people were
"very friendly."
"There definitely is a lot of anti
war sentiment and frustration, but
people are not mad at Ameri
cans — they are mad at Bush antl
generally I felt like most people
were aware of the difference," she
said.
On the other side of the globe,
Brooks' parents, who own a home
in Paris one block away from the va
cated Iraqi embassy, had received
several death threats. Brooks said
that her parents generally did not
feel unsafe but pointed out they are
both very vocally against the war.
For this reason, Brooks felt that
they might not attract the negative
reactions that an American who
was supportive of the war might.
Sophomore Jess Soze just re
turned from a six-month stay in
France and described the senti
ment there as "definitely very
much the opposite from here."
"I wouldn't say it is so much an ti-

Americanism as it is anti-Bushism,
which is kind of funny seeing as
here the dominating attitude is
anti-France," she said.
Canadian resident Sagar Chan
daria, originally from Kenya, went
home to visit his family in Canada
during the break. Chandaria, a ju
nior, commented that most people
he spoke with "think America is
doing the right thing the wrong
way."
Chandaria mentioned that a
cousin now living in Kenya said
that there was a strong sense that
America had "double standards"
and that similar feelings were being

voiced in Canada.
Chandaria commented that
both he and other Canadian
friends felt that, in general, being
Canadian usually resulted in better
treatment when traveling abroad.
A student in the Graduate
School of Business, Ji Jeon, had
friends who visited Vietnam dur
ing the past vacation. Jeon had not
heard them mention having any
problems or anxiety.
"I think that their general sense
was that the people there [in Viet
nam] didn't agree with U.S. policy
but were not taking issue with indi
vidual Americans," he said.
