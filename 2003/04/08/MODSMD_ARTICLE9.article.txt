Yesterday's editorial, "Special con
siderations," included the wrong
date for this week's ASSU election.
The Office of Student Activities
Web site incorrectly lists the date of
the election as Monday and Tues
day, and neither the ASSU Web
site nor the elections Web site has
any obvious mention of the date of
the election. This year's elections
commission has set the date of the

election for Wednesday and
Thursday of this week.
A photo in yesterday's issue of The
Daily was mislabeled and placed
with the wrong story. The photo in
"Tech advocates warn of corpo
rate Web control," indicated that
the picture was about the confer
ence, when the picture was really
taken at a conference that took
place at the Business School dur
ing the same day and time.
