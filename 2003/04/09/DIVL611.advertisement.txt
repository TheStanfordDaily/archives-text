Sexlife
by A. A. Clifford, & aka Gary Hardwick
Wednesday, April 9, 2003
7pm • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Imagine a world where there is no
crime, no poverty, no polution, no
cancer, no A.I.D.S. the city streets are
clean. Everyone is intellectual and
technology has advanced so far that
cars float above the street. If you gain
weight the doctor takes it off in a few
minutes and there is no painduring
child birth. Imagine this in New York
city - now imagine this, New York City
2268 A.D. now called Fist City where
CMB a disease which kills unless you
have sex five times a day. A city
where the local clubs serve you
antidepressants in your drink because
in all this beauty the CMB virus has
killed all emotions and the ability to
feel - there is no pleasure during sex.
You either " get fixed" or die!.
Everyone had learned about the old
New York, the crime and the erotic
nature of sex, they have learned that
at one time people knew the mean
ing of love and the magic of making
love, but no one in this new world will
ever know it, or so they thought until
Joe who has always had hope of a
cure and hope of being able to feel
emotions meets Vella and their " fix"
encounter sparks erotic passion which
leads them on a dangerous adventure
to be together. They run for their lives
trying to escape the city but they
can't. They hold all the answers, the
rest of the world needs to know why
and how they feel love, passion and
jealousy. Joe and Vella's lives change
forever until they find a cure or until
the rest of the world feels once again.
