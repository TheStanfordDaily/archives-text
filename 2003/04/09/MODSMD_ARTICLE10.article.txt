# ASSU to bring back guest professorship
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
An initiative to revive the Guest Profes
sorship Board and a demonstration of the
elections Web site were the highlights of
last night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting.
The GPB bill specifically endorsed the pro
posal, brought by Senator Howie Chiou, a
sophomore, to create a new Guest Professor
ship Board. The GPB ran from 1967 to 1984,
when it dissolved due to internal concerns.
During that time period, it brought profes
sors, selected by students, from a variety of
sources to Stanford fora quarter to teach
classes for credit.
The new proposal would create a dedicat
ed Guest Professorship Board that would be
appointed by the ASSU Nominations Com
mission. Students would organize an applica
tion and write essays in order to nominate a
professor, then a faculty sponsor would be
found to develop syllabi and work with the
guest professor. Finally, a sponsoring depart
ment would provide resources and accredit
courses.

" They [the guest professors] wouldn't have
any other external involvements so their focus
would only be on teaching," Chiou said.
" They would teach one five-unit lecture and
one three-unit seminar, taken for credit. This
would open up opportunities for mentorship,
lectures, talks, events and conferences and, of
course, collaboration between faculty and stu
dents."
The endorsement passed unanimously by
a vote of 11 in favor, zero opposed, and one
abstaining.
Senator Hiro Iwonaga, a senior, demon
strated the new elections Web site. The hand
book will be at elections.stanford.edu, while
the voting site will be at ballot.stanford.edu.
"Our first priority [with the site] was secu
rity," Iwonaga said. "We didn't want any
problems."
There will be two databases working with
the site, one to store every vote itself, while the
other stores the II) of and the ballot on which
the student voted. The special-fee groups will
be listed in alphabetical order, while the order
of the senators and class slates will be ran
domized.
Also, Elections Commissioner Eleanor

Williams, a junior, brought up the issue of re
sponding to a recent Daily editorial.
"Basically, they [the Daily] wrote an edito
rial yesterday that there are too many spe
cial-fee groups on the ballot and that is
caused by the ASSU not placing a high pri
ority on these things," Williams said. "We
have been thinking about how to respond to
this because we think that it presents the
ASSU in a light that will detract students
from voting."
Senator Josh Shipp, a sophomore, suggest
ed that a response is not needed.
"The Daily is entitled to its opinion, and it
did bring up issues that we ourselves grappled
with as well," Shipp said. "I felt that it was not
that damaging. I don't see it as something we
necessarily need to respond to."
Iwonaga suggested that the Senate spend
next week's meeting discussing it's role in spe
cial fees.
"I don't necessarily think that there needs
to be a response to this particular article, but
we should make some decision about what the
Senate should do when presenting these [spe
cial-fee groups] to the students for voting,"
Iwonaga said.
