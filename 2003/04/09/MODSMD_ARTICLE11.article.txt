# Russia conference begins

### EVAN BERGER 
The fourth-annual U.S.-Russia
Student Leadership Conference,
enabling 26 Russian and American
student activists to discuss Russian-
American relations, began this Sat
urday at Stanford.
Sophomore Jessica Williams,
the conference's chair, stressed that
the conference has two purposes:
to encourage greater understand
ing of U.S.-Russian policy and to
encourage participants to effective
ly serve their communities.
The conference features panels
on community service and the con
cept of democracy, speeches by
Stanford professors on the state of
Russia and a real-time crisis simula
tion where participants split up
and play the role of the U.S. or
Russian government.
Communication, which was em
phasized by speakers and echoed
by participants, is the focus of the
summit.
"There's a lot of miscommunica
tion [between Russian and Ameri
can students] — they have differ
ent news sources and different cul
tures," Williams said. She contin
ued, "A lot of current
issues... heightened the sense of
maintaining communication be
tween the two countries."
Associate Political Science Prof.
Michael McFaul, who spoke on Sat
urday, told students that, on a na
tional level, "the number one
enemy of U.S.-Russian relations is
ignorance."
He added that the summit's
greatest purpose was to make the
next generation of Russian and
American leaders communicate
with one another.
Vitaly Kosmoun, a student from
Moscow, agreed with McFaul. A
two-time participant, he said that

the main benefit of the conference
has been to talk with American
peers, as he has few opportunities
in Russia to interact with those of
different cultures.
This year's conference has been
highly shaped by the war in Iraq.
In years past, the featured simula
tions have been political negotia
tions between the two countries.
This year, simulation designer Neil
Achtman, a senior, created a crisis
simulation to reflect the more fren
zied 112 oreign relations climate of the
past few years.
In addition, the war has also
been a frequent topic of conversa
tion among students. One Russian
student said, "No friend of mine at
home supports the war — and this
is no exaggeration."
The rapid fluctuations in the
U.S.-Russian relationship were also
a recurrent subject of discussion.
David Martin, a participant
from Brigham Young University,
regretted that Russia and the Unit
ed States "came closer together for
a time, but now have come apart."
Martin added, "If this war ends
soon, Americans can improve rela
tions by letting other nations help
reconstruct Iraq." He said that
since Sept. 11, the common threat
of terrorism could facilitate
stronger relations between the
countries.
But some Russian participants
questioned what they saw as the
United States' paternalistic attitude
and imperialist intentions. At a
nighttime discussion, some Russ
ian students argued that Ameri
cans tried to impose a rigid, self
serving version of democracy on
Russia.
The summit, which will last
through April 11, is sponsored by
the student-run Democratic
Partners.
