## U.S. advances in Baghdad 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)—U.S. forces
battled the tattered remnants of Iraq's
army for control of downtown Baghdad
on Tuesday, crushing a counterattack and
seizing a military airport. Saddam Hus
sein's fate was unknown after an attempt
to kill him from the air.
Inside the capital to stay, some Army
units routed Iraqi fighters from a Repub
lican Guard headquarters. Others discov
ered a 12-room complex inside a cave,
complete with white marble floors, 10-foot
ceilings and fluorescent lighting.
Marines battled snipers as they fought
deeper into the capital from the east. They
seized the Rasheed Airport and captured
enough ammunition for an estimated
3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took a
prison where they found U.S. Army uni
forms and chemical weapons suits possibly
belonging to American POWs.
On the city's northern sicle, Army
forces set a Republican Guard barracks
ablaze. Warplanes flew their bombing
runs unchallenged, and smoke poured
out of the Ministry of Planning building in
the city's center.
"We are continuing to maintain our
ability to conduct operations around and
in Baghdad, and remove them from
regime control" said Capt. Frank Thorp, a
spokesman at U.S. Central Command.
State-run Iraqi television was knocked
off the air, depriving the regime of a key
source of influence over a population
thought increasingly eager to help the
forces of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Four days after Americans first pene
trated the Baghdad outskirts, the city
showed the effects of the war. Civilians
roamed the streets with Kalashnikov rifles
in hand, uncollected garbage piled up,
and there were long lines at the reduced
number of gasoline stations still open.
The toll on civilians from four days of

urban combat was unknown. But the
World Health Organization said Bagh
dad's hospitals were running out of sup
plies to treat the burns, shrapnel wounds
and spinal injuries caused by the fighting.
There were military losses for the
Americans amid the gains.
An A-10 "Warthog" warplane was shot
down near Baghdad early in the day, be
lieved to be the first fixed-wing aircraft
downed by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile
since the war began. U.S. Central Com
mand said the pilot ejected safely, was re
covered by ground forces and was in good
condition.
A U.S. F-15Ejet fighter and its two-man
crew also have been missing since Sunday,
the military announced Tuesday. It was
not known what happened to the plane.
Outside the capital, U.S. jets bombed
Iraqi positions near the northern city of
Kirkuk, which remained under control of
the regime. In the southeastern city of
Amarah, Marines seized the airport and
an ammunition dump without resistance.
In Basra, a southern city of 1.3 million
people under British control at last, mili
tary officials appointed a local sheik as a
civilian commander, the first replacement
administration put into place anywhere in
the country.
Postwar government was a key topic for
a summit meeting that brought President
Bush and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to Northern Ireland. Both men
talked of a U.N. role inside Iraq once the
fighting is over, and sought to minimize
splits on who should govern and rebuild
the country.
In the meantime, they trumpeted the
battlefield successes of the American and
British forces, and said Saddam's days
were numbered.
"I don't know whether he survived," a
bombing attack on Monday, Bush said of

the Iraqi leader. "The only thing I know is
that he's losing power."
The site remained in Iraqi hands, al
though Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks said
American troops hoped to get there soon.
At the Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Stanley
McChrystal said eliminating Saddam
would be significant, even if it didn't
cause the immediate end of the resis
tance. "He still controls elements of the
Special Republican Guard and death

squads," he said.
Officials ordered the attack after get
ting intelligence that Saddam was at the fa
cility. Officials said four bunker-busting
bombs were dropped by a single B-1B
bomber, which was diverted in flight from
its original target. McChrystal said only 45
minutes elapsed between the time the in
telligence reached military officials and
when the bombs fell.
"I was never prouder to be in the Air

Force," said Lt. Col. Fred Swan, the bom
bardier aboard the warplane that carried
out the mission.
The precision-guided 2,000-pound
munitions left a smoking crater 60 feet
deep in the upscale al-Mansour section of
western Baghdad. A young woman's sev
ered head and torso and a small boy's
body were pulled from a crater made by
the blasts, so powerful they yanked up or
ange trees from their roots.
