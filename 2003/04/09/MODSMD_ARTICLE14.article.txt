# Californians support war, poll says
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
strong majority of Californians
support the U.S.-led invasion of
Iraq, even in the politically liberal
San Francisco Bay area, according
to a poll released yesterday.
In the first statewide survey
published since the war began, 76
percent of Californians ques
tioned in the Field Poll said they
support the war, putting the state
in line with finding from recent
national polls.
Last September, the Field Insti
tute found 58 percent of respon
dents supported military interven
tion.
That jump apparently helped
buoy Californians' opinion of

President George W. Bush,
whose approval rating sat at 61
percent, reversing a yearlong
downward trend.
The poll of 1,006 Californians
was conducted over six days end
ing Sunday, as the news out of
Iraq improved for American
forces. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
More than 80 percent of
those who were surveyed said
the war is going well. Strong ma
jorities also said they expect the
war could be over within several
months, with fewer than 1,000
U.S. casualties.
Although support for the war

was lower in the Bay Area than the
rest of the state, 63 percent of resi
dents supported the war.
"The stereotype that one
would have of the Bay Area
would be that it is one of the
hotbeds of the anti-war move
ment," said Mark DiCamillo, di
rector of the San Francisco
based poll. "Fora poll to show
strong support of the war
here — that's major news."
Californians' impression of how
well the war is going seemed to
build steam.
Last week, 1 in 3 of those ques
tioned said the war was going
"very well." By the weekend, that
number had risen to 1 in 2.
