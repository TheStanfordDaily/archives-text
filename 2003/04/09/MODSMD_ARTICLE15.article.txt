## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Student votes matter 
### 
For the past generation, voter par
ticipation in the United States lias
been in a slump. Even Stanford
student election turnouts have
suffered as fewer and fewer students
seem to vote each year. Rather than act
ing grateful for elections — celebrating
the opportunity to vote for their student
body executive leaders, senators and
choosing who will receive a special fee —
many students feel apathetic and cyni
cal, even burdened by the process. Busy
schedules filled with classes, assign
ments, social activities, sports and ex
tracurriculars become an excuse to ne
glect this simple affirmation of the
democratic process.
The national elections are influenced
by several factors, such as education level,
socioeconomic status and demographics,
political awareness and motivation —

weather. But every
one here is educated
and the likelihood of
sunshine today and
tomorrow is quite
high.
So why the voter
apathy on the Farm?
After all, as the past
months have shown,
Stanford students
are deeply commit
ted to social and po
litical issues. Nu

groups are devoted

ticipation and community involvement;
this year in particular, students have at
tended and even organized rallies in San
Francisco and on campus in protest of
the war.
Admittedly, the issues at stake between
national and Stanford issues are on com
pletely different levels. The fate of Roe v.
Wade does not lie in the hands of the
next ASSU president, and the construc
tion of a new student union seems hard
ly as glamorous an issue as reconstruct
ing affirmative action. But such a com
parison is unfair for two reasons.
First, these candidates are fellow stu
dents. Almost everyone knows someone
running or someone in a special-fee
group. Additionally, ASSU officers will
affect issues that are relevant to the ev
eryday lives of every student on campus
such as cost-of-living and student space.
The student body elections are the best
opportunity to officially influence the

policies which immediately affect each
and every student.
Second, even if people are not as inter
ested in the executive elections, the other
ASSU elections will directly influence stu
dents in another way: their pocketbooks.
Each year, students vote on whether or
not student groups should receive a spe
cial fee. The outcome of this election will
determine the fate of funding for more
than 60 student groups on campus. It will
also decide whether students will person
ally pay more than $200 in order to sup
port these groups. No other elections af
fect your opportunities and wallet in such
a direct manner.
Realistically, an ASSU vote will not
lower the drinking age on campus, but
neither will a vote in national elections.
Whereas a student is one of almost 300
million Americans, she or he is one of

just 6,000 Stanford
undergraduates or
7,000 graduate stu
dents.
If students have
ever gone to see a
speaker, a lecture or
a concert sponsored
by a student organi
zation or if they've
always pick up the
dozen free condoms
from the Sexual
Health Peer Re
source Center each
year, then they have
benefited from the
multiple student

groups that receive special fees. And if
they support their causes — if they be
lieve that they have benefitted student
life in some way — then it is their re
sponsibility to give the groups some
thing back: a vote.
Moreover, there are many actions
that ASSU senators and executive lead
ers make behind-the-scenes that stu
dents may not hear about. While it is
certainly the responsibility of the ASSU
to improve communication with stu
dents on campus — a significant issue
in this year's campaigns — it is also im
portant that students take the initiative
to become involved in their student as
sociation. One of the valuable ways to
become engaged in student life issues is
to vote.
We only get to be a college students
fora few years of our lives — so take
this opportunity to speak up and vote
in the ASSU elections.
