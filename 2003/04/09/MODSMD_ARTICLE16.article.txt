## Dropping the "S" word 
### 
It is not uncommon to see
Stanford students walk
around campus with shirts or
caps that proclaim "Cal
Sucks" or "Beat Cal." For the most
part, I think school rivalries are a
healthy thing to have. It gives
meaning to our sometimes mun
dane lives - if we can't beat anyone,
at least we should beat Cal, right?
Simply by being the most pres
tigious campus in close proximity
to us, Cal is an obvious target for
Stanford students to express their
rivalry-seeking rage. But what
happens when that rivalry is taken
too far? What happens when that
healthy school competitive spirit
portrayed in sports venues seeps
outside of the athletic arena and
morphs into a form of elitism?
Often times I overhear my fel
low classmates talk disparagingly
about Cal and its students. A few of
us might even think we are better
than the Bears in some way, shape
or form.
I mean, what makes us "better"
than Cal? Are we better because
Stanford ranks higher on the U.S
News & World Report on Col
leges? Are we better because our
acceptance rate is lower? Are we
better because we pay seven times
as much for our education as they
do?
It is interesting to note that for
many of us the shoe could have
easily been on the other foot. Had
we not been accepted to Stanford,
how many of us would have ended
up at Cal (and subsequently would
have taken Stanford to be our
rival)? God knows I would have
been one of those.
For the most part, I don't be
lieve Stanford students are elitist.
There is an acknowledgment that
we are in a position of privilege,
and I think most of us recognize it
when we are around others and

prefer not to re
veal the fact that
we attend Stan
ford. A lot of peo
ple I know feel
uncomfortable
wearing a Stan
ford sweatshirt or
any article of
clothing with the

Stanford logo on it outside of
Stanford and the general vicinity
of Palo Alto.
One evening, I found myself
waiting in line outside of a movie
theater in Santa Clara when a local
college student suddenly shouted
across the crowd. I turned around
and he yelled at me: "How does it
feel to better than everyone else?" I
suddenly felt self-conscious. I

"Embarrassed, I took off
my Stan ford sweatshirt...
it was a far cry from that
day when I found out I got
accepted to Stanford and
wore my sweatshirt
proudly"

looked at down at my Stanford
sweatshirt and realized that this was
something that I would have to put
up with as long as I was associated
with the University. Embarrassed, I
took off my sweatshirt once I
stepped inside die theater. I was a
far cry away from that day when I
found out I got accepted to Stanford
and wore my sweatshirt proudly.
I can name several times where
I (or one of my friends) have been
verbally assaulted for going to

Stanford while walking around
San Francisco and other places in
the Bay Area. (Granted, one in
stance took place during the alco
hol-soaked Castro Halloween
party and the person was wearing
a Cal beanie.)
These events made me pon
der: Should we be ashamed of
going to Stanford? Should we
feel guilty? I don't think so. It
could be that many people have a
perception of "the Stanford col
lege student," mainly that as an
elitist, stuck-up snob. This
couldn't be further from the
truth. But still, this is a more or
less common perception, and we
don't want to be seen as such. So
we choose to conceal where we
go to school. Have you ever said,
I go to school in the Bay Area? Or
in California? Or in the Western
Hemisphere? Ever evading say
ing the "S" word?
At home, I would be called
"Stanford Boy" or "Ivy Dude."
(Apparently a lot people don't re
alize the fact that Stanford is not
an Ivy League school). I tell peo
ple that a lot of us have to put up
with rude remarks because of the
college we attend, but they say that
is a "trade-off 1 ' for what we gain in
return. That may be true, but it
doesn't mean it is right.
While I believe I wouldn't re
ceive the same treatment had I
gone to, say a Cal State or UC
school (even Cal!), I wouldn't
trade the enormous opportunity
I have here at Stanford for any
thing. People may think we are
elitist, but that's fine. We can live
with that. We know — and can
prove — it is not true. I am a
"Stanford Boy," and damn
proud of it.

day when I found out I got
accepted to Stanford and
wore my sweatshirt
proudly"

looked at down at my Stanford
sweatshirt and realized that this was
something that I would have to put
up with as long as I was associated
with the University. Embarrassed, I
took off my sweatshirt once I
stepped inside die theater. I was a
far cry away from that day when I
found out I got accepted to Stanford
and wore my sweatshirt proudly.
I can name several times where
I (or one of my friends) have been
verbally assaulted for going to

Stanford while walking around
San Francisco and other places in
the Bay Area. (Granted, one in
stance took place during the alco
hol-soaked Castro Halloween
party and the person was wearing
a Cal beanie.)
These events made me pon
der: Should we be ashamed of
going to Stanford? Should we
feel guilty? I don't think so. It
could be that many people have a
perception of "the Stanford col
lege student," mainly that as an
elitist, stuck-up snob. This
couldn't be further from the
truth. But still, this is a more or
less common perception, and we
don't want to be seen as such. So
we choose to conceal where we
go to school. Have you ever said,
I go to school in the Bay Area? Or
in California? Or in the Western
Hemisphere? Ever evading say
ing the "S" word?
At home, I would be called
"Stanford Boy" or "Ivy Dude."
(Apparently a lot people don't re
alize the fact that Stanford is not
an Ivy League school). I tell peo
ple that a lot of us have to put up
with rude remarks because of the
college we attend, but they say that
is a "trade-off 1 ' for what we gain in
return. That may be true, but it
doesn't mean it is right.
While I believe I wouldn't re
ceive the same treatment had I
gone to, say a Cal State or UC
school (even Cal!), I wouldn't
trade the enormous opportunity
I have here at Stanford for any
thing. People may think we are
elitist, but that's fine. We can live
with that. We know — and can
prove — it is not true. I am a
"Stanford Boy," and damn
proud of it.

Drop me a line, a word or an "S" at
mosque da @stanfo rd. edu.
