Banner a 'symptom of a larger illness'
Having had to pass daily under the
Figueroa / Natoli banner at Campus and
Mayfield, 1 feel especially compelled to
commend Steve Yelderman and Charlie
Stockman for their letter "Campaign ban
ner a 'gross public eyesore'" (April 7) de
nouncing that indulgence. The banner
may have fallen, but it is only a symptom of
a larger illness affecting campus elections.
I am loath to broach the phrase "cam
paign finance reform" in this small setting,
but rethinking the matter, could today's
ASSU candidates not very well be tomor
row's wholesale purchasers of elections? I
hope that my fellow students send the
message in this week's election that sell
promotion and corporate packaging are
something Stanford neither acclaims nor
rewards. Whatever ample evidence to the
contrary exists, a chance, however hum
ble, to defeat such trends beckons plain
tively.
Of course, a candidate's slick tactics may
well belie noble intentions. However,
when he or she spends personal funds in
erecting inescapable eyesores, one won
ders what lies in store for ASSU monies. As

a counterpoint, Stockman and Yelder
man's methods, like those of Senate candi
date Andy "the Banjo Man" Gavin, reflect
creativity and economy.
I don't know Charlie Stockman or
Steve Yelderman. Chances are, I don't
know what day of the week it is either. But
I do know two things: who I will be voting
for today, and who I will not be voting for.

Banner a sign of hard work; candidates
disappointed in incident involving
its removal
In their letter, Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman wrote about the large
banner Nadiya Figueroa and I had
made and hung between Bob and Grove
Lasuen houses. Our friends worked
over a period of several days to help us
create and hang that banner and it
meant a lot to us that they had given so
much of their time and effort to support
our campaign.
Although the letter implied that our
banner contributed to turning the election
into a "battle of pocketbooks", in reality, it
was relatively cheap to make. We put a lot

of time and manpower — but not a lot of
money — into creating the banner and we
considered it a novel way of getting our
names out to the campus, in addition to
just fliering. While Steve may have consid
ered it a "material atrocity," we were
proud of our banner.
Having invested so much of our time,
energy and creativity into the banner, we
were very distressed to find that it had
been taken down today without our con
sent or even our knowledge. Around 5:30
p.m., a student approached a resident at
the Grove Lasuen house claiming to be
Debbie "from the Elections Commission".
Oddly enough, none of the four members
of the ASSU Elections Commission are
named Debbie. This so-called representa
tive of the Elections Commission cut the
ropes securing the banner to the Grove
Lasuen house, allowing it to fall into the
street and obstruct traffic, causing a poten
tial safety hazard.
One of our most important considera
tions when we were hanging the banner
was to ensure that it posed no danger to
the traffic below it. The person who cut
down the banner clearly did not have the
same qualms since she left it lying in the
street until a passer-by moved it onto the
sidewalk. If this individual had a problem
with the banner, she should have brought

it up with one of us or a member of our
campaign team.
A person taking it upon herself to de
stroy our property — let alone put cars
and bicyclists in danger — not only goes
against the spirit of campaigning at Stan
ford, but also violates the Fundamental
Standard. We sincerely hope that we can
avoid incidents like this for the remainder
of the campaign. We echo the words in the
letter, although written in criticism of the
banner, "We have no idea what has
prompted a student to take an unprece
dented step in all the wrong directions, but
regardless, we condemn it and refuse to
follow."

'Men and women serving in Iraq are not
puppets'
This is in response to the letter "Anti-war
protesters are the real 'troops"' (April 3) in
which Harry Haladjian where supports the
rights of the anti-war protesters. I le should,
as should every American citizen who cher
ishes the protections afforded to us by the

First Amendment.
What's sad, however, is that while the let
ter lauds the everyday citizens who are
"risking arrest to voice their opposition
against the United States government," in
the same breath he sees fit to ridicule the
soldiers currently risking their lives in Iraq.
According to the letter, these men and
women should not be supported, because
they are "blindly following the orders of a
government at fault."
The men and women serving in the
armed forces in Iraq are not puppets. They
are people who have volunteered and
made a commitment to service of our
country. Take the time to speak with a sol
dier and you will see that they serve their
country with pride because they believe in
protect ing the freedoms of each and every
American citizen. They serve their country
so that future generations can enjoy the
freedoms that so many of us take for grant
ed. And in so doing, they make personal
sacrifices that most of us will never even
comprehend. For that, they deserve not
the support of all citizens, but also their re
spect — regardless of your own political af
filiations.
I urge all members of the Stanford com
munity to wholeheartedly reject this letter's
position of not supporting our
troops. At best, the statements
made in the letter reflect an ex
treme level of ignorance regarding
the men and women serving in our
armed forces. At worst, the com

ments verge on elitist rhetoric.

Last week I was watching the

a large map of Iraq was displayed.
A military expert then began to an
alyze the war just like John Mad
den breaks down a football game.
Then to add to my discomfort,
they had a two computer animated
missiles flying over the Middle East
and hitting the "target." This war
on TV has become a news version
of reality TV while boarding on a

'Men and women serving in Iraq are not
puppets'
This is in response to the letter "Anti-war
protesters are the real 'troops"' (April 3) in
which Harry Haladjian where supports the
rights of the anti-war protesters. I le should,
as should every American citizen who cher
ishes the protections afforded to us by the

First Amendment.
What's sad, however, is that while the let
ter lauds the everyday citizens who are
"risking arrest to voice their opposition
against the United States government," in
the same breath he sees fit to ridicule the
soldiers currently risking their lives in Iraq.
According to the letter, these men and
women should not be supported, because
they are "blindly following the orders of a
government at fault."
The men and women serving in the
armed forces in Iraq are not puppets. They
are people who have volunteered and
made a commitment to service of our
country. Take the time to speak with a sol
dier and you will see that they serve their
country with pride because they believe in
protect ing the freedoms of each and every
American citizen. They serve their country
so that future generations can enjoy the
freedoms that so many of us take for grant
ed. And in so doing, they make personal
sacrifices that most of us will never even
comprehend. For that, they deserve not
the support of all citizens, but also their re
spect — regardless of your own political af
filiations.
I urge all members of the Stanford com
munity to wholeheartedly reject this letter's
position of not supporting our
troops. At best, the statements
made in the letter reflect an ex
treme level of ignorance regarding
the men and women serving in our
armed forces. At worst, the com

ments verge on elitist rhetoric.

Student disgusted by TV coverage
or war in Iraq
Last week I was watching the
CNN war on Iraq coverage when

a large map of Iraq was displayed.
A military expert then began to an
alyze the war just like John Mad
den breaks down a football game.
Then to add to my discomfort,
they had a two computer animated
missiles flying over the Middle East
and hitting the "target." This war
on TV has become a news version
of reality TV while boarding on a
video game. Are you tired of the

war related to us play-by-play?
Do you want a more human per
spective of this war? If you do then

Banner a 'symptom of a larger illness'
Having had to pass daily under the
Figueroa / Natoli banner at Campus and
Mayfield, 1 feel especially compelled to
commend Steve Yelderman and Charlie
Stockman for their letter "Campaign ban
ner a 'gross public eyesore'" (April 7) de
nouncing that indulgence. The banner
may have fallen, but it is only a symptom of
a larger illness affecting campus elections.
I am loath to broach the phrase "cam
paign finance reform" in this small setting,
but rethinking the matter, could today's
ASSU candidates not very well be tomor
row's wholesale purchasers of elections? I
hope that my fellow students send the
message in this week's election that sell
promotion and corporate packaging are
something Stanford neither acclaims nor
rewards. Whatever ample evidence to the
contrary exists, a chance, however hum
ble, to defeat such trends beckons plain
tively.
Of course, a candidate's slick tactics may
well belie noble intentions. However,
when he or she spends personal funds in
erecting inescapable eyesores, one won
ders what lies in store for ASSU monies. As

a counterpoint, Stockman and Yelder
man's methods, like those of Senate candi
date Andy "the Banjo Man" Gavin, reflect
creativity and economy.
I don't know Charlie Stockman or
Steve Yelderman. Chances are, I don't
know what day of the week it is either. But
I do know two things: who I will be voting
for today, and who I will not be voting for.

Banner a sign of hard work; candidates
disappointed in incident involving
its removal
In their letter, Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman wrote about the large
banner Nadiya Figueroa and I had
made and hung between Bob and Grove
Lasuen houses. Our friends worked
over a period of several days to help us
create and hang that banner and it
meant a lot to us that they had given so
much of their time and effort to support
our campaign.
Although the letter implied that our
banner contributed to turning the election
into a "battle of pocketbooks", in reality, it
was relatively cheap to make. We put a lot

of time and manpower — but not a lot of
money — into creating the banner and we
considered it a novel way of getting our
names out to the campus, in addition to
just fliering. While Steve may have consid
ered it a "material atrocity," we were
proud of our banner.
Having invested so much of our time,
energy and creativity into the banner, we
were very distressed to find that it had
been taken down today without our con
sent or even our knowledge. Around 5:30
p.m., a student approached a resident at
the Grove Lasuen house claiming to be
Debbie "from the Elections Commission".
Oddly enough, none of the four members
of the ASSU Elections Commission are
named Debbie. This so-called representa
tive of the Elections Commission cut the
ropes securing the banner to the Grove
Lasuen house, allowing it to fall into the
street and obstruct traffic, causing a poten
tial safety hazard.
One of our most important considera
tions when we were hanging the banner
was to ensure that it posed no danger to
the traffic below it. The person who cut
down the banner clearly did not have the
same qualms since she left it lying in the
street until a passer-by moved it onto the
sidewalk. If this individual had a problem
with the banner, she should have brought

it up with one of us or a member of our
campaign team.
A person taking it upon herself to de
stroy our property — let alone put cars
and bicyclists in danger — not only goes
against the spirit of campaigning at Stan
ford, but also violates the Fundamental
Standard. We sincerely hope that we can
avoid incidents like this for the remainder
of the campaign. We echo the words in the
letter, although written in criticism of the
banner, "We have no idea what has
prompted a student to take an unprece
dented step in all the wrong directions, but
regardless, we condemn it and refuse to
follow."
