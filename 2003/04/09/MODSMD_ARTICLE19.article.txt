## CAMPUS VIEWPOINT Protesters will continue to promote constructive intervention 
### IRENE YEH GUEST COLUMNIST 
On Monday morning, I returned
from an anti-war protest at the American
President Lines port in Oakland (where
U.S. military equipment is shipped over
seas) to learn from Monday columnists
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Madj
lessi that my "continued opposition to
the war completely ignores reality," as
stated in their column, "See you at the
crossroads" (April 7).
Did Martin Luther King Jr. ignore re
ality when he challenged segregation and
racism? Did Susan B. Anthony and Eliza
beth Cady Stanton ignore reality when
they fought for women's rights? This is not
to confuse civil rights issues with the war
against Iraq, but rather to make one thing
clear: The movement against the war does
not "ignore" reality — it seeks to chal
lenge the status quo fora better world.
Before I could respond to Kendall
and Madjlessi's arguments, their person
al jabs stopped me: "Radical anti-war ac
tivists," "extreme behavior," "inane na
ture of the protesters." All of these really
shook me. Clearly, inanity is an inherited
trait among people who contest social
and political policies.
I would say that what is "inane" is our
president's utter disregard for interna
tional diplomacy or world opinion. What
is "extreme" is the killing of innocent peo

ple, the destruction of homes and infras
tructure and the infliction of suffering
upon many. If it's "radical" for protesters
to promote peace and social justice and
bring democracy to the streets, then we all
must be crazy.
The columnists state that their col
umn's "true purpose" is "debunking the
arguments of protesters." Great. Let's
talk about the real issues.
Why Iraq? Their main argument
states that the United States has an obli
gation to overturn cruel dictators and
the U.S.'s intervention will result in a
better life for the Iraqi people. This is
based upon three assumptions. First of
all, Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has
committed humanitarian atrocities. Sec
ond, states have a duty to intervene in
another state when that government fails
to protect certain fundamental human
rights of its people, and finally, war is the
best form of intervention to guarantee
security and peace for the Iraqis.
First, we cannot deny that Hussein is a
brutal dictator. A surprising number of
people misunderstand this: protesting
the war most certainly does not mean
supporting Hussein. Second, the U.S.'s
right to intervene may be debatable, but
even if intervention in this case was clear
ly justified, the main issue centers
around how intervention should be im
plemented.
Kendall and Madjlessi choose the use

of force: "It would be nice to topple every
oppressive regime" and rebuild new and
improved societies for everyone.
The U.S. government has not been
and is not out there to protect and liber
ate all peoples from oppressive regimes.
Throughout the Cold War, our govern
ment armed and supported brutal dicta
torships from El Salvador and Nicaragua
to Iran and Iraq. And now, will we re
build Iraq in the same way that we left
the Afghan people to rebuild their own
nation? The point is, in the past, many of
our interventions have increased the tur
moil and suffering of countless peoples
across the world.
War is not the solution. In opposing
the war, protesters demand that our gov
ernment seek more peaceful and con
structive forms of intervention to ad
dress human rights concerns. The Iraqi
people, better than anyone else, have a
right to fight against Hussein's injustices.
The columnists' unsubstantiated claim
that "protesters would have us believe
that the lack of a popular uprising
against Hussein is evidence that the
Iraqis do not hate him" is irresponsible
and misleading, and it misses the point
entirely.
War is not the solution because at this
very moment, and every moment that
passes, it continues to inflict immeasur
able costs on the lives and livelihoods of
the very people we presume to liberate.

War is not the solution because in the af
termath of our destruction, we cannot
guarantee security, peace or sustainable
economic development for the Iraqi
people.
Kendall and Madjlessi introduce a sec
ond angle: That the war is necessary for
U.S. strategic interests. Security sounds
like a more promising reason than pure
humanitarian goodwill. Our government
and media tell us that Iraq is a threat be
cause: We suspect it possesses weapons of
mass destruction, and we suspect it has
connections to al-Qaida.
Rather than discussing the validity of
these suspicions, the two columnists sim
ply allude to security when citing North
Korea as "a far greater threat" than Iraq.
Then they claim that attacking North
Korea "would unleash a humanitarian
disaster," as if our use of force against Iraq
has not already done so. They imply that
the United States chose to attack Iraq sim
ply because it "has limited resources and
can only devote them to so many causes."
At this point, we need to examine the
United States' strategic interests in Iraq:
political and economic interests.
Kendall and Madjlessi worry that a
"premature pullout" would "leave a stain
on our diplomatic record." What has
harmed our diplomatic record is our re
nunciation of almost every diplomatic
agreement we have ever made in the past,
from the Kyoto Protocol to the most re-

tent repudiation of the United Nations'
role in mediating international conflicts.
What the columnists are actually saying is
that stopping the war would damage the
image of the resolve of the United States,
as well as its power and ability to follow
through with its threats — hardly the
same things as international diplomacy
and cooperation.
Let's return to common ground,
where we share common convictions in
respecting "the inalienable rights of life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness" for
all people. We are against the war because
we see these rights are being gagged, mu
tilated, shot, shocked, devastated, annihi
lated — and after the dust has settled —
the remnants and shards left to echo
across a ghost of a people.
Attacking ideas is one thing, but at
tacking the personal "nature" of
protesters is not only meaningless but
counterproductive. We are against this
war, because we are for the American
people and the Iraqi people. We are for
peace, we are for justice and we are for
our common humanity.

image of the resolve of the United States,
as well as its power and ability to follow
through with its threats — hardly the
same things as international diplomacy
and cooperation.
Let's return to common ground,
where we share common convictions in
respecting "the inalienable rights of life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness" for
all people. We are against the war because
we see these rights are being gagged, mu
tilated, shot, shocked, devastated, annihi
lated — and after the dust has settled —
the remnants and shards left to echo
across a ghost of a people.
Attacking ideas is one thing, but at
tacking the personal "nature" of
protesters is not only meaningless but
counterproductive. We are against this
war, because we are for the American
people and the Iraqi people. We are for
peace, we are for justice and we are for
our common humanity.

On Monday morning, I returned
from an anti-war protest at the American
President Lines port in Oakland (where
U.S. military equipment is shipped over
seas) to learn from Monday columnists
Alexander Kendall and Elizabeth Madj
lessi that my "continued opposition to
the war completely ignores reality," as
stated in their column, "See you at the
crossroads" (April 7).
Did Martin Luther King Jr. ignore re
ality when he challenged segregation and
racism? Did Susan B. Anthony and Eliza
beth Cady Stanton ignore reality when
they fought for women's rights? This is not
to confuse civil rights issues with the war
against Iraq, but rather to make one thing
clear: The movement against the war does
not "ignore" reality — it seeks to chal
lenge the status quo fora better world.
Before I could respond to Kendall
and Madjlessi's arguments, their person
al jabs stopped me: "Radical anti-war ac
tivists," "extreme behavior," "inane na
ture of the protesters." All of these really
shook me. Clearly, inanity is an inherited
trait among people who contest social
and political policies.
I would say that what is "inane" is our
president's utter disregard for interna
tional diplomacy or world opinion. What
is "extreme" is the killing of innocent peo

ple, the destruction of homes and infras
tructure and the infliction of suffering
upon many. If it's "radical" for protesters
to promote peace and social justice and
bring democracy to the streets, then we all
must be crazy.
The columnists state that their col
umn's "true purpose" is "debunking the
arguments of protesters." Great. Let's
talk about the real issues.
Why Iraq? Their main argument
states that the United States has an obli
gation to overturn cruel dictators and
the U.S.'s intervention will result in a
better life for the Iraqi people. This is
based upon three assumptions. First of
all, Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has
committed humanitarian atrocities. Sec
ond, states have a duty to intervene in
another state when that government fails
to protect certain fundamental human
rights of its people, and finally, war is the
best form of intervention to guarantee
security and peace for the Iraqis.
First, we cannot deny that Hussein is a
brutal dictator. A surprising number of
people misunderstand this: protesting
the war most certainly does not mean
supporting Hussein. Second, the U.S.'s
right to intervene may be debatable, but
even if intervention in this case was clear
ly justified, the main issue centers
around how intervention should be im
plemented.
Kendall and Madjlessi choose the use

of force: "It would be nice to topple every
oppressive regime" and rebuild new and
improved societies for everyone.
The U.S. government has not been
and is not out there to protect and liber
ate all peoples from oppressive regimes.
Throughout the Cold War, our govern
ment armed and supported brutal dicta
torships from El Salvador and Nicaragua
to Iran and Iraq. And now, will we re
build Iraq in the same way that we left
the Afghan people to rebuild their own
nation? The point is, in the past, many of
our interventions have increased the tur
moil and suffering of countless peoples
across the world.
War is not the solution. In opposing
the war, protesters demand that our gov
ernment seek more peaceful and con
structive forms of intervention to ad
dress human rights concerns. The Iraqi
people, better than anyone else, have a
right to fight against Hussein's injustices.
The columnists' unsubstantiated claim
that "protesters would have us believe
that the lack of a popular uprising
against Hussein is evidence that the
Iraqis do not hate him" is irresponsible
and misleading, and it misses the point
entirely.
War is not the solution because at this
very moment, and every moment that
passes, it continues to inflict immeasur
able costs on the lives and livelihoods of
the very people we presume to liberate.

War is not the solution because in the af
termath of our destruction, we cannot
guarantee security, peace or sustainable
economic development for the Iraqi
people.
Kendall and Madjlessi introduce a sec
ond angle: That the war is necessary for
U.S. strategic interests. Security sounds
like a more promising reason than pure
humanitarian goodwill. Our government
and media tell us that Iraq is a threat be
cause: We suspect it possesses weapons of
mass destruction, and we suspect it has
connections to al-Qaida.
Rather than discussing the validity of
these suspicions, the two columnists sim
ply allude to security when citing North
Korea as "a far greater threat" than Iraq.
Then they claim that attacking North
Korea "would unleash a humanitarian
disaster," as if our use of force against Iraq
has not already done so. They imply that
the United States chose to attack Iraq sim
ply because it "has limited resources and
can only devote them to so many causes."
At this point, we need to examine the
United States' strategic interests in Iraq:
political and economic interests.
Kendall and Madjlessi worry that a
"premature pullout" would "leave a stain
on our diplomatic record." What has
harmed our diplomatic record is our re
nunciation of almost every diplomatic
agreement we have ever made in the past,
from the Kyoto Protocol to the most re-

tent repudiation of the United Nations'
role in mediating international conflicts.
What the columnists are actually saying is
that stopping the war would damage the
image of the resolve of the United States,
