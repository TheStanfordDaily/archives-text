The Stanford baseball team has yet
to lose a series in Pacific-10 Conference
play this season. The Cardinal has yet
to lose a game to Washington State
since the Cougars joined the confer
ence in 1999.

Basebau
Monday: No. 4 Stanford 8, Washington
State 5 (11 innings)
Tuesday: Stanford 17, Santa Clara 8

Neither statistic boded well for
Washington State, which entered the
weekend series with an 0-10 record
against the Cardinal in Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal completed the sweep
with an 8-5 win in 11 innings on Mon
day after Sunday's scheduled season fi
nale was snowed-out in Pullman.
Sam Fuld's RBI single with two outs
in the top of the 11 th was the difference
in the game, sparking a three-run Car
dinal rally.
Junior David O'Hagan pitched the
final three innings and gave up only
one run to earn the win, as the Cardi
nal earned its first Pac-10 series sweep
of the season.
Due to the snow delay, the Cardinal
had no rest between the Washington
State series and its Tuesday non-con
ference game at Santa Clara.
But if the players were tired, their
bats didn't show it, as Stanford cruised
to a 17-8 victory behind a monster
game from junior Carlos Quentin.
Senior Tim Cunningham, who
started last Tuesday's game against the
University of San Francisco, but was
chased after two innings, was given the
nod again in an attempt to get him back
in the Cardinal rotation.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal staff,

Cunningham's return from injury is
apparently not yet complete.
After the Cardinal offense spotted
him a two run lead in the top half of the
first inning, Cunningham faced five
batters, giving up three runs and two
walks without recording an out before
being replaced by sophomore Billy Pa
ganetti.
Stanford took the lead back with
three runs in the third, including two
off a Brian Hall home run, but the
Broncos answered with three runs off
four hits and a hit-by-pitch in the bot
tom half of the inning.
Trailing 6-5, Stanford broke the
game open with four runs in the fifth
and three more in the sixth and took a
12-7 lead into the eighth.
The Cardinal tacked on four more
runs in the eighth, led by a two-RBI
triple from senior Tobin Swope, to put
the game out of reach.
Junior pitcher Drew Ehrlich en
tered with two outs in the third and
held the Bronco offense at bay for the
remainder of the game. Ehrlich earned
his first win of the season, throwing six
and one-third innings, striking out
seven and allowing two earned runs.
The Santa Clara pitching staff, like
that of every team in the last few weeks,
had no answers for Quentin's bat.
Quentin went four for five with six runs
and six RBIs, extending his hitting
streak to 20 games and boosting his
season batting average to an unbeliev
able .423.
The 14-hit offensive outburst
marked a stark contrast to Stanford's
series opener against Washington State
on Friday, when the Cardinal scrapped
together six runs on only seven hits in a
6-1 victory.
"We weie fortunate offensively
today," coach Mark Marquess said
after that game. "We got a little lucky,

but we bunched the runs together
when we had to. That was really the dif
ference in the game."
Stanford was lucky to get its runs
when it did, as WSU pitcher Tony Ba
naszak went the distance and retired
10 of the last 11 Cardinal batters he
faced.
While Friday's 6-1 score may have
belied a much closer game, the Cardi
nal was truly dominant on Saturday in
a 12-5 victory.

Quentin went four for five with four
RBIs, while senior Ryan Garko blasted
two home runs. Six Cardinal batters
had a multi-hit game.
Last night's game marked the be
ginning of a short stretch of non
conference games for the Cardinal.
Stanford will face Sacramento State
in two games this weekend, fol
lowed by a game against San Jose
State, before resuming Pac-10 play
against Oregon State on April 17.

While senior Ryan McCally and the rest of the Cardinal pitching staff has
been solid this year, the Cardinal bats have produced 37 runs in the last
three games. No. 4 Stanford defeated Santa Clara 1 7-8 last night at Santa
Clara. Junior Carlos Quentin led the 14-hit attack with six runs and six RBIs.
