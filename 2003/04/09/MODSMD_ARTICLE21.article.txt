# I was near perfect so please ex-'Cuse me while I gloat

Last night, my roommate turned to me as the
Syracuse Orangemen put up an impressive
18-point lead over the Kansas Jayhawks. He
asked, with perfect nonchalantness, "Who
could have predicted this?"
Who?
Who do you think?
You may as well call me Miss Cleo, because I was
damn near a Jamaican fortune teller when it came to
this tournament.

I didn't just have three out of four
Final Four pic ks correct. I didn't just
have Syracuse beating Kansas in the
final game. Oh no, that would only
qualify me as a Magic 8-Ball, not my fa
vorite convicted Jamaican swindler.
The final game ended 71-68, a total
of 139 points. My call, for the tiebreak
er: a damned eerie 137!
I have said it before, I will say it
again: I am the greatest there has ever

been and ever will be.
Forgive me for my selfish self-aggrandizement, but
when you score a total of 1,080 points on ESPN's scale,
it is time for some gloating.
So you ask, how did you know? How did you know
that Carmelo "my-name-reminds-Spencer-of-a-deli
cious-candy-bar" Anthony would lead Syracuse to victo
ry? Was it the home court Albany regional? Was it just
dumb luck? Or was it your beautiful hair?
Afew weeks ago, I predicted that LI( -LA would goon a run
ti iat would take them to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tourna
ment. While that prediction didn't come to complete fruition,
the Bniins did upset Aiizona and come within a last-second
miracle of beating Oregon. My rationale for the prediction:
Steve Lavin, a coach I admire for his winning persona
The reason is the same here. Jim Boeheim, coach of
Syracuse, made an appearance on my favorite TV
