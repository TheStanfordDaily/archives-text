# I was near perfect so please ex-'Cuse me while I gloat
## 
### 
Last night, my roommate turned to me as the
Syracuse Orangemen put up an impressive
18-point lead over the Kansas Jayhawks. He
asked, with perfect nonchalantness, "Who
could have predicted this?"
Who?
Who do you think?
You may as well call me Miss Cleo, because I was
damn near a Jamaican fortune teller when it came to
this tournament.

I didn't just have three out of four
Final Four pic ks correct. I didn't just
have Syracuse beating Kansas in the
final game. Oh no, that would only
qualify me as a Magic 8-Ball, not my fa
vorite convicted Jamaican swindler.
The final game ended 71-68, a total
of 139 points. My call, for the tiebreak
er: a damned eerie 137!
I have said it before, I will say it
again: I am the greatest there has ever

been and ever will be.
Forgive me for my selfish self-aggrandizement, but
when you score a total of 1,080 points on ESPN's scale,
it is time for some gloating.
So you ask, how did you know? How did you know
that Carmelo "my-name-reminds-Spencer-of-a-deli
cious-candy-bar" Anthony would lead Syracuse to victo
ry? Was it the home court Albany regional? Was it just
dumb luck? Or was it your beautiful hair?
Afew weeks ago, I predicted that LI( -LA would goon a run
ti iat would take them to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tourna
ment. While that prediction didn't come to complete fruition,
the Bniins did upset Aiizona and come within a last-second
miracle of beating Oregon. My rationale for the prediction:
Steve Lavin, a coach I admire for his winning persona
The reason is the same here. Jim Boeheim, coach of
Syracuse, made an appearance on my favorite TV


Spencer Porter
show, "Pardon the Interruption,"
and refused to make a national
champion pick. At that point, my
mind was set, and my bracket was
complete.
Anybody who doesn't make a pick
has something up his sleeve. It was a
poker game and Boeheim knew he
had a straight flush. You don't bet it
all and give away your hand, jinxing
yourself by saying you are gonna win
it all (especially not with your first two
games in Boston). But you also aren't
going to fold by saying "Kentucky"
and ( idling it a season.
Boeheim knew he had some
thing special and knew that the
combination of the 2-3 zone,
Carmelo and a solid supporting cast
would get it done.
Besides, who else could have
possibly won?
Let's start with Kentucky. The
champion pick by default, Ken
tucky was a strong team and came
into the tournament with a billion
game win streak. They looked hot,
they looked strong, they looked
Tubby. But I knew their kryptonite,
or at least I thought I did. It was all
about 5 little letters: lUPUI.
That's right, I had Kentucky going
out to lUPUI (Indiana University
Purdue University-Indianapolis) in
the first round, and if you had seen
lUPUI's conference championship,
you would have pic ked them too.
Did you see their coach? After
they won the conference champi
onship on a joke of a jumpshot with
no time left, a short, chubby man that
resembled an over-the-top evange
list slammed die floor, pounding out
a heart wrenching "Thank you
Laaawwwwwd! Thank you! Thank
you Laawwwd!"
If your coach passes up the tradi
tional post-game coach's handshake to
have a very intimate moment with
God on the hardwood, you are going

to go far in life. They had heart, and
bean wins championships.
Unfortunately for lUPUI, heart
can only take you so far when your
entire offense is the ANDI mix tape
crossover dribble.
Honesdy, I don't think lUPUI
ran an offensive play the entire
game. They literally just tried to
juke the UK defenders and force a
layup between Kentucky's big men.
It didn't work well.
Unfortunately, my lUPUI war
riors fell to UK, not even covering
the spread and losing me 22 bucks.
However, the coach did show up in
a glossy three-piece maroon suit,
which really made it a moral victory
for all of us.
As for the other main contenders
for the title, I was unimpressed. I had
Arizona losing to Gonzaga, which
could have and should have hap
pened in the overtime bracket-buster.
I had toyed with Maryland win
ning it all, but without a go-to scor
ing option, I was unimpressed. As
for Texas and Oklahoma, I just
couldn't visualize them cutting
down the nets, and that was a good
enough reason for me.
My only major miscue was Mar
quette, thanks to pro-Mizzou advice
given by my former RA Vamsi
Adusumilli, who not-so-coincidental
ly lives in Podunk, Missouri.
So if you're looking fora point to
this column, give up now. After tak
ing 25 bucks off my former friends
and lovers, gloating for the better
part of last night — and surprising
even myself with my brilliance — I
find myself a content columnist.
I will always have a soft spot for
lUPUI, but in the end, I just had a
feeling that Carmelo would lead the
Orange to victory. And in the
NCAA tournament, a gut feeling is
all you will ever need.

and ( idling it a season.
Boeheim knew he had some
thing special and knew that the
combination of the 2-3 zone,
Carmelo and a solid supporting cast
would get it done.
Besides, who else could have
possibly won?
Let's start with Kentucky. The
champion pick by default, Ken
tucky was a strong team and came
into the tournament with a billion
game win streak. They looked hot,
they looked strong, they looked
Tubby. But I knew their kryptonite,
or at least I thought I did. It was all
about 5 little letters: lUPUI.
That's right, I had Kentucky going
out to lUPUI (Indiana University
Purdue University-Indianapolis) in
the first round, and if you had seen
lUPUI's conference championship,
you would have pic ked them too.
Did you see their coach? After
they won the conference champi
onship on a joke of a jumpshot with
no time left, a short, chubby man that
resembled an over-the-top evange
list slammed die floor, pounding out
a heart wrenching "Thank you
Laaawwwwwd! Thank you! Thank
you Laawwwd!"
If your coach passes up the tradi
tional post-game coach's handshake to
have a very intimate moment with
God on the hardwood, you are going

to go far in life. They had heart, and
bean wins championships.
Unfortunately for lUPUI, heart
can only take you so far when your
entire offense is the ANDI mix tape
crossover dribble.
Honesdy, I don't think lUPUI
ran an offensive play the entire
game. They literally just tried to
juke the UK defenders and force a
layup between Kentucky's big men.
It didn't work well.
Unfortunately, my lUPUI war
riors fell to UK, not even covering
the spread and losing me 22 bucks.
However, the coach did show up in
a glossy three-piece maroon suit,
which really made it a moral victory
for all of us.
As for the other main contenders
for the title, I was unimpressed. I had
Arizona losing to Gonzaga, which
could have and should have hap
pened in the overtime bracket-buster.
I had toyed with Maryland win
ning it all, but without a go-to scor
ing option, I was unimpressed. As
for Texas and Oklahoma, I just
couldn't visualize them cutting
down the nets, and that was a good
enough reason for me.
My only major miscue was Mar
quette, thanks to pro-Mizzou advice
given by my former RA Vamsi
Adusumilli, who not-so-coincidental
ly lives in Podunk, Missouri.
So if you're looking fora point to
this column, give up now. After tak
ing 25 bucks off my former friends
and lovers, gloating for the better
part of last night — and surprising
even myself with my brilliance — I
find myself a content columnist.
I will always have a soft spot for
lUPUI, but in the end, I just had a
feeling that Carmelo would lead the
Orange to victory. And in the
NCAA tournament, a gut feeling is
all you will ever need.

Last night, my roommate turned to me as the
Syracuse Orangemen put up an impressive
18-point lead over the Kansas Jayhawks. He
asked, with perfect nonchalantness, "Who
could have predicted this?"
Who?
Who do you think?
You may as well call me Miss Cleo, because I was
damn near a Jamaican fortune teller when it came to
this tournament.

I didn't just have three out of four
Final Four pic ks correct. I didn't just
have Syracuse beating Kansas in the
final game. Oh no, that would only
qualify me as a Magic 8-Ball, not my fa
vorite convicted Jamaican swindler.
The final game ended 71-68, a total
of 139 points. My call, for the tiebreak
er: a damned eerie 137!
I have said it before, I will say it
again: I am the greatest there has ever

been and ever will be.
Forgive me for my selfish self-aggrandizement, but
when you score a total of 1,080 points on ESPN's scale,
it is time for some gloating.
So you ask, how did you know? How did you know
that Carmelo "my-name-reminds-Spencer-of-a-deli
cious-candy-bar" Anthony would lead Syracuse to victo
ry? Was it the home court Albany regional? Was it just
dumb luck? Or was it your beautiful hair?
Afew weeks ago, I predicted that LI( -LA would goon a run
ti iat would take them to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tourna
ment. While that prediction didn't come to complete fruition,
the Bniins did upset Aiizona and come within a last-second
miracle of beating Oregon. My rationale for the prediction:
Steve Lavin, a coach I admire for his winning persona
The reason is the same here. Jim Boeheim, coach of
Syracuse, made an appearance on my favorite TV


Spencer Porter
show, "Pardon the Interruption,"
and refused to make a national
champion pick. At that point, my
mind was set, and my bracket was
complete.
Anybody who doesn't make a pick
has something up his sleeve. It was a
poker game and Boeheim knew he
had a straight flush. You don't bet it
all and give away your hand, jinxing
yourself by saying you are gonna win
it all (especially not with your first two
games in Boston). But you also aren't
going to fold by saying "Kentucky"
and ( idling it a season.
