# In sports, even the greatest fall from grace
## 
### 
There's no question who the biggest
winner in all of sports is today. And
no, it's not Spencer Porter. Carmelo
Anthony concluded his unfath
omable freshman year by winning an NCAA
championship—something many thought he
could do but that few really expected he would
do prior to the NCAA tournament. But he just
kept winning, kept posting unreal numbers
and willed the always-competent Orangemen
to anodier athletic plane. He's so good that if he
could declare for the NBA Draft tomorrow, I
don't think anyone would have the gall to in
voke the tired "college players shouldn't jump

early" axiom. Seriously, is
there anyone on more of a
non-chemical high right now
than Anthony? This kid is liv
ing life at a 100 percent success
rate right now.
But if Anthony is the
biggest winner in sports right
now, who is the biggest loser?
There's a lot of losing in sports,

so to take this honor, you need to not only lose
and lose often, but you need to do so in a tragic,
undeserved manner — a sort of hero's fall, if
you will. One that doesn't even involve the Col

orado Avalanche.
With that in mind, my heart goes out to no
one more today than Detroit Tigers rookie
manager Alan Trammell. The infelicitous Tigs
are 0-6 for the second year in a row, the first
time in 40 years that that dubious feat has been
accomplished.
It was, of course, supposed to be different
under "Tram." He's practically a folk hero in
the state of Michigan, having played all 20 sea
sons of his Hall-of-Fame-caliber career with the
Tigers. He collected 2,365 career hits, was the


Mark Thoma
1984 World Series MVP, won four
Gold Gloves and made six All-Star
teams.
When the Tigers brought Tram
mell home (he had been a coach
with San Diego), they wanted to
renew a sense of pride. They want
ed to put last year's clubhouse ran
cor behind them and play solid, fun
damental baseball. They are con
ducting yet another total rebuild,
with a young, hungry manager
leading it.
But it's always been a difficult
proposition for superstar players to

successfully make the jump to man
aging. Ty Cobb couldn't cut it. Nei
ther could Pete Rose.
So what becomes of someone like
Trammell, who was a brilliant play
er and has so far shown himself to be
a hard-working, fiercely dedicated
manager? What can Trammell say
about a team that has scored six
runs in six games while allowing 33?
After all, Lou Piniella has the Devil
Rays — who also went 55-106 last
year and are arguably the worst
franchise in professional sports —
playing respectable, if not winning,
baseball.
Granted, the Tigers' attitude is
better, and their defense has been
spotless, but the results are still the
same. Most of their fans expect an

even worse result than last year's
55-106 record, tied for worst in the
bigs and 0-11 start. After all, in the
name of rebuilding, in the last year
they've traded their two best pitch
ers and cut loose last season's two
top hitters.
Even for the greatest of them all,
there are no guarantees. Michael
Jordan himself wasn't good enough
to lead the Washington Wizards
team he assembled as an executive
into the playoffs this year. Detroit is
awash with jokes al>out how much
better the Tigers would be if Tram
mell and fellow 1984 World Series
heroes Kirk Gibson (bench coach)
and Lance Parrish (third base
coach) were in the lineup.
What the Tigers plight demon

strates is that nothing is guaranteed
in sports. There is no such thing as a
dynasty. Real-world dynasties last
for hundreds of years; in sports, if
you win three championships in a
row as the Leakers have done, you're
a "dynasty."
The Tigers are one of only two
American League teams with an all
time winning record (you know the
other one). They are also the
losingest team of the past decade.
What goes around, comes around.
Does this mean that the Yankees
will once again suck someday? Yes,
so everyone take heart. It also
means that no team, however bad
or however good, has any guaran
tee of remaining that way. Look at
the fall of North Carolina the past

two years, or UCLA this year. Un
touchable basketball "dynasties" in
the past, they are certified mediocri
ties today.
I'here will surely come a dark
day for Carmelo Anthony, just as
surely as one has come for Alan
Trammell. It's depressing, but it's
also the nature of the beast. Antho
ny should savor the moment — he's
already on a higher plane of
achievement than most athletes
ever attain. As for the downtrodden
Det toilers, they can take heart in the
fact that if success comes and goes to
some extent, so tcxi must failure.

and willed the always-competent Orangemen
to anodier athletic plane. He's so good that if he
could declare for the NBA Draft tomorrow, I
don't think anyone would have the gall to in
voke the tired "college players shouldn't jump

early" axiom. Seriously, is
there anyone on more of a
non-chemical high right now
than Anthony? This kid is liv
ing life at a 100 percent success
rate right now.
But if Anthony is the
biggest winner in sports right
now, who is the biggest loser?
There's a lot of losing in sports,

so to take this honor, you need to not only lose
and lose often, but you need to do so in a tragic,
undeserved manner — a sort of hero's fall, if
you will. One that doesn't even involve the Col

orado Avalanche.
With that in mind, my heart goes out to no
one more today than Detroit Tigers rookie
manager Alan Trammell. The infelicitous Tigs
are 0-6 for the second year in a row, the first
time in 40 years that that dubious feat has been
accomplished.
It was, of course, supposed to be different
under "Tram." He's practically a folk hero in
the state of Michigan, having played all 20 sea
sons of his Hall-of-Fame-caliber career with the
Tigers. He collected 2,365 career hits, was the


Mark Thoma
1984 World Series MVP, won four
Gold Gloves and made six All-Star
teams.
When the Tigers brought Tram
mell home (he had been a coach
with San Diego), they wanted to
renew a sense of pride. They want
ed to put last year's clubhouse ran
cor behind them and play solid, fun
damental baseball. They are con
ducting yet another total rebuild,
with a young, hungry manager
leading it.
But it's always been a difficult
proposition for superstar players to

successfully make the jump to man
aging. Ty Cobb couldn't cut it. Nei
ther could Pete Rose.
So what becomes of someone like
Trammell, who was a brilliant play
er and has so far shown himself to be
a hard-working, fiercely dedicated
manager? What can Trammell say
about a team that has scored six
runs in six games while allowing 33?
After all, Lou Piniella has the Devil
Rays — who also went 55-106 last
year and are arguably the worst
franchise in professional sports —
playing respectable, if not winning,
baseball.
Granted, the Tigers' attitude is
better, and their defense has been
spotless, but the results are still the
same. Most of their fans expect an

even worse result than last year's
55-106 record, tied for worst in the
bigs and 0-11 start. After all, in the
name of rebuilding, in the last year
they've traded their two best pitch
ers and cut loose last season's two
top hitters.
Even for the greatest of them all,
there are no guarantees. Michael
Jordan himself wasn't good enough
to lead the Washington Wizards
team he assembled as an executive
into the playoffs this year. Detroit is
awash with jokes al>out how much
better the Tigers would be if Tram
mell and fellow 1984 World Series
heroes Kirk Gibson (bench coach)
and Lance Parrish (third base
coach) were in the lineup.
What the Tigers plight demon

strates is that nothing is guaranteed
in sports. There is no such thing as a
dynasty. Real-world dynasties last
for hundreds of years; in sports, if
you win three championships in a
row as the Leakers have done, you're
a "dynasty."
The Tigers are one of only two
American League teams with an all
time winning record (you know the
other one). They are also the
losingest team of the past decade.
What goes around, comes around.
Does this mean that the Yankees
will once again suck someday? Yes,
so everyone take heart. It also
means that no team, however bad
or however good, has any guaran
tee of remaining that way. Look at
the fall of North Carolina the past

two years, or UCLA this year. Un
touchable basketball "dynasties" in
the past, they are certified mediocri
ties today.
I'here will surely come a dark
day for Carmelo Anthony, just as
surely as one has come for Alan
Trammell. It's depressing, but it's
also the nature of the beast. Antho
ny should savor the moment — he's
already on a higher plane of
achievement than most athletes
ever attain. As for the downtrodden
Det toilers, they can take heart in the
fact that if success comes and goes to
some extent, so tcxi must failure.
