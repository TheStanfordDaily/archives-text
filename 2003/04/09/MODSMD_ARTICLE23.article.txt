# Card seeks to regain winning ways at home
## 
### LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium hasn't ex
actly been the friendliest of confines for the No. 13
Cardinal softball team (28-14, 2-4 Pac-10). Stan
ford has already suffered a surprising nine defeats
at home, including two difficult extra-inning loss
es this past weekend to the Oregon schools.
The Cardinal will get a chance to improve its
home showing in an afiern<xm doubleheader today
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (17-24, 3-3 Big
West), a team that 1 las gone 6-24 on the mad thus far
this season.
Stanford leads the all-time series between
the Cardinal and Mustangs 4-2 and has owned
the most recent meetings.
Stanford swept a doubleheader in San Luis
Obispo in 2001, and a doubleheader at home in
2000. Cal Poly's wins against the Cardinal came

Today: No. 16 Stanford vs. Cal Poly (doubleheader), 3 p.m.

in 1995, in Stanford softball's early days as an
NCAA program.
The Mustangs' lineup is powered by a trio of
infielders: sophomore shortstop Chelsy
Stoufer, senior first baseman Holly Ballard and
junior second baseman Roni Sparrey. Sparrey
and Ballard were selected to the All-Big West
second team in 2002.
Cal Poly has been victimized by sh<xkly defense
this season, committing 67 errors, but have shown
improvement recently, not committing a single
error in their series with UC-Riverside this past
weekend.
The games will mark a reunion for Stanford's
Tori Nyberg with her former teammate Carrie
Schubert. Nyberg and Schubert were both mem
bers of the Class of 1999 at Carlsmont High of San

Mateo. Nyberg and Schubert were also teammates
on the San Jose Strikkers club team, along with
Stanford's Kira Ching.
The Cardinal bats have been hot of late, but
a failure to produce in key situations cost the
Cardinal against Oregon and Oregon State.
Stanford stranded 20 runners in the two games
and had the winning run on the third in the
extra innings of both losses.
Stanford's top offensive threats continue to be
its freshmen. Shortstop Lauren [.appin leads the
team in hitting at .381, with centerfielder Catalina
Morris second at .339. Both players have adapted
to the college game rapidly and with great success.
"The biggest thing has been the mental as
pect of hitting," Lappin said. "Being able to
have a clear mind at the plate, and finding my
pitches to hit."
Junior third baseman Elizabeth Bendig has
been locked in recendy as well. Bendig went 6-for
-11 over the weekend with two runs and two RBI.
Dana Sorensen will look to continue her dom
inance in the circle, after two strong complete
game performances this past weekend. Sorensen
owns an exceptional nine-to-one strikeout-to
walk ratio and a 13-5 record to lead the team.
The doubleheader against Cal Poly will
serve as preparation for one of the Cardinal's
most difficult tests of the season, a three-game
road swing in the Arizona desert.
"We just try to focus on getting better with
each game," Lappin said. "These games are
good for getting us at-bats, and improving us
for the weekend's games."
Arizona State is ranked 12th in the nation,
but the University of Arizona is the real story
of the season. The Wildcats swept a difficult
road trip that saw them defeat No. 3 Wash
ington in Seattle on Friday, before defeating
top-ranked UCLA twice in Los Angeles, all
while allowing just one run.
Today's first game against Cal Poly begins at
3 p.m. at Smith Family Stadium. The second
game will follow half an hour after the comple
tion of the first.
