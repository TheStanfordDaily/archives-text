### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Anyone who was at the Taube
Family Tennis Center on Tuesday
afternoon witnessed a riveting and
dramatic college sporting event
that they're not likely to forget
anytime soon.

Men's Tennis
Tuesday: No 7 Stanford def No. 4
Cal 4-3

The No. 7 Stanford (16-3, 3-0
Pac-10) men's tennis team scored
an emotional, come-from-hehind
4-3 victory over No. 4 (.al (16-3,2-
1) thanks to the heroics of sopho
more Sam Warburg.
With the match knotted at 3-3,
Warburg trailed Cal's Or Dekel
6-2, 3-6, 1-4. The Golden Rears
looked to be on their way to
handing the Cardinal its third loss

in the last four meetings between
the two schools, especially consid
ering Dekel held a two-service
break lead in the deciding set.
But Warburg had other plans.
The matches on courts two and
five had just finished, so the
large and enthusiastic crowd gath
ered around court four to watch
Warburg's match as he trailed 1-4.
The crowd seemed to energize
Warburg and the level of his play
improved immediately. With
Dekel serving at 1-4, Warburg hit
a barrage of winners to secure the
service break.
The next game Warburg won
at love, capping the game with an
overhead smash off a lob that
seemed out of reach until the final
moment.
As Warburg began to build mo
mentum and victory suddenly
seemed possible, the crowd's fer
vor gathered in strength. Between
points, members of Warburg's fra
ternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
joined with the tennis team in
leading chants of "Go . . . Stan

Fourth-ranked Scott Lipsky and doubles partner David Martin lost for just
the fourth time all year, but Stanford rallied to defeat Cal 4-3 behind Sam
Warburg's comeback victory in the deciding match at home yesterday.
ford!" and "Go . . . Warburg!"
Warburg continued his hot
streak, again breaking Dekel's
serve to even the match at 4-4.
With the crowd against him
and his opponent suddenly
playing with enhanced intensi
ty, Dekel seemed to sense the
match slipping away. He didn't
help his own cause by double
faulting twice.
Warburg held serve easily
to win the fourth game in a
row to go up 5-4. In the fol
lowing game, he quickly won
the first three points to take a
40-0 lead and gain three
match points.
For the first time in what
seemed like an eternity, War
burg made an unforced error
when he netted a backhand.
Unfazed, he won the next point
and pandemonium ensued.
The crowd burst into raucous
applause and yelling. War
burg's teammates and friends
mobbed him as he fell to the
ground in amazement at his re
markable comeback.
After emerging from the
pack to shake Dekel's hand,
Warburg hugged his sister and
parents.
The win avenged Stanford's
season-opening 4-3 loss to the
Bears in Berkeley on Feb. 1.
The win was hard to believe
considering the Cardinal
began the match by losing the
doubles point. Being down 1-0
meant Stanford would have to
win four of six singles matches
to get the win. In their previ
ous meeting, the Bears won
four of six.
"This is an unbelievable
win," senior Ail-American
Scott Lipsky said. "It shows
that we can come back after
losing the doubles point
against a top team like Cal.
It's our first big win since
Haviland left and to beat the
same team that we lost to with
him shows that we can be just
as good."
In addition to Warburg's
win on court four, the Cardi
nal picked up victories on
courts one, three and five
from senior All-American
David Martin, freshman KC
Corkery and freshman James
Fade.
