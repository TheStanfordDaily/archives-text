# Santa Cruz no stroll on the beach for golfers
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Once again, the No. 11 UCLA
men's golf team showed why they
have been the most consistent and
successful squad in the Pacific-10
Conference this year. Looking for
their fourth team victory of the
year, the Bruins steamed out to a
phenomenal 13-stroke lead after
two rounds at the Western Inter
collegiate in Santa Cruz on Mon
day.
It was a team effort for UCLA,
as three Bruins crowded into the
top 10 on the first day, with junior
Steve Conway claiming a share of
the tournament lead at one under
par. Stanford started strong but
could manage just a 12th-place
finish.
In some of the toughest scoring
conditions all year, the Bruins left
a very talented field fighting for
second as they cruised to their
third tournament victory of the
spring season. Conway shot 69 in
the final round to win the individ
ual title by a shot.
In contrast to the red-hot Bru
ins, the Stanford team had little
reason for confidence upon arriv
ing at Pasatiempo Country Club.
Last year's team struggled to a
14th-place finish (out of 17
teams) on the same golf course,
and the top Cardinal finisher in
that event, Phillip Rowe, has
since graduated.
To make matters worse, there
is great concern in the Stanford
camp about the health of senior
standout Jim Seki. After playing
through back trouble all year to
lead the team in nearly every cate
gory, his withdrawal from the Car
dinal's last tournament signaled
big trouble for Stanford's hopes
toward the end of the season.
Despite these worries, howev
er, the Cardinal performed sur
prisingly well on the first day of

competition. Sophomore Kevin
Blue, who had competed in only
three events before this week, led
the Cardinal out of the gates.
Although Blue recorded his
worst regular-season finish at the
Western last year, he began this
year's event in fine fashion on
Monday, carding rounds of 68
and 74. At two strokes over par, he
was tied for eighth-place overall
after 36 holes.
Another Cardinal player find

ing redemption on Monday was
junior Blake Mastalir. After strug
gling to a 61st-place showing last
year, Mastalir fired 73-72 in his
first two rounds, tying for 21st
place.
Senior George Downing, one
of the Cardinal's most consistent
players in recent weeks, contin
ued his solid play at Pasatiempo.
Shrugging off memories of a
tough outing last year, Downing
shot 75-72 on the first day, mov

ing into a nine-way tie tor 29th.
In a complete role reversal,
Seki and fellow senior Ron Won
brought up the rear for the Cardi
nal. Seki shot 76-73 to finish the
day in a tie for 45th place. Won,
who has struggled markedly of
late, rounded out Stanford's scor
ing, shooting 74-78, and finishing
at 12 over par. His score left him in
57th place.
In the final round, however,
the Cardinal failed to maintain its
strong start, giving back nearly all
the position it had built in the first
36 holes.
Blue struggled to a 7-over-par
77 leaving him 9 over par for the
tournament and tied for 20th
overall. Downing, the best of the
group on Tuesday, could only
manage a 75, finishing at 222 and
three shots back of his teammate.
Mastalir pointed to the greens
as a major source of anguish:
"The greens were really hard and
fast. There were some tough [pin
positions] that made putting real
ly difficult."
Although Mastalir felt he
played well around the greens all
day, he ballooned to a 77 during
the final 18 holes, ending one shot
behind Downing.
Seki and Won also failed to
improve on their disappointing
opening day, shooting 78 and
79, respectively, in the final
round. Seki finished the tourna
ment at 17-over par, while Won
carded 231 for the 54 holes, 21-
over par.
The Cardinal's final-round 308
pushed its two-day total to 889, 49
strokes over par, and the team fell
from its sixth-place perch to a dis
appointing 12th-place finish out
of 18 teams.
Next week, the Cardinal will
head to Tempe, Ariz, and the Val
ley of the Sun, where the team will
compete in the ASU Thunderbird
Invitational April 14 and 15.
