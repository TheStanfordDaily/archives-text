### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 10 men's volleyball team
(15-11, 12-8 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) endured Derby Week on
the Pacific campus, overcoming the
heckling of sorority girls rocking in '80s
prom-wear to come away with its third
straight victory over the No. 4 Tigers
(18-11, 12-8 MPSF).
Stanford left Stockton with a com
pelling four-game win, dropping only a
close third game, to clinch a spot in the
MPSF playoffs for the fourth consecu
tive year.
"The main thing was that on our
sideout game, we received serve really
well," coach Don Shaw said. "It made it
really hard for them to score points."
Despite the convincing final score,
the Cardinal fell behind early in the
match, allowing Pacific to take a 10-4
lead.
"We got behind early, but Will [Cur
tis] got hot with his serve," Shaw said.
"With serving and some good blocking
defense we were able to get back in the
game."
Senior outside hitter Will Curtis won
a total of eight service points in game
one, with two coming off of aces.
On Curtis' serve, the Cardinal
charged back to tie the game at 16-16.
Stanford continued its strong play to
decisively take game one 30-25.
Game two saw Cardinal domina
tion throughout as Stanford used ag
gressive serving and strong service
receiving to stay in front of the
Tigers.
"Our serve receivers, specifically
[sophomore libero David] Vogel and
[senior outside hitter Billy] Strickland
were great," Shaw said. "[Senior oppo

site hitter CurtJToppel was in there as
the third guy [for service reception].
And their [Toppel, Vogel and Strick
land's] passing allowed us to do a lot of
things."
The Cardinal built its lead to 20-14
on a Paul Bocage kill and never looked
back in the second game. The senior
middle blocker played a solid game for
the Cardinal, finishing with 10 kills and
a service ace.
The game ended on an attack error
by Tiger senior Martin Berntsen.
In a do-or-die situation, Pacific came
out swinging in the third game.
"Their backs were up against the
wall," Shaw said. "So they had to play
better [in game three] and they did."
The first half of the game was ex
tremely tight, with the two teams trad
ing points until the score was tied 12-12.
However, the Tigers pulled away on
several Cardinal miscues and Pacific
was eventually able to stretch its lead to
22-18.
The Tigers didn't let the Cardinal
get any closer and closed out the game
on a kill by sophomore Brian Zodrow
fora 30-27 win.
However, toward the end of the
third game, Shaw substituted in sopho
more middle blocker Craig Buell.
"Buell provided us with a great
spark off the bench," Shaw said.
In his two games played, Buell
racked up 10 kills on a .750 hitting per
centage. He also added 2 digs.
The final game was again dominated
by t he Cardinal. The team was able to put
together many short streaks of points
and slowly built up a substantial lead.
The Cardinal capitalized on Tiger
errors to get to game point and
super-sub Buell finished off the
match with a kill.
