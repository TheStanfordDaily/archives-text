Breast Implants and Suicide

A study published in the British Med
ical Journal suggests that women who
get breast implants for cosmetic rea
sons have a higher rate of suicide. The
study involved Swedish women who
had breast implants between 1965
and 1993. The authors believe there
is a link between psychiatric disorder
and a desire for cosmetic surgery.
Women with low self-esteem or de-

pression might be more tempted to get a breast im
plant. According to Veronica Koot, the lead investiga
tor, "One can think of an extra test, a psychological
screening, that can be done when a woman asks the
doctor for surgery. Doctors [generally] do keep this in
mind, but maybe we should stress this a bit more."
Ancestral Footprints Discovered

University of Padua scien
tists believe a series of fos
silized tracks preserved on
the slopes of an extinct Ital
ian volcano were made by
humans 350,000 years ago.
Many of the footprints have
ball and heel features, and
small impressions that can
be interpreted as tows. "We
believe that these tracks are
the oldest human foot
prints found so far and that
they were made by ho
minids [early humans] who

had a fully bipedal, free-standing gait," the scientists
wrote in the journal Nature. Critics believe the tracks
could have been made by Homo neanderthalis, our
close cousins, who mysteriously disappeared 30,000
years ago. If true, these will be the oldest known steps
of our species, Homo sapiens. The oldest record of
Homo steps dates back to 3.6 million years ago in
Tanzania.
New Telescope to Probe the Cosmos
NASA will be launching the fourth and last of
planned Great Observatories this Spring. The
agency made plans to investigate the skies for all
wavelengths in the '70s. The new telescope, current
ly named The Space Infrared Telescope Facility
(SIRTF), will focus on infrared light (IR) above the
earth's atomosphere. It will supplement informa
tion obtained via other telescopes, namely the
Compton, which detected highly energetic and typ
ically violent events, the Chandra, which gathers X
ray data and the Hubble, which looks at UV, visible
and portions of IR. According to Micael Werner,
SIFTR's project scientist, this last Great Observatory
has an 85-centimeter mirror that will enable it to ex
plore "the old, the cold and the dirty." IR is difficult
to detect on Earth because most of it is blocked by the
atmosphere or scattered by particles within.
Corn Pajamas
Perhaps one day your clothes will be made of corn.
Minnesota-based Cargill Dow LLC has developed a
corn-based fiber called Ingeo. Cargill Dow
spokesman Michael O'Brien said that "You could go
to bed at night with pajamas made from it. " The
manufacturing process is simple — the corn is milled
into sugar, the sugar is fermented and the lactic acid,
a byproduct of the process, is purified. The acid is
transformed into plastic pellets, which can be mold
ed into cups, wrappers or spun into Ingeo. The fiber
does not require petroleum-based chemicals and is
biodegradable.
Rare Hydrogen-7 Detected
Scientists from the RIKEN laboratory in Japan an
nounced last month that they were able to detect hy
drogen-7, an isotope of hydrogen with six neutrons.
Isotopes are the different forms of the same element,
which is defined by the number of protons in its nu
cleus. Hydrogen has one proton, helium has two and
so on. Hydrogen-1 is hydrogen with atomic mass one
(i.e. one proton, no neutrons) and is called protium,
hydrogen-2 has one neutron and is called deuteri
um, hydrogen-3 has two neutrons and is called tri
tium. To create hydrogen-7, which has a lifetime of a
few nanoseconds, the scientists produced helium-8
from radioactive oxygen-18 and reacted it with hy
drogen- 1.
Crop Killing Fungus
Geneticists have published the first complete genome
of a crop-killing fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. The fun
gus causes rice blast disease, which destroys enough
rice to feed more than 60 million people. Rice blast is
controlled by costly and potentially hazardous chemi
cals. Genome sequencing might give insights into how
host and parasite interact and how to prevent infection
and spread of the disease. Patrick Dennis, NSF's mi
crobial genetics program director, said, "The scientific
community needs this information to fill long-standing
gaps in our understanding [of the fungus] and to de
velop new strategies for controlling this destructive
pathogen." Research is currently underway at North
Carolina State University and the Whitehead Insti
tute's Center for Genome Research in Massachusetts.
