# Super Mario finally meets Sonic The Hedgehog:
## Another GameBoy Reincarnation 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The Gameßoy is back. The Game-
Boy Advance SP, released last month,
has already flown off shelves, marking
yet another notch in the Nintendo success

story.
Nintendo now controls 98 percent of the
portable gaming market, though its path to pop

ularity was never certain. But by taking advantage
of the popularity ofTetris in 1989 and Pokemon in
1996, Nintendo rose to the forefront of hand-held
gaming.

Nintendo released the first hand-held game sys
tem, the Game & Watch, in 1980 and offered a total
of 59 games. But it wasn't until 1981 and the success
of Donkey Kong that the Nintendo name really be
came associated with video games. In 1985, the

Super Mario Bros, made their debut on
the Nintendo Entertainment System
home console. The same year, Sega in
troduced its Sega Master System, featur
ing Sonic the Hedgehog. In 1991, Nin

tendo released the first Gameßoy,
which used a system of inter

changeable game cartridges.
The Atari Lynx and Sega
Game Gear came out
around the same time,
but they failed to catch
on like the Gameßoy.
The defining factor of

the Gameßoy's success,
despite the fact that it
lacked the color screens
of the Lynx and the Game

Gear, was the popularity of its
games. Tetris, a game invented by
Russian mathematician Alexey Pajit
nov, was deceptively simple, yet it

drove sales of the Game-
Boy console. The ap
pearance of the Mario
franchise in Super Mario
Land in late 1991 solidi
fied Nintendo's grip on
the market.
By 1994, Nintendo
decided to link the
Gameßoy with its Super
Nintendo console and
developed the Super
Gameßoy, which let

Gameßoy games be played with
a full-size picture on a TV. The Gameßoy Pocket,
released in 1996, was 30 percent smaller, but in
cluded the same size screen. At this point however,
sales began to slow.
It was again a series of games that propelled

Nintendo to a new level. This series
came in the form of a small yellow
character called Pikachu and his
Pokemon friends, and by 1997
sales of the Gameßoy platform
had skyrocketed. The series in
tegrated a card game, a televi
sion program, and the Game-
Boy games. Players roamed the
Pokemon world, battling and
capturing monsters as they en
countered them.

The Game Boy Color,
which appeared in the same
year, helped drive units into the
hands of gamers. Over the next
three years, a sequence of Poke
mon-themed games were re
leased, beginning with Poke

mon Red and Green and lead
ing to Yellow and later Crystal,
among others. But although the
Gameßoy was selling, there hadn't

/ O'
been a significant technological upgrade
for almost a decade.
On Nov. 11, 2001, the

Gameßoy Advance hit the streets.
The GBA has buttons on either
side of the screen, leading to a
horizontal rather than a verti
cal layout. The screen was also
wider and capable of display
ing 511 simultaneous colors.

However, the screen was
rather dim and users suffered
eye fatigue.

Around the same time, the GBA
versions of the Pokemon series, Pokemon Ruby and
Sapphire became available. Twenty-four

million GBA's were sold in its first 18
months.
This was remedied with

the Gameßoy Advance SP,
which became available on
March 23, 2003. The GBA SP
has a bright LCD display with
a built-in light and features a
flip design, similar to makeup
compacts, folding into half its
size when not in use.

While Nintendo remains
the leader in the hand-held
gaming market, Nokia recently
announced plans to market a unit

similar to the GBA by the end of the year.
Nokia's N-Gage is a cell phone and hand-held

gaming console com
bined in a single unit.

Hit games such as Tetris, Super Mario and Pokemon have
helped Nintendo become the undisputed king of handheld
gaming. The latest model, the Gameßoy Advance SP, is the
first to use a flip-top design and a backlit screen.
