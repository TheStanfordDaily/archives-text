# A 						Hippocratic Oath?
## The 						debate over stem cell research 
### TANIA ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Feb. 1, 2003, 16-year old Dmitri
Bonnville was shot by a nail gun. The
main pumping chamber of his heart
was pierced by a three-inch nail, and he
suffered a heart attack a few days later.
In attempts to save his life, doctors per
formed a new experimental procedure
to regenerate the damaged tissue of
Bonnville's heart by injecting his coro
nary artery with adult stem cells har
vested from his own bloodstream.
After the operation, the boy's ejec
tion fraction, a measure of the heart's
function, had risen from the danger
ously low level of 25 percent to 35 per
cent. According to a recent New York
Times article, however, there is no di
rect evidence that the stem cells caused
an improvement in Bonnville's heart's
condition.
If enough scientific evidence is
found linking adult stem cell use to
Bonnville's recovery, adult stem cells
could replace the controversial use of
embryonic stem cells in the United
States to cure diseases and could possi
bly affect the Bush administration's
stance on stem cell research.
"The Bush administration favors
vigorous research into the potential of
adult stem cells and has supported the
efforts of the NIH [National Institute of
Health] to broaden that support," said

Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford pro
fessor and member of the President's
Council for Bio-ethics. "It's generally
considered that adult stem cells do not
pose the same fundamental ethical
questions, so most people, including
myself, favor adult stem cell research
across the board," he said.
According to an NIH stem cell
primer, both adult and embryonic
stem cells are pluripotent — meaning
that they are capable of becoming a va
riety of different cell that can heal and
regenerate damaged body tissue.
While adult stem cells are generated
from existing cells in the human body,
embryonic stem cells are derived from
a human embryo, preventing the em
bryo from developing.
The controversy surrounding em
bryonic stem cell research has resulted
in a milieu of moral and ethical reser
vations in the United States.
On April 9, 2001, President George
W. Bush declared he would support
funding and research on more than 60
existing embryonic stem cell lines. Ac
cording to his declaration, the embryos
from which the existing stem cells were
derived were already destroyed and
therefore could not develop into a
human. However, he completely dis
couraged the use of stem cell lines de
rived from newly destroyed embryos.
"When President Bush said we
could use the existing cell lines, I
think he was struggling with a very
difficult issue of competing goods,"
Hurlbut said. These cell lines were
created before there was serious pub
lic discussion of the moral issue [and]
no good would be served by discard
ing them."
As a member of the Council, Hurl
but is a key player in determining
U.S. policy toward stem cell research.
A year after the president de
clared his policy on existing stem
cells, Hurlbut sided with other mem
bers of the Council to enforce a four
year moratorium on human cloning
for bio-medical research, which in
volves the use of embryonic stem
cells and an outright ban on repro
ductive cloning in the United States,
by a 10-7 vote.
"I wholeheartedly support the use
of these [existing stem cell lines]," he
said. "For some people, however,
even these cell lines are seen as. . .
the instrumental use of an embryo
created for life but now relegated to a
project of a completely different char
acter. I support the Council's call for
a moratorium so we can have deeper
dialogues in our country on the
meaning of all of this."
Although he supports the use of
the existing stem cell lines, Hurlbut
has ethical qualms with the creation of
embryos solely to harvest embryonic
stem cells.
"The intentional creation of
human life ... in order to harvest out
its parts strikes me as crossing a moral
boundary that we should think
deeply about as a civilization," he said.
His views and the Council's deci
sion have sent ripples across the med
ical community, including those in
the Stanford community who sup

port stem cell research.
Dr. Irving Weissman, a pioneering
stem cell researcher and director of
Stanford's new Institute for Cancer/
Stem Cell Biology research, believes
stem cell research will be able to save
lives in the future.
"Most scientists and doctors [do]
not feel that the production of these
cell lines cross any serious ethical
dilemmas, and weighing risks against
benefits, there are more benefits," he
said.
According to a Stanford University
Medical Center publication, the re
search institute, the first of its kind in
the nation, will primarily utilize stem
cell and cancer biology to develop
treatments for cancer and other dis
eases. This type of stem cell research
involves the transfer of a cell nucleus
to an egg without a nucleus and al
lowing the egg to divide into cells.
These cells, which are removed, are
the resulting embryonic stem cell
lines.
Weissman firmly believes embry
onic stem cell research will advance
the field of medical treatments by
pinpointing the genetic origins, de
velopment and treatment of diseases.
He also claims that the innovative na
ture of stem cell research should not
serve as a deterrent to its use. "If we
were to ban much of the same innov
ative research 25 years ago, thou
sands to hundreds of thousands
would be dead without the products
of DNA recombinant studies, insulin,
GCSF and interferon for viral infec
tions and cancer," he said.
According to Weissman, the ethi
cal qualms of stem cell research are
annulled by the Hippocratic Oath, an
oath all practicing doctors are sworn
to take affirming their commitment to
promote the health of their patients.
"No personal issue of [a doctor's]
religious, ethical, moral, issue of race
and political persuasion, should stand
between ... [his] highest priority for
taking care of the health of [his] pre

sent and future patients," he said. As
for the use of adult stem cells to treat
Bonnville's heart, Weissman and
Hurlbut are skeptical about the ex
perimental procedure.
"One has to greet this announce
ment with hope and with a measure
of'wait-and-see,'" Hurlbut said. "In
the past such promising results have
proven to be unsubstantiated by sci
entific replication."
Weissman ottered a more skepti
cal perspective. "Blood-forming
stem cells certainly regenerate blood
cells; brain stem cells are able to re
generate brain tissue," he said.
"Could there be pluripotent adult
stem cells as embryonic stem cells?
There is no independent, verifiable
scientific evidence."
Instead of focusing on what he
claims are "unproven experiments,"
Weissman believes the key to under
standing adult stem cells is through
closely examining the interactions of
animal cells and eggs. "We need to
have somebody at Stanford who un
derstands how the nucleus from a
mouse skin cell, when put into a
mouse egg without a nucleus,
changes into a stem cell," he said. "If
we could understand how that works,
then we might be able to find a way to
use adult stem cells."
Both Hurlbut and Weissman also
believe stem cell research should be
comprised of embryonic and adult
stem cells."From a purely scientific
perspective, you would want to do the
broadest inquiry you could, which
would include cells at all stages," said
Hurlbut.
Regarding the future of adult stem
cell research, Hurlbut believes the po
tential benefits of utilizing adult stem
cells will arrive more slowly than ex
pected.
"I think we need to calm down,
slow down and truly listen to one an
other," he said. "There is a lot of pos
sibility and promise, but most of this is
not going to happen fast."

In attempts to save his life, doctors per
formed a new experimental procedure
to regenerate the damaged tissue of
Bonnville's heart by injecting his coro
nary artery with adult stem cells har
vested from his own bloodstream.
After the operation, the boy's ejec
tion fraction, a measure of the heart's
function, had risen from the danger
ously low level of 25 percent to 35 per
cent. According to a recent New York
Times article, however, there is no di
rect evidence that the stem cells caused
an improvement in Bonnville's heart's
condition.
If enough scientific evidence is
found linking adult stem cell use to
Bonnville's recovery, adult stem cells
could replace the controversial use of
embryonic stem cells in the United
States to cure diseases and could possi
bly affect the Bush administration's
stance on stem cell research.
"The Bush administration favors
vigorous research into the potential of
adult stem cells and has supported the
efforts of the NIH [National Institute of
Health] to broaden that support," said

Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford pro
fessor and member of the President's
Council for Bio-ethics. "It's generally
considered that adult stem cells do not
pose the same fundamental ethical
questions, so most people, including
myself, favor adult stem cell research
across the board," he said.
According to an NIH stem cell
primer, both adult and embryonic
stem cells are pluripotent — meaning
that they are capable of becoming a va
riety of different cell that can heal and
regenerate damaged body tissue.
While adult stem cells are generated
from existing cells in the human body,
embryonic stem cells are derived from
a human embryo, preventing the em
bryo from developing.
The controversy surrounding em
bryonic stem cell research has resulted
in a milieu of moral and ethical reser
vations in the United States.
On April 9, 2001, President George
W. Bush declared he would support
funding and research on more than 60
existing embryonic stem cell lines. Ac
cording to his declaration, the embryos
from which the existing stem cells were
derived were already destroyed and
therefore could not develop into a
human. However, he completely dis
couraged the use of stem cell lines de
rived from newly destroyed embryos.
"When President Bush said we
could use the existing cell lines, I
think he was struggling with a very
difficult issue of competing goods,"
Hurlbut said. These cell lines were
created before there was serious pub
lic discussion of the moral issue [and]
no good would be served by discard
ing them."
As a member of the Council, Hurl
but is a key player in determining
U.S. policy toward stem cell research.
A year after the president de
clared his policy on existing stem
cells, Hurlbut sided with other mem
bers of the Council to enforce a four
year moratorium on human cloning
for bio-medical research, which in
volves the use of embryonic stem
cells and an outright ban on repro
ductive cloning in the United States,
by a 10-7 vote.
"I wholeheartedly support the use
of these [existing stem cell lines]," he
said. "For some people, however,
even these cell lines are seen as. . .
the instrumental use of an embryo
created for life but now relegated to a
project of a completely different char
acter. I support the Council's call for
a moratorium so we can have deeper
dialogues in our country on the
meaning of all of this."
Although he supports the use of
the existing stem cell lines, Hurlbut
has ethical qualms with the creation of
embryos solely to harvest embryonic
stem cells.
"The intentional creation of
human life ... in order to harvest out
its parts strikes me as crossing a moral
boundary that we should think
deeply about as a civilization," he said.
His views and the Council's deci
sion have sent ripples across the med
ical community, including those in
the Stanford community who sup

port stem cell research.
Dr. Irving Weissman, a pioneering
stem cell researcher and director of
Stanford's new Institute for Cancer/
Stem Cell Biology research, believes
stem cell research will be able to save
lives in the future.
"Most scientists and doctors [do]
not feel that the production of these
cell lines cross any serious ethical
dilemmas, and weighing risks against
benefits, there are more benefits," he
said.
According to a Stanford University
Medical Center publication, the re
search institute, the first of its kind in
the nation, will primarily utilize stem
cell and cancer biology to develop
treatments for cancer and other dis
eases. This type of stem cell research
involves the transfer of a cell nucleus
to an egg without a nucleus and al
lowing the egg to divide into cells.
These cells, which are removed, are
the resulting embryonic stem cell
lines.
Weissman firmly believes embry
onic stem cell research will advance
the field of medical treatments by
pinpointing the genetic origins, de
velopment and treatment of diseases.
He also claims that the innovative na
ture of stem cell research should not
serve as a deterrent to its use. "If we
were to ban much of the same innov
ative research 25 years ago, thou
sands to hundreds of thousands
would be dead without the products
of DNA recombinant studies, insulin,
GCSF and interferon for viral infec
tions and cancer," he said.
According to Weissman, the ethi
cal qualms of stem cell research are
annulled by the Hippocratic Oath, an
oath all practicing doctors are sworn
to take affirming their commitment to
promote the health of their patients.
"No personal issue of [a doctor's]
religious, ethical, moral, issue of race
and political persuasion, should stand
between ... [his] highest priority for
taking care of the health of [his] pre

sent and future patients," he said. As
for the use of adult stem cells to treat
Bonnville's heart, Weissman and
Hurlbut are skeptical about the ex
perimental procedure.
"One has to greet this announce
ment with hope and with a measure
of'wait-and-see,'" Hurlbut said. "In
the past such promising results have
proven to be unsubstantiated by sci
entific replication."
Weissman ottered a more skepti
cal perspective. "Blood-forming
stem cells certainly regenerate blood
cells; brain stem cells are able to re
generate brain tissue," he said.
"Could there be pluripotent adult
stem cells as embryonic stem cells?
There is no independent, verifiable
scientific evidence."
Instead of focusing on what he
claims are "unproven experiments,"
Weissman believes the key to under
standing adult stem cells is through
closely examining the interactions of
animal cells and eggs. "We need to
have somebody at Stanford who un
derstands how the nucleus from a
mouse skin cell, when put into a
mouse egg without a nucleus,
changes into a stem cell," he said. "If
we could understand how that works,
then we might be able to find a way to
use adult stem cells."
Both Hurlbut and Weissman also
believe stem cell research should be
comprised of embryonic and adult
stem cells."From a purely scientific
perspective, you would want to do the
broadest inquiry you could, which
would include cells at all stages," said
Hurlbut.
Regarding the future of adult stem
cell research, Hurlbut believes the po
tential benefits of utilizing adult stem
cells will arrive more slowly than ex
pected.
"I think we need to calm down,
slow down and truly listen to one an
other," he said. "There is a lot of pos
sibility and promise, but most of this is
not going to happen fast."
On Feb. 1, 2003, 16-year old Dmitri
Bonnville was shot by a nail gun. The
main pumping chamber of his heart
was pierced by a three-inch nail, and he
suffered a heart attack a few days later.
