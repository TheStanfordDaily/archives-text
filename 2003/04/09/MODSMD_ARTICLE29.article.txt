## The

### TANIA ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Feb. 1, 2003, 16-year old Dmitri
Bonnville was shot by a nail gun. The
main pumping chamber of his heart
was pierced by a three-inch nail, and he
suffered a heart attack a few days later.
In attempts to save his life, doctors per
formed a new experimental procedure
to regenerate the damaged tissue of
Bonnville's heart by injecting his coro
nary artery with adult stem cells har
vested from his own bloodstream.
After the operation, the boy's ejec
tion fraction, a measure of the heart's
function, had risen from the danger
ously low level of 25 percent to 35 per
cent. According to a recent New York
Times article, however, there is no di
rect evidence that the stem cells caused
an improvement in Bonnville's heart's
condition.
If enough scientific evidence is
found linking adult stem cell use to
Bonnville's recovery, adult stem cells
could replace the controversial use of
embryonic stem cells in the United
States to cure diseases and could possi
bly affect the Bush administration's
stance on stem cell research.
"The Bush administration favors
vigorous research into the potential of
adult stem cells and has supported the
efforts of the NIH [National Institute of
Health] to broaden that support," said

Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford pro
fessor and member of the President's
Council for Bio-ethics. "It's generally
considered that adult stem cells do not
pose the same fundamental ethical
questions, so most people, including
myself, favor adult stem cell research
across the board," he said.
According to an NIH stem cell
primer, both adult and embryonic
stem cells are pluripotent â€” meaning
that they are capable of becoming a va
riety of different cell that can heal and
regenerate damaged body tissue.
While adult stem cells are generated
from existing cells in the human body,
embryonic stem cells are derived from
a human embryo, preventing the em
bryo from developing.
The controversy surrounding em
bryonic stem cell research has resulted
in a milieu of moral and ethical reser
vations in the United States.
On April 9, 2001, President George
W. Bush declared he would support
funding and research on more than 60
existing embryonic stem cell lines. Ac
cording to his declaration, the embryos
from which the existing stem cells were
derived were already destroyed and
therefore could not develop into a
human. However, he completely dis
couraged the use of stem cell lines de
rived from newly destroyed embryos.
