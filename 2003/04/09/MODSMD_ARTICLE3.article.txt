Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy Prof. Renato Rosaldo defined
the theme of this year's Cesar
Chavez commemoration at Kresge
Auditorium in a sentence.
"Art at its best and struggle for
social justice are one and the
same," lie said.
Through musical expression,
spoken word performance and ac
tivist speech, members from all
branches of the Stanford commu
nity celebrated Chavez's culture
and cause.
Born and raised in Arizona,
Chavez began his career as a com
munity organizer in 1952 when he
joined a prominent Latino civil
rights group. His goal was to create
an organization to relieve farm
workers from the same poverty
and oppression he had suffered in
his youth. A decade later, he
founded the association that would
later become the National Farm

Workers of America. Following his
death in 1993, he was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Many of the speakers through
out the celebration last night em
phasized the relevance of Chavez's
fight to the Stanford campus and
surrounding communities.
"The message that hits home
here at Stanford is the struggle for
workers' rights and his non-violent
approach to make change," said
Emanuel Pleitez, who helped coor
dinate the commemoration. "Ac
tivist groups at Stanford and all
over the Bay Area have continued
that struggle, as is evident through
the Workers' March this past Sun
day during Community Day and
even the anti-war protests."
Rosaldo, the event's master of
ceremonies, expressed similar sen
timents.
"I think the movements
[Chavez] inspired do touch us
here," he said. "He inspired cre

alive production and that includes
academia."
Following his brief remarks,
Rosaldo introduced freshman
Francisco Cendejas and sopho
more Laura Avina, who an
nounced the winners of MEChA's
Cesar Chavez Art and Essay Con
test. Two of the scholarship recipi
ents, ninth-grader Andrea Payne

and third-grader Brenda Juarez,
read their essays on the life and sig
nificance of Chavez's work aloud to
the audience.
Rosaldo then introduced the
evening's keynote speaker, Delores
Huerta, co-founder of United
Farm Workers with Chavez. Born
in 1930, Huerta was the daughter
of Juan Fernandez, a field worker
who became both a union activist
and state assemblyman in New
Mexico. As a member of the Com
munity Service Organization, she
urged voter registration and

fought segregation. A single moth
er of seven children at the time,
Huerta joined forces with Chavez
in 1962 to found the N FWA. Today
she still works for both immigrant
and women's rights.
She drew special attention to the
fight for better conditions at Stan
ford's neighboring Webb Ranch, at
one point inviting workers from
the ranch on-stage to voice their
opinions.
" It's just a disgrace that Stanford
can be right next to a ranch where
they are oppressing workers and

not giving them the wage they de
serve," Huerta said.
She exhorted the Stanford com
munity to take action.
"When you have an education,
it is your responsibility to come out
and work for those who didn't have
the same opportunity," she said.
"They say there will never be a na
tional union in our lifetime because
growers are too rich, too powerful,
too racist â€” but that is why it is up
to us to do the right thing."
Following Huerta's remarks,
juniors Caroline Kuntz and

Gabriela Rico performed spoken
word poetry expressing the spirit
of both farm workers and the
Latino culture. The presentation
ended with the performance of
the Chicano band Quetzal, whose
lyrics commemorated the strug
gle of both ethnic minorities and
females.
"I'd like everyone to walk away
with some inspiration to be more
active in the politics of our world
and at the same time realize that
there have been others that have
fought hard to give us the oppor

tunity we have today," Pleitez
said.
Earlier this week, freshmen
Maricela Trevino and Rocio Car
denas coordinated a smaller
Chavez commemoration event at
hast Palo Alto High School during
which Stanford students per
formed and led activities.
The commemorative celebra
tion will continue on Friday with
the Fast for Life Rally, during
which students will fast and donate
skipped meals to a fund for the chil
dren of migrant farm workers.
