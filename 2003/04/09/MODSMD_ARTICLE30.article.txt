High-resolution image of the Cydonia "Face" on Mars, taken by the Mars Glob
al Surveyor on April 5, 2001. The probe has been orbiting Mars since Sept 12,
1997. The mission has investigated the surface of Mars and provided information
about the planet's atmosphere and surface composition. Similar to the Viking or
biter images acquired in 1976, the geological moieties comprising the Cydonia
"Face" have made it the subject of numerous science fiction books and movies.
