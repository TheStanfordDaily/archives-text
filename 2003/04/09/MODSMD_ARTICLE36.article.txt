# Health 101: ephedra
## 
### 
In an ever-increasing urge to become titter,
taster, and stronger, many people — ath
letes and non-athletes alike — have opted
to take all-natural supplements that will
give them the extra "edge" they crave. It is
frightening to realize, though, that these all-nat
ural supplements, many of them containing the
ingredient ephedra, are causing scores of
deaths around the globe.
And recent high-profile deaths of Baltimore
Orioles pitching prospect Steve Belcher and

Minnesota Vikings offensive
lineman Korey Stringer or the
tragic case of 16-year-old Sean
Riggins, a high-school athlete
whose death on the playing
field has been linked to
ephedra, is not enough to dis
suade people to stop taking
these supplements.
Ephedra has become so
dangerous that the U.S. Army

has banned its use and so have the NCAA,
NFL, Minor League and the International
Olympic Committee. But despite the fact that
these organizations have banned it, consump
tion still occurs behind closed doors. Studies
have shown that up to 70 percent of college
athletes and 50 percent of high-school athletes
have taken some kind of performance-enhanc
ing supplement.
"One of the reasons it is so hard to make peo
ple stop is because they think that since ephedra
is an herb then it must be safe," says Dr. Lee
Kowan from the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital.
Because of its label as an herb, ephedra is less
strictly regulated by the FDA. Ephedra is also
known as "ephedrine" and "ma huang."
Ephedra acts as a stimulant, giving the user a
massive amount of energy to enhance athletic
performance. "This, in turn, leads to an effective
fat burning mechanism," said Kowan.
But the supplement raises the body's core
temperature, which can lead to irregular heart
beat, insomnia and elevated blood pressure.
Furthermore, as a stimulant, its energy-boost
ing effects can dangerously mask signs of fa
tigue and dehydration.

Another reason it is hard to protect people
from ephedra is that many do not realize they
are taking supplements that actually contain the
substance. A recent investigation by ABC News
reported that many people have no idea that
they're taking it because it is often part of a sup
plement with limited or confusing information
on the label.
Ephedra products are often sold in health
food stores, under names such as Ripped Fuel
and CreaDrive, for bodybuilders hoping to in
crease muscle and energy and Metabolite and
Xenadrine for dieters.
Herbal ephedra is sold in about 200 unregu
lated dietary supplements. And what is dis
heartening is that research has shown that
dosage in ephedra pills often varies widely from
what is written on the label.
Furthermore, there are no warning labels on
packages about the risks associated with
ephedra. Many eager bodybuilders believe they
are safe to take any and all supplements.
Do they know that people who are pregnant
or have a history of heart disease, stroke, psy
chiatric disorders, asthma, thyroid or kidney
disease, diabetes or prior seizures should not
take ephedra under any circumstances?
Supporters of ephedra-containing supple
ments blame users for mismanagement of pills.
They say that if ephedra is taken as directed
then there is no risk to the user.
Whether this is true is yet to be determined,
but it is known that Steve Belcher took three
pills instead of the recommended two, accord
ing to the ABC report.
New York Yankees pitcher David Wells has
argued that baseball teams pressure players into
watching the scales and counting calories.
Ephedra might be seen as a quick way to lose
weight, but the risks can be fatal.
It is undeniable that a number of athletes
and coaches are concerned with obtaining the
best level of performance at any long-term or
short-term cost. However, popping pills is
never the answer. The potential irreversible
damage to body tissues and organs for that one
shot chance at impeccable performance is not
worth it.
