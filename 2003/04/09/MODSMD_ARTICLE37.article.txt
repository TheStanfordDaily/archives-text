## Venturesome students compete 
### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford will be represented again this year at the
annual National Social Venture Competition at the
Columbia School of Business, this time by a student
planning to start a microfinancing organization in
Palestine to provide economic opportunities to com
bat terrorism.
Senior Uri Pomerantz and his team Jozoor, along
with seven other national and international finalists,
will present their business plans to judges at the com
petition on April 12 for the chance to win over
$ 100,000 in seed capital.
Jozoor aims to create a non-profit microfinancing
organization to spark entrepreneurship by provid
ing loans and training to young rural males in Pales
tine, which they say is the demographic typically tar
geted for enrollment in Palestinian organizations
that finance and carry out terrorist acts.
"We are motivated by the belief that strong roots
and economic development can channel people's
anger into productivity," Pomerantz said.
Jozoor is comprised of Claremont College busi
ness student Hisham Jabi, Columbia University un
dergraduate student Bryan Berkett and Pomerantz.
The team advisers are Professor Hamid Dabashi,
head of Middle Eastern Studies at Columbia and
Nadav Morag, a member of Israeli's National Secu
rity Council.
Jozoor, as a team, has representation from both
sides of the current conflict in Israel. Pomerantz's
great-aunt was murdered in a terrorist attack last
year in Israel. Jabi, a native Palestinian, was impris
oned by Israeli troops for several months without ex
planation.
By offering opportunities toward self-improve
ment, Jozoor members said they aim to combat
hopelessness and promote economic development
to move towards peace. Another part ofjozoor's goal
is to affect public thought in the United States to in
fluence politicians and impact change in the Middle
East by providing an example of Israeli and Pales
tinian students working together to help achieve

peace.
After fundraising this year fora small pilot pro
gram budget, J ozoor's members will graduate and
begin their venture. First, they want to hire one per
son to help find budding entrepreneurs in Palestine.
Jozoor would give them people resources, training
and — once they have the necessary knowledge —
the capital needed to start their business.
This year, other finalist ventures vary from plans
to increase urban sanitary coverage in India using
advertising-based revenue to producing a chemical
to treat contaminated water. Plans are judged by
their social return on investment. Teams must in
clude a current business student but can also include
professionals, entrepreneurs and students.
year, three Stanford alumni — Xanthe Jory,
Class of 1994, Marya Gilborn, Class of 1993, and
Gabriel Esparza, Class of 1994 — were on the team
that won $25,000 for the grand prize in the medium
growth category. Their business plan, Bronx Char
ter School for the Arts, is a public elementary school
founded on the principle that arts education is a cat
alyst for academic and social success of students. Slat
ed to open next September, the school plans to serve
as a model that encourages reform and innovation in
the broader public school system.
For the past two years, Kimberly Smith, who
graduated from the Stanford Graduate School of
Business, has participated as a judge of the competi
tion. Smith is the founding president of New Schools
Venture Fund, and at Stanford she was co-president
of the Entrepreneur Club.
Jed Emerson, a lecturer in business at the Busi
ness School and a senior fellow the Hewlett Founda
tion, also has participated as a judge in the past.
The competition was started in 1999 at the Haas
School of Business at UC-Berkeley. It then part
nered with Columbia Business School and The
Goldman Sachs Foundation, bringing together the
academic and financial worlds to support the cre
ation of social ventures. The organizers aim to pro
vide a national forum for entrepreneurs to present
their plans and for investors to support innovative
social ventures, according to their Web site.
