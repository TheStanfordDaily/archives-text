Though they might be seen as ASSU insiders, ex
ecutive office candidates junior Nadiya Figueroa and
sophomore Joey Natoli say that their campaign is cer
tainly not limited by their ASSU experience.
"I was worried about the in-the-box thinking,
sort of if we'll be trapped in the ASSU mentality, so
we want to make sure we include many, many
group leaders," said Natoli, the vice-presidential
candidate. "We'll ensure that this in-the-box think
ing won't be possible. We'll be constantly looking
for feedback."
Figueroa, the presidential candidate, added, "And
having a really diverse cabinet of people we'd pull in
from outside of the ASSU."
Figueroa noted, however, that their ASSU experi
ence — Figueroa having served as ASSU Nomina
tions Commission chair and Natoli having served as a
senator and an executive aide — should "appeal to
voters."
"In one sense, it's necessary to have experience,"
she said. "We spoke at length with Monica [Hene
stroza] and Matt [Brewer] about this, and Monica had
not had experience, and she would say there's a learn
ing curve."
Besides her work with the ASSU, Figueroa also has
been involved with the Black Community Student
Center initiative, the creation of the cultural aware
ness adviser residential staff position, the Caribbean
Students Association and the Kuumba dance ensem
ble. Natoli is currently serving as the president of the
Stanford News Readership Program.
Both said that they would be willing to devote the
necessary time to the position if elected.
"We both believe we need to fully commit our
selves to the job," Natoli said.
"Hopefully I'll still be able to dance, but I'm will
ing to throw it out if I have to," Figueroa said.
As far as specific issues, Figueroa and Natoli hope
to address student space, diversity issues, cost-of
living, the arts community and student groups as a
whole. Another major goal, as Natoli said, is "bring
ing historically uninvolved communities into the
ASSU, such as the Greek community, art communi

ty, athletic community, ethnic communities and
frosh."
"I think our slogan relatively well sums up how we
feel, it's empowering student voice," he said.
Adding more detail, Figueroa cited the idea of cre
ating "separate endowments for community centers
and seeking funding from alumni of color."
She also discussed forming a coalition of arts
groups to give them more collective power.
When asked to describe their platform in a few
words, Figueroa and Natoli said that it's genuine,
holistic, ambitious and well-researched.
"All of our Stanford experiences are sort of built
into our platform," Figueroa said.
Another key characteristic they cited was vision.
"We're sort of looking towards the long-term," Na
toli said. "We'd work on sort of setting into the ASSU
culture that we're not looking in our term, we're look
ing five, 10 years out."
"There's a continuity we're trying to achieve,"
Figueroa said.
As far as her leadership style, Figueroa said she
tries to be personable.
"I think it's important that anyone who has an
issue would be able to approach me and say, 'Nadiya,
I don't even know who you are but I want to talk to
you,' " she said.
Though Figueroa and Natoli come from some
what different backgrounds, they see that as a
strength.
"Our different experiences sort of help comple
ment one another," Natoli said.
