# Perry, Shin discuss N. Korea
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the United States' foreign policy
is not currently focused on North Korea, it
certainly is on the minds of Stanford students,
who packed the Oak Room in Tresidder last
night fora panel discussion by William Ferry,
former secretary of defense, and Gi-Wook
Shin, professor of sociology and head of the
Asia / Pacific Research Center. The talk, enti
tled "What about North Korea?" and hosted
by Bursting the Bubble, emphasized the im
mediacy of the threat posed by North Korea.
"The continuation of North Korea's pluto
nium and uranium programs is the most seri
ous problem of nuclear proliferation that the
world faces today," said Perry, a professor of
management science and engineering. "This
is a nightmare scenario, but it is not an impos
sible scenario.
"North Korea has wanted nuclear
weapons for several decades and we have pre
vented that desire by using a policy of carrots
and sticks," said Perry, who said that the
biggest threat was the possibility of North
Korea selling nuclear arms to terrorists or
other nations. Perry believes North Korea will
be able to make five such weapons by the end
of this summer.
"If this threat of nuclear proliferation is so
imminent and so serious, then why has it been
so difficult to develop a serious diplomatic
structure?" he asked.
Perry addressed this question by stating
that "unilateral act ion on behalf of the United

States is not a possibility" and that the United
States would have to work with South Korea,
Japan and China in order to reach a solution.
Cooperation, however, has not been forth
coming for several reasons, including the
United States' current position in Iraq, the
newly elected administration in South Korea
and China's fundamental reluctance to do
any "heavy lifting" on the issue, Perry said.
"The trouble with allies," he said, quoting
from Winston Churchill, "is that they some
times have ideas of their own."
Perry argued that despite the difficulties of
diplomacy, effective negotiation would be
able to manage the nuclear crisis in North
Korea and that military action would not be
necessary. When asked by a student, he said
that he never regrets the Clinton administra
tion's decision to not use military force while
he was secretary of defense during the nu
clear crisis with North Korea in June 1994.
"I spent three days and nights working out
war plans," Perry said. "In all the variations
we won, but in each one hundreds of thou
sands were killed. And eventually, North
Korea would be decimated . .. The North
Koreans would fight to the death because it's
the last country in the world where the people
know only what the government tells them.
They have only government newspapers,
government radios and government televi
sion . . . Ideology is drummed into them in
ways that none of us could even begin to imag
ine."
To illustrate his point, he related an anec
dote from an official visit he made to North

Korea during the 19905. His envoy brought
hospital supplies to donate to a city hospital.
When he delivered the supplies, a grateful
nurse asked him it he wanted to visit the chil
dren. She warned that when she told the chil
dren he was coming, their response was, "Is
he here to kill us?"

William Perry, former U.S. Secretary of De
fense under President Clinton, addresses a
packed house last night at the latest "Bursting
the Bubble" panel, on North Korea.
Shin indicated, however, that
the leadership of Kim Jong-Il in
North Korea is comparatively
less ideological than Saddam
Hussein's leadership in Iraq. He
said that this was a fundamental
disparity that shaped the differ
ences between U.S. policy with
North Korea and U.S. policy with
Iraq.
"For Kim-Jong, I think survival
is a primary goal and that makes
him more prone to outside pres
sure and more willing to compro

mise with the United States," Shin
said.
"We chose to do a panel on
North Korea because we feel that,
with all the coverage of the war in
Iraq, the pressing crisis of North
Korea is not given proper atten
tion," said organizer Jenny Tolan,
a sophomore.
"These talks also give students a
different forum for learning about
current events," said Thomas Sisk,
a first-year graduate student at the
Center for East Asian Studies.
"You can interact, ask your own
questions and hear the give and
take. It diversifies your own point
of view. The worst thing you can
do is to think that you know it all."
