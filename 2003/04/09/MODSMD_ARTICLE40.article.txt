Despite common student perception, ASSU execu
tive office candidates junior Steve Yelderman and ju
nior Charlie Stockman, want voters to know that they
are not running as the traditional Chaparral candi
dates.
"We're definitely not on the Chappie slate, and our
relationship with the Chappie is actually very loose,"
Yelderman said. "This year since there isn't [a Chappie
slate]; a lot of people are trying to figure out who it is. I
don't know why people don't think it's Joey and
Nadiya."
As to their relative inexperience with ASSU posi
tions, Yelderman said he sees it as a plus.
"We're not outside of the ASSU in the sense that we
don't know what we're doing or we don't have leader
ship experience," he said. "I think we are outside in the
sense that the issues we hope to address are outside of
what the ASSU normally does. Promulgation of the
same ASSU culture isn't necessarily something we're
committed to doing. In fact we'd like to see change in
the ASSU."
As far as experience relevant to the ASSU presiden
cy, Yelderman cited his experience on University com
mittees, his resident assistant position in Soto and his
work as ASSU publications director.
Stockman said that his most relevant experience
was with the alcohol policy, as he was suspended fresh
man year. He also did mention involvement in activi
ties, including the Theta Delta Chi fraternity.
"I think I'm an active member of the community,"
Stockman said. "I play for the lacrosse team. I've got an
ASSU shirt."
Both said they would make the executive office a
priority if elected.
"If we get elected, I don't think we plan on hav
ing any other time commitments," Yelderman said.
"Obviously this is the most important thing, and if
given the opportunity we'd do it â€” but that doesn't
mean if we lose we're going to sit around and cry all
year."
In terms of specific issues, Yelderman and Stock
man hope to address a "general crackdown on stu
dent culture," involving alcohol policy, student space

and diversity.
"One of [my issues] is changing the alcohol policy on
campus, and how they treat students," Stockman said.
"My belief is that people who got into this school are
pretty responsible, pretty hardworking and don't need
to be harassed on weekends. The enforcement of bike
laws would fall under that, too."
Stockman said his ultimate goal "is to lower the
drinking age to 18 on campus."
"You've got to have hopes," he said. "You can't just
aim for the ASSU presidency and vice presidency, take
your stipend and walk away."
"Another part of that is loosening the rules on fra
ternities," Yelderman said.
Yelderman also noted that they were against the
war in Iraq, focused on student space and supportive
of affirmative action.
Stockman highlighted transportation issues.
"My aim is to use ASSU funds to purchase a large
fleet of suped up golf carts, equipped with minibars,"
Stockman said. "They'll be yellow, so you wouldn't mis
take them."
"It'd be something of a pilot program at first, and
we'd have to talk about the minibars," Yelderman said.
Yelderman and Stockman have known each other
since freshman year, and think together they "balance
out our appeal to students."
"I think it's important for people to understand that
this is an election, and it's unusual that we have two
slates running, and I think it's important for students
to think about what message they want to send the
campus and send to the world," Yelderman said. "This
is an opportunity for change."
