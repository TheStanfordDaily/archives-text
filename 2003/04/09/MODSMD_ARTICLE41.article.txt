# Henestroza, Rodriguez reflect on year
## 
### 
The Daily asked ASSU President
Monica Henestroza and ASSU Vice
President Nick Rodriguez to answer
several questions about their work over
the past year and what challenges they
see ahead for the ASSU.
The Daily: What do you see as
your primary achievements as
ASSU president and vice presi
dent?
Monica Henestroza: I see my
top two achievements as gaining
student voice in the University
budget process and improving
ASSU-Board of Trustee rela
tions.
The ASSU had a tendency to
defensively articulate and fight
for student interests with the ad
ministration. This year, I felt it
was important to be proactive;
especially given the University
wide budget cuts, it was critical
that student representation was
incorporated early on in the
process ... I think that as a re
sult of our involvement, the bud
get cuts will be in better accor
dance with student interests and
priorities.
While overall, I feel the ASSU
was able to develop stronger
working relations with adminis
trators — from the University
president and provost to the fac
ulty senators — I take particular
pride in the relationship we were
able to cultivate with the Board of
Trustees.
Nick Rodriguez: I think that
our greatest achievement was
our commitment to not just ad
minister the ASSU, but to create
new initiatives in response to
student need. You saw it in the
Get Out the Vote Campaign, in
our support of the Innovative
Student Information Services
(ISIS) project and in our cre
ation of the ASSU Arts Grant
Program.
We also focused on an impor
tant theme during our year: the

welfare, in both monetary and
non-monetary terms, of all stu
dents and student groups. We
managed to remove the 11 per
cent surcharge that is charged to
student groups that use Univer
sity services, we negotiated for
University funding of a Satur
day night Marguerite shuttle to
replace the lost weekend Cal
train service, and we managed
to gather institutional momen
tum behind a long-term initia
tive to standardize and modern
ize the space reservation
process.
Finally, we lent secondary
support to critical campaigns
run by other student groups: we
pushed fora larger role for stu
dents in the development of a
University living wage policy
and we signed on to the (condi
tionally) successful campaign for
a larger BCSC.
TD: What did you find to be
the hardest part of your job?
MH: Without a doubt the
hardest part of being ASSU
president has been negotiating
the diverse interests of students
while still advocating on issues
that are meaningful and im
pactful.
NR: The hardest part of my
job was negotiating the complex
University environment. With
such a decentralized set of deci
sion-makers that control a num
ber of variables that students care
about, it can be difficult and dis
heartening to try to effect change
at the University level.
TD: What do you think are the
most pressing issues facing stu
dents going into next year?
MH: While there are a wide
range of issues facing students,
the two issues I see as being es
pecially important next year are
student space and student
voice.

NR: Continued lack of recog
nition of students as key stake
holders in decision-making. I
am not saying that University
administrators disrespect stu
dents; however, the knee-jerk
tendency of many administra
tors to simply say "no" when an
idea is proposed to provide stu
dent feedback on an important
University decision is disheart
ening. I think that there is a
communication divide that
makes it difficult for administra
tors to understand exactly what
students want.
TD: What did you hope to ac
complish but found you were not
able to? Why were these things
difficult to accomplish?
MH: Improving communica
tion with the student body, specif
ically by publicizing ASSU re
sources. I think the challenge lies
in balancing conducting effective
advocacy work and relaying to
students the fruits of that work.
NR: Though we made great
strides on cost-of-living issues
such as laundry and printing, re
call that our campaign also
promised to look into the activi
ties of local campus monopolies
like the Bookstore and Bon Ap
petit. Efforts at negotiating with
those businesses have had limit
ed success, largely because we
were dealing with private corpo
rations and, lacking pressure
from the University, the actual
client, they saw no reason to talk
to us.
If next year's executive takes
this issue up, perhaps a harder
nosed approach is necessary to
deal with these people.
TD: Having done the job,
what do you believe are the most
important responsibilities of the
ASSU president and vice presi
dent?
MH: As the chief executive of

the association, the ASSU presi
dent is charged with overseeing
all association functions; I be
lieve that the most important
quality required of a president is
the ability to coordinate their
many obligations and responsi
bilities.
NR: I believe that the most im
portant responsibilities of the
president and vice president are
to serve as a mouthpiece for stu
dent needs and opinions both for
the ASSU as an organization and
on behalf of students at the Uni
versity level.
Keeping a finger on the pulse
of constituent thoughts and ideas,
and making your best effort to re
spond in kind, are qualities that
any good leader should have —
especially those leaders who
head up Stanford's student gov
ernment.
TD: Do you have any final re
flections as you leave office? What
would your outgoing message be
to students?
MH: Working with so many
students and administrators to
provide for students' meaningful
participation in the governance
of the University has been a re
energizing experience that firmly
established my commitment to
the University ... it truly has
been a humbling and inspiring
experience. To anyone who
wants to make change or improve
our University, 1 highly encour
age you to consider working with
the ASSU.
NR: Remember that the ASSU
is as powerful and as relevant as
you make it. Every executive does
his or her best for students, but in
order for the ASSU's work to
truly benefit people, you must be
willing to take advantage of and
buy into the potential resources
made available by the existence of
an institutionalized representa
tive for students.
