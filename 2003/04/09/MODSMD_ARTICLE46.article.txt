# Special-fee rankings explained
## 
### 
Newspapers nationwide often provide
election recommendations to voters. For
the past 15 years, The Stanford Daily has
endorsed groups that apply for special-fee re
quests in the ASSU elections. The purpose of
this special section is to help the student body
make informed voting decisions about the 61
groups applying for special fees this year. In
the past week, members of The Stanford Daily
editorial board sat down with representatives

from all those groups for
10-minute interviews. We
asked each organization
why they were applying for
the special fee. We asked
them what the money
would help fund, and we
asked them how the stu
dent body as a whole would
benefit from the funding.
Overall, we were im
pressed by the level of en
thusiasm that each of the
groups demonstrated.
After the interviews, we
were convinced that almost
all of the groups you will find
listed on the following pages
are important to Stanford.
They add to the atmosphere
of intellectual vitality that
should be encouraged on a
college campus. And they
contribute to the well-being
of our student body.
Our endorsements are
based on the criteria set

forth by the ASSU in determining whether or
not a group should receive special-fee funds
from the entire student body. After all, that is the
decision students are asked to make.
The ASSU Constitution writes: "Special Fees
shall be sought by student organizations to cover
their organizational and basic programming ex
penses."
The Daily has also decided that since the en
tire student body pays for an approved special
fee request, we would only endorse organiza
tions that are open to and benefit a large portion
of the student body.
Last year, The Daily rated each group with a
number ranging from one to three. But we felt
such a system may not live up to it potential in
helping our readers determine whether they
should vote for or against a group — especially
since many groups received a rating of "2."
This year, we are using a more straightfor
ward system. Groups received either a YES en
dorsement, a NO or a MAYBE. Here is what
each rating means:
•YES: We endorse the group's ASSU spe
cial-fee request. The group has fulfilled many

of its goals for the current year and is serious
about its plans for the future. Finally, the orga
nization impacts a substantial number of Stan
ford students.
• MAYBE: We cannot endorse the group's re
quest, although we feel that the group should re
ceive some funds and would use some of its spe
cial fee well. In many instances, some items on
the group's budget are allocated to serve a few
students while others could serve a larger com-

munity. Since the decision
fell between the two ex
tremes, we encourage voters
to pay particular attention to
these groups in arriving at a
voting decision.
• NO: We do not en
dorse the group's special
fee request. This rating does
not mean that the group
does not make valuable con
tributions to the Stanford
community. Rather, we be
lieve that the group influ
ences too few students to ask
fora special fee from all stu
dents. Furthermore, we be
lieve these groups can better
locate alternative sources of
revenue.
The board has tried to in
clude as much information as
possible in die explanation of
its endorsements. The Daily
encourages all students to
check the Election Handbook
online (http://elections.stan-

ford.edu) and read each group's statement and
budget. Our endorsements are in no way absolute
— students should vote in the way that they feel will
l>est meet their needs at Stanford. But we hope that
this section will help inform students of those needs.
Some final notes:
Annual cost per student is indicated in paren
theses under the group's gross fee request
amount. The per capita amounts are taken di
rectly from the ASSU Election Handbook. A "B"
prior to the amount indicates the fee will be as
sessed to both the undergraduate and graduate
students; a "U" indicates the fee will be assessed
to undergraduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its endorse
ments from groups or students. Letters will be
published tomorrow and Thursday at the dis
cretion of the opinions editors and can be edited
for length and / or content. Only those letters re
ceived by 3 p.m. today will be considered for
publication tomorrow. Letters for Friday publi
cation must be received by 3 p.m. tomorrow.
Please submit letters via e-mail addressed to
letters@daily.stanford.edu.
