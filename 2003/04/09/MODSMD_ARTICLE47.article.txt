# SPECIAL FEE ENDORSEMENTS
## 2003 ELECTIONS 
### 
Graduate & Undergraduate
ASSU LEGAL $102,260
COUNSELING (B $8.06)
YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free,
useful legal assistance to all Stanford stu
dents. In particular, the service is widely
used by graduate students. Although the
attorneys do not represent students in
court, they offer advice on all kinds of
cases. Attorneys are on call seven days a
week and available for consultation two af
ternoons a week. The majority of the spe
cial fee goes toward labor fees.
ASSU SPEAKERS $149,042
BUREAU (B $11.75)
YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau brings a va
riety of highly esteemed speakers to
campus each year. This year's speakers
have included playwright Eve Ensler,
President and Publisher of Ihe New
York Times Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak. The Bureau's events are open to
all students, faculty and the community
at large, and the Bureau prioritizes in
making its events free so that all students
may attend. The majority of its budget
comes from special fees, which cover
speakers' honoraria and travel expens
es, as well as event advertising. We sup
port the Speakers Bureau's bid for spe
cial fees, given its demonstrated ability
to provide quality events for the entire
student body.

CLUB SPORTS $200,659.80
(B $15.82)
YES
Club Sports gives students who are not
varsity athletes the opportunity to partic
ipate in competitive sports. There are ap
proximately 926 students involved in
Club Sports; this year there are 15 teams,
and next year there will be 17 teams. It is
beneficial for teams to be a part of Club
Sports because Club Sports has priority,
after varsity teams, in reserving practice
space and equipment use. The majority
of the special fee goes toward training
material, equipment, facilities rental and
travel.
INNOVATIVE $38,720
STUDENT (B $3.05)
INFORMATION
SERVICES
NO
Innovative Student Information Services
was organized to publicize information
on the events throughout the Stanford
community through campus-wide infor
mation screens and an events Web site,
with the ultimate aim of replacing flier
ing. ISIS will use its special fees to install
plasma screen kiosks and pay for other
development/start-up costs. While ISIS
has the potential to evolve into a success
ful community resource, it is more likely
to supplement, rather than replace, flier
ing and e-mail announcements. In such a
case ISIS may not resolve the problem of
publicity, but merely contribute to re
dundancy.

KZSU $94,202
(B $7.43)
YES
KZSU is Stanford's noncommercial radio sta
tion. It gives students the opportunity to get
involved in radio broadcasting. For those who
have no prior experience, KZSU offers a DJ
training class each quarter. Currently, there
are about 35 students who are DJs. The ma
jority of the special fee goes toward operating
expenses — including funds for equipment
and hiring a part-time chief engineer — and
some of the spec ial fee is used for on-campus
events that are open to the public, such as
CoHo Nights and Hip-Hop Night. As a non
commercial radio station, KZSU cannot ad
vertise and depends heavily on special fees,
and we support its special fee request.
SCBN $21,477.12
(B $1.69)
MAYBE
SCBN could be an effective outlet for stu
dents interested in television broadcasting,
but the organization currently broadcasts
only two shows regularly — and three oth
ers that don't air as frequently. More than
half of the special-fee request is allocated to
the Teleflicks program, which is popular
among students. However, SCBN should
expand its menu of original programming.
STANFORD $22,380
CHAMBER (B $1.76)
CHORALE
MAYBE

The Stanford Chamber Chorale is the De
partment of Music's premiere choral en
semble. This year it requests fees to subsi
dize its 2003-04 tour to Hawaii, where it
will give concerts and master classes and try
to build Stanford's music reputation.
While the group itself only incorporates 25
students, the Chorale makes a concerted
effort to involve the student body at large
by performing at events such as Com
mencement. An Art Affair and Community
Day. We appreciate the Chorale's efforts to
be visible and involved in campus life, but
we have reservations about its use of special
fees for touring, given such tours' indirect
benefits to the student body.
STANFORD $915,168
CONCERT (B $7.50)
NETWORK (SCN)
YES
The Stanford Concert Network is a stu
dent-run organization that brings musi
cians and performing groups to campus.
Special fees provide for the half of SCN's
budget that is not covered by ticket sales.
SCN successfully manages to bring several
well-known groups to campus each year.
SCN brought Nappy Roots this past
November and will bring They Might Be
Giants with Dave Eggers in April. SCN also
sponsors other on-campus events, such as
the CoHo series, which allows smaller, up
and-coming groups the opportunity to per
form. SCN has shown that it appeals to the
general student body and that it uses its re
sources responsibly.
STANFORD NEWS $64,150
READERSHIP (B $5.06)
PROGRAM

NO RATING
The News Readership program brings
copies of The San Jose Mercury News, The
New York Times and The Stanford Daily to
bins around campus. Now in its second
year, the news readership service will ex
pand to bring free newspapers to graduate
students. The program has also brought
speakers to campus this year, including
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., President and Pub
lisher of The New York Times.
STUDENT ~536,258
ORGANIZING (B $2.86)
COMMITTEE
FOR THE ARTS (SOCA)
YES
In promoting activities of the arts commu
nity at Stanford, the Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts helps to increase
the visibility and awareness of a much-ne
glected community on campus. Its largest

event, An Art Affair, brings together the vi
sual arts, dance, music and spoken word,
and even gourmet food in a well-attended
celebration in White Plaza. The organiza
tion also offers arts-focused excursions into
San Francisco, "SOCA in the city," dorm
programs related to the arts, "SOCA to go"
and much more. As its program continues
to expand so has its budget and its special
fees request; this year's request is more than
double last year's. However, as the largest
and practically only student organization
devoted solely to the promotion of the arts,
SOCA's special fee request is reasonable
and should be granted.
STUDENT $26,250
INITIATED (B $2.07)
COURSES (SIC)
MAYBE
In concept, Student Initiated Courses is a
good idea. Students should be able to take
classes on topics not offered within the Uni
versity curriculum. But in practice, this idea
has not been executed well enough. The
classes need to be better organized and
publicized to attract more than 10 to 15 stu
dents each. Not a lot of the curriculum has
appealed to graduate students so far. And,
about one-fifth of the special-fee funding
would go to the salaries of the organizers —
a cost that could be minimized. Perhaps
SIC could be better supported by individu
al University departments. For these rea
sons, we believe that students should exam
ine this request carefully.
THE STANFORD $50,200
DAILY (B $3.96)
NO RATING
The Stanford Daily is an independent, non
profit, student-run newspaper that is the
primary means of communication to the
24,000 members of the Stanford communi
ty. The Daily requests a special fee this year
only to reduce the direct cost of providing
the paper to students — printing and dis
tribution costs. No other production, over
head or administrative cost is included in
The Daily's special fee aside from printing
and delivery.
Undergraduate
ASIAN $36,644.25
AMERICAN (U $5.78)
STUDENTS
ASSOCIATION (AASA)
YES
An umbrella group for most of the Asian-
American student groups on campus,
AASA provides funding for the activities
of its individual affiliate groups, while
sponsoring its own events such as Listen
to the Silence, a conference on Asian-
American issues. One of Stanford's
largest student organizations, AASA has
done an admirable job of moderating its
special-fee request through outside
fundraising efforts and notably so in
comparison to similarly sized umbrella
groups.
ALTERNATIVE $24,302
SPRING (U $3.84)
BREAK (ASB)
YES
Providing students with the chance to ex
perience a service-oriented spring break,
Alternative Spring Break is a much-need
ed program for the busy, socially aware
Stanford student body. Scheduling local
and national trips focusing on issues such
as homelessness and AIDS, ASB provides
invaluable learning opportunities to in
terested students. ASB even supplies fi
nancial assistance to those who qualify. In
response to burgeoning student interest
this year, ASB has increased its budget re
quest to provide an increased number
and variety of trips, but has responsibly
cut back its spending in other areas, such
as marketing.
ASIA $29,000
TECHNOLOGY (U $4.58)
INITIATIVE (ATI) /
ASIA-PACIFIC
STUDENT
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
SOCIETY (ASES)
MAYBE
This is the first year that ASES and ATI —
two organizations focused on technology
and business opportunities in Asia —
have asked fora special fee under one

budget. ATI concentrates on an intern
ship program for students in cities such as
Shanghai, Tokyo, Bangalore and Hong
Kong during the summer and offers ad
mitted students a series of seminars and
workshops to prepare for the internship
experience. ASES is open to all students
interested and offers projects, confer
ences, mentorship programs and a re
sume book to introduce students to the
business, technology and entrepreneur
ship sectors. While these groups offer ex
cellent resources and educational oppor
tunities in fields that many Stanford stu
dents find very relevant, ATI serves only a
limited portion of the student population.
ASSUONLINE $T17600
COURSE GUIDE (U $1.74)
NO
The ASSU Online Course Guide is sup
posed to provide comments and evalua
tions acquired from past students on
nearly all of the classes offered at Stan
ford. The evaluations are released one to
two quarters after the completion of the
class. Over 70 percent of the special fee is
spent on salaries for the four to eight tem
porary student employees who type up
the student comments onto the Web site.
The special fee could be better spent for
another cause, and students who wish to
learn about specific classes can consult
peer academic advisors, head peer aca
demic coordinators or upperclassmen.
BARRIO $25,372.26
ASSISTANCE (U $4.00)
YES
Barrio .Assistance pairs Stanford students
with elementary and junior high school
students from East Palo Alto, Menlo Park
and Redwood City for tutoring, mentor
ing, leadership training and cultural
awareness. There are approximately 90
Stanford students who participate in Bar
rio Assistance. Now in its 32nd year on
campus, Barrio Assistance is requesting
$600 more this year than last year because
of increases in fuel costs and printing costs.
BLACK $29,673
STUDENT (U54.68)
UNION
(BSU)
YES
The Black Student Union is a cultural orga
nization dedicated to developing awareness
of black culture and issues. The programs
and events sponsored by the BSU serve not
only the approximately 1,000 black under
graduate and graduate students but also the
Stanford community at large. Many annual
events, such as Black Liberation Month, are
open to the entire Stanford community, and
several events reach communities outside of
Stanford. The Community Development
Tour allows students to reach out to the
black community in East Palo Alto, and the
Soul Food Dinner allows both students and
parents to celebrate the past, present and fu
ture of black culture. The majority of the
special fee goes toward providing facilities
and programming events sponsored by the
BSU.
CARDINAL $29,040
BALLET (U $4.58)
NO
Cardinal Ballet is trying to increase its
presence early next year with a new show
in the Roble Dance Studio. The organiza
tion wants the event to be free. It also hosts
the anntial "Urban Nights" dance show,
which brings together smaller dance
groups fora high-budget show that none
could afford on its own. We believe that
the organization should increase the ticket
prices of this show to pay for its expenses
and not ask fora special fee.
EVERYDAY $18,107.45
PEOPLE (U $2.86)
MAYBE
Everyday People is an a cappella ensem
ble of 16 to 20 members. Though in its
eighth year at Stanford, this is the first
year Everyday People has requested spe
cial fees. Increased recording costs have
forced Everyday People to take on debt in
order to support its programming, which
includes free concerts and community
outreach. Everyday People performed
twice this year at Stanford and is seeking
special fees in order to continue to its tra
dition of offering free concerts both on
and off campus. But a large portion of the
special fee will go toward financing the
group's CD recording, which students
may not want to pay for.

FORUM FOR $43,225
AMERICAN / (U $6.82)
CHINESE EXCHANGE AT
STANFORD (FACES)
NO
The Forum for American / Chinese Ex
change at Stanford is a student-run orga
nization that seeks to foster meaningful
dialogue among Chinese and American
students, scholars and leaders. This is its
first year applying for special fees. The
majority of the special fee will go toward
an honorarium fora keynote speaker for
its spring conference. While FACES is re
sponsible in asking for funds only to cover
costs for the conference, which will be
open to all students, the high cost of
bringing one keynote speaker does not
warrant a special fee.
INTERNATIONAL $11,414
UNDERGRADUATE (U $1.80)
COMMUNITY (lUC)
MAYBE
The International Undergraduate
Community at Stanford runs Interna
tional Orientation for incoming inter
national freshmen two days before
Freshman Orientation and also orga
nizes a series of gatherings including
catered dinners and lunches through
out the year to establish a community
spirit among international students at
Stanford. The organization also plans
a few off-campus retreats for interna
tional students. The International
Orientation is a well-planned program
to introduce foreign students to life in
the United States and to help students
settle into Stanford life. However, the
organization does not serve the major
ity of the student population: Interna
tional students make up less than 5
percent of the undergraduate popula
tion, and nearly half of the budget
goes for the food at the gatherings.
Thus, while the intentions of the com
munity are noble, they should seek al
ternate sources of funding for their
catered events.
KIDS WITH $8,343
DREAMS (U $1.32)
YES
Kids with Dreams is a successfully managed
volunteer group that serves both the Stan
ford community through a disability aware
ness class and the outside community
through volunteer-run rehabilitation and
special education programs for children
with mental disabilities in off-campus loca
tions. The group also organizes toy drives,
craft projects and a festival showcasing
works by disabled artists. The group is cur
rently planning to organize a disability
awareness team that will inform middle
school students about children and adults
with disabilities. We fully support Kids with
Dreams because the many activities and
programs planned and run by the group
fill a niche in the community without un
necessary costs. The organization has suc
cessfully streamlined its budget and has cut
costs in several areas, reducing their spe
cial-fee request from last year.
MARIACHI $13,110
CARDENAL (U $2.07)
DE STANFORD
MAYBE
Mariachi Cardenal performs at many on
campus events, including Admit Week
end, Parents Weekend and, this year, the
"Books Not Bombs" strike. There are
about 15 student performers, most of
whom are undergraduates. The majority
of the special fee goes toward funding the
1-unit class, Music 157: Mariachi Ensem
ble. Offered each quarter, the class is open
to everyone at Stanford. On average, 20 to
30 students enroll each quarter. Mariachi
Cardenal also uses a portion of the special
fee to send its members to the annual
Mariachi International Conference,
where group members perform and at
tend workshops. The special fee would re
duce the number of off-campus, revenue
producing performances Mariachi Car
denal holds, and it would allow the group
to perform, free of charge or at a dis
counted rate, more often on campus for
the Stanford community. However, Mari
achi Cardenal only directly benefits a
handful of students — those who are en
rolled in Music 157 and those in the
group.
MASQUE $6,135
MAGAZINE (U $0.97)
YES

Masque Magazine was created in 1996, in
response to a series of homophobic hate
crimes that were committed 011 campus.
This award-winning literary and visual arts
publication not only serves the University's
gay, lesbian, bisexual and trangendered
communities at Stanford, but also repre
sents those communities to the rest of the
campus. Last year, its special fee request —
which only covered printing costs — was
not approved. Since then, Masque has re
lied on funding from outside sources. But
this is not a viable long-term option to sup
port this necessary publication, and we
urge students not to let this magazine dis
appear.
______ $40,530
(U $6.40)
YES
MEChA sponsors and subsidizes numerous
on-campus events, including Cesar Chavez
Day, the La Raza Day conference, Cinco de
Mayo, Los Posadas, the Latino / Chicano
Graduation and a pre-medical student con
ference. MEChA has successfully spun off
and funded numerous groups on campus,
and works closely with SOCC and El Cen
tra Chicano. MEChA has approximately
200 members, and another 100 students
are affiliated with MEChA through the var
ious Latino / Chicano student groups that
are a part of MEChA. MEChA provides an
important ethnic and community service to
many students. MEChA is requesting
$2,240 more this year than it did last year
because of reduced corporate 112 unding.
MUSLIM $9,486.42
STUDENTS (U $1.50)
AWARENESS
NETWORK (MSAN)
YES
With nearly 30 active members, the Mus
lim Students Awareness Network is a non
religious cultural organization that seeks
to introduce Stanford students to the cul
tural aspects of Islam. MSAN hosts speak
ers, conducts Islam Awareness Week and
offers a number of cultural activities. Next
year, MSAN plans to offer more pro
grams, including inviting more guest
speakers and hosting a Ramadan dinner.
MSAN provides many services for stu
dents with a well-managed budget. MSAN
is requesting $600 less this year compared
to last year.
PROJECT $6,737.70
MOTIVATION (U $1.06)
YES
Project Motivation hosts on-campus pro
gramming for California high school stu
dents from low socioeconomic back
grounds. The group offers workshops and
panel discussions that often feature guest
speakers, and gives assistance in applying to
and preparing for college. Project Motiva
tion participants receive one-on-one atten
tion from members, who provide a re
source for secondary students who would
not otherwise receive college preparatory
assistance. Project Motivation hosts an aver
age of two visits per week, with groups usu
ally consisting of no more than 40 high
school students. Anywhere from 30 to 100
Stanford students may participate in a visit.
SALSA! $18,400
(U $2.90)
NO
Salsa! provides free dorm and dance par
ties for Stanford students. Fora fee, the
group provides workshops and perfor
mances to Stanford and the local commu
nities at large. With a part of its special fee,
the group hopes to provide workshops to
students free of charge, while still charg
ing a fee for non-Stanford groups. How
ever, one-third of the special fee will be
used for the performance costumes and
Salsa Congress registration fees for five
couples. Another one-third will be used to
hire an instructor specializing in a specific
"East Coast" salsa genre. The bulk of the
special fee will not benefit a sizeable por
tion of the student body, and the group
should find other means of raising fund.
SEXUAL HEALTH $13,675
PEER RESOURCE (U52.16)
CENTER (SHPRC)
YES
Known for providing 12 free condoms
per quarter to any Stanford student, the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center also
provides free counseling, houses an up
to-date library on sexual health literature

and sells additional contraceptives at
wholesale cost. The largest portion of the
organization's budget is devoted to main
taining its popular free condom program
and educational services, which necessar
ily promote the health of the Stanford
community as a whole.
SOCIETY FOR $47670
INTERNATIONAL (U $0.74)
AFFAIRS AT
STANFORD (SIAS)
YES
The Society for International Affairs at
Stanford has two main components. First, it
sponsors Stanford's Model United Nations
team, which consists of approximately 20 to
25 students. A significant portion of the spe
cial fee goes toward sending the Model
U.N. team to local and national competi
tions. Second, SIAS sponsors on-campus
speaker events. The group organized this
week a panel discussion on North Korea;
one of the speakers is a member from the
South Korean consulate. SIAS serves both
an interest-specific group at Stanford and
the larger community as a whole. The
amount request from special fee is a rela
tively small portion of the group's predict
ed expenses.
STANFORD $10,380
AFRICAN (U $1.64)
STUDENTS'
ASSOCIATION
MAYBE
The Stanford African Students' Associa
tion has done an admirable job of finding
external methods of funding in the past.
This year is the first year in which the
group is asking for a special fee. Most of
the request would go to paying for Africa
Week, which is a week-long cultural event
that everyone can attend for free. We do,
however, wish the organization wasn't ask
ing for the special-fee to cover the expens
es of a business conference at Harvard that
10 of its members attend each year.
STANFORD $7,475.58
ALLIANCE FOR (U $1.18)
SERVICE THROUGH
THE ARTS (SASTA)
MAYBE
An umbrella group for five organizations,
SASTA links the Stanford art and perfor
mance arts communities to local schools
through community service programs.
For all of the services that SASTA offers —
from ballet programs to music programs
for underprivileged children — the bud
get is reasonable and well-managed. All of
the students working in the SASTA pro
grams are volunteers, so nearly all of the
special-fee request is used for transporta
tion expenses. Other expenses include art
or music supplies for the programs. At a
time when many schools are cutting back
on music, theater and art programs, stu
dents should support SASTA in order to
help fill the gap in creative and artistic ed
ucation of Bay Area students.
STANFORD $36,035
AMERICAN (U $5.69)
INDIAN
ORGANIZATION (SAIO)
YES
With over 200 members, The Stanford
American Indian Organization is the orga
nizer and a major financial supporter of the
Stanford Powwow — one of the largest and
most successful gatherings in the country —
and hosts many other cultural and educa
tional events. The Stanford American Indian
Organization is increasing its special fee by
$3,004 this year to compensate for a $15,000
loss in funding from the University, which in
the past has covered large-scale event logistics
such as bleachers, facilities and security.
STANFORD $25,555.50
ARCHERY (U $4.03)
CLUB
NO
The Stanford Archery Club has been very
enthusiastic in promoting classes to stu
dents. The club competes in national events
and offers lessons for a $5 fee. After watch
ing the popularity of the classes expand, the
club decided to apply for a special fee in
order to allow all students to attend the
lessons for free. Although archery is becom
ing a more popular sport, the entire student
body should not subsidize or completely pay
for the lessons of a few students. The club
should continue charging for lessons or
should seek alternative sources of funding.
STANFORD AXE $10,825
COMMITTEE (U51.71)
YES
Aside from caring for the Stanford Axe,
temporarily on loan, and maintaining a
correct historical account of the Axe, the
Stanford Axe Committee publishes the
Freshman Handbook, conducts the Big
Game Countdown, puts on the Bonfire
Rally before the Big Game, staffs FliCKs
screenings, sponsors the Frisbee golf tour
nament, and organizes the Battle Cry sec
tion of the (nh Man Club. Now in its 73rd
year, the Axe Committee is seeking to in
crease its in programming in Stanford bas
ketball and to expand its activities to in
clude Founder's Day and Commence
ment. The special fee request of $10,825 is
a $125 increase from the previous year's
request. How could you vote no to them?
Might as well leave Stanford and go to Cal.
STANFORDBAND $78,190
(U $12.34)
YES
The Stanford Band provides musical accom
paniment at noteworthy events and serves
the community by lampooning Stanford's
opponents. The Stanford Band is increasing
its special-fee request by $ 12,000 in order to
defray costs for University-mandated securi
ty at Band Runs and other Band events. The
Band supplies instruments to all members
who desire them, and hence their largest ex
penses are equipment purchase and mainte
nance. We do recommend, however, that
the Band is careful about their expenses in
order to provide the best services to students
while minimizing costs.
STANFORD $23,321.29
CHAPARRAL (U $3.68)
YES
The only humor magazine on campus and
the second-oldest collegiate humor maga
zine in the country, the Stanford Chappar
al is published six times a year. Each issue
— except for the "Fake Daily," which is dis
tributed on campus — is delivered to each
undergraduate dorm room. There is a core
staff of 10 to 15 students, and 30 to 40 stu
dents attend each meeting. All of the special
fee goes toward printing costs.
STANFORD $6,090
COMMUNITY (U $0.96)
CARNIVAL
YES
The Stanford Community Carnival is an
annual public-service event where ele
mentary school students from East Palo
and East Menlo Park are brought to Stan
ford to celebrate Community Day. The
group sets up booths run by student vol
unteers and sponsors a free raffle. While
the organizers should continue to look for
donations from outside sources, the group
deserves its small special-fee request.
STANFORD $18,955.75
COMMUNITY (U $2.99)
FARM
NO
Stanford Community Farm provides
free plots of land to any interested
members of the undergraduate body.
Policy on plot distribution is simple; use
it or lose it. Organization expenses in
general are minimal; the overwhelming
majority of the special fee request is in
hiring a garden manager to operate
things during student absence and to
provide continuity to the Farm, as well
as log the events of the Farm. Although
this group does a remarkable job of
keeping costs to a minimum, the need
for outside management is unconvinc
ing; efforts should be made to reduce
this need, possibly through sponsorship
by the Biology Department, or even the
Department of Geological and Environ
mental Sciences.
STANFORD $39,028
FILM SOCIETY ($6.16)
MAYBE
The Stanford Film Society runs a wide vari
ety of events each year. While its United Na
tions Association Film Festival is more well
recognized among students, the society also
runs quarterly advanced movie screenings,
director-attended screenings (this year Ron
Shelton attended "Dark Blue"), special
theme screenings and numerous events to
support student filmmakers, such as a stu

dent film compilation, the Student Film
Festival, grants, film career events and stu
dent filmmaker workshops. Most of the
funding comes from its special fee, and
while the society has a conservative budget,
we wonder if the student turn out for these
events warrants that every student con
tribute to all of the events. Perhaps the soci
ety should charge for some of their events
or seek alternate sources of funding.
STANFORD $19,591
HARMONICS (U $3.09)
MAYBE
Continuing to perform in its 11th year, this
a capella group not only has numerous per
formances throughout the quarters, both
in dorms and in concerts, but they also in
vite guest artists and other a capella groups
to perform in various shows. This is the first
year that the group asks fora special fee,
and their request is well justified. The
money will go mostly to cover the costs of
guest shows, eliminate costs to attend the
most of the group's performances and to
reduce the prices of their CDs. Additional
ly, all musical and performance groups on
campus must raise substantial amounts of
money to use Stanford facilities and about
one-third of the budget goes towards this
expense. All of the special-fee allocations
are directed toward the interest of the stu
dent body — the group also raises money
through The Stanford Fund, various gigs
and fundraisers in order to pay for all of
their travel expenses.
STANFORD IN $18,648
GOVERNMENT (U $2.94)
(SIG)
YES
Stanford in Government has decreased this
year's fee request by $ 1,490, chiefly in the
line item of honoraria. Stanford in Govern
ment is a nonpartisan political group which
hosts well-known government leaders
(Janet Reno this week and recently Ehud
Barak), along with lecture series and panel
discussion in areas of government and po
litical science. SIG has 50 total members
and seeks to provide the Stanford commu
nity first-hand exposure to the most salient
political issues, as well as allowing its mem
bers with one to one contact with its guests
STANFORD JAZZ $23,400
ORCHESTRA (U $3.69)
NO
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra, consisting of
20 members, performs at quarterly con
certs throughout the year. Professional jazz
musicians are also invited to perform at
these shows, and students can purchase dis
counted tickets. The majority of the special
fee goes toward providing honoraria for
the guest musicians. While many students
attend the concerts, they should not be
wholly funding the concerts. A portion of
the special fee will go toward a European
tour next summer; the group will perform
at jazz festivals in Italy. The group should
focus on fundraising or performances to
fully fund the travel costs.
STANFORD $37,318.05
MARTIAL ARTS (U $5.89)
PROGRAM
YES
The Stanford Martial Arts Program is an
umbrella organization for some 14 martial
arts organizations 011 campus. The special
fee provides rent for practice space, a salary
for the program director and helps to pur
chase equipment. The group is asking fora
slightly higher special fee this year because
the rent for practice increased in some
buildings by 149 percent. More than 500
students are directly involved with the pro
gram, but it also provides self-defense sem
inars, annual demonstrations and tourna
ments to teach and entertain the entire
community.
STANFORD $7,750
MOCK TRIAL (U51.22)
NO
Stanford Mock Trial participates in the
American Mock Trial Association's court
trial simulation competitions. The group
is composed of 30 members, forming
three teams. Teams travel to different
competitions throughout the state and
nation to compete in events. While the
group has managed to cut costs on trav
el expenses and accommodations by
driving to state tournaments instead of
flying, much of the group's budget is al
located for travel. The group does bene
fit the outside community, however, by
organizing a high school Mock Trial

Symposium composed of over 13 local
schools. Still, we don't believe students
should spent their money to send only a
lew of their peers to tournaments across
the nation.
STANFORD $25,959
NAACP (U $4.10)
MAYBE
This affiliate of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People works
to address civil issues by holding weekly
meetings that include speaker presenta
tions and town hall discussions. While its
mission statement is unarguably excellent,
half of its special fee will go toward provid
ing traveling accommodations of members
to national conferences. This group should
look for other methods to raise funds to
send its members to these conferences.
STANFORD $5,937
PROJECT ON (U $0.94)
HUNGERAND
NUTRITION (SPOON)
YES
The Stanford Project on Hunger and Nu
trition is a service organization that works
to reduce food waste by donating unused
leftovers to a local shelter, Urban Min
istries. It is affiliated with the Haas Center
for Public Service. Because the bulk of its
operation relies on donation and volunteer
work, its costs to the student body remain
low while providing an invaluable service
to the local community. Most of its costs
arise from transportation and procedures
for sanitary handling of donations; al
though its special-fee request has risen
slightly from last year's, it is due to in
creased student interest and program suc
cess. Overall the organization's request is
very reasonable, and the organization also
receives funding from the Stanford Fund
and corporate donations.
$19/725
SHAKESPEARE (U $3.11)
SOCIETY
NO
The Shakespeare Society won a special fee
last year on the promise that it would bring
a high-quality theatrical performance to
several on-campus venues, including Frost
Amphitheater. While we admire the ambi
tion of the 20-member group and whole
heartedly support the arts on campus, the
group has not demonstrated consistently
that it has a viable and institutional pres
ence on campus. The special fee this year
was used to bring drama teachers from the
Bay Area to campus, but since the work
shops were not open to everyone and since
students still have not seen this year's per
formance, we believe the Shakespeare Soci
ety needs to make itself more visible before
soliciting student money.
STANFORD SOLAR $36/250
CAR PROJECT (U $5.72)
NO
This year the Stanford Solar Car is planning
to participate in two races. First, the project
will compete in a nationwide event between
colleges. Second, the car will race in an inter
national, televised competition involving
world industries. While the project repre
sents the Stanford community in its compe
tition against colleges such as M IT and cor
porations such as Ford Motor Company, it
involves few students. The project is asking
fora relatively high special fee request con
sidering the total benefits to the student body
and should consider corporate fundraising.
STANFORD $18,954
STUDENT (U $2.99)
BIODESIGN
NO
Stanford Student Biodesign is an inter
disciplinary academic and professional
community in an emerging field, draw
ing from recent advances at the inter
section of biology, medicine and engi
neering. Associated with Bio-X, Stan
ford Student Biodesign provides its 272
members with workshops, dinners,
speakers, a resume book and career
preparation. Stanford Student Biode
sign's outreach includes educating pro
fessionals about the nature of the
emerging field and publishing a journal
of its members. The organization typi
cally receives substantial funding from
industry. Although the current econo
my has reduced funding, because this
group has such limited benefits to the
entire community, the group should

seek funding from the Bio-X program.
STANFORD $19,274
TAIKO (U $3.04)
MAYBE
In accordance to its mission of exposing
people to the "beautiful art form of
taiko," this drumming group performs
on campus throughout the year, includ
ing at its annual spring concert, which
drew a full house in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium the past two years. The majority of
the special fee will go toward holding the
annual Intercollegiate Taiko Invitation
al at Stanford next year. The event,
which draws taiko groups from across
the country, will allow the various taiko
groups to learn from one another and
from world-renowned taiko drummers
who will lead workshops. The Intercol
legiate Taiko Invitational will give the
Stanford community the opportunity to
watch a variety of taiko groups perform.
Another large portion of the special fee
will go toward purchasing two new
drums and drum stands. While Stanford
Taiko is only asking for half of its pre
dicted expenses in special fees, there are
only 15 active members in the group, for
which the amount requested is rather
large.
STANFORD $7,245
UNDERGRADUATE (U51.14)
RESEARCH JOURNAL
(SURJ)
MAYBE
The only one of its kind, the Stanford Un
dergraduate Research Journal publishes
the undergraduate research from all disci
plines. In its second year of publication,
SURJ saw a 100 percent increase in the
number of submissions, from 50 last year.
Both last year and this year, 12 submissions
were selected for publication. For each
issue, 2,000 copies of the journal are print
ed; these copies are delivered to the li
braries, University department offices and
dorm lounges. Next year, SURJ hopes to
publish two issues to allow more students
to have their work published. The vast ma
jority of the special fee goes toward print
ing the journal and thus the special fee is
well-spent. However, since the journal is
an academic publication, perhaps it should
look to the Undergraduate Research Pro
gram Office for funding and support.
STANFORD $15,469
WIND (U $2.44)
ENSEMBLE
NO
The Stanford Wind Ensemble is asking for
special-fee funding for the first time. The
funds would mostly cover equipment
rental for this group that involves about 40
students. In the past, the organization has
received funding from the Music Depart
ment, and it continues to so. We believe
that the ensemble can increase the price of
its performance tickets to cover equip
ment rentals instead.
STANFORD $9,912.85
WUSHU (U $1.56)
MAYBE
Stanford Wushu, a performing martial
arts group, is asking for special fee money
this year because of its expanding needs:
Wushu now has three classes and 130
members. The special fee would be used
primarily to fund a collegiate wushu tour
nament on campus net year. The group
does do outside fundraising and appeals
to a large audience, but it's not clear that
asking students to pay fora tournament
for Stanford and 10 to 12 other schools is
the best way to sponsor such an event.
SEAS, A GROUP $9,463.60
FOR SOCIAL & (U $1.49)
ENVIRONMENTAL
JUSTICE
NO
Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford is an admirable organization that
works on issues related to the environmen
tal justice movement. Two years ago, the
group spearheaded an effort to stop the
medical school from insinuating medical
waste in Oakland and this year the group
has started working on University divest
ment issues. However, the dozen active
members have not shown their commit
ment to providing some kind of tangible
value to the community and we question
whether the entire student body should
support a group that lacks focus.

THE MIND'S $14,510.50
EYE (U $2.29)
YES
The Mind's Eye, billed as "a Stanford jour
nal of expression," is working on increasing
its visibility on campus through programs
such as poetry nights and issue-release so
cials. Its special-fee request mainly reflects
the publication's printing costs and the ex
pense of financing events. The journal has
been working on procuring donations and
Stanford Fund shifts, but its revenue is still
limited by its commitment to avoiding com
mercial advertisement. Thus, the special
fee is integral to continued publication, but
the group should continue to actively ex
plore ways to lower its request amount in
the future.
VIENNESE BALL $12,704.73
COMMITTEE (U52.01)
NO
The Viennese Ball attracts about 1,200
students, faculty and community mem
bers each year. It has been held annually
since 1977, and it has become part of
Stanford tradition. The special-fee re
quest helps reduce the price of tickets and
pay for part of the off-campus venue. Al
though the Ball is a special tradition at
Stanford, the high costs of the tickets
often prevent many students from attend
ing. Thus, the committee should work on
reducing costs in every way possible be
fore asking students to pay even more
money for this event.
VOLUNTEERS $13,639788
IN LATIN (U $2.15)
AMERICA (VILA)
NO
This organization coordinates several ac
tivities, including a speaker series on cam
pus covering issues in Latin America, a
weekly lecture class offered in the spring
open to all students and a volunteer pro
gram that sends 10 students to work with
NGOs to Latin America in the summer.
With the recent cutbacks in the Latin
American Studies department, the speak
er series and class provide a valuable op
tion for students who wish to learn more
about Latin America. Nonetheless, most of
the special fee budget — nearly 70 per
cent — is allocated for travel expenses and
accommodations, most which will go to
funding the trips of the 10 volunteers to
Latin America. While the intentions of
these students are noble, the student body
should not fund the study-abroad experi
ence of a few students.
WOMENSPEAK $7,720
(U $1.22)
YES
Womenspeak is a literary art magazine fo
cusing on women and women's issues that
publishes art, poetry, prose and photogra
phy produced by students, both female and
male. Womenspeak is run by 10 to 12 staff
members, who select one theme per issue.
The magazine is published twice a year, in
the winter and spring, with a total distribu
tion of 1,000 copies. The glossy issues dis
tributed to dorms are well worth the special
fees and the money is spent wisely — more
than 94 percent of the special fee budget
goes to printing the magazines. The slight
increase in the special fees budget results
from the group's wish to print an addition
al 200 copies per issue, but the Stanford
community will most certainly benefit from
the special focus of the magazine.
WORLD $24,806.20
REFUGEE (U $3.92)
LEADERSHIP
PROGRAM
NO
World Refugee Leadership Program is
a new group, seeking its first special
fee. Loosely associated with the United
Nations High Commission for
Refugees, this group has been very suc
cessful in its fundraising outside the
Stanford community and has ramped
up its operations quickly. Seeking to
fulfill education needs within refugee
camps. This group wishes to send mem
bers to a refugee camp in Botswana this
summer to evaluate, plan and establish
online distance learning and en*
trepreneurship programs in the camp.
Although this group has great potential,
there is no guarantee that it will appeal to
a broad group of Stanford students. We
would be able to give the group a more
enthusiastic recommendation if it in
creased its membership.
