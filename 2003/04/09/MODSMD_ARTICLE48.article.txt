# Few changes made for ASSU elections

At 12:01 a.m. today, ballot.stan
ford.edu opened to accept voting by
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents for special fees and executive,
class and senatorial positions. The
process will end tomorrow at 11:59
p.m. The process of voting is largely
unchanged from past years.
Undergraduates can vote for up
to 15 undergraduate senators,
though it is possible to vote for as
few as only one. Graduate students
will vote for representatives to the
Graduate Student Council and for
joint special-fee groups.
The Internet server will ask fora
voter's current academic year so
that they vote on the proper class
slates.
A ranking system is used by the

voting software to create an auto
matic runoff between competing
executive and class candidates.
Two slates are competing for the
ASSU executive this year. Voters
will rank each of the slates as either
a first or second choice.
In instant runoff voting, if no bal
lot wins 50 percent of the first-place
votes, the one with the fewest first
place votes will be eliminated. A
computer program will then re
count the ballots that marked the
eliminated slate as first, counting
the second-place votes cast on those
ballots.
If a slate still does not have 50
percent of the first-place votes,
the ballot with the next-fewest
votes is eliminated and the
process is repeated. This is the
third year the ASSU has used in
stant runoff voting.

A runoff is necessary since ASSU
election guidelines require that a
slate must receive a majority of the
votes to win.
The outcome of the special fees
ballot will determine which groups
will be allocated special fees by the
ASSU.
Voters will select which
groups they wish to allocate spe
cial fees. The program will tally
the total fee and display a real
time sum.
Voters will be able to receive
information on the special fees
online by clicking on the appro
priate item.
"Students will be receiving a flyer
under their door with a list of all
candidates and summaries of their
platforms," said junior Marcus
Williams, the ASSU elections media
director.
