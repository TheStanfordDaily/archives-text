# GSC election draws few office hopefuls
## 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Nineteen candidates are vying
this year for the 15 positions on the
Graduate Student Council, though
a dearth of office seekers has left sev
eral schools with few or no candi
dates in the current election.
The main issues in this year's
election resemble the topics that
are widely discussed each year, in
cluding affordable health care and
housing, child care, parking and
transportation issues, stipends, so
cial interactions and overall quality
of life. Additionally, academics
have been discussed, including the
need to promote more interdisci
plinary exchanges among gradu
ate students from different fields
and more dialogue between stu
dents and administrators. Some
candidates have also expressed
concern that not enough people
are paying attention to world af
fairs and the issues that affect inter
national students.
The GSC is composed of 15
elected members. Ten of these are
elected from and by students within
each graduate school, while there

maining five are at-large represen
tatives who are elected from and by
the whole graduate student com
munity. Candidates run from with
in their respective graduate school,
and those with the highest amount
of votes widiin the school are elect
ed as the school's representative.
The remaining candidates with the
highest number of votes are elected
to the five at-large positions.
The purpose of this division, said
outgoing GSC Chair Grace Chang,
a medical student, is to ensure that
students from each school have a
voice without severely limiting the
number of students who can partic
ipate from any one school.
The schools do have quotas of
representative seats they must fill,
but once they are filled, then the re
maining at-large seats are open to all
candidates. The School of Engineer
ing has two guaranteed seats, the
School of Humanities and Sciences
has three, while the Schools of Busi
ness, Law, Medicine, Education and
Earth Sciences each have one.
Running for these positions are
19 candidates — five from Engi
neering, six from Humanities and
Sciences, three from the Business

School, two from the Medical
School, two from the School of Ed
ucation and one from Earth Sci
ences. There are no candidates this
year from the Law School.
Among this pool of candidates
are two incumbents, Surya Singh,
currendy an Engineering represen
tative, and Ying Wong, currendy an
at-large representative from Hu
manities and Sciences.
The GSC elections campaign is
fairly modest, with the result being
that many graduate students fail to
take notice of them.
.'Man Omand, a first-year gradu
ate student in management science
and engineering, remarked, "Actu
ally, 1 don't know that much about
the grad student elections. I think I
was e-mailed by my CA, but there
have been no real posters or fliers
around that I have noticed and re
ally couldn't tell you one person
who is running to save my life."
Once the 15 representatives are
elected, they participate in an inter
nal election to select the officer posi
tions of chair, deputy chair, finan
cial officer and Funding Committee
chair. No current officers are run
ning for reelection.
