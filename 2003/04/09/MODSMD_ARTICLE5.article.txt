### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
Tonight at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium, for
mer U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno will
offer her insight about the most recent national
and international current events.
Reno, who was nominated by former Presi
dent Clinton in 1993 as the first female attorney
general of the United States, was invited by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and Stanford in Gov
ernment.
According to senior Anne Kim Ho, co-direc

tor of Stanford in Government's Public Policy
Forum, "the open-endedness of the lecture re
flects the continual llux of present political news
and Ms. Reno's regard in presenting Stanford
students with the most recent and relevant po
litical issues."
Chair of Stanford in Government Sonia Mit
tal, a junior, added that SIG hoped to offer stu
dents different perspectives on political issues
and "help students of all political persuasions
think critically about their own beliefs.
"Ms. Reno's experience as the attorney gen
eral makes her a prime candidate to speak on

the domestic implications of the war in terms of
legal policy, an area that is not deeply covered
by conventional media sources," Mittal contin
ued. "Our choice of Ms. Reno addresses the
need for students to discuss current events and
also provides them with a fresh way of ap
proaching them."
Mittal also mentioned that because students
are primarily concerned with the war in Iraq, SIG
wanted to provide them with a new viewpoint
and hopes to stimulate debate on political issues.
ASSU Speakers Bureau Direc
tor Justin Wilson, a senior co
term, said Reno's presence fulfills
the bureau's mission of having
high-profile speakers.
"Few speakers could address
the Stanford community with as
much first-hand knowledge and
experience as Ms. Reno brings to a
discussion of current events and

domestic politics," Wilson said.
"We hope that Ms. Reno's
speech will help create a dynamic
forum for the critical issues facing
America and on the tensions be
tween fighting terror and safe
guarding personal liberties," he
added.
This event is also co-sponsored
by the Class of 2004, The Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
and the Dean of Students, the Stan
ford Pre-Law Society, Women of
Stanford Law and the American
Constitution Society.
