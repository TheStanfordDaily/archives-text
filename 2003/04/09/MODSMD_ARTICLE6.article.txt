# Discussion of war often challenging
## Many students don't feel comfortable when debating their views 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than two weeks into the
war with Iraq, students say that
debate over the conflict has been
largely restrained to e-mail and
that the climate for in-person
discussion fluctuates between
accepting and uncomfortable.
"In general, I feel that people
are very careful with their opin
ions, but when [war] is dis
cussed, I definitely feel that peo
ple are extremely close-minded
about their opinions" said fresh
man Gabi Koch. "Also, some
people will flat-out refuse to dis
cuss politics, making it hard to
stimulate a comfortable atmos
phere.
"I don't feel that people take
it seriously enough," she contin
ued. "If it weren't for the news
papers in the dining halls, I
wouldn't realize there was a war
going on. There really is a bub
ble around the campus."
Sophomore Anthea Tjua
nakis concurred.
"I feel like [the climate of de
bate] could be a little more
open," she said. "Sometimes
people get really caught up in
their studies and can be a little
too introverted because it's
such a high pressure environ
ment. More people need to
break out a little bit and see the
bigger picture of things. Some
times [school] can be trivial in
comparison to the bigger pic
ture."
In helping to break through
this mentality, the dorm is a crit
ical setting for discussion and
debate on campus.
Travis Menk, a senior, said
his dorm organized several dis
cussion-oriented activities to
deal with the topic.
"There was 'butcher paper
conversation,' " he said. "After
the butcher paper conversation,
Twain had a discussion that I felt
was good because the staff took
an active role in moderating it
and made sure everyone got in
their complete thoughts."
For many students, their
dorm's e-mail list has been an
important forum for voicing
their opinions.
"A lot of debate happens,
often online, especially with
highly loaded issues like war,"
Tjuanakis said. "People will
send a mass e-mail . . . and it
reaches a lot of people. I think
sometimes with issues like that,
that are highly emotional, peo
ple have a tendency to respond

very quickly and very strongly .
. . Often I don't agree with
some of the things being said
but I like it. But I know that
some people are like, 'Why are
they sending this e-mail to the
list, I don't wanna read this
stuff.' There is an opinion that's
like, people who would rather
be apathetic and don't want to
deal with the spam in their
inbox."
Others have found the use of
the dorm's e-mail list to voice
opinions about the war harass
ing. Menk, co-president of the
Stanford College Republicans,
mentioned that several pro-war
residents in his dorm had un
subscribed from the dorm mail
ing list because of the volume of
anti-war materials that were
being circulated. The staff had
to specifically request that dis
cussions of the war be saved for
other forums.
Tjuanakis acknowledged
that discussions through an In
ternet forum have potential
hazards.
"It's a lot different when
you're interacting in person and
when you're interacting anony
mously through e-mail," she
said. "It affects the type and the
style of debate and what people
say and how they say it."
But, when they occur, stu
dents do not feel discussions on
campus are necessarily open to
all points of view.
"I've seen good things hap
pen where people are making a
conscientious effort to have dia
logues and listen to what people
are saying," Menk said. "But I've
also seen a lot where people
aren't listening. Not only does

each side need a chance to ex
press their views but each side
needs to listen."
Menk said that because his
pro-war stance is not the one
generally accepted on campus,
people are less willing to listen.
He added that this attitude to
ward those who support the war
has kept many students from ex
pressing their opinions.
"Many people decide they're
not going to say anything be
cause they don't want to get into
a two-hour debate where no one
is going to listen, they're just
going to criticize and attack
you," he said. "Or they don't
want to be labeled. You're kind
of black-balled as the 'warmon
ger' in the dorm."
Others feel the climate is tol
erant.
"I come from Portland, Ore
gon, which is a very liberal envi
ronment in general — there
people are very open to receiv
ing liberal things," Tjuanakis
said. "Here, I believe, there's
more of a balance between peo
ple who are pro and con for most
issues. There's room to express
both sides because there are
people who believe both things."
On both sides of the issue, stu
dents feel information is key to
having effective discussions on
campus.
Menk concurred, "Informa
tion is the key to everything
from both sides. I do not
feel that everybody really has all
the information or has informa
tion from all sides to make these
informed decisions or to argue
these points. That's why we need
to have dialogue on this
campus."

want to be labeled. You're kind
of black-balled as the 'warmon
ger' in the dorm."
Others feel the climate is tol
erant.
"I come from Portland, Ore
gon, which is a very liberal envi
ronment in general — there
people are very open to receiv
ing liberal things," Tjuanakis
said. "Here, I believe, there's
more of a balance between peo
ple who are pro and con for most
issues. There's room to express
both sides because there are
people who believe both things."
On both sides of the issue, stu
dents feel information is key to
having effective discussions on
campus.
Menk concurred, "Informa
tion is the key to everything
from both sides. I do not
feel that everybody really has all
the information or has informa
tion from all sides to make these
informed decisions or to argue
these points. That's why we need
to have dialogue on this
campus."
More than two weeks into the
war with Iraq, students say that
debate over the conflict has been
largely restrained to e-mail and
that the climate for in-person
discussion fluctuates between
accepting and uncomfortable.
"In general, I feel that people
are very careful with their opin
ions, but when [war] is dis
cussed, I definitely feel that peo
ple are extremely close-minded
about their opinions" said fresh
man Gabi Koch. "Also, some
people will flat-out refuse to dis
cuss politics, making it hard to
stimulate a comfortable atmos
phere.
"I don't feel that people take
it seriously enough," she contin
ued. "If it weren't for the news
papers in the dining halls, I
wouldn't realize there was a war
going on. There really is a bub
ble around the campus."
Sophomore Anthea Tjua
nakis concurred.
"I feel like [the climate of de
bate] could be a little more
open," she said. "Sometimes
people get really caught up in
their studies and can be a little
too introverted because it's
such a high pressure environ
ment. More people need to
break out a little bit and see the
bigger picture of things. Some
times [school] can be trivial in
comparison to the bigger pic
ture."
In helping to break through
this mentality, the dorm is a crit
ical setting for discussion and
debate on campus.
Travis Menk, a senior, said
his dorm organized several dis
cussion-oriented activities to
deal with the topic.
"There was 'butcher paper
conversation,' " he said. "After
the butcher paper conversation,
Twain had a discussion that I felt
was good because the staff took
an active role in moderating it
and made sure everyone got in
their complete thoughts."
For many students, their
dorm's e-mail list has been an
important forum for voicing
their opinions.
"A lot of debate happens,
often online, especially with
highly loaded issues like war,"
Tjuanakis said. "People will
send a mass e-mail . . . and it
reaches a lot of people. I think
sometimes with issues like that,
that are highly emotional, peo
ple have a tendency to respond

very quickly and very strongly .
. . Often I don't agree with
some of the things being said
but I like it. But I know that
some people are like, 'Why are
they sending this e-mail to the
list, I don't wanna read this
stuff.' There is an opinion that's
like, people who would rather
be apathetic and don't want to
deal with the spam in their
inbox."
Others have found the use of
the dorm's e-mail list to voice
opinions about the war harass
ing. Menk, co-president of the
Stanford College Republicans,
mentioned that several pro-war
residents in his dorm had un
subscribed from the dorm mail
ing list because of the volume of
anti-war materials that were
being circulated. The staff had
to specifically request that dis
cussions of the war be saved for
other forums.
Tjuanakis acknowledged
that discussions through an In
ternet forum have potential
hazards.
"It's a lot different when
you're interacting in person and
when you're interacting anony
mously through e-mail," she
said. "It affects the type and the
style of debate and what people
say and how they say it."
But, when they occur, stu
dents do not feel discussions on
campus are necessarily open to
all points of view.
"I've seen good things hap
pen where people are making a
conscientious effort to have dia
logues and listen to what people
are saying," Menk said. "But I've
also seen a lot where people
aren't listening. Not only does

each side need a chance to ex
press their views but each side
needs to listen."
Menk said that because his
pro-war stance is not the one
generally accepted on campus,
people are less willing to listen.
He added that this attitude to
ward those who support the war
has kept many students from ex
pressing their opinions.
"Many people decide they're
not going to say anything be
cause they don't want to get into
a two-hour debate where no one
is going to listen, they're just
going to criticize and attack
you," he said. "Or they don't
want to be labeled. You're kind
of black-balled as the 'warmon
ger' in the dorm."
Others feel the climate is tol
erant.
