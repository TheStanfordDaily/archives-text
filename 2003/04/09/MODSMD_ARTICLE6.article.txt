# Discussion of war often challenging
## Many students don't feel comfortable when debating their views 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than two weeks into the
war with Iraq, students say that
debate over the conflict has been
largely restrained to e-mail and
that the climate for in-person
discussion fluctuates between
accepting and uncomfortable.
"In general, I feel that people
are very careful with their opin
ions, but when [war] is dis
cussed, I definitely feel that peo
ple are extremely close-minded
about their opinions" said fresh
man Gabi Koch. "Also, some
people will flat-out refuse to dis
cuss politics, making it hard to
stimulate a comfortable atmos
phere.
"I don't feel that people take
it seriously enough," she contin
ued. "If it weren't for the news
papers in the dining halls, I
wouldn't realize there was a war
going on. There really is a bub
ble around the campus."
