# GSB loses top ranking to Harvard
## 
### NATALIE FARRELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time in four years,
the Stanford Graduate School of
Business did not take the top spot
in the U.S. News and World Re
port rankings. Instead, the Busi
ness School was ranked second,
behind Harvard.
Business School Senior Associate
Dean and Chief Operating Offic er
Dan Rudolph said he that did not
think the criteria for evaluating
business schools had changed since
last year, but offered some possible
explanations for the change. First,
Harvard had a slightly higher —
less than $ 1,000 more — average
starting salary for graduates than
Stanford this year. Second, he said
that recruiters might have felt bet
ter about I larvard this year, mainly
because the Silicon Valley has suf
fered substantially in the recent eco
nomic downturn.
Every year, The U.S. News and
World Report evaluates several
kinds of graduate schools based on
a set criteria and methodology. Ac
cording to the report, business
schools are reviewed based on qual
ity assessments performed by
deans, directors and corporate re
cruiters, starting salaries and em
ployment rates for graduates and
admissions selectivity. Stanford is
still the most selective business
school, accepting 7.9 percent of its
applicants compared to I larvard's
9.7 percent acceptance rate, and
the entering class this year still had
a higher average GMAT score.

Neither Rudolph nor GSB stu
dents were too concerned with the
rank change.
"We heard what happened, but
we really didn't pay attention to the
rankings," said second-year busi
ness student Claudio Cavassa. "The
important thing is that we are con
sistently up there."
Second-year business student
Elaine Wong had a similar attitude.
She said that she hadn't spoken with
anyone who was at all worried and
that a fellow student had remarked
to her, "One to two; no big deal."
"1 didn't base my decision [to
come here] on rankings; I based it
on the kind of school, the kind of
culture, the kind of education 1

wanted," Wong said. "I don't think
that Stanford students are that up
tight about rankings."
Stanford has a much smaller
program than Harvard's, with 749
enrolled students compared to
1,808 at Harvard. Rudolph said
that Stanford strives to maintain a
more "diverse" curriculum than
other business schools and that the
only school Stanford really com
petes with for students is Harvard.
Historically, the two schools have
routinely tied for the top spot or fin
ished 1-2 in the rankings.
But, said Rudolph, that's not
what really matters to the GSB.
"We don't run the school for
rankings," he said.

Stanford's posh and picturesque Graduate School of Business has routinely
claimed the top spot in U.S. News and World Report's rankings with Harvard.
This year, Stanford's four-year streak atop the rankings came to an end.
