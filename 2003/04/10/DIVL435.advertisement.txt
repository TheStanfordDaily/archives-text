SENIORS:
By spring quarter of your senior year, we hope there's no mystery as to
why you were admitted to Stanford.
But if you are still unsure...
Come find out how admission decisions are made, participate in a case
studies workshop, and learn how you can become involved with
admission programs and events after graduation.
Tuesday, April 15
6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Fisher Conference Room • Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center
Please RSVP to Tali Golan (talush@stanford.edu) by Monday, April 14.
This event is for seniors only. Everyone else can keep guessing.
