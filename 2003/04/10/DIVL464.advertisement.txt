While The Daily supports Stanford's
mission "to qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in life...to
promote the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity and
civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty
regulated by 1aw...", it cannot endorse
Stanford's $255 million request. It is
unreasonable to make students shoulder
this burden, particularly as a large portion
of the money would go to pay the salaries
of administrators, some of whom are
tasked with restricting student activities. In
addition, many of Stanford's courses of
study are self-serving, and draw few
participants. We recommend students vote
no on this request and encourage Stanford
University to seek other sources of income,
such as corporate sponsorship or The
Stanford Fund letters.
