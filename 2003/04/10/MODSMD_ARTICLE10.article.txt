## Golfers teed off at men's group 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — As Tiger Woods played
his final practice round yesterday at soggy Augusta
National, attention shifted from his bid for an un
precedented third straight green jacket to a cramped
room that was filled with them.
More than 60 men, all wearing the coveted symbol
in golf, flanked chairman Hootie Johnson in a stub
born defense of the club's all-male membership.
"If I drop dead this second, our position will not
change on this issue," the 72-year-old Johnson said.
"It's not my issue alone."
Martha Burk and her National Council of
Women's Organizations have pressured the club
for (he last nine months to add its first female
member.
Burk had wanted to protest Saturday at Augusta
National's front gate, but Sheriff Ronald Strength,
citing safety concerns, relegated her group to a lot
about a half-mile down the street.
Burk sued over the decision, but a federal court
ruled against her yesterday. Burk said her group will
appeal but had no legal means to overturn the rul
ing before Saturday.
Burk's group won't be alone on (he 5-acre, weed
pocked lot she calls "that pit."
fhe Rev. Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition plan to protest with Burk. They will be
joined by two groups protesting Burk, another
protesting Jackson, a one-man faction of the Ku Klux
Klan supporting Augusta National and a man who
calls his group "People Against Ridiculous Protests."
Johnson seemed oblivious to it all.
Anyone who thought Augusta National might
cave in to pressure and allow a woman to wear a
green jacket was met — again — by utter defiance
during a 22-minute news conference.
"There may well come a time when we include
women as members of our club, and that remains
true," he said. "However, I want to emphasize that
we have no timetable, and our membership is very
comfortable with our present status."
