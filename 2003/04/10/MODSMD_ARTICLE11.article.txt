# Officials wonder if Hussein dead

WASHINGTON (AP) —U.S. special operations
forces yesterday scoured the site of a Baghdad build
ing leveled by American bombs, searching for evi
dence that Saddam Hussein was inside at the time of
the blasts, officials said.
The team is looking for remains or other evi
dence to prove that the four tons of bombs
dropped on the building Monday hit the Iraqi
leader, the officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Multiple intelligence sources put Saddam inside
the building in the capital's tony Mansour neighbor
hood before it was hit, other U.S. officials said.
Intelligence officials described the information
that led to Monday's strike as solid but did not pro
vide details. One source was believed to be an eye
witness who watched Saddam go inside the build

ing. No one would discuss the identity or charac
terize the credibility of the witness.
The officials stopped well short of declaring Sad
dam dead, describing the information as encourag
ing but not conclusive.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld laid out sev
eral possibilities: "He's not active. Therefore, he's ei
ther dead, or he's incapacitated, or he's healthy and
cowering in some tunnel someplace trying to avoid
being caught."
Most officials expect Saddam to remain in Bagh
dad until the very end. If he llees, it could be to his
hometown ofTikrit, to the north of Baghdad, which
has been bombed heavily but isn't under U.S. con
trol. Officials cast doubt on speculation he could go
to Syria, or seek refuge in the Russian Embassy in
Baghdad.
