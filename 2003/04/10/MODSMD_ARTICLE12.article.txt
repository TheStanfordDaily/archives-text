# Doctor alleges SARS cover up

BEIJING (AP) — A prominent Chinese doctor
charged yesterday that the mainland government
covered up details of the spread of SARS in Beijing,
and an American man with the disease was declared
dead in Hong Kong after being driven across the bor
der in an ambulance.
Other parts of Asia nervously invoked extra pre
cautions to contain severe acute respiratory syn
drome, which has infected around 2,700 people glob
ally and killed at least 106.
The accusations of a government cover-up from
Dr. Jiang Yanyong, retired chief of surgery fora Bei
jing military hospital, came as news surfaced that one
of Beijing's hospitals had shut down because of SARS.
Jiang said doctors and nurses at two other hospi
tals told him at least seven deaths have occurred in
their hospitals and that there were 106 cases of the
disease in Beijing — more than five times the figure
announced by authorities. The Health Ministry re
ports four deaths and 19 cases in Beijing.
Doctors and administrators reached by telephone
at the hospitals cited by Jiang refused to comment.
World Health Organization investigators said they
met with Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Vice
Premier Wu Yi yesterday, discussing "the concern that
there are many rumors and no clear answers," said
Henk Bekedam, the WHO representative in China.
"They definitely said they will be following up ...
and with this high level of commitment, very soon
we'll get some real answers," Bekedam said.
At the People's Aimed Police General Hospital in
Beijing, a receptionist who answered the telephone
said the facility had closed five days ago after staff
members fell ill. She wouldn't give her name.
A sign blocking the hospital entrance said, "Ad
justments being made inside, treatment temporarily
suspended, entry forbidden."
Meanwhile, James Salisbury, a 52-year-old U.S.
citizen and English instructor at a polytechnic insti
tute in Guangdong province, was taken from a hos
pital in the border city of Shenzhen to Hong Kong.
