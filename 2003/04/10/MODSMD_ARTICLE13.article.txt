## The 						Stanford Daily Voting continues today 
### 
Editorial

In yesterday's editorial, we highlight
ed two important reasons why stu
dents should vote in this year's
ASSU elections. First, voting is the
most effective way that students who are
not directly involved in the ASSU can in
fluence student life, since the elected
ASSU officials will affect issues relevant to
the everyday lives of students. The candi
dates have been campaigning for days,
and now it is times for students to vote.
Second, since all students — both gradu
ate and undergraduate — will be finan
cially affected by the number of special-fee
requests that are approved, students
should have their say in which groups re
ceive special-fee funding. Many of the stu
dent groups that have requested for spe

cial-fee funding make valuable contribu
tions to Stanford, and their efforts should
be supported.
As it has done for the past 15 years, The
Daily has endorsed candidates and groups
that have applied for special fees. Mem
bers of The Daily's editorial board met
with and interviewed both of the ASSU ex
ecutive slates and each of the 61 groups
that applied for special fees. All of The
Daily's endorsements are accompanied
with explanations. This four-page special
section can be found on pages five to eight.
We urge all students to take a few min
utes to vote today, for the their own bene
fit and for that of the entire Stanford com
munity. Students can vote at ballot.stan
ford.edu.

77(is editorial represents the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The Daily's editor in chief, managing edi
tor for special sections, two opinions editors and three community members at-large. Signed columns and contributions are the view of t/ie writer
and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.
