## Fighting fire with words

If you've been away from e
mail, TV or society at large for
the last decade, I'd like to wel
come you as a citizen of the in
creasingly connected world.
"When a bomb goes oft in In
donesia, we've got mail," said New
York Times Columnist Thomas
Friedman in a speech to a Stanford
audience on campus last spring.
"When U.S. troops enter the Mid
dle East, the world's got mail," he
said.
As a connected citizen, you've
probably noticed that there's no
such thing as a conventional conflict
anymore. In our world, we receive
SMS messages the moment a laser
guided missile makes contact in
Basra. Our fellow citizens in Japan
watch live news on cell phones.
Friedman elaborates in his book,
"From Beirut to Jerusalem," that in
the modem world — in which tech
nology, media and people are in
creasingly interconnected — the
speed of information is outpacing
our ability to properly react. To add
my own analogy, it's like being rear
ended in your car by an unfamiliar
and unexpected vehicle called in
formation.
Friedman implies that we're not
ready to receive images of U.S. flags
on fire in Cairo or clips from
Hezbollah training videos from
Beirut. Likewise, the Arab world
seems ill-prepared to receive com
mentary on U.S. morals and demo
cratic values in Al-Jazeera or CNN
in Arabic articles. I sure as hell
wasn't (and will never be) ready to
receive the video of the tragic de
capitation of Daniel Pearl that I did
several days ago.
And now, more than ever, peo
ple can force us to hear through in
struments more destructive than
words — acts of de facto terrorism
directed at innocent civilians.
I've learned about connected
ness firsthand.
On Jan. 22, 2002, Sarah Ham
burger was waiting fora bus in
downtown Jerusalem. On her way
to attend a lecture on mysticism,
she mingled with the typical 4p.m.
crowd of students, workers and
tourists traveling home before
sunset.
But someone else was on his way
to the bus-stop that day. Indeed, it
was a Palestinian terrorist wielding
an M-16 assault rifle and a rapidly

fading grip on reality.
Sixty seconds, 58 bullets and
three human lives later, an eerily
thick silence enshrouded the
crowded street as the world came to
an end fora moment. It eventually
came shuddering back to reality,
but the premature death of global
citizens could not be reversed.
Sarah was 79 years old.
Sarah was my great-aunt.

Through elec
tronic channels,
our fellow citizens
of the world re
ceived the mes
sage in minutes.
Some only
heard the sound.
For most in Israel,
the reaction was

the same: citizens either turned in
creasingly bitter, angry or fell fur
ther into despair.
Some only heard the excitement.
For the terrorists, the moment was
inevitably one of jubilation over the
loss of human life, for reasons that
will continue to escape and haunt
me incessandy in the form of un
wanted dreams.
Some only heard the news. For
the majority of the citizens of the
world — in all countries, of all eth
nic descent and religion — the
event was so far removed or foreign
that it occupied little or no time for
reflection or concern. This is natu
ral, as many have no natural con
nection or interest to the Middle
East; odiers tuned it out.
And some actually lost a piece of
themselves. This miniscule
group — torn and bleeding — felt
difFerendy. When you're wound
ed directly in a globally connected
world, you're forced to react. To
gether with other Palestinians and
Israelis who have lost family mem
bers as well as concerned or affect
ed Americans, I have helped form
a group that has decided to use the
same system to fight back. We vow
never to bleed again yet at the
same time keep humans — the
global citizens — from shedding
blood as well.
We've decided to plant the roots
of peace in the Middle East and
have cs'Ued it "Jozoor," the Arabic
word for "roots." But what does it
mean to plant the roots of peace in a
world where everything is seeming
ly able to be uprooted?

Ideas, job security, hope and
even life seem transient especially
to many Palestinian youth —
angry global citizens — who
have eaten nothing but hatred
and washed it down with nothing
but a weary struggle initiated by
older generations. With over 60
percent unemployment in most
parts of the Palestinian territories
and many subsisting on the equiv
alent of $2 per day, what is to be
done?
Put simply, we're actively partici
pating in the battle for information.
We're directing the struggle to in
fluence young Palestinian males be
fore they're influenced by other
global citi? ns — the terrorists.
Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Jerusalem
Brigades, the Hezbollah, al-Qaida,
ad infinitum. They're watching. We
can't see them. If we could, we'd
stare them in die face and tell them
that education, a higher standard of
living and real job skills are always
superior to martyrdom and an
guish. Terrorists are pushing the
youth toward bitterness by inciting
self-inflicted martyrdom and unnat
ural death; we're lifting the youth
up by creating the foundation for
stable lives.
The idea goes like this: We've
identified the demographic that ter
rorists actively recruit for member
ship — males, aged 20 to 29, from
rural areas — and we will provide
them with the two essential re
sources they need to succeed as
moral global citizens.
The first is training. We will pro
vide young entrepreneurs with the
critical vocational skills — basic ac
counting, financial responsibility,
marketing, banking principles and
strategy — required in order to
successfully implement a small
business.
The second is the capital. We will
provide microloans — ranging
from $500 to $5,000 each with low
interest —to properly fund new
ventures.
During the next five years, we're
positioned to enroll 22,000 people:
roughly 10 to 15 percent of our en
tire demographic. The result is not
only sound economics but is the fun
damental, long-term and necessary
basis of peace for the entire Middle
East region. And being as connected
