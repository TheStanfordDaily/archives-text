Stanford Archery Program's
special-fee request makes archery
accessible, affordable
It is unclear to us how, after speaking
with our group and reading our detailed
budget outlines, The Daily so completely
misunderstood the Stanford Archery Pro
gram's special-fee request. Though the
commentary included with The Daily's
non-endorsement of our request is
thoughtful, the decision not to support
our group seems based entirely on a false
assumption that we want all students to be
able to shoot archery and join our club for
free.
In reality, as we explained in our discus
sion with Daily staff, the special-fee request
complements an enormous revenue
stream composed in part of student prac
tice fees. While the practice-fee revenue is
sufficient to support basic operational
costs, special-fee funds are the only way the
club can afford to purchase the equipment
necessary and expand the on-campus
archery range to meet the existing student
demand.
Currently, most students who use the
archery facilities or attend our beginner
practices own $50-per-quarter range passes
— no small investment for cash-strapped
students. We allow students to attend their
first practice for free, so that financial factors
aren't a barrier to a new experience. But we
realize that students must help support our
costs directly if they return regularly, which
we why we charge practice fees.
In addition to the revenue from the prac
tice fees, the club earns thousands of dollars
through private coaching lessons offered to
the community and through enormous
equipment sponsorships, all of which go to
ward expanding our programs and keep
ing the sport affordable.
Unfortunately, even the outside fund
ing is not enough to support on-campus

demand for our practices and lessons.
Hundreds of students come through our
programs every quarter; our online
practice sign-ups frequently fill within
minutes of being opened. Each week we
bring over 50 people to our practices,
and even at that rate we are forced to
turn additional students away because of
a lack of equipment .
Our special-fee request is not intended to
make archery free for everybody, but rather
to keep it affordable — so that financial abil
ity is not a barrier to students — while al
lowing us to meet the growing on-campus
demand. By supporting the purchase of
new equipment and the expansion of the
archery range, our special-fee request will
make the generally unaffordable sport of
archery an affordable option for all stu
dents, regardless of their financial situation.

Editor's Note: In the ASSU Elections Hand
book, members of Stanford Archery write "spe

inate [equipment] costs by offering free beginner
practices, equipment and coaching to everyone
on campus. "A similar statement was made when
Stanford Archery intennewed urith The Daily.

Cardinal Ballef s 'Urban Niahts' show
dependent on special fee
The Daily inaccurately and irresponsibly
wrote about Cardinal Ballet's special-fee re
quest. Our group is requesting $22,040 in
special fees, which is significantly less than
the $29,040 The Daily printed. The Daily
was also incorrect in stating that our free
show in Roble will be a new addition to our

program; we already successfully produced
"Works In Progress" with Bent Spoon this
past fall.
We were also dismayed by the disorga
nization and disrespect shown by the Daily
staff members who interviewed us to assess
our special-fee request. They arrived late to
the interview, did not have a copy of our
budget, rushed the meeting and often in
terrupted us. For example, when we tried
to explain why the "Urban Nights" dance
showcase is an important cultural event at
Stanford, one edit board member cut us off,
saying "Oh, you don't have to tell me, I'm a
huge dance fan."
The Daily did not bother to check its
facts with us or assess the feasibility of their
recommendation that we raise ticket prices.
If it did, The Daily would not have made
such an inane suggestion — if we had to
cover the expenses of the show with ticket
sales alone, this would amount to ticket
prices of $200.
Sadly, the use of facilities on campus is
extremely expensive, and no matter how
many Stanford Fund letters we write, our
special fee is our only viable option for
funding "Urban Nights" in a suitable
venue, which charges upfront costs of over
$10,000. The special fee given to Cardinal
Ballet goes direcdy to support the annual
"Urban Nights" show, which is an essential
contribution to die arts on campus.

Editor's Note: Over the course of two days, The
Daily had to schedule 60 special-fee interviews,
and some of the meetings inevitably ran a few
minutes behind schedule.
A member of our editorial board did express
his fondness of dance in the interview with Car
dinal Ballet. But as The Daily explained in yes
terday's paper, the special-fee endorsements were
not a direct reflection of the quality of a work that

a group does. We evaluated, each group on the
amount of their special-fee request and how well
that would go to serving the entire student body.
The Daily reported that Cardinal Ballet was re
questing $29,040 because that is the amount
given to The Daily by the ASSU.

ISIS will provide 'central source of events
information' on campus
We write in response to The Daily's lack
of endorsement for Innovative Student In
formation Services, a project which we be
lieve will deliver incredible value to every
one at Stanford. On May 1, ISIS will intro
duce the University's first comprehensive
centralized events Web site and multimedia
network called "Events@Stanford," which
will finally provide a convenient and reli
able source of events information for the
entire Stanford community.
The Daily is most concerned that ISIS
will not immediately replace fliers and e
mail lists, and therefore should not be fund
ed. This argument misses the point entire
ly. ISIS is a bold step in the right direction
to intimately connect students with their
passions through events, and is desperately
needed: Stanford currently has no central
source of events information.
The Daily states that those groups that
did not receive the editorial board's en
dorsement benefit too few students and
lack robust sources of funding. However
ISIS thoroughly excels in both of these
areas.
How many times do Stanford students
say, "I wish I would have known about
that," after hearing about a speaker they
missed; and how many times do they ask
hopefully, "What's going on tonight?" only
to receive blank stares. These sentiments
have been echoed hundreds of times
through exhaustive ISIS surveys and con
versations with hundreds of students.
Events@Stanford will benefit everyone,
from students seeking events information

to organizers searching for better methods
of publicity. ISIS is one of the few groups
with the potential to enhance learning and
living for everyone on campus.
Furthermore, ISIS has already received
nearly twice its special fee request from
seven of the most prominent offices on cam
pus including the Office of the President,
the Vice-Provosts for Student Affairs and
Undergraduate Education and the Dean of
Students. ISIS funding is arguably the most
diversified of any group on the ballot. How
ever a special fee is absolutely necessary to
continue funding the project for the future.
Clearly, ISIS has incredible support
from all over campus. Amusingly enough,
this includes enthusiastic commendation
from The Daily editorial board. Just last
quarter, the editorial board called ISIS "an
admirable vision to meet the diverse needs
of the Stanford student body," while stating
how ISIS will be "bridging the gap between
diverse communities on a campus-wide
scale" ("ISIS calendar project could help di
vided campus" Jan. 9). We find the lack of
current endorsement quite ironic given
such previous praise.
We would like to echo The Daily's previ
ous statements and encourage students to
learn about this project that has captivated
so many in the Stanford community.

vice to some students, we do not be
lieve that the group should seek spe
cial fees from the entire student body.

Stanford NAACP provides
'valuable services' to students
The NAACP is the largest and
oldest civil rights advocacy orga
nization in the country and is con
tinually credited for spearhead

ing advancements for women and
people of color. An organization
with more than 120 Stanford
members, Stanford NAACP pro
vides many valuable services to
this campus, which were severely
understated in your review yes
terday.
Stanford NAACP serves a vital
role both locally and nationally,
and our work has brought Stan
ford both national and regional
recognition. As a branch of the
NAACP, conference attendance is
mandatory in order to maintain
our charter at Stanford.
However, the budgetary allo
cations for travel serve a much
broader scope than just provid
ing conference accommodations.
This year alone, we attended six
Legislative Mobilization Sum
mits in several major U.S. cities.

Numerous members of our
chapter have lobbied state and
national senators and congress
men on issues that directly affect
students, such as cost-of-living
increases and government finan
cial aid cutbacks. Our non-parti
san platform allows us to educate
and advocate regardless of party
affiliation.
More importantly, Stanford
NAACP serves a vital role in pro
gressive thinking and student
education. We have financially
contributed to the re-birth of two
student publications, Enigma
Literary Magazine and The Real
News.
We are one of the original
sponsors of Black Plaza. We have
served during Civic Action
Week. We have also worked with
the ASSU's Get out the Vote

Campaign. Finally, members of
Stanford NAACP attended and
worked on the April 1 March in
Washington D.C. regarding
Stanford's official stance on the
University of Michigan affirma
tive action case. We also offer bi
weekly education-based pro
grams.
Despite doing all of this work, we
have managed to reduce the esti
mated budgetary demands for next
year, and we feel that it is clear that
Stanford NAACP should be sup
ported for special fees.

Stanford Archery Program's
special-fee request makes archery
accessible, affordable
It is unclear to us how, after speaking
with our group and reading our detailed
budget outlines, The Daily so completely
misunderstood the Stanford Archery Pro
gram's special-fee request. Though the
commentary included with The Daily's
non-endorsement of our request is
thoughtful, the decision not to support
our group seems based entirely on a false
assumption that we want all students to be
able to shoot archery and join our club for
free.
In reality, as we explained in our discus
sion with Daily staff, the special-fee request
complements an enormous revenue
stream composed in part of student prac
tice fees. While the practice-fee revenue is
sufficient to support basic operational
costs, special-fee funds are the only way the
club can afford to purchase the equipment
necessary and expand the on-campus
archery range to meet the existing student
demand.
Currently, most students who use the
archery facilities or attend our beginner
practices own $50-per-quarter range passes
— no small investment for cash-strapped
students. We allow students to attend their
first practice for free, so that financial factors
aren't a barrier to a new experience. But we
realize that students must help support our
costs directly if they return regularly, which
we why we charge practice fees.
In addition to the revenue from the prac
tice fees, the club earns thousands of dollars
through private coaching lessons offered to
the community and through enormous
equipment sponsorships, all of which go to
ward expanding our programs and keep
ing the sport affordable.
Unfortunately, even the outside fund
ing is not enough to support on-campus

demand for our practices and lessons.
Hundreds of students come through our
programs every quarter; our online
practice sign-ups frequently fill within
minutes of being opened. Each week we
bring over 50 people to our practices,
and even at that rate we are forced to
turn additional students away because of
a lack of equipment .
Our special-fee request is not intended to
make archery free for everybody, but rather
to keep it affordable — so that financial abil
ity is not a barrier to students — while al
lowing us to meet the growing on-campus
demand. By supporting the purchase of
new equipment and the expansion of the
archery range, our special-fee request will
make the generally unaffordable sport of
archery an affordable option for all stu
dents, regardless of their financial situation.

Editor's Note: In the ASSU Elections Hand

Cardinal Ballef s 'Urban Niahts' show
dependent on special fee
The Daily inaccurately and irresponsibly
wrote about Cardinal Ballet's special-fee re
quest. Our group is requesting $22,040 in
special fees, which is significantly less than
the $29,040 The Daily printed. The Daily
was also incorrect in stating that our free
show in Roble will be a new addition to our

program; we already successfully produced
"Works In Progress" with Bent Spoon this
past fall.
We were also dismayed by the disorga
nization and disrespect shown by the Daily
staff members who interviewed us to assess
our special-fee request. They arrived late to
the interview, did not have a copy of our
budget, rushed the meeting and often in
terrupted us. For example, when we tried
to explain why the "Urban Nights" dance
showcase is an important cultural event at
Stanford, one edit board member cut us off,
saying "Oh, you don't have to tell me, I'm a
huge dance fan."
The Daily did not bother to check its
facts with us or assess the feasibility of their
recommendation that we raise ticket prices.
If it did, The Daily would not have made
such an inane suggestion — if we had to
cover the expenses of the show with ticket
sales alone, this would amount to ticket
prices of $200.
Sadly, the use of facilities on campus is
extremely expensive, and no matter how
many Stanford Fund letters we write, our
special fee is our only viable option for
funding "Urban Nights" in a suitable
venue, which charges upfront costs of over
$10,000. The special fee given to Cardinal
Ballet goes direcdy to support the annual
"Urban Nights" show, which is an essential
contribution to die arts on campus.

Editor's Note: Over the course of two days, The
Daily had to schedule 60 special-fee interviews,
and some of the meetings inevitably ran a few
minutes behind schedule.
A member of our editorial board did express
his fondness of dance in the interview with Car
dinal Ballet. But as The Daily explained in yes
terday's paper, the special-fee endorsements were
not a direct reflection of the quality of a work that

a group does. We evaluated, each group on the
amount of their special-fee request and how well
that would go to serving the entire student body.
The Daily reported that Cardinal Ballet was re
questing $29,040 because that is the amount
given to The Daily by the ASSU.

ISIS will provide 'central source of events
information' on campus
We write in response to The Daily's lack
of endorsement for Innovative Student In
formation Services, a project which we be
lieve will deliver incredible value to every
one at Stanford. On May 1, ISIS will intro
duce the University's first comprehensive
centralized events Web site and multimedia
network called "Events@Stanford," which
will finally provide a convenient and reli
able source of events information for the
entire Stanford community.
The Daily is most concerned that ISIS
will not immediately replace fliers and e
mail lists, and therefore should not be fund
ed. This argument misses the point entire
ly. ISIS is a bold step in the right direction
to intimately connect students with their
passions through events, and is desperately
needed: Stanford currently has no central
source of events information.
The Daily states that those groups that
did not receive the editorial board's en
dorsement benefit too few students and
lack robust sources of funding. However
ISIS thoroughly excels in both of these
areas.
How many times do Stanford students
say, "I wish I would have known about
that," after hearing about a speaker they
missed; and how many times do they ask
hopefully, "What's going on tonight?" only
to receive blank stares. These sentiments
have been echoed hundreds of times
through exhaustive ISIS surveys and con
versations with hundreds of students.
Events@Stanford will benefit everyone,
from students seeking events information

to organizers searching for better methods
of publicity. ISIS is one of the few groups
with the potential to enhance learning and
living for everyone on campus.
Furthermore, ISIS has already received
nearly twice its special fee request from
seven of the most prominent offices on cam
pus including the Office of the President,
the Vice-Provosts for Student Affairs and
Undergraduate Education and the Dean of
Students. ISIS funding is arguably the most
diversified of any group on the ballot. How
ever a special fee is absolutely necessary to
continue funding the project for the future.
Clearly, ISIS has incredible support
from all over campus. Amusingly enough,
this includes enthusiastic commendation
from The Daily editorial board. Just last
quarter, the editorial board called ISIS "an
admirable vision to meet the diverse needs
of the Stanford student body," while stating
how ISIS will be "bridging the gap between
diverse communities on a campus-wide
scale" ("ISIS calendar project could help di
vided campus" Jan. 9). We find the lack of
current endorsement quite ironic given
such previous praise.
We would like to echo The Daily's previ
ous statements and encourage students to
learn about this project that has captivated
so many in the Stanford community.

Stanford NAACP provides
'valuable services' to students
The NAACP is the largest and
oldest civil rights advocacy orga
nization in the country and is con
tinually credited for spearhead

ing advancements for women and
people of color. An organization
with more than 120 Stanford
members, Stanford NAACP pro
vides many valuable services to
this campus, which were severely
understated in your review yes
terday.
Stanford NAACP serves a vital
role both locally and nationally,
and our work has brought Stan
ford both national and regional
recognition. As a branch of the
NAACP, conference attendance is
mandatory in order to maintain
our charter at Stanford.
However, the budgetary allo
cations for travel serve a much
broader scope than just provid
ing conference accommodations.
This year alone, we attended six
Legislative Mobilization Sum
mits in several major U.S. cities.

Numerous members of our
chapter have lobbied state and
national senators and congress
men on issues that directly affect
students, such as cost-of-living
increases and government finan
cial aid cutbacks. Our non-parti
san platform allows us to educate
and advocate regardless of party
affiliation.
More importantly, Stanford
NAACP serves a vital role in pro
gressive thinking and student
education. We have financially
contributed to the re-birth of two
student publications, Enigma
Literary Magazine and The Real
News.
We are one of the original
sponsors of Black Plaza. We have

Stanford Archery Program's
special-fee request makes archery
accessible, affordable
It is unclear to us how, after speaking
with our group and reading our detailed
budget outlines, The Daily so completely
misunderstood the Stanford Archery Pro
gram's special-fee request. Though the
commentary included with The Daily's
non-endorsement of our request is
thoughtful, the decision not to support
our group seems based entirely on a false
assumption that we want all students to be
able to shoot archery and join our club for
free.
In reality, as we explained in our discus
sion with Daily staff, the special-fee request
complements an enormous revenue
stream composed in part of student prac
tice fees. While the practice-fee revenue is
sufficient to support basic operational
costs, special-fee funds are the only way the
club can afford to purchase the equipment
necessary and expand the on-campus
archery range to meet the existing student
demand.
Currently, most students who use the
archery facilities or attend our beginner
practices own $50-per-quarter range passes
— no small investment for cash-strapped
students. We allow students to attend their
first practice for free, so that financial factors
aren't a barrier to a new experience. But we
realize that students must help support our
costs directly if they return regularly, which
we why we charge practice fees.
In addition to the revenue from the prac
tice fees, the club earns thousands of dollars
through private coaching lessons offered to
the community and through enormous
equipment sponsorships, all of which go to
ward expanding our programs and keep
ing the sport affordable.
Unfortunately, even the outside fund
ing is not enough to support on-campus

demand for our practices and lessons.
Hundreds of students come through our
programs every quarter; our online
practice sign-ups frequently fill within
minutes of being opened. Each week we
bring over 50 people to our practices,
and even at that rate we are forced to
turn additional students away because of
a lack of equipment .
Our special-fee request is not intended to
make archery free for everybody, but rather
to keep it affordable — so that financial abil
ity is not a barrier to students — while al
lowing us to meet the growing on-campus
demand. By supporting the purchase of
new equipment and the expansion of the
archery range, our special-fee request will
make the generally unaffordable sport of
archery an affordable option for all stu
dents, regardless of their financial situation.

Editor's Note: In the ASSU Elections Hand
book, members of Stanford Archery write "spe

inate [equipment] costs by offering free beginner
practices, equipment and coaching to everyone
on campus. "A similar statement was made when
Stanford Archery intennewed urith The Daily.

Cardinal Ballef s 'Urban Niahts' show
dependent on special fee
The Daily inaccurately and irresponsibly
wrote about Cardinal Ballet's special-fee re
quest. Our group is requesting $22,040 in
special fees, which is significantly less than
the $29,040 The Daily printed. The Daily
was also incorrect in stating that our free
show in Roble will be a new addition to our

program; we already successfully produced
"Works In Progress" with Bent Spoon this
past fall.
We were also dismayed by the disorga
nization and disrespect shown by the Daily
staff members who interviewed us to assess
our special-fee request. They arrived late to
the interview, did not have a copy of our
budget, rushed the meeting and often in
terrupted us. For example, when we tried
to explain why the "Urban Nights" dance
showcase is an important cultural event at
Stanford, one edit board member cut us off,
saying "Oh, you don't have to tell me, I'm a
huge dance fan."
The Daily did not bother to check its
facts with us or assess the feasibility of their
recommendation that we raise ticket prices.
If it did, The Daily would not have made
such an inane suggestion — if we had to
cover the expenses of the show with ticket
sales alone, this would amount to ticket
prices of $200.
Sadly, the use of facilities on campus is
extremely expensive, and no matter how
many Stanford Fund letters we write, our
special fee is our only viable option for
funding "Urban Nights" in a suitable
venue, which charges upfront costs of over
$10,000. The special fee given to Cardinal
Ballet goes direcdy to support the annual
"Urban Nights" show, which is an essential
contribution to die arts on campus.

Editor's Note: Over the course of two days, The
Daily had to schedule 60 special-fee interviews,
and some of the meetings inevitably ran a few
minutes behind schedule.
A member of our editorial board did express
his fondness of dance in the interview with Car
dinal Ballet. But as The Daily explained in yes
terday's paper, the special-fee endorsements were
not a direct reflection of the quality of a work that

a group does. We evaluated, each group on the
amount of their special-fee request and how well
that would go to serving the entire student body.
The Daily reported that Cardinal Ballet was re
questing $29,040 because that is the amount
given to The Daily by the ASSU.

ISIS will provide 'central source of events
information' on campus
We write in response to The Daily's lack
of endorsement for Innovative Student In
formation Services, a project which we be
lieve will deliver incredible value to every
one at Stanford. On May 1, ISIS will intro
duce the University's first comprehensive
centralized events Web site and multimedia
network called "Events@Stanford," which
will finally provide a convenient and reli
able source of events information for the
entire Stanford community.
The Daily is most concerned that ISIS
will not immediately replace fliers and e
mail lists, and therefore should not be fund
ed. This argument misses the point entire
ly. ISIS is a bold step in the right direction
to intimately connect students with their
passions through events, and is desperately
needed: Stanford currently has no central
source of events information.
The Daily states that those groups that
did not receive the editorial board's en
dorsement benefit too few students and
lack robust sources of funding. However
ISIS thoroughly excels in both of these
areas.
How many times do Stanford students
say, "I wish I would have known about
that," after hearing about a speaker they
missed; and how many times do they ask
hopefully, "What's going on tonight?" only
to receive blank stares. These sentiments
have been echoed hundreds of times
through exhaustive ISIS surveys and con
versations with hundreds of students.
Events@Stanford will benefit everyone,
from students seeking events information

to organizers searching for better methods
of publicity. ISIS is one of the few groups
with the potential to enhance learning and
living for everyone on campus.
Furthermore, ISIS has already received
nearly twice its special fee request from
seven of the most prominent offices on cam
pus including the Office of the President,
the Vice-Provosts for Student Affairs and
Undergraduate Education and the Dean of
Students. ISIS funding is arguably the most
diversified of any group on the ballot. How
ever a special fee is absolutely necessary to
continue funding the project for the future.
Clearly, ISIS has incredible support
from all over campus. Amusingly enough,
this includes enthusiastic commendation
from The Daily editorial board. Just last
quarter, the editorial board called ISIS "an
admirable vision to meet the diverse needs
of the Stanford student body," while stating
how ISIS will be "bridging the gap between
diverse communities on a campus-wide
scale" ("ISIS calendar project could help di
vided campus" Jan. 9). We find the lack of
current endorsement quite ironic given
such previous praise.
We would like to echo The Daily's previ
ous statements and encourage students to
learn about this project that has captivated
so many in the Stanford community.

Editors Note: In January, The Stanford
Daily editorial board supported ISIS
as a concept. Since that time, the
ISIS Web site has yet to be launched.
As the editorial board mentioned in
the special-fee endorsements section,
while-ISIS may be a beneficial ser
vice to some students, we do not be
lieve that the group should seek spe
cial fees from the entire student body.

Stanford NAACP provides
'valuable services' to students
The NAACP is the largest and
oldest civil rights advocacy orga
nization in the country and is con
tinually credited for spearhead

ing advancements for women and
people of color. An organization
with more than 120 Stanford
members, Stanford NAACP pro
vides many valuable services to
this campus, which were severely
understated in your review yes
terday.
Stanford NAACP serves a vital
role both locally and nationally,
and our work has brought Stan
ford both national and regional
recognition. As a branch of the
NAACP, conference attendance is
mandatory in order to maintain
our charter at Stanford.
However, the budgetary allo
cations for travel serve a much
broader scope than just provid
ing conference accommodations.
This year alone, we attended six
Legislative Mobilization Sum
