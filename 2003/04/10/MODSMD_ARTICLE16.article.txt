## Figueroa / Natoli best choice 
### 
Editorial

This year's election has lacked the
fiery drama and political ma
neuvering that normally engulf
each ASSU contest. Most tragi
cally, the 2003 election offers the fewest
candidates in recent years for the spots of
ASSU president and vice president. Vot
ers can choose either the experienced
team of current Nominations Commis
sion Chair Nadiya Figueroa and Senator
Joey Natoli or the team of Stanford Cha
parral funnymen Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman.
When The Daily sat down to interview
the two slates, we were impressed by the
enthusiasm and foresight that Figueroa

and Natoli brought to
the table. The ASSU
would be in good
hands if they won. And
yet there was some
thing refreshing and
appealing about Yel
derman and Stock
man, who promised to
bring "realness" to the
ASSU, if elected.
On first glance, nei-

ther one of these slates might seem imme
diately appealing. Figueroa / Natoli know
die ASSU well, but Yelderman / Stockman
seem genuinely interested in changing the
current culture that alienates many stu
dents from the ASSU. If Yelderman and
Stockman had actually taken this election
seriously, they might have provided stu
dents with an additional, viable choice.
But in order for the ASSU to be a func
tioning body, we have chosen to rely on
proven experience to lead next year's
ASSU, and so we support Figueroa and
Natoli. They have shown themselves ca
pable of handling the responsibility that
comes with leading the student body. Fur
thermore, the two students are truly pas
sionate about the potential of the ASSU.
Such enthusiasm is critical. Figueroa
and Natoli will have a tough job ahead of
them, especially considering that they
will have to address the very issue Yel-

derman and Stockman lampooned dur
ing their entire campaign: connecting
with students. Because Figueroa and Na
toli have been involved in the ASSU for
so long, their lack of experience outside
of it could be a disadvantage. Figueroa
and Natoli will have to figure out from
their perches in the ASSU office how to
appeal to the student who feels disen
chanted with the ASSU. Simply going
around to dorms will not be enough to
encourage your average, apathetic, busy
Stanford student to care about the
ASSU. Figueroa and Natoli will have to
approach students individually and col
lectively to coax them into getting in
volved.

Yelderman and
Stockman marketed
themselves as two
regular guys who
wanted to "shake
things up" in the
ASSU. That's exactly
what the ASSU needs
right now. For the
past few years, older

students have seen
many presidential candidates, who,
once in office, seemed to produce few
tangible results.
We worry that the ambitious plans of
Figueroa and Natoli could end up alien
ating students who see the promise
heavy platform as maintaining the sta
tus quo of the "ASSU culture."
However, we fully trust that Figueroa
and Natoli will spend the summer work
ing hard to reconnect with the typical
Stanford student. And we know that both
students have the interest and willingness
to set both long-term and short-term
goals for the coming year.
Choices help empower students, and
fora truly engaging group of leaders, stu
dents need many options. We hope next
year's ASSU leadership inspires more
students than ever to get involved and to
run for presidential positions the year
thereafter.
