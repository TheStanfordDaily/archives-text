Graduate & Undergraduate
ASSU LEGAL $102,260
COUNSELING (B $8.06)
YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free,
useful legal assistance to all Stanford stu
dents. In particular, the service is widely
used by graduate students. Although the
attorneys do not represent students in
court, they offer advice on all kinds of
cases. Attorneys are on call seven days a
week and available for consultation two af
ternoons a week. The majority of the spe
cial fee goes toward labor fees.

ASSU SPEAKERS $149,042
BUREAU (B $11.75)
YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau brings a va
riety of highly esteemed speakers to
campus each year. This year's speakers
have included playwright Eve Ensler,
President and Publisher of The New
York Times Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak. The Bureau's events are open to
all students, faculty and the community
at large, and the Bureau prioritizes in
making its events free so that all students
may attend. The majority of its budget
comes from special fees, which cover
speakers' honoraria and travel expens
es, as well as event advertising. We sup
port the Speakers Bureau's bid for spe
cial fees, given its demonstrated ability
to provide quality events for the entire
student body.

CLUB SPORTS $200,659.80
(B $15.82)

YES
Club Sports gives students who are not
varsity athletes the opportunity to partic
ipate in competitive sports. There are ap
proximately 926 students involved in
Club Sports; this year there are 15 teams,
and next year there will be 17 teams. It is
beneficial for teams to be a part of Club
Sports because Club Sports has priority,
after varsity teams, in reserving practice
space and equipment use. The majority
of the special fee goes toward training
material, equipment, facilities rental and
travel.

INNOVATIVE $38,720
STUDENT (B $3.05)
INFORMATION
SERVICES
NO
Innovative Student Information Services
was organized to publicize information
on the events throughout the Stanford
community through campus-wide infor
mation screens and an events Web site,
with the ultimate aim of replacing flier
ing. ISIS will use its special fees to install
plasma screen kiosks and pay for other
development/start-up costs. While ISIS
has the potential to evolve into a success
ful community resource, it is more likely
to supplement, rather than replace, flier
ing and e-mail announcements. In such a
case ISIS may not resolve the problem of
publicity, but merely contribute to re
dundancy.

KZSU $94,202
(B $7.43)
YES
KZSU is Stanford's noncommercial radio sta
tion. It gives students the opportunity to get
involved in radio broadcasting. For those who
have no prior experience, KZSU offers a DJ
training class each quarter. Currendy, there
are about 35 students who are DJs. The ma
jority of the special fee goes toward operating
expenses — including funds for equipment
and hiring a part-time chief engineer — and
some of the special fee is used for on-campus
events that are open to the public, such as
CoHo Nights and Hip-Hop Night. As a non
commercial radio station, KZSU cannot ad
vertise and depends heavily on special fees,
and we support its special fee request.

SCBN $21,477.12
(B $1.69)
MAYBE
SCBN could be an effective outlet for stu
dents interested in television broadcasting,
but the organization currently broadcasts
only two shows regularly — and three oth
ers that don't air as frequently. More than
half of the special-fee request is allocated to
the Teleflicks program, which is popular
among students. However, SCBN should
expand its menu of original programming.
STANFORD $22,380
CHAMBER (B $1.76)
CHORALE
MAYBE

The Stanford Chamber Chorale is the De
partment of Music's premiere choral en
semble. This year it requests fees to subsi
dize its 2003-04 tour to Hawaii, where it
will give concerts and master classes and try
to build Stanford's music reputation.
While the group itself only incorporates 25
students, the Chorale makes a concerted
effort to involve the student body at large
by performing at events such as Com
mencement, An Art Affair and Community
Day. We appreciate the Chorale's efforts to
be visible and involved in campus life, but
we have reservations about its use of special
fees for touring, given such tours' indirect
benefits to the student body.

STANFORD $95,168
CONCERT (B $7.50)
NETWORK (SCN)
YES
The Stanford Concert Network is a stu
dent-run organization that brings musi
cians and performing groups to campus.
Special fees provide for the half of SCN's
budget that is not covered by ticket sales.
SCN successfully manages to bring several
well-known groups to campus each year.
SCN brought Nappy Roots this past
November and will bring They Might Be
Ciants with Dave F.ggers in April. SCN also
sponsors other on-campus events, such as
the CoHo series, which allows smaller, up
and-coming groups the opportunity to per
form. SCN has shown that it appeals to the
general student body and that it uses its re
sources responsibly.
STANFORD NEWS $64,150
READERSHIP (B $5.06)
PROGRAM

NO RATING
The News Readership program brings
copies of The San Jose Mercury News, The
New York Times and The Stanford Daily to
bins around campus. Now in its second
year, the news readership service will ex
pand to bring free newspapers to graduate
students. The program has also brought
speakers to campus this year, including
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., President and Pub
lisher of The New York Times.

STUDENT $36,258
ORGANIZING (B $2.86)
COMMITTEE
FOR THE ARTS (SOCA)
YES
In promoting activities of the arts commu

Committee for the Arts helps to increase
the visibility and awareness of a much-ne
glected community on campus. Its largest
