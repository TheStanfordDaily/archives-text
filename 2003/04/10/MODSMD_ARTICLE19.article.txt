# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Seniors remember the life and lessons of classmate Lena Rufus 
### TALI GOLAN, JEAN LIAO GREG NOVICK GUEST COLUMNISTS 
As Stanford students, our lives, for the
most part, are pretty simple. We get up, we
go to a class or two, eat, sleep and go out
once or twice a week. We live in a bubble
that is created for us as soon as we eagerly
step on campus that first day of freshman
orientation. We continue to prioritize our
time according to how difficult our classes
are; we focus our energy on completing
problem sets and experiments, writing es
says and code, and making the grades
which we are told are crucial for acceptance
into good graduate schools which lead to
good jobs which lead to some preordained
route to happiness.
But everything does not always work
out. Those of us who were close to Lena
Rufus, a senior who recently passed away,
became acutely aware of the vulnerability of
life as the shock of her tragic death on
March 28 began to sink into our conscious

ness. Classes, office hours and grades sud
denly have become insignificant as we
struggle to hold on to our memories of
Lena and to try to remember each hour
that we spent with her.
Unlike many of us who remain absorbed
in our academic pursuits, Lena's priorities
were of a more lasting nature. She focused
her lime at Stanford on building strong re
lationships, looking out for her friends and
learning about the world. Since Lena's
passing, we have been inundated with e
mails from people all over campus who
knew her.
It is touching to hear from so many peo
ple on whom Lena left a lasting impression
and it is a testament to her charisma and
wit. While Lena knew many people, she
chose her close friends carefully, because
with Lena's friendship came her invest
ment of caring and thoughtfulness. If you
were sick or stressed or feeling down, she
would be sure to check up on you, cheer
you up or give you a vote of confidence.
Lena also saw relationships as opportuni

ties not only to form close bonds, but also to
learn. From the day she stepped onto cam
pus, Lena was eager to learn as much about
the cultures, issues and history of the world
as she could.
She, like each of us, arrived here from a
small corner of the world, and she saw her
days at Stanford as an amazing opportuni
ty to take in everyone's story whether from
a class, a campus organization or just sitting
down with someone.
Some might say that perhaps Lena's
focus on less transitory things was a result of
her struggle with lupus, a debilitating dis
ease of the immune system. Certainly, liv
ing widi such a disease can intensify the
value of every moment. Regardless, it is im
portant to note that nobody knew Lena as a
"senior with lupus," as The Daily referred
to her last week. In fact, very few people on
campus were aware that she had lupus.
Lena was just Lena â€” a hilarious, beautiful
and not-so-average Stanford student.
Lena's life reminds us that there is so
much to cherish during our time at Stan

ford.
While grades and jobs are of obvious im
portance to our future welfare, perhaps we
should consider a greater investment in our
relationships instead of networking and im
pressing future employers or graduate
schools. Every day need not be so struc
tured around building a future whose well
being is measured in dollars.
To some, such a strong commitment to
one's friends seems to place too much time
and faith in relationships that could fade
after graduation. Lena understood, howev
er, that no second of the time she spent
learning about others was wasted or was less
valuable than the time she spent studying
and working. She leaves us with deeply en
trenched lessons about how we should treat
our friends, how much we have to learn
from each other and how much we can
grow.
Whenever she found an idea or issue
that spoke to her, she would refuse to let go
of the discussion until she understood all
sides completely. She was always deter

mined to expand her views and never hesi
tated to change herself and to then share
with, and perhaps influence, her friends.
Given the impact she had on her friends
and acquaintances, we are left wondering
how much more we could have learned
from her and how we might have grown to
gether.
In the 22 years of her life, Lena taught us
more than most would ever think to share
throughout much lengthier life spans; to
the extent that she allowed valuable things
change her life, we hope that hers, in pass
ing, will help us change ours for the better.
The memorial service for Lena Rufus
will be held today at 7:30 p.m. at the Elliot
Program Center. All are welcome to attend.
