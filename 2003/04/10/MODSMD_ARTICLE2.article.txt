# Reno reflects on policy, life
## 
### HELEN KIM EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Daily conducted a 10-minute one-on-one in
terview with former U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno after her speech last night. Reno discussed her
life and her views on Attorney General John
Ashcroft's anti-terrorism policies, student visas, affir
mative action and the war in Iraq.
The Daily: Why did you decide to come here and
speak at Stanford?
Janet Reno: I have great respect for Stanford and
I have really enjoyed my opportunities to talk with
students. I particularly like the opportunity to share
my thoughts with them [and] the opportunity to have
questions and answers as well.
TD: What is your opinion about the current Attor
ney General John Ashcroft in terms of civil liberties?
From the point of view of many Arab, Muslim and
South Asian Stanford students, they are unfairly tar
geted, especially in the wake of Sept. 11.
J R: I have not been briefed by the Justice Depart
ment or by the attorney general on his decision for the
basis of this, so you have to take that as a qualifying fac
tor of what I say. But I am concerned that he has said
to the Senate Judiciary Committee that in effect, any
body who criticizes the administration is somehow a
lesser patriot. That still is what I think is very impor
tant â€” constructive and thoughtful discussion. And I
think in this state, you need to understand. I think
anything that gives people the impression of being
targeted that isn't based on sound, intelligent leads is
again wrong. I think it's important that we try to work
through these issues and much can be done if we take
common-sense approaches to it and identify intelli
gence that leads us in the direction to the right people
and who did it.
TD: Along these lines, what about student visas?
I've been informed that recently, not as many inter
national students are able to get visas to come here
and study.
JR: I think that in all circumstances, visas and is
sues that were related to the old Immigration and
Naturalization Services are difficult. It's important
that we have the funds necessary to properly process
the cases. Student visas are very important to adding
to the intellectual excellence to this country. They
have made so many contributions and 1 don't think
that we should do anything that deters this opportu
nity.
