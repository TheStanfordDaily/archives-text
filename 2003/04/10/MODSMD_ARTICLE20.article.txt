## Cardinal women's gymnastics Senior triple threat 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
On March 22, the then-No. 9
Oklahoma women's gymnastics
team arrived at Stanford immedi
ately following a huge victory
against top-ranked UCLA. But the
Sooners would sooner have been
anywhere than Burnham Pavilion
as No. 6 Stanford notched a
197.725 to take the win.
The meet saw junior Caroline
Fluhrer return to the all-around
for Stanford with a stellar debut on
vault and junior Lindsay Wing ex
ecute flawlessly on the balance
beam to chalk up the first perfect
10 on the apparatus in Stanford
history.
But there was an extra twist in
the plot that made the matchup a
night to remember: It was Senior
Night for Alissa Cooper, Abby
Gair, and Kelsey Stillinger.
"Senior Night was a night of
mixed emotions," Stillinger said.
"It was sad, but it was also one of
the best home meets I've ever
seen."
Cooper added, "The win over
Oklahoma was a huge team effort
following finals and a really tough
week in the gym."
What both seniors were too
modest to say is that they were cen
tral to the victory effort. Cooper
delivered in the leadoff position
for the Cardinal on both the vault
ing table and uneven bars, garner
ing a 9.725 on each event. Still
inger started off the beam rotation
in high fashion, scoring a 9.900 in

the one-spot.
"The first person in the lineup is
so important, because it sets the
tone for the rest of the girls," coach
Kristen Smyth said. "I like to have
someone confident, consistent and
experienced there.
"Alissa always delivers for us
leading off on bars and Kelsey
stepped up when it mattered most
to lead off on beam against Okla
homa and at Pac-lOs."
Their teammates agree that the
trio has left an indelible mark on
the gymnastics program.
"They are a class that leads by
example in and out of the gym and
that will be missed," said team
manager and former Cardinal
gymnast Becky Meldrum.
Cooper is admired for her focus
and drive during competition and
in the classroom. She has been a
three-time Academic All-American
while serving as a fixture on vault
and bars for Stanford, and will stay
on the Farm to earn her master's
degree in computer science.
"Alissa's work ethic is one of the
best that I've ever seen and always
motivates us to work harder,"
Wing said. "She pushes us to go
the extra mile."
Smyth added, "The trend for fe
male gymnasts is to come to college
and try to maintain their skills, but
Alissa pushes herself to improve
and learn new techniques. It's a
very rare quality for an athlete in
our sport to have."
Stillinger, serving as co-captain
of the team with Cooper and
Fluhrer, is the heart of the team. She

came to Stanford following in her
father's and brother's footsteps —
both are alumni — and will stay to
finish her degree in product de
sign. After battling injuries all pre
season, she stepped in to perform
on beam when junior Kendall

Beck needed rest, helping the Car
dinal start its postseason effort on
the right foot.
"Kelsey does so much work with
the community and has such a

deep love for the sport," Smyth
said. "I've seen her mature beauti
fully into a leadership role as cap
tain and she's really gone the extra
mile for her teammates in that re
spect."
Gair's explosive bar routines,
marked by her lines and big

swings, helped spur Stanford to
its first-ever Super Six appear
ance in 2002. But after being
plagued by injuries, she has aided
the team as part of the coaching
staff this season, currently serving
as the undergraduate assistant
coach while on a medical leave of
absence.
"Abby was able to translate her
experience as an athlete into being
a particularly insightful and per
ceptive coach in the gym," assistant

coach Larissa Fontaine said.
Smyth added, "Abby has been a
tremendous asset and has gained
the respect of the team and the
coaching staff in her new role. Her
strong sense of self is such an amaz
ing quality."
This triple threat has played an
integral role in the recent growth
of the Stanford program and the
team will draw on their experience
as it gears up for the home stretch.
"The level of college gymnastics

has changed so dramatically in the
last four years, and 1 think Stan
ford is right on the cutting edge of
that," Cooper said.
Gair echoed, "This is one of the
most up-and-coming programs
and we're becoming a real threat
in the gym, something that our
coaching staff is really responsible
for."
Having won the Cardinal's sec
ond conference title in 2001 and
with a first-ever berth at the Super

Six in 2002, the three seniors are
hoping to close out their collegiate
careers with a suitable hat trick ol
memories: another Super Six ap
pearance and the chance for the
NCAA team title.
"Getting ready to march out to
the floor at the Super Six was an in
describable moment," Gair said.
"The team chemistry that we have
and the feeling of unity at that
meet was something only Stanford
truly has."
