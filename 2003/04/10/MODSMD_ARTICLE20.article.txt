## Cardinal women's gymnastics Senior triple threat 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
On March 22, the then-No. 9
Oklahoma women's gymnastics
team arrived at Stanford immedi
ately following a huge victory
against top-ranked UCLA. But the
Sooners would sooner have been
anywhere than Burnham Pavilion
as No. 6 Stanford notched a
197.725 to take the win.
The meet saw junior Caroline
Fluhrer return to the all-around
for Stanford with a stellar debut on
vault and junior Lindsay Wing ex
ecute flawlessly on the balance
beam to chalk up the first perfect
10 on the apparatus in Stanford
history.
But there was an extra twist in
the plot that made the matchup a
night to remember: It was Senior
Night for Alissa Cooper, Abby
Gair, and Kelsey Stillinger.
"Senior Night was a night of
mixed emotions," Stillinger said.
"It was sad, but it was also one of
the best home meets I've ever
seen."
Cooper added, "The win over
Oklahoma was a huge team effort
following finals and a really tough
week in the gym."
What both seniors were too
modest to say is that they were cen
tral to the victory effort. Cooper
delivered in the leadoff position
for the Cardinal on both the vault
ing table and uneven bars, garner
ing a 9.725 on each event. Still
inger started off the beam rotation
in high fashion, scoring a 9.900 in

the one-spot.
"The first person in the lineup is
so important, because it sets the
tone for the rest of the girls," coach
Kristen Smyth said. "I like to have
someone confident, consistent and
experienced there.
"Alissa always delivers for us
leading off on bars and Kelsey
stepped up when it mattered most
to lead off on beam against Okla
homa and at Pac-lOs."
Their teammates agree that the
trio has left an indelible mark on
the gymnastics program.
"They are a class that leads by
example in and out of the gym and
that will be missed," said team
manager and former Cardinal
gymnast Becky Meldrum.
Cooper is admired for her focus
and drive during competition and
in the classroom. She has been a
three-time Academic All-American
while serving as a fixture on vault
and bars for Stanford, and will stay
on the Farm to earn her master's
degree in computer science.
"Alissa's work ethic is one of the
best that I've ever seen and always
motivates us to work harder,"
Wing said. "She pushes us to go
the extra mile."
Smyth added, "The trend for fe
male gymnasts is to come to college
and try to maintain their skills, but
Alissa pushes herself to improve
and learn new techniques. It's a
very rare quality for an athlete in
our sport to have."
Stillinger, serving as co-captain
of the team with Cooper and
Fluhrer, is the heart of the team. She

came to Stanford following in her
father's and brother's footsteps —
both are alumni — and will stay to
finish her degree in product de
sign. After battling injuries all pre
season, she stepped in to perform
on beam when junior Kendall

Beck needed rest, helping the Car
dinal start its postseason effort on
the right foot.
"Kelsey does so much work with
the community and has such a
