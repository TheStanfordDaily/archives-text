# Barnikow swings into role of captain
## 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
If the Stanford women's tennis team
(15-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) is to be
de-throned from its reign of repeat na
tional champions, an opponent will have
to conquer both a flood of young talent
and an steadfast force by the name of Lau
ren Barnikow.
Despite winning a national champi
onship last season, there was concern as to
how this year's squad would respond after
losing its top three singles players and
three seniors overall to graduation. Lead
ership was a question, as graduates Lau
ren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra were the
top singles and doubles players for the

team last season.
Barnikow, a junior, has stepped up in
huge fashion this season, and her in
creased level of play is a large reason why
the team reclaimed its No. 1 ranking yes
terday.
This year, she is 11-2 at the No. 2 sin
gles position and ranked No. 16 in the
country.
Although she is naturally talented,
much of Barnikow's success is a result of
the tremendous effort she extends to all of
her tennis endeavors. As a result, she has

improved each year and constantly
moved up the team's singles rankings
each year.
"As a tennis player, she has shown a lot
of improvement each year," said Stanford
coach Lele Forood. "I think back to her
matches on court four, when she was a
freshman, and consistency was kind of an
issue.
"But that she has really gotten a hold of
her consistency — she has learned to play
more offensive-minded points. And she
just hits bigger, more consistently and
more solidly."
The junior frequently overpowers her
opponents, as her powerful forehand is a
feared weapon.
"She always hit a pretty big ball,"
Forood said. "But she has really worked
on building a point with the forehand, hit
ting some cross-courts, then going to the
forehand inside-out, which is really a
strong weapon for her."
Another reason why Barnikow is so
valuable to the squad is her versatility in
both singles and doubles. Barnikow was
paired with Kalvaria two years ago as the
No. 1 doubles team and last year grabbed
numerous important victories at No. 2
doubles with her current partner, sopho
more Erin Burdette.
Burdette and Barnikow are currently
12-1 as the No. 1 doubles team for the
Cardinal and ranked No. 2 in the country.
"Her doubles was always quite strong
since she played No. 1 doubles as a fresh
man," Forood said. "But, even in that, she
has learned lots of new tricks — her vol
leying is that much more solid, her over
head is great these days; she has really
come a long way."
The junior has known nothing but vic
tory while wearing the Cardinal red, as
the women's tennis team has won the past
two national championships.
With two years of championship expe
rience under her belt, the junior can be
considered a seasoned veteran. Her poise
on and off the court has catapulted her
into the position of team leader, a quality
that has earned her the position ofco-cap
tain.
"She is one of the leaders on the team
this year — she is the co-captain with [fel
low junior] Emilia Anderson, so, probably
more than anything, she has a great work
ethic," Forood said.
"Obviously, she is a junior now, but her
success and work ethic, day in and day
out, has been the big reason. Plus, her and
Emilia have taken control as far as things
that we ask them to do for the team.
"Nobody works harder. At the condi
tioning, during practice, she really sets the

tional ranking. She is also ranked No. 2 in the country in doubles.
