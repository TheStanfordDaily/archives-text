I love sleeping. Though when
I lost an hour of it this week
end up in Davis for an Ulti
mate Frisbee Tournament, I
couldn't have been happier.
(And no, this isn't about to be
come an adults-only column, don't
worry.)
Call it whatever you want —
spring ahead, the barbeque sea
son, late light — daylight savings
time is here, and I love it.

There are a lot
of good reasons
to be on the day
light savings
bandwagon. You
can eat dinner
outside when it's
served at your
Row house and
still see your food,

first of all. Even better than that,
you can make it back from practice
for dinner without the fear of get
ting a ticket for the burned-out
bike light you've had since the end
of fall quarter.
But beneath it all, the love for
the time change and late summer
evenings has to go back to two
things: being a kid and playing
baseball.
When you were a kid (let me
rephrase that: when you were a
kid and you were me) the spring
time change meant that it was light
when your parents got home from
work, and that greatly improved
your chances of a barbeque for
dinner. No complaints there. It
meant time fora game of catch,

some fishing, whiffle ball.
(Now before I get too nostalgic,
rest assured I still maximize my
appreciation of that extra hour of
daylight — it's just usually put to
wards a few more innings of slosh
ball these days.)
But more than that, and the
thing that I still notice years later,
is that the time change means that
when you go to the stadium fora
7:05 game, you're there for sunset.
You park your car and walk to the
stadium with the late afternoon or
early evening sun still warm on
your neck. You sit in a seat that's
still warm with a beer that's just
cold.
Even with the sun still up, how
ever, the lights come on just after
batting practice. The bulbs flicker
on and fill the stadium with more
light than it needs for the time
being, illuminating the players
and all who watch them.
Around the third inning, sun
then falls to the horizon. The third
baseman and right fielder flip
their shades to deal with the glare
and find that sinking liner. By the
bottom of the fourth it's dark —
the sun no longer a concern for
anyone on the field.
Don't believe me? Just go to the
Net, or Pac Bell. (But I'd suggest
Oakland — especially on a
Wednesday).
You can experience the same
thing here on campus — go to a
Stanford game on a Friday night.
