# Lightweights pack punch
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
At six a.m. on a Wednesday morning,
the openweight rowers climb into vans and
head off on their way to Redwood Shores.
The vans have left behind a cluster of row
ers, the lightweight women's crew, who
have to complete one last task before they
practice.
The women stand on the edge of the
Ford Center gym, chatting and taking off
warm-up clothes, while their head coach, AJ
Acosta, heads up to the office fora scale.
"I'm Jen today," Acosta announces, re
turning with a white bathroom scale in
hand. One by one the women shuffle up.
They stand on the scale in their socks and
Acosta writes down their weight.
This is morning weigh-in, a ritual that
the lightweights, now in their spring racing
season, perform before each practice on the
water. Typically the weigh-ins are presided
over by assistant coach Jennifer Hayden.
The weigh-in completed for today, row
ers dig through their bags for granola bars
and tumble into vans.
"The whole weighing-in thing can be
kind of hard," said Angela Rastegar as she
ate an apple. Rastegar walked onto the
team last quarter and has just begun rowing
as a lightweight. "Not all of us are 130
[pounds] so it can be kind of stressful."
Rastegar opened a box of raisins and
thought fora minute.
"Our coaches always say that weighing in
is part of the sport," she added. "Even if
you're not naturally 130, it's part of the
sport to see how effective of an athlete you

can be at 130."
For lightweight rowers this constant
weight-watching can occasionally become
an unhealthy obsession, as athletes attempt
to both gain muscle and keep their weight
down. To be a lightweight, according to the
NCAA, a rower must weigh, at most, 135 in
the fall and 130 in the spring. Stanford has
a relatively new lightweight team, created
last year and has so far tried to avert weight
control problems by only accepting as po
tential rowers people who are already very
close to the weight requirements.
"One of the ways we deal with the weight
issue is, at the beginning of the year, we
didn't take anyone who weighed over 135,"
said Acosta. "It would be problematic if
someone came out at 140 and wanted to
row."
Acosta said that the main problem for
the rowers was figuring out how to hit a
specific number, being at 130 instead of 132
for weigh-ins. Maintaining a healthy diet in
a dorm environment was also difficult, he
said.
"We like to not make [weigh-ins] the
focus," said Kristina Peterson, a sopho
more. "You should come to breakfast at
Stern. Breakfast is more important than the
weigh-in."
In terms of maintaining a healthy
lifestyle, the Cardinal lightweights have
been extremely successful. According to
Acosta, the sports nutritionist has remarked
that the lightweight team is one of the
healthiest varsity teams on campus.
The healthy approach has also helped


The Stanford Daily
The Stanford lightweight women's crew team is one of the most fit athletic squads on campus,
as each rower must balance weight and muscle mass.
