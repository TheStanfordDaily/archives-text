# Cardinal looks to capture victory at championships
## 
### RICARDO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With solid performances by the team's
top gymnasts, the Stanford men's gymnas
tics squad could realistically walk away with
all seven individual titles at the NCAA
Championships this weekend. The No. 8
Cardinal arrives at Temple University with
at least one full-difficulty routine on every
event and a top-four gymnast in the all
around and every apparatus except for the
vault.
Beyond the first few spectacular rou
tines, however, the team's lack of depth will
make it very hard to top No. 1 Oklahoma.
The defending champions are undefeated
so far this season and own the NCAA team
record under the current scoring system.
"The goal is to do at least as well as last
year," coach Thom Glielmi said in refer
ence to the team that surprised many by
making it to team finals. "We also want our
individual champions to repeat and an Ail-
American on every event."
The Cardinal will water down many of

its routines on the first day of competition,
where the top three teams in each session
move onto team finals. For the first portion
of the meet, Glielmi will favor easier but
more consistent routines. Once beyond this
first stage, the team will unveil its full diffi
culty to maximize its placing in the stand
ings.
With four top-five rankings, junior Dan
Gill alone is a serious contender for the
floor, vault, high-bar and all-around titles.
The defending NCAA vault champion has
had a phenomenal season and is the fa
vorite to win the high-bar competition,
where he performs a rare two-release com
bination.
As the country's top ringsman, senior
Marshall Erwin will try to defend his 2002
NCAA ring title. Erwin's ring routine was
so dominating with sheer strength bonus
last season that the NCAA actually changed
competition rules to emphasize perfor
mance over difficulty. Erwin spent the off
season improving his execution and body

positions, and as a result, he has so
far enjoyed an undefeated season
on the event.
Due to his efforts, Erwin is one of
the final nominees for the Nissan-
Emery award, the gymnastics
equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.
Senior Cade Raggio is also one
of the favorites to win the pommel
horse competition, where he has
led the country most of the season.
Raggio can perform a full, 10.0-
difficulty routine on the event with
virtually no deductions and has
done so several times this season.

The team has the most poten
tial on its most inconsistent event,
the parallel bars. Gill, senior Paul
O'Leary, and sophomore Kelly
Lang, the MPSF parallel bars
champion, will all be vying for Ail-
American honors on the appara
tus — if they hit their routines.
Senior Matt McLean's pommel
horse and vault, sophomore
Daniel Torres-Rangel's rings, and
freshman Sean Doolans floor rou
tines all have a good shot at achiev
ing All-American status.
Hit or miss, the Stanford's
trademark for the past 30 years
has been its clean form and execu
tion. The team hopes that the
judges will take note during the
competition.
