### DEB SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter a weekend of extra innings and heartbreak,
the No. 16 Stanford Softball team (30-14, 2-4 Pacific-10
Conference) tore through the Cal Poly Mustangs (17-
26) in a convincing doubleheader sweep.
The first of the matchups began with junior hurler
Dana Sorensen, who quickly shut down the Mustang
bats while in the circle.

Softball
Game 2: Stanford 4, Cal Poly 0

Cal Poly did not handle the Cardinal bats as easily,
as Stanford's offense exploded with five runs in the bot
tom of the first inning. Freshman center fielder Catali
na Morris continued her success at the plate by leading
off lor the Cardinal with a double off the wall, which
was followed by fellow freshman phenom shortstop
Lauren Lappin's single.
Mustang pitcher Eva Nelson did not do much to
help herself by walking seniors left fielder Cassi Brang
ham and second baseman Kira Ching consecutively to
force in the first run of the game.
Sophomore third baseman Elizabeth Bendig fol
lowed with a clutch bases-loaded RBI single to make
the score 2-0.
The rally did not end, however, as senior first base
man Maureen LeCocq took advantage of her turn at the
plate by driving in two runs before right fielder Meghan
Sickler hit in the fifth and final run of the inning.
Following Stanford's first inning onslaught, the
Mustangs were unable to muster a comeback.
The Cardinal would attack again in the bottom of
the second when Ching's two-run double and junior
catcher Jessica Allister's RBI single combined for three
more Stanford runs and an eight-run advantage.
Following Sorensen's dominating three innings of
work, in which she struck out seven, head coach John
Rittman made a pitching change, giving freshman
Laura Severson some time on the runner.
Cal Poly attempted a comeback in the fourth, but
could only produce a single run off of the freshman,
narrowing the score to 8-1. Severson finished the game
and earned her fourth victory of the season.
Lappin finished the victory having gone 3-4, while
Bendig helped out going 2-3 at the plate.

mance in its first at-bat.
Stanford attacked immediately,
commanding a 2-0 lead following
the first inning. This time, Allister
had the two-run double and drove
in Lappin and Brangham.
However, this time it would be
up to Cardinal senior pitcher Tori
Nyberg to hold on to the 2-0 lead
until Stanford scored again in the
sixth.

The Cardinal bats got hot again
in the bottom of the sixth when
LeCocq and junior designated
player Michelle Thiry both singled
to begin the rally. The two scored
later on a pair of base hits by Mor
ris and Lappin.
With a 4-0 lead, LeCocq relieved
Nyberg, who had allowed just
three hits in six shutout innings.
LeCocq did her job, shutting down
the final Mustang bats and posting
the second Stanford victory of the

afternoon.
The donbleheader showcased
what the Cardinal was capable of

at-bat, with eight different Stan
ford players recording a hit in the
nightcap.
In both games the Cardinal
scored immediately and demon
strated its dominance at the
plate.
"They came out and right off
the bat scored a bunch of runs,"
Rittman said. "We pretty much
took them out of the game."
The Cardinal will hope to con
tinue its success at the plate this
weekend as it takes on the No. 1
Arizona Wildcats and No. 12 Ari
