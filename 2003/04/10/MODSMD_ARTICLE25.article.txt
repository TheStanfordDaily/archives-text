Alter a weekend of extra innings and heartbreak,
the No. 16 Stanford Softball team (30-14, 2-4 Pacific-10
Conference) tore through the Cal Poly Mustangs (17-
26) in a convincing doubleheader sweep.
The first of the matchups began with junior hurler
Dana Sorensen, who quickly shut down the Mustang
bats while in the circle.

Game 2: Stanford 4, Cal Poly 0

Cal Poly did not handle the Cardinal bats as easily,
as Stanford's offense exploded with five runs in the bot
tom of the first inning. Freshman center fielder Catali
na Morris continued her success at the plate by leading
off lor the Cardinal with a double off the wall, which
was followed by fellow freshman phenom shortstop
Lauren Lappin's single.
Mustang pitcher Eva Nelson did not do much to
help herself by walking seniors left fielder Cassi Brang

force in the first run of the game.
Sophomore third baseman Elizabeth Bendig fol
lowed with a clutch bases-loaded RBI single to make
the score 2-0.
The rally did not end, however, as senior first base
man Maureen LeCocq took advantage of her turn at the
plate by driving in two runs before right fielder Meghan
Sickler hit in the fifth and final run of the inning.
Following Stanford's first inning onslaught, the
Mustangs were unable to muster a comeback.
The Cardinal would attack again in the bottom of
the second when Ching's two-run double and junior
catcher Jessica Allister's RBI single combined for three
more Stanford runs and an eight-run advantage.
Following Sorensen's dominating three innings of
work, in which she struck out seven, head coach John
Rittman made a pitching change, giving freshman
Laura Severson some time on the runner.
Cal Poly attempted a comeback in the fourth, but
could only produce a single run off of the freshman,
narrowing the score to 8-1. Severson finished the game
and earned her fourth victory of the season.
Lappin finished the victory having gone 3-4, while
Bendig helped out going 2-3 at the plate.

like the first following the Cardinal lineup's perfor-
