# Betting exchange used to calculate war costs
## GSB profs show that war may cost $1.1 trillion of U.S. wealth 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Graduate
School of Business and Harvard
say that their predictions about the
negative impact war would have
on the international economy are
beginning to prove true.

This past Feb
ruary, Justin
Wolfers and Eric
Zitzewitz of the
Business School
and Andrew
Leigh, a doctoral
student at Har
vard, co-au
thored the 45-

page article "What do Financial
Markets Think of War in Iraq?" In
it, they analyze market data to ap
proximate the costs of war in the
Middle East.
By mid-March, the authors
wrote, 95 percent of the war's ef
fect on the U.S. economy would be
known. They estimated that $1.1
trillion of the nation's wealth
would disappear.
Much of the novelty of the ap

proach is derived from the use of
"Saddam Security," an online bet
ting exchange that pays $10 per
share if Saddam is ousted by June
30, 2003.
The authors observed that oil
prices closely follow Saddam Secu
rity, suggesting that the war raises
oil prices by approximately $10
per barrel. They note that markets
predict that these disruptions will
dissipate, with prices returning to
pre-war levels within about a year
and a half.
By analyzing option prices,
the authors have come up with a
range of different scenarios for
the effects that war will have on
the economy: There is a 70 per
cent probability it will lead to
market declines of zero to 15 per
cent, a 20 percent chance of 15 to
30 percent declines and a 10 per
cent risk of a fall of more than 30
percent.
The article points out that the
economic impacts of war are not
confined to the United States.
Leigh, Wolfers and Zitzewitz ana
lyzed the stock markets in 44 dif
ferent countries. They found (hat
countries most likely to be serious
ly impacted are those that import
large quantities of oil or are en
meshed in the world economy.

Dear John
Students write postcards to admitted freshmen encouraging them to pick Stanford.
Wolfers, an assistant professor
of political economy at the Busi
ness School, discussed why he felt
compelled to write the article.
"One of our goals was to reach
a wider audience," Wolfers said.
"I feel that we have a contribu
tion to make to the war debate.
During times like this, it's our
role as intellectuals to inform
public opinion."
Wolfers said he hoped the ap
proach would be valued for more
than its "novelty factor."
"I think there's something
more to it," Wolfers said. "The
stock market is a good way to tap
into important information.
"I'm willing to admit that stock
markets make mistakes," he con
tinued. "But it's important to re
member that the stock market is
made up of people making real
decisions with real money."
The authors have found that
many of their original predictions

have been coming true in recent
weeks.
"It's frightening to watch,"
Wolfers said. "We were all sur
prised by how large the negative
effects of war are."
The article's approach attract
ed immediate media attention,
including a New York Times
story the day after its publication
online. When asked if the article
had incited controversy, Wolfers
replied, "War itself is controver
sial."
"It's true that our estimate [of
a $1.1 trillion loss] is one of the
most pessimistic," he continued.
"But it's important to point out
that this is what the stock market
thinks about the value of war,
not what we personally think."
Freshman Justy Burdick was
surprised by the authors' estimate,
but thought the war might be
worth it after all.
"If this war manages to avoid
another September 11 th-like at
tack, it will in the end be cost-effec
tive," Burdick said.
The authors are considering
doing a follow-up article.
