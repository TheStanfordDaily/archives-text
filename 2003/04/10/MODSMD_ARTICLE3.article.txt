# Betting exchange used to calculate war costs
## GSB profs show that war may cost $1.1 trillion of U.S. wealth 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Graduate
School of Business and Harvard
say that their predictions about the
negative impact war would have
on the international economy are
beginning to prove true.

This past Feb
ruary, Justin
Wolfers and Eric
Zitzewitz of the
Business School
and Andrew
Leigh, a doctoral
student at Har
vard, co-au
thored the 45-

page article "What do Financial
Markets Think of War in Iraq?" In
it, they analyze market data to ap
proximate the costs of war in the
Middle East.
By mid-March, the authors
wrote, 95 percent of the war's ef
fect on the U.S. economy would be
known. They estimated that $1.1
trillion of the nation's wealth
would disappear.
Much of the novelty of the ap

proach is derived from the use of
"Saddam Security," an online bet
ting exchange that pays $10 per
share if Saddam is ousted by June
30, 2003.
The authors observed that oil
prices closely follow Saddam Secu
rity, suggesting that the war raises
oil prices by approximately $10
per barrel. They note that markets
predict that these disruptions will
dissipate, with prices returning to
pre-war levels within about a year
and a half.
By analyzing option prices,
the authors have come up with a
range of different scenarios for
the effects that war will have on
the economy: There is a 70 per
cent probability it will lead to
market declines of zero to 15 per
cent, a 20 percent chance of 15 to
30 percent declines and a 10 per
cent risk of a fall of more than 30
percent.
The article points out that the
economic impacts of war are not
confined to the United States.
Leigh, Wolfers and Zitzewitz ana
lyzed the stock markets in 44 dif
ferent countries. They found (hat
countries most likely to be serious
ly impacted are those that import
large quantities of oil or are en
meshed in the world economy.
