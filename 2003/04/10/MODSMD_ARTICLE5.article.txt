# Reno encourages service
## Former attorney general speaks about rewards of job and shares views on politics 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Former Attorney General Janet Reno
fondly recalled her years in public service in a
far-ranging retrospective she gave last night
to a full audience at Kresge Auditorium.
Reno emphasized the rewards service
brings in encouraging all students — regard
less of their eventual goal — to go into public
service, at least fora time.
"I urge all of you to consider public service
at some point in your life," she said. "I find no
opportunity, no calling that can match it."
Reno spoke of her tenure as the longest
serving attorney general since the Civil War
with few regrets, accepting responsibility for
her decisions ranging from Waco to the Elian
Gonzalez case. She explained these milestones
in her career as justified decisions based on
what she considered correct at the time, and
she stood by her actions.
On the Gonzalez case, she said that her de
cision came down to reuniting a family.
"I thought that the little boy should be
with his daddy," she said.
And she said it was difficult dealing with
the wide range of opinions on the issue.
"Public service can be rough," she noted,

"but it can be as rewarding as it can be
rough."
Hesitating at times, with frequently trem
bling hands clue to Parkinson's Disease, Reno
nonetheless spoke forcefully for over an
hour.
She spoke of her career lighting discrimi
nation against women, working for law and
order and trying to improve local and na
tional governance.
" If you see a system broken, try to fix it and
don't give up," she said.
Reno spoke of her own history, telling how
she lost her first election in 1972 and briefly
touching on the 2002 Florida Gubernatorial
Democratic primary, which she lost.
A fellow politician taught her to always talk
straight and do the right thing.
"Don't pussyfoot, don't equivocate ... and
you'll wake up the next morning feeling good
about yourself," she said.
If she went back to last year's election, she
said she would focus less on fundraising and
more on grassroots campaigning. Still, she
said, "I'm very glad I did it."
At the same time, Reno spoke of broader
political issues, centering on how the United
States needs to do a better job investing in its
future.
"We would rather wait for the crisis to
occur than do something now," she said.
"Nowhere is this as clear as how we treat our
children."

Former Attorney General Janet Reno spoke to a full Kresge Auditorium last
night about her experience working in American politics, the decisions
she made while in office and the rewards of a career in public service.
Though she made few specific
policy points, she called for more
health care for children, a larger
investment in early-childhood
programs and a concerted effort to
make sure every child had a home.
"Let's start making these invest
ments in our children," she said.
Responding to questions from
the audience, Reno addressed her
disagreements with the current
administration.
"It is imperative that while we
defend our national security, we
defend our civil liberties as well,"
she said.
She noted that while she was in

office, Congress finally authorized
reparations for interned Japanese-
Americans during World War 11.
"Nothing will ever correct the
mistake that was made," she said.
"Let's do it right the first time."
She said that if she were attor
ney general, she would not hold
suspects incommunicado, and she
would have brought Congress into
the justice proc ess more frequent
ly-
On the subject of the war with
Iraq, she spoke neither for nor
against it, but instead told students
to make their voices heard.
"You need to not stand by; [you
need] to speak out," she said.
Reno emphasized that while
she never made decisions based on
polls, she considered the people to
be the best judges of policy.

"Trust the people," she said.
"Most human beings want to do
what's right."
Reno emphasized how every
one should both experience public
service and participate in the elec
toral process.
"Something is happening to the
nation when only 20 to 30 percent
of people elect representatives,"
she said.
But Reno focused as much on
her own family as national democ
racy, and she concluded with a
heartfelt tribute. "Remember the
people that love you. They are the
most important in your life."
After the speech, freshman Luis
Vertiz commented, "It was inspir
ing to see someone reach out to
young people and speak of public
service as a career."
