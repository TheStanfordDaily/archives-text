# Reno encourages service
## Former attorney general speaks about rewards of job and shares views on politics 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Former Attorney General Janet Reno
fondly recalled her years in public service in a
far-ranging retrospective she gave last night
to a full audience at Kresge Auditorium.
Reno emphasized the rewards service
brings in encouraging all students — regard
less of their eventual goal — to go into public
service, at least fora time.
"I urge all of you to consider public service
at some point in your life," she said. "I find no
opportunity, no calling that can match it."
Reno spoke of her tenure as the longest
serving attorney general since the Civil War
with few regrets, accepting responsibility for
her decisions ranging from Waco to the Elian
Gonzalez case. She explained these milestones
in her career as justified decisions based on
what she considered correct at the time, and
she stood by her actions.
On the Gonzalez case, she said that her de
cision came down to reuniting a family.
"I thought that the little boy should be
with his daddy," she said.
And she said it was difficult dealing with
the wide range of opinions on the issue.
"Public service can be rough," she noted,

"but it can be as rewarding as it can be
rough."
Hesitating at times, with frequently trem
bling hands clue to Parkinson's Disease, Reno
nonetheless spoke forcefully for over an
hour.
She spoke of her career lighting discrimi
nation against women, working for law and
order and trying to improve local and na
tional governance.
" If you see a system broken, try to fix it and
don't give up," she said.
Reno spoke of her own history, telling how
she lost her first election in 1972 and briefly
touching on the 2002 Florida Gubernatorial
Democratic primary, which she lost.
A fellow politician taught her to always talk
straight and do the right thing.
"Don't pussyfoot, don't equivocate ... and
you'll wake up the next morning feeling good
about yourself," she said.
If she went back to last year's election, she
said she would focus less on fundraising and
more on grassroots campaigning. Still, she
said, "I'm very glad I did it."
At the same time, Reno spoke of broader
political issues, centering on how the United
States needs to do a better job investing in its
future.
"We would rather wait for the crisis to
occur than do something now," she said.
"Nowhere is this as clear as how we treat our
children."
