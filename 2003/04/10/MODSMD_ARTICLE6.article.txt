Walter Hewlett, chairman of the

to Stanford's Board of Trustees on Mon
day. He is currently the director of the
Center for Computer-Assisted Research
in the Humanities and has long been as

variety of councils and boards.
"I'm delighted at Walter being in
volved," said board Chairman Isaac
Stein. "I think Stanford has been very
fortunate to have his involvement in past

years. He is the chairman of the Hewlett
Foundation and they have been enor
mously helpful supporters of Stanford
and its programs for years."
Stein said that Hewlett's role on the
board had not yet been defined but
would probably continue in the same
vein as his earlier involvement with the
University.
"People do generally serve on a vari
ety of committees, and perhaps most im
portantly, most trustees are engaged in
other parts of the University," he said.
"Walter, for example, has been very in
volved in the humanities and he would
continue to have that involvement."

Hewlett was invited to join the board
by the trustees' nominating committee,
one of two processes for selecting the 30
to 35 trustees that normally sit on the
board.
"There is a process by which we have
an alumni association nominating com
mittee [that] workjs] with our nominat
ing committee every two and a half years
to elect a group of four trustees," Stein
explained. "The balance of the trustees,
which is the majority of the trustees, are
elected by our board with our nominat
ing committee conducting a continuous

ond method. He has earned mas
ter's degrees in engineering sci
ence and operations research
