# FinAid Office to leave Old Union
## 
### MARK DOMINIK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In order to open up more central-campus space to
student groups, the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion and the Financial Aid Office will be moving from
their current homes in Old Union to new offices in the
Bakewell Building, across the street from the Arrilla
ga Alumni Center.
While some have expressed concern that moving
the building far from the center of campus will make
the office too detached from students, University ad
ministrators have said that efforts to put most finan
cial aid functions online will reduce the need for stu
dents to come to the office in person.
Renovations required to make the Bakewell Build
ing viable for the two organizations will take until
about 2006 to complete. At that time, the offices will
move out of Old Union and a two-year renovation can
begin to transform the office space of Old Union into
new space for student activities.
"Fundamentally, we have a desire to address stu
dent activities and the need for student activities is a
priority for the provost," said Robert Reidy, vice
provost for land and buildings. "We recognize that
there is a dire need for space. When we look at the op
portunities to handle that, we see the center of stu
dent life at Old Union.
"It is better to make Old Union more centered on
students. Yes, financial aid and admissions are sort of
student support services, but we're looking to revital
ize the Old Union area along with White Plaza and
Tresidder."
Chris Bruner, a junior, said he was enthusiastic
about the proposed expansion of student space on
campus, btit had some reserva
tions about moving the Financial
Aid Office far from the center of
student activities.
"It is nice to have a centralized
location for student groups," he
said. "We don't have anything like
that now.
"But it's unfortunate that the
Financial Aid Office is moving so
far away."
Sophomore Joey Natoli, the
communications director for the
ASSU Executive Cabinet, said that
the new student space freed up in
central campus by the office moves
would be an invaluable asset for
the Stanford community.
"However, the net result of the
trade-off between the added stu
dent space and the increased dis
tance to the Financial Aid Office
has yet to be determined," he said.
"I hope that student groups
are allotted space in Old Union
in a transparent process based
on merit and need," he added.
Earl Dowling, the director of
Financial Aid, said that he hopes
to expand the office's support
services to students transition
ing from high school to college
when the move takes place and
that his office is targeting ways to
eliminate the need for students
to come into the office to handle
financial aid problems. Al
though the Bakewell Building is
farther from the center of cam
pus, putting the financial aid
process online should negate
most negative effects of this
move, he said.
"When you want to buy an air
line ticket, why should I ask you to
travel to the United ticket counter
at the San Jose Airport when you
can get it online, when you can do
it whenever you want to do busi
ness?" Dowling said.
"That is the financial aid envi

ronment we're striving for here —
for students to be able to do busi
ness when they want to do busi
ness, not when we want them to do
business."
Dowling said that his office is
working toward a paperless work
environment in which students
will be able to complete all forms
online. His stall is creating part
nerships with Student Account
Services and with the PLUS loan
guarantor in order to eliminate
student paperwork.
"We need to have all forms that
are required and /or necessary
available on the Web," he said.
"We're almost there, but we're not
there completely."
Combating the reasons stu
dents have problems with financial
aid is a priority for Dowling. He
said that he believes that student
concerns are most effectively ad
dressed when staff treats the prob
lems, not the symptoms.
"If students are having prob
lems with the system, then I'd sug
gest, let's fix the system. If there is
a reason why students have the
need to visit the campus office,
then let's try to address that need.
To me, it's more important that
we address the system and identi
fy why students are having the
problem in the first place," he
said.
Dowling hopes that the new lo
cation of the Financial Aid Office
will increase its visibility and acces
sibility to new students, especially
those who are the first generation
in their family to attend college
and those from lower-income
backgrounds.
"If we are going to ensure
that students and families have
not only knowledge but the best
knowledge about the availability
of scholarships and low-interest
loans, then I think it is impor
tant for the Financial Aid staff to
be near them to reinforce the
partnership that we have in
making their transition possi
ble," he said.

trade-off between the added stu
dent space and the increased dis
tance to the Financial Aid Office
has yet to be determined," he said.
"I hope that student groups
are allotted space in Old Union
in a transparent process based
on merit and need," he added.
Earl Dowling, the director of
Financial Aid, said that he hopes
to expand the office's support
services to students transition
ing from high school to college
when the move takes place and
that his office is targeting ways to
eliminate the need for students
to come into the office to handle
financial aid problems. Al
though the Bakewell Building is
farther from the center of cam
pus, putting the financial aid
process online should negate
most negative effects of this
move, he said.
"When you want to buy an air
line ticket, why should I ask you to
travel to the United ticket counter
at the San Jose Airport when you
can get it online, when you can do
it whenever you want to do busi
ness?" Dowling said.
"That is the financial aid envi

ronment we're striving for here —
for students to be able to do busi
ness when they want to do busi
ness, not when we want them to do
business."
Dowling said that his office is
working toward a paperless work
environment in which students
will be able to complete all forms
online. His stall is creating part
nerships with Student Account
Services and with the PLUS loan
guarantor in order to eliminate
student paperwork.
"We need to have all forms that
are required and /or necessary
available on the Web," he said.
"We're almost there, but we're not
there completely."
Combating the reasons stu
dents have problems with financial
aid is a priority for Dowling. He
said that he believes that student
concerns are most effectively ad
dressed when staff treats the prob
lems, not the symptoms.
"If students are having prob
lems with the system, then I'd sug
gest, let's fix the system. If there is
a reason why students have the
need to visit the campus office,
then let's try to address that need.
To me, it's more important that
we address the system and identi
fy why students are having the
problem in the first place," he
said.
Dowling hopes that the new lo
cation of the Financial Aid Office
will increase its visibility and acces
sibility to new students, especially
those who are the first generation
in their family to attend college
and those from lower-income
backgrounds.
"If we are going to ensure
that students and families have
not only knowledge but the best
knowledge about the availability
of scholarships and low-interest
loans, then I think it is impor
tant for the Financial Aid staff to
be near them to reinforce the
partnership that we have in
making their transition possi
ble," he said.
