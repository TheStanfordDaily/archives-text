## 
### ERIN ARCHERD EDITORIAL STAFF 
This week, the Board of Trustees confirmed
Psychology Prof. Ross as the first appoint
ment to The Stanford Federal Credit Union
Professorship in the School of the Humanities
and Sciences.
Ross' research has been a strong influence in
the field of social psychology. His work on the
Fundamental Attribution Error shows how peo
ple attribute others' behaviors to personal char
acteristics rather than situational factors.
The Credit Union chair was established to
support a faculty member who focuses on public
service and improving the community. Ross' re
search in dispute resolution — examining barri
ers to conflict resolution and techniques for over
coming them — has been applied to interna
tional peace negotiations. He is a co-founder of
the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation
and participated in a conference jointly spon
sored with the Foundation for Global Commu
nity that resulted in a peace agreement between
prominent Israelis and Palestinians. He has also

worked with groups in Northern Ireland.
Sharon Long, dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, was in charge of the appointment.
"I can think of no one more deserving of this
honor than Lee," Long said. "He is an outstand
ing scholar and one of our most distinguished
professors. I am pleased to award this chair to a
faculty member whose contributions benefit us
all."
SCFU Chairman Tim Warner praised Ross'
work 011 campus and internationally.
"Not only is Lee a leader at Stanford, he is a
leader globally. Honoring someone with a com
mitment to building bridges among communi
ties is exactly what we hoped to accomplish in
creating this chair," he said.
Nick Larson, a coterminal student in psychol
ogy who works on conflict mediation and nego
tiation with Ross, feels the research is especially
important given current events worldwide.
"Professor Ross' research examines, amplifies
and aims to more fully understand perspectives
of individuals," Larson said. "This is so vital be
cause it specifically relates to conflict, misunder
standing and general feelings of ill-will between

individuals and groups. With the incredible
work done by Professor Ross, the barriers to con
flict resolution can hopefully be avoided more
and more."
Larson commended Ross for his work outside
the realm of conflict negotiation.
"He has done an enormous amount of work
in the field of social psychology and beyond and
the Stanford community is lucky to have him,"
he said.
Me also emphasized Ross' commitment to stu
dents.
"I chose to work with Professor Ross because
he is such a friendly, caring individual who has
dedicated so much of his life to his students. He
really cares about their projects, as well as his
own, and his infinite hours spent in Jordan Hall
are a testament to that fact," Larson said.
Ross has been a psychology professor at Stan
ford since 1969, when he received his doctorate
from Columbia University. While at Stanford,
Ross has co-authored and co-edited several
books, become a member of the Academy of Arts
and Sciences and received the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching.
