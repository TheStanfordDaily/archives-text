Nederlands Dans Theater
April 25 and 26, 2003 at 8:00 pm
Memorial Auditorium
Young, exuberant, and dynamic, NDT II delivers performances of original work
that are technically precise, impossibly supple, and unabashedly witty. Founded
by Jirf Kylicin in 1978 as a training ground for his main company, Nederlands
Dans Theater I, this classically trained ensemble of young dynamic dancers—
all under the age of 21 —consistently nails complex programs that are often
riskier than those adopted by the main company.
Stanford Student Price: $19/$l6/$l3
