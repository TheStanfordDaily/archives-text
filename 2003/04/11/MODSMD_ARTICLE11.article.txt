## U.S. troops take northern city 
### 
(AP) — Opposition forces crumbled in northern
Iraq yesterday as U.S. and Kurdish troops seized oil
rich Kirkuk without a tight and held a second city
within their grasp. U.S. commanders said signs point
ed to a last stand by Iraqis in Saddam Hussein's birth
place of Tikrit.
Despite the gains, one Marine was killed and 22
injured in a seven-hour battle in the Iraqi capital.
Four more were wounded in a suicide bombing.
"Baghdad's still an ugly place," said Maj. Gen.
Gene Renuart.
Widespread looting persisted 24 hours after the
city celebrated the regime's fall.
Increasingly, the U.S. military focus was away from
the capital. Kurdish troops set off celebrations in
Kirkuk when they moved in, and there were hopes
that Iraqis would surrender in Mosul, another north
ern city, on Friday.
Nearly 100 miles to the north of Baghdad, U.S.
commanders said Tikrit was the likely site of a last
stand by Iraqi forces — if there is to be one. Iraqi de
fenders were believed to have moved there from
other parts of the country. U.S. commandos were in
the region, and warplanes were attacking.
U.S.-led fighters and bombers also hit Iraqi posi
tions near the border with Syria, where special forces
were trying to prevent regime loyalists from slipping

out of Iraq and to keep foreign fighters from entering.
There were signs of difficulties ahead in efforts at
building a new society.
Two Islamic clerics were hacked to death in Najaf
by a furious crowd at one of Shiite Islam's holiest
shrines, witnesses said.
One of the clerics killed, Haider al-Kadar, was a
widely hated loyalist of Saddam, part of the Iraqi
leader's ministry of religion. The other was Abdul
Majid al-Khoei, a high-ranking Shiite cleric and son of
one of the religion's most prominent spiritual leaders,
who was persecuted by Saddam. They were killed at a
meeting meant to serve as a model for reconciliation
in post-Saddam Iraq. The U.S. military had flown in
journalists aboard two helicopters to witness it, al
though they arrived after the violence.
An American plane beamed taped addresses by
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to the Iraqi people. "Your nation will soon be
free," Bush said.
In Washington, one administration official told
Congress the Pentagon envisions parallel ministries
run by Americans and Iraqis after the war until an in
terim government can be established. Paul Wolfowitz,
deputy secretary of defense, offered no timetable for
creation of the interim government or how long U.S.
troops would remain in Iraq.

U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Mischa Brady, 21, of Boise, Idaho, is trailed by Iraqi children as he walks down a street on
patrol in Baghdad yesterday. Brady, of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, was surprised by the reception.
"I was expecting people to be shooting," he said. "But instead, I had people running out telling me they love me."
