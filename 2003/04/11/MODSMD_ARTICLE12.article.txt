# Tax compromise elusive
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Top con
gressional Republicans hunted for sup
port yesterday from pivotal moderate
senators fora retooled House-Senate
budget deal that could pave the way for
passage this year of up to $550 billion in
tax cuts through 2013.
GOP leaders reshaped their plan a
day after the Senate parliamentarian
ruled that under their initial budget, it
would take 60 Senate votes — a virtually
insurmountable margin for Republicans
— for future tax cuts exceeding $350 bil
lion. President Bush wants $726 billion
in cuts, including eliminating individu
als' taxes on corporate dividends and ac
celerating scheduled income tax reduc
tions.
The House planned to stay late yester
day to debate and vote on the retooled
budget. "We're doing the budget
tonight," said House Majority Leader
Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
The search fora budget deal came as
lawmakers also tried reaching a House-
Senate compromise on a near $80 billion
measure paying the first bills for the Iraq
war and other U.S. efforts against ter
rorism. GOP leaders hope to push both
measures through Congress by today,
when lawmakers are scheduled to begin
a two-week spring break.

The leaders of both GOP-controlled
chambers, however, have been focused
on passing a final $2.2 trillion budget for
2004. Republicans want the measure to
embrace as much of Bush's tax cut as
possible, arguing that his plan would
give the flagging economy a jolt.
Underscoring GOP frustration, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Republicans be
lieved Senate parliamentarian Alan Fru
min "shifted positions... in what ap
pears to be under pressure" after earlier
telling GOP aides his ruling would be fa
vorable to them.
"You know what happened to the last
parliamentarian who did that. I fired
him," he said.
Congress' budget sets revenue and
spending totals for the year, but can also
give later tax cut bills procedural protec
tions so they need only 51 votes to pass
the 100-member Senate. They otherwise
could need 60 votes to prevail over op
position Democrats, who say the cuts
would only deepen budget deficits be
yond the record $300 billion-plus annu
al shortfalls now expected.
Despite the importance of Bush's tax
plan to his agenda, Senate Republicans
have only been able to muster 48 votes
— including one Democrat — for tax
cuts exceeding $350 billion.
