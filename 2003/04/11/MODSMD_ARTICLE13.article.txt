# Supersonic jet retired after 25 years

LONDON (AP) —The supersonic jet
set has been bumped. The Concorde, the
needle-nosed aircraft for the rich, is retir
ing after a quarter-century of ostenta
tiously expensive service.
Yesterday's decision by British Airways
and Air France means the end of an era in
aviation. The Concorde is the world's only
supersonic passenger jet. Only 20 were
built, with 12 remaining in service, all op
erated by the two companies.
"Never has such a beautiful object been
designed and built by man," said Air
France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta at a
news conference.
"This aircraft is not going to stop be
cause it continues to live on in the human
imagination."
When it made its debut in 197(5, the
Concorde aspired to be the future of the
aviation industry. But it was never a com
mercial success. In recent years it has
struggled even more due to the global
economic downturn, the impact of the
Sept. 11 attacks on air travel, and a horrif
ic crash in July 2000 that severely tar
nished the plane's safety record.
Beverly Shenstone, technical director
of British Overseas Airways Corp., prede
cessor of British Airways, once called Con

corde "the largest, most expensive and
most dubious project ever undertaken in
the development of civil aircraft."
No country would permit it to tly over
land at supersonic speeds because of loud
engines, curbing its versatility. And be
cause the fuel-guzzling Concorde carries
just 100 passengers, it's less economical
than a jumbo jet.
It was a spectacularly wrong turn by
Europe's aerospace industry, which went
for speed while allowing Boeing and
other American manufacturers to domi
nate the lucrative market for the big sub
sonic jets that have made air travel a mass
phenomenon.
Nonetheless, the Concorde conferred
unmatched prestige on British Airways
and Air France, and the glamour of a glitzy
passenger list that included Elizabeth Tay
lor, Madonna and Queen Elizabeth 11.
Fora quarter century, business execu
tives and stars asserted their status by
boarding the delta-winged marvel, a
product of 1960s technology and opti
mism, happily spending thousands more
dollars to save a few hours.
"Flying at twice the speed of sound
gives you a buzz," rock star Sting, a regu
lar fiver for two decades, once said. "I'm

still excited about going on Concorde
even after all these years."
The speedy Concorde flies from Eu
rope to New York in under four hours. Its
fastest crossing was completed in just 2
hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds.
Celebrity antics on the supersonic jets
are guaranteed to make headlines. Mo
town diva Diana Ross was led oil a Con
corde by police at London's Heathrow
Airport in 1999 after an altercation with a
security guard.
That same year, Hollywood power bro-».
ker Harvey Weinstein was fined $320
after being caught smoking in a Concorde
toilet. In a letter to the court, Weinstein
said he was "an extremely nervous travel
er."
Air France blamed the Concorde's
demise on falling passenger revenue and
rising maintenance costs but it was the
crash in Paris on July 25, 2000, that prob
ably sealed its fate.
Since then, there have been several
small but well-publicized mishaps, both
with Concordes owned by British Airways
and Air France. Spinetta said Concorde
was filling 60-70 percent of its seats right
after flights resumed, but that has since
dropped to 20 percent.
