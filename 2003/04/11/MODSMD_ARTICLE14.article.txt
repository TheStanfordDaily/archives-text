For many Stanford community mem
bers, this appeared to be an odd knee-jerk
reaction to a pressing, but ill-understood
international health threat. While general
consensus on campus supports the Uni
versity taking precautionary measures to
ward SARS containment, many students
are wary that the University has made a
rash decision in forcing these students to
move out of their current residences. Fur
thermore, we wish to stress the need for
the University to be upfront and honest
with the community as it carries out its
precautionary measures — leaving any
one "out of the loop" in times of potential
emergency can only make those involved

anxious or angry.
Severe Acute Res
piratory Syndrome
— marked by a high
fever, dry cough, and
other flu-like symp
toms — is said to
have originated in
Guangdong
Province of China

last November and, by nature, is a com
municable virus. Besides being conta
gious and having no known cure, most
scientists have not yet even identified its
cause. Just yesterday several research
teams claim to have identified the virus as
a relative of the common cold. SARS in
fection cases could be anywhere between
1,800 and 3,000 worldwide and death
tolls fall between 110 and 190. So far, nine
cases of infection have been reported in
Santa Clara County, but there have been
no reported U.S. deaths.
Given such uncertain knowledge about
SARS' nature and whereabouts, we
should all concern ourselves with contain
ing its spread. Although there have been
no deaths in the United States, Califor
nia's proximity to Asia and its function as
a stopover for travelers going to and from
Asia makes caution especially relevant for
California residents. It is for this reason
that we expect extra competence and pro
fessionalism from University housing di
rectors and staff in their decisions about
how to protect our community.

The University has made a rash

their current residences.

events," we are not concerned that the
University is trying to ensure the health of
the entire student body at the expense of
inconveniencing a few students. But we
are concerned that the University chose to
clear out the quarantine residents on such
sort notice; that some students were asked
to move out before even being reassigned
to new housing; that University officials
only chose to notify residents via e-mail
and without notifying the resident fellows,
RAs, or other residents of Murray and
Yost; and that the University was secretive
in the manner of decision-making and of
hiding plans from the Stanford communi
ty. These oversights reflect a lack of trans
parency on the part of University deci
sion-makers, which has only served to fur
ther alarm the community.
While their decision-making process in
this instance appears poorly thought-out,
University officials could have compensat-

Ed for their need to
make a rushed deci
sion by communicat
ing earlier with the
affected students. A
method of shared re
sponsibility for prob
lem-solving would
have allowed stu-

dents to point out issues in the eviction
process that the decision-makers were
more likely to overlook.
Now that the concept of a SARS quar
antine on Stanford's campus has become
public knowledge, the community is slow
ly being brought up to speed about the
University's emergency containment
plans. Jane Camarillo, director of Resi
dential Education, and Ira Friedman, di
rector of Vaden Student Health Center,
met exclusively with Murray and Yost res
idents Monday night to share what they
knew about the precautionary measures,
and this meeting was just a small step to
ward including and informing the Stan
ford community about the possible SARS
quarantine.
It is in times of potential emergency
that we most need University measures to
be well-thought-out and well-communi
cated. We also realize that student and
community voice can only help in the de
cision-making processes. We hope that in
the future Housing Services, Student Life,
Vaden, Residential Education, and Stu
dent Affairs representatives, as well as the
University as a whole, will prioritize com
munication with students and community
members as it makes decisions on issues of
such gravity.
