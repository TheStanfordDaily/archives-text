# ANIMAL FARM
## ASSU must rise to the occasion 
### 
Stanford students are famil
iar with the high level of
competition at our school.
I'm not talking about tra
ditional cut-throat competition —
like ripping pages out of library
books so classmates will fail Chem
33. We leave that to our col
leagues back east.
The competition I'm talking
about is how hard it is to get ac
cepted into anything, academic or
extracurricular, at Stanford. Acap
pella groups, Sophomore College
and Sierra Camp all have ridicu
lously low acceptance rates. Forget
about playing on a varsity sports
team if you didn't don multiple All-
American awards in high school.
Sometimes it seems like the
easiest part about Stanford is get
ting in.
However, there is one realm
into which this competition hasn't
seeped — student government.
The campaigning and voting pro
cesses of the past two weeks reflect
the general apathy toward stu
dent representation.
The lack of competition is most
striking when you look at the
numbers of candidates running
for the various offices. Only two
slates battled it out for the roles of
ASSU president and vice presi
dent, arguably the most powerful
student positions on this campus.
That means that each group had
a 50 percent chance of winning.
Why didn't anyone else step up to
the plate?
Sitting at my laptop, as I
scrolled down the ballot, I strug
gled over which 15 people to pick
for the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate. I knew one guy running,
and I recognized a few other
names from their witty campaign
slogans. But many of the names I
had never seen before. I hadn't
noticed a single flier endorsing
their campaigns. Did these peo

pie really think it was unnecessary
to campaign to get this powerful
role? Couldn't they have stuck
even one flier in my bathroom?
I guess they didn't need to
lobby that hard. With 28 students
running for 15 slots, the accep
tance rate was just under 54 per
cent.
I think this disinterest in run
ning for student leadership posi-

tions comes from
a lack of respect
for the ASSU in
general. Most
students don't
know much
about the ASSU
and what, or if, it
does something
for them. In the

abstract, the ASSU is an incredibly
powerful organization. The Uni
versity administration recognizes
the ASSU as the legitimate leaders
of the student body. Whether or
not this is the case in practice is
another question.
There is one place where
healthy competition still exists —
the race for class presidents.
There were four slates running
for senior class presidents, and
each one was qualified, experi
enced and enthusiastic. My class
presidents, over the past two
years, have successfully orga
nized CoHo nights, speaker
events and formals that have all
directly enhanced the quality of
life for the student body. Because
class presidents in the past have
been able to produce tangible re
sults, students continue to run
for this privilege.
As for the ASSU, it's not that it
doesn't do anything to improve
student life on the Farm. ASSU of
ficers have an amazing amount of
power to effect change at Stanford
— and maybe they actually do it. I
work for the ASSU Bank, so I'm in

their office all the time. I see the
immense time commitment of
holding office, and the money that
flows from the ASSU funds to ben
efit student organizations.
Even still, I don't really know
what the ASSU does. The average
Stanford student has no idea what
they actually do. The ASSU is an
insular organization with very lit
tle transparency. It disappears
from campus life and reemerges
only around election time.
All of the candidates in this
year's election identified a few is
sues that they would work on next
year. Student space, diversity and
cost of living all seemed to be cen
tral to the debates. Sure, these are
all problems, but can the ASSU
really make laundry free? I would
love it if they could, but I have a
sneaking suspicion that they
can't. Maybe the ASSU represen
tatives should concentrate on is
sues more feasible to resolve in
their one year tenure.
And try as I might to remem
ber the "issues" of last year's elec
tion and how the ASSU dealt with
them, I can't. I can't even remem
ber who I voted for ASSU presi
dent last year.
The whole election process
leaves a less-than-indelible mark
on my memory. The ASSU leaves
a less-than-indelible mark on my
life. Or at least that's what it seems
like to me.
To all the student leaders, I
commend you for running, be
cause I wouldn't have the courage
to do it. But with this incredible
privilege that many of you re
ceived relatively effortlessly
comes a responsibility to change
this campus. You have the power
to do it. Now prove to all of us you
are worthy.

Prove me wrong, ASSU. E-mail me at
