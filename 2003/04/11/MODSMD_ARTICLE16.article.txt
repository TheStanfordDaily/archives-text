The Daily's special-fee endorsements
are partisan, lack objectivity
•
I am continually shocked at how The
Lfaily — a group that is requesting a spe
cial fee — can use its media power to in
fluence how students vote for special fees.
No one ever questions the irony and lack
of objectivity of The Daily's coverage of
the special fees process. Journalistic in
tegrity would seem to demand objective
polling or a campus wide review commit
tee to assess all special fee groups, includ
ing The Daily.
'The partisan political beliefs of the
Djiily editorial staff have been reflected in
every election review process. It is not
strange that when you have a conservative
editorial staff all special-fee groups that re
flect anything beyond the mainstream are
frowned upon. Likewise, when there is
staff that is pro-technology or pro-com
rrhinity service, the special-fee groups who
reflect these preferences are given high
praise. If The Daily is a student newspaper
then this type of biased, partisan lobbying
should not be allowed to continue. The
funny part is that most of this biased re
porting is financed by many of the stu

dents that The Daily unfairly assess.
I am saddened by this fact and appalled
that organizations who have historically
contributed to the vitality and advance
ment of the University are judged by an
ever-shifting political machine. It would ap
pear that those groups have earned a spe
cial fee for numerous years are doing some
thing beneficial for the campus — other
wise our intelligent student body would not
continue to support them. The Daily owes
us a more objective election review process
and the truth about how they themselves
have managed to operate in the red despite
receiving a lofty special fee last year.

World Refugee Leadership Program
provides education to
Botswanan refugees
In light of The Daily's failure to endorse
the World Refugee Leadership Program's
special-fee request, we wanted to provide
students with the following clarification.
WRLP is a diverse and growing (cur
rently there are 40 members) student
group working to provide support for the
academic education of refugee students in
the Dukwi Refugee Camp in Botswana.

Over spring break, members of our
group went to this refugee camp to talk
with the students, learn about their goals
and needs and to find concrete ways of
how to address them. Specifically, the stu
dents in this camp strive to go to universi
ties, which will allow them to live a life sup
porting themselves and pursuing their
own passions. We will assist them in reach
ing their goals by setting up an online tu
toring program through which Stanford
students will tutor refugee students in sub
jects such as English and math (which
count towards their university admission
exams) and will help them set up an online
store to sell their art in order to fundraise
university scholarships.

The Daily's endorsements of Solar Car
ana SURJ reflect 'ignorance'
and 'misunderstanding'
I am writing in response to The Stan
ford Daily's special-fee endorsements. I
am writing this article to appear after elec
tions have finished, as I am unable to
speak with great authority on most of the
student groups campaigning for special
fees. However, in the case of two groups to

which 1 belong — the Stanford Solar Car
Project and the Stanford Undergraduate
Research Journal — I can say that The
Daily's statements reflect an ignorance of
the groups represented as well as a misun
derstanding of the purpose and usefulness
of ASSU special fees. While The Daily was
obviously well-intentioned in publishing
recommendations and the idea of further
ing campus dialogue on the elections is a
good one, the endorsements do the stu
dent body a disservice when they are not
adequately researched.
The Daily suggests in its descriptions of
the Stanford Solar Car and Stanford Un
dergraduate Research Journal that both
groups look elsewhere for funding. If The
Daily's editorial board had bothered to fa
miliarize itself at all with either group's bud
get, it would realize that both have looked
into as many alternative sources of funding
as possible. The Solar Car's costs are far
more than the $36,000 we request from
special fees; in fact, building the car costs up
to half a million dollars. Almost all of its
funding comes from the corporate spon
sors like the ones The Daily recommends.
Similarly, The Daily recommends that
SURj look into funding from the Under
graduate Research Programs office. The
Daily is apparently unaware that we are
seeking funds from that office as well as in

dividual departments and other sources.
The Daily's endorsements reflect a lack of
knowledge of the costs of making a com
petitive solar car or high-quality research
journal and indicate no effort to find out
what separate efforts these groups make to
find funding.
The endorsements also indicate a mis
understanding of why groups apply for
and should receive special fees. The Daily
explained that it only endorsed groups
that "are open to and benefit a large por
tion of the student body," which perhaps
explains why most of their endorsements
were publications and cultural groups.
SI'RJ is a publication that is distributed on
campus and directly benefits its readers
and published authors. While the Solar
Car project may not directly benefit many
students, it (and similar student groups not
endorsed by the Daily like Mock Trial and
Stanford Archery Club) provide invaluable
indirect benefits to the student body.
The availability of many specialized
groups like this allows students the op
portunity to gain valuable hands-on ex
perience in a particular field. These
groups complement the classroom expe
rience at Stanford and are one of the
major strengths of the University. If they
