## Symbols must be protected by the First Amendment, too 
### CHRIS GUZELIAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
There's a Virginia law that makes it a
felony to burn a cross publicly or on an
other person's property with the intent of
intimidating any person or group. In re
cent years, three separate groups of white
supremacists were tried and convicted
under the statute. This past Monday, in
the case Virginia vs. Black, the U.S.
Supreme Court decreed that Virginia may
indeed outlaw such "cross burning with
intent to intimidate" consistent with First
Amendment principles.
"Bravo!" you shout. And your approval
is understandable. The burning cross, no
doubt, has stood as a singularly reviled
symbol of terror, particularly for blacks in
tlie American south, for 150 years. But
consider the broader implications of the
Court's decision. If 75 percent of a Vir
ginia jury decides a certain symbol (in this

instance, a burning cross) is intimidating,
that symbolic speech is left unprotected
under the First Amendment.
To be sure, there is no right in this coun
try to use intimidating and threatening
words. You can't make a verbal or written
assassination threat against the president,
no matter how much you dislike his for
eign policy. Challenging someone earnest
ly to a physical fight is punishable. Order
ing followers in a cult to kill non-believers is
incitement to violence, also a no-no.
But here's why Virginia vs. Black
makes a horrific turn for the worse in free
speech law: For the first time, the Court
has decided that a symbol (not words, but
a symbol) can be punished as a felony if 75
percent of a Virginia jury says that an in
dividual's use of that symbol was intended
solely to intimidate someone.
Even when a threat is made with words,
we don't convict people automatically.
Even with words (which are way, way, way

better indicia of intent than are symbols), a
jury often has to consider whether a defen
dant intended to threaten. If I say, "I'm
going to kill the president," the text is quite
clear. But my intent might not be. Was I
joking? Was I so drunk that 1 couldn't form
a serious intent? Did I know that other peo
ple were listening? Context matters. And
juries struggle deliberating such matters.
Symbols are infinitely more ambiguous
than words. There's no way to separate an
unprotected intent to intimidate cleanly
from a protected message like "up with
white supremacy!" that 75 percent of an
average jury just plain detests. Virginia v.
Black means juries will become the ulti
mate free speech fortune-tellers. Of the in
finite possible reasons that a symbol could
be employed, the jury will say whether
your use of a symbol stood only for intimi
dation. And the risk the Court has failed to
confront is that juries will be tempted to
improperly indict people for unpopular

principles — white supremacy, for in
stance — under the auspices of a sup
posed threat.
So next time a Klansman only wants to
demonstrate white supremacy "solidarity"
by burning a cross and not to intimidate
blacks, he better think twice before he risks
a jail term (or perhaps he should just
adopt a new symbol, like a burning hoop,
until that gets outlawed too). Next time
President George W. Bush flashes his
three-fingered "W" salute, perhaps the
County of Los Angeles should put it to a
jury whether W. was hawking an intimi
dating "West-Side" gang symbol. Next
time a Navajo Indian displays a swastika in
front of his house to wish prosperity and
health to his neighbors, and a next-door
Holocaust survivor is intimidated, we
might learn from the majority of a jury
that the Navajo was a budding fascist. Or
next June 29, when a Catholic publicly
places an inverted cross in honor of St.

Peter's Day, a jury in a municipality with a
ban on intimidating use of pagan symbols
might just decide that our pious Catholic is
actually a felonious witch.
Voltaire said, "1 may disagree with what
you say, but I will defend to the death your
right to say it." No decent American stands
for the Klan's principles. But tomorrow,
maybe, just maybe, your municipality will
ban the unpopular symbol that you tote.
And if 75 percent of the society that you
live in doesn't like that message, even if you
didn't mean to intimidate, away you go to
San Quentin on a cozy one to five year sen
tence. And then you too will be a symbol —
a class 6 felony symbol, to be more pre
cise— of a society that seems to be forget
ting what the First Amendment symbolizes.

three-fingered "W" salute, perhaps the
County of Los Angeles should put it to a
jury whether W. was hawking an intimi
dating "West-Side" gang symbol. Next
time a Navajo Indian displays a swastika in
front of his house to wish prosperity and
health to his neighbors, and a next-door
Holocaust survivor is intimidated, we
might learn from the majority of a jury
that the Navajo was a budding fascist. Or
next June 29, when a Catholic publicly
places an inverted cross in honor of St.

Peter's Day, a jury in a municipality with a
ban on intimidating use of pagan symbols
might just decide that our pious Catholic is
actually a felonious witch.
Voltaire said, "1 may disagree with what
you say, but I will defend to the death your
right to say it." No decent American stands
for the Klan's principles. But tomorrow,
maybe, just maybe, your municipality will
ban the unpopular symbol that you tote.
And if 75 percent of the society that you
live in doesn't like that message, even if you
didn't mean to intimidate, away you go to
San Quentin on a cozy one to five year sen
tence. And then you too will be a symbol —
a class 6 felony symbol, to be more pre
cise— of a society that seems to be forget
ting what the First Amendment symbolizes.
