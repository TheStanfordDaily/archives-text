## Card aims to sting Hornets 
### BRETT KAUFMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the month of April began
with a loss for the No. 4 Stanford
baseball team, the Cardinal has re
sponded with four straight wins
and an offensive assault by three
team leaders that is nothing short
of remarkable.
Stanford (20-15, 7-2 Pacific 10
Conference) followed up a sweep
of Washington State with a 17-8
victory over Santa Clara on Tues
day night, now heading into a two
game, home-and-home non-con
ference series with Sacramento
State beginning tonight at Sunken
Diamond.
The Hornets (22-10), now inde
pendent of any conference affilia
tion, are riding a season-high four
game winning streak after a home
sweep of Cal State-Hay ward and a
road win at Nevada earlier this
week. But Sacramento State has
struggled against higher-quality
opponents this season, and the trio
of senior Ryan Garko and juniors
Sam Fuld and Carlos Quentin may
be the best the Hornets will see all
year.
Quentin's 20-game hitting

streak is equally impressive for its
production as its duration. The ju
nior outfielder has a .494 average
with four homers, 14 doubles and
26 RBI during the stretch.
Quentin blasted two home runs
— including a grand slam — and
was just a single short of the cycle
Tuesday night at Santa Clara,
putting up a career night to con
tinue his current streak.
"I was just seeing the ball really
well, and I finally got some in the
air," said Quentin after his six-
RBI, six-run performance. "I was
really happy to see a couple go
over the fence, but as long as I'm
hitting well and helping the team
out that's all that really matters."
The junior now leads the team
in hits (52), doubles (16), walks
(23), extra-base hits (21) and on
base percentage (.535).
Classmate Fuld is enjoying his
own hot stretch, though Tuesday
night's 0-for-4 marked the end of
his 15-game hitting streak. After
struggling to start the season, the
preseason All-American center
fielder has raised his average to a
Cardinal fourth-best .333, with
his 49 hits second only to
Quentin's mark.

Midway through the juniors'
hitting streaks, catcher Garko de
cided to join in on the fun. With his
current season-high nine-game
tear, Garko has grabbed the team
lead in total bases with 87 and has
jumped to second in batting, at
.377.
During the nine games, the
first of which came after a com
bined 0-for-9 in the first two
games of the Arizona State series,
the senior has hit a cosmic .568
with five home runs, five doubles
and 19 RBI. Garko has 42 RBI in
the team's last 25 games and has
been leading the Stanford attack
all season.
"If we're going to be good and
compete for the Pac-10 title, our
older guys are going to need to
play well," said head coach Mark
Marquess.
Offering the understatement of
the season, Marquess added,
"These guys have been doing that
lately."
Even with the scorching Cardi
nal bats, wins have not come easily
for Stanford in recent weeks with
tough games against Washington,

Senior Ryan McCally may be called upon to repeat his performance last season against Sac State — where he
pitched a perfect ninth inning — as the Hornets face off with the Cardinal this weekend.
USF and Washington State. The
Hornets present a decent chal
lenge and will attempt to tame
Quentin and company this week
end.
The first, tonight at 6 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond, will see the
Hornets' Steve Cuckovich take
on Stanford junior John Hud
gins.
Hudgins enters tonight's con
test fresh off his second complete
game of the season, with a late
solo homer all that spoiled the
shutout bid against Washington
State.
The junior has displayed
dominant control all season,
striking out 67 while walking just
15 in his 10 starts. Hudgins has
also lasted at least six innings
each time he has taken the
mound, making it through seven
on six occasions.
Marquess has not named his
starter for tomorrow's 2 p.m.
game at Raley Field, where the
Hornets are 15-4 this season and
have won eight in a row. The
Sacramento State starter will be
Marshall Plouffe, who has a 5-2
record with an impressive 2.92
ERA this season.
