After her performance at this year's In
door National Championship, no list of
the top collegiate women shot putters can
leave off Stanford junior J illian Camarena.
At the championships, Camarena en
tered the final round of the shot put in
fourth.
After fouling on her first attempt in the
finals, Camarena threw for 55 feet, 2.75
inches to move her into third.
Her final throw of 57-2.50 exceeded
her previous indoor best by 20 inches and
broke the great Pam Dukes' long standing
indoor school record by seven inches.
The heave vaulted her comfortably into
second, scoring valuable points in the Car
dinal's sixth place finish at nationals. She
finished behind North Carolina's star
sophomore Laura Gerraughty, who threw
for 59-3.
"I really don't know where that throw
came from," Camarena said. "Robert kept

telling me that a big throw was coming, I
just didn't know when it would happen.
"I was just so relaxed on that final
throw."
Camarena began throwing in seventh
grade by the encouragement of her broth
er and parents.
"I really didn't like it at first," Camare
na said. "I was really into Softball, but by
my junior year of high school, I just start
ed to enjoy it."
Hailing from Woodland, Calif., Ca
marena had always wanted to attend Stan
ford for its beautiful weather and close
proximity to her home. But being coached
by an Olympic thrower in Robert Weir
was a bonus.
"I knew Robert would be good for me,"
Camarena said. "You learn from the ex
perience your coach brings to your train
ing, and Robert has had so many experi
ences at the international level."
As a freshman, Camarena finished
