# Camarena's throws hurl her toward a bright future
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK STAFF WRITER 
After her performance at this year's In
door National Championship, no list of
the top collegiate women shot putters can
leave off Stanford junior J illian Camarena.
At the championships, Camarena en
tered the final round of the shot put in
fourth.
After fouling on her first attempt in the
finals, Camarena threw for 55 feet, 2.75
inches to move her into third.
Her final throw of 57-2.50 exceeded
her previous indoor best by 20 inches and
broke the great Pam Dukes' long standing
indoor school record by seven inches.
The heave vaulted her comfortably into
second, scoring valuable points in the Car
dinal's sixth place finish at nationals. She
finished behind North Carolina's star
sophomore Laura Gerraughty, who threw
for 59-3.
"I really don't know where that throw
came from," Camarena said. "Robert kept

telling me that a big throw was coming, I
just didn't know when it would happen.
"I was just so relaxed on that final
throw."
Camarena began throwing in seventh
grade by the encouragement of her broth
er and parents.
"I really didn't like it at first," Camare
na said. "I was really into Softball, but by
my junior year of high school, I just start
ed to enjoy it."
Hailing from Woodland, Calif., Ca
marena had always wanted to attend Stan
ford for its beautiful weather and close
proximity to her home. But being coached
by an Olympic thrower in Robert Weir
was a bonus.
"I knew Robert would be good for me,"
Camarena said. "You learn from the ex
perience your coach brings to your train
ing, and Robert has had so many experi
ences at the international level."
As a freshman, Camarena finished

Junior Jillian Camarena has been rewriting the record books since her arrival on the
Farm, capping her explosive campaign by breaking the Cardinal record in shot put at In
door Nationals earlier this season.
ninth at the NCAA Championships
and took the gold medal at the Ju
nior Pan American Champi
onships.
Last year, then-sophomore Ca
marena won the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championship and finished
third at NCAAs.
After her second-place finish at
Indoor Nationals this season, Ca
marena is looking towards even
bigger things.
"I definitely feel I have a shot at
the outdoor title," Camarena said.
"I know it's possible to be top
three.
"The competition is getting
stronger in the throws. It's reach
ing a whole new level. I think we
will see some amazing throws at
Sacramento State [the host of this
year's NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships]."
Vin Lananna, director of track
and field, added "Jill has the talent
and drive to be a strong competitor
on the national level. She has the
potential to compete at the inter
national level and at the Olympics
in the future."
As far as distance, Camarena has
a lofty but attainable goal of 60 feet
during the outdoor season, a
major barrier in collegiate shot put
and almost three feet longer than
the current school record.
"Some people will say it isn't
possible," Camarena said. "But I
can see myself doing it, and I
would like to do it before next
year."
Camarena, a 2002 All Pac-10
Academic selection, is a history
major, but admits she really has no
idea what she wants to do after
graduation.
"1 would love to compete after

college, but it's hard doing the
training and finding a good coach.
I am definitely thinking about the
Olympics, hopefully in 2004 in
Athens. It's going to be interest
ing."
This weekend, however, Ca
marena leads a strong group of
women's field athletes to the Cali
fornia-Nevada State Champi
onships hosted by San Diego State.
Camarena will compete in the
shot put and will join Stanford ju
niors Kitty Currier and Molly
Meyer in the discus. The Cardi
nal's pole vault trio of senior Kath
leen Donoghue, junior Leila Ben-
Youssef, and freshman Samantha
Shepard will also be competing.
"Discus is really difficult for
me," Camarena admitted. "I do it
more to get team points at Pac-lOs
and Regionals."
A group of 40 track and field
athletes will also attend the Brutus
Hamilton Invitational across the
bay at California on Saturday.
"We look absolutely great right
now," Lananna said. "I am espe
cially pleased with the progress in
the throwing events. I am also very
confident in the ability of the mid
dle-distance runners to step up
when they have to."
Cardinal freshman Alicia Craig,
a three time All-American, will be
making her outdoor debut at 1,500
meters and is joined by a strong
group of women's and men's mid
dle-distance runners at Cal.
A group of Stanford's multi
event athletes will also be compet
ing in several field and track events
in preparation for the Azusa Pacif
ic Invitational and Mt. San Antonio
College Relays next weekend.
"We are being judicious with
who we race because of the longer
season," Lananna said. "The em
phasis is really getting everyone
ready for the postseason champi
onships."

the throwing events. I am also very
confident in the ability of the mid

After her performance at this year's In
door National Championship, no list of
the top collegiate women shot putters can
leave off Stanford junior J illian Camarena.
At the championships, Camarena en
tered the final round of the shot put in
fourth.
After fouling on her first attempt in the
finals, Camarena threw for 55 feet, 2.75
inches to move her into third.
Her final throw of 57-2.50 exceeded
her previous indoor best by 20 inches and
broke the great Pam Dukes' long standing
indoor school record by seven inches.
The heave vaulted her comfortably into
second, scoring valuable points in the Car
dinal's sixth place finish at nationals. She
finished behind North Carolina's star
sophomore Laura Gerraughty, who threw
for 59-3.
"I really don't know where that throw
came from," Camarena said. "Robert kept

telling me that a big throw was coming, I
just didn't know when it would happen.
"I was just so relaxed on that final
throw."
Camarena began throwing in seventh
grade by the encouragement of her broth
er and parents.
"I really didn't like it at first," Camare
na said. "I was really into Softball, but by
my junior year of high school, I just start
ed to enjoy it."
Hailing from Woodland, Calif., Ca
marena had always wanted to attend Stan
ford for its beautiful weather and close
proximity to her home. But being coached
by an Olympic thrower in Robert Weir
was a bonus.
"I knew Robert would be good for me,"
Camarena said. "You learn from the ex
perience your coach brings to your train
ing, and Robert has had so many experi
ences at the international level."
As a freshman, Camarena finished


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily
Junior Jillian Camarena has been rewriting the record books since her arrival on the
Farm, capping her explosive campaign by breaking the Cardinal record in shot put at In
door Nationals earlier this season.
ninth at the NCAA Championships
and took the gold medal at the Ju
nior Pan American Champi
onships.
Last year, then-sophomore Ca
marena won the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championship and finished
third at NCAAs.
After her second-place finish at
Indoor Nationals this season, Ca
marena is looking towards even
bigger things.
"I definitely feel I have a shot at
the outdoor title," Camarena said.
"I know it's possible to be top
three.
"The competition is getting
stronger in the throws. It's reach
ing a whole new level. I think we
will see some amazing throws at
Sacramento State [the host of this
year's NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships]."
Vin Lananna, director of track
and field, added "Jill has the talent
and drive to be a strong competitor
on the national level. She has the
potential to compete at the inter
national level and at the Olympics
in the future."
As far as distance, Camarena has
a lofty but attainable goal of 60 feet
during the outdoor season, a
major barrier in collegiate shot put
and almost three feet longer than
the current school record.
"Some people will say it isn't
possible," Camarena said. "But I
can see myself doing it, and I
would like to do it before next
year."
Camarena, a 2002 All Pac-10
Academic selection, is a history
major, but admits she really has no
idea what she wants to do after
graduation.
"1 would love to compete after

college, but it's hard doing the
training and finding a good coach.
I am definitely thinking about the
Olympics, hopefully in 2004 in
Athens. It's going to be interest
ing."
This weekend, however, Ca
marena leads a strong group of
women's field athletes to the Cali
fornia-Nevada State Champi
onships hosted by San Diego State.
Camarena will compete in the
shot put and will join Stanford ju
niors Kitty Currier and Molly
Meyer in the discus. The Cardi
nal's pole vault trio of senior Kath
leen Donoghue, junior Leila Ben-
Youssef, and freshman Samantha
Shepard will also be competing.
"Discus is really difficult for
me," Camarena admitted. "I do it
more to get team points at Pac-lOs
and Regionals."
A group of 40 track and field
athletes will also attend the Brutus
Hamilton Invitational across the
bay at California on Saturday.
"We look absolutely great right
now," Lananna said. "I am espe
cially pleased with the progress in
the throwing events. I am also very
confident in the ability of the mid
dle-distance runners to step up
when they have to."
