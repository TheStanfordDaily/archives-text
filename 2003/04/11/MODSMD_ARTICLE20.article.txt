### DEBORAH SPLANSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend takes the No. 16 Cardinal softball team
(30-14,2-4 Pacific-10 Conference) down to the desert for
its first Pac-10 road trip and the greatest challenge the
squad has faced this year.
Stanford will try to add to its three-game winning
streak going into Friday's faceoff against No. 1 Arizona.
The Wildcats secured the top ranking this week fol
lowing a sweep of then-No. 1 UCLA, where Arizona
was led from the circle by freshman hurler Alicia Hol
lo well.
Hollowell was named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week
and Louisville Slugger/NFCA Division I Player of the
Week for her efforts and has a perfect conference
record on the season, having won six while posting
236 strikeouts this year.
Friday night could become a battle of rookies, as the
hot bats of Cardinal freshmen Catalina Morris and
Lauren Lappin will be eager to tarnish Hollowell's
perfect record.
The two college newcomers have skated through
the shift from high school play and are currently lead
ing the Stanford offense.
Morris is filling in the lead-off spot with power and
speed, hitting .352 with nine doubles, three home
runs, 19 RBI and 11 stolen bases. The lefty has also
proven clutch and consistent with two game-winning
hits and an eight-game hitting streak.
Second in the lineup, Lappin is first in most offen
sive categories. The shortstop is batting .392 with 47
hits, a .451 on-base percentage, 14 RBI, and a nine
game hitting streak.
"They are just extremely talented players," coach
John Rittman said. "They have been tremendous for
us and very consistent at the plate."
While Stanford's freshmen have been leading the
team at the plate, its veterans have been guiding the
roster from the rubber.
Senior Tori Nyberg and redshirt junior Dana
Sorensen have combined for 26 of Stanford's victories
and hold a 1.82 and 0.92 FRA over their opponents,

respectively.
Nyberg is boasting a confer
ence-best 9.3 strikeouts-to-walks
ratio currently and will hope to
continue this kind of dominance in
Arizona.
Sorensen has also proven suc
cessful against top competition this

season, pitching a no-hitter against
No. 3 Washington and holding a
conference-best average of 11.2
strikeouts per game.
The Wildcats will put up a
fight against Nyberg and
Sorensen, as Autumn Champion
and Lovie Jung of Arizona are av
eraging .443 and .442, respective
ly at the plate.
Jung also has a team-high 15
doubles, 20 home runs and 59
RBI. Arizona has outscored its

opposition 258-35 so far this sea
son.
After squaring off with the
Wildcats, the Cardinal will duel
twice with No. 12 Arizona State
(26-12, 3-3), as the Sun Devils
hope to bounce back from their
three-game losing streak.
Leading the fight fora come
back will be ASU senior shortstop
Kara Brun who had her 17-game
hitting streak die last weekend.
The All-American is batting .430

with 11 doubles, 10 home runs
and 32 RBI.
A power-hitting squad, the Sun
Devils have had at least one home
run in 19 games and 10 multiple
home run games.
The Cardinal defense and
pitching staff will fight to quell the
ASU power hitters and the Stan
ford ofYense will work to continue
its success at the plate in a quest to
leave a Pac-10 weekend with a win
ning record for the first time.
