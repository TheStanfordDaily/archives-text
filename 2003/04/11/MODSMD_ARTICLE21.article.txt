# Is Miggy the Oriole's missing piece?
## Scott contemplates a new and improved Oriole's roster with Tejadas addition

It's funny the way things work out
sometimes. For example, flash
back to the Sweet 16 where Mary
land trailed Michigan State by two
points with less than five seconds left.
Steve Blake — I'm gonna miss you, dog
— takes the inbounds pass and darts up
court . . . fires a 3-pointer from the top
of the key . . . for the win . . . clank.
If Maryland had won, I would have
headed to San Antonio to see my
beloved Terps play Texas in the Elite
Eight on my way back to the Farm. I can
think of worse ways to break up the trip.
As it were, I spent a couple more days

with my family and girl
friend, who declared
after the loss that she
never wants to watch a
game with me again.
But in hindsight,
maybe it was fate that
Blake's shot was off the
mark, for two days later
I had the pleasure of

witnessing something far more special
as a result: an Orioles win.
I went to Opening Day at Camden
Yards, where an Orioles offense that
wouldn't be scary wielding aluminum
bats at a tee-ball game erupted — I'm
talking Vesuvius-style — for six runs in
a thrilling, snow-filled 13-inning 6-5 win
over the Indians.
OK, so maybe the O's were trailing 4-
2 when I had to leave in the seventh in

ning to catch a plane to San Jose, but
that's beside the point. The point is that
after averaging less than three runs per
contest and losing 32 of 36 games to end
last season, the Birds were a perfect 1-0,
sitting tied with the Yankees for first
atop the standings.
Who am I kidding? The point is, de
spite the win, the Orioles inhale vigor
ously once again.
Twenty-four hours, three time zones
and 20 degrees later, I went with some
friends to Networks Associates Coliseum
for the Athletics' opener, a 5-0 blanking
of the Mariners.
The contrast between the CVs and A's
is depressing, as practically every player
in Ken Macha s lineup could bat
cleanup in Baltimore, and Oakland's
