# Is Miggy the Oriole's missing piece?
## Scott contemplates a new and improved Oriole's roster with Tejadas addition 
### 
It's funny the way things work out
sometimes. For example, flash
back to the Sweet 16 where Mary
land trailed Michigan State by two
points with less than five seconds left.
Steve Blake — I'm gonna miss you, dog
— takes the inbounds pass and darts up
court . . . fires a 3-pointer from the top
of the key . . . for the win . . . clank.
If Maryland had won, I would have
headed to San Antonio to see my
beloved Terps play Texas in the Elite
Eight on my way back to the Farm. I can
think of worse ways to break up the trip.
As it were, I spent a couple more days

with my family and girl
friend, who declared
after the loss that she
never wants to watch a
game with me again.
But in hindsight,
maybe it was fate that
Blake's shot was off the
mark, for two days later
I had the pleasure of

witnessing something far more special
as a result: an Orioles win.
I went to Opening Day at Camden
Yards, where an Orioles offense that
wouldn't be scary wielding aluminum
bats at a tee-ball game erupted — I'm
talking Vesuvius-style — for six runs in
a thrilling, snow-filled 13-inning 6-5 win
over the Indians.
OK, so maybe the O's were trailing 4-
2 when I had to leave in the seventh in

ning to catch a plane to San Jose, but
that's beside the point. The point is that
after averaging less than three runs per
contest and losing 32 of 36 games to end
last season, the Birds were a perfect 1-0,
sitting tied with the Yankees for first
atop the standings.
Who am I kidding? The point is, de
spite the win, the Orioles inhale vigor
ously once again.
Twenty-four hours, three time zones
and 20 degrees later, I went with some
friends to Networks Associates Coliseum
for the Athletics' opener, a 5-0 blanking
of the Mariners.
The contrast between the CVs and A's
is depressing, as practically every player
in Ken Macha s lineup could bat
cleanup in Baltimore, and Oakland's


Scott Allen
fourth starter would be the Ori
oles ace.
Listening to the pre-game
show as we sat in traffic within
walking distance of the stadium
for an hour, Miguel Tejada talked
about his MVP award, Spring
Training and, of course, his fu
ture, or lack thereof, in Oakland.
I'm not an agent, Mr. Tejada,
but I play one in this column. If
you're reading this, I know just
the place for you. That's right, my
man: Baltimore. Hear me out.
You jest that if you could make
an offer you'd ask for $500 mil
lion. I like a client with a sense of
humor, but if there's one team
that has stockpiled and is willing
to pay you that much, it's Peter
Angelos and the Orioles brass.
Of course you'd stand a better
chance of commanding that
amount of money in Baltimore if
you were 10 years older with a
bad hip and retired (see: Albert
Belle) but their revamped front
office tells me they're ready to
take a chance on someone in the
prime of his career like yourself.
I know winning is important
to you and I can assure you that
it's the No. 1 priority in Baltimore

as well. Sure, Jeff Conine bats
cleanup. Yes, the O'sjust lost two
of three games to the Devil Rays
and have finished fourth in the
division for the past five years.
But with a bountiful collection of
up-and-comers from their non
existent farm system and sea
soned veterans who can ground
into double plays with the best of
them, the O's arejust one gargan
tuan puzzle-piece away from con
tending for third-place. You, Mr.
Tejada, are that piece.
You've got the potential to
make O's fans forget about the
free-agent acquisition of short
stop Deivi Cruz — a career .269
hitter considered an offensive up
grade — if not Cal Ripken.
Now Miggy, I know you care a
lot about your kids, which is very
respectable. The National Aquar
ium in Baltimore is a learning
haven and the Children's Muse
um is top-notch.
Carmelo Anthony's from Balti
more and that's gotta be good for
something. Right?
So come the free-agent signing
period, think Charm City. Think
crab cakes. Think Baltimore,
Miggy. Please.

man: Baltimore. Hear me out.
You jest that if you could make
an offer you'd ask for $500 mil
lion. I like a client with a sense of
humor, but if there's one team
that has stockpiled and is willing
to pay you that much, it's Peter
Angelos and the Orioles brass.
Of course you'd stand a better
chance of commanding that
amount of money in Baltimore if
you were 10 years older with a
bad hip and retired (see: Albert
Belle) but their revamped front
office tells me they're ready to
take a chance on someone in the
prime of his career like yourself.
I know winning is important
to you and I can assure you that
it's the No. 1 priority in Baltimore

as well. Sure, Jeff Conine bats
cleanup. Yes, the O'sjust lost two
of three games to the Devil Rays
and have finished fourth in the
division for the past five years.
But with a bountiful collection of
up-and-comers from their non
existent farm system and sea
soned veterans who can ground
into double plays with the best of
them, the O's arejust one gargan
tuan puzzle-piece away from con
tending for third-place. You, Mr.
Tejada, are that piece.
You've got the potential to
make O's fans forget about the
free-agent acquisition of short
stop Deivi Cruz — a career .269
hitter considered an offensive up
grade — if not Cal Ripken.
Now Miggy, I know you care a
lot about your kids, which is very
respectable. The National Aquar
ium in Baltimore is a learning
haven and the Children's Muse
um is top-notch.
Carmelo Anthony's from Balti
more and that's gotta be good for
something. Right?
So come the free-agent signing
period, think Charm City. Think
crab cakes. Think Baltimore,
Miggy. Please.
