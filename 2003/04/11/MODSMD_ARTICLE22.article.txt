## 
### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 7 Stanford (16-3, 3-0
Pac-10) men's tennis team will need to avoid
basking in the glow of Tuesday's thrilling 4-3
upset of No. 3 California and focus on the mat
ter at hand.
In a pair of Pac-10 home matches at the
Taube Family Tennis Center, the Cardinal
takes on No. 29 Arizona State (8-9, 3-1) and No.
33 Arizona (8-8, 2-2) this weekend.
"We better be ready to play," associate head

coach John Whitlinger said. "The Cal match is
done. It's over. We've got to focus on these two
matches because they're important. We've got
to keep this going."
Still, the Cardinal need not move ofl of its
laurels just yet. The Cal match is the kind of vic
tory that will stick in the minds of everyone who
witnessed it fora long time to come.
"What a great college tennis match against
Cal," Whitlinger said. "It was a real treat for
everyone to watch. It was a great treat for me to
watch, that's for sure."
With Cal and Stanford deadlocked at 3-3,

the only match remaining was between Cardi
nal sophomore Sam Warburg and Or Dekel on
court four. Trailing 4-1 in the third set, War
burg clawed his way back from the brink of de
feat to give Stanford the improbable victory by
winning the last five games.
"I'm happy for Sam to win a match like that
after what happened last year," Whitlinger
said. "It was just a great gutsy effort by Sam. It,
was deja vu â€” the same thing happened last
year. This time he pulled it off."
Last season, in a remarkably similar situa
tion, the Cal-Stanford match at Taube was tied
at 3-3 with Warburg playing in the deciding
match. He trailed Cal's Robert Kowalczyk 5-2!
in the third set. Warburg fought back to even,
the match, but eventually lost 7-5 in the tie-;
breaker.
"Sam had no fear out there," Whitlinger
said. "He stepped up and cracked his forehand
and cracked his backhand. He got to the net
and served and volleyed. It was a great thing for.
the other guys to see that Sam kept going for his.
shots and stayed aggressive in such a pressure
filled situation."
The Cal victory proved that Stanford is ca
pable of beating the nation's other elite teams.;
It was the Cardinal's first triumph of the season
over a top-five team after notching wins against
No. 10 Texas A&M, No. 12 Kentucky, No. 15
Washington and No. 20Tulane.
"That's a good win for us and something we
needed after the UCLA loss," Whitlinger said.
"Cal's a very good team and they definitely
have a chance to win it all. But so do we."
The win was also important because Stan
ford is competing with Cal to host a regional for
the opening two rounds of the NCAA, tourna
ment in May. Since both schools are in the same
geographic region, only one can host even if
both secure high seedings.
Earlier this season, Stanford beat Arizona
State 5-2 and Arizona 6-1 on the road. Since
that time, both schools have risen in the rank
ings and will not present easy victories for the
Cardinal.
Last weekend, both Arizona schools defeat
ed Washington 4-3.
"That's a good wake-up call for us to make us
realize that this won't be a cake-walk,"
Whitlinger said. "We can't fall asleep."
