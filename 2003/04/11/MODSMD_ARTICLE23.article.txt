# Men's golf readies for the desert sand traps
## ASU Thunderbird Invitational awaits the Cardinal clubs 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's been said that the key to playing
good golf is the ability to forget about
the bad holes and to regain one's com
posure quickly in the face of adversity.
The Stanford men's golf team will
certainly have a chance to demonstrate
some character this weekend, as the
Cardinal comes off a disappointing
outing at the Western Intercollegiate in
Santa Cruz. After positioning itself well
through the first 36 holes, the team fell
apart in Tuesday's final round at
Pasatiempo Country Club, sliding
from sixth all the way to 12th place
overall.
Stanford had little time to mope,
however, as the players returned to
campus for less than 24 hours before
packing up and traveling to Tempe,
Ariz. Today, the Cardinal begins play
at the 31st annual ASU Thunderbird
Invitational.
The 54-hole event will take place
over two days on Arizona State's home
turf, the par-72 7,037-yard Karsten
Golf Course.
Named after the famous club manu
facturer, Karsten Solheim, the course is
one of the longest that the Cardinal will
encounter. Nonetheless, the course has
surrendered some low scores in the
past, including a tournament-record
200 (12 under par) by Texas Christ
ian's Bret Guetz in last year's event.
The competition should be even
hotter than the desert sun this week
end, as the Cardinal will do battle with
what may be the most talented field in
any regular-season collegiate golf event
this year.
This year's ASU Invitational has at
tracted some of the finest teams in the
country, including three of
Sagarin/Golfweek's top five: Texas
(No. 2), Arizona (No. 4), and UNLV
(No. 5). Joining these giants are No. 7

TCU and No. 10 UCLA.
UCLA is one of the nation's hottest
programs at the moment, having won
three of its last four tournaments.
Of course, one should never forget
the host. No. 22 Arizona State has
made the most of its home course ad
vantage in the past, winning its own
tournament 11 times in all, the last title
coming in 2001.
ASU golfers have also guarded the
individual crown rather jealously, win
ning eight trophies in individual com
petition.
The Cardinal will certainly have to
play some of its best golf of the year if it
hopes to compete in this talented field.
Unfortunately, history is not on Stan
ford's side.
Last year's Invitational was a strug
gle for the team, as they shot a 2-over
par 866 for three rounds. While this
would have a been a solid score in most
events, the easy desert conditions
meant that the Cardinal finished a dis
appointing 13th out of 16 teams, 34
shots off the lead.
Only Stanford senior Jim Seki has
fond memories of Tempe, having fin
ished with a 4-under-par 208, good
enough to tie for seventh place in the
individual competition. Unfortunately
for Stanford, it is unlikely that Seki will
play this weekend, as his injured back
continues to bother him.
"We played a lot of holes [at the
Western Intercollegiate]," Seki said.
"After a while, it just starts to wear you
down."
It is still unclear how coach Jeff
Mitchell will shuffle his lineup to ac
count for the loss of Seki, a perennial
starter.
After the Cardinal finishes play on
Saturday, the squad will return home
for the U.S. Intercollegiate. The tour
nament will take place Apr. 19-20, and
is the only event of the spring to take
place at the Stanford Golf Course.
Last year, Stanford fared well at its
own tournament, finishing second in
the team competition. The U.S. Inter
collegiate will be the last tune-up before
the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships begin April 28.
