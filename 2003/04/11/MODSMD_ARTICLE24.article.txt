# Card MPSF hopes hinge on SoCal rivals
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Riding its longest win streak of
the season, the No. 10 Stanford
men's volleyball team (15-11, 12-8
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has put itself in contention to
earn a first-round MPSF tourna
ment match at home.
After clinching a playoff berth
with a win on Tuesday over No. 4
Pacific (18-11, 12-8), the Cardinal
heads into weekend action tied for
the fourth spot in-conference with
the Tigers.
However, Stanford holds the
edge in the season series with Pa
cific, having defeated the Tigers
both times the teams squared off.
Should the two teams finish the
regular season in a tie for fourth,
the Cardinal would receive home
court advantage because of its ear
lier victories over Pacific, making

another win all the more impor
tant.
Each of the top four MPSF
teams plays its first tournament
match on its home floor, a huge ad
vantage, especially when No. 3
Brigham Young (18-5, 16-4
MPSF) and No. 2 Hawaii (21 -5,15-
5 MPSF) have all but locked up the
second and third conference
ranks.
"You really don't want to have
to make a first-round trip to
Hawaii or BYU," coach Don Shaw
said. "Not only is all that travel time
tough, but so is missing that much
school."
Stanford must first clear the ob
stacles of No. 6 UC-Irvine (18-9,
11-9 MPSF) and No. 11 UCLA (14-
13,9-11 MPSF) before it can clear
ly look at the entire postseasons
picture.

Junior Pat Bomhack puts it up earlier this season as the Cardinal earns a tie
for fourth in MPSF standings. Wins against UCLA and UC Irvine would clinch
the home court advantage for Stanford in the in-conference tourney.
The Cardinal faces the Bruins
tonight and the Anteaters on to
morrow during its trip to South
ern California.
Stanford had success versus
Irvine earlier in the year, sur
prising the then-No. 3 Anteaters
by closing out the win in four

games.
One of the keys to stopping the
Anteaters will be slowing down last
week's MPSF Player of the Week,
outside hitter Jimmy Pelzel, who
recorded his I,oooth kill in
Irvine's loss to Pepperdine last
Thursday.
Stanford has not had the same
success against UCIA. In its previ
ous meeting, the Cardinal was
swept by the Bruins in what was
arguably Stanford's sloppiest

match of the season, when it fin
ished with a meager .194 hitting
percentage.
What is evident though is the
Bruins' need fora victory.
"They have to go out and win
both matches if they hope to have
a chance to be in the tournament,"
Shaw said. "So they're desperate,
which makes them a very danger
ous team to play, especially at
UCLA, where they have a lot of
tradition and pride."
