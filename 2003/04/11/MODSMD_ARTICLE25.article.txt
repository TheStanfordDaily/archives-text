# Stanford skating, go figure

### JESSICA PETERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time in history, a Cardinal club team
stepped onto the ice at a national championship.
Stanford sent three of its seven competitive fig
ure skaters to the University of Denver, the host of
the 2003 National Intercollegiate Team Champi
onships March 28 to 30. Senior Cindy Keeler and
juniors Jackie Wong and Jenny Chen represented
the Cardinal as part of a team that has only been in
existence since spring 2001.
Co-captain Wong said that he was thrilled that
the team had qualified for nationals in only its first
year of intercollegiate competition. He was espe
cially pleased to watch the team "establish a pres
ence on the West Coast".
The team established more than just a presence

this year, entering Nationals as the top Pacific Con
ference team, a feat largely due to huge perfor
mances in the 2003 Spartan Skate and the 2003
Stanford Invitational, in which the team placed sec
ond and first, respectively.
The Card met up with 10 other teams in Denver
for the championships, including the second- and
third-place Pacific teams, Cal Tech and San Jose
State.
After three days of competition, Stanford ended
just one point shy of seventh place.
Keeler competed for the Cardinal in the Inter
mediate Ladies' long program, in which she fin
ished seventh.
Chen, the team's second captain, captured two
bronze medals for the team in the Novice Ladies'
short program and the Pre-Intermediate Solo
Dance. Both performances were exceptional, and
the only flaw in Chen's short program was a two
foot landing on a lutz.
Unfortunately, her dash for medals was cut
short by stress put on a back injury during the short
program. The injury forced her to withdraw from
the long program and compulsory moves.
Wong skated to a fourth-place finish in his Pre-
Intermediate Solo Dance and participated in the
exhibition for Men's compulsory moves.
In the end, Cornell University emerged as the
national champion, followed by the University of
Delaware and Miami University of Ohio.
"Although we did not finish at the top at Nation
als, I was very satisfied with the hard work, team
work and enthusiasm that the competitive and club
skaters put forth throughout the season," Wong
said.
Chen regards the competition as a learning ex
perience for the captains. "Going to Nationals real
ly gave [us] an idea of what it takes to develop a co
hesive team that emphasizes not only top finishes,
but also bonds of friendship through athletic devel
opment."
The team will continue to offer lessons to both
beginner and advanced skaters at Belmont Iceland.
As important as competition is, the teaching aspect
of the team is considered by its members to be an in
tegral part of the program.
"Every quarter, our competitive skaters teach a
dozen or more beginner skaters the basics of skat
ing," said Chen, "Through these sessions, we hope
to spread the love of figure skating throughout
campus and the hockey-dominated Bay Area."
