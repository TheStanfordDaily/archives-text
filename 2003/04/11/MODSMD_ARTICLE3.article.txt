# Senior class election under fire
## Figueroa, Natoli win 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
The scene was one of utter chaos as members of spe
cial-fee groups, class presidential slates, executive office
slates and senatorial candidates eagerly awaited the results
of this year's ASSU elections. Drinks were chugged, a table
was broken and general rowdiness dominated as many
waited from even before midnight, when voting ended,
until 1:30 a.m., when the results were finally released.
The crowd began to gather at about 11:50 p.m. in a
meeting room on the second floor of Tresidder. Soon,
the Stanford Chapparal arrived with members armed
with bullhorns, stuffed animals, banners and signs, in
cluding one reading, "We own the moon." As the night
wore on, ASSU vice presidential candidate Charlie
Stockman led the crowd in a variety of cheers.
At roughly 1 a.m., outgoing ASSU President Monica

Henestroza announced that, after spending a few min
utes trying to quiet the noisy crowd, results would take
another 20 minutes. Henestroza was interrupted sever
al times by hecklers who told her to simply announce
who had won.
A majority of the people in the room were visibly in
toxicated with handles of Bacardi rum and Smirnoff Ice
floating freely. An apparently inebriated girl jumped
onto and broke one of the tables of the meeting room.
The results were then read at 1:30 a.m. by Henestroza,
GSC Chair Grace Chang, a medical student, Elections
Commissioner Eleanor Williams, a junior, and Assistant
Elections Commissioner Alida Garcia, a sophomore.
Garcia said that the time between elections was occu
pied by double-checking results, manually verifying spe
cial fees yes and no percentages against the number of
students voting for the special-fee groups and checking
votes to ensure validity. Senator Hiro Iwonaga, a senior,

who designed die elections Web site, noted that the
amount of time taken to release results was roughly stan
dard for ASSU elections.
For Undergraduate Senate, Josh Shipp, one of two in
cumbents running, received the most votes at 1,244. For
the Graduate Student Council, only 13 representatives
fora possible 15 seats were elected as there were no can
didates from the Law School and the humanities depart
ments within the School of Humanities and Sciences.
For class presidents, '06 Pack won sophomore class,
Juniorosity won the junior class race and Fire It Up won
the senior class presidency.
However, some groups have already unofficially ex
pressed concern with the fairness of election procedures,
alleging that some juniors were unable to vote for senior
class president slates because they encountered technical

problems with the election's Web
site. According to junior Gina Moon,
a member of the slate BOOYAH!,
the Elections Commission refused to
release the number of votes each of
the senior class presidential slates re
ceived, though the commission did
release the votes earned by the
sophomore and junior class slates.
"We feel that the democratic
process of the ASSU is in question,"
Moon said in a letter to The Daily

submitted after the results were an
nounced. "It makes us feel very un
comfortable to not know what num
ber of votes each slate received."
According to Moon, the commis
sion declined to release the num
bers when asked by members of the
slate after the announcements and
said they would address the con
cerns today.
Williams was not available to dis
cuss these concerns immediately
following results, however she did
note that she will most likely be re
leasing a statement today.
The race for senior class presi
dent was expected to be one of the

tightest in this year's election.
Henestroza explained that the
Elections Commission looked at the
Constitution and closely followed
the rules for the elections. She also
stated that, unless a group officially
petitions the Elections Commission,
the commission does not directly
respond to complaints.
In the race for executive office,
Nadiya Figueroa and Joey Natoli
won with approximately 2,500
votes, with Steve Yelderman and
Charlie Stockman coming in second.
"It was a good race and we're re
ally excited," Figueroa said. "We're
going in with high energy, and it'll

be a good year."
Yelderman seemed accepting of
the results.
"I think the results are what one
can expert whenever you challenge
ASSU insiders," he said. " It was a
tough uphill battle, and we're proud
of where we got. We think we left a
message to the student body."
Stockman emphasized the num
ber of votes received.
"1,503 votes, that's unprece
dented," he said. "We got the most
votes ever, and I take that as a man
date to initiate our policies. We're
going to replace the Marguerites
with hovering Marguerites."
