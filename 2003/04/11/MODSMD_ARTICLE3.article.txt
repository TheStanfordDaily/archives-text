# Senior class election under fire
## Figueroa, Natoli win 
### MORGAN SPRINGER STAFF WRITER 
The scene was one of utter chaos as members of spe
cial-fee groups, class presidential slates, executive office
slates and senatorial candidates eagerly awaited the results
of this year's ASSU elections. Drinks were chugged, a table
was broken and general rowdiness dominated as many
waited from even before midnight, when voting ended,
until 1:30 a.m., when the results were finally released.
The crowd began to gather at about 11:50 p.m. in a
meeting room on the second floor of Tresidder. Soon,
the Stanford Chapparal arrived with members armed
with bullhorns, stuffed animals, banners and signs, in
cluding one reading, "We own the moon." As the night
wore on, ASSU vice presidential candidate Charlie
Stockman led the crowd in a variety of cheers.
At roughly 1 a.m., outgoing ASSU President Monica

Henestroza announced that, after spending a few min
utes trying to quiet the noisy crowd, results would take
another 20 minutes. Henestroza was interrupted sever
al times by hecklers who told her to simply announce
who had won.
A majority of the people in the room were visibly in
toxicated with handles of Bacardi rum and Smirnoff Ice
floating freely. An apparently inebriated girl jumped
onto and broke one of the tables of the meeting room.
The results were then read at 1:30 a.m. by Henestroza,
GSC Chair Grace Chang, a medical student, Elections
Commissioner Eleanor Williams, a junior, and Assistant
Elections Commissioner Alida Garcia, a sophomore.
Garcia said that the time between elections was occu
pied by double-checking results, manually verifying spe
cial fees yes and no percentages against the number of
students voting for the special-fee groups and checking
votes to ensure validity. Senator Hiro Iwonaga, a senior,

who designed die elections Web site, noted that the
amount of time taken to release results was roughly stan
dard for ASSU elections.
For Undergraduate Senate, Josh Shipp, one of two in
cumbents running, received the most votes at 1,244. For
the Graduate Student Council, only 13 representatives
fora possible 15 seats were elected as there were no can
didates from the Law School and the humanities depart
ments within the School of Humanities and Sciences.
For class presidents, '06 Pack won sophomore class,
Juniorosity won the junior class race and Fire It Up won
the senior class presidency.
However, some groups have already unofficially ex
pressed concern with the fairness of election procedures,
alleging that some juniors were unable to vote for senior
class president slates because they encountered technical
