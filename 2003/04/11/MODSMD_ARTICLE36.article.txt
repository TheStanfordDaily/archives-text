# Sandler still manages to entertain
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
It's 1978 and Dave Buznik is fielding his first crush. As the
opening credits roll and Blondie's "Heart of Glass" plays in
the background, we meet our protagonist, a shy middle
schooler who is soon to be disgraced playing a game of truth
or dare that hopes to bring him a first kiss. Enticed by young
love, Dave closes his eyes fora kiss, but instead gets his pants
pulled down by a fellow classmate. Kids can be so cruel.
Fast-forward to today. Dave (Adam Sandler) is now an

executive assistant fora company developing
pet products. Trying to make a name for him- V
self developing clothing for overweight, body
conscious (read: fat) cats, Dave is trying to work
his way up the corporate ladder while romanc
ing the beautiful Linda (Marissa Tomei). Dave
and Linda are serious, but you get the feeling
that Linda wants more, especially since Dave can
give her only a handshake at the airport. Ever
since his first public kissing experience left him

hanging, so to speak, he has never quite been able to give in
to public displays of affection.

However, Dave's life is about to change. On a routine busi
ness trip to Saint Louis, Dave runs into a bit of a problem:
Someone is sitting in his seat on the airplane. While this
seems like an easily rectifiable situation, soft-spoken Dave
lets himself be bullied out of his seat and ends up sitting next
to anger management guru Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).
From their first meeting, it appears that Rydell seems to
excel most at inciting anger rather than remedying it.
Through a series of overblown misunderstandings, be
ginning on the Saint Louis flight (when one of the flight at
tendants gets decked) and escalating to the public assault of
a cocktail waitress, Dave receives a court order to undergo
intensive anger management therapy under the guidance of
none other than the master himself, Buddy. Straight off, you
feel like something is not quite right about this guy. Maybe

it's his manic episodes, maybe it's his unorthodox tech
niques, maybe it's the fact that you keep having recurring
nightmares about him ever since you saw "The Shining."
Anyway, you know that something's wrong.
It is precisely this hunch that keeps you watching. As
with most Sandler films, "Anger Management" gives its
viewers a lot of running gags, bathroom humor and a pa
rade of his closest friends and well-known indus-

try entertainers (Heather Graham
and Woody Harrelson to name a
few), plus a few notables who have

dealt with rage issues (Bobby Knight and

John McEnroe). There's also anoth
er bid for the MTV Movie Award for
"Best Fight Scene," with Bob Barker
being replaced by a Buddhist monk
— don't think there won't be an up
roar in the monk community about
this one.
"Anger Management" marks some-

what of a departure from previous Sandler roles in
that he is not playing his characteristic goofball
self, but he doesn't quite slip into "Punch Drunk
Love" territory either (I'm still trying to figure that
one out — my theory is that Adam Sandler was
lured to the project because they offered to pay
him in pudding.)
Nicholson is great as the witticism-espousing
anger management Yoda ("Sarcasm is anger's evil
cousin," he quips) and he is a true driving force of

the film. And Tomei serves well as the resolute and caring
girlfriend, contrasting the prevalence of adult film stars as
the only other female characters.
Where "Anger Management" succeeds (or fails, depend
ing on how you view it) is evident in that it is oftentimes try
ing. Some of the interactions between Sandler and Nichol
son offer a test to the nerves (at one point the man sitting

next to rne in the theater turned to me and said flat out,
"This is insane"), but perhaps this is what the audience is
supposed to feel. For the most part, Sandler lives up to his
part of the bargain; he holds his own opposite two Oscar
winners, Nicholson and Tomei, and seems to have no trou
ble in getting them to play along. If anything, the appear
ance of Nicholson and Tomei stand to help re-establish the

Sandler we know and love and feared we might have lost
after "Little Nicky."
So are we seeing a new Sandler? Will "Anger Manage
ment" allow him to expose more of his talents than just nos
tril wiggling? Will he get to give one of his signature speech
es? Will they sing notable "West Side Story" songs? I guess
you'll just have to see it yourself.



What could be more pleasurable than a few hours with these two? Just
look at those faces.
