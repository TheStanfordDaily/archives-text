# 'Phone Booth' worth phoning home about
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN 
Strangely enough, the much-delayed "Phone
Booth" opens with a sweetly sung version of "Hello Op
erator" playing while a camera zips through the blue
skies above New York City. A voiceover begins, and the
audience quickly comes to feel that the movie is trying
to be an elegy for the all-but-forgotten phone booth.
Just as Milton once mourned his beloved Lycidas, Joel
Schumacher, the film's director, seems to lament the
downfall of the humble abode of superheroes and street
bums which have all but disappeared from the cities of
America as cell phones weave their insidious mechanics
throughout society.
It is a good thing that these maudlin sympathies dis
appear quickly and allow "Phone Booth" to develop
into an actual movie. Encapsulated into a tight 80-
minute runtime, the film focuses on the sins of Stu
(never Stuart) Shepard, a slick publicist played by Colin
Farrell. The married Shepard uses one of those en
closed phone booths oh-so romanticized by Schumach
er to regularly place calls to his girlfriend (Katie
Holmes), drawing the attention of a vice-hating serial
killer. After arranging a killing that pits the police
against suspected perpetrator Shepard, the sniper toys
with his victim for the next hour, maintaining the upper
hand in his sadistic game with the help of a high-pow
ered telescopic rifle.
1 walked into this movie very worried. It is, after
all, directed by Joel Schumacher, the talented artist
(pronounced arteest) who brought us hits like
"BMM" (which made use of hardcore pornography in
such interesting and creative ways), and the most re
cent installments of the Batman franchise, "Batman
Forever" and "Batman & Robin." (Note: It's been re

ported that, after finishing "Batman & Robin" and
witnessing its horrifying plummet from the radar
screen of respected cinema, he admitted that he owes
nothing more to the Batman franchise than to "stay
away from it.")
Despite this filmography — which should frighten
any studio producer into a Level 111 coma — "Phone
Booth" is a good movie. I know, I shock myself, but I'll

say it again: It ain't bad. Even though near-

ly all 80 minutes are centered around
a glass box; even though the movie
stars an unproven actor in all his fop
pish Irish glory; and even though
Schumacher is sitting behind the cam
era, "Phone Booth" is gripping.
This is not to say the movie is per
fect. Many aspects of the plot take a
great deal of faith on the part of the

viewer, and the sniper, voiced by the
always-eerie Kiefer Sutherland, is barely human. His
motives are cheesy and cliche, and it takes little more
than the mental capacity of an amphibian in the early
stages of its biological evolution to guess what will hap
pen to him in the end.
Farrell does a lot to make up for these failings. His
character ranges from detestable to sad to downright
sympathetic, and he pulls each metamorphosis off with
an effortless flick of his shaggy hair. Plus, he's hot. I
mean, I'm not a woman, or a gay man, but if I were —
oh man.
The film is just the right length and, thankfully, not
too ambitious. It is predictable and formulaic, but in a
new and creative way. This certainly won't be Farrell's
breakout role, but at least it proves that he can handle
one when it comes along.


Ifs more fun in there than you think. Really.
