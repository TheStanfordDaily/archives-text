# This tango reserved for the geriatric

### JASON ROSENSWEIG 
An aging hit man travels to Argentina fora routine job, anxious about
missing the birthday of his girlfriend's 10-year old daughter. The job gets
delayed, and he occupies himself in the meantime with tango and a beau
tiful tango dancer. That's the premise of "Assassination Tango," and it
sounds like a gimmicky way of jazzing (tangoing) up a classic nice-guy
criminal flick. But Robert Duvall — its writer, director and star — is a se
rious filmmaker who made a good movie a few years ago with "The

Apostle" (1997).
{ Unfortunately, we have to forego the

benefit of the doubt we'd like to give to the

tide character played by Duvall, known stoically

here as John J. Anderson. First of all, Duvall
is 72 years old. Even if he was a healthy, at
tractive man with good plastic surgery and a
team of stylists and Armani valets to make his
"maturity" sexy, 72 is seven years past the re
tirement age, and it's only four years
younger than the expected age of death.
A wizened hit man with an only-sever-

al-decades-younger girlfriend you can take. But when he starts salivating
over Luciana Pedraza, the 30-year-old tango beauty (who is, impressive
ly, actually Argentine, but disconcertingly doesn't seem to open her
mouth when she speaks), we enter into the uncomfortable territory of a
Humbert Humbert without the eloquence of Nabokov (or even Jeremy
Irons).
Duvall, to his slight credit, is aware of this problem. At one point he
asks Luciana, "If I were younger, would I have a chance with you?" She,
generously twisting our concerns into an attempted reassurance, says
something like, "Old, old, you're always thinking about this age thing!"
And then, in what could be a kind of progressive non-age-discriminato
ry big-heartedness, she says, "You have a chance." You can almost feel
Duvall's litde wheels turning, wondering where he can get Viagra in
Buenos Aires.
Aside from the dirty old man issues, the movie is, in a weird way,
well-acted and well-crafted on a moment-to-moment basis. But the mo
ments just don't link together. A good deal of time is spent on the in
ternational intrigue and blacksuited criminal aspects of the movie, but
any of the tensions developed there end up dissolving into the deflat
ed, happy ending. And you just can't take Duvall seriously when he's
always wearing his Italian sunglasses, be it to his "daughter's" elemen
tary school, to an early-bird special at the Olive Garden or to a swank
Argentine dinner club.
It's somewhat endearing that Duvall seems to have tried to combine
two of his personal fascinations (hit men and Argentine tango) in a film;
unfortunately, we end up with oxymoronic nonsense like Gertrude
Stein's "tender buttons," and are left squirming before the geriatric
tango of Hollywood-meets-art-flick gone wrong.


His moves may be for real, but that left hip is plastic
