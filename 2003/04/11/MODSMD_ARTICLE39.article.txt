# The 						Game Boy grows up
## 
### CHRIS LEE 
For those of you who haven't heard, it's
true — the Nintendo Game Boy is back,
and sexier than ever. When did this boy get
sexy, you ask? And how could a little piece
of electronic hardware turn us into sloven
ly pedophiles?
You have to admit, the term "Game
Boy" itself could convey innuendo of a dif
ferent sort — could, if it weren't already
associated with such happy, harmless
memories as "Tetris," "Super Mario Bros,"
and (in later, darker years) that damned
"Pokemon" franchise. But the Nintendo
Game Boy, now in its fifth incarnation, has
come such a long way, baby, and when you
see the new Advance SPin all its glory —
pederast or no — you'll be itching to get
your hands on one.
The original Game Boy Advance was re
leased to much fanfare almost two years
ago, with its primary features being a new
system architecture (complete with 32-bit
processor, more advanced than the origi
nal Super Nintendo console!) as well as a
new ergonomic design that placed the di
rectional pad and the buttons to either side
of a widened screen. Finally, at long last,
players with huge hands could wrap their
fingers along the back of the machine with
comfort. Two Land R shoulder buttons
were also added, presumably to allow for
more sophisticated games.
Oddly enough, however, several fea
tures that had plagued the other Game
Boy systems persevered — the LGD screen
still had no backlight, and the system still
ran off of AA batteries, a deceptive "conve
nience" that most Game Boy owners would
eventually exchange fora third-party
rechargeable battery pack.

And now conies the Game Boy Advance
SP, released just last month to even more
anticipation and working of salivary
glands. What does SP stand for? I haven't a
clue. "Super Powerful?" Probably not,
since the SP still has the same specs as the
original Advance: a 32-bit processor, 240 x
160 pixel resolution — even the screen size
has stayed the same, measuring a kid
friendly 2.9 inches diagonally.
So let's just call it "Special." Gone are

those pesky AA batteries or bulky
rechargeable packs; the SP comes with its
own Nintendo-approved lithium-ion bat
tery that lasts up to 10 hours per charge

(with the included AC adapter). More
importantly, though — and this is

the one feature that will have
gamers gallivanting in the

streets —is the built-in

backlight for the dis
play, which finally

reduces both
eyestrain and

gameplay
woes. At

long
last, you
can
play
Vo u r

Game
Boy in

the dark,

without the aid of
one of those cumber-

some accessory lights; even
better, you can finally see every-

thing that's happening on screen at all
times. No more endless tilting so that out
side light falls on it just right — this Game
Boy is lit from within, and your gameplay
ing hours will be infinitely happier because
of it.
Unfortunately, the SP isn't without its
flaws. For some inexplicable reason, Nin
tendo has actually eliminated the head
phone jack from the basic unit; to be fair,
there does exist a separate accessory that
plugs into one of the ports, but this kind of
takes away from the simplicity of the de
sign. Also, it's hard to look macho in public
when your Game Boy's emitting tinny blips
and bleeps from the woefully grating
speaker.

The system's most visible change
— a sleek, svelte new design that
folds open like a tiny laptop —

may also cause some players
newfound stress. Yes, the
folding design makes the sys-

tem even smaller to carry
around, becoming a 3.3" x 3.3"
square less than an inch thick in

your pocket; even better, it naturally pro
tects the screen when not in use.
However, people with big hands will go
back to suffering, much like the opposite
effect of those gargantuan Xbox con
trollers. Some people have finger joints
longer than three inches, and even those
with modest hands will still feel a little
cramped trying to get their fingers in place
to reach all the buttons. To add insult to in
jury, the Land R buttons have been
shrunken to miniscule proportions, locat
ed on the upper corners of the square base.
It's these buttons that are particularly trou
blesome; not only will you probably give
up being able reach them fast enough dur
ing normal gameplay, chances are more
likely that you'll accidentally nudge one of
them with the undersides of your colossal
fingers while trying to use the buttons on
the front, registering unwanted button
presses. Weak sauce!
Of course, there may be something
wrong with a grown man criticizing a
child's toy for actually fitting in the hands

of a child (let's face it,
the main point of

junior can upgrade Pikachu to Level 70
that much faster), but videogames are
quickly becoming a more acceptable form
of popular entertainment, and the Game
Boy's new sophisticated look will no doubt
draw even more adults into the fold. Pre
sumably many of those adults will not have
small hands.
For all the griping, though, the fact re
mains that the SP's small, sexy new look is
a winner — never has portable gaming
been this easy or just plain cool. Nintendo
has finally added the features gamers have
been clamoring for. And, as with every new
Game Boy, the SP is backwards compatible
with all previous generations of Game Boy
cartridges. This gives you an endless li
brary of games, with new ones (mostly
ports of Super Nintendo classics) being re
leased every day. If you're an avid Game
Boy player, the decision is a no-brainer; it's
worth it to buy the SP solely for the backlit
display and the integrated rechargeable
battery. If, however, you've just got re-

ally big hands . . . dang, man,
what the heck are you doing

playing videogames?


Man, we've come a long way since the ENIAC
