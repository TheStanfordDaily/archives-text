### GENEVIEVE GUZMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every nine years, Ram's Head
Theatrical Society decides that it
is time for the classic American
musical adaptation of "Romeo
and Juliet" to return to the
Memorial Auditorium stage.
"West Side Story" is opening this
weekend for Ram's Head annual
spring show.
"It's the most enduring musical
ever," said producer Lauren
Kramer, a sophomore. "It speaks
to any time period."
"West Side Story" is playing at
8 p.m. April 11, 12, 17, 18 and 19
in Memorial Auditorium. Admis
sion is $ 15, or $9 for Stanford stu
dents.
"West Side Story" is about the
star-crossed love of Tony and
Maria, forbidden by racial ten
sions between the Americans and
the Puerto Ricans in 1950s New
York. Tony is a member of the
Jets, an Anglo street gang repre
senting the Montagues. Repre
senting the Capulet family is the

Sharks, the rival Puerto Rican
gang lead by Bernardo, Maria's
brother.
Sophomore Meredith Kendall,
cast as Maria, commented that it is
a huge honor to play her character.
"It is definitely the role of a life
time," she said.
David Baron, cast as Tony, ex
plained, "It's the hardest role I've
ever played in my life. I go from
complete jubilation to utter des
peration."
The production of "West Side
Story" is the first acting that
Baron, a freshman, has done at
Stanford.
According to Kramer, the big
names among the credits of "West
Side Story" are a big selling point.
"A musical that has the backing
ofSondheim and Berstein ... cap
tures the best of Broadway," she
said.
Famous lyricist Stephen Sond
heim and composer Leonard
Berstein collaborated on the
music of "West Side Story."

bins and Robert Wise. The screen
play was written by Ernest
Lehman.
Stanford "West Side Story" di
rector Sean Fenton, Class of
2002, decided that for this Ram's
Head production, he would stay
true to the original "West Side
Story."
"The original show is powerful
in and of itself," he explained.
"We didn't have to do anything
gimmicky with it just to feel like it
is our own."
Managing the cast of "West
Side Story," which is 40 strong,
has been the most difficult and the

most fulfilling aspect of the pro
duction for the Fenton.
"Directing a production on
this scale is a huge challenge," he
said. "Bringing all the elements
together — costumes, set, ex
tremely difficult choreography,
lights — is hard, but it's very re
warding to see people put in the
effort."
For Kramer, the cast was also
the best aspect of working on
"West Side Story."
"It's amazing to see the talent
Stanford produces," she said.
Kendall agrees with the direc
tor and producer's perception of
the quality of the cast.
"There are no weaknesses," she
said. "Everyone is performing at
their top potential. I can't help sit
ting backstage during rehearsal
and smiling."
