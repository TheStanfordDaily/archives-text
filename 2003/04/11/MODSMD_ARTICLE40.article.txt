# Intermission's online dating adventure
## Our guide to yourself on the internet 
### 
I am constantly getting spam in my inbox.
Last week I got an e-mail from
Match.com, the largest online dating
service with over 1 million registered users.
Instead of deleting it along with the penis
enlargement ads, I began to wonder what
kind of guys I could meet on a dating Web
site. More interestingly, what kind of guys
could I meet when pretending to be some
one else?

So, out of journalistic curiosity, a mis
placed admiration for Cindy Sherman film
stills and the freedom / boredom that comes
from being single, I registered on
Match.com under four different aliases (as
myself and as three other weirdos), submit
ed four different photos and waited for the
responses to come rolling in.
Here are the results:

Username 1: PinkLadyjennie (myself)
Heading: Quirky student seeks funny guy with "Fletch"-like
wit.
Profile: I can talk to you about anything related to pop cul
ture. Favorite things include: '80s sitcoms, Britney Spears
music videos, "Martha Stewart Living" (Free Martha!) and F.
Scott Fitzgerald's literary descriptions of women.
Personal Quote: "My choice is what I choose to do, and if I'm
causin' no harm it shouldn't bother you. Your choice is who
you choose to be, and if you're causin' no harm then you're
alright with me." — Ben Harper.
Responses: Eight in 24 hours.
This Stanford thing is killing me. The first response was a
Stanford alumnus, the second a Stanford grad student. The
next two asked if I went there. Most of the men were in their
30s. After a 15-minute conversation with a Class of2ooo grad
about how the dining halls at Stanford have changed since he
went here, 1 begin to feel like I'm at an alumni center lun
cheon. We also discussed the syllabus for my American Liter
ature class.
To their credit, they were a tamer, less creepy bunch of
men on average. Not surprisingly, almost all were college
graduates.
1. Stanford guy number one, an over achiever, notch.
"There'sjust so much to be learned, seen and experienced
from all the people / cultures. I love to discover new things
and I'm always reading books and taking classes. My true pas
sion is music and the fine arts. I play / perform classical, fla
menco, and rock guitar. I also write and record original songs
of all styles about whatever inspires me."
2. Stanford guy number two.
"I like to think of myself as a warm, considerate, profes
sional. Someone that you would not be afraid to take home to
meet mom. 1 guess that I am kind of shy at first but I do open
up once you get know me. I work a lot of hours."
3. He means his 39th birthday. That makes him 39-years-old. That's
old.
"I'm the president of a large company and find myself very
busy and kx)king for someone that is able keep things from
being so serious. I would love to meet you. If you're interest
ed, write me back and wish me a happy birthday."
4. Gee, lean balance responsibility with playful /wild fun! Yeah!
My ideal match is a sexy lady with a good sense of humor
and an education. Someone who can balance responsibility
with playful / wild fun and can be herself around me.
Username 2: JesusFreakßuth
Heading: Religious sweetheart looking fora partner in
Christ.
Profile: I'm a really down-to-earth, caring person who loves

Warning to potential suitors: My body belongs to God!

Responses:
Four for the Bible-thumper, but most wanted to just have
someone to talk to.
1. Poor guy. I feel like such a bitch for not being a real person.
"Hello, 1 recendy moved to Phoenix AZ. While there I met
my girlfriend who is a devout Christian. I had never really
went to church, but my girlfriend took me and I started to get
into it. I am still a beginner and have a long way to go. I just
came back here to work and straighten some debts out for 3-
6 months. Then I will be going back.
Anyway what I am trying to say is that none of my friends
are into church back here, and I would really like if you
would be interested in hanging out and taking me to church
with you. I would appreciate it very much if you'd consider.
1 hope to hear from you soon."
2. Sorry, but you 're going to have to keep hxtking, Intddy.
"I saw your picture and thought you were extremely at
tractive and checked your profile and saw that you were a
Christian and was amazed for 1 am a Christian as well. I am a
Southern Baptist who has just come back from a mission trip
about week ago. I'm 22,6'4" about 240.1 have a very athlet
ic build. I don't mean to look like a guy who spends his life in
a gym, but I do.
I come from a huge country family that is all Christians,
and we all love to celebrate Christ together. I am looking into
doing a lot more mission work. If nothing comes from this

just know that there is another Christian wondering around
looking for the one that God has put out there for me to find."
3. Umm ...
"I giggle a lot, and tuck in stuffed animals to bed. (*grin*)"

Username 3: AngryGrrrlEmily
Heading: Hardcore goth chic seeks intense, silent type.
Profile: I think that our society is seriously fucked up. I am
not a typical 20 year-old. 1 am concerned about a lot of seri
ous issues and
write poetry.
Here's my latest haiku, "Society Kills":
Society kills
Tells you to consume it all.
Be quiet and die.

Responses: Seven.
I figure that these e-mails were from guys who wanted a
challenge.
1. AU-Ameiican guy turned on by prisoners.
"You look like a criminal in your picture! But you sound
like one of those frustrated and angst-ridden goth kids. I'm
hoping you stick more closely to the criminal image — that
would be hot."
2. Wow, nothing gets by you, Sherlock.
"Is that tough exterior just to keep anyone from getting
close?"
3. When I grow up, I want to be a unicorn! Or a robot-maker.
"I have zillions of little projects that I'm working on. I'm
building a robot, prototyping a piece of music equipment
(potentially to sell), circuit bending, and I've just started
working on scoring a sci-fi film!"
4. Sometimes Ijust feel sad.
"Hello dear, I would like to make a friendship with you.
Would you be interested with an Asian guy? Please replay my
e-mail if you do."

Username 4: Crazy SexySin-dy
Heading: Fun-loving hottie looking fora good time with
YOU!
Profile: 1 am a free spirit through and through. I will try any
thing at least once. 1 love excitement and taking risks. You
only live life once, right? I am a wild girl; so don't approach
me unless you think you can handle me because I won't be
tamed!
Personal Quote: She loves to go drinking with the boys. She
loves to go out and make some noise." — Social Distortion.
Responses: 32 and counting.

1. Ijow-fal guy
"I'm in very good shape, 8 percent body fat
... I'm a gourmet cook and love to make pas
tries, but mostly I give them away because you
see, they are so fattening. I am very much into
being healthy so all the gourmet food I pre
pare for myself is always very healthy and low
in fat, everybody else get the fattening stuff."
2. "I already have a room."
"I need a date fora wedding in Vegas... lam
very interested in meeting you. Let me know
you can bring a friend (girl) — I already have
a room. Call me or shoot an email. I will send
a pic and then we can meet fora drink. Talk to
you soon."
3. Tempting, but all the good porn star names are
taken. And what's with Vegas?
"I'm 34. I'm a writer, director, producer. I
make adult movies. I think you said something
about wild and crazy? You only live once?
Well, how crazy would it l)e to appear in a
movie? Be on a poster? Be on a video box in
every video store in the world? How crazy
would that be? How crazy would it be to at
tend the AVN Awards next January in Las
Vegas as the next new star?
"That would be pretty crazy.
"I'm an easy-going guy. If you're interested
in what I just laid out... then lets have a drink
and talk about it. I'll show you some pictures of
my male actors. You tell me who you like. I ell
me what interests you ... and we'll go from
there. Casual ... no pressure. You do only
live once. You can either embrace your air
rent lifestyle... or bump it up to the next
level."
Pouty lips and a side part tinsfanfly ransform
me into frisky Sin-dy.
4.1 would hale to catch him on "a bad lip day."

"Retired at 38, talkative, romantic, uniquely entertaining,
handsome, good kisser (unless I'm having a bad lip day),
housebroken, extremely neat, unmotivated to get a job, sleep
till 9 a.m. daily, golfer, shave ever)' 4 days...
1 love to pamper myself and others around me (there's
nothing like a g(Kxi day at the spa!!). Very social... love to be
with people... love to be alone at home. Two dogs, a Ijeagle
named Pepsi, and a basenji named Paris (aren't those cute
names??), and I live in a yellow house with a white picket
fence and a beautiful rose garden."
5. Racial jnofiler.
I am a very handsome white male in his 50s, tall, well
dressed, fun, fit, sexy, healthy, clean and generous. 1 am
looking fora younger (exotic-looking) Asian lady for an on
going discrete and rewarding friendship.
6. Jerry Seinfeld with access to the good drugs.
"I'm a successful 44-year-old pharmacist. Being a phar
macist I eat well and take several supplements. Having phys
ical and mental
well-being is not enough. I always look for the comedy in
everyday activities. Much like a Seinfeld-esque approach to
life. I just need
a woman to be my Elaine."
7. You haven't scared me.. .yet.
"I'm really a homebody and like spending quiet evenings
at home. I do like to go out sometimes, but it has to be with
someone special. I have a craving for sushi, especially
maguro. 1 hope I haven't scared you too much. I don't know
where this is going, but hopefully it's something good ..
8. OK, now I'm scared.
"... Everyone needs goals. Here are a few of mine: 1. Get my
broker's license. 2. Get married and have a family. And most im
portantly: 3. Go to Antarctica and kick a penguin. I don't want
to hurt it, I just want to go up behind one and top it in the rear
widi my foot. I just want to see what he will do."
9. Sounds like he's had some had experiences with men.

"When you are tired of boring guys with no personality,
guys proposing marriage from one e-mail or think commit
ment is leaving the same channel on the TV for 5 minutes,
look nothing like the photos they send you, have more hair
on their knuckles than their head, they stand 6-feet ta11... in
4-inch heels, show up for your date in high tops and a wife
beater show up in their parent's family truckster station
wagon, think a fun date is how many shots you can do before
happy hour is up, or lasdy, if they get to the point of kissing
you and they kiss likejabba the Hut... you should shoot me
an e-mail."
10. He's definitely not a poet. Bui he doesn't know it.
"I sigh so high, so high I could fly. Fly fly away... come
again some
other day... maybe in May... cause you might say that you
miss me and I
wouldn't want that, cause you'd feel like a door mat, who lost
her chance. To be stepped on by Lance, another guy not me,
maybe Lance is 60... I'd hate him though ... and no ...
my mom ain't no ho.
"I'm creative as fuck ... I wish I had a duck, a white one
that waddles, and swims with paddles. I'm a rhyming master,
a funk disaster... A bumping Impala, a pit bull named Nala,
rusty jeans, hip hop scene. Free stylin pimp daddy bitch with
his mind on his money and his hand on his clip. —
"Diiiiiiccckkk! Fuck dat nigger, you be smokin crack up yo
ass?
"Mother Fucker... die only crack I've been smokin is yo
mamma's crack... WHILE I FUCKED IT!!!
"I know I'm horny and real corny... but
for now it's fun, cause I'm a little drunk, and I could rhyme
forever, oh what an endeavor.:) LOL."
11. The most innuendo I've gotten since that last date dash.
"Hi there wild woman of the west. Jill of the jungle.
Sounds like you need a can of ass whoopin to tame you. Let
me cage you up and if you are nice, I'll let you free to attack
me."
12./ checked — his Web site is legit. Verdict is still (rut on him
"You sure are one sexy mama!!! I'd love to hook up with
you. You'd be great to model for my catalog. I own a ladies
wholesale clothing company. You can check it out at
www.a2zwholesalers.coin. Let me know what you think.
Ciao..
13. More figures of speech than the SA T.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm Frosted Flakes because Tin gr
rreeeeeat.' I'm definitely not Fruity Pebbles. Sometimes I'm
corny like Corn Puffs. My VieUiamcse likes to snap crackle
pop like Rice Krispies. Wholesome like Raisin Bran with two
scoops but not as boring as Grapenuts... I hope :).
"I like to keep it cheery like Cheerios. Sorry silly rabbit, I
ain't no Trix or kid but sometimes can be koo-koo for Coco
Puffs. I never was Special K but sometimes I feel that I
sniffed some. Definitely you'd be Lucky Charmed if you re
spond. So eat your Wheaties and get to it because I'm magi
cally delicious!"
(Conclusion:
Skanky Jennie got the most varied responses,
while the real me attracted boring older men and
Stanford grads. I still fared better than Bible Jen
nie — I guess if you want to meet your spiritual
match, you'll have to let your church do the pimp
work for you. Gothic Jennie got a decent number
of responses; either guys were intrigued by her bit
ter mystique or didn't read the haiku.
Basically, guys don't like Jesus as much as they
like sex. If you're looking for something serious or
to make some great new friends, Match.com isn't
your best bet. But if you want to get invited to
Vegas by a stranger or break into the exciting
world of adult entertainment, then you could hit
paydirt with this site. Just be sure to wear your sex
iest top and look hot.
