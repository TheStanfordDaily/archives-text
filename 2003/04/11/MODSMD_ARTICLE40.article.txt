# Intermission's online dating adventure
## Our guide to yourself on the internet 
### 
I am constantly getting spam in my inbox.
Last week I got an e-mail from
Match.com, the largest online dating
service with over 1 million registered users.
Instead of deleting it along with the penis
enlargement ads, I began to wonder what
kind of guys I could meet on a dating Web
site. More interestingly, what kind of guys
could I meet when pretending to be some
one else?

So, out of journalistic curiosity, a mis
placed admiration for Cindy Sherman film
stills and the freedom / boredom that comes
from being single, I registered on
Match.com under four different aliases (as
myself and as three other weirdos), submit
ed four different photos and waited for the
responses to come rolling in.
Here are the results:

Username 1: PinkLadyjennie (myself)
Heading: Quirky student seeks funny guy with "Fletch"-like
wit.
Profile: I can talk to you about anything related to pop cul
ture. Favorite things include: '80s sitcoms, Britney Spears
music videos, "Martha Stewart Living" (Free Martha!) and F.
Scott Fitzgerald's literary descriptions of women.
Personal Quote: "My choice is what I choose to do, and if I'm
causin' no harm it shouldn't bother you. Your choice is who
you choose to be, and if you're causin' no harm then you're
alright with me." — Ben Harper.
Responses: Eight in 24 hours.
This Stanford thing is killing me. The first response was a
Stanford alumnus, the second a Stanford grad student. The
next two asked if I went there. Most of the men were in their
30s. After a 15-minute conversation with a Class of2ooo grad
about how the dining halls at Stanford have changed since he
went here, 1 begin to feel like I'm at an alumni center lun
cheon. We also discussed the syllabus for my American Liter
ature class.
To their credit, they were a tamer, less creepy bunch of
men on average. Not surprisingly, almost all were college
graduates.
1. Stanford guy number one, an over achiever, notch.
"There'sjust so much to be learned, seen and experienced
from all the people / cultures. I love to discover new things
and I'm always reading books and taking classes. My true pas
sion is music and the fine arts. I play / perform classical, fla
menco, and rock guitar. I also write and record original songs
of all styles about whatever inspires me."
2. Stanford guy number two.
"I like to think of myself as a warm, considerate, profes
sional. Someone that you would not be afraid to take home to
meet mom. 1 guess that I am kind of shy at first but I do open
up once you get know me. I work a lot of hours."
3. He means his 39th birthday. That makes him 39-years-old. That's
old.
"I'm the president of a large company and find myself very
busy and kx)king for someone that is able keep things from
being so serious. I would love to meet you. If you're interest
ed, write me back and wish me a happy birthday."
4. Gee, lean balance responsibility with playful /wild fun! Yeah!
My ideal match is a sexy lady with a good sense of humor
and an education. Someone who can balance responsibility
with playful / wild fun and can be herself around me.
Username 2: JesusFreakßuth
Heading: Religious sweetheart looking fora partner in
Christ.
Profile: I'm a really down-to-earth, caring person who loves
helping other people. Right now, I am
in college to become a veterinary assistant because I love ani-

mals sooo much. I am a devout Christian who goes to church
every Sunday and prays at least 6 times a day.
Warning to potential suitors: My body belongs to God!

Responses:
Four for the Bible-thumper, but most wanted to just have
someone to talk to.
1. Poor guy. I feel like such a bitch for not being a real person.
"Hello, 1 recendy moved to Phoenix AZ. While there I met
my girlfriend who is a devout Christian. I had never really
went to church, but my girlfriend took me and I started to get
into it. I am still a beginner and have a long way to go. I just
came back here to work and straighten some debts out for 3-
6 months. Then I will be going back.
Anyway what I am trying to say is that none of my friends
are into church back here, and I would really like if you
would be interested in hanging out and taking me to church
with you. I would appreciate it very much if you'd consider.
1 hope to hear from you soon."
2. Sorry, but you 're going to have to keep hxtking, Intddy.
"I saw your picture and thought you were extremely at
tractive and checked your profile and saw that you were a
Christian and was amazed for 1 am a Christian as well. I am a
Southern Baptist who has just come back from a mission trip
about week ago. I'm 22,6'4" about 240.1 have a very athlet
ic build. I don't mean to look like a guy who spends his life in
a gym, but I do.
I come from a huge country family that is all Christians,
and we all love to celebrate Christ together. I am looking into
doing a lot more mission work. If nothing comes from this

just know that there is another Christian wondering around
looking for the one that God has put out there for me to find."
3. Umm ...
"I giggle a lot, and tuck in stuffed animals to bed. (*grin*)"

Username 3: AngryGrrrlEmily
Heading: Hardcore goth chic seeks intense, silent type.
Profile: I think that our society is seriously fucked up. I am
not a typical 20 year-old. 1 am concerned about a lot of seri
ous issues and
write poetry.
Here's my latest haiku, "Society Kills":
Society kills
Tells you to consume it all.
Be quiet and die.
