# Goerne's unorthodox style makes Schubert memorable

### HART GILULA

Ihe lieder gods were smiling down on San
Francisco when they offered us Matthias Go
eme in all three of Schubert's song cycles. He
doesn't have Wunderlich's gorgeous, crys
talline sound or Hampson's inward intellec
tualism, but this is OK: Matthias Goerne is the
everyman's lieder singer. I don't mean this
pejoratively. Goerne sings with such excite
ment, he immediately endears himself to his
audience. He has stories to tell and we want to
hear them.
What I immediately noticed about Go
erne was how unassumingly he entered. He
sauntered onstage in a wrinkled, ill-fitted suit
wearing no bow or necktie, though his stan
dard style of dress shirt called for one. He
launched into the first cycle of the concert se
ries, "Die Schone Miillerin," with great gusto.
Coupled with this gusto, though, was his ec
centric performance style.
Goerne has quite a bag of odd tics and
mannerisms — mast noticeable of these Ls the
nose-grabbing. I counted — though I con
fess having been tipped off ahead of time to
look for this—23 nose grabs in "Miillerin," 20
in "Schwanengesang" and an astounding 32
in "Winterreise." The nose grabs are distinc
tive in that he does not simply wipe his nose or
discreetly scratch it; he integrates these grabs
into his performance, emphatically pulling
on his proboscis as he contemplates a sorrow
ful phrase in the piano part.
None of the audience members that I
polled noticed his nose fiddling; most were
struck by the awed innocence in his perfor
mance: He seemed to rediscover these
songs each time he sings them. With a very
zealous enthusiasm, Goerne viscerally grabs
hold of his audience and yanks it into the
world of the cycle. During some songs, he
hangs onto the lid of the piano, shifting his
weight from heel to ball of foot, swaying
back and forth as he teeters through his oc
casionally perilous journey. Along with this
very mobile stage presence, Goerne pos
sesses a wide-eyed eagerness to communi
cate. He constantly pans the room with his
gaze, a practice quite contrary to the more
traditional practice of finding and singing to
a fixed point above the eye-line of the audi
ence.
Such a technique is partly controversial be
cause, though Goerne engages his audience,
he does not necessarily create a "whole" char
acter. Rather, he alternates from embodying
the character singing the songs to a more re
moved, narrative role. Though some find
Goerne's idiosyncrasies unbearable, I found
them at worst, excusable and at best, endear
ing. Yes, his eyes constantly scan die room,
but his audience Ls also noticeably engaged—
not an easy feat considering an audience
made up of non-German speaking Ameri
cans accustomed to frequent commercial
breaks.
Though Goerne does not exhibit the
placidity that characterized his teachers' per
formances, (he is the musical progeny of Di
etrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elizabeth
Schwarzkopf), he does share their keenly sen
sitive attention to text Goerne's startling facil

ity for text painting made "Der Doppel
ganger" (in "Schwanengesang") the most
thrilling performance of the three evenings.
In a smart programmatic move, Go
erne sang Beethoven's cycle "An die feme
Geliebte" first. He then followed the Rell
stab settings of "Schwanengesang" with an
intermission, showcasing the sublime
Heine poems in their own second half. He
finished the program by using the frivo
lous "Die Taubenpost" as an encore, there
by allowing "Der Doppelganger" its maxi
mum impact.

For "Doppelganger," he masterfully cre
ated such a palpable, supernatural aura that it
left me both chilled and awed. He set the
mood with possessed eyes and an unusually
rigid demeanor. Goerne incredibly phrased
the second verse of the song, in which the nar
rator first sees his double, digging into the low
notes on" Da steht" ;md lingering on the "sch"
of "Mensch." The song's low notes showcased
Goerne's rich lower range; his voice really
blossoms below the staff.
Of course, one cannot simply credit
three great recitals to the singer alone, espe
cially for Schubert cycles which demand true
synergy between the singer and pianist. Eric
Schneider played solidly at the piano, clearly
aware of the cycles' musico-textual subtleties.
Sometimes, he would stare up toward the
rooflooking wondrously enlightened, as if re
ceiving Schubert's advice from beyond the
grave. Given the consummate level of these
recitals, I would not be at all surprised if that
was in feet, the case.

cause, though Goerne engages his audience,
he does not necessarily create a "whole" char
acter. Rather, he alternates from embodying
the character singing the songs to a more re
moved, narrative role. Though some find
Goerne's idiosyncrasies unbearable, I found
them at worst, excusable and at best, endear
ing. Yes, his eyes constantly scan die room,
but his audience Ls also noticeably engaged—
not an easy feat considering an audience
made up of non-German speaking Ameri
cans accustomed to frequent commercial
breaks.
Though Goerne does not exhibit the
placidity that characterized his teachers' per
formances, (he is the musical progeny of Di
etrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elizabeth
Schwarzkopf), he does share their keenly sen
sitive attention to text Goerne's startling facil

ity for text painting made "Der Doppel
ganger" (in "Schwanengesang") the most
thrilling performance of the three evenings.
In a smart programmatic move, Go
erne sang Beethoven's cycle "An die feme
Geliebte" first. He then followed the Rell
stab settings of "Schwanengesang" with an
intermission, showcasing the sublime
Heine poems in their own second half. He
finished the program by using the frivo
lous "Die Taubenpost" as an encore, there
by allowing "Der Doppelganger" its maxi
mum impact.

For "Doppelganger," he masterfully cre
ated such a palpable, supernatural aura that it
left me both chilled and awed. He set the
mood with possessed eyes and an unusually
rigid demeanor. Goerne incredibly phrased
the second verse of the song, in which the nar
rator first sees his double, digging into the low
notes on" Da steht" ;md lingering on the "sch"
of "Mensch." The song's low notes showcased
Goerne's rich lower range; his voice really
blossoms below the staff.
Of course, one cannot simply credit
three great recitals to the singer alone, espe
cially for Schubert cycles which demand true
synergy between the singer and pianist. Eric
Schneider played solidly at the piano, clearly
aware of the cycles' musico-textual subtleties.
Sometimes, he would stare up toward the
rooflooking wondrously enlightened, as if re
ceiving Schubert's advice from beyond the
grave. Given the consummate level of these
recitals, I would not be at all surprised if that
was in feet, the case.
