# Sept 11 tragedy drives plot tastefully
## 
### JENNY ZHANG 
So you've got your eye on the couch and your
arm around a book, you've been meaning to read.
When you turn to the first page, you want to be
swept away to a world where no one cares if Jen
nifer Lopez wore that garish green eye shadow to
the Oscars... right?
Well try forgetting about the here and now,
when barely a third into Joyce Maynard's
newest book, "The Usual Rules," a character
declares, "You are not one bit fat... You're
just going to be more of the Jennifer Lopez
type, and I'm more Jennifer Love Hewitt."
From start to finish Maynard bombards us with
the present — referring to "Pokemon," "Who
Wants to be a Millionaire," Josh Hartnett, Mr.
Rogers and the most recognizable, inescapable
reference of all: The Sept. 11 bombing of the
World Trade Center.
And yet, Maynard manages to keep the fic
tional dream alive through characters that are vi
brant enough to hold their own. "The Usual
Rules" is more than just a book about Sept. 11. It
is a book that is ultimately focused on relation
ships and the ways in which we neglect, develop
and lose them.
The book's protagonist, Wendy, is a 13-year
old girl who goes off to school the morning of 9/11
without saying goodbye to her mother. When her
mother never comes back from her office job on
the 87th floor of the World Trade Center, Wendy
must find ways to cope with her loss. "She didn't
want to picture her mother huddled in her san
dals and red dress in some dusty air pocket. Bet
ter to think other wandering around Newjersey,
barefoot, with her hair flying."
But the book is also about Wendy's fa
ther, who shows up one day and offers to take her
back with him to California after several years of
being absent from her life.
It is about the colorful people Wendy meets in
her new life in California: Her Cither's girlfriend
who loves cacti the way some women love shoes,

The Usual Rules
/LSSL \ J°y ce Maynard
r

a 15-year-old skateboarding vagrant who is out to
reunite with his older brother, a txxikstore owner
who drives out once a week to do laundry with his
autistic son, a teenage mother who watches
"Maury Povich" in her apartment and the ways
they deal with loss in their own lives.
It is about being 13, kissing someone for the
first time and realizing that it wasn't necessarily
"something a person would do at one precise mo
ment, like sticking a stamp on an envelope."
In"The Usual Rules," Maynard show us both
edges of heartbreak. Wendy remembers die Fri
day nights she spent dancing with her mom to the
soundtrack of "Guys and Dolls," just as clearly as
she remembers the times she purposely said
things to hurt her mother, like, "You probably
read my diary, too, right? The part where I talk
about how pathetic it is — you finding some guy
who follows you around like a dog, to make you
feel like you're so great after all."
In the aftermath of 9/11, Maynard takes us
everywhere we would expert, people wandering
around Ground Zero in a daze, posters of missing
loved ones covering street corners, families weep
ing in the streets. But Maynard also offers
glimpses into moments that didn't make it into
the "60 Minutes: Remembering 9/11" one-hour
special — like when a kid in Wendy's eighth
grade class decides for Halloween, "he was going
to be Osama bin Laden, and Mrs. Volt said, 'In
appropriate, Buddy'."
At one point, Maynard remarks, "unimagin
able things could happen in the most regular
places." What makes "The Usual Rules" a true
gem is the way "unimaginable things" come to
mean both the excruciatingly awful and the sur
prisingly wonderful.
