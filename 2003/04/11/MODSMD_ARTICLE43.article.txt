# BLACKstreet's back, alright!
## 
### JONATHAN BEARD 
In 1996, the relatively unknown new
jack-swinging BLACKstreet exploded to

megastardom with a monster hit that an-"
nounced they "like the way you work it." Built

on a classic Bill Withers sample and featuring a

cameo appearance by Dr. Dre, "No Diggity" became
the kind of hit that not only defines a group, but helps
to define a genre or a decade. Fueled by the success of
"No Diggity" and two other hit singles, BLACKstreet
got to watch their album, "Another Level," make them
one of the best selling acts of the '90s, only to then
nearly disintegrate due to internal squabbling, law
suits and personnel changes.
Now—after the less successful follow up, "Finally,"
in 1999 and four years of downtime — the BLACK
street lineup that gave us "Another Level" has put
aside differences and reunited to give us the not-so
subtly-titled "Level II." Produced largely by the
group's leader (and New Jack Swing godfather)
Teddy Riley, "Level II" gamely tries to re-insert
BLACKstreet as a relevant player into the ever-chang
ing hip-hop / R&B world.
Whether it will be successful remains to be seen.
Level II is conflictingly bittersweet to listen to. On the
one hand, so many producers working nowadays owe
their sound to Riley's cutting-edge production tech
niques of the late '80s and '90s, most notably The Nep
tunes, who were discovered and given their break by
Riley himself. On the other hand, The Neptunes et al.

Level II

have eclipsed him by now in
popularity, and at times
"Level II" sounds like Riley
is just trying to keep up with
his younger, hipper pro
teges instead of sticking to
his own guns.

Riley is at his best when he's not trying to sound like
die latest Rodney, Pharrell or She'kspere but instead
creating the kind of dynamic soul-infused tracks that
he's always excelled at. "She's Hot" and "Wizzy Wow"
could easily be the heirs to "No Diggity's" throne; as
for the slow stuff, there are two tracks that especially
stand out. "Bygones," rooted in beautiful weavings of
acoustic guitar, strings and stellar vocal harmonies, is
a personal and touching ode to repairing old friend
ships. The song rings true, as Riley asked original
BLACKstreet member David Hollister to guest on
"Bygones" in the spirit of the song's theme. Even more
impressive is "Look in the Water," which is one of the
most dynamic, effective pieces of modern soul in re
cent memory.
Hie lyrics on Level II leave something to be desired
at times (I don't think I could handle another use of the
rhyme "understand" with "man,") but we don't listen to
these kind of records for lyrics — we listen for cool beats
and sweet harmonies. The album falters when these in
gredients aren't present; however, when Riley allows
one or both to take center stage, the results are solid and
sweet. In the end, "Level II" lacks a certain coherence
as a whole album, but it truly has wonderful moments.


"A movie about politics? Yeah, right!"
