Random Person: Who'reyou going to see, again ?
Karan: The Vines.
Random Person: Er... cool.
Karan: Man, their lead singer is SO messed up.
He's going to die. /give him a year at most.

Years from now, when this four
line abstraction is cited as evidence
of my insensitivity, I will say (as I doj
now) — "People, it's the band'sl
marketing shtick!" Few of you will'
counter the evidence that The Vines

are largely a side-project for Craig

Nichols' fucked-upness, and even fewer will
mud-wrestle me if I were to say that they're
chewing the Nirvana cud and drinking
themselves to death.
But you can never judge people, can
you? For starters, The Vines are the most
selfless creatures on this planet: Why else
would they let a band that's infinitely better
than them in every regard — The Music —
open for them? A British band, no less, one
that caters to the latent anglophilia of all
those in the crowd and thinks semi-colons
are passe.
For The Music, every banal word is a ser
mon ("Discoooo!"), and '60s psychedelia is a
template for techno guitar-tweaking. Rob
Harvey (the lead singer) has perfected his
hippy-prophet delinquency and obtained a
licensed version of Robert Plant 2.0. He's
now officially my favorite ventriloquist
dummy — he's got the projection, the re
verb, the fast-forward gyrations and I've
even forgiven the band for picking a name
like The Music.
But enough about The Music. Let's talk

Concert review
W

about The Vines.
Fact #1: The Vines = 3 Australian band
members + 1 acoustic guitarist.
Fact #2: Craig Nichols is, in fact, messed
up: Stoned immaculate, equipped with a
guitar and beer bottle.
Fact #3: He's not a very skilled fuck-up.
Conflating those two observations leads

us to the obvi
ous conclusion:
Craig Nichols
needs to re
hearse his
drunkenness if
he wants to get

anywhere. After all, what right do drunks
have to be clumsy when you're paying for
them? Live up to your marketing shtick,
d'ya hear?
But enough irony: The music itself was
inoffensive, creaky and sluggish in the cho
ruses. Nichols spent a better part of his
childhood licking the covers of Nirvana al
bums, but he sounds more like a desperate
Ghallagher to me: charmingly, his tongue
zaps out like a screaming Simpsons charac
ter, and exerts enough force on his gullet to
keep the beer down. He's a great singer/
wailer, but the choruses seem curiously
slowed-down in concert. What The Vines
really need is a spinal chord, a Dave Grohl
for their Nirvana ambitions.
The surprise of the evening was The
Vines' cover of "Miss Jackson," but it was
surprise that overstayed its duration and
begged for more closure. On their album,
The Vines filed all their songs down to
two-minute cameos and didn't give any
one the time to realize they lacked sub
stance: they smartly used brevity to con

tain the critical acclaim.
That career-enhancing closure is lost in
concert as the band stretches out the verse
chorus-verse formula on their tender
pinkies; or maybe the songs just felt longer.
"Highly Evolved" comes across as a bad
Oasis song, "Outathaway" was, well, just
that, and the slower numbers ("My Home,"
"Mary Jane") led to stubbed cigarettes and
downed drinks. The hip "Factory" was a no
table omission from the set.
The raging "Get Free" was clearly the
best song of the night — I really did want to
pickle his larynx and take it home in a bot
de. As in every other song, Nichols tried to
fall convincingly, then failed, then held
himself back, and thus set new standards for
the post of Clumsy Rock God.

Finally, despite all my critical insistences,
I feel like I got my money's worth during
the encore. Moshing ensued, drums speed
ed up and in one final moment that brought
it all together, Craig Nichols defiantly
smashed his guitar against the drum-kit.
There's nothing quite like thinking — "Oh
shit, the drummer's dead" — on a Saturday
night, but the casualties were minimal.
Those in the crowd who got beer spat on
them blinked politely as the mikes hit the
floor and the hapless Fillmore staff.
We left a stage full of instrument puree
and burnt-out guitar fury. Go watch him be
fore he dies.

Editor's Note: Karan Mahajan apologizes for
being insensitive ... perhaps.
