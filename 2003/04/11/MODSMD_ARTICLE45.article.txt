# The
						Walkmen: these New Yorkers haven't heard of you either
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN 
The Walkmen, in all truth, are misrepresented
by the"The" that precedes their name:
They're too atmospheric and panoramic to
be confined to a garage even if their produc
tion aesthetics are purposely ragged. When I reviewed
their debut album "Everyone Who Pretended To Like
Me Is Gone" a few months ago, I was blown away by
Hamilton Leithauser's soaring oh-no-it's-Bono vocals
and the band's blend of pianos, guitars and organs. I
redirected all my friends to the Saturn commercial that
featured the delicately cynical "We've Been Had."
To rewind a little, The Walkmen were formed circa
2000 from the wreckage of Jonathan Fire* Eater and
The Recoys and have accumulated considerable criti
cal buzz since. And yes, they're from New York. I
talked recently to lead vocalist Hamilton Leithauser on
the phone on the subject of how The Walkmen got to
gether, their experiences in their own studio, their in
fluences, what to expect from the next album and
other randomness.
Intermission: So, on "We've Been Had" you claim that
you don't like "dumb haircuts from 1960." What type

of haircut do you have and what do you recommend
for our readers?
Hamilton Leithauser: [laughs] I've never heard such a
question before. My hair's kind of shaggy, I need a
haircut.
INT: The band is from New York — did you grow up
there?
HL: No, I grew up in I)C, everyone in the band did.
INT: There's generally a lot of talk about the New
York scene — do you think people will look back 10
years from now and talk about New York's garage rock
movement of 2002?
HL: I m not sure. I guess people really like bands like
The Strokes and Interpol now. I don't know if people
are going to see it as a movement. The music's really
different between all the bands... I think maybe peo
ple will like the bands but I don't think it's really going
to stick as a rock movement.
INT: How did you guys get together?
HL: The Recoys were sort of breaking up because peo
ple were really losing interest, and Jonathan
Fire* Eater had already broken up. They were looking
for someone to play with, and The Recoys were really
dying. I had wanted to play with the J F*E guys, and
we had similar musical tastes, so I actually just called
them and asked them if they wanted to play.
INT: What are your musical tastes? Who are your
major influences?

HL: Over the years, the biggest ones have been
Jonathan Richman, Modern Lovers, I could go on for
ever . . . The Cramps were always an influence on us.
Randy Newman, The Beach Boys; we liked Joy Divi
sion, sort of. I mean, I don't know, there are millions
of bands that we like. Those are big heavy-hitters.
INT: Any contemporary rock bands that you really ad
mire and respect?
HL: I like The Scene Creamers (from DC) a lot.
INT. Any other contemporary rock bands?
HL: To tell you the truth? No.
INT: That's harsh, man.
HL: Just really haven't found anyone I like that much
... I wish there were more. I like The Scene Creamers,
I like the Royal Trucks a lot, but they broke up.
INT: Did you guys try out any other names before you
got to The Walkmen?
HL: Yeah, it was just like part of a list. We were just sit
ting down, we had to think of a name for some reason,

I forget why, and
the other names
were really awe
some — they were
The Sheeps, The

Motorboats, The
Robots, The Mur
derers — but that
was taken. Those

are the big ones I remember. I liked The Sheeps the
most — with the's' at the end.
INT: Do you have any expectations of when you're
going to "break"? How're the album sales?
HL: Record sales are much more than we ever expect
ed them to be, so we're all really happy with the way it's
going.
INT: "We've Been Had" is featured on the Saturn ad.
How'd you land that?
HL: They just sent us an e-mail that had an amount of
money and a finished version of the commercial. We'd
never heard . . . they just went ahead and made it. And
then we said, "go right ahead."
INT: How would you respond to people who will see
this as a sign of you guys selling out and going com
mercial?
HL: Well, if they had a reasonable argument I'd listen
to them. I mean, I think it's a tacky thing to do — I
don't think it's anything to be really proud of, but we
don't have any record label backing us; we don't have
any source of income at all besides our shows, so this
commercial is what's going to let us record this next
record. I don't know, if somebody had something be
yond a vague notion — if they had a reasonable argu
ment, I'd listen to them but I never have heard any
thing like that.
INT: So, talking about the next album, how's that com
ing. When can we expect it?

HL: It is coming along really well now ... we had
about a seven- or eight-month dry spell where we
couldn't write songs, and it was really looking bleak,
but now it seems like we're at the end of that. We're
going into the studio on April 7, and we're going to
record.
INT: And this studio would be your own studio, where
the first album was recorded?
HL: Actually, this time we're going to try —just 'cause
all we ever do is spend time in our studio, and we're re
ally sick of that room — doing stuff in another studio
and see if it works out.
INT: Is there any big difference we can expect in the
sound of the next record? Are you guys making any
conscious shifts?
HL: It wasn't anything conscious, but I think it will
sound different. I think that everyone says we have a
very different live sound and recorded sound. I think
for this record we're going to go for the live sound.
INT: How does your songwriting process work?
HL: Very collaborative. Usually Paul will bring in a
small musical idea and we try to get everyone playing
it, and it's sounding good to them — if it does, which it
hardly ever does, but if it does, then I take it home and
I try to write the words and the melody.

INT: You've been compared to U2 quite a bit. What do
you think of that comparison — do you take it as a
compliment?
HL: I guess I take it as a compliment. I'm not like the
biggest U2 fan in the world but they have good stuff, so
it's fine. It's weird how much people say it, but it
doesn't bother me.
INT: Do you read a lot of the reviews that are written
about you guys?
HL: I used to read like all of them, and now I don't re
ally, 'cause, I don't... it sort of drives you crazy after
a while. I just don't like how you're misquoted or mis
represented or something.
INT: Is there anything in particular that annoys you?
HL: I really didn't like . . . when we were starting
off, and people hadn't really heard us or seen us
but they would always say that we were like these
super-well dressed, like hipster guys wearing skin
ny ties, and we were all like neat and had our little
package together — it's just so not us. I guess we
don't get that anymore now because I guess people
have seen us or heard our music or something, but
it's so irritating when they write about you like they
know who you are, but they've never heard you or
seen you.
INT: What book have you been reading recently?
HL: Currently reading "Swan's Lake" by Proust — it's
like a bear, I don't know why I'm reading it. It's dense;
it's like reading a brick. It's just a big, intense book. I
don't know-it's just hard to read.
INT: Any cool hobbies?
HL: I play chess a lot.
