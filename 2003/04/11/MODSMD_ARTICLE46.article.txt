### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Don't despair, dear readers! Roxy has
heard your pleas for help. Today I am an
swering the most common questions I
hear from friends and strangers alike.
1. If two people hook up in the forest and
neither is sober enough to fully remember
it, do they make a sound?
Ah, the eternal question — if there are
witnesses to the pre-hook-up shenani
gans, then you can't deny your way out of
it regardless of your sporadic blackouts.
You can, however, say that you were
"sooo drunk" that even though you want
ed to get on him / her at the time, you
didn't completely understand what the
hell was going on. Of course people could
say you were just using alcohol to let your
self do what you secretly wanted to do all
along but didn't have the guts to do sober.
And they'd probably be right. But what
can you do, really? People are always talk
ing shit like that.
2. What is it about spring quarter that
makes everyone so horny?
Sunshine = warmth = good lovin' feel
ing. Also, it's the end of the year. At least one
quarter of the current student body will be
gone next year, so you might as well get on
the hot ones while they're still around.

3. Why does everyone bitch about Stan
ford girls? What's wrong with us?
Here are the top complaints about
Stanford girls: "They don't hook up" and
"They're ugly." Both of these generalities
are mosdy untrue. Stanford girls may not
hook up as much as some state school
coeds do, but 1 know fora fact that many
DO hook up. And on a positive note, the
chance of catching an STD from them is
much lower. As for the ugliness criticism,
not everyone can be as gorgeous as you,
buddy.
4. I don't get it— are athletes hot shit
here or what?
This is a complex question because
while the student body is proud of the
awesome sports teams here, many still
don't know who the individual athletes
are. One such girl, a friend of mine, po
litely and obliviously asked Teyo Johnson
to "please please please" do her laundry
for her (she offered him $7).
The other part of the student body,
albeit the minority, use their well-honed
study skills to track the every movement
of athletes or even full teams using
GoStanford.com and other Internet re
sources.
Athlete friends tell Roxy they generally
appreciate and are flattered by such ad
miration; but, even so, don't gush effu
sively or spout facts from your Google

search. Even cute stalkers are bad.
5. If I want to get a guy, do I have to ig
nore him?
Short answer: Yes.
More specifically: It depends on the
guy and situation, of course. Shy guys will
be deterred while the cocky bastard you
went out with last week will be intrigued.
6. If I want to get a girl, do I have to ig
nore her?
No, just get a girlfriend.
7. I'm sick of attracting guys that are balls
of shit. To get noticed by different guys,
should I act smart or dumb?
The plain truth is that many males,
even at Stanford, like to feel smarter than
the girl they're after.
But a lot of those guys suck anyway.
And you can't really complain that you
attract shitty men when you aren't being
yourself because those guys are re
sponding to the dumbed-down version
of yourself. It's safe to say that if you act
less like a ditsy madame and more like
the Madame Curie-in-training you truly
are, you'll attract better (fewer, but bet
ter) men.
