### CAITLIN CALLAGHAN 
"Bend it Like Beckham" is a charade of mistaken iden
tities, misinformation and some truly excellent footwork.
Jess Bhamra dreams of playing soccer like her Manchester
United hero, David Beckham. Balancing the roles of duti
ful daughter with local soccer dynamo, she restricts her

passion to the public parks. But when the opportu
nity arises to play on her local team, the Hounslow \
Harriers, Jess can't resist it. She claims she's busy with
a summer job and escapes to the pitch.
The basic structure of director / screenwriter
Gurinder Chadha's latest film seems almost for
mulaic. Jess' parents are caring and long-suffering,
and the movie revolves around the conflict be
tween Jess' wishes and their dreams for her. Add to
the mix her sister, Pinky — vain, superficial and

engaged to a glib but racially acceptable charmer. Jess'
coach, Joe, is a soccer player himself but is sidelined by
injury he has turned to coaching the women Hounslow
Harriers. A complex character with thwarted dreams
and a father who pushed him too hard, Irish Joe is a
predictable match for Jess' own ambitions and growing
pains. Like the planes that fly above Hounslow into
nearby Heathrow, Jess and Joe are symbols of the di
vergent cultures that take root in this soccer crazy film
— seemingly ignorant of one another until collision re
sults in catastrophe.
However; enter Jules, a white English girl with a moth
er who's convinced her daughter's an over-muscular les
bian. Ironically, what Paula (her mother) wants is pre
sented in Pinky Bhamra, a young woman obsessed with
boyfriends and shopping. Chanda's subtle presentation
is one of the film's highlights, and Paula, played wonder
fully by Juliet Stevenson, is the movie's driving comedic
force. Instead of seeing Jules as the gorgeous white girl
with the perfect family, we recognize two fumbling par

ents struggling to cope with a strong, talented and some
times rebellious daughter. This contrast is what lifts
"Bend it Like Beckham" from simple teenage fare to
complex film.
The friendship between Jules and Jess is emblematic

of the team spirit of the Hounslow
Harriers, and it is this that Chanda ex
ecutes with precision. In the locker

room, we see strong, hard-working soccer play-

ers with toned bodies, alternatively
arguing, cheering and laughing as
they wind down after long practices.
On the pitch they run laps, execute
drills and practice head shots. The
players are white, black and Indian.
In one of the film's bizarrely enter
taining moments, the Harriers help

Jess try to figure out how to put her best sari back on after
a game to get ready for her sister's wedding. The film's
cinematography is self-consciously arty, but nevertheless
the juxtaposition of clashing codes succeeds. We simply
see a group of dirty and sweaty soccer players rushing to
help a teammate.
In contrast to stereotypical Bollywood themes,
Chandha is tempted to overdose on big issues. In the
course of two hours the clash of disparate cultures, the
role of parents in modern society, race, homosexuality,
women in sports, cultural assimilation, marriage and sex
ual politics are tackled. Despite this hectic feel, there are
some glimpses of cinematic brilliance.ln one sequence, a
gay Indian man watches the Harriers play with his male
friends. Several of them comment on the breast size of
one of the players, and for the first time, we see the Har
riers through other eyes: As girls playing soccer, not soc
cer players who just happen to be girls. This insight is
complicated by the sexual orientation of the Indian ob
server; unable to come out, he must see the Harriers as

sexual objects. It is
an interesting in
tersection of view
points and values
that the movie suc
ceeds in pulling off.
While some of
the prejudices and
predicaments are
resolved by the end
of the film, others
are not. "Bend it
Like Beckham"
transcends the
genre of teenage
cinema by playing
with diese problems
and not simplifying
them. Ambiguities
are what make the
formulaic aspects
palatable, and one
of those ambiguities
is Beckham him
self.Throughout,
he watches silently
from the sidelines of
Jess' room in the
form of posters and
articles tacked to
her wall. He is the
soccer hero that

started it all for her, and as she runs into friendships, fam
ily dilemmas and defense lines, his quiet gaze from above
her bed is almost ominous. What does it mean fora female
Indian soccer player?
The answer lies somewhere in the film.
