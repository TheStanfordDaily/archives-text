# Walk to help fight AIDS
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In 10 cities across the United
States — including San Francis
co— local community members
will participate this Saturday in the
first annual "Student Global AIDS
Walk: A Call to Action." The nation
wide event, created and organized
by Stanford students, will raise
money for the Elizabeth Glaser Pe
diatric AIDS Foundation's treat
ment programs, which include pro
viding antiretroviral and other
AIDS-related medicines to sites in
over 250 locations in 17 countries.
The day's activities will include
speakers, live bands and food. Stu
dents from Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UC-San Francisco and many other
colleges and high schools are ex
pected to participate in the walk
that, aside from raising AIDS treat
ment hinds, also is intended to raise
awareness among college-age stu
dents and advocate political action.
"We wanted to make people feel
like they could do something about
(the AIDS pandemic]," said sopho
more Amrit Rao, who along with
sophomores Alex Bradford and
Christina Riechers founded the Stu
dent Global AIDS Walk program.
" This is mostly about educating and
mobilizing our peers.

"Every city has its own AIDS
walk," he continued. "But we ques
tion their ability to mobilize young
people."
According to Riechers, several
hundred students are expected to
participate in the San Francisco
walk, including approximately 200
from Stanford.
There are about 30 Stanford stu
dents currently assisting in organiz
ing the nationwide event, according
to Rao. National and associate di
rectors from Stanford oversee par
ticular cities and also choose city di
rectors, who are students familiar
with the city and who typically at
tend college there.
'Hie city directors then recruit
campus captains, who organize
teams of participants.
Senior Andres Turner, who has
organized a team for the walk, said
he became interested in the cause
"essentially through ... a speech
that some leader of a temple gave."
"He said, 'When they report the
deaths [from AIDS], the tombstones
should read accurately cause of
death: indifference,' " Turner said.
"This goes beyond any faith — it's a
global struggle. 1 think this [walk] is a
great event. It's very easy to mobilize,
it's a lot of fun, and it'll do wonders
for people across the ocean who
need our help."
Besides raising awareness
among college students, the orga
nizers are hoping to send a political
message.
Riechers said one goal is "to
make a stand to our government, to
show that students are passionate
about this cause and will donate
money and put in time and dedica
tion."
Rao added, "We're getting peo
ple from all over the nation to send
a unified message to the govern
ment, to their peers, to the world at
large — that AIDS is the crisis of our
generation.
"We need to show that we're se
rious about fighting this pandemic,"

he continued. "Especially now
when Bush is promising $15 billion
in AIDS treatment and without ex
plaining how he's going to do it."
In preparation for the event, a
discussion entitled "Fight Apathy
Towards HIV/AIDS: What the
Stanford Community Can Do" will
be held today at Tresidder Union's
Oak Room East. Speakers will in
clude Phil Pizzo, dean of the Med
ical School, Medical School Prof.
David Katzenstein and Donnovan
Yisrael, a sexual health educator at
the Vaden Student Health Center.
There will also be a discussion
about AIDS at 6 p.m. at the CoHo.
The San Francisco walk will be
held in Golden Gate Park with reg
istration and check-in beginning at
9 a.m. and the walk starting at 11
a.m. Students can also register at
www.studentglobalaidswalk.org.
Free transportation will be provid
ed to the walk, if requested.
