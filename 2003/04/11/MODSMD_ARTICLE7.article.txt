# Study shows that emotional health problems are rising on campuses
## Growing depression 
### JULIE PATEL 
For days, senior Lillian Ho
had been getting the urge to
shave her head. That, or cut her
self on the arm.
One day in February, she woke
up not feeling anything. Dazed, she
wandered around the French
House, where she lives. As she sat
down for breakfast, a friend joined
her.
"Your hair is getting longer.
When are you going to get another
haircut?" the fnend asked.
"That was exactly the trigger I
had been waiting for," Ho said. She
silently gestured for her friend to
go upstairs to her room with her.
Ho proceeded to hack off her
hair in big chunks as her friend
watched in horror, not knowing
what to do. Fortunately, the haircut
turned out ok.
Like a growing number of Stan
ford students, Ho has chronic de
pression.
Over the past decade, emotional
health problems among students
have increased significantly, said
Alejandro Martinez, director of the
Vaden Student Health Center's
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices. Furthermore, there is a
"change in the intensity about how
people feel about these problems,"
Martinez added.
These observations mirror the

results of a study released in Febru
ary indicating that more college stu
dents have emotional health prob
lems, and their problems are more
severe and complex than those di
agnosed among students in the
past.
Over the past 13 years, the num
ber of college students getting
counseling for depression doubled,
the number of students feeling sui
cidal tripled, and the number of
those visiting a counselor due to a
sexual assault quadrupled, accord
ing to the study conducted at the
counseling center at Kansas State
University,
More students also had "typical
or expected college problems" like
family and relationship trouble —
which increased by roughly 27 and
17 percent, respectively. More stu
dents had learning disabilities like
Attention Deficit Disorder, while
the number of students seeking
help for some serious problems like
substance abuse and eating disor
ders increased only marginally, by
about 4 percent and 5 percent, re
spectively.
The study was based on forms
filled out by therapists for more
than 13,000 students who visited
the Kansas center between 1989
and 2001.
Martinez said the results partly
reflect a broader acceptance among
today's students of therapy as a so

lution for emotional disorders. In
all, about 10 percent of Stanford
students visit CAPS, he said.
Still, he estimates, roughly a
third of the students on campus
with emotional health problems are
not currently seeking help
The Bridge, a peer counseling
group on campus, gets about one
or two calls per day, many of which
are about breakups or other rela
tionship problems, said junior
Jenny Prevost, a counselor at the
center.
"They can be very serious," Pre
vost said. "If after a breakup there's
a huge loss and if the person has
been at risk, they will likely develop
depression. Breakups can lead to
feelings of worthlessness, hurting
themselves or others."
Other common problems deal
with students questioning their sex
ual orientation or dealing with de
pression, anxiety and academic
stress, she said.
"The academic pressure is par
ticular to Stanford," Prevost said.
"They talk to us because they don't
want to talk to friends about it and
show that they don't have every
thing together."
Ho said that college can be par
ticularly stressful because there is
more time to think about work, in
stead of actually do it.
"For example, it'll be Saturday
night and we'll think to ourselves,

'We really should be studying in
stead of partying,' " she said. "So,
despite claims that Stanford is real
ly laid-back, I feel that the guilt and
the pressure here is just as intense
because it is very easy to let school
work rule your life mentally."
Ho said that she has found
keeping a journal and other
recreational activities to be espe
cially therapeutic.
"Sometimes if you write down
that you want to do horrible things
to yourself it makes the urge less in
tense," she said.
She also recommends exercise
or some other "repetitive, low-level
task, either mental or physical."
"I like to crochet, which is nice
because you can just kind of turn off
your brain fora while and let the
yarn take shape, and I hear that
running is pretty good, too," she
said. "At the end of the activity, it's
like your mind or your body has
been cleaned out a little, and you
have something to show for it —
the scarf you crocheted or the mile
you ran."
Her final recommendation:
humor.
"I joke about it — Oh, I'm just
being 'crazy Lillian!'" she said.
"That's the great thing about come
dy — when it hurts so much, all you
can do is laugh, and that is our great
freedom as human beings. We can
laugh at our tragedies."
