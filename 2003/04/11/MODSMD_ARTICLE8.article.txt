# GSB contributes to online MBA program

### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
A few blocks from the Foothills, just east of
Stanford Avenue, lives a university
president — but his students are thousands of
miles away. Geoff Cox, a former Stanford ad
ministrator, is president of Cardean Universi
ty, an accredited M.B.A. program with about
500 matriculated students.
Unlike many university presidents, Cox
teaches a small seminar and frequently works
from home. But then again, so do many of his
students. In his seminar on business ethics,
•.Cox supervises 11 students from six different
countries. The students are taking part in a
unique business school program with courses
designed by faculty from Stanford, the Uni
versity of Chicago and Columbia Business
School, among others. Five faculty members
from the Graduate School of Business helped
'create some of the few dozen courses that
Cardean offers each term.
"Higher education is probably the single
-* most important determination of quality of fiv-
Cox said. "It turns out the Internet is a
very powerful medium for education."
Z Cardean, part of UNext.com, was founded
~in 1999 — near the peak of the Internet bub
ble — to take advantage of Internet technolo
gy in distance-learning environments. Profes
sors and university administrators were key

backers of the program, and the founders
were able to enlist the support of Stanford and
the other schools. The chairman of the board,
Andrew Rosenfield, was on the faculty at the
University of Chicago's law school for 18 years.
Most of the administrators hold doctorates,
and Cox holds a doctorate in philosophy.
Cardean's vision was ambitious. The acade
mics who founded Cardean wanted to do
more than broadcast lectures over the Inter
net, so they came up with a model of interac
tive courses focusing on specific tasks that busi
nesses actually have to accomplish.
In one course, students have to improve the
image of a fictional hotel chain through a pro
motional campaign. The course consists of a
series of tasks that take a few hours to com
plete. Students get realistic memos, short ani
mation clips and lecture blurbs, but there is no
consistent reading or hour-long lecture. Click
on a term, and a definition pops up. Tools
allow students to experiment with spread
sheets and graphs, changing the numbers in a
way that is impossible in a textbook.
"There's a huge amount of personal atten
tion," Cox said. "We can sort of coach them
along the way."
Ward Hansen, a lecturer at the Business
School, helped design an Internet marketing
course for Cardean. He sees interactive Inter
net courses as an important trend.
"The distance between online courses and

textbooks will blur," he said. "The concepts are
useful in many classes, not just business classes,
where hands-on data analysis is powerful."
Hansen oversaw the design of the course,
and Cardean faculty handle the teaching. He
viewed the course as a powerful tool to help
him improve his own teaching of concepts,
and he uses some of the online units he devel
oped for Cardean in Business School courses.
"From Stanford's point of view, it's been
beneficial," Hansen said.
However, Cardean's designers say that the
program — though designed by well-known
faculty including several Nobel Prize
winners — is nothing like a real bricks-and
mortar experience.
"We don't think that studying online is bet
ter than a residential program," Cox said.
"That said, lots of people can't take the time to
go to a normal school. . .The number one fac
tor is convenience; they can [use our program]
on their own time and at their own pace."
Cox wants to expand the online program
beyond a simple M.B.A. program and existing
professional development courses. He sees an
undergraduate degree program as a next step.
"Stanford is not the right comparison fora
degree program," he said. "About 50 percent
of people who start undergraduate degree
programs don't finish. We want to serve a part
of the population that's not well served by tra
ditional colleges and universities."
