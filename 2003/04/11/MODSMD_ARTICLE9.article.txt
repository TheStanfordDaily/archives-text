Cheryl Walker, associate pro
fessor of obstetrics and gynecol
ogy, was cleared of conspiracy,
elder abuse and embezzlement
charges on Tuesday by the Santa
Clara County prosecutor as her
mother pleaded no contest to
elder abuse and embezzlement.
Walker was suspected of giv
ing painkillers to Mary Lee
Koleber, her 95-year-old grand
mother, ultimately causing her
death in 2001. She was also ac

cused of embezzling her
$500,000 estate.
According to the San Francis
co Chronicle, Walker's brother
conceded when testifying in
court that he had forged Kole
ber's signature on documents,
which resulted in a significant
turn in the case against her.
Meanwhile, Koleber's daugh
ter Janice Walker entered a no
contest plea on Tuesday. The
Chronicle reported that Janice
Walker's deal with prosecutors
will likely result in a two-year jail
sentence instate prison.
