Roadtrip Nation: A Guide to Discovering Your Path in Life
by Nathan Gebhard, Mike Marriner, Joanne Gordon
After college Mike Marriner and Nathan Gebhard had no idea what to do with their lives. All they'd been exposed to were standard career paths like doctor and consultant-roads that didn't fit them at all. To see what
else was out there they took a road trip across the nation in a huge forty-foot RV to meet with people who had successfully defined their own paths in life-including the chairman of Starbucks; a lobsterman from Maine;
the director of Saturday Night Live; the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic; the first female Supreme Court Justice of the United States; head stylist for Madonna; and the CEO of National Geographic Ventures. All told,
one hundred and forty people candidly shared their stories about how they got from college to the present. Now in Roadtrip Nation, Mike and Nathan share the most compelling tales with you.

The New Financial Order: Risk in the Twenty-First Century by Robert J. Shiller
Shiller describes six fundamental ideas for using modern information technology and advanced financial theory to temper basic risks that have been ignored by risk management institutions-risks to the value of our jobs
and our homes, to the vitality of our communities, and to the very stability of national economies. Informed by a comprehensive risk information database, this new financial order would include global markets for trad
ing risks and exploiting myriad new financial opportunities, from inequality insurance to intergenerational social security. Just as developments in insuring risks to life, health, and catastrophe have given us a quality of
life unimaginable a century ago, so Shiller's plan for securing crucial assets promises to substantially enrich our condition.

Watching Sex: How Men Really Respond to Pornography by David Loftus
In his quest to debunk the widely held assumption that pornography warps its users' views of sexuality, journalist Loftus interviewed nearly 150 men about their relationships with pornographic materials. The men are
forthcoming and reflective as they recount their first exposures to erotic materials and analyze how pornography has affected their lives, revealing emotional responses ranging from pleasure to indifference and disgust.
