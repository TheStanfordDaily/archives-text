Students in any major are welcome.
The Honors Certification in Latin American Studies is a terrific
complement to any conventional major and is of particular inter
est for students who plan further disciplinary study or a career
with an international or Latin American focus. Students are
required to conduct a senior research project and corresponding
thesis with the guidance of a faculty advisor. Proficiency in Spanish
or Portuguese is also mandatory. Juniors are expected to enroll
this quarter in LAS 165 C or a suitable pre-field equivalent.
Apply now!
Applications are available on our website at:
