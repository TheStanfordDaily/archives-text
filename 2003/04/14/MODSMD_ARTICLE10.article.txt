## Soldiers saved from Iraqi jail 
### 
(AP) — Their long weeks of waiting over,
their prayers finally answered, families of seven
captured U.S. soldiers laughed and cried with
unbridled joy yesterday as they celebrated word
that their loved ones had been released in Iraq.
"Greatest day of my life," Ronald Young Sr.
beamed as he and his wife, Kaye, watched a
choppy (INN video of their son, helicopter pilot
Ronald Jr., running to an aircraft that whisked
the rescued prisoners of war out of danger after
22 days in captivity.
"I'm just so happy that I could kiss the
world!" added the elder Young. "When I saw
him, it was like somebody had won the World
Series. Everybody was jumping around and
hollering."
Kaye Young laughed with glee at images of
her grinning, 26-year-old son as neighbors de
livered food and flowers to their home in Lithia
Springs, Ga. An American flag hung on the
front door and yellow ribbons were tied to trees
outside.
"Ron has this smile that was ear-to-ear, we
could just see it," said his mother. "He looks
thin. But he looks good. I always thought he
would come home."
At other homes of POW families, friends and
relatives also crowded in, shook hands and
hugged one another. Outside, others waved
American flags and blasted car horns.
"I feel that my heart wants to burst out of my
chest," Maria De La Luz Hernandez said in
Spanish after learning her son, Edgar, was free.
"I'm going to have a heart attack here with so
much happiness."
Drivers who passed the family bungalow in
southern Texas responded to a sign that said
"Honk for Edgar" by beeping their horns or
stopping to join the party.
In Port Hood, Texas, the family of the sec
ond rescued helicopter pilot, 30-year-old David

S. Williams, was smiling as well.
"I've always remained positive," said his fa
ther, David Williams Sr., who was with his son's
wife, Michelle, and their two children. "When
you believe in God as I do and my son does, you
know he will come back home safely."
The Pentagon confirmed yesterday that the
seven soldiers — six men and one woman —
were all those formally listed as POWs, includ
ing five from the Army's 507 th Maintenance
Company and the two downed Apache heli
copter pilots.
The pilots, both chief warrant officers, were
forced down during heavy fighting in Iraq.
The captured members of the 507 th were
specialist Hernandez, 21, of Mission, Texas;
Spc. Joseph Hudson, 23, of Alamogordo, N.M.;
Spc. Shoshana Johnson, 30, of Fort Bliss,

Texas; Pfc. Patrick Miller, 23, of Park City,
Kan., and Sgt. James Riley, 31, of Pennsauken,
N.J.
They were attacked after making a wrong
turn March 23 near Nasiriyah, a major crossing
point on the Euphrates River northwest of Basra.
Jessica Lynch, rescued from an Iraqi hospi
tal earlier this month, had also been with the
convoy. Her family issued a statement saying
the release answered the prayers of millions of
people around the world.
Iraqi troops released the POWs to Marines
near Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit.
The seven were taken to a military airport in
Kuwait, where all were released after medical
examinations. Marines who flew them to safety
said two had gunshot wounds: Johnson, in an
ankle, and Hernandez, in an elbow.
