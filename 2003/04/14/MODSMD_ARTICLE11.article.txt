# World trade may decrease poverty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Global poverty can be cut in half
by 2015 if rich countries lower
trade barriers and increase for
eign aid, the World Bank said
yesterday.
Poor countries can help them
selves by investing more in health
and education, the bank said.
But a new bank report said
even if worldwide economic
growth stays on track, poverty
will remain severe in Africa,
where the number of poor is
likely to climb from 315 million
in 1999 to 404 million in 2015.
Poverty also is on the rise in the
Middle East, the bank said.
"Growth alone will not be
enough to halve poverty by
2015," said Nicholas Stern, the
bank's chief economist.
"Developing countries need
to ensure that all people, and es
pecially poor people, have access
to education, health care and
put in place the right investment
climate to create opportunities,
spur productivity and make real
improvements in peoples lives."
In a sign wealthy nations were
offering more aid, Treasury Sec
retary John Snow said the United
States would give the bank $100
million in the budget year start
ing Oct. 1 for low-interest, long
term loans to poor countries.
Snow, who made the an
nouncement at the spring meet

ings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund,
said the United States might
provide an additional $200 mil
lion in 2005 if developing coun
tries show progress in education,
health and private sector devel
opment.
Stern said the bank hoped
"rich countries will follow
through on their aid commit
ments and will take action on
trade," particularly on agricul
ture subsidies at the World
Trade Organization meeting in
Mexico in September.
Developing countries main
tain that the $300 billion a year
that wealthy nations pay their
farmers in subsidies drives down
the price of commodities pro
duced by poor nations. That
makes it hard for them to sell
goods at a profit and improve
their economies.
The bank report outlines the
sharp differences between life in
poor and rich countries.
It shows that during the 1990s
there was rapid progress in re
ducing the number of poor peo
ple who live on less the $ 1 a day,
the bank's definition of poverty.
The report said the numbers
dropped from 1.3 billion in 1990
to 1.16 billion in 1999 but these
gains occurred in India and
China, whose economies made
progress during the decade.
