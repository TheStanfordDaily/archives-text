## The
						Stanford Daily Law clinic builds local ties 
### 
Editorial

Developing and maintaining a
strong, ongoing relationship
between the University and the
community always has been
one of Stanford's main priorities. The
University even hosts Community Day, an
annual open house, to highlight and cele
brate its partnerships and ties with the
community. And two weeks ago, Stanford
proved again its commitment to working
with the surrounding community.
The University, through the Stanford
Law School, has worked with local lawyers
and law firms to establish the Stanford
Community Law Clinic, which opened in
February and hosted its open house on
April 2. The clinic will provide pro bono
legal counseling to those in need of such
services and train law students in public
interest law.
When the East Palo Alto Community
Law Clinic closed last May due to budget

problems, residents
in East Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and
Redwood City who
needed quality legal
counseling had
nowhere to go. The
Stanford law clinic
will now help fill
that void.
Under the super
vision of three
lawyers — including
Peter Reid, former
head of the local

legal aid society — Stanford Law School
students will handle cases from start to fin
ish. Recently, the students filed a case fora
couple who is seeking thousands of dollars
in unpaid wages and fines; the students
may even be able to take the case to court.
The Stanford law clinic is a perfect ex
ample of how a common goal was identi
fied and realized by members of a com
munity, for the benefit of all parties — in
this case the law students, Stanford and
local residents — involved.
Law clinics like this one offer law stu
dents valuable hands-on experience —
they put into practice what they learn in
the classrooms — while helping those
truly in need of legal assistance. For the
University, this kind of training allows its
students to become the future's leading
public interest lawyers. According to the
San Jose Mercury News, this clinic is "part
of an ambitious plan to make Stanford's
clinical program the best in the nation
[and is] one of several that Stanford has
recently launched."

In taking the initiative to establish
the Stanford Community Law
Clinic, the University is sending a
visible message that public service
is a necessary and valuable
component of our society.

But while the University and law stu
dents benefit from this clinic, the greatest
beneficiaries are members of the sur
rounding neighborhoods who will be able
to receive legal advice on housing, work
ers' lights and government benefits. In
meeting the direct and immediate needs
of these areas, Stanford has proved itself
as a responsible and responsive member
of the community.
Moreover, in taking the initiative to es
tablish this law clinic, the University is
sending a visible message to members of
the Stanford community — one to which
students in particular should pay attention
— that public service is a necessary and
valuable component of our society. Stu
dents at leading institutions like Stanford
are often labeled as the leaders of tomor
row, and that is true. Within Stanford's
student body, there are future CEOs and
Nobel Laureates. But there must also be

public servants who
will serve their com
munities.
Training the next
cohort of such lead
ers is a part of what
the Stanford law clin
ic is trying to do. In
her speech at the
clinic's open house,
Stanford Law School
Dean Kathleen M.
Sullivan said that stu
dents will get a
chance to help peo-

pie that really need them and get a sense of
"ethical responsibility" from working at the
clinic. Reicl, who is the center's director,
said that his goal is to inspire students to
practice community law, instead of more
lucrative careers in other aspects of law.
That isn't to say that there aren't re
wards in community law. In place of big
salaries or fame, lawyers that serve com
munities instead of corporations have the
knowledge that they have helped those
who otherwise couldn't afford and
wouldn't have received legal assistance.
When both undergraduate and gradu
ate students, leave Stanford with their
diplomas in hand, there is no question
that they will be well-prepared to face the
challenges and demands of the real world
outside the Stanford bubble. That is what
a Stanford education is all about. The
question left is, what will you do with that
education? Serving the community is an
obligation and privilege, and we hope ev
eryone at Stanford will continue to do so
in creative and helpful ways.
