# LET'S GIVE'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
## Heard it through the grapevine 
### 
In this turbulent time of polit
ical change, all members of
our community must ask
themselves what are the
strengths and weaknesses of our
governing institution. Now that
Nadiya Figueroa has ascended to
the pre-eminent post of ASSU
president, we hope that she will
address one of the most pressing
concerns of the Stanford under
graduate student body: freedom
of information.
Clearly, providing students
with equal access to information
has been a priority for previous
regimes. Past leaders have sup
ported the ISIS project and vari
ous proposals fora centralized
schedule for art events on campus.
We hope Figueroa will do the
same.
In her first hundred days in of
fice, we would like our new com
mandant to propose an RA An
nounce List Reform Act, which
would bring gossip, the most inter
esting of all categories of informa
tion, to students' fingertips.
Adding a gossip section to this
list, as well as running gossip up
dates on the work-in-progress ISIS
screens all over campus, would
greatly enhance the quality of life at
Stanford. We all like gossip and the
proposed reform has the capacity
to enable this treasured pastime.
Let's examine the reasons for
greater interconnectedness.
Our student body is relatively
small compared to that of many
other universities, so it is not very
surprising that certain people on
campus have gained notoriety
among the masses. However, why
should we bestow this honor on a
select group of individuals? We
firmly believe that everyone de
serves his or her 15 minutes of
fame. But there would have to be a
more centralized network for peo
ple to spread gossip in order to re
alize the dreams of the lonely math

major, who wishes to broadcast his
contempt for the girl across the
hall, who wronged him by peeing
on his chair while he was out look
ing fora frat party.
Speaking of fraternities, one ot
the oldest forms of gossip can be
found at Greek organizations,
right here at Stanford. Yes, boys

do gossip, regardless of fact that
they do not go to the bathroom in
packs. The infamous "black book"
that certain fraternities use to keep
accurate records of noteworthy li
aisons is evidence of the important
impact this type of information has
across generations.
There are more ephemeral
forms of communication that
occur in other residences as well.
Students have gone so far as to
make elaborate charts that map
inter-dorm fluid exchange to the
delight and merriment of their fel
low residents. Who knows, maybe
there is only a six-degree separa
tion between you and the editor in
chief of The Daily. Why wouldn't
you, and the rest of the student
body, want to know about it?
Here in the heart of the Silicon
Valley, such old-fashioned mea
sures of communication are sim
ply inadequate to handle the de
mand of our inquiring minds. The
technological revolution has
added an array of new weapons to
add to our gossiping arsenal.
Clearly, e-mail has facilitated
this process of mechanization,
adding speed and increasing ac
cessibility to this art form of com
munication.

So not only tan you send an e
mail to a long list of people and
quickly apprise them of the fact
that your housemate's father is be
coming his mother, but you can
also bcc all of your friends when
you e-mail that "knock-out" who
left her strap-on in the suitcase you
used in San Diego. You can even
forward that e-mail from that
sketchy graduate student who
wants to "tutor" you. People have
quickly adapted these conventions
into their daily gossip rituals.
We propose that students re
port their juicy tidbits to a central
collection agency that will amass
the day's offerings and package
them neatly for widespread con
sumption. Did you notice your
buddy's away message at 11:37
a.m. yesterday? You know, the one
that said, "out @ a frat party ?"
Want to tell everyone you know
(and some you don't) to be on the
lookout for her on the walk of
shame? Nothing makes better gos
sip than the prospect of spotting a
scantily clad young co-ed travers
ing campus, clearly having not yet
recovered from last night's soiree.
This service will allow for an
equal playing field for gossiper
and gossipee. Are you sick of hear
ing about that CS major who
claims you are his 24/7 booty call?
Wouldn't it be great if you could let
EVERYONE know "not in this
lifetime?"
Now some of you may have con
cerns about privacy and discre
tion, but here at Stanford, the
ASSU does not cater to the majori
ty. No, they prefer to support the
vocal minority, in this case, stu
dents with insatiable curiosity.
Therefore, you should all prepare
for the coming gossip revolution.
Yes, it will be televised.

world? We can help! eym@stanford.edu

greater interconnectedness.
Our student body is relatively
small compared to that of many
other universities, so it is not very
surprising that certain people on
campus have gained notoriety
among the masses. However, why
should we bestow this honor on a
select group of individuals? We
firmly believe that everyone de
serves his or her 15 minutes of
fame. But there would have to be a
more centralized network for peo
ple to spread gossip in order to re
alize the dreams of the lonely math

major, who wishes to broadcast his
contempt for the girl across the
hall, who wronged him by peeing
on his chair while he was out look
ing fora frat party.
Speaking of fraternities, one ot
the oldest forms of gossip can be
found at Greek organizations,
right here at Stanford. Yes, boys

do gossip, regardless of fact that
they do not go to the bathroom in
packs. The infamous "black book"
that certain fraternities use to keep
accurate records of noteworthy li
aisons is evidence of the important
impact this type of information has
across generations.
There are more ephemeral
forms of communication that
occur in other residences as well.
Students have gone so far as to
make elaborate charts that map
inter-dorm fluid exchange to the
delight and merriment of their fel
low residents. Who knows, maybe
there is only a six-degree separa
tion between you and the editor in
chief of The Daily. Why wouldn't
you, and the rest of the student
body, want to know about it?
Here in the heart of the Silicon
Valley, such old-fashioned mea
sures of communication are sim
ply inadequate to handle the de
mand of our inquiring minds. The
technological revolution has
added an array of new weapons to
add to our gossiping arsenal.
Clearly, e-mail has facilitated
this process of mechanization,
adding speed and increasing ac
cessibility to this art form of com
munication.

So not only tan you send an e
mail to a long list of people and
quickly apprise them of the fact
that your housemate's father is be
coming his mother, but you can
also bcc all of your friends when
you e-mail that "knock-out" who
left her strap-on in the suitcase you
used in San Diego. You can even
forward that e-mail from that
sketchy graduate student who
wants to "tutor" you. People have
quickly adapted these conventions
into their daily gossip rituals.
We propose that students re
port their juicy tidbits to a central
collection agency that will amass
the day's offerings and package
them neatly for widespread con
sumption. Did you notice your
buddy's away message at 11:37
a.m. yesterday? You know, the one
that said, "out @ a frat party ?"
Want to tell everyone you know
(and some you don't) to be on the
lookout for her on the walk of
shame? Nothing makes better gos
sip than the prospect of spotting a
scantily clad young co-ed travers
ing campus, clearly having not yet
recovered from last night's soiree.
This service will allow for an
equal playing field for gossiper
and gossipee. Are you sick of hear
ing about that CS major who
claims you are his 24/7 booty call?
Wouldn't it be great if you could let
EVERYONE know "not in this
lifetime?"
Now some of you may have con
cerns about privacy and discre
tion, but here at Stanford, the
ASSU does not cater to the majori
ty. No, they prefer to support the
vocal minority, in this case, stu
dents with insatiable curiosity.
Therefore, you should all prepare
for the coming gossip revolution.
Yes, it will be televised.

world? We can help! eym@stanford.edu
