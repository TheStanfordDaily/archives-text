## A
						delivery for George W. Bush: a 'My First Empire' kit 
### JOHN BROICH ANNE URSE GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Dear George W. Bush :
Greetings from your friends at I'lay-
Corp. Congratulations! You have been
given a "My First Empire," all-in-one
starter kit as an early birthday present
from Condi, Rummy and Dick. Your kit
will arrive in a few days. By remembering
just a few tips and hints, you can have years
of exciting playtime with your "My First
Empire" and, of course, reap the precious
resources of your new dominion.
Don't forget to browse our exciting col
lection of modules and expansion kits.
You must expand in order to maintain
your "My First Empire." Border conflicts
require stifling; internecine squabbles
among subject peoples need added polic
ing and regional threats demand addi
tional defensive alienations. Plus, expan
sion is fun! With PlayCorp, the world is

your oyster, so be prepared to watch your
"My First Empire" grow!
Tips for play:
Your "My First Empire" comes com
plete with eccentric subjects. Your new
subjects will have strange customs, hea
then superstitions, visions of self-rule and
will need to be pacified / subdued. (See
Section 6 of your "My First Empire" man
ual: "Martial Law.") One of your first tasks
will be to decide whether or not to grant
your subject people rights as citizens of
your empire or just exploit them for your
own personal gain. (See Section 12:
"Coolies.")
Since you have purchased the challeng
ing "Democracy Home Nation Edition,"
you will also have to more or less convince
your own people of the need for colonies.
We recommend the purchase of the
"Democracy Edition Player's Guide, Jin
goism for Dummies," which includes

plain-English sections like, "It's the Evil
doers, Stupid."
Remember, never turn your back on
your new Empire! Those eccentric sub
jects can wriggle through your "My First
Empire" borders and wreak havoc in un
expected areas. This has been a particular
problem for "My First Empire" kits featur
ing subjects with especially odd religions.
Past users have often had to purchase the
"Police State" module â€” also useful for
quashing dissent at home.
Cautions:
All Empires have an expiration date.
Expired empires can prove difficult to dis
card. Disentanglement often requires the
"My Post-Colonial Ethnic War" module,
now available from Play Corp.
Your "My First Empire" will require
capital. New Empires never pay for them
selves, not to mention the cost of all the
manuals, modules and expansion kits you

will find you need to maintain your "My
First Empire." PlayCorp assumes no re
sponsibility if you have to raise taxes at
home. PlayCorp assumes no liability if you
have already spent your home nation's
budget surplus. PlayCorp is not liable for
any regional destabilization, local uprising
or post-colonial fallout that might result
from your Empire. Possible side-effects in
clude megalomania and illusions of a na
tional mandate.
Final words:
We hope your new "My First Empire"
serves to amaze all of your friends and
neighbors. Be forewarned, though, that
the people around you may not under
stand your devotion to your new toy.
Sometimes, due to the occasional by-prod
ucts of "Martial or the "My Post-
Colonial Ethnic War" add-on, a "My First
Empire" user can find himself playing
alone. But who needs friends when you

have the biggest Empire on the block?
Again, congratulations on acquiring
your "My First Empire" all-in-one kit. And
remember, by attaining this starter kit,
your fun has only begun!
