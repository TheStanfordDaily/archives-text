## Desert can't take Stanford heat 
### MIKE SCOTTO EDITORIAL STAFF 
The road once again proved
friendly to the Stanford women's
tennis team this weekend, as it
swept a pair of matches in Arizona
in its usual dominating fashion.
Arizona (8-11, 2-5 Pacific-10
Conference) proved no contest for
the Cardinal (17-1, 5-0 Pacific-10)
on Friday, as Stanford easily
claimed a 6-1 victory over the Wild
cats in Tucson. Stanford duplicated
that score Saturday in Tempe
against No. 16 Arizona State.
The two big hitters for Arizona,
Maja Mlakar and Emilie Scribot,
flipped positions in the lineup since
the Wildcats' last meeting with the
Cardinal, with the former No. 1
Mlakar taking on junior Lauren
Barnikow at the No. 2 singles posi
tion. No. 14 Barnikow dominated
the match from start to finish, how
ever, and posted a 6-3,6-0 win.
Scribot, who is now ranked No.

-10 in the nation, captured her
team's only point of the day with a
three-set victory, 4-6,6-2,6-3, at the
No. 1 singles spot over Cardinal
freshman Amber Liu.
Stanford swept the bottom half
of the singles convincingly, as fresh
man Alice Barnes at No. 4, junior
Emilia Anderson at No. 5 and
sophomore Story Tweedie-Yates at
No. 6 singles all notched straight
set victories.
Sophomore Erin Burdette final
ized the 6-1 win with a 7-6,4-6, 1-0
(10-8) victory over Dianne Hol
lands at No. 3 singles.
In doubles, the Cardinal over
came a rare loss by Anderson and
Tweedie-Yates at No. 3 doubles to
capture the point. The top doubles
team in the nation of Barnikow and
Burdette defeated Mlakar and Scri
bot, 8-6, while Liu and Barnes were

8-6 winners at No. 2 doubles.
Although the Wildcats do not
boast a winning record, they are a
hard-hitting, dangerous team, es
pecially at the top of their lineup.
Mlakar and Scribot are one of the
toughest singles duos in the Pac-1(),
and they led Arizona to an upset
over No. 4 California on Saturday,
making Stanford's dominance
seem even more impressive.

State (9-9, 2-5 Pac-10). This time,
Stanford had no hitches in its dou

matches and capturing the point.

charge with a 6-1, 6-1 win over
