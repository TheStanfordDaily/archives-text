# Bears get paddled twice
## 
### RACHAEL HANLEY STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday the Stanford light
weight rowers arrived at Redwood
Shores. They looked at the rain and the
wind buffeting their home course. "We
might as well win," the women decided.
And win they did.
The Cardinal claimed victory over
California by large margins in both the
novice and varsity lightweight races this
weekend. Stanford lightweights had
bested Cal last weekend at the San
Diego Crew Classic and had set an addi
tional goal of finishing the 2k course in
7 minutes, but were slowed by condi
tions. Stanford openweights had the
weekend off.
The varsity lightweights began their
race at 9:10 in the morning, under dark
skies. In spite of the continuous rain, the
weather actually improved for the race,
shifting from downpours and high
winds during warmups to a drizzle.
The Cardinal jumped off the line
right from the start, immediately surg
ing ahead of the competition. Stanford
walked on the Golden Bears in the first
high-rate strokes of the piece, taking
three seats in the first 10 strokes. By the
500-meter mark, a fourth of the way
down the course, the Cardinal had com
pletely overtaken the Cal boat and was
moving off the Bears' bow ball.
"We were basically always walking on
them from the start. I wouldn't say
there was much of a fight," said Marcela
Delgado, coxswain of the varsity light
weight boat.
Cady Kintner, five-seat of the varsity
boat, said the rowers were confident

throughout the race, especially after
they distanced themselves from Cal
with a 15-stroke push at the 500-meter
mark.
"I don't think we felt really threat
ened by them," Kintner said. "We've
raced them before, at San Diego. We
were pretty confident going into this
race."
With Stanford positioned significant
ly ahead of Cal, the women began to
shift focus from their competition to
their own power and technique. To
maintain the boat power, Delgado
called five-stroke sets for focus, leg
power and ratio.
"I have a boat-length of open water,"
she told the rowers. "I want a boat more
before the finish!"
Crossing through the bridge at the
halfway mark, as they moved out from
the shelter of riverside houses, both
teams also found themselves fighting off
a strong cross-headwind. In lane one,
the Cardinal fell off set fora moment as
the wind pushed the boat to starboard.
"We were at rate 34 [strokes per
minute] then in the last thousand, we
were 33 because of the wind," Delgado
said.
Stanford kept putting distance on
the other crew, ultimately extending
their lead to 15 seconds. Stanford fin
ished with a time of 7 minutes, 25 sec
onds; Cal had a time of 7:40.
The novice lightweight race was a
perfect copy of the varsity's, with the
Cardinal again jumping to an early and
insurmountable lead.
Opening the race with a show of
speed, the Stanford women began at a
stroke rate of between 36 and 38, a rate

that the Cal boat could not match.
"We were just outstroking them
from the beginning," novice coxswain
Kat Cooper said.
After just 500 meters, the Cardinal
had open water on their competition
and had settled into a strong 32.
"At that point, we weren't out
stroking them, our strokes were just
more powerful," Cooper said.
Cooper said the boat had expected to
beat Cal, but not by such a wide margin
or so quickly.
"We thought they would be with us
for longer," she said.
Although boat speed died slightly as
the Cardinal moved from the relative
shelter of land into the headwind, Stan

ford kept their focus, with Cooper re
minding the women that they may have
passed Cal, but were still racing them
selves and the clock.
The novice built to a sprint at a 34 to
finish off the race.
"Even though the rate was lower, I
felt that the strokes were more power
ful," Cooper said. "It was an effective
low rate."
The Cardinal finished several boat
lengths ahead of their competition with
a time of 7:40 — the same as the Cal var
sity boat — besting the Cal novices by 23
seconds.
The lightweights' next race the
Sacramento State Hornets, in Sacra
mento on April 26.

The Stanford lightweight crew team won both its races against rival California handi

after the starting gun went off, as the Cardinal surged ahead to find itself racing on
open water during each outing.

"We thought they would be with us
for longer," she said.
Although boat speed died slightly as
the Cardinal moved from the relative
shelter of land into the headwind, Stan

ford kept their focus, with Cooper re
minding the women that they may have

finish off the race.
"Even though the rate was lower, I
felt that the strokes were more power
ful," Cooper said. "It was an effective
low rate."
The Cardinal finished several boat
lengths ahead of their competition with
a time of 7:40 — the same as the Cal var
sity boat — besting the Cal novices by 23
seconds.
The lightweights' next race the
Sacramento State Hornets, in Sacra
