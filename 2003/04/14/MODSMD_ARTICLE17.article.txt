Women's Water Polo
Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 8, No. 5 Cal 2
Saturday: Stanford 9, No. 7 Hawaii 3

On Saturday, the Cardinal beat No. 5 Califor
nia (12-7,5-4) 8-2 on the road in The Big Splash.
Sunday afternoon at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, Stanford continued its weekend success with
a 9-3 victory over No. 7 Hawaii (10-12, 4-6).
Sophomore Hannah Luber put the Cardinal on
the board with 4:41 left in the first period. Her
twin sister, Kelty Luber, followed with her first
goal of the game. With 1:40 left in the first peri
od, senior Julie Gardner found the net, putting
Stanford up by three.
In the second quarter, with Stanford leading
4-0, Kelty Luber found the net again, this time
from six meters out, for her second goal of the
game. The Cardinal stilled the Hawaii offense
and led 5-0 at halftime.
"We did a great job guarding them one-on
one," coach John Tanner said. "Wendy Watkins
was fantastic guarding especially.
"We set a tone defensively and we didn't give
them any opportunities for their two big players
to hurt us. Also, because our team
defense was so good we didn't
have to play any five-on-six ... we
had no ejections."
Early in the third, Hawaii's
Kristy Bagnall put one up for the
Rainbow Wahine with a cross-cage
backhand goal. Junior Wendy
Watkins quickly responded to
maintain Stanford's lead by live
goals. Junior Brenda Villa
notched her first goal with less
than two minutes left, to end the
third period at 7-1.
In the final period, the Rain
bow Wahine managed to score
twice, but each effort was coun
tered with a Stanford goal. Fresh
man Erica Wilson made a wild
shot to score, and senior Nicole
Huszcz planted an outside shot to
cap the win.
The Stanford victory was a team
effort, with seven different players
scoring at least one goal. The Car
dinal's keeper, senior Jackie
Frank, was outstanding on defense
as she tallied nine saves.
Tanner was pleased with both
wins.
"We played really well on team
defense and that created a lot of
our counterattack opportunities,"
Tanner said.
Tanner also talked about the
team's game plan as they close out
their season.
He said, "We're in pretty good
shape right now. We need to win
against San Jose next week to get

the No . 1 seed for our conference
tournament because the winner
gets an automatic berth to the
NCAA tournament and that's what
we want to accomplish."
Villa was especially pleased with
tiie Cardinal's victory over Cal.

"At Cal we had a convincing
win, we executed our game plan
and I think we're coming along
just like we wanted," Villa said. "If
you consider that we have a fairly
young and inexperienced team,
we've had a pretty good season."
