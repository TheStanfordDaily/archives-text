the coach to the support staff to thejerseys
returns each season; in this year's version
of the Cardinal, John Hudgins quietly
keeps pitching and Ryan Garko and Car
los Quentin loudly keep hitting.
In a two-game homestand against
Sacramento State that saw rain conspire to
create a one-game weekend, No. 4 Stan
ford (23-10,7-2 Pacific 10 Conference) got
exactly what it expects every Friday night
in a 9-1 win over the Hornets (20-16).
Hudgins, now 6-2 with an even 3.00
ERA, turned in a scintillating perfor
mance at Sunken Diamond, pitching
eight scoreless, two-hit innings and fan
ning a career-high 11 batters. One week
after throwing a complete game at Wash
ington State, the junior retired 20 of the
final 22 Sacramento batters he faced on
Friday night and did not allow a hit over
his last six innings.
"I feel like I'm on top of things pretty
well right now," said Hudgins, who now

leads the Pac-10 in both strikeouts, with
78, and innings pitched, with 81.
The Cardinal ace seems to be growing
rather nicely into the Friday starter role,
occupied in recent years by top prospects
Jason Young, Justin Wayne and Jeremy
Guthrie. Against the Hornets, Hudgins
allowed just two runners to reach second
base in his eight innings of work.
"John Hudgins pitched one of his best
games of the year in a phenomenal effort
and was dominating for us tonight," said
coach Mark Marquess. "We played well
with his pitching performance in putting
nine runs on the board to support him."
The nine runs came on a 13-hit night
for the Cardinal, which has now put up
double-digit hits on the scoreboard in 16
of its last 17 matchups to raise the team av
erage to .325.
Garko extended his hitting streak to 10
games with three hits and two RBIs on
Friday. The senior backstop is now bat
ting .585 with five homers and 21 RBIs
during the stretch.
Quentin used a fifth-inning single to
push his hit streak to a career-high 21
games. During those outings, Quentin
has hit .488 to pump his season average to
.421 after 33 games. In the season's final
two months, Quentin will bid to become
the first Stanford player to finish the sea
son above .400 since Major Leaguer
David McCarty hit .420 for the Cardinal
in 1991.
Stanford used just one homer — a solo

shot from sophomore Danny Putnam —
in its eight-run victory, which also saw se
nior Tobin Swope, juniors Sam Fuld and
Brian Hall and Putnam collecting multi
ple-hit games.
The Cardinal scored once in the first,
playing station-to-station baseball after
Fuld drew a one-out walk. He stole sec
ond, moved to third on Hall's sacrifice
bunt and scored on Garko's RBI single to
take the 1-0 lead with perfect fundamen
tal baseball.
In the fourth, Putnam's sixth homer of
the season led off a three-run frame for
Stanford. The Cardinal used the same
formula as in the first — walk, steal, sacri
fice bunt — to move freshman Jed Lowrie
to third and scored him on an RBI
groundout. With two outs, sophomore
Chris Carter walked and scored after sin
gles from Fuld and Hall to make it 4-0.
Next, Stanford added two runs in the
fifth and, in the sixth, used three Sacra
mento wild pitches, a hit batsman and an
error to put up three more, rounding out
the home side's scoring for the night.
With Hudgins remaining on the
bench after the eighth, the Hornets man
aged to spoil the shutout after freshman
reliever Kodiak Quick issued back-to
back walks to begin the ninth. The Hor
nets' Bobby Ciani's RBI single came with
two outs, providing one disappointing
moment of suspense in a game whose out
come was almost never in doubt due to
Hudgins' dominance on the mound.

formula as in the first — walk, steal, sacri
fice bunt — to move freshman Jed Lowrie
to third and scored him on an RBI
groundout. With two outs, sophomore
Chris Carter walked and scored after sin
gles from Fuld and Hall to make it 4-0.
Next, Stanford added two runs in the
fifth and, in the sixth, used three Sacra
mento wild pitches, a hit batsman and an
error to put up three more, rounding out
the home side's scoring for the night.
With Hudgins remaining on the
bench after the eighth, the Hornets man
aged to spoil the shutout after freshman
reliever Kodiak Quick issued back-to
back walks to begin the ninth. The Hor
nets' Bobby Ciani's RBI single came with
two outs, providing one disappointing
moment of suspense in a game whose out
come was almost never in doubt due to
Hudgins' dominance on the mound.
