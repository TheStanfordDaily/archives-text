### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend the No. 7 Stan
ford (18-3, 5-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) men's tennis team rolled
over the .Arizona schools at the
Taube Family Tennis Center to
maintain a perfect conference
record.
The Cardinal blanked Arizona
State (8-10, 3-2) on Friday and de
molished Arizona (8-10, 2-4) on
Sunday in a duel rescheduled due
to Saturday's storm. Stanford
routed the Wildcats 6-1, winning
all six singles matches in straight
sets.
Alt hough the match against Ari
zona State ended in a 7-0 score, it
could have easily been much clos
er as the Cardinal's top four singles
players were all pushed to three
sets.
"You've got to give Arizona
State a lot of credit," associate head
coach John YVhitlinger said. "They
were missing two starters includ
ing Chris Stewart, who is one of
their top guys. We come out and
win the doubles point, then blast
them in the first sets of the singles
matches. But they battled back and
made it a tough match."
Stanford easily won all three
doubles matchups to pick up the
first point of the outing.
Senior Ail-Americans David
Martin and Scott Lipsky — cur
rently No. 2 in the nation — took
out No. 24 Olivier Charroin and
Chris Stewart 8-6 on court one.
Freshmen KC Corkery and
James Pade were never challenged
in an 8-2 victory on court two.
Sophomore Sam Warburg and ju
nior Carter Morris posted a com
fortable 8-3 win on court three.
"I was really proud of Carter in
doubles," Whitlinger said. "He

served two games and went nine
for-nine first serves. .And he was
hitting it, not just spinning it in."
In singles, Stanford looked as
though it would continue its dom
inance as it won the first set in all
six matches. But the Sun Devils
rallied back, winning the second
sets on courts one through four.
No. 12 Martin edged Pim Van
Mele in a tie-breaker to win the
first set 7-6. Van Mele came back to
win the second set 6-2 before Mar
tin took control in a 6-0 third set.
"In the second set 1 didn't have
much energy," Martin said. "I was
letting him dictate the points and I
was being sloppy. Once the third
set started, every other match fin

ished so everyone came to watch
my match.
"The crowd energized me and I
played the third set more aggres
sively."
On court two, Lipsky beat Chris
Letcher 7-5, 4-6, (3-3. Warburg, in
his singles debut at Taube, defeat
ed Olivier Charroin on court three
6-2, 3-6, 6-1. It was the third time
in his career that he's beaten Char
roin.
"Olivier is an erratic player,"
Warburg said. "He'll hit some un
believable shots and then some sit
ters which allow his opponents to
attack him. 1 match up well with

him because he likes to hit his left
handed forehand cross-court,
which plays right into my favorite
shot: My two-handed backhand."
On court four, Pade prevailed
over ASU's Ryan Mcßride.
"James was having one of those

days where he was battling him
self," Whitlinger said. "Good for
him to regroup and come back to
win. Again, I have to give Mcßride
credit for battling back and mak
ing it a struggle."
Sheng quickly dismissed
Jonathan Stott 6-3, 6-3 on court
five.
"He was a scrappy player,"
Sheng said. "Once he got behind,
he started drop-shotting me like

crazy. But he wasn't disguising it
that well, so it didn't really bother
me."
Morris picked apart Ryan Evel
off in a 6-2,6-1 victory on court six.
"I'm usually a slow starter,"
Morris said. "Today it was no dif
ferent. We were at 2-2 when every
other match had finished the first
set. But once I started serving well,
that was the key. The crowd really
inspired me."
