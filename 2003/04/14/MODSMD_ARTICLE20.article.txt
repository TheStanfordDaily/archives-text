# Men rally to earn two road wins
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just two weeks ago, the No. 10 Stanford men's vol
leyball team (17-11, 14-8 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) was tied for seventh place in-conference,
unsure if it would even move on to postseason play, as
only the top eight teams advance to the MPSF Tour
nament.
The Cardinal was looking to finish the season with
a flurry of victories and Stanford has been able to do
just that, ending the regular season riding five-match
win streak.
Not only did the streak put the Cardinal in the
playoffs, but with its two wins over the past weekend,
Stanford clinched a quarterfinal match at home.
"That's the main thing [about this weekend's wins],"
coach Don Shaw said. "It's great that we don't have to
travel, but we'd like to have a good crowd. We'd really
like to have a big crowd out there behind us."
Stanford capped ofl its climb up the standings with
sweeps over No. 11 UCLA (15-14, 10-12 MPSF) and
No. 6 UC-Irvine (19-10,12-10 MPSF) — the Cardinal
will take on the Anteaters again next Saturday to
begin the conference tournament.
Stanford pulled out Friday's win over the Bruins
with superior team defense.
"Against UCLA, we weren't outstanding offensive
ly," Shaw said. "This was as good a weekend defen
sively as we have had all year, though."
Stanford out-blocked the Bruins 13-10.5 and held
a 10-dig advantage, as redshirt sophomore setter
Kevin Hansen and sophomore libero David Vogel
led the Cardinal in digs with 11 and 10, respectively.
Even though Stanford did not come up with its
best offensive performance, senior outside hitter Billy
Strickland was predictably solid individually, coming
up with 11 kills on a .429 hitting percentage.
Senior opposite hitter and current MPSF Player of
the Week Curt Toppel led the team in kills with 12,
but was held to just a . 194 hitting percentage. Toppel
also added 5 digs, 3 blocks and a service ace.

Although Stanford came away with another sweep
against Irvine, Saturday night's match was much
tighter, but the Cardinal was able to make key plays to
come away with the win.
"Statistically, Irvine is about the best team in the
country defensively, so I was pretty happy with our
play," Shaw said. "We did a great job positioning and
coming up with digs."
The defensive efforts of the two teams were ex
tremely well-matched. While the Anteaters out
blocked the Cardinal 11-9, Stanford edged out Irvine
in digs, 34-31.
The Cardinal defense was especially strong against
Irvine's toughest hitter, junior Jimmy Pelzel. Al
though the outside hitter recorded 16 kills, he was
held to just a .211 hitting percentage.
For Stanford, Toppel again led the way, racking
up 14 kills, four digs, four blocks and two service aces.
Senior middle blocker Paul Bocage also excelled
for Stanford, recording 13 kills on a stunning .706 hit
ting percentage.
Hansen was also impressive as he posted team
highs in assists and digs, with 50 and 8, respectively.
Against the Anteaters, the Cardinal came away not
only with a win, but it was able to show its ability to
make plays during crunch time.
Stanford was able to pull ahead in a very close third
game, 32-30, to close out the match and clinch home
court advantage.
As the team enters the playoffs, strong play under
pressure will mean the difference between a win and
a loss as every team in the tournament has a legitimate
shot of taking it all.
"We're on a roll and playing with a very high level
of confidence," Shaw said. "It was a real team effort
this weekend. And even though we didn't use a lot of
our bench, all those guys are really ready to play and
I think that's a real sign of a championship team."
