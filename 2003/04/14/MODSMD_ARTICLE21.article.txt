### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Arizona State Sun Devils were up to their old
tricks this weekend at the 31st Annual ASU Thun
derbird Invitational. For the 12th time in tourna
ment history, the host team spoiled the fun for its
guests by capturing the team title.
The team opened the competition with rounds of
281 and 270, ending play on Friday at 25 shots
under par, six strokes in front of second-place Pep
perdine. On Saturday, they made a statement,
shooting a 15-under-par 273 in the final 18 holes,
The excellent round catapulted the Sun Devils to
a record-setting victory and a three-round total of
824,40 strokes under par.
The Stanford team, on the other hand, met with
mixed results during the two-day tournament, en
joying individual success but ultimately finishing in
seventh place, just a shot behind No. 2 Texas.
Coming into the event, one of the team's greatest

concerns was the health of senior leader Jim Seki,
dubious of his chances in Tempe due to recent back
problems.
However, Seki answered any questions about his
injury emphatically on Friday, shooting 69-68 in his
opening 36 holes. It was his best opening-day per
formance in more than a month, and his total of 137
landed him in fourth place individually —just three
strokes off the tournament lead.
In a surprise move, coach JefT Mitchell started
freshman Kyle Gentry, who hadn't seen action for
the Cardinal since The Prestige in early November.
"I have been working really hard with my swing
coach and in the fall it really took its toll," Gentry said.
" Thankfully I was able to practice over the winter
and get my swing and game so that I could trust it."
The off-season work definitely appeared to make
a difference this weekend. In Gentry's previous
three outings, his lowest round had been 72,
notched at The Prestige.
The first-year player stormed out of the starting
gate, tallying rounds of 71 and 68 on Friday, climb
ing the leader board into a tie for 11th place, just two
shots back of Seki.
Sophomore Kevin Blue, coming off a top-25 per
formance in last week's Western Intercollegiate, also
started solidly for the Cardinal. His first two rounds
of 71 and 72 left him in a tie for 39th place, but with
a good chance to move up in the standings with a
strong final round.
By contrast, senior George Downing and junior
Blake Mastalir struggled in their first two rounds.
Downing, who has been extremely consistent for the
Cardinal in recent weeks, shot an uncharacteristic
77 in the opening round, tying for 71st place overall
at the end of the day.
Mastalir's struggles at the Karsten Golf Course
continued, as he carded a first-round 78 en route to
a two-round total of 151. He was tied for 96th Friday
night.
In seventh place as a team after two rounds, the
Cardinal was only eight shots out of second place.
Needing a strong final round, the Cardinal came
out on Saturday with their sights set on the leaders.
Seki fired a two-under-par 70 to finish tied for seventh
place, his first top-10 showing of the spring season.
Gentry also continued his solid play with a 71,
tying for 24th and claiming the first top-25 finish of
his college career.
"This round adds a little confidence," Gentry
said. "I have felt that I was letting the team down by
not shooting the scores that Jeff had recruited me
for. At the end of March I really felt that my game
was ready to play, and I am happy with the results at
Karsten."
