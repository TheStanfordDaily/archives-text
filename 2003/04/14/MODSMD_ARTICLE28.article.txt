" The selection process this year

said David Endelman, the current
CEO of SSE. The six-member se

It was his "love of SSE, entrepre

undergraduate degree at Stanford
with a major in English and a minor

During his term as CEO, Alisha
ran plans to build on the SSE's
focus on business.

on business education, along with

valuable services to Stanford stu
dents and run profitable business
es," he said.
He also hopes to further the or

"The idea is that we're pro

we're constantly improving," Al
isharan said. "It's my hope that the
effects of my policy will be felt by
most students, in terms of better
quality service, better-value goods,
and for my employees, an even
better SSE experience. Every
thing in SSE is a great opportuni
ty to give back to the Stanford
community."
