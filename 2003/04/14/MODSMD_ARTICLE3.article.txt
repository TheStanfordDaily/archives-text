# ROTC readies military leaders
## 
### WHITNEY SADO STAFF WRITER 
Although the mass media is currently dominated by
coverage of the U.S. military in Iraq, many Stanford
students say they do not know anyone in the military,
making it harder for them to grasp the reality of war.
However, approximately 30 Stanford students are in
volved in the U.S. military through the Reserve Offi
cers' Training Corps, and these students watch the un
folding world situation with particular interest and
concern.
ROTC is a nationwide program that trains college
students to become officers in a specific branch of the
military. Students who participate in ROTC during all
four years of their undergraduate career receive a full
college scholarship from the U.S. government and a
stipend for books and cost of living expenses, in addi
tion to a guaranteed job upon graduation. In ex
change, students must devote considerable time to the
program while also attending college full-time, and
they are required to serve active duty in the military for
at least four years following graduation.
ROTC is an intense program, and only two upper
classmen from Stanford, juniors Justin Biolo and
Sandy Kjono, are involved in Navy ROTC. Participants
say that students choose to join ROTC because they
need financial assistance to attend college, but also be
cause they come from military families or because they
want to learn leadership skills and ultimately serve
their country.
" I personally wanted to join Army ROTC because of
the fun challenges you encounter and the unique lead
ership training you receive," said freshman Bobby
Crotty. "We do obstacle courses, team challenge cours
es and many other challenging yet rewarding activities,
from which you learn to work together as a team, and,
when need be, to lead a team."
The benefits of participating in ROTC. as opposed to
attending a military academy include the ability to have
a civilian college experience while still training to be
come a military officer, participants say.
Despite this advantage, matters are also more com-
plicated for Stanford students, be
cause ROTC has not been housed
on campus since 1969, when it was
eliminated amidst anti-war senti
ment by faculty who did not sup
port the program. Stanford stu
dents who participate in ROTC
must travel to other Bay Area
schools several times a week, an in
convenience that these students
willingly endure.
"During the busiest weeks,
Kjono and I joked we were hardly
students of our own school since we
were at Berkeley three to four days
a week," said Biolo, a naval platoon
commander and next year's battal
ion commanding officer."It has
rarely seemed like work, though."
ROTC has remained off campus
since 1969, and though there have
been movements to bring it back,
opponents have argued that it
would be inappropriate for Stan
ford to house an organization that
discriminates against gay students,
citing the military's "don't ask,
don't tell" policy, or to give Univer
sity credit for military training.
Three branches of military ser
vice are represented among Stan
ford students â€” the Army, which
meets at Santa Clara University, the
Air Force, which meets at San Jose
State University, and the Navy,
which meets at UC-Berkeley.
The overall time commitment
among ROTC participants varies
greatly, with the minimum being
about six hours a week of drills,
briefs, inspections, science classes
and labs, as well as leadership in
struction. Some Stanford students
spend much more time with
ROTC, however.
"Cadets take on more leader
ship roles in the cadet corps as they
get older and demonstrate a high
level of motivation and ability," said
senior Melissa Corley, a cadet wing
commander with the Air Force.
"These roles add more time. I have
spent at least 20 to 25 hours a week,
if not more, on ROTC with some of

my leadership positions.
This heavy involvement in
ROTC can be frustrating for Stan
ford students, who often must sacri
fice other extracurricular activities
in order to devote their energies to
school and ROTC. Participants say
they also feel underappreciated by
their peers, who are often unaware
that Stanford students are involved
with ROTC, and the University,
which does not offer University
credit for ROTC classes.
"Sometimes the weekly time
commitment is extremely difficult,
as ROTC units are not recognized
at Stanford and so represent an 'in
visible' addition to a normal Stan
ford workload," Corley said.
ROTC students say they desire
to be recognized and appreciated
and fear how the military is per
ceived as a result of the war in Iraq.
"I feel there is a prevailing view
that those of us in the military are
something different, if not less,
than human," Biolo remarked. "As
if the part of us that made us
human was already lost, and maybe
as the public we forget every sailor,
soldier, airman and officer is also
someone's friend, brother, mother
or daughter."
Yet even with these difficulties,
ROTC students like Corley who re
main with the program to the end
express satisfaction with their
choice.
"Despite the frustration of my
main extracurricular activity not
being recognized by Stanford, Air
Force ROTC has been an extreme
ly rewarding experience for me,
and the quality of leadership train
ing I have received and made the
most of is an integral part of who I
am at Stanford and who I will be
when I leave," she said.
These students, especially those
close to graduating, must pay spe
cial attention to current world
events, as they realize that they will
soon be actively serving in the
armed forces. As officers, they will
have large responsibilities. Some
have the potential to be involved in
direct combat, while others will
work behind the scenes as engi
neers and project managers.
