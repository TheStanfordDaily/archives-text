# Awakuni, students discuss Univ. space
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student leaders met last Friday
at a town hall meeting to discuss cre
ating more space for student activi
ties on campus, including proposed
reconstruction plans to renovate
Old Union and reconsider storage
allocation. The chair for the student
space expansion effort, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Gene Awakuni,
used the town hall forum to map
out the team's objectives through an
hour-long slide show.
A task force behind this endeav
or has been working since April
2002, when concerns increased
about the lack of rooms to meet the
academic, artistic and community
pursuits on campus.
The task force is comprised of

faculty, stall and students, whose
input is compiled in the tentative
plans to renovate decaying facilities
while constructing more areas for
storage, meeting and rehearsal.
Awakuni explained that Stan
ford is unique in its possession of
600 student groups. According to
Awakuni, Harvard and Princeton,
two schools that he has visited to
learn more about their space ac
commodations, have less than half
of Stanford's clubs.
This is more than enough impe
tus for what Awakuni calls "the first
comprehensive, systematic look at
student space on [Stanford's] cam
pus."

lain, director of capital planning,
echoed Awakuni's concerns about
the inadequacy in the amount and
the condition of space.
The three answered questions in
a dialogue posed by students repre
senting clubs ranging from the Car
dinal Ballet to the Black Student
Union. The trio also introduced
and articulated their future con
struction plans to foster the educa
tional and community life on cam
pus.
Awakuni's slideshow presenta
tion contained an oudine for the
Master Plan and the group's objec
tives. The Master Plan consists of
two phases. The first seeks to revi
talize Old Union through renova
tion of the Clubhouse, Nitery and
student publications. Phase two fo
cuses on the reconstruction, addi
tion and possible replacement of

Tresidder. A new addendum to the
Capital Plan includes revitalizing
the campus core through land
scape, circulation and outdoor
space enhancements.
Another goal is to establish better
connections between buildings and
spaces through removal of stairway
entrances.
"If you look at the architectural
design of the Bookstore, Old Union
and Tresidder," Chamberlain said,
"you will see that they are all sepa
rate entities. Our goal is to create a
connection between die spaces by
getting the buildings to talk to one
another."
Though the Master Plan does
not account for current space limi
tations, the task force is working on
smaller, short-term projects. This
includes moving offices out of the
Nitery for student use.
The three task force leaders have
reviewed prior studies conducted
by The Stanford Daily and the
Graduate Student Council in 2001.
Awakuni noted that The Daily erro

neously printed in March that the
Task Force rejected the GSC plan
while, in actuality, its provisions
were incorporated into the Master
Plan.
Awakuni, Howe and Chamber
lain addressed audience questions
of a uniform magnetic key lock sys
tem to allow free movement from
dorm to dorm, sound proofing of
certain rooms and a place for visual
and performing arts.
ITie task force is relying heavily
on peer institutions to sei"ve as com
parisons. However, the most im
portant feedback comes from stu
dents and administrators on cam
pus, representatives said.
Focus student groups have al
ready been used to give suggestions
for possible improvements. The
town hall dialogue was intended to
give students information about the
upcoming plans and receive feed
back on those plans. The task force
will continue to employ student
help in finalizing plans to rebuild
what it calls "the soul of Stanford."
