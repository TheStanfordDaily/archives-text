Student leaders met last Friday
at a town hall meeting to discuss cre
ating more space for student activi
ties on campus, including proposed
reconstruction plans to renovate
Old Union and reconsider storage
allocation. The chair for the student
space expansion effort, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Gene Awakuni,
used the town hall forum to map
out the team's objectives through an
hour-long slide show.
A task force behind this endeav
or has been working since April
2002, when concerns increased
about the lack of rooms to meet the
academic, artistic and community
pursuits on campus.
The task force is comprised of

faculty, stall and students, whose
input is compiled in the tentative
plans to renovate decaying facilities
while constructing more areas for
storage, meeting and rehearsal.
Awakuni explained that Stan
ford is unique in its possession of
600 student groups. According to
Awakuni, Harvard and Princeton,
two schools that he has visited to
learn more about their space ac
commodations, have less than half
of Stanford's clubs.
This is more than enough impe
tus for what Awakuni calls "the first
comprehensive, systematic look at
student space on [Stanford's] cam
pus."
