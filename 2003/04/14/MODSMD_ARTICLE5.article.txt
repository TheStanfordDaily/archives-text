# Law school introduces minority admits to Farm
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
The School of Law drew a diverse
mix of students to campus this week
end for its Minority Admit Weekend.
Events were designed not only to aid
prospective students in deciding where
they should attend law school, but also
to showcase the resources and environ
ment the campus has to offer for mi
nority students.
Although the weekend is designated
for minority admits, the event coordi
nators said they do not think that it dif
fered to any large extent from other
admit weekend proceedings hosted by
the University.

"The fact that the Law School has a
separate admit weekend was not really
planned," said Catherine Glaze, associ
ate dean for student affairs at the Law
School. "My guess is that it is really a
timing issue."
Every year the Law School and Uni
versity are challenged with scheduling
activities for prospective students so
that they will not conflict with similar
events at their peer institutions. Ac
cording to Glaze, a separate weekend
was organized for minorities in order to
make sure all admitted students had
the opportunity to explore Stanford as
well as similar programs at other
schools.
"We want to be able to let students

admitted to more than one school par
ticipate in all the programs they can so
they can make the best choice for their
particular needs," Glaze said. "Law
school is different from other graduate
and professional programs in so many
ways that we think it is beneficial to
allow students to focus on what the
Stanford Law School experience will be
like."
Consequently, the weekend's agen
da placed emphasis on acquainting stu
dents with not only campus, but also
the larger Bay Area. After registering
and attending a welcome lunch in the
Law School's student lounge on Satur
day, students took a trip to San Francis
co where they visited the Golden Gate

Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Union
Square and other tourist attractions in
the city.
According to Glaze, the smaller and
more specific turnout for the weekend
allowed coordinators to focus on the
specifics of various programs offered at
the Law School. A committee of current
student representatives from various
ethnic organizations helped develop
programming to appeal to these
prospective students.
Key players in this effort were stu
dents from the Asian Pacific Islander
Law Students Association, the Black
Law Students Association, the Stanford
Latino Law Students Association
and others.
"We try to balance a sense of
what the academic life of the Law
School is like with what it means to
be living here for three years,"
Glaze said. "We want admits who
attend the weekend to leave with a
sense of what it would be like to be
a student of color at Stanford Law
School."
Alumni, professors and current
students held panels yesterday

communicating what prospective
students could expect from their
years at Stanford if they choose to
attend. The Women of Color Ac
tion Network gave a presentation
for interested students, and group
tours were led throughout the
campus, from the Cantor Arts Mu
seum to the Hoover Tower.
Glaze said, "We want the admits
to get a sense of the intellectual vi
brancy of Stanford Law School, a
sense of the community here, not
just classmates but also faculty and
alumni, and for students from the
East Coast, a sense of what it means
to be on the West Coast and so far
from home."

The weekend's events were part
of the Law School's greater efforts
to attract and maintain a diverse
student body.
"We engage in aggressive out
reach to identify strong potential
applicants from minority groups,"
said Faye Deal, associate dean for
admission and financial aid at the
Law School. "As we decide whom
to accept for admission, we certain
ly take the value of a diverse class of
law students in mind."
According to Deal, in order to
ensure this level of diversity, the
Law School contacts both pre-law
groups at other universities and
qualified individuals who have

taken the LSAT or who have indi
cated interest in law school, even
though they may not necessarily
decide to apply to Stanford.
"Once admitted, efforts are
made to get a high yield of minori
ty students by having faculty,
alums and current students advise
the admits about their choice and
address any special concerns,"
Deal said.
Glaze affirmed, "We think that
if we paint a realistic picture of
what life is like for students of color
at Stanford Law School, they will
have the information they need to
make the best decision about what
law school they should attend.
