# Law school introduces minority admits to Farm

### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
The School of Law drew a diverse
mix of students to campus this week
end for its Minority Admit Weekend.
Events were designed not only to aid
prospective students in deciding where
they should attend law school, but also
to showcase the resources and environ
ment the campus has to offer for mi
nority students.
Although the weekend is designated
for minority admits, the event coordi
nators said they do not think that it dif
fered to any large extent from other
admit weekend proceedings hosted by
the University.

"The fact that the Law School has a
separate admit weekend was not really
planned," said Catherine Glaze, associ
ate dean for student affairs at the Law
School. "My guess is that it is really a
timing issue."
Every year the Law School and Uni
versity are challenged with scheduling
activities for prospective students so
that they will not conflict with similar
events at their peer institutions. Ac
cording to Glaze, a separate weekend
was organized for minorities in order to
make sure all admitted students had
the opportunity to explore Stanford as
well as similar programs at other
schools.
"We want to be able to let students

admitted to more than one school par
ticipate in all the programs they can so
they can make the best choice for their
particular needs," Glaze said. "Law
school is different from other graduate
and professional programs in so many
ways that we think it is beneficial to
allow students to focus on what the
Stanford Law School experience will be
like."
Consequently, the weekend's agen
da placed emphasis on acquainting stu
dents with not only campus, but also
the larger Bay Area. After registering
and attending a welcome lunch in the
Law School's student lounge on Satur
day, students took a trip to San Francis
co where they visited the Golden Gate

Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Union
Square and other tourist attractions in
the city.
According to Glaze, the smaller and
more specific turnout for the weekend
allowed coordinators to focus on the
specifics of various programs offered at
the Law School. A committee of current
student representatives from various
ethnic organizations helped develop
programming to appeal to these
prospective students.
Key players in this effort were stu
dents from the Asian Pacific Islander
Law Students Association, the Black
Law Students Association, the Stanford
