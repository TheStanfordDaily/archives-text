# Honors society hosts egg-drop contest
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's first annual egg drop contest ended in a
tie on Friday afternoon, with two teams splitting the
$1,000 grand prize. More than 100 students came to
watch the event, which featured 35 different teams
who each attempted to build a device to protect one or
more uncooked eggs in a fall from the fifth floor of the
Terman Engineering balcony.
"There was a pretty good turnout," said coterminal
mechanical engineering student Steve Compton. "We
liked the huge variation in designs, sizes and approaches."
The event was sponsored by Tail Beta Pi, the Stan
ford engineering honors society, along with the Stan
ford Engineering Association, Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman and the School of
Engineering. Brad Osgood, the acting associate dean
of Engineering and a professor of electrical engineer
ing, judged the event. Out of the 35 entries, there were
only 15 successful drops. Of the 20 unsuccessful drops,
14 had broken eggs and six devices landed outside of a
prescribed boundary.
"1 think that the event went very well," said TBP
event organizer Scott Ogawa, a coterminal mechani
cal engineering student. "This was a good way to get
TBP's name out and provide a fun activity lor the
campus and engineering community."
Spectators included professors who often peeked
out of their office windows in the building and engi
neering administrators.
"This was a great idea," said Mechanical Engineer
ing Design Administrative Associate Charlie Ellinger.
"Students are obviously having fun."
The two winning teams, "42" and "Twins," received
tied scores of 3.9 in a complex formula that took into ac
count the weight and minimum dimension of the de
vice and the number of eggs that were dropped. Some
teams did not realize that the devices would be judged
by a formula.
"Our design worked, but we did not read the spec
ifications," said doctoral candidate Vignesh Anu.
"When we got here, we realized that our design wasn't
optimal for the conditions given. We could have prob
ably added a few eggs. But it was good fun."
Fliers were posted in freshman dorms and contest
announcements were made at house meetings to "en-

courage freshmen to take engineer
ing classes and consider engineer
ing," Ogawa said.
The winning team, "42," with
freshmen Matt Gamboa and Ross
Cheung, constructed their device
with paper, egg crate, floss, a plastic
bag and staples.
They said, "The event was en
joyable, but we were more nervous
than we thought we'd be."
They plan to use their prize money
to pay for books, and also to "stay at
Stanford for an extra 15 minutes."
The other winning team, "Twins,"
with seniors Shijun Liu and Alan
Amaya, called the event "very stress
ful" and said that they broke seven
eggs and stayed up until 5 a.m. on Fri
day morning to construct their de
sign. The device was made of thread,
newspaper, tape and Styrofoam cups
and ground meat containers.
