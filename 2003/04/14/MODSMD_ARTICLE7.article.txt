# Students walk for AIDS in SF
## 
### KARI LUNDGREN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Undaunted by pouring rain and an early
morning bus ride, more than 30 Stanford
students made their way to San Francisco
this past Saturday to participate in one of 10
"student global AIDS walks" that took place
in several major cities across the United
States. Stanford students joined students
from UC-Berkeley, UC-San Francisco and a
variety of local colleges and high schools.
Registration fees and donations went to
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foun
dation, which supports a variety of treat
ment programs that bring antiretroviral and
other AIDS-related medicines to patients in
Africa, Asia and Latin America. All together,
the 10 AIDS walks raised $35,492.
Organizer Christina Rierhers, a sophomore,
said that 200 participants registered for the walk
in San Francisco. However, Riechers noted that

closer to 150 actually came and added, "Consid
ering the pouring rain, we were very pleased."
A bus left Tresidder at 9 a.m. The walk
started at 11 a.m. after a brief speech from
Arthur Ammann, president of Global Strate
gies for HIV / AIDS.
According to Ammann, "In Zimbabwe, for
ever) 1 new teacher brought in to schools, one
is lost to AIDS." He strongly emphasized the
importance of grassroots initiatives and com
mented that "the money raised will make an
impact â€” 20 to 30 dollars can in Sub-Saha
ran Africa, for example, educate between two
to four children." He also mentioned his own
belief that "we have an untapped resource
against AIDS and that is students."
Following this speech, senior Jacqueline
Wamalwa, originally from Botswana,
stepped up to sing "Can't Give Up Now" and
called fora moment of silence in remern-
