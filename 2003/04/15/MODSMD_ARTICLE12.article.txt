## Lawsuit challenges med rules 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€”
Health care professionals and pa
tient advocates have sued to over
turn new medical privacy rules
that took effect yesterday, claim
ing the regulations do more harm
than good.
The suit, filed in Philadelphia,
said the rules crafted by the De
partment of Health and Human
Services violate patient rights by al
lowing insurance companies and
other groups to view medical
records without permission.
"There is an endless line of
people who have very good rea
sons why they need your health
information. But the question is,
do they have a right to it without
asking your permission first? We
say they don't," said James Pyles,
an attorney for the plaintiffs.
The regulations bar medical
providers from giving out patient
information to third parties, ex
cept in certain cases. Pharmacies,
for example, may see records
needed to fill a prescription. In
surance companies can see
records needed to process a bill
In drafting the rules, the Clin
ton administration inserted a
clause that would have required a
patient's written consent before
confidential data were released.
But the Bush administration elim
inated that requirement over fears
it would create surplus paperwork
and complicate patient care.
