# Iraq: Loose ends remain after war
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — By
any normal gauge, the war with
Iraq is over. Saddam Hussein's
government is gone, all key cities
are seized, major combat is wind
ing down and two aircraft carriers
are going home.
Yet major questions remain,
including the whereabouts of
Saddam and any weapons of mass
destruction and whether Iraqis
can govern themselves after a
quarter-century of one-man rule.
The role of the United Nations
or individual nations in Iraq's fu
ture also is up in the air. The Unit
ed States has invited its coalition
partners to talks on rebuilding
Iraq — but not countries that ob
jected to the war such as Germany,
France and Russia.
Some of these loose ends could
take months or even years to tie

up, analysts suggest.
But for now, nobody is disput
ing the immediacy or decisiveness
of the allied military successes.
Saddam's "regime is in disar
ray and no longer in control of
Iraq," said Brig. Gen. Vincent
Brooks at Central Command
headquarters in Qatar. At the
Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Stanley Mc-
Chrystal told reporters Monday,
"I would anticipate that the
major combat operations are
over."
Administration officials basked
in the details:
There have been relatively few
allied casualties: As of Monday,
121 American and 31 British ser
vice members had died. Four
American troops remained miss
ing. Eight U.S. prisoners of war
were rescued.
