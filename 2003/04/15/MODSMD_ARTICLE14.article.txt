# Justice Breyer says courts must uphold civil liberties

NEW YORK (AP) â€” Lawyers and judges
must ensure that civil liberties are protected
in the government's efforts to prevent ter
rorist attacks, Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Breyer said yesterday.
Breyer urged attorneys to question gov
ernment anti-terrorism practices, including
the lack of access to legal counsel for some
people detained for questioning.
"The Constitution always matters, per
haps particularly so in times of emergency,"
Breyer told the Association of the Bar of the

City of New York.
By searching for alternative methods that
avoid "constitutional mistakes," lawyers,
judges and security officials help the gov
ernment avoid extreme positions that the
Constitution doesn't matter or that security
emergencies don't matter, Breyer said.
Several court cases contend the Bush ad
ministration has gone too far in the war on
terror, both in tracking and locking up sus
pects following the Sept. 11 attacks and in
denying legal representation to Afghan War

fighters detained at a U.S. naval base in Cuba.
Breyer said that while the administration
may claim that courts do not have jurisdic
tion in some of the terror cases, judges will
have to make that determination.
Members of the Supreme Court are gen
erally circumspect in commenting on poli
tics and policy outside their formal opinions.
Some do, however, occasionally try to use
their public appearances to gently influence
the legal system's agenda.
Breyer said that disagreements "about

government restrictions, security threats, civil
liberties, do not mean that disaster is upon us,
but that the democratic process is at work."
Named to the court in 1994 by President
Clinton, Breyer generally votes liberally.
Susan Herman, a professor at Brooklyn
Law School, said Breyer's trip "may be a way
for him to present a different point of view"
than that by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
a moderate conservative who after the at
tacks predicted unprecedented restrictions
on Americans' personal freedom.
