## The
						Stanford Daily Valuing the rankings 
### 
Editorial

In U.S. News & World Report's "America's
Best Graduate Schools 2004," the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business was
ranked second — behind the Harvard
Business School — and lost its place as the top
business school in the country for the first time
in four years. But neither Business School stu
dents nor administrators seemed too con
cerned.
One second-year Business School student
said, "I didn't base my decision [to come here]
on rankings; I based it on the kind of school, the
kind of culture, the kind of education I want
ed."
"We don't run the school for rankings" said
Dan Rudolph, Business School Senior Associ
ate Dean and Chief Operating Officer.
Rudolph is right. A school's main priority
should never be to outrank other schools in a
race to the top. However, that the school has
fallen from the No. 1 to the No. 2 spot should
not be so easily dismissed.
While the rankings often face a fair amount
of criticism — some, for example, claim that the
criteria by which the schools are assessed are
not the most significant characteristics about a
school — they serve an important purpose.
The rankings encourage competition among
schools.
Schools are always in competition with
one another, particularly for students. While
prospective students rely on campus visits
and talking to current students — qualitative
characteristics that cannot be measured in
numbers — they also rely on the quantitative
comparisons that are offered by rankings. So
despite the fact that schools like the Business
School are not "run for the rankings," the

rankings are not ignored by schools.
And the fact that schools do pay attention
to rankings is not such a negative idea be
cause a school cannot improve its ranking
standing without actually implementing pos
itive changes. For example, in order to re
ceive a higher rating in the "graduates em
ployed at graduation" next year, the Busi
ness School may bring more recruiters to
campus or provide its students with more
employment resources. Such measures
would not only help the school in the rank
ings but also — and more importantly — im
prove the quality of life for Business School
students.
The rankings drive many of the school's
initiatives for self-improvement and, as a re
sult, play a large part in creating the "kind of
school, the kind of culture [and] the kind of
education" that students — even those who
do not pay particular attention to the rank
ings themselves — look for when applying to
and matriculating in a school.
Without rankings, fewer schools would
have incentives to improve what they offer
their students, both in and outside of the
classroom. The rankings act as a check on
the schools, by setting standards to which all
schools must meet. And in trying to attract
the best and brightest students, which many
schools want to do, they are required to not
only meet but also exceed these expecta
tions.
Instead of simply writing off the fact that the
Business School is no longer ranked No. 1, the
school should carefully assess what it is that
caused the change — and ensure that it isn't a
foreshadowing of the future.
