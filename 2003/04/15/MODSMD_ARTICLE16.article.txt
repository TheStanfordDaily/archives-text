# Unmatched opportunities
## 
### 
At last week's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, a bill to revive the
Guest Professorship Board passed
unanimously. For nearly two
decades the board brought professors, select
ed by students, to Stanford to teach classes
fora quarter. The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate has taken a step in the right direction
in approving the new board, under which
students will once again have the opportuni
ty to nominate non-Stanford professors to
teach for-credit courses on campus.
Stanford is a world-class research institu
tion and its faculty are leading scholars in
their fields â€” currently, there are 17 Nobel
laureates and four Pulitzer Prize winners
teaching on campus. Even so, Stanford does
not always offer courses that meet the diverse
academic interests of nearly 7,000 under
graduate students. The GPB, if successful,
will be able to help accommodate those stu
dents.

According to ASSU Undergraduate Sena
tor Howie Chiou, the guest professors would
not have external involvements so that they
could focus entirely on teaching, and there
would be opportunities for mentorship and
collaboration between the professors and stu
dents. Moreover, the guest professors could
link academic ideas across different universi
ties, therefore actively working on the dis
semination of new information and knowl
edge.
We hope that students will take advantage
of this opportunity to explore their academic
interests. The courses, along with courses
taught by the top Stanford faculty, will con
tinue to expand the breadth of information
available in the academic field. Ever contem
plated going to Princeton because you want
ed to take a class with Toni Morrison? The
Guest Professorship Board could be the
chance to take creative writing with the
Nobel Prize-winning author.
