# LYING IN THE GRASS
## Stanford Night Live 
### 
It's great to be here at the in
augural CoHo Comedy
Night! Like any good Stan
ford institution, the CoHo
likes to try new things out every
once in awhile—ever-changing
food rotations, questionable retro
furnishings, whatever. So now, for
your entertaining pleasures,
they're giving "Saturday Night
Live" wannabes like me a chance
to shine on stage.
Since we're all nerds, I might as
well start with the libraries. At
Green Library, having the guy out
front checking your bags is an un
necessary formality. He doesn't
want to look through hundreds of
bags everyday, and you don't want
to open it. If I really wanted to
walk out with a primary document
from 1827 and auction it off on
Ebay, I could. Or maybe 1 did, but
I'm just not telling you.
And walking through the bow
els of the stacks, remember that
there are light switches at the end
of each aisle. It took me two years
to realize that. Just thinking about
traversing through those dank
halls on a stormy Monday evening
makes me wet my pants.
Speaking of pissing, it pisses me
off the way Stanford holds itself as
an Ivy League school-in-training.
Our mascot, the Cardinal, is a
derivation of Cornell colors and
our primal scream is a Harvard
relic. The Ivy envy goes so far as to
have the plants infesting the entire
front side of Roble Hall. In some
ways, though, we'll never catch up:
They've got a couple hundred
years of history on us, and globs of
their graduates have occupied the
Oval Office at one time or another.
The administration can argue
whatever it w.an,ts, but Harvard,
Yale and Princeton will always
hold a more hallowed position in
world opinion.

In the midst of
all the U.S. News
& World Report
posturing, we
have the bi
monthly alumni
magazine perpet
uating a perfect
life after Stanford.
In the Class Notes

section, there's always information
about somebody graduating from
law school, getting married or hav
ing a third kid. What about the
people who have gotten the pink

"I can count two phallic
symbols around campus:
Hoover Tower, of course, and
the misplaced totem pole
behind the Bookstore. One
thing lam sure 0f... Freud's
right — I'm really jealous of
those New Guinea carving next
to Roble Hall' y

slip or have been through multiple
divorces? The Class Notes would
be much more interesting if it were
written as a gossip column, or even
better, denigrated into complete
slander.
Hold on. I think I hear crickets
chirping. Are you guys that
zonked out by the prospects of
looming midterms, or is the mike
volume too low? Here, let's talk
about sex. I can count two phallic
symbols around campus: fioover
Tower, of course, and the mis
placed totem pole behind the
Bookstore. Perhaps it's just my

perverted mind instilling ques
tionable symbolism where there
is none. One thing 1 am sure of,
however, is that Freud's right —
I'm really jealous of those New
Guinea carvings next to Roble
Hall.
Of course, with the weather
getting better, everybody is out
and about, enjoying the wonders
of Mother Nature. Freshmen are
hopping through the fountains,
picking up the latest tropical dis
eases from the bird droppings
amidst the recycled water. Up
perclassmen are hoping to wit
ness the revival of Lake Lagunita,
whose embedded redundancy is
overshadowed by the fact that a
giant ditch does not constitute a
body of water. And everybody is
awaiting the legendary Exotic
Erotic party, where, in line with
Title IX, women should also be
given the opportunity to wear
one article of clothing.
Some things I'll never figure
out. The übiquity of the word
"sketchy." Carping about ASSU
ineptitude when few others want
to rise to the occasion and run.
The evolution of "pork" through
out the course of a day at Wilbur
Dining.
Hey, why are you people still
sipping your drinks and talking
in a low hum, as if I don't exist?
Oh crap, I see the lady at the reg
ister dialing up the Stanford Po
lice. OK, maybe there is no CoHo
Comedy Night, but I'm still exer
cising my right to the First. You
can't remove me from my soap
box, you Rumsfeld-philes. Save
your eggs and tomatoes fora chef
salad; I gotta jet before the boys
in blue get here. Love ya'll!

Think I have a chance in a real comedy
club? Sign me up fora gig at
cfeng@stanford.edu.
