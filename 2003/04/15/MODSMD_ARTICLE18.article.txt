ROTC involvement on campus is higher
than reported
I was surprised to read in the article
"ROTC readies military leaders" (April
14) that "only two upperclassmen from
Stanford, juniors Justin Bioloand Sandy
Kjono, are involved in Navy ROTC." I
am an upperclassman, and I am in
volved in the Navy ROTC. I will earn my
commission when I graduate in June.
Many of my friends are also in the Navy
ROTC.
For the record, Navy ROTC enroll
ment at Stanford is six freshmen, two
sophomores, two juniors, four seniors and
one co-terminal student. That's seven up
perclassmen, not two.

Stanford Chapparal does not own
me moon
In the article citing ASSU election re
sults, "Senior class election under fire;
Figueroa, Natoli win" (April 1 I), The Daily

reported that some members of the Stan
ford Chapparal arrived at the announce
ment with a sign that read, "We own the
moon."
I'd like to submit a small clarification
about this: The Stanford Chapparal does
not own the moon — I do. Or at least part
of it. And I can submit documentation if
necessary.
The moon was claimed in 1980 by Cali
fornia entrepreneur Dennis M. Hope, who
exploited a legal loophole in the 1967 Unit
ed Nations C )uter Space Treaty to assert full
property rights of the moon and the other
planets in the solar system. He currendy
sells one-acre plots of moon estate on his
website, www.moonshop.com.
The Daily should've gotten the facts
straight before it reported, and to my
friends at the Stanford University Chappa
ral, be forewarned: If you do not cease and
desist with your contrarian claims immedi
ately, I will be forced to take legal action.

Cross burning devalues communities
Regai ding the issue of cross burning, I
believe that free speech is protected, but
burning a cross is wrongful conduct. On

the other hand, I deeply believe that the
word "God" should remain in the pledge
of allegiance. How do we reconcile these
two views politically?
In my opinion, this is about commu
nity values. I believe burning a cross is
wrong and devalues other people
whereas expressing a general apprecia
tion of God has been shown to improve
our nation. The next question is how do
we reconcile these views legally? I agree
with Justice Thomas, that cross burning
stands for racial discrimination. To
quote Thomas, "just as one cannot burn
down someone's house to make a politi
cal point and then seek refuge in the
First Amendment, those who hate can
not terrorize and intimidate to make
their point."
Understanding the pledge of allegiance
constitutes the opposite side of this equa
tion is important. The pledge clearly is ex
pression and not conduct. I do not believe
that the mention of God in the pledge of
allegiance violates the First Amendment. I
believe that this issue will eventually reach
the Supreme Court. I also believe the
Supreme Court will reach a valuable con
clusion: Cross burning is wrong. God is
important.
