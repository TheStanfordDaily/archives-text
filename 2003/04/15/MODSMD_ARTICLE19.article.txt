Califomia-like weather, die Cardinal (10-

over No. 20 Noithwestern and No. 15
Notre Dame, the latter coming in a
dirilling, double-overtime affair.

Friday: No. 16 Stanford 9, No. 20 North
western 5
Sunday: Stanford 14, No. 15 Notre Dame
13, (2 0T)

On Friday, Stanford battled back from
a 4-3 halftime deficit to defeat Northwest
ern 9-5 in Chicago.
"We got off to a shaky start," said sopho
more Nina Pantano. "But after awhile, and
surely in the second half, we took control of
the game."
Pantano helped shift the momentum,
scoring her second goal of the match, as did
freshman Megan Burker as part of a 6-1
second-lialf ( Cardinal run.
Ilie Stanford defense also did its part,
as junior goalkeeper Christina Saikus
notched six of her 10 saves after the break.
The Cardinal's tendency to play below
its potential at times, such as its slow start
against Northwestern, is one area the
team has aimed to improve this season.
"Whenever we play our game we can
compete with anyone,"

said sophomore Claire Calzonetti, who
went on to point out that die team's focus
is to "minimize the lulls" in games.
" Perfect catching and passing as well as
disciplined body defense," Calzonetti said,
are the team's tactics to confront periodic
lapses.
The slow stait that nearly cost the Car
dinal on Friday was a non-issue two days
later, as Stanford wasted no timejumping
out to an early lead in its matchup with
No. 15 Notre Dame in South Bend.
The highlight of the weekend came
when sophomore Kelsey Twist netted her
fourth goal of the game, the game winner
widi 2:35 remaining in the second over
time.
"There was definitely a lot of drama for
a lacrosse game," coach Michelle
Uhlfelder said.
Pantano scored two early goals and
Burker added another to give Stanford a 3-
0 lead just six minutes in.
The Fighting Irish stormed back and
field a 7-6 lead late in tfie first half before
Burker knotted the score at 7-7 with 10
seconds left in die half.
" There was a constant shift of momen
tum," Pantano said. "It was really excit
ing."
Hie Irish tcxik a 9-7 lead early in the
second half following back-to-back goals
from Angela Dixon and Lauren Fischer
and later held a 10-8 lead to match its
largest advantage of the game.
Goals from Twist, Burker and fresh
man Sara Bach brought the (Cardinal back
and Burker's fourth goal of the game with
1:32 remaining tied the score at 11-11.

fhe score remained that way for the
rest of regulation. In overtime, which con
sists of two three-minute halves, neither
team could take control of the game.
Node Dame held a 13-12 lead in the
waning minutes of the fii-st overtime and
kx)ked poised to send the home fans home
happy, but with 40 seconds remaining, the
ball and momentum changed hands once
again.
Off a turnover, sophomore Julia Cal
zonetti scored a goal with 18 seconds left
that would send the game into double
overtime.
Notre Dame came out strong in the
second overtime, netting an early goal,
but Stanford freshman Cassie Harvey an
swered just 13 seconds later with a goal of

her own.
"Double overtime is not a thing you
can really prepare for," Uhlfelder said.
Even so, die team maintained its lot us
as the game wore on.
"They wanted to make sure they left
everything out there on the field,"
Uhlfelder said.
And Stanford did.
"The short overtime periods were re;il
ly about draw control," Pantano said.
"Whoever came up with the ball got the
chance to work it in the offensive end and
score."
Notre Dame outshot the Cardinal 30-
26 and won 17 of 30 draws, but in the end,
a resilient Stanford mental game and ball
control paid off.
