# Stanford to ban alcohol at all-freshman dorm events
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The era of Branner keggers and Paloma
progressives is over.
Beginning next year, Stanford's all-fresh
man dorms will no longer be allowed to serve
alcohol at events in their lounges, hallways or
outdoor areas.
The new rule will take the form of an addi
tion to the Alcohol Policy â€” the first such
change since 1997, when the University pro
hibited the spending of dormitory funds on al
cohol.
According to Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, the decision arose from in
creasing concern that the current policy's per
missiveness fosters an unhealthy and disrup

tive "drinking culture" in freshman dorms.
The new clause represents (lie culmination
ofthe annual review of the Alcohol Policy by the
Dean of Students Office, Residential Educa
tion, Vaden Health Promotion, the Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students and the De
partment of Public Safety.
Current residence stall members in fresh
man dorms have already expressed apprehen
sion about the new policy.
"In any area of human behavior, it's tough
to regulate problems away, to change the be
havior of people just by introducing a rule,"
said Cedro Resident Fellow Marcelo Clerici-
Arias. "It is my hope in this case that the im
plementation of the policy will be such that the
disadvantages do not outweigh the possible
advantages."

Junior Nit Kanaan, a resident assistant in
Otero, said he believes the policy will have un
intended negative consequences.
"1 think this new policy will make a kind of
introverted drinking culture that could poten
tially be more dangerous, because it's behind
closed doors and you can't see what's going
on," Kanaan said. "1 think what makes the cur
rent alcohol policy so successful is that you can
throw a party in the dorm lounge, and if some
one gets out of hand, other residents can see
that and help him or her out."
Administrators counter that allowing
drinking in freshman dormitories is illegal,
detracts from efforts to create a safe and com
fortable atmosphere and has failed to prevent
