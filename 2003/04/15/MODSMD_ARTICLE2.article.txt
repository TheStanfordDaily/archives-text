# Stanford to ban alcohol at all-freshman dorm events
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The era of Branner keggers and Paloma
progressives is over.
Beginning next year, Stanford's all-fresh
man dorms will no longer be allowed to serve
alcohol at events in their lounges, hallways or
outdoor areas.
The new rule will take the form of an addi
tion to the Alcohol Policy — the first such
change since 1997, when the University pro
hibited the spending of dormitory funds on al
cohol.
According to Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, the decision arose from in
creasing concern that the current policy's per
missiveness fosters an unhealthy and disrup

tive "drinking culture" in freshman dorms.
The new clause represents (lie culmination
ofthe annual review of the Alcohol Policy by the
Dean of Students Office, Residential Educa
tion, Vaden Health Promotion, the Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students and the De
partment of Public Safety.
Current residence stall members in fresh
man dorms have already expressed apprehen
sion about the new policy.
"In any area of human behavior, it's tough
to regulate problems away, to change the be
havior of people just by introducing a rule,"
said Cedro Resident Fellow Marcelo Clerici-
Arias. "It is my hope in this case that the im
plementation of the policy will be such that the
disadvantages do not outweigh the possible
advantages."

Junior Nit Kanaan, a resident assistant in
Otero, said he believes the policy will have un
intended negative consequences.
"1 think this new policy will make a kind of
introverted drinking culture that could poten
tially be more dangerous, because it's behind
closed doors and you can't see what's going
on," Kanaan said. "1 think what makes the cur
rent alcohol policy so successful is that you can
throw a party in the dorm lounge, and if some
one gets out of hand, other residents can see
that and help him or her out."
Administrators counter that allowing
drinking in freshman dormitories is illegal,
detracts from efforts to create a safe and com
fortable atmosphere and has failed to prevent

serious alcohol-related incidents
among freshmen in recent years.
According to Ralph Castro, al
cohol and drug educator at Vaden
Student I lealth Services, recent
studies on college drinking indi
cate that limiting the availability of
alcohol to students can decrease
the likelihood of alcohol abuse.
"I hear from students that
there's a social pressure to con
sume alcohol," Castro said. "It's
there, so that's what ends up hap
pening."
Asst. Dean and Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe noted
that studies of best practice at other
colleges also influenced (he Uni
versity's decision.
"I think whenever we're look
ing at what kind of community we
want to create, we also look at what
other peer institutions are doing,"
she said. "One of the things we
found is that eight out of 10 cur
rently restrict alcohol in freshman
residences."
But some people fear that the
ban could damage the unique
sense of mutual trust that has his
torically characterized the rela
tionship between freshmen and
RAs at Stanford.
"One possible danger that

happens in other universities is
that the RAs would have to en
force the alcohol policy, changing
in a drastic way the relationship
between them and the residents,"
Clerici-Arias said. "I think the
University at this point, as far as 1
know, doesn't have in mind the
typical role of RAs at other uni
versities."
Said Sundeep Bhat, an RAin
Rinconada, "I would hope that Res
Ed would never put RAs in that
position, because it would under
mine the whole goal of residential
education. 1 think it would also af
fect a lot of people's decision to be
come an RA."
After being briefed on the new
policy at a meeting last week, some
RFs decided to inform RA appli
cants of the changes. Two current
RAs who asked not to be identified
said that they would not want to
work in a freshman dorm under
the new rule.
Camarillo said she does not
foresee a substantial shift in the
role of freshman RAs.
"We have some houses now that
have this same policy, and yet [the
RAs] don't feel that their role as an
adviser, mentor or educator is
compromised," Camarillo said.
"In other cases, we have clear
policies that the RAs have no prob
lem enforcing, like smoking or
smoking pot," she added. "Resi
dents don't have any problem

[coming forward to voice their
concern], because it impacts their
community, their living space."
While the new policy does not
specify what exactly constitutes a
dorm event, Camarillo said that it
would not require any modifica
tion to the current system of iden
tifying and reporting violations ol
University rules.
"We're not particularly con
cerned with an individual student
walking down the hallway drink
ing a beer," Camarillo said.
"It follows what we currently
have in terms of consequences,"
.she added. "RAs and RFs could say
to residence deans that [they're]
concerned because there's a norm
that someone's not following."
The RI) could then issue a
warning or refer the student to the
Office of Judicial Affairs.
Castro and Camarillo both said
that the new policy will continue in
the tradition of prioritizing educa
tion and safety.
"If you do the education proac
tively in the first few days, that sets
a tone," Camarillo said.
Howe added, "We're trying to
change the mindset that having
fun and partying always have to in
volve alcohol."
Residential Education is meet
ing with all RA applicants to fresh
man dorms today to inform them
of the change in policy and answer
their questions.

Junior Nit Kanaan, a resident assistant in

intended negative consequences.
"1 think this new policy will make a kind of
introverted drinking culture that could poten
tially be more dangerous, because it's behind
closed doors and you can't see what's going
on," Kanaan said. "1 think what makes the cur
rent alcohol policy so successful is that you can
throw a party in the dorm lounge, and if some
one gets out of hand, other residents can see
that and help him or her out."

serious alcohol-related incidents
among freshmen in recent years.
According to Ralph Castro, al
cohol and drug educator at Vaden
Student I lealth Services, recent
studies on college drinking indi
cate that limiting the availability of
alcohol to students can decrease
the likelihood of alcohol abuse.
"I hear from students that
there's a social pressure to con
sume alcohol," Castro said. "It's
there, so that's what ends up hap
pening."
Asst. Dean and Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe noted
that studies of best practice at other
colleges also influenced (he Uni
versity's decision.
"I think whenever we're look
ing at what kind of community we
want to create, we also look at what
other peer institutions are doing,"
she said. "One of the things we
found is that eight out of 10 cur
rently restrict alcohol in freshman
residences."
But some people fear that the
ban could damage the unique
sense of mutual trust that has his
torically characterized the rela
tionship between freshmen and
RAs at Stanford.
"One possible danger that

happens in other universities is
that the RAs would have to en
force the alcohol policy, changing
in a drastic way the relationship
between them and the residents,"
Clerici-Arias said. "I think the
University at this point, as far as 1
know, doesn't have in mind the
typical role of RAs at other uni
versities."
Said Sundeep Bhat, an RAin
Rinconada, "I would hope that Res
Ed would never put RAs in that
position, because it would under
mine the whole goal of residential
education. 1 think it would also af
fect a lot of people's decision to be
come an RA."
After being briefed on the new
policy at a meeting last week, some
RFs decided to inform RA appli
cants of the changes. Two current
RAs who asked not to be identified
said that they would not want to
work in a freshman dorm under
the new rule.
Camarillo said she does not
foresee a substantial shift in the
role of freshman RAs.
"We have some houses now that
have this same policy, and yet [the
RAs] don't feel that their role as an
adviser, mentor or educator is
compromised," Camarillo said.
"In other cases, we have clear
policies that the RAs have no prob
lem enforcing, like smoking or
smoking pot," she added. "Resi
dents don't have any problem

[coming forward to voice their
concern], because it impacts their
community, their living space."
While the new policy does not
specify what exactly constitutes a
dorm event, Camarillo said that it
would not require any modifica
tion to the current system of iden
tifying and reporting violations ol
University rules.
"We're not particularly con
cerned with an individual student
walking down the hallway drink
ing a beer," Camarillo said.
"It follows what we currently
have in terms of consequences,"
.she added. "RAs and RFs could say
to residence deans that [they're]
concerned because there's a norm
that someone's not following."
The RI) could then issue a
warning or refer the student to the
Office of Judicial Affairs.
Castro and Camarillo both said
that the new policy will continue in
the tradition of prioritizing educa
tion and safety.
"If you do the education proac
tively in the first few days, that sets
a tone," Camarillo said.
Howe added, "We're trying to
change the mindset that having
fun and partying always have to in
volve alcohol."
Residential Education is meet
ing with all RA applicants to fresh
man dorms today to inform them
of the change in policy and answer
their questions.

South, being the first black female federal surgeon general and offered her views on major health issues of today.
The era of Branner keggers and Paloma
progressives is over.
Beginning next year, Stanford's all-fresh
man dorms will no longer be allowed to serve
alcohol at events in their lounges, hallways or
outdoor areas.
The new rule will take the form of an addi
tion to the Alcohol Policy — the first such
change since 1997, when the University pro
hibited the spending of dormitory funds on al
cohol.
According to Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo, the decision arose from in
creasing concern that the current policy's per
missiveness fosters an unhealthy and disrup

tive "drinking culture" in freshman dorms.
The new clause represents (lie culmination
ofthe annual review of the Alcohol Policy by the
Dean of Students Office, Residential Educa
tion, Vaden Health Promotion, the Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students and the De
partment of Public Safety.
Current residence stall members in fresh
man dorms have already expressed apprehen
sion about the new policy.
"In any area of human behavior, it's tough
to regulate problems away, to change the be
havior of people just by introducing a rule,"
said Cedro Resident Fellow Marcelo Clerici-
Arias. "It is my hope in this case that the im
plementation of the policy will be such that the
disadvantages do not outweigh the possible
advantages."

Junior Nit Kanaan, a resident assistant in
Otero, said he believes the policy will have un
intended negative consequences.

tially be more dangerous, because it's behind
