# Softball tames Wildcats, splits with Devils

### LEE INSINGA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 16 Cardinal softball
team (32-15, 4-5 Pacific-10 Con
ference) entered its weekend road
swing against the Arizona schools
facing the prospect that these
games would go a long way to
ward determining the fate of this
team's season.
Stanford served notice, howev

er, that this is a team to be reck
oned with in the Pac-10 and on the
national scene.
On the road against the No.
12 Sun Devils (28-13, 5-4), and
the top-ranked Wildcats (39-4, 8-
1), it certainly would not have
been unimaginable for the Car
dinal to drop all three games and
shoulder themselves with seven
early Pac-10 losses. But the Car
dinal handed Arizona its only

conference defeat to date on Fri
day before splitting with Arizona
State, losing Saturday and win
ning Sunday.
"It was a good weekend for us
when we needed a good week
end," coach John Rittman said.
If one needs any more convinc
ing of the quality of these wins,
No. 6 California followed the Car
dinal into the desert this weekend
and emerged winless.
The weekend began with a dra
matic 4-3 victory over Arizona in a
matchup of two of the best pitch
ers in the NCAA: Arizona's Alicia
Hollowell (25-3) and Stanford ju
nior Dana Sorensen (15-5). The
victory gave Stanford only its third
all-time win against Arizona.
Stanford's bats were hot right
out of the gates. The Cardinal
pounded out three runs on six hits
in the first two innings, but the
Wildcats' pitchers would settle
down, allowingjust two more hits
over the final five.
Freshman Catalina Morris put
the Cardinal on the board right
away with a leadoff home run to
center field off Hollowell. Fresh
man Lauren Lappin and senior
Cassi Brangham followed Morris'
home run with back-to-back sin
gles that left Lappin on third base.
Junior Elizabeth Bendig dou
bled to bring Lappin home and
push the score to 2-0.
Morris came up again in the
second inning and produced the
same result, blasting another solo
home run off of Hollowell.
"Catalina's been doing a good
job in the leadoff spot," Rittman
said. "[She and Lappin] set up a
lot of offense for us."
Senior Maureen LeCocq also
embraced the long-ball to post the
Cardinal's fourth and final run of
the day in the sixth inning.
On the defensive side of the di
amond, high tension was the story
of the day for Stanford. The Wild
cats left at least one runner on base
in every inning, stranding two
runners four times.
Junior Dana Sorensen unchar
acteristically walked six batters,
but overcame her wildness with
her ability to reach back fora key
strikeout, collecting 12 in all. On
four occasions Sorensen stranded

a Wildcat in scoring position by
recording the third out on strikes.
It was a truly gutsy perfor
mance by Sorensen that saw 15
baserunners result in only three
runs for Arizona.
The most dramatic shutdown
of the Wildcat attack came in the
bottom of the seventh.
The Wildcats narrowed the
game's margin to 4-3 with a lead
off home run by shortstop Lovie
Jung. Sorensen fanned third base
man Jackie Coburn, but then al
lowed a walk and a double that left
the winning run in scoring posi
tion with just one out.
To keep the Wildcats from
pulling even, the Cardinal would
have to retire both second base
man Lisha Ribiella and first base
man Shelly Schultz, each of whom
had reached base twice against
Sorensen already. Sorensen calm
ly hauled in a line drive by Ribiel
la and got Schultz to pop up to
Bendig to seal the victory.
Stanford's second game of the
weekend, a 2-1 loss to Arizona
State, was a far less offensive affair.
The Cardinal managed just three
hits off of the Sun Devils Desiree
Serrano, and thanks to hitting into
two double plays, left no one on
base.
The only Cardinal run of the
day came in the third when
LeCocq homered for the second
time in as many days.
Senior Tori Nyberg (13-7) ab
sorbed the loss and saw a strong
pitching performance wasted.
Nyberg allowed just four
baserunners in 4 2/3 innings of
work. Freshman Laura Severson
closed out the final inning and a
third.
Sunday's matchup against
ASU, a 4-1 victory, was just anoth
er opportunity for Dana Sorensen
to baffle the opposing team's hit
ters.
Far more dominant than she
had been Friday evening,
Sorensen allowed just two hits and
one walk to the Sun Devils in fi 2/3
innings of work.
Morris and Sophomore Leah
Nelson continued Stanford's slug
ging with a two-run and solo shot,
respectively.
The weekend leaves the Cardi
nal more than halfway to last
year's total of seven I'ac-lO wins.
"We regained some confidence
this weekend," Rittman said. "We
know we're a good team and if we
play all facets of the game we're a
tough team to beat."

same result, blasting another solo
home run off of Hollowell.
"Catalina's been doing a good
job in the leadoff spot," Rittman
said. "[She and Lappin] set up a
lot of offense for us."
Senior Maureen LeCocq also
embraced the long-ball to post the
Cardinal's fourth and final run of
the day in the sixth inning.
On the defensive side of the di
amond, high tension was the story
of the day for Stanford. The Wild
cats left at least one runner on base
in every inning, stranding two
runners four times.
Junior Dana Sorensen unchar
acteristically walked six batters,
but overcame her wildness with
her ability to reach back fora key
strikeout, collecting 12 in all. On
four occasions Sorensen stranded

a Wildcat in scoring position by
recording the third out on strikes.
It was a truly gutsy perfor
mance by Sorensen that saw 15
baserunners result in only three
runs for Arizona.
The most dramatic shutdown
of the Wildcat attack came in the
bottom of the seventh.
The Wildcats narrowed the
game's margin to 4-3 with a lead
off home run by shortstop Lovie
Jung. Sorensen fanned third base
man Jackie Coburn, but then al
lowed a walk and a double that left
the winning run in scoring posi
tion with just one out.
To keep the Wildcats from
pulling even, the Cardinal would
have to retire both second base
man Lisha Ribiella and first base
man Shelly Schultz, each of whom
had reached base twice against
Sorensen already. Sorensen calm
ly hauled in a line drive by Ribiel
la and got Schultz to pop up to
Bendig to seal the victory.
Stanford's second game of the
weekend, a 2-1 loss to Arizona
State, was a far less offensive affair.
The Cardinal managed just three
hits off of the Sun Devils Desiree
Serrano, and thanks to hitting into
two double plays, left no one on
base.
The only Cardinal run of the
day came in the third when
LeCocq homered for the second
time in as many days.
Senior Tori Nyberg (13-7) ab
sorbed the loss and saw a strong
pitching performance wasted.
Nyberg allowed just four
baserunners in 4 2/3 innings of
work. Freshman Laura Severson
closed out the final inning and a
third.
Sunday's matchup against
ASU, a 4-1 victory, was just anoth
er opportunity for Dana Sorensen
to baffle the opposing team's hit
ters.
Far more dominant than she
had been Friday evening,
Sorensen allowed just two hits and
one walk to the Sun Devils in fi 2/3
innings of work.
Morris and Sophomore Leah
Nelson continued Stanford's slug
ging with a two-run and solo shot,
respectively.
The weekend leaves the Cardi
nal more than halfway to last
year's total of seven I'ac-lO wins.
"We regained some confidence
this weekend," Rittman said. "We
know we're a good team and if we
play all facets of the game we're a
tough team to beat."

Junior pitcher Dana Sorensen overcame control problems and worked out
of several jams by striking out 12 Wildcats in Stanford's upset of No. 1 Ari
zona in Tucson on Friday. The Cardinal split two games with Arizona State,
The No. 16 Cardinal softball
team (32-15, 4-5 Pacific-10 Con
ference) entered its weekend road
swing against the Arizona schools
facing the prospect that these
games would go a long way to
ward determining the fate of this
team's season.
Stanford served notice, howev

er, that this is a team to be reck
oned with in the Pac-10 and on the
national scene.
On the road against the No.
12 Sun Devils (28-13, 5-4), and
the top-ranked Wildcats (39-4, 8-
1), it certainly would not have
been unimaginable for the Car
dinal to drop all three games and
shoulder themselves with seven
early Pac-10 losses. But the Car
dinal handed Arizona its only

conference defeat to date on Fri
day before splitting with Arizona
State, losing Saturday and win
ning Sunday.
"It was a good weekend for us
when we needed a good week
end," coach John Rittman said.
If one needs any more convinc
ing of the quality of these wins,
No. 6 California followed the Car
dinal into the desert this weekend
and emerged winless.
The weekend began with a dra
matic 4-3 victory over Arizona in a
matchup of two of the best pitch
ers in the NCAA: Arizona's Alicia
Hollowell (25-3) and Stanford ju
nior Dana Sorensen (15-5). The
victory gave Stanford only its third
all-time win against Arizona.
Stanford's bats were hot right
out of the gates. The Cardinal
pounded out three runs on six hits
in the first two innings, but the
Wildcats' pitchers would settle
down, allowingjust two more hits
over the final five.
Freshman Catalina Morris put
the Cardinal on the board right
away with a leadoff home run to
center field off Hollowell. Fresh
man Lauren Lappin and senior
Cassi Brangham followed Morris'
home run with back-to-back sin
gles that left Lappin on third base.
Junior Elizabeth Bendig dou
bled to bring Lappin home and
push the score to 2-0.
Morris came up again in the
second inning and produced the
same result, blasting another solo
home run off of Hollowell.

job in the leadoff spot," Rittman
said. "[She and Lappin] set up a
