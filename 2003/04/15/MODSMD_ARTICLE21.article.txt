# What not to look for in the playoffs
## 
### 
I've made many predictions in my years of writing
this column, and 1 am proud to say that I have a
perfect record. Never once has my precognitive
ability failed to produce the consistent results
that you the reader have come to expect from your
Stanford Daily Sports Department. So as it stands now,
amazingly, each and every one of my sports related
predictions has failed to come true.
But this time I came close. I came oh so close. When

everyone else in the country was giv
ing the Dallas Mavericks about as
much chance as 50 Cent at a Missis
sippi gun range, I told you many
months ago that you would all be
wearing Lederhosen and singing the
praises of Mavs forward Dirk Nowitz
ki. No, you probably didn't wear
Lederhosen, and you may harbor
only lukewarm feelings at best toward

my boy Dirk, but nevertheless, the Mavs had the best
record in the NBA from the season's opening tip, and
I was looking pretty damn smart.
Had. It's such a sad word, sitting there in its loneli
ness, representing all that used to be but no longer is.
Had. It connotes such a sense of longing and nostal
gia for those glorious days of yore, or even yesteryear,
as the case may be. Had. They had the best record in
the NBA. Until these last three games. All my hopes
and dreams, my hapless attempt to predict the future,
dashed by an 11 -game San Antonio win streak coupled
with a pulled hamstring on the leg of Mavs guard
Michael Finley.
So now as I stare at the NBA standings in wretched
disbelief, I am confronted with the terrible reality un
folding before my eyes that could see the Mavs slip into
the No. 3 seed behind the Spurs and those oh-so-ugly
Kings, with a possible first-round playoff matchup

with the Lakers looming ever-so
large.
Man did the Lakers pick an
awful time to realize that they
don't suck — dismantling the Fin
ley-less Mavs twice in five days and
very nearly climbing up into the
home court echelon of the West
ern Conference playoffs. 1 have to
admit to you, clear readers, that
I'm scared. 1 don't like it, I'm not
proud of it, but I'm scared. I'm
scared of what will happen if I en
dure a season of such hope and
promise, only to be crushed by an
other Laker championship. I'm
scared that an historic 14-0 start
w ill only lead Dallas to a first round
playoff exit. I'm scared. Hold me.
There are only a few games left
in the regular season, and the
Mavericks still have a chance to re
deem themselves (and me) and
climb back into that top spot. This
year more than ever, that No. 1
seed is an item to be coveted, as its
occupant will most likely get to lace

the Suns in the first round fol
lowed by the Timberwolves or
Blazers in the second. But with
each team still jockeying hard for
playoff positioning, determining
the matchups at this point is an im
possible task. And this time, 1
won't even bother to offer a pre
diction, because we both know that
I'll inevitably be wrong.
Instead, I will offer predictions
on things that will not happen in
the NBA playoffs. And you can
take these to the bank:
1) The Rockets, despite their
promising start, will not be able to
pull off a miracle comeback and
get back into the playoff picture.
This will actually be a good thing
for the franchise, however, be
cause one more solid draft pick
could be the key to unlocking a
budding dynasty in Houston. Or
failing that, perhaps the Rockets
could draft a 7-foot-6 Taiwanese
player, and we could watch he and
Yao play together in the most
ridiculous-looking duo since A1
Sharpton and [insert running
mate here].
2) The Cleveland Cavaliers, de
spite all signs pointing to the con

trary, will not be viciously shot as
part of the Verizon Wireless Half
lime Execution Extravaganza dur
ing game six of the Eastern Con
ference Finals. The Eos Angeles
Clippers, on the other hand ...
stay tuned.
3) Never once during the entire
playoffs will you hear an N BA ana
lyst give any Eastern Conference
team even a remote chance of win
ning a title.
4) Never once during the entire
playoffs will you hear NBA analyst
Bill Walton utter anything close to
a rational thought.
5) And finally, there will never
be more anticipation for the NBA
draft lottery than this year's draw
ing of lots to see which lucky team
gets the right to pay Leßron James
ridonkulous amounts of money to
make their team not suck. Maybe
we should go ahead and execute
the Cavaliers after all.

Ryan Stewart is a senior majoring in
economics, and he still holds true to his
preseason biases that the Mavs will
walk away with this year's champi
onship. He can he reached at
