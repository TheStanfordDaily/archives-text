# What not to look for in the playoffs
## 
### 
I've made many predictions in my years of writing
this column, and 1 am proud to say that I have a
perfect record. Never once has my precognitive
ability failed to produce the consistent results
that you the reader have come to expect from your
Stanford Daily Sports Department. So as it stands now,
amazingly, each and every one of my sports related
predictions has failed to come true.
But this time I came close. I came oh so close. When

everyone else in the country was giv
ing the Dallas Mavericks about as
much chance as 50 Cent at a Missis
sippi gun range, I told you many
months ago that you would all be
wearing Lederhosen and singing the
praises of Mavs forward Dirk Nowitz
ki. No, you probably didn't wear
Lederhosen, and you may harbor
only lukewarm feelings at best toward

my boy Dirk, but nevertheless, the Mavs had the best
record in the NBA from the season's opening tip, and
I was looking pretty damn smart.
Had. It's such a sad word, sitting there in its loneli
ness, representing all that used to be but no longer is.
Had. It connotes such a sense of longing and nostal
gia for those glorious days of yore, or even yesteryear,
as the case may be. Had. They had the best record in
the NBA. Until these last three games. All my hopes
and dreams, my hapless attempt to predict the future,
dashed by an 11 -game San Antonio win streak coupled
with a pulled hamstring on the leg of Mavs guard
Michael Finley.
So now as I stare at the NBA standings in wretched
disbelief, I am confronted with the terrible reality un
folding before my eyes that could see the Mavs slip into
the No. 3 seed behind the Spurs and those oh-so-ugly
Kings, with a possible first-round playoff matchup
