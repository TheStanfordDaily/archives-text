## 
### RICO ANDRADE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team concluded its season this
weekend with three additional
All-American honors and an
eighth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships.
Starting the competition on
the pommel horse, the Cardinal
counted only two hit routines en
route to a final score of 212.325.
With a fourth-place finish in its
preliminary round, the team was

unable to advance to team finals
on Friday.
"We started flat on the first
event," coach Thom Glielmi said.
"We just weren't able to pick it up
after that."
The team's lack of depth gave
it a very small margin of error to
qualify for the second round.
"I saw some good sets," Glielmi
said. "But we didn't hit all of our
top routines."
Six team members did qualify

Sophomore Kelly Lang was one of six Cardinal gymnasts to advance to the
second day of competition at the NCAA Championships in Philadelphis this
weekend. The Cardinal finished eighth-place as a team.
as individuals for the second day
of competition. Advancing were
freshman Sean Doolan on floor,
sophomore Kelly Lang on paral
lel bars, senior Cade Raggio on
vault and high-bar, senior Matt
McLean on floor and high-bar
and senior Marshall Erwin on
pommel horse and rings.
By hitting the biggest vault of
the preliminary round with a
score of 9.65, junior Dan Gill
qualified to compete in the all
around finals, getting a second
chance on every event to try to
qualify to event finals.
On the second day of competi
tion, Ciill finished eighth in the all
around, garnering his first All-
American honor of the weekend.
He also finished first on floor
and third on vault, qualifying for
the finals on those events in the
process.
With a first-place finish on the
rings in the second round, Erwin
also qualified to rings finals.

In event finals, Gill was unable
to defend his 2002 NCAA title on
the vault, finishing in fourth and
garnering his second Ail-Ameri
can honor of the weekend. He
also finished eighth in the floor
exercise.
Erwin, undefeated on the still
rings all season, hit his best rou
tine of the season but was unable
to defend his NCAA title, placing
second by .012 points to Penn
State's Kevin Tan. It was Erwin's
third Ail-American honor on the
event.
"Marshall did a great routine,"
Glielmi said. "It could have gone
either way."
The small team exceeded
all preseason expectations.
Losing five members from last
year's Super-Six squad, the
team was ranked as high as
No. 4 this season and beat
rival California for the first
time in three seasons. This
season they lose Erwin, Rag
gio, McLean and Paul O'Leary
but expect to fill some of the
void left by those seniors with
a large incoming freshman
class.
