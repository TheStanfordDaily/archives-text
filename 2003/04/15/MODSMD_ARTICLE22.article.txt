The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team concluded its season this
weekend with three additional
All-American honors and an
eighth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships.
Starting the competition on
the pommel horse, the Cardinal
counted only two hit routines en
route to a final score of 212.325.
With a fourth-place finish in its
preliminary round, the team was

unable to advance to team finals
on Friday.
"We started flat on the first
event," coach Thom Glielmi said.
"We just weren't able to pick it up
after that."
The team's lack of depth gave
it a very small margin of error to
qualify for the second round.
"I saw some good sets," Glielmi
said. "But we didn't hit all of our
top routines."
Six team members did qualify
