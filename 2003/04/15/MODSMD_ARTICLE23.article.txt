11k* rain over die weekend can
celed the lirutus I laniilton Invita
tional at C ];d, but the small group of
Stanford I rack and field athletes at the
California-Nevada Championships
in San Diego posted some big marks.
Junior Jillian Cainarena contin
ued her impressive season in the
shot put, throwing 55 feet, 3.50
inches for the win.
Camarena followed her shotput
performance with a season-best of
165-8 in the discus, which was good
enough for third place.
"Jill can be an Olympian and an
NCAA champion," said Robert
Weir, an assistant coach for the
throwing events. "Jill is talented,

coachable, and competitive. She
works hard in the weight room, and
she wants to be one of the best."
i\lso in the discus, juniors Molly
Meyer and Kitty Currier finished
fourth and sixth with throws of
1 6 1 -0 and 153-1, respectively.
Freshman Sainantha Shepard
set the Stanford freshman pole
vault record by clearing 13-0.75.
She finished second in San I)iego to
UCIA's freshman pole vault star,
Chelsea Johnson.
Senior Kathleen Donoghue fin
ished fourth by clearing 12-2.75,
and junior Leila Ben-Youssef fin
ished seventh with a height of 11-9.
In the hammer toss, sophomore
Danielle Coolie h finished eighth
with a season-best 173-9 while
freshman Sarah I lopping was 13th

with a throw of 161-10.
The Cardinal had just two men
at the Cal-Nevada Championships,
but still got a win from junior An
drew Hill in the 5,000. Hill's time
was 14 minutes, 37.50 seconds.
Redshirt freshman Russ Martin
also competed in the 5,000, finish
ing 15th m 15:12.02.
The squad now prepares itself
for the Mt. San Antonio College
Relays this coming weekend.
A few of the Cardinal's top dis
tance runners are expected to debut
this weekend, including redshirt
freshman Alicia Craig, as well as the
defending outdoor 5,000 champi
on, senior Lauren Fleshman.
1 he men's squad also fields six ath
letes who have run sub-14 minutes in
the 5,000 meter and are running die

event for the first time this season.
They, as well as many other
Stanford athletes, will be attempt
ing to qualify f<>r the West Region
al and NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships in May and June.
"The distance runners are basi
cally on the same schedule as previ
ous years," said director of track
and field Vin Lananna. "But we are
being more judicious this year
about who competes when because
it is a longer season and a world
championship year.
"In many cases, the regional
standards are low enough that our
top athletes will be able to hit them
with one race or throw. So, we are
waiting as long as we can with some
of them before triggering a year of
eligibility, just to be sure."
