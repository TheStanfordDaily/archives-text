# INS prevents alum from U.S. re-entry
## 
### SAMEER AHMED SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Imagine leaving the country for
spring break, with one quarter left
to graduate, and then being prohib
ited by the U.S. government from
returning to school to finish your
degree and see your friends and
family.
I hat is what has happened to
Yahya Jalil, a 199(i Stanford gradu
ate from Pakistan now at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School of Business. On March 12,
when Jalil was returning from a
spring break trip to London, INS

agents at Newark airport barred his
entry to the United States, eminent
ly in Pakistan, Jalii is working with
government officials to let him come
back to the United States to finish his
MBA.
Jalil was not allowed to enter the
country because he didn't register
with the INS at Newark on March 8,
the day he departed for London.
The departure registration is one of
many INS requirements initiated
after Sept. 11 to track visitors from
25 predominantly Arab and Muslim
countries. Under the law, first en-
forced in December 2(X)2, these visi
tors must have INS approval before
entering or leaving the country,
moving residences, buying a house
and switchingjobs.
According to Jalil, his failure to
register upon departure was purely
accidental.
"When I checked in at the air
poit, 1 asked the airline [United] if,
as a Pakistani passport holder, there
was a requirement other than sub
mitting my 1-1)4 [visa form] to the air
line," lie said. "They said that there
was no other requirement."
Jalil had already registered with
the INS twice before â€” on Jan. lOin
Newark and on Feb. 11 in Philadel
phia. At both meetings, neither of
the INS agents informed him of the
departure registration, Jalil said.
In order to re-enter the United
States, Jalil needs to be issued a new
visa. The U.S. Consulate in Islam
abad told him the process could take
at least three months, well afterjalil's
May graduation date from Whar
ton.
"Since special registration is veiy
new, there are apparently no rules
yet as to how a 'waiver' can be ob
tained in cases like mine where
someone unwittingly [doesn't] regis
ter despite best intentions," Jalil said.

"The INS and the Suite Department
are still working on developing a law
or procedure under which people
like myself can be allowed re-entry.
Until such a procedure is decided
upon by law, the issuance of a visa
cannot occur."
.Although he is thousands of miles
away from school, Jalil has received a
lot of support from the student Ixnly
and administration at UPenn.
As scx>n as he learned about Jalil's
situation, Jeremy Korst, chair of
Penn's Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly, started an online
petition to help Jalil return to the
United States as scxin as possible.
Over 2,200 people have already
signed the petition.
"Yahya is truly a gem ofa human
lx?ing. He is easily one of the smartest
people at Wharton, not to mention
that he is also one of the most per
sonable, humble and caring," Korst
said. "When I learned what had hap
pened to Yahya, [GAPSA] immedi
ately jumped into action."
Korst has also contacted Sena
tors Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and Rick
Santorum (R-Pa.) and has started a
letter-writing campaign. Last
week, letters from Penn President
Judith Ronin, Wharton Dean
Patrick Marker, and a dozen of
Jalil's friends were sent to the U.S.
ambassador to Pakistan, Sens. San
torum and Specter, Secretary of
Homeland Security Tom Ridge,
Secretary of Health and Human

Senices Tommy Thompson and
the INS.
The Penn administration has also
been helping out with Jalil's legal
case and academic situation.
"In addition to remaining in
touch with him, my office has pro
vided Yahya with new immigration
documents, referred him to legal
counsel and been in touch with a
local immigration attorney to con
sult about his situation," said Shalini
Bhutani, the Office of International
Programs' director of international
student and scholar services. "Whar
ton's academic advising office has
also l)een in e-mail contact with
Yahya about his academic options."
"Wharton has !>een helping me
make progress toward my degree
even in absentia by allowing me to
submit homework via e-mail and, in
some cases, take midterms remote
ly," [alii added.
J alii, 29, came to Lhe United States
in 1992 as a freshman at Stanford.
Before entering Wharton, he was an
assistant vice president at General
Electric's venture capital fund.
Jalil hopes he can return to the
United States to finish his degree,
start working and reunite with his
wife, who has been pursuing Jalil's
case actively with the Pakistani Em
bassy in Washington, DC.
"From a personal viewpoint, it
has been a very difficult and emo
tionally draining experience," Jalil
said.
