# Darrell Hammond of SNL to entertain
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
"Saturday Night Live" star Dar
rell Hammond will be speaking
tonight at 8 p.m. in Kresge Audito
rium, and although his presenta
tion may have a political theme, or
ganizers say students can expect a
night of raw entertainment and lots
of laughs.
After eight years in the SN Least,
1 lammond has gained notoriety as
a champion impersonator, earning
acclaim from critics for both the ac
curacy and variety of his impres
sions. After playing Bill Clinton lot

much of the 19905, Hammond has
now turned to the Bush adminis
tration, mimicking everyone from
Vice President Dick Cheney to At
torney General John Ashcroft.
He has also gained recognition
for his portrayals of Jesse Jackson,
Ted Koppel, Geraldo Rivera and,
on Celebrity Jeopardy, Sean Con
nery. Currently, Hammond travels
as a stand-up comedian through
out the nation and often appears on
popular late-night TV shows in ad
dition to SNL.
The event, sponsored by the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau, shows the
organization's focus on bringing to
campus a diverse mix of speakers
across different areas of interest
and expertise, said Justin Wilson,
the bureau's director.
"In recent years we've brought
politicians, acclaimed authors and
film makers, world leaders and
other celebrities, and we thought a
comedian and prominent enter
tainer would add to that diversity,"
Wilson said. "Darrell Hammond
was one of the funniest people we
could think of."
Wilson said that many of the stu
dents that he has talked to have al
ready expressed their enthusiasm,
and he is fairly certain that Kresge
will be a full house tonight, mean

ing that students should arrive
early if they hope to get a good seat.
"Mr. Hammond will be per
forming an hour-long stand-up
routine, so it's kind of a departure
from our normal format of a lecture
followed by Q&A," Wilson said.
"We really just hope to have an
evening of laughter and fun with
this one. Why drop $30 on a come
dy club in San Francisco when you
can come to Kresge for free and
spend an hour with one of the fun
niest comedians around?"
According to the bureau's hospi
tality officer, Kate Brubacher,
Hammond will be arriving Tues
day and leaving Wednesday.
"Hammond will be speaking
for entertainment value, although
there are certain to be political
overtones in such a time,"
Brubacher said. "The Speaker's
Bureau seeks to bring a balanced
slate of speakers [including] those

in the non-political arena who we
think will be appealing to the stu
dent body."
Usually, the Speaker's Bureau
co-sponsors speaker events with
other campus groups. Last
Wednesday, former Attorney Gen
eral Janet Reno spoke at Kresge in
an event co-sponsored by the
Speaker's Bureau in conjunction
with the Class 0f2004, the Office of
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs,
the Stanford Pre-Law Society and
other University organizations.
"I have seen some of Ham
mond's stand up on television, and
I like it — how he presents himself,
the way he frames his quips and
comments, it makes me laugh," said
freshman Lindsay Mecca, who
plans to attend the show. "1 have
watched him impersonate our
presidents and others in skits on
SNL, and 1 think he is talented and,
for the most part, very amusing."
