### CORINA YEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Former U.S. Surgeon Cieneral Joycelyn Elders spoke
about her life and her work in public health to a full
house at Kresge Auditorium last night in the first Auro
ra Forum of the quarter.
The talk, entitled "Jocelyn Elders: From Sharecrop
per's Daughter to Surgeon Cieneral," was an interview
style discussion between Elders and LaDoris Cor dell,
vice provost for campus relations and special counselor
to the president.
Cordell described Elders as "the rare public figure
that has had, and continues to have, the courage of [her]
convictions 24 / 7,365 days a year."
Elders criticized the U.S. health care system during
the discussion, citing the lack of universal access to health
care and to comprehensive health education.
"We do not have a health-care system," Elders said.
"We have a very expensive sick-care system. The sicker
you are the better we doctor you. The only people in
America with universal access to health care are crimi
nals in (lie criminal justice system and I think ii makes no
sense.
"We also do not educate our people to be healthy,"
Elders said. "We are a health-illiterate society."
Elders, born in Arkansas in 1933, grew up in a shack
as part of a large sharecropping family. At the age of 15,
she entered Philander Smith College in Little Rock
Arkansas. After time in the army, she earned her med
ical degree and later her master's in biochemistry from
the University of Arkansas.
Elders was appointed the director of public health by
former Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and for six years
was a "lightning rod for public health," as described by

Cordell.
In 1993, Clinton nominated El
ders for the position of surgeon gen
eral, and she became the first
African-American U.S. surgeon
general. During her time, she gave
302 speeches. ()ne mishap she men
tioned was when she lost the speech
she was planning to give at a Har
vard commencement and had to
scribble out some notes fora new
one on a scrap of toilet paper in the
bathroom.
One of her more controversial
remarks was at the National Press
Club when she made a statement
about the legalization of drugs.
"There have been multiple stud
ies that have shown that the legaliza
tion of drugs would lower the crime
rate, but I do not know all the impli
cations of this," Elders said when re

counting the incident at the forum.
"I feel it should be studied."
After 15 months she was forced
to resign amidst controversy stem
ming from a remark she made at an
AIDS conference that allegedly en
dorsed courses to teach how to mas
turbate. She specifically said mastur
bation "is part of human sexuality
and it's a part of something that per
haps should be taught." Elders
maintained that she meant that chil
dren should be taught about mas
turbation in sex education courses.
She spoke about the incident
with a sense of humor. "[Masturba
tion) never got anybody pregnant,"
she said, "and you know you're al
ways having sex with somebody you
love."
Elders said that she had no re
grets about her time as surgeon gen
eral.
"I would do it again," she said.
"In fact, I absolutely did this job as I
felt it should be done. If I had to do
it all over again, I'd do it exactly the

same way.
"I want you to know that I always
did the very best that I could do as
your surgeon general," she added.
Despite the fact that Clinton
called for her resignation, Elders
said that she harbors no harsh feel
ings for him.
"I think Bill Clinton is probably
the smartest person that I've met,
and 1 feel certain that he's the best
politician this country has seen in a
long time."
After her resignation, Elders re
turned to the College of Public
Health of the University of Arkansas
for Medical Sciences as a professor
of pediatrics.
