Former U.S. Surgeon Cieneral Joycelyn Elders spoke
about her life and her work in public health to a full
house at Kresge Auditorium last night in the first Auro
ra Forum of the quarter.
The talk, entitled "Jocelyn Elders: From Sharecrop
per's Daughter to Surgeon Cieneral," was an interview
style discussion between Elders and LaDoris Cor dell,
vice provost for campus relations and special counselor
to the president.
Cordell described Elders as "the rare public figure
that has had, and continues to have, the courage of [her]
convictions 24 / 7,365 days a year."
Elders criticized the U.S. health care system during
the discussion, citing the lack of universal access to health
care and to comprehensive health education.
"We do not have a health-care system," Elders said.
"We have a very expensive sick-care system. The sicker
you are the better we doctor you. The only people in
America with universal access to health care are crimi
nals in (lie criminal justice system and I think ii makes no
sense.
"We also do not educate our people to be healthy,"
Elders said. "We are a health-illiterate society."
Elders, born in Arkansas in 1933, grew up in a shack
as part of a large sharecropping family. At the age of 15,
she entered Philander Smith College in Little Rock
Arkansas. After time in the army, she earned her med
ical degree and later her master's in biochemistry from
the University of Arkansas.
Elders was appointed the director of public health by
former Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and for six years
was a "lightning rod for public health," as described by
