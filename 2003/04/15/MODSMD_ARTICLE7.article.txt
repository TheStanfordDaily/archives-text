# Feminists critique past, present Catholic Church
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ida Raming is in love with God
but in conflict with the Roman
Catholic religion.
The renowned feminist the
ologian and religious activist led a
panel discussion on women in the
Catholic Church yesterday in
Sweet Hall, where she reviewed
her lifelong battle against system
atic sexism in the church, her de
cision to buck the dogmas of the
papacy and become an ordained
priest and her subsequent ex
communication.
The pane! also included Iris
Mueller, another Catholic woman
who had joined Raming in her
(]iiest to become ordained, and Rea
I iowarth from the ('.alholies Speak
Out/Quixote Center, one of the
sponsors of the event.
" There is a long history of dis

crimination in the Church," Rain
ing said. "It reaches back into the
Hebrew Bible and extends beyond
it."
Raming, a native of (iermany, is
widely considered the pioneer of
the women's ordination movement
in the Catholic Church. In 1969
she published her doctoral study
on discrimination against women
in Catholicism.
That study, according to the
Web site of the Catholics Speak Out
/Quixote Center, "conclusively
proved [that] the church's exclu
sion of women from the priesthood
was based upon concepts of the es
sential and ethical inferiority of
women."
It included biblical evidence
gleaned from ancient texts that had
not previously been translated into
English, specifically Hebrew, Latin

and ancient Greek texts. Raining
spent years learning these lan
guages so that she could use prima
ry sources for her research.
Eventually, she reached the con
clusion that the sexism of the
church "does not come from Jesus,
but only tradition."
Raining found that Christian
theologians since the birth of Christ
— from the first followers of Jesus's
twelve disciples to St. Thomas of
Aquinas — promoted the subordi
nate role of women.
After publishing her work about
the past and the progress of the
church, Raining said she came to a
heartbreaking realization: "We
have no future for women in the
church."
But, in the spirit of civil disobe
dience, Raining and six other
Catholic women, including
Mueller, made the decision to enlist
the help of a sympathetic clergy
man and become ordained as
Catholic priests.
For their action, the seven or
dained women received a rare writ
ten excommunication directly
from, in Raming's words "the high
people of the [Catholic] hierarchy."
Rea I lowarth, the third panelist
and a member of the Quixote Cen
ter, summarized the view of the
seven women.
"The law that restricts ordina
tion to baptized males is not legiti
mate because it creates two classes
of baptism," she said.
For change to occur, she added,
the church must witness "hun
dreds of women being ordained
and the people of the church sup
porting them."
After Raining and Mueller fin
ished discussing their history of bat
tling against the Catholic Church,
the panel opened the discussion to
questions from the audience.
One attendee, an assistant pro
fessor at Stanford, questioned the
workings of the modern Catholic
Church.
"I think the Catholic church is a
joke," she said to the panel, citing
recent instances of discrimination
and pedophilia among the ranks of
the clergy. "What do you do with
this archaic thing that doesn't
change?"
Others followed this line of
thought by arguing that Catholi
cism may be outdated and is an un
necessary tag-along from medieval
times.
In response to these arguments,
Raining noted, "The Catholic
Church has inlluence in the whole
world. Because it has such influ
ence, it must be changed, otherwise
it is a bad thing for all who are in it."
She ended the discussion with a
call to action directed at all
Catholics.
"We have argued for more than
40 years," she said. "Now we are
done. Now we are acting."
