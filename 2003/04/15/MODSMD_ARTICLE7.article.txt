### BARRETT SHERIDAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ida Raming is in love with God
but in conflict with the Roman
Catholic religion.
The renowned feminist the
ologian and religious activist led a
panel discussion on women in the
Catholic Church yesterday in
Sweet Hall, where she reviewed
her lifelong battle against system
atic sexism in the church, her de
cision to buck the dogmas of the
papacy and become an ordained
priest and her subsequent ex
communication.
The pane! also included Iris
Mueller, another Catholic woman
who had joined Raming in her
(]iiest to become ordained, and Rea
I iowarth from the ('.alholies Speak
Out/Quixote Center, one of the
sponsors of the event.
" There is a long history of dis

crimination in the Church," Rain
ing said. "It reaches back into the
Hebrew Bible and extends beyond
it."
Raming, a native of (iermany, is
widely considered the pioneer of
the women's ordination movement
in the Catholic Church. In 1969
she published her doctoral study
on discrimination against women
in Catholicism.
That study, according to the
Web site of the Catholics Speak Out
/Quixote Center, "conclusively
proved [that] the church's exclu
sion of women from the priesthood
was based upon concepts of the es
sential and ethical inferiority of
women."
It included biblical evidence
gleaned from ancient texts that had
not previously been translated into
English, specifically Hebrew, Latin
