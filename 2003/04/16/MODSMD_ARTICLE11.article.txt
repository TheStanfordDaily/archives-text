## Iraqis meet for gov't talks 
### 
(AP) — Iraqis met under American auspices
to shape a new government yesterday and said
"the rule oflaw must be paramount" following
Saddam Hussein's fall. In a war dividend, U.S.
officials said they had taken Palestinian terror
ist Abul Abbas into custody in Baghdad.
Four weeks after U.S.-led forces unleashed
their assault, President Bush promised to "lib
erate every corner" of Iraq and American
troops hastened to redeem his pledge. Marines
solidified their grip on likrit, Saddam's home
town, and American officials said fighting had
ended in Qaim, a town near the Syrian border.
Acting on a tip, commandos searching a
home in Baghdad found a weapons cache with
a sizable chemical laboratory and documents
they said were instructions on making chemical
and biological weapons. They also reported
finding a bomb concealed inside a bottle, an
other in an umbrella and a third in a telephone.
The U.S.-organized meeting on a new gov
ernment drew scores of Iraqis to a gold-colored
tent erected in Ur — biblical birthplace of the
Jewish patriarch Abraham — and anti-Ameri
can protest in a nearby city.
"No to America and no to Saddam," chant
ed thousands of Shiite protesters in Nasiriyah,
exercising their new freedom of speech to ob
ject to the imminent creation of an American
interim governing authority.
Inside the meeting, White House envoy Zal
may Khalilzad said the United States has "no
interest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq."
He added, "We want you to establish your
own democratic system based on Iraqi tradi
tions and values."
A 13-point statement released after the ses
sion envisioned a democratic country where
"the rule oflaw is paramount." It said Saddam's
"Baath party must be dissolved and its effects
on society must be eliminated."
It wasn't immediately clear whether the
paper was drafted by U.S. officials in advance of
the meeting.
While anti-American sentiment flared in
Iraq, U.S. forces also won cooperation from
civilians eager to restore order and vital services.

Some Marines in Tikrit wore flowers in their
uniforms, gifts from resident s of the city.
Joint Iraqi-U.S. patrols made their first for
ays into Baghdad. American commanders re
ported ample assistance from Iraqis eager to
help troops uncover regime secrets.
In Washington, the Bush administration
dampened talk of possible military action
against Syria. Secretary of State Colin Powell,
who suggested diplomatic or economic mea
sures might be taken, said Iraq was"a unique
case" that required U.S. military action.
Administration officials have accused Syria
of maintaining a program to develop weapons
of mass destruction and of harboring members
of the Iraqi regime seeking to flee. Syrian offi
cials deny the allegations.
Still, at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said he believed troops

had shut down an illegal oil pipeline said to ex
port up to 200,000 barrels daily to Syria.
For his part, Bush said, "Our victory in Iraq
is certain, but it is not complete."
He added, "Today the world is safer, the ter
rorists have lost an ally, the Iraqi people are re
gaining control of their own destiny. These are
good days for the history of freedom."
There was another sign that the conflict was
nearing an end. French President Jacques
Chirac, a prominent critic of the war, tele
phoned Bush. In their first conversation in
more than two months, Chirac appeared to
soften his demand that the United Nations
have a central role in postwar reconstruction.
After nearly a quarter-century of living
under a regime that punished dissent with
death, Iraqis experimented with newfound
freedoms.

While under his usual heavy guard, Ahmed Chalabi (center), who has returned from exile to Iraq as
one of the possible leaders of the post-Saddam Hussein government, talks to Sayyid Hamza Al Musawi,
a longtime Iraqi opposition leader, on Sunday. Chalabi is staying in an encampment near Nasariyeh
with members of his Free Iraqi Forces, which are patrolling nearby areas with U.S. forces. Chalabi has
been considered the U.S. State Department's first choice to be the next leader of Iraq, though Wash
ington has said the decision should be left to Iraqis.
