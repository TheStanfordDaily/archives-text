MODESTO, Calif. (AP) —
Investigators said yesterday that
it will take days or even weeks to
determine whether the body of a
woman that washed up on a
Northern California shoreline is
that of Laci Peterson, the expec
tant mother who disappeared
on Christmas Eve.
The body and that of an in
fant boy were found a few miles
from the Berkeley marina where
Peterson's husband told police
he had gone fishing on Christ
mas Eve. The Modesto woman
was due to give birth to a boy in
February.
Modesto police said they
could not reveal any informa
tion while authorities in Contra
Costa County, where the body
was found, perform DNA tests.

It could be weeks before the
corpses are identified.
Contra Costa County sheriffs'
spokesman Jimmy Lee said
there was "no obvious cause of
death," and authorities do not
yet know whether there is any re
lationship between the woman
and the baby, whose bodies were
found about a mile apart.
Peterson was 27 when she was
last seen. Her husband, Scott,
said he went fishing at Berkeley
Marina after she left their home
that morning to walk the dog.
Peterson has been questioned
but never named as a suspect.
He Peterson admitted in Janu
ary that he had an affair with an
other woman last year but de
nied any role in his wife's disap
pearance.
