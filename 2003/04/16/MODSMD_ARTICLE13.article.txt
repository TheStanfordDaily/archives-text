# Airline near bankrupt

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)—
American Airlines teetered on the
brink of bankruptcy yesterday
after its flight attendants balked at
approving $340 million in wage
concessions. The union was given
one more day to vote.
Members of American's two
other major unions — represent
ing pilots and ground workers —
approved more than $1 billion in
concessions, but the flight atten
dants' union said its members had
rejected their share of the cuts by
fewer than 500 votes among
19,000 cast.
The world's biggest airline says
it will file for bankruptcy unless all
three unions approve their por
tions of $ 1.8 billion in labor cuts. It
set a Tuesday deadline, but later
said flight attendants would be al
lowed to continue voting — and
change their votes — until

Wednesday evening.
"This is our last chance to avoid
bankruptcy," said Don Carty,
chairman of American parent
AMR Corp.
If the flight attendants fail to
back the cuts, Carty said, Ameri
can will immediately file for bank
ruptcy.
United Airlines is already in
bankruptcy and the industry over
all is mired in its worst-ever slump,
compounded by fears of terror
ism, the SARS virus and the war in
Iraq. Analysts say labor conces
sions would help American Air
lines, but might not solve its long
term problems.
Concessions were approved by
69 percent of the pilots and 53
percent of the ground workers
who voted, the Allied Pilots Associ
ation and the Transport Workers
Union said.
