## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Dialogues on depression 
### 
Last spring the nation reacted in
shock to the news reports about
Elizabeth Shin, a bright, energetic
MIT undergraduate who became
clinically depressed and committed suicide
by setting herself on fire in her dorm room.
At a time when more and more college stu
dents each year are diagnosed with de
pression and other serious mental health
diseases, Elizabeth's case illustrated the
consequences when such a disease is left
untreated.
The Stanford community has long pro
vided resources for students struggling
with problems of all types and severities.
For example, Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services — also known as CAPS — in
Vaden Health Center provides students
with professional counselors who are avail
able for both long-term and short-term
consultation.
The Bridge, a student-run organizadon
located on Salvatierra Walk, offers peer sup
port year-round on Wednesday evenings
through its workshops. In addition, Bridge
counselors visit dorms to speak on issues
ranging from stress management to home
sickness. Both CAPS and The Bridge pro
vide a free, confidential crisis hotline, which
students can call 24 hours a day.
However, in recent years these resources
have become strapped with the growth in
student traffic. Hundreds of students call
The Bridge's anonymous hotline each year,
and the number of student visits to CAPS
has doubled in the past decade. Overall, be
cause of the growing need for these services,
the University responded by increasing
funding to CAPS in 2002, despite the Uni
versity's budget deficit.
Unfortunately, student and University
discussion on the issue has not increased ac
cordingly. Even with the rising numbers of
students seeking counseling, public dia
logue on depression and emotional health
continues to stall on campus. Moreover,
CAPS Director Alejandro Martinez esti
mates that with every two students who seek
help, one student suffers alone. Such facts
point to a larger threat to student health: re
fusal and reluctance to get help.
Indeed, students are often reticent about
admitting problems because of a perceived
campus pressure to appear "put together"
at all times and in all situations. Stanford stu
dents are often described as ducks on a
pond — everything is calm on the surface,
but underneath, the duck is flapping its legs
like mad to stay afloat.
Even when experiencing expected frus
trations with schoolwork, friends or rela
tionships, students may feel isolated because

everyone around them seems to be fine. As
a result, many students neglect their emo
tional and often physical health in order to
maintain their own appearances of inde
pendence and self sufficiency. This behavior
not only aggravates students' own unhappi
ness, but also feeds the destructive environ
ment which caused it.
Arguably, then, the problem lies not in
the availability of resources, but in their use
and appeal. Because students are reluctant
to respond to or even admit their need for
help, guarantees of free and confidential
counseling do not draw the students who
may need it most.
Therefore, the first and most important
step in promoting campus health is to ac
tively promote its discussion in the dorms,
through which otherwise silent individuals
will be more encouraged to open up and
may eventually seek outside help. After all, it
takes huge initiative to independently set up
counseling or join a support group. But the
step is made much easier once individuals
have already shared their problems and ex
perienced the benefits of dialogue.
Freshmen will especially gain from such
official dorm discussion for several reasons.
First, dorm events generally hold special in
fluence on freshmen because of the enthusi
asm and open-mindedness with which they
attend them. Second, freshmen are neces
sarily less aware of how useful resources
such as CAPS and The Bridge may be.
Third, because freshmen have no prior ex
perience to living and studying at Stanford,
they are naturally more susceptible to com
mon distresses. Freshmen may also have no
idea that others may be struggling as much
as they are. Finally, freshmen may be reluc
tant to risk their newly found friendships by
admitting that diey have a problem.
Instead of providing opportunities for
discussion before counseling is needed, the
Office of Residential Education has tradi
tionally addressed the coping mechanisms
to which students often resort as a result.
While Res Ed and other health services do a
relatively good job of treating these symp
toms once they have developed, the under
lying lack of dialogue remains the heart of
the problem.
Campus attitudes toward depression
must be addressed and changed. Through
Vaden Health Center and Res Ed pro
grams, the factors leading to and perpetuat
ing self-destructive behaviors such as binge
drinking must be addressed with die same
vigor as these behaviors are themselves ad
dressed. Without recognizing and fighting
these causes, the outward symptoms will
never truly go away.

everyone around them seems to be fine. As
a result, many students neglect their emo
tional and often physical health in order to
maintain their own appearances of inde
pendence and self sufficiency. This behavior
not only aggravates students' own unhappi
ness, but also feeds the destructive environ
ment which caused it.
Arguably, then, the problem lies not in
the availability of resources, but in their use
and appeal. Because students are reluctant
to respond to or even admit their need for
help, guarantees of free and confidential
counseling do not draw the students who
may need it most.
Therefore, the first and most important
step in promoting campus health is to ac
tively promote its discussion in the dorms,
through which otherwise silent individuals
will be more encouraged to open up and
may eventually seek outside help. After all, it
takes huge initiative to independently set up
counseling or join a support group. But the
step is made much easier once individuals
have already shared their problems and ex
perienced the benefits of dialogue.
Freshmen will especially gain from such
official dorm discussion for several reasons.
First, dorm events generally hold special in
fluence on freshmen because of the enthusi
asm and open-mindedness with which they
attend them. Second, freshmen are neces
sarily less aware of how useful resources
such as CAPS and The Bridge may be.
Third, because freshmen have no prior ex
perience to living and studying at Stanford,
they are naturally more susceptible to com
mon distresses. Freshmen may also have no
idea that others may be struggling as much
as they are. Finally, freshmen may be reluc
tant to risk their newly found friendships by
admitting that diey have a problem.
Instead of providing opportunities for
discussion before counseling is needed, the
Office of Residential Education has tradi
tionally addressed the coping mechanisms
to which students often resort as a result.
While Res Ed and other health services do a
relatively good job of treating these symp
toms once they have developed, the under
lying lack of dialogue remains the heart of
the problem.
Campus attitudes toward depression
must be addressed and changed. Through
Vaden Health Center and Res Ed pro
grams, the factors leading to and perpetuat
ing self-destructive behaviors such as binge
drinking must be addressed with die same
vigor as these behaviors are themselves ad
dressed. Without recognizing and fighting
these causes, the outward symptoms will
never truly go away.
