## Changing the GERs 
### 
If there's anything that peo
ple don't like to do, it is
what's required of them.
Here at Stanford, we have a
little thing known as the General
Education Requirements (GERs).
Despite the University's idealis
tic impression of the GERs as a sys
tem that adds breadth to a stu
dent's undergraduate program
and helps students in becoming re
sponsible members of society, in
reality, the system is more of an an
noyance (or even downright hin
drance) to many students' under
graduate four-year plans.
Often times I hear other stu
dents grumbling about having to
fulfill the GERs. Fuzzy or techie, it
doesn't matter — it seems like al
most everyone has some kind of a
problem with the system. Why,
then, have GERs continued to
exist for so long in this present
form when many students have
disagreements?
In the Stanford Bulletin, GERs
are justified as being an introduc
tion for students into the various
fields, whether the humanities, so
cial sciences, natural sciences, ap
plied sciences or technology. The
Bulletin says that the GERs do not
provide an adequately broad edu
cation (I completely agree), but are
meant to serve "as a nucleus
around which the student is ex
pected to build a coherent course
of study."
If we were all pursuing a liberal
arts education, I think the GERs
would most definitely help build a
coherent course of study. But the
fact is that many students are not
interested in an overall liberal arts
education. Most students are fo
cused on either a specific area
within the liberal arts, or profes
sional or technological programs.
Take, for instance, the typical
techie. For these students, who al

ready have many more major re
quirements to fulfill than the aver
age fuzzy, fulfilling GERs can be
extremely limiting and time-con
suming. Since many classes within
various departments don't fulfill
the GERs, the techie would be lim
ited from taking classes based on
"general interest" as opposed to
what he or she would have to do
now: Take a class to fulfill a GER.

Granted, there
are many GERs
classes that can
also serve a per
son's interest, but
those can be hard
to come by.
The current
structure of the
GERs is biased

against techies. The majority of the
GERs are humanities and social
science based. Fulfilling Area 1 re
quirements during freshman year
takes up 15 units. Combine that
with PWR, and the freshman year
requirements can take up more
than half a student's unit total for
the entire year. After that, there is
still Area 3 and 4 to deal with, and
that can take up another 20 units
easily. The GERs are fuzzy-heavy
and techies are getting the short
end of the stick.
I am not advocating the com
plete abolishment of the GERs, but
I believe we can make amend
ments to them, or even add anoth
er GER track that can address
some of the concerns mentioned
above. A "techie GER plan" with
more of an emphasis on math, nat
ural sciences, engineering or tech
nology and still with an area re
quirement specifically for humani
ties and social sciences might be a
better alternative. This would
lessen the amount of requirements
for students and allow them to take
more "general interest" classes

outside their majors if they choose
to.
As fora fuzzy GER track — we
already have it! As a hardcore
fuzzy, I am eternally grateful for
the current system, and any more
additions of math, science or tech
nology classes would probably lead
me to kill myself. It just so happens
that many GER classes also fulfill
my interests. But I know that for
many students out there, that is
not the case.
Another way of solving this
problem is allowing some AP scores
to count towards GERs, just as some
non-Stanford college classes do. If
someone took AP European Histo
ry and U.S. History and got a score
of five on both tests, that should, in
my opinion, cover an Area 3 re
quirement. Right now, they just
take up units — which cannot be
counted as anything except as elec
tives units, thus taking up space for
"general interest" classes.
It's true that many people rely
on the GERs to become exposed to
various subjects that they may
have an interest in pursuing fur
ther. That, I believe, is one of the
greatest things about the GERs.
But it is not fair for those who
know what they want to do to have
to fulfill the GERs when they could
be taking major or "general inter
est" classes. These students usually
come to resent GER classes and do
whatever it takes to get by as op
posed to trying to actually learn
something. As a result, the pur
pose of the GERs is defeated.
It is time that the University (and
its students) take a good look at the
GERs and question whether this
paternalistic system really is serving
the interests of all Stanford students
— not just the fuzzies and me.

If there's anything that peo
ple don't like to do, it is
what's required of them.
Here at Stanford, we have a
little thing known as the General
Education Requirements (GERs).
Despite the University's idealis
tic impression of the GERs as a sys
tem that adds breadth to a stu
dent's undergraduate program
and helps students in becoming re
sponsible members of society, in
reality, the system is more of an an
noyance (or even downright hin
drance) to many students' under
graduate four-year plans.
Often times I hear other stu
dents grumbling about having to
fulfill the GERs. Fuzzy or techie, it
doesn't matter — it seems like al
most everyone has some kind of a
problem with the system. Why,
then, have GERs continued to
exist for so long in this present
form when many students have
disagreements?
In the Stanford Bulletin, GERs
are justified as being an introduc
tion for students into the various
fields, whether the humanities, so
cial sciences, natural sciences, ap
plied sciences or technology. The
Bulletin says that the GERs do not
provide an adequately broad edu
cation (I completely agree), but are
meant to serve "as a nucleus
around which the student is ex
pected to build a coherent course
of study."
If we were all pursuing a liberal
arts education, I think the GERs
would most definitely help build a
coherent course of study. But the
fact is that many students are not
interested in an overall liberal arts
education. Most students are fo
cused on either a specific area
within the liberal arts, or profes
sional or technological programs.
Take, for instance, the typical
techie. For these students, who al

ready have many more major re
quirements to fulfill than the aver
age fuzzy, fulfilling GERs can be
extremely limiting and time-con
suming. Since many classes within
various departments don't fulfill
the GERs, the techie would be lim
ited from taking classes based on
"general interest" as opposed to
what he or she would have to do
now: Take a class to fulfill a GER.

Granted, there
are many GERs
classes that can
also serve a per
son's interest, but
those can be hard
to come by.
The current
structure of the
GERs is biased

against techies. The majority of the
GERs are humanities and social
science based. Fulfilling Area 1 re
quirements during freshman year
takes up 15 units. Combine that
with PWR, and the freshman year
requirements can take up more
than half a student's unit total for
the entire year. After that, there is
still Area 3 and 4 to deal with, and
that can take up another 20 units
easily. The GERs are fuzzy-heavy
and techies are getting the short
end of the stick.
I am not advocating the com
plete abolishment of the GERs, but
I believe we can make amend
ments to them, or even add anoth
er GER track that can address
some of the concerns mentioned
above. A "techie GER plan" with
more of an emphasis on math, nat
ural sciences, engineering or tech
nology and still with an area re
quirement specifically for humani
ties and social sciences might be a
better alternative. This would
lessen the amount of requirements
for students and allow them to take
more "general interest" classes

outside their majors if they choose
to.
As fora fuzzy GER track — we
already have it! As a hardcore
fuzzy, I am eternally grateful for
the current system, and any more
additions of math, science or tech
nology classes would probably lead
me to kill myself. It just so happens
that many GER classes also fulfill
my interests. But I know that for
many students out there, that is
not the case.
Another way of solving this
problem is allowing some AP scores
to count towards GERs, just as some
non-Stanford college classes do. If
someone took AP European Histo
ry and U.S. History and got a score
of five on both tests, that should, in
my opinion, cover an Area 3 re
quirement. Right now, they just
take up units — which cannot be
counted as anything except as elec
tives units, thus taking up space for
"general interest" classes.
It's true that many people rely
on the GERs to become exposed to
various subjects that they may
have an interest in pursuing fur
ther. That, I believe, is one of the
greatest things about the GERs.
But it is not fair for those who
know what they want to do to have
to fulfill the GERs when they could
be taking major or "general inter
est" classes. These students usually
come to resent GER classes and do
whatever it takes to get by as op
posed to trying to actually learn
something. As a result, the pur
pose of the GERs is defeated.
It is time that the University (and
its students) take a good look at the
GERs and question whether this
paternalistic system really is serving
the interests of all Stanford students
— not just the fuzzies and me.

Got any other recommendations? E
