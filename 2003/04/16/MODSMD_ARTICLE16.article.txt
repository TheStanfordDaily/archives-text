New Alcohol Policy disrespects
student decision-making
The decision to ban alcohol at all-fresh
man events seriously questions the mutual
understanding, respect and open commu
nication between students, resident assis
tants and administrators that the Office of
Residential Education's mission claims to
value so deeply. Dorm life at Stanford is,
for the most part, a unique and enjoyable
experience because students are treated as
adults and with respect. Students respect
RAs and an administration that gives them
the freedom to make their own informed
decisions, whether about alcohol, sex or
other important matters. Res Ed has, until
now, fostered an open environment which
educates students and allows them to
make healthy and informed decisions.
By banning alcohol at all-freshman
events, the University has said that it no
longer respects the student body to make
wise decisions on its own. By creating a
sense of repression in all-frosh dorms, Res
Ed and the RAs in these dorms will lose the
respect of those students who formerly
held them in esteem simply for giving
them the freedom of choice that other
schools do not.

College students will always drink. This
fact cannot be ignored. By repressing
drinking at all-frosh events, the drinking
will simply be pushed behind closed
doors, a situation that Res Ed should con
sider far more dangerous. By keeping
drinking out in the open, a dorm can ef
fectively watch out for other members of
the community.
The University has been slowly chang
ing the dorm dynamic here at Stanford,
squashing the last ounces of students' free
dom of choice over the years by first ban
ning the use of dorm funds on the pur
chase of alcohol and now by banning alco
hol at all-freshman dorm events. The Uni
versity seems to believe that by lengthen
ing this process slowly over the course or
many years, students will not take notice
or be upset at incremental changes along
the way.
The University's disrespect of the
student body is unacceptable. As a for
mer RA, I am ashamed at this recent de
cision made by Res Ed, an organization
that purports to value openness and
communication while continuing to dis
respect the student body's ability to de
cide for itself.

Additions to Alcohol Policy 'will make
freshman residences more boring'
The new additions to Stanford's alcohol
policy seem misguided, very confused and
even counterproductive. The new policies
fail to promote and will fail to produce
their stated goals. They will actually hurt
the community.
First of all, let's get the legality issue out
of the way. Freshmen, sophomores, ju
niors and even a few seniors are under 21.
Thus, nearly everyone who drinks does so
illegally. But who cares? Legal issues have
nothing to do with our personal growth,
safety or responsibility .The Alcohol Policy
in its current form and its newly modified
one sanctions underage drinking.
So what's the problem? The culture of
drinking. I have observed that on any
given night, freshmen search around for
parties, for stuff to do, places to go and
people to see. When, as is often the case,
these social opportunities are lacking a
group of a dozen or so friends retreat to a
room and drink. And they usually drink
hard alcohol because beer is relatively
hard to get on campus. And so you have
inexperienced drinkers drinking Jack
and Coke all night long. This is the prob
lem, and as odd as it sounds, it would in
crease safety if beer were sold on campus
(not just at on-campus dining establish

ments that shall go unnamed).
So now freshmen can't throw alcohol
laden parties. What the hell does that do
except make freshman residences more
boring? Everyone drinks everywhere.
Those who drink will drink anyway. The
social pressure is still there. Furthermore,
that pressure is inherent in the discomfort
of being a freshman.
University administrators like Asst.
Dean and Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe speak vaguely about the
"kind of community we want to create,"
but seem to lack even a basic understand
ing of the current freshman community.
The fact that freshmen cannot serve al
cohol at dorm parties but still walk "down
the hall with a beer," as another adminis
trator said, seems pretty stupid. Just think
a little about this. If you cannot serve at
parties, but can play flip-cup or pound
beers in someone's room, what will people
do? Those who want to drink will drink.
But now they will conceal it.

New Alcohol Policy will harm
RA-resident relationship
We are writing in response to yester

day's announcement by the Office of
Residential Education that alcohol will
no longer be allowed at dorm-wide func
tions in all-frosh dorms. While not all of
us drank as freshmen, many of us did,
and because of Stanford's community
and responsibility-oriented policies, we
were able to drink in a safe environment
among our friends, housemates and res
idence staff members.
If we lived in an ideal world where
no one drank alcohol until his or her
21st birthday, this policy would be a
simple solution. But we all know that
that is not true. The fact of the matter is
that students are going to drink, no
matter what policies the University pre
scribes. A policy such as this will only
change the location of where students
drink — away from their residence
communities.
Perhaps most importantly, and despite
Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo's predictions of the opposite,
this new policy could significantly alter the
vital relationship between students and
their resident assistants. The relationship
between RA.s and residents is built upon
trust — the trust that RAs will be able to
provide advice and guidance regarding al-
cohol consumption and the trust
that residents will be free from RAs
enforcing heavy-handed alcohol
prohibitions.
That relationship — along
with Stanford's broader alcohol
policies — create a campus envi

clone responsibly and safely. RAs
can provide a vital resource to

The Daily should be fair in its
report of tne Catholic community
The Daily's story, "Feminists
critique past, present Catholic
Church" (April 15) promotes a re
markably skewed version of the re
ligious affiliation claimed by the
largest number of Stanford stu
dents. To be sure, the issue of ex
panding the list of people eligible
for ordination in the church is one
that has caused a considerable
amount of division among
Catholics, but the article goes be

yond reporting a controversy and
prints a number of broadsides and
slanders against people who hold
strong religious faith.
In response to the bigoted state
ment by an assistant professor at
Stanford that the "Catholic
Church is a joke," I would submit
the following: Is it a joke when 15
students spend their spring break
working with the poor in Mexico
rather than on the beaches? Is it a
joke each month when members of
the Stanford Catholic community
spend time preaching the gospel

to children incarcerated at the
Santa Clara County Juvenile Hall?
Is it a joke when millions of
Catholics across the world, both re
ligious and lay, renounce the self
ish materialism of modern society
in favor of a life of prayer and ser
vice? All of the above, and many
other examples of faith that occur
daily here on campus and else
where, are motivated by a faith in
God cultivated in the Catholic
Church and are happening today.
Our baptism in Christ (which is
equally powerful in all of us,

whether or not we are ordained as
priests) compels us to do so.
Catholics certainly are not a
perfect folk, and like everyone else,
we have our share of scandal and
sin. But The Daily would do well
to report on the other side of our
faith and not simply include quotes
from people who declare us as
being "an unnecessary tag-along
from medieval times."

The Daily's story, "Feminists

largest number of Stanford stu

Is it a joke when millions of
Catholics across the world, both re

in favor of a life of prayer and ser

other examples of faith that occur

Our baptism in Christ (which is

New Alcohol Policy disrespects
student decision-making
The decision to ban alcohol at all-fresh
man events seriously questions the mutual
understanding, respect and open commu
nication between students, resident assis
tants and administrators that the Office of
Residential Education's mission claims to
value so deeply. Dorm life at Stanford is,
for the most part, a unique and enjoyable
experience because students are treated as
adults and with respect. Students respect
RAs and an administration that gives them
the freedom to make their own informed
decisions, whether about alcohol, sex or
other important matters. Res Ed has, until
now, fostered an open environment which
educates students and allows them to
make healthy and informed decisions.
By banning alcohol at all-freshman
events, the University has said that it no
longer respects the student body to make
wise decisions on its own. By creating a
sense of repression in all-frosh dorms, Res
Ed and the RAs in these dorms will lose the
respect of those students who formerly
held them in esteem simply for giving
them the freedom of choice that other
schools do not.

College students will always drink. This
fact cannot be ignored. By repressing
drinking at all-frosh events, the drinking
will simply be pushed behind closed
doors, a situation that Res Ed should con
sider far more dangerous. By keeping
drinking out in the open, a dorm can ef
fectively watch out for other members of
the community.
The University has been slowly chang
ing the dorm dynamic here at Stanford,
squashing the last ounces of students' free
dom of choice over the years by first ban
ning the use of dorm funds on the pur
chase of alcohol and now by banning alco
hol at all-freshman dorm events. The Uni
versity seems to believe that by lengthen
ing this process slowly over the course or
many years, students will not take notice
or be upset at incremental changes along
the way.
The University's disrespect of the
student body is unacceptable. As a for
mer RA, I am ashamed at this recent de
cision made by Res Ed, an organization
that purports to value openness and
communication while continuing to dis
respect the student body's ability to de
cide for itself.

Additions to Alcohol Policy 'will make
freshman residences more boring'
The new additions to Stanford's alcohol
policy seem misguided, very confused and
even counterproductive. The new policies
fail to promote and will fail to produce
their stated goals. They will actually hurt
the community.
First of all, let's get the legality issue out
of the way. Freshmen, sophomores, ju
niors and even a few seniors are under 21.
Thus, nearly everyone who drinks does so
illegally. But who cares? Legal issues have
nothing to do with our personal growth,
safety or responsibility .The Alcohol Policy
in its current form and its newly modified
one sanctions underage drinking.
So what's the problem? The culture of
drinking. I have observed that on any
given night, freshmen search around for
parties, for stuff to do, places to go and
people to see. When, as is often the case,
these social opportunities are lacking a
group of a dozen or so friends retreat to a
room and drink. And they usually drink
hard alcohol because beer is relatively
hard to get on campus. And so you have
inexperienced drinkers drinking Jack
and Coke all night long. This is the prob
lem, and as odd as it sounds, it would in
crease safety if beer were sold on campus
(not just at on-campus dining establish

ments that shall go unnamed).
So now freshmen can't throw alcohol
laden parties. What the hell does that do
except make freshman residences more
boring? Everyone drinks everywhere.
Those who drink will drink anyway. The
social pressure is still there. Furthermore,
that pressure is inherent in the discomfort
of being a freshman.
University administrators like Asst.
Dean and Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe speak vaguely about the
"kind of community we want to create,"
but seem to lack even a basic understand
ing of the current freshman community.
The fact that freshmen cannot serve al
cohol at dorm parties but still walk "down
the hall with a beer," as another adminis
trator said, seems pretty stupid. Just think
a little about this. If you cannot serve at
parties, but can play flip-cup or pound
beers in someone's room, what will people
do? Those who want to drink will drink.
But now they will conceal it.

New Alcohol Policy will harm
RA-resident relationship
We are writing in response to yester

day's announcement by the Office of
Residential Education that alcohol will
no longer be allowed at dorm-wide func
tions in all-frosh dorms. While not all of
us drank as freshmen, many of us did,
and because of Stanford's community
and responsibility-oriented policies, we
were able to drink in a safe environment
among our friends, housemates and res
idence staff members.
If we lived in an ideal world where
no one drank alcohol until his or her
21st birthday, this policy would be a
simple solution. But we all know that
that is not true. The fact of the matter is
that students are going to drink, no
matter what policies the University pre
scribes. A policy such as this will only
change the location of where students
drink — away from their residence
communities.
Perhaps most importantly, and despite
Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo's predictions of the opposite,
this new policy could significantly alter the
vital relationship between students and
their resident assistants. The relationship
between RA.s and residents is built upon
trust — the trust that RAs will be able to
provide advice and guidance regarding al-
cohol consumption and the trust
that residents will be free from RAs
enforcing heavy-handed alcohol
prohibitions.
That relationship — along
with Stanford's broader alcohol
policies — create a campus envi
ronment where, although stu
dents may drink to excess at
times, drinking is, by and large,

clone responsibly and safely. RAs
can provide a vital resource to
their residents — caring for their
welfare when they have drank to
excess and providing guidance
and counseling about alcohol con
sumption issues.
