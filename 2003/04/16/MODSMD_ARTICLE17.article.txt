# CAMPUS VIEWPOINT
## Free speech can be challenged without being imperiled 
### JOHN M. EDEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
Everyone loves to second-guess the
members of the U.S. Supreme Court
After all, they periodically proffer utterly
laughable arguments in support of their
holdings (e.g., Bush vs. Gore). But this
time, they got it right. The Court recently
decided that Virginia is at liberty to pro
hibit cross burning, as long as there is an
intent to intimidate that is, in the words of
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, "particu
larly virulent."
In his column "Symbols must be pro
tected by the First Amendments, too"
(April 11), Chris Guzelian outlines his ra
tionale for thinking that this holding will
have a particularly unsavory effect on free
speech in the years to come. His case real
ly involves two distinct — though related
— claims.
First, he insists that given the infinite in
terpretability of symbols, there's a strong
presumption against prohibiting cross
burning. On this view, there's simply no
way to distinguish between the unprotect
ed intent to intimidate, on the one hand,
and the intent to convey a constitutionally
protected (yet abhorrent) message, on the
other. And so, the prudent thing fora firm
believer in the First Amendment to do, is,
well, nothing. Our moral sympathies may
draw us toward silencing the cross burners
among us, but this simply isn't an option.

These words might as well have been
straight from the mouth of Justice David
Hackett Souter. "A burning cross is not al
ways used to strike fear into the hearts of
African Americans." This posture is non
sense on stilts, as if a burning cross could lie
simply shorthand for the following protect
ed message: "We would be especially pleased
it people of darker hues would remain so
cially, politically and economically subjugat
ed in all domains of human endeavor." The
content of a burning cross is a tacit threat,
one that ineluctably reverberates through
the souls of all reflective people.
Justice Souter begs to differ. We can tell
"the [truly] intimidating instance from [a]
wholly ideological one only by reference to
some further circumstances." In other
words, cross burning is only intimidating
when subsequent events, or additional
facts, show us "something more than the
isolated fact of cross burning." Of course, I
find it impossible to imagine that this
grotesque gesture could be purely "ideo
logical," but there is something to Souter's
worry. The cross, as a symbol containing
multiple meanings, ought not to be direct
ly regulated.
As Souter nicely points out in his partial
dissent, the evidence provision in the Vir
ginia law allows a jury to almost automati
cally infer an "intent to intimidate" when
ever a cross is burned. In short, Virginia's
law regulates the wrong thing (the symbol
and not the threat it can convey) and does

so in a highly prejudicial way (by assuming
criminal intent where there may be none).
Yet Souter himself has identified the
elixir for our current constitutional
malaise. Even if a cross were selected ex
clusively for its unique ability to convey a
protected message, in prohibiting cross
burning we are not necessarily regulating
the cross per se. If there's reason to think
that certain types of intimidation cannot
be directly regulated or prohibited, then
the oblique regulation of symbols may not
only be prudent, but necessary. The prin
ciple that symbols can be regulated to curb
the unprotected messages encapsulated
within them probably has its best expres
sion in New York vs. Ferber (1982), a case
concerning child pornography.
In Ferber the Court held that publica
tions containing unprotected speech
(child pornography) can certainly be pro
hibited, so long as particular literary
themes are not targeted.
Justice Antonin Scalia echoes this senti
ment in arguing that while the state may
certainly prohibit libel, it may not "make
the further content discrimination of pro
scribing only libel critical of the govern
ment (R.A.V. vs. St. Paul, 1992). The up
shot for Virginia vs. Black is that symbols
can be regulated as long as they haven't
been inappropriately singled out. The ob
vious riposte is that curbing cross burning
abrogates Virginians' right to engage in a
very special kind of protected speech: i.e.,

proclaiming white superiority by burning
a cross on privately held property. This re
tort is only compelling if we assume — er
roneously — that each of us has a right to
all potential mediums in which speech
might be conveyed. But since Klansmen
have plenty of other avenues by which to
express their retrograde beliefs, and given
that there's no constitutional guarantee of
the widest possible range of media for the
expression of popular or unpopular
views, this challenge fails.
What about the objection that Vir
ginia's statute unconstitutionally tilts the
law against those accused of intimidating
speech? There's more bark than bite in
this worry, and here's why. The wording
of the statute is plain as day: Burning a
cross on the property of another, on a
highway, or on another public place is
"prima facie evidence of an intent to in
timidate a person or group of persons."
The scope of the prohibition is relative
ly narrow and suggests that an instance of
private cross burning — say, an initiation
ceremony at a Klansmen's private abode
— wouldn't be outlawed. Since public
places are off-limits, higher costs may* be
imposed on white supremacists who want
to hold such ceremonies. But I doubt that
many of us really think our tax dollars
should subsidize cross burning anyway.
What about the second prong of
Guzelian's view? Even if cross burning cat
egorically has a threatening content, does

Virginia vs. Black portend a dark future for
free speech? Such a future would be most
clearly confirmed if a panoply of different
symbols typically used to express protected
thoughts were prohibited. But this is un
likely to happen. When the Indianapolis
statute allowing women to bring civil suits
against distributors of pornography was
passed back in 1986, a flurry of protests and
a general impatience with the Meese Com
mission eviscerated the anti-pornography
lobby of much of its political inertia. But
more importantly, the overly restrictive
hate-speech codes that swept the country
since the late '80s — including the
harbinger enacted by the University of
Michigan in 1988 — have since been struck
down or revised without too much fanfare.
If history has taught us anything, it's
that our constitutional edifice is a bit more
resilient than Guzelian would have you be
lieve. And if Virginia vs. Black has taught
us anything, it's that the "evil to be re
stricted" in cross burning is of far greater
weight than "the expressive interests" we
might have to prune in order to protect
African Americans from unnecessary and
illiberal intimidation (New York vs. Fer
ber). The meaning of the First Amend
ment has once again been challenged. But
it has not, I assure you, been imperiled.

certainly prohibit libel, it may not "make
the further content discrimination of pro
scribing only libel critical of the govern
ment (R.A.V. vs. St. Paul, 1992). The up
shot for Virginia vs. Black is that symbols
can be regulated as long as they haven't
been inappropriately singled out. The ob
vious riposte is that curbing cross burning
abrogates Virginians' right to engage in a
very special kind of protected speech: i.e.,

proclaiming white superiority by burning
a cross on privately held property. This re
tort is only compelling if we assume — er
roneously — that each of us has a right to
all potential mediums in which speech
might be conveyed. But since Klansmen
have plenty of other avenues by which to
express their retrograde beliefs, and given
that there's no constitutional guarantee of
the widest possible range of media for the
expression of popular or unpopular
views, this challenge fails.
What about the objection that Vir
ginia's statute unconstitutionally tilts the
law against those accused of intimidating
speech? There's more bark than bite in
this worry, and here's why. The wording
of the statute is plain as day: Burning a
cross on the property of another, on a
highway, or on another public place is
"prima facie evidence of an intent to in
timidate a person or group of persons."
The scope of the prohibition is relative
ly narrow and suggests that an instance of
private cross burning — say, an initiation
ceremony at a Klansmen's private abode
— wouldn't be outlawed. Since public
places are off-limits, higher costs may* be
imposed on white supremacists who want
to hold such ceremonies. But I doubt that
many of us really think our tax dollars
should subsidize cross burning anyway.
What about the second prong of
Guzelian's view? Even if cross burning cat
egorically has a threatening content, does

Virginia vs. Black portend a dark future for
free speech? Such a future would be most
clearly confirmed if a panoply of different
symbols typically used to express protected
thoughts were prohibited. But this is un
likely to happen. When the Indianapolis
statute allowing women to bring civil suits
against distributors of pornography was
passed back in 1986, a flurry of protests and
a general impatience with the Meese Com
mission eviscerated the anti-pornography
lobby of much of its political inertia. But
more importantly, the overly restrictive
hate-speech codes that swept the country
since the late '80s — including the
harbinger enacted by the University of
Michigan in 1988 — have since been struck
down or revised without too much fanfare.
If history has taught us anything, it's
that our constitutional edifice is a bit more
resilient than Guzelian would have you be
lieve. And if Virginia vs. Black has taught
us anything, it's that the "evil to be re
stricted" in cross burning is of far greater
weight than "the expressive interests" we
might have to prune in order to protect
African Americans from unnecessary and
illiberal intimidation (New York vs. Fer
ber). The meaning of the First Amend
ment has once again been challenged. But
it has not, I assure you, been imperiled.

Everyone loves to second-guess the
members of the U.S. Supreme Court
After all, they periodically proffer utterly
laughable arguments in support of their
holdings (e.g., Bush vs. Gore). But this
time, they got it right. The Court recently
decided that Virginia is at liberty to pro
hibit cross burning, as long as there is an
intent to intimidate that is, in the words of
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, "particu
larly virulent."
In his column "Symbols must be pro
tected by the First Amendments, too"
(April 11), Chris Guzelian outlines his ra
tionale for thinking that this holding will
have a particularly unsavory effect on free
speech in the years to come. His case real
ly involves two distinct — though related
— claims.
First, he insists that given the infinite in
terpretability of symbols, there's a strong
presumption against prohibiting cross
burning. On this view, there's simply no
way to distinguish between the unprotect
ed intent to intimidate, on the one hand,
and the intent to convey a constitutionally
protected (yet abhorrent) message, on the
other. And so, the prudent thing fora firm
believer in the First Amendment to do, is,
well, nothing. Our moral sympathies may
draw us toward silencing the cross burners
among us, but this simply isn't an option.

These words might as well have been
straight from the mouth of Justice David
Hackett Souter. "A burning cross is not al
ways used to strike fear into the hearts of
African Americans." This posture is non
sense on stilts, as if a burning cross could lie
simply shorthand for the following protect
ed message: "We would be especially pleased
it people of darker hues would remain so
cially, politically and economically subjugat
ed in all domains of human endeavor." The
content of a burning cross is a tacit threat,
one that ineluctably reverberates through
the souls of all reflective people.
Justice Souter begs to differ. We can tell
"the [truly] intimidating instance from [a]
wholly ideological one only by reference to
some further circumstances." In other
words, cross burning is only intimidating
when subsequent events, or additional
facts, show us "something more than the
isolated fact of cross burning." Of course, I
find it impossible to imagine that this
grotesque gesture could be purely "ideo
logical," but there is something to Souter's
worry. The cross, as a symbol containing
multiple meanings, ought not to be direct
ly regulated.
As Souter nicely points out in his partial
dissent, the evidence provision in the Vir
ginia law allows a jury to almost automati
cally infer an "intent to intimidate" when
ever a cross is burned. In short, Virginia's
law regulates the wrong thing (the symbol
and not the threat it can convey) and does

so in a highly prejudicial way (by assuming
criminal intent where there may be none).
Yet Souter himself has identified the
elixir for our current constitutional
malaise. Even if a cross were selected ex
clusively for its unique ability to convey a
protected message, in prohibiting cross
burning we are not necessarily regulating
the cross per se. If there's reason to think
that certain types of intimidation cannot
be directly regulated or prohibited, then
the oblique regulation of symbols may not
only be prudent, but necessary. The prin
ciple that symbols can be regulated to curb
the unprotected messages encapsulated
within them probably has its best expres
sion in New York vs. Ferber (1982), a case
concerning child pornography.
In Ferber the Court held that publica
tions containing unprotected speech
(child pornography) can certainly be pro
hibited, so long as particular literary
themes are not targeted.
