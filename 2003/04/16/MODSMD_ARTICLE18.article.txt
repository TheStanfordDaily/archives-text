## Romanczuk impresses Hurler lives up TO EXPECTATIONS 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
Every afternoon freshman Mark Romanczuk
pulls on a Cardinal baseball jersey, knowing well
that the color on his back could easily have been dif
ferent.
A left-handed pitcher with a fastball that hits the
low 90s, Romanczuk was no secret to baseball re
cruiters. His high school career at St. Mark's in
Newark, DE was comprised of countless stunning
accomplishments, including two First Team Ail-
American selections, several league honors and a
10-0 senior season that included three no-hitters
and one perfect game.
These achievements, coupled with stellar acade
mics and sparkling performances at All-Star games
and camps in the summers, captured the attention
of more than a few impressive organizations.
By the end of his senior year, Romanczuk was
being heavily pursued by ball clubs around the
country, including Notre Dame, Miami, Southern
California, and Stanford. On top of that, he was a
fifth-round MLB draft pick for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
Needless to say, Romanczuk had to make the
choice of a lifetime.
Relaxing after practice at Stanford's Sunken Di
amond, the freshman spoke confidently about his
decision to put off a major league career and pur
sue his education.
"There's something about Stanford that you just
can't turn down." Romanczuk said, "It's got the best
combination of athletic prestige and academic sue

cess. And it's really a once-in-a-lifetime opportuni
ty, and there are only so many people that get a
chance to have the Stanford experience."
While Romanczuk is thrilled to be on the mound
for the No. 4 Cardinal, the Cardinal is possibly even
more grateful to have him there.
When an early-season injury yanked senior
starter Tim Cunningham from the starting rota
tion, the coaching staff waved Romanczuk out of
the bullpen, hoping that he would live up to their
expectations.
The lefty far exceeded all that was expected of

him in his first collegiate start, throwing for 6 in
nings and collecting a win against USC.
Now, less than two months later, the 6-0 Ro
manczuk lays claim to the best record on his team
and is tied for the best record in the Pacific-10 con
ference. In nine appearances, he has also reeled in
two saves, recorded an ERA of 3.21 and struck out
30 opponents in 33.2 innings.
