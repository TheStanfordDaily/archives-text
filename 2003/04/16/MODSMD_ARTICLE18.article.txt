## Romanczuk impresses Hurler lives up TO EXPECTATIONS 
### JESSICA PETERS STAFF WRITER 
Every afternoon freshman Mark Romanczuk
pulls on a Cardinal baseball jersey, knowing well
that the color on his back could easily have been dif
ferent.
A left-handed pitcher with a fastball that hits the
low 90s, Romanczuk was no secret to baseball re
cruiters. His high school career at St. Mark's in
Newark, DE was comprised of countless stunning
accomplishments, including two First Team Ail-
American selections, several league honors and a
10-0 senior season that included three no-hitters
and one perfect game.
These achievements, coupled with stellar acade
mics and sparkling performances at All-Star games
and camps in the summers, captured the attention
of more than a few impressive organizations.
By the end of his senior year, Romanczuk was
being heavily pursued by ball clubs around the
country, including Notre Dame, Miami, Southern
California, and Stanford. On top of that, he was a
fifth-round MLB draft pick for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
Needless to say, Romanczuk had to make the
choice of a lifetime.
Relaxing after practice at Stanford's Sunken Di
amond, the freshman spoke confidently about his
decision to put off a major league career and pur
sue his education.
"There's something about Stanford that you just
can't turn down." Romanczuk said, "It's got the best
combination of athletic prestige and academic sue

cess. And it's really a once-in-a-lifetime opportuni
ty, and there are only so many people that get a
chance to have the Stanford experience."
While Romanczuk is thrilled to be on the mound
for the No. 4 Cardinal, the Cardinal is possibly even
more grateful to have him there.
When an early-season injury yanked senior
starter Tim Cunningham from the starting rota
tion, the coaching staff waved Romanczuk out of
the bullpen, hoping that he would live up to their
expectations.
The lefty far exceeded all that was expected of

him in his first collegiate start, throwing for 6 in
nings and collecting a win against USC.
Now, less than two months later, the 6-0 Ro
manczuk lays claim to the best record on his team
and is tied for the best record in the Pacific-10 con
ference. In nine appearances, he has also reeled in
two saves, recorded an ERA of 3.21 and struck out
30 opponents in 33.2 innings.

Cunningham's injury not occurred, Romanczuk

would likely be pitching only in re
lief.
"He started coming out of the
bullpen in short relief, which is ask
ing a lot fora freshman," Marquess
said. "But he did a good job with
that."
After Romanczuk, who still in
tends to play in the majors alter
graduation, proved his incredible
worth as a starter, the coaches wast
ed no time in making him a stan
dard in the starting rotation for the
Card.
"The thing that's surprised us so
far is that he's been as good as he's
been so early," Marquess said.
"That's unusual; it's difficult for
freshmen to come in and do as well
as he's done right away. We knew
we had a good pitcher in him, but
we didn't expect this."
One of die most remarkable sur
prises for the Cardinal came in Ro
manczuk's most recent start, in
which he threw all nine innings in a
4-2 Stanford win over No. 3 Arizona.
The word that Marquess choos
es most often to explain Ro
manczuk's success, especially the
win against ASU, is "poise," but Ro
manczuk has a slightly different
lake on it.
"When I think about it, it's more
or less just that I'm on the mound,
doing what I love to do," he re
marked. "If it appears that I'm re
laxed out there even though it's a
pressure situation, I think it's just

that I'm having a good time."
Despite his stress-free outlook
on the game, Romanczuk does
admit that his desire to pitch well in
his first outing for Stanford caused
him to be a little bit nervous for that
first game.
But once he had reached back
and fired his first pitch, he recalls
that the pressure disappeared and
it felt just like pitching as an eight
year-old back in Delaware — only
now with much larger opponents,
of course.
Romanczuk's confidence in his
arm has grown as a result of his suc
cesses, but he still attributes much
of the effort in his six wins to Stan
ford's "potent offense," which con
sistently drives in runs to reinforce
the work of the pitcher on the rub
ber.
The Ail-American candidate
says that he has been especially in
fluenced by pitching coach Tom
Kunis, who he hails as "unmatched
by any other college pitching coach
in the nation".
"He really emphasizes the men
tal side of pitching." Romanczuk
said. "He really helps us under
stand what we're trying to do out
there, aside from what they teach
us here physically."
That Romanczuk is still learn
ing about the game that he loves is
a testament to the idea that baseball
is a sport that never ceases to pre
sent challenges.
And everything in this pitcher's
drive and ability indicates that he
will field every one of those chal
lenges with pride in his choice to
wear the Cardinal jersey.

4-2 Stanford win over No. 3 Arizona.
The word that Marquess choos

that I'm having a good time."

on the game, Romanczuk does

his first outing for Stanford caused
him to be a little bit nervous for that
first game.

that the pressure disappeared and
it felt just like pitching as an eight

Romanczuk's confidence in his
arm has grown as a result of his suc

wear the Cardinal jersey.
Every afternoon freshman Mark Romanczuk
pulls on a Cardinal baseball jersey, knowing well
that the color on his back could easily have been dif
ferent.
A left-handed pitcher with a fastball that hits the
low 90s, Romanczuk was no secret to baseball re
cruiters. His high school career at St. Mark's in
Newark, DE was comprised of countless stunning
accomplishments, including two First Team Ail-
American selections, several league honors and a
10-0 senior season that included three no-hitters
and one perfect game.
These achievements, coupled with stellar acade
mics and sparkling performances at All-Star games
and camps in the summers, captured the attention
of more than a few impressive organizations.
By the end of his senior year, Romanczuk was
being heavily pursued by ball clubs around the
country, including Notre Dame, Miami, Southern
California, and Stanford. On top of that, he was a
fifth-round MLB draft pick for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
Needless to say, Romanczuk had to make the
choice of a lifetime.
Relaxing after practice at Stanford's Sunken Di
amond, the freshman spoke confidently about his
decision to put off a major league career and pur
sue his education.
"There's something about Stanford that you just
can't turn down." Romanczuk said, "It's got the best
combination of athletic prestige and academic sue

cess. And it's really a once-in-a-lifetime opportuni
ty, and there are only so many people that get a
chance to have the Stanford experience."
While Romanczuk is thrilled to be on the mound
for the No. 4 Cardinal, the Cardinal is possibly even
more grateful to have him there.
When an early-season injury yanked senior
starter Tim Cunningham from the starting rota
tion, the coaching staff waved Romanczuk out of
the bullpen, hoping that he would live up to their
expectations.
The lefty far exceeded all that was expected of

him in his first collegiate start, throwing for 6 in
nings and collecting a win against USC.
Now, less than two months later, the 6-0 Ro
manczuk lays claim to the best record on his team
and is tied for the best record in the Pacific-10 con
ference. In nine appearances, he has also reeled in
two saves, recorded an ERA of 3.21 and struck out
30 opponents in 33.2 innings.

After a choosing to come to the Farm over other top schools and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, freshman pitcher
Mark Romanczuk is an impact player for this year's Cardinal baseball program.
would likely be pitching only in re
lief.
"He started coming out of the
bullpen in short relief, which is ask
ing a lot fora freshman," Marquess
said. "But he did a good job with
that."
After Romanczuk, who still in
tends to play in the majors alter
graduation, proved his incredible
worth as a starter, the coaches wast
ed no time in making him a stan
dard in the starting rotation for the
Card.
"The thing that's surprised us so
far is that he's been as good as he's
been so early," Marquess said.
"That's unusual; it's difficult for
freshmen to come in and do as well
as he's done right away. We knew
we had a good pitcher in him, but
we didn't expect this."
One of die most remarkable sur
prises for the Cardinal came in Ro
manczuk's most recent start, in
which he threw all nine innings in a
4-2 Stanford win over No. 3 Arizona.
