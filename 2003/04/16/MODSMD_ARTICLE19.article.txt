### CHRIS MEYER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their final regular-season home match, senior
All-Americans David Martin and Scott Lipsky lead the
No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team (19-3,5-0 Pac-10) to
a 7-0 trouncing of No. 26 Pepperdine (14-10) yesterday
at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
"They're two such different individuals," head
coach Dick Gould said of Martin and Lipsky. "They've
both played from one to three in the lineup in the last
few years and they've both done great jobs.
"They're both fine double players. We're going to
miss them dramatically next year, that's for sure."
Fans hung up signs emblazoned with "We love
DMO... so hot always!!" and "Thank you for the
memories Scott!" behind courts one and two, the
courts where Martin and Lipsky play singles.
"I've really enjoyed playing in the [Taube] stadium
these last few years," Lipsky said. "It's been an honor to
play for Stanford and I've had a lot of fun here."
The Cardinal dominated from the start, winning all
three doubles matches by a two service-break margin.
Martin and Lipsky, the second ranked doubles tandem
in the country, routed No. 9 Diego Acuna and Calle
Hansen 8-4.
Freshmen KC Corkery and James Pade looked im
pressive in an 8-4 win over the Waves' Scott Doerner
and Pedro Rico.
Junior Carter Morris and sophomore Sam War
burg won easily 8-3 on court three against Alexis
Rafidison and Kevin Borzenski.
