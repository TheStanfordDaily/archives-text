No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team (19-3,5-0 Pac-10) to
a 7-0 trouncing of No. 26 Pepperdine (14-10) yesterday
at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
"They're two such different individuals," head
coach Dick Gould said of Martin and Lipsky. "They've
both played from one to three in the lineup in the last
few years and they've both done great jobs.
"They're both fine double players. We're going to
miss them dramatically next year, that's for sure."
Fans hung up signs emblazoned with "We love
DMO... so hot always!!" and "Thank you for the
memories Scott!" behind courts one and two, the
courts where Martin and Lipsky play singles.
"I've really enjoyed playing in the [Taube] stadium
these last few years," Lipsky said. "It's been an honor to
play for Stanford and I've had a lot of fun here."
The Cardinal dominated from the start, winning all
three doubles matches by a two service-break margin.
Martin and Lipsky, the second ranked doubles tandem
in the country, routed No. 9 Diego Acuna and Calle
Hansen 8-4.
Freshmen KC Corkery and James Pade looked im
pressive in an 8-4 win over the Waves' Scott Doerner
and Pedro Rico.
Junior Carter Morris and sophomore Sam War
burg won easily 8-3 on court three against Alexis
Rafidison and Kevin Borzenski.

In his final match at the Taube Family Tennis Center on
Tuesday, senior David Martin won both his doubles and
singles matches, helping the Cardinal to its 7-0 shutout
over Pepperdine.
"For the second-straight match,
Sam has called fora body serve in
my first service game and I've hit an
ace out wide," Morris said. " That
got us going and it got the crowd in
volved.
"We also played better in our re
turn games, making our opponents
hit more balls. That's what coach
Gould has been telling us to do."
Stanford swept the singles, losing
only two sets. Martin took on the
hard-hitting Hansen on court one.
Alter being overpowered to lose the
second set, Martin rallied to win the
match, 6-2,1-6,6-3.
Lipsky destroyed Acuna on court
two, winning 6-2,6-0.
"This was one of my best match
es of the year," Lipsky said. "I was
stepping into my returns and play
ing aggressively from the get-go. I
wasn't over-hitting and 1 was play
ing within myself, which I
haven't done very much lately. I was
also happy to be the first one
oil the court today."
Corkery methodically picked
apart Rico, winning 6-3,6-2. He im

proved his team-best dual-match
win-loss record to 16-1. Warburg
also won handily, recording a 6-4,6-
2 victory on court four.
"I was serving well today," War
burg said. "Since I was holding
serve so easily, that made things eas
ier. I only had to play one good
return game a set and that was
enough."
Pade trailed in the first set 4-1,
but recovered to post a 6-4,6-4
triumph on court five. Sophomore
Phil Sheng completed the sweep in
a 6-3, 3-6,6-1 victor)' on court six.
"This was such an important
match for us today," Gould said.
"These guys from Pepperdine are
good. They beat Georgia in Georgia
and Duke at Duke. This win was
critical."
"You've always got to respect
Pepperdine," Whitlinger said.
"They've got a very strong tennis
tradition. They're not as strong this
year as they have been in years past,
but they're pesky. We were ready to
play today."
