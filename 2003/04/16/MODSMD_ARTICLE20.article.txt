# Sports act as an expression of war
## 
### 
With the nation engaged in a war
whose start was debated, whose end
is uncertain, and whose goals have
been questioned, professional sports
have provided an unusual medium for fans and
athletes alike to convey their attitudes and feelings
about the conflict. Sports, like war, can be both ral
lying and dividing points for communities, and
even nations.
An illustrative example occurred last Friday
when the Los Angeles Dodgers visited the San Fran
cisco Giants last Friday, as chants of "Beat L.A."
turned into "USA" by the end of the game.
On the other side of the debate, the refusal of tra
ditional allies such as Canada, for example, to sup
port our war effort, was reflected in the booing of the
"Star Spangled Banner" by a substantial portion of
the 16,114 fans at a Montreal Canadians hockey
game on March 20. In retaliation, a smaller group of
individuals booed the national anthem of our neigh
bor to the north. Even before the puck was dropped
on the ice that evening, a polarizing tension had
begun to melt emotions.
Thankfully, this was an isolated incident; colorful
Canadian hockey commentator Don Cherry later
spoke out against the behavior of the fans and sug
gested that it was not reflective of the broader senti
ment of Canadians.
The involvement of the sports community in
wartime is as old as the games themselves. In World
War 11, 1,000 professional baseball players and 600
football players volunteered to go fight abroad.
Baseball great Ted Williams in
terrupted his illustrious career to
fight in the Korean War. On the
other side, no one can forget the
most steadfast image of all —
boxer Muhammad Ali's refusal to
fight in Vietnam.
Sports are about teamwork, vic
tory and respect. Franchises often
represent particular communities,
pitting cities against one another in
rivalries.
In the NBA, tensions between
Texas rivals Dallas Mavericks and
San Antonio Spurs were intensi
fied when the politics of Canadian

point guard Steve Nash of the
Mavericks offended David Robin
son, the Spur who used be a Naval
officer.
The Olympics are an even more
extreme example of the regional
conflict inherent in professional
sports. Physical and mental tough
ness will result in a pleasing victory
to one's own country, over the
"other."
Recently, countless reports of
Saddam Hussein's son, Udai, tor
turing Iraqi athletes as a result of
their failure to perform to his ex
pectations have flooded the news.
A country's sports teams often col
lectively reflect the dignity of a
country.
Consequently, many athletes
and fans have seen it as their re

sponsibility to take action, either in
support or in criticism of the war.
They see something laudable in
protecting what is important to
their communities.
The ESPN Web site launched
an online journal, "Jocks to Gls
Direct" several weeks ago pairing
soldiers with pro-athletes, allow
ing the two to exchange letters. It
is striking to read many of the
athletes telling the soldiers that
they are the "true heroes."
As the 2003 M LB season begins,
let us not ignore the fact that the
emotion in the stands and on the
field are symbolic of a larger pride.
As much as sports are about win
ning and teamwork on the day of
the game, they are genuinely re
flective of a larger whole and in

duce expressions of unity and dis
unity alike.
Undoubtedly, a war is more im
portant than sports to a nation.
The lives of the men and women in
our armed services are at stake. But
the function of professional ath
letes as role models and the media
deluge of sporting events in print,
television and radio suggest that
the sports world is reflective of a re
ality far beyond entertainment.
For virtually all of us, who are
thousands of miles away from the
bullets and blasts of Iraq, a link to
our favorite pastime may be the
most real way to connect to the war
effort.
