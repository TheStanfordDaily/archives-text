# Sports act as an expression of war

### 
With the nation engaged in a war
whose start was debated, whose end
is uncertain, and whose goals have
been questioned, professional sports
have provided an unusual medium for fans and
athletes alike to convey their attitudes and feelings
about the conflict. Sports, like war, can be both ral
lying and dividing points for communities, and
even nations.
An illustrative example occurred last Friday
when the Los Angeles Dodgers visited the San Fran
cisco Giants last Friday, as chants of "Beat L.A."
turned into "USA" by the end of the game.
On the other side of the debate, the refusal of tra
ditional allies such as Canada, for example, to sup
port our war effort, was reflected in the booing of the
"Star Spangled Banner" by a substantial portion of
the 16,114 fans at a Montreal Canadians hockey
game on March 20. In retaliation, a smaller group of
individuals booed the national anthem of our neigh
bor to the north. Even before the puck was dropped
on the ice that evening, a polarizing tension had
begun to melt emotions.
Thankfully, this was an isolated incident; colorful
Canadian hockey commentator Don Cherry later
spoke out against the behavior of the fans and sug
gested that it was not reflective of the broader senti
ment of Canadians.
The involvement of the sports community in
wartime is as old as the games themselves. In World
War 11, 1,000 professional baseball players and 600
football players volunteered to go fight abroad.
