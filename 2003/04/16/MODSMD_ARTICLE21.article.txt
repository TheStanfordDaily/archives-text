# Taking close aim at archery
## 
### 
Achoo was probably the first ambassador of
archery to my young life. The Dave Ghap
pelle character — along with Blinkin', the
Sheriff of Rottingham and of course Robin
Hood — introduced me to the pleasures of archery in
the now-classic "Robin Hood: Men in Tights".
So when I saw that the Stanford archery club wanted to
get special lees in the recent ASSU elections, I almost blew
a rotator cuff. At the tune of four bucks per undergradu
ate student, a sport that I had only seen spoofed in bad
comedies from 1993 wanted us to finance its violence.
See, the difference is that "Men in Tights" shenani
gans were cheeky and fun. The archery club's shenani
gans are cruel and tragic.
Which makes them not shenanigans at all really. Evil
shenanigans! (all of you that did not understand that last
passage need watch the hilarious movie "Super Troopers").
But this is not the whole story. I'm not just being a
crotchety sophomore, unwilling to open his pocketbook
for deserving archers. Oh if it were that mundane!
So there I was last quarter, a well-meaning sopho
more, (jut for practice with my Stanford club soccer team.
We have no affiliation with the University or club sports

program, thanks to a bylaw which
doesn't allow dub sports in the same
sport as a varsity program. /Ml our play
ers are former high school superstars
(myself included), but finding field
space is near impossible.
So there we were, warming up on a
section of the East IM fields that
housed a sand pit, cement patio and
astroturf, when who do you think

came up to us and forced us to move,
pointing their sharp sticks at us?
At least it wasn't the field hockey team.
You guessed it, the archery team forced us off the IM
fields and onto a piece of grass so heinous that not even
Snoop would have smoked it.
They spouted off some technicality about them hav
ing field space priority over us, but that was a moot point
to us soccer stars. We talked it over with the William
Tells-in-training, but after a mutually antagonistic con
versation, our disagreement was settled when it was
pointed out that they had weapons and we had none.
Anyway, the point is, when 1 saw that the Stanford
Archery Club wanted $25,555.50 ($4.03 per under
grade I laughed. If they thought that after displacing an
equal-sized group receiving zero dollars (all Stanford
students), I would vote for their proposal , they were
grossly mistaken.
When voting this year, I pictured myself in Tresid
der, going up to booths resembling ajunior high science
fair, each group asking for my money. Some proposed
ethical arguments, some moral, some practical.
Everyday People offered to serenade me, which was
cute. AxeComm said they'd walk around with red
sweatshirts, which was good enough for me. The Chap
pie said they would continue to get drunk and put forth
joke candidates in elections, which was the best argu
ment yet. The Daily said they'd let me keep writing,
which was rather unexpected, but effective.
But archery? Unfortunately, in my daydream, they
could only come up with "We want to arch (is that a
verb?) for free."
Now I am usually fully behind all sporting efforts on
this campus. In my last column, I berated Stanford kids
for being overly sports apathetic. I realize that archery is
a sport. However, The Daily was exactly right, "the en
tire student body should not subsidize or completely
pay for the lessons of a few students."
Maybe I'm biased. Maybe my mind has been cor
rupted by too many viewings of the "Patriot Arrow"
scene of "Men in Tights". Maybe I'm just mad that club
soccer gets no funding. Maybe I'm surly because I owe
45 bucks to the team.
Then again, maybe I should apply for special fees.

team for missing their last gam because he was "looking after"
