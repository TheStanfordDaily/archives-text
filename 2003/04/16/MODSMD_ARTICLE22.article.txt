# Spartans fall as baseball now prepares for Beavers
## 
### DAN URBAN EDITORIAL STAFF 
The No. 4 Cardinal baseball
team defeated the San Jose State
Spartans last night at Sunken Dia
mond, 4-2, to wrap up a short
stretch of nonconference games.
Stanford's victory over the Spar
tans came after wins over Santa
Clara and Sacramento State, and
the Cardinal will resume Pac-10
play this Thursday when it hosts
the Oregon State Beavers.
Oregon State is certainly one of
the weaker teams in the Pac-10(16-
17 overall, 3-6 in the conference),
and the Cardinal is carrying mo
mentum into the series with a five
game and seven-series winning
streak. Furthermore, Oregon State
recently lost its series to Washing
ton State, a team the Cardinal
swept in its last Pac-10 series.
However, having been upset by
the University of San Francisco

Dons before the Washington State
series, the Cardinal knows not to
take any game lightly. The Cardi
nal would especially like to take vic
tories over the Beavers to pad its
lead in the Pac-10.
Stanford, which remains at No.
4 in Baseball America's poll for the
third consecutive week, sits in sole
possession of first place in the Pac
-10 with a 7-2 conference record.
USC has won the conference title
for the past two years, and a sweep
of Oregon State could help prevent
the Trojans from making it three.
"The Pac-10 is very competi
tive," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We have a one-game lead
but not any one team has really
stood up and taken charge of the
conference. It will be very interest
ing to see how the league plays out
the rest of the season. Each week
end is big and you have to make
sure you don't stumble on any
given weekend. We want tocontin

lie to play solid baseball like we
have been."
While the Cardinal did not put
on an offensive display last night as
it did against Santa Clara or Sacra
mento — managing four runs
compared to Friday's nine — the
pitching staff ensured that those
four runs would be plenty. Five
Stanford hurlers held the Spartans
to just two runs.
Freshman starter Mark Ro
manczuk struck out three while
giving up one hit and no runs in
two innings. The Cardinal offense
produced three runs in the bottom
of the second with an RBI single
from freshman John Mayberry Jr.
and a two-RBI double from junior
Brian Hall, giving Romanczuk the
win. Romanczuk now owns a 7-0
record, a rare accomplishment for
a freshman.
Sophomore Billy Paganetti fol
lowed Romanc/uk and threw two
solid innings, giving up one run.

The Cardinal bats remained
fairly subdued by the Spartan staff,
only producing seven hits, a lower
number than the team has been
used to seeing in recent weeks. Hall
drove in three of Stanford's four
runs and was the only Cardinal
with two hits in the game.
Junior Carlos Quentin extend
ed his hitting streak to 22 games
with a double in the first. The Car
dinal's slugger, senior Ryan Garko,
has hit .585 with five home runs
and 21 RBI over a 10 game hitting
streak, but that streak was snapped
last night as he went 0-4.
While the Spartan hitters were
never able to muster much of a
rally off any of the Stanford pitch
ers, they had the least luck against
sophomore Johnny Dyer, who
took over for Paganetti in the fifth
inning and threw a perfect three
innings, striking out one.

After scoring three runs in the bottom of the second, Stanford added an in
surance run off of a sacrifice bunt by junior Johnny Ash (pictured) and a two
out single en route to its 4-2 win.
