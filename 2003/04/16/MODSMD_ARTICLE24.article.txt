Zuropean Birds affected by War in Iraq

Europe may have fewer birds this
year because of the war in the Middle
East. Bog areas in Iraq are important
resting places for the birds as they fly
from southern Africa to Europe.
The traq war affects birds' usual mi
gration routes as smoke from burn
ing oil causes disorientation," said
Pavel Ctyroky, a Czech ornithologist.
Other ornithologists fear that as

many as 1 million migrating birds conic! be affected.
During the first gulf war there were many reports of
storks getting lost or not arriving at all to their desti
nation. Bird Life, the international ornithology orga
nization, has outlined the ways in which the conflict is
affecting birds and is studying ways to ameliorate the
environmental impact.
Cool Star Discovered
The Hubble Telescope just released pictures of a star
(VB3B Monocerotis) that has brightened 600,000
times its intensity. The strange part is how all this hap
pened. With a surface temperature of 2000 Celsius,
less than half of our sun, the star is among the coolest

found thus far.
The star's illumi
nance is attributed
to its massive size
— it is so large that
if it was in our solar
system it would en
gulf Jupiter.
Rather than ex
ploding like a su
pernova or nova,
VB3B Mon has be
come a gargantu
an cool star. 'This

object got bigger and brighter and cooler, but we
don't know why," said Sumner Starfield, an Arizona
State University astronomer. "Right now we know the
effects and we're trying to use the effects to determine
the cause." The study was published in the March 27
issue of Nature.
Of Mesons and Baryons
An international team has observed B mesons de
caying into two baryons for the first time. Wait a sec
ond. Mesons? Baryons? Physicists believe that
everything in nature is comprised of six particles
called quarks. B mesons are particles made of the
bottom quark plus another lighter quark, namely
an antiquark. Baryons are another type of particle
with a different quai k composition. The team made
its observations using the Belle detector at the KEK
laboratory in Japan.
Cannibalistic Dinosaurs?
A study reported in Scientific American suggests
that cannibalism may have existed among di
nosaurs. Majungatholus atopus, a 9-meter tall car
nivore that roamed Madagascar between 65 and 70
million years ago, seemed to eat members of its own
kind. Raymond Rogers and colleagues from
Macalester College in England studied 21 fossilized
bones and discovered that the patterns on the teeth
correspond to the grooves of Majungothalus's
skull. Rogers agreed that the evidence needs to be
reexamined. "We don't know whether Majungath
olus killed both of the individuals in our sample, or
opportunistically scavenged their remains." Anoth
er dinosaur, Coelophysis bauri, has also been ac
cused of cannibalism, though conclusive evidence
has yet to emerge.
Cranberry Juice is Good for the Heart
F orget orange juice, drink cranberry juice. At least
that is what Joe Vinson at the University of Scran
ton would recommend. Cranberry juice has
flavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants miss
ing in orange juice. Vinson studied whether in
creased doses of cranberry conferred benefit or
harm. He found that three glasses a day raised the
levels of good cholesterol by 10 percent and de
creased the risk of heart disease by 40 percent."[ Ba
sically] at the lower dose you get an antioxidant ef
fect and at higher dose you get a [good cholesterol]
effect," he said. Flavonoids are a type of polyphe
nols, which are the primary antioxidants for hu
mans. Fruits and vegetables have a lot of polyphe
nols, but most of us obtain them from beverages.
Breakthrough in Number Theory
Two mathematicians have proven that there are infi
nitely many prime pairs, the difference between the
individual digits comprising these numbers being
very small. Prime numbers arc those only divisible by
themselves and one. Prime pairs are numbers like 11
and 13, which are both prime and separated by only
one. What the mathematicians showed is that there
are infinitely many of these pairs. This is one of the
biggest breakthroughs in number theory in the past
three decades and may offer insights into currently
unsolvable, complex problems.
