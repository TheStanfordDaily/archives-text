# Are subscription video services on the Web worth the money?
## Bringing Cable to the Internet 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
What do CNN, March Madness,
and "American Idol" have in common?
Answer: You can watch them all on
line as part of video-on-demand ser
vices by Real Networks and Yahoo.
Through Real Networks' Super Pass
and Yahool's Platinum subscription
services, both companies are hoping to
revolutionize the online video experi
ence, similar to what cable did to televi
sion in the '80s.
Both services offer streaming video
content for $9.95 per month. Real One
Player Plus, the software used by Su
per Pass, has been available since De
cember 2001. As of the fourth quarter
of 2002, Super Pass had over 900,000
subscribers. Yahoo's Platinum service
was released in March 2003.
Real Player calls itself the "play more
and explore" experience. The upper
left corner of the application's window
shows the streaming video. To the
right, more information about the
video is presented. Below, there's a
Web browser window. The best feature
of the player is that it resizes the win
dows to accommodate different video
dimensions. It also lets you shrink and
expand any video, as well as viewing it
full screen.
Yahoo uses a simple browser win
dow to present its content. Unlike the
Real viewer, this doesn't require you to
download a separate application, but
the video box can't be resized. There's
a full screen option, however.
One drawback of the Yahoo service
is the use of "pop-ups." Since pop-ups
are often used for spam advertising,
many users have software to block
them. However, this prevents Yahoo's
service from working correctly. Yahoo
does offer a solution, but I was unable
to get it working until I disabled my
pop-up blocker. After that, the service
ran with out a hitch.
Real currently has a large collection
of content, including ABC News, CNN,
E! Networks, FOX Sports, Major
League Baseball, NASCAR, N BA bas
ketball and the PGA Tour golf.
Rather than just bringing cable TV
to your computer, Real is striving to
provide interactivity. For example, it
offers a PGA TOURCast, which lets
users view any shot by any golfer on
any hole of the tour. Since most pre
liminary rounds are not televised, this
gives golf fans a chance to see shots they

would otherwise miss.
As the war in Iraq has come to dom
inate prime time television, the online
world has been no exception. Since the
start of the war, Real Networks says
that "[our] servers have delivered ap
proximately five times more audio and
video news content since the war began
than they were delivering in the period
immediately prior to the war."
While many visitors to CNN.com
are surprised that video content now
requires a subscription, CNN has actu
ally been a part of Real's premium con
tent since December 2001.
But with the start of the war in Iraq,
some do not appreciate having to pay
for access to online video.
"Traditionally, content on the Inter
net is free," said sophomore Avichal
Garg. "I don't like that I now have to
pay for something I've gotten for free
in the past."

CNN's material includes Quick Cast,
a service updated every hour, 12 hours
a day, and Iraq Tracker, an edition of
Quick Cast giving the latest updates on
the War in Iraq. It also includes CNN
Uncut, a daily Webcast with behind
the-scenes footage and news stories
created exclusively for the Web.
ABC News content features ABC
News Live, the first 24-hour online live
video news service, with four live feeds
and anchored coverage of world and
domestic events. Also included are
daily replays of recent ABC News pro
grams, including "World News
Tonight," "Nightline," "Primetii r\"
"20/20" and "Good Morning Ameri
ca," as well as archived news footas \
Yahoo currently has less cc it
than Real but has an intuitive and un
cluttered interface. Its content includes
CBS' Survivor Insider, FOX's "Ameri
can Idol," NASCAR, NHL, NCAA bas

ketball, ABC News, CBS Market-
Watch, National Geographic, The Dis
covery and Weather channels.
Perhaps Yahoo's most novel feature
is full game video of all 63 NCAA
March Madness games, broadcast on
the Internet for the first time ever.
The video quality of both services is
quite sharp over a broadband connec
tion. Real allows the window to be re
sized, and the video remains clear up to
about 200 percent of original size. The
Yahoo full screen feature gives a re
markably clear picture.
Real One Player Plus will also play
Window Vledia and QuickTime files,
as well a over 50 additional media
types tas CD-burning options.
While oth servi :s are it. :sting
concepts, it remains to be seen whether
Web surfers accustomed to free con
tent will be willing to shell out $10 a
month for these premium services.

Yahoo's Platinum service (shown above), costing $9.95 a month, provides access to content from ABC News, CBS Market Watch
and various sports outlets. Its competitor, Real Networks, includes news from CNN and sports updates from Fox.. These services
represent a trend toward video content on the Internet that is no longer free.
