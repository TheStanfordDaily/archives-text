# Health matters:
## Lupus sufferers rarely cry wolf 
### 
When Stanford senior
Lena Kay Rufus, 22, died
two weeks ago after a
long battle with lupus, a
chronic inflammatory disease affecting
millions worldwide, I felt compelled to
write this column. Like Lena, I have
lupus.
I was first diagnosed with lupus two
years ago. As with many people with

the condition, I began
experiencing symp
toms years before.
Lupus can affect any
part of the body, but
especially the skin,
joints, blood and kid
neys.
In a healthy per
son, the immune sys-

tem produces proteins called antibod
ies, which provide protection against
foreign bodies, or antigens, such as
viruses and bacteria. But when a per
son has lupus, the body loses its ability
to tell the difference between antigens
and its own cells and tissues. The im
mune system literally attacks its own
body, resulting in inflammation, tissue
injury and pain.
A major problem with diagnosing
lupus is that the symptoms are rarely
visible and often resemble other, less
serious conditions. Many sufferers
complain of exhaustion, achy joints
and a high temperature, which physi
cians sometimes dismiss too easily as

minor ailments.
"In the minds of some physicians, a
patient who looks good can't be sick,"
explained Dr. Jane Salmon, professor
of medicine at Weill Medical College,
Cornell University, who specializes in
lupus research and rheumatology.
"We need to increase professional
awareness of lupus, so that doctors
start thinking of it more. Unless it's up
on your radar screen, you won't con
sider lupus a possibility."
Those who suffer from lupus fre
quently complain that the medical pro
fession views them initially as "winn
ers," "complainers" and "hypochon
driacs." From personal experience, I
know that I listened to my body and in
sisted on seeing a specialist, despite re
peated assurances that nothing was
wrong.
Yet it is not only in the medical pro
fession that there needs to be greater
awareness about lupus. According to
the Lupus Foundation of America, the
disease affects 500,000 to 1.5 million
Americans, with 16,000 more cases di
agnosed each year.
There also needs to be greater
awareness and understanding in the
general public. While many lupus suf
ferers look healthy on the outside, they
may nevertheless feel very ill.
"Having lupus is like having your
mind in fifth gear and not being able to

get your body out of first," said a
patient quoted on the Lupus Web
site in the United Kingdom.
Lupus tends to flare up in un
predictable cycles. One day a suf
ferer will be energetic, the next
they will feel lackluster. This can
sometimes give the false impres
sion that they are lazy or unmoti
vated.
1 remember that as a child,
many years before I was diag
nosed, I would often see my moth
er having to rest in the afternoons,
or getting up later than usual in
the morning. Sometimes she
would ask me to run extra errands,
much to my irritation after a hard
day at school.
Why did I have to take on these
extra tasks? After all, what had she
been doing all day other than rest
ing?
I failed to recognize that my
mother was a harder worker and
more resilient than most. She
raised two children and seldom
lost her smile. Little did I know
that she too had been suffering
from lupus for the past 40 years.
Not knowing this, it was easy to un
derappreciate her.
Tali Golan, a close friend of
Lena Kay Rufus, agreed that there
needs to be better education about
exactly what lupus is and how it af
fects people.
"As much as we felt we knew, we
didn't really know the pain Lena
was going through," said Golan,
who added that her friend, like
many lupus sufferers, did not
openly tell people about her condi
tion.
Rufus was in a "lose-lose situa
tion," explained Golan. If she told
more people about the disease, she
feared they would pity her; by not

being more open, people would
draw the wrong conclusions about
why she sometimes missed class.
Duane Peters, a spokesperson
for the Lupus Foundation of
America, said that this is a common
scenario.
"Many lupus sufferers want to
keep their condition secret and
with compelling reasons to do so,"
said Peters. "People may not nec
essarily want to tell their employ
ers. Others simply don't want to be
seen as weak."
Perhaps for these reasons, my
mother didn't tell me until shortly
before I was diagnosed.
I also have difficulty explaining
my condition to others. But with
out being more open about lupus,
which according to the LFA affects
more people worldwide than
leukemia, muscular dystrophy
and multiple sclerosis, public
awareness will remain low and the
misconceptions will continue.
One common myth about lupus
is that the condition is inevitably
fatal. Some will suffer from life
threatening problems, but for the
majority, the disease is relatively
mild.
What is important to keep in
mind is that the severity of lupus
varies greatly from patient to pa
tient and the condition manifests
itself in a number of ways.
"Lupus is stealth, furtive and
subtle," said Salmon, referring to
its Latin meaning — "wolf."
"Lupus can creep up from any
where."
Lupus predominantly affects
women, occurring 10 to 15 times
more frequently among adult fe
males than among adult males
after puberty. People of African,
American Indian and Asian origin
are thought to develop the disease
more frequently than Caucasian
women, though the reasons be
hind this are unclear.
Although the exact cause of

lupus is still unknown, scientists
believe there may be genetic as
well as environmental factors that
contribute to the development of
the disease, such as infections, an
tibiotics, extreme stress and hor
mones.
There is no known cure at pre
sent, but progress made in lupus
treatment and diagnosis during
the last decade has been greater
than advances made over the past
100 years, said Salmon.
Those who suffer from lupus
currently undergo treatment for
specific symptoms as and when
they occur. In cases of lupus-relat
ed arthritis, for example, physi
cians may prescribe anti-inflam
matory drugs or steroids. There is
no drug that tackles the disease
generally, however.
There are also a wide range of
support networks available to peo
ple diagnosed with lupus.
Robin George, from the Mid-
Peninsula Lupus Subchapter, ad
vises patients to join their local
lupus support group, which will
help them to come to terms with
the condition as well as learn how
to manage it.
"Lupus is a disease you can live
with," said George. "Life can carry
on as normal even though it may
be harder. But there is much hope
on the horizon."
