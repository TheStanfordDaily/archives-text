## Lupus sufferers rarely cry wolf 
### 
When Stanford senior
Lena Kay Rufus, 22, died
two weeks ago after a
long battle with lupus, a
chronic inflammatory disease affecting
millions worldwide, I felt compelled to
write this column. Like Lena, I have
lupus.
I was first diagnosed with lupus two
years ago. As with many people with

the condition, I began
experiencing symp
toms years before.
Lupus can affect any
part of the body, but
especially the skin,
joints, blood and kid
neys.
In a healthy per
son, the immune sys-

tem produces proteins called antibod
ies, which provide protection against
foreign bodies, or antigens, such as
viruses and bacteria. But when a per
son has lupus, the body loses its ability
to tell the difference between antigens
and its own cells and tissues. The im
mune system literally attacks its own
body, resulting in inflammation, tissue
injury and pain.
A major problem with diagnosing
lupus is that the symptoms are rarely
visible and often resemble other, less
serious conditions. Many sufferers
complain of exhaustion, achy joints
and a high temperature, which physi
cians sometimes dismiss too easily as

minor ailments.
"In the minds of some physicians, a
patient who looks good can't be sick,"
explained Dr. Jane Salmon, professor
of medicine at Weill Medical College,
Cornell University, who specializes in
lupus research and rheumatology.
"We need to increase professional
awareness of lupus, so that doctors
start thinking of it more. Unless it's up
on your radar screen, you won't con
sider lupus a possibility."
Those who suffer from lupus fre
quently complain that the medical pro
fession views them initially as "winn
ers," "complainers" and "hypochon
driacs." From personal experience, I
know that I listened to my body and in
sisted on seeing a specialist, despite re
peated assurances that nothing was
wrong.
Yet it is not only in the medical pro
fession that there needs to be greater
awareness about lupus. According to
the Lupus Foundation of America, the
disease affects 500,000 to 1.5 million
Americans, with 16,000 more cases di
agnosed each year.
There also needs to be greater
awareness and understanding in the
general public. While many lupus suf
ferers look healthy on the outside, they
may nevertheless feel very ill.
"Having lupus is like having your
mind in fifth gear and not being able to
