Atoms of iron (protrusions) on a copper surface have been rearranged with a
scanning tunneling microscope tip to read "atom" in Chinese. The literal transla
tion of the characters is "original child." This image is among many available at
the IBM STM Web site. The ability to manipulate individual atoms could allow sig
nificant advances in electronics research, such as in the field of semiconductors.
