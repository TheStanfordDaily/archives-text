# Power lines to deliver broadband Internet access to U.S.
## 
### 
POTOMAC, Md. (AP) —The
walls in a one-story brick home in
suburban Washington don't talk
— but their power outlets do.
From those outlets pour streams
of digital video, interactive games,
online radio stations and services fa
miliar to people who use cable or
telephone modems to get high
speed Internet connections. This
technology that delivers broadband
through ordinary electric wiring
should be commercially available to
some consumers this year.
"This is within striking distance
of being the third major broadband
pipe into the home," said Federal
Communications Commission
Chairman Michael Powell, who vis
ited the house Wednesday to get a
preview of the technology.
The home is part of a trial pro
ject run by Current Technologies, a
company based in Germantown,
Md. The company, working with
the Potomac Electric Power Co., is
providing broadband over power
lines to about 70 homes in Mary
land. Another trial offers the service
in suburban Cincinnati.
Utility companies including PPL
Corp. in Allentown, Pa., and
Ameren Corp. in St. Louis also are
conducting test programs with con
sumers.
Broadband can be up to hun
dreds of times faster than dial-up
service and can deliver a wider
range of services, including high
quality video.
Powell said the FCC is excited
about the power line technology

and is studying whether it needs
regulation. No current rules pro
hibit the technology, but the FCC is
concerned that Internet transmis
sions carried over power lines could
emit signals inside and outside the
home that cause interference.
Companies have struggled for
years to make the technology work.
Only recently have they overcome
technical hurdles such as interfer
ence on the power lines and getting
around electrical transformers that
block broadband signals.
"Power lines are a very difficult
medium to send communications
signals on," said Bill Blair, a utilities
project manager with the Electric
Power Research Institute. He said
the technology is still unproven as a
broadband competitor.
"It is potentially a huge business
if it works," he said.
Jay Birnbaum, president of Cur
rent Technologies, said his compa
ny will offer the power line broad
band this year, but he didn't know
where the service would be avail
able.
He said the cost will begin
around $30 for an always-on con
nection more than four times faster
than a dial-up modem, he said.
Faster services that can match cable
modems would cost more.
Cable modems and telephone
digital subscriber lines, or DSL, typ
ically cost about $50 a month.
Powell has said he wants more
broadband competition to lower
consumer prices and bring high
speed communications services to

more people.
In the Maryland test program,
the company uses a fiber-optic line
to inject an Internet signal into a
power line after it has left a power
station. The signal then moves to
neighborhoods, using equipment
on power poles to leapfrog trans
formers and flow into homes.
"Every outlet in the house be
comes a broadband oudet," Birn
baum said.
The only extra equipment a con
sumer needs is a modem that plugs
into an electric outlet and connects
to a computer or Internet gadget.
About the size of a deck of cards and
costing less than $70, the power line
modems are already in stores for
use in home computer networks
that use electric wiring.
The wiring in the test home is
more than 40 years old and re
quired no changes besides the
modems, Birnbaum said.
Powell watched as a Current
Technologies employee simultane
ously used a special stereo to listen
to an Internet radio station, showed
a high-quality video of a movie
streamed from the Web and played
a motorcycle video game in live
competition with others online. All
the services flowed through a single
power oudet.
"I love this stuff," said Powell,
who described himself as a "techno
ecstatic geek."
Asked if he would put the power
line service in his home, Powell
said: "Yes, I would. I'm a little
bummed it's not in my area yet."
