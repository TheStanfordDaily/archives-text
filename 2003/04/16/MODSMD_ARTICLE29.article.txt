# Cooking club heats it up

### PRITI SANGHANI 
Imagine a table laden with a huge bowl of fresh
fennel, orange and olive salad, a platter of moo shoo
pork, a beef braciole dish and an enormous tray of
aromatic caramelized bananas and apples. No, this is
not a dinner on a five-star cruise, nor is it the scene in
a fancy restaurant in downtown San Francisco. It's a
meeting of the Stanford Cooking Club, a group that
was formed at the beginning of last year by juniors
Jake Kirsch and Pat Dooling, the club's current pres
ident and financial manager, respectively.
The organization, which meets about eight times
a quarter to prepare a gourmet meal — and then
eat it — has been increasingly popular since its in
ception, welcoming Stanford students interested in
cooking.
"I got involved in the Stanford Cooking Club last
year because I heard that Pat and Jake were great
chefs, and I wanted to sample their cooking," said

publicity manager Nicole Hildebrandt. "Once I at
tended a few meetings, I really started to enjoy the
cooking process."
The idea of a cooking club at Stanford began
with a plan to meet and cook on Sundays in Soto,
several of the current members' freshman dorm.
As the group of people interested in a group de
voted to cooking grew, Kirsch and Dooling decid
ed to meet with Joey Greenwell, assistant director
of student activities, and Stanford Dining in order
to become an official voluntary student organiza
tion Eventually, the meetings were moved to Sat
urday nights at the Bollards eating clubs at Suites.
Before each meeting, current menu coordinator,
junior Pilar Abascal, designates a theme and uses sug
gestions from members to create a unique menu that
includes many varieties of food.
"We've cooked Italian, French, Greek, Spanish,
Japanese, Chinese, Indian,
Caribbean and Thai," Abascal said.
"I really like learning about differ
ent types of food that I would have
never tried to cook on my own."
On Saturday nights, the mem
bers meet at 5 p.m. to begin prepar
ing the meal. So that each person
can get involved, the organization
usually breaks up into smaller
groups, pairing less skilled students
with more experienced members to
encourage learning. Allocating
more than two hours for cooking
and the rest of the time for eating

and cleaning up, the meeting usual
ly runs until about 8:30 p.m.
Most members say the time tlies
by while they are working in the
kitchen.
"One of the things I like about
the Stanford Cooking Club is that it
is not a exclusive clique; instead, it is
a group of awesome people who
share a love of cooking and of hav
ing tun," said junior Will Bullock.
Usually each meeting costs about
$10 a person. However, the club ex
pects to receive funding to subsidize
its meetings, bringing the cost down
to about $4 per person.
"It's a cheap way to eat amazing
food, different than what you are
normally exposed to at Stanford,"
Hildebrandt said.

In addition to cooking meals for
themselves, the Stanford Cooking
Club prides itself in participating in
nonprofit events such as An Art Af
fair and Relay for Life. year, the
club was asked to provide meals for
the nearly 500 people that attended
An Art Affair, a success that prompt
ed them to volunteer again this year.
"I've had a lot of fun cooking for
An Art Affair for die last two years,"
Abascal said. "It's fun knowing that
you just cooked a gourmet meal for
hundreds of people."
This quarter, the club also plans
to start a new community service
project in the surrounding area.
Kirsch hopes to lead a Stanford
High School Enrichment Project
class on ethnic finger food.

While a few members oft he Stan
ford Cooking Club have extensive
experience, many others are
novices who share an interest in
cooking.
"Some people come and don't
know anything about cooking; they
know how to boil water and not
much more," Bullock said.
However, Kirsch emphasized
that there is no experience neces
sary to become a part of the Stan
ford Cooking Club, even though
cooking is a task that requires hard
work.
"We welcome anyone who is ex
cited about food, wants to learn and
likes to eat," Kirsch said. "We want
to convince people that they really
can cook."
