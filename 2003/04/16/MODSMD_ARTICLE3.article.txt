Today, Queer Awareness
Days begins with silence.
"We're kicking off QuAD
this year with National Day of
Silence, an annual national
event which has been growing
in size since 1996," said sopho
more Adam Forest, a staff

member at the
Lesbian / Gay / Bisexual / Tra
nsgender Community Re
source Center. "Participating
students on campus will be
wearing NDOS T-shirts and
will attempt to remain silent for
the day in an effort to mark the
silence forced upon the LGBT

community by a largely unac
cepting cultural climate."
Participants and organizers
feel QuAD is an important way to
address unresolved issues involv
ing the LGBT community.
"I see QuAD as a time to show
the diversity and vibrancy of
queer [and] LGBT people and
the way that we have changed
and continue to change the
world," said senior Ming Wong.
"At the same time, it is also a re
minder that we have not come
nearly far enough in terms of
ending discrimination, hate
crime and gender conformism,
as well as securing the light to
choose, job security, affordable
and decent health care, a truly di
verse media and so on."
Besides the significance of ad
dressing these issues at large,
QuAD organizers say it is impor
tant to bring attention to the
troubles the LGBT community
faces at Stanford.
"Because social approbation is
still so strong, many LGBT peo
ple struggle with the sense that
their lives, their struggles and
their communities are largely in
visible." said LGBT-CRC Direc
tor Benjamin Davidson. "Here at
Stanford, many LGBT students
feel alone — although there are a
great many LGBT students on
campus. Because so many people
are not 'out,' the queer commu
nity can seem almost submerged
at times."
QuAD is a long-running annu
al event. Previously, the event
was designated by the acronym
GLAD, for Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days, and was run by
volunteer groups.
"This is the first year that
QuAD has been designed by
LGBT-CRC student staff, rather
than a voluntary student organi
zation," Davidson said. "Many of

the programs were designed in
collaboration with other
groups — the ASSU, Black and
Queer at Stanford, LGBT Meds,
the Queer Straight Social and Po
litical Alliance and the Women's
Community Center."
The theme this year is "The
Homosexual Agenda," which, as
Forest explained, "is a play on
the common misconception that
the queer community is a mono
lithic entity. We hope that
QuAD will be an annual por
trayal of the rich diversity of and
within the queer community,
while providing a safe and intel
lectually stimulating two weeks
of moving, community-building
events."
There are a wide variety of
events occurring throughout
QuAD, including a workshop
and performance by musician
Jenn Lindsay, a reading by
Stanford alumnus Tim West
from his book, "Red Dirt Re
vival" and a talk by Paula Tre
ichler, author of "How to Have
Theory in an Epidemic: Cultur
al Chronicles of AIDS," on the
ramifications of sexuality educa
tion in medicine. The events
conclude on April 30 with "Po
litically Inspired," in which a
panel of writers will speak on
current events.
"These events were chosen
with the aim of conveying the
richness and diversity of the
queer community," Forest said.
Students have high expecta
tions for the upcoming events.
"Hopefully QuAD will do
many or all of the following:
demonstrate the value of queer
[and] LGBT individuals and our
cultures, raise awareness about
the challenges facing queer [and]
LGBT people and communities,
give people information on how
to make change on these issues,
connect the LGBT-CRC to Stan
ford students and the surround
ing community [and] give new
meaning to the word 'fabulous,' "
Wong said.
