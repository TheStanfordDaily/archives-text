# ASSU rules on election
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The contested senior class elec
tion was at the forefront of last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting. Members of the se
nior class presidential slates "Fire
It Up," "Booyah" and "Fast For
ward" were present at the meeting
to voice their grievances and opin
ions. "Fire It Up" won last Friday's
election, after two instant run-offs,
by 10 votes.
The controversy arose from re
ports that some juniors could not
vote in the election due to techni
cal problems with the voting Web

site. Some were unable to access
the site early in the voting process;
others were not offered the option
to vote for the class presidential
election or were given the Gradu
ate Student Council slates instead.
"The basic issue we have here is
that people were disenfran
chised," said Gina Moon of Booy
ah. "Those votes did matter. We're
not asking fora re-vote. We're
providing evidence that perhaps
this should be investigated and a
recommendation made."
Mikey Lee of Fire It Up said
that another election would be bi
ased, since vote totals have already
been made public.
"If we ran this election again,
having those numbers as a stan
dard would change how people
campaign, how people vote, and if
they knew that the slate they voted
for didn't stand a chance the first
time around, they could change
their vote accordingly," he said.
Current Senator and Vice Pres
ident-elect Joey Natoli was con
cerned about how these technical
snafus affected the voting.
Said junior Eleanor Williams,
the ASSU elections commissioner,
"The claims that they are making
about disenfranchising voters we
do take to heart because we are the
elections commission and want
everyone to be able to vote. But we
would like people to see that any
election could have problems, es
pecially when it was online."

The Senate was in general
agreement that a re-vote would be
a complex and potentially unfair
process. They argued that it would
be impossible to establish the same
conditions that existed for the ini
tial vote, that there is usually a sig
nificantly smaller turnout and that
the elections results were made
public — all things that would bias
a second election.
Ultimately, the Senate elected
to create a committee to investigate
which technical aspects of the sys
tem are faulty and in what way
they impacted the election. This
committee will make a recommen
dation next week to the Senate
whether or not to confirm the se
nior election results. The vote
passed with eight votes in favor,
none opposed and two absten
tions. Confirmation of the other
elections will occur next week as
per the constitution.
If the Senate does not confirm
the results of the senior class elec
tion, it will be voided and will like
ly result in a re-vote.

"We trust that the election was
conducted in the fairest manner
practical," said a statement re
leased by Fire It Up following the
meeting. "As we speak, we are al
ready working to fulfill our cam
paign promises by developing
community events with the Haas
Center this week and are laying
the foundation for our Welcome
Back week in the fall."
In other business, Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves
raised the issue of illegal cable ac
cess on campus.
"We need to educate the stu
dent community that it is a federal
offense and it could cause people
great pains and consternation," he
said. "This is a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, for one. You
are violating University policy, you
are violating your housing policy
and you are violating federal law.
And there can be consequences for
these things.
"I do know in Row houses, to
have cable in the main lounge,
they charge an exorbitant

amount," Graves continued. "One
of the things we will be doing is try
ing to get the University to review
how that's done to make it more af
fordable."
Senator Josh Shipp, a sopho
more, brought up the new arts
grant that needed Senate ap
proval in order to begin a public
ity campaign. The measure
passed with eight votes in favor,
none opposed and one absten
tion. Applications for the thou
sand-dollar grants will be avail
able Friday and are due at the
end of the month.
Natoli stated that he and Presi
dent-elect Nadiya Figueroa, a ju
nior, spoke with Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camarillo
about the new alcohol policy for
freshman dorms and will attempt
to evaluate its potential effects.
"The alcohol advisory board
had this handed down [to them],"
Natoli said. "We will be looking
into how to alter that situation so
that more student input will be in
cluded."

In other business, Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves
raised the issue of illegal cable ac
cess on campus.
"We need to educate the stu
dent community that it is a federal
offense and it could cause people
great pains and consternation," he
said. "This is a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, for one. You
are violating University policy, you
are violating your housing policy
and you are violating federal law.
And there can be consequences for
these things.
"I do know in Row houses, to
have cable in the main lounge,
they charge an exorbitant

amount," Graves continued. "One
of the things we will be doing is try
ing to get the University to review
how that's done to make it more af
fordable."

had this handed down [to them],"
Natoli said. "We will be looking
into how to alter that situation so
that more student input will be in
cluded."
