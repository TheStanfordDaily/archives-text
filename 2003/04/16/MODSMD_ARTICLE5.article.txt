### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
As the financial aid deadline for return
ing students passed yesterday, Stanford s
Financial Aid Office noted an increase in
financial aid applications, citing the de
pressed economy as a primary factor.
"I think what's going on at Stanford is
what's going on around the country, said
Associate Dean and Director of Financial
Aid Earl Dowling. "We'll have needier stu
dents on campus. It's just a sign of the
times."
As of April 6, applications for returning
students were up 9 percent and applica
tions for new students were up 5 percent,
according to Dowling. I hough the dead
line for applications next year was yester
day, applications are considered through
out the year.
Dowling stressed that although in
creased financial aid requests are straining
the budget, there will not Ik 1 any decrease
in the distribution of financial aid.

"Stanford has a tradition of meeting
need," he said. "As tuition increases, the
Board of Trustees allocates more money
for financial aid."
Undergraduate tuition is increasing by
5 percent next year.
"I guess because Stanford has more fi
nancial aid, it's not as concerning as it
might be elsewhere," said freshman Alicia
Cruz, who applied for more financial aid
due to a lower family income.
"I figured I'd still get more financial
aid, but I figure more of it will come in
loans ami work-study," she said.
Nationally, tuition has grown rapidly,
especially at public universities, and finan
cial aid has not kept pace in the depressed
economy. Financial aid grew just 1 per
cent last year, according to the National
Center for Public Policy and I ligher Edu
cation, while tuition increased, on average,
by 9.6 percent at public universities.
Seventy-four percent of Stanford stu
dents received some form of financial aid
last year.
