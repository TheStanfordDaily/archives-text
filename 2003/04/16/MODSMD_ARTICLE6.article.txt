Long-time "Saturday Night Live" kingpin
Darrell Hammond had a packed Kresge Audi
torium rolling with laughter last night as he
served up celebrity impersonations, perspec
tives on pop culture and even a few life lessons.
Several students got a glimpse of the man be
hind the curtain, as Hammond spoke freely
with students on a variety of political issues
backstage following the show.
Hammond began by referring to his audi
ence as "the wave of the future," commenting,
"I hope you do better than we did."
His stand-up routine, which lasted a little
over an hour, focused on what he labeled the
"absurdity" of current affairs. Accordingly, he
cited news events that caught his attention for
precisely this reason.
"I read that somewhere there are these
women who, entirely naked, laid in the snow,
and with their bodies spelled the words, 'No
Bush,' " Hammond said. "Once women take
their tops off, they're like the teacher from Char
lie Brown. We don't hear what they're saying. I
know they have a message, but how can you
write to your congressman without a free hand?"
After this opening spiel, it was evident that
Hammond's show was going to be much differ
ent than any of the other guests previously
brought to campus by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau this year.
Hammond then turned to prominent politi
cians and media figures, hauling out his
renowned SNL impressions of recent and past
presidents, news moguls Ted Koppel and Dan
Rather, Jay Lenoand, of course, Sean Connery.
Focusing first on President George VV. Bush,

Hammond said, "I've done 91 impressions in
eight years. I've studied people, and this guy
does things I've never seen before."
Making light of the otherwise somber issue
of terrorism, Hammond joked about actions of
both terrorists and the president.
"[Bush] almost got killed by a pretzel," I lam

mond exclaimed. "Terrorists somewhere must
be saying, 'We're trying too hard. Forget the
nuclear device .. . all we need is popcorn!' "
Transitioning smoothly to former President
Bill Clinton, Hammond emphasized theTeflon
quality of the former leader.
"Clinton got out of stuff James Bond
couldn't get out of," Hammond said. "He lied,
not only on one camera, but on every camera in
the world and got out of it by debating the
meaning of the word 'is.' "
Touching briefly on his past, and perhaps
his southern connection with Clinton, Ham
mond told the audience that he originally hails
from Alabama, "where the whole of the num
ber system consists of one, two and a shitload."
Hammond remarked that his life changed
upon his entry to college, referencing his days
of partying and drinking. As a student at the
University of Florida, Hammond said Mexico
was always a popular spot.
"Mexico is for advanced partiers only," he
advised. "You can find stuff in Mexico that will
kill you for under a dollar. It's not just tequila
down there. It's tequila to the 15th power."
Speaking briefly about his marriage, Ham
mond urged students to learn from his own ex
perience with relationships and romance.
"I lived with my ex-wife for about an hour,"
he said. "You never break up because the magic
is gone, but because you didn't stack the tapes
light under the VCR, or you put the spoons in
the fork slot of the drawer."
Responding to enthusiastic cheers at each
mention SNL's famed Celebrity Jeopardy
sketch, for which Hammond plays actor Sean
Connery, Hammond let his audience in on the

history of the bit.
"Whoever thought it would be
funny for Sean Connery to yell at
Alex Trebek?" he asked." 11 was like
three in the morning and I was
watching The Untouchables and
trying to do Sean Connery. At the
time, Will Ferrell was in the other
room trying to do Trebek and all of
a sudden I just came out with, 'Not
a fan of the ladies, are you Trebek?'
"I'm afraid that that's going to
be my contribution to Western
Civilization," he said.
Throughout the show, and
more toward the end, Hammond
interacted with the audience, ask
ing students questions and accept
ing potential topics of discussion.
"He was hysterical," said fresh
man Natalie Orr. "But the thing
that impressed me most was that
he allowed the audience to put
him on the spot."

Orr was just one of a handful of
students who had the opportunity
to converse with Hammond at the
back door of Kresge after he left
the stage.
"The crowd tonight was very
liberal," Hammond said. "It's the
only crowd I've played recently
when there hasn't been a bout of
hysteria over the war or the Bush
administration."
After answering several other
questions about show business and
celebrities he's encountered dur
ing his time at SNL, Hammond
commented that people need to
learn how to treat one another,
and emphasized his experience as
a resident of Manhattan.
Playing off of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s message that people
should be judged on the content of
their character, Hammond said, "I
always thought New York was the
ultimate content-of-character city.
There you have every single cul
ture in the world packed into this
tiny space, so you better behave
yourself."
