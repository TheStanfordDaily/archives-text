# Congress tackles hot-topic H-1Bs

### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Congress is currently tackling the hot topic of the
H-1B visa, which allows U.S. firms to recruit skilled
workers abroad for employment in the United
States. The piogi am i» seen by some as an opportu
nity for foreign nationals to work and study in the
United States and by others as harming American
jobseekers.
Fliers reading "Beware! H-1B and LI visa pro
grams forcing Americans into unemployment" were
disseminated in Escondido Village and Rains I lous
es in the beginning of March. The posters pushed H
-1B visas to the forefront of issues for Stanford stu
dents, many of whom say they face foreign competi
tion in the job market; however, many students were
angered by the fliers and labeled them racist.
In light of the increasing criticism of the H-1B
visas, Congress has begun to take new look at its H
-1B policies. The cap for H-1B visas in 1990 was set at
65,000 workers. By 2000, the limit was set at
195,000, due to successful lobbying
by the technology industry. The
following year, 163,000 H-lßs
were issued. Despite the dramatic
increase, the number fell signifi
cantly to 79,100 H-l Bs last year.
H-1B visas allow corporations to
hire foreigners possessing unique
skills that cannot be found among
American applicants.

The H-1B has earned the nick
name "lech visa" since 10 to 15 per
cent of workers in professional
technology are foreigners reliant
upon this temporary green card.
Comparatively, only 5.8 percent of
workers from other job sectors are
H-1B foreigners.
"There are huge benefits to hir
ing foreign workers," said sopho
more Vishal Dhiandia, an interna
tional student. "Many times they
just take workers from India and
Asia, pay for their plane fares and
end up saving by paying them less

than American workers."
The ties between Silicon Valley's
dominance in software and the
steadily declining job market in the
area lead many people to see for
eign competitors on H -1B visas as a
threat. Unemployment is currently
8 percent in Silicon Valley, 2 per
cent higher than the national aver
age. This link may have prompted
some Stanford students to partici
pate in what others call "xenopho
bic" and "close-minded" assump
tions about foreign competition.
Corinna Loeckenhoff, a doctoral

candidate in psychology, told The
Daily last month that international
students are often unfairly targeted.
"A lot of H-1B visa holders are
actively recruited by American
companies in their home country,"
she said. "Thus, it is not true that all
international students eventually
end up on a work visa."
Congressional legislation in
2000 allowed for H-1B portability
in attempts to alleviate the employ
ment constraints felt by H-1B hold
ers. With this recent legislation, the
H-1B holder is permitted to find

another job, in which case these
workers are in direct competition
with American jobseekers.
In October 2003, the cap on H
-1 Bs will return to 65,000. The fate
of further H-1B legislation is still
very debatable, with interest
groups on both sides of the debate.
Even though many may worry
about students' perception of In
dians and Asians, two groups that
have been targeted as beneficia
ries of H-1B visas, the general
Stanford sentiment does not seem
to be against the international

community.
"The fliers simply claimed an
opinion [or] fear and didn't seem to
constitute a real threat to interna
tional students," said Stanford stu
dent Ying Wong.
Even so, there is general con
cern for the inflammatory lan
guage used to describe H-1B hold
ers. While H-1R visas bring stu
dents into the United States for re
search purposes, they are expect
ed to reciprocate both by conduct
ing research and by serving as
teaching assistants.
