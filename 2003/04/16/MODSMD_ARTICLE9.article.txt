### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every Thursday night, between 200
and 800 Stanford seniors pile on the
Marguerite and head off fora class field
tiip of sorts — an evening at a local
pub.
"Pub Night," a Stanford tradition,
offers members of the graduating class
a chance to schmooze, boo/.e and let
loose on the dance floor.
According to Senior Class President
Judi Jackson, the major criteria for
choosing the location of Pub Night in
clude the size oft he bar or club, its prox
imity to Stanford and the manage
ment's willingness to accommodate
such a large number of people.
"VVe want the most variety we can
have," Jackson said, explaining how
she makes an effort to rotate popular
spots. Danc ing, billiards and a low-key

atmosphere are always crucial.
Pub Nights are crowded occa
sions— the number of people that
shows up is usually in the 400 range.
"The first couple this year were
packed," said senior Zach Burgess.
"You had to have really sharp elbows to
get on the bus."
Burgess, who spent part of last year
in Germany, disc ussed how he missed
the European pub culture.
"It's fun to be going to bars again,"
Burgess said. "There's not really a bar
scene at this school. Tub Night gives me
the chance to hang out with Stanford
people in a different context, and ever)'
time I've gone it's l>een a different ex
perience."
Burgess stressed how senior Pub
Night, despite its title, isn't just for those
in search of alcohol.
