# Bringing students to the bar scene one bus at a time
## Seniors savor pub night 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every Thursday night, between 200
and 800 Stanford seniors pile on the
Marguerite and head off fora class field
tiip of sorts — an evening at a local
pub.
"Pub Night," a Stanford tradition,
offers members of the graduating class
a chance to schmooze, boo/.e and let
loose on the dance floor.
According to Senior Class President
Judi Jackson, the major criteria for
choosing the location of Pub Night in
clude the size oft he bar or club, its prox
imity to Stanford and the manage
ment's willingness to accommodate
such a large number of people.
"VVe want the most variety we can
have," Jackson said, explaining how
she makes an effort to rotate popular
spots. Danc ing, billiards and a low-key

atmosphere are always crucial.
Pub Nights are crowded occa
sions— the number of people that
shows up is usually in the 400 range.
"The first couple this year were
packed," said senior Zach Burgess.
"You had to have really sharp elbows to
get on the bus."
Burgess, who spent part of last year
in Germany, disc ussed how he missed
the European pub culture.
"It's fun to be going to bars again,"
Burgess said. "There's not really a bar
scene at this school. Tub Night gives me
the chance to hang out with Stanford
people in a different context, and ever)'
time I've gone it's l>een a different ex
perience."
Burgess stressed how senior Pub
Night, despite its title, isn't just for those
in search of alcohol.

"It appeals to drinkers and non
drinkers alike," Burgess said.
Senior Jen Erdrich said she attends
Pub Nights to dance and have fun
with a group of friends, not to drink.
"There are always plenty of
EANABs [equally attractive non-al
coholic beveragesl," Erdrich point
ed out. "And I love to dance. If
there's dancing going on, then I'm
going to be really happy."
Senior Anne Cortina is a regular
Pub Night goer: she went to four
Pub Nights fall quarter and attend
ed at least two or three winter quar
ter. A residential tutor in Otero,
Cortina enjoys the chance to hang
out with senior friends she wouldn't
ordinarily see.

"Pub Night isn't a great place for
deep conversations, but it's nice to
catch up with people you don't
hang out widi every day," she said.
"You see a gcx)d cross-section of the
senior class. You don't need to
party-hop."
Cheryl Burdick, a vice president
of the Senior Class, also enjoys Pub
Night for its social value.
"I can say without a doubt that I
have been introduced to members of
my own class for the first time at Pub
Nights," Burdick said. "And without
our Thursday night tradition, I
would probably feel less connected to
the Stanford senior community."
While a few underclassmen do at
tend Pub Night, despite most pubs
being strict about checking IDs,
Jackson stressed that these Thurs
day evening forays are intended for
the Senior Class exclusively.
"These are meant to be senior

events, so we try to discourage un
derclassmen from coming," Jack
son said.
Nonetheless, Burdick said she
has gotten the impression that more
members of other classes have been
showing up recendy.
"One rationale for why this is oc
curring could be the University's
trend towards shutting down on
campus parties and night life," Bur
dick said, "Underclassmen have few
social options on Thursday night
and hence have been attending se
nior Pub Nights more frequendy."
Cortina, who attended Pub
Night once as a junior, emphasized
diat she didn't have as good a time
then as she's having this year.
"I was really overwhelmed by
the craziness of it all," Cortina
said. "I kept on thinking to myself,
This will be a lot more fun when
I'm a senior.' "
