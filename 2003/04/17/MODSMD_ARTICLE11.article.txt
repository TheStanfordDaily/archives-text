## Bush tells U.N. to lift sanctions 
### 
(AP) — The top commander of U.S.
lorces in Iraq briefed President Bush on
the war from inside one of Saddam Hus
sein's ornate palaces yesterday, underscor
ing the death of the old regime. At home,
the administration reduced the terrorist
threat a notch, from orange to yellow.
Bush urged the United Nations to lift
economic sanctions against Iraq, saying the
country had been liberated by U.S.-led
forces. "Terrorists and tyrants have now
been put on notice," he added.
Four weeks after the war began, Ameri
can troops raided the Baghdad home of the
mastermind of Iraq's biological weapons
laboratory and also discovered a recently
abandoned Palestinian terrorist training
camp on the outskirts of the capital.
Army forces exchanged fire with a small
number of die-hard paramilitary fighters
north of Baghdad, then took out two sur
face-to-air missile systems and three anti-air
craft guns left over from Saddam's military.
Iraqis in Mosul said three people were
killed and at least 11 wounded when shoot
ing erupted for the second straight day.
Iraqis blamed the Americans, but the cir
cumstances were cloudy.
Gen. Tommy Franks, in command of
more than 200,000 troops in the war zone,
lit up a cigar as he toured the palace just
outside Baghdad that had been part of
Saddam's realm. Franks and other senior
officers sat in plush green chairs with gold,
wood trim for the briefing with Bush in
Washington, held over a secure videocon
ference linkup.
Earlier, the four-star general viewed,
with evident disgust, gold sink fixtures, a
gold toilet paper dispenser and a toilet
bowl brush inside one of the bathrooms.
"It's the oil for palace program," he said,
a biting reference to the U.N. program that
allowed Iraqi oil exports on condition that

the proceeds went to food for civilians.
Franks' visit to Baghdad, from his com
mand headquarters in Qatar, came less
than two weeks after Army tanks first rum
bled through the capital and one week
after Iraqis, aided by Marines, toppled a
statue of Saddam in a downtown city
square, signaling the end of his regime.
Saddam twice was the target of U.S.
bombs dropped on places where he was be
lieved to be, but his whereabouts are un
known. U.S. officials say they don't know if
he is dead or alive.

"The fact of the matter is, though, he is
gone. Whether he is dead or alive, he is
gone," Secretary of State Colin Powell told
Associated Press Television News. "He is
no longer in the lives oft he people of Iraq."
Slowly, cities across Iraq were struggling
to shed the effects of the war. After days of
looting and mayhem in Baghdad, Ameri
cans armed newly recruited Iraqi police of
ficers with handguns to help keep order.
And citizens sought to pick up their normal
lives.
"The market is open and products are

available," said Tadamoun Abdel-Aziz as
she shopped with her son for eggs, bread
and vegetables in the downtown Irkheita
Market. But with power only partially re
stored and temperatures in the 90s, some
residents bought 3-foot blocks of ice.
In Washington, the Pentagon's top bud
get officer said the war has cost at least $20
billion and probably will consume at least
that much in the next five months. Bush
also signed a bill that provides $79 billion
for additional war costs and domestic anti
terror efforts.
