# Airline arrives at union deal

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) —
American Airlines flight attendants re
versed themselves and approved $340
million in labor concessions yesterday,
pulling the world's largest canier back
from the brink of bankruptcy. American
welcomed the reprieve but warned that
its troubles may not be over.
The Association of Professional
Flight Attendants said 10,761 votes
were cast for the concessions package
and 9,652 against — a 1,642-vote swing
from just one day earlier, when the at
tendants had narrowly rejected the
package of layoffs, wage cuts and re
duced benefits.
The union and company extended
the balloting, saying some workers had
run into difficulty in voting. American
had vowed that if the concessions were
rejected, the carrier would quickly file
for bankruptcy protection.
"The people of American Airlines
have together made history," said Don
ald J. Carty, American chairman and
CEO. "These agreements represent the
most ambitious effort to consensually
restructure costs ever, not only in air
line history but in U.S. history."
But in a statement, American parent
company AMR Corp. said American's
financial condition is weak and its
prospects remain uncertain. Said
Carty: "Given the hostile financial and
business environment we find our
selves in and its inherent risks, the suc
cess of our efforts is not assured."
And a union spokeswoman said "this
is not a day for rejoicing."
"Tough times lie ahead for our air
line and our members," a spokes
woman. "By ratifying this agreement,
we will be giving up a great deal to try
to keep our airline out of bankruptcy."
