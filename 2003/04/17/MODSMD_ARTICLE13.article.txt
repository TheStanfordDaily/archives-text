## The
						Stanford Daily Alcohol Policy ill-conceived 
### 
Editorial

It is a widely acknowledged fact
that many students under the age
of 21 still consume alcohol, despite
the current law. For many years at
Stanford, University administration
have taken a hands-off approach to reg
ulating underage drinking on campus.
Rather than asking resident advisers
and resident fellows to enforce under
age drinking laws, the administration
has left the enforcement to the police,
who can arrest underage drinkers at
their own will. But in the recent addition
to the Alcohol Policy which was released
this week, the Office of Residential Edu
cation has decided to officially ban alco
hol from all-freshman dorm events.
While a policy regulating alcohol con
sumption on campus is necessary, the
current one proposed by Res Ed is

flawed. As it current
ly stands, the policy
is too vague. Before
the Class of 2007
moves into their
dorms, Res Ed must
define and make
clear the details of
the policy. During
that process, Res Ed
must take into con
sideration the follow-

binge drinking problems.
Moreover, under this new policy, stu
dents may be reluctant to ask RAs for
help in an alcohol-related emergency.
The risk that the policy presents is that
students needing immediate medical at
tention may not receive the proper care
at an urgent time.
Second, the policy does not clearly de
fine when or how punishment should be
enforced. Res Ed Director Jane Camar
illo said the University was not particu
larly concerned with an individual stu
dent who walks down the hallway with a
beer in hand. Questions, therefore,
arise. Which situations call for formal
enforcement of the policy? How many
studento, and how much and what kinds
of alcohol must be involved in the situa
tion? The new policy leaves such

The Office of Residential Educa
tion must take into consideration
how this new policy will affect the
RA-resident relationship and
how this policy will be enforced.

ing two items: how
this policy will affect the RA-resident re
lationship and how this policy will be en
forced.
At the heart of the mission of Res Ed
at Stanford is the role that RAs have in a
dorm. Unlike at most universities, RAs
do not monitor which of their residents
drink alcohol. Asst. Dean and Director
of Student Activities Nanci Howe said on
Monday that the general nationwide
trend of restricting alcohol in freshman
dorms influenced the administrators'
decision to enact the new policy. In
many of these institutions, RAs essential
ly play the roles of enforcers.
But in the past, Stanford has had a
different philosophy about the responsi
bilities of dorm staff. RAs did not police
the halls or enact punishments, and the
rationale was that such a role would di
minish the feeling of trust and closeness
between dorm staff and residents â€” an
atmosphere that may not be as feasible
with this new policy. This trust is impor
tant for many reasons. Not only do stu
dents feel that they can relate more
closely with their dorm staff, but stu
dents are also more likely to turn to their
RAs if a resident is experiencing any

specifics unan
swered.
Moreover, there
is no mention of
how this policy will
be enforced. There
are no guidelines
that RAs or other
dorm staff can use
to gauge what con
stitutes a "dorm
event." The vague

wording could lead
to misunderstandings and confronta
tions between dorm staff, University ad
ministrators and students.
An alcohol policy of some form is
needed at every university, including
Stanford. Due to legal obligations, Stan
ford could feasibly be sued by parents of
a student who dies in a freshman dorm
party due to excessive alcohol consump
tion and the University must create nec
essary regulations to avoid such legal
repercussions. Furthermore, some
might argue the University also has a
moral responsibility to ensure that its
students are safe and do not engage in
life-threatening activities. But the policy,
as it stands, seems likely to add more
confusion to the purpose of residential
education.
While the University's additions to
the Alcohol Policy are well-intended,
currently there are too many aspects of
the policy that are unclear. As it contin
ues to fine-tune the additions, Res Ed
should consult RAs and RFs before next
September. At the same time, current
students should be responsible and wise
about their drinking habits and behav
iors.
