# THE 						REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED
## Voluntary segregation 
### 
The scenario: Aliens de
scend upon the Stanford
campus next week.
They're impaired such
that they can only differentiate be
tween people based on their eth
nicity or place of origin. Their
radar screen soon resembles a bril
liant quilt of fluorescent blues,
neon yellows and dozens of other
colors each denoting the different
ethnicity of each student.
The alien discovers pockets in
several locations on campus that
are demarcated by a single color; it
is these areas he finds most fasci
nating.
The alien continues his re
search, looking fora possible ex
planation. Examining radar im
ages from 60 years ago, he finds a
distinct correlation.
His alien dictionary reads:
"University: An environment
where the most enlightened ideas
become reality; a miniature ver
sion of a perfect society." He con
cludes that because many people
in the University voluntarily
choose to live separately, this rep
resents a new and enlightened
trend in human society. Why are
students returning to the historical
configuration from more than half
a century ago?
In our interconnected world,
we possess the ability to mingle, ex
change ideas and create friend
ships with people from every cor
ner of the earth, from all national
ities and ethnicities. Yet Stanford
University, a place which displays
itself as abiding by significantly
high moral imperatives, has con
tinued to encourage the idea that
people of different races should
separate themselves from the rest
of society by sleeping, eating and
living in separate buildings.
This is unacceptable.
Some students that live in

theme houses might respond that
they feel more comfortable living
in a more familiar setting; some say
they would not have attended
Stanford had such houses not ex
isted. To them, I ask this question:
Would you not have attended
Stanford had you been "forced' to
live with people of different eth
nicities? If so, I wish you'd have

stayed at home.
Place yourself
on the other side
of this equation
and you're no bet
ter than the stu
dents who re
fused to attend
the University of
Alabama after the
federal govern-

ment ordered desegregation in
1963, denying George Wallace's
belief of "segregation today, segre
gation tomorrow, segregation for
ever."
Sure, we all have our individual
ethnicities and the natural reac
tion to cling to what is most com
fortable — our "people." Had
there been a Middle Eastern or
Jewish theme house on campus, I
might very well have enjoyed liv
ing there. Tragically, I would have
emerged from campus with a
group of friends so similar to my
self that my perspective on life
would undoubtedly be more limit
ed.
To live together with people
only like you is to live apart from
society. Period.
I asked people around campus
for their reactions to theme hous
es. One student from India report
ed that theme houses make him
"feel out of place . . . even a
theme house of Indians.
"It would be as unrepresenta
tive of everyday life as a house full
of Caucasians," he told me.

A Caucasian student wrote to let
me know that while it is difficult to
comment on theme houses be
cause he is not an ethnic minority,
he is "generally against them since
they reduce the potential for inter
action between members of differ
ent ethnicities." For him, " . . .
education also occurs outside of
the classroom and racial diversity
is important to help in this educa
tion." I agree.
Growing up, I've been blessed
by somehow always having a close
group of friends of many national
ities. In high school, people joked
about how I hung out with the
multicultural club, as one of my
closest friends was an Iranian Mus
lim (who is supposed to be a good
Jewish boy's sworn enemy) as well
as a Mexican, African-American
and a buddy from Taiwan. In col
lege, my sophomore Draw group
consisted of students of Indian,
Chinese, Japanese, Israeli and
Mexican descent. They are people
who will undoubtedly be lifelong
friends.
Had I lived in an ethnic theme
house in which I'd have been more
comfortable, I'd have missed it all.
And lastly, last week in New
York I experienced the impossi
ble: I shared a room with a Pales
tinian, who is becoming one of my
closest friends. This is in stark con
trast to the reality of the modern
Middle East, in which even a hint
of Palestinian camaraderie
amongst Israelis can lead to whis
pers of treason, and a Palestinian
who makes friends with an Israeli
risks his very life.
Becoming close friends with
someone who should — by cultur
al definitions —be my greatest
enemy is a testament to the princi
ple upon which open democracies

are founded. To be a true member
of society, you must genuinely en
gage others whom you may initial
ly fear or be uncomfortable with.
This means going to school
with people of different ethnicities
— Martin Luther King Jr. cried
out for this.
This means living together de
spite real differences instead of
solving problems through mass
genocide. We have the story of the
Kurds and Turks, the Hutus and
Tutsis, and the Jews and the Ger
mans to learn from.
This means engaging others on
campus despite ethnic differences.
Don't be that cliquish [insert any
ethnicity] that eats lunch and par
ties with only [insert plural form of
same ethnicity].
This means that when it comes
time to draw for next year's hous
ing, don't pick a theme house. In
fact, write the housing office and
state your support for the elimina
tion of theme houses on campus
(e-mail frogoff@stanford.edu).
Let your newly-elected officers
know your opinions (e-mail presi
dent@assu.stanford.edu).
